Wait, but the problem allows D_i to be any integers, so the total circumference could be even or odd. Wait, the diametric pairs are those pairs (i,j) where the arc between them is exactly half the circumference. So, for a lamp i, there can be at most one j such that the arc from i to j is exactly half the circumference. Because the circumference is fixed. Therefore, each lamp is in at most one diametric pair. Therefore, the total number of lamps in diametric pairs is 2k, where k is the number of pairs. The remaining lamps (n-2k) are not part of any pair. So, the problem can be divided into two parts: \n\n- The pairs (each pair has two lamps). - The remaining lamps (each is a single).

So, t can range from 0 to k. \n\nThus, for a given s = k + t, the number of ways to choose which t pairs will take two colors is C(k, t). Then, for each such choice, the s colors are assigned to the pairs. The first k pairs (each taking one color) get one color each, and the t pairs (those chosen) get an additional color. Wait, perhaps the assignment is as follows: We have s colors. Each of the k pairs must be assigned at least one color. Exactly t pairs are assigned two colors, and the remaining (k - t) pairs are assigned one color. The total colors used is s = (k - t)*1 + t*2 = k + t. \n\nSo, for a given t, the number of ways to choose which t pairs get two colors is C(k, t).

Alternatively, perhaps the code provided in program1.py is trying to compute this using combinatorics. Looking back at the code for program1.py: \n\nThe code has variables like ans = 1, and then multiplies by various terms. The code's loop is over i in range(k+1). Inside the loop, it computes ans as follows: \n\nans *= Binomial(k, k-i, pmod) \u2192 which is Binomial(k, i). Then, ans *= bpow( ( (p - (k-i)) * (p - (k-i) -1) ), i, pmod). Wait, p is M here. Wait, the code uses p = pp (which is M). The term (p - (k-i)) * (p - (k-i) -1) is (M - (k-i))*(M - (k-i) -1).",

Wait, but I'm not sure. The code then multiplies by fact[p] * factorialNumInverse[p -k +i], and then by bpow(p -k +i, (n-2k), pmod). This is getting a bit too cryptic. Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum over the number of pairs that choose two colors. Let me think of the variables: \n\nThe loop variable i is the number of pairs that choose two colors. Wait, in the code, the loop is for i in range(k+1). The term Binomial(k, i) is choosing which i pairs will choose two colors. Then, for those i pairs, each must choose two distinct colors, and the remaining (k -i) pairs choose one color. The total colors used would be (i * 2) + (k -i)*1 = k +i. The remaining colors available are M - (k +i). The remaining lamps (n-2k) can be colored in (M - (k +i))^{n-2k} ways.

The number of ways to do this is: \n\n(k+i)! / ( (2^i) * 1^{k-i} ) ) Then multiply by the number of ways to assign these groups to the pairs (which is 1, since the pairs are distinguishable). Then multiply by 2^i for the assignment of the two colors to the two lamps in each of the i pairs. So total ways: \n\nC(M, k+i) * [ (k+i)! / (2^i) ) ] * 2^i = C(M, k+i) * (k+i)! So the 2^i terms cancel. Therefore, the total ways for the pairs is C(M, k+i) * (k+i)! Then, the remaining lamps can be colored in (M - (k+i))^{n-2k} ways. Therefore, the total contribution for a particular i is: \n\nC(M, k+i) * (k+i)! * (M - (k+i))^{n-2k} \n\nBut the code in program1.py seems to have a different approach. Looking at the code's ans calculation: \n\nans starts as 1. Then, ans *= Binomial(k, k-i, pmod) \u2192 which is Binomial(k, i). Then, ans *= bpow( ( (p - (k-i)) * (p - (k-i) -1) ), i, pmod). Wait, p is M. The term (p - (k-i)) is M - (k -i) = M -k +i. The term (M -k +i -1) is M -k +i -1. So the product is (M -k +i) * (M -k +i -1). Hmm, this looks like the product of two consecutive terms. Wait, (M - (k -i))*(M - (k -i) -1) = (M -k +i) * (M -k +i -1) \n\nThis is equal to ( (M -k +i) choose 2 ) * 2! Wait, (a)(a-1) = 2 * C(a,2). So, the term (M -k +i)*(M -k +i -1) is 2 * C(M -k +i, 2). But why is this being raised to the power of i? Wait, the code uses bpow( ( ... ), i, pmod). So the term is ( (M -k +i) * (M -k +i -1) )^i \n\nHmm, perhaps this is the number of ways to choose two distinct colors for each of the i pairs.",

Then, the remaining i pairs need two colors each, but the code's first term (the bpow term) is handling that.

Wait, the total colors used by the pairs is (k -i) (for the one-color pairs) plus 2i (for the two-color pairs) \u2192 total is k -i + 2i = k +i. So the remaining colors are M - (k +i).

Hmm, this is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should look at the code's structure and see what needs to be filled in. Looking back at program1.py's code: The first missing part is in the bpow function. The bpow function is supposed to compute a^n mod p. The code has: \n\ndef bpow(a,n,p):\n    res = 1\n    while n:\n        if n%2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            a = (a*a)%p\n            n//=2\n    return res\n\nThe missing part is when n is odd. In the standard exponentiation by squaring, when n is odd, you multiply res by a, then subtract 1 from n. So the code should be: \n\nif n%2:\n    res = (res * a) % p\n    n -=1 Wait, but the code's loop is while n: So the correct code for the bpow function is: \n\ndef bpow(a,n,p):\n    res = 1\n    while n: if n % 2:\n            res = (res * a) % p\n        a = (a * a) % p\n        n = n // 2\n    return res\n\nWait, no. The standard implementation is: \n\ndef bpow(a, n, p):\n    res = 1\n    while n > 0: if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % p\n        a = (a * a) % p\n        n = n // 2\n    return res\n\nSo the missing part is the code inside the if n%2 block. The code currently has: \n\nif n%2:\n    # TODO: Your code here\nelse:\n    a = (a*a)%p\n    n//=2 So the missing code is res = (res * a) % p So the line inside the if block should be res = (res * a) % p Then, after that, the code proceeds to square a and halve n. So the missing code for program1.py's bpow function is res = (res * a) % p \n\nNow, looking at program2.py:",

The code's modmul is defined as: \n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here The function is supposed to return (x*y + c) mod MOD. Because in the code's later parts, like fact = [modmul(i, fact[i-1])], which would compute i * fact[i-1], mod MOD. Similarly, in the line frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i)), it's multiplying two terms. The modmul function is likely supposed to compute (x * y + c) mod MOD.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two programs one by one. Starting with program1.py. The problem is about counting the number of valid colorings of lamps arranged in a circle such that no three lamps forming a right triangle have the same color. Hmm, right triangles on a circle... Wait, right triangles in a circle must have the hypotenuse as the diameter. Oh right! Because in a circle, a right-angled triangle's hypotenuse is the diameter. So, any three points forming a right triangle must have one pair of points that are endpoints of a diameter. \n\nSo the key is to find all pairs of lamps that are diametrically opposite (i.e., the arc between them is exactly half the circumference). For each such pair (i,j), any third lamp k must not form a triangle with i and j where all three have the same color. Wait, actually the problem states that there cannot be three lamps with the same color forming a right triangle. So, if there's a pair (i,j) that's a diameter, then any third lamp k must not be such that i, j, k form a right triangle. Wait, but the triangle is right-angled at k? Or at one of the points?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the triangle made by considering the three lamps as vertices is a right triangle\". So any three points forming a right triangle, regardless of which angle is the right angle. But according to the circle's properties, the right angle must be subtended by the diameter. So the right angle must be at the third point. So for three points A, B, C to form a right triangle, one of the sides must be a diameter, and the right angle is at the third point. So, for any three points where two are endpoints of a diameter and the third is any other point, then those three form a right triangle. Wait, no. Wait, if two points are endpoints of a diameter, then any third point forms a right angle with them. So, for any such pair (i,j) which are diametrically opposite, any third point k forms a right triangle with i and j. So, the problem requires that there are no three lamps with the same color where two of them are endpoints of a diameter and the third is any other lamp. Wait, no, the problem says three lamps forming a right triangle. So, if two are endpoints of a diameter, then any third point forms a right triangle with them. So, if all three have the same color, that's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the forbidden configurations are any three points where two are endpoints of a diameter and the third is any other point, and all three have the same color. Wait, but actually, the three points must form a right triangle. So, for any pair (i,j) that are endpoints of a diameter, any third point k forms a right triangle with them. So, if all three (i,j,k) are the same color, that's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the constraints are that for every such pair (i,j) (diametrically opposite), the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that there cannot exist three lamps with the same color forming a right triangle. So, if there exists three lamps with the same color, and those three form a right triangle, then it's invalid. \n\nSo, to avoid this, for any pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, we must ensure that there is no third lamp k with the same color as i and j. Because then the three (i,j,k) would form a right triangle with the same color. Alternatively, even if two of them are the same color, but the third is different, that's okay. Wait, the problem says three different lamps with the same color. So, all three must have the same color. \n\nTherefore, the forbidden case is when there exists a pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, and there exists a third lamp k (could be any other lamp) such that all three (i,j,k) have the same color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that any three lamps forming a right triangle must not all have the same color. So, for any three lamps that form a right triangle (regardless of their positions), if all three have the same color, that's invalid. \n\nSo, the problem requires that in the coloring, there are no three lamps with the same color that form a right triangle. \n\nHmm, so the approach is to count all colorings where for every possible right triangle (i,j,k), the three are not all the same color. \n\nBut how do we model this? It's tricky because the constraints are overlapping. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find all pairs of diametrically opposite points. Let me think: the right triangles are exactly those where two points are endpoints of a diameter, and the third is any other point. So, for each such pair (i,j), the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. Wait, no. Because if i and j are a diameter, then any third lamp k forms a right triangle with them. So, if i and j are the same color as k, then that's a forbidden trio. \n\nTherefore, for any pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. Wait, but that's too strict. Because if i and j are colored the same, but no other lamp has that color, then it's okay. Because then, the trio (i,j,k) would have two of the same color and one different, so they don't all have the same color. \n\nAh right. So the problem is that for any pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose i and j are a diameter. Let's say their color is C. If there exists any other lamp k with color C, then the trio (i,j,k) would all be C, forming a forbidden triangle. So, to prevent this, either i and j must have different colors, or if they have the same color, then no other lamp can have that color. \n\nAlternatively, for any pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, the color of i and j must be unique in the entire set. Or, if they are the same color, then that color can't be used anywhere else. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe the way to model this is to consider all pairs of diametrically opposite points. Let me denote the number of such pairs as k. \n\nWait, first, the problem requires that for any such pair (i,j), there is no third lamp with the same color as both i and j. \n\nWait, actually, the three lamps (i,j,k) must not all have the same color. So, for each pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, the color of i and j can be the same, but then no other lamp can have that color. Alternatively, if they are different, then each of their colors can be used elsewhere, as long as they don't form another forbidden trio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: for any pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. Wait, no. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose there are four lamps arranged in a circle with diameter pairs (1,3) and (2,4). Suppose all four are colored the same. Then, any trio including a diameter pair and another lamp would have all three the same color, which is invalid. So that's forbidden. \n\nAlternatively, if two diametrically opposite lamps are colored the same, then no other lamp can have that color. \n\nSo, for each such pair (i,j), the color of i and j must either be different, or if they are the same, then that color is not used anywhere else. \n\nHmm, this seems like a constraint that's hard to model directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by first finding all the diametrically opposite pairs. Let's call the number of such pairs k. \n\nWait, first, how do we find the diametrically opposite pairs? The circumference is the sum of all D_i. The diameter is half of that. So for each lamp i, we need to find if there exists a lamp j such that the arc from i to j (in either direction) is exactly half the circumference. \n\nSo, the first step is to compute the total circumference, then for each lamp, check if there's another lamp at exactly half the circumference. \n\nThe code in program1.py seems to be trying to compute the number of such pairs. Let me look at the code given. \n\nLooking at the code for program1.py:\n\nThe code starts by reading N and M, then the D array. Then it computes a prefix sum array a. Then it calculates the total circumference as pref (since after adding all D_i, the last element is the total). Then qq is set to pref/2. \n\nThen there's a loop with variables po and q starting at 0 and 1, trying to find pairs where the difference between a[q] and a[po] equals qq. The variable k is incremented each time such a pair is found. \n\nWait, the code is trying to find the number of pairs (i,j) such that the arc from i to j is exactly half the circumference. But how does the code do that? \n\nThe code uses a two-pointer approach. The array a is the prefix sums. The total circumference is the last element of a. \n\nThe loop is trying to find all pairs (i,j) where the arc from i+1 to j is exactly half the circumference. Wait, perhaps the code is counting the number of such pairs. \n\nWait, the code's variables po and q are indices into the a array. The a array is the cumulative sum of D_1 to D_i. So a[i] is the sum from D_1 to D_i. \n\nThe total circumference is a[-1], so half is a[-1]/2. \n\nThe code's loop is trying to find all pairs (po, q) where a[q] - a[po] equals half the circumference. \n\nWait, but the way the loop is written, it's moving po and q to find such pairs. \n\nThe loop starts with po=0 and q=1. \n\nThe loop's logic is: \n\nWhile q < n:\n\n   if a[q] - a[po] > qq: then we need to increase po to reduce the difference.\n\n   else if a[q] - a[po] < qq: increase q to increase the difference.\n\n   else: found a pair, so increment k, then move both po and q forward.\n\nThis is a standard two-pointer approach to find the number of pairs where the difference is exactly the target. \n\nSo the variable k is the number of such pairs. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to considering these k pairs. \n\nNow, the problem requires that for each such pair (i,j), there is no third lamp with the same color as both i and j. \n\nWait, but the problem states that three lamps forming a right triangle (i,j,k) must not all have the same color. So for each such pair (i,j), any third lamp k must not have the same color as both i and j. \n\nAlternatively, the three lamps (i,j,k) can't all be the same color. \n\nSo, the constraints are that for any pair (i,j) that are diametrically opposite, the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose i and j are a diametric pair. If their color is C, then any other lamp with color C would form a trio (i,j,k) with all three C, which is forbidden. So, if i and j are colored C, then no other lamp can be C. \n\nAlternatively, if i and j are colored different colors, then those colors can be used elsewhere, as long as they don't form another forbidden trio. \n\nHmm, so the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nEach diametric pair (i,j) must either have different colors, or if they are the same, then that color is not used anywhere else. \n\nWait, but even if they are different, but one of them shares a color with another lamp, that could form a forbidden trio with another diametric pair. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for all diametric pairs, their colors must be unique in the entire set, or if they are the same, then that color is not used elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for each diametric pair, the two lamps in the pair must not share a color with any other lamp. \n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that for any diametric pair (i,j), the color of i and j must be unique to them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the colors of the diametric pairs must form a certain structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of valid colorings is equal to M^N minus the invalid colorings. But inclusion-exclusion might be too hard here. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering that each diametric pair (i,j) must not have a third lamp with the same color as both. \n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to model the problem as follows: \n\nLet k be the number of diametric pairs. \n\nEach diametric pair (i,j) can be considered as a \"forbidden\" pair in terms of their colors. \n\nThe constraints are that for each such pair (i,j), the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: \n\nAll the lamps in the diametric pairs must have colors that are unique to their pair, or if they are the same, then that color is not used elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, the colors of the diametric pairs must be such that no color is used in more than one pair, and also not used elsewhere. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the problem in terms of the constraints. \n\nThe forbidden condition is that there exists three lamps forming a right triangle (i,j,k) with all three the same color. \n\nEach such trio must be avoided. \n\nThe right triangles are exactly those where (i,j) is a diametric pair and k is any other lamp. \n\nTherefore, for any diametric pair (i,j), the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, that's the key! Because if i and j are a diametric pair, then any third lamp k with the same color as i and j would form a forbidden trio. \n\nTherefore, the constraints are: \n\nFor any diametric pair (i,j), the color of i and j must be unique to them. \n\nWait, no. Because if i and j are colored the same, then that color can't be used anywhere else. \n\nAlternatively, the color of i and j can be the same or different, but if they are the same, then no other lamp can have that color. \n\nAlternatively, the color of i and j can be any color, but if they are the same, then that color must not be used by any other lamp. \n\nSo, for each diametric pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must either be different, or if they are the same, then that color is not used by any other lamp. \n\nHmm, this seems manageable. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nLet the number of diametric pairs be k. \n\nEach pair (i,j) can be treated as a unit. \n\nThe total number of colorings must satisfy the constraints for all these pairs. \n\nLet me consider the pairs as edges. \n\nThe problem requires that for each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider that for each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must be unique to their pair. \n\nAlternatively, the colors of the pair can be any color, but if they are the same, then that color can't be used elsewhere. \n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to model this as follows: \n\nWe can choose for each pair (i,j) a color for i and j, such that if they are the same color, that color is not used elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be broken down into two parts: \n\n1. Choose colors for all the diametric pairs. \n\n2. Choose colors for the remaining lamps (those not in any diametric pair) such that they don't conflict with the pairs. \n\nWait, but first, note that each lamp can be part of at most one diametric pair. Because if a lamp is part of two pairs, then the circumference would have to be such that two different diameters exist for that lamp, which would require the circumference to be even and the lamp's position allows two different diameters. But in a circle, each lamp has exactly one diametrically opposite lamp (if the circumference is even). Wait, but the problem allows D_i to be any integers, so the total circumference could be even or odd. \n\nWait, the diametric pairs are those pairs (i,j) where the arc between them is exactly half the circumference. So, for a lamp i, there can be at most one j such that the arc from i to j is exactly half the circumference. Because the circumference is fixed. \n\nTherefore, each lamp is in at most one diametric pair. \n\nTherefore, the total number of lamps in diametric pairs is 2k, where k is the number of pairs. The remaining lamps (n-2k) are not part of any pair. \n\nSo, the problem can be divided into two parts: \n\n- The pairs (each pair has two lamps). \n\n- The remaining lamps (each is a single). \n\nNow, the constraints are: \n\nFor each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, no. The constraint is that for any pair (i,j), there is no third lamp k with the same color as both i and j. \n\nWait, the problem says that three lamps forming a right triangle (i,j,k) must not all have the same color. \n\nSo, for each pair (i,j), any third lamp k must not have the same color as both i and j. \n\nTherefore, the color of i and j can be the same or different, but if they are the same, then no other lamp can have that color. \n\nAlternatively, if the pair (i,j) has colors C and D, then any other lamp can have color C or D only if they are not part of a trio with (i,j). \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the constraints again. \n\nThe forbidden condition is that there exists three lamps forming a right triangle (i,j,k) with all three the same color. \n\nEach such trio must be avoided. \n\nThe trio (i,j,k) is a right triangle if (i,j) is a diametric pair and k is any other lamp. \n\nTherefore, for any diametric pair (i,j), the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, no. Because if i and j are colored C, and another lamp k is also colored C, then the trio (i,j,k) would all be C, which is forbidden. \n\nTherefore, the colors of i and j must not be used by any other lamp. \n\nWait, that's the key! \n\nSo, for each diametric pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must be unique to them. \n\nWait, but if i and j are colored the same, then that color can't be used by any other lamp. \n\nAlternatively, if i and j are colored different colors, then those two colors can't be used by any other lamp. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose pair (i,j) is colored C and D. Then, any other lamp can't be C or D? Because if another lamp is C, then (i,j,k) would have i and k as C, but j is D. So the trio (i,j,k) would have two C's and one D, so not all three the same. So that's okay. \n\nWait, the problem requires that all three have the same color. So, if i and j are colored C and D, then any other lamp can be colored C or D, as long as they don't form a trio with another pair. \n\nWait, no. The problem is only about the trio (i,j,k) where (i,j) is a diametric pair. \n\nSo, for that trio, if k is colored C, then the trio (i,j,k) has colors C, D, C. Not all same. So that's okay. \n\nTherefore, the only forbidden case is when all three have the same color. \n\nTherefore, for each diametric pair (i,j), the colors of i and j can be any colors, but if they are the same color, then that color must not be used by any other lamp. \n\nIf they are different colors, then those two colors can be used by other lamps, provided they don't form a forbidden trio with another pair. \n\nWait, but other pairs also have their own constraints. \n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. \n\nPerhaps the solution is to model the problem as follows: \n\nEach diametric pair (i,j) can choose a color for i and j such that: \n\nEither: \n\n- They choose different colors, say C and D. Then, those colors can be used elsewhere, but must not form a trio with another pair. \n\nOr: \n\n- They choose the same color, say C. Then, no other lamp can have color C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that for each pair, the two lamps must have colors that are unique to their pair. \n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to think of the problem as follows: \n\nThe forbidden condition is that for any diametric pair (i,j), there exists a third lamp k with the same color as both i and j. \n\nTherefore, to avoid this, for each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, that's the key! \n\nSo, for each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must be unique to them. \n\nWait, but if they are the same color, then that color can't be used by any other lamp. \n\nAlternatively, the colors of i and j must not be used by any other lamp. \n\nWait, that's the only way to ensure that there is no third lamp with the same color as both. \n\nWait, if the pair (i,j) has colors C and D, then no other lamp can have C or D. Because if another lamp has C, then the trio (i,j,k) would have i and k as C, but j is D. So that's okay. Wait, but the problem requires that all three have the same color. \n\nAh, right. So the only forbidden case is when all three have the same color. \n\nTherefore, the constraints are: \n\nFor any diametric pair (i,j), the color of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, no. Because if i is color C and j is color D, then another lamp can be color C or D, but not both. \n\nWait, the problem is only when all three are the same. \n\nSo, the only forbidden case is when there exists a color C such that both i and j are C, and some other lamp is also C. \n\nTherefore, the constraints are: \n\nFor each pair (i,j), if they are colored the same color C, then no other lamp can be C. \n\nIf they are colored different colors, then those colors can be used elsewhere, as long as they don't form a forbidden trio with another pair. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the problem can be modeled by considering that for each pair, the two lamps can choose colors in such a way that their colors are not used by any other lamp. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two cases: \n\nCase 1: All diametric pairs have distinct colors for their two lamps, and those colors are not used elsewhere. \n\nCase 2: Some pairs have the same color, but that color is not used elsewhere. \n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the problem as follows: \n\nLet k be the number of diametric pairs. \n\nEach pair can choose a color for their two lamps. \n\nThe constraints are that for any pair, if the two lamps are the same color, then that color is not used by any other lamp. \n\nIf they are different colors, then those two colors can be used by other pairs, but not by other lamps outside the pairs. \n\nWait, no. Because other pairs can also have their own colors. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that for any pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must not be used by any other lamp. \n\nWait, that would ensure that no third lamp has the same color as either i or j. \n\nWait, but that's too strict. Because then, the colors of the pairs can't be reused, but the non-pair lamps can choose any colors except those used in the pairs. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe total number of valid colorings is equal to the sum over all possible choices of colors for the pairs and the remaining lamps, such that: \n\n- For each pair (i,j), their colors are either: \n\n   a) Different colors, say C and D. Then, no other lamp (including other pairs) can have C or D. \n\n   b) Same color C. Then, no other lamp (including other pairs) can have C. \n\nWait, but this would mean that all pairs' colors must be unique and not overlapping with each other or the remaining lamps. \n\nBut this seems too restrictive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that for each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, that would mean that the colors of the pair are unique to them. \n\nSo, for each pair (i,j), their colors must be unique to them. \n\nWait, but if they choose the same color, then that color is unique to them. \n\nSo, the total colors used for the pairs must be such that no two pairs share a color, and also the remaining lamps can't use any of those colors. \n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the colors of the pairs must form a set of colors that are not used by any other lamps. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables. \n\nLet k be the number of diametric pairs. \n\nEach pair has two lamps. \n\nThe remaining lamps are n - 2k in number. \n\nThe constraints are that for any pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, that's the key! \n\nSo, the colors of the pair's lamps must be unique to them. \n\nTherefore, the colors of the pairs must be chosen such that no other lamp (including other pairs) has those colors. \n\nWait, but that would mean that all pairs must have colors that are unique to their own pair. \n\nWait, for example, if a pair (i,j) chooses colors C and D, then no other pair can use C or D, and the remaining lamps can't use them either. \n\nAlternatively, if a pair chooses the same color C, then no other pair can use C, and the remaining lamps can't use C. \n\nThis way, the colors of the pairs are all unique and not used elsewhere. \n\nThen, the remaining lamps can choose any colors not used by the pairs. \n\nWait, this seems like a possible approach. \n\nLet me formalize this: \n\nLet the number of pairs be k. \n\nEach pair must choose a color for each of its two lamps. \n\nThe colors chosen for the pair must not be used by any other pair or any remaining lamp. \n\nTherefore, the colors used by the pairs must be distinct from each other and from the colors used by the remaining lamps. \n\nWait, but the remaining lamps can choose any colors except those used by the pairs. \n\nHmm, but this would require that the colors of the pairs are all distinct from each other and from the remaining lamps. \n\nAlternatively, the colors of the pairs must form a set of colors that are not used by any other lamps. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe total number of colors used by the pairs must be 2k (if all pairs choose different colors for their two lamps) or less. \n\nWait, this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the colors of the pairs must be chosen from a set of colors that are not used by any other lamps. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nThe pairs must choose their colors in such a way that their colors are not used by any other lamps. \n\nTherefore, the colors of the pairs are \"reserved\" and cannot be used by any other lamps. \n\nThe remaining lamps can choose any colors from the remaining M - (number of colors used by pairs) colors. \n\nWait, but how do we count this? \n\nLet me think of the pairs first. \n\nEach pair can choose two colors, but those colors must not be used by any other pair or the remaining lamps. \n\nAlternatively, each pair can choose a color for each lamp, but the colors must be unique across all pairs and the remaining lamps. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the colors of the pairs are all distinct from each other and from the remaining lamps. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe forbidden condition is that for any pair (i,j), there exists a third lamp with the same color as both i and j. \n\nTo prevent this, for each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must not be the same as any other lamp's color. \n\nWait, that's the key! \n\nSo, for each pair (i,j), the colors of i and j must be unique to them. \n\nTherefore, the colors of i and j can't be used by any other lamp. \n\nTherefore, the colors of the pairs must be chosen such that no two pairs share a color, and also the remaining lamps can't use any of those colors. \n\nWait, but the remaining lamps can choose any colors except those used by the pairs. \n\nWait, but the remaining lamps can't use any colors used by the pairs. \n\nSo, the total colors available for the remaining lamps are M minus the number of colors used by the pairs. \n\nHmm, so the approach is: \n\n1. Choose colors for each pair. \n\n   For each pair, the two lamps can choose any two colors (possibly the same), but those colors must not be used by any other pair or the remaining lamps. \n\n   So, the colors chosen for the pairs must be unique across all pairs. \n\nWait, but if two pairs choose the same color for one of their lamps, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, the colors of all pairs must be distinct from each other. \n\nWait, perhaps the colors of the pairs must form a set of colors that are all distinct. \n\nWait, let me think of the pairs as needing to choose colors such that all colors used in any pair are unique. \n\nSo, for each pair, the two colors chosen must not be used by any other pair. \n\nTherefore, the total number of colors used by the pairs is between k and 2k, depending on whether they choose the same or different colors. \n\nWait, for each pair, if they choose two different colors, that uses two new colors. \n\nIf they choose the same color, that uses one new color. \n\nTherefore, the total number of colors used by the pairs is between k and 2k. \n\nThe remaining lamps can choose any colors from the remaining M - (number of colors used by pairs) colors. \n\nHmm, this seems manageable. \n\nThe total number of valid colorings would then be the sum over all possible ways to choose colors for the pairs and the remaining lamps, such that the colors of the pairs are unique and not used elsewhere. \n\nThe problem is to compute this sum modulo 998244353. \n\nLet me formalize this: \n\nLet the number of pairs be k. \n\nEach pair can choose a color for each of its two lamps. \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each pair, the number of colors used as c_i (either 1 or 2). \n\nThe total colors used by all pairs is S = sum_{i=1 to k} c_i. \n\nThe remaining lamps (n-2k) can choose any colors from the remaining (M - S) colors. \n\nThe total number of colorings would then be the product of: \n\n- The number of ways to choose colors for the pairs, ensuring that all colors are distinct between pairs. \n\n- The number of ways to color the remaining lamps with the remaining colors. \n\nBut how do we compute this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that each pair must choose a set of colors (either one or two) that are not used by any other pair or the remaining lamps. \n\nThe total number of colors available is M. \n\nThe pairs must choose their colors first, and the remaining lamps choose from the remaining colors. \n\nThe total number of ways is the sum over all possible choices of colors for the pairs (with their colors being unique) multiplied by the number of ways to color the remaining lamps with the remaining colors. \n\nThis seems like a combinatorial problem. \n\nLet me think of it as follows: \n\nWe need to choose for each pair a color for each of its two lamps, such that all colors used in the pairs are distinct. \n\nLet\u2019s denote that for each pair, we can choose either: \n\n- Two distinct colors, which uses two new colors. \n\n- One color (for both lamps), which uses one new color. \n\nThe total number of colors used by the pairs is between k and 2k. \n\nThe remaining lamps can choose any of the remaining (M - total_used) colors. \n\nThe total number of colorings is the sum over all possible ways to choose the pairs' colors (with distinct colors between pairs) multiplied by (M - total_used)^remaining. \n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using generating functions or combinatorics. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nEach pair has two options: \n\nOption 1: Choose two distinct colors. This uses two new colors. \n\nOption 2: Choose the same color for both lamps. This uses one new color. \n\nThe total number of colors used by the pairs is the sum over all pairs of the number of colors they choose (1 or 2). \n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of pairs choosing option 1 as x, and option 2 as (k - x). \n\nThen the total colors used is 2x + (k - x) = x + k. \n\nThe remaining colors available are M - (x + k). \n\nThe remaining lamps (n - 2k) can be colored in (M - (x +k))^{n-2k} ways. \n\nThe number of ways to choose the pairs' colors is: \n\nFor each pair choosing option 1: \n\nWe need to choose two distinct colors from the available colors. \n\nWait, but the colors must be unique across all pairs. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of ways to choose colors for the pairs is the product over all pairs of the number of choices for that pair, given the previous choices. \n\nThis seems like a permutation problem. \n\nLet me think of it as first selecting a set of colors for all pairs. \n\nThe total number of colors used must be between k and 2k. \n\nSuppose we choose exactly s colors for the pairs. \n\nThen s must be between k and 2k. \n\nThe number of ways to choose s colors from M is C(M, s). \n\nThen, we need to assign these s colors to the pairs in such a way that each pair uses either one or two colors. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe pairs must choose colors such that all colors used are distinct. \n\nEach pair can choose either one or two colors. \n\nThe total number of colors used is s, which must be between k and 2k. \n\nThe number of ways to choose s colors from M is C(M, s). \n\nThen, we need to distribute these s colors among the k pairs such that each pair uses either one or two colors, and the total is s. \n\nThe number of ways to distribute s colors into k pairs with each pair taking 1 or 2 colors is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of (s -k) pairs to take an extra color. \n\nWait, because each pair must take at least 1 color. \n\nThe total number of colors used is s = k + t, where t is the number of pairs that choose two colors (since each such pair adds an extra color). \n\nSo, t can range from 0 to k. \n\nThus, for a given s = k + t, the number of ways to choose which t pairs will take two colors is C(k, t). \n\nThen, for each such choice, the s colors are assigned to the pairs. \n\nThe first k pairs (each taking one color) get one color each, and the t pairs (those chosen) get an additional color. \n\nWait, perhaps the assignment is as follows: \n\nWe have s colors. \n\nEach of the k pairs must be assigned at least one color. \n\nExactly t pairs are assigned two colors, and the remaining (k - t) pairs are assigned one color. \n\nThe total colors used is s = (k - t)*1 + t*2 = k + t. \n\nSo, for a given t, the number of ways to choose which t pairs get two colors is C(k, t). \n\nThen, the number of ways to assign the s colors to the pairs is: \n\nFirst, choose a permutation of the s colors. \n\nThen, assign the first (k) colors to the pairs: each of the (k - t) pairs get one color, and the t pairs get two colors. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as: \n\nThe s colors are divided into k groups, where exactly t groups have two colors and (k - t) have one. \n\nThe number of ways to partition s colors into such groups is: \n\n(s)! / (product over each group's size factorial) multiplied by the number of ways to choose which groups have two colors. \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, the number of ways to assign the s colors to the pairs is: \n\nFirst, choose which t pairs will have two colors. \n\nThen, assign the s colors to the pairs such that each of those t pairs gets two colors and the others get one. \n\nThe number of ways is: \n\nC(k, t) * (s! ) / ( (2^t) * product_{each pair} (1 or 2) ?) \n\nWait, perhaps the number of ways is: \n\nC(k, t) * (s! ) / ( (1!^{k-t} * 2!^t) ) \n\nBecause for each of the t pairs with two colors, the order of the two colors doesn't matter (since the pair's two lamps can have the two colors in any order?), but actually, the two lamps in a pair can have different colors, so the order matters. \n\nWait, for a pair choosing two colors, the two lamps can be assigned the two colors in two different ways. \n\nAh, right! \n\nSo, for a pair that chooses two distinct colors, the two lamps can be colored in two ways (color A for first, B for second, or vice versa). \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways for a pair choosing two colors is 2 * C(available_colors, 2). \n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires a generating function approach. \n\nLet me think of the total number of ways to choose colors for the pairs as follows: \n\nEach pair has two options: \n\nOption 1: Choose two distinct colors. This uses two new colors and contributes a factor of (M choose 2) * 2 (since the two colors can be assigned to the two lamps in two ways). \n\nOption 2: Choose the same color for both lamps. This uses one new color and contributes a factor of M (choose the color, and assign it to both lamps). \n\nWait, but the colors must be unique across all pairs. \n\nSo, the first pair has M colors to choose from. \n\nThe second pair has (M - previous colors) options. \n\nThis seems like a permutation problem where the order of choosing matters. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of ways to choose colors for all pairs is the product for each pair of the number of available choices at that step. \n\nBut this is difficult to compute directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code provided in program1.py is trying to compute this using combinatorics. \n\nLooking back at the code for program1.py: \n\nThe code has variables like ans = 1, and then multiplies by various terms. \n\nThe code's loop is over i in range(k+1). \n\nInside the loop, it computes ans as follows: \n\nans *= Binomial(k, k-i, pmod) \u2192 which is Binomial(k, i). \n\nThen, ans *= bpow( ( (p - (k-i)) * (p - (k-i) -1) ), i, pmod). \n\nWait, p is M here. \n\nWait, the code uses p = pp (which is M). \n\nThe term (p - (k-i)) * (p - (k-i) -1) is (M - (k-i))*(M - (k-i) -1). \n\nHmm, perhaps this is the number of ways to choose two distinct colors for each of the i pairs that choose two colors. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nThe code then multiplies by fact[p] * factorialNumInverse[p -k +i], and then by bpow(p -k +i, (n-2k), pmod). \n\nThis is getting a bit too cryptic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum over the number of pairs that choose two colors. \n\nLet me think of the variables: \n\nThe loop variable i is the number of pairs that choose two colors. \n\nWait, in the code, the loop is for i in range(k+1). \n\nThe term Binomial(k, i) is choosing which i pairs will choose two colors. \n\nThen, for those i pairs, each must choose two distinct colors, and the remaining (k -i) pairs choose one color. \n\nThe total colors used would be (i * 2) + (k -i)*1 = k +i. \n\nThe remaining colors available are M - (k +i). \n\nThe remaining lamps (n-2k) can be colored in (M - (k +i))^{n-2k} ways. \n\nThe pairs choosing two colors must choose two distinct colors from the available colors. \n\nThe pairs choosing one color must choose one color from the available colors. \n\nBut how to compute the number of ways to choose the colors for the pairs? \n\nThe total number of ways to choose colors for the pairs is: \n\nFirst, choose (k +i) colors from M. \n\nThen, assign to the i pairs two colors each, and the remaining (k -i) pairs one color each. \n\nThe number of ways to do this is: \n\nC(M, k+i) * ( (k+i)! ) / ( (2^i) * 1^{k-i} ) ) * 2^i \n\nWait, the (k+i)! is the number of ways to assign the colors to the pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of ways is: \n\nC(M, k+i) * ( (k+i)! ) / ( (2^i) ) ) * 2^i \n\nThe division by 2^i comes from the fact that for each of the i pairs choosing two colors, the order of the two colors doesn't matter? Or does it? \n\nWait, the two colors for a pair can be assigned to the two lamps in two ways. \n\nSo for each of the i pairs, there are 2 ways to assign the two colors to the two lamps. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is: \n\nC(M, k+i) * ( (k+i)! ) ) * 2^i \n\nWait, because: \n\n- Choose (k+i) colors from M: C(M, k+i). \n\n- Assign these colors to the pairs: \n\n   For the i pairs that choose two colors: each needs two distinct colors. \n\n   The remaining (k-i) pairs choose one color each. \n\n   The total number of ways to assign the colors is the number of ways to partition the (k+i) colors into groups: \n\n   For each of the i pairs, a group of two colors, and for the remaining (k-i) pairs, a group of one color. \n\n   The number of ways to partition the (k+i) colors into such groups is: \n\n   (k+i)! / ( (2^i) * 1^{k-i} ) ) \n\n   Because for each of the i groups of two, the order of the two colors doesn't matter (since the group is just a set), but when assigning to the pairs, the order between the pairs matters. \n\n   Then, for each of the i pairs, the two colors can be assigned to the two lamps in 2 ways. \n\n   So multiply by 2^i. \n\n   So overall, the number of ways is: \n\n   C(M, k+i) * ( (k+i)! ) / (2^i) ) * 2^i = C(M, k+i) * (k+i)! \n\n   The 2^i cancels out. \n\nWait, that's interesting. \n\nSo the total ways for the pairs is C(M, k+i) * (k+i)! \n\nThen, for each of the i pairs, the two colors are assigned to the two lamps in 2 ways, but that's already accounted for in the (k+i)! ? \n\nHmm, perhaps the (k+i)! is the number of ways to assign the colors to the pairs, considering the order. \n\nWait, perhaps the total number of ways to choose and assign colors to the pairs is: \n\nC(M, k+i) * (k+i)! * 2^i \n\nBecause: \n\n- Choose (k+i) colors: C(M, k+i). \n\n- Assign these colors to the pairs: \n\n   For the i pairs that need two colors: each gets two distinct colors. \n\n   The remaining (k-i) pairs get one color each. \n\n   The assignment can be done by first permuting all (k+i) colors, then for each of the first i pairs, take two colors (in order), and the next (k-i) pairs take one each. \n\n   But this would overcount because the order of the pairs matters. \n\nAlternatively, the number of ways to assign the colors is: \n\nThe total number of ways to partition the (k+i) colors into (k) groups, where i groups have two colors and (k-i) have one. \n\nThe number of ways to do this is: \n\n(k+i)! / ( (2^i) * 1^{k-i} ) ) \n\nThen multiply by the number of ways to assign these groups to the pairs (which is 1, since the pairs are distinguishable). \n\nThen multiply by 2^i for the assignment of the two colors to the two lamps in each of the i pairs. \n\nSo total ways: \n\nC(M, k+i) * [ (k+i)! / (2^i) ) ] * 2^i = C(M, k+i) * (k+i)! \n\nSo the 2^i terms cancel. \n\nTherefore, the total ways for the pairs is C(M, k+i) * (k+i)! \n\nThen, the remaining lamps can be colored in (M - (k+i))^{n-2k} ways. \n\nTherefore, the total contribution for a particular i is: \n\nC(M, k+i) * (k+i)! * (M - (k+i))^{n-2k} \n\nBut the code in program1.py seems to have a different approach. \n\nLooking at the code's ans calculation: \n\nans starts as 1. \n\nThen, ans *= Binomial(k, k-i, pmod) \u2192 which is Binomial(k, i). \n\nThen, ans *= bpow( ( (p - (k-i)) * (p - (k-i) -1) ), i, pmod). \n\nWait, p is M. \n\nThe term (p - (k-i)) is M - (k -i) = M -k +i. \n\nThe term (M -k +i -1) is M -k +i -1. \n\nSo the product is (M -k +i) * (M -k +i -1). \n\nHmm, this looks like the product of two consecutive terms. \n\nWait, (M - (k -i))*(M - (k -i) -1) = (M -k +i) * (M -k +i -1) \n\nThis is equal to ( (M -k +i) choose 2 ) * 2! \n\nWait, (a)(a-1) = 2 * C(a,2). \n\nSo, the term (M -k +i)*(M -k +i -1) is 2 * C(M -k +i, 2). \n\nBut why is this being raised to the power of i? \n\nWait, the code uses bpow( ( ... ), i, pmod). \n\nSo the term is ( (M -k +i) * (M -k +i -1) )^i \n\nHmm, perhaps this is the number of ways to choose two distinct colors for each of the i pairs. \n\nWait, for each of the i pairs that choose two colors, the number of ways to choose two distinct colors from the available colors. \n\nBut the available colors for the first pair would be M, then M-2 for the next, etc. \n\nBut this approach would require a product, not a power. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the term (M - (k -i))*(M - (k -i) -1) is the number of ways to choose two distinct colors for a single pair, given that there are (M - (k -i)) colors available. \n\nWait, but (k -i) is the number of pairs that choose one color. \n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. \n\nPerhaps I should look at the code's variables and see what they represent. \n\nThe code's loop variable is i in range(k+1). \n\nThe term Binomial(k, i) is the number of ways to choose i pairs out of k to be the ones that choose two colors. \n\nThen, the next term is ( (M - (k -i)) * (M - (k -i) -1) )^i \n\nWait, M - (k -i) is M -k +i. \n\nSo this term is ( (M -k +i) * (M -k +i -1) )^i \n\nThis could represent for each of the i pairs choosing two colors, the number of ways to pick two distinct colors from (M -k +i) colors. \n\nWait, but why M -k +i? \n\nHmm, perhaps the total number of colors available for the pairs is M - (k -i) ? \n\nWait, the (k -i) pairs that choose one color each would use (k -i) colors. \n\nThe remaining i pairs need two colors each, so they need 2i colors. \n\nTotal colors needed: (k -i) + 2i = k +i. \n\nSo the total colors used is k+i, so the remaining colors are M - (k+i). \n\nBut the term here is M - (k -i) = M -k +i. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is a mistake in the code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that for each of the i pairs choosing two colors, the number of available colors is (M - (k -i)), which is the total colors minus the colors used by the (k-i) pairs choosing one color. \n\nWait, but the (k-i) pairs choosing one color each would use (k-i) colors. \n\nThe remaining colors are M - (k-i). \n\nThe first of the i pairs choosing two colors would have to choose two colors from those remaining, so (M - (k-i)) choose 2. \n\nThe next pair would have (M - (k-i) -2) choose 2, etc. \n\nBut this would be a product, not a power. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using an approximation or a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the code's term ( (M - (k-i)) * (M - (k-i) -1) )^i is treating each of the i pairs as having (M - (k-i)) choices for the first color and (M - (k-i) -1) for the second, but this is only valid if the choices are independent, which they are not. \n\nThis suggests that the code might be incorrect, but perhaps it's using a generating function approach where the terms are multiplied as if independent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the inclusion-exclusion principle and the terms are part of a generating function. \n\nThe next term in the code is ans *= fact[p] * factorialNumInverse[p -k +i]. \n\nWait, p is M. \n\nfact[p] is M! \n\nfactorialNumInverse[p -k +i] is 1/( (M -k +i)! ) mod pmod. \n\nSo the product is M! / ( (M - (k -i))! ) \n\nWait, M -k +i = M - (k -i). \n\nSo this term is M! / ( (M - (k -i))! ) \n\nThis is the number of ways to choose (k -i) colors from M and arrange them. \n\nWait, (k -i) is the number of pairs choosing one color. \n\nSo for those pairs, each needs one color, so choosing (k -i) colors from M and assigning them to the pairs. \n\nThe number of ways is P(M, k -i) = M!/( (M - (k-i))! ). \n\nThen, the remaining i pairs need two colors each, but the code's first term (the bpow term) is handling that. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\nThe total contribution for a particular i is: \n\nBinomial(k, i) * [ ( (M - (k-i))*(M - (k-i) -1) )^i ] * [ M!/( (M - (k-i))! ) ] * ( (M - (k +i)) )^{n-2k} \n\nWait, the last term is the bpow( (M -k +i -i) ? No, the last term in the code is bpow( (p -k +i), (n-2k) ), where p is M. \n\nWait, the code's last term is bpow( (p -k +i), (n-2k) ), which is (M -k +i)^{n-2k} \n\nWait, but M -k +i is the number of colors remaining after choosing the colors for the pairs? \n\nWait, the total colors used by the pairs is (k -i) (for the one-color pairs) plus 2i (for the two-color pairs) \u2192 total is k -i + 2i = k +i. \n\nSo the remaining colors are M - (k +i). \n\nBut the exponent is (n-2k), which is the number of remaining lamps. \n\nSo the remaining lamps can choose any of the remaining colors, so (M - (k +i))^{n-2k} \n\nSo the code's last term is correct. \n\nPutting it all together, the code's ans for each i is: \n\nC(k, i) * [ ( (M - (k-i))*(M - (k-i) -1) )^i ] * (M! / ( (M - (k-i))! )) * ( (M -k -i) )^{n-2k} \n\nWait, but the term (M - (k-i)) is M -k +i. \n\nWait, the term (M - (k-i)) is the number of colors available for the one-color pairs. \n\nHmm, but the first term (M - (k-i))*(M - (k-i) -1) is the number of ways to choose two colors for a single pair, assuming that there are (M - (k-i)) colors available. \n\nBut for the i pairs choosing two colors, the first pair has (M - (k-i)) choose 2 options, the next has (M - (k-i) - 2) choose 2, etc. \n\nThis would be a product, but the code is using an exponentiation, which suggests that it's assuming independence, which is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the code might be incorrect, but perhaps there's a combinatorial identity that allows this approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the fact that the terms can be approximated as (M choose 2)^i multiplied by some other terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nThe code's first term after the binomial is ( (M - (k-i))*(M - (k-i) -1) )^i \n\nThis is ( (M - (k-i)) * (M - (k-i) -1) )^i \n\nWhich is the same as ( (M - (k-i) choose 2) * 2 )^i \n\nBut perhaps this is the number of ways to choose two colors for each of the i pairs, assuming that the colors are chosen with replacement, which is not correct. \n\nHmm, this is getting too time-consuming. \n\nPerhaps I should look at the code's structure and see what needs to be filled in. \n\nLooking back at program1.py's code: \n\nThe first missing part is in the bpow function. \n\nThe bpow function is supposed to compute a^n mod p. \n\nThe code has: \n\ndef bpow(a,n,p):\n    res = 1\n    while n:\n        if n%2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            a = (a*a)%p\n            n//=2\n    return res\n\nThe missing part is when n is odd. \n\nIn the standard exponentiation by squaring, when n is odd, you multiply res by a, then subtract 1 from n. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nif n%2:\n    res = (res * a) % p\n    n -=1 \n\nWait, but the code's loop is while n: \n\nSo the correct code for the bpow function is: \n\ndef bpow(a,n,p):\n    res = 1\n    while n:\n        if n % 2:\n            res = (res * a) % p\n        a = (a * a) % p\n        n = n // 2\n    return res\n\nWait, no. The standard implementation is: \n\ndef bpow(a, n, p):\n    res = 1\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % p\n        a = (a * a) % p\n        n = n // 2\n    return res\n\nSo the missing part is the code inside the if n%2 block. \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nif n%2:\n    # TODO: Your code here\nelse:\n    a = (a*a)%p\n    n//=2\n\nSo the missing code is res = (res * a) % p \n\nSo the line inside the if block should be res = (res * a) % p \n\nThen, after that, the code proceeds to square a and halve n. \n\nSo the missing code for program1.py's bpow function is res = (res * a) % p \n\nNow, looking at program2.py: \n\nThe code is supposed to compute for each vertex i in a tree with n vertices (n is odd), the number of trees where i is the centroid. \n\nThe code has a function modmul which is incomplete. \n\nThe modmul function is supposed to multiply two numbers modulo MOD, possibly with an addition. \n\nThe code's modmul is defined as: \n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe function is supposed to return (x*y + c) mod MOD. \n\nBecause in the code's later parts, like fact = [modmul(i, fact[i-1])], which would compute i * fact[i-1], mod MOD. \n\nSimilarly, in the line frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i)), it's multiplying two terms. \n\nThe modmul function is likely supposed to compute (x * y + c) mod MOD. \n\nSo the code for modmul should be: \n\ndef modmul(x, y, c=0):\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py's modmul is returning that value. \n\nSo putting it all together: \n\nFor program1.py, the missing code in bpow is res = (res * a) % p \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code in modmul is returning (x*y +c) mod MOD. \n\nThus, the JSON should have these two parts filled in. \n\nNow, checking the output format: \n\nThe user wants the missing code as strings in JSON, with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". \n\nFor program1's missing part: \n\nThe code inside the if n%2 block is: \n\nres = (res * a) % p \n\nSo the missing line is res = (res * a) % p \n\nFor program2's missing part: \n\nThe modmul function should return (x*y + c) % MOD \n\nSo the code is return (x * y + c) % MOD \n\nThus, the JSON should be: \n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"res = (res * a) % p\",\n  \"program2\": \"return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}"
