    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve these two programming problems. Let's start with the first one, program1.py. The problem is to reconstruct the original binary array A given the sum array C. \n\nHmm, the description says that each B_k is the array where the first k elements are sorted in non-decreasing order. Then C is the sum of all these B arrays. The task is to find A such that when you compute all the B_k's and sum them, you get C.\n\nLet me think about how the B arrays are formed. For each k from 1 to n, B_k is the array where the first k elements are sorted. So for each position i in A, how does it contribute to the sum C[i]?\n\nWait, for position i (0-based?), the element A[i] will be part of all B_k where k >= i+1 (since when k is at least i+1, the first k elements include A[i], and when sorted, its position might change). But since the first k elements are sorted, the value of A[i] in B_k depends on its rank among the first k elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to model this. Let me think of the contribution of each A's element to the sum C. \n\nSuppose A is [a1, a2, ..., an]. For each position j in the array, the value a_j contributes to C[i] in some way. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how often a_j is 1 in the B_k arrays. \n\nEach B_k is the first k elements sorted. So for each position in the array, the value in B_k at position m (0-based?) is the m-th smallest element in the first k elements of A. \n\nWait, the problem says that the first k elements are sorted in non-decreasing order. So for B_k, the first k elements are sorted, and the rest are as in A. Wait no, no, the rest are not part of the first k, so they remain as in A? Wait no, the problem says \"the first k elements of A are sorted in non-decreasing order\". So the rest of the elements (from k+1 to n) remain as in A. Wait, no, the entire array B is formed by taking the first k elements of A, sorting them, and then appending the remaining elements as they are. \n\nWait the example given in the problem: \n\nOriginal A is [0,1,1,0,0,1,0]. Then f(4,A) sorts the first 4 elements. The first four elements are [0,1,1,0], which when sorted becomes [0,0,1,1]. So the resulting B is [0,0,1,1,0,1,0]. \n\nSo the first k elements are sorted, and the rest are kept as in A. \n\nTherefore, for each B_k, the first k elements are sorted, and the rest are the same as in A. \n\nThe sum C is the sum over all B_1 to B_n of each element. \n\nThe problem is to find A given C. \n\nHmm, how can we reverse-engineer A from C?\n\nLet me think of the process for each position i in A. Let's consider the contribution of A[i] to each B_k. \n\nFor each B_k where k >= i+1 (since the first k elements include A[i]), the value of A[i] in B_k is part of the first k elements, which are sorted. So in B_k, the element at position m (0-based?) in the first k elements is the m-th smallest element among the first k elements of A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the sum C in terms of the sorted prefixes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to reconstruct A by considering the cumulative contributions. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let's consider the array A as a binary array (0 or 1). The sum C[i] is the sum over all B_k's of the value at position i. \n\nEach B_k's value at position i is 1 if, in the first k elements (sorted), the element at position i is 1. \n\nWait, but for positions beyond k, the value is the same as in A. Wait, no. For B_k, the first k elements are sorted, and the rest are as in A. So for position i where i < k, the value in B_k[i] is the (i+1)th smallest element in the first k elements of A. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the contribution of each A's element to the sum. \n\nSuppose A has m 1's. Then, for each position i in A, the number of times A[i] is included in the sorted first k elements as a 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the sum C can be represented in terms of the number of times each element is in the first k elements and is among the first m elements when sorted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the positions where the 1's are placed in A. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of the array A as a binary array. Let's denote the positions of the 1's in A as indices x_1, x_2, ..., x_m (sorted in increasing order). \n\nFor each B_k, the first k elements are sorted. So the first k elements in B_k will have all the 1's in the first k elements of A placed as far to the right as possible? Wait no, sorted in non-decreasing order, so 0's first, then 1's. \n\nWait, since the elements are 0 and 1, the sorted first k elements will have all the 0's first, then the 1's. So in B_k's first k elements, the first (number of 0's in first k elements) positions are 0, and the rest are 1. \n\nTherefore, for each position i in the array, the value in B_k at position i (if i <k) is 0 if the number of 0's in the first k elements of A is greater than i, else 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps this can be rephrased. Let me think of the number of 1's in the first k elements of A. Let's denote this as cnt_1(k). Then, in B_k's first k elements, the first (k - cnt_1(k)) elements are 0, and the rest are 1. \n\nTherefore, for each position i in the array (0-based?), the value in B_k at position i (if i <k) is 1 if i >= (k - cnt_1(k)), else 0. \n\nWait, let me see. Suppose in the first k elements of A, there are c 1's. Then, when sorted, the first (k - c) elements are 0, and the next c are 1. So for position i (0-based) in the first k elements, the value is 1 if i >= (k - c). \n\nTherefore, for each position i in the array, the contribution to C[i] is the sum over all k from (i+1) to n (since for k < i+1, the position i is not in the first k elements, so B_k's i-th element is the same as A's i-th element?), wait no. Wait, the first k elements are sorted, but the rest are as in A. Wait, the position i is part of the first k elements only when k > i. \n\nWait, the position i (0-based) is in the first k elements only when k > i. So for B_k, the value at position i is part of the sorted first k elements only when k > i. \n\nWait, let me clarify indices. Let's say the array is 0-based. For B_k, the first k elements are sorted. So for position i (0-based) in the array:\n\n- If i < k: the value is part of the sorted first k elements. \n\n- Else: the value is the same as in A. \n\nTherefore, the value at position i in B_k is:\n\nIf i <k: \n\nthe value is 0 or 1, depending on the sorted first k elements. \n\nElse: it's A[i]. \n\nTherefore, the total contribution to C[i] is the sum over all k from 1 to n of the value at position i in B_k. \n\nBreaking this down:\n\nFor each position i, the contribution comes from two parts:\n\n1. When k ranges from 1 to i: in these cases, the position i is not part of the first k elements (since k <=i, so i is not in first k elements). So the value at position i in B_k is A[i]. \n\nWait, no. Wait, if k is exactly i+1, then the first k elements include position i. Wait, for example, if k is i+1, then the first k elements include up to index i. \n\nWait, let me think again. For a given i (0-based), the position i is part of the first k elements when k > i. So for k from 1 to i, the first k elements do not include position i. So for those k, the value at position i in B_k is the same as in A. \n\nFor k from i+1 to n, the position i is part of the first k elements, so its value in B_k is determined by the sorted first k elements. \n\nTherefore, the total contribution to C[i] is:\n\nsum_{k=1 to i} A[i] (since for those k, the value is A[i]) \n\nplus \n\nsum_{k=i+1 to n} (value in B_k's position i, which is part of the sorted first k elements). \n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the sum C can be expressed in terms of the positions of the 1's in A. \n\nLet me think of the problem in reverse. Suppose I have to find A such that when I compute all B_k's and sum them, I get C. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let's process the array from the end. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let me think of the array A as a binary array. Let me denote the positions where A has 1's as x_1, x_2, ..., x_m. \n\nThe sum C[i] is the number of times the position i is 1 in all B_k arrays. \n\nFor each position i, the contribution from the cases where k <=i is A[i] multiplied by the number of k from 1 to i (so i terms). \n\nThen, for k from i+1 to n, the contribution depends on whether in the first k elements of A, the i-th position is part of the 1's in the sorted array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that for each position i, the total contribution from the sorted parts (k>i) can be determined based on how many times the i-th element is a 1 in the sorted first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the sum C[i] must equal the number of times the element at position i is 1 in all the B arrays. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let me consider the array A as a binary array. Let me think of the sum C as the sum over all B_k's. \n\nEach B_k's first k elements are sorted. So for each position i in the array, the value in B_k[i] is 1 if, in the first k elements of A, there are at least (i+1) 1's? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose in the first k elements of A, there are c 1's. Then, the first (k - c) elements in the sorted first k elements are 0, and the remaining c are 1. So for position i (0-based) in the first k elements (i <k), the value is 1 if i >= (k - c). \n\nSo the value is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is greater than (k - (i+1)), which is equivalent to c > (k - (i+1)), so c >= (k - i). \n\nWait, let me see. The position i in the first k elements is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1). Because the first (k - c) elements are 0, so the 1's start at position (k - c). So for position i to be 1, i must be >= (k - c). \n\nRearranged, c >= (k - i). \n\nSo the value at position i in B_k (when i <k) is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements of A is at least (k - i). \n\nHmm, this might be a way to model it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for each position i, the total contribution to C[i] is:\n\nA[i] * (number of k where k <=i) \n\nplus \n\nthe number of k >i such that in the first k elements of A, the number of 1's is at least (k -i). \n\nWait, because for those k, the position i is part of the first k elements, and the value is 1 if the number of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i). \n\nHmm, but how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the sum C can be expressed in terms of the cumulative counts of 1's. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let me denote the array A as a binary array. Let me denote the prefix sum array of A as S, where S[k] is the number of 1's in the first k elements (for k from 0 to n). \n\nThen, for each position i, the contribution from the cases where k <=i is A[i] * i (since for each k from 1 to i, the value at position i is A[i], so total contribution is A[i] * i). \n\nWait, no. Wait, for k from 1 to i, the position i is not part of the first k elements (since k <=i, so the first k elements are up to index k-1). Wait, no, if k is exactly i+1, then the first k elements include up to index i. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the indices. \n\nWait, let me reindex everything to 1-based for clarity. Let me assume the array is 1-based. \n\nSo for position i (1-based), the first k elements include position i only when k >=i. \n\nTherefore, for k from 1 to i-1: the position i is not part of the first k elements, so the value in B_k's position i is A[i]. \n\nFor k from i to n: the position i is part of the first k elements, so its value in B_k is determined by the sorted first k elements. \n\nTherefore, the total contribution to C[i] is:\n\nsum_{k=1 to i-1} A[i] (there are (i-1) terms) \n\nplus \n\nsum_{k=i to n} (value in B_k's position i). \n\nThe first part is A[i] * (i-1). \n\nThe second part is the number of k from i to n where, in the first k elements of A, the number of 1's is at least (k - (i)). \n\nWait, because in the first k elements, the number of 1's is S[k], so the condition is S[k] >= (k - (i) +1)? Wait, let me re-calculate. \n\nWait, in the first k elements (1-based up to k), the sorted array has the first (k - S[k]) elements as 0, then the rest as 1. \n\nThe position i (1-based) in the first k elements (since k >=i) is at position i. \n\nThe value is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i) (since the first (k - S[k]) elements are 0, so the 1's start at position (k - S[k] +1). So for position i to be 1, i must be >= (k - S[k] +1). \n\nRearranged, S[k] >= (k - i +1). \n\nSo the condition is S[k] >= (k -i +1). \n\nTherefore, the value at position i in B_k is 1 if S[k] >= (k -i +1). \n\nTherefore, the second part of the contribution is the number of k in [i, n] where S[k] >= (k -i +1). \n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a greedy approach. Let me think of the problem in terms of reconstructing A. \n\nThe problem requires that given C, find A. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let me process the array from the end. \n\nSuppose I start with the last element. \n\nThe last element (position n) can only be part of the first k elements when k >=n. So for k =n, the first n elements are sorted. \n\nThe contribution to C[n] is: \n\nThe first part (k from 1 to n-1): since the position n is not part of the first k elements (since k <n), so the value is A[n]. So the first part is A[n]*(n-1). \n\nThe second part is for k =n. The value in B_n's position n is A[n], since the first n elements are sorted, but the position n is part of the first n elements. Wait, no. Wait, in B_n, the first n elements are sorted. The position n is part of the first n elements. So the value at position n in B_n is the nth element of the sorted first n elements. \n\nWait, in the first n elements (the entire array), when sorted, the nth element (since 1-based) is the last element, which is 1 if there are any 1's. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach inspired by the sample input. \n\nIn the sample input, the given C is [0,2,2,4]. The correct A is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nWait, let's see how the C is built. \n\nFor each B_k:\n\nB_1: first 1 elements sorted. So [0], then the rest are as in A. So B_1 is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nB_2: first 2 elements sorted. The first two elements are [0,1], sorted as [0,1]. So B_2 is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nB_3: first 3 elements [0,1,0] sorted becomes [0,0,1]. So B_3 is [0,0,1,1]. \n\nB_4: first 4 elements sorted to [0,0,1,1]. \n\nThe sum C is adding all these B arrays. \n\nNow, the problem is to reverse this. \n\nAnother sample: the note says that for A = [1,1,0,1], the C is [2,4,2,4]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to note that the sum C[i] is equal to the number of times the element at position i is 1 in all the B arrays. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let me consider the array A as a binary array. Let me denote the prefix sums S[k] as the number of 1's in the first k elements. \n\nThen, for each position i (1-based), the contribution to C[i] is:\n\nA[i] * (i-1) (from the first part where k <i) \n\nplus \n\nthe number of k >=i such that S[k] >= (k -i +1). \n\nSo the total C[i] = A[i]*(i-1) + count(k >=i where S[k] >= (k -i +1)). \n\nHmm, but how can we reverse this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the sum C must be such that for each position i, the value C[i] must be equal to the number of times the element at i is 1 in all B arrays. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let me process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nSuppose I start with the last element. \n\nThe last element (position n) can only be part of the first k elements when k >=n. \n\nFor k =n, the first n elements are sorted. The value at position n in B_n is the nth element of the sorted array. Since the first n elements are the entire array, when sorted, the nth element is 1 if there are any 1's. \n\nWait, but the value at position n in B_n is the nth element of the sorted first n elements. Since the first n elements are the entire array, the sorted array's nth element is the maximum of the first n elements. Since the elements are 0 and 1, the maximum is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the first n elements. \n\nWait, but the entire array's first n elements are the array itself. So the nth element in the sorted array is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the array. \n\nHmm, but this might not help. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following idea. Let me consider that the sum C can be represented in terms of the positions of the 1's in A. \n\nSuppose that the array A has m 1's. Let me denote the positions of the 1's as x_1 < x_2 < ... <x_m. \n\nThen, for each position i, the contribution to C[i] is:\n\nA[i] * (i-1) (from the first part) \n\nplus \n\nthe number of k >=i such that the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i +1). \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the sum C[i] must be equal to the number of k where the first k elements contain enough 1's to have the i-th position in the sorted array be 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the array A as a binary array. Let me process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me denote the current count of 1's encountered so far as cnt. \n\nWe can start from the end and decide whether to set A[i] to 1 or 0. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some greedy algorithms. \n\nLet me think of the following steps. \n\nInitialize an array A of all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i from 0 to n-1 (assuming 0-based), we can decide whether to set A[i] to 0. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach. \n\nThe sum C[i] is the number of times the element at position i is 1 in all B arrays. \n\nSuppose I want to find A such that for each i, the total is C[i]. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe contribution of A[i] to C[i] is A[i] multiplied by the number of B arrays where the position i is not part of the first k elements (i.e., k <i+1). \n\nWait, in 0-based indices, for position i, the first part (k from 1 to i) contributes A[i] * i (since there are i values of k where k <=i). \n\nThe second part is the number of k from i+1 to n where the first k elements have enough 1's so that in the sorted first k elements, the i-th position is 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me consider that for each position i, the total contribution from the second part (k>i) is C[i] - A[i] * i. \n\nLet me denote this as S[i] = C[i] - A[i] * i. \n\nThen, S[i] must equal the number of k in [i+1, n] where the first k elements have at least (k -i) 1's. \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the sum C must satisfy certain conditions. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. \n\nLet me process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me denote the current number of 1's in the first k elements as S. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me start with the array A initialized to all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i from n down to 1 (1-based), we can decide whether to set A[i] to 0. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the sample. \n\nSuppose that the sum C[i] must be at least the number of times the element is 1 in the first part (A[i] * (i-1)). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach. \n\nLet me consider that the sum C[i] must be equal to the number of times the element at position i is 1 in all B arrays. \n\nSuppose I process the array from the end. \n\nLet me denote the current count of 1's in the first k elements as S. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me start with the array A as all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i from n down to 1, we can decide whether to set A[i] to 0. \n\nWait, but how to track the required conditions. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe total contribution to C[i] from the first part (k <i) is A[i] * (i-1). \n\nThe remaining contribution (C[i] - A[i]*(i-1)) must be equal to the number of k >=i where the first k elements have enough 1's so that the i-th position in the sorted first k elements is 1. \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the second part (the contribution from k >=i) can be expressed as the number of k where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i +1). \n\nWait, let me re-derive this. \n\nThe condition for the value at position i (1-based) in B_k (k >=i) to be 1 is that the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i). Because the first (k - S[k]) elements are 0, so the 1's start at position (k - S[k] +1). \n\nWait, the position i in the first k elements (since k >=i) is at position i. \n\nThe value is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i). \n\nWait, because the first (k - S[k]) elements are 0, so the 1's start at position (k - S[k] +1). \n\nSo for position i to be 1, we need that (k - S[k] +1) <=i. \n\nRearranged, S[k] >= (k -i +1). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the condition is S[k] >= (k -i +1). \n\nTherefore, the second part of the contribution is the number of k in [i, n] where S[k] >= (k -i +1). \n\nHmm, but how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required S array. \n\nLet me denote S[k] as the number of 1's in the first k elements. \n\nThen, for each i, the total contribution to C[i] is: \n\nA[i]*(i-1) + sum_{k=i}^n [S[k] >= (k -i +1)]. \n\nWe need to find an array A (binary) such that this holds for all i. \n\nHmm, but how to reverse-engineer this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me start with the last element. \n\nFor position n (1-based), the contribution from the first part is A[n]*(n-1). \n\nThe second part is the number of k from n to n (only k=n) where S[n] >= (n -n +1) \u2192 S[n] >=1. \n\nSo the second part is 1 if S[n] >=1, else 0. \n\nBut S[n] is the total number of 1's in the array. \n\nSo the total C[n] = A[n]*(n-1) + (1 if S[n] >=1 else 0). \n\nHmm, but this seems difficult. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the following steps. \n\nInitialize an array A of all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i from 1 to n (1-based), we can decide whether to set A[i] to 0. \n\nWait, but how to track the required conditions. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the sample. \n\nSuppose that the sum C[i] must be at least the number of times the element is 1 in the first part (A[i]*(i-1)). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach. \n\nLet me consider that the sum C[i] must be equal to the number of times the element is 1 in all B arrays. \n\nSuppose I process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me denote the current number of 1's in the first k elements as S. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me start with the array A as all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i from n down to 1, we can decide whether to set A[i] to 0. \n\nThe idea is that setting A[i] to 0 will reduce the contribution to C[i] and also affect the contributions to other positions. \n\nHmm, but this might be too vague. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note. \n\nThe sample input's solution has A as [0,1,0,1]. \n\nThe C array is [0,2,2,4]. \n\nLooking at the first element (0-based index 0), the contribution from the first part (k=1) is A[0] * 0 (since i=0, so i-1 =-1? Wait, perhaps I need to reindex. \n\nWait, let me think in 1-based indices. \n\nFor position 1 (i=1), the first part is A[1]*(1-1) =0. \n\nThe second part is the number of k >=1 where S[k] >= (k -1 +1) \u2192 S[k] >=k. \n\nWait, S[k] is the number of 1's in first k elements. \n\nSo S[k] >=k \u2192 all elements in first k are 1. \n\nSo for the second part, the count is the number of k where all first k elements are 1. \n\nHmm, but in the sample, for position 1 (i=1), the second part is the count of k where S[k] >=k. \n\nIn the sample's A array, the first element is 0. So for k=1, S[1] =0 <1 \u2192 no. \n\nFor k=2, S[2] =1 <2 \u2192 no. \n\nk=3: S[3] =1 <3 \u2192 no. \n\nk=4: S[4]=2 <4 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the second part is 0. \n\nThus, the total C[1] is 0 (from first part) +0 \u2192 0. But in the sample, C[1] is 0. \n\nHmm, but in the sample's C array, the first element is 0. \n\nWait, perhaps this approach is correct. \n\nBut how to use this to reconstruct A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the following steps. \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me denote the current number of 1's in the first k elements as S. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me denote the current number of 1's in the first i elements as S[i]. \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me start with the last element. \n\nSuppose I have to decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me denote the required number of 1's in the first k elements as needed. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's solution. \n\nThe key insight is that the sum C can be used to determine the positions of the 1's in A. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. \n\nThe array A can be determined by the following steps: \n\nInitialize an array A of all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i from 0 to n-1 (0-based), we can decide whether to set A[i] to 0. \n\nThe decision is based on the current C[i] and the contributions from previous steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the following steps. \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me denote the current number of 1's in the first k elements as S. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me denote the current number of 1's in the
