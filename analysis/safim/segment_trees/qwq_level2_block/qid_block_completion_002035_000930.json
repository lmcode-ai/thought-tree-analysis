But the third test case's note says that there exists a permutation where f(b) is 3, which is less than the original's 5. So that contradicts the idea that f(b) is the maximum. So my assumption is wrong. Hmm, so I need to find the correct way to compute f(a). Let me think of another approach. Let's think of the operations as layers. Each operation can be thought of as covering a range. To reach zero, each element a_i must be covered exactly a_i times.",

For example, in the first example, the sum is 2+3+5+4 =14. But the minimal steps are 5. So that's way less than the sum. So the sum is not the answer. Hmm, so I need to find another way to compute f(a).",

The maximum is 5. The differences between consecutive elements are 1,1,1. Summing those gives 3, so total would be 5+3=8? No, that doesn't align with the example's 5.

So the original array must have elements that can be rearranged into [2,3,3,1], but in its original arrangement, it requires more steps. Ah! So the original array's elements are the same as the permutation's, but arranged in a different order. So the minimal steps depend on the arrangement of the elements. So the minimal steps are not just the maximum, but depend on the arrangement. So the problem is to find whether the given array's arrangement is such that its f(a) is the minimal possible among all permutations. So the key is to find what arrangement of the array minimizes f(a), and then check if the given array is in that arrangement. Now, the question is: what arrangement of the array minimizes f(a)?

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nfor each test case string s:\n\n    parts = s.split('W') non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n\n    if len(non_empty) > 1:\n\n        invalid \u2192 output NO\n\n    else if len(non_empty) ==0:\n\n        valid \u2192 output YES\n\n    else:\n\n        check if the single non_empty part is a valid alternating sequence of R and B. \n\n        if yes \u2192 valid, else \u2192 invalid.

So the code can be structured as follows:\n\nfor s in ...:\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n\n    if len(non_empty) > 1:\n\n        b = 1 \u2192 invalid\n\n    else:\n\n        if non_empty:\n\n            p = non_empty[0]\n\n            # check if p is valid alternating sequence\n\n            valid = True\n\n            for i in range(1, len(p)):\n\n                if p[i] == p[i-1]:\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                b =1\n\n        else:\n\n            # all W \u2192 valid\n\n            b=0\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2]) Wait, but the code in the problem's template uses a loop over the parts.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to determine if for all permutations of the array a, the minimum number of operations f(a) is less than or equal to f(b) for any permutation b. The operation allowed is selecting a range and decreasing each element by 1. The key here is to figure out what f(a) represents and under what conditions the original array's f(a) is minimal among all permutations.\n\nHmm, the note mentions that f(a) is the minimum number of operations. Let's think about how f(a) is calculated. Each operation can decrease a contiguous subarray by 1. To reach all zeros, the minimal steps would be the sum of the elements minus something? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the minimal number of operations required is equal to the sum of the elements. Because each operation can decrease a range by 1, but each element must be decreased exactly its value times. However, overlapping operations can cover multiple elements. Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is actually the sum of the elements, but that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number of operations is determined by the way the elements are arranged. For example, if the array is non-decreasing, then the number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of overlapping ranges? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of some partition? Or maybe it's the maximum element? Wait, no. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the first test case example given: [2,3,5,4]. The note says f(a) is 5. Let's see: How do you get to zero in 5 steps? Let's see:\n\nEach operation is a range. Let's think of the operations as layers. The maximum element here is 5. So maybe the minimal steps are the maximum element? Because each step can cover the entire array, but you can't do that. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum element is 5, so you need at least 5 steps. But in the example, it's exactly 5. So maybe the minimal number of operations is indeed the maximum element. Because each step can cover the entire array, but you can't do that unless all elements are at least 1. Wait, but in the example, the maximum is 5, and the answer is 5. So that's possible. Let me check another example.\n\nThe third test case's note says that the original array requires 5 operations, but a permutation [2,3,3,1] requires 3. Wait, so the maximum in that permutation is 3, so that would fit. So the minimal f(b) is the maximum of the array. So the problem reduces to: is the maximum element of the original array equal to the maximum of all permutations? But since permutations have the same elements, the maximum is the same. Wait, that can't be. Wait, the problem is to check whether for all permutations b of a, f(a) \u2264 f(b). But if f(b) is the maximum of b, then since all permutations have the same maximum as a, then f(a) would equal f(b) for all permutations. So the answer would always be YES. But the sample input's third test case says that there exists a permutation where f(b) is 3, but the original array's maximum is 5? Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the third test case's note says that the original array needs 5 operations, but a permutation [2,3,3,1] requires 3. Wait, the maximum of that permutation is 3, so according to my previous thought, f(b) would be 3, which is less than 5. So that would mean that the original array's f(a) is 5, but there exists a permutation where f(b) is 3, so the answer would be NO. Which aligns with the problem's note. So my previous assumption that f(a) is the maximum is wrong.\n\nHmm, so I need to find what f(a) actually is. Let me think again. Let's think of the operations as covering ranges. Each operation can decrease a contiguous segment by 1. To reach all zeros, the minimal steps required would be the sum of the elements minus the sum of the overlaps? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in some sorted way. Wait, maybe the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of overlapping ranges? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. Wait, maybe the minimal steps are determined by the way the elements are arranged. Let me think of the example given in the note for the third test case. The original array must have a higher f(a) than the permutation. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the original array is [5, 3, 2, 1]. The permutation [2,3,3,1] has elements 2,3,3,1. The maximum is 3, but the f(b) is 3. So how does that work?\n\nWait, let's think of the operations. For the permutation [2,3,3,1], the maximum is 3. So perhaps the minimal steps are indeed the maximum. But in the original array, the maximum is 5, so f(a) would be 5, which matches the note. So why in the third test case's note, the original array's f(a) is 5, but the permutation's f(b) is 3? Wait, that permutation's maximum is 3, so f(b) would be 3, which is less than 5. So the original array's f(a) is 5, which is larger than some permutation's f(b). Therefore, the problem's condition (that for all permutations, f(a) \u2264 f(b)) would be false, so the answer is NO. Which aligns with the note.\n\nSo the key is that f(a) is the maximum element. Wait, but then the problem reduces to checking whether the original array's maximum is the maximum possible among all permutations, which it always is. So that can't be. Wait, but the problem's question is whether for all permutations b of a, f(a) \u2264 f(b). So if f(b) is the maximum of b, then since all permutations have the same maximum as a, then f(a) would equal f(b) for all permutations, so the answer would always be YES. But the third test case's note says that there exists a permutation where f(b) is 3, which is less than the original's 5. So that contradicts the idea that f(b) is the maximum. So my assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the correct way to compute f(a). Let me think of another approach. Let's think of the operations as layers. Each operation can be thought of as covering a range. To reach zero, each element a_i must be covered exactly a_i times. The minimal number of operations is the minimal number of ranges such that each element is covered exactly a_i times. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the overlaps. Wait, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of overlapping ranges. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the problem of painting a histogram with vertical lines. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when sorted in non-decreasing order. Wait, maybe the minimal steps are the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a certain way. Let me think of the example given in the note.\n\nTake the first test case: [2,3,5,4]. The maximum is 5. The note says f(a) is 5. So that aligns with the maximum. The third test case's permutation [2,3,3,1] has maximum 3, so f(b) is 3. So that would fit. But then why in the third test case's original array, the maximum is higher than that permutation's maximum? Wait, the original array must have a higher maximum. Wait, the note says that the original array requires 5 operations, but the permutation requires 3. So the original array's maximum must be 5, and the permutation's maximum is 3. But that's impossible because permutations have the same elements. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the example. Let me re-read the note.\n\nThe note says: \"In the third test case, we need 5 operations to change all elements to 0, while [2,3,3,1] only needs 3 operations.\" So the original array must have elements that sum to 5+3+3+1? Wait, no. Wait, the original array's elements must be the same as the permutation's. Wait, the permutation is of the original array. So the original array must have the same elements as the permutation. So the permutation [2,3,3,1] must be a permutation of the original array. Therefore, the original array must have elements 2,3,3,1. Wait, but then the maximum is 3, so f(a) would be 3, but the note says the original array requires 5 operations. That's a contradiction. So my previous assumption is wrong. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-express the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: Determine if for all permutations b of a, f(a) \u2264 f(b) is true. So the original array's f(a) must be less than or equal to every permutation's f(b). So the question is whether the original array's f(a) is the minimal possible among all permutations. So the problem is to check whether the original array is arranged in such a way that its f(a) is the minimal possible over all permutations.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find what arrangement of the array minimizes f(a), and check whether the given array is in that arrangement.\n\nSo first, I need to find what arrangement of the array gives the minimal f(a). Then, check if the given array is in that arrangement.\n\nSo the first step is to find what f(a) is, and how to minimize it.\n\nLet me think of f(a) as the minimal number of operations required. Let's think of each operation as a rectangle covering a range. Each operation can be thought of as a horizontal strip in a histogram. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the heights of the \"peaks\" in the array when arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of overlapping ranges. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the problem of covering the array with intervals such that each element a_i is covered exactly a_i times. The minimal number of intervals needed is the maximum number of overlapping intervals required at any position. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the overlapping ranges. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: the minimal number of operations required is equal to the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of all the ranges chosen. But that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. Wait, let me think of the first example: [2,3,5,4]. The sum is 14. The maximum is 5. So 5 is the minimal steps. The sum minus the maximum would be 14-5=9, which doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of the operations as layers. Each operation can be a horizontal line in a histogram. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when sorted in a non-decreasing way. Wait, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's think of the array as a histogram. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the \"peaks\" between adjacent elements. For example, if the array is non-decreasing, then the minimal steps would be the maximum element. Because you can cover the entire array in the first step for the first element, then extend it for the next, etc. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the example [2,3,5,4]. The maximum is 5. So the minimal steps would be 5. Let's see how that works:\n\nEach operation can be a range that covers the entire array. But you can't do that because each operation can be any range. To reach 5 steps, perhaps each step is the entire array until the maximum is reached. Wait, but the first element is 2, so after 5 steps, it would be 2-5 = negative, which is not allowed. Wait, no. The operations can be applied in any order. Wait, each operation can be applied to any range. So to decrease each element by 1, you can choose the entire array each time. But that would take exactly the maximum element steps. Because for the element with the maximum value (5), you need to apply the operation 5 times. The other elements would be decreased 5 times as well, but their initial values are less than 5, so they would become negative. That's not allowed. Wait, the problem says that you can perform the operations until all elements are zero. So each operation must be applied such that after all operations, the elements are zero. So each element must be decreased exactly its initial value. So the total number of operations must be exactly the sum of the elements? No, that can't be. Because each operation can decrease multiple elements. For example, in the first example, the sum is 2+3+5+4 =14. But the minimal steps are 5. So that's way less than the sum. So the sum is not the answer.\n\nHmm, so I need to find another way to compute f(a).\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: Each operation is a range [l, r], and each such operation contributes a decrease of 1 to each element in that range. The total number of operations is the minimal number of such ranges such that for each element a_i, the number of ranges that include it is exactly a_i.\n\nThe minimal number of ranges needed is the minimal number of such ranges that cover each position exactly a_i times.\n\nThis is equivalent to covering the array with ranges such that each position i is covered exactly a_i times, and the total number of ranges is minimized.\n\nThis problem is similar to the problem of covering a histogram with horizontal lines. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is sorted in a non-decreasing way. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. Or maybe it's the sum of the \"peaks\".\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem of painting a histogram with the minimal number of horizontal lines. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a non-decreasing order. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let the elements be a_1 \u2264 a_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 a_n. Then the minimal number of operations would be a_n (the maximum) plus the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n where a_i > a_{i-1}? Not sure. Wait, let's see the first example sorted: [2,3,4,5]. The maximum is 5. The differences between consecutive elements are 1,1,1. Summing those gives 3, so total would be 5+3=8? No, that doesn't align with the example's 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal number of operations is simply the maximum element. Because in the first example, the maximum is 5 and the answer is 5. The third test case's permutation has maximum 3, so f(b) is 3. So that would fit. But why in the third test case's original array, the maximum is 5, but the permutation's maximum is 3? That can't be, since permutations have the same elements. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the third test case's example. Let me re-read the note.\n\nThe note says: \"In the third test case, we need 5 operations to change all elements to 0, while [2,3,3,1] only needs 3 operations.\" So the original array must have elements that sum to 5+3+3+1? Wait, no. The original array must be a permutation of [2,3,3,1], so the maximum is 3. But then why does the original array require 5 operations? That contradicts the idea that f(a) is the maximum. So my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, so I must be missing something here. Let me think of the third test case's example. Suppose the original array is [3,3,2,1]. The maximum is 3, so according to the previous idea, f(a) would be 3. But the note says it requires 5 operations. So that's not possible. So the initial idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the operations as layers. Each operation can be represented as a range. The total number of operations is the minimal number of ranges such that each element a_i is covered exactly a_i times. \n\nThis is equivalent to covering the array with ranges such that each position i is covered exactly a_i times, and the total number of ranges is minimized. \n\nThe minimal number of ranges needed is equal to the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of all overlapping ranges. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. Let me see:\n\nTake the first example [2,3,5,4]. The sum is 14. The non-decreasing arrangement is [2,3,4,5]. The minimums would be 2, 3,4,5. The sum of the minimums is 2+3+4+5=14. So 14-14=0. That doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the problem differently. Let me think of the operations as layers. Each operation is a horizontal line in the histogram. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the \"heights\" of the histogram when viewed as a sequence of increasing steps. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem of the number of operations to reduce a histogram to zero using horizontal lines. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example sorted as [2,3,4,5]. The differences between consecutive elements are 1,1,1. The total would be 3, but the answer is 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum of all the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. Wait, in the first example, the sum is 14. The non-decreasing array's minimums are each element's value. So sum of minimums is 14, so 14-14=0. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-increasing way. Let me see. For the first example arranged as [5,4,3,2], the minimums would be 5,4,3,2. Sum is 14. Again, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the maximum element plus the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the non-decreasing arrangement. Let me see:\n\nFirst example sorted: [2,3,4,5]. The differences between consecutive elements are 1,1,1. Sum is 3. Max is 5. Total 5+3=8, which is not the answer.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the third test case's example. The permutation [2,3,3,1] requires 3 operations. Let's see how that can be done. The maximum is 3. So perhaps the minimal steps are the maximum. But how?\n\nSuppose the array is [2,3,3,1]. The maximum is 3. So three operations. Let's see:\n\nFirst operation: cover the entire array. Each element is decreased by 1. Now the array is [1,2,2,0].\n\nSecond operation: cover the first three elements. Now [0,1,1,0].\n\nThird operation: cover the second and third elements. Now [0,0,0,0]. So yes, three steps. So that works. So the maximum is indeed the minimal steps.\n\nBut the original array in that test case must have a higher maximum. Wait, but the permutation is of the original array. So the original array must have the same elements. So the original array must have a maximum of 3. But the note says that the original array requires 5 steps. So that contradicts. So I must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the original array in the third test case is [5, 3, 2, 1]. The permutation [2,3,3,1] is not a permutation of that array. So that can't be. So maybe the original array is [5, 3, 2, 1], and the permutation is [3,3,2,1]. Wait, but that would require the original array to have a 5 and a 3, but the permutation has two 3's. So that's not possible. So perhaps the original array is [3,3,2,1], and the permutation is [2,3,3,1], which is the same array. So why does the original array require 5 steps? That doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's note. Let me read it again.\n\nThe note says: \"In the third test case, we need 5 operations to change all elements to 0, while [2,3,3,1] only needs 3 operations.\" So the original array must be such that when arranged in some way (the original array's order), it requires 5 steps, but when arranged as [2,3,3,1], it requires 3 steps. So the original array must have elements that can be rearranged into [2,3,3,1], but in its original arrangement, it requires more steps. \n\nAh! So the original array's elements are the same as the permutation's, but arranged in a different order. So the minimal steps depend on the arrangement of the elements. So the minimal steps are not just the maximum, but depend on the arrangement. \n\nSo the problem is to find whether the given array's arrangement is such that its f(a) is the minimal possible among all permutations. \n\nSo the key is to find what arrangement of the array minimizes f(a), and then check if the given array is in that arrangement.\n\nNow, the question is: what arrangement of the array minimizes f(a)?\n\nLet me think of the example where the array is [3,3,2,1]. The maximum is 3, so f(a) would be 3. But the note says that the original array requires 5 steps. So that can't be. So perhaps the arrangement of the array affects the minimal steps. \n\nWait, let's think of the array [5,3,2,1]. The maximum is 5. So f(a) would be 5. But if we arrange it as [2,3,5,4], then the maximum is 5, so f(a) is 5. So that aligns with the first example's note. \n\nThe third test case's note says that the original array requires 5 steps, but a permutation requires 3 steps. So the original array must have a maximum of 5, but the permutation has a maximum of 3. But that's impossible because permutations have the same elements. So I must have misunderstood the example. \n\nWait, perhaps the third test case's original array is [5, 3, 3, 1]. The maximum is 5. The permutation [3,3,2,1] is not a permutation of that array. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps the third test case's original array is [5, 3, 2, 1]. The permutation [2,3,3,1] is not a permutation of that array. So I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third test case's original array is [3,3,2,1], and the permutation is [2,3,3,1], which is the same array. But then why does the original array require 5 steps? That doesn't make sense. \n\nThis suggests that my initial approach is wrong. I need to find another way to compute f(a).\n\nLet me think of the operations as layers. Each operation is a range. To cover each element a_i exactly a_i times. The minimal number of ranges is the minimal number of ranges such that each position i is covered exactly a_i times. \n\nThis is equivalent to covering the array with ranges such that the total coverage for each position is exactly a_i, and the number of ranges is minimized. \n\nThis problem is similar to the problem of covering a histogram with horizontal lines. The minimal number of ranges needed is the sum of the \"peaks\" in the array. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem of the number of operations to reduce a histogram to zero using horizontal lines. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a non-decreasing way. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example [2,3,5,4]. \n\nSorted in non-decreasing order: [2,3,4,5]. The differences between consecutive elements are 1,1,1. The sum is 3. The maximum is 5. So total would be 5 (max) plus 3 (sum of differences) = 8? No, but the note says it's 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the maximum element. Because in the first example, the maximum is 5 and the answer is 5. The third test case's permutation has maximum 3, so f(b) is 3. So that works. \n\nBut why in the third test case's original array, the maximum is 5, but the permutation's maximum is 3? That can't be. So perhaps the third test case's original array has a maximum of 5, but the permutation has a maximum of 3. Which is impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the third test case's original array is [5, 3, 2, 1]. The permutation [2,3,3,1] is not a permutation of that array. So I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third test case's original array is [3,3,2,1], and the permutation is [2,3,3,1], which is the same array. But then why does the original array require 5 steps? That doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the operations differently. Let me think of the example given in the third test case's note. The original array requires 5 steps. Let's say the array is [5, 3, 2, 1]. The maximum is 5. So the minimal steps would be 5. \n\nThe permutation [2,3,3,1] has maximum 3. So f(b) is 3. But that permutation is not a permutation of the original array. So this is impossible. \n\nThis suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem's note. Let me read it again:\n\n\"In the third test case, we need 5 operations to change all elements to 0, while [2,3,3,1] only needs 3 operations.\"\n\nAh! The permutation [2,3,3,1] must be a permutation of the original array. So the original array must have elements 2,3,3,1. The maximum is 3. So why does the original array require 5 steps? That's impossible. \n\nWait, maybe the original array is arranged in a way that the maximum is 3, but the arrangement causes the steps to be higher. \n\nWait, let's take the array [3,1,3,2]. The maximum is 3. Let's see how many steps are needed. \n\nThe maximum is 3. So if we can do it in 3 steps, but maybe the arrangement requires more steps. \n\nWait, let's try to compute f(a) for this array. \n\nThe array is [3,1,3,2]. \n\nWe need to cover each element exactly their value times. \n\nLet's see:\n\nThe first element is 3. So it needs to be covered 3 times. \n\nThe second is 1, so once. \n\nThird is 3, so three times. \n\nFourth is 2, twice. \n\nWe need to find ranges such that each position is covered exactly the required times. \n\nLet me try to find the minimal number of ranges. \n\nOne possible way:\n\nFirst, cover the entire array (positions 1-4) three times. That would give each position 3. But then the second element is over-covered (3 vs needed 1). So that's not allowed. \n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can do the following steps:\n\nStep 1: cover positions 1-4. This covers all four elements once. \n\nStep 2: cover positions 1-3. This adds 1 to each of the first three elements. \n\nStep 3: cover positions 1-3 again. Now first three elements have been covered 3 times (1+1+1). \n\nStep 4: cover positions 3-4. This adds 1 to positions 3 and 4. \n\nStep 5: cover position 4. \n\nWait, let's track each element:\n\nElement 1: steps 1,2,3 \u2192 3 times. \n\nElement 2: steps 1,2 \u2192 2 times. But it needs 1. So this is over. \n\nHmm, this isn't working. \n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me think of the array as [3,1,3,2]. \n\nWe need to cover each element exactly their value. \n\nLet me try to find the minimal number of ranges:\n\nThe first element needs 3. \n\nThe second needs 1. \n\nThird needs 3. \n\nFourth needs 2. \n\nWe can do:\n\nStep 1: cover 1-4 \u2192 all get 1. \n\nStep 2: cover 1-3 \u2192 first three get +1 \u2192 now 2,2,2,1. \n\nStep 3: cover 1-3 again \u2192 3,3,3,1. \n\nStep 4: cover 3-4 \u2192 third gets +1 (now 4?), fourth gets +1 (now 2). \n\nWait, but the third element needs 3. So after step 3, it's 3. So step 4 would overcount. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. \n\nWait, let's try the example [3,1,3,2]. \n\nSorted non-decreasing: [1,2,3,3]. \n\nThe minimums would be 1,2,3,3. Sum is 9. The sum of the elements is 3+1+3+2 =9. So 9-9=0. Not helpful. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the examples. \n\nThe first example's array is [2,3,5,4]. The answer is 5, which is the maximum. \n\nThe third test case's permutation [2,3,3,1] has maximum 3 and requires 3 steps. So that aligns with the maximum. \n\nThe original array in the third test case must have a maximum of 5, but that's impossible because the permutation has maximum 3. So perhaps the original array is [5,3,2,1], and the permutation is [2,3,3,1], which is not a permutation of that array. So I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third test case's original array is [3,3,2,1], and the permutation is the same array. But then why does the original array require 5 steps? That doesn't make sense. \n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption that f(a) is the maximum is correct, but the note's example must have a different setup. \n\nWait, perhaps the third test case's original array is [5, 3, 2, 1]. The maximum is 5. So f(a) is 5. The permutation [2,3,3,1] is not a permutation of this array. So the note must have a different example. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third test case's original array is [3,3,2,1], and the permutation is [2,3,3,1], which is the same array. But then why does the original array require 5 steps? That's impossible. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing a key insight here. Let me think of the problem differently. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-decreasing way. \n\nWait, let's try the first example:\n\nOriginal array [2,3,5,4]. \n\nSorted non-decreasing: [2,3,4,5]. \n\nThe minimums are each element's value. Sum is 14. \n\nSum of elements is 14. So 14-14=0. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a non-increasing way. \n\nFor the first example sorted non-increasing: [5,4,3,2]. \n\nSum of elements is 14. Sum of minimums (each element is the minimum of the first i elements?) Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum of the elements minus the sum of the minimums of the array when arranged in a way that is a \"mountain\" array. \n\nWait, looking back at the code provided for program1.py, there's a function called isMountain(ar). The code currently checks whether the array is a mountain array. \n\nThe solve function calls isMountain(A) and returns \"yes\" if it is. \n\nThe problem's output is \"YES\" if for all permutations b of a, f(a) \u2264 f(b). \n\nSo perhaps the condition is that the array is a mountain array. \n\nA mountain array is one that is first non-decreasing, then non-increasing. \n\nSo the code's current approach is to check if the array is a mountain array, and if so, output \"YES\". \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nThe note says that in the first test case, the array is [2,3,5,4], which is a mountain array (increasing to 5 then decreasing). So the code would return \"YES\". \n\nThe third test case's original array must not be a mountain array, so the code would return \"NO\". \n\nSo the problem's solution is to determine whether the array is a mountain array. \n\nAh! That must be the case. \n\nThe problem's condition is that the array is a mountain array. Because the minimal f(a) is achieved when the array is a mountain array. \n\nSo the code's current approach is correct. \n\nThe function isMountain checks whether the array is a mountain array. \n\nThe problem is to determine whether the given array is a mountain array. \n\nBecause if it is, then any permutation would have a higher or equal f(b). \n\nWait, but why? \n\nThe mountain array's arrangement allows the minimal number of operations. So if the array is a mountain array, then any permutation would have a higher or equal f(b). \n\nThus, the answer is \"YES\" if the array is a mountain array. \n\nSo the code for program1.py is correct except for the part where the solve function is called. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe solve function is called with:\n\ntestcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n\nfor tc in range(testcaseCount):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nassert not tokens\n\nThe current code has a commented out line: print(\"yes\" if isMountain(A) else \"no\")\n\nBut in the current code, the solve function is not properly called. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\n\n    N = nextInt()\n\n    A = getIntArray(N)\n\n    print(\"yes\" if isMountain(A) else \"no\")\n\nBut then, in the main part:\n\nelse:\n\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    assert not tokens\n\nSo the solve function is not being called. The code inside the for loop is missing. \n\nThe missing code in program1.py is to call solve() for each test case. \n\nSo the code inside the for loop should be:\n\nsolve(tc+1)\n\nBut the function solve() doesn't use the test case number. \n\nAlternatively, the code should be:\n\nfor tc in range(testcaseCount):\n\n    solve(tc+1)\n\nBut the current solve function is defined to take a parameter, but in the code above, the solve function is defined with a default parameter. \n\nWait, the solve function is defined as:\n\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\n\n    N = nextInt()\n\n    A = getIntArray(N)\n\n    print(\"yes\" if isMountain(A) else \"no\")\n\nSo when called with solve(tc+1), it would work. \n\nThus, the missing code in program1.py is to call solve(tc+1) inside the for loop. \n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is:\n\nfor tc in range(testcaseCount):\n\n    solve(tc+1)\n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to determine whether a given string can be formed using the stamp, which can be applied to any two neighboring cells, turning them into either RB or BR. Each application can be rotated. \n\nThe stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application changes the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe question is whether the given string can be formed through any number of such operations. \n\nThe initial state is all W. \n\nThe stamp can be applied any number of times, and each application changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is to find whether the string can be formed by such operations. \n\nLet me think of the constraints. \n\nEach application affects two adjacent cells. \n\nThe final string must be such that every non-W character is part of at least one such pair. \n\nMoreover, the sequence must be such that the non-W characters can be covered by overlapping or non-overlapping pairs of R and B in some way. \n\nLet me think of the following observations:\n\n- The string must not have any single R or B that is not part of a pair. \n\nWait, but each stamp application changes two cells. So any R or B must be part of a pair. \n\nWait, no. Because each application can be applied multiple times. For example, applying the stamp to the same pair multiple times can toggle the colors. \n\nWait, each application of the stamp changes the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nWait, the stamp can be rotated, so each application can choose to set the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nBut each application must choose one of the two options. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"stamp can be rotated, i.e. it can be used in both ways: as B R and as R B.\" \n\nSo each application of the stamp on positions i and i+1 can set them to either BR or RB. \n\nBut each application must choose one of the two options. \n\nThe initial state is all W. \n\nEach application changes the two cells to either BR or RB. \n\nThe final string must be achievable through any sequence of such operations. \n\nThe key is to find whether the string can be formed by such operations. \n\nLet me think of the following constraints:\n\n- Every occurrence of R or B must be part of at least one such pair. \n\n- The sequence must allow for overlapping pairs. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe stamp can be applied multiple times to the same pair. \n\nEach application of the stamp on a pair (i, i+1) can toggle their colors between W and the chosen pair. \n\nWait, no. Because each application sets them to either BR or RB, but previous applications may have set them to something else. \n\nWait, each application of the stamp on positions i and i+1 will set them to either BR or RB, regardless of their previous state. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" \n\nSo each application completely sets the two cells to either BR or RB. \n\nSo the order of applications matters. \n\nThis makes it tricky. \n\nAn alternative approach is to model the final string's possible patterns. \n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe final string must satisfy that every non-W character is part of a pair of adjacent R and B (in either order), and the entire string can be covered by such pairs. \n\nWait, but overlapping is allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the string must be such that every R is adjacent to a B or vice versa, except possibly at the ends. \n\nWait, perhaps the following conditions must be met:\n\n- All non-W characters must form a sequence where every R is adjacent to a B and vice versa. \n\n- The non-W parts must form a contiguous block? Or not necessarily. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string can be divided into segments where each segment is a sequence of R and B such that they alternate, and each pair can be formed by the stamp. \n\nWait, perhaps the following is necessary:\n\nThe string must not have two identical non-W characters adjacent to each other. \n\nBecause each stamp application creates either RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W characters must be R and B in some order. \n\nSo the string must have no two Rs or two Bs next to each other. \n\nAdditionally, any non-W character must be part of such a pair. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string must not have two Rs or two Bs adjacent. \n\n2. All non-W characters must form a single contiguous block? Or can there be multiple blocks separated by W? \n\nWait, no. Because the stamp can be applied anywhere. For example, if there are two separate RB pairs separated by W, that's possible. \n\nFor example, the string \"RWB\" can be formed by first applying the stamp to positions 1-2 (RB), then applying to positions 2-3 (BR). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitial: WWW \n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W \n\nThen apply to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B W \u2192 R B W \u2192 applying to 2-3 as BR would set them to B R \u2192 R B R. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the string \"RWB\" can be formed by first applying to positions 1-2 (RB), resulting in R B W. \n\nThen applying to positions 2-3 as BR would set them to B R \u2192 so the string becomes R B R. \n\nNot the desired result. \n\nHmm, perhaps the string \"RWB\" is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, the string \"RWB\" has a W between R and B. So the R and B are not adjacent. So they can't be part of the same stamp application. \n\nThus, the R and B must be adjacent. \n\nSo the string must have all non-W characters form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W characters are R and B in some order. \n\nAdditionally, any W can be anywhere else. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All non-W characters form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W characters are R and B in some order. \n\n- The non-W characters can be in any positions, but they must form such a sequence. \n\nWait, but the non-W parts can be separated by W's. \n\nFor example, the string \"RWB\" has R and B separated by W. So they are not adjacent. Thus, they can't be part of the same stamp application. \n\nThus, the R and B must be in adjacent positions. \n\nSo the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W characters are adjacent and alternate between R and B. \n\nThus, the entire non-W parts must form a single contiguous block where the characters alternate between R and B. \n\nAdditionally, the entire string can have multiple such blocks separated by W's. \n\nWait, but each block must be a sequence of alternating R and B. \n\nFor example, \"RBRWBRB\" is allowed. \n\nBut \"RBRB\" is allowed. \n\nBut \"RR\" is not allowed. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string must not have two identical non-W characters adjacent. \n\n2. All non-W characters must form a sequence of alternating R and B. \n\nAdditionally, the entire string can have W's anywhere else. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck that the string meets the following conditions:\n\n- For every position i where s[i] is not W, the next non-W character (if any) must be the opposite. \n\nWait, but the non-W characters can be separated by W's. \n\nWait, the non-W characters can be in any positions, but whenever two non-W characters are adjacent, they must be R and B in some order. \n\nThus, the string must not have two Rs or two Bs next to each other. \n\nAdditionally, any non-W character must be part of at least one pair. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nFor example, a single R is impossible, because it can't be formed by any stamp application. \n\nBecause each stamp application must set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThus, any single R or B is impossible. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- The string must not contain any single R or B. \n\n- All non-W characters must form pairs of adjacent R and B (in either order), possibly with W's in between. \n\nWait, but the pairs can be separated by W's. \n\nWait, but the stamp can be applied anywhere. \n\nFor example, the string \"RWB\" is possible? \n\nNo, because the R and B are separated by a W. \n\nTo get R at position 1 and B at position 3, you would need to apply the stamp to positions 1-2 (RB), then to positions 2-3 (BR). \n\nThe first application gives R B W. \n\nThe second application on positions 2-3 as BR would set them to B R \u2192 so the string becomes R B R. \n\nNot the desired R W B. \n\nAlternatively, applying the stamp to positions 2-3 as RB would set them to R B \u2192 so the string becomes R W B. \n\nWait, yes! \n\nWait, first apply to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nThen apply to positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 the second and third positions become R B. \n\nSo the string becomes R R B \u2192 which has two Rs adjacent. Not allowed. \n\nHmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, first apply to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nThen apply to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 the second and third become B R \u2192 so the string is R B R. \n\nStill not R W B. \n\nHmm, so getting R W B is not possible. \n\nThus, the string \"RWB\" is not possible. \n\nThus, the non-W characters must form a contiguous block where they alternate between R and B. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n- Within this block, the characters alternate between R and B. \n\n- The block can be of length 0 (all W's), which is allowed (since zero operations). \n\n- The block must have even length? No, because a single pair (length 2) is allowed. \n\nWait, a single pair (length 2) is allowed. \n\nFor example, \"RB\" is allowed. \n\nA block of length 3 would require alternating characters, like RBR or BRB. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\nThe string must satisfy:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n2. Within this block, every two adjacent characters are R and B in some order. \n\n3. The block can be of any length \u22650. \n\nAdditionally, the entire string can have W's outside this block. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck that the non-W characters form a single contiguous block, and within that block, the characters alternate between R and B. \n\nSo steps to implement:\n\n- Find the first and last non-W characters. \n\n- All characters between them must be non-W. \n\n- Check that between first and last, the characters alternate between R and B. \n\n- Also, check that there are no non-W characters outside this range. \n\nAdditionally, if there are no non-W characters, it's allowed (output YES). \n\nSo the code for program2.py needs to implement this. \n\nLooking at the provided code for program2.py:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nHmm, the code is trying to process each test case's string. \n\nThe code reads the input as lines, taking every second line starting from the second (since the first line is the number of test cases). \n\nThe variable 'b' is initialized to 0, and for each part of the string split by \"W\", some processing is done. \n\nThe final print uses 'YNEOS '[b::2], which is a trick to get 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of b. \n\nThe code's current approach is to split the string into parts separated by W's. \n\nEach part is a sequence of non-W characters. \n\nThe problem requires that all non-W characters form a single contiguous block. So the split by W's should result in at most one non-empty part. \n\nThus, if the number of non-empty parts after splitting by W is more than 1, then it's invalid. \n\nAdditionally, each non-W part must alternate between R and B. \n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Check that there is at most one non-empty segment when split by W. \n\n- Check that this segment (if exists) is a valid alternating sequence of R and B. \n\nThus, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nfor each test case string s:\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n\n    if len(non_empty) > 1:\n\n        invalid \u2192 output NO\n\n    else if len(non_empty) ==0:\n\n        valid \u2192 output YES\n\n    else:\n\n        check if the single non_empty part is a valid alternating sequence of R and B. \n\n        if yes \u2192 valid, else \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus, the code needs to implement this. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nWait, the s[:-1] is probably to remove the newline character. \n\nThe loop over the parts (split by W) is needed. \n\nThe variable 'b' is used to track whether the conditions are met. \n\nThe code needs to:\n\n- Check that there is at most one non-empty part. \n\n- Check the validity of the non-empty part. \n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nfor s in ...:\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n\n    if len(non_empty) > 1:\n\n        b = 1 \u2192 invalid\n\n    else:\n\n        if non_empty:\n\n            p = non_empty[0]\n\n            # check if p is valid alternating sequence\n\n            valid = True\n\n            for i in range(1, len(p)):\n\n                if p[i] == p[i-1]:\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                b =1\n\n        else:\n\n            # all W \u2192 valid\n\n            b=0\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nWait, but the code in the problem's template uses a loop over the parts. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfor s in ...:\n\n    valid = True\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n\n    if len(non_empty) >1:\n\n        valid = False\n\n    else:\n\n        if non_empty:\n\n            p = non_empty[0]\n\n            for i in range(1, len(p)):\n\n                if p[i] == p[i-1]:\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut the existing code uses 'b' and the string slicing. \n\nThe existing code's 'b' is initialized to 0. \n\nThe loop over the parts (split by W) is in the code. \n\nThe code's current approach is to loop over each part (split by W) and do something. \n\nThe code's 'b' is set to 1 if any part is invalid. \n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in ...:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n\n    if len(non_empty) >1:\n\n        b =1\n\n    else:\n\n        if non_empty:\n\n            p = non_empty[0]\n\n            for i in range(1, len(p)):\n\n                if p[i] == p[i-1]:\n\n                    b =1\n\n                    break\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThis would work. \n\nThus, the missing code in program2.py is to implement this logic. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe 's[:-1]' is to remove the last character (maybe a newline?), but perhaps it's better to use s.split('W') directly. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfor s in ...:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n\n    if len(non_empty) >1:\n\n        b =1\n\n    else:\n\n        if non_empty:\n\n            p = non_empty[0]\n\n            for i in range(1, len(p)):\n\n                if p[i] == p[i-1]:\n\n                    b =1\n\n                    break\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThus, the missing code in program2's loop is to compute the parts and check the conditions. \n\nBut the existing code's loop is over the parts (split by W). \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfor s in ...:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    cnt = 0\n\n    for p in parts:\n\n        if p:\n\n            cnt +=1\n\n            if cnt >1:\n\n                b =1\n\n                break\n\n            # check the current part\n\n            for i in range(1, len(p)):\n\n                if p[i] == p[i-1]:\n\n                    b =1\n\n                    break\n\n            if b:\n\n                break\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThis way, the loop over the parts checks for multiple non-empty parts and also checks the validity of the first non-empty part. \n\nThis would work. \n\nThus, the missing code in program2's loop is to implement this logic. \n\nThe code inside the for loop over the parts would need to track the count of non-empty parts and check the validity of the first one. \n\nBut the current code's loop is:\n\nfor i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe variable 'i' is each part. \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nfor s in ...:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    cnt = 0\n\n    first_part = ''\n\n    for p in parts:\n\n        if p:\n\n            cnt +=1\n\n            if cnt >1:\n\n                b =1\n\n                break\n\n            first_part = p\n\n    if not b and first_part:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(first_part)):\n\n            if first_part[i] == first_part[i-1]:\n\n                b =1\n\n                break\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThis would work. \n\nThus, the missing code in program2's loop is to count the non-empty parts and check the first one's validity. \n\nPutting it all together, the missing code for program1 is to call solve(tc+1) in the for loop, and for program2, the code inside the loop over the parts is to count the non-empty parts and check the first one's validity. \n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe missing part is in the for loop over test cases:\n\nfor tc in range(testcaseCount):\n\n    solve(tc+1)\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe missing code inside the loop over the parts is to count the non-empty parts and check the first one's validity. \n\nThe code for program2's loop would be:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    cnt = 0\n\n    first_part = ''\n\n    for p in parts:\n\n        if p:\n\n            cnt +=1\n\n            if cnt >1:\n\n                b =1\n\n                break\n\n            first_part = p\n\n    if not b and first_part:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(first_part)):\n\n            if first_part[i] == first_part[i-1]:\n\n                b =1\n\n                break\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nBut the original code's loop is over s[:-1].split(\"W\"), so perhaps the code should be adjusted to use that. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b = 0\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n\n    cnt = 0\n\n    first_part = ''\n\n    for p in parts:\n\n        if p:\n\n            cnt +=1\n\n            if cnt >1:\n\n                b =1\n\n                break\n\n            first_part = p\n\n    if not b and first_part:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(first_part)):\n\n            if first_part[i] == first_part[i-1]:\n\n                b =1\n\n                break\n\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the code inside the loop that checks the conditions. \n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nprogram1's missing code is to call solve(tc+1) in the for loop.\n\nprogram2's missing code is the code inside the loop to count parts and check validity."
