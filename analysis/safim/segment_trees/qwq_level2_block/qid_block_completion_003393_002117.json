        "text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about reconstructing array a from the given values of the last column of matrix b. The matrix b is built based on some recursive XOR rules. First, I need to understand how the matrix b is constructed. The rules are:\n\n- b[i,0] = 0 for all i.\n- b[0,i] = a[i] for i from 1 to n.\n- For 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264n, b[i,j] = b[i][j-1] XOR b[i-1][j]. The given input is the values of b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n. We need to find any possible a array that could produce these values, or output -1 if impossible. Hmm, the key is to reverse-engineer the process. Let's think about how the last column (j = n) is built. Let's see for each row i, the value b[i][n] is determined by the previous elements in the matrix. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think of the recurrence. For each cell (i,j), the value is the XOR of the cell to the left and the cell above. This reminds me of something similar to binary representations or linear algebra over GF(2), but with XOR. Since XOR is addition mod 2, maybe there's a way to express the elements in terms of the a array. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express each b[i][n] in terms of the a array. Let's try small cases to see a pattern. Take the example given in the note: a = [1,2,3], n=3. The last column (i from 1 to 3) is [0,2,1]. Let's see how that comes about. Looking at the example's b matrix:\n\nThe last column (j=3) for rows 1,2,3 are 0,2,1. Hmm, perhaps each b[i][n] can be expressed as the XOR of certain elements of a. Let me think recursively. Let me consider the formula for b[i][n].",

Column 3 (the last column for row 1): b[1][3] = b[1][2] (3) XOR b[0][3] (3) \u2192 0. Which matches the example's first entry. Row 2, column 3:\n\nHmm, let's see how row 2's entries build up.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me think of the problem in terms of the binary matrix's properties. The recurrence for b[i][j] is similar to a Pascal's triangle but with XOR. Let me see for small n.\n\nSuppose n=1. Then the last column is just b[1][1], which is a[1]. So the input would be [a1], so the solution is a1.

Since b[1][1] is a[1], so it's a1 XOR a2.\n\nb[2][2] = b[2][1] XOR b[1][2]. b[2][1] is b[2][0] (0) XOR b[1][1] (a1). So b[2][1] = a1. Thus, b[2][2] = a1 XOR (a1 XOR a2) = a2.

Hmm, so that's not equal to a3. So that idea is wrong. Hmm, perhaps the B_i for row i is the XOR of a_i and B_{i-1}? Wait, in the example for i=3, B3 is 1. B2 is 2.

So here's a pattern: For B_i (the value of b[i][n]), it's equal to a_i when i < n, but for i =n, it's a_1? Wait, in the example, B_3 (i=3, n=3) is a_1 (1). Wait, let me see: In the example, B_1 = a_1 XOR a_2 XOR a_3 \u2192 0 (since 1+2+3 mod 2 is 0). Wait, but according to the previous calculation, B_1 is 0, which is indeed a1^a2^a3 (1^2^3 = 0). Hmm, so perhaps the B array can be expressed as follows:\n\nB_1 = a_1 ^ a_2 ^ ... ^ a_n \n\nB_2 = a_2 ^ a_3 ^ ... ^ a_n B_3 = a_3 ^ ... ^ a_n Wait, but in the example, B_1 is 0 (1^2^3=0), B_2 is 2 (2^3=1?), no. Wait, in the example, B_2 is 2, but a_2^a_3 is 2^3=1. So that's not matching. Hmm, but according to the previous calculation, B_2 is a_2. Wait, in the example, B_2 is 2, which is exactly a_2. B_3 is a_1 (1). Wait, so perhaps the pattern is:\n\nB_i = a_i for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n = a_1? Wait, in the example, B_3 (n=3) is a_1 (1). Hmm, that would fit. Let me see for n=2: In the n=2 case, B_1 = a_1, B_2 = a_2. Wait, in the n=2 case earlier, B_1 is a1^a2, but according to this idea, it would be a1. So that contradicts. Hmm, so maybe my previous analysis was wrong. Let me re-examine the n=2 case. Wait, for n=2, the B array is [a1^a2, a2]. So B_1 is a1^a2, B_2 is a2. So the pattern is B_i = a_i XOR B_{i-1} ? Wait, B_1 = a1 XOR B_0 (but B_0 is a_n, which for n=2 is a2. So B_0 is a2. So B_1 = a1 XOR a2. Then B_2 = a2 XOR B_1? Wait, B_2 is a2, so a2 XOR (a1^a2) = a1. But that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps the pattern is B_i = a_i XOR B_{i-1} for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n = a_1? Wait, in the example for n=3:\n\nB_1 = a1 XOR B_0 (B_0 is a3). So B_1 = a1^a3. But in the example, B_1 is 0, which is a1^a2^a3. So that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me see for the example:\n\nB_1 =0 = a1^a2^a3 \n\nB_2 =2 = a2 \n\nB_3 =1 = a1 So the B array is [a1^a2^a3, a2, a1]. Hmm, so for n=3, B_1 is the XOR of all a's, B_2 is a2, B_3 is a1. Hmm, so perhaps for general n, B_i = a_{n - i +1} when i < n, and B_n is the XOR of all a's? Wait, let's see for n=3:\n\nB_1 = a3 (since n -1 +1 =3?), but in the example B_1 is 0 which is a1^a2^a3. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B_i = a_i for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n is the XOR of all a's. In the example, that would give B_1=1, B_2=2, B_3=0. But the given B array is [0,2,1], so that's not matching. Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me think of the example again. In the example, B_3 is 1, which is a1. B_2 is a2. B_1 is a1^a2^a3. So the B array is [a1^a2^a3, a2, a1]. So for general n, perhaps B_i = a_{n - i +1} for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n is the XOR of all a's. Wait, for n=3, B_1 would be a3 (since n-i+1 =3-1+1=3?), but in the example B_1 is a1^a2^a3. Hmm, not quite.",

Wait, in the example, the reverse of a is [3,2,1]. The first element would be a1^a2 = 3? Not sure. Hmm, maybe I need to find a way to express the a array in terms of the B array. Let me think of the example again. Given B array [0,2,1], the a array is [1,2,3]. So:\n\nB_1 = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 \n\nB_2 = a2 \n\nB_3 = a1 So, if I can express a1, a2, a3 in terms of B's:\n\na3 = B_1 ^ a1 ^ a2 \n\nBut B_2 = a2 \u2192 a2 = B_2 \n\nB_3 = a1 \u2192 a1 = B_3 So substituting:\n\na3 = B_1 ^ B_3 ^ B_2 \n\nThus, the a array can be computed as:\n\na1 = B_3 \n\na2 = B_2 \n\na3 = B_1 ^ B_2 ^ B_3 So for the example:\n\na1 =1 (B3 is 1), a2=2 (B2 is 2), a3 =0 ^2 ^1 \u2192 3. Which matches. So this seems to work. So for general n, perhaps the a array can be computed as follows:\n\na_i = B_{n - i +1} for i from 1 to n-1, and a_n is B_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{n-1}). Wait, let me see for n=3:\n\na1 = B_3 \n\na2 = B_2 \n\na3 = B_1 XOR (a1 XOR a2) Which is exactly what I had above. So the general formula would be:\n\na_i = B_{n - i +1} for i from 1 to n-1 \n\na_n = B_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{n-1}) Wait, but how do we compute a_n? Alternatively, since B_1 is the XOR of all a's (a1^a2^...^a_n), then:\n\nB_1 = a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ a_{n} So a_n = B_1 ^ (a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1})\n\nWhich is exactly the formula above. So the steps to compute a are:\n\n1. For i from 1 to n-1, set a_i = B_{n -i +1} \n\n2. Compute the XOR of a_1 to a_{n-1}, then a_n = B_1 XOR that value. This way, the a array is determined. Let me test this for n=2:\n\nSuppose B array is [B1, B2]. Then:\n\na1 = B_2 \n\na2 = B_1 XOR a1 \n\nWait, for n=2, the formula would be:\n\na1 = B_{2} (since n-i+1 for i=1 is 2-1+1=2) a2 = B_1 XOR a1 But according to the earlier example for n=2:\n\nB1 = a1^a2 \n\nB2 = a2 \n\nSo a1 = B2 (since B2 is a2). Then a2 = B1 XOR a1 \u2192 a2 = (a1^a2) XOR a1 \u2192 a2 = a2. Which holds. So this works. Another test case: n=1. Then B array has one element B1. Then a1 = B1 (since n-i+1 for i=1 is 1). Which is correct, since B1 is a1. So this approach seems to work. Thus, the algorithm is:\n\n- The a array is constructed as follows:\n\n   a_i = B_{n -i +1} for i from 1 to n-1 \n\n   a_n = B_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{n-1}) Then, we need to check if this a array indeed produces the given B array. Wait, but how do we know that this is the only possible solution? Or is there any possibility of multiple solutions?",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about reconstructing array a from the given values of the last column of matrix b. The matrix b is built based on some recursive XOR rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the matrix b is constructed. The rules are:\n\n- b[i,0] = 0 for all i.\n- b[0,i] = a[i] for i from 1 to n.\n- For 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264n, b[i,j] = b[i][j-1] XOR b[i-1][j].\n\nThe given input is the values of b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n. We need to find any possible a array that could produce these values, or output -1 if impossible.\n\nHmm, the key is to reverse-engineer the process. Let's think about how the last column (j = n) is built. Let's see for each row i, the value b[i][n] is determined by the previous elements in the matrix. \n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think of the recurrence. For each cell (i,j), the value is the XOR of the cell to the left and the cell above. \n\nThis reminds me of something similar to binary representations or linear algebra over GF(2), but with XOR. Since XOR is addition mod 2, maybe there's a way to express the elements in terms of the a array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express each b[i][n] in terms of the a array. Let's try small cases to see a pattern.\n\nTake the example given in the note: a = [1,2,3], n=3. The last column (i from 1 to 3) is [0,2,1]. Let's see how that comes about.\n\nLooking at the example's b matrix:\n\nThe last column (j=3) for rows 1,2,3 are 0,2,1. \n\nHmm, perhaps each b[i][n] can be expressed as the XOR of certain elements of a. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet me consider the formula for b[i][n]. Since each step depends on the previous cells, maybe there's a way to express b[i][n] as the XOR of a certain subset of a's elements. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_1, a_2, ..., a_i, but that might not be the case. Let me see the example:\n\nIn the example, for i=2, the value is 2. The a elements up to 2 are 1 and 2, their XOR is 3, but the result is 2. So that's not it. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of the process for building the matrix. Let's see for the example:\n\nThe a array is [1,2,3]. The matrix b is built as follows:\n\nRow 0 is [0,1,2,3], since b[0,j] = a[j].\n\nThen for row 1, column 1:\n\nb[1][1] = b[1][0] (0) XOR b[0][1] (1) \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 2 for row 1: b[1][2] = b[1][1] (1) XOR b[0][2] (2) \u2192 3.\n\nColumn 3 (the last column for row 1): b[1][3] = b[1][2] (3) XOR b[0][3] (3) \u2192 0. Which matches the example's first entry.\n\nRow 2, column 3:\n\nHmm, let's see how row 2's entries build up. \n\nRow 2, column 1: b[2][1] = b[2][0] (0) XOR b[1][1] (1) \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 2: b[2][2] = b[2][1] (1) XOR b[1][2] (3) \u2192 2.\n\nColumn 3: b[2][3] = b[2][2] (2) XOR b[1][3] (0) \u2192 2. Which matches the second entry.\n\nRow 3, column 3:\n\nb[3][3] = b[3][2] XOR b[2][3]. Let's see:\n\nRow 3's entries:\n\nRow 3, column 1: 0 XOR b[2][1] (1) \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 2: b[3][1] (1) XOR b[2][2] (2) \u2192 3.\n\nColumn 3: b[3][2] (3) XOR b[2][3] (2) \u2192 1. Which matches the third entry.\n\nHmm, so how can we find a formula for b[i][n] in terms of a?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where each b[i][n] is the XOR of a_j for j in some subset related to the binary representation of i?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_k for all k where the binary representation of (i) has a 1 in the (n - k +1)th position? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value b[i][n] can be expressed as the XOR of a_1, a_2, ..., a_i, but with some combination. Wait, in the example, for i=2, the a elements up to 2 are 1 and 2, their XOR is 3, but the result is 2. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to find a relationship between the a array and the given b_i,n values. Let me think of the recurrence for the last column.\n\nLet me consider the last column (j = n). For each row i from 1 to n, the value b[i][n] is computed as b[i][n-1] XOR b[i-1][n].\n\nWait, but that's the recurrence for the cell (i, n). So, for each i, b[i][n] = b[i][n-1] XOR b[i-1][n].\n\nHmm, this seems recursive. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLet me think of the last column as a vector. Let me denote the last column as B = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n], where b_i is b[i][n].\n\nThe recurrence for each b_i is:\n\nb_i = (b_{i}[n-1]) XOR (b_{i-1}[n])\n\nWait, but how do we express b_i in terms of previous terms?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. Let me see:\n\nLet me consider the variables as the a array. The problem is to find a such that when we compute the matrix b according to the rules, the last column matches the given B array.\n\nThe challenge is to reverse-engineer a from B.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to express each b_i in terms of a's elements. Let me think of the process for building the matrix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to note that the value b[i][n] can be expressed as the XOR of a_j for all j where the binary representation of (i) has a 1 in certain positions. Wait, perhaps the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_{i & (n - k +1)}? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_i, but with some other terms. Let me think of the example again.\n\nIn the example, for i=3, the a elements are 1,2,3. Their XOR is 0 (1^2=3, 3^3=0). The b[3][3] is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me think of the process for building the matrix. Let me see for each row i, the value b[i][n] can be expressed in terms of the a array and previous rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_i and b[i-1][n]. Wait, let's see in the example:\n\nFor i=1, b[1][n] (which is 0) would be a_1 XOR b[0][n]. But b[0][n] is a_n (since b[0][n] = a_n). Wait, in the example, a_3 is 3, so a_n is 3. So 1 XOR 3 is 2, but the result is 0. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to find a way to express each b_i in terms of a's elements. Let me think of the recurrence for the last column.\n\nThe recurrence for the last column is:\n\nb[i][n] = b[i][n-1] XOR b[i-1][n]\n\nBut how do we express b[i][n-1]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire process can be represented in terms of the a array through some linear algebra over GF(2). But since the problem allows any solution, maybe there's a way to compute a in O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of binary matrices. Let me see for each a_j, how it contributes to the b_i,n values.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_j for all j where the binary representation of (i) has a 1 in the (n - j +1)th position? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_1, a_2, ..., a_i, but with some combination. Let me see the example again:\n\nIn the example, for i=2, the a elements up to 2 are 1 and 2, their XOR is 3, but the result is 2. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to realize that the last column can be expressed as the XOR of certain elements of a. Let me think of the process for building the matrix.\n\nLet me consider the last column. Let me think of the process for building each row's last column entry.\n\nSuppose we have the a array. Let me see for row i, the value b[i][n] is built by the recurrence. Let me see for row i, the value b[i][n] can be written as the XOR of a_i and b[i-1][n], but that might not be correct.\n\nWait, let's think of the recurrence for the last column. Let me see for row i, the last column entry is:\n\nb[i][n] = b[i][n-1] XOR b[i-1][n]\n\nBut how is b[i][n-1] computed?\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be represented as a linear recurrence. Let me see for each i, the value b[i][n] can be expressed in terms of previous terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the last column entries form a certain pattern. Let me think of the process for building the matrix. \n\nWait, perhaps the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_i and b[i-1][n]. Let me test this with the example:\n\nIn the example, for i=1, b[1][n] is 0. According to this idea, it would be a_1 (1) XOR b[0][n]. But b[0][n] is a_n (3). So 1 XOR 3 is 2, but the actual value is 0. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let me think of the problem in terms of the binary matrix's properties. \n\nThe recurrence for b[i][j] is similar to a Pascal's triangle but with XOR. Let me see for small n.\n\nSuppose n=1. Then the last column is just b[1][1], which is a[1]. So the input would be [a1], so the solution is a1.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nThe last column entries are b[1][2] and b[2][2].\n\nLet me compute them:\n\nb[1][2] = b[1][1] XOR a[2]. Since b[1][1] is a[1], so it's a1 XOR a2.\n\nb[2][2] = b[2][1] XOR b[1][2]. \n\nb[2][1] is b[2][0] (0) XOR b[1][1] (a1). So b[2][1] = a1.\n\nThus, b[2][2] = a1 XOR (a1 XOR a2) = a2.\n\nSo for n=2, the given B array is [a1^a2, a2]. \n\nSo given B1 and B2, we can solve for a1 and a2:\n\nB1 = a1 ^ a2\n\nB2 = a2\n\nSo a2 = B2, then a1 = B1 ^ B2.\n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nThe given B array is [0,2,1] as in the example. Let's see:\n\nWe can compute a3 from B3 (since B3 = a3?), but in the example, B3 is 1, and a3 is 3. So that's not the case. Wait, in the example, B3 is 1, but a3 is 3. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, so for n=3, the B3 is 1, but a3 is 3. So that approach doesn't hold. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the B_i for i =n is a_i? No, that's not the case here. \n\nWait, let's see for n=3, the B3 is b[3][3]. Let's see how that is computed.\n\nIn the example, a3 is 3. \n\nLooking at the example's b matrix, the last entry (3,3) is 1. \n\nHmm, so that's not equal to a3. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps the B_i for row i is the XOR of a_i and B_{i-1}?\n\nWait, in the example for i=3, B3 is 1. B2 is 2. So 2 XOR a3 (3) is 1. 2^3 is 1, so yes. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=3, B1 =0, B2=2, B3=1.\n\nThen B1 = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3?\n\nWait, in the example, a1^a2^a3 is 1^2^3 = 0, which matches B1=0.\n\nB2 is 2, which is a2 ^ a3 (2^3=1?), no. Wait 2 XOR3 is 1, but B2 is 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B_i is the XOR of a_1 to a_i?\n\nIn the example, for i=2, a1^a2 is 3, but B2 is 2. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the B_i is the XOR of a_i and B_{i-1}?\n\nIn the example:\n\nB1 =0, which would be a1? But a1 is 1. So no.\n\nHmm, perhaps the B_i is the XOR of a_i and B_{i-1} for i from 1 to n. Let's see:\n\nSuppose B_1 = a1.\n\nThen B_2 = a2 XOR B_1.\n\nB_3 = a3 XOR B_2.\n\nIn the example, that would give:\n\nB1 =1, B2= 2^1=3, B3=3^3=0. But the given B array is [0,2,1], so that's not matching.\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nHmm, perhaps the B_i is the XOR of a_i and B_{i-1} for i from n down to 1?\n\nWait, let's see for the example:\n\nSuppose B3 is a3, then B2 = a2 XOR B3, B1 = a1 XOR B2.\n\nThen:\n\nB3 =3 (a3), B2 =2 XOR3 =1, B1 =1 XOR1 =0. Which matches the given B array [0,2,1]? Wait no, the given B array is [0,2,1], but according to this, B2 would be 1, not 2. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm, so that approach also doesn't work.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to find a different approach. Let me think of the recurrence for the last column.\n\nThe recurrence for the last column is:\n\nb[i][n] = b[i][n-1] XOR b[i-1][n]\n\nBut how do we express b[i][n-1]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire process can be represented as a linear combination of the a array elements. Let me think of the problem in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but since the numbers can be large, maybe there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the last column can be expressed as the XOR of certain a elements. Let me think of the process for building the matrix.\n\nLet me consider the last column entries. Let me see for each row i, the value b[i][n] can be written as the XOR of a_j for all j where the binary representation of (i) has a 1 in the (n - j +1)th position. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value b[i][n] is the XOR of a_1, a_2, ..., a_i, but with some other terms. Let me think of the example again.\n\nIn the example, for i=3, the a elements are 1,2,3. Their XOR is 0, but the B3 is 1. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the B_i is the XOR of a_i and B_{i-1} but with some other terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed as the XOR of a_i and the previous B_{i-1} but with some other terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the B array is the reverse of the a array. Let me see in the example: the B array is [0,2,1], and the a array is [1,2,3]. Not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to find a way to express each B_i in terms of a's elements. Let me think of the process for building the matrix.\n\nLet me think of the last column. Let me see for each row i, the value b[i][n] is built from the previous row's last column and the current row's previous column.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that the last column can be represented as a linear combination of the a array elements. Let me think of the process for building the matrix.\n\nLet me consider the last column entries. Let me see for row i, the value b[i][n] can be written as the XOR of a_i and the previous row's last column entry. \n\nWait, let me see for the example:\n\nFor i=1, B1 is 0. a1 is 1. B0 would be 0 (since row 0's last column is a_n, which is 3. Wait, no, row 0's last column is a_n. So B0 is a_n. So for row 1, B1 = b[1][n] = b[1][n-1] XOR b[0][n].\n\nWait, the recurrence for the last column is:\n\nb[i][n] = b[i][n-1] XOR b[i-1][n]\n\nBut how do we express b[i][n-1]?\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be represented as a system of equations. Let me see for each i from 1 to n:\n\nb[i][n] = (b[i][n-1]) XOR (b[i-1][n])\n\nBut how do we express b[i][n-1]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire process can be represented as a linear recurrence. Let me think of the last column entries as a vector and see how they relate to the a array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the last column entries form a certain pattern that can be reversed. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nSuppose we want to find a such that when we compute the matrix, the last column matches B. Let me think of the process for building the last column.\n\nLet me consider the last column entries B_1, B_2, ..., B_n. \n\nLet me think of the process for building the last column. Let me see for each row i, the value B_i (b[i][n]) is computed as follows:\n\nB_i = (b[i][n-1]) XOR B_{i-1}\n\nBut how is b[i][n-1] computed?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be found by looking at the binary representations of the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to realize that the a array can be obtained by taking the XOR of the B array in reverse order, but with some adjustments. Let me see in the example:\n\nThe B array is [0,2,1]. Reversed, it's [1,2,0]. The a array is [1,2,3]. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the a array is the XOR of the B array with some other terms. \n\nWait, let me think of the example again. The B array is [0,2,1]. The a array is [1,2,3]. \n\nLooking at the B array:\n\nB_1 =0 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3 (1^2^3=0 \u2192 yes).\n\nB_2 =2 = a2 XOR a3 (2^3=1 \u2192 no). Hmm, not.\n\nWait, B_2 is 2. Let me see how it's computed. \n\nIn the example, B_2 is b[2][3]. Let's see how that is built:\n\nb[2][3] = b[2][2] XOR b[1][3].\n\nb[2][2] is 2, and b[1][3] is 0. So 2 XOR 0 =2 \u2192 correct.\n\nb[2][2] is computed as b[2][1] XOR b[1][2]. \n\nb[2][1] is a1 (since row 2, column 1: 0 XOR b[1][1] (a1) \u2192 a1).\n\nb[1][2] is b[1][1] (a1) XOR a2 \u2192 a1^a2.\n\nSo b[2][2] = a1 XOR (a1^a2) \u2192 a2.\n\nThus, b[2][2] is a2. \n\nThen, b[2][3] = a2 XOR b[1][3]. \n\nb[1][3] is 0, so B_2 is a2. \n\nWait, in the example, a2 is 2, so that's correct. \n\nWait, so B_2 is a2. \n\nThen B_3 is b[3][3]. Let's see:\n\nb[3][3] = b[3][2] XOR b[2][3].\n\nb[3][2] is computed as b[3][1] XOR b[2][2].\n\nb[3][1] is 0 XOR b[2][1] (a1) \u2192 a1.\n\nb[2][2] is a2. So b[3][2] = a1 XOR a2.\n\nThen, b[3][3] = (a1^a2) XOR (a2) \u2192 a1. \n\nWait, in the example, a1 is 1, so B_3 would be 1, which matches the example's B3=1. \n\nAh! So here's a pattern:\n\nFor B_i (the value of b[i][n]), it's equal to a_i when i < n, but for i =n, it's a_1?\n\nWait, in the example, B_3 (i=3, n=3) is a_1 (1). \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIn the example, B_1 = a_1 XOR a_2 XOR a_3 \u2192 0 (since 1+2+3 mod 2 is 0). \n\nWait, but according to the previous calculation, B_1 is 0, which is indeed a1^a2^a3 (1^2^3 = 0). \n\nHmm, so perhaps the B array can be expressed as follows:\n\nB_1 = a_1 ^ a_2 ^ ... ^ a_n \n\nB_2 = a_2 ^ a_3 ^ ... ^ a_n \n\nB_3 = a_3 ^ ... ^ a_n \n\nWait, but in the example, B_1 is 0 (1^2^3=0), B_2 is 2 (2^3=1?), no. Wait, in the example, B_2 is 2, but a_2^a_3 is 2^3=1. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, but according to the previous calculation, B_2 is a_2. \n\nWait, in the example, B_2 is 2, which is exactly a_2. \n\nB_3 is a_1 (1). \n\nWait, so perhaps the pattern is:\n\nB_i = a_i for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n = a_1?\n\nWait, in the example, B_3 (n=3) is a_1 (1). \n\nHmm, that would fit. Let me see for n=2:\n\nIn the n=2 case, B_1 = a_1, B_2 = a_2. \n\nWait, in the n=2 case earlier, B_1 is a1^a2, but according to this idea, it would be a1. So that contradicts. \n\nHmm, so maybe my previous analysis was wrong. Let me re-examine the n=2 case.\n\nWait, for n=2, the B array is [a1^a2, a2]. \n\nSo B_1 is a1^a2, B_2 is a2. \n\nSo the pattern is B_i = a_i XOR B_{i-1} ?\n\nWait, B_1 = a1 XOR B_0 (but B_0 is a_n, which for n=2 is a2. So B_0 is a2. So B_1 = a1 XOR a2. \n\nThen B_2 = a2 XOR B_1? \n\nWait, B_2 is a2, so a2 XOR (a1^a2) = a1. But that's not the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the pattern is B_i = a_i XOR B_{i-1} for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n = a_1?\n\nWait, in the example for n=3:\n\nB_1 = a1 XOR B_0 (B_0 is a3). So B_1 = a1^a3. \n\nBut in the example, B_1 is 0, which is a1^a2^a3. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me see for the example:\n\nB_1 =0 = a1^a2^a3 \n\nB_2 =2 = a2 \n\nB_3 =1 = a1 \n\nSo the B array is [a1^a2^a3, a2, a1]. \n\nHmm, so for n=3, B_1 is the XOR of all a's, B_2 is a2, B_3 is a1. \n\nHmm, so perhaps for general n, B_i = a_{n - i +1} when i < n, and B_n is the XOR of all a's?\n\nWait, let's see for n=3:\n\nB_1 = a3 (since n -1 +1 =3?), but in the example B_1 is 0 which is a1^a2^a3. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps B_i = a_i for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n is the XOR of all a's. \n\nIn the example, that would give B_1=1, B_2=2, B_3=0. But the given B array is [0,2,1], so that's not matching. \n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me think of the example again. \n\nIn the example, B_3 is 1, which is a1. \n\nB_2 is a2. \n\nB_1 is a1^a2^a3. \n\nSo the B array is [a1^a2^a3, a2, a1]. \n\nSo for general n, perhaps B_i = a_{n - i +1} for i from 1 to n-1, and B_n is the XOR of all a's. \n\nWait, for n=3, B_1 would be a3 (since n-i+1 =3-1+1=3?), but in the example B_1 is a1^a2^a3. \n\nHmm, not quite. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the B array is the reverse of the a array, but with the first element being the XOR of all elements. \n\nIn the example, the a array is [1,2,3], so the reverse is [3,2,1]. The first element would be 1^2^3=0. So the B array would be [0,2,3], but the example's B array is [0,2,1]. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, perhaps the B array is the reverse of the a array, but with the first element being the XOR of all elements except the last. \n\nWait, in the example, the reverse of a is [3,2,1]. The first element would be a1^a2 = 3? Not sure. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to find a way to express the a array in terms of the B array. \n\nLet me think of the example again. \n\nGiven B array [0,2,1], the a array is [1,2,3]. \n\nSo:\n\nB_1 = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 \n\nB_2 = a2 \n\nB_3 = a1 \n\nSo, if I can express a1, a2, a3 in terms of B's:\n\na3 = B_1 ^ a1 ^ a2 \n\nBut B_2 = a2 \u2192 a2 = B_2 \n\nB_3 = a1 \u2192 a1 = B_3 \n\nSo substituting:\n\na3 = B_1 ^ B_3 ^ B_2 \n\nThus, the a array can be computed as:\n\na1 = B_3 \n\na2 = B_2 \n\na3 = B_1 ^ B_2 ^ B_3 \n\nSo for the example:\n\na1 =1 (B3 is 1), a2=2 (B2 is 2), a3 =0 ^2 ^1 \u2192 3. Which matches. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo for general n, perhaps the a array can be computed as follows:\n\na_i = B_{n - i +1} for i from 1 to n-1, and a_n is B_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, let me see for n=3:\n\na1 = B_3 \n\na2 = B_2 \n\na3 = B_1 XOR (a1 XOR a2) \n\nWhich is exactly what I had above. \n\nSo the general formula would be:\n\na_i = B_{n - i +1} for i from 1 to n-1 \n\na_n = B_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{n-1})\n\nWait, but how do we compute a_n?\n\nAlternatively, since B_1 is the XOR of all a's (a1^a2^...^a_n), then:\n\nB_1 = a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ a_{n} \n\nSo a_n = B_1 ^ (a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1})\n\nWhich is exactly the formula above. \n\nSo the steps to compute a are:\n\n1. For i from 1 to n-1, set a_i = B_{n -i +1} \n\n2. Compute the XOR of a_1 to a_{n-1}, then a_n = B_1 XOR that value. \n\nThis way, the a array is determined. \n\nLet me test this for n=2:\n\nSuppose B array is [B1, B2]. \n\nThen:\n\na1 = B_2 \n\na2 = B_1 XOR a1 \n\nWait, for n=2, the formula would be:\n\na1 = B_{2} (since n-i+1 for i=1 is 2-1+1=2)\n\na2 = B_1 XOR a1 \n\nBut according to the earlier example for n=2:\n\nB1 = a1^a2 \n\nB2 = a2 \n\nSo a1 = B2 (since B2 is a2). \n\nThen a2 = B1 XOR a1 \u2192 a2 = (a1^a2) XOR a1 \u2192 a2 = a2. Which holds. \n\nSo this works. \n\nAnother test case: n=1. \n\nThen B array has one element B1. \n\nThen a1 = B1 (since n-i+1 for i=1 is 1). \n\nWhich is correct, since B1 is a1. \n\nSo this approach seems to work. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n- The a array is constructed as follows:\n\n   a_i = B_{n -i +1} for i from 1 to n-1 \n\n   a_n = B_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{n-1})\n\nThen, we need to check if this a array indeed produces the given B array. \n\nWait, but how do we know that this is the only possible solution? Or is there any possibility of multiple solutions?\n\nWait, according to the above approach, the a array is uniquely determined by the B array. So if the computed a array produces the B array, then it's valid. Otherwise, there's no solution. \n\nWait, but how can there be no solution? Because the way we computed a is based on the B array, so it should always produce the B array. \n\nWait, let me see. Suppose we compute a as per the above steps, then compute the B array from a. \n\nLet me see for the example:\n\na1 = B3 =1 \n\na2 = B2 =2 \n\na3 = B1 (0) XOR (1^2) \u2192 0 XOR3 \u21923 \n\nThen, when we compute B array:\n\nB1 = a1^a2^a3 \u21921^2^3 =0 \n\nB2 = a2 \u21922 \n\nB3 = a1 \u21921 \n\nWhich matches the given B array. \n\nAnother test case: let's take n=2. Suppose B array is [3, 1]. \n\nThen:\n\na1 = B2 =1 \n\na2 = B1 XOR a1 \u21923 XOR1 =2 \n\nThen the computed B array would be:\n\nB1 = a1^a2 \u21921^2=3 \n\nB2 =a2 \u21922 \n\nWait, but the given B2 is 1. So this would not match. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, in this case, the computed a array would give B2 as a2=2, but the given B2 is 1. So this would be invalid. \n\nSo this suggests that the approach is not always valid. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nWait, in this test case, the given B array is [3,1]. \n\nAccording to the algorithm, a1 = B2 =1 \n\na2 = B1 XOR a1 \u21923 XOR1 =2 \n\nThen, the computed B array would be:\n\nB1 = a1^a2 \u21921^2=3 (matches given B1)\n\nB2 = a2 \u21922 (but given B2 is 1). \n\nThus, this is a contradiction. \n\nSo this means that the algorithm produces an a array that does not satisfy the B array. \n\nThus, the algorithm is not correct. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nAh, I see. The algorithm assumes that the B array can be generated by such an a array, but in this case, it's not possible. \n\nSo the algorithm must first check whether the computed a array indeed produces the given B array. \n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the algorithm is based on the B array's values. \n\nWait, in this test case, the given B array is [3,1]. \n\nFollowing the algorithm, the computed a array is [1,2]. \n\nThen, when we compute the B array from a:\n\nB1 = a1^a2 \u21923 \n\nB2 = a2 \u21922 \n\nBut the given B2 is 1. So this is invalid. \n\nThus, the algorithm would produce an a array that doesn't match the B array. \n\nSo this means that the given B array is not possible, so the answer should be -1. \n\nAh, so the algorithm must first compute the a array as per the steps, then verify whether the computed B array matches the given one. \n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute a array as per the steps. \n\n2. Reconstruct the B array from a and see if it matches the given B array. \n\n3. If yes, output a. Else, output -1. \n\nSo the algorithm is correct, but we have to perform this verification. \n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Compute a array as per the formula. \n\n- Then, compute the B array from a and check if it matches the input. \n\n- If yes, output a. Else, output -1. \n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently. \n\nThe problem constraints are n up to 5e5, so we need an O(n) solution. \n\nNow, how to compute the a array:\n\nThe a array is built as follows:\n\na[1] = B[n]\n\na[2] = B[n-1]\n\n...\n\na[n-1] = B[2]\n\na[n] = B[1] XOR (a[1] XOR a[2] ... XOR a[n-1])\n\nWait, but the indices here are 1-based. \n\nWait, in code, the B array is given as a list of length n. Let's say the input is stored as a list called B, where B[0] is B_1 (since the input is given as b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}).\n\nWait, the input is given as the second line as \"b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}\". So the list a in the code (from the code given in program2.py) is read as:\n\na = list(map(int, ...)), so a[0] is B_1, a[1] is B_2, ..., a[n-1] is B_n. \n\nSo to compute the a array (the desired array), we need to do:\n\nThe desired a array (let's call it res) is of length n. \n\nres[0] = B_{n} \u2192 which is a[-1] (since B is stored as a list where a[0] is B_1, a[1] is B_2, ..., a[n-1] is B_n). \n\nWait, for example, in the first example, the input B array is [0,2,1], which corresponds to B_1=0, B_2=2, B_3=1. \n\nSo the desired a array is [1,2,3]. \n\nres[0] = B_3 (1), res[1] = B_2 (2), res[2] = B_1 XOR (res[0] ^ res[1]). \n\nWait, for res[2], the a_n (third element in 0-based) is B_1 (0) XOR (res[0] ^ res[1]) \u2192 0 ^ (1^2) \u2192 3. \n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nInitialize res as a list of length n. \n\nfor i in 0 to n-2:\n\n    res[i] = B[n-1 -i] \n\nThen, compute the XOR of the first n-1 elements of res, then set res[n-1] = B[0] ^ xor_sum. \n\nThen, we need to verify whether this res array indeed produces the given B array. \n\nBut how to verify this efficiently?\n\nComputing the B array from res would take O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n=5e5. \n\nThus, we need a way to verify the computed a array without recomputing the entire B array. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way to check the validity. \n\nWait, according to the earlier analysis, the computed a array will produce the correct B array if and only if the following holds:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\nB_i = a_i when i <n \n\nB_n = a_1 \n\nWait, no, in the example, B_3 (i=3, n=3) is a_1. \n\nWait, in the example, B_i for i <n (i=1 and 2) are:\n\nB_1 = a1^a2^a3 \n\nB_2 = a2 \n\nB_3 = a1 \n\nSo for i <n (i=1 and 2 in n=3 case), B_i is not equal to a_i. \n\nHmm, so that approach won't work. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that the computed a array will automatically satisfy the B array's conditions. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe computed a array is constructed such that:\n\nB_1 = a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ a_n \n\nB_i = a_i for 2 \u2264i \u2264n \n\nWait, no, in the example, B_2 is a2, B_3 is a1. \n\nWait, in the example, B_3 is a1, which is not a_i (since i=3, a_3 is 3). \n\nHmm, so that's not the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the computed a array will automatically satisfy the B array's conditions. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe computed a array is built such that:\n\nFor i from 1 to n-1:\n\na_i = B_{n -i +1} \n\na_n = B_1 XOR (a_1 ^ a_2 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1})\n\nThen, the B array computed from this a array will have:\n\nB_1 = a_1 ^ a_2 ^ ... ^ a_n \n\n= (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n-1}) XOR a_n \n\nBut a_n is B_1 XOR (sum of a_1 to a_{n-1}), so substituting:\n\nB_1 = (sum) XOR (B_1 XOR sum) \u2192 B_1. \n\nSo B_1 is correct. \n\nFor B_i where 2 \u2264i \u2264n:\n\nB_i = a_i \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, in the example, B_2 is a_2 (2), which is correct. \n\nB_3 is a_1 (1), which is not a_3 (3). \n\nHmm, so this suggests that B_i for i from 2 to n is a_{n -i +2} ?\n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nWait, in the example, B_3 (i=3) is a_1. \n\nThe formula for B_i (the B array given) is:\n\nB_i = a_{n -i +1} \n\nWait, for i=3, n=3: n -i +1 =1 \u2192 a_1. \n\nFor i=2, n=3: 3-2+1=2 \u2192 a_2. \n\nFor i=1: 3-1+1=3 \u2192 a_3. \n\nBut B_1 is a_3 XOR a_1 XOR a_2. \n\nHmm, so the B array is:\n\nB_i = a_{n -i +1} for i from 2 to n \n\nB_1 is the XOR of all a's. \n\nThus, the computed a array will have B_i for i from 2 to n equal to a_{n-i+1} \n\nWait, but in the example, B_3 is a_1, which is a_{3-3+1} = a_1. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the computed a array will have B_i (for i from 2 to n) equal to a_{n -i +1} \n\nBut the given B array must satisfy this. \n\nWait, the given B array's B_i for i from 2 to n must be equal to a_{n -i+1} \n\nBut the a array is computed as a_{n -i+1} = B_{i} \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe computed a array is:\n\na_1 = B_{n} \n\na_2 = B_{n-1} \n\n... \n\na_{n-1} = B_2 \n\na_n = B_1 XOR (a_1 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1}) \n\nThus, for B_i (given) where i ranges from 2 to n:\n\nB_i must equal a_{n -i+1} \n\nBut a_{n -i+1} is B_{i} \n\nWait, because:\n\na_{n -i+1} = B_{n - (n -i+1) +1} \n\nWait, let me see for a_{k} where k = n -i+1 \n\nThen, the index in B for a_k is B_{n -k +1} \n\nWait, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the computed a array is such that a_{k} = B_{n -k +1} for k from 1 to n-1. \n\nThus, for any i from 2 to n, the desired B_i (given) must be equal to a_{n -i+1} \n\nBut a_{n -i+1} = B_{n - (n -i+1) +1} \n\n= B_{i -1 +1} \n\n= B_i \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, let me compute for a_{n -i+1}:\n\na_{n -i+1} = B_{n - (n -i+1) +1} \n\n= B_{i -1 +1} \n\n= B_i \n\nWait, that's exactly what we want. \n\nThus, for i from 2 to n, B_i (given) must equal a_{n -i+1} \n\nBut since a_{n -i+1} = B_i (given), this holds. \n\nThus, the computed a array will automatically satisfy B_i = a_{n -i+1} for i from 2 to n. \n\nThe only condition that needs to be checked is whether B_1 equals the XOR of all a's. \n\nBecause B_1 is the XOR of all a's. \n\nThus, the only check needed is whether the computed a array's XOR of all elements equals B_1. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe computed a array's a_n is set to B_1 XOR (a_1 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1} )\n\nThus, the total XOR of all a's is:\n\n(a_1 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1}) ) ^ a_n \n\n= (a_1 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1}) ) ^ (B_1 XOR (a_1 ^ ... ^ a_{n-1}) )\n\n= B_1 \n\nThus, the total XOR is B_1. \n\nThus, the computed a array will always satisfy the B_1 condition. \n\nThus, the only thing we need to check is whether the computed a array's B_i for i from 2 to n equals the given B array's B_i. \n\nWait, but according to the earlier analysis, the computed a array's B_i for i from 2 to n is exactly the given B_i. \n\nBecause a_{n -i+1} = B_i (given). \n\nThus, the computed a array will always satisfy the B array's conditions. \n\nWait, this is confusing. \n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nThe computed a array is built such that for each i from 2 to n:\n\nB_i (given) must be equal to a_{n -i+1} \n\nBut the a array is built as a_{k} = B_{n -k +1} for k from 1 to n-1. \n\nThus, for any i from 2 to n:\n\na_{n -i+1} = B_{n - (n -i+1) +1} \n\n= B_{i-1 +1} \n\n= B_i \n\nThus, the computed a array will have a_{n -i+1} = B_i \n\nThus, the B_i (given) is exactly the value of a_{n -i+1} \n\nThus, the computed a array will automatically satisfy the B array's conditions for all i except possibly B_1. \n\nBut B_1 is the XOR of all a's, which is set to B_1. \n\nThus, the computed a array will always satisfy the B array's conditions. \n\nThus, there is always a solution. \n\nWait, but in the earlier test case where the given B array is [3,1], let's see:\n\nn=2 \n\nB array is [3,1]. \n\nThen, the computed a array is:\n\na_1 = B_2 (1) \n\na_2 = B_1 XOR (a_1) \u21923 XOR1 =2 \n\nThus, the a array is [1,2]. \n\nThe computed B array would be:\n\nB_1 = a1^a2 \u21921^2=3 (matches given B_1=3) \n\nB_2 = a_{n -i+1} where i=2 \u2192 a_{2-2+1} =a_1 \u21921 (matches given B_2=1). \n\nThus, this works. \n\nAh! I see my mistake earlier. \n\nIn my previous test case where I thought the B array was [3,1], the computed a array would indeed produce the correct B array. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nGiven B array [3,1], which is B_1=3, B_2=1. \n\nThe computed a array is:\n\na_1 = B_2 (1) \n\na_2 = B_1 XOR a_1 \u21923 XOR1 =2 \n\nThus, the a array is [1,2]. \n\nThen, the B array computed from this a array is:\n\nB_1 = a1^a2 \u21921^2=3 \n\nB_2 = a_{n -i+1} where i=2 \u2192 a_{2} \u21922? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, for B_2 (i=2, n=2), the formula says B_i = a_{n -i+1} \n\nn -i+1 = 2-2+1 =1 \u2192 a_1 =1. \n\nThus, B_2 is 1, which matches the given B_2. \n\nThus, the computed a array is valid. \n\nAh! So my earlier mistake was in thinking that B_2 would be a_2, but it's actually a_{n-i+1} which for i=2 is a_1. \n\nThus, the algorithm is correct. \n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the a array as follows:\n\n   For i from 1 to n-1 (0-based up to n-2):\n\n      a[i] = B[n -i] \n\n   a[n-1] = B[0] XOR (XOR of a[0] to a[n-2])\n\n- Then, the computed a array will always satisfy the B array's conditions. \n\nThus, there is always a solution. \n\nWait, but what if the given B array is [0,0], n=2?\n\nThen:\n\na_1 = B_2 (0) \n\na_2 = B_1 (0) XOR a_1 (0) \u21920 \n\nThus, a array is [0,0]. \n\nThe computed B array would be:\n\nB_1 =0^0=0 \n\nB_2 = a_{2-2+1}=a_1 \u21920 \n\nWhich matches. \n\nThus, the algorithm works. \n\nThus, the solution is to compute the a array as described, and output it. \n\nNow, the code for program2.py needs to implement this. \n\nThe code given in program2.py has a TODO in the loop:\n\nfor k in 0,1:\n\n    for i in range(19):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            l=j^1<<i\n\n            if k^(l<j)and l<n:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nprint(*reversed(a))\n\nHmm, this seems like an incomplete code. \n\nThe problem is to fill in the missing code. \n\nWait, the code given in program2.py is:\n\na=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n\nn=len(a)\n\nfor k in 0,1:\n\n    for i in range(19):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            l=j^1<<i\n\n            if k^(l<j)and l<n:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nprint(*reversed(a))\n\nHmm, this code is trying to do something with the a array, but it's not clear what. \n\nThe problem requires us to compute the a array as per the steps above. \n\nThe current code reads the B array into a, then does some loops with bit operations, then reverses and prints. \n\nBut according to our analysis, the correct a array is computed as follows:\n\nThe desired a array is:\n\nres = [0]*n \n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    res[i] = a[n-1 -i] \n\nres[-1] = a[0] ^ (xor of res[0..n-2])\n\nThen, output res. \n\nThus, the code should compute this. \n\nBut the given code has loops with bit operations. Perhaps the code is trying to compute the XOR of the first n-1 elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array using some bitwise operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be rewritten. \n\nBut the problem says that we need to complete the code in program2.py. \n\nThe code given has a loop structure that may be trying to compute the a array using some bitwise operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a bitwise approach to compute the a array. \n\nWait, the code's loops are for k in 0,1; for i in 0..18 (since range(19)), and for j in 0..n-1. \n\nThe variable l is computed as j ^ (1<<i). \n\nThe condition is k ^ (l < j) and l <n. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is a way to compute the a array using bitwise operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array as the reverse of the B array, but with some adjustments. \n\nWait, the final line is print(*reversed(a)). \n\nIf the code is supposed to output the a array computed as per our steps, then the current code is not doing that. \n\nThe correct a array is computed as follows:\n\nThe desired a array is:\n\na[0] = B_{n} \n\na[1] = B_{n-1} \n\n... \n\na[n-2] = B_2 \n\na[n-1] = B_1 XOR (a[0] ^ a[1] ^ ... ^ a[n-2])\n\nThus, the code should compute this. \n\nThe current code reads the B array into a, then does some loops, then reverses and prints. \n\nReversing the B array would give a[0] = B_n, a[1] = B_{n-1}, etc. \n\nBut the last element would be B_1. \n\nBut the desired a array's last element is B_1 XOR (XOR of the first n-1 elements). \n\nThus, the current code's approach of reversing the B array is not correct. \n\nThus, the code needs to be modified. \n\nThe problem requires us to fill in the missing code in program2.py. \n\nThe code given has a loop structure that may be trying to compute the XOR of the first n-1 elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a bitwise approach to compute the a array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array as the reverse of the B array, but with the last element adjusted. \n\nLet me think of the correct steps in code:\n\nThe desired a array is:\n\nres = [0]*n \n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    res[i] = a[n-1 -i] \n\nxor_sum = 0 \n\nfor x in res[:n-1]:\n\n    xor_sum ^=x \n\nres[-1] = a[0] ^ xor_sum \n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nThus, this is the correct code. \n\nBut the given code has loops with bit operations. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the XOR of the first n-1 elements using bitwise operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a Fenwick tree or some other structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a bitwise approach to compute the a array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array as the reverse of the B array, but with the last element adjusted. \n\nThe current code's final line is print(*reversed(a)), which would output the B array reversed. \n\nBut that's not correct. \n\nThus, the missing code must be the part that computes the a array correctly. \n\nThe code given has a loop structure that may be trying to compute the a array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a bitwise approach to compute the a array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array as follows:\n\nThe desired a array is the reverse of the B array, except for the last element. \n\nWait, the reverse of B array would give a[0] = B_n, a[1] = B_{n-1}, ..., a[n-1] = B_1. \n\nBut the desired a array's last element is B_1 XOR (XOR of first n-1 elements). \n\nThus, the code needs to compute the reverse of B array, then set the last element to B_1 XOR (XOR of first n-1 elements). \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\na = list of B array \n\nres = a[::-1] \n\nxor_sum = 0 \n\nfor x in res[:-1]:\n\n    xor_sum ^=x \n\nres[-1] = a[0] ^ xor_sum \n\nprint(' '.join(map(str,

adjust the last element. \n\nThus, the missing code in program2.py is to compute the last element. \n\nLooking at the code given:\n\nThe code has a loop with k in 0,1, and i in 0..18, and j in 0..n-1. \n\nThe line l = j ^ (1<<i) \n\nThe condition is k ^ (l <j) and l <n \n\nPerhaps this is a way to compute the XOR of the first n-1 elements using bitwise operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the XOR of the first n-1 elements using some bitwise trick. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array using some bitwise operations, but it's not

code reads the B array into a. \n\nThen, for k in 0,1 (maybe for some reason), and for i in 0 to 18 (bits up to 1<<18?), and for each j, compute l = j ^ (1<<i). \n\nThe condition is k ^ (l <j) and l <n. \n\nThen, perhaps the code is trying to compute the XOR of the elements in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array using some bitwise XOR operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array as the reverse of the B array, but with some adjustments. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the a array as
