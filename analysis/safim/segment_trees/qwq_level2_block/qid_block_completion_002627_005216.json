But how does this fit into the segment tree's structure? Alternatively, the variables might be for a different approach. Looking at the code's _reclac function: \n\ndef _reclac(self, x):\n\n    self.v0[x] = 0\n\n    self.v1[x] = 0\n\n    self.v2[x] = 0\n\n    if self.active[x*2]:\n\n        self.v0[x] += self.v0[x*2]\n\n        self.v1[x] += self.v1[x*2]\n\n        self.v2[x] += self.v2[x*2]\n\n    if self.active[x*2+1]:\n\n        self.v0[x] += self.v0[x*2+1]\n\n        self.v1[x] += self.v1[x*2+1]\n\n        self.v2[x] += self.v2[x*2+1] So the v0, v1, v2 are the sum of the children's values. The _push function is handling the lazy propagation. The _push function for when up is False (when the lazy is being applied) has: \n\ndef _push(self, x, l, r):\n\n    la = self.lazy[x]\n\n    if la ==0: return \n\n    if l ! = r: \n\n        self.v2[x*2] = self.v2[x*2] + 2 * la * self.v1[x*2] + la * la * self.v0[x*2]\n\n        self.v1[x*2] += la * self.v0[x*2]\n\n        self.v2[x*2+1] = self.v2[x*2+1] + 2 * la * self.v1[x*2+1] + la * la * self.v0[x*2+1]\n\n        self.v1[x*2+1] += la * self.v0[x*2+1]\n\n        self.lazy[x*2] += la \n\n        self.lazy[x*2+1] += la \n\n    self.lazy[x] =0 \n\nWait , this suggests that the lazy value represents some kind of delta that affects the counts. The code for the else part (when up is False) in the update function subtracts 1 from the lazy, and adjusts v1 and v2. The variables v0, v1, v2 are being updated in a way that suggests that the lazy is a delta that affects the counts. The variables v0, v1, v2 are for the current node's segment. The _push function is propagating the lazy value down to the children. The key is to figure out what the variables represent. Looking at the variables in the _push function: \n\nWhen the lazy is applied (la is non-zero), the code for the left child (x*2) is: \n\nv2[x*2] += 2 * la * v1[x*2] + la^2 * v0[x*2]\n\nv1[x*2] += la * v0[x*2]\n\nSimilarly for the right child. This suggests that the variables are being updated based on the current v0 and v1. The formula for v2's update is 2 * la * v1 + la^2 * v0. The formula for v1's update is la * v0. This looks like the formula for adding la points to the segment. Suppose that the lazy value represents the number of points added to the segment. Wait, perhaps the variables are for the number of points, pairs, and triples in the segment. Let me think: Suppose v0 is the number of points in the segment. v1 is the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j in the segment. v2 is the number of triples (i,j,k) with i < j < k in the segment. Then, when you add 'la' points to the segment, how do these values change? Adding 'la' points would contribute: \n\nThe new points form pairs with existing points: The new pairs are la * v0 (each new point pairs with existing v0 points). The new pairs between the new points themselves would be C(la, 2) = la*(la-1)/2. Wait, but the formula in the code for v1's update is v1 += la * v0.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to find the special array k and the number of operation2 uses on it. The key here is understanding how the operations affect the arrays. \n\nLet me think about the operations. For non-special arrays (operation1), each operation on c_i subtracts 1 from positions i and j (between 2 and m-1), and adds 1 to i-1 and j+1. For the special array (operation2), the operation subtracts 1 from i and j (up to m-2), and adds to i-1 and j+2. \n\nThe main idea is that the original array b is transformed into each c_i via these operations. Since all c_i started as copies of b, the difference between each c_i and b must be accounted for by the operations applied. \n\nThe critical observation is that each operation on a non-special array (operation1) affects certain positions in a way that can be tracked, and similarly for the special array's operation2. The key is to find which array's differences can only be explained by operation2's steps, and the count of those steps.\n\nLet me think of the effect of each operation on the array. Let's model the difference from the original array b. Let\u2019s denote delta_i as the array c_i minus b. \n\nFor a non-special array (operation1), each operation1 applied to it contributes a certain delta. Let's see: each operation1 on positions i and j subtracts 1 from c[i] and c[j], adds 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+1]. So the delta for that operation would be: +1 at i-1, -1 at i, -1 at j, +1 at j+1. \n\nSimilarly, for operation2 on the special array, each operation2 on positions i and j would subtract 1 from i and j, add 1 to i-1 and j+2. So delta here is +1 at i-1, -1 at i, -1 at j, +1 at j+2. \n\nThe problem requires that for each array except the special one, they use operation1 at least once, and the special one uses operation2 at least once. \n\nThe key is to find for each array, the possible number of operation2 steps (if it's the special one) and see which array's delta can be explained by that. \n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let's think of the total effect of all operations on each array. \n\nSuppose the special array is k. Then, for all other arrays, their deltas are built from some number of operation1 steps. The special array's delta is built from some number of operation2 steps. \n\nThe problem is to find which array's delta can be expressed as a sum of operation2 steps, and the others as operation1 steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute for each array the possible number of operation2 steps, but only one of them will fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some invariant that can be tracked. Let me think of the sum of certain positions. \n\nLet me think of the effect of each operation on the sum of the array. Since each operation (both types) moves 1 from two positions to two others, the total sum remains the same. So the sum of each c_i must equal the sum of b. But since all started as copies of b, that's already true. So that doesn't help. \n\nHmm. Maybe looking at some other invariant. Let's think of the differences between certain positions. \n\nLet me consider the difference between adjacent elements. For example, for operation1 on positions i and j (non-special array):\n\nThe operation affects positions i-1, i, j, j+1. The changes are +1 at i-1, -1 at i, -1 at j, +1 at j+1. \n\nSo the difference between i-1 and i would increase by 2 (since i-1 increases by 1, i decreases by 1 \u2192 (i-1) - i becomes (original difference) + 2). \n\nSimilarly, the difference between j and j+1 would decrease by 2 (since j decreases by 1, j+1 increases by 1 \u2192 (j - (j+1)) becomes (original difference) -2). \n\nWait, maybe looking at the differences between consecutive elements can help. Let me denote the array as c, and let\u2019s look at the differences between consecutive elements: d[i] = c[i] - c[i-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps considering the second differences? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the effect of each operation on the array's second differences. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find for each array, some invariant that must hold based on the type of operations applied. \n\nLet me think of the effect of operation1 and operation2 on the array's elements. \n\nSuppose for a non-special array (operation1), each operation contributes a certain delta vector. Let me model the total delta for each array. \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each array c_i, the delta from b is D_i = c_i - b. \n\nFor non-special arrays (other than k), their D_i is the sum of some number of operation1 steps. Each operation1 step contributes a vector like (0,..., +1 at i-1, -1 at i, -1 at j, +1 at j+1, 0...). \n\nThe sum of all these steps must equal D_i. \n\nFor the special array (k), its D_k is the sum of some number of operation2 steps. Each such step contributes (0,..., +1 at i-1, -1 at i, -1 at j, +1 at j+2, 0...). \n\nThe problem is to find which array's D can be expressed as a combination of operation2 steps, and the others as operation1 steps. \n\nHmm. Let me think of the difference between the arrays. Since all started as copies of b, the sum of all D_i must be zero? Wait no, because each operation on a c_i affects only that array. So the sum over all c_i's D_i would be zero? Because each operation on a c_i only affects that array. So yes, the total sum of all D_i must be zero. But that's probably not directly helpful here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a certain linear combination that can be used to find the special array. \n\nLet me think of the effect of each operation on the array's elements. Let me consider the sum over all elements multiplied by some coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the differences between certain positions. Let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose for each array, we compute some value that depends on the operations applied. \n\nLet me consider the following: \n\nFor operation1, each step contributes a certain pattern. Let me see the effect on the array's elements. \n\nSuppose in an operation1 on positions i and j (for a non-special array), the changes are: \n\nc[i-1] +=1 \n\nc[i] -=1 \n\nc[j] -=1 \n\nc[j+1] +=1 \n\nThe net effect on the array is that the total sum remains the same. \n\nNow, for the special array's operation2, each step on i and j: \n\nc[i-1] +=1 \n\nc[i] -=1 \n\nc[j] -=1 \n\nc[j+2] +=1 \n\nSo the difference between the two operations is that in operation2, the j+2 term is increased instead of j+1. \n\nHmm. Let me think of the difference between the two operations. \n\nSuppose I look at the difference between the j+1 and j+2 elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the difference between elements two apart. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose for each array, we compute the sum over all elements multiplied by their position. Let me see how each operation affects this. \n\nLet me denote S = sum_{x=1 to m} (x * c[x]). \n\nFor operation1 on positions i and j: \n\nThe changes are: \n\n+1 at i-1 \u2192 contributes + (i-1) \n\n-1 at i \u2192 contributes -i \n\n-1 at j \u2192 contributes -j \n\n+1 at j+1 \u2192 contributes + (j+1) \n\nTotal change: (i-1 -i) + (j+1 -j) \u2192 (-1) + (1) \u2192 0. \n\nSo operation1 doesn't change S. \n\nFor operation2 on positions i and j: \n\nThe changes are: \n\n+1 at i-1 \u2192 (i-1) \n\n-1 at i \u2192 -i \n\n-1 at j \u2192 -j \n\n+1 at j+2 \u2192 (j+2) \n\nTotal change: (i-1 -i) + (j+2 -j) \u2192 (-1) + 2 \u2192 +1. \n\nSo each operation2 increases S by 1. \n\nAh! That's a crucial observation. \n\nSo the total change in S for the special array is exactly the number of operation2 steps. \n\nBut how does this help us? \n\nWait, the original array b has a certain S_b. Each c_i's S is S_b plus the sum of the changes from their operations. \n\nFor non-special arrays (operation1), their operations don't change their S. So their S_i = S_b. \n\nFor the special array, each operation2 increases its S by 1. So S_k = S_b + x, where x is the number of operation2 steps. \n\nTherefore, the difference between S_k and S_b is exactly x. \n\nBut how do we compute S_b? \n\nWait, all non-special arrays have S_i = S_b. So for all arrays except the special one, their S_i must be equal. The special array's S is higher by x. \n\nTherefore, the array with S_i different from the majority must be the special one, and the difference between its S and the others' S gives x. \n\nSo the plan is: \n\n1. For each array, compute S_i = sum_{pos=1 to m} (pos * c_i[pos]). \n\n2. Find which array has an S_i different from the others. That array is the special one. \n\n3. The difference between its S and the common S (from non-special arrays) is the number of operation2 steps. \n\nWait, but how do we know which S is the correct one? Because all non-special arrays have S_i = S_b, so the majority of the arrays (all except one) should have the same S. The one with a different S is the special array. \n\nTherefore, the steps are: \n\n- For each test case, compute S_i for all arrays. \n\n- Find the array whose S_i is different from the others. That's k. \n\n- The difference between its S and the common S is x. \n\nThis seems manageable. \n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases. For example, if all arrays have the same S, but that's impossible because the special array must have a different S. \n\nWait, the problem states that the input is generated according to the procedure, so there must be exactly one array with a different S. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is straightforward. \n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently. \n\nThe constraints are tight: n can be up to 1e5, m up to 3e5, and the sum of n*m across test cases is up to 1e6. \n\nCalculating S_i for each array is O(m) per array, so total O(n*m) per test case, which should be acceptable given the constraints. \n\nSo in code: \n\nFor each test case: \n\nRead n and m. \n\nRead the n arrays. \n\nCompute for each array its S_i. \n\nFind which array has a different S. \n\nThe difference between that S and the common S is x. \n\nThen output the index (1-based) of that array and x. \n\nWait, but how do we find the common S? \n\nWe can compute all S_i, then find the mode (the value that occurs most often). Since all but one are the same, the mode is the common S. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute the first two S values. If they are equal, then the common S is that value, and we look for the one that differs. If they are different, then check the third one to see which of the first two is the common one. \n\nBut for large n, it's better to just compute all S_i and then find the one that is different. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, storing all S_i in a list is manageable. \n\nOnce we have the list of S_i, we can loop through them to find which one is different. \n\nAlternatively, we can track the counts. \n\nLet me think of the steps in code: \n\nRead n and m. \n\nThen read n arrays. For each array, compute S_i as sum( (pos+1)*c for pos, c in enumerate(array) ). Wait, wait, the positions are 1-based? The problem says the arrays are c_{i,1}, c_{i,2}, ..., c_{i,m}. So the first element is position 1, second 2, etc. \n\nSo for each array, the elements are in a list like c = [c1, c2, ..., cm]. \n\nThen S_i is sum( (i+1)*c[i] for i in 0..m-1 )? Wait no, because the first element is position 1. So for the list c, the first element is at position 1, so the index in the list is 0. \n\nWait, in code, if the array is stored as a list like arr, then for position 1, it's arr[0], position 2 is arr[1], etc. So the correct way is: \n\nfor each element in the array, the position is (index +1). \n\nThus, S_i = sum( (idx+1)*val for idx, val in enumerate(arr) )\n\nYes. \n\nOnce all S_i are computed, we can find which one is different. \n\nTo do this efficiently, we can: \n\n- Check the first S value. \n\n- Compare with the second. If they are the same, then that's the common value. Then loop through all S_i to find the one that differs. \n\n- If the first two are different, then check the third. Whichever of the first two matches the third is the common value. \n\nAlternatively, just collect all S_i in a list, then loop through them to see which one occurs only once. \n\nBut for n up to 1e5, looping through all S_i once to count frequencies is O(n), which is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, here's a method: \n\nCompute the first S value. \n\nThen, iterate through the rest, keeping track of the current candidate. \n\nInitialize common_S as the first S. \n\ncount = 1 \n\nThen for each next S in S_list[1:]:\n\n   if S == common_S: count +=1 \n\n   else: \n\n      if count > 1: \n\n          # the different one is the current S, so the common is common_S \n\n          break \n\n      else: \n\n          # now we have two different values, so need to see \n\n          # perhaps the common is the next one \n\n          # so set common_S to the new S, and count becomes 1 \n\n          # but this may not work if the first was the special one \n\n          # Hmm, this approach may not work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, let's collect all S_i in a list. \n\nThen, if the majority is the first element, then the different one is the one that is not equal to the first. \n\nWait, but the majority is all except one. So, if the first element is part of the majority, then the different one is the only one not equal to it. \n\nElse, the first is the different one, and the majority is the rest. \n\nSo, here's a plan: \n\nCompute all S_i into a list. \n\nCheck if S[0] == S[1]. \n\nIf yes, then the common_S is S[0], and we can loop through the list to find the one that is different. \n\nIf not, then check S[2]. \n\nIf S[2] == S[0], then common_S is S[0], and the different one is S[1]. \n\nIf S[2] == S[1], then common_S is S[1], and the different one is S[0]. \n\nOnce we have the common_S, then loop through all S_i to find the index where S_i != common_S. \n\nThis is O(n) time. \n\nThis should be manageable. \n\nOnce we have the index (1-based) of the differing S_i, that's k. \n\nThe x is (S_i - common_S). Because each operation2 increases S by 1, so the difference is exactly the number of operations. \n\nSo that's the plan. \n\nNow, coding this in Python. \n\nThe code for program1.py would be: \n\nRead t test cases. \n\nFor each test case: \n\nRead n and m. \n\nThen read n lines, each with m numbers. \n\nCompute S for each array. \n\nFind the array with S different from others. \n\nOutput its 1-based index and (S_i - common_S). \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nThe code skeleton given is: \n\nt,=R() \n\nfor _ in range(t): \n\n  # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe R function is defined as R=lambda:map(int,input().split())\n\nSo for each test case: \n\nRead n and m: \n\nn, m = R() \n\nThen read n arrays. \n\nWe can read each array as a list. \n\nThen compute S for each array. \n\ns_list = [] \n\nfor _ in range(n): \n\n    arr = list(R()) \n\n    s = 0 \n\n    for idx in range(m): \n\n        s += (idx+1)*arr[idx] \n\n    s_list.append(s) \n\nWait, but for m up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, this would be O(n*m) which is 3e10 operations? Wait no, the sum over all test cases of n*m is 1e6. So that's manageable. \n\nWait the problem says \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n\u22c5m over all test cases does not exceed 1e6\". So the total operations are acceptable. \n\nSo the code for program1 is manageable. \n\nNow, the code for program2.py is the other problem. \n\nLooking at program2.py's code, it's a segment tree implementation for counting beautiful triples. \n\nThe problem is to process queries adding/removing points and compute the number of beautiful triples (i<j<k, k-i <=d). \n\nThe code provided is a segment tree approach, but the user needs to fill in the TODO in the update function for when up is True. \n\nLooking at the code: \n\nThe SegmentTree class has a method update, which when up is True (adding a point?), needs to be filled. \n\nThe current code for the update function has: \n\ndef update(self, x, l, r, a, b, up: bool):\n\n    if r < a or b < l:\n\n        return\n\n    if a <= l and r <= b:\n\n        if up:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        else:\n\n            self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] - 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n\n            self.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\n\n            self.lazy[x] -= 1\n\n        return\n\n    m = (l + r) // 2\n\n    self._push(x, l, r)\n\n    self.update(x*2, l, m, a, b, up)\n\n    self.update(x*2+1, m+1, r, a, b, up)\n\n    self._reclac(x)\n\nThe variables v0, v1, v2 are stored in the segment tree nodes. \n\nThe problem is to figure out what to do when up is True. \n\nLooking at the else part (when up is False), it subtracts 1 from the lazy, and adjusts v1 and v2. \n\nThe variables v0, v1, v2 probably represent some counts. \n\nThe problem's solution requires maintaining the number of triples. \n\nThe approach here is likely using a segment tree to track the number of points in certain ranges and compute the triples efficiently. \n\nThe variables v0, v1, v2 might represent the number of points, pairs, or triples in a segment. \n\nLooking at the code's comments and structure, perhaps v0 is the count of points, v1 the number of pairs, and v2 the number of triples? Or some other combination. \n\nAlternatively, the variables might represent the number of points (v0), the number of pairs (v1), and the number of triples (v2). \n\nThe code's _reclac function combines the left and right children's values. \n\nIn the else clause (when up is False), the code subtracts 2*v1[x] and adds v0[x] to v2, and subtracts v0 from v1. \n\nThis suggests that when a point is removed (up is False), the effect on the counts is being adjusted. \n\nThe TODO is for when up is True (adding a point). \n\nThe code for the else part (when up is False) seems to be handling the case where a point is removed from the interval [a, b]. \n\nWait, the update function is called with a and b as the range. \n\nWait, the update function is part of the segment tree's logic. The set_state function is used to toggle the presence of a point. \n\nThe update function might be used to propagate some effect when a point is added or removed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables v0, v1, v2 are for a segment [l, r], and represent: \n\nv0: the number of points in the segment. \n\nv1: the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j in the segment. \n\nv2: the number of triples (i,j,k) with i < j < k in the segment. \n\nBut then combining two segments would require combining their counts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are for a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the variables might be for a different way of counting. \n\nAlternatively, the variables could be for the number of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples in a way that allows combining. \n\nAlternatively, the variables might be for the number of points (v0), the number of pairs (v1), and the number of triples (v2). \n\nWhen a point is added, the effect on the counts would be: \n\nAdding a new point at position x would contribute to pairs and triples with existing points. \n\nBut the segment tree might be structured in a way that allows this. \n\nAlternatively, the variables might be for a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the variables could be for the number of points in the segment, and the variables v1 and v2 are for some other counts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are for the number of points (v0), the number of points to the left (v1?), and something else. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using a different approach where the variables represent the number of points, and the number of pairs and triples in a way that can be combined with a lazy propagation. \n\nAlternatively, the variables v0, v1, v2 might represent the count of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples in the segment. \n\nWhen a point is added, the v0 increases by 1. The v1 would increase by the number of existing points (since each existing point forms a new pair with the new one). The v2 would increase by the number of existing pairs (since each existing pair forms a new triple with the new point). \n\nBut how does this fit into the segment tree's structure? \n\nAlternatively, the variables might be for a different approach. \n\nLooking at the code's _reclac function: \n\ndef _reclac(self, x):\n\n    self.v0[x] = 0\n\n    self.v1[x] = 0\n\n    self.v2[x] = 0\n\n    if self.active[x*2]:\n\n        self.v0[x] += self.v0[x*2]\n\n        self.v1[x] += self.v1[x*2]\n\n        self.v2[x] += self.v2[x*2]\n\n    if self.active[x*2+1]:\n\n        self.v0[x] += self.v0[x*2+1]\n\n        self.v1[x] += self.v1[x*2+1]\n\n        self.v2[x] += self.v2[x*2+1]\n\nSo the v0, v1, v2 are the sum of the children's values. \n\nThe _push function is handling the lazy propagation. \n\nThe _push function for when up is False (when the lazy is being applied) has: \n\ndef _push(self, x, l, r):\n\n    la = self.lazy[x]\n\n    if la ==0: return \n\n    if l != r: \n\n        self.v2[x*2] = self.v2[x*2] + 2 * la * self.v1[x*2] + la * la * self.v0[x*2]\n\n        self.v1[x*2] += la * self.v0[x*2]\n\n        self.v2[x*2+1] = self.v2[x*2+1] + 2 * la * self.v1[x*2+1] + la * la * self.v0[x*2+1]\n\n        self.v1[x*2+1] += la * self.v0[x*2+1]\n\n        self.lazy[x*2] += la \n\n        self.lazy[x*2+1] += la \n\n    self.lazy[x] =0 \n\nWait, this suggests that the lazy value represents some kind of delta that affects the counts. \n\nThe code for the else part (when up is False) in the update function subtracts 1 from the lazy, and adjusts v1 and v2. \n\nThe variables v0, v1, v2 are being updated in a way that suggests that the lazy is a delta that affects the counts. \n\nThe variables v0, v1, v2 are for the current node's segment. \n\nThe _push function is propagating the lazy value down to the children. \n\nThe key is to figure out what the variables represent. \n\nLooking at the variables in the _push function: \n\nWhen the lazy is applied (la is non-zero), the code for the left child (x*2) is: \n\nv2[x*2] += 2 * la * v1[x*2] + la^2 * v0[x*2]\n\nv1[x*2] += la * v0[x*2]\n\nSimilarly for the right child. \n\nThis suggests that the variables are being updated based on the current v0 and v1. \n\nThe formula for v2's update is 2 * la * v1 + la^2 * v0. \n\nThe formula for v1's update is la * v0. \n\nThis looks like the formula for adding la points to the segment. \n\nSuppose that the lazy value represents the number of points added to the segment. \n\nWait, perhaps the variables are for the number of points, pairs, and triples in the segment. \n\nLet me think: \n\nSuppose v0 is the number of points in the segment. \n\nv1 is the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j in the segment. \n\nv2 is the number of triples (i,j,k) with i < j < k in the segment. \n\nThen, when you add 'la' points to the segment, how do these values change? \n\nAdding 'la' points would contribute: \n\nThe new points form pairs with existing points: \n\nThe new pairs are la * v0 (each new point pairs with existing v0 points). \n\nThe new pairs between the new points themselves would be C(la, 2) = la*(la-1)/2. \n\nWait, but the formula in the code for v1's update is v1 += la * v0. \n\nHmm, that suggests that the new pairs are only between the new points and existing ones, not between the new points themselves. \n\nWait, perhaps the variables are not exactly the counts but something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables are for the number of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples, but the way they are updated is through the lazy propagation. \n\nAlternatively, the variables might be for the number of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples in a way that allows the lazy to represent an additive delta. \n\nSuppose that when you add 'la' points to the segment, the new v0 becomes v0 + la. \n\nThe new v1 would be v1 + v0 * la + (la choose 2). \n\nThe new v2 would be v2 + v1 * la + (v0 choose 1) * (la choose 2) + (la choose 3). \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the variables might be for the number of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples, but the way the lazy is applied is through some formula. \n\nLooking at the code's _push function: \n\nWhen applying a lazy value 'la', the v1 and v2 are updated as follows: \n\nv1 += la * v0 \n\nv2 += 2 * la * v1 + la^2 * v0 \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the current v0 is the number of points in the segment. \n\nThen, adding 'la' points would contribute to v1 as follows: \n\nEach new point forms a pair with each existing point (v0 * la), plus pairs among the new points (la*(la-1)/2). \n\nBut the code's v1 is being increased by la * v0, which is only the cross terms. \n\nHmm, perhaps the variables are not exactly the counts but something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables are for the number of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples, but the way they are updated is through the formula in the _push function. \n\nThe formula for v1's update is v1 += la * v0. \n\nThe formula for v2's update is v2 += 2 * la * v1 + la^2 * v0. \n\nLet me see what this represents. \n\nSuppose that the current v0 is the number of points, v1 is the number of pairs, and v2 is the number of triples. \n\nWhen adding 'la' points, the new pairs would be: \n\nexisting pairs (v1) plus new pairs between existing and new (v0 * la) plus new pairs among the new (la choose 2). \n\nBut the code's v1 is being increased by la * v0, which is only the cross terms. \n\nHmm, perhaps the variables are not exactly the counts but something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables are for the number of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples, but the way they are updated is through the formula in the _push function. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are for the number of points, the number of pairs, and the number of triples in a way that allows the lazy to represent an
