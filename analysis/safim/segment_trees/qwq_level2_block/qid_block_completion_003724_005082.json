The centroid is a vertex whose removal leaves all subtrees with size at most (n-1)/2. The input is n (odd), and the output is n numbers mod 998244353. The code provided is incomplete. Let's look at the code structure. The code starts with defining modmul, which is a function for modular multiplication. The current code has:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe modmul function is supposed to compute (x * y + c) mod MOD. Because in modular arithmetic, when you have a = (x*y + c) mod MOD. So the function should return (x * y + c) % MOD. Wait, but the parameters are x, y, c. So the function is supposed to compute (x*y + c) mod MOD. Thus, the code for modmul is:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c=0):\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nWait, but in Python, the parameters are x, y, c with default 0. So the function should return (x*y + c) mod MOD. So that's the first missing part. Next, the code has precomputed fact and invfact arrays up to MAX (1e6). Then, the code defines comb and invcomb functions. The problem is to compute for each i, the number of trees where i is the centroid. The code's current approach seems to be using some combinatorial formulas. Looking at the code's variables:\n\nThe code initializes fact and invfact arrays.",

The number of such trees is n^{n-2} by Cayley's formula, but here the structure is constrained such that each node's parent has a smaller index. So the number of such trees is indeed n^{n-2}? Or is it different? Wait, Cayley's formula counts the number of trees on n labeled vertices, which is n^{n-2}. But here, the trees are counted in a way where the parent of each node (except root) must have a smaller index. So the number of such trees is exactly n^{n-2}, since each node except the root can choose its parent among the nodes with smaller indices. Wait, no. For each node from 2 to n, the parent can be any of the nodes with smaller indices. So the total number is product_{i=2 to n} (i-1) ) = (n-1)! Wait, that's different. Because for node 2, there's 1 choice (parent 1). For node 3, 2 choices (1 or 2). For node 4, 3 choices, etc. So total is 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) ) = (n-1)! Wait, that's correct.

                                                                            "text": "Wait, but in the example given in the problem's note, the first team uses players 4 and 6 (assuming those are the 100 and 100?), but in the example given, the sum is 200>180. So in that case, the required k is 2. So in the example, the code would have to form that team. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again. Wait, in the problem's note example, the first team has two players with max 100. So the required k is (180//100)+1 = 1+1=2. So when the count reaches 2, we can form a team. So in the example where the array is [100, 90, 100, 80, 90, 100], sorted as [80,90,90,100,100,100], then processing from the end:\n\ni=5 (100). count=1. k_needed is 2. Not enough. i=4 (100). count becomes 2. Now, since count >=2, days +=1, count resets to 0. Then i=3 (100). count becomes 1. Not enough. i=2 (90). count becomes 2. k_needed is (180//90)+1 =2+1=3. 2 <3, so no. \n\ni=1 (90). count becomes3. Now, 3 >=3, so days +=1 (total 2). i=0 (80). count becomes1. k_needed is (180//80)+1 =2+1=3. 1 <3. So total days would be 2. But in the note example, they formed two teams. So that's correct. Hmm, so the approach seems to work here. Another example: Let's say D=3, and the array is [2,2]. Sorted as [2,2]. Processing from the end:\n\ni=1 (2). count=1. k_needed is (3//2)+1 =1+1=2. Not enough. i=0 (2). count becomes 2. Now, count >=2, so days +=1. Total days is 1. Which is correct because 2*2=4>3. Another test case: D=5, array [3,3,3]. Each team needs k = (5//3)+1 =1+1=2. Processing:\n\ni=2 (3). count=1. Not enough. i=1 (3). count=2. So days +=1, count reset to 0. i=0 (3). count=1. Not enough. Total days 1. But the total players used are 2, leaving one. Can't form another team. Correct. Another case: D=5, array [3,3,3,3]. Processing:\n\ni=3 (3). count=1. k_needed 2. Not enough. i=2 (3). count=2 \u2192 days +=1, reset. i=1 (3). count=1. i=0 (3). count=2 \u2192 days +=1. Total 2. Which is correct: two teams of 2 each. So the approach seems to work. Therefore, the code in program1.py should be: Sort the array, then iterate from the end, keeping track of the current count. Whenever the count reaches the required k for the current element, increment days and reset count.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is about forming basketball teams to maximize the number of wins against an enemy with power D. The key here is understanding how to form the teams optimally. The description says that when a team plays, each player's power becomes the maximum in the team. So the total power of the team is (number of players in team) * (max power in team). We need this total to be > D for a win.\n\nThe approach here is probably greedy. Since we want as many teams as possible, each team should be as small as possible but still sufficient to beat D. Let's think: For a given max power P, the minimal number of players needed is ceil(D / P) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the total is (count)*max_p > D. So the minimal count required for a team with max_p is ceil(D / max_p) + 1? Wait, let's see. Let me think: Let's say the max_p is m. Then the required count is the smallest k where k*m > D. So k must be at least floor(D/m) + 1. So for a given m, the minimal number of players needed is (D // m) + 1, but only if m > D/(k). Hmm, but since m is the maximum in the team, the team can have any number of players as long as at least one has m, and the total is k*m > D. So the minimal number of players needed for a team with max m is ceil(D/m) + 1? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose m is the max. Then the minimal k is the smallest integer where k * m > D. So k must be at least floor(D/m) + 1. For example, if D is 180 and m is 100, then 100*2 = 200 > 180, so k=2. So yes, (180//100) is 1, so 1+1=2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the strategy is to sort the players in non-decreasing order. Then, we process from the largest to the smallest. Because using the largest possible first allows us to form as many teams as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we proceed? Let me think of the algorithm:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, we can start from the end (the largest elements) and try to form as many teams as possible.\n\nThe idea is to collect players starting from the largest, and whenever we have enough to form a team (i.e., the current max is m, and the number of players collected so far is at least k = (D // m) + 1), then we can form a team, increment the count, and remove those players. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, iterate from the end (the largest elements first). For each element P[i], we can see how many teams can be formed with this as the maximum. Wait, but maybe it's better to process in a way that whenever we have a current maximum, we can form as many teams as possible with that maximum.\n\nAlternatively, here's a standard greedy approach for such problems:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, we can iterate from the end (the largest elements) and try to form teams. Let's see:\n\nInitialize days = 0. We have the sorted list. Let's process the elements in reverse order (so starting from the largest). We can keep track of how many players we have so far. For each element P[i], which is the current maximum (since the list is sorted), we can check if adding this to the current count allows forming a team. Wait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nWe need to form teams such that each team's max is the largest possible. Let me think of the algorithm as follows:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, we can go from the end, and for each element, decide whether to include it in a team. The key is that each team must have a maximum of at least m, so the team's total is k * m > D. So for each m (the current element), the minimal required players is k = floor(D/m) + 1. Wait, but m must be the maximum in the team, so the team can consist of this m plus (k-1) other elements (which can be any elements with power <= m). But to maximize the number of teams, we need to use as few players as possible per team. So for each m, the minimal k is (D//m) +1. So for a given m, if we can form a team with k players (including at least one m), then that's better than using a smaller m.\n\nHence, the optimal approach is to process the elements in order from largest to smallest, and whenever possible, form a team with the current m as the maximum, using the minimal required players (k) for that m. But how do we track this?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible algorithm:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, we can iterate from the end (the largest elements first). Let's keep a pointer starting at the end. For each position i, we can check how many players are needed to form a team with the current maximum (P[i]). The required number is k = (D // P[i]) + 1. If there are at least k players available (including this one), then we can form a team. But how do we track the available players?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to process the array in reverse, and for each element, decide whether to use it as part of a team. Let me think of the following steps:\n\nInitialize days = 0. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let's have a pointer starting at the end (index n-1). We can iterate from the end towards the start. For each position i, we can check if the current element can be part of a team. The minimal number of players needed for a team with max P[i] is k = (D // P[i]) +1. If the number of players from i down to some position is at least k, then we can form a team here. But how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, iterate from the end, and for each element P[i], check if the current count of players (starting from the end) is sufficient to form a team with this as the maximum. Let's see:\n\nInitialize days =0, and a variable 'count' which tracks how many players we have so far. We start from the end. For each i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n- add 1 to count (since we include this player)\n- check if count >= k, where k is (D // P[i]) +1. Because P[i] is the current maximum (since sorted), so the team's max is P[i]. So the required k is (D//P[i])+1. \n\nWait, but if count reaches exactly k, then we can form a team. So whenever count reaches k, we can increment days by 1, and reset count to 0 (since those players are used in the team). \n\nWait, but this might not be the case. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the current element is P[i], and the current count is the number of players we've considered so far (starting from the end). So when we process P[i], we add it to the count. Then, if the count reaches k (the minimal required for this P[i]), then we can form a team, so days +=1, and reset the count to 0. Because those k players form a team, and can't be used again.\n\nWait, but the count is the number of players we have so far. So for example, when processing P[i], we add 1 to count. Then, if count >= k, then we can form a team, so days +=1, and subtract k from the count (or reset count to 0, but need to track properly). Wait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nInitialize count =0, days=0.\n\nWe iterate from the end (i from n-1 downto 0):\n\ncount +=1\n\nk_needed = (D // P[i]) +1\n\nif count >= k_needed:\n\n    days +=1\n\n    count =0  # because we used all the current count players to form this team.\n\nWait, but this might not be correct. Because the k_needed is based on the current P[i], which is the maximum in the team. So the team must consist of exactly k_needed players, all of which have at most P[i], and at least one has P[i]. But in this approach, when we process P[i], the count is the number of players from i to the end (since we are going backward). So when count reaches k_needed, we can form a team, and then reset the count. \n\nWait, let's see an example. Suppose D is 180, and the array is [10, 20, 30, 90, 100]. Sorted as [10,20,30,90,100]. Let's process from the end:\n\nStart with i=4 (100). count becomes 1. k_needed is (180//100)+1 = 1+1=2. Since count (1) <2, so no team yet. \n\nNext i=3 (90). count becomes 2. k_needed is (180//90)+1 = 2+1=3. 2 <3, so no. \n\ni=2 (30). count becomes 3. k_needed is (180//30)+1 =6+1=7. 3 <7, so no. \n\ni=1 (20). count becomes4. k_needed is (180//20)+1=9+1=10. 4 <10, no. \n\ni=0 (10). count becomes5. k_needed is (180//10)+1=18+1=19. 5 <19, so no. \n\nSo days remains 0. But that's not correct. Wait, but in the example given in the problem's note, the first team uses players 4 and 6 (assuming those are the 100 and 100?), but in the example given, the sum is 200>180. So in that case, the required k is 2. So in the example, the code would have to form that team. \n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the problem's note example, the first team has two players with max 100. So the required k is (180//100)+1 = 1+1=2. So when the count reaches 2, we can form a team. \n\nSo in the example where the array is [100, 90, 100, 80, 90, 100], sorted as [80,90,90,100,100,100], then processing from the end:\n\ni=5 (100). count=1. k_needed is 2. Not enough. \n\ni=4 (100). count becomes 2. Now, since count >=2, days +=1, count resets to 0. \n\nThen i=3 (100). count becomes 1. Not enough. \n\ni=2 (90). count becomes 2. k_needed is (180//90)+1 =2+1=3. 2 <3, so no. \n\ni=1 (90). count becomes3. Now, 3 >=3, so days +=1 (total 2). \n\ni=0 (80). count becomes1. k_needed is (180//80)+1 =2+1=3. 1 <3. \n\nSo total days would be 2. But in the note example, they formed two teams. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the approach seems to work here. \n\nAnother example: Let's say D=3, and the array is [2,2]. \n\nSorted as [2,2]. \n\nProcessing from the end:\n\ni=1 (2). count=1. k_needed is (3//2)+1 =1+1=2. Not enough. \n\ni=0 (2). count becomes 2. Now, count >=2, so days +=1. \n\nTotal days is 1. Which is correct because 2*2=4>3. \n\nAnother test case: D=5, array [3,3,3]. \n\nEach team needs k = (5//3)+1 =1+1=2. \n\nProcessing:\n\ni=2 (3). count=1. Not enough. \n\ni=1 (3). count=2. So days +=1, count reset to 0. \n\ni=0 (3). count=1. Not enough. \n\nTotal days 1. But the total players used are 2, leaving one. Can't form another team. Correct. \n\nAnother case: D=5, array [3,3,3,3]. \n\nProcessing:\n\ni=3 (3). count=1. k_needed 2. Not enough. \n\ni=2 (3). count=2 \u2192 days +=1, reset. \n\ni=1 (3). count=1. \n\ni=0 (3). count=2 \u2192 days +=1. \n\nTotal 2. Which is correct: two teams of 2 each. \n\nSo the approach seems to work. \n\nTherefore, the code in program1.py should be:\n\nSort the array, then iterate from the end, keeping track of the current count. Whenever the count reaches the required k for the current element, increment days and reset count. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nimport math\nenemy_power=int(input().split()[1])\nteam=[int(i) for i in input().split()]\nteam.sort()\ndays=0\nwhile len(team)>0:\n    num=enemy_power//team[-1]+1\n    if len(team)<num:\n        break;\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\nprint(days)\n\nHmm, the current code is using a while loop, but perhaps the approach is different. Let me see. The code is trying to process the team array by removing elements each time. \n\nWait, the code's approach is:\n\nIn each iteration of the while loop, it takes the largest element (team[-1]). Then computes num = D//team[-1] +1. So that's the required number of players for a team with this max. \n\nIf the current team has at least num players, then we can form a team. So we take the last num elements (since the array is sorted), remove them, and increment days. \n\nWait, but the code is in a loop where it removes elements each time. Let me see:\n\nThe code's logic is:\n\nWhile the team is not empty:\n\n- Take the largest element (team[-1]).\n\n- Compute the required number of players (num) for a team with this max.\n\n- If the current team has at least num players, then we can form a team. So we remove the last num elements (since they are the largest ones, so their max is team[-1], and the team can be formed with those num players. \n\n- So days +=1, and the team is now team[:-num].\n\n- Else, break (can't form any more teams).\n\nWait, but this approach may not be optimal. Because maybe there are smaller elements that can be combined with some of the larger ones to form more teams. \n\nWait, let's see with the first example in the problem's note. \n\nSuppose the input is N=6, D=180, and the P array is [100, 90, 100, 80, 90, 100]. \n\nAfter sorting, the array is [80,90,90,100,100,100]. \n\nThe code's first iteration:\n\nteam has 6 elements. The largest is 100. \n\nnum = 180//100 +1 \u2192 1+1=2. \n\nSince 6 >=2, so we form a team of 2 players (the last two 100s?), but wait, the team is the last two elements (the two 100s?), but actually the last two elements are the last two 100s. So the team is those two, which gives a total of 200>180. \n\nThen days becomes 1, and the team is now [80,90,90,100,100]. \n\nNext iteration:\n\nThe largest is 100 again. \n\nnum is 2 again. \n\nThe team has 5 elements. 5 >=2 \u2192 yes. \n\nTake the last two (the two 100s?), so now the team becomes [80,90,90,100]. \n\nDays is now 2. \n\nNext iteration: largest is 100. \n\nnum is 2. The team has 4 elements. \n\nTake last two (the 100 and the previous 90?), wait no. Wait the array after previous steps is [80,90,90,100]. The last two are 90 and 100? Wait no, the array is sorted, so the last element is 100. The last two elements are 90 and 100? Wait no, the array after first step was [80,90,90,100,100] \u2192 after removing last two (the two 100s?), the array becomes [80,90,90,100]. \n\nWait, the next step's team is [80,90,90,100]. The largest is 100. \n\nnum is 2. So take the last two elements (the 90 and 100?), but the last two are 90 and 100? Wait no, the array is sorted, so the last element is 100, the second last is 90. So the last two are 90 and 100. \n\nWait, but the team's max is 100. So the team can be formed with those two, but the sum would be 100*2 = 200>180. So that's okay. \n\nSo days becomes 3. \n\nWait, but in the problem's note example, the first team uses two players (4 and 6?), but the second team uses three players (1,2,5). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is not considering that sometimes using a smaller max can allow more teams. \n\nWait, in the problem's note example, the second team has a max of 90. The required players for that is (180//90)+1 = 2+1=3. So they need 3 players. \n\nIn the code's approach, after the first three steps (forming three teams of two 100s each), the remaining array would be [80,90,90]. \n\nThen, the next iteration:\n\nThe largest is 90. \n\nnum = 180//90 +1 \u2192 2+1=3. \n\nThe current team has 3 elements. So yes, form a team of 3. \n\nDays becomes 4. \n\nBut in the note example, the total is 2 wins. So the code's approach would overcount here. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, the note example's input must be different. Let me check the note again. \n\nThe note says:\n\nIn the first team, players 4 and 6 (assuming their power is 100 each?), so sum 200>180. \n\nSecond team has players 1,2,5 (their power sum to 90*3=270>180). \n\nTotal two wins. \n\nBut according to the code's approach, the code would form three teams of two 100s (if there are 6 players with three 100s?), but in the note's example, perhaps the array has three 100s. \n\nWait, let me see the note's example:\n\nThe note says the first team has players 4 and 6 (so two players with max 100). The second team has three players with max 90. \n\nSo the total is two teams. \n\nBut according to the code's approach, the code would form three teams: \n\nFirst two 100s \u2192 team 1. \n\nNext two 100s \u2192 team 2. \n\nThen the third 100 and the next 90 \u2192 team 3 (but that's two players, but the max is 100, so required is 2. So yes. \n\nWait, but in the note's example, the total players are 6. So the code would form 3 teams of two each (using all 6 players), giving 3 wins. But the note's example only has two. \n\nHmm, that's a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the note's example. Let me read it again. \n\nThe note says:\n\nThe first team is players 4 and 6 (so two players, sum 200>180). \n\nThe second team is players 1,2,5 (three players, max 90, so sum 270>180). \n\nTotal two teams. \n\nSo the total players used are 5. So there must be one player left unused. \n\nWait, perhaps the array has 6 players, but the code's approach would take all 6 into three teams of two each, but that's three wins. But the note's example only has two. \n\nHmm, so the code's approach is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nSo the problem is that the code's approach greedily takes as many teams as possible using the largest elements first, but this may not be optimal. \n\nWait, in the note's example, the code's approach would form three teams (each of two players with 100), but the note's example uses two teams (one with two 100s and another with three 90s). \n\nWait, but in that case, the code's approach would give a better answer (3 wins vs 2). But the note's example's answer is two. \n\nWait, that can't be. The problem's note says that the example's answer is two. So the code's approach must be wrong. \n\nHmm, so there's a mistake in my understanding. \n\nWait, perhaps the note's example is not the maximum possible. \n\nWait, the problem says \"determine the maximum number of wins\". So in the note's example, the code's approach would give three wins, which is better than the note's example's two. \n\nBut the note's example is just an example of possible teams, not the maximum. \n\nAh, right! The note is just an example of how the teams can be formed, not necessarily the maximum. So the code's approach may be correct. \n\nWait, in the note's example, the maximum possible is three? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the players are [100, 100, 100, 90, 90, 80]. \n\nThen, the code's approach would form three teams of two 100s each. \n\nEach team's total is 200>180. So three wins. \n\nThat's better than the note's example's two. \n\nSo the note's example is not the maximum. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct. \n\nSo the code's approach is to, in each step, take the largest possible element, compute the minimal required players (num) for a team with that max, and if there are enough players, form a team of the last 'num' players. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is correct. \n\nBut in the code provided, the code is in a while loop. The problem is in the 'else' block. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nwhile len(team) >0:\n\n    num = enemy_power // team[-1] +1\n\n    if len(team) < num:\n\n        break\n\n    else:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(days)\n\nWait, the code is missing the part where it removes the last 'num' elements. \n\nSo the missing code in the else block is to:\n\n- increment days by 1\n\n- remove the last 'num' elements from the team list. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\ndays +=1\n\nteam = team[:-num]\n\nWait, but in Python, list slicing with team[:-num] would take all elements except the last 'num' elements. \n\nWait, for example, if the team has 6 elements and num is 2, then team[:-2] would leave the first 4 elements. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the missing code in program1 is:\n\ndays +=1\n\nteam = team[:-num]\n\nSo the code in the else block is:\n\ndays +=1\n\nteam = team[:-num]\n\nThus, the program1's missing code is those two lines. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to compute for each vertex i in a tree with n (odd) vertices, the number of trees where i is the centroid. \n\nThe centroid is a vertex whose removal leaves all subtrees with size at most (n-1)/2. \n\nThe input is n (odd), and the output is n numbers mod 998244353. \n\nThe code provided is incomplete. Let's look at the code structure. \n\nThe code starts with defining modmul, which is a function for modular multiplication. The current code has:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe modmul function is supposed to compute (x * y + c) mod MOD. Because in modular arithmetic, when you have a = (x*y + c) mod MOD. \n\nSo the function should return (x * y + c) % MOD. \n\nWait, but the parameters are x, y, c. So the function is supposed to compute (x*y + c) mod MOD. \n\nThus, the code for modmul is:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c=0):\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nWait, but in Python, the parameters are x, y, c with default 0. So the function should return (x*y + c) mod MOD. \n\nSo that's the first missing part. \n\nNext, the code has precomputed fact and invfact arrays up to MAX (1e6). \n\nThen, the code defines comb and invcomb functions. \n\nThe problem is to compute for each i, the number of trees where i is the centroid. \n\nThe code's current approach seems to be using some combinatorial formulas. \n\nLooking at the code's variables:\n\nThe code initializes fact and invfact arrays. \n\nThen, for each i in range((n+1)//2), it computes a 'base' as fact[n-1], and 'frac' as modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute some combinatorial terms. \n\nThe problem requires counting the number of trees where the i-th vertex is the centroid. \n\nThe note's example 1 has n=3. The answer is [1,1,0]. \n\nThe code's current approach may have some errors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is following a certain formula. \n\nThe problem's solution requires understanding the number of trees where a given vertex is the centroid. \n\nThe centroid must be such that when removed, all components have size \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nFor a tree with n vertices (odd), the centroid is the middle vertex. \n\nWait, but the problem states that the tree is constructed such that each node i (for i>1) has exactly one parent with a smaller index. So the tree is a rooted tree where the root is 1, and each node's parent has a smaller index. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"for each 2 \u2264i \u2264n, the i-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index.\" So the tree is a rooted tree with root 1, and edges are directed from parent to child, but the tree is undirected. \n\nThe number of such trees is n^{n-2} by Cayley's formula, but here the structure is constrained such that each node's parent has a smaller index. So the number of such trees is indeed n^{n-2}? Or is it different? \n\nWait, Cayley's formula counts the number of trees on n labeled vertices, which is n^{n-2}. But here, the trees are counted in a way where the parent of each node (except root) must have a smaller index. So the number of such trees is exactly n^{n-2}, since each node except the root can choose its parent among the nodes with smaller indices. \n\nWait, no. For each node from 2 to n, the parent can be any of the nodes with smaller indices. So the total number is product_{i=2 to n} (i-1) ) = (n-1)! \n\nWait, that's different. Because for node 2, there's 1 choice (parent 1). For node 3, 2 choices (1 or 2). For node 4, 3 choices, etc. So total is 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) ) = (n-1)! \n\nWait, that's correct. Because each node after the first has exactly (number of previous nodes) choices. So the total is (n-1)! \n\nWait, but Cayley's formula says n^{n-2} trees. So this is a different count. \n\nAh, right. The problem's trees are those where the parent of each node (except root) is chosen from the nodes with smaller indices. So the number of such trees is (n-1)! \n\nBecause for each node from 2 to n, the parent can be any of the nodes 1..i-1. So the total is product_{i=2 to n} (i-1) ) = (n-1)! \n\nSo the total number of trees is (n-1)! \n\nNow, the problem requires for each vertex i, the number of such trees where i is the centroid. \n\nThe centroid must satisfy that when removed, all connected components have size \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nSince n is odd, (n-1)/2 is an integer. \n\nThe centroid must be such that all its children's subtrees plus the remaining part (if any) are \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nAlternatively, the centroid must be in the middle of the tree. \n\nPerhaps the centroid must be the middle node (since n is odd). \n\nWait, but the problem allows any tree structure. \n\nHmm, perhaps the number of trees where vertex i is the centroid depends on the position of i. \n\nThe approach in the code seems to be using some combinatorial formulas. \n\nLooking at the code's current code:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n\n    base = fact[n -1]\n\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nThen, there's a rem variable and some processing. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each position i (up to the middle), the number of trees where the centroid is at position i. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the fact that the centroid must be in the first half (since n is odd). \n\nWait, the code's loop runs for i in range((n+1)//2). For example, when n=3, (3+1)//2 is 2, so i runs 0 and 1. \n\nThe out array is initialized to size n, so perhaps the code is only filling the first half and then mirroring it? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using some symmetry. \n\nThe problem requires the answer for each vertex. \n\nThe code's current approach may have errors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the centroid must be one of the middle nodes. \n\nWait, for a tree with n nodes (odd), the centroid must be the node such that when removed, all components have size \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nThe centroid is the middle node in the tree's structure. \n\nBut how to count the number of trees where a particular node is the centroid. \n\nPerhaps the key idea is that the centroid must be a node such that all its branches have size at most (n-1)/2. \n\nSuppose the node i is the centroid. Then, the tree must be structured such that all of its children's subtrees have size \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nThe total number of nodes excluding i is n-1. So the sum of the sizes of the children's subtrees plus the remaining part (if any) must be n-1. \n\nWait, but when you remove i, the tree splits into several components, each being a subtree of one of its children. \n\nThus, each of those components must have size \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nThe total of all those components is n-1. \n\nSo the maximum size of any component is \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nHence, the sum of all components is n-1, and each component is \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nThe only way this can happen is if all components are exactly \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nThus, the largest component must be exactly (n-1)/2. \n\nWait, because if all components are \u2264 (n-1)/2, then the sum can be up to k*( (n-1)/2 ), but since the total is n-1, which is (n-1) = (n-1)/2 + (n-1)/2. \n\nThus, the only way this can happen is if there are exactly two components of size (n-1)/2, but since n is odd, (n-1)/2 is an integer. \n\nWait, but n is odd, so n-1 is even. So (n-1)/2 is an integer. \n\nWait, for example, n=5: (5-1)/2 = 2. \n\nSo the components must be such that each is \u22642. \n\nThe total is 4. \n\nSo possible splits are like 2+2, or 2+1+1, etc. \n\nThus, the centroid can be any node where its children's subtrees are all \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of trees where node i is the centroid is equal to the number of ways to partition the remaining n-1 nodes into subtrees each of size at most (n-1)/2, and then multiply by the number of ways to arrange the tree structure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached using combinatorics and dynamic programming. \n\nBut given the code provided, perhaps the correct way is to look at the code's structure and see what's missing. \n\nThe code's modmul function is missing. \n\nThe code's modmul function is supposed to compute (x*y + c) mod MOD. \n\nSo the first missing part is the modmul function. \n\nThe second part is the rest of the code. \n\nLooking at the code's current code:\n\nThe code has:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the first missing part is the modmul function's body. \n\nThe second missing part is perhaps in the code's logic. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe problem for program2 is to complete the code. \n\nThe code's modmul function is the first missing part. \n\nThe rest of the code may have other missing parts, but according to the problem's description, the user provided the code with missing lines or blocks. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program2.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\nMAX = 10 ** 6\n\nfact = [1]\nfor i in range(1, MAX):\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\ninvfact = [1] * (MAX)\ninvfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\nfor i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\n    invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\ndef comb(x, y):\n    return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\ndef invcomb(x, y):\n    return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]))\n\ndef invs(x):\n    return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\nn = int(input())\n\nout = [0] * n\n\nfor i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n    base = fact[n -1]\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n    \n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nrem = 0   \nfor i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n    oldrem = rem\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n    out[i] -= oldrem\n    \n    rem %= MOD\n    out[i] %= MOD\n    \nprint(' '.join(map(str,out)))\n\nThe problem is that the modmul function is not implemented. \n\nSo the missing code for program2 is the modmul function's body. \n\nThus, the modmul function should return (x*y + c) mod MOD. \n\nSo the code for modmul is:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c=0):\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the modmul function's return statement. \n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nFor program1, the missing code in the else block is:\n\ndays +=1\n\nteam = team[:-num]\n\nFor program2, the missing code is the modmul function's body. \n\nThus, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"days +=1\\n    team = team[:-num]\",\n    \"program2\": \"return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}\n\nWait, but the modmul function is inside the program2's code. So the missing part is the return statement. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the final answer is as above."
