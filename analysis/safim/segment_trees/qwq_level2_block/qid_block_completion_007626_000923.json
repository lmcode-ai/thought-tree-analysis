The input for each test case is read as an integer a. Wait, but the input is a string of six digits. Oh right, because if the user inputs something like \"012345\", converting to an integer would drop leading zeros. That's a problem because the ticket can have leading zeros.

But according to the problem's fifth test case explanation, the example fifth test case is \"BRB\" which is contiguous. The example given in the problem's fifth test case's explanation is \"BRB\", which is valid. The example \"BRWBR\" would require the non-W to be separated by a W, which would be invalid. Thus, the conditions would be:\n\n- The non-W characters form an alternating sequence. - All non-W are contiguous (no W between them). This would solve the R W B case. But what about a case like \"BRBR\" \u2192 contiguous and alternating \u2192 valid. Another example: \"BWB\" \u2192 non-W are B and B, which are not alternating \u2192 invalid. The example \"BRW\" \u2192 non-W are B R \u2192 contiguous \u2192 valid. Wait, \"BRW\" has non-W as B R (contiguous), so it's valid. But how to form it? Initial: WWW. Apply stamp on 0-1 \u2192 BR W \u2192 which is the desired string. Yes, that works. The case \"RWB\" \u2192 non-W are R and B, but separated by W \u2192 thus non-contiguous \u2192 invalid. Thus, the conditions are:\n\n1. The non-W characters form an alternating sequence (no two same in a row). 2. All non-W characters are contiguous (no W between them). Thus, the algorithm is:\n\nCollect the non-W characters into a list. Check that this list is alternating (no two same in a row). Also, check that in the original string, all non-W are consecutive (i.e., there are no W's between them). Thus, the steps are:\n\nFor a given string s:\n\n- Find the first and last occurrence of non-W characters. - Check that between these indices, all characters are non-W. \n\n- Also, the non-W list must alternate between R and B. If all these conditions are met \u2192 YES, else NO. This would handle the cases. Let me test this with previous examples:\n\nExample R W B \u2192 first non-W is 0 (R), last is 2 (B).

The test cases are read from the input. The current code is trying to loop over the input lines, but the way it's written may be incorrect. The problem's input format is:\n\nThe first line is t. Then for each test case: \n\n- a line with n. \n\n- a line with the string s. \n\nThus, the input lines are: \n\nt \n\nn1 \n\ns1 \n\nn2 \n\ns2 \n\n... Thus, the lines are: \n\nlines[0] = t \n\nlines[1] = n1 \n\nlines[2] = s1 \n\nlines[3] = n2 \n\nlines[4] = s2 \n\netc. Thus, the test cases' data are every two lines after the first.",

But since the user's code for program2.py is only that line, the missing code is the entire processing. Therefore, the final answer for the two programs is:\n\nFor program1.py: The missing code is changing a = int(input()) to a = input().strip(), fixing the condition, and the else clause. The code for program1.py's missing parts are:\n\nIn the loop:\n\na = input().strip()\n\nThen the condition:\n\nif (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n\nThen the else clause's print(\"NO\"). Thus, the code for program1's missing parts are: The line a = input().strip() instead of a = int(input()), and the condition and else clause. The original code's if condition is wrong, so it must be replaced. The else clause must have print(\"NO\"). Thus, the complete code for program1.py is:\n\ns = int(input())\nfor _ in range(s):\n    a = input().strip()\n    if (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is the changes to the a variable and the condition. The original code had:\n\na = int(input()) if a // 100000 + ... \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is replacing that line with a = input().strip() and the condition. The else clause's code is print(\"NO\"). Thus, the JSON for program1 is the code for the loop's a assignment and the condition and else. For program2.py, the missing code is the entire processing loop. The original code's line is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe correct code replaces this with the proper loop and processing.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to determine if a ticket is lucky, meaning the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three. The given code has some issues. Let's look at the code provided.\n\nThe code starts by reading s as an integer, which is the number of test cases. Then it loops over each test case. The input for each test case is read as an integer a. Wait, but the input is a string of six digits. Oh right, because if the user inputs something like \"012345\", converting to an integer would drop leading zeros. That's a problem because the ticket can have leading zeros. So the code is wrong here. Instead of reading a as an integer, it should be read as a string. \n\nLooking at the condition: the current code uses a (the integer) to compute the digits. For example, a//100000 gives the first digit, but if the input had leading zeros, converting to integer would lose those. So that's definitely a mistake. The correct approach is to process the string directly. \n\nSo the fix for program1.py would involve changing the input line to read a string instead of an integer. Then, split the string into the first three and last three characters, sum their digits, and compare. \n\nThe current code's condition is: \n\nif a // 100000 + a // 10000 %10 + a//1000%10 == ... \n\nWait, let's see. Let's take a as the integer. For example, if the input is \"213132\", then a is 213132. \n\nFirst term: a//100000 is 2 (since 213132 divided by 100000 is 2.13132 \u2192 integer division gives 2). \n\nNext term: a//10000 %10 \u2192 213132//10000 is 21, mod 10 gives 1. \n\nThird term: a//1000 %10 \u2192 213 (213132//1000 is 213) mod10 is 3. So first three digits sum to 2+1+3=6. \n\nThen the right side: a//100%10 \u2192 2131 (213132//100 is 2131) mod10 is 1. Then a%10 is 2. And a//10%10 \u2192 21313 (213132//10 is 21313.2 \u2192 21313) mod10 is 3. So 1+3+2 =6. So that works for this case. \n\nBut if the input has leading zeros, like \"045207\", converting to integer a would be 45207, which is 5 digits. So the code would miscalculate. For example, the first digit would be 4 (since 45207//10000 is 4.5207 \u2192 4), but the actual first digit is 0. So this approach is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct way is to read the input as a string, then take the first three characters and last three, convert each to integers, sum them, and compare. \n\nSo in program1.py, the line where a is read as an integer should be changed to a string. So instead of a = int(input()), it should be a = input().strip()\n\nThen, the condition should be:\n\nsum_first = int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])\nsum_last = int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])\nif sum_first == sum_last: print(\"YES\") else: print(\"NO\")\n\nBut looking at the existing code's condition, perhaps the code can be adjusted without variables. Let me see the current code's condition:\n\nThe current condition is written as:\n\nif a // 100000 + (a // 10000 %10) + (a//1000%10) == (a//100%10) + (a%10) + (a//10%10):\n\nWait, let's parse each term:\n\nFirst three digits:\n\ndigit1 = a // 100000 \u2192 first digit.\n\ndigit2 = (a // 10000) %10 \u2192 second digit.\n\ndigit3 = (a//1000) %10 \u2192 third digit.\n\nSum of first three: digit1 + digit2 + digit3.\n\nLast three digits:\n\ndigit4 = (a // 100) %10 \u2192 fourth digit (since a is the full 6-digit number, but when converted to integer, leading zeros are lost, so this is wrong).\n\nWait, the last three digits would be the 4th,5th,6th digits. \n\nThe code's right side:\n\ndigit4 is (a//100 %10) \u2192 a//100 is the number divided by 100, so for 213132, a//100 is 2131, mod10 gives 1 (the 4th digit). \n\ndigit5 is a%10 \u2192 the 6th digit (since mod10 gives last digit). \n\ndigit6 is (a//10 %10) \u2192 a//10 is 21313, mod10 gives 3 (the 5th digit). \n\nWait, so the code's right side is adding digits 4,6,5? Because:\n\nWait, the code's right side is:\n\na//100%10 \u2192 digit4,\n\na%10 \u2192 digit6,\n\na//10%10 \u2192 digit5. \n\nSo the sum is digit4 + digit5 + digit6, but the code's right side is digit4 + digit6 + digit5, which is correct. \n\nBut the problem is that when the input has leading zeros, converting to integer a would lose those leading zeros, so the digits are miscalculated. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to read the input as a string, then take the first three and last three characters. \n\nSo in program1.py, the missing code is:\n\nFirst, change a = int(input()) to a = input().strip()\n\nThen, the condition can be written as:\n\nif (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n\nSo the code in the if statement should be adjusted. \n\nLooking at the existing code's if condition, it's using a as an integer, which is wrong. So the code's current condition is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py needs to be fixed by changing how a is read and the condition. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nif a // 100000 + a // 10000 % 10 + a // 1000 % 10 == a // 100 % 10 + a % 10 + a // 10 % 10:\n\nBut this is wrong because a is an integer. So the correct code would be to read a as a string, then compute the sum as the first three and last three digits. \n\nSo the code for program1.py should have:\n\nIn the loop over s test cases:\n\na = input().strip()  # instead of a = int(input())\n\nThen the condition:\n\nif (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n\nThen print \"YES\" else \"NO\".\n\nBut in the existing code, the else clause has a comment TODO. The current code's else block is:\n\nelse:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code currently has the if block printing \"YES\" with end=\" \", but the problem requires each test case's output to be on a separate line. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the if block, it's print(\"YES\", end=\" \"), but the else is not handled. So the code is incomplete. \n\nWait, the code as given is:\n\nif condition:\n    print(\"YES\", end=\" \")\nelse:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the else part is missing. The correct code should print \"NO\" in the else case, and each output should be on a new line. \n\nWait, the problem says to output t lines, each being YES or NO. So the current code's print in the if has end=\" \" which would append a space, but that's wrong. The end should be a newline. \n\nWait, the code's current if clause is:\n\nprint(\"YES\", end=\" \")\n\nSo after that, the next output would be on the same line. That's incorrect. The correct approach is to print \"YES\" or \"NO\" followed by a newline. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif condition:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the else block is print(\"NO\").\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrections for program1.py are:\n\nChange a = int(input()) to a = input().strip()\n\nChange the condition to use the string's characters.\n\nAnd fix the print statements to have proper newlines and handle the else case.\n\nSo the code for program1.py would be:\n\ns = int(input())\nfor _ in range(s):\n    a = input().strip()\n    sum_first = int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])\n    sum_last = int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])\n    if sum_first == sum_last:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nAlternatively, the condition can be written inline without variables. \n\nSo the missing parts in the original code are:\n\nIn the line where a is read, replace a = int(input()) with a = input().strip()\n\nThen, in the if condition, replace the current expression with the correct sum of the first three and last three digits. \n\nThe original code's if condition is using a as an integer, so that's wrong. So the code's if line must be changed. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py's missing parts are:\n\nIn the line where a is read, change to a = input().strip()\n\nThen, the condition should be:\n\nif (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n\nThen, the else clause should have print(\"NO\").\n\nSo the code for program1.py's missing parts are:\n\nThe first change is in the a = ... line. The original code had a = int(input()), so that line must be replaced with a = input().strip()\n\nThen, the if condition must be changed. The original code's condition is incorrect, so that line must be replaced with the correct condition. \n\nThe else block's TODO must be replaced with print(\"NO\").\n\nSo the code for program1.py's missing parts are:\n\nIn the code:\n\nOriginal lines:\n\na = int(input())\n\nif a // 100000 + a // 10000 % 10 + a // 1000 % 10 == a // 100 % 10 + a % 10 + a // 10 % 10:\n\nelse:\n\nThe missing code is replacing a = int(input()) with a = input().strip()\n\nThen, the condition line must be replaced with the correct condition. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be adjusted as follows:\n\nThe code's current if line is using a as an integer, so that's wrong. So the entire if condition must be rewritten. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py's missing parts are:\n\nThe line where a is read must be changed to a string. \n\nThe condition must be written using the string's characters. \n\nThe else clause must print \"NO\".\n\nSo the code for program1's missing parts are:\n\nIn the code:\n\nOriginal code:\n\na = int(input())\n\nif [current condition]:\n\nelse:\n\nThe missing code is:\n\nChange a = int(input()) to a = input().strip()\n\nChange the if condition to check the sum of first three and last three digits of the string.\n\nThe else clause must have print(\"NO\").\n\nSo the code for program1's missing parts are:\n\nThe first line in the loop:\n\na = input().strip()\n\nThen, the condition:\n\nif (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n\nThen, the else clause's code is print(\"NO\").\n\nSo putting it all together, the code for program1.py would be:\n\ns = int(input())\nfor i in range(s):\n    a = input().strip()  # changed from int(input())\n    if (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is replacing the a = int(input()) line and the if condition, and adding the else's print.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to determine if a given string of R, B, W can be formed by stamping pairs of adjacent cells, where each stamp changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects exactly two adjacent cells. The initial state is all W. \n\nThe code given for program2.py is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nHmm, the code is incomplete. The problem requires processing each test case. Let's think about the approach.\n\nThe key is to model the process of applying the stamps and see if the target string can be achieved. \n\nFirst, note that each stamp affects exactly two adjacent cells. Each application can turn two W's into RB or BR, but also can overwrite existing colors. \n\nThe problem allows applying the stamp multiple times, even on the same pair. \n\nThe key observation here is that every pair of adjacent non-white cells must form either RB or BR. Because whenever you apply a stamp on two cells, they become either RB or BR. However, since you can apply the stamp multiple times, perhaps the order matters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that all non-white cells form pairs of adjacent R and B in some way. \n\nWait, let's think of the final string. Let's consider the positions where the characters are not W. \n\nSuppose there is a sequence of non-W characters. For example, if there is a single non-W character, that's impossible because each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So any non-W must come in pairs? Or perhaps not, but let's see.\n\nWait, the stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells. Each application changes both cells to either R and B or B and R. So, for example, if a cell is already R, applying a stamp over it and its neighbor could change it again. \n\nBut the problem is to see if the final string can be achieved through any number of such operations. \n\nLet me think of some examples. \n\nTest case 7 in the notes says that if the string is all W, then the answer is YES (since zero stamps are used). \n\nAnother example: the fifth test case in the notes is \"BRB\". The example's explanation shows that it can be achieved. \n\nLet me think of possible constraints. \n\nFirst, any occurrence of a single non-W character (R or B) must be part of a pair. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So, for instance, if there's an isolated R or B not adjacent to another non-W, then it's impossible. \n\nWait, but the stamp can be applied over two W's, turning them into RB or BR. So, for example, if the target has a single R followed by a B, that's possible. But if there's a single R with no adjacent non-W, then that's impossible. \n\nWait, let's think of a string like \"R\". The length is 1. Since you can't apply any stamp (needs two cells), so the only possible string is all W. So if the input is \"R\" with n=1, the answer is NO. \n\nAnother example: \"RB\". This can be achieved by one stamp. So answer is YES. \n\nWhat about \"BR\"? Also possible. \n\nWhat about \"RR\"? Let's see. To get two R's adjacent. \n\nSuppose you first stamp the two cells as RB. Then, stamp them again. The first application gives RB. The second application can be done in reverse. For example, applying the stamp as BR over the same two cells would turn them into BR again. Wait, no. Wait, each stamp can choose the direction. \n\nWait, each stamp application can choose to set the two cells to either RB or BR. So, for example, to get RR, perhaps it's impossible. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the two cells are initially WW. \n\nFirst stamp: set to RB. \n\nSecond stamp on the same pair, choosing BR: then they become BR again. \n\nAlternatively, can you get RR? \n\nHmm, no. Because each stamp must set the two cells to either RB or BR. So you can't have two R's in a row. \n\nTherefore, any occurrence of two R's in a row would be impossible. Similarly for two B's. \n\nWait, but what about overlapping stamps? \n\nWait, let's think of a longer string. Suppose the target is \"RBR\". \n\nFirst, apply stamp on positions 0-1 to get RBW. Then apply on positions 1-2 to get RBR. So that's possible. \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n- All non-W characters must form pairs where each pair is either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but how exactly? \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must satisfy that every non-W character is part of a pair with its neighbor. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that every non-W character must be adjacent to another non-W character. Because each stamp affects two cells, so any non-W must be part of a pair. \n\nWait, but the stamp can be applied over two W's, turning them into RB or BR. So each non-W must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nWait, but if there's a single non-W, like a single R, then that's impossible. \n\nSo the first condition is that the number of non-W characters must be even? Or not necessarily? \n\nWait, no. Because each stamp adds two non-W's (since they were W before). But you can also apply the stamp over existing non-W's. \n\nWait, for example, if you have a pair RB, and you apply the stamp again on them as BR, then they become BR again. So the count remains the same. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W characters must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W characters are either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but that might not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that any two consecutive non-W characters must form either RB or BR. \n\nWait, let's think of the string \"BRB\". \n\nThe first two are BR, the next two are RB. So that's okay. \n\nAnother example: \"RBR\". The first two are RB, the next two are BR. \n\nBut what about \"BRRB\"? \n\nThe first two are BR, then RR. The RR is invalid. So that can't be formed. \n\nSo the condition is that between any two non-W characters, they must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire sequence of non-W characters must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, the example given in the problem's fifth test case is \"BRB\", which alternates B-R-B. \n\nAnother example: \"BRBRB\" would be okay. \n\nBut what about \"BRRB\"? The middle RR is invalid. \n\nSo the key is that in the entire string, any two consecutive non-W characters must be either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but what about non-consecutive non-W characters? \n\nSuppose the string is \"BRWBR\". The non-W parts are BR and BR, separated by a W. That's okay. \n\nSo the condition is that every pair of adjacent non-W characters must form RB or BR. \n\nWait, but the W's can be in between. \n\nWait, the problem allows the stamp to be applied anywhere, so the non-W parts can be separated by W's. \n\nWait, but the non-W parts must form pairs in their own sequences. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must not have any occurrence of two identical non-W characters in a row. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The string cannot have two consecutive R's or two consecutive B's. \n\nBecause each stamp application can only create RB or BR pairs. \n\nWait, but if you have a pair like RB, and then apply a stamp on the second and third cell (which is W), turning them into RB, then the sequence becomes RBR. Which has R followed by B followed by R. That's okay. \n\nWait, but in that case, the first and third characters are R and R, but separated by a B. So they are not consecutive. \n\nSo the key is that any two consecutive non-W characters must alternate between R and B. \n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n1. The string must not have two consecutive R's or two consecutive B's. \n\n2. Additionally, the entire string must be achievable through some sequence of stamp applications. \n\nWait, but how do we check that? \n\nWait, the first condition is necessary because each stamp can only create RB or BR pairs. So any two consecutive non-W must be RB or BR. \n\nBut the second condition is that the entire string can be formed by overlapping such pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the first condition is sufficient. \n\nLet me think of some test cases. \n\nTest case where the string is \"RBR\" \u2192 satisfies the condition (no two same in a row). So answer is YES. \n\nTest case \"RR\" \u2192 two R's \u2192 answer is NO. \n\nTest case \"BWB\" \u2192 the two B's are separated by a W. So they are not consecutive, so allowed. \n\nWait, but how can that be formed? \n\nLet's see: the target is B W B. \n\nThe initial is WWW. \n\nFirst, apply stamp on positions 0-1 to get BR W. \n\nThen, apply stamp on positions 1-2 to get B R B. \n\nWait, but that would give BRB. \n\nHmm, but the target is B W B. \n\nWait, that's not possible. Because after the first stamp, positions 0-1 are BR. Then, applying a stamp on positions 1-2 (which is R and W) would turn them into either RB or BR. \n\nWait, the second stamp on positions 1-2 (R and W) would turn them into either RB or BR. \n\nIf we choose BR, then the result would be B (position0), then B (position1?), no. Wait, let me think:\n\nOriginal after first stamp: positions 0 is B, 1 is R, 2 is W. \n\nApplying a stamp on positions 1-2 (R and W) as BR would set them to B and R. So the string becomes B B R. \n\nAlternatively, choosing RB would set them to R and B \u2192 B R B. \n\nSo the target B W B can't be achieved. \n\nAh, so the first condition (no two same consecutive non-W) is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so there's another condition. \n\nWait, the problem allows applying the stamp multiple times, but each application must be on two adjacent cells. \n\nAnother idea: the entire string must be such that all non-W characters form a sequence where each pair of adjacent non-W characters alternate between R and B, and also the entire sequence of non-W must form a path where each step is either R followed by B or B followed by R. \n\nAdditionally, the non-W characters must form a \"chain\" that can be built by overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must have all non-W characters form a sequence where every two non-W characters are separated by an even number of W's? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W characters must form a sequence where each pair of adjacent non-W in the entire string must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, in the example \"BWB\", the non-W are B and B, which are separated by a W. So they are not adjacent, so their order doesn't matter. But the problem is that the two B's can't be formed without having them adjacent at some point. \n\nWait, in the example of \"BWB\", the two B's are separated by a W. To get that, you can do:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1: B R W \u2192 then, stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R B \u2192 but that gives BRB. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp on 0-1 to get BR W. Then stamp on 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R W again? No, because each stamp must choose either RB or BR. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's impossible to get BWB. \n\nSo the target BWB would have two B's separated by a W. But how can that be formed? \n\nLet me think of another approach. \n\nEach stamp application changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that every non-W character must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nBut since the stamps can be applied multiple times, perhaps the non-W characters can be in any positions as long as they form a valid alternating sequence. \n\nWait, but in the case of BWB, the two B's are not adjacent, so they can be formed by two separate stamps. \n\nFirst, apply a stamp on positions 0-1 to get BR W. \n\nThen, apply a stamp on positions 1-2 to get B R B. \n\nBut that gives BRB, not BWB. \n\nAlternatively, first apply on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. \n\nThen apply on 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R W again? No, because each application must set them to either RB or BR. \n\nWait, the first application sets them to BR. The second application on the same pair can choose to set them to RB or BR again. \n\nIf you choose BR again, they stay as BR. \n\nSo to get the second B in position 2, you need to apply a stamp on positions 1-2. \n\nSuppose first stamp on 0-1 \u2192 B R W. \n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 then position1 becomes B, position2 becomes R \u2192 so the string is B B R. \n\nAlternatively, choosing RB for the second stamp: position1 becomes R, position2 becomes B \u2192 B R B. \n\nSo in neither case can we get a W in position 1. \n\nThus, the target BWB is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the condition is not just that consecutive non-W are alternating, but also that the entire sequence of non-W must form a path where each step alternates, but also that the non-W characters can be formed by overlapping pairs. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe problem can be viewed as the following: \n\nThe final string must satisfy that every occurrence of a non-W character must be part of at least one pair of adjacent non-W characters forming RB or BR. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that the non-W characters form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W are either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but in the case of BWB, the two B's are separated by a W, so they are not consecutive. So their order doesn't matter. \n\nBut the problem is that the two B's can't be formed without having them adjacent at some point. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the entire string must not have any two identical non-W characters in a row, and also that the entire sequence of non-W must form a valid alternating sequence. \n\nWait, but how to model this. \n\nAnother idea: the entire string must be such that any two non-W characters that are adjacent must alternate between R and B. \n\nAdditionally, the entire sequence of non-W must form a valid alternating sequence. \n\nWait, but how to check this. \n\nLet me think of the following steps to determine if the string is possible:\n\n1. Check that there are no two consecutive R's or B's. \n\n2. Check that the entire sequence of non-W characters forms an alternating sequence of R and B. \n\nWait, but the non-W can be separated by W's. \n\nWait, the non-W characters can be in any positions, but whenever two non-W are adjacent, they must alternate. \n\nSo the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W must be RB or BR. \n\nBut also, the entire sequence of non-W must form a valid alternating sequence. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire string must be such that all non-W characters form a sequence where each pair of consecutive non-W (regardless of W's in between) alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence of non-W must form a valid alternating sequence when considering their order in the string. \n\nFor example, in the case of \"BWB\", the non-W are B at 0 and B at 2. So their sequence is B followed by B, which is invalid. \n\nThus, the condition is that the entire sequence of non-W characters must alternate between R and B. \n\nSo the steps to check are:\n\n- The string has no two consecutive R's or B's. \n\n- The sequence of non-W characters must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, but how to check that. \n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nLoop through the string and collect all non-W characters in order. \n\nCheck that this list has no two consecutive same characters. \n\nAdditionally, the list must be either empty (all W's \u2192 allowed), or start with R or B and alternate. \n\nWait, but the list can start with R or B, and alternate. \n\nFor example, R B R B \u2192 valid. \n\nB R B \u2192 valid. \n\nR B B \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the first condition is that the list of non-W characters must alternate between R and B. \n\nThus, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read the string s. \n\n- Create a list 'chars' consisting of all non-W characters in order. \n\n- If the length of chars is 0 \u2192 answer is YES. \n\n- Else, check that the chars list has no two consecutive same elements. \n\n- If that's true \u2192 YES, else NO. \n\nWait, but what about the example where the non-W are separated by W's but their sequence alternates? \n\nLike \"BRWBR\" \u2192 the chars are B R B R \u2192 which alternates. So that's okay. \n\nThe example \"BWB\" \u2192 chars are B, B \u2192 consecutive same \u2192 invalid \u2192 answer NO. \n\nThe example \"BRB\" \u2192 chars are B R B \u2192 alternates \u2192 valid \u2192 answer YES. \n\nThe example \"RBR\" \u2192 R B R \u2192 valid \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example \"RR\" \u2192 chars are R R \u2192 invalid \u2192 NO. \n\nThe example \"RB\" \u2192 valid \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example \"BR\" \u2192 valid \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example \"BRRB\" \u2192 chars are B R R B \u2192 has R R \u2192 invalid \u2192 NO. \n\nThe example \"BWB\" \u2192 invalid \u2192 NO. \n\nThe example \"BRW\" \u2192 chars are B R \u2192 valid \u2192 YES. \n\nThis seems to handle the cases. \n\nBut what about a case like \"BRWBRWBR\"? \u2192 chars are B R B R B R \u2192 alternates \u2192 valid. \n\nAnother case: \"BWBW\" \u2192 chars are B, B \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo this condition seems to work. \n\nBut what about a case where the non-W sequence is valid but the actual string has some W's in between? \n\nYes, because the W's are allowed. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCollect all non-W characters in order. \n\nCheck that this list has no two consecutive same elements. \n\nIf yes \u2192 YES, else NO. \n\nWait, but what about the following case: \n\nSuppose the string is \"RWB\". \n\nThe non-W chars are R and B \u2192 which alternate. So the answer should be YES. \n\nHow can this be formed? \n\nFirst, apply stamp on 0-1 \u2192 RB W \u2192 then the string is RBW. \n\nBut the target is RWB. \n\nWait, the target is R W B. \n\nThe first two characters are R and W. \n\nSo the first stamp can be applied on 1-2 (W and B?), but initially, it's all W. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitial: WWW. \n\nTo get R W B: \n\nFirst, apply stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nThen, apply stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B becomes B R, so the string becomes R B R \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, that's not working. \n\nWait, how to get R W B? \n\nWait, the target has R at 0, W at 1, B at 2. \n\nThe non-W are R and B, which are not adjacent. \n\nSo the first step: apply stamp on 0-1 to get RB W \u2192 R B W. \n\nThen, to get the W back in position 1, we need to apply a stamp on 0-1 again. \n\nWait, but applying a stamp on 0-1 again can set them to either RB or BR. \n\nIf we set them to BR, then position0 becomes B and position1 becomes R \u2192 B R W. \n\nNot helpful. \n\nAlternatively, applying a stamp on positions 1-2 (B and W) as BR \u2192 then position1 becomes B and position2 becomes R \u2192 R B R. \n\nHmm, not getting the desired result. \n\nSo the target R W B is not possible. \n\nBut according to our condition, the non-W sequence is R followed by B \u2192 which is valid. \n\nSo our condition would say YES, but the actual answer is NO. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nHmm, so the condition is not sufficient. \n\nWhat's wrong here? \n\nThe target R W B has non-W chars R and B, but they are not adjacent. \n\nThe problem is that the two non-W must be part of some stamp applications. \n\nBut in this case, the R and B are separated by a W. \n\nTo get R W B, you need to have the R from a stamp on 0-1 (RB or BR), and the B from a stamp on 1-2 (RB or BR). \n\nBut applying a stamp on 0-1 as RB gives R B W. \n\nThen applying a stamp on 1-2 as BR would turn B and W into B R \u2192 resulting in R B R. \n\nAlternatively, applying a stamp on 1-2 as RB would turn B and W into R B \u2192 R R B \u2192 which has two R's \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, so it's impossible to get R W B. \n\nThus, our condition is not sufficient. \n\nSo what's the missing condition? \n\nThe problem is that the non-W characters must form a sequence where each pair of non-W must be part of a stamp application. \n\nWait, but how to model that. \n\nAnother idea: the non-W characters must form a sequence where every two non-W characters are connected via a path of overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence of non-W must form a single \"chain\" where each consecutive pair in the sequence is adjacent in the string. \n\nWait, that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the non-W characters must form a sequence where each pair of non-W must be separated by an even number of W's? Not sure. \n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe stamp can be applied anywhere, but each application affects two adjacent cells. \n\nThe key is that any non-W character must be part of at least one pair of adjacent non-W characters. \n\nWait, but in the case of R W B, the two non-W are separated by a W. So they are not adjacent. \n\nThus, they are not part of a pair. \n\nSo the problem is that the two non-W are not adjacent, so they can't be part of any pair. \n\nWait, but how were they created? \n\nThe R must have been created by a stamp on 0-1 or 0- something. \n\nThe B must have been created by a stamp on 1-2 or 2- something. \n\nBut the W between them means that the two stamps were applied on non-overlapping pairs. \n\nBut the R and B are not adjacent, so they can't be part of the same pair. \n\nThus, the problem is that the two non-W are not part of any pair. \n\nWait, but each non-W must have been created by a stamp. \n\nEach stamp creates two non-W. \n\nSo the total number of non-W must be even? \n\nAh! That's a crucial point. \n\nEach stamp application adds two non-W characters (since they were previously W). \n\nBut when you apply a stamp over existing non-W, you can change them. \n\nWait, but the total count can change. \n\nWait, for example, applying a stamp on two W's increases the count by 2. \n\nApplying a stamp on two non-W's (say RB) and changing them to BR doesn't change the count. \n\nApplying a stamp on one W and one non-W: \n\nSuppose you have W and R. Applying a stamp on them as RB would turn them into R and B \u2192 increasing the count by 1 (since the first was W, now R, and the second was R \u2192 now B. So net change: +1 (from W to R) and -1 (R to B) \u2192 net 0. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the total number of non-W characters must be even. \n\nBecause each stamp application changes exactly two cells. \n\nWait, each stamp application changes two cells from whatever they were to either RB or BR. \n\nSo each application changes exactly two cells. \n\nThe initial state has zero non-W. \n\nEach application can change two cells from any state to RB or BR. \n\nThe total number of non-W can be even or odd? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose you start with all W (0 non-W). \n\nApply one stamp \u2192 two non-W \u2192 even. \n\nApply another stamp on two W's \u2192 total 4 \u2192 even. \n\nApply a stamp on two non-W (RB) \u2192 they become BR \u2192 still two non-W \u2192 even. \n\nApply a stamp on one W and one non-W (say W and R): \n\nChanging them to RB \u2192 the first becomes R (non-W), the second becomes B (non-W). So the count increases by 1 (since the first was W \u2192 now R, and the second was R \u2192 now B \u2192 net change +1 (from W to R) and -1 (R to B \u2192 net 0? \n\nWait, the first cell was W (0) \u2192 now R (1). The second was R (1) \u2192 now B (1). So total non-W increases by 1 (from 1 to 2). \n\nSo the total non-W can be odd. \n\nHmm, so the total count can be even or odd. \n\nThus, the evenness is not a necessary condition. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nThe non-W characters must form a sequence where every pair of non-W must be part of a pair of adjacent non-W. \n\nWait, but that's not possible for the case of two non-W separated by a W. \n\nThus, the only way to have non-W characters is that they form a single contiguous block where each adjacent pair is RB or BR. \n\nWait, but that's not true. \n\nFor example, the string \"BRBR\" is okay. \n\nBut \"BRWBR\" is also okay. \n\nWait, but in \"BRWBR\", the two BR pairs are separated by a W. \n\nThe non-W sequence is B R B R \u2192 which alternates. \n\nBut the two B's are separated by a W. \n\nSo the non-W are not contiguous. \n\nThus, the contiguous block idea is not correct. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the sequence of non-W characters must alternate between R and B, and also that between any two non-W characters, there must be an even number of W's? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final string can be formed if and only if the sequence of non-W characters forms an alternating sequence of R and B, and the entire sequence can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nWait, but how to check that. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence of non-W must be such that every two consecutive non-W are either RB or BR. \n\nThis is the first condition. \n\nAdditionally, the entire sequence must be possible to form by some sequence of stamps. \n\nBut how to model that. \n\nWait, the first condition is necessary. \n\nThe example of R W B has non-W sequence R B \u2192 which is valid (alternating). \n\nBut the actual string can't be formed. \n\nSo the first condition is not sufficient. \n\nThus, there must be another condition. \n\nPerhaps the non-W characters must form a single contiguous block. \n\nIn the example R W B, the non-W are not contiguous \u2192 thus invalid. \n\nIn the example BRWBR, the non-W are contiguous in the first two and last two, but separated by a W. \n\nWait, but in that case, the non-W sequence is B R B R \u2192 which is alternating. \n\nBut the non-W are not contiguous. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern or think of the problem differently. \n\nEach stamp application can be thought of as toggling two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that any two adjacent non-W must be RB or BR. \n\nAdditionally, the entire sequence of non-W must form a valid alternating sequence. \n\nBut also, the non-W must form a single connected block? \n\nWait, perhaps the non-W must form a single connected block where each adjacent pair in the block is RB or BR. \n\nIn the example R W B, the non-W are not connected \u2192 thus invalid. \n\nIn the example BRWBR, the non-W are B R B R \u2192 connected via the first two and last two, but separated by a W. \n\nWait, but the W breaks the connection. \n\nHmm, perhaps the non-W must form a single contiguous block. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n1. The non-W characters form an alternating sequence of R and B. \n\n2. All non-W characters are contiguous (i.e., there are no W's between them). \n\nThis would handle the R W B case (non-contiguous \u2192 invalid). \n\nThe example BRWBR would have non-W as B R B R \u2192 contiguous? No, because there's a W in between. \n\nThus, that would also be invalid. \n\nBut the example given in the problem's fifth test case is \"BRB\", which is contiguous and valid. \n\nThe example \"BRBR\" is contiguous and valid. \n\nThe example \"BRWBR\" would be invalid because the non-W are not contiguous. \n\nBut according to the problem's fifth test case explanation, the example fifth test case is \"BRB\" which is contiguous. \n\nThe example given in the problem's fifth test case's explanation is \"BRB\", which is valid. \n\nThe example \"BRWBR\" would require the non-W to be separated by a W, which would be invalid. \n\nThus, the conditions would be:\n\n- The non-W characters form an alternating sequence. \n\n- All non-W are contiguous (no W between them). \n\nThis would solve the R W B case. \n\nBut what about a case like \"BRBR\" \u2192 contiguous and alternating \u2192 valid. \n\nAnother example: \"BWB\" \u2192 non-W are B and B, which are not alternating \u2192 invalid. \n\nThe example \"BRW\" \u2192 non-W are B R \u2192 contiguous \u2192 valid. \n\nWait, \"BRW\" has non-W as B R (contiguous), so it's valid. \n\nBut how to form it? \n\nInitial: WWW. \n\nApply stamp on 0-1 \u2192 BR W \u2192 which is the desired string. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nThe case \"RWB\" \u2192 non-W are R and B, but separated by W \u2192 thus non-contiguous \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n1. The non-W characters form an alternating sequence (no two same in a row). \n\n2. All non-W characters are contiguous (no W between them). \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nCollect the non-W characters into a list. \n\nCheck that this list is alternating (no two same in a row). \n\nAlso, check that in the original string, all non-W are consecutive (i.e., there are no W's between them). \n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor a given string s:\n\n- Find the first and last occurrence of non-W characters. \n\n- Check that between these indices, all characters are non-W. \n\n- Also, the non-W list must alternate between R and B. \n\nIf all these conditions are met \u2192 YES, else NO. \n\nThis would handle the cases. \n\nLet me test this with previous examples:\n\nExample R W B \u2192 first non-W is 0 (R), last is 2 (B). Between them are indices 0,1,2. The characters at 1 is W \u2192 thus, there is a W between first and last \u2192 thus, the non-W are not contiguous \u2192 invalid \u2192 answer NO. \n\nExample BRWBR \u2192 first non-W is 0 (B), last is 4 (R). Between them are indices 0-4. The character at index 2 is W \u2192 thus, non-W are not contiguous \u2192 invalid \u2192 answer NO. \n\nExample BRB \u2192 first and last are 0 and 2. All between are non-W \u2192 valid. \n\nExample BRBR \u2192 first 0, last 3 \u2192 all non-W \u2192 valid. \n\nExample BWB \u2192 first 0 (B), last 2 (B). Between them is W \u2192 thus non-contiguous \u2192 but also the non-W list is B B \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W list must alternate between R and B. \n\n- All non-W are contiguous (no W between first and last non-W). \n\nThus, the code for program2.py must implement these checks. \n\nNow, how to implement this in Python. \n\nThe steps for each test case:\n\nRead n and s. \n\nCollect the indices of non-W characters. \n\nIf there are none \u2192 answer is YES. \n\nElse:\n\n- Check that the non-W list is alternating. \n\n- Check that in the original string, from first to last non-W index, all characters are non-W. \n\nSo code steps:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = ... \n\n    s = ... \n\n    non_w = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c != 'W']\n\n    if not non_w:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        continue\n\n    # check alternating \n\n    valid = True\n\n    prev = non_w[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(non_w)):\n\n        if s[non_w[i]] == s[non_w[i-1]]:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    # check contiguous \n\n    first = non_w[0]\n\n    last = non_w[-1]\n\n    # check that all characters from first to last are non-W \n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThis should work. \n\nNow, looking at the given code for program2.py:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe code reads from standard input. The test cases are read from the input. \n\nThe current code is trying to loop over the input lines, but the way it's written may be incorrect. \n\nThe problem's input format is:\n\nThe first line is t. \n\nThen for each test case: \n\n- a line with n. \n\n- a line with the string s. \n\nThus, the input lines are: \n\nt \n\nn1 \n\ns1 \n\nn2 \n\ns2 \n\n... \n\nThus, the lines are: \n\nlines[0] = t \n\nlines[1] = n1 \n\nlines[2] = s1 \n\nlines[3] = n2 \n\nlines[4] = s2 \n\netc. \n\nThus, the test cases' data are every two lines after the first. \n\nThe code given is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\nThis would take the lines starting from index 2, stepping by 2 \u2192 which are the s strings. \n\nBut the code needs to process each test case's n and s. \n\nThus, the current code is missing the n and the s. \n\nThe correct approach is to read all lines first, then process them in pairs. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as follows:\n\nimport sys \n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    ... \n\nBut the given code is using a list comprehension to read all lines, then taking every second line starting from index 2. \n\nBut that would give the s strings, but not the n. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code should read each test case's n and s. \n\nThus, the code for program2.py should be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n \n\n    read s \n\n    process as per the conditions. \n\nThus, the code needs to be written properly. \n\nThe given code's current line is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\nThis is taking every second line starting from index 2, which are the s strings. \n\nBut the n is not read. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code would need to read the n and s for each test case. \n\nThus, the code for program2.py should be:\n\nimport sys \n\nlines = list(map(str.strip, sys.stdin)) \n\nt = int(lines[0]) \n\nindex = 1 \n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(lines[index]) \n\n    s = lines[index+1] \n\n    index +=2 \n\n    # process s \n\n    ... \n\nThus, the code needs to be written this way. \n\nThe given code's current line is trying to loop over the s strings directly, but without the n. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to properly read each test case's n and s, then apply the conditions. \n\nPutting it all together, the code for program2.py would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    pass  #

The user's code has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code is to replace this line with the proper loop and processing. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2.py would involve reading the test cases properly. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the correct code for program2.py as per the conditions. \n\nThe final code for program2.py would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nt = int(lines[0])\n\nidx = 1\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(lines[idx])\n\n    s = lines[idx+1]\n\n    idx +=2\n\n    non_w = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c != 'W']\n\n    if not non_w:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        continue\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(1, len(non_w)):\n\n        if s[non_w[i]] == s[non_w[i-1]]:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    first = non_w[0]\n\n    last = non_w[-1]\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is the entire block after the loop initialization. \n\nBut the original code's loop is incorrect and needs to be replaced. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is the entire processing loop, replacing the initial line. \n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing code parts. \n\nThe original code for program2.py has the line:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code is to replace this line with the proper loop and processing. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2.py's missing part is the entire block I wrote above. \n\nBut since the user's code for program2.py is only that line, the missing code is the entire processing. \n\nTherefore, the final answer for the two programs is:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe missing code is changing a = int(input()) to a = input().strip(), fixing the condition, and the else clause. \n\nThe code for program1.py's missing parts are:\n\nIn the loop:\n\na = input().strip()\n\nThen the condition:\n\nif (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n\nThen the else clause's print(\"NO\").\n\nThus, the code for program1's missing parts are:\n\nThe line a = input().strip() instead of a = int(input()), and the condition and else clause. \n\nThe original code's if condition is wrong, so it must be replaced. \n\nThe else clause must have print(\"NO\").\n\nThus, the complete code for program1.py is:\n\ns = int(input())\nfor _ in range(s):\n    a = input().strip()\n    if (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is the changes to the a variable and the condition. \n\nThe original code had:\n\na = int(input())\n\nif a // 100000 + ... \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is replacing that line with a = input().strip() and the condition. \n\nThe else clause's code is print(\"NO\").\n\nThus, the JSON for program1 is the code for the loop's a assignment and the condition and else. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the entire processing loop. \n\nThe original code's line is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe correct code replaces this with the proper loop and processing. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire block I wrote earlier. \n\nBut since the user's code for program2 is only that line, the missing code is the entire processing. \n\nThus, the JSON for program2 is the code that replaces the initial line and processes each test case. \n\nPutting it all together, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"a = input().strip()\\n    if (int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])) == (int(a[3]) + int(a[4]) + int(a[5])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\",\n  \"program2\": \"import sys\\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\\nt = int(lines[0])\\nidx = 1\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(lines[idx])\\n    s = lines[idx+1]\\n    idx +=2\\n    non_w = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c != 'W']\\n    if not non_w:\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        continue\\n    valid = True\\n    for i in range(1, len(non_w)):\\n        if s[non_w[i]] == s[non_w[i-1]]:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    if not valid:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        continue\\n    first = non_w[0]\\n    last = non_w[-1]\\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\\n        if s[i] == 'W':\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n}\n\nWait, but the user's program2.py's code is only the line with the for loop. So the missing code is the entire block after that line. \n\nThe original code for program2.py is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is to replace this line with the proper code. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire processing loop. \n\nBut the user's code for program2 is only that line. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is the entire block I wrote earlier, replacing the initial line. \n\nBut the user's code's first line is the for loop. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire block after the for loop. \n\nWait, the user's code for program2 is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is to replace the line with the proper code. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire processing loop. \n\nBut the user's code's line is incorrect and needs to be replaced. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is the entire block I wrote earlier. \n\nBut the user's code's first line is the for loop. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire block that processes each test case. \n\nTherefore, the JSON for program2 is the code that replaces the initial line and processes each test case. \n\nBut the user's code for program2 is only that line. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire code block I wrote earlier. \n\nBut the user's code for program2 is only the first line. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire code block. \n\nBut the user's code for program2 is incomplete, so the missing code is the entire code. \n\nHowever, the problem states that the user will provide program1 and program2 with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in. \n\nThe user's program2's code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThus, the missing code is the entire processing inside the loop. \n\nThe loop variable s is the string of the test case. \n\nBut the code also needs to read the n. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    pass \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the correct code for program2 is:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nt = int(lines[0])\n\nptr = 1\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    s = lines[ptr]\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    # process s \n\n    non_w = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c != 'W']\n\n    if not non_w:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        continue\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(1, len(non_w)):\n\n        if s[non_w[i]] == s[non_w[i-1]]:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    first = non_w[0]\n\n    last = non_w[-1]\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire block after the for loop. \n\nBut the user's code for program2 is only the first line. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire block after the for loop. \n\nBut the first line is incorrect and needs to be replaced. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is the entire block I wrote earlier. \n\nBut the user's code's first line is the for loop. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire code block. \n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing code parts. \n\nThe user's program2's code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code is to replace this line with the proper loop and processing. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire code block I wrote earlier. \n\nBut the user's code's first line is the for loop. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is the entire block I wrote earlier. \n\nTherefore, the final JSON is as follows."
