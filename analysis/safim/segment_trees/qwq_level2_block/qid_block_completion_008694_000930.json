The key here is understanding the two actions: moving the capital and conquering. The cost depends on whether you move the capital (cost a) or conquer (cost b). The note example gives a clue on how the optimal path works. Looking at the code provided for program1.py, it seems like they are trying to precompute some suffix values. The code starts by adding 0 to the x array, which makes sense since the capital starts at 0. Then, they initialize a suffixes array with [0], and loop from n-1 down to 0. The TODO is in the loop where they need to compute the suffixes. Hmm, the suffixes array probably stores some cumulative cost from the end. Let me think. The approach might involve dynamic programming.",

Next i=3 (x[3]=6, x[4]=21):\n\nnew_suffix = (21-6)*9 + 81 \u2192 15*9=135 \u2192 135+81=216 \u2192 suffixes now [0,81,216]\n\ni=2 (x[2]=5, x[3]=6):\n\n(6-5)*9 + 216 \u2192 1*9=9 \u2192 225 \u2192 suffixes [0,81,216, 225] Wait, no, wait 216 is the previous suffix. Wait, the previous suffix is the last element of the current suffixes array. Wait, for i=3, the previous suffix was 81 (the second element in the array before adding). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-calculate step by step. Let me take the example with a=6, b=3. The suffixes array starts as [0]. Processing i=4 (the fifth element in x is 30, but x[4] is 21, x[5] is 30):\n\nThe distance between x[4] and x[5] is 9. The new suffix is 9*(6+3) + 0 \u2192 9*9 =81. Append to suffixes \u2192 [0,81]\n\nNext i=3 (x[3] is 6, x[4] is 21 \u2192 distance 15):\n\nnew_suffix = 15*(9) + 81 \u2192 135 +81 = 216 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216]\n\ni=2 (x[2]=5, x[3]=6 \u2192 distance 1):\n\nnew_suffix = 1*9 + 216 \u2192 9+216=225 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216,225]\n\ni=1 (x[1]=1, x[2]=5 \u2192 distance 4):\n\nnew_suffix =4*9 +225 \u2192 36+225=261 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216,225,261]\n\ni=0 (x[0]=0, x[1]=1 \u2192 distance 1):\n\nnew_suffix =1*9 +261 \u2192 9+261=270 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216,225,261,270]\n\nThen, after the loop, the suffixes array is [0,81,216,225,261,270]. Then, reversing gives [270,261,225,216,81,0]. Wait, the reversed array would be the original list reversed. Original list after loop is [0,81,216,225,261,270]. Reversed \u2192 [270,261,225,216,81,0]. So the suffixes array after reversal is of length 6 (since n+1=6).",

Wait, but if a < b, then (a - b) is negative, so we want to maximize the sum of those distances. But that can't be. Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting somewhere. Let me think of the example. In the note example, a=6, b=3. So a - b = 3. The total distance between consecutive kingdoms is (1-0) + (5-1) + (6-5) + (21-6) + (30-21) = 1 +4 +1 +15 +9 = 30. The total cost if you never move the capital (except to move it to each conquered kingdom) would be 30 * (a + b) = 30 *9 = 270. But the example's answer is 171, which is 270 - 99. Hmm, so the difference is 99. The (a - b) term is 3. So 99 = 3 * 33. So the sum of the distances between the points where you move the capital must be 33.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nSo the first problem is about finding the minimum cost to conquer all kingdoms. The key here is understanding the two actions: moving the capital and conquering. The cost depends on whether you move the capital (cost a) or conquer (cost b). The note example gives a clue on how the optimal path works. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, it seems like they are trying to precompute some suffix values. The code starts by adding 0 to the x array, which makes sense since the capital starts at 0. Then, they initialize a suffixes array with [0], and loop from n-1 down to 0. The TODO is in the loop where they need to compute the suffixes. \n\nHmm, the suffixes array probably stores some cumulative cost from the end. Let me think. The approach might involve dynamic programming. Since the problem requires choosing the best path, maybe the suffixes array represents the minimal cost from position i to the end. \n\nWait, the code later uses x[i]*(a + b) plus the suffix. Maybe the suffixes[i] is the cost needed after position i. Let me think of the example given. For each position i, the best is to either move the capital there and then conquer the rest, or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as choosing a point where you move the capital to, and then the cost is the sum of conquering the left and right parts. But since the kingdoms are in order, maybe the optimal path is to move the capital to some point and then expand outward. \n\nWait, the note example's explanation shows that conquering is done in steps where you can only conquer adjacent kingdoms. Wait no, the note says you can't conquer a kingdom if there's an unconquered one between. So you have to conquer in order. So the strategy is to move the capital as needed to cover all kingdoms. \n\nThe key idea might be that the optimal path is to either conquer all to the right from the left, or all to the left from the right, or some combination. Since moving the capital is expensive (cost a), but conquering is cheaper (cost b), perhaps it's better to conquer as much as possible with the cheaper option. \n\nWait, the cost for conquering is b per distance, and moving is a. So if b is cheaper than a, then it's better to conquer as much as possible without moving. But moving might be necessary when you can't conquer further. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be computed by considering for each position i, the cost to reach there and then proceed. \n\nLooking at the code structure, the suffixes array is built in reverse. Let me think of the loop:\n\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    # compute something here\n\nThe suffixes starts with [0], and after the loop, it's reversed. So maybe the suffixes array is storing the minimal cost from position i to the end. \n\nSuppose that for each position i, the suffixes[i] is the minimal cost needed to conquer all kingdoms from i to the end. \n\nThe formula in the code for best is x[i]*(a + b) + suffixes[i]. Hmm, perhaps x[i] is the position of the capital, and (a + b) is part of the cost calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the suffixes array is built such that for each i, the suffixes[i] represents the cost from i to the end. Let me think of the example given. \n\nIn the note example, the kingdoms are at 1,5,6,21,30. The code's x array would be [0,1,5,6,21,30]. The loop is from n-1 (which is 4, since n=5) down to 0. \n\nWait, the initial x is [0] + I(). So the x array includes 0 as the first element. So the indices go from 0 to n. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for i in range(n-1, -1, -1). Wait n is the number of kingdoms, so the x array has length n+1 (since 0 is added). So the loop is from n-1 down to 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the suffixes array is being built in reverse. Let me think of the recurrence. \n\nSuppose that for each position i (starting from the end), the minimal cost to conquer from i to the end. \n\nThe last element (the end of the array) would have a cost of 0. \n\nFor the second to last element (i = n-1), the cost would be the cost to conquer the last element. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the suffixes array might be storing the cost to conquer all the kingdoms from i to the end, given that the capital is at x[i]. \n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is as follows: \n\nsuffixes[i] = (distance from x[i] to x[i+1]) * b (since you can conquer the next kingdom by being at x[i], but then you have to move the capital to x[i+1], which costs a * distance, and then add the suffixes[i+1]. \n\nWait, but moving the capital is a cost, but you can choose when to do it. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost for position i is the minimum between:\n\n1. Conquering the next kingdom (i+1) from current capital (x[i]), then moving the capital there (cost a * (x[i+1] - x[i])), and then proceed. \n\nOR \n\n2. Not moving the capital yet, but that might not be possible because you can't conquer beyond the next kingdom without moving. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal approach is to either move the capital to each kingdom as you go, or find a point where you can conquer a large stretch with the cheaper option. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe total cost is the sum of all the distances between consecutive kingdoms multiplied by either a or b, depending on whether you move the capital or conquer. \n\nWait, but moving the capital is only possible to already conquered kingdoms. So the path must be such that you can move the capital step by step. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be computed by considering that whenever you move the capital, you have to pay a for the distance, but conquering is done with b. \n\nThe key insight might be that it's optimal to either:\n\n- Conquer all to the right from the left, moving the capital each time (cost a per step) plus the conquering cost (b per step). \n\nOR \n\n- Conquer all to the left from the right, moving the capital each time. \n\nOR \n\n- Find a point where you switch between the two strategies. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost can be found by considering for each position i, the cost to reach there and then proceed optimally. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as choosing a point where you decide to move the capital to that point, and then conquer all to the left and right from there. \n\nWait, but the kingdoms are in order, so perhaps the optimal path is to move the capital to some position and then conquer in one direction. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be computed by considering that for each position i, the cost is the cost to reach i (from 0) plus the cost to conquer the remaining kingdoms from i. \n\nHmm, perhaps the suffix array is built such that suffixes[i] is the minimal cost to conquer from i to the end. \n\nLet me think of the recurrence for suffixes. \n\nSuppose that for position i, the minimal cost is:\n\nThe cost to move the capital to x[i], then conquer the next kingdom (i+1) with cost b*(x[i+1] - x[i]), then move the capital to x[i+1], paying a*(x[i+1] - x[i]), and then add the suffixes[i+1]. \n\nWait, but moving the capital to x[i] would require that you have already conquered it. \n\nAlternatively, the suffixes[i] represents the minimal cost to conquer all kingdoms from x[i] to x[n]. \n\nThe recurrence would be:\n\nsuffixes[i] = (x[i+1] - x[i]) * b (cost to conquer the next kingdom) + (x[i+1] - x[i])*a (cost to move the capital there) + suffixes[i+1]\n\nWait, but that would be if you have to move the capital each time. But maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is to either move the capital each time (cost a) and conquer (cost b) each step, but that's not optimal. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost for suffixes[i] is the minimum between:\n\nOption 1: Conquer the next kingdom (i+1) from current capital (x[i]), which costs b*(x[i+1]-x[i]). Then, you can choose to move the capital to x[i+1], paying a*(distance), and then proceed. \n\nOR \n\nOption 2: Not move the capital yet, but that might not be possible because you can't conquer further without moving. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to always move the capital after conquering, so the cost for moving is a*(distance) plus the cost to conquer. \n\nWait, perhaps the total cost for moving and conquering between x[i] and x[i+1] is (a + b) * (x[i+1] - x[i]). Because you have to move the capital there (cost a * distance) and then you can conquer it (but wait, you can't conquer it unless you are at the capital. Wait, conquering is done from the current capital. So to conquer x[i+1], you must be at x[i], then pay b*(distance). Then, to move the capital to x[i+1], you pay a*(distance). \n\nSo for each step from x[i] to x[i+1], the cost is (a + b)*(x[i+1] - x[i]). \n\nWait, but that would be the case if you have to move the capital each time. But maybe there's a better way. \n\nWait, if you have already moved the capital to x[i], then you can conquer x[i+1] with cost b*(distance). But to move the capital to x[i+1], you have to pay a*(distance). \n\nAlternatively, if you don't move the capital, you can't conquer further beyond x[i+1], so you have to move. \n\nTherefore, for each pair of consecutive kingdoms, the cost is (a + b) multiplied by their distance. \n\nWait, but that would mean the total cost is (a + b) multiplied by the total distance from 0 to the last kingdom. But that can't be right because the example given has a different calculation. \n\nWait in the note example, the total cost is 171. Let's see:\n\nThe kingdoms are at 1,5,6,21,30. The total distance from 0 to 30 is 30. (a + b) would be 6+3=9. 30*9=270, which is way higher than 171. So that approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my previous assumption is incorrect. \n\nAlternative approach: The key is that conquering can be done in one step if you are at the capital, but you can only conquer kingdoms that are adjacent in the sequence. Wait no, the problem says you can't conquer a kingdom if there's an unconquered one between. So you have to conquer in order. \n\nWait, the problem says you can conquer an unconquered kingdom if there are no unconquered between it and the capital. So the capital must be at one end of the remaining kingdoms. \n\nTherefore, the optimal path is to move the capital to a point and then conquer all to the right or left. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost is to choose a point where you move the capital there, and then conquer all to the left and right from there. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be found by considering that the best strategy is to move the capital to some position and then conquer in one direction. \n\nWait, the code in program1.py seems to compute for each i the cost as x[i]*(a + b) plus the suffixes[i]. \n\nWait, the code's final line is best = min(best, x[i]*(a + b) + suffixes[i]). \n\nHmm, perhaps the suffixes array is storing the cost from i to the end, but the x[i]*(a + b) term is part of the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the suffixes array is the sum of (x[j+1] - x[j])*b for j from i to n-1. \n\nWait, let's think of the example. \n\nIn the note example, the kingdoms are at 1,5,6,21,30. \n\nSuppose we choose to move the capital to position 5. \n\nThe cost would be: \n\nFirst, moving from 0 to 1 (cost 6*1), then moving to 5 (cost 6*(4)), then moving to 6 (cost 6*1), etc. But that's not the way. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach might be considering that for each position i, the cost to reach there and then proceed optimally. \n\nAlternatively, the suffixes array is built such that suffixes[i] is the minimal cost to conquer from i to the end, assuming that the capital is at x[i]. \n\nThe recurrence for suffixes[i] would be:\n\nsuffixes[i] = (x[i+1] - x[i]) * b (cost to conquer the next kingdom) + (a * (x[i+1] - x[i])) (cost to move the capital there) + suffixes[i+1]\n\nWait, but that would be (a + b) * (x[i+1] - x[i]) + suffixes[i+1]. \n\nIf that's the case, then the suffixes array is built from the end. \n\nWait, let's see for the last element (i = n, which is the last kingdom). The suffixes would be 0. \n\nFor i = n-1 (the second last kingdom), the cost would be (x[n] - x[n-1])* (a + b) + 0. \n\nContinuing this way, the suffixes[i] would be the sum from j=i to n-1 of (x[j+1] - x[j])*(a + b). \n\nBut then the total cost would be (a + b) multiplied by the total distance from 0 to the last kingdom. But that contradicts the example. \n\nHmm, so maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the suffixes array is built differently. Let me think again. \n\nThe code's suffixes starts as [0], and then for each i from n-1 down to 0, it appends something. Then reverses it. \n\nWait, the initial suffixes is [0]. Then, for each i in reverse order (starting from n-1 down to 0), perhaps they compute the next suffix value. \n\nWait, let's see the code structure again:\n\nsuffixes = [0]\n\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    # TODO: compute something here, then append to suffixes?\n\nWait, the loop is going from n-1 down to 0. The initial suffixes has [0]. \n\nSuppose that for each i, the new suffix is computed based on the previous suffix. \n\nSuppose that the suffixes array is being built in reverse. Let me think of the example. \n\nSuppose the x array is [0,1,5,6,21,30]. n is 5 (since there are 5 kingdoms). \n\nThe loop runs for i from 4 down to 0 (since n-1 is 4). \n\nInitially, suffixes is [0]. \n\nAt i=4 (the 5th element, which is 6?), wait the indices are a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the x array is [0] + I(). So for the example, the x array would be [0,1,5,6,21,30]. So n is 5 (since the input has 5 numbers). \n\nThe loop runs for i from 4 down to 0 (since n-1 is 4). \n\nAt each step, for i=4 (the 5th element in x is 21?), no. Wait x[4] is 21, x[5] is 30. \n\nWait, the loop is for i in 4,3,2,1,0. \n\nLet me think of the first iteration (i=4):\n\nThe current suffixes is [0]. \n\nSuppose that the new suffix is computed as (x[i+1] - x[i]) * (something) plus the previous suffix. \n\nWait, perhaps the suffixes array is storing the cost from i to the end. \n\nSuppose that for each i, the suffixes[i] is the minimal cost to conquer from x[i] to the end. \n\nThe recurrence would be:\n\nsuffixes[i] = (x[i+1] - x[i]) * b (cost to conquer the next kingdom) + (a * (x[i+1] - x[i])) (cost to move the capital there) + suffixes[i+1]\n\nWait, but that would be (a + b)*(x[i+1] - x[i]) + suffixes[i+1]. \n\nSo the suffixes array is built in reverse. \n\nStarting from the end (i = n, which is the last element, but in the code, the loop is up to 0, so perhaps the suffixes array is being built in reverse. \n\nWait, the code's suffixes starts as [0], which would be the suffix for the last element (i = n). \n\nThen, for i = n-1 (the second last element), the suffix would be (x[n] - x[n-1])*(a + b) + suffixes[0]. \n\nThen, the new suffixes would be [0, ...], but I'm getting a bit confused. \n\nAlternatively, the code's suffixes array is being built in reverse order. \n\nSuppose that after processing i, the suffixes array is storing the suffixes for i, i-1, etc. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is building the suffixes array in reverse. Let me think of the code:\n\nInitially, suffixes = [0]. \n\nThen, for i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n    new_suffix = (x[i+1] - x[i]) * (a + b) + suffixes[-1]\n\n    suffixes.append(new_suffix)\n\nWait, but then after the loop, the suffixes array would have n+1 elements. \n\nWait, let's see for the example:\n\nSuppose n=5 (so x has 6 elements, 0 to 5 indices). \n\nThe loop runs for i from 4 down to 0. \n\nStarting with suffixes = [0]. \n\nFirst iteration i=4 (x[4] is 21, x[5] is 30):\n\nnew_suffix = (30-21)*(a + b) + 0 \u2192 9*(a + b). \n\nAppend to suffixes \u2192 [0, 9*(a+b)]\n\nNext i=3 (x[3] is 6, x[4] is 21):\n\nnew_suffix = (21-6)*(a + b) + suffixes[-1] \u2192 15*(a+b) + 9*(a+b) = 24*(a+b). \n\nAppend \u2192 [0, 9*(a+b), 24*(a+b)]\n\nContinuing this way, the suffixes array after the loop would be [0, 9*(a+b), 24*(a+b), ... etc. \n\nBut then, after the loop, the code reverses the suffixes array. \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nsuffixes = suffixes[::-1]\n\nSo the initial suffixes after the loop is [0, s4, s3, s2, s1, s0], where s_i is the suffix for i. \n\nReversing gives [s0, s1, s2, s3, s4, 0]. \n\nWait, perhaps the suffixes array after reversal is such that suffixes[i] corresponds to the cost from position i to the end. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose after the loop, the suffixes array is [0, s4, s3, s2, s1, s0], where s4 is the cost for i=4, etc. \n\nReversing gives [s0, s1, s2, s3, s4, 0]. \n\nWait, but the indices would be 0 to 5. \n\nHmm, perhaps the suffixes array after reversal is such that suffixes[i] is the cost from position i to the end. \n\nWait, for example, the first element after reversal (s0) would be the cost starting at i=0. \n\nWait, let's see for the example:\n\nSuppose a=6 and b=3 (as in the note example). \n\nThen, for i=4 (x[4] =21, x[5]=30):\n\nThe first step (i=4):\n\nnew_suffix = (30-21)*(6+3) + 0 \u2192 9*9 =81. \n\nThen, suffixes becomes [0,81]. \n\nNext i=3 (x[3]=6, x[4]=21):\n\nnew_suffix = (21-6)*9 + 81 \u2192 15*9=135 \u2192 135+81=216 \u2192 suffixes now [0,81,216]\n\ni=2 (x[2]=5, x[3]=6):\n\n(6-5)*9 + 216 \u2192 1*9=9 \u2192 225 \u2192 suffixes [0,81,216, 225]\n\nWait, no, wait 216 is the previous suffix. \n\nWait, the previous suffix is the last element of the current suffixes array. \n\nWait, for i=3, the previous suffix was 81 (the second element in the array before adding). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-calculate step by step. \n\nLet me take the example with a=6, b=3. \n\nThe suffixes array starts as [0]. \n\nProcessing i=4 (the fifth element in x is 30, but x[4] is 21, x[5] is 30):\n\nThe distance between x[4] and x[5] is 9. \n\nThe new suffix is 9*(6+3) + 0 \u2192 9*9 =81. \n\nAppend to suffixes \u2192 [0,81]\n\nNext i=3 (x[3] is 6, x[4] is 21 \u2192 distance 15):\n\nnew_suffix = 15*(9) + 81 \u2192 135 +81 = 216 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216]\n\ni=2 (x[2]=5, x[3]=6 \u2192 distance 1):\n\nnew_suffix = 1*9 + 216 \u2192 9+216=225 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216,225]\n\ni=1 (x[1]=1, x[2]=5 \u2192 distance 4):\n\nnew_suffix =4*9 +225 \u2192 36+225=261 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216,225,261]\n\ni=0 (x[0]=0, x[1]=1 \u2192 distance 1):\n\nnew_suffix =1*9 +261 \u2192 9+261=270 \u2192 append \u2192 [0,81,216,225,261,270]\n\nThen, after the loop, the suffixes array is [0,81,216,225,261,270]. \n\nThen, reversing gives [270,261,225,216,81,0]. \n\nWait, the reversed array would be the original list reversed. \n\nOriginal list after loop is [0,81,216,225,261,270]. \n\nReversed \u2192 [270,261,225,216,81,0]. \n\nSo the suffixes array after reversal is of length 6 (since n+1=6). \n\nNow, the code's best is computed as the minimum over i from 0 to n (5) of x[i]*(a + b) + suffixes[i]. \n\nWait, let's see for each i:\n\nFor i=0 (x[0]=0):\n\n0*(9) + 270 \u2192 270. \n\ni=1 (x=1):\n\n1*9 +261 \u2192 9+261=270. \n\ni=2 (x=5):\n\n5*9 +225 \u2192 45+225=270. \n\ni=3 (x=6):\n\n6*9 +216 \u219254+216=270. \n\ni=4 (x=21):\n\n21*9 +81 \u2192 189+81=270. \n\ni=5 (x=30):\n\n30*9 +0 \u2192270. \n\nSo all of them give 270, but the example's correct answer is 171. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. So this approach is not working. \n\nWait, the example's correct answer is 171, but according to this code's approach, it would output 270, which is wrong. \n\nSo clearly, the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I must have misunderstood the recurrence. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that you can choose when to move the capital. The key is that moving the capital is expensive (a), but allows you to conquer further without paying a. \n\nThe optimal strategy would be to move the capital as infrequently as possible. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be computed by considering that whenever you move the capital, you pay a for the distance, but you can then conquer further kingdoms with b. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost is to choose a point where you move the capital there, and then conquer all to the right and left from there. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost is the minimum between two options: \n\n1. Conquer all to the right from the left, moving the capital each time. \n\n2. Conquer all to the left from the right, moving the capital each time. \n\n3. Find a point where you move the capital there, then conquer in one direction. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum over all possible positions i where you decide to move the capital to i, and then conquer everything to the left and right from there. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be computed as follows: \n\nThe total cost is the sum of all the distances between consecutive kingdoms multiplied by b (since you can conquer them from the current capital), plus the cost of moving the capital to each new conquered kingdom, which is a multiplied by the distance between the current capital and the new one. \n\nWait, but moving the capital is optional. You can choose to move it only when necessary. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal cost is to move the capital as few times as possible. \n\nWait, the problem allows you to move the capital to any conquered kingdom. So the optimal path is to move the capital to certain points so that you can conquer large stretches with the cheaper b cost. \n\nThe key is that whenever you move the capital, you pay a for the distance, but then you can conquer further kingdoms from there with b. \n\nThe minimal cost would be to choose a set of points where you move the capital such that the total a cost plus the b cost is minimized. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be computed by considering that for each position i, the cost to reach there and then proceed. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe minimal cost can be computed as the minimum over all possible positions i (the capital is at x[i]) of the cost to conquer everything to the left of i plus the cost to conquer everything to the right of i. \n\nThe cost to conquer the left side (from 0 to i) would be the cost to move the capital to each step, but perhaps it's better to move once. \n\nAlternatively, the cost to conquer the left up to i is the cost to move the capital to x[i], which requires moving from 0 to x[i], paying a * x[i], and then the cost to conquer all the kingdoms between 0 and x[i]. \n\nWait, but the kingdoms between 0 and x[i] must have been conquered already. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal cost is the sum of all the distances between consecutive kingdoms multiplied by b, plus the cost of moving the capital between certain points. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost is (sum of all distances between consecutive kingdoms) * b + (sum of the distances between the points where you move the capital) * (a - b). \n\nWait, because moving the capital between two points costs a * distance, but if you had instead conquered those points, it would have cost b * distance. So the difference is (a - b) * distance. \n\nTherefore, the total cost is (sum of all distances between consecutive kingdoms) * b + (sum of the distances between the points where you move the capital) * (a - b). \n\nThus, to minimize the cost, we need to choose the points where we move the capital such that the sum of (a - b) * distance between those points is minimized. \n\nWait, but if a < b, then (a - b) is negative, so we want to maximize the sum of those distances. But that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting somewhere. \n\nLet me think of the example. \n\nIn the note example, a=6, b=3. So a - b = 3. \n\nThe total distance between consecutive kingdoms is (1-0) + (5-1) + (6-5) + (21-6) + (30-21) = 1 +4 +1 +15 +9 = 30. \n\nThe total cost if you never move the capital (except to move it to each conquered kingdom) would be 30 * (a + b) = 30 *9 = 270. \n\nBut the example's answer is 171, which is 270 - 99. \n\nHmm, so the difference is 99. \n\nThe (a - b) term is 3. So 99 = 3 * 33. \n\nSo the sum of the distances between the points where you move the capital must be 33. \n\nWait, in the example's optimal path, the moves are: \n\nMove from 0 to 1 (distance 1), then to 5 (distance 4), then to 6 (distance 1), then to 5 again? No, wait the moves are: \n\nThe moves are: \n\nMove to 1 (cost 6*1), then to 5 (6*4), then to 6 (6*1), then to 5 again?
