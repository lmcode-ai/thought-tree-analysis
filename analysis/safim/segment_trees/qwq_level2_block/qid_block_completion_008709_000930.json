So the algorithm is to arrange the R's into (b+1) runs, each of size either floor(r/(b+1)) or ceil(r/(b+1)), and then insert a B between each pair. So how to code this? First, for each test case, given n, r, b (with r > b, and r + b = n), we need to generate the string. The steps for generating the string would be:\n\n- The number of R runs is (b + 1). - The base size per R run is (r // (b+1)), and the remainder is (r % (b+1)). - So, each of the first 'remainder' runs will have an extra 1. For example, if r =5 and b=3, then b+1 is 4. 5//4 =1, remainder 1. So the first 1 runs get 2, the rest get 1. So the R runs are [2,1,1,1]. Then, between each R run, we insert a B. So the sequence would be:\n\nR*2 B R*1 B R*1 B R*1. Which gives \"RRB R B R B R\" \u2192 \"RRBRBRBR\". Wait, but the total length is 2+1 +1+1 +1+1 +1? Let me count:\n\nEach R run plus the B between them:\n\nFirst R run (2) + B (1) \u2192 3, then next R (1) + B \u2192 2, etc. Wait, the total length is sum of R runs (5) plus B runs (3) \u2192 8? But n is 5+3=8. So that's correct. The maximum run here is 2 (the first R run). So the code can be structured as follows: For each test case:\n\nCompute the number of R runs: runs_r = b +1 \n\nEach R run has base = r // runs_r \n\nremainder = r % runs_r Then, the R runs are a list where the first 'remainder' runs have base +1, and the rest have base. Then, the string is constructed by alternating R runs and B's.",

So for each line in the input (after the first line which is t), we need to process it. The code for program1.py would be something like:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][1:]:\n    n, r, b = map(int, s.split()) # compute the R runs\n    runs_r = b +1\n    base = r // runs_r\n    rem = r % runs_r\n    # create the list of run lengths for R\n    r_runs = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        if i < rem:\n            r_runs.append(base +1)\n        else:\n            r_runs.append(base)\n    # build the string\n    res = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        res.append('R' * r_runs[i])\n        if i < runs_r -1:\n            res.append('B')\n    # join all parts\n    print(''.join(res)) Wait, but what if the runs_r is zero? No, since b is at least 1 (since b < r and r +b =n, and n >=3). Wait, when b is 0? But the problem states that b is strictly less than r, but since r +b =n, and n >=3, then b can be zero? Wait, the input constraints say 1 \u2264 b < r \u2264 n. So b is at least 1. So the code should work. Now, let's test with the first example given in the note. First test case example: n=7, r=4, b=3. runs_r = 3+1 =4. \n\nbase =4//4=1, rem=0. So all runs are 1. So the R runs are [1,1,1,1]. Then the string is R B R B R B R \u2192 \"RBRBRBR\", which matches the example. Another test case: second example in the note, which is the second test case. Suppose the second test case is r=5, b=3, n=8. Then runs_r =4. \n\nr=5 divided by 4 \u2192 base 1, rem 1. So first run is 2, then 1,1,1. The string is \"RRB R B R B R\" \u2192 \"RRBRBRBR\". The maximum run is 2. \n\nWhich matches the note's example. Okay, that seems correct. Now moving to program2.py. The problem for program2 is to determine if a given string of W, R, B can be formed by stamping. Each stamp covers two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects both cells. The key is to find whether the given string can be formed through such operations. The approach here is to model the possible transitions. Let's think of the string and see what constraints must hold. First, note that every occurrence of a non-W character must be part of at least one stamp. Because the initial state is all W, and each stamp changes two cells. Wait, but overlapping stamps can affect the same cell multiple times. Hmm, the problem allows applying the stamp multiple times. So each cell can be part of multiple stamps. The key observation is that any non-W character must be adjacent to another non-W character in some way.",

If b is 0 \u2192 'YNEOS'[0::2] \u2192 'Y' followed by 'N' followed by 'S' \u2192 but the slice is every 2 characters starting at 0. The string 'YNEOS' is 'Y','N','E','O','S'. So 'YNEOS'[0::2] \u2192 'Y', 'E', 'S' \u2192 but the desired output is 'YES' or 'NO'. Hmm, perhaps the code uses a different string. The original code's print line is 'YNEOS '[b::2]. Wait, perhaps the string is 'YNEOS' with a space at the beginning? Wait, the code says 'YNEOS '[b::2]. The string is 'YNEOS ' (with a space at the end?), but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, the code uses 'YNEOS' as the string. Let me see:\n\nIf b is 0 \u2192 slice starts at 0, step 2 \u2192 characters 0,2,4 \u2192 'Y', 'E', 'S' \u2192 'YES'. If b is 1 \u2192 starts at 1, step 2 \u2192 'N', 'O' \u2192 'NO'. Yes! So the code's print statement is correct. Thus, the code for program2 can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    b = 0\n    if not non_empty:\n        pass  # remains 0 \u2192 YES\n    else:\n        if len(non_empty)!=1:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            part = non_empty[0]\n            if len(part) <2:\n                b=1\n            else:\n                for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                    if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2]) This should work. Now, putting it all together, the missing code for program1 and program2 are: For program1.py:\n\nThe code after the for loop:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][1:]:\n    n, r, b = map(int, s.split())\n    runs_r = b +1\n    base = r // runs_r\n    rem = r % runs_r\n    r_runs = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        if i < rem:\n            r_runs.append(base +1)\n        else:\n            r_runs.append(base)\n    res = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        res.append('R' * r_runs[i])\n        if i < runs_r-1:\n            res.append('B')\n    print(''.join(res)) For program2.py:\n\nThe code inside the loop:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W') non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    b = 0\n    if not non_empty:\n        pass\n    else:\n        if len(non_empty)!=1:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            part = non_empty[0]\n            if len(part) <2:\n                b=1\n            else:\n                for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                    if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2]) But the original code for program2 has a loop over s[:-1].split(\"W\"), which may be a mistake. Alternatively, the code can be written using the original structure but with the correct logic. The original code for program2 has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThe 's[:-1]' may be a mistake (should be s), and the loop over the parts. The code inside the loop can be:\n\nparts = s.split('W') non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\nif not non_empty:\n    pass\nelse:\n    if len(non_empty)!=1:\n        b=1\n    else:\n        part = non_empty[0]\n        if len(part) <2:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                    b=1\n                    break\nprint('YNEOS'[b::2]) But the original code uses a loop over the parts. Alternatively, the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    b = 0\n    if not non_empty:\n        pass\n    else:\n        if len(non_empty)!=1:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            part = non_empty[0]\n            if len(part) <2:\n                b=1\n            else:\n                for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                    if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThis should work.

The 'split(\"W\")' would split the string into parts separated by W. For example, if the string is \"BRB\", then splitting on W gives [\"BRB\"], since there are no W's. If the string is \"RWB\", then splitting on W gives [\"R\", \"B\"]. The code is looping over these parts. The variable 'b' is initialized to 0. The idea might be that if any of the non-W segments has length 0 or 1, then it's invalid. Wait, but the code is using s[:-1].split(\"W\"), which may be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check that all non-W segments are of length 1 or 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the code is trying to count the number of non-W segments. If there are multiple non-W segments (split by W), then it's invalid. So the code could be:\n\nfor each test case's string s:\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    # filter out empty strings (from leading/trailing W) non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    if not non_empty:  # all W\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    if len(non_empty) ! =1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # now check the single non-W part\n    part = non_empty[0] if len(part) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # check no three in a row\n    for i in range(len(part)-2):\n        if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    # else clause for the for loop\n    # but need to handle the break case. Hmm, this approach would work. So the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W') non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    if not non_empty:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    if len(non_empty) ! =1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    part = non_empty[0]\n    if len(part) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(part)-2):\n        if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nThis should work. Now, let's see the sixth test case's example of \"RRB\". The parts after splitting on W are [\"RRB\"], so non_empty has length 1. The part length is 3.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to generate a string of 'R's and 'B's such that the maximum number of consecutive wins by any team is as small as possible. The input gives n, r, and b where r > b. The key is to arrange the R's and B's in a way that spreads out the runs as much as possible.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think of distributing the R's and B's in a way that alternates as much as possible. Since R has more wins, maybe we need to interleave them with B's in a balanced way.\n\nWait, the example given was RBRBRBR, which alternates each time, so the max is 1. That's the best possible. So the strategy is to arrange the letters so that the runs are as equal as possible. \n\nThe idea is to distribute the larger group (R here) as evenly as possible. Let's see. Let's think of the problem as dividing the R's into groups and B's into groups, such that the maximum group size is minimized. \n\nThe optimal way would be to arrange the teams in a pattern that alternates between R and B as much as possible. For example, if R has more, maybe start with R, then B, then R, etc., but ensuring that the runs are as balanced as possible.\n\nLet me think of the algorithm steps. Let's suppose that the maximum run length is m. We need to find the minimal possible m. To do that, perhaps we can calculate how many runs each team should have. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nThe total number of R's is r, B's is b. Since R is larger, the minimal maximum run length would be ceil(r/(k)) where k is the number of R runs. But how to choose the number of runs for each team?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal maximum is the ceiling of the maximum between (r divided by (number of B runs +1)) and (b divided by (number of R runs +1)), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to distributing the R's and B's such that the runs are as balanced as possible. Let me think of the process as inserting the B's between the R's, or vice versa.\n\nSuppose we have to arrange the R's and B's in such a way that the runs are as equal as possible. Let's see:\n\nThe minimal maximum run length can be determined by the formula. Let me think of the following steps:\n\nThe total number of runs for R and B must be arranged so that the runs are as balanced as possible. Let me think of the problem as distributing the R's into (b + 1) runs? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nWait, since B has fewer wins, perhaps the number of R runs can be up to (b +1). For example, if there are b B's, then the R's can be split into (b+1) runs, so that each B is between two R runs. But since B is less than R, maybe that's the way.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal maximum run length is the ceiling of (r/(b+1)) or (b/(r))? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the example:\n\nThe optimal arrangement is to alternate as much as possible. Let's distribute the R's and B's in a way that the runs are as equal as possible. For example, if R has r =5 and B has b=3, then the R runs could be 2,2,1 and B runs 1,1,1. So the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, how to compute this?\n\nThe idea is to arrange the runs so that the maximum run length is minimized. Let me think of the following steps:\n\nThe minimal possible maximum run length m must satisfy that:\n\nFor R's: the number of runs for R is (b + 1) if possible, so that each B is between R runs. Then each R run would be at most ceil(r/(b+1)). Similarly for B's, but since B is smaller, their runs can be arranged in (r) runs? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum run length is the minimal m such that:\n\nr <= m * (b + 1) and b <= m * (r). Wait, maybe not exactly, but the idea is to find m such that when you split the R's into (b+1) runs, each run is at most m, and similarly for B's.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the ceiling of r/(b+1) or ceiling(b/(r)), whichever is larger. Wait, but since R is larger, the maximum would be ceiling(r/(b+1)), because B has fewer runs. \n\nWait, let's see the first example in the note: RBRBRBR. Here r=4, b=3. So b+1 is 4. 4 divided by 4 is 1, so that's why the maximum is 1. \n\nAnother example: if r=5, b=3. Then b+1 is 4. 5/4 is 1.25, so ceiling is 2. So the maximum would be 2. \n\nSo the maximum run length for R would be ceil(r/(b+1)), and for B it would be ceil(b/(r's runs)), but since B is smaller, their runs can be arranged in (r) runs? Not sure. \n\nSo the plan is to arrange the R's into (b+1) runs, each as equal as possible, and B's into (r) runs? Or maybe the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, the approach is to alternate between R and B as much as possible, distributing the counts as evenly as possible. \n\nLet me think of the algorithm steps:\n\nThe optimal string should alternate between R and B as much as possible, but starting with the team with more wins (R here). Wait, but maybe starting with either is possible, but the problem allows any arrangement as long as the maximum is minimized.\n\nWait, the problem says \"if there are multiple answers, print any\". So perhaps the approach is to arrange the R's and B's in a way that the runs are as balanced as possible, starting with R or B, whichever gives the minimal maximum.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible algorithm:\n\nThe minimal maximum run length m is the minimal integer such that m >= ceil(r/(k)) and m >= ceil(b/(l)), where k is the number of R runs and l the number of B runs. To minimize m, we need to choose k and l such that the maximum of ceil(r/k) and ceil(b/l) is as small as possible, with the constraint that the arrangement must alternate between R and B runs. \n\nWait, the number of runs for R and B must differ by at most one. Because if you have more R runs than B runs, then the R runs must be arranged such that they are separated by B runs. For example, if there are k R runs, then there can be at most k+1 B runs? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of runs for R and B must be such that they alternate. So the number of R runs can be either equal to the number of B runs, or one more. Since R has more wins, perhaps the number of R runs is one more than B runs. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nSuppose the number of R runs is x and B runs is y. To alternate, the runs must be arranged as R B R B ... or B R B R ... but since R has more wins, starting with R might be better. \n\nThe total R runs x and B runs y must satisfy that either x = y or x = y+1. Because if you start with R, then the sequence is R B R B ... R, so x = y+1. If you start with B, then since B has fewer wins, that might not be possible. \n\nWait, since B has fewer wins, perhaps the number of B runs can't exceed the number of R runs. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal arrangement is to have the R runs as evenly as possible, and B runs as well. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum run length is the minimal possible m such that:\n\nr <= m * (b + 1) and b <= m * (r). \n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, the maximum run length m must satisfy that m is at least ceil(r/(b+1)), since if there are (b+1) runs of R, each can be at most ceil(r/(b+1)). Similarly, the B runs can be arranged into (r) runs, so each B run is at most ceil(b/r). But since b < r, that would be 0 or 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to arrange the R's into (b+1) runs, so that each B is between two R runs. That way, the R runs are as balanced as possible, and the B runs are each 1. \n\nWait, for example, in the first example, R has 4, B has 3. So (b+1) is 4. So 4 R's divided into 4 runs: each run is 1. So the B's are 3, so each B is between the R runs. So the sequence is R B R B R B R. Which gives the example's solution. \n\nAnother example: if r=5, b=3. Then (b+1)=4 runs of R. 5 divided by 4 is 1.25, so ceil is 2. So the R runs would be 2,1,1,1. Then the B runs are 3, so each B is 1. So the sequence would be R(2) B(1) R(1) B(1) R(1) B(1) R(1). The maximum run is 2. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- The R runs are divided into (b+1) parts as evenly as possible. \n\n- The B runs are divided into (r) parts? Or (number of R runs -1) ?\n\nWait, the B runs are between the R runs. So if there are (b+1) R runs, then there are (b+1 -1) = b B runs? Wait no, the number of B runs would be (number of R runs -1) if the sequence starts with R. \n\nWait, if there are x R runs, then the number of B runs can be x-1 or x+1, depending on the starting team. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to arrange the R runs into (b+1) parts, so that each B is between two R runs. So the number of B runs is exactly b, but each B is a single run? No, that's not right. \n\nWait, the B's total is b, so if there are (number of B runs) parts, each part can be 1. So the B runs are all 1. \n\nWait, in the first example, the B runs are 3, each of length 1. So the B runs are exactly b runs of 1 each. \n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Split the R's into (b+1) runs as evenly as possible. \n\n- Then, between each pair of R runs, place a B. Since there are (b+1) R runs, there are (b) B runs. But the total B's is exactly b, so each B run is 1. \n\nWait, but that requires that the number of B runs is exactly b. Wait, no. Wait, the number of B runs would be (number of R runs -1). Because if you have x R runs, then the B runs are between them, so x-1 B runs. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose we have R runs divided into (b+1) parts. Then the number of B runs between them is (b+1 -1) = b. So each B run must be exactly 1, since total B is b. \n\nYes! So that's exactly the case. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Split the R's into (b+1) runs as evenly as possible. \n\n2. Then, between each pair of R runs, place a single B. \n\nThis way, the B's are all single, so their maximum run is 1. The R runs are as balanced as possible, so their maximum run is ceil(r/(b+1)). \n\nThis would give the minimal possible maximum run length. \n\nSo the algorithm is to arrange the R's into (b+1) runs, each of size either floor(r/(b+1)) or ceil(r/(b+1)), and then insert a B between each pair. \n\nSo how to code this?\n\nFirst, for each test case, given n, r, b (with r > b, and r + b = n), we need to generate the string. \n\nThe steps for generating the string would be:\n\n- The number of R runs is (b + 1). \n\n- The base size per R run is (r // (b+1)), and the remainder is (r % (b+1)). \n\n- So, each of the first 'remainder' runs will have an extra 1. \n\nFor example, if r =5 and b=3, then b+1 is 4. 5//4 =1, remainder 1. So the first 1 runs get 2, the rest get 1. \n\nSo the R runs are [2,1,1,1]. \n\nThen, between each R run, we insert a B. \n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nR*2 B R*1 B R*1 B R*1. \n\nWhich gives \"RRB R B R B R\" \u2192 \"RRBRBRBR\". Wait, but the total length is 2+1 +1+1 +1+1 +1? Let me count:\n\nEach R run plus the B between them:\n\nFirst R run (2) + B (1) \u2192 3, then next R (1) + B \u2192 2, etc. \n\nWait, the total length is sum of R runs (5) plus B runs (3) \u2192 8? But n is 5+3=8. So that's correct. \n\nThe maximum run here is 2 (the first R run). \n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute the number of R runs: runs_r = b +1 \n\nEach R run has base = r // runs_r \n\nremainder = r % runs_r \n\nThen, the R runs are a list where the first 'remainder' runs have base +1, and the rest have base. \n\nThen, the string is constructed by alternating R runs and B's. \n\nWait, but the B's are single characters between each R run. \n\nSo the string starts with the first R run, then a B, then next R run, then B, etc., except after the last R run, there's no B. \n\nWait, the number of B's is (runs_r -1). Because between runs_r R runs, there are runs_r-1 B's. \n\nBut the total B's must be exactly b. Since runs_r = b+1 \u2192 runs_r-1 = b. So that's correct. \n\nSo the code steps:\n\nConstruct the list of R runs. \n\nThen, the string is built by:\n\nresult = ''\n\nfor i in 0 to runs_r-1:\n\n    add 'R' * (run_length[i])\n\n    if i is not the last run:\n\n        add 'B'\n\nSo that's the way. \n\nNow, coding this in Python. \n\nThe code for program1.py:\n\nThe input is read as for s in [*open(0)][1:], which is each line after the first. \n\nEach line is split into n, r, b. \n\nWait, the input for each test case is a line with three integers: n, r, b. \n\nSo for each line in the input (after the first line which is t), we need to process it. \n\nThe code for program1.py would be something like:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][1:]:\n    n, r, b = map(int, s.split())\n    # compute the R runs\n    runs_r = b +1\n    base = r // runs_r\n    rem = r % runs_r\n    # create the list of run lengths for R\n    r_runs = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        if i < rem:\n            r_runs.append(base +1)\n        else:\n            r_runs.append(base)\n    # build the string\n    res = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        res.append('R' * r_runs[i])\n        if i < runs_r -1:\n            res.append('B')\n    # join all parts\n    print(''.join(res))\n\nWait, but what if the runs_r is zero? No, since b is at least 1 (since b < r and r +b =n, and n >=3). \n\nWait, when b is 0? But the problem states that b is strictly less than r, but since r +b =n, and n >=3, then b can be zero? Wait, the input constraints say 1 \u2264 b < r \u2264 n. So b is at least 1. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, let's test with the first example given in the note. \n\nFirst test case example: n=7, r=4, b=3. \n\nruns_r = 3+1 =4. \n\nbase =4//4=1, rem=0. \n\nSo all runs are 1. \n\nSo the R runs are [1,1,1,1]. \n\nThen the string is R B R B R B R \u2192 \"RBRBRBR\", which matches the example. \n\nAnother test case: second example in the note, which is the second test case. \n\nSuppose the second test case is r=5, b=3, n=8. \n\nThen runs_r =4. \n\nr=5 divided by 4 \u2192 base 1, rem 1. \n\nSo first run is 2, then 1,1,1. \n\nThe string is \"RRB R B R B R\" \u2192 \"RRBRBRBR\". The maximum run is 2. \n\nWhich matches the note's example. \n\nOkay, that seems correct. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem for program2 is to determine if a given string of W, R, B can be formed by stamping. Each stamp covers two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects both cells. \n\nThe key is to find whether the given string can be formed through such operations. \n\nThe approach here is to model the possible transitions. Let's think of the string and see what constraints must hold. \n\nFirst, note that every occurrence of a non-W character must be part of at least one stamp. Because the initial state is all W, and each stamp changes two cells. \n\nWait, but overlapping stamps can affect the same cell multiple times. \n\nHmm, the problem allows applying the stamp multiple times. So each cell can be part of multiple stamps. \n\nThe key observation is that any non-W character must be adjacent to another non-W character in some way. \n\nWait, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n- All non-W characters must form a sequence where every R or B is adjacent to another non-W character in a way that they can be covered by overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, the string must not have any isolated non-W characters. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So any single non-W (like a single R or B) cannot exist unless it's part of a pair. \n\nWait, but if a single R is present, then it must have been created by a stamp that included it and another cell. But if that other cell is W, then that's impossible. \n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"R\", then n=1. But since the stamp requires two cells, it's impossible. So the answer is NO. \n\nAnother example: \"RW\" \u2192 the first cell is R. To get R in the first cell, the stamp must have been applied to positions 0 and 1 (assuming 0-based). But then the second cell would be B or R. So the first cell can't be R alone. \n\nSo the first condition is that all non-W characters must be in pairs or sequences where they can be covered by overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that every non-W character is part of at least one pair of adjacent non-W characters. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the non-W characters must form a sequence where between any two non-W characters, there are no W's. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that all non-W characters form a single continuous block, and the block's length is at least 1, but even that may not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. The entire string must be such that every non-W character is part of at least one pair of adjacent non-W characters. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the example given in the note, the fifth test case is \"BRB\". Let's see:\n\nThe example's fifth case is \"BRB\" (assuming the input is \"BRB\"). \n\nThe steps were: \n\nStart with WWW \u2192 stamp at positions 0-1 to get WRB \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 again (but that would flip again?), or perhaps another position. \n\nWait the example's fifth case's explanation says:\n\nThe steps were:\n\nWWW \u2192 stamp at positions 1-2 (assuming 0-based?), resulting in W followed by RB. Wait, the example's explanation says:\n\nThe fifth test case's example is \"W R B B W\" (but the example's description might be different). \n\nWait the note says for the fifth test case, the steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W R B \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 (BR?), leading to BRB. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the non-W characters must form a sequence where every R or B is adjacent to another non-W character except possibly at the ends. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must not have any isolated non-W characters. \n\nWait, let's think of the constraints:\n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells. So every non-W character must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nBut since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, perhaps the key is that the non-W characters form a sequence where between any two non-W characters, there are no W's. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire string must be such that all non-W characters form a single contiguous block. Because otherwise, there would be a W separating two non-W parts, which can't be formed. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"RWB\". The non-W parts are R and B, separated by a W. This can't be formed because the R and B are separated by a W, so there's no way to have a stamp covering them. \n\nSo the first condition is that all non-W characters must form a single contiguous block. \n\nSecond, within that block, the sequence must be possible to form via the stamps. \n\nAdditionally, the block must have length at least 1, but since the stamp requires two cells, the minimal non-W block is two cells. \n\nWait, but the problem allows using zero stamps, which means the entire string is all W's. So if the input is all W's, the answer is YES. \n\nSo the first step is to check if all non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\nIf not, then it's impossible. \n\nSecond, within that block, the sequence must satisfy certain conditions. \n\nLet me think of the block. Let's consider the block as a substring s. \n\nThe block must be such that it can be formed by a series of stamps. \n\nEach stamp can be either BR or RB in some positions. \n\nThe key is that the entire block must be possible to be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nAnother observation: every pair of adjacent characters in the block must be either BR, RB, or WW (but since it's part of the non-W block, they can't be WW). \n\nWait, no. Because each stamp changes two cells to either BR or RB. So any two adjacent cells in the final block must have been part of at least one stamp. \n\nWait, but overlapping stamps can create other combinations. \n\nAlternatively, the entire block must be such that it can be represented as a sequence of overlapping BR or RB pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire block must alternate between B and R, except possibly for the first and last characters. \n\nWait, let's think of the possible sequences. \n\nSuppose the block is \"BRB\". \n\nThis can be formed by first applying a stamp at positions 0-1 (BR), then at 1-2 (RB). \n\nThe first stamp gives BRW, then the second stamp (positions 1-2) would turn into RB, so the result is B followed by RB \u2192 BRB. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: \"RRB\". \n\nHow can this be formed? \n\nFirst, apply a stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RB followed by W. Then, apply a stamp at 0-1 again as BR? No, that would flip again. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 gives W R B. Then, another stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R R B. \n\nYes. So that works. \n\nSo the sequence RRB is possible. \n\nHmm, so the sequence can have two R's in a row. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nThe first stamp at 0-1 gives RB. Then another stamp at 0-1 as BR would flip to BR again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. \n\nWait, the first stamp at 0-1 gives RB. Then, a stamp at 0-1 again as BR (so the first cell is B and second R?), but that would flip the first two to BR. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, the key is that the entire block must not have three of the same character in a row. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the block is \"RRR\". \n\nIs this possible? \n\nLet me see. \n\nSuppose we try to form RRR. \n\nFirst, apply a stamp at positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RB followed by W. \n\nThen, apply a stamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 gives RBR. \n\nThen, apply a stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 which would turn the first two into BR, so B followed by R, then the third is R \u2192 BRR. \n\nHmm, not getting there. \n\nAlternatively, another approach. \n\nWait, maybe it's impossible to have three R's in a row. \n\nBecause each R must be part of a pair with either B or R? \n\nWait, each R must be part of a stamp's pair. \n\nWait, the first R in the triplet must be part of a pair with the next character. \n\nIf the triplet is R R R, then the first two R's must have been set by a stamp. But a stamp can only set them to BR or RB. So two R's in a row can only be formed if they were set by overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, for example, the first two R's could be from a stamp that set them as BR, but then another stamp overlapping them. \n\nHmm, let's see:\n\nSuppose we have three R's. \n\nFirst, apply a stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives R B. \n\nThen, apply a stamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 gives B R. \n\nNow the sequence is R B R. \n\nThen, apply a stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 which would turn the first two into B R. \n\nNow the sequence is B R R. \n\nHmm, so two R's. \n\nAlternatively, another approach. \n\nHmm, perhaps the triplet RRR is impossible. \n\nSo the condition is that there are no three of the same character in a row. \n\nWait, but the example given in the note's fifth case is \"BRB\", which is allowed. \n\nAnother example: \"RRBR\" \u2192 is that possible? \n\nHmm, perhaps. \n\nAlternatively, the key is that the entire block must be such that between any two same characters, there is at least one different character. \n\nWait, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n2. The block does not contain three of the same character in a row. \n\n3. The block's length is 0 (all W's) or at least 1, but when non-zero, the first and last characters can be anything, but the rest must alternate? \n\nAlternatively, the block can have runs of up to two same characters. \n\nWait, let's think of the possible sequences. \n\nEach stamp adds either BR or RB to two adjacent cells. \n\nEach application can be thought of as adding a pair of B and R in some order. \n\nThe key is that the entire block must be constructible by overlapping these pairs. \n\nLet me think of the block as a string s. \n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n- The entire non-W part is a single block. \n\n- The block does not have three identical consecutive characters. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the block has three R's in a row, like RRR, then it's impossible. \n\nBecause each pair of R's must have been set by a stamp, but a stamp can't set two R's. \n\nWait, a stamp can only set two cells to BR or RB. So two R's can only be formed if they are part of overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, for example, the first two R's could be from a stamp that set them as BR (so first is B, second R?), no. \n\nHmm, perhaps the only way to have two R's in a row is if they are part of overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose we have two R's in a row. \n\nHow can that happen? \n\nSuppose the first two cells are set by a stamp as RB (so first is R, second B). Then, another stamp on positions 1-2 as BR (so second becomes B, third R). \n\nWait, that would give R B R. \n\nHmm, not two R's. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThen stamp at 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nSo the first two are B R. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThen stamp at 0-1 again as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nHmm, not getting two R's. \n\nWait, maybe two R's can't be formed. \n\nWait, the only way to have two R's is if a stamp was applied in a way that one of the cells was already R from a previous stamp. \n\nWait, for example:\n\nFirst stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThen, stamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the sequence is R B R. \n\nThen, stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the first two are B R, and the third is R \u2192 B R R. \n\nAh! So here, the last two are R R. \n\nSo that's possible. \n\nSo two R's in a row are allowed. \n\nSo the triplet R R is allowed, but three R's in a row would require three R's. \n\nLet me see if that's possible. \n\nSuppose we have three R's. \n\nLet me try to construct it. \n\nStart with WWW. \n\nStamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nStamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the string is R B R. \n\nThen, stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R R. \n\nNow the first two are B R, third R \u2192 B R R. \n\nThen, stamp at 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nNow the string is B R B. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, another approach. \n\nStamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R. \n\nNow R B R. \n\nStamp at 0-1 as RB again \u2192 R B again. \n\nSo first two R B, third R \u2192 R B R. \n\nHmm, not getting three R's. \n\nHmm, maybe three R's in a row is impossible. \n\nSo the condition is that there are no three of the same character in a row. \n\nSo the block must not have three same characters consecutively. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n2. The block has no three identical consecutive characters. \n\nAdditionally, the block can be of length 0 (all W's \u2192 allowed). \n\nWait, but what about a block of length 1? Like \"R\" in a string of length 1. \n\nThen the block is length 1, but since the stamp requires two cells, it's impossible. So the answer would be NO. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W block must be of length 0 (all W's \u2192 allowed) or length \u22652. \n\nWait, no. Because if the block is length 1, it's impossible. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n- The length of this block is 0 (all W's \u2192 allowed) or \u22652. \n\n- The block does not have three identical consecutive characters. \n\nWait, but even a block of length 2 with two same characters is allowed. \n\nFor example, \"RR\" can be formed by applying a stamp in one way and then another? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTo get \"RR\", the two cells must be set to R and R. \n\nBut a stamp can only set them to BR or RB. \n\nSo it's impossible to have two R's in a row. \n\nWait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, the stamp can only set two cells to either BR or RB. So two R's in a row can't be formed directly. \n\nWait, but earlier example where we had B R R \u2192 the last two R's were possible. \n\nWait, in that case, the first two were B R, then the third R was added via a stamp. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose the string is \"RR\". \n\nTo get this, the two cells must be R and R. \n\nBut each stamp can only set them to BR or RB. \n\nSo it's impossible. \n\nSo the block of two R's is impossible. \n\nAh! So the two same characters in a row are also impossible. \n\nWait, so the only allowed pairs are BR or RB. \n\nWait, but in the example given in the note's fifth case, the result is \"BRB\", which has B followed by R followed by B. \n\nSo the pairs are BR and RB. \n\nSo the two same characters in a row are not allowed. \n\nWait, so the block must alternate between B and R, except possibly for the first and last characters? \n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe example's fifth case is \"BRB\", which is allowed. \n\nAnother example: \"RBR\" is allowed. \n\nBut \"RR\" is not allowed. \n\nSo the necessary conditions are:\n\nThe block must be such that no two identical characters are adjacent. \n\nWait, that would mean that the entire block is an alternating sequence of B and R. \n\nBut then how can we have a block like \"BRB\"? \n\nYes, that's alternating. \n\nBut then the block must be an alternating sequence of B and R, with no two same characters in a row. \n\nWait, but then the length must be even or odd? \n\nWait, for example, \"BRB\" is allowed (length 3). \n\nSo the length can be even or odd. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n- The block has no two identical consecutive characters. \n\n- The block's length is 0 (all W's) or at least 1. \n\nWait, but the block length can be 1? \n\nWait, if the block is length 1, then it's a single non-W character. But that can't be formed because each stamp requires two cells. \n\nSo the block length must be 0 or \u22652. \n\nWait, but if the block is length 1, it's impossible. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n2. The block length is 0 (all W's \u2192 allowed) or \u22652. \n\n3. The block has no two identical consecutive characters. \n\nWait, but in the example where we had \"BRR\" (from earlier steps?), that would have two R's in a row, which would violate condition 3. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \"BRR\" could be formed. \n\nWait, let me re-examine that. \n\nSuppose the string is \"BRR\". \n\nThe block is BRR. \n\nThe two R's are adjacent, so they violate condition 3. \n\nSo that would be invalid. \n\nBut earlier I thought that it was possible to get BRR. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nLet me try to see how to get BRR. \n\nSuppose we have three cells. \n\nStart with WWW. \n\nStamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. \n\nStamp at 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nNow the string is B R B. \n\nHmm, not BRR. \n\nAlternatively, stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. \n\nThen stamp at 0-1 again as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nNo. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's impossible to get BRR. \n\nSo the condition 3 is correct. \n\nSo the necessary conditions are:\n\n- The non-W block is contiguous. \n\n- The block length is 0 or \u22652. \n\n- The block has no two identical consecutive characters. \n\nWait, but what about a block like \"BRBRB\"? That's allowed. \n\nYes, because it alternates. \n\nSo the algorithm for program2 is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Check if the non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n- Check the length of the block is 0 or \u22652. \n\n- Check that in the block, no two consecutive characters are the same. \n\nIf all these are true, then output YES, else NO. \n\nWait, but what about the case where the block is of length 2 with different characters? \n\nLike \"BR\" \u2192 allowed. \n\nYes, that's okay. \n\nAnother case: \"RB\" \u2192 allowed. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's see the note's examples. \n\nThe second, third, and fourth test cases have single cells or isolated non-W characters, so they would fail the contiguous block condition. \n\nThe fifth test case's example is \"BRB\" \u2192 which meets all conditions. \n\nThe sixth test case's example is \"RBB\". \n\nWait, the sixth test case's example is \"RBB\". \n\nWait, the note says the sixth test case can be formed as follows: \n\nWWW \u2192 stamp at 1-2 (assuming 0-based?) gives W followed by RB \u2192 WRB. Then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B B. \n\nWait, the final string is \"RBB\". \n\nWait, but according to our conditions, the block is \"RBB\", which has two B's in a row \u2192 violates condition 3. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the note says the sixth test case is possible. \n\nWait, the note says:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RR B. So the final string is \"RRB\". \n\nWait, the note's sixth test case's example is \"RRB\". \n\nWait, the note says:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RR B. So the final string is \"RRB\". \n\nWait, in that case, the final string is \"RRB\". \n\nThe block is \"RRB\". \n\nThe first two R's are same, so that violates the condition. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my conditions are incorrect. \n\nWait, the sixth test case's example in the note says the answer is YES. \n\nWait, the sixth test case's example is \"RRB\". \n\nAccording to my conditions, this would be invalid because the first two R's are same. \n\nBut according to the note, it is possible. \n\nSo my conditions are wrong. \n\nHmm, so I need to rethink. \n\nLet me re-examine the sixth test case's example. \n\nThe note says:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RR B. \n\nWait, the first step is stamp at positions 1-2 (assuming 0-based) to get W followed by RB \u2192 \"WRB\". \n\nThen, stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 which would set positions 0 and 1 to R and B. \n\nWait, the first cell was W, so after the first stamp, it's W at 0, R at 1, B at 2. \n\nThen, applying a stamp at 0-1 as RB (so first cell becomes R, second B). \n\nSo the first two cells become R and B. \n\nThe third cell remains B. \n\nSo the final string is R B B. \n\nWait, that's \"RBB\". \n\nWait, but the note says the sixth test case's example is \"RRB\". \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sixth test case's example is \"RRB\". \n\nWait, let me re-read the note's sixth test case explanation:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RR B. \n\nWait, the second step's stamp at 0-1 as RB would set positions 0 and 1 to R and B. \n\nThe first cell was W, so after the first stamp (positions 1-2), the first cell is W. \n\nThen, applying a stamp at 0-1 as RB (so first cell becomes R, second B). \n\nSo the first two cells are R and B. \n\nThe third cell is B. \n\nSo the final string is R B B \u2192 \"RBB\". \n\nBut the note says the sixth test case's example is \"RRB\". \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second stamp is applied as BR. \n\nWait, the stamp can be rotated. \n\nSo the second stamp at 0-1 can be applied as BR, which would set the first cell to B and second to R. \n\nWait, but that would give B R B. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second stamp is applied at positions 0-1 as RB, but the first cell was W. \n\nSo after first stamp (positions 1-2 \u2192 RB), the string is W R B. \n\nThen, applying a stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 first cell becomes R, second becomes B. \n\nSo the string becomes R B B. \n\nSo the final string is RBB. \n\nBut the note says the sixth test case's example is \"RRB\". \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sixth test case's example is \"RBR\". \n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the note's sixth example. \n\nThe note says:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RR B. \n\nWait, the second step's result is \"RRB\". \n\nAh, perhaps the first stamp is applied at positions 0-1 (not 1-2). \n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nFirst stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives R B W. \n\nSecond stamp at 0-1 as RB again \u2192 R B \u2192 applying RB again would set first

\u2192 \"RBR\". \n\nWhich is allowed. \n\nBut the note's example says the sixth test case's answer is possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the sixth test case's example is \"RRB\", which would violate the conditions. \n\nBut according to the note's explanation, it is possible. \n\nThis suggests that my previous conditions are incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I need to think differently. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells. \n\nThe final string must be such that every non-W character is part of at least one pair of adjacent non-W characters. \n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that every non-W character is part of a sequence that can be built by overlapping stamps. \n\nAnother idea: the entire string must be such that the non-W characters form a sequence where every pair of consecutive characters is either BR or RB. \n\nWait, that would mean that the non-W block must alternate between B and R. \n\nBut then the sixth test case's example of \"RBB\" would have the last two B's, which is not allowed. \n\nBut according to the note's example, it's possible. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the note's sixth test case is \"RRB\". \n\nWait, let me re-express the note's sixth example:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 gives RR B. \n\nWait, the first step is stamp at positions 1-2 (assuming 0-based) to get W R B. \n\nThen, stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 first cell becomes R, second B. \n\nSo the string becomes R B B. \n\nSo the final string is \"RBB\". \n\nThe non-W block is \"RBB\". \n\nThe first two characters are R and B (okay), but the last two are B and B (invalid). \n\nBut according to the note, this is allowed. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous conditions are wrong. \n\nSo I must have misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait, the problem allows the stamp to be applied multiple times. \n\nPerhaps overlapping stamps can create two B's in a row. \n\nLet me think of the example \"RBB\". \n\nHow can this be formed? \n\nLet me try to find a sequence of stamps that results in \"RBB\". \n\nStart with WWW. \n\nFirst, apply a stamp at positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nSecond, apply a stamp at positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the string is R B R. \n\nThird, apply a stamp at positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the stamp at positions 1-2 as RB would set position 1 to R and 2 to B. \n\nWait, the current string after second step is R B R. \n\nApplying a stamp at 1-2 as RB would set positions 1 and 2 to R and B. \n\nSo the string becomes R R B. \n\nAh! So the third step gives R R B. \n\nSo the final string is \"RRB\". \n\nAh! So the example's sixth test case is \"RRB\". \n\nThen the non-W block is \"RRB\". \n\nThe first two R's are same, but the third is B. \n\nSo the first two R's are consecutive. \n\nBut according to the note, this is allowed. \n\nSo my previous conditions are incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition? \n\nThe problem allows two same characters in a row, but how? \n\nIn the example \"RRB\", the first two R's are consecutive. \n\nHow was that formed? \n\nThe first stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nSecond stamp at 0-1 as RB again \u2192 R B \u2192 no, that would set them to R and B again. \n\nWait, the second stamp is applied at 0-1 as RB again. \n\nWait, the first stamp gives R B W. \n\nThe second stamp at 0-1 as RB would set the first two to R and B again. \n\nNo change. \n\nHmm, perhaps the second stamp is applied as BR. \n\nWait, the second stamp at 0-1 as BR would set first to B and second to R. \n\nSo the string becomes B R W. \n\nNot helpful. \n\nWait, the third step in the example's explanation is: \n\nAfter the first step (W RB \u2192 \"WRB\"), then stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 which would set the first two to R and B. \n\nThe first character was W, so after the first stamp (positions 1-2), it's W R B. \n\nThen, applying a stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 first becomes R, second B. \n\nSo the first two are R and B. \n\nThe third is B. \n\nSo the string is R B B. \n\nBut the note says the result is RR B. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second stamp is applied at positions 0-1 as BR. \n\nWait, the first step is W R B. \n\nSecond stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 first becomes B, second R. \n\nSo the string is B R B. \n\nNot helpful. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. \n\nPerhaps I need to think of the problem differently. \n\nThe key is that every non-W character must be part of at least one stamp's pair. \n\nBut the stamps can overlap. \n\nThe necessary conditions are:\n\n- The entire non-W block must be such that every character except possibly the first and last can be part of two pairs. \n\nAlternatively, the entire block must be such that it can be represented as a sequence of overlapping BR or RB pairs. \n\nFor example, the string \"RRB\" can be formed as follows:\n\nFirst stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nSecond stamp at 0-1 as RB again \u2192 no change. \n\nHmm, not working. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. \n\nSecond stamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nNow the string is B R B. \n\nNot RRB. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nSecond stamp at 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the string is R B R. \n\nThird stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nNow the string is R B R \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nSecond stamp at 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. \n\nThird stamp at 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nNo progress. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's sixth test case is \"RBR\", which is allowed. \n\nBut the note says the sixth test case's example is \"RRB\". \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nThe problem requires that the string can be formed by any number of stamps. \n\nEach stamp changes two adjacent cells to either BR or RB. \n\nThe key observation is that the final string must not have any occurrence of \"WW\" in the non-W block. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that every non-W character is adjacent to at least one other non-W character. \n\nBecause each non-W character must have been part of a stamp. \n\nSo the non-W block must be contiguous, and every non-W character must be adjacent to another non-W character. \n\nThus, the block must be of length \u22652, and all non-W characters are in a single block. \n\nAdditionally, the block must not have three of the same character in a row. \n\nWait, but the example \"RRB\" has two R's in a row. \n\nSo that would violate the three-in-a-row condition, but the two R's are allowed. \n\nSo the three-in-a-row condition is not necessary. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: the entire non-W block must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping BR or RB pairs. \n\nFor example, \"RRB\" can be written as BR followed by RB? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first two characters are RR. \n\nBut BR or RB can't form RR. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nFor example, \"RRB\" can be formed by:\n\nStamp 1: positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. \n\nStamp 2: positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nStamp 3: positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R. \n\nSo after three stamps, the string is R B R. \n\nNot RRB. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe string can be formed if and only if:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single contiguous block. \n\n2. The block has length 0 or at least 2. \n\n3. The block does not contain three identical characters in a row. \n\nWait, but the example \"RRB\" has two R's in a row, which is allowed. \n\nSo the third condition should be that there are no three identical characters in a row. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W block is contiguous. \n\n- The block length is 0 or \u22652. \n\n- The block has no three identical consecutive characters. \n\nThen, the example \"RRB\" has two R's, which is allowed. \n\nThe example \"RBB\" has two B's, which is allowed. \n\nThe example \"RRR\" is invalid. \n\nSo the sixth test case's example of \"RRB\" would be allowed. \n\nThe block is \"RRB\", which has two R's followed by a B. \n\nThe two R's are allowed as long as there are no three in a row. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- contiguous block. \n\n- length \u22652 (or zero). \n\n- no three same in a row. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Find the first and last indices of non-W characters. \n\n- If there are none (all W), then it's possible. \n\n- Else, check if all characters between first and last are non-W. \n\n- Check the length is at least 2. \n\n- Check that there are no three consecutive same characters in the block. \n\nWait, but what about two same characters? \n\nThey are allowed as long as they are not part of three. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- contiguous block. \n\n- length \u22652. \n\n- no three in a row. \n\nSo the code for program2 would be:\n\nRead the string s. \n\nFind the first and last indices of non-W characters. \n\nIf there are none \u2192 YES. \n\nElse:\n\n- Check that all characters between first and last are non-W. \n\n- Check that the length of the block (last - first +1) is \u22652. \n\n- Check that in the block, there are no three consecutive same characters. \n\nIf all these are true \u2192 YES, else NO. \n\nWait, but what about the case where the block has two same characters but not three? \n\nLike \"RRB\" \u2192 allowed. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" \u2192 allowed. \n\n\"RR\" \u2192 allowed (two R's, no three). \n\n\"RRR\" \u2192 not allowed. \n\n\"RBRBR\" \u2192 allowed. \n\n\"RBB\" \u2192 allowed (two B's). \n\nSo this should work. \n\nNow, coding this in Python. \n\nThe code for program2.py is given as:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nWait, the code structure is a bit unclear. \n\nThe input for program2 is read as follows: \n\nThe first line is t. \n\nThen for each test case, there are two lines: n and s. \n\nThe code for program2 is given as:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to process each test case's string s. \n\nThe code is looping over every second line starting from the second line (since the first line is t, then each test case has two lines: n and s. So the strings are at indices 2,4,6 etc. \n\nThe variable 'b' is initialized to 0, and then for each part in s.split(\"W\"), except the last character (s[:-1]?) \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to split the string into non-W segments. \n\nThe code's current structure is incomplete. \n\nThe correct approach would be:\n\nFor each test case's string s:\n\n- Find the first and last indices of non-W characters. \n\n- If there are none \u2192 answer is YES. \n\nElse:\n\n- Check that all characters between first and last are non-W. \n\n- Check the length of the block (last - first +1) is \u22652. \n\n- Check that in the block, there are no three consecutive same characters. \n\nIf all conditions are met \u2192 YES, else NO. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor each test case's string s:\n\n    first = -1\n    last = -1\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] != 'W':\n            if first == -1:\n                first = i\n            last = i\n    if first == -1:  # all W\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    # check contiguous block\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # check length >=2\n    if (last - first +1) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # check no three in a row\n    for i in range(first, last-1):\n        if s[i] == s[i+1] == s[i+2]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut this needs to be implemented in the given code structure. \n\nThe given code for program2 starts with:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to split the string into non-W segments. \n\nThe variable 'b' is used to determine the output. \n\nThe 'YNEOS' string is used to index into. For example, if b is 0, then 'YNEOS'[0::2] is 'YES', since 0::2 is 'Y', 'N', 'S'? \n\nWait, the string 'YNEOS' is length 5. \n\nThe code uses 'YNEOS '[b::2]. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to set b to 1 if the answer is NO, and 0 for YES. \n\nThe code's current structure is incomplete. \n\nThe correct approach would be to compute whether the conditions are met, and set b to 0 (YES) or 1 (NO). \n\nSo, the code for program2 would be:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    first = -1\n    last = -1\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] != 'W':\n            if first == -1:\n                first = i\n            last = i\n    if first == -1:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    # check contiguous\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    length = last - first +1\n    if length <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # check three in a row\n    for i in range(first, last-1):\n        if s[i] == s[i+1] and s[i] == s[i+2]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut the given code structure uses a different approach. \n\nThe original code for program2 has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to split the string into non-W segments by splitting on 'W's. \n\nThe 'split(\"W\")' would split the string into parts separated by W. \n\nFor example, if the string is \"BRB\", then splitting on W gives [\"BRB\"], since there are no W's. \n\nIf the string is \"RWB\", then splitting on W gives [\"R\", \"B\"]. \n\nThe code is looping over these parts. \n\nThe variable 'b' is initialized to 0. \n\nThe idea might be that if any of the non-W segments has length 0 or 1, then it's invalid. \n\nWait, but the code is using s[:-1].split(\"W\"), which may be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check that all non-W segments are of length 1 or 2, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of non-W segments. \n\nIf there are multiple non-W segments (split by W), then it's invalid. \n\nSo the code could be:\n\nfor each test case's string s:\n\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    # filter out empty strings (from leading/trailing W)\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    if not non_empty:  # all W\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    if len(non_empty) !=1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # now check the single non-W part\n    part = non_empty[0]\n    if len(part) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # check no three in a row\n    for i in range(len(part)-2):\n        if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    # else clause for the for loop\n    # but need to handle the break case. \n\nHmm, this approach would work. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    if not non_empty:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    if len(non_empty) !=1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    part = non_empty[0]\n    if len(part) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(part)-2):\n        if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nThis should work. \n\nNow, let's see the sixth test case's example of \"RRB\". \n\nThe parts after splitting on W are [\"RRB\"], so non_empty has length 1. \n\nThe part length is 3. \n\nCheck for three in a row: \n\nIndices 0,1,2: 'R', 'R', 'B' \u2192 first two are same, but third is different. \n\nNo three in a row. \n\nSo valid \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example's sixth test case is allowed. \n\nAnother example: \"RBB\" \u2192 part is \"RBB\". \n\nCheck indices 0-2: 'R', 'B', 'B' \u2192 no three in a row. \n\nSo allowed. \n\nThe example \"RRR\" \u2192 part is \"RRR\". \n\nIndices 0-2: all R \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus, the code works. \n\nNow, the original code for program2 has a loop over s[:-1].split(\"W\"). \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to split the string into parts between W's, and then check each part. \n\nThe variable 'b' is set to 1 if any part is invalid. \n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThe 's[:-1]' may be a mistake, perhaps it should be s. \n\nThe code's 'split(\"W\")' would split the string into parts separated by W. \n\nThe loop over each part (i) in the split parts. \n\nThe code needs to check:\n\n- The number of non-empty parts must be exactly 1. \n\n- The length of that part must be \u22652. \n\n- The part has no three consecutive same characters. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    if not non_empty:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    if len(non_empty)!=1:\n        b =1\n    else:\n        part = non_empty[0]\n        if len(part)<2:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                if part[i]==part[i+1]==part[i+2]:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n            else:\n                b=0\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nWait, the output uses 'YNEOS '[b::2]. \n\nIf b is 0 \u2192 'YNEOS'[0::2] \u2192 'Y' followed by 'N' followed by 'S' \u2192 but the slice is every 2 characters starting at 0. \n\nThe string 'YNEOS' is 'Y','N','E','O','S'. \n\nSo 'YNEOS'[0::2] \u2192 'Y', 'E', 'S' \u2192 but the desired output is 'YES' or 'NO'. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code uses a different string. \n\nThe original code's print line is 'YNEOS '[b::2]. \n\nWait, perhaps the string is 'YNEOS' with a space at the beginning? \n\nWait, the code says 'YNEOS '[b::2]. \n\nThe string is 'YNEOS ' (with a space at the end?), but perhaps it's a typo. \n\nAlternatively, the code uses 'YNEOS' as the string. \n\nLet me see:\n\nIf b is 0 \u2192 slice starts at 0, step 2 \u2192 characters 0,2,4 \u2192 'Y', 'E', 'S' \u2192 'YES'. \n\nIf b is 1 \u2192 starts at 1, step 2 \u2192 'N', 'O' \u2192 'NO'. \n\nYes! \n\nSo the code's print statement is correct. \n\nThus, the code for program2 can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    b = 0\n    if not non_empty:\n        pass  # remains 0 \u2192 YES\n    else:\n        if len(non_empty)!=1:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            part = non_empty[0]\n            if len(part) <2:\n                b=1\n            else:\n                for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                    if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThis should work. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the missing code for program1 and program2 are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe code after the for loop:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][1:]:\n    n, r, b = map(int, s.split())\n    runs_r = b +1\n    base = r // runs_r\n    rem = r % runs_r\n    r_runs = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        if i < rem:\n            r_runs.append(base +1)\n        else:\n            r_runs.append(base)\n    res = []\n    for i in range(runs_r):\n        res.append('R' * r_runs[i])\n        if i < runs_r-1:\n            res.append('B')\n    print(''.join(res))\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe code inside the loop:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    b = 0\n    if not non_empty:\n        pass\n    else:\n        if len(non_empty)!=1:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            part = non_empty[0]\n            if len(part) <2:\n                b=1\n            else:\n                for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                    if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nBut the original code for program2 has a loop over s[:-1].split(\"W\"), which may be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written using the original structure but with the correct logic. \n\nThe original code for program2 has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThe 's[:-1]' may be a mistake (should be s), and the loop over the parts. \n\nThe code inside the loop can be:\n\nparts = s.split('W')\nnon_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\nif not non_empty:\n    pass\nelse:\n    if len(non_empty)!=1:\n        b=1\n    else:\n        part = non_empty[0]\n        if len(part) <2:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                    b=1\n                    break\nprint('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nBut the original code uses a loop over the parts. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    b = 0\n    if not non_empty:\n        pass\n    else:\n        if len(non_empty)!=1:\n            b=1\n        else:\n            part = non_empty[0]\n            if len(part) <2:\n                b=1\n            else:\n                for i in range(len(part)-2):\n                    if part[i] == part[i+1] == part[i+2]:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThis should work. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 and program2 are as above."
