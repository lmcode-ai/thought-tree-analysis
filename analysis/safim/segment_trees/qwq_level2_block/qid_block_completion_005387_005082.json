Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of examples. Take the first sample input where the optimal subsegment gives 9. The global max and min are 6 and 1 (assuming the array is like [1,2,3,4,5,6, ...] but the example's note says the first test case's optimal is l=7, r=8. The outside's max is 6 (since the subsegment is the last two elements?), so the outside's max is 6 and min is 1. The sub's max and min are 5 and 1, so (6-1)+(5-1)=10? Wait the note says it's 9. Hmm, maybe I need to check the example again. Oh the note says the first test case's example gives (6-1)+(5-1)=9. Wait 6-1 is 5, 5-1 is 4, total 9. So the outside's max is 6, min is 1. The sub's max is 5, min is 1. So the sub's max is less than the global max. So the outside's max is still the global max. So in this case, the outside's max and min are the global ones.

The maximum sub_diff for a proper subsegment would be 5-1=4 (the subsegment in the example). So 6-1 +4 =9, which matches. Another example: the second test case's note says the answer is 297.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of an example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 5]. The global max is 5, min is 1. The full array's difference is 4. The proper subarrays are [1,3], [3,5], [1], [3], [5]. The max-min for [1,3] is 2, [3,5] is 2, so the maximum is 2. So the proper subarrays can't reach the global difference. So in this case, the maximum proper subarray's difference is 2, so the total beauty would be (5-1) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8? Wait but according to the problem's formula, the beauty would be (max outside - min outside) + (max sub - min sub). Wait in this example, if the subarray is [3,5], then the outside is [1]. The outside's max and min are 1. So the first part is 0. The second part is 5-3=2. So total is 2. But according to the approach I thought earlier, the total would be (5-1) + 2 = 6+2=8, which is wrong. Oh wait, this shows that my initial approach is incorrect. Hmm, so my previous reasoning was wrong. So I need to rethink the problem. Let me re-express the beauty formula:\n\nBeauty = (max(outside) - min(outside)) + (max(sub) - min(sub))",

Find the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for all subsegments that do not include the global max or the global min. \n\n3. The candidate is (global difference) + this maximum. \n\n4.",

Total is 1+199=200, but the note says 297. Wait, the note says the beauty is (100-2) + (200-1) = 98+199=297. Ah, so the outside's max is 100? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. The example's note says the second test case's optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based). The array is probably like [2, 1, 100, 200, 1]. The subsegment is positions 2-4 (1-based: elements 1, 100, 200). The outside is the first element (2) and the last (1). The outside's max is 2, min is 1. So first term is 2-1=1. The sub's max is 200, min is 1. So second term is 199. Total is 200. But the note says 297. Hmm, this suggests that my approach is wrong. Wait the note says the first part is (100-2) = 98. Ah, so the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. Wait, perhaps the array is different. Maybe the array is [2, 100, 200, 1, ...]. Wait, perhaps the example's array is [2, 100, 200, 1, ...]. Wait, the note says the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. So the outside must include 2 and 100. The subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based), which would be elements 100, 200, 1. The outside is the first element (2) and the elements after r=4 (if n is 5, then the last element is 1, but the subsegment includes it. Hmm, perhaps the array is [2, 100, 200, 1, 3]. Then the subsegment l=2 to r=4 (1-based) is elements 100, 200, 1. The outside is 2 and 3. The outside's max is 3, min is 2. So first term is 1. The second term is 200-1=199. Total 200. But the note says 297. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. The note says the first part is (100-2) + (200-1) = 98+199=297. So the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. The sub's max is 200 and min is 1. So the outside must include 100 and 2. The subsegment must exclude the 100?",

But according to the problem statement, the subsegment must be proper, so the entire array is not allowed. Thus, the algorithm should work. Now, to implement this in code. First, find the global max and min. Then find their positions. Then split into regions. Compute the max and min for each region. The maximum of their differences is the value to add. The final answer is global_diff + max_region_diff. But what if there are no regions excluding both? For example, if the global max and min are adjacent and at the ends. Like array [1, 5]. Global max is 5 at position 1, global min is 1 at position 0. The regions excluding both would be nothing. So the maximum region difference is 0. The candidate would be (5-1) +0 =4. But the proper subsegments are [1], [5], or [1,5] is not allowed. The subsegments are of length 1. For subsegment [1], the outside is [5]. The first term is 5-5=0. The second term is 1-1=0. Total 0. For subsegment [5], the outside is [1]. First term is 1-1=0. Second term is 5-5=0. So the maximum is 0. But the candidate would give 4, which is incorrect. So in this case, the algorithm would fail.

But if the array has length 4, and the global max and min are at positions 0 and 3, then the regions excluding both are the middle positions 1 and 2. Thus, there is a region. The only case where there are no regions is when the global max and min are adjacent and at the ends. Like array of length 2: [1,5]. In this case, the proper subsegments are of length 1. The maximum beauty is 0. The candidate would be (5-1) +0 =4, which is incorrect. Thus, the algorithm would fail for this case. But the problem's input constraints state that n is at least 4. Ah! The problem's input specifies that n is at least 4. So the case of n=2 is not possible. Thus, for n>=4, there must be at least one region excluding both global max and min. Because the global max and min can't be adjacent and at both ends. For example, if the global max is at position 0 and the global min at position 3 (n=4), then the middle region is positions 1-2. Thus, there is a region. Thus, the algorithm should work for all cases with n>=4. Thus, the algorithm is correct. Now, to implement this in code. First, for each test case:\n\nRead the array. Compute the global max and min. \n\nFind their positions. Split into regions. Compute the max and min for each region. Find the maximum difference among these regions. The answer is global_diff + max_region_diff. Now, the code for program1.py. The given code for program1.py is:\n\nfor sdr in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is incomplete.",

Now, the code for program1.py:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    t = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n\n        n = int(input[ptr])\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n\n        ptr +=n\n\n        if n ==0:\n\n            print(0)\n\n            continue\n\n        # compute global max and min and their positions\n\n        global_max = -float('inf') global_min = float('inf')\n\n        max_pos = 0\n\n        min_pos =0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            if a[i] > global_max:\n\n                global_max = a[i]\n\n                max_pos = i\n\n            if a[i] < global_min:\n\n                global_min = a[i]\n\n                min_pos = i\n\n        # compute left and right \n\n        left = min(max_pos, min_pos) right = max(max_pos, min_pos)\n\n        regions = []\n\n        # left region: 0 to left-1\n\n        if left >0:\n\n            region = a[0:left]\n\n            regions.append(region)\n\n        # middle region: left+1 to right-1\n\n        if left+1 <= right-1:\n\n            region = a[left+1:right]\n\n            regions.append(region)\n\n        # right region: right+1 to n-1\n\n        if right+1 <n:\n\n            region = a[right+1:]\n\n            regions.append(region)\n\n        max_region_diff =0\n\n        for region in regions:\n\n            if not region:\n\n                continue\n\n            current_max = max(region)\n\n            current_min = min(region)\n\n            current_diff = current_max - current_min\n\n            if current_diff > max_region_diff:\n\n                max_region_diff = current_diff\n\n        global_diff = global_max - global_min\n\n        ans = global_diff + max_region_diff\n\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main( )\n\nWait, but what about cases where the regions are empty? The code checks for regions being non-empty. This should work. Now, for the second program, program2.py. The problem is to compute for each vertex i the number of trees where i is the centroid. The trees are defined such that each node i>1 has exactly one parent with a smaller index. The centroid is a node whose removal splits the tree into subtrees each of size at most (n-1)/2. The answer must be modulo 998244353. The given code for program2.py has some functions but is incomplete. The code provided is:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\ndef inv(x):\n\n    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\nMAX = 10 ** 6\n\nfact = [1]\n\nfor i in range(1, MAX):\n\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\ninvfact = [1] * (MAX)\n\ninvfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\n\nfor i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\n\n    invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\ndef comb(x, y):\n\n    return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y])) def invcomb(x, y):\n\n    return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]))\n\ndef invs(x):\n\n    return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\nn = int(input())\n\nout = [0] * n\n\nfor i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n\n    base = fact[n - 1]\n\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nrem = 0\n\nfor i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n\n    oldrem = rem\n\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i)) out[i] -= oldrem\n\n    rem %= MOD\n\n    out[i] %= MOD\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str,out))) The code has a modmul function that is incomplete. The modmul function is supposed to multiply two numbers modulo MOD, possibly adding a third term. The current code has modmul(x, y, c=0). The function should return (x*y + c) mod MOD. Thus, the code for modmul should be:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c=0):\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut the current code's modmul is missing. The rest of the code seems to be using modmul in various places. The problem is to complete the modmul function. The modmul function is used in several places, such as in the fact array computation. The code for modmul is the missing part. Thus, the missing code for program2.py is the modmul function. The modmul function should return (x*y + c) mod MOD. Thus, the completion for program2.py is:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c=0):\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD Thus, the JSON output should have the modmul function filled in for program2.",

Then, the beauty can be computed as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). The problem is to find the maximum of this over all proper subsegments. The steps would be:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min arrays. prefix_max[i] is the maximum of the first i elements (a[0..i-1], assuming 0-based). Similarly, prefix_min[i] is the minimum of the first i elements. Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1], and suffix_min[i] is the minimum of a[i..n-1]. Wait, perhaps:\n\nprefix_max is an array where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i]. Wait, let me think of the arrays properly. Let me define:\n\nprefix_max is an array of length n, where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i]. Similarly, prefix_min[i] is the minimum of a[0..i]. Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1], and suffix_min[i] is the minimum of a[i..n-1]. Then, for a subsegment [l, r] (0-based, l <= r), the outside is the elements before l and after r. The max of the outside is the maximum between prefix_max[l-1] (if l>0) and suffix_max[r+1] (if r < n-1). Similarly, the min of the outside is the minimum between prefix_min[l-1] and suffix_min[r+1]. The max_sub is the maximum of a[l..r], which can be found using a range max query. Similarly, the min_sub is the range min. So, to compute the beauty for a subsegment [l, r], we can do:\n\nmax_outside = max( (prefix_max[l-1] if l>0 else -infinity), (suffix_max[r+1] if r < n-1 else -infinity) ) Wait, but if l is 0, then the prefix part is nothing, so the outside's max is suffix_max[r+1].

Because excluding one element gives a proper subsegment, and the maximum of those could be a candidate. Let me see:\n\nFor the first sample's case, the optimal subsegment is of length 2 (assuming n=8?), so excluding one element would give a subsegment of length 7, which might not be the optimal. But the first sample's optimal subsegment is of length 2, so the maximum among subsegments of length n-1 may not be the best. Hmm. This is getting too time-consuming.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to find the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment of an array. The beauty is defined as the difference between the max and min of the elements outside the subsegment plus the difference between the max and min of the subsegment itself. \n\nHmm, the key here is to compute this efficiently because the array can be up to 1e5 elements. So a brute-force approach checking all possible subsegments would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. Need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the components of the beauty formula. The first part is the max minus min of the entire array except the subsegment. Wait, but the subsegment is a proper one, so the remaining elements are the parts before l and after r. Wait, actually, the first part is the max and min of the array excluding the subsegment from l to r. The second part is the max and min of the subsegment itself. \n\nWait, the beauty is (max(outside) - min(outside)) + (max(sub) - min(sub)). \n\nThe maximum possible value for this would be when the outside's max-min is as large as possible, and the sub's max-min is also as large as possible. But how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum possible beauty is the (global max - global min) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). Because the outside's max and min can't exceed the global max and min. Wait, but if the subsegment includes the global max or min, then the outside's max or min would be smaller. So maybe the best scenario is when the subsegment excludes the global max and min, so that the outside's max and min are the global ones. Then the beauty would be (global_max - global_min) + (max(sub) - min(sub)). But then the sub's max and min can be as large as possible. \n\nWait, but the subsegment can't be the entire array. So the maximum possible beauty would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max(sub) - min(sub)) for any proper subsegment. Wait, but that's only if the subsegment doesn't include the global max or min. Hmm, maybe not exactly, but perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)) of any subsegment. Because if the subsegment is a proper one, then the outside's max and min would still be the global ones unless the subsegment includes either the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)), but only when the subsegment doesn't include both the global max and min. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of examples.\n\nTake the first sample input where the optimal subsegment gives 9. The global max and min are 6 and 1 (assuming the array is like [1,2,3,4,5,6, ...] but the example's note says the first test case's optimal is l=7, r=8. The outside's max is 6 (since the subsegment is the last two elements?), so the outside's max is 6 and min is 1. The sub's max and min are 5 and 1, so (6-1)+(5-1)=10? Wait the note says it's 9. Hmm, maybe I need to check the example again. Oh the note says the first test case's example gives (6-1)+(5-1)=9. Wait 6-1 is 5, 5-1 is 4, total 9. So the outside's max is 6, min is 1. The sub's max is 5, min is 1. So the sub's max is less than the global max. So the outside's max is still the global max. So in this case, the outside's max and min are the global ones. So the beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus (max(sub) - min(sub)). \n\nSo perhaps the maximum beauty is indeed (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max(sub) - min(sub)) of any proper subsegment. Because the outside's max and min can't be larger than the global ones. So the first part is fixed as (global_max - global_min), and the second part is the maximum possible (max(sub) - min(sub)) for any proper subsegment. \n\nWait, but what if the subsegment includes the global max or min? Then the outside's max or min would be smaller. So in that case, the first part would be smaller. So the best scenario is when the subsegment does not include either the global max or min. Then the first part is (global_max - global_min), and the second part is the maximum possible (max(sub) - min(sub)). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)) over all proper subsegments, and adding it to (global_max - global_min). \n\nWait, but that's only if there exists a subsegment that doesn't include the global max or min. Otherwise, maybe the maximum is achieved when the subsegment excludes one of them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)), but the subsegment can be any proper subsegment. Because even if the subsegment includes the global max or min, the first part (outside's max - min) might still be (global_max - global_min) if the subsegment doesn't include both. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the subsegment includes the global max but not the global min. Then the outside's max is still the global max, but the outside's min is the global min. So the first part remains (global_max - global_min). So in that case, the first part is still the same. So the maximum beauty would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)) over all possible subsegments. \n\nWait, but the subsegment can be any proper subsegment. So the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)) over all possible subsegments (proper) would be the maximum possible for the second term. So the total beauty would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub_diff), where max_sub_diff is the maximum of (max(sub) - min(sub)) over all proper subsegments. \n\nWait, but the problem requires the subsegment to be a proper one. So the entire array is excluded. So the maximum sub_diff could be the same as the global difference, but since the entire array is not allowed, the maximum sub_diff would be the maximum of all possible subsegments except the full array. \n\nWait, but the full array's difference is (global_max - global_min). So the maximum sub_diff for proper subsegments would be the maximum between all possible subsegments except the full array. So the maximum could be equal to the global difference if there exists a proper subsegment that has the same max and min as the global. \n\nHmm, but in that case, the beauty would be (global_max - global_min) + (global_max - global_min) = 2*(global difference). But maybe that's possible. \n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Compute the global_max and global_min of the entire array. \n\n2. Compute the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)) over all proper subsegments. \n\n3. The answer is (global_max - global_min) + max_sub_diff. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me test with the first sample. \n\nSample 1's note says the answer is 9. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the array is such that the global_max is 6, global_min is 1. The maximum sub_diff for a proper subsegment would be 5-1=4 (the subsegment in the example). So 6-1 +4 =9, which matches. \n\nAnother example: the second test case's note says the answer is 297. The first part is (100-2) =98, and the second part is (200-1)=199. 98+199=297. So that also fits. \n\nSo this approach seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum (max - min) of any proper subsegment, then adding it to the global difference. \n\nNow, how to compute the maximum (max - min) over all subsegments efficiently?\n\nThe maximum (max - min) over any subarray can be found by considering that the maximum difference in a subarray is the difference between the maximum and minimum in that subarray. \n\nThe standard approach for finding the maximum subarray min and max difference is tricky. \n\nWait, but the maximum possible (max - min) for any subarray is the global_max - global_min, but that's only if the entire array is considered. Since we can't take the entire array, we need to see if there exists a subarray (proper) that also has the same max and min. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max - min) for a proper subarray would be either the global difference (if there exists a proper subarray that includes both the global max and min), or the next best possible. \n\nHmm, but how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max - min) over all subarrays (including the full array) is the global difference. So the maximum for proper subarrays is either the global difference (if there exists a proper subarray that includes both the global max and min), or the next maximum. \n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max - min) over all proper subarrays is the maximum between:\n\n- the maximum (max - min) of all subarrays except the full array.\n\nSo to compute this, we can compute the maximum (max - min) over all possible subarrays, then subtract the case where the full array is considered. \n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max - min) over all subarrays (including the full array) is the global difference. So the maximum for proper subarrays is either the global difference (if there exists a proper subarray that also has the same max and min) or the next maximum. \n\nHmm, but how do we check if there exists a proper subarray that includes both the global max and min?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max - min) for proper subarrays is the global difference if the global max and min are not at the ends. Because then, you can take a subarray that includes both. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is the global difference if the global max and min are not both at the same end. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max - min) for proper subarrays is the global difference if the global max and min are not both at the same end. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 3, 5]. The global max is 5, min is 1. The full array's difference is 4. The proper subarrays are [1,3], [3,5], [1], [3], [5]. The max-min for [1,3] is 2, [3,5] is 2, so the maximum is 2. So the proper subarrays can't reach the global difference. So in this case, the maximum proper subarray's difference is 2, so the total beauty would be (5-1) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8? Wait but according to the problem's formula, the beauty would be (max outside - min outside) + (max sub - min sub). \n\nWait in this example, if the subarray is [3,5], then the outside is [1]. The outside's max and min are 1. So the first part is 0. The second part is 5-3=2. So total is 2. But according to the approach I thought earlier, the total would be (5-1) + 2 = 6+2=8, which is wrong. \n\nOh wait, this shows that my initial approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so my previous reasoning was wrong. \n\nSo I need to rethink the problem. \n\nLet me re-express the beauty formula:\n\nBeauty = (max(outside) - min(outside)) + (max(sub) - min(sub))\n\nThe outside is the elements not in the subsegment. \n\nSo the outside's max and min can vary depending on which subsegment we choose. \n\nTherefore, the approach of adding the global difference and the sub's difference is not correct. \n\nHmm, so I need to find a way to compute this for all possible subsegments efficiently. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe beauty can be rewritten as (max of entire array except the subsegment) minus (min of entire array except the subsegment) plus (max of subsegment minus min of subsegment). \n\nWait, but the outside is the array excluding the subsegment. So the outside's max and min are the max and min of the array except the subsegment. \n\nHmm, so the problem is to find the maximum over all possible subsegments (proper) of [ (max(outside) - min(outside)) + (max(sub) - min(sub)) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum occurs when the outside has a large max-min, and the sub has a large max-min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is such that the outside includes both the global max and min, so that the outside's max-min is the global difference, and the sub's max-min is as large as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is the global difference plus the maximum possible (max(sub) - min(sub)), but only when the sub doesn't include either the global max or min. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the subsegment excludes the global max (6) and the global min (1). Wait, in the first example's note, the subsegment is l=7, r=8. The array must have the global max at position before 7? Or after? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the global difference plus the maximum (max(sub) - min(sub)), but only if the subsegment doesn't include both the global max and min. \n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me think of the beauty as (max(outside) - min(outside)) + (max(sub) - min(sub)). \n\nSuppose the subsegment is S. Let the outside be O. \n\nThen, the beauty is (max(O) - min(O)) + (max(S) - min(S)). \n\nThe total of these two terms. \n\nNow, the maximum possible value of this sum would be when both terms are as large as possible. \n\nThe first term can be as large as the global difference (if O includes both the global max and min). \n\nThe second term can be as large as the global difference (if S includes both the global max and min). \n\nBut since S and O are complementary, they can't both include both. \n\nWait, if S is a proper subsegment, then O is non-empty. \n\nWait, the maximum possible sum would be when the first term is the global difference (so O includes both global max and min) and the second term is as large as possible. \n\nAlternatively, the second term can be the global difference (if S includes both global max and min), but then O would exclude them, so the first term would be (max(O) - min(O)), which could be smaller. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the best scenario is when O includes both global max and min, so the first term is the global difference, and the second term is as large as possible. \n\nIn that case, the maximum beauty would be (global difference) + (max possible (max(S) - min(S)) where S is a proper subsegment that does not include either the global max or min. \n\nWait, no. Wait, if O includes both global max and min, then S must not include either. \n\nWait, no. If S is a subsegment that excludes the global max and min, then O includes them. \n\nSo in that case, the first term is global difference, and the second term is the max (max(S) - min(S)) for S that doesn't include either global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is achieved when S is a subsegment that excludes either the global max or the global min, but not both. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider all possible subsegments and find the maximum of the beauty. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nThe key is to find for each possible subsegment the value of (max(O) - min(O)) + (max(S) - min(S)). \n\nTo compute this for all subsegments, we need to find for each possible subsegment S, the max and min of O (the outside), and the max and min of S. \n\nBut doing this naively is O(n^2), which is too slow. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute some arrays. \n\nLet me think of precomputing for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right. \n\nAlternatively, precompute for each index i, the maximum and minimum in the prefix up to i, and suffix from i. \n\nAlternatively, precompute for each possible l and r the max and min of the subsegment [l..r], and the max and min of the array excluding [l..r]. \n\nBut even that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way. \n\nLet me think of the maximum possible beauty. \n\nThe maximum possible value of (max(O) - min(O)) + (max(S) - min(S)) can be up to (global_max - global_min) + (global_max - global_min) = 2*(global difference). \n\nThis would require that O includes both global max and min, and S also includes both. But since S and O are complementary, this is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible is (global difference) + (some value). \n\nWait, let's think of cases where the first term is the global difference. \n\nTo have max(O) - min(O) = global difference, the O must include both the global max and min. \n\nSo the subsegment S must not include either the global max or the global min. \n\nWait, no. If S includes one of them, then O would exclude that one. \n\nWait, for O to include both global max and min, the subsegment S must not include either. \n\nSo S must be a subsegment that excludes both the global max and min. \n\nIn that case, the first term is global difference. \n\nThe second term is (max(S) - min(S)). \n\nSo the total is (global difference) + (max(S) - min(S)). \n\nThe maximum of this over all such S would be (global difference) plus the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) among all subsegments that exclude both global max and min. \n\nAlternatively, if there are no such subsegments (i.e., the global max and min are adjacent?), then this case is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n1. (global difference) + (max possible (max(S) - min(S)) for S that excludes both global max and min)\n\n2. (max(O1) - min(O1)) + (max(S1) - min(S1)), where S1 includes the global max but not the min, so O1 excludes the global max but includes the min. \n\nIn that case, the first term would be (max(O1) - min(O1)), which is (global min's max? Not sure. \n\nThis seems too vague. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the maximum possible beauty as the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub_diff), where max_sub_diff is the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for any subsegment S that does not include both global_max and global_min. \n\nWait, but how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\na) (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub_diff_without_global_max_and_min)\n\nb) (max_without_global_max - min_without_global_max) + (max_sub_with_global_max - min_sub_with_global_max)\n\nc) (max_without_global_min - min_without_global_min) + (max_sub_with_global_min - min_sub_with_global_min)\n\nd) and other cases. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nThe beauty can be written as (max of the entire array except S) minus (min of the entire array except S) plus (max of S minus min of S). \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet M be the global maximum, m the global minimum. \n\nSuppose the subsegment S does not contain M or m. Then the outside includes both, so the first term is M - m. The second term is (max(S) - min(S)). So the total is (M - m) + (max(S) - min(S)). \n\nThe maximum in this case would be (M - m) plus the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) over all S that exclude both M and m. \n\nAlternatively, if S contains M but not m, then the outside includes m but not M. So the first term is (max(outside) - m). The max(outside) could be the second highest maximum. \n\nSimilarly, if S contains m but not M, then the first term is (M - min(outside)), where min(outside) could be the second lowest. \n\nIf S contains both M and m, then the outside excludes both, so the first term is (max(outside) - min(outside)), which could be less than M - m. \n\nSo the maximum beauty would be the maximum among all these possibilities. \n\nTherefore, to compute the maximum, we need to consider several cases:\n\n1. S excludes both M and m: then the first term is M - m, and the second term is the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for such S. \n\n2. S includes M but not m: then the first term is (max(outside) - m). The max(outside) is the maximum of the array excluding S, which includes m. \n\nBut this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the first case (excluding both) gives the highest possible value. \n\nSo the maximum beauty would be (M - m) plus the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for all S that exclude both M and m. \n\nIf there exists such a subsegment S, then this is a candidate. \n\nOtherwise, we have to look into other cases. \n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Find the global max and min. \n\n- Find the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) among all subsegments S that do not include the global max or the global min. \n\n- The candidate is (M - m) + this maximum. \n\n- Also, check other cases where S includes one of them but not the other, and see if they can give a higher value. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nFirst, let's find the positions of the global max and min. \n\nSuppose the array has multiple global max or min, but for simplicity, let's assume there is one each. \n\nLet's say the global max is at position p, and the global min at position q. \n\nWe need to find subsegments S that do not include p or q. \n\nWait, no, the subsegment S must exclude both p and q. \n\nWait, the subsegment S is a proper subsegment, so it can't be the entire array. \n\nWait, but to exclude both p and q, the subsegment must be entirely to the left of both, between them, or to the right of both. \n\nWait, but if p and q are not adjacent, then there are regions where S can be placed. \n\nAlternatively, the regions where S can be placed are:\n\n- left of both p and q (if p and q are to the right of some point)\n\n- between p and q (if they are not adjacent)\n\n- right of both. \n\nHmm, but this depends on the positions of p and q. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for S not containing p or q can be found by considering the regions outside the interval [min(p,q), max(p,q)]. \n\nWait, the interval between the two points. \n\nWait, the regions where S can be placed are the parts before the leftmost of p and q, between them, and after the rightmost. \n\nWait, for example, if p is at position 5 and q is at position 10, then the regions are:\n\n- before 5,\n\n- between 5 and 10,\n\n- after 10. \n\nWait, but between 5 and 10 would include the interval between them, but the subsegment S can't include either p or q. \n\nWait, the subsegment S must not include p or q. So between p and q, the subsegment can be placed in the area between them but not including either. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for S not containing p or q can be found by considering the maximum in the left part (before the leftmost of p and q), the middle part (between p and q), and the right part (after the rightmost of p and q). \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) over all possible subsegments can be found in O(n) time using a sliding window approach, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) over all subsegments can be found in O(n) time using a method that tracks the current max and min. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum difference between max and min in any subarray can be found by considering that the maximum difference is between the global max and global min, but only if they are in the same subarray. \n\nWait, but the maximum possible (max(S) - min(S)) for any subarray is exactly the global difference if there exists a subarray that contains both the global max and min. \n\nOtherwise, it's the maximum between the global max minus the min of the array excluding the global max, or the global min's max minus the global min, etc. \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe beauty can be written as (max of the outside) - (min of the outside) + (max of the sub) - (min of the sub). \n\nThis can be rewritten as (max(outside) + max(sub)) - (min(outside) + min(sub)). \n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, note that the outside and the sub are complementary. \n\nSo the max(outside) is the maximum of the entire array except the sub. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (max of the entire array except the sub) minus (min of the entire array except the sub) plus (max of the sub minus min of the sub). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right. \n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nFor each possible subsegment [l, r], the outside is the array excluding [l..r]. \n\nThe outside can be split into two parts: the prefix before l and the suffix after r. \n\nThe max of the outside is the maximum between the max of the prefix and the max of the suffix. \n\nSimilarly, the min of the outside is the minimum between the min of the prefix and the min of the suffix. \n\nSo, if we precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays, then for any l and r, the max_outside is max(prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1]), and similarly for min_outside. \n\nThe max_sub and min_sub can be found using a sliding window approach, but that might not be feasible for large n. \n\nAlternatively, for each possible l and r, we can compute the max and min of the subsegment [l..r] using a segment tree or sparse table for range max and min queries. \n\nThen, the beauty can be computed as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum of this over all proper subsegments. \n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min arrays. \n\nprefix_max[i] is the maximum of the first i elements (a[0..i-1], assuming 0-based). \n\nSimilarly, prefix_min[i] is the minimum of the first i elements. \n\nSimilarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1], and suffix_min[i] is the minimum of a[i..n-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nprefix_max is an array where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i]. \n\nWait, let me think of the arrays properly. \n\nLet me define:\n\nprefix_max is an array of length n, where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i]. \n\nSimilarly, prefix_min[i] is the minimum of a[0..i]. \n\nSimilarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1], and suffix_min[i] is the minimum of a[i..n-1]. \n\nThen, for a subsegment [l, r] (0-based, l <= r), the outside is the elements before l and after r. \n\nThe max of the outside is the maximum between prefix_max[l-1] (if l>0) and suffix_max[r+1] (if r < n-1). \n\nSimilarly, the min of the outside is the minimum between prefix_min[l-1] and suffix_min[r+1]. \n\nThe max_sub is the maximum of a[l..r], which can be found using a range max query. \n\nSimilarly, the min_sub is the range min. \n\nSo, to compute the beauty for a subsegment [l, r], we can do:\n\nmax_outside = max( (prefix_max[l-1] if l>0 else -infinity), (suffix_max[r+1] if r < n-1 else -infinity) )\n\nWait, but if l is 0, then the prefix part is nothing, so the outside's max is suffix_max[r+1]. \n\nSimilarly, if r is n-1, then the suffix part is nothing, so the outside's max is prefix_max[l-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps the max_outside is the maximum between the prefix_max up to l-1 and the suffix_max starting from r+1. \n\nBut if l is 0, then the prefix part is nothing, so the prefix_max is considered as -infinity, so the max is suffix_max[r+1]. \n\nSimilarly, if r is n-1, then the suffix part is nothing, so the max is prefix_max[l-1]. \n\nSame for the min_outside. \n\nSo, to compute max_outside and min_outside, we can do:\n\nmax_outside = max( (prefix_max[l-1] if l>0 else -inf), (suffix_max[r+1] if r < n-1 else -inf) )\n\nSimilarly for min_outside. \n\nBut how to handle the cases where one of the parts is empty. \n\nAlternatively, the max_outside is the maximum of the entire array except the subsegment. \n\nThe maximum of the entire array except the subsegment can be found as the maximum between the prefix up to l-1 and the suffix from r+1. \n\nSimilarly for the minimum. \n\nSo, with the prefix and suffix arrays, this can be done in O(1) per query. \n\nThe max_sub and min_sub can be found using a range max and min query. \n\nTo compute range max and min queries efficiently, we can precompute a sparse table for range max and min. \n\nThe sparse table allows O(1) per query after O(n log n) preprocessing. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nPrecompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nPrecompute sparse tables for range max and min. \n\nThen, iterate over all possible subsegments [l, r], compute the beauty, and track the maximum. \n\nBut even with O(1) per query, iterating over all O(n^2) subsegments is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e5. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: Find the maximum possible beauty by considering certain candidates. \n\nThe maximum beauty is likely to be achieved by a subsegment that is either the first part, the last part, or a segment that excludes the global max and min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the global difference plus the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for any subsegment S that doesn't include both global max and min. \n\nBut how to compute this maximum efficiently. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find the global max and min, their positions. \n\n2. Find the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for all subsegments that do not include the global max or the global min. \n\n3. The candidate is (global difference) + this maximum. \n\n4. Also, consider other cases where the subsegment includes one of them but not the other. \n\nBut how to compute step 2 efficiently. \n\nTo compute the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) for subsegments not containing the global max or min, we can split the array into regions that exclude both. \n\nSuppose the global max is at position p and the global min at q. \n\nThe regions are:\n\n- left of the leftmost of p and q,\n\n- between p and q (if they are not adjacent),\n\n- right of the rightmost of p and q. \n\nFor each of these regions, we can compute the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) in that region. \n\nThe maximum among all these regions would be the required value. \n\nSo, for example, if the global max is at position 5 and the global min at position 10, then the regions are:\n\n- from 0 to 4 (left of both),\n\n- from 6 to 9 (between them),\n\n- from 11 to n-1 (right of both). \n\nFor each of these regions, we can compute the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) over all subsegments within that region. \n\nThe maximum among all these regions would be the maximum possible for subsegments not containing either global max or min. \n\nThen, the candidate is (global difference) plus this maximum. \n\nAdditionally, we need to consider other cases where the subsegment includes one of them but not the other. \n\nFor example, a subsegment that includes the global max but not the global min. \n\nIn this case, the outside includes the global min but not the global max. \n\nThe first term (max_outside - min_outside) would be (max(outside) - global_min). \n\nThe max(outside) is the maximum of the array excluding the subsegment. Since the subsegment includes the global max, the outside's max is the second highest max. \n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved in the first case (excluding both), so we can focus on that. \n\nAssuming that, then the steps are:\n\n- Find the global max and min positions. \n\n- Split the array into regions that exclude both. \n\n- For each region, compute the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) over all subsegments in that region. \n\n- Take the maximum among these. \n\n- The candidate is (global difference) + this maximum. \n\n- Also, check other cases (like including one but not the other) to see if they can give a higher value. \n\nBut how to compute the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) in a region efficiently. \n\nThe maximum (max(S) - min(S)) in a region can be found by finding the maximum and minimum in the entire region, since the maximum difference is achieved by the entire region. \n\nWait, no. For example, in a region like [3,1,4], the entire region's max is 4, min is 1, difference 3. But a subsegment [3,1] has difference 2, which is less. \n\nWait, the maximum difference in any subsegment of a region is the difference between the global max and min of that region. \n\nBecause the maximum possible difference is achieved by taking the subsegment that includes both the max and min of the region. \n\nSo for a region, the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) over all subsegments in the region is equal to the (max_region - min_region), where max_region is the maximum in the region and min_region is the minimum. \n\nAh! That's a key insight. \n\nSo for any region, the maximum difference is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum of the region. \n\nTherefore, for each region (like the left, middle, right regions), the maximum (max(S) - min(S)) is the max of the region minus the min of the region. \n\nTherefore, to compute the maximum for the regions excluding both global max and min, we can compute the max and min of each region and take their differences. \n\nThe maximum among these differences is the value needed. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the global max and min positions. \n\n2. Split the array into regions that exclude both. \n\n3. For each region, compute its max and min. \n\n4. The maximum difference among these regions is the value to add to the global difference. \n\n5. The candidate is (global difference) + this maximum. \n\n6. Also, check other cases where the subsegment includes one of the global max or min but not both. \n\nBut how to handle those cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\na) (global difference) + (max of region differences)\n\nb) (max of regions excluding global max) + (max of subsegments including global max but not min)\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. \n\nBut let's proceed with the first case. \n\nSo, the first candidate is (global difference) + (max_region_diff), where max_region_diff is the maximum of (max_region - min_region) for the regions excluding both global max and min. \n\nNow, how to compute the regions. \n\nSuppose the global max is at position p and global min at q. \n\nThe regions are:\n\n- left region: from 0 to min(p, q) - 1 \n\n- middle region: from max(p, q) + 1 to min(p, q) - 1? No, wait. \n\nWait, the regions are:\n\nThe left region is everything before the leftmost of p and q. \n\nThe middle region is between the leftmost and rightmost of p and q, excluding the positions p and q themselves. \n\nThe right region is everything after the rightmost of p and q. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLet left = min(p, q), right = max(p, q). \n\nThen the regions are:\n\n1. Left region: 0 to left-1 \n\n2. Middle region: left+1 to right-1 \n\n3. Right region: right+1 to n-1 \n\nThese are the regions that exclude both p and q. \n\nFor each of these regions, if they are non-empty, compute their max and min. \n\nThe maximum of (max - min) among these regions is the value to add. \n\nIf any of the regions are empty, they are ignored. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute left and right (the min and max of p and q). \n\nCompute the three regions. \n\nFor each region, if it has length >=1, compute its max and min. \n\nThe maximum among all (max - min) of these regions is the value to add. \n\nThen the candidate is (global difference) + this value. \n\nNow, what about other cases where the subsegment includes one of the global max or min but not both. \n\nFor example, a subsegment that includes the global max but not the global min. \n\nIn this case, the outside includes the global min but not the global max. \n\nThe first term (max_outside - min_outside) would be (max_outside - global_min). \n\nThe max_outside is the maximum of the outside, which is the maximum of the array excluding the subsegment. \n\nSince the subsegment includes the global max, the outside's max is the second highest max. \n\nThe second term (max_sub - min_sub) would include the global max, so its max is global_max. \n\nThe min_sub could be anything. \n\nThe total would be (max_outside - global_min) + (global_max - min_sub). \n\nTo maximize this, we need to maximize (max_outside - global_min) and (global_max - min_sub). \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the first candidate is sufficient, and the other cases can't give a higher value. \n\nLet me test with the first sample. \n\nSample 1's note says the optimal subsegment excludes both the global max and min. \n\nSo the first candidate would give the correct answer. \n\nThe second sample's note also has the subsegment excluding both the global max and min? \n\nIn the second example's note, the optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4. \n\nThe array is probably something like [2, 1, 100, 200, 1]. \n\nGlobal max is 200, global min is 1 or 2. \n\nAssuming the global max is 200 (position 3, 0-based?), and the global min is 1 (position 4). \n\nThe subsegment is positions 1-3 (assuming 0-based). \n\nThe outside includes the first element (2) and the last (1). \n\nSo the outside includes the global min (1) but not the global max (200 is in the subsegment). \n\nWait, so this subsegment includes the global max but not the global min. \n\nSo the first term would be (max(outside) - min(outside)). \n\nThe outside includes 2 and 1. So max is 2, min is 1. So first term is 1. \n\nThe sub's max is 200, min is 1 (from the subsegment's elements?). \n\nWait the subsegment is 2-4 (assuming 1-based?), so in 0-based it's 1-3. The elements are 1, 100, 200. \n\nThe min of the sub is 1, max is 200. \n\nSo the second term is 199. \n\nTotal is 1+199=200, but the note says 297. \n\nWait, the note says the beauty is (100-2) + (200-1) = 98+199=297. \n\nAh, so the outside's max is 100? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. \n\nThe example's note says the second test case's optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based). \n\nThe array is probably like [2, 1, 100, 200, 1]. \n\nThe subsegment is positions 2-4 (1-based: elements 1, 100, 200). \n\nThe outside is the first element (2) and the last (1). \n\nThe outside's max is 2, min is 1. So first term is 2-1=1. \n\nThe sub's max is 200, min is 1. So second term is 199. Total is 200. But the note says 297. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nWait the note says the first part is (100-2) = 98. \n\nAh, so the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the array is different. \n\nMaybe the array is [2, 100, 200, 1, ...]. \n\nWait, perhaps the example's array is [2, 100, 200, 1, ...]. \n\nWait, the note says the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. \n\nSo the outside must include 2 and 100. \n\nThe subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based), which would be elements 100, 200, 1. \n\nThe outside is the first element (2) and the elements after r=4 (if n is 5, then the last element is 1, but the subsegment includes it. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array is [2, 100, 200, 1, 3]. \n\nThen the subsegment l=2 to r=4 (1-based) is elements 100, 200, 1. \n\nThe outside is 2 and 3. \n\nThe outside's max is 3, min is 2. So first term is 1. \n\nThe second term is 200-1=199. Total 200. \n\nBut the note says 297. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nThe note says the first part is (100-2) + (200-1) = 98+199=297. \n\nSo the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. \n\nThe sub's max is 200 and min is 1. \n\nSo the outside must include 100 and 2. \n\nThe subsegment must exclude the 100? \n\nWait, perhaps the subsegment is from 2 to 4 (1-based) in an array like [2, 100, 200, 1]. \n\nThen the outside is the first element (2) and the fourth element (1). \n\nThe outside's max is 2, min is 1. \n\nNo, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the array is [2, 100, 200, 1]. \n\nThe subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based: elements 100, 200, 1). \n\nThe outside is the first element (2). \n\nThe outside's max and min are both 2. \n\nSo first term is 0. \n\nThe second term is 200-1=199. \n\nTotal 199. \n\nNot matching the note. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's array is different. \n\nThe note says the second test case's optimal subsegment gives (100-2) + (200-1) = 297. \n\nSo the outside's max is 100, min is 2. \n\nThe sub's max is 200, min is 1. \n\nSo the outside must include 100 and 2. \n\nThe sub must exclude the 100 and include the 200 and 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the array is [2, 100, 200, 1, 5]. \n\nThe subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (elements 100, 200, 1). \n\nThe outside includes 2 and 5. \n\nThe outside's max is 5, min is 2. \n\nNo, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the array is [2, 100, 200, 1]. \n\nThe subsegment is l=2 to r=3 (elements 100, 200). \n\nThe outside includes 2 and 1. \n\nThe outside's max is 2, min is 1. \n\nFirst term is 1. \n\nThe sub's max is 200, min is 100. \n\nSecond term is 100. \n\nTotal 101. \n\nNot matching. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's example. \n\nThe note says the second test case's optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4. \n\nThe outside's max is 100 and min is 2. \n\nSo the outside must include 100 and 2. \n\nThe subsegment must exclude the 100 and include the 200 and 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the array is [2, 100, 200, 1, 100]. \n\nThe subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (elements 100, 200, 1). \n\nThe outside includes the first element (2) and the fifth (100). \n\nThe outside's max is 100, min is 2. \n\nSo first term is 98. \n\nThe sub's max is 200, min is 1. \n\nSecond term is 199. \n\nTotal 297. \n\nAh, that fits. \n\nSo in this case, the subsegment includes the global max (200) but not the global min (1 is in the subsegment, but the global min is 1, so it is included. \n\nWait, the global min is 1. \n\nSo the subsegment includes the global min. \n\nSo the outside does not include the global min. \n\nWait, the outside is the first element (2) and the fifth (100). \n\nThe global min is 1, which is in the subsegment. \n\nSo the outside does not include the global min. \n\nSo the first term's min is the min of the outside, which is 2. \n\nThe first term's max is 100. \n\nSo the first term is 100-2=98. \n\nThe second term is 200-1=199. \n\nTotal 297. \n\nSo in this case, the subsegment includes the global max (200) and the global min (1). \n\nSo the outside does not include the global min. \n\nThus, the first term's min is the min of the outside (2), and the max is 100. \n\nSo the first term is 98. \n\nThe second term is 199. \n\nSo the total is 297. \n\nThis case is when the subsegment includes the global max and min. \n\nSo the first approach (excluding both) is not the case here. \n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect. \n\nThis means that the maximum beauty can also be achieved when the subsegment includes one or both of the global max and min. \n\nSo the previous approach is insufficient. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternative Idea: The maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can find for each possible subsegment the maximum and minimum of the sub and the outside. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently. \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that excludes both global_max and global_min. \n\n- (max_outside_without_global_max - min_outside_without_global_max) + (max_sub_with_global_max - min_sub_with_global_max) for subsegments that include global_max but not global_min. \n\n- Similarly for subsegments that include global_min but not global_max. \n\n- And subsegments that include both. \n\nBut this requires considering multiple cases. \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum of the following four terms:\n\n1. (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that exclude both. \n\n2. (max_without_global_max - min_without_global_max) + (max_sub_with_global_max - min_sub_with_global_max) for subsegments that include global_max but not global_min. \n\n3. (max_without_global_min - min_without_global_min) + (max_sub_with_global_min - min_sub_with_global_min) for subsegments that include global_min but not global_max. \n\n4. (max_without_both - min_without_both) + (max_sub_with_both - min_sub_with_both) for subsegments that include both. \n\nBut how to compute these terms efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum of the following:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that excludes both. \n\n- (max_without_global_max - min_without_global_max) + (max_sub_with_global_max - min_sub_with_global_max) for any subsegment that includes global_max but not global_min. \n\n- (max_without_global_min - min_without_global_min) + (max_sub_with_global_min - min_sub_with_global_min) for any subsegment that includes global_min but not global_max. \n\n- (max_without_both - min_without_both) + (max_sub_with_both - min_sub_with_both) for any subsegment that includes both. \n\nBut this requires finding the maximum for each case. \n\nThis seems too involved. \n\nPerhaps the only way to proceed is to find the maximum of the following four values:\n\n1. The maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments that exclude both global_max and global_min. \n\n2. The maximum of (max_outside_without_global_max - min_outside_without_global_max) + (max_sub_with_global_max - min_sub_with_global_max) for all subsegments that include global_max but not global_min. \n\n3. The maximum of (max_outside_without_global_min - min_outside_without_global_min) + (max_sub_with_global_min - min_sub_with_global_min) for all subsegments that include global_min but not global_max. \n\n4. The maximum of (max_outside_without_both - min_outside_without_both) + (max_sub_with_both - min_sub_with_both) for all subsegments that include both. \n\nBut how to compute these efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is simply the maximum between the global difference plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment, and the maximum possible (max_outside - min_outside) plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nPerhaps the only way to proceed is to find the maximum of all possible (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub) for all possible subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can precompute the prefix and suffix arrays for max and min, and also precompute the range max and min using a sparse table. \n\nThen, for each possible subsegment [l, r], compute the beauty in O(1) time. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow. \n\nHmm, but perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved by certain subsegments, such as the first few or last few elements, or the entire array except one element. \n\nPerhaps the maximum is achieved by a subsegment that is the entire array except the first element, or the last element, or the first and last elements. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum is achieved by a subsegment that is the entire array except the global max or min. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering the following candidates:\n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the first element. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the last element. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the first and last elements. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the global max. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the global min. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the global max and min. \n\n- The subsegment is the first half of the array. \n\n- The subsegment is the second half of the array. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the first element and the global max. \n\nWait, this is not systematic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved by a subsegment that is the entire array except one element. \n\nBecause such subsegments are O(n) in number, and for each, we can compute the beauty in O(1) time with precomputed arrays. \n\nLet me see:\n\nFor a subsegment that is the entire array except the first element (i.e., l=2 to r=n), the outside is the first element. \n\nThe max_outside is a[0], min_outside is a[0]. \n\nThe sub's max and min are the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nThe beauty is (a[0] - a[0]) + (max_sub - min_sub) = max_sub - min_sub. \n\nSimilarly for the subsegment excluding the last element. \n\nThe maximum among all such subsegments (excluding one element) would be the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1. \n\nThe maximum of these could be a candidate. \n\nSimilarly, the subsegment excluding the global max would have the outside include the global max. \n\nThe first term would be global difference (since the outside includes both global max and min). \n\nThe second term is the max_sub - min_sub of the subsegment excluding the global max. \n\nThis could be a candidate. \n\nSo perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum among:\n\n- the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1 (excluding one element). \n\n- the maximum (global difference + (max_sub - min_sub)) for subsegments that exclude the global max or global min. \n\n- the maximum (max_outside - min_outside + max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that include one of the global max or min. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\na) the global difference plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that exclude both global max and min. \n\nb) the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments of length n-1. \n\nc) the maximum (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that include one of the global max or min. \n\nBut this is still not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- the global difference plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that excludes both global max and min. \n\n- the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment of length n-1. \n\nBecause excluding one element gives a proper subsegment, and the maximum of those could be a candidate. \n\nLet me see:\n\nFor the first sample's case, the optimal subsegment is of length 2 (assuming n=8?), so excluding one element would give a subsegment of length 7, which might not be the optimal. \n\nBut the first sample's optimal subsegment is of length 2, so the maximum among subsegments of length n-1 may not be the best. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nAnother Idea: The beauty can be rewritten as (max of the entire array except the subsegment) - (min of the entire array except the subsegment) + (max of the subsegment) - (min of the subsegment). \n\nThis can be rewritten as (max of the entire array except the subsegment + max of the subsegment) - (min of the entire array except the subsegment + min of the subsegment). \n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (max of the entire array except the subsegment) - (min of the entire array except the subsegment) plus (max of the subsegment) - (min of the subsegment). \n\nThe maximum of this expression can be found by considering that the first part is the difference between the max and min of the outside, and the second part is the difference between the max and min of the sub. \n\nThe maximum possible value would be when both terms are as large as possible. \n\nThe first term is maximized when the outside includes both the global max and min, giving the global difference. \n\nThe second term is maximized when the sub includes both the global max and min, giving the global difference. \n\nBut since the sub and outside are complementary, they can't both include both. \n\nThus, the maximum possible is when one of them includes both, and the other includes as much as possible. \n\nThe best case is when the outside includes both, and the sub's difference is as large as possible. \n\nThis gives the first candidate. \n\nAlternatively, when the sub includes both, the outside's difference is the difference between the second max and second min. \n\nBut this might be smaller than the global difference. \n\nThus, the first candidate is the best possible. \n\nBut the second example's case shows that this isn't always the case. \n\nIn the second example's case, the subsegment includes the global max and min, so the outside does not include the global min. \n\nThe first term is (100-2) = 98, which is less than the global difference (200-1=199). \n\nThe second term is 199. \n\nTotal is 297. \n\nThe first candidate would be (199) + (max of regions excluding both). \n\nThe regions excluding both would be the regions outside the global max and min. \n\nThe global max is at position 2 (assuming 0-based), global min at position 3. \n\nThe regions are:\n\nleft region: 0 to 1 (elements 2 and 100). \n\nmiddle region: none (since the global max and min are adjacent). \n\nright region: 4 to end (if n is 5, then nothing). \n\nThe left region's max is 100, min is 2. \n\nSo the maximum region difference is 98. \n\nThe first candidate would be 199 + 98 = 297, which matches the example. \n\nAh! So in this case, the first candidate gives the correct result. \n\nBecause the regions excluding both global max and min include the left region (elements 2 and 100), which has a difference of 98. \n\nThe first candidate is (global difference) + 98 = 199 +98 = 297. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nSo the first approach is correct. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Find the global max and min of the array. \n\n2. Find the positions of the global max and min. \n\n3. Split the array into regions that exclude both the global max and min. \n\n4. For each region, compute its max and min. \n\n5. The maximum difference among these regions is the value to add to the global difference. \n\n6. The candidate is (global difference) + this maximum. \n\n7. Also, we need to ensure that there exists at least one proper subsegment that excludes both global max and min. \n\nIf there are no such regions (e.g., the global max and min are adjacent and at the ends), then the maximum would be the maximum of other cases. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the subsegment must be proper, so the entire array is not allowed. \n\nThus, the algorithm should work. \n\nNow, to implement this in code. \n\nFirst, find the global max and min. \n\nThen find their positions. \n\nThen split into regions. \n\nCompute the max and min for each region. \n\nThe maximum of their differences is the value to add. \n\nThe final answer is global_diff + max_region_diff. \n\nBut what if there are no regions excluding both? \n\nFor example, if the global max and min are adjacent and at the ends. \n\nLike array [1, 5]. \n\nGlobal max is 5 at position 1, global min is 1 at position 0. \n\nThe regions excluding both would be nothing. \n\nSo the maximum region difference is 0. \n\nThe candidate would be (5-1) +0 =4. \n\nBut the proper subsegments are [1], [5], or [1,5] is not allowed. \n\nThe subsegments are of length 1. \n\nFor subsegment [1], the outside is [5]. \n\nThe first term is 5-5=0. \n\nThe second term is 1-1=0. Total 0. \n\nFor subsegment [5], the outside is [1]. \n\nFirst term is 1-1=0. \n\nSecond term is 5-5=0. \n\nSo the maximum is 0. \n\nBut the candidate would give 4, which is incorrect. \n\nSo in this case, the algorithm would fail. \n\nHmm, so we need to handle cases where there are no regions excluding both. \n\nIn such cases, the maximum region difference is zero, but the candidate would be global_diff +0. \n\nBut the actual maximum beauty might be lower. \n\nThus, we need to also consider other cases. \n\nThis suggests that the algorithm is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nPerhaps the algorithm should also consider the maximum of the other cases. \n\nBut how to compute that efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between the candidate and the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all possible subsegments. \n\nBecause in the example above, the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) is 0 (for subsegments of length 1), so the candidate (4) is higher than the actual maximum (0). \n\nBut the candidate is incorrect. \n\nThus, the algorithm is not correct. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nPerhaps the algorithm should also consider the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments. \n\nThe maximum beauty would be the maximum between the candidate and (global difference + max_sub_diff_without_both) and the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments. \n\nWait, but the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments is the global difference if there exists a subsegment that includes both global max and min. \n\nOtherwise, it's the maximum between the global max minus the min of the array excluding the global max, or the global min's max minus the global min, etc. \n\nBut this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the candidate as described, but also compute the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments, and take the maximum between the two. \n\nThe maximum beauty would be the maximum between:\n\n- candidate (global_diff + max_region_diff)\n\n- the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments. \n\nBecause in the example where the regions excluding both are empty, the candidate would be global_diff +0 = global_diff. \n\nThe maximum (max_sub - min_sub) would be the maximum between the subsegments that include one of the global max or min. \n\nIn the example [1,5], the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) is 0 (for subsegments of length 1). \n\nThus, the maximum between 4 and 0 is 4, but the correct answer is 0. \n\nSo this approach also fails. \n\nHmm, this is really tricky. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the candidate as described, but also compute the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments, and also compute the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) for all subsegments. \n\nThen the maximum beauty is the maximum of all possible combinations. \n\nBut this is not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the candidate is correct except when there are no regions excluding both. \n\nIn such cases, the maximum beauty is the maximum between the candidate and the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments. \n\nBut how to handle this. \n\nAlternatively, the candidate is correct, but in cases where there are no regions excluding both, the candidate would be global_diff +0, but the actual maximum is the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that include one of the global max or min. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and see if it passes the test cases. \n\nThe first example's case works. \n\nThe second example's case works. \n\nThe case where the regions are empty would require a different approach. \n\nBut perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that there is always a proper subsegment that excludes both global max and min. \n\nThe problem states that the subsegment must be proper, so the entire array is not allowed. \n\nBut if the array has length 4, and the global max and min are at positions 0 and 3, then the regions excluding both are the middle positions 1 and 2. \n\nThus, there is a region. \n\nThe only case where there are no regions is when the global max and min are adjacent and at the ends. \n\nLike array of length 2: [1,5]. \n\nIn this case, the proper subsegments are of length 1. \n\nThe maximum beauty is 0. \n\nThe candidate would be (5-1) +0 =4, which is incorrect. \n\nThus, the algorithm would fail for this case. \n\nBut the problem's input constraints state that n is at least 4. \n\nAh! The problem's input specifies that n is at least 4. \n\nSo the case of n=2 is not possible. \n\nThus, for n>=4, there must be at least one region excluding both global max and min. \n\nBecause the global max and min can't be adjacent and at both ends. \n\nFor example, if the global max is at position 0 and the global min at position 3 (n=4), then the middle region is positions 1-2. \n\nThus, there is a region. \n\nThus, the algorithm should work for all cases with n>=4. \n\nThus, the algorithm is correct. \n\nNow, to implement this in code. \n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nRead the array. \n\nCompute the global max and min. \n\nFind their positions. \n\nSplit into regions. \n\nCompute the max and min for each region. \n\nFind the maximum difference among these regions. \n\nThe answer is global_diff + max_region_diff. \n\nNow, the code for program1.py. \n\nThe given code for program1.py is:\n\nfor sdr in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe input is read as follows: the first line is t test cases. \n\nThen for each test case, the first line is n, then the second line is the array. \n\nThe current code is iterating over the lines starting from the second line, taking every second line (the array lines). \n\nBut this is incorrect. \n\nThe correct way to read the input is to read all lines, then for each test case, read the n and the array. \n\nThe current code is probably incorrect. \n\nThe user's code for program1.py is incomplete. \n\nThe user's code for program1.py is:\n\nfor sdr in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is probably incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to read all the input lines, then process each test case. \n\nThe code should be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # compute the answer for this test case and print it\n\nThus, the missing code in program1.py is the code to read the input properly and compute the answer. \n\nNow, the code steps for the algorithm:\n\nFirst, compute global_max and global_min, and their positions. \n\nThen find the regions. \n\nCompute the max and min for each region. \n\nCompute the maximum region difference. \n\nThe answer is global_diff + max_region_diff. \n\nNow, implementing this in code. \n\nFirst, find the global max and min and their positions. \n\nWe can do this by iterating through the array. \n\nThen, find the left and right positions (min and max of the positions of global max and min). \n\nThen, the regions are:\n\nleft region: from 0 to left-1 \n\nmiddle region: from left+1 to right-1 \n\nright region: from right+1 to n-1 \n\nFor each region, if it is non-empty, compute its max and min. \n\nThe maximum region difference is the maximum of (max - min) for each region. \n\nNow, code steps:\n\ndef compute_max_min(arr):\n\n    max_val = -inf \n\n    min_val = inf \n\n    max_pos = 0 \n\n    min_pos =0 \n\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n\n        if arr[i] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = arr[i]\n\n            max_pos = i \n\n        if arr[i] < min_val:\n\n            min_val = arr[i]\n\n            min_pos = i \n\n    return max_val, max_pos, min_val, min_pos \n\nThen, compute left and right:\n\nleft = min(max_pos, min_pos)\n\nright = max(max_pos, min_pos)\n\nThen, the regions are:\n\nleft_region = arr[0 : left]\n\nmiddle_region = arr[left+1 : right]\n\nright_region = arr[right+1 : ]\n\nFor each region, compute max and min. \n\nThe maximum difference is the maximum of (max - min) for each region. \n\nNow, the code for this. \n\nPutting it all together. \n\nNow, the code for program1.py:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    t = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n\n        n = int(input[ptr])\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n\n        ptr +=n\n\n        if n ==0:\n\n            print(0)\n\n            continue\n\n        #
