Wait, let's think of the binary search for the minimal k where check(k) is true. The initial L is 0, R is max(count). We want to find the smallest k where check(k) is true. The binary search proceeds as follows:\n\n- Compute mid = (L+R)//2 \n\n- If check(mid) is true \u2192 the answer could be mid or lower. So set R = mid. \n\n- Else \u2192 the answer must be higher than mid. So set L = mid +1. The loop continues until L < R. \n\nThe final answer is R (or L, depending on the loop condition). In the code's current setup, the loop is while R-L>1. So when the loop exits, R-L is 1. Then, we need to check between L and R. Thus, the correct code for the else clause is L = mid +1. Wait, but the code's current code has R initialized to max(count). Wait, perhaps the code's binary search is set up to find the minimal R where check(R) is true. The code's current code in the else clause should set L = mid . \n\nWait , perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose the correct answer is 5. Initial L=0, R=10. mid =5. If check(5) is true \u2192 set R=5. Now R=5, L=0 \u2192 difference 5. Next iteration: mid is 2. If check(2) is false \u2192 set L=2. Now L=2, R=5 \u2192 difference 3. \n\nmid is 3. If check(3) is false \u2192 set L=3. Now L=3, R=5 \u2192 difference 2. mid is 4. If check(4) is false \u2192 set L=4. Now L=4, R=5 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 loop ends. Now, we need to check between 4 and 5. \n\nCheck(4) is false \u2192 so the minimal is 5. Thus, the code's approach of setting L=mid in the else clause works. Wait, in the case where check(mid) is false, the code sets L=mid. Thus, the code's approach is correct. Therefore, the missing code is L = mid. Thus, the program2's completion is L = mid. So the final answers are:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the TODO block:\n\nprint('NO')\n\ncontinue \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is L = mid in the else clause. Thus, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"print('NO')\\ncontinue\",\n    \"program2\": \"L = mid\"\n}",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems step by step. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about a robot moving on a grid with blocked cells. The robot executes each command k times. We need to determine for each query if it's possible to reach the finish from the start using commands that each are executed k times. \n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a part where if the differences in x and y coordinates aren't divisible by k, it's supposed to set 'yes' to false. But the code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\" there. Wait, actually, the initial condition is yes = (xs - xf) %k ==0 and (ys - yf)%k ==0. So if that's not true, then yes is false. But the code currently just proceeds. So the first missing part is probably setting yes to False in that case. Wait, no, the code's initial yes is set to that condition. But then, the code proceeds to check other conditions. Wait, the code after that has a block that starts with \"if not yes:\" but then the code is incomplete. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code after the yes condition is:\n\nif not yes:\n    # TODO: Your code here\nmi, ma = min(xs, xf), max(xs, xf)\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi:min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)] + a[max(mi, ma//s *s):ma])\nfor j in range(min(xs, xf)//s +1, max(xs, xf)//s):\n    high = max(high, maxs[j])\nif high < ys:\n    print('yes')\n    continue\nprint('yes' if ((high - ys)//k +1)*k + ys <=n else 'no')\n\nHmm, so the code is structured such that if yes is false (because the coordinate differences aren't divisible by k), then it does some other checks. But the problem requires that the robot must end exactly at the finish cell. So the first condition is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nWait, the code's initial yes is set to true only if the differences are divisible by k. But even if that's true, there might be blocked cells in between. So the code proceeds to check the maximum a_i between the columns. \n\nWait, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_i between the start and finish columns. Because the robot can only move vertically in steps of k, but moving horizontally requires moving between columns. Wait, the robot's movement is in commands that are up, down, left, right, each executed k times. So moving from column y_s to y_f requires moving horizontally, but each horizontal command (left or right) moves exactly k steps. So the path must have a horizontal distance that's a multiple of k. Similarly for vertical. \n\nWait, the problem's movement is that each command is executed k times. So for example, if you send a command to move right, the robot moves right k times (so k columns to the right). So the horizontal distance between start and finish must be a multiple of k. Similarly for vertical. \n\nWait, the code's initial yes is set to (xs - xf) mod k ==0 and (ys - yf) mod k ==0. Wait, but xs and xf are the rows? Wait, looking at the input description: the input is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f, k. The start cell is (x_s, y_s), which is row x_s, column y_s. So the vertical movement is between rows, and horizontal between columns. \n\nWait, the code's variables are named xs and xf as the rows. So the vertical difference is (xs - xf) must be divisible by k. The horizontal difference (y_s - y_f) must also be divisible by k? Wait, the code's initial yes is (xs - xf) mod k ==0 and (ys - yf) mod k ==0. Wait, that's the horizontal difference (y_s - y_f) mod k? Because ys is the column of the start, yf is the column of the finish. So the horizontal distance between columns is (y_s - y_f) must be divisible by k. \n\nWait, but the code's code has (ys - yf) mod k ==0. So that's correct. \n\nBut the code proceeds to compute the maximum a_i between the columns. Because the robot can't move through blocked cells. So when moving from column y_s to y_f, the path must not go through any column where the a_i (the blocked cells) is higher than the current row. \n\nWait, the robot's path must stay above the a_i of each column it passes through. So when moving horizontally, the robot's row must be above the a_i of all columns in between. \n\nWait, the robot can move vertically first, then horizontally, but each command is executed k times. So the path must be such that the robot can move in steps of k steps in any direction, but without crossing blocked cells. \n\nThe code seems to be checking the maximum a_i between the start and finish columns. Because if the maximum a_i in that range is less than the starting row, then the robot can move horizontally. \n\nWait, the code's variables: \n\nmi and ma are the min and max of xs and xf (rows?), but wait, no, the variables are named xs and xf as the rows. Wait, the code's variables are:\n\nWait, in the code, the input is:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\nWait, the input is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f? Wait, the problem says each query has \"x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f and k\". Wait, the code's variables are named as:\n\nLooking at the code's input line:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\nWait, that's probably a mistake. Because the input is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f, k. So the code is reading the variables in the wrong order. Oh, that's a problem. Wait, the code's line is:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\nWait, that's wrong. Because the input for each query is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f, k. So the variables should be:\n\nxs, ys, xf, yf, k = ints()\n\nBecause the first four numbers are x_s (row of start), y_s (column of start), x_f (row of finish), y_f (column of finish). \n\nAh, that's a critical error. So the code is reading the variables in the wrong order, which would completely break the logic. So the first missing code is to fix that line. \n\nWait, the code's line is:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\nBut the input is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f, k. So the first variable should be x_s (xs), then y_s (ys), then x_f (xf), y_f (yf). So the correct assignment is:\n\nxs, ys, xf, yf, k = ints()\n\nSo that's the first correction needed in program1.py. \n\nThen, the code proceeds to check the differences between xs and xf (rows) and ys and yf (columns). Wait, no, the code's initial yes is (xs - xf) mod k ==0 and (ys - yf) mod k ==0. Wait, but xs and xf are rows. So the vertical difference must be divisible by k. The horizontal difference (ys - yf) must be divisible by k. \n\nWait, the code's variables are now correct if we fix the input line. \n\nNext, the code computes mi and ma as min(xs, xf) and max(xs, xf). Wait, but xs and xf are rows. So the vertical movement is between those rows. But the code is then looking at the columns between ys and yf. \n\nWait, the code's next step is to compute the maximum a_i between the columns ys and yf. Because the robot has to move horizontally from column ys to yf. So the path between the columns must have all columns' a_i less than the current row. \n\nWait, the code's variables mi and ma are min(xs, xf) and max(xs, xf), which are rows. That's probably a mistake. Because the columns are between ys and yf. \n\nWait, the code's next lines are:\n\nmi, ma = min(xs, xf), max(xs, xf)\n\nWait, that's min and max of the rows. But the columns are between ys and yf. So this is wrong. The code is trying to compute the maximum a_i between the columns ys and yf. \n\nSo the variables mi and ma should be min(ys, yf) and max(ys, yf). \n\nSo that's another error. \n\nSo the code's variables are messed up because of the initial variable assignment. \n\nSo the first missing code in program1.py is to fix the variable assignments in the input line. \n\nSo the line:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\nshould be:\n\nxs, ys, xf, yf, k = ints()\n\nThen, the mi and ma variables for columns should be min(ys, yf) and max(ys, yf). \n\nSo the code's line:\n\nmi, ma = min(xs, xf), max(xs, xf)\n\nshould be:\n\nmi, ma = min(ys, yf), max(ys, yf)\n\nThen, the code proceeds to compute the maximum a_i between the columns. \n\nThe code's next line is:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi:min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)] + a[max(mi, ma//s *s):ma])\n\nWait, the a array is of length m, but the columns are 1-based? Or 0-based? \n\nWait, the problem says the second line of input is m integers a_1 to a_m. So the code's a is read as a list from input, which is 0-based in Python. So the first element a[0] is a_1. Wait, no, the code's a is read as a list from the second line, which is m numbers. So the columns are 1-based in the problem, but in the code, the a array is 0-based. So for column y (1-based), the a[y-1] is the a_i. \n\nSo when the code is accessing a[mi], that's assuming that the columns are 0-based. \n\nWait, the code's variables ys and yf are the column numbers (since the input is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f). So ys and yf are between 1 and m. So to index into a, we need to subtract 1. \n\nWait, the code's a is read as a list from the second line, which is m numbers. So a[0] is a_1 (the first column's a_i). So for column number y (1-based), the a value is a[y-1]. \n\nTherefore, when the code is accessing a[mi], it's using the column numbers as indices, but they are 1-based. So that's an error. \n\nSo the code's variables ys and yf are the column numbers (1-based), so the code should subtract 1 when accessing a. \n\nSo the code's line:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi:min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)] + a[max(mi, ma//s *s):ma])\n\nis incorrect because mi and ma are the column numbers (1-based), so the indices into a should be from mi-1 to ma-1. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are all off by one. \n\nThis suggests that the code has several errors, but the user is asking to fill in the missing parts. \n\nLooking back at the problem's code for program1.py, the code has:\n\nn, m = ints()  # first line input\na = ints()  # second line, m numbers. So a is 0-based for columns 1 to m. \n\nThen, the code computes s as the square root of m. \n\nmaxs is a list of the maximum a in each block of size s. \n\nThen, for each query:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()  # this is wrong, as per the input description. \n\nWait, the input for each query is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f, k. So the variables should be:\n\nxs (x_s), ys (y_s), xf (x_f), yf (y_f), k. \n\nSo the code's line is wrong. \n\nSo the first missing code is to fix that line. \n\nSo the first correction is to change the line:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\nto:\n\nxs, ys, xf, yf, k = ints()\n\nThen, the code's variables are correct. \n\nNext, the code's variables for columns are ys and yf (the start and finish columns). \n\nThe code then computes mi and ma as min(xs, xf) and max(xs, xf). But xs and xf are rows. So that's wrong. \n\nThe columns are between ys and yf. So mi and ma should be min(ys, yf) and max(ys, yf). \n\nSo the code's line:\n\nmi, ma = min(xs, xf), max(xs, xf)\n\nshould be:\n\nmi, ma = min(ys, yf), max(ys, yf)\n\nThen, the code proceeds to compute the maximum a_i between the columns. \n\nThe code's next line is:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi:min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)] + a[max(mi, ma//s *s):ma])\n\nWait, the a array is 0-based, but the columns are 1-based. So the indices into a should be (mi-1) to (ma-1). \n\nWait, the code's mi and ma are the column numbers (since they are min(ys, yf) and max(...)), so the indices into a are from mi-1 to ma-1. \n\nSo the code's current code is using the column numbers as indices, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the code's line should be:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi-1 : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s) -1] + ... )\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. \n\nThe code is trying to compute the maximum a_i between columns mi and ma (the start and end columns). \n\nThe code uses a block-based approach. The array a is divided into blocks of size s. The maxs array holds the maximum of each block. \n\nThe code's approach is to compute the maximum a_i in the range from mi to ma. \n\nThe code first checks the first block (from mi to the end of the first block), then the middle blocks (using the maxs array), and then the last block (from the start of the last block to ma). \n\nBut the code's current code is using the column numbers as indices, but since a is 0-based, the indices should be (mi-1) to (ma-1). \n\nSo the code's line:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)] + a[max(mi, (ma//s)*s) : ma])\n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are off by one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should subtract 1 from mi and ma. \n\nLet me re-express the code's variables:\n\nLet's denote the start column as y_start = ys, finish column y_finish = yf. \n\nThe columns between them are from min(y_start, y_finish) to max(...). \n\nThe code's mi and ma are min(ys, yf) and max(...). \n\nThe a array is 0-based, so the indices are from mi-1 to ma-1. \n\nSo the code's first part is:\n\na[mi : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)]\n\nBut since the indices are 0-based, the correct indices would be from (mi-1) to (min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s) -1). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is 0-based. \n\nWait, the code's a is read as a list of m elements, so a[0] is the first column's a_i. \n\nTherefore, the code's current code is using the column numbers (1-based) as indices into a, which is 0-based. So that's wrong. \n\nTherefore, the code's line should be:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi-1 : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s) -1] + ... )\n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should subtract 1 from mi and ma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nThis is getting a bit too involved. Let's see what the code is trying to do. \n\nThe code is trying to compute the maximum a_i between columns ys and yf. \n\nThe code uses a block-based approach where the array is divided into blocks of size s. \n\nThe first part of the code is to compute the maximum in the first partial block (from mi to the end of the first block), then the middle blocks (using the maxs array), and then the last partial block (from the start of the last block to ma). \n\nThe code's current code for the first part is a[mi : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)]. \n\nBut since the columns are 1-based, the indices into a should be (mi-1) to (min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s) -1). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should subtract 1 from mi and ma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nThis is a bit too time-consuming. Let's think of the code's logic. \n\nThe code's current approach is to compute the maximum a_i between the start and finish columns. \n\nThe code's variables mi and ma are the min and max of the columns (ys and yf). \n\nThe code then computes the first segment from mi to the end of the first block. \n\nThe first block's end is (mi//s)*s + s. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's s is the block size. \n\nWait, s is set as m **0.5 +1. \n\nThe maxs array is built by taking each block of s elements and computing their max. \n\nSo for the first block starting at mi, the code's first segment is from mi to the end of the first block. \n\nBut since the a array is 0-based, the indices should be (mi-1) to (end-1). \n\nTherefore, the code's current code is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code's line should be:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi-1 : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s) -1] + ... )\n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should subtract 1 from mi and ma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's think of the code's logic. \n\nThe code's current code for the first part is:\n\na[mi : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)]\n\nBut since the columns are 1-based, the indices into a should be (mi-1) to (min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s) -1). \n\nTherefore, the code's line should be:\n\na[mi-1 : min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s) -1]\n\nWait, but the end index in Python is exclusive. So the slice from a[mi-1] to a[end-1] would be a[mi-1 : end]. \n\nWait, for example, if the first block ends at position (mi//s +1)*s, then the end is (mi//s +1)*s. \n\nSo the first segment is from mi to (mi//s +1)*s. \n\nBut since the columns are 1-based, the indices into a are (mi-1) to ( (mi//s +1)*s -1 ). \n\nTherefore, the slice should be a[mi-1 : (mi//s +1)*s]. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should subtract 1 from mi and ma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Let's proceed to the next part. \n\nThe code then loops over the middle blocks. \n\nfor j in range(min(xs, xf)//s +1, max(xs, xf)//s):\n\nWait, again, xs and xf are rows, but the code is trying to loop over the blocks of columns. \n\nWait, the code's variables here are using xs and xf (rows) instead of the columns. \n\nThis is another error. \n\nThe code's loop should be over the blocks between the columns. \n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor j in range(min(xs, xf)//s +1, max(xs, xf)//s):\n\nBut xs and xf are rows, so this is incorrect. \n\nThe correct variables should be the columns' indices divided by s. \n\nThe code should loop over the blocks between the columns. \n\nThe correct loop would be:\n\nfor j in range( (mi-1) // s +1, (ma-1) // s ):\n\nWait, since the columns are between mi and ma (1-based), their indices in a are (mi-1) to (ma-1). \n\nSo the blocks are divided by s. \n\nThe code's current loop is using xs and xf (rows) which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the code's loop should be:\n\nfor j in range( (mi-1) // s +1, (ma-1) // s ):\n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the loop is using the wrong variables. \n\nThis is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the code's initial variables are wrong, and the first missing code is to fix the variable assignments. \n\nSo the first missing code in program1.py is to correct the variable assignments in the input line. \n\nThe line:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\nshould be:\n\nxs, ys, xf, yf, k = ints()\n\nThat's the first correction. \n\nThen, the code's variables for columns are ys and yf. \n\nThe code's mi and ma variables should be min(ys, yf) and max(ys, yf). \n\nSo the line:\n\nmi, ma = min(xs, xf), max(xs, xf)\n\nshould be:\n\nmi, ma = min(ys, yf), max(ys, yf)\n\nThen, the code's next line is:\n\nhigh = max([0] + a[mi:min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)] + a[max(mi, (ma//s)*s):ma])\n\nBut since a is 0-based, the indices should be (mi-1) to (ma-1). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should subtract 1 from mi and ma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are correct, but the a array is being accessed with the wrong indices. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is about a tree where each second, you can infect one node via injection, and then spread the disease by infecting at most one child of each node that has an infected child. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of seconds to infect all nodes. \n\nThe code provided is:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ncounter = defaultdict(int)\n\ndef solve(a):\n    for ai in a:\n        counter[ai] += 1\n    count = list(counter.values())\n    num_level = len(count)\n    count.sort()\n\n    for i in range(num_level):\n        count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n    \n    L = 0; R = max(count)\n\n    if R == 0:\n        return num_level + 1\n\n    def check(k):\n        b = count.copy()\n        for i in range(len(b)):\n            b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n        if sum(b) <= k:\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    while R - L > 1:\n        mid = (R + L) // 2\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    return num_level + 1 + R\n\nfor a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n    counter.clear()\n    res = solve(a.split())\n    print(res)\n\nThe code is trying to compute the minimal time. \n\nThe problem requires that each second, you can choose one node to inject, and then spread the disease by infecting at most one child per node that has an infected child. \n\nThe approach in the code seems to involve counting the number of nodes at each level. \n\nWait, the code's solve function takes a list a (the parents of the nodes 2 to n). \n\nThe code is using a defaultdict to count the number of children each node has. \n\nWait, the code's first line in solve is:\n\nfor ai in a:\n    counter[ai] +=1\n\nSo for each parent in the input (which is p_2 to p_n), the counter counts how many children each node has. \n\nWait, the parents are given for nodes 2 to n. So the root is 1. \n\nThe counter counts the number of children each node has. \n\nThen, the count list is the list of the number of children for each node. \n\nWait, but the code's count is list(counter.values()), which is the counts of children for each node. \n\nThen, the code sorts count. \n\nThen, for each i in 0..num_level-1, it does count[i] = max(count[i] - i -2, 0). \n\nHmm, not sure what this is doing. \n\nThe code then proceeds to binary search between L and R. \n\nThe check function is trying to see if a certain k can be the minimal time. \n\nThe code's binary search is between 0 and max(count). \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal time T such that the required conditions are met. \n\nThe code's approach might be based on the observation that the time needed is related to the maximum number of children in a certain way. \n\nThe missing part in the code is in the binary search loop. \n\nThe code has:\n\nwhile R - L >1:\n    mid = (R+L)//2\n    if check(mid):\n        R = mid\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else clause should set L = mid. \n\nSo the missing code is L = mid. \n\nWait, in a binary search, when the check(mid) is false, you need to search higher. So in the else clause, L should be set to mid +1? Or mid? \n\nWait, the code's current setup is:\n\nInitially, L is 0, R is max(count). \n\nThe loop continues while R-L>1. \n\nIf check(mid) is true, set R=mid. \n\nElse, we need to set L to mid. \n\nWait, no. Let me think: \n\nSuppose the condition is that we want the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nWait, the code's check function returns True if k is sufficient. \n\nWe are trying to find the minimal k where check(k) is true. \n\nThe binary search is looking for the minimal R. \n\nWait, the code's initial R is the maximum count. \n\nThe loop is structured as:\n\nwhile R-L>1:\n\n    mid = (R+L)//2\n\n    if check(mid):\n\n        R = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        L = mid \n\nWait, no. Because if check(mid) is false, then the required k must be larger than mid. So L should be set to mid. \n\nWait, for example, if the current L is 5 and R is 10, and mid is 7. If check(7) is false, then the answer must be >7, so L becomes 7. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the loop continues until R-L <=1. \n\nSo the missing code in the else clause is L = mid. \n\nTherefore, the code's missing part is:\n\nL = mid \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nelse:\n\n    L = mid \n\nThus, the program2.py's missing code is to set L = mid in the else clause. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code for program1.py is the variable assignments and the mi/ma variables. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to output only the missing code, not the entire program. \n\nThe user's instruction says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py' runs correctly. Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nThe output format is a JSON with \"program1\" and \"program2\" keys, each being the completion. \n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the lines that were commented as TODO. \n\nLooking back at program1.py's code:\n\nIn the code, after the initial yes condition, there's an if not yes: block with a TODO. \n\nWait, the code's code is:\n\nyes = (xs - xf) % k ==0 and (ys - yf) %k ==0 \n\nif not yes:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThen, the code proceeds to compute mi and ma, etc. \n\nWait, but the code's logic is that if the initial condition is not met (i.e., the coordinate differences are not divisible by k), then the answer is automatically \"NO\". \n\nWait, the code's current code proceeds to compute other things even if yes is false. \n\nWait, the code's code after the if not yes: block is not in the if block. \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nyes = ... \n\nif not yes:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nmi, ma = ... \n\nhigh = ... \n\nif high < ys:\n\n    print('yes')\n\n    continue \n\nprint('yes' if ... else 'no')\n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nThe code's logic is that even if the initial condition is not met (yes is false), it proceeds to compute other things. \n\nBut the initial condition is necessary for the answer to be \"YES\". \n\nSo if the initial condition is not met, the answer must be \"NO\". \n\nTherefore, the code should immediately print 'NO' in that case. \n\nThe code's current code has a TODO in the if not yes block. \n\nSo the missing code there is to set yes to False and then break, but the code's structure is such that after the if not yes block, it proceeds to compute other things. \n\nWait, the code's code after the if not yes block is not in the if block. \n\nWait, the code's code is:\n\nif not yes:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nmi, ma = ... \n\nhigh = ... \n\nSo the code proceeds to compute mi and ma even if yes is false. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code should have an else clause. \n\nWait, the code's logic is that the initial condition is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nSo the code should first check if the initial condition is not met, then output 'NO'. \n\nTherefore, the code should have:\n\nif not yes:\n\n    print('NO')\n\n    continue \n\nBut the code's current code does not do that. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO is to print 'NO' and continue. \n\nSo the code's TODO block should be:\n\nprint('NO')\n\ncontinue \n\nThus, the code's structure would be:\n\nyes = ... \n\nif not yes:\n\n    print('NO')\n\n    continue \n\nThen, proceed with the rest of the code. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is to replace the TODO with:\n\nprint('NO')\n\ncontinue \n\nSo the code's program1.py's missing code is the lines inside the if not yes block. \n\nPutting all together, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\nIn the line where the variables are read:\n\nys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints() \u2192 should be xs, ys, xf, yf, k = ints()\n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nWait, the user's problem says that the code provided has missing lines or blocks that must be filled in. \n\nLooking back at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor i in range(Int()):\n\n    ys, xs, yf, xf, k = ints()\n\n    yes = (xs - xf) % k ==0 and (ys - yf) %k ==0 \n\n    if not yes:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\n    mi, ma = min(xs, xf), max(xs, xf)\n\n    high = max([0] + a[mi:min(ma, (mi//s +1)*s)] + a[max(mi, (ma//s)*s):ma])\n\n    for j in range(min(xs, xf)//s +1, max(xs, xf)//s):\n\n        high = max(high, maxs[j])\n\n    if high < ys:\n\n        print('yes')\n\n        continue \n\n    print('yes' if ((high - ys)//k +1)*k + ys <=n else 'no')\n\nThe missing code is in the TODO block. \n\nThe correct code there is to print 'NO' and continue. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is:\n\nprint('NO')\n\ncontinue \n\nThus, the program1's completion is the code for the TODO block. \n\nAdditionally, there are other errors in the code, such as the variable assignments and the mi/ma variables. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe problem says that the code has missing lines or blocks that you must fill in. \n\nThe code provided has a TODO in the if not yes block. \n\nThe other errors (like variable assignments) are not missing code but actual errors. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output the missing code so that the programs run correctly. \n\nTherefore, the code's variables are wrong, but the user's problem may have intended that the code's variables are correct except for the TODO. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are correct except for the TODO. \n\nWait, the problem's code for program1.py may have other errors, but the user is asking to fill in the missing parts. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output the missing code, not to fix other errors. \n\nTherefore, the only missing code is the TODO block. \n\nThus, the program1's completion is the code for the TODO block. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is:\n\nprint('NO')\n\ncontinue \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is in the else clause of the binary search loop. \n\nThe code's else clause has a TODO, and the missing code is to set L = mid. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile R - L >1:\n\n    mid = (R + L)//2\n\n    if check(mid):\n\n        R = mid \n\n    else:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe correct code here is to set L = mid. \n\nWait, but in binary search, when the condition is not met, you need to search higher. \n\nWait, the check function returns True if k is sufficient. \n\nWe are trying to find the minimal k where check(k) is true. \n\nInitially, L is 0, R is max(count). \n\nIf check(mid) is true, then we can try to find a smaller R. \n\nIf not, then we need to increase L. \n\nWait, the code's current setup is:\n\nif check(mid) \u2192 set R = mid \n\nelse \u2192 set L = mid \n\nWait, but the loop continues until R-L <=1. \n\nWait, let's see an example. \n\nSuppose the correct answer is 5. \n\nSuppose L=0, R=10. \n\nmid =5. \n\nIf check(5) is true \u2192 set R=5. \n\nNow R-L is 5. \n\nNext iteration: mid is (0+5)/2=2. \n\nIf check(2) is false \u2192 set L=2. \n\nNow L=2, R=5 \u2192 difference is 3. \n\nmid is 3.5 \u2192 3. \n\nCheck(3). \n\nIf check(3) is false \u2192 set L=3. \n\nNow L=3, R=5 \u2192 difference 2. \n\nmid is 4. \n\nCheck(4). \n\nIf check(4) is false \u2192 set L=4. \n\nNow L=4, R=5 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 loop ends. \n\nThen, the minimal R is 5. \n\nWait, but perhaps the code's logic is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should set L = mid +1. \n\nWait, the code's current code would set L = mid. \n\nBut in the case where check(mid) is false, the required k must be larger than mid. \n\nSo the new L should be mid +1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's else clause should be L = mid +1. \n\nWait, let's think of the binary search for the minimal k where check(k) is true. \n\nThe initial L is 0, R is max(count). \n\nWe want to find the smallest k where check(k) is true. \n\nThe binary search proceeds as follows:\n\n- Compute mid = (L+R)//2 \n\n- If check(mid) is true \u2192 the answer could be mid or lower. So set R = mid. \n\n- Else \u2192 the answer must be higher than mid. So set L = mid +1. \n\nThe loop continues until L < R. \n\nThe final answer is R (or L, depending on the loop condition). \n\nIn the code's current setup, the loop is while R-L>1. \n\nSo when the loop exits, R-L is 1. \n\nThen, we need to check between L and R. \n\nThus, the correct code for the else clause is L = mid +1. \n\nWait, but the code's current code has R initialized to max(count). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's binary search is set up to find the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nThe code's current code in the else clause should set L = mid. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the correct answer is 5. \n\nInitial L=0, R=10. \n\nmid =5. \n\nIf check(5) is true \u2192 set R=5. \n\nNow R=5, L=0 \u2192 difference 5. \n\nNext iteration: mid is 2. \n\nIf check(2) is false \u2192 set L=2. \n\nNow L=2, R=5 \u2192 difference 3. \n\nmid is 3. \n\nIf check(3) is false \u2192 set L=3. \n\nNow L=3, R=5 \u2192 difference 2. \n\nmid is 4. \n\nIf check(4) is false \u2192 set L=4. \n\nNow L=4, R=5 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 loop ends. \n\nNow, we need to check between 4 and 5. \n\nCheck(4) is false \u2192 so the minimal is 5. \n\nThus, the code's approach of setting L=mid in the else clause works. \n\nWait, in the case where check(mid) is false, the code sets L=mid. \n\nThus, the code's approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is L = mid. \n\nThus, the program2's completion is L = mid. \n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the TODO block:\n\nprint('NO')\n\ncontinue \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is L = mid in the else clause. \n\nThus, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"print('NO')\\ncontinue\",\n    \"program2\": \"L = mid\"\n}"
