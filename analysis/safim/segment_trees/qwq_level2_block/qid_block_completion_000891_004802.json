So the formula is:\n\nTotal = (A + B - 2 * C), where:\n\nA is the number of pairs with same first character. B is the number with same second. C is the number with same first and same second. So this formula can be used. This is a much better approach. So how to compute A, B, C? A is the sum over all a of (count_a choose 2). Similarly, B is sum over b of (count_b choose 2). C is the sum over all (a,b) of (count_ab choose 2). Thus, the total is (A + B - 2*C). This is O(26 + 26 + 26*26) per test case, which is manageable. So this is the correct approach.

Thus, the contribution for the current string is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * c_prev). The code's approach is to add a[d] and b[e], then subtract c_prev. Wait, but that would give (a[d] + b[e] - c_prev), which is not the desired formula. Ah, so the code is missing a subtraction of c_prev again. Hence, the code's current approach is incorrect. So the code's logic for the c part is wrong. The code's current handling of c is:\n\nif d+e not in c: c[d+e] = 0\nelse:\n    ans -= c[d+e]\nc[d+e] +=2\n\nWait, let's see what this does. Suppose the current string is the first occurrence of d+e. Then, the code sets c[d+e] to 0. Then, since it was present (no, the first condition is not present, so the else is not taken. Thus, the ans is not subtracted. Then, c[d+e] becomes 0 +2 \u2192 2. Wait, that's odd. The next time the same string comes, the code will check if it's in c (yes). Then, ans -= c[d+e] (which is 2). Then, c becomes 2 +2 \u21924. Hmm, this seems to be tracking something else. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using c to track twice the count.

Because any substring has at most two different characters, and their counts can differ by at most 1. For example, the substring \"ab\" has counts 1 and 1. The substring \"a\" has counts 1 for a, and 0 for b and c. The difference between a and b is 1 (0 vs 1?), no. Wait, the difference between a and b in the substring \"a\" is 1 (since a has 1, b has 0 \u2192 difference 1). The difference between a and c is also 1. The difference between b and c is 1 (0 and 0 \u2192 0). So all differences are \u22641. Thus, \"abc\" is okay. Another example: \"abba\" \u2192 the substring \"bb\" has counts a:0, b:2.",

The code's logic is unclear. The problem requires that every substring must satisfy the condition. The code's approach seems to be checking if the string is periodic in some way, but it's not clear. The example given in the problem's note shows that \"aba\" is perfectly balanced. The code's current approach may not be correct. Let me think of the conditions required for a string to be perfectly balanced. The key is that for any substring, the frequencies of any two characters in it must not differ by more than 1. This is a very strict condition. Let's think of what strings can satisfy this. First, the string can have all characters the same \u2192 yes. Or, the string can have length 1 \u2192 yes.",

Then, it constructs a string by repeating the prefix up to that point. If the original string is equal to this repeated string, then it returns \"YES\". For example, in the case of \"abab\", the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=1 (s[1] is 'b', which is not in s[0] (a). Wait, no. Wait, for \"abab\", the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2. s[2] is 'a', which is present in s[:2] (which is 'ab'). So the prefix is s[:2] = 'ab'. Repeating this twice gives 'abab', which matches the original string. Thus, the code would return \"YES\". Another example: \"aba\" \u2192 the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2 (s[2] is 'a', which is in s[:2] = 'ab'). The prefix is 'ab', repeating it to length 3 would give 'aba', which matches the original string. Thus, returns \"YES\". Another example: \"abba\" \u2192 the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2 (s[2] is 'b', which is in s[:2] = 'ab'). The prefix is 'ab', repeating it to length 4 gives 'abab', which is not equal to 'abba', so returns \"NO\". This is correct because 'abba' has the substring 'bb' which has a difference of 2 between a and b. Thus, the code's logic seems to work for these cases. The code's approach is to check if the string is a repetition of a prefix up to the first duplicate character. If so, then it returns \"YES\", else \"NO\". But why does this work?",

If yes, then it's a valid string. Otherwise, it's not. Thus, the code's logic is correct. The missing part is in the else clause of the code's loop. The code currently has:\n\nelse:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\n    break\n\nThe code is inside a loop over i from 1 to a-1. When it finds an i where s[i] is in s[:i], it constructs w and checks if s equals w. If yes \u2192 print \"YES\", else \u2192 the code is supposed to print \"NO\". But the code currently has a break after the if-else. Thus, the missing code is to print \"NO\" in the else case. So the code should be:\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\") Thus, the missing code for program2.py is to add print(\"NO\") in the else clause of the inner if statement. So putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is in the except block for a's KeyError: set a[d] =1. For program2.py, the missing code is to print \"NO\" in the else clause of the inner if statement. Thus, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"a[d] = 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"print('NO')\"\n}",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position. Each string is of length 2. So for two strings like \"ab\" and \"cd\", they would differ in both positions. But if they are \"ab\" and \"cb\", they differ in the first character, so that's a valid pair. Similarly, \"ab\" and \"aa\" differ in the second character.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some variables a, b, c. Let me look at the code structure. The loop is going through each string, splitting into d and e (the first and second characters). Then trying to add a[d], but that might be part of the count. Wait, the code is trying to compute the answer by tracking counts in some way. But there's a KeyError exception for a[d], so when a[d] doesn't exist, they need to set it to 1? Or maybe initialize it?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the first loop for each test case:\n\nThey have a, b, c as dictionaries. For each string d and e (the two characters):\n\nThey try to add a[d] to ans, then increment a[d]. If KeyError, then they have to handle that. But the code currently has a comment in the except block for a's KeyError. Similarly for b[e].\n\nWait, the logic here might be trying to count pairs where the first characters are the same, and the second characters are the same, but then subtract those where both are same? Because the total pairs with exactly one differing character would be the sum of pairs differing in first character only plus those differing in second only. But maybe the current approach is using some inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track for each first character, how many times it has been seen before, and similarly for the second. But then subtract the cases where both are same, because those would have been counted in both a and b but actually need to be subtracted because they differ in zero positions.\n\nWait, the code's current approach might be:\n\nThe ans starts at 0. For each new string (d,e):\n\n- The a[d] counts how many previous strings had the same first character. Adding that to ans would count all pairs where the first characters are same, but maybe that's part of the first differing position?\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that for each new string, the number of pairs where the first character is the same as previous strings (so differing in the second character) plus the number where the second is same (so differing in first). But then subtract the cases where both are same (since those would have been counted in both a and b but actually are zero differing characters).\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nSuppose two strings have the same first character. Then, to have exactly one differing character, their second characters must differ. So for each new string, the number of previous strings with same first character but different second character would contribute to the count. But how is that tracked here?\n\nAlternatively, the current code's approach might be:\n\nThe total pairs where first characters are same: a[d] (since each previous occurrence of d in first character could form a pair with current, but only if the second characters differ). Similarly for the second character. But this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the sum of a[d] (count of previous first characters) plus b[e] (count of previous second characters), then subtract the cases where both are same (so the total would be (a[d] + b[e] - c[d+e]) where c[d+e] is the count of previous occurrences of the exact same pair. Because when both first and second are same, then the pair would have been counted in both a and b, but we need to subtract those cases where both are same (since those pairs have zero differing characters). \n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nAfter trying to add a[d] and b[e], then they check if d+e is in c. If it's not, then c[d+e] is set to 0, else it's incremented. Then ans -= c[d+e], and then c[d+e] +=2? Wait, the code's logic here is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe code for the current string (d,e):\n\n- The first part tries to add a[d], which is the count of previous strings with the same first character. So for each such previous string, if their second character is different, then they form a pair differing in the second position. But if their second character is same, then they form a pair that differs in zero positions. So adding a[d] would overcount those cases where the second character is same. Similarly for the second part with b[e].\n\nSo the total would be (a[d] + b[e]) minus 2 * the number of previous strings that are exactly the same as current (since those would have been counted in both a and b, but they are invalid pairs). Wait, but how does that work?\n\nWait, let's think of the formula:\n\nThe number of pairs where the first characters are the same (so differing in second or same) is a[d], but we want only those where the second characters differ. So the actual contribution from first character same is (a[d] - count of same second character). Similarly for the second character same, the contribution is (b[e] - count of same first character). But combining these terms might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total desired pairs for the current string with previous ones is (number of previous with same first and different second) + (number with same second and different first). \n\nWhich can be written as (count_first_d - same_pairs) + (count_second_e - same_pairs), where same_pairs is the number of previous strings with both characters same as current. \n\nSo total contribution for current string is (count_first_d + count_second_e - 2 * same_pairs). \n\nBecause (count_first_d - same_pairs) + (count_second_e - same_pairs) = count_first_d + count_second_e - 2 same_pairs.\n\nSo the code's approach is to track count_first_d (a[d]), count_second_e (b[e]), and same_pairs (c[d+e], which is the count of previous occurrences of the exact string).\n\nSo the contribution for the current string is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * c_prev), where c_prev is the previous count of the exact string. \n\nBut in the code, the way it's implemented is:\n\nInitially, when processing the current string, the code does:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d]\n    a[d] +=1\nexcept KeyError:\n    # here, a[d] didn't exist before, so adding 0 (since a[d] is not present, so the try block would have failed)\n    # but the code has a comment here. Wait, the code's current structure is:\n\nWait, the code for a[d]:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d]\n    a[d] +=1\nexcept KeyError:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if a[d] is not present (KeyError), then the try block would fail, and go to except. But in that case, the code needs to initialize a[d] to 1, perhaps? Because the current string is the first occurrence of d as the first character. So when adding to ans, the previous count was 0 (since there were no previous strings with first character d). So the contribution from a[d] would be 0, but then a[d] should be set to 1 (since this is the first occurrence). \n\nWait, the code's current approach for a[d] is:\n\nWhen processing the j-th string (current string), the code tries to add a[d] to ans. Then increments a[d] by 1. But if a[d] is not present (KeyError), then the except block is entered. \n\nWait, but in the except block, the code is supposed to handle the case where a[d] didn't exist. So in that case, the code should set a[d] to 1, and since there were no previous entries, the contribution to ans would be 0 (since a[d] was 0 before adding). \n\nWait, the code's current structure for a[d] is:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d]  # this would be the previous count of a[d]\n    a[d] +=1     # increment the count for future\nexcept KeyError:\n    # here, a[d] was not present, so the try block failed. So the contribution from a[d] is 0 (since there were no previous entries)\n    # so we need to set a[d] to 1 now, so that next time, it's counted\n    a[d] = 1     # but the code's current except block is empty except for the comment\n\nAh, so the missing code here is to set a[d] to 1. Because when the KeyError occurs, that means this is the first occurrence of d as the first character. So the code should set a[d] = 1. \n\nSimilarly for the b[e] part. Wait, looking at the code for b[e]:\n\ntry:\n    ans += b[e]\n    b[e] +=1\nexcept KeyError:\n    b[e] = 1\n\nSo that part is handled correctly. The except block for b is okay. \n\nSo the missing code in the a's KeyError is to set a[d] = 0? Wait no. Wait, the code for a's KeyError case needs to set a[d] to 1, because after the try block, the code would have added a[d] (which was 0, but KeyError implies it's not present). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code for a[d] is:\n\nWhen processing the current string's first character d:\n\nThe code tries to add a[d] to ans. If a[d] exists, then that's the count of previous strings with first character d. So adding that to ans is correct (since each of those previous strings contributes to the first part of the formula). Then, after adding, a[d] is incremented by 1 (so that future strings will have the correct count). \n\nBut if a[d] does not exist (KeyError), then the try block fails. So in that case, the code must set a[d] to 1 (since this is the first occurrence). But the contribution to ans would be 0 (since there were no previous entries). \n\nSo in the except block for a's KeyError, the code should set a[d] = 1. \n\nSo the missing code in the first except block (for a[d]) is:\n\na[d] = 1\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the except block for a's KeyError is empty except for the comment. So the correct code here is to set a[d] = 1. \n\nSo that's the first missing part. \n\nNow, looking at the next part of the code:\n\nAfter handling a and b, the code deals with c (the exact string count). \n\nThe code does:\n\nif d+e not in c:\n    c[d+e] = 0\nelse:\n    ans -= c[d+e]\nc[d+e] +=2\n\nWait, let's see. The variable c is tracking the count of the exact string (d+e). \n\nThe logic here is that for the current string, the number of previous occurrences is the current value of c[d+e] before updating. \n\nWait, the code first checks if d+e is in c. If not, set it to 0. Then, if it was present (else clause?), no, the code's structure is:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif d+e not in c:\n    c[d+e] = 0\nelse:\n    ans -= c[d+e]\nc[d+e] +=2\n\nWait, the code first checks if the key is not present. If so, set to 0. Then, if it was present (the else clause), subtract c[d+e] from ans. Then, in any case, add 2 to c[d+e]. \n\nWait, but the code's logic here is a bit confusing. Let's think:\n\nThe variable c is supposed to track the count of the exact string. \n\nThe contribution from the current string to the answer is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * previous_count). \n\nWait, the formula earlier was (count_first_d + count_second_e - 2 * same_pairs). \n\nThe a[d] and b[e] are the counts before processing the current string. \n\nWait, when processing the current string, the a[d] and b[e] are the counts before adding the current string. \n\nSo the contribution for the current string is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * c_prev), where c_prev is the previous count of the exact string. \n\nBut in the code, the ans is being built by adding a[d] and b[e], but then subtracting c_prev (the previous count of the exact string). \n\nWait, the code's approach is:\n\nans += a[d] (from first part)\nans += b[e] (from second part)\nthen, subtract c_prev (the previous count of the exact string) multiplied by 2? Or how?\n\nWait, the code's current steps:\n\nAfter adding a[d] and b[e], the code then deals with the exact string. \n\nThe code first checks if the current string (d+e) is in c. \n\nIf not, set c[d+e] to 0. \n\nElse, ans -= c[d+e]. \n\nThen, c[d+e] +=2. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of previous occurrences. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the current string is the k-th occurrence of the exact string. \n\nThe previous count (before processing this string) is (current c value - 1?), but I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic for c is:\n\nThe variable c stores the count of the exact string before processing the current string. \n\nWait, when processing the current string, the code first checks if the key exists. \n\nIf it's not in c, then set to 0. \n\nThen, if it was present (else clause), then ans -= c[d+e]. \n\nWait, but the else clause is only when it was present before the check. \n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nIf the key is not in c, then set to 0. \n\nElse (meaning it was present before), then subtract the current value (which is the previous count) from ans. \n\nThen, after that, add 2 to the c's value. \n\nWait, but why?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of previous occurrences. \n\nWait, let's think of the exact string's count before processing this string as prev_count = c.get(d+e, 0). \n\nThen, the contribution from the current string to the answer is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * prev_count). \n\nBecause the a[d] and b[e] counts include the previous occurrences, but the exact matches (same first and second) need to be subtracted twice. \n\nSo the total contribution is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * prev_count). \n\nBut the code's approach is:\n\nans += a[d] (from first part)\nans += b[e] (from second part)\nthen, subtract prev_count (from the exact string count) multiplied by 1? \n\nWait, the code subtracts c[d+e] (the previous count) once. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the current string is the third occurrence of the exact string. \n\nprev_count is 2 (since before processing, there were two previous). \n\nThe contribution would be (a[d] (which includes previous 2) + b[e] (also includes previous 2) - 2 * 2). \n\nSo the total contribution is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * prev_count). \n\nBut in the code's approach, the a[d] and b[e] are added, then subtract prev_count once. \n\nSo the difference between the desired formula and the code's approach is that the code subtracts only once, but needs to subtract twice. \n\nHmm, that suggests that the code's logic is wrong here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach. \n\nWait, let's think of the formula again. \n\nThe total desired pairs for the current string with all previous strings is the number of previous strings that differ in exactly one position. \n\nThese are the strings that either have the same first character and different second, or same second and different first. \n\nThe number of such strings is (count_first_d - same) + (count_second_e - same), where same is the number of previous strings with same first and second. \n\nSo total contribution is (count_first_d - same) + (count_second_e - same) = (count_first_d + count_second_e) - 2 * same. \n\nSo the code's approach is to add count_first_d and count_second_e, then subtract 2 * same. \n\nBut in the code, the a[d] and b[e] are added, then subtract same once. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code is missing a subtraction of same again. \n\nWait, looking at the code's steps:\n\nAfter adding a[d] and b[e], the code then subtracts c_prev (the previous count of the exact string). \n\nThen, the code adds 2 to c. \n\nWait, perhaps the variable c is storing something else. \n\nWait, the code's c is being incremented by 2 each time. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, when the current string is processed, the code checks if the key is present. \n\nSuppose the current string is the first occurrence of d+e. \n\nThen, the code sets c[d+e] to 0 (since it wasn't present). \n\nThen, since it was not present, the else clause is not taken. \n\nThen, c[d+e] +=2 \u2192 becomes 2. \n\nWait, that's odd. \n\nWait, perhaps the variable c is storing twice the count? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using c to track the number of previous occurrences, but in a way that when you add 2 each time, it's to account for something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of previous occurrences, but the way it's done is a bit off. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic for c is incorrect, and needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is correct but the way it's implemented is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's c is storing the number of previous occurrences, and the subtraction is done once, but the formula requires subtracting twice. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the current string is the third occurrence of the exact string. \n\nprev_count = 2 (since before processing, there were two previous). \n\nThe contribution would be (count_first_d (which is 3, since a[d] was 2 before adding, then after adding, it becomes 3?) Wait, no. \n\nWait, the a[d] is the count of previous first characters. \n\nWait, when processing the current string, the a[d] is the count before adding the current string. \n\nWait, in the code, when processing the current string, the code does:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d]\n    a[d] +=1\nexcept KeyError:\n    a[d] = 1\n\nWait, so for a[d], the current a[d] after the try-except block is the count including the current string. \n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose a[d] was 2 before processing this string. \n\nThen, in the try block, ans += 2 (the previous count), then a[d] becomes 3. \n\nSo the a[d] after processing is 3. \n\nSo the a[d] before processing was 2, and after is 3. \n\nSo when the code is processing the current string, the a[d] used in the formula is the previous count (2). \n\nSimilarly for b[e]. \n\nSo the contribution from the first part (a[d]) is the previous count of first characters. \n\nThe same for the second part (b[e]). \n\nThe same_count is the previous count of the exact string (before processing this string). \n\nSo the formula is (a_prev + b_prev - 2 * same_prev). \n\nThe code's approach is:\n\nans += a_prev (from a[d] in the try block)\nans += b_prev (from b[e] in the try block)\nthen, subtract same_prev (from the c's previous value). \n\nBut that gives (a_prev + b_prev - same_prev), which is not the desired formula. \n\nSo the code is missing a subtraction of same_prev again. \n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is under-subtracting by one. \n\nSo the problem is in the part where the code subtracts c_prev once, but needs to subtract twice. \n\nSo how can this be fixed?\n\nLooking at the code's handling of c:\n\nThe code first checks if the key is present. \n\nIf not present, set to 0. \n\nElse, subtract the current value (which is the previous count). \n\nThen, add 2 to the c's value. \n\nWait, perhaps the variable c is storing twice the count? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the current string is the first occurrence of the exact string. \n\nThen, the code does:\n\nif not in c \u2192 set to 0. \n\nThen, since it wasn't present, the else clause is skipped. \n\nThen, c[d+e] +=2 \u2192 becomes 2. \n\nSo c now holds 2 for the first occurrence. \n\nHmm, that's strange. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using c to track the number of previous occurrences multiplied by 2? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the number of pairs that have been subtracted so far. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect and needs to be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is correct but the way it's implemented is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's c is storing the number of previous occurrences, and the subtraction is done once, but the formula requires subtracting twice. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should think of a different approach for the problem. \n\nThe problem requires counting all pairs of strings that differ in exactly one character. \n\nEach string is two characters. \n\nFor two strings s and t, they form a valid pair if exactly one of the two characters differ. \n\nSo for each pair (s, t), the count is 1 if they differ in exactly one position, else 0. \n\nThe total is the sum over all i<j of this. \n\nThe straightforward way would be to, for each string, compare it with all previous strings and count the differences. But with n up to 1e5, this would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. \n\nHence, we need a smarter approach. \n\nAn efficient way would be to group the strings by their first and second characters, and compute the counts. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each string s = (a, b), the number of strings that differ in exactly the first character is the number of strings with the same second character but different first. \n\nSimilarly, the number of strings that differ in exactly the second character is the number of strings with the same first character but different second. \n\nThe total for a pair (s, t) is 1 if they are in either of these two categories. \n\nHence, the total count can be computed as:\n\nsum over all pairs (s, t) where s and t have same first and different second \u2192 count1 \n\nplus \n\nsum over all pairs (s, t) where s and t have same second and different first \u2192 count2 \n\nminus \n\nthe pairs where both are same (since they are counted in neither count1 nor count2, but also not in the desired count). \n\nWait, no. Wait, the desired count is exactly the sum of count1 and count2. \n\nWait, count1 is the number of pairs differing in first character only (same second). \n\ncount2 is the number of pairs differing in second character only (same first). \n\nSo the total is count1 + count2. \n\nSo how to compute count1 and count2 efficiently?\n\nLet me think:\n\ncount1 is the sum over all second characters (b) of (number of strings with second character b choose 2) minus the number of pairs where both first and second are same (since those would have been counted in the same second but same first, but they don't differ in any character). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, for count1 (differ in first character only):\n\nThe number of pairs with same second character but different first is equal to (total pairs with same second) minus the pairs where both first and second are same. \n\nSimilarly for count2. \n\nAlternatively, for count1:\n\nFor each second character b, let the count of strings with second character b be C_b. \n\nThe number of pairs with same second character is C_b choose 2. \n\nBut among these, the pairs that have same first character are those where the first characters are same. \n\nSo the number of pairs with same second and different first is (C_b choose 2) minus the sum over all first characters a of (count of a and b choose 2). \n\nHence, count1 = sum over b [ (C_b choose 2) - sum_a ( (count_ab choose 2) ) ]\n\nSimilarly, count2 = sum over a [ (count_a choose 2) - sum_b ( (count_ab choose 2) ) ]\n\nThen the total is count1 + count2. \n\nBut this approach requires tracking for each a and b the count_ab (number of strings with first a and second b). \n\nThis can be done with dictionaries. \n\nLet me see:\n\nLet:\n\n- first_counts[a] = number of strings with first character a. \n\n- second_counts[b] = number of strings with second character b. \n\n- count_ab[(a,b)] = number of strings with first a and second b. \n\nThen:\n\ncount1 = sum over b of (second_counts[b] * (second_counts[b]-1)/2 ) - sum over a of (count_ab[(a,b)] * (count_ab[(a,b)]-1)/2 )\n\nSimilarly for count2. \n\nThe total is count1 + count2. \n\nThis approach would be O(26*26) per test case, which is manageable. \n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the total can be computed as:\n\nTotal = (sum over all pairs of strings that have exactly one differing character) \n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nTotal = (sum over all pairs of strings that have same first or same second) minus 2 * (number of pairs with same first and same second) \n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe pairs that have exactly one differing character are those that have either same first or same second, but not both. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the pairs that have exactly one differing character are those where either first is same and second different, or second same and first different. \n\nThe total is (number of pairs with same first) + (number with same second) - 2 * (number with same first and same second). \n\nBecause the pairs with same first and same second are counted in both the first and second terms, so we need to subtract them twice. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet A be the set of pairs with same first character. \n\nB be the set with same second. \n\nThe desired is (A - (A \u2229 B)) + (B - (A \u2229 B)) = (A + B - 2*(A \u2229 B)). \n\nYes. \n\nSo the formula is:\n\nTotal = (A + B - 2 * C), where:\n\nA is the number of pairs with same first character. \n\nB is the number with same second. \n\nC is the number with same first and same second. \n\nSo this formula can be used. \n\nThis is a much better approach. \n\nSo how to compute A, B, C?\n\nA is the sum over all a of (count_a choose 2). \n\nSimilarly, B is sum over b of (count_b choose 2). \n\nC is the sum over all (a,b) of (count_ab choose 2). \n\nThus, the total is (A + B - 2*C). \n\nThis is O(26 + 26 + 26*26) per test case, which is manageable. \n\nSo this is the correct approach. \n\nNow, looking back at the original code provided, it's trying to do something else, but perhaps it's incorrect. \n\nThe code given in program1.py is using a different approach, but it's not working. \n\nThe user's task is to fill in the missing parts in the code. \n\nThe code provided has variables a, b, c. \n\nLooking at the code again:\n\nThe code is trying to process each string and accumulate the answer incrementally. \n\nThe variables a and b are dictionaries counting the number of previous first and second characters. \n\nThe variable c is a dictionary counting the number of previous exact strings. \n\nThe code's logic is that for each new string, the contribution to the answer is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * c_prev), where c_prev is the previous count of the exact string. \n\nBecause:\n\n- a[d] is the number of previous strings with same first character. Each of those contributes to pairs where the second character differs (so they are part of the count for differing in second). \n\n- Similarly, b[e] is the number of previous with same second, contributing to differing in first. \n\n- But the pairs where both are same (exact string) are counted in both a and b, so we need to subtract them twice. \n\nThus, the contribution for the current string is (a[d] + b[e] - 2 * c_prev). \n\nThe code's approach is to add a[d] and b[e], then subtract c_prev. \n\nWait, but that would give (a[d] + b[e] - c_prev), which is not the desired formula. \n\nAh, so the code is missing a subtraction of c_prev again. \n\nHence, the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nSo the code's logic for the c part is wrong. \n\nThe code's current handling of c is:\n\nif d+e not in c:\n    c[d+e] = 0\nelse:\n    ans -= c[d+e]\nc[d+e] +=2\n\nWait, let's see what this does. \n\nSuppose the current string is the first occurrence of d+e. \n\nThen, the code sets c[d+e] to 0. \n\nThen, since it was present (no, the first condition is not present, so the else is not taken. \n\nThus, the ans is not subtracted. \n\nThen, c[d+e] becomes 0 +2 \u2192 2. \n\nWait, that's odd. \n\nThe next time the same string comes, the code will check if it's in c (yes). \n\nThen, ans -= c[d+e] (which is 2). \n\nThen, c becomes 2 +2 \u21924. \n\nHmm, this seems to be tracking something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using c to track twice the count. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the current string is the first occurrence. \n\nc_prev is 0 (since it wasn't present before). \n\nThe contribution should be a[d] (previous count of first characters) + b[e] (previous count of second) - 2 * 0 \u2192 a[d] + b[e]. \n\nBut since this is the first occurrence, a[d] and b[e] are 0 (before processing). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, when processing the first occurrence of d and e:\n\nThe a[d] is initialized to 1 (since the except block for a's KeyError sets a[d] =1). \n\nWait, let's walk through the first occurrence:\n\nProcessing the first string (d,e):\n\nFor a[d], since it's the first occurrence, the except block for a's KeyError is entered. \n\nThe code needs to set a[d] =1. \n\nThen, for b[e], similarly, the except block sets b[e] =1. \n\nThen, for the c part:\n\nd+e is not in c \u2192 set to 0. \n\nThen, since it wasn't present, the else clause is skipped. \n\nThen, c[d+e] +=2 \u2192 becomes 2. \n\nThe contribution to ans is:\n\na[d] (which is 1) added to ans (from the first try block). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the code for a[d]:\n\nIn the first case (first occurrence of d):\n\nThe try block for a[d] would fail (KeyError), so the except block is executed. \n\nIn the except block, the code should set a[d] =1. \n\nSo after that, a[d] is 1. \n\nThe code for the a part:\n\nThe try block failed, so the except block sets a[d] =1. \n\nThen, the code proceeds to the b part. \n\nSimilarly for b[e], the except block sets b[e] =1. \n\nThen, the code processes the c part. \n\nThe contribution from a[d] is 0 (since before processing, a[d] was 0, but the try block added a[d] (0) to ans? Wait, no. \n\nWait, the code for a[d]:\n\nThe code does:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d] \u2192 but a[d] is not present (KeyError), so this block is skipped. \n\nexcept KeyError:\n    a[d] =1 \n\nSo the a[d] is set to 1, but the ans is not increased by a[d] (since the try block failed). \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake. \n\nThe code's logic for a[d] is wrong. \n\nThe code is trying to add a[d] (the previous count) to ans. \n\nBut in the except block (when a[d] is not present), the previous count is 0, so ans should not be increased. \n\nBut the code's current structure for a's try block is:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d] \u2192 which would be 0 if it's the first occurrence? No, because a[d] is not present, so the KeyError occurs. \n\nWait, the code's try block for a[d] is:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d] \u2192 this line would raise KeyError if a[d] is not present. \n\nSo the code's current approach for a's part is wrong. \n\nThe correct way is:\n\nThe contribution from the first part (same first character) is the number of previous strings with the same first character. \n\nSo for each new string, the contribution from the first part is a[d] (the count before adding the current string). \n\nThus, the code should first get the current count of a[d], add it to ans, then increment a[d] by 1. \n\nBut in the code's current structure, when a[d] is not present, the try block fails, so the code doesn't add anything to ans, but then sets a[d] to 1. \n\nSo the a[d] is now 1, but the previous count was 0, so the contribution should be 0. \n\nThat part is okay. \n\nBut the problem is in the second part of the code. \n\nThe code's current approach for the contribution from the current string is:\n\nans += a[d] (previous count of first characters) \n\nans += b[e] (previous count of second characters) \n\nthen subtract c_prev (the previous count of exact string). \n\nBut the correct formula requires subtracting twice the previous count. \n\nSo the code is missing a subtraction of c_prev again. \n\nHence, the code's line where it subtracts c_prev once is insufficient. \n\nSo the code's logic for the c part is wrong. \n\nThe correct formula for the contribution is (a_prev + b_prev - 2 * c_prev). \n\nThe code currently does (a_prev + b_prev - c_prev). \n\nSo the code is under-subtracting by c_prev. \n\nHence, the code's line where it subtracts c_prev should be subtracted twice. \n\nSo the code's line:\n\nelse:\n    ans -= c[d+e]\n\nshould be ans -= 2 * c[d+e]\n\nWait, but how is c tracking the previous count? \n\nWait, the code's c is storing the previous count? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code's c is being updated as follows:\n\nInitially, for the current string, the code checks if the key is present. \n\nIf not present, set to 0. \n\nThen, if it was present (else clause), subtract c[d+e] (the previous value). \n\nThen, add 2 to c. \n\nWait, perhaps the variable c is storing twice the count. \n\nSuppose the current string is the first occurrence of the exact string. \n\nThen, the code sets c[d+e] to 0, then adds 2 \u2192 becomes 2. \n\nThe next time the same string comes, the code will see that it is present. \n\nThe previous value is 2. \n\nSo ans -= 2 (the previous value). \n\nThen, add 2 \u2192 becomes 4. \n\nSo the count stored in c is twice the actual count. \n\nSo the actual count is c[d+e] // 2. \n\nHence, the previous count (before processing this string) is (c[d+e] - 2) // 2? \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's c is storing the number of previous occurrences multiplied by 2. \n\nSo when the code subtracts c_prev (the previous value of c), it's actually subtracting twice the count. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the current string is the third occurrence of the exact string. \n\nThe previous count (before processing this string) is 2. \n\nThe c value before processing would be 2 * 2 =4 (since each occurrence adds 2). \n\nSo when processing this string:\n\nThe code checks if the key is present (yes). \n\nSo the else clause is executed: ans -= c[d+e] (4). \n\nThen, c becomes 4 +2 =6. \n\nThe previous count was 2 (exact occurrences before this string). \n\nThe formula requires subtracting 2 * 2 =4, which is exactly what the code does. \n\nAh! So the code's c is storing twice the count of the exact string. \n\nThus, the previous count is (c[d+e] // 2). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the code's c is storing twice the count. \n\nBecause each time the string is added, the code adds 2. \n\nSo for the first occurrence, c is set to 0, then +2 \u2192 2 (which is 1 * 2). \n\nSecond occurrence: \n\nThe code checks if present (yes). \n\nans -= c's current value (2). \n\nThen adds 2 \u2192 becomes 4 (2 * 2). \n\nThird occurrence: \n\nans -=4 \u2192 subtracts 4 (which is 2 * 2). \n\nThen adds 2 \u2192 6 (3 * 2). \n\nSo the value stored in c is twice the count of the exact string. \n\nThus, the previous count (before processing this string) is (c[d+e] // 2). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the previous count is (current c value before processing this string) divided by 2. \n\nBecause each occurrence adds 2. \n\nSo when processing the current string, the previous count is (c[d+e] // 2). \n\nBut in the code's logic, the code subtracts c[d+e] (the previous value of c) which is twice the count. \n\nThus, the code's subtraction of c_prev (the previous c value) is equivalent to subtracting twice the count. \n\nSo the formula (a_prev + b_prev - 2 * count) is exactly what the code is doing. \n\nBecause:\n\nThe code's contribution is:\n\nans += a_prev (from a[d] in the try block)\n\nans += b_prev (from b[e] in the try block)\n\nthen, subtract c_prev (which is twice the count of exact strings before this string). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the code subtracts c_prev (the previous c value) which is twice the count. \n\nSo the total contribution is (a_prev + b_prev) - c_prev. \n\nBut since c_prev is twice the count, this is (a_prev + b_prev) - 2 * count. \n\nWhich is exactly the desired formula. \n\nAh! So the code's logic is correct. \n\nThe confusion was because the variable c stores twice the count. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nNow, the only missing part is the code in the except block for a's KeyError. \n\nThe code for a's KeyError is currently:\n\ntry:\n    ans += a[d]\n    a[d] +=1\nexcept KeyError:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe correct code here is to set a[d] to 1. \n\nBecause when the KeyError occurs, it means there were no previous occurrences of this first character. \n\nSo the code should set a[d] =1. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\na[d] = 1 \n\nSo the first program's missing code is to set a[d] =1 in the except block for a's KeyError. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to determine if a string is perfectly balanced. \n\nThe definition is that for every substring t of s, and for any two characters u and v present in s, the difference between their frequencies in t is at most 1. \n\nThe example given shows that \"aba\" is perfectly balanced, but \"abb\" is not because the substring \"bb\" has a difference of 2 between a and b. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py has some logic but is incomplete. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code reads the input, then for each string s:\n\na = len(s)\n\nb = len(set(s))\n\nif b ==1 or a ==b:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    for i in range(1, a):\n\n        if s[i] in s[:i]:\n\n            w = (s[:i] * a)[:a]\n\n            if s == w:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            break\n\nWait, the code is trying to handle cases where all characters are the same (b==1 \u2192 yes), or all unique (a==b \u2192 yes). \n\nElse, it loops through the string's indices. \n\nThe first loop is for i from 1 to a-1. \n\nIf s[i] is in the previous characters (s[:i]), then it constructs a string w by repeating s[:i] enough times to reach length a, then takes the first a characters. \n\nIf s equals w, then it prints \"YES\", else \"NO\" (but the code breaks after the first such i). \n\nThe code's logic is unclear. \n\nThe problem requires that every substring must satisfy the condition. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be checking if the string is periodic in some way, but it's not clear. \n\nThe example given in the problem's note shows that \"aba\" is perfectly balanced. \n\nThe code's current approach may not be correct. \n\nLet me think of the conditions required for a string to be perfectly balanced. \n\nThe key is that for any substring, the frequencies of any two characters in it must not differ by more than 1. \n\nThis is a very strict condition. \n\nLet's think of what strings can satisfy this. \n\nFirst, the string can have all characters the same \u2192 yes. \n\nOr, the string can have length 1 \u2192 yes. \n\nFor length 2, any two different characters are okay, because any substring of length 1 has difference 0 or 1 (but since only one character is present, the difference between any two present characters would be zero). Wait, but the substring of length 2 has two characters. \n\nWait, for a string like \"ab\", the substring \"ab\" has frequencies a:1, b:1 \u2192 difference 0. \n\nThe substrings \"a\" and \"b\" have frequencies of 1 and 0 for the other character. But the problem states that the substring must have both characters present in the original string. \n\nWait, the problem says \"for all possible triplets (t,u,v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\". \n\nSo for a substring t, if it contains both u and v (which are present in s), then their frequencies must differ by at most 1. \n\nWait, no. The triplet is for any u and v present in s. \n\nWait, the problem says: for any triplet (t, u, v) where t is a non-empty substring of s, and u and v are characters present in s. \n\nThe condition is that the difference between the frequencies of u and v in t is not more than 1. \n\nSo even if the substring t doesn't contain one of them, the difference is the absolute value of (count_u - count_v). \n\nFor example, if the substring has no u, then count_u is 0, and count_v could be anything. \n\nBut the difference between 0 and count_v must be \u22641. \n\nSo if the substring has v appearing twice, then the difference between u (0) and v (2) is 2, which is more than 1 \u2192 the string is not balanced. \n\nThus, for any substring, for any pair of characters present in the entire string, their counts in the substring must not differ by more than 1. \n\nThis is a very strict condition. \n\nSo what strings can satisfy this? \n\nLet's think of small examples:\n\n- All characters the same: yes. \n\n- Two alternating characters, like \"abab\" \u2192 let's see. \n\nTake substring \"ab\": counts are 1 and 1 \u2192 okay. \n\nSubstring \"aba\": counts a:2, b:1 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 okay. \n\nSubstring \"abab\": counts a:2, b:2 \u2192 okay. \n\nSubstring \"b\" \u2192 counts a:0, b:1 \u2192 difference 1 (since a is present in the whole string). \n\nWait, the difference between a's count (0) and b's count (1) is 1 \u2192 okay. \n\nAnother substring like \"abab\" is okay. \n\nBut what about \"ababa\"? \n\nThe substring \"aba\" is okay. \n\nBut what about \"abab\" \u2192 same as before. \n\nHmm, maybe strings where the characters alternate between two characters, like \"ababab\" would be okay. \n\nWait, let's see a substring of length 3: \"aba\" \u2192 counts a:2, b:1 \u2192 difference 1. \n\nAnother substring \"bab\" \u2192 counts a:0, b:2 \u2192 difference between a and b is 2 \u2192 which is more than 1. \n\nAh! So that substring would violate the condition. \n\nThus, the string \"ababab\" is not perfectly balanced. \n\nSo the condition is very strict. \n\nAnother example: the string \"abc\" is perfectly balanced. \n\nBecause any substring has at most two different characters, and their counts can differ by at most 1. \n\nFor example, the substring \"ab\" has counts 1 and 1. \n\nThe substring \"a\" has counts 1 for a, and 0 for b and c. \n\nThe difference between a and b is 1 (0 vs 1?), no. \n\nWait, the difference between a and b in the substring \"a\" is 1 (since a has 1, b has 0 \u2192 difference 1). \n\nThe difference between a and c is also 1. \n\nThe difference between b and c is 1 (0 and 0 \u2192 0). \n\nSo all differences are \u22641. \n\nThus, \"abc\" is okay. \n\nAnother example: \"abba\" \u2192 the substring \"bb\" has counts a:0, b:2. \n\nThe difference between a and b is 2 \u2192 which is more than 1 \u2192 thus, the string is not balanced. \n\nSo what is the pattern here? \n\nThe string must be such that no two characters can have their counts differing by more than 1 in any substring. \n\nThis seems to require that the string is made of a single character, or has all characters appearing in a way that their counts never diverge by more than 1 in any substring. \n\nPerhaps the only possible strings are those where all characters are the same, or the string has length 2 with two different characters, or the string is of the form where the characters alternate between two characters with counts differing by at most 1. \n\nWait, but even that may not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the string must be such that every character appears at most once, or the string is of length 2 with two different characters. \n\nWait, the third example in the problem's note is \"abc\", which is length 3 with all unique characters. \n\nThe code's current approach for the case when a == b (all unique) returns \"YES\", which is correct. \n\nThe code's first condition handles that. \n\nThe other case is when the string has more than one character and not all unique. \n\nThe code's current approach is to loop through the string and check if any character repeats before its position. \n\nWhen it finds such an i (where s[i] is in s[:i]), it constructs a string w by repeating the prefix s[:i] enough times to match the length of s. \n\nIf the original string equals this repeated prefix, then it returns \"YES\", else \"NO\". \n\nThe idea might be that if the string is periodic with a period that ensures the condition holds. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check if the string is of the form where all characters are the same except for one, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nThe problem requires that for every substring, the difference between any two characters' counts is at most 1. \n\nThis is only possible if the entire string has at most two distinct characters, and their counts are balanced. \n\nWait, let's think: \n\nSuppose the string has three distinct characters. \n\nThen, any substring containing all three would require that their counts differ by at most 1. \n\nBut for example, the substring of the entire string must have counts differing by at most 1. \n\nSuppose the counts are 2, 2, 1 \u2192 the difference between the first and third is 1, which is okay. \n\nBut if the counts are 3, 1, 1 \u2192 the difference between first and second is 2 \u2192 not allowed. \n\nThus, the entire string must have all character counts differing by at most 1. \n\nBut even that is not sufficient. \n\nFor example, the string \"abac\" has counts a:2, b:1, c:1 \u2192 total counts differ by at most 1. \n\nBut the substring \"aba\" has a:2, b:1 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe substring \"bac\" has a:1, b:1, c:1 \u2192 okay. \n\nBut what about a substring like \"ab\" \u2192 okay. \n\nBut what about a substring like \"ac\" \u2192 counts a:1, c:1 \u2192 okay. \n\nHmm, maybe this string is okay. \n\nBut what about a longer string like \"abacab\"? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the only way this condition holds is if the string has at most two distinct characters, and their counts are equal or differ by 1, and they alternate. \n\nFor example, \"abab\" has counts a:2, b:2 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe substring \"ab\" is okay. \n\nThe substring \"aba\" has a:2, b:1 \u2192 difference 1. \n\nThe substring \"abab\" is okay. \n\nBut the substring \"aab\" (if it exists) would have a:2, b:1 \u2192 okay. \n\nWait, but in \"abab\", the substring \"aab\" doesn't exist. \n\nHmm, perhaps the string must be such that the characters alternate between two characters, with counts differing by at most 1. \n\nLike \"abab\" or \"ababa\". \n\nIn \"ababa\", the entire string has a:3, b:2 \u2192 counts differ by 1. \n\nThe substring \"aba\" has a:2, b:1 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe substring \"abab\" has a:2, b:2 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe substring \"ababa\" is okay. \n\nThe substring \"bab\" has a:1, b:2 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe substring \"aba\" is okay. \n\nThus, this string would be acceptable. \n\nBut what about the substring \"abab\" in \"ababa\" \u2192 okay. \n\nThus, such strings are acceptable. \n\nThe code's current approach may be trying to detect such cases. \n\nThe code's logic for the else clause (when the string has more than one character and not all unique) is to look for the first occurrence where a character repeats. \n\nThen, it constructs a string by repeating the prefix up to that point. \n\nIf the original string is equal to this repeated string, then it returns \"YES\". \n\nFor example, in the case of \"abab\", the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=1 (s[1] is 'b', which is not in s[0] (a). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, for \"abab\", the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2. \n\ns[2] is 'a', which is present in s[:2] (which is 'ab'). \n\nSo the prefix is s[:2] = 'ab'. \n\nRepeating this twice gives 'abab', which matches the original string. \n\nThus, the code would return \"YES\". \n\nAnother example: \"aba\" \u2192 the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2 (s[2] is 'a', which is in s[:2] = 'ab'). \n\nThe prefix is 'ab', repeating it to length 3 would give 'aba', which matches the original string. \n\nThus, returns \"YES\". \n\nAnother example: \"abba\" \u2192 the first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2 (s[2] is 'b', which is in s[:2] = 'ab'). \n\nThe prefix is 'ab', repeating it to length 4 gives 'abab', which is not equal to 'abba', so returns \"NO\". \n\nThis is correct because 'abba' has the substring 'bb' which has a difference of 2 between a and b. \n\nThus, the code's logic seems to work for these cases. \n\nThe code's approach is to check if the string is a repetition of a prefix up to the first duplicate character. \n\nIf so, then it returns \"YES\", else \"NO\". \n\nBut why does this work? \n\nPerhaps because such a string would alternate between the two characters, ensuring that any substring has counts differing by at most 1. \n\nThe code's logic is to find the first position where a character repeats, then check if the string is a repetition of the prefix up to that point. \n\nIf yes, then it's a valid string. \n\nOtherwise, it's not. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nThe missing part is in the else clause of the code's loop. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nelse:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\n    break\n\nThe code is inside a loop over i from 1 to a-1. \n\nWhen it finds an i where s[i] is in s[:i], it constructs w and checks if s equals w. \n\nIf yes \u2192 print \"YES\", else \u2192 the code is supposed to print \"NO\". \n\nBut the code currently has a break after the if-else. \n\nThus, the missing code is to print \"NO\" in the else case. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to add print(\"NO\") in the else clause of the inner if statement. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is in the except block for a's KeyError: set a[d] =1. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is to print \"NO\" in the else clause of the inner if statement. \n\nThus, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"a[d] = 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"print('NO')\"\n}"
