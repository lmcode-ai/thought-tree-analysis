The code is trying to precompute all possible values of substrings of length w mod 9. The indices are stored in a dictionary where the key is the mod value. For each query, it calculates the value of the current substring (v_lr) mod 9. Then, for all possible v1 and v2 (each from 0-8), it checks if (v1 * v_lr + v2) mod9 equals k. The problem is in the part where after finding valid v1 and v2 pairs, how to find the minimal L1 and L2. The current code has a placeholder for when v1 != v2.

Alternatively, the code's nx array is for the next occurrence of the same XOR. Wait, the code's d is a dictionary that for each XOR value, keeps a list of indices where that XOR occurs. The code's logic for updating nx is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The code loops over each element, and for each i (0-based in the array a), the current prefix XOR is b[i+1]. If this XOR (bx) is already in d, then the previous indices are in d[bx]. The code checks if the distance between the current index (i+1) and the last index in d[bx] is even. Wait, the distance is (i+1 - last_pos). If that distance is even, then the XOR between last_pos and current is zero (since XOR from last_pos to current is bx ^ bx =0). Wait, the XOR from last_pos+1 to current is zero. So, the length of that interval is (current - (last_pos)) which is even. So, the interval has even length. In that case, the code appends the current index to the list. Else, if the distance is odd, then the interval has odd length, so the XOR is zero. Wait, but the XOR between last_pos and current is zero only if the XOR from last_pos to current is zero. Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to track intervals where the XOR is zero. The nx array is set to the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero. Alternatively, the code's nx array is storing the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nLooking at program1.py, the problem is about processing multiple queries on a string of digits. The task is, for each query, find two substrings of length w such that when multiplied by a certain value and added, their sum mod 9 equals k_i. The solution needs to minimize L1 and then L2.\n\nThe given code has some parts filled but there's a TODO in the loop where v1 and v2 are considered. Let me think about what's missing here.\n\nThe code is trying to precompute all possible values of substrings of length w mod 9. The indices are stored in a dictionary where the key is the mod value. For each query, it calculates the value of the current substring (v_lr) mod 9. Then, for all possible v1 and v2 (each from 0-8), it checks if (v1 * v_lr + v2) mod9 equals k. \n\nThe problem is in the part where after finding valid v1 and v2 pairs, how to find the minimal L1 and L2. The current code has a placeholder for when v1 != v2. The code needs to find the earliest possible indices for L1 and L2 such that their values are v1 and v2 respectively. \n\nWait, the code is trying to loop through all possible v1 and v2, then for each valid pair, check if there are indices in the indices[v1] and indices[v2] lists. The minimal L1 would be the first occurrence in indices[v1], and then the first occurrence in indices[v2], but ensuring that the two indices are different. \n\nWait, but the problem requires L1 != L2. So when v1 == v2, we need at least two entries in the list. So for the case when v1 == v2, the code checks if the length is more than 1, then takes the first two elements. But for the case when v1 != v2, we need to pick the earliest possible L1 from indices[v1], and earliest L2 from indices[v2], but ensuring that L1 and L2 are different. \n\nThe current code's TODO is in the else block (when v1 != v2). The code needs to check if there are entries in both indices[v1] and indices[v2], then find the minimal L1 and L2. \n\nThe code is trying to compute res as the minimum between the current res and some tuple. The current code for the v1 != v2 case is incomplete. The idea is to take the first element of indices[v1] (smallest L1) and the first element of indices[v2] (smallest L2). But we have to ensure that L1 != L2. Wait, but even if they are the same, but the substrings are of length w, so their starting positions must differ by at least w? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem states that the substrings must be different, so their starting positions must be different. So L1 can't equal L2. \n\nSo for the case when v1 != v2, the minimal L1 is the first element in indices[v1], and L2 is the first in indices[v2]. But if those two are the same, then that's invalid. Wait, but since v1 and v2 are different, their indices lists are for different mod values, so their starting positions can't be the same? Or maybe they can. For example, two different substrings starting at the same position but different lengths? No, here the substrings are of length w, so their starting positions must be different. \n\nWait, the starting positions must be different. So even if v1 and v2 are different, the first elements in their lists might have the same L1 and L2? Like, if two different mod values have the same starting position? For example, a substring starting at position 2 with length w could have mod 3 and another starting at position 2 but different length? No, the length is fixed as w. So the starting positions are different only if the indices are different. \n\nWait, the indices are stored as the starting positions. So for example, if a substring starting at L has value mod v1, and another starting at L has mod v2, that's impossible because the same substring can't have two different mod values. So when v1 != v2, the indices[v1] and indices[v2] lists contain different starting positions. So the first elements of each list can be used as L1 and L2, as long as they are different. \n\nWait, but maybe the first element of indices[v1] is the same as the first of indices[v2]? That can't happen because their mod values are different. So their starting positions can be the same? No, because the mod value is different. So the starting positions must be different. \n\nTherefore, for v1 != v2, the minimal L1 is the first element of indices[v1], and L2 is the first of indices[v2]. But we have to check if both lists are non-empty. \n\nSo the code should do something like:\n\nif indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n    l1 = indices[v1][0]\n    l2 = indices[v2][0]\n    if l1 != l2:\n        res = min(res, (l1, l2))\n    else:\n        # need to pick next possible in one of the lists\n        # maybe take the next element in one of the lists\n        # but this complicates things. Wait, but the problem requires L1 != L2. So if the first elements are the same, then we need to pick the next element in one of the lists. \n\nWait, but how can the first elements be the same? Since v1 and v2 are different, the starting positions can't have the same value. Because the mod value is different. So the first elements of indices[v1] and indices[v2] must be different. \n\nWait, the starting positions are stored in the indices. For example, if two different mod values have the same starting position, that would mean that the substring starting at that position has two different mod values, which is impossible. So the first elements of indices[v1] and indices[v2] must be different. \n\nTherefore, in the case where v1 != v2, the first elements can be used. \n\nSo the code for the else block (v1 != v2) should be:\n\nif indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n    l1 = indices[v1][0]\n    l2 = indices[v2][0]\n    res = min(res, (l1, l2))\n\nWait, but the code is trying to track the minimal (L1, L2) pair. The minimal is determined first by L1 being as small as possible, then L2. So the tuple (L1, L2) is compared lexicographically. \n\nThe current code's res is initialized to INF which is (n+1, n). So for each valid pair, we can compute the candidate (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0]) and see if it's better than the current res. \n\nBut also, there might be other combinations where L1 is from indices[v1][0], and L2 is from indices[v2][1], but that would have a higher L2. So the minimal is the first elements. \n\nTherefore, the code for the v1 != v2 case should be:\n\nif indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n    candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\n    res = min(res, candidate)\n\nBut also, since the problem requires L1 != L2, but as we discussed, the candidate's L1 and L2 are different, so it's okay. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is:\n\ncandidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nBut also, perhaps there are other pairs where L1 is from indices[v1][0], and L2 is from indices[v2][1], but that would have a higher L2, so the first is better. \n\nTherefore, the code should be filled with that. \n\nNow, looking at the code structure, the loop over v1 and v2 is checking all possible pairs. For each valid (v1, v2) pair that satisfies the mod condition, the code checks if the indices have entries and then updates the res. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ncandidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nSo the code block for the else part (v1 != v2) would be:\n\nelse:\n    if len(indices[v1]) > 0 and len(indices[v2]) > 0:\n        candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\n        res = min(res, candidate)\n\nWait, but the code already has the condition \"if len(indices[v1]) >0 and len(indices[v2])>0\" as the condition for entering this block. So inside that, the code can proceed. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the part where the candidate is created and compared. \n\nSo the code in the TODO block should be:\n\ncandidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nNow, the code for program1.py is filled here. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is about processing queries on an array where each query asks for the minimal number of operations to turn a subarray into all zeros using certain operations. The operation allows selecting a subarray of odd length and replacing all elements in it with their XOR. \n\nThe given code has some pre-processing steps. Let me see what's missing. \n\nLooking at the code, the code is trying to precompute some arrays. The variables b and s are the prefix XOR and prefix sum. The nx array is next occurrence? \n\nThe code's logic for each query is as follows:\n\nIf the XOR of the subarray (from l to r) is not zero, then it's impossible (output -1). \n\nElse, if the sum is zero, then zero operations needed. \n\nElse, if the length is odd, then one operation (since you can take the entire subarray, which is odd length, and replace it with XOR (which is zero). \n\nElse (even length), check if either end is zero. If so, then one operation? Or maybe not. \n\nWait, the code's current logic for even length and sum not zero, but XOR is zero. \n\nWait, the problem requires that all elements become zero. \n\nThe code's current approach for even-length subarrays (since the length is even, the operation must be done in a way that eventually all become zero. \n\nThe code's current code for even length and when the XOR is zero (so possible) but the length is even. \n\nThe code checks if a[l-1] * a[r-1] ==0. Not sure why. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that if either end is zero, then you can do an operation on a subarray that includes that end, but I'm not sure. \n\nThe code then has a TODO when nx[l-1] <= r. \n\nThe nx array is set up in the loop. Let me see how the nx array is computed. \n\nLooking at the code's pre-processing:\n\nnx is initialized to n+5. \n\nFor each i (0-based?), the code computes b (prefix XOR) and s (prefix sum). \n\nThen, for each i, the current b value is bx = b[i+1], since b is 1-based. \n\nThen, if bx is in d (a dictionary), check if the distance between current index (i+1) and the last occurrence in d[bx] is even. \n\nWait, the code's logic for d and nx is a bit unclear. \n\nThe code's d is a dictionary where keys are the XOR values, and the values are lists of indices (1-based?) where that XOR occurs. \n\nThe code checks if the current index (i+1) minus the last occurrence in d[bx] is even. \n\nWait, the distance between the current and previous occurrence is (i+1 - last_pos). \n\nIf that distance is even, then it appends the current index to the list. \n\nElse, it updates the nx array for all previous positions in the list, and then resets the list to contain only the current index. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is trying to track possible intervals where the XOR is zero. \n\nThe nx array might be storing the next position where a certain XOR can be found. \n\nThe idea might be that for a subarray to have XOR zero, the length must be even? Or something else. \n\nThe problem requires that the subarray can be turned into all zeros. \n\nThe key insight here is that the XOR of the entire subarray must be zero (since each operation on the entire subarray (if odd length) would set all elements to the XOR of the subarray. So if the XOR is non-zero, it's impossible. \n\nHence, the first check in the code is correct: if the XOR from l to r (b[r] ^ b[l-1]) is not zero, output -1. \n\nNow, when the XOR is zero, the minimal steps depend on the length and other conditions. \n\nThe code's approach for even length (since the length is even, you can't do a single operation on the entire array (since it's even length, which is even, so R-L+1 is even, which is not odd. So you can't do that. \n\nHence, for even length, you need to split into smaller operations. \n\nThe minimal steps for even length when the XOR is zero: \n\nThe minimal steps can be 2 if possible, or 1 if some condition is met. \n\nWait, the code's current logic for even length and when the XOR is zero: \n\nIf the length is even, then the code checks if either end is zero. \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nelif (r - l +1) %2 ==0:\n\n    if a[l-1] * a[r-1] ==0:\n\n        print 1?\n\n    else:\n\n        if nx[l-1] <= r:\n\n            # TODO\n\n        else:\n\n            -1\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that when the length is even, you can split into two operations. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be 2 if there exists a position within the interval where the XOR from l to that position is zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for even length, you need to find a position where the XOR from l to some position is zero, so that you can split the array into two parts. \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array is tracking the next occurrence of the same XOR. \n\nThe code's pre-processing for nx and d is trying to track intervals where the XOR is zero. \n\nThe nx array for position x is the next position after x where the XOR from x to that position is zero. \n\nIf such a position exists within the query's l to r, then you can perform an operation on that subarray (which has odd length?), then the remaining parts can be handled. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps for even length is 2 if there exists a position between l and r where the XOR from l to that position is zero (so that the subarray can be split into two parts, each of which can be handled with one operation). \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array is storing the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero. \n\nSo, for the even-length case, if there exists a position between l and r where the XOR from l to that position is zero (so that the subarray can be split into two parts, each of which can be handled with one operation), then the minimal steps would be 2. \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array is for the next occurrence of the same XOR. \n\nWait, the code's d is a dictionary that for each XOR value, keeps a list of indices where that XOR occurs. \n\nThe code's logic for updating nx is a bit tricky. Let me think again. \n\nThe code loops over each element, and for each i (0-based in the array a), the current prefix XOR is b[i+1]. \n\nIf this XOR (bx) is already in d, then the previous indices are in d[bx]. \n\nThe code checks if the distance between the current index (i+1) and the last index in d[bx] is even. \n\nWait, the distance is (i+1 - last_pos). \n\nIf that distance is even, then the XOR between last_pos and current is zero (since XOR from last_pos to current is bx ^ bx =0). \n\nWait, the XOR from last_pos+1 to current is zero. \n\nSo, the length of that interval is (current - (last_pos)) which is even. \n\nSo, the interval has even length. \n\nIn that case, the code appends the current index to the list. \n\nElse, if the distance is odd, then the interval has odd length, so the XOR is zero. \n\nWait, but the XOR between last_pos and current is zero only if the XOR from last_pos to current is zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track intervals where the XOR is zero. \n\nThe nx array is set to the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero. \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array is storing the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero. \n\nIf such a position exists within the query's l to r, then you can perform an operation on that subarray (which has odd length?), but I'm not sure. \n\nThe problem requires that the operation's subarray has an odd length. \n\nSo, for even-length queries, the minimal steps can be 2 if there exists a position between l and r where the XOR from l to that position is zero, and the remaining part also has XOR zero. \n\nWait, since the total XOR is zero, splitting into two parts with XOR zero each would require that each part's XOR is zero. \n\nBut for even-length, splitting into two parts of even length each would not allow operations on them (since they need odd length). \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps for even length is 2 if there exists a position in between where the XOR from l to that position is zero, and the remaining part also has XOR zero. \n\nWait, the total XOR is zero, so if the first part has XOR zero, the second part must also have XOR zero. \n\nSo, if there exists a position m between l and r such that the XOR from l to m is zero, then the two parts (l to m and m+1 to r) each have XOR zero. \n\nThen, each of those parts can be handled with one operation if their lengths are odd. \n\nWait, but the length of the first part (m - l +1) must be odd, and the second part (r - m) must also be odd. \n\nThe total length is even, so m - l +1 + (r - m) = r - l +1 (even). \n\nSo, if the first part is odd, the second must be odd as well (since even minus odd is odd). \n\nWait, no. Let me see: \n\nSuppose the total length is even. \n\nIf the first part is odd, then the second part is (even - odd) = odd. \n\nSo both parts are odd. \n\nThus, each can be handled with one operation. \n\nTherefore, the total steps would be 2. \n\nSo, the condition is that there exists a position m between l and r (exclusive) such that the XOR from l to m is zero, and the length of the first part is odd. \n\nAlternatively, the position m can be any such that the XOR from l to m is zero, and the length (m - l +1) is odd. \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array is tracking the next occurrence of the same XOR. \n\nWait, the code's nx array is initialized as n+5. \n\nIn the loop, for each i (current index is i+1), when the current XOR (bx) is in d, and the previous occurrence is at some position x, then the distance between x and current is (i+1 -x). \n\nIf that distance is even, then the XOR between x and current is zero (since the XOR from x to current is bx ^ bx =0). \n\nWait, the XOR from x+1 to current is zero. \n\nThe length of that interval is (current -x) which is even. \n\nSo, the interval has even length. \n\nIn this case, the code appends the current index to the list. \n\nElse, if the distance is odd, then the interval has odd length, so the XOR is zero. \n\nWait, the XOR from x to current is bx ^ bx =0, so the interval from x+1 to current has XOR zero. \n\nThe length is (current -x) which is odd. \n\nIn this case, the code updates the nx array for all previous positions in the list. \n\nHmm, perhaps the nx array is storing the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero with an odd length. \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array is storing the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero and the length is odd. \n\nIf such a position exists within the query's l to r, then you can perform an operation on that subarray (which has odd length), which would set all elements in that subarray to zero. \n\nThen, the remaining part can be handled similarly. \n\nWait, but the problem requires all elements to be zero. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps for even length is 2 if there exists a position m between l and r where the XOR from l to m is zero and the length is odd. \n\nIn that case, you can perform an operation on l to m (odd length), which sets all elements there to zero. Then, the remaining part (m+1 to r) has even length, but since the total XOR is zero, the remaining part's XOR is also zero. \n\nWait, but the remaining part's length is (r - m), which is (even total length - (m-l+1)). Since m-l+1 is odd, the remaining is even - odd = odd. \n\nWait, no. Let me see: \n\nTotal length is even. \n\nSuppose the first part has length L (odd), then the second part has length (even - L) which is odd. \n\nSo both parts are odd. \n\nThus, each can be handled with one operation. \n\nSo, the total steps would be 2. \n\nTherefore, the condition is that there exists a position m between l and r (exclusive) such that the XOR from l to m is zero and the length (m-l+1) is odd. \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array is tracking the next occurrence where the XOR is zero with an odd length. \n\nThe code's nx array for position x is the next position after x where the XOR from x to that position is zero and the length is odd. \n\nIf such a position exists within the query's l to r, then you can perform an operation there, splitting into two parts. \n\nHence, the minimal steps would be 2. \n\nSo, in the code's TODO section, when nx[l-1] <= r, then the answer is 2. \n\nWait, the code's current code for the even case is:\n\nif a[l-1] * a[r-1] ==0:\n\n    print 1?\n\nWait, why would that be the case? \n\nSuppose the first element is zero. Then, perhaps you can do an operation on the entire array (but it's even length, so can't). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is that when the first or last element is zero, you can do an operation on a subarray that includes that element and has odd length. \n\nFor example, if the first element is zero, then you can take a subarray of length 1 (the first element), which is odd. The XOR of that subarray is zero, so replacing it with zero (no change). But that doesn't help. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic for the a[l-1] * a[r-1] ==0 is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is that if either end is zero, then you can do an operation on the entire array except the last element (which is even length?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is that when the first element is zero, you can do an operation on the first element (length 1, odd), which sets it to zero (no change), but that doesn't help. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's current approach is not correct, and the correct way is to check whether there exists a position m between l and r where the XOR from l to m is zero and the length is odd. \n\nThe nx array is supposed to track the next occurrence where this is possible. \n\nIn the code's pre-processing, for each position x (starting at l-1?), if nx[x] is within the query's r, then that means there is a position m = nx[x] where the XOR from x to m is zero and the length is odd. \n\nWait, the nx array is set as follows: \n\nWhen the current index (i+1) is part of a pair where the distance from previous occurrence is even, then the code appends to the list. \n\nElse, for the previous positions in the list, their nx is set to current index (i+1). \n\nWait, perhaps the nx array for position x is the next position after x where the XOR from x to that position is zero and the length is odd. \n\nThus, if nx[l-1] <= r, then there exists such a position m between l-1 and r. \n\nWait, the query's l is 1-based. \n\nSuppose the query is l to r. \n\nThe starting position is l-1 (since the prefix arrays are 1-based). \n\nIf nx[l-1] is <= r, then there exists a position m = nx[l-1], such that the XOR from l-1 to m is zero, and the length (m - (l-1)) is odd. \n\nThe length is (m - (l-1)), which is the length of the subarray from l to m (since l-1 is the previous position). \n\nWait, the subarray from l to m would have length m - l +1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the XOR from l to m is the same as the XOR from l-1 to m XOR the value at l-1. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, the code's nx array for position x is the next position where the XOR from x to that position is zero and the length is odd. \n\nIf such a position exists within the query's l to r, then the minimal steps would be 2. \n\nHence, in the code's TODO section, when nx[l-1] <= r, then the answer is 2. \n\nOtherwise, it's impossible (so output -1). \n\nWait, but what if there are multiple such positions? \n\nThe minimal steps would be 2 in that case. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nsys.stdout.write(\"2\\n\")\n\nHence, the code for the TODO block is:\n\nsys.stdout.write(\"2\\n\")\n\nSo the code in program2.py's TODO is filled with that. \n\nPutting it all together, the missing code for program1.py is the candidate assignment and min comparison in the v1 != v2 case. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is outputting 2 when nx[l-1] <= r. \n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nIn the TODO block:\n\ncandidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nIn the TODO block:\n\nsys.stdout.write(\"2\\n\")\n\nNow, formatting the JSON as required."
