Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum from index i to the end. Wait, let me structure it properly. Let's say the array is 0-based. prefix_max array where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0.. i]. Similarly, prefix_min[i] is the minimum of a[0..i]. Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1], and suffix_min[i] is the minimum of a[i..n-1].

Similarly, the min of the outside is the minimum between prefix_min[l-1] and suffix_min[r+1]. Wait, but if the subsegment starts at l=0, then the outside before is nothing, so the outside is just the suffix after r. Similarly, if the subsegment ends at r = n-1, then the outside is the prefix up to l-1. So for any l and r, the outside_max is the maximum of (prefix_max[l-1] if l>0 else -infinity) and (suffix_max[r+1] if r < n-1 else -infinity). But actually, if the subsegment is the entire array, it's not allowed (since it's a proper subsegment). So we have to ensure that the subsegment is not the entire array. Wait the problem says proper subsegment, so r - l +1 < n. So l can be 0 and r can be n-1 only if the length is less than n, which is impossible. So the subsegment can't be the entire array. So for any l and r, either l>0 or r < n-1 (or both). So for the outside_max, when l is 0, then the outside is the suffix after r. So the max is suffix_max[r+1].",

The global difference is 4. The proper subsegments are: [1], [5], [3], [1,5], [5,3], [1,5,3] is not allowed. The max_sub - min_sub for [1,5] is 4, which is the same as the global difference.

Wait in this example, the approach would give 4+4=8, but the actual maximum beauty would be 4 (from the subsegment [1,5], which gives outside's difference 0, and inside's difference 4 \u2192 total 4). Hmm, so the approach is wrong here. So my previous reasoning is flawed. Hmm, so this approach is incorrect. Hmm, so I need to think differently. Alternative Idea: \n\nThe beauty is (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). We can split this into two terms. The first term is the difference between the max and min of the elements not in the subsegment. The second term is the difference between the max and min of the subsegment.

But in this case, perhaps the global_max is at the end, so case6 is not possible. Thus, the maximum would be 9. This approach would work. Now, the second sample's note: \n\nThe optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based), which is indices 1-3 (0-based). The array's global_max is 200, global_min is 2. The outside includes elements before 1 and after 3. The outside's max is 100 (assuming the first element is 100?), and min is 2. So outside difference is 98. The inside's max is 200, min is 1. Inside difference is 199. Total is 98+199=297, which matches the sample. In this case, the global_max is in the subsegment, and the global_min is also in the outside. Thus, the outside's difference is global_max - global_min (200-2=198?), but in the example, the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. Wait, perhaps the global_max is 200 and global_min is 2. The outside includes the first element (100) and the elements after r=4 (assuming the array has elements like [2, 100, 3, 200, 1, ... ]). The outside's max is max(2, 100, ...) which is 100. The outside's min is 2. Thus, the outside's difference is 98. The inside's max is 200, min is 1. Total is 98+199=297. In this case, the maximum candidate would be case3 (excluding the global_min's position). Excluding the global_min (position0), the outside includes it, so the outside's difference is 200-2=198. The inside's max is 200, min is 1. Thus, the candidate would be 198 + (200-1) = 198+199=397, which is higher than the actual answer. Hmm, this suggests a problem with the approach. Wait, what's the inside's max and min when excluding the global_min's position (position0). The subsegment is the entire array except position0. The inside includes the global_max (200) and the global_min is excluded. The inside's min would be the minimum of the array excluding position0. If the array has elements like [2, 100, 3, 200, 1, ...], then excluding position0 (2), the min would be 1. Thus, the inside's difference is 200-1=199. The outside's difference is global_max - global_min (200-2=198). Total is 198+199=397, which is higher than the sample's answer. But the sample's answer is 297. This suggests that the approach is incorrect. Hmm, this is a problem. What's wrong here? Ah, because the subsegment excluding the global_min's position is a proper subsegment. In this case, the subsegment is the entire array except the first element. The length is n-1, which is proper. Thus, the candidate for case4 (exclude global_min) would be 198+199=397, which is higher than the sample's answer. But the sample's answer is 297. This suggests that the approach is incorrect. Hmm, this indicates that the approach is not correct. What's the issue here? The sample's second case's optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based), which is indices 1-3 (0-based). The outside includes the first element (100) and the elements after 3 (like 1 and others). The outside's max is 100, min is 2 (if the first element is 100 and the global_min is 2 at position0). Thus, the outside's difference is 98. The inside's max is 200, min is 1. Total is 297. But according to the approach, there is a better candidate of 397. This suggests that the approach is wrong. So what's wrong with the approach?",

To compute this efficiently, perhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. Thus, we can compute the beauty for all n possible single-element exclusions and take the maximum. This would be O(n) per test case. Let's see: \n\nFor each element i in 0..n-1:\n\nThe subsegment is the array excluding i. The outside is just the element a[i]. Thus, outside_max and min are a[i]. The outside's difference is 0.

But considering all possible single-element exclusions might give the correct answer. In the first sample's case, excluding the global_max's position (6) gives max_without_i =5, min_without_i=1 \u2192 difference 4. The beauty is 4. But the optimal case is when excluding a subsegment of two elements (like the last two), which gives a higher beauty. Thus, this approach would also miss the correct answer. Hmm. This is really challenging. Perhaps I should look for hints or think of the problem differently. The beauty is (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). The outside is the complement of the subsegment. The outside_max is the maximum of the elements not in the subsegment. The inside_max is the maximum of the subsegment. Thus, the total max contribution from the max terms is (outside_max + inside_max) - (outside_min + inside_min). To maximize this, we want to maximize (outside_max + inside_max) and minimize (outside_min + inside_min).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment of an array. The beauty is calculated as the difference between the max and min of the elements outside the subsegment plus the difference between the max and min of the subsegment itself. Hmm, so the key here is to efficiently compute these values for all possible subsegments without iterating every possible l and r, which would be O(n^2) and too slow for n up to 1e5.\n\nWait, the constraints say n can be up to 1e5 and the sum of all n's is 1e5. So an O(n) or O(n log n) approach is needed. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe beauty formula can be broken down into two parts: the outside part (max - min of the array excluding the subsegment) and the inside part (max - min of the subsegment). To maximize the total, we need to find the best combination of these two.\n\nBut calculating the max and min of the outside for every possible subsegment is tricky. Maybe precompute some prefix and suffix arrays?\n\nAlternatively, notice that the outside's max and min are the overall max and min of the entire array except the subsegment. Wait, no. The outside is all elements except the subsegment from l to r. So the outside's max is the maximum between the elements before l and after r. Similarly for the min. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum possible outside max is the global max of the entire array except the subsegment. Wait, but if the subsegment doesn't include the global max, then the outside's max would still be the global max. So maybe the outside's max is the global max of the entire array except the subsegment. Wait, but that's not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, the outside's max is the maximum of the entire array except the subsegment. To compute that efficiently, perhaps precompute prefix max and min arrays, and suffix max and min arrays. Then for any subsegment l to r, the outside's max is the max of the prefix up to l-1 and the suffix from r+1. Similarly for the min. \n\nYes, that's a good idea. Let's think:\n\nWe can precompute for each position the prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nprefix_max[i] is the maximum from a[0] to a[i], but maybe better to have prefix_max[i] as the maximum up to index i (assuming 0-based). Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum from index i to the end. \n\nWait, let me structure it properly. Let's say the array is 0-based. \n\nprefix_max array where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i]. Similarly, prefix_min[i] is the minimum of a[0..i]. \n\nSimilarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1], and suffix_min[i] is the minimum of a[i..n-1].\n\nThen, for a subsegment from l to r (0-based, inclusive), the outside elements are the elements before l and after r. \n\nThe max of the outside would be the maximum between the prefix_max[l-1] (if l>0) and the suffix_max[r+1] (if r < n-1). Similarly, the min of the outside is the minimum between prefix_min[l-1] and suffix_min[r+1]. \n\nWait, but if the subsegment starts at l=0, then the outside before is nothing, so the outside is just the suffix after r. Similarly, if the subsegment ends at r = n-1, then the outside is the prefix up to l-1. \n\nSo for any l and r, the outside_max is the maximum of (prefix_max[l-1] if l>0 else -infinity) and (suffix_max[r+1] if r < n-1 else -infinity). But actually, if the subsegment is the entire array, it's not allowed (since it's a proper subsegment). So we have to ensure that the subsegment is not the entire array. \n\nWait the problem says proper subsegment, so r - l +1 < n. So l can be 0 and r can be n-1 only if the length is less than n, which is impossible. So the subsegment can't be the entire array. So for any l and r, either l>0 or r < n-1 (or both). \n\nSo for the outside_max, when l is 0, then the outside is the suffix after r. So the max is suffix_max[r+1]. Similarly, if r is n-1, the outside is the prefix up to l-1. \n\nSo combining these, the outside_max is the maximum between the prefix_max up to l-1 and the suffix_max starting at r+1. \n\nSimilarly for the outside_min. \n\nSo the outside_max can be computed as:\n\nif l ==0:\n    outside_max_part = suffix_max[r+1]\nelif r == n-1:\n    outside_max_part = prefix_max[l-1]\nelse:\n    outside_max_part = max(prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1])\n\nSame for outside_min. \n\nBut to compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nNow, the inside part is the max and min of the subsegment a[l..r]. To compute that quickly, we can precompute for all possible intervals their max and min. But that's O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, so that's a problem. How else can we compute the max and min of a subarray quickly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible beauty is the global maximum minus the global minimum of the entire array, plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) of some subsegment. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because when you exclude a subsegment, the outside's max and min could be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub), but only if the subsegment doesn't include the global max or min. Wait, but that might not hold. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. Because if the subsegment is chosen such that the outside's max and min are the global ones, then the outside part is fixed. But the inside part can be as big as possible. \n\nWait, but the outside's max and min could be different. For example, if the subsegment includes the global max, then the outside's max would be the next highest. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe beauty is (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nTo maximize this, perhaps the best scenario is when the outside_max is as large as possible, outside_min as small as possible, and the inside_max as large as possible, inside_min as small as possible. \n\nBut how to find such a combination?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible value of (outside_max - outside_min) is the global_max - global_min of the entire array. But that can only be achieved if the subsegment doesn't include either the global max or the global min. \n\nWait, if the subsegment excludes the global max and the global min, then the outside would still have both, so their difference remains the same. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment includes the global max, then the outside's max would be the next maximum. So the outside_max - outside_min would be smaller than the global difference. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum possible (outside_max - outside_min) is the global difference, but only achievable when the subsegment doesn't include either the global max or min. \n\nBut then the inside's (max - min) can be as big as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. But that would be the case only if the subsegment is chosen such that the outside's max and min are the global ones. \n\nWait, but the subsegment can't be the entire array, so if the subsegment is the entire array except one element, then the outside would be that one element. So in that case, the outside's max and min would be that element. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the global_max - global_min plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any possible subsegment. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. Because when you choose a subsegment that doesn't include the global max or min, then the outside's difference is global, and the inside's difference can be as big as possible. \n\nWait, but the inside's difference can be up to (max_sub - min_sub). So adding those two terms would give the total. \n\nBut how do we ensure that the subsegment is a proper one? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. Because when you choose a subsegment that doesn't include the global max or min, then the outside's difference is global, and the inside's difference is as big as possible. \n\nBut how do we compute the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all subsegments? \n\nWait, the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for a subsegment is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum of that subsegment. The maximum possible of this over all subsegments is the difference between the global max and global min of the entire array. But that would be achieved when the subsegment is the entire array. But since it's a proper subsegment, we can't take the entire array. \n\nHmm, so the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for a proper subsegment would be the global difference of the array minus some small value, but maybe it's still possible to have the same as the global difference if the subsegment excludes some elements that are not the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for a proper subsegment is the same as the global difference. For example, if the array has elements [1, 3, 2], then the entire array's difference is 2. A proper subsegment like [1,3] has difference 2. \n\nSo in that case, the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) can be the same as the global difference. \n\nTherefore, the maximum beauty would be (global difference) + (global difference) = 2*(global difference). \n\nWait, but in the first sample input given in the problem:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSample Input 1's first case: \n\nSuppose the array is such that when choosing l=7 and r=8 (assuming 1-based), the outside's max - min is 6-1=5, and the inside's is 5-1=4, totaling 9. \n\nWait, the problem's note says that the first test case's optimal gives (6-1)+(5-1)=9. So the outside's max is 6, min is 1, and the inside's max is 5, min is 1. \n\nHmm, so the outside's max and min are not the global ones. So perhaps the approach of adding the global difference and the sub's difference isn't correct. \n\nHmm, so maybe the maximum beauty can be higher than 2*(global difference). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we need to find for each possible subsegment the four values (outside_max, outside_min, inside_max, inside_min). \n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nThen, for any subsegment l to r (0-based), the outside_max is the maximum between the prefix_max up to l-1 and the suffix_max starting at r+1. Similarly for outside_min. \n\nThe inside_max is the maximum of a[l..r], and inside_min is the minimum of a[l..r]. \n\nBut how to compute the inside_max and inside_min for all possible l and r efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that for each possible l and r, we need the max and min of the subarray from l to r. \n\nThis is a classic problem. The standard approach for range max/min queries is to use a segment tree or a sparse table for O(1) or O(log n) per query. But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e3, but the sum of n is 1e5, perhaps we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum in all possible intervals. But that's O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the maximum beauty can be obtained in certain specific cases, so we don't need to check all possible subsegments. \n\nLet me think of possible candidates for the maximum beauty. \n\nThe beauty is (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nTo maximize this, we need to maximize both terms. \n\nThe outside_max - outside_min is maximized when the outside has a large max and small min. \n\nThe inside_max - inside_min is maximized when the inside has a large max and small min. \n\nPerhaps the best scenario is when the outside's max and min are as far apart as possible, and the inside's max and min are also as far apart as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the subsegment is from 0 to n-2 (so excluding the last element). Then the outside is the last element. So outside_max and min are the last element. So outside_max - outside_min is 0. The inside's max and min would be the max and min of the first n-1 elements. So the total is (max_first_n-1 - min_first_n-1) + (max_inside - min_inside) which is the same as the inside's difference. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is from 1 to n-1 (excluding the first element), then the outside is the first element. So outside's difference is 0 again. \n\nHmm, so that's not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: the maximum possible beauty is the global_max - global_min plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. But how?\n\nWait, if the subsegment is chosen such that the outside includes both the global max and min, then the outside's difference is global_max - global_min. The inside's difference can be as big as possible. \n\nSo the total would be (global difference) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this over all possible subsegments (that don't include the entire array) would be the desired maximum. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all proper subsegments, then adding the global difference. \n\nWait, but is that always possible? \n\nSuppose the subsegment is a proper subsegment that doesn't include the global max or the global min. Then the outside includes both, so the outside difference is global. The inside's difference can be anything. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment includes the global max but not the global min, then the outside's max is still global, but the min could be lower. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is indeed (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any proper subsegment. \n\nWait, but in the first sample input's example, the outside's difference is 6-1=5, which is less than the global difference. The global difference must be higher. \n\nWait the first sample's note says the outside's part is 6-1, so the outside's max is 6 and min is 1. The inside's part is 5-1. So total is 5+4=9. \n\nSuppose the global max of the entire array is 6, and the global min is 1. Then the global difference is 5. The inside's difference is 4. So total is 5+4=9. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nSo in this case, the outside's difference is the global difference. So the total is indeed (global difference) + (inside's difference). \n\nSo if the subsegment is chosen such that the outside includes the global max and min, then the outside's difference is global. So the total is global + (inside's difference). \n\nHence, the maximum beauty would be the global difference plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) of any proper subsegment. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to two parts:\n\n1. Compute the global_max and global_min of the entire array. \n\n2. Find the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all proper subsegments. \n\nThen the answer is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub_diff). \n\nWait, but is this always the case? Let me think of another example. \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 3, 2, 4]. The global max is 4, min is 1. The global difference is 3. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is [3,2]. The outside includes 1 and 4. So outside difference is 3. The inside's max is 3, min is 2. So total is 3 +1 =4. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is [3,2,4], then the outside is [1]. The outside difference is 0. The inside's difference is 4-2=2. Total is 2. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is [1,3], then the outside includes 2 and 4. The outside's max is 4, min is 2. So difference is 2. The inside's difference is 3-1=2. Total is 4. \n\nHmm, but the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) for a proper subsegment could be 3 (like the subsegment [3,4], but that's not possible since the array is [1,3,2,4]. The subsegment [3,2,4] has max 4, min 2 \u2192 difference 2. The subsegment [3,4] would be indices 1-3 (assuming 0-based?), but the array is 0-based [1,3,2,4]. So indices 1-3 would be [3,2,4], which has difference 2. \n\nThe maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for proper subsegments would be 3 (from the subsegment [1,3,2,4] is not allowed, but the subsegment [1,3,2] has max 3, min 1 \u2192 difference 2. Wait, maybe the subsegment [3,4] (indices 1 and 3?), but that's not contiguous. So the maximum is 3 (from [1,3,2,4] is not allowed, but perhaps the subsegment [3,2,4] gives 2, and the subsegment [1,3] gives 2. \n\nHmm, so the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) is 3? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is 3 in some other case. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for proper subsegments is the same as the global difference. But since the entire array is not allowed, then the maximum would be the global difference only if there exists a proper subsegment that has the same max and min as the entire array. \n\nIn the first sample, the entire array's global difference is 5 (6-1). The subsegment chosen has an inside difference of 4 (5-1). So the total is 5+4=9. \n\nIf there exists a proper subsegment with max 6 and min 1, then the inside difference would be 5, leading to total 10. \n\nBut in the first sample's case, perhaps the entire array's global max is 6 and min is 1. So a proper subsegment that includes both 6 and 1 would have the same difference. \n\nWait, but the first sample's note says the optimal subsegment is l=7 and r=8 (assuming 1-based). So the subsegment is the last two elements. The inside's min is 1 and max is 5. So the inside difference is 4. The outside includes the first elements, which have a max of 6 and min of 1. \n\nAh, so in that case, the outside includes the global max and min, so their difference is 5. The inside's difference is 4. \n\nSo the total is 5+4=9. \n\nIf there was a subsegment that includes the global max and min, then the outside would exclude them, so their difference would be smaller. \n\nSo the approach of taking the global difference plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any proper subsegment would work only if the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) can be achieved in a subsegment that doesn't include both the global max and min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is indeed the global difference plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) of any proper subsegment. \n\nSo the problem reduces to two steps:\n\n1. Compute the global_max and global_min of the array. \n\n2. Find the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all proper subsegments. \n\nThen the answer is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub_diff). \n\nWait, but what if the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) is achieved in a subsegment that includes the global max or min? \n\nFor example, suppose the array is [1,5,3]. The global max is 5, min is 1. The global difference is 4. \n\nThe proper subsegments are:\n\n[1], [5], [3], [1,5], [5,3], [1,5,3] is not allowed. \n\nThe max_sub - min_sub for [1,5] is 4, which is the same as the global difference. \n\nSo the total would be 4 +4 =8. \n\nBut the outside when choosing [1,5] as the subsegment would be the element 3. So outside's difference is 3-3=0. So the total would be 0 +4=4. \n\nWait, that's a problem. \n\nWait in this example, the approach would give 4+4=8, but the actual maximum beauty would be 4 (from the subsegment [1,5], which gives outside's difference 0, and inside's difference 4 \u2192 total 4). \n\nHmm, so the approach is wrong here. \n\nSo my previous reasoning is flawed. \n\nHmm, so this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I need to think differently. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe beauty is (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nWe can split this into two terms. \n\nThe first term is the difference between the max and min of the elements not in the subsegment. \n\nThe second term is the difference between the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nTo maximize the sum, we need to maximize both terms. \n\nPerhaps the maximum occurs when the outside's max and min are as far apart as possible, and the inside's max and min are also as far apart as possible. \n\nBut how to find such a subsegment? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any proper subsegment, but only when the subsegment does not include both the global max and min. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty can be the maximum of (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min) for all possible proper subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute prefix and suffix arrays for max and min, and then for each possible l and r, compute the outside's max and min quickly, and the inside's max and min quickly. \n\nBut how to compute the inside's max and min quickly for all possible l and r? \n\nThe problem is that for each possible l and r, we need the max and min of the subarray from l to r. \n\nThis is a classic range query problem. \n\nThe standard approach for this is to precompute a sparse table for range max and min queries, which allows O(1) per query after O(n log n) preprocessing. \n\nGiven that n is up to 1e5, and for each test case, we need to process O(n^2) queries, which is impossible. \n\nWait, but the sum of n across all test cases is 1e5. So if for each test case, we can process it in O(n) time, that would be acceptable. \n\nHmm, but how?\n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be obtained in one of the following cases:\n\n1. The subsegment is the first k elements (excluding the last element). \n\n2. The subsegment is the last k elements (excluding the first element). \n\n3. The subsegment excludes the first element and some elements in the middle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except the first element, or except the last element, or except the first and last. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment that doesn't include both global max and min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array except first element minus min of that) plus (max of first element minus min of first element?), no, not sure. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe beauty is (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nThe outside is everything except the subsegment. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is from l to r. \n\nThe outside_max is the maximum of the elements before l and after r. \n\nThe outside_min is the minimum of those elements. \n\nThe inside_max is the maximum of the subsegment. \n\nThe inside_min is the minimum of the subsegment. \n\nTo compute this for all possible l and r efficiently, perhaps we can precompute prefix and suffix arrays for max and min, and also precompute for each position the maximum and minimum in the entire array except that position. \n\nWait, but even that might not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the outside_max as the maximum between the prefix_max up to l-1 and the suffix_max from r+1. \n\nSimilarly for outside_min. \n\nThe inside_max is the maximum between l and r. \n\nThe inside_min is the minimum between l and r. \n\nSo, to compute this for all possible l and r, we can precompute the prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nThen, for the inside_max and inside_min, we can use a range maximum and minimum query structure. \n\nThe sparse table approach for range max and min would allow us to compute the max and min of any interval in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing. \n\nThis way, for each possible l and r, we can compute the four values needed in O(1) time, and then compute the beauty. \n\nThe problem is that iterating over all possible l and r would be O(n^2), which is way too slow for n=1e5. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty can be obtained by considering certain critical points, such as the positions of the global max and min. \n\nFor example, the best subsegment might be the one that excludes the global max, so that the outside's max is the next highest, but then the inside's max could be the global max. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - some_min) + (some_max - some_min_sub). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array except the first element minus min of that) plus (max of first element minus min of first element?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the maximum possible value of (outside_max - outside_min). \n\nThe maximum possible value of this term is the global_max - global_min of the entire array, but only if the subsegment doesn't include either the global max or the global min. \n\nSo to get this term as large as possible, the subsegment must exclude at least one of them. \n\nThen, the inside's term (inside_max - inside_min) can be as large as possible. \n\nSo the total would be (global difference) + (inside's difference). \n\nTo maximize this, we need the inside's difference to be as large as possible. \n\nThe inside's difference can be up to the global difference of the entire array (if the subsegment includes both global max and min). \n\nWait, but if the subsegment includes both, then the outside's difference would be smaller. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment that excludes at least one of the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum of (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min) for all possible proper subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can find that the maximum occurs when the subsegment is either the first n-1 elements, the last n-1 elements, or some other specific cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for the subsegment excluding the first element.\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for the subsegment excluding the last element.\n\n- (max of the first n-1 elements minus min of first n-1) + (max of last element minus min of last element) \u2192 but that's not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following four possibilities:\n\n1. Exclude the first element \u2192 the outside is just the first element. So outside_max and min are a[0]. The inside is the rest. \n\nThe beauty would be 0 + (max of the rest - min of the rest). \n\n2. Exclude the last element \u2192 similar to 1. \n\n3. Exclude the first and last elements \u2192 outside is those two elements. \n\nThe outside's max and min are a[0] and a[-1], so their difference is |a[0] - a[-1]|. \n\nThe inside is the middle part. \n\n4. The subsegment is the entire array except the global max \u2192 then the outside's max is the next highest, but this might not be easy to compute. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nSo there are 2n possible such subsegments (excluding each element individually). \n\nWait, but a proper subsegment can exclude any single element, but also more. \n\nBut considering all possible single-element exclusions might give us the maximum. \n\nLet me think: \n\nSuppose we consider all possible subsegments that exclude exactly one element. \n\nFor each element i (from 0 to n-1), the subsegment is the array excluding a[i]. \n\nThe outside is just the element a[i], so outside_max and min are a[i]. So the outside's difference is 0. \n\nThe inside's difference is the max and min of the entire array except a[i]. \n\nSo the beauty would be 0 + (max_sub - min_sub), where max_sub and min_sub are the max and min of the array excluding a[i]. \n\nThe maximum among all these would be the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all possible single-element exclusions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between this and other cases where the subsegment excludes more elements. \n\nBut maybe the maximum occurs when excluding a single element. \n\nFor example, in the first sample's case, the optimal subsegment excludes more than one element (since l=7 and r=8 in 1-based, so the subsegment is the last two elements, so excluding the first 6 elements and the last two? Wait no, the subsegment is from 7 to 8, so the outside includes the first 6 elements and the elements after 8 (if any). \n\nWait the first sample's note says the outside's max is 6 and min is 1. So the outside includes elements before l=7 (assuming 1-based) and after r=8. \n\nSo the outside includes elements up to 6 and after 8. \n\nHmm, but in any case, perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved when the subsegment excludes a single element. \n\nIf that's the case, then we can compute for each element i, the max and min of the array excluding i, then compute (max - min) for each, and take the maximum of those. \n\nThen the beauty would be that value. \n\nWait but in the first sample's case, the optimal subsegment excludes more than one element. \n\nWait the first sample's note says the outside's difference is 5 (6-1), which is the global difference. So the subsegment must exclude neither the global max nor the global min. \n\nSo the outside includes both, so the outside's difference is global. \n\nThe inside's difference is 4 (5-1). \n\nSo the total is 5+4=9. \n\nIf the subsegment excludes a single element that is not the global max or min, then the outside's difference would still be global. \n\nFor example, if the subsegment excludes an element that is not the global max or min, then the outside includes both, so the outside's difference is global. \n\nThe inside's difference could be up to the global difference of the entire array (if the subsegment includes both global max and min). \n\nSo in that case, the total would be global + (global difference) \u2192 2*(global difference). \n\nWhich would be better than excluding a single element. \n\nAh, so this suggests that the maximum beauty could be 2*(global difference) if there exists a subsegment that excludes one element (not the global max or min) and includes both global max and min. \n\nIn that case, the inside's difference would be global difference, so total is 2*global difference. \n\nSo perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- 2*(global difference) (if such a subsegment exists)\n\n- the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment excluding one element (which gives (max_sub - min_sub) as the inside's difference, and outside's difference 0)\n\n- other cases where the outside's difference is large but not global. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays for max and min, and then for each possible l and r, compute the outside's max and min quickly, and the inside's max and min using a sparse table. \n\nBut even with that, iterating over all l and r is O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be obtained by considering the following cases:\n\n1. The subsegment is the entire array except the first element. \n\n2. The subsegment is the entire array except the last element. \n\n3. The subsegment is the entire array except the first and last elements. \n\n4. The subsegment is the first n-1 elements. \n\n5. The subsegment is the last n-1 elements. \n\n6. The subsegment is the first k elements for some k. \n\n7. The subsegment is the last k elements for some k. \n\n8. The subsegment excludes the global max. \n\n9. The subsegment excludes the global min. \n\n10. The subsegment excludes both the global max and min. \n\nBut even this might not cover all cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for the subsegment that excludes the first element. \n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for the subsegment that excludes the last element. \n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for the subsegment that excludes the global max. \n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for the subsegment that excludes the global min. \n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for the subsegment that excludes both global max and min. \n\nBut how to compute these efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment that doesn't include both global max and min. \n\n- the maximum (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min) for subsegments that include both global max and min. \n\nBut this is still vague. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the beauty formula again:\n\nBeauty = (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nThe outside is everything except the subsegment. \n\nThe inside is the subsegment. \n\nNotice that the entire array's max and min are either in the outside or the inside. \n\nSo the outside_max is either the global_max (if the subsegment doesn't include it) or the max of the outside elements (which is less than global_max). \n\nSimilarly for the outside_min. \n\nThe inside_max is either the global_max (if the subsegment includes it) or less. \n\nThe inside_min is either the global_min (if the subsegment includes it) or higher. \n\nTo maximize the beauty, we want to maximize both terms. \n\nThe best case is when the outside includes both global_max and global_min, so their difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside also includes both, so their difference is also global_max - global_min. \n\nBut this would require the subsegment to exclude neither, which is impossible because the subsegment is a proper subsegment. \n\nWait, no. If the subsegment includes both global_max and global_min, then the outside can still include them if the subsegment is not the entire array. \n\nWait, for example, if the subsegment is the entire array except one element that is neither the global_max nor global_min. Then the outside includes that one element, but the inside includes both global_max and global_min. \n\nIn this case, the outside's max and min are the global_max and global_min (since the excluded element is not them). \n\nSo the outside's difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside's difference is also global_max - global_min (since it includes both). \n\nSo the total would be 2*(global difference). \n\nThis is the maximum possible beauty. \n\nSo if such a subsegment exists, then the answer is 2*(global difference). \n\nOtherwise, the maximum is less. \n\nSo the question is: does there exist a proper subsegment that includes both global_max and global_min and excludes at least one other element? \n\nYes, as long as the array has at least three elements. \n\nWait the problem states n >=4. So yes. \n\nSo the maximum possible beauty is 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nBut wait, in the first sample's case, the global difference is 5 (6-1). So 2*5=10. But the sample's answer is 9. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. \n\nWait the first sample's note says the optimal subsegment gives 9, which is less than 10. \n\nSo why is that? \n\nAh, perhaps in that case, the global_max and global_min are both in the subsegment, but the outside also includes other elements which have a lower max or higher min. \n\nWait let me think of the first sample's array. \n\nSuppose the array has elements such that the global_max is 6 and global_min is 1. \n\nThe subsegment chosen excludes some elements that are not the global max or min. \n\nThe outside includes those elements, but also includes the global max and min. \n\nWait, the outside's max and min are 6 and 1, so their difference is 5. \n\nThe inside's max and min are 5 and 1, so their difference is 4. \n\nTotal is 5+4=9. \n\nAh, so the inside's difference is not the global difference. \n\nSo the inside's max is 5, which is less than the global max of 6. \n\nSo the subsegment does not include the global max. \n\nAh, so in this case, the subsegment excludes the global max. \n\nSo the outside includes the global max, but the inside does not. \n\nThus, the outside's difference is global_max - global_min (6-1=5), but the inside's difference is (5-1)=4. \n\nSo the total is 9. \n\nSo the maximum possible beauty of 10 would require a subsegment that includes both global max and min, and excludes at least one other element. \n\nIn that case, the outside would have to exclude neither, so the outside's difference is global. \n\nThe inside's difference would also be global. \n\nSo the total would be 10. \n\nBut why isn't that possible in the first sample? \n\nPerhaps the first sample's array has the global max at position 6 (assuming 1-based), and the subsegment chosen excludes it. \n\nSo to achieve 10, there must be a subsegment that includes both global max and min and excludes another element. \n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 4, 5, 1], then the global max is 6 and min is 1. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is the entire array except the last element (1). \n\nThe outside is just the last element (1). \n\nThe inside includes the global max and min. \n\nThe outside's difference is 0 (since it's just 1). \n\nThe inside's difference is 6-1=5. \n\nTotal is 5. \n\nNot good. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment excludes the element 2 (which is not global max or min), then the outside includes 2, but also includes the global max and min. \n\nThe inside includes both global max and min. \n\nThe outside's difference is 6-1=5. \n\nThe inside's difference is also 5. \n\nTotal is 10. \n\nSo in this case, it's possible. \n\nSo why in the first sample it's not possible? \n\nPerhaps the first sample's array is such that any subsegment that includes both global max and min must exclude an element that is either the global max or min. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first sample's array has the global max and min positioned such that any subsegment including both must be the entire array. \n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], then the global max is 6 and min is 1. \n\nThe subsegment from 0 to 5 (assuming 0-based) would exclude the last element (1). \n\nThe inside includes both global max and min (the first element is 1). \n\nThe outside is the last element (1). \n\nThe outside's difference is 0. \n\nThe inside's difference is 6-1=5. \n\nTotal is 5. \n\nNot good. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first sample's array is such that the global max and min are at the ends. \n\nFor example, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]. \n\nGlobal max is 7, min is 1. \n\nThe subsegment from 1 to 6 (indices 1-6) includes the global max (7) and min (1 is not in the subsegment). \n\nSo the outside includes the first element (1) and the last element (1). \n\nThe outside's max is 1, min is 1 \u2192 difference 0. \n\nThe inside's max is 7, min is 2 \u2192 difference 5. \n\nTotal is 5. \n\nNot good. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nPerhaps the first sample's array is such that the global max and min are positioned such that any subsegment including both must exclude an element that is not them, but the inside's max and min are still the global ones. \n\nWait, let's think of an example where the maximum beauty is 2*(global difference). \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]. \n\nGlobal max is 5, min is 1. \n\nThe subsegment is the entire array except the last element (2). \n\nThe outside is just 2. \n\nThe inside includes both 5 and 1. \n\nThe outside's difference is 0. \n\nThe inside's difference is 5-1=4. \n\nTotal is 4. \n\nNot good. \n\nAlternatively, the subsegment is the entire array except the element 3. \n\nThe outside includes 3. \n\nThe inside includes 1 and 5. \n\nThe outside's max is max(1,5, etc. excluding 3?) \n\nWait the outside is the element 3. \n\nSo outside's max and min are 3. \n\nThe inside includes 1 and 5. \n\nThe inside's max is 5, min is 1. \n\nSo the outside's difference is 0. \n\nTotal is 4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the array is [1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]. \n\nGlobal max is 6, min is 1. \n\nThe subsegment is from 0 to 5 (excluding the last element 1). \n\nThe outside is the last element (1). \n\nThe inside includes the global max and min (the first element is 1). \n\nThe outside's difference is 0. \n\nThe inside's difference is 6-1=5. \n\nTotal is 5. \n\nNot 10. \n\nHmm, I'm not seeing how to get 2*(global difference). \n\nPerhaps my initial assumption is wrong. \n\nMaybe the maximum beauty is not always achievable as 2*(global difference). \n\nSo back to the problem. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays for max and min, and also precompute for each position the maximum and minimum in the entire array except that position. \n\nThen, for each possible single-element exclusion, compute the beauty as (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub), where max_sub and min_sub are the max and min of the array excluding that element. \n\nThe maximum among these would be a candidate. \n\nAdditionally, we need to consider cases where the subsegment excludes more than one element but still allows the outside to have the global max and min. \n\nBut this might be too time-consuming. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty can be obtained by considering the following cases:\n\n1. The subsegment excludes the first element. \n\nThe outside's max and min are the first element. \n\nThe inside's max and min are the max and min of the rest. \n\nBeauty is 0 + (max_rest - min_rest). \n\n2. The subsegment excludes the last element. \n\nSimilar to case 1. \n\n3. The subsegment excludes the global max. \n\nThe outside includes the global max. \n\nThe inside's max is the max of the subsegment (which excludes the global max). \n\nThe outside's max is global_max. \n\nThe outside's min is the global_min (if the subsegment doesn't exclude it). \n\nSo the outside's difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside's difference is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTotal is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nSimilarly for excluding the global min. \n\n4. The subsegment excludes neither the global max nor the global min. \n\nThen the outside includes both, so their difference is global. \n\nThe inside's difference can be up to the global difference (if the subsegment includes both). \n\nThus, the total would be global + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTo find the maximum, we need to find the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that include both global max and min. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nPerhaps the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that include both global max and min is the global difference. \n\nThus, the total would be global + global = 2*global. \n\nBut this requires that there exists a subsegment that includes both and excludes at least one other element. \n\nIf such a subsegment exists, then the maximum beauty is 2*global. \n\nOtherwise, it's not possible. \n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nCompute the global_max and global_min. \n\nCheck if there exists a subsegment that includes both global_max and global_min and is a proper subsegment. \n\nIf yes, then the maximum beauty is 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nElse, the maximum is the maximum between the cases where we exclude one element (as in case 1-2). \n\nBut how to check if such a subsegment exists? \n\nIt exists if the global_max and global_min are not at the ends of the array. \n\nFor example, if the global_max is at position i and global_min is at position j, then there exists a subsegment that includes both and excludes some other element. \n\nThus, the maximum beauty would be 2*global difference. \n\nBut in the first sample's case, why is the answer 9 instead of 10? \n\nPerhaps the first sample's array has the global_max and global_min positioned such that any subsegment including both must be the entire array. \n\nFor example, if the global_max is the first element and global_min is the last element. \n\nThen any subsegment including both must start at 0 and end at n-1, which is the entire array, which is not allowed. \n\nAh! That's possible. \n\nIn this case, the maximum beauty cannot be 2*global difference. \n\nSo the algorithm must account for this. \n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute global_max and global_min. \n\n2. Find the positions of global_max and global_min. \n\n3. Check if there exists a proper subsegment that includes both global_max and global_min. \n\nThis is possible if the global_max and global_min are not at the two ends of the array. \n\nFor example, if the global_max is at position i and global_min is at position j, then if i is not 0 and j is not n-1, then there exists a subsegment that includes both and excludes some element. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the subsegment can be from the first occurrence of global_max to the last occurrence of global_min, or vice versa. \n\nBut this requires that they are not at the ends. \n\nIf the global_max is at position 0 and global_min is at position n-1, then any subsegment including both must start at 0 and end at n-1, which is the entire array. \n\nThus, in this case, the maximum beauty cannot be 2*global difference. \n\nSo the algorithm must first check whether such a subsegment exists. \n\nIf yes, then the maximum is 2*global difference. \n\nElse, the maximum is the maximum between the cases where we exclude one element (like the first or last), or other cases. \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum between:\n\na) The maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for all possible subsegments (proper), which can be done using a sparse table for range max and min. \n\nb) The global difference plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that exclude at least one of the global max or min. \n\nBut even this requires O(n) time per test case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that excludes at least one of the global max or min. \n\n- (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that excludes at least one element (so the outside's difference is 0). \n\nThe first term is when the outside includes both global max and min, so their difference is global. \n\nThe second term is when the outside's difference is 0 (because the subsegment excludes an element that is part of the global max or min). \n\nThus, the maximum beauty is the maximum between all possible (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min) for all proper subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can find that the maximum occurs in one of the following cases:\n\n- The subsegment excludes the first element. \n\n- The subsegment excludes the last element. \n\n- The subsegment excludes the global max. \n\n- The subsegment excludes the global min. \n\n- The subsegment excludes both global max and min. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the first element. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the last element. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the global max. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the global min. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except both global max and min. \n\nFor each of these cases, compute the beauty and take the maximum. \n\nThis would require O(1) per case, but how many cases are there? \n\nPerhaps 8 cases. \n\nThis would be manageable. \n\nLet me think through each case:\n\nCase 1: Exclude the first element. \n\nThe subsegment is from 1 to n-1 (0-based). \n\nThe outside is the first element. \n\nOutside's max and min are a[0]. \n\nSo outside difference is 0. \n\nInside's max and min are the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nBeauty is 0 + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nCase 2: Exclude the last element. \n\nSubsegment is 0 to n-2. \n\nOutside is last element. \n\nBeauty is 0 + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nCase 3: Exclude the global max. \n\nThe subsegment is the entire array except the position of global max. \n\nThe outside includes the global max. \n\nThe inside's max is the max of the subsegment (which excludes global max). \n\nThe outside's max is global_max. \n\nThe outside's min is the global_min (if the subsegment doesn't exclude it). \n\nThus, outside's difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside's difference is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTotal is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nCase 4: Exclude the global min. \n\nSimilar to case 3. \n\nThe outside includes the global min. \n\nThe outside's difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside's difference is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTotal is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nCase 5: Exclude both global max and min. \n\nThe subsegment excludes both. \n\nThe outside includes both. \n\nThus, outside's difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside's difference is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTotal is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nBut this requires that the subsegment excludes both, but still is a proper subsegment. \n\nCase 6: The subsegment includes both global max and min. \n\nThe outside must exclude at least one element. \n\nThe outside's difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside's difference is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum possible here is when the inside's difference is also global_max - global_min. \n\nThus, the total is 2*(global difference). \n\nThis is possible only if there exists a subsegment that includes both and excludes at least one other element. \n\nTo compute this, we need to check if such a subsegment exists. \n\nIf yes, then this case's value is 2*(global difference). \n\nOtherwise, it's not possible. \n\nSo to compute this case's value, we can check if the global max and min are not at the ends. \n\nAlternatively, compute the maximum between all possible cases. \n\nThis approach requires precomputing the max and min for certain subsegments. \n\nFor example, to compute case 3 (exclude global max), we need the max and min of the array excluding the global max's position. \n\nTo do this efficiently, we can precompute prefix and suffix arrays for max and min. \n\nFor example, the max of the array excluding the global max's position can be computed as the maximum between the prefix_max up to the position-1 and the suffix_max from position+1. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nThis way, for each of the cases, we can compute the required values in O(1) time. \n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read the array. \n\n2. Compute global_max and global_min. \n\n3. Find the indices of global_max and global_min. \n\n4. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\n5. Compute the following candidates:\n\na) Case 1: exclude first element. \n\nsubsegment is 1 to n-1. \n\nmax_sub = max of this subsegment. \n\nmin_sub = min of this subsegment. \n\nbeauty = (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nb) Case 2: exclude last element. \n\nsubsegment is 0 to n-2. \n\nmax_sub = max of this subsegment. \n\nmin_sub = min of this subsegment. \n\nbeauty = (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nc) Case 3: exclude global_max's position. \n\nsubsegment is all except global_max's index. \n\nmax_sub = max of the array excluding that position. \n\nmin_sub = min of the array excluding that position. \n\nbeauty = (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nd) Case 4: exclude global_min's position. \n\nsimilar to case 3. \n\ne) Case 5: exclude both global_max and global_min's positions. \n\nsubsegment excludes both. \n\nmax_sub = max of the array excluding both. \n\nmin_sub = min of the array excluding both. \n\nbeauty = (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nf) Case 6: check if there exists a subsegment that includes both global_max and global_min and is proper. \n\nIf yes, then the maximum possible is 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nTo check this, we can see if the global_max and global_min are not at the ends. \n\nFor example, if the global_max is not at position 0 or n-1, and similarly for global_min. \n\nAlternatively, if the global_max and global_min are not at the ends, then there exists a subsegment that includes both and excludes an element. \n\nThus, if this is true, then the candidate is 2*(global difference). \n\nElse, this candidate is not possible. \n\ng) Also consider the case where the subsegment is the entire array except the first and last elements. \n\nThe outside includes first and last elements. \n\nThe outside's max and min are the max and min of first and last elements. \n\nThe inside's max and min are the max and min of the middle elements. \n\nThis might give a higher value. \n\nBut this could be covered by other cases. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute the max_sub and min_sub for cases c, d, e. \n\nTo compute the max of the array excluding a certain position i: \n\nmax_without_i = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) \n\nSimilarly for min_without_i. \n\nFor case c (exclude global_max's position i):\n\nmax_sub = max_without_i \n\nmin_sub = min_without_i \n\nSimilarly for case d. \n\nFor case e (exclude both global_max and global_min's positions i and j):\n\nAssuming i < j: \n\nmax_without_i_j = max( prefix_max[i-1], max( suffix_max[j+1], prefix_max[j-1] ) ) \n\nWait this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the max of the array excluding both positions can be computed as the maximum of the prefix up to i-1, the suffix after j, and the region between i and j excluding j. \n\nThis might require more careful computation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the max and min for the entire array excluding both positions by combining the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nAlternatively, for case e, the max_sub is the maximum of the array excluding both positions. \n\nTo compute this, we can compute the maximum of the array excluding the first position, then excluding the second, but this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, the max_without_i_j is the maximum of the array excluding both i and j. \n\nThis can be computed as the maximum between the prefix_max up to min(i,j)-1, the suffix_max after max(i,j), and the max between the regions between i and j. \n\nThis is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps for the purposes of this problem, the cases c and d are sufficient, and case e can be ignored. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between all the cases a to f. \n\nNow, let's try to code this approach. \n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nRead n and the array. \n\nCompute global_max and global_min. \n\nFind their indices. \n\nCompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nThen compute the candidates for each case. \n\nThe maximum of all these candidates is the answer. \n\nNow, let's think about how to compute the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nFor prefix_max:\n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1:\n\nprefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nprefix_min similarly. \n\nSuffix_max:\n\nsuffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1]\n\nfor i from n-2 down to 0:\n\nsuffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nSame for suffix_min. \n\nThen, for example, the max of the array excluding position i is:\n\nif i ==0:\n\nmax_val = suffix_max[1]\n\nelif i ==n-1:\n\nmax_val = prefix_max[n-2]\n\nelse:\n\nmax_val = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n\nSimilarly for min_val. \n\nNow, for case 3 (exclude global_max's position):\n\ni = pos_max \n\nmax_sub = max_without_i \n\nmin_sub = min_without_i \n\nbeauty_candidate = (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub)\n\nSimilarly for case4 (exclude global_min's position). \n\nFor case6: \n\nif the global_max is not at position 0 or n-1, and global_min is not at position 0 or n-1, then the candidate is 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nElse, this candidate is not possible. \n\nNow, the maximum of all these candidates is the answer. \n\nLet's test this approach with the first sample. \n\nFirst sample's note says the optimal is 9. \n\nAssume the array has global_max 6 and global_min 1. \n\nSuppose the global_max is at position 6 (0-based?), and global_min is at position 0 and 7 (assuming the array has elements like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 1]). \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nBut in the first sample's case, the optimal subsegment excludes the global_max (6). \n\nSo case3 would be excluding the global_max's position. \n\nThe max_sub would be the max of the array excluding that position. \n\nSuppose the global_max is at position 6 (0-based). \n\nThen max_without_i would be the max of the array excluding position6. \n\nThe max would be 5 (if the array has 5 there). \n\nThe min_sub would be 1. \n\nSo the inside's difference is 5-1=4. \n\nThe outside's difference is 6-1=5. \n\nTotal is 5+4=9, which matches the sample. \n\nCase6: if the global_max and global_min are not at the ends, then the candidate is 2*(5) =10. \n\nBut in this case, perhaps the global_max is at the end, so case6 is not possible. \n\nThus, the maximum would be 9. \n\nThis approach would work. \n\nNow, the second sample's note: \n\nThe optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based), which is indices 1-3 (0-based). \n\nThe array's global_max is 200, global_min is 2. \n\nThe outside includes elements before 1 and after 3. \n\nThe outside's max is 100 (assuming the first element is 100?), and min is 2. \n\nSo outside difference is 98. \n\nThe inside's max is 200, min is 1. \n\nInside difference is 199. \n\nTotal is 98+199=297, which matches the sample. \n\nIn this case, the global_max is in the subsegment, and the global_min is also in the outside. \n\nThus, the outside's difference is global_max - global_min (200-2=198?), but in the example, the outside's max is 100 and min is 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the global_max is 200 and global_min is 2. \n\nThe outside includes the first element (100) and the elements after r=4 (assuming the array has elements like [2, 100, 3, 200, 1, ... ]). \n\nThe outside's max is max(2, 100, ...) which is 100. \n\nThe outside's min is 2. \n\nThus, the outside's difference is 98. \n\nThe inside's max is 200, min is 1. \n\nTotal is 98+199=297. \n\nIn this case, the maximum candidate would be case3 (excluding the global_min's position). \n\nExcluding the global_min (position0), the outside includes it, so the outside's difference is 200-2=198. \n\nThe inside's max is 200, min is 1. \n\nThus, the candidate would be 198 + (200-1) = 198+199=397, which is higher than the actual answer. \n\nHmm, this suggests a problem with the approach. \n\nWait, what's the inside's max and min when excluding the global_min's position (position0). \n\nThe subsegment is the entire array except position0. \n\nThe inside includes the global_max (200) and the global_min is excluded. \n\nThe inside's min would be the minimum of the array excluding position0. \n\nIf the array has elements like [2, 100, 3, 200, 1, ...], then excluding position0 (2), the min would be 1. \n\nThus, the inside's difference is 200-1=199. \n\nThe outside's difference is global_max - global_min (200-2=198). \n\nTotal is 198+199=397, which is higher than the sample's answer. \n\nBut the sample's answer is 297. \n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWhat's wrong here? \n\nAh, because the subsegment excluding the global_min's position is a proper subsegment. \n\nIn this case, the subsegment is the entire array except the first element. \n\nThe length is n-1, which is proper. \n\nThus, the candidate for case4 (exclude global_min) would be 198+199=397, which is higher than the sample's answer. \n\nBut the sample's answer is 297. \n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this indicates that the approach is not correct. \n\nWhat's the issue here? \n\nThe sample's second case's optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based), which is indices 1-3 (0-based). \n\nThe outside includes the first element (100) and the elements after 3 (like 1 and others). \n\nThe outside's max is 100, min is 2 (if the first element is 100 and the global_min is 2 at position0). \n\nThus, the outside's difference is 98. \n\nThe inside's max is 200, min is 1. \n\nTotal is 297. \n\nBut according to the approach, there is a better candidate of 397. \n\nThis suggests that the approach is wrong. \n\nSo what's wrong with the approach? \n\nAh, because when excluding the global_min's position (position0), the outside includes the global_min (since it's excluded from the subsegment). \n\nWait no: the subsegment excludes the global_min's position (position0), so the outside includes that position. \n\nThus, the outside includes the global_min (2), and the global_max (200). \n\nThus, the outside's difference is 200-2=198. \n\nThe inside's max is 200, min is 1. \n\nThus, the total is 198+199=397. \n\nBut why is this not the sample's answer? \n\nBecause the sample's second case's optimal subsegment is not this one. \n\nThis suggests that the sample's second case's array must have the global_min not at position0. \n\nWait the sample's second case's note says the optimal subsegment is l=2 to r=4 (1-based), which is indices 1-3 (0-based). \n\nThe outside includes elements before l=2 (indices 0 and 1) and after r=4 (indices 4 and beyond). \n\nThe outside's max is 100 (from the first element?), and the min is 2 (from the first element). \n\nThus, the global_min must be 2, which is in the outside. \n\nThe global_max is 200, which is in the inside. \n\nThus, the outside's max is 100, not the global_max. \n\nAh! So the global_max is in the inside, but the outside does not include it. \n\nThus, the outside's max is not the global_max. \n\nThus, the outside's difference is 100-2=98. \n\nThe inside's difference is 200-1=199. \n\nTotal is 297. \n\nBut according to the approach, the case where we exclude the global_min's position (which is 2) would have the outside include the global_min (2) and the global_max (200). \n\nThus, the outside's difference is 198. \n\nThe inside's difference is 199. \n\nTotal is 397. \n\nThis suggests that the sample's second case's array must have the global_min not at position0. \n\nWait perhaps the global_min is at position4 (the element 1). \n\nThen excluding that position would give a different result. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the approach is correct and the sample's second case's optimal is not the maximum possible. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the sample's second case's answer is 297, which suggests that the approach's candidate of 397 is not possible. \n\nThus, there must be an error in the approach. \n\nPerhaps the mistake is that when excluding the global_min's position, the subsegment includes the global_max, but the outside includes the global_min. \n\nBut the outside's max could be the global_max if it is in the outside. \n\nWait no: the subsegment excludes the global_min's position, but includes the global_max's position. \n\nThus, the outside includes the global_min's position (which is excluded from the subsegment), but the global_max is in the subsegment. \n\nThus, the outside does not include the global_max. \n\nAh! This is the key mistake. \n\nWhen we exclude the global_min's position, the subsegment includes the global_max's position (assuming it's not excluded). \n\nThus, the outside includes the global_min's position (which is excluded from the subsegment), but the global_max is in the subsegment. \n\nThus, the outside does not include the global_max. \n\nThus, the outside's max is not the global_max. \n\nThus, the outside's difference is not global_max - global_min. \n\nAh! This is the mistake in the approach. \n\nThe case3 and case4 assume that the outside includes the global_max and global_min, but this is only true if the subsegment excludes the global_max or global_min, but includes the other. \n\nWait, in case3 (exclude global_max's position), the subsegment excludes the global_max. \n\nThus, the outside includes the global_max. \n\nThe global_min may or may not be in the subsegment. \n\nIf the subsegment includes the global_min, then the outside's min is the global_min. \n\nThus, the outside's difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe inside's max is the max of the subsegment (which excludes global_max). \n\nThe inside's min is the min of the subsegment (which includes global_min). \n\nThus, the inside's difference is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThus, the total is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nBut in the second sample's case, when excluding the global_min's position, the subsegment includes the global_max. \n\nThus, the outside includes the global_min's position (which is excluded from the subsegment), but the global_max is in the subsegment. \n\nThus, the outside does not include the global_max. \n\nThus, the outside's max is not the global_max. \n\nThus, the outside's difference is not global_max - global_min. \n\nThus, the approach's assumption is wrong. \n\nThis means that the approach is incorrect. \n\nThis is a major problem. \n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps I need to think of a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the beauty formula again: \n\nBeauty = (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nThe outside is everything not in the subsegment. \n\nThe inside is the subsegment. \n\nThe outside_max is the maximum of the elements not in the subsegment. \n\nThe outside_min is the minimum of those elements. \n\nThe inside_max is the maximum of the subsegment. \n\nThe inside_min is the minimum of the subsegment. \n\nTo maximize this, we need to maximize both terms. \n\nThe maximum possible value of the first term is the global_max - global_min of the entire array, but this requires that the subsegment does not include either the global_max or global_min. \n\nThe second term can be up to the global_max - global_min of the subsegment. \n\nThus, the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) + (global_max_sub - global_min_sub), where the subsegment excludes both global_max and global_min. \n\nBut this is not necessarily the case. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right. \n\nFor example, for each position i, the maximum to the left of i and the maximum to the right of i. \n\nSimilarly for min. \n\nThen, for any subsegment from l to r, the outside_max is the maximum between the left_max[l-1] and the right_max[r+1]. \n\nThe outside_min is the minimum between the left_min[l-1] and the right_min[r+1]. \n\nThe inside_max is the maximum between l and r. \n\nThe inside_min is the minimum between l and r. \n\nThus, the beauty can be computed as (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nTo find the maximum over all possible l and r, we need to find the maximum of this expression. \n\nThe problem is to compute this efficiently. \n\nThe inside_max and inside_min can be computed using a sparse table for range max and min queries. \n\nThe outside_max and outside_min can be computed using the precomputed left and right arrays. \n\nThus, for each possible l and r, the beauty can be computed in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing. \n\nThe total time would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=1e5. \n\nThus, this approach is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except the first element or the last element. \n\nThus, we can compute the beauty for these two cases and take the maximum. \n\nIn the first sample's case, excluding the first element gives a beauty of (max of the rest - min of the rest). \n\nThe max of the rest is 6, min is 1. \n\nThus, the beauty is 5. \n\nExcluding the last element gives a beauty of (max of first n-1 elements - min of first n-1 elements). \n\nIf the last element is 1, then the min of first n-1 is 1, max is 6. \n\nThus, the beauty is 5. \n\nThe optimal case is when excluding the global_max's position, which gives 9. \n\nThus, this approach would miss the correct answer. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that excludes at least one of the global_max or global_min. \n\n- (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that excludes at least one element. \n\nThe first term is when the outside includes both global_max and global_min, so their difference is global. \n\nThe second term is when the outside's difference is smaller. \n\nThus, the maximum is the maximum between all possible (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nThus, we can compute the beauty for all n possible single-element exclusions and take the maximum. \n\nThis would be O(n) per test case. \n\nLet's see: \n\nFor each element i in 0..n-1:\n\nThe subsegment is the array excluding i. \n\nThe outside is just the element a[i]. \n\nThus, outside_max and min are a[i]. \n\nThe outside's difference is 0. \n\nThe inside's difference is (max of the array excluding i) - (min of the array excluding i). \n\nThus, the beauty is (max_without_i - min_without_i). \n\nThe maximum of this over all i is a candidate. \n\nAdditionally, there might be cases where excluding two elements gives a higher beauty. \n\nBut considering all possible single-element exclusions might give the correct answer. \n\nIn the first sample's case, excluding the global_max's position (6) gives max_without_i =5, min_without_i=1 \u2192 difference 4. \n\nThe beauty is 4. \n\nBut the optimal case is when excluding a subsegment of two elements (like the last two), which gives a higher beauty. \n\nThus, this approach would also miss the correct answer. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for hints or think of the problem differently. \n\nThe beauty is (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min). \n\nThe outside is the complement of the subsegment. \n\nThe outside_max is the maximum of the elements not in the subsegment. \n\nThe inside_max is the maximum of the subsegment. \n\nThus, the total max contribution from the max terms is (outside_max + inside_max) - (outside_min + inside_min). \n\nTo maximize this, we want to maximize (outside_max + inside_max) and minimize (outside_min + inside_min). \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (max of the entire array excluding the subsegment) - (min of the entire array excluding the subsegment) + (max of the subsegment) - (min of the subsegment). \n\nThis can be rewritten as (max of entire array excluding subsegment + max of subsegment) - (min of entire array excluding subsegment + min of subsegment). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array excluding the subsegment - min of the entire array excluding the subsegment) + (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment). \n\nThis is the same as the original formula. \n\nPerhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except the first element or the last element. \n\nThus, the code can be written to compute the maximum between these two cases and the case where the subsegment excludes the global_max or global_min. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and see. \n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe code needs to read the test cases, for each array, compute the maximum beauty as described. \n\nThe code would look something like this:\n\nRead the input lines. \n\nBut the given code for program1.py is:\n\nfor sdr in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe problem says that program1.py is to be completed. \n\nThe code starts with a loop over the test cases. \n\nThe input format is that the first line is t, then for each test case, the first line is n, then the second line is the array. \n\nThe given code for program1.py is:\n\nfor sdr in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis seems to be iterating over every second line starting from the second line. \n\nBut the input has for each test case two lines: n and the array. \n\nThus, the code is probably reading the array lines. \n\nBut the code is incomplete. \n\nThe correct approach would be to read all the input lines, process each test case. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the initial approach. \n\nThe code for program1.py would involve:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n and the array. \n\nCompute global_max and global_min. \n\nFind their indices. \n\nCompute prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nCompute the candidates for the cases mentioned earlier. \n\nThe maximum of these is the answer. \n\nNow, the code for program2.py is straightforward. \n\nThe problem is to determine the division based on the rating. \n\nThe divisions are:\n\nDivision 1: rating >=1900 \n\nDivision 2: 1600 <= rating <=1899 \n\nDivision3: 1400 <= rating <=1599 \n\nDivision4: rating <=1399 \n\nThus, for each rating, we can check these conditions in order. \n\nThe code for program2.py is:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][1:]: \n\n    rating = int(n.strip()) \n\n    if rating >=1900: \n\n        print(\"Division 1\") \n\n    elif 1600 <= rating <=1899: \n\n        print(\"Division 2\") \n\n    elif 1400 <= rating <=1599: \n\n        print(\"Division 3\") \n\n    else: \n\n        print(\"Division 4\") \n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is this. \n\nFor program1.py, the code is more complex. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach. \n\nThe code for program1.py would involve:\n\nRead the input lines properly. \n\nBut the given code for program1.py is:\n\nfor sdr in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is iterating over every second line starting from the second line. \n\nThe first line is t. \n\nThen for each test case, the first line is n, then the array. \n\nThus, the array lines are the even-indexed lines after the first line. \n\nThus, the code should read the array lines. \n\nBut the code is incomplete. \n\nThe correct code would be something like:\n\nimport sys \n\nfor _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())): \n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline()) \n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) \n\n    # compute the maximum beauty \n\n    # ... \n\n    print(ans) \n\nBut the given code uses a different approach. \n\nThe given code for program1.py is:\n\nfor sdr in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is iterating over the array lines. \n\nBut the code needs to process each test case properly. \n\nPerhaps the correct code for program1.py is:\n\nimport sys \n\nfor sdr in sys.stdin: \n\n    # but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code should read all the input lines. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed to write the code for program1.py based on the initial approach. \n\nThe code for program1.py would be:\n\nimport sys \n\ndef main(): \n\n    import sys \n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split() \n\n    ptr = 0 \n\n    t = int(input[ptr]) \n\n    ptr +=1 \n\n    for _ in range(t): \n\n        n = int(input[ptr]) \n\n        ptr +=1 \n\n        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n])) \n\n        ptr +=n \n\n        # compute global_max and global_min \n\n        global_max = max(a) \n\n        global_min = min(a) \n\n        # find positions
