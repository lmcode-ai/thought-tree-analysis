The problem is about shuffling shoes such that each student gets a pair that's at least their size and not their own. The input array is non-decreasing. Hmm, so the key points are:\n\n1. Each student must get a shoe size >= their own. 2. No one can get their own shoes (so permutation p must be a derangement). 3. We need to find any valid permutation or return -1. The given code for program1.py seems to have some logic but is incomplete. Let me think about the approach. First, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. So for a valid permutation, each student i must get a shoe from some j where s[j] >= s[i], and j ! = i. The simplest case is when all shoe sizes are the same. Then any derangement would work.",

Wait, but the array is non-decreasing. Let's think of the sorted array. Let's say the array is s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n. For the first student (smallest size), they can take any shoe except their own. But the shoe must be >= s_1. Since all shoes are >= s_1, except their own, but they can take any except themselves. But for the last student (largest size), they can only take a shoe from someone else with the same size, if possible. Hmm, perhaps the approach is to pair each student with someone else's shoe in a way that satisfies the conditions. An idea is to arrange the permutation such that each student gets the next available shoe that is >= their size and not their own. But how?",

So the possible options are 3 or 4 (assuming 1-based indices). So their p_i can be 3 or 4. But can't be 4 (since that would be their own). So they can take 3's shoe (if possible).",

But this works only if the first student's shoe is >= the last's. Which is only possible if all elements are same. Hmm, not helpful. Hmm, perhaps the key is to arrange the permutation in such a way that for each i, p_i is in a position j where s[j] >= s[i], and j ! =i. Since the array is sorted, for each i, the minimal j where s[j] >= s[i] is i. So to avoid taking their own, they can take j = i+1, but only if s[i+1] >= s[i]. Wait, but in the case where s[i] = s[i+1], then that's okay. Wait, let's think of the example [2,2,3,3]. For i=1 (assuming 1-based), s[1]=2. The next is 2 (same), so can take j=2. So p[1] =2.\n\ni=2: s=2. Next is 3 (3>2). So can take j=3? But then p[2]=3. But then student3's shoe is 3, which is okay for them. But then student3 would need to take someone else's. Wait, perhaps this approach can be extended. Alternatively, here's a possible algorithm: We can construct the permutation as follows: For each i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1, except for the last element which points to 1. But this is the cyclic shift. However, this works only if for all i, s[i+1] >= s[i], which is true since the array is non-decreasing. But the problem is that the last element's s is s[n], and the first's is s[1]. So for the last element (n), their p is 1. So s[1] must be >= s[n]. Which is only possible if all elements are same. So this approach only works when all elements are same. Hmm, so that's not helpful for other cases. Alternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to assign each student to a shoe such that:\n\n- s[p_i] >= s[i]\n\n- p_i ! =i\n\n- p is a permutation.

For odd n, perhaps the last element can be paired with someone else. Wait, but what if n is odd?\n\nLike [2,2,2]. Then the permutation could be [2,3,1]. Each gets a different index, and all are same.

So in this case, it's impossible. So the answer would be -1. But according to the first condition, the last element is 2, which is same as the second last. So the first condition is okay. But there's a group of size 1 (the first element), which causes the problem. So the initial approach's conditions are not sufficient. We need to ensure that all groups have size at least 2? Wait, but the first group can be size 1, but the other groups must be able to accommodate the first student's choice. Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternative Idea:\n\nThe problem requires that for each student i, s[p_i] >= s[i], and p_i ! =i. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can construct the permutation as follows: For each i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1, except for the last which is 1. But this works only if s[1] >= s[n], which is only possible if all elements are same. So that's not helpful. Another Idea:\n\nSince the array is sorted, for each i, the minimal possible j where s[j] >= s[i] is i. So to avoid taking their own, we can take j = i+1 if possible. But for the last element, since s[n] is the maximum, they must take someone else's shoe with the same size. So the last element must have at least one other element with the same size (which we already checked). So for the last element, they can take the previous one's shoe (n-1).",

So the algorithm for the permutation is:\n\nLoop through the array, and for each group of consecutive same elements:\n\n- For the group's indices, shift them cyclically. For example:\n\nGroup starts at i and ends at j (indices). The permutation for these indices would be:\n\nfor k in i to j-1:\n\np[k] = k+1\n\np[j] =i.\n\nThis way, each element is shifted to the next, and the last points to the first. This ensures that no one is in their original position. Thus, the permutation can be built by applying this to each group. Now, how to implement this in code. The given code for program1.py is incomplete. Let's see what the current code does. Looking at the code:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    ans =[]\n\n    arr = [int(c) for c in input().split()]\n\n    j = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if i == j:continue\n\n        if arr[i] == arr[j]:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            if i == j+1:\n\n                print(-1)\n\n                break\n\n            else:\n\n                # print(list(range(j,i)))\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    else:\n\n        if n==j+1:\n\n            print(-1)\n\n        else:   \n\n            ls = list(range(j+1,n+1))\n\n            newls = [ls[-1]]+ls[0:-1]\n\n            ans.extend(newls)\n\n            print(*ans) Hmm, this code seems to be trying to find the first point where the elements change. The variable j is probably tracking the start of the current group. The loop for i in range(n):\n\n- if i ==j \u2192 skip.\n\n- if arr[i] == arr[j], continue (so j remains the same).\n\n- else, if i is j+1 \u2192 then the previous group has length 1 \u2192 so print -1. Else, do something. The 'else' clause after the for loop is executed only if the loop didn't break. Then, if n ==j+1 \u2192 print -1.\n\nElse, create a list from j+1 to n, then rotate it and add to ans. This code is probably trying to handle the case where all elements are the same, but it's not clear. The code seems to have some logic for checking if there's a group of size 1. The 'if i ==j+1' case would trigger when the first group has size 1 (since j is the start, and the next element is different). Thus, the code is checking for groups of size 1 and returns -1. But the code may not handle all cases. The correct approach would be to first check the conditions:\n\n- n==1 \u2192 -1.\n\n- s[-1] > s[-2] \u2192 -1.\n\n- any group has size 1 \u2192 -1. If all conditions are met, then construct the permutation by shifting each group.",

This part is probably for the case where all elements are the same (so j is 0, and the group is the entire array). Then, the code creates a list from j+1 (1) to n \u2192 [2,3,...n], then newls is [n, 2,3,...n-1]. Thus, the permutation is [n, 2,3,...n-1]. Wait, for n=4, this would be [4,2,3,1]. Which is a cyclic shift. This works for the all-same case. But for other cases, the code may not handle them.",

Perhaps the code is trying to check for groups of size 1. The 'if i ==j+1' case is when the group from j to i-1 has length 1 (since i is j+1 and the element is different). Thus, this triggers a -1. The else part (when i is not j+1) means that the current group has length >1, so it's okay. But then, after this loop, the code proceeds to check if n ==j+1 \u2192 which would mean the last group has size 1. Thus, the code is checking for groups of size 1 in the first and last groups. But what about groups in the middle? For example, in the array [2,2,1,1], the middle group (the 1's) would be okay, but if there's a group like [2,2,3,3,4,4,5], then the last group has size 1 \u2192 which is caught by the n==j+1 check. But if there's a group in the middle with size 1, like [2,2,3,4,4], then the third element (3) forms a group of size 1 \u2192 which is not detected by the current code. Thus, the current code is incorrect. The correct approach requires checking all groups for size 1.",

But since the user wants only the missing code parts, perhaps the 'TODO' section should be filled with code that checks for groups of size 1. Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the first group that has a size of 1, and then return -1. The current code's loop is trying to find the first point where the value changes. When it finds a new value (arr[i] ! = arr[j]), it checks if the previous group (from j to i-1) has length 1. If so, returns -1.\n\nElse, continues. Thus, this loop is checking for groups of size 1 in the first part of the array. The 'else' clause after the loop checks the last group. Thus, this code is checking all groups for size 1. Because:\n\n- The loop processes each group in order.\n\n- For each group, when the next element is different, it checks if the current group (from j to i-1) has length 1 (i-j ==1 \u2192 i =j+1). - If yes, returns -1.\n\n- Then, j is updated to i, and the process continues. Thus, this loop checks all groups except the last one. The 'else' clause after the loop checks the last group (from j to n-1). If the last group has length 1 (n-j ==1 \u2192 j =n-1 \u2192 n==j+1 \u2192 yes), then returns -1. Thus, this code correctly checks all groups for size 1. Thus, the code's logic is correct for checking the conditions. Now, the code proceeds to construct the permutation. In the 'else' clause (when all groups are okay): The code does:\n\nls = list(range(j+1, n+1)) \u2192 but j is the start of the last group. Wait, perhaps the code is assuming that all groups are of size >=2, and constructs the permutation by rotating each group. But the current code's construction is only for the case where all elements are the same (since j is 0, and the group is the entire array). Thus, the code's construction part is incorrect. The current code's construction is:\n\nls = list(range(j+1, n+1)) \u2192 for example, if j is 0 (all elements same), then ls is [2,3,...n].\n\nnewls = [ls[-1]] + ls[0:-1] \u2192 which is [n, 2,3,...n-1].",

The current code's construction is only for the all-same case. Thus, the code needs to be modified to handle all cases. The correct approach is to: For each group:\n\n- The indices of the group are from start to end. - The permutation for these indices is shifted: each element points to the next, and the last points to the first. Thus, for a group from a to b (0-based indices):\n\nfor i in a to b:\n\n    p[i] = a + (i -a +1) % (b-a+1) Wait, perhaps it's easier to create a list for the group's permutation.

While left <= right:\n\n- Take the largest element (p[right]).\n\n- The required number of elements in the team is ceil(D / p[right]).\n\n- But since we can only use elements <= p[right], we need to find how many elements from the left can be paired with this to form a team.

First, the first line: d is obtained from input().split()[1], but the first line of input for program2 is \"N D\", so the first line should be:\n\nN, D = map(int, input().split()) But the code has d = int(input().split()[1]).

The loop is while r>l:\n\nInside, there's a while loop: while s <=d:\n\nBut s is p[r], which is the current_max. The code is trying to find when the current_max exceeds D? But the code is incomplete. The TODO is inside the while s <=d loop. The code's logic is unclear. The correct approach is to implement the algorithm I described. Thus, the code should be: Sort the array. Initialize l=0, r =n-1, count=0. While l <=r:\n\n    current_max = p[r]\n\n    required = (D + current_max -1) // current_max\n\n    if required ==0:\n\n        required =1\n\n    if required ==1:\n\n        count +=1\n\n        r -=1\n\n    else:\n\n        if (r - l +1) > = required:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            r -=1\n\n            l += (required-1)\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\nThus, the code needs to be rewritten.

The current code's loop is:\n\nwhile r > l:\n\n    while s <=d:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    if l > r:\n\n        break\n\n    r -=1\n\n    s = p[r]\n\n    c +=1\n\nThis is not correct. The correct code should be: The code should compute required for current_max = p[r].

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem is about shuffling shoes such that each student gets a pair that's at least their size and not their own. The input array is non-decreasing. Hmm, so the key points are:\n\n1. Each student must get a shoe size >= their own.\n2. No one can get their own shoes (so permutation p must be a derangement).\n3. We need to find any valid permutation or return -1.\n\nThe given code for program1.py seems to have some logic but is incomplete. Let me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. So for a valid permutation, each student i must get a shoe from some j where s[j] >= s[i], and j != i.\n\nThe simplest case is when all shoe sizes are the same. Then any derangement would work. For example, if all are the same, then we can just shift everyone's shoes. Like [2,3,1] for 3 people.\n\nBut when there are varying sizes, we need to ensure that each student gets a shoe that's at least their size. Also, the derangement condition.\n\nWait, the problem requires that every student gets shoes of size >= their own. So the first thing to check is whether it's even possible. For instance, if a student has a shoe size larger than all others, they can't get any shoes (since their own is the only one, but they can't take their own). So in that case, it's impossible.\n\nSo first, the necessary conditions:\n\n- For each i, there exists at least one j != i where s[j] >= s[i]. But since the array is sorted, maybe we can find a way.\n\nWait, but the array is non-decreasing. Let's think of the sorted array. Let's say the array is s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n.\n\nFor the first student (smallest size), they can take any shoe except their own. But the shoe must be >= s_1. Since all shoes are >= s_1, except their own, but they can take any except themselves. But for the last student (largest size), they can only take a shoe from someone else with the same size, if possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to pair each student with someone else's shoe in a way that satisfies the conditions.\n\nAn idea is to arrange the permutation such that each student gets the next available shoe that is >= their size and not their own. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by trying to construct a permutation where each student gets a shoe from a higher or equal index, but not their own. But need to avoid cycles where someone ends up with their own.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to shift the indices. Like, for a sorted array, if all elements are the same, then a cyclic shift (like p[i] = i+1, with p[n] =1) would work as a derangement. But if there are varying sizes, maybe we can do something similar.\n\nWait, let's think of the case where the array is strictly increasing. For example, [1,2,3,4]. Then each student must get a shoe from someone with a higher or equal size. But the first student can take any except their own. Let's see:\n\nStudent 1 (size 1) can take any shoe except 1. Let's say they take 2's shoe (size 2). Then student 2 (size 2) can't take their own, so maybe take 3's (size3). Student3 takes 4's, and student4 must take someone else's. But student4's shoe is 4, so they can't take their own. The only option is to take someone else's. But if the last student (4) has to take someone else's, but all others have smaller sizes except maybe none. Wait, in this case, student4 can't take anyone else's shoe because all others are smaller. So this arrangement would fail.\n\nHmm, so in this case, the problem is impossible. So the array [1,2,3,4] would have no valid permutation. Because the last student can't get any shoe except their own, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that every student gets a shoe of size >= their own. So for the last student (size4), they need a shoe of size >=4. The only such shoe is their own. But they can't take their own. So in this case, it's impossible. So the answer would be -1.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether for each i, there exists at least one j !=i where s[j] >= s[i]. But since the array is sorted, for the last element s[n], the only possible j is itself. So if s[n] is the only one with that size, then it's impossible. So the necessary condition is that for the last element, there must be another element with s[j] >= s[n]. Which can only be true if s[n-1] == s[n]. So the last element must have at least one other element with the same size.\n\nWait, but even that may not be sufficient. Let's think of the case where all elements are the same except the last one. Like [2,2,3]. The last student has size3. The only shoe that can be given to them is their own, which is invalid. So that's impossible.\n\nSo the key is that for the last element, there must be at least one other element with the same size. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe there are multiple elements with the same size as the last. For example, [3,3,3]. Then the last student can take any of the first two's shoes. So that's okay.\n\nSo the first check is: the last element must have at least one other element with the same size. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but what about the first element? Suppose the first element is smaller than others. Then they can take any shoe except their own. But that's okay.\n\nSo the necessary conditions are:\n\n- For the last element, there exists at least one other element with the same size. Because otherwise, the last student can't get any shoe except their own.\n\nWait, but maybe there are elements after the last? No, the last is the largest. So the only way for the last student to get a shoe of size >= their own is their own, which is invalid. So the last element must have at least one other element with the same size.\n\nSo that's a necessary condition. So first, check if the last element's count is 1. If so, return -1.\n\nWait, but what if the array is like [2,2,3,3]. The last element is 3, and there are two others. So that's okay.\n\nAnother condition: For the first element, there must be at least one other element with the same size? Not sure. Let's see.\n\nWait, the first element can take any shoe except their own. Since all shoes are >= their size, so as long as there's at least one other shoe (i.e., n>1), then it's okay. But if n=1, then it's impossible (since the only option is their own, which is invalid). So n=1 must return -1.\n\nSo the first check is:\n\nIf n ==1: return -1.\n\nThen, check if the last element's count is 1. If yes, return -1.\n\nWait, but maybe there are elements before the last that have the same size as the last? Like in the case [3,3,4]. The last element is 4, but there's no other 4. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the necessary condition is that the maximum element must appear at least twice. Otherwise, impossible.\n\nWait, but the maximum element is s[-1], so if s[-2] < s[-1], then the last element can't get any shoe except their own. So that's impossible.\n\nSo the first check is:\n\nif n ==1: -1.\n\nElse, check if the last element is strictly greater than the second last. Then, it's impossible.\n\nWait, because in that case, the last element's shoe is the only one with that size, so they can't take it. So yes, that's a necessary condition.\n\nSo first, in code, for each test case:\n\nCheck if n ==1: output -1.\n\nElse, check if s[-1] > s[-2]. If so, then impossible, output -1.\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple elements with the maximum?\n\nLike [2,3,3]. Then s[-1] is 3, s[-2] is 3. So okay.\n\nAnother case: [3,3,3]. Then okay.\n\nSo that's a necessary condition.\n\nAnother possible condition: For all elements except the last, their s[i] must be <= s[j] for some j !=i. But since the array is sorted, that's automatically true except for the last element.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the last element is strictly greater than the second last. If yes, then impossible.\n\nWait, but what about when the array is like [1,1,2,2]. The last element is 2, and the second last is 2. So okay. The last student can take the third's shoe.\n\nSo the first check is:\n\nif n ==1: -1.\n\nelif s[-1] > s[-2]: then output -1.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, how to construct the permutation.\n\nThe idea is to create a derangement where each student gets a shoe from someone else with s[j] >= s[i].\n\nSince the array is sorted, perhaps we can pair each student with someone else in a way that their shoe is >= their own.\n\nOne possible approach is to shift the indices. For example, in the case where all elements are the same, the derangement can be [2,3,4...,1].\n\nBut when there are varying sizes, perhaps we can do a cyclic shift, but ensuring that each element is assigned to someone with the same or higher size.\n\nWait, let's think of the sorted array. Since the array is non-decreasing, perhaps we can pair each student with the next one, except the last which wraps around.\n\nWait, for example, in the case [2,2,3,3], the permutation could be [2,3,4,1]. Let's see:\n\nStudent 1 (2) gets student 2's shoe (2) which is okay.\n\nStudent 2 (2) gets 3's shoe (3) which is okay.\n\nStudent3 (3) gets 4's (3) which is okay.\n\nStudent4 (3) gets 1's (2) which is okay (since 2 <=3).\n\nWait, but student4's shoe is 3, so they can take 1's shoe (size 2) which is less than their own? Wait no, the problem requires that the shoes given must be >= their own size. Wait, no, the problem says that the shoes given must be >= the student's size. Wait, the student's own size is s_i, and the shoes they receive are from p_i's shoes, which must be s_{p_i} >= s_i.\n\nWait, in the example above, student4's own shoe is 3. The shoes they receive are from p_4's shoe. So if p_4 is 1, then s[0] (assuming 0-based) is 2, which is less than 3. That would be invalid.\n\nAh, right! So that approach would not work here.\n\nHmm, so the permutation must ensure that for each i, s[p_i] >= s[i].\n\nSo in the example [2,2,3,3], student4 (s=3) must get a shoe from someone with s_j >=3. So the possible options are 3 or 4 (assuming 1-based indices). So their p_i can be 3 or 4. But can't be 4 (since that would be their own). So they can take 3's shoe (if possible).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the permutation is [2,3,4,1]. Then for student4 (index 3 in 0-based?), let's see:\n\nWait, in 1-based indices, student4 is the 4th. So p_4 is 1. The shoe size is s[0] (assuming 0-based) which is 2 <3. So that's invalid.\n\nSo that permutation is invalid.\n\nHmm, so the shifting approach may not work here.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the array is sorted, perhaps we can pair each student with someone to their right, but not their own. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of the array as sorted. For each i, we can assign p_i to be the next possible j where s[j] >= s[i], and j !=i.\n\nBut how to do this in a way that forms a valid permutation (no duplicates, and all conditions met).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to pair each student with the next one, except for the last which pairs with the first. But only if that works.\n\nWait, let's think of the example [2,2,3,3].\n\nPossible permutation:\n\np = [2,1,4,3]\n\nCheck:\n\nStudent1 (2) gets 2's shoe (2) which is okay (since 2 >=2, and not their own (if 1-based, then student1's own is 1, so p_i=2 is okay).\n\nWait, in 1-based indices:\n\nStudent1's p is 2: that's okay (not their own). The shoe size is 2 >=2.\n\nStudent2's p is 1: okay, shoe size 2 >=2.\n\nStudent3's p is4: shoe size3 >=3.\n\nStudent4's p is3: shoe size3 >=3.\n\nSo this works. So this is a valid derangement.\n\nSo in this case, the permutation is swapping adjacent pairs.\n\nAnother example: [3,3,3]. The permutation could be [2,3,1]. Each gets a different index, and all shoes are 3.\n\nSo that works.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,2,3].\n\nWait, the last element is 3. The second last is 2. So s[-1] > s[-2], so the condition we had earlier would say it's impossible. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the last element is strictly greater than the second last. If yes, output -1.\n\nNow, assuming that the last element is not greater than the second last (i.e., the maximum occurs at least twice), then we can proceed.\n\nNow, how to construct the permutation.\n\nAnother idea: Since the array is sorted, for each i, the minimal possible j where s[j] >= s[i] is i itself. But we can't choose j=i. So we need to choose the next possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can arrange the permutation such that each student i gets the next student's shoe, except the last which gets the first.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor the case [2,2,3,3], the permutation would be [2,3,4,1].\n\nWait, student4 (4th) gets 1's shoe (size 2 <3). That's invalid. So that's bad.\n\nHmm, so that approach won't work here.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the array is non-decreasing, perhaps we can pair each student with someone else in a way that their shoe is at least their own.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can create a permutation where each student i gets the shoe of i+1, except the last student who gets the first. But this works only if the first student's shoe is >= the last's. Which is not possible unless all are same.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternative idea inspired by the problem's note: when all sizes are equal, any derangement works. So for that case, we can do a cyclic shift.\n\nIn the general case, perhaps we can split the array into groups of equal sizes and arrange within those groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can arrange the permutation such that each student gets a shoe from someone else in the same group (same size) or a higher group.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's first note:\n\nIf all elements are the same, then any derangement is acceptable. So for that case, we can do a cyclic shift (like p[i] = i+1, with p[n] =1).\n\nIf not, then we can try to pair each student with someone else in a way that their shoe is at least their own.\n\nAnother approach is to pair each student with the next one, except for the last which pairs with the first, but only if that works.\n\nWait, let's think of the example [2,2,3,3].\n\nThe permutation [2,1,4,3] works. So for the first two (same size), they swap. The last two also swap.\n\nSo in this case, the permutation is swapping adjacent pairs.\n\nAnother example: [2,2,2,3,3].\n\nThen, the first three can form a cycle, and the last two swap.\n\nHmm, but how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can construct the permutation as follows:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1, except for the last which is 1. But this is the cyclic shift. However, this may not work when the last element's size is less than the first.\n\nWait, in the case [2,2,3,3], the last element is 3. The first is 2. So the last student (4) would get the first's shoe (2 <3). Which is invalid.\n\nSo that approach won't work here.\n\nHmm, so the cyclic shift works only when all elements are the same.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the array is sorted, for each i, the minimal possible j where s[j] >= s[i] is i. So to avoid taking their own, we can take j = i+1, but only if s[i+1] >= s[i].\n\nWait, but in the case where all are same, this would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can pair each student with the next one, except for the last which pairs with the first, but only if the first's shoe is acceptable for the last.\n\nWait, but in the example [2,2,3,3], the last student (4) has s=3. The first's shoe is 2, which is less than 3. So that's invalid.\n\nHmm, so that won't work.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nSince the array is sorted, for each student i, the earliest possible j where s[j] >= s[i] is i. So to avoid taking their own, they can take j = i+1, but only if s[i+1] >= s[i].\n\nWait, but in the case where s[i] = s[i+1], then that's okay.\n\nWait, perhaps the following algorithm:\n\nConstruct the permutation as follows:\n\nIf all elements are the same, then do a cyclic shift (p[i] = i+1, with p[n] =1).\n\nElse, we can try to pair each student with the next one, except for the last which pairs with the first, but only if the first's shoe is acceptable for the last.\n\nWait, but that may not work.\n\nAlternatively, here's another idea:\n\nWe can arrange the permutation such that each student i gets the shoe of i+1, except the last student who gets the shoe of the first student. But this works only if the first student's shoe is >= the last's. Which is only possible if all elements are same.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to arrange the permutation in such a way that for each i, p_i is in a position j where s[j] >= s[i], and j !=i.\n\nSince the array is sorted, for each i, the minimal j where s[j] >= s[i] is i. So to avoid taking their own, they can take j = i+1, but only if s[i+1] >= s[i].\n\nWait, but in the case where s[i] = s[i+1], then that's okay.\n\nWait, let's think of the example [2,2,3,3].\n\nFor i=1 (assuming 1-based), s[1]=2. The next is 2 (same), so can take j=2. So p[1] =2.\n\ni=2: s=2. Next is 3 (3>2). So can take j=3? But then p[2]=3. But then student3's shoe is 3, which is okay for them. But then student3 would need to take someone else's.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach can be extended.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible algorithm:\n\nWe can construct the permutation as follows:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1, except for the last element which points to 1.\n\nBut this is the cyclic shift. However, this works only if for all i, s[i+1] >= s[i], which is true since the array is non-decreasing. But the problem is that the last element's s is s[n], and the first's is s[1]. So for the last element (n), their p is 1. So s[1] must be >= s[n]. Which is only possible if all elements are same.\n\nSo this approach only works when all elements are same.\n\nHmm, so that's not helpful for other cases.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to assign each student to a shoe such that:\n\n- s[p_i] >= s[i]\n\n- p_i !=i\n\n- p is a permutation.\n\nThe array is sorted, so s is non-decreasing.\n\nLet me think of the permutation as a list where each element is assigned to another in a way that their shoe is at least their own.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to pair each student with someone else in the same group (same size) or a higher group.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can pair each student with the next one in the array, except when that's not possible.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note where all are same:\n\nIf the array has duplicates, then we can swap adjacent elements. For example, in the case of [2,2,3,3], swap 1<->2 and 3<->4. This gives a valid derangement.\n\nIn general, for even n, we can pair each i with i+1, and vice versa. For odd n, perhaps the last element can be paired with someone else.\n\nWait, but what if n is odd?\n\nLike [2,2,2]. Then the permutation could be [2,3,1]. Each gets a different index, and all are same.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother example: [2,2,3,3,3]. n=5.\n\nWe can do [2,1,4,5,3]. Let's see:\n\nStudent1 (2) gets 2's shoe (2) okay.\n\nStudent2 (2) gets 1's (2) okay.\n\nStudent3 (3) gets4's (3) okay.\n\nStudent4 (3) gets5's (3) okay.\n\nStudent5 (3) gets3's (3) okay.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo for even n, pairing adjacent pairs. For odd n, the last can be paired with the first?\n\nWait, in the case of 5 elements, the last (5) would get 3's shoe (3). Which is okay.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the general approach is to swap each i with i+1, except for the last element which swaps with the first if n is odd.\n\nWait, but how to handle when the array has varying sizes.\n\nWait, let's think of the case [2,3,3,3].\n\nn=4 (even). So pair 1-2, 3-4.\n\nStudent1 (2) gets 2's shoe (3). Which is okay.\n\nStudent2 (3) gets 1's (2). But 2 <3, so that's invalid.\n\nAh, right. So this approach won't work here.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that when the next element has a higher size, swapping would cause the first to get a higher shoe, but the second would get a lower one.\n\nSo that's invalid.\n\nHmm, so this approach only works when the elements are the same.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the solution is to arrange the permutation such that each student gets a shoe from someone with the same size, if possible, to avoid violating the size condition.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can split the array into groups of equal sizes. For each group, we need to permute the indices within the group such that no one gets their own.\n\nFor example, in the case [2,2,3,3], the groups are [2,2] and [3,3]. Each group can be deranged among themselves. So for the first group, swap 1 and 2. For the second group, swap 3 and4. The overall permutation is [2,1,4,3].\n\nThis works.\n\nAnother example: [2,2,3,3,3]. The groups are [2,2], [3,3,3]. The first group can be swapped. The second group of 3 elements can be arranged in a cycle: 3\u21924\u21925\u21923. So permutation for the second group would be [4,5,3]. So the overall permutation would be [2,1,4,5,3].\n\nCheck:\n\nStudent3 (3) gets 4's shoe (3) okay.\n\nStudent4 (3) gets5's (3) okay.\n\nStudent5 (3) gets3's (3) okay.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Split the array into groups of consecutive equal elements.\n\n- For each group, derange the indices within the group.\n\n- If any group has size 1, then it's impossible (since you can't derange a single element).\n\nWait, but the groups must have at least two elements to derange. So if any group has size 1, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the first condition already ensures that the last group has at least two elements (since s[-1] is not greater than s[-2], so the last group has at least two elements). But other groups could have size 1.\n\nWait, for example, the array [1,2,2]. The first group is [1], which has size 1. So the first student (1) must get a shoe from someone else. The available shoes are 2 and 2. So they can take either. But the second student (2) can't take their own, so they have to take the third's. The third can take the second's.\n\nSo permutation could be [2,3,2]. Wait no, that's invalid because 3 can't take their own. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the array is [1,2,2].\n\nGroups are [1], [2,2].\n\nThe first group (size 1) can't be deranged within itself. So the first student must take a shoe from another group. Since their size is 1, any shoe is okay (since all are >=1). So they can take the second or third's shoe.\n\nSuppose the first takes the second's shoe (2). Then the second must take the third's (2), and the third takes the first's (1). But the third's shoe is 2, so they can take the first's (1) which is less than their own. That's invalid.\n\nAh, right. So the third student's shoe must be >= their own size (2). So they can't take the first's shoe (1).\n\nSo in this case, the first student (size1) can take the second or third's shoe (size2). The second and third (size2) must take shoes from others in their group or higher.\n\nWait, the second and third are in the same group. So they can swap. So the permutation could be [2,3,1].\n\nCheck:\n\nStudent1 (1) gets 2's shoe (2) okay.\n\nStudent2 (2) gets3's (2) okay.\n\nStudent3 (2) gets1's (1) which is less than 2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo that's bad.\n\nHmm, so this approach may not work here.\n\nWait, so the problem arises when a group has size 1 (the first group here). The student in that group can take a shoe from another group, but the students in the other groups must also be able to get shoes that meet their conditions.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the initial approach of checking the last element's condition is necessary, but there are other conditions.\n\nWait, in the example [1,2,2], the last element is 2, which is same as the second last. So the first condition is okay. But the first group has size 1. So how to handle this?\n\nThe first student (1) can take the second's shoe (2). The second student (2) can take the third's (2). The third student (2) must take someone else's. The only options are first or second. But first's shoe is 1 <2, so can't take that. So the third must take the second's shoe, but that's already taken by the second. So no solution.\n\nWait, so in this case, is there a valid permutation?\n\nLet me see:\n\nPossible permutations:\n\nWe need to assign p such that:\n\np[1] !=1, p[2] !=2, p[3] !=3.\n\nEach p_i's shoe must be >= their own size.\n\nStudent1 (1) can take any except 1. So 2 or3.\n\nStudent2 (2) must take 1 or3 (but their shoe must be >=2. So 3's shoe is 2, so okay.\n\nStudent3 (2) must take 1 or2. But their shoe must be >=2. So can't take 1's shoe (1 <2). So must take 2's shoe (2's shoe is 2). But then p[3] =2. But then p[2] can't be 3 (since p[2] must be 3 or1? Let's see:\n\nSuppose:\n\np1=2 (student1 takes 2's shoe (2). okay.\n\np2=3 (student2 takes3's shoe (2). okay.\n\np3=1 \u2192 but student3's shoe is 1 <2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAlternatively, p3=2 \u2192 but then p2 can't be 3? Let's see:\n\np3=2 \u2192 then p2 must be 1 or3. If p2 is 1, then:\n\np1=2, p2=1, p3=2 \u2192 but p3=2 is same as p1=2 \u2192 duplicate. Not allowed.\n\nHmm, so no valid permutation exists for this case?\n\nWait, but according to the problem's conditions, the first student can take any shoe except their own. The third student must get a shoe of size >=2. The only available shoes are 2 and 3's shoes (both size2). But the third can't take their own (3's shoe is 2, but their own is 3's shoe? Wait, the third student's own shoe is the third's. So the third student can't take their own (3's shoe is 2, but their own is the third's shoe. So they can't take p3=3.\n\nSo the third must take either 1 or 2's shoe. But 1's shoe is 1 <2 \u2192 invalid. So the third must take 2's shoe (size2). But then the second student can't take their own (2's shoe is 2). So the second must take 1 or3's shoe. If the second takes 3's shoe (size2), then the third takes 2's shoe. So:\n\np1=2 (okay)\n\np2=3 (okay)\n\np3=2 \u2192 but that would mean p3=2, which is allowed (since it's not their own index 3). But then p2=3 and p3=2 \u2192 that's okay. But then the third's shoe is s[2] (since p3=2 \u2192 s[2] is 2, which is okay.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\np = [2,3,2]. Wait no, that's invalid because p3=2 is allowed (since it's not their own index 3). But the permutation must be a permutation of 1,2,3. So the elements must be distinct. So p3=2 would conflict with p1=2. So that's not allowed.\n\nAh right, the permutation must be a permutation, so all elements must be unique.\n\nSo in this case, it's impossible. So the answer would be -1.\n\nBut according to the first condition, the last element is 2, which is same as the second last. So the first condition is okay. But there's a group of size 1 (the first element), which causes the problem.\n\nSo the initial approach's conditions are not sufficient. We need to ensure that all groups have size at least 2?\n\nWait, but the first group can be size 1, but the other groups must be able to accommodate the first student's choice.\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe problem requires that for each student i, s[p_i] >= s[i], and p_i !=i.\n\nThe array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can construct the permutation as follows:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1, except for the last which is 1.\n\nBut this works only if s[1] >= s[n], which is only possible if all elements are same.\n\nSo that's not helpful.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince the array is sorted, for each i, the minimal possible j where s[j] >= s[i] is i. So to avoid taking their own, we can take j = i+1 if possible.\n\nBut for the last element, since s[n] is the maximum, they must take someone else's shoe with the same size. So the last element must have at least one other element with the same size (which we already checked).\n\nSo for the last element, they can take the previous one's shoe (n-1).\n\nNow, for the first n-1 elements:\n\nWe can try to shift them to the right, except the last element which takes the first.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nExample [2,2,3,3].\n\np = [2,3,4,1].\n\nCheck:\n\nStudent4 (3) gets 1's shoe (2 <3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nNo good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the problem's first note:\n\nWhen all elements are the same, any derangement works. So the cyclic shift works.\n\nWhen elements are not all same, but the last element is not greater than the second last, then perhaps we can do the following:\n\nPair each student with the next one, except the last which pairs with the first.\n\nBut only if the first's shoe is acceptable for the last.\n\nWait, but the first's shoe is s[0], which must be >= s[-1]. Which is only possible if all are same.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nWe can construct the permutation as follows:\n\nFor i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1 if i <n, else p[i] =1.\n\nBut this is the cyclic shift. This works only if for all i, s[i+1] >= s[i], which is true, but also s[1] >= s[n].\n\nWhich is only possible if all elements are same.\n\nSo that's not helpful.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can pair each student with the next one in the array, but for the last student, pair with the first student only if the first's shoe is acceptable.\n\nWait, but that's not possible unless the first's shoe is >= last's.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can construct the permutation as follows:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1 if i <n, else p[i] =1.\n\nBut then check if this permutation is valid.\n\nIf not, then try another approach.\n\nBut this may not work for most cases.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to construct the permutation as follows:\n\nIf all elements are the same, then do the cyclic shift.\n\nElse:\n\nWe can try to pair each student with the next one, except for the last student who pairs with the first student only if the first's shoe is acceptable.\n\nBut this may not work.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible solution:\n\nThe permutation can be constructed by swapping adjacent elements, except for the last element which swaps with the first if needed.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, here's an algorithm that works for the cases where the array is non-decreasing and the last element is not greater than the second last:\n\nThe permutation can be constructed as follows:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n-1:\n\np[i] = i+1\n\np[n] =1\n\nBut this works only if s[1] >= s[n], which is only possible if all elements are same.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern or think of the problem differently.\n\nThe problem requires that each student gets a shoe of size >= their own, and not their own.\n\nThe array is sorted, so s is non-decreasing.\n\nThe necessary conditions are:\n\n1. n >=2 (since n=1 is impossible).\n\n2. The last element's size is not greater than the second last. (so that the last student can get a shoe from someone else with the same size).\n\n3. For every student i, there exists at least one j !=i with s[j] >= s[i].\n\nBut since the array is sorted, for any i, s[i] <= s[j] for j >=i. So the only problematic case is when the last student's s is greater than all others except themselves. Which is handled by condition 2.\n\nNow, assuming these conditions are met, how to construct the permutation.\n\nPerhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can construct the permutation as follows:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\np[i] = i+1 if i <n, else p[i] =1.\n\nBut this is the cyclic shift. However, this will only work if s[1] >= s[n].\n\nWhich is only possible if all elements are same.\n\nSo that's not helpful.\n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the problem's first note:\n\nWhen all elements are the same, any derangement works. So for other cases, perhaps we can find a way to pair students with others in the same size group.\n\nFor example, group the students by their sizes. For each group of size m, we need to derange the indices within the group.\n\nIf any group has size 1, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, this is a key point!\n\nBecause if a group has size 1 (i.e., a unique size), then the student in that group must take a shoe from another group. But the other groups have higher or equal sizes.\n\nWait, but the student in the unique group can take a shoe from a higher group. But the students in the higher groups must also be able to get shoes.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the student in the unique group can take a shoe from a higher group, but the students in the higher group may not have enough options.\n\nHmm, but let's think of the example [1,2,2].\n\nThe groups are [1], [2,2].\n\nThe first group has size 1. The student in this group (1) can take a shoe from the second group (2 or 2). The second group has two students. They can swap.\n\nSo the permutation could be [2,3,1].\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStudent1 (1) takes 2's shoe (2) \u2192 okay.\n\nStudent2 (2) takes3's shoe (2) \u2192 okay.\n\nStudent3 (2) takes1's shoe (1) \u2192 which is less than 2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAh, so that's not valid.\n\nSo the third student can't take the first's shoe. So the third must take the second's shoe.\n\nSo permutation [2,3,1] is invalid.\n\nAnother option: [3,1,2].\n\nStudent1 takes3's shoe (2) \u2192 okay.\n\nStudent2 takes1's shoe (1) \u2192 which is less than 2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother option: [2,3,1] \u2192 no.\n\nWait, what if the permutation is [2,1,3].\n\nStudent3's p is3 \u2192 which is their own \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother option: [3,2,1].\n\nStudent1 takes3's shoe (2) \u2192 okay.\n\nStudent2 takes2's shoe \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo it's impossible. So the answer is -1.\n\nBut according to the conditions:\n\nThe last element is 2, which is same as second last. So condition 2 is met.\n\nBut the first group has size 1. So the problem arises because the first group's student can't be paired with others without causing a problem.\n\nSo the necessary conditions are not just the last element's condition, but also that all groups have size at least 2?\n\nWait, if all groups have size at least 2, then we can derange within each group.\n\nSo the necessary conditions are:\n\n- n >=2.\n\n- The last element is not greater than the second last.\n\n- All groups (of equal sizes) have size at least 2.\n\nIf these are met, then it's possible.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point I missed earlier.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if n ==1 \u2192 -1.\n\n2. Check if s[-1] > s[-2] \u2192 -1.\n\n3. Check that for every size in the array, the count of that size is at least 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the groups are consecutive? Or any group of the same size?\n\nWait, the groups are all elements with the same size. So for example, in [1,2,2], the group of 1 has size 1, so it's invalid.\n\nThus, the third condition is that every size in the array occurs at least twice.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case [2,2,3,3], the sizes 2 and 3 each occur twice \u2192 okay.\n\nIn the case [2,2,2], each size occurs three times \u2192 okay.\n\nBut in the case [1,2,2], the size 1 occurs once \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the third condition is that every size in the array occurs at least twice.\n\nWait, but what about the case [2,2,3,3,3]. The size 3 occurs three times \u2192 okay.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the necessary conditions are:\n\n- n >=2.\n\n- s[-1] <= s[-2].\n\n- Every size in the array occurs at least twice.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, output -1.\n\nOtherwise, construct the permutation by deranging within each group.\n\nSo how to check this?\n\nWe can count the frequency of each size. If any frequency is 1 \u2192 output -1.\n\nWait, but the array is sorted, so we can check for consecutive elements.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate through the array and check for any element that appears only once.\n\nBut since the array is sorted, we can do this efficiently.\n\nFor example:\n\nInitialize prev = s[0], count =1.\n\nThen for each element from s[1] to s[n-1]:\n\nif current == prev \u2192 count +=1.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if count ==1 \u2192 if yes, return -1.\n\nset prev = current, count=1.\n\nAfter the loop, check the last count.\n\nIf any count is 1 \u2192 return -1.\n\nSo this is a necessary condition.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read n and the array s.\n\n- Check if n ==1 \u2192 -1.\n\n- Check if s[-1] > s[-2] \u2192 -1.\n\n- Check if any size occurs exactly once \u2192 -1.\n\nElse:\n\nConstruct the permutation by deranging within each group.\n\nHow to derange within each group?\n\nFor a group of size m (even or odd), we can do a cyclic shift or swap adjacent pairs.\n\nFor example, for a group of size m:\n\nThe indices in the group are from start to end.\n\nWe can shift each element to the next position, and the last to the first.\n\nFor example, group [a,b,c,d] \u2192 becomes [b,c,d,a].\n\nThis is a derangement as long as m>1.\n\nWait, for m=2: [a,b] \u2192 [b,a] \u2192 derangement.\n\nFor m=3: [a,b,c] \u2192 [b,c,a]. Each element is not in their original position.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm for the permutation is:\n\nLoop through the array, and for each group of consecutive same elements:\n\n- For the group's indices, shift them cyclically.\n\nFor example:\n\nGroup starts at i and ends at j (indices).\n\nThe permutation for these indices would be:\n\nfor k in i to j-1:\n\np[k] = k+1\n\np[j] =i.\n\nThis way, each element is shifted to the next, and the last points to the first.\n\nThis ensures that no one is in their original position.\n\nThus, the permutation can be built by applying this to each group.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nThe given code for program1.py is incomplete. Let's see what the current code does.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    ans =[]\n\n    arr = [int(c) for c in input().split()]\n\n    j = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if i == j:continue\n\n        if arr[i] == arr[j]:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            if i == j+1:\n\n                print(-1)\n\n                break\n\n            else:\n\n                # print(list(range(j,i)))\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    else:\n\n        if n==j+1:\n\n            print(-1)\n\n        else:   \n\n            ls = list(range(j+1,n+1))\n\n            newls = [ls[-1]]+ls[0:-1]\n\n            ans.extend(newls)\n\n            print(*ans)\n\nHmm, this code seems to be trying to find the first point where the elements change. The variable j is probably tracking the start of the current group.\n\nThe loop for i in range(n):\n\n- if i ==j \u2192 skip.\n\n- if arr[i] == arr[j], continue (so j remains the same).\n\n- else, if i is j+1 \u2192 then the previous group has length 1 \u2192 so print -1.\n\nElse, do something.\n\nThe 'else' clause after the for loop is executed only if the loop didn't break.\n\nThen, if n ==j+1 \u2192 print -1.\n\nElse, create a list from j+1 to n, then rotate it and add to ans.\n\nThis code is probably trying to handle the case where all elements are the same, but it's not clear.\n\nThe code seems to have some logic for checking if there's a group of size 1.\n\nThe 'if i ==j+1' case would trigger when the first group has size 1 (since j is the start, and the next element is different).\n\nThus, the code is checking for groups of size 1 and returns -1.\n\nBut the code may not handle all cases.\n\nThe correct approach would be to first check the conditions:\n\n- n==1 \u2192 -1.\n\n- s[-1] > s[-2] \u2192 -1.\n\n- any group has size 1 \u2192 -1.\n\nIf all conditions are met, then construct the permutation by shifting each group.\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified to implement this.\n\nBut given the current code structure, perhaps the missing parts are in the 'TODO' sections.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\nThe code is trying to find the first point where the value changes.\n\nThe variable j starts at 0.\n\nFor each i:\n\nif i ==j \u2192 skip (since j is the start of the current group).\n\nif arr[i] == arr[j], continue (so the group continues).\n\nElse:\n\nif i == j+1 \u2192 then the current group has length 1 (since from j to i-1 is length 1).\n\nThus, this would trigger a print(-1).\n\nElse:\n\nThe code has a TODO.\n\nPerhaps the code is trying to check for groups of size 1.\n\nThe 'else' part (when the loop completes without breaking):\n\nThen, it checks if n ==j+1 \u2192 which would mean the last group has size 1.\n\nElse, it constructs a list from j+1 to n, then rotates it.\n\nThis part is probably for the case where all elements are the same (so j is 0, and the group is the entire array).\n\nThen, the code creates a list from j+1 (1) to n \u2192 [2,3,...n], then newls is [n, 2,3,...n-1].\n\nThus, the permutation is [n, 2,3,...n-1].\n\nWait, for n=4, this would be [4,2,3,1].\n\nWhich is a cyclic shift.\n\nThis works for the all-same case.\n\nBut for other cases, the code may not handle them.\n\nThe problem is that the current code only checks for the first group's size and the last group's size.\n\nBut the other groups may have size 1.\n\nThus, the code is incomplete.\n\nThe missing parts are:\n\n- Checking for any group of size 1 (other than the first and last).\n\n- Constructing the permutation by shifting each group.\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified to:\n\nFirst, check all groups for size 1.\n\nThen, construct the permutation by shifting each group.\n\nBut given the current code structure, perhaps the missing code in the 'TODO' section is to check for groups of size 1.\n\nAlternatively, the code may need to be rewritten.\n\nBut since the user wants only the missing code parts, I need to see where the code is incomplete.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe loop for i in range(n):\n\n    if i == j: continue\n\n    if arr[i] == arr[j]: continue\n\n    else:\n\n        if i == j+1:\n\n            print(-1)\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe 'else' part here is when the current element is different from the group's start, and the group has length >1.\n\nBut what to do here?\n\nPerhaps the code is trying to check for groups of size 1.\n\nThe 'if i ==j+1' case is when the group from j to i-1 has length 1 (since i is j+1 and the element is different).\n\nThus, this triggers a -1.\n\nThe else part (when i is not j+1) means that the current group has length >1, so it's okay.\n\nBut then, after this loop, the code proceeds to check if n ==j+1 \u2192 which would mean the last group has size 1.\n\nThus, the code is checking for groups of size 1 in the first and last groups.\n\nBut what about groups in the middle?\n\nFor example, in the array [2,2,1,1], the middle group (the 1's) would be okay, but if there's a group like [2,2,3,3,4,4,5], then the last group has size 1 \u2192 which is caught by the n==j+1 check.\n\nBut if there's a group in the middle with size 1, like [2,2,3,4,4], then the third element (3) forms a group of size 1 \u2192 which is not detected by the current code.\n\nThus, the current code is incorrect.\n\nThe correct approach requires checking all groups for size 1.\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified to track all groups and check their sizes.\n\nBut given the current code structure, perhaps the missing code in the 'TODO' section is to check for groups of size 1.\n\nAlternatively, the code may need to be restructured.\n\nBut since the user wants only the missing code parts, perhaps the 'TODO' section should be filled with code that checks for groups of size 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the first group that has a size of 1, and then return -1.\n\nThe current code's loop is trying to find the first point where the value changes.\n\nWhen it finds a new value (arr[i] != arr[j]), it checks if the previous group (from j to i-1) has length 1.\n\nIf so, returns -1.\n\nElse, continues.\n\nThus, this loop is checking for groups of size 1 in the first part of the array.\n\nThe 'else' clause after the loop checks the last group.\n\nThus, this code is checking all groups for size 1.\n\nBecause:\n\n- The loop processes each group in order.\n\n- For each group, when the next element is different, it checks if the current group (from j to i-1) has length 1 (i-j ==1 \u2192 i =j+1).\n\n- If yes, returns -1.\n\n- Then, j is updated to i, and the process continues.\n\nThus, this loop checks all groups except the last one.\n\nThe 'else' clause after the loop checks the last group (from j to n-1).\n\nIf the last group has length 1 (n-j ==1 \u2192 j =n-1 \u2192 n==j+1 \u2192 yes), then returns -1.\n\nThus, this code correctly checks all groups for size 1.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct for checking the conditions.\n\nNow, the code proceeds to construct the permutation.\n\nIn the 'else' clause (when all groups are okay):\n\nThe code does:\n\nls = list(range(j+1, n+1)) \u2192 but j is the start of the last group.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is assuming that all groups are of size >=2, and constructs the permutation by rotating each group.\n\nBut the current code's construction is only for the case where all elements are the same (since j is 0, and the group is the entire array).\n\nThus, the code's construction part is incorrect.\n\nThe current code's construction is:\n\nls = list(range(j+1, n+1)) \u2192 for example, if j is 0 (all elements same), then ls is [2,3,...n].\n\nnewls = [ls[-1]] + ls[0:-1] \u2192 which is [n, 2,3,...n-1].\n\nThus, the permutation is [n,2,3,...n-1].\n\nThis is a cyclic shift.\n\nBut for other cases, like groups of varying sizes, this code won't work.\n\nThus, the code needs to construct the permutation by shifting each group.\n\nThe current code's construction is only for the all-same case.\n\nThus, the missing code is in the construction part.\n\nThe code needs to loop through each group and apply the cyclic shift.\n\nThus, the code should track the groups and for each group, shift the indices.\n\nBut given the current code structure, perhaps the code should be modified to track the groups and construct the permutation accordingly.\n\nBut since the user wants only the missing code parts, perhaps the 'TODO' section is not needed (since the code's loop already checks for groups of size 1), and the missing part is in the construction.\n\nThe current code's construction is only for the all-same case.\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified to handle all cases.\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\nFor each group:\n\n- The indices of the group are from start to end.\n\n- The permutation for these indices is shifted: each element points to the next, and the last points to the first.\n\nThus, for a group from a to b (0-based indices):\n\nfor i in a to b:\n\n    p[i] = a + (i -a +1) % (b-a+1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to create a list for the group's permutation.\n\nFor example, group indices are [x, x+1, ..., y].\n\nThe permutation for this group is [x+1, x+2, ..., y, x].\n\nThus, the permutation for the group is the elements shifted right by one, with the last element going to the first position.\n\nThus, the code needs to track the groups and apply this shift.\n\nBut how to implement this in the current code.\n\nThe current code's 'else' clause after the loop has:\n\nif n ==j+1 \u2192 which is already handled.\n\nElse:\n\n    ls = list(range(j+1, n+1)) \u2192 this is for the last group.\n\n    newls = [ls[-1]] + ls[0:-1]\n\n    ans.extend(newls)\n\n    print(*ans)\n\nThis is only for the last group.\n\nBut the other groups are not handled.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect.\n\nThe correct approach is to process all groups.\n\nThus, the code should track the groups and for each group, apply the shift.\n\nBut given the current code's structure, perhaps the code should be modified to track the groups and build the permutation.\n\nBut since the user wants only the missing code parts, perhaps the 'TODO' section is not needed, and the missing code is in the construction part.\n\nThe current code's construction is only for the case where all elements are the same.\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified to handle all groups.\n\nThe code's current construction is:\n\nls = list(range(j+1, n+1)) \u2192 which is for the last group.\n\nBut the other groups are not handled.\n\nThus, the code should loop through all groups and apply the shift.\n\nBut given the current code's structure, perhaps the code should be modified to track the groups and build the permutation.\n\nBut since I can't rewrite the entire code, perhaps the missing code is in the 'TODO' section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's 'TODO' section is where the code should handle the case when a group has size >1 but not the first.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's 'TODO' section is where the code should continue processing the groups.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's 'TODO' section is where the code should check for other conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's 'TODO' section is where the code should handle the case when the current group has length >1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's 'TODO' section is where the code should continue processing the groups.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to construct the permutation by shifting each group.\n\nThus, the code should track the groups and for each group, shift the indices.\n\nThe current code's loop is tracking the groups and their start and end.\n\nThus, the code can be modified to build the permutation by processing each group.\n\nBut since the user wants only the missing code parts, perhaps the code's construction part should be replaced with code that builds the permutation by shifting each group.\n\nThus, the missing code for program1.py is in the 'else' clause after the loop.\n\nThe current code's construction is only for the last group.\n\nThe correct code should process all groups.\n\nThus, the code should track the groups and for each group, shift the indices.\n\nThus, the code can be modified as follows:\n\nAfter the loop, the code has the variable j which is the start of the last group.\n\nBut to track all groups, we need to track the start and end of each group.\n\nThus, perhaps the code should be modified to track the groups.\n\nBut given the current code's structure, perhaps the code can be modified to build the permutation by shifting each group.\n\nThe current code's loop is:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if i == j: continue\n\n    if arr[i] == arr[j]: continue\n\n    else:\n\n        if i == j+1:\n\n            print(-1)\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n            j = i\n\n            # add the previous group to a list of groups\n\n            # but this is not done in the current code.\n\nThus, the code is not tracking the groups.\n\nThus, the missing code in the 'TODO' section is to update j to the new group's start and possibly track the groups.\n\nThus, the code should have:\n\nelse:\n\n    j = i\n\n    # add the previous group to a list of groups.\n\nBut since the current code doesn't track groups, perhaps the 'TODO' section should be:\n\nj = i\n\nThus, the code would track the start of each new group.\n\nThus, the 'TODO' section's code is:\n\nj = i\n\nThus, the code would track the groups.\n\nThen, after the loop, the code can process all groups.\n\nBut the current code's construction is only for the last group.\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified to process all groups.\n\nBut since the user wants only the missing code parts, perhaps the 'TODO' section is to set j =i.\n\nThus, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\nIn the 'TODO' section:\n\nj = i\n\nThus, the code would track the start of each new group.\n\nThen, after the loop, the code can process all groups.\n\nBut the current code's construction is only for the last group.\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified to process all groups.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct missing code for program1.py is:\n\nIn the 'TODO' section:\n\nj = i\n\nThus, the code would track the groups.\n\nThen, the construction part needs to be modified to process all groups.\n\nBut the user's code's construction is in the 'else' clause after the loop.\n\nThus, the code's construction part should be replaced with code that processes all groups.\n\nBut since the user wants only the missing code, perhaps the 'TODO' section is the only missing part.\n\nThus, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\nIn the 'TODO' section:\n\nj = i\n\nThus, the code would track the groups.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of teams that can be formed such that each team's sum (after setting all elements to the maximum) is > D.\n\nThe approach is to sort the array in non-decreasing order.\n\nThen, use a greedy approach: pair the largest elements with smaller ones to form teams where the sum exceeds D.\n\nThe optimal way is to pair the largest elements first.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order.\n\nUse two pointers: left and right.\n\nInitialize left to 0, right to n-1.\n\nCount the number of teams.\n\nWhile left <= right:\n\n- Take the largest element (p[right]).\n\n- The required number of elements in the team is ceil(D / p[right]).\n\n- But since we can only use elements <= p[right], we need to find how many elements from the left can be paired with this to form a team.\n\nWait, the team's maximum is p[right], so each element in the team contributes p[right] to the sum.\n\nThe sum must be > D.\n\nThus, the number of elements needed is the smallest k such that k * p[right] > D.\n\nThe minimal k is floor(D/p[right]) +1.\n\nBut we can't have k elements larger than p[right], but since the array is sorted, all elements up to right are <= p[right].\n\nThus, we need to find the smallest k such that k * p[right] > D.\n\nThe minimal k is ceil(D/p[right]) +1? No, wait:\n\nk must be the smallest integer where k * max > D.\n\nThus, k = floor(D / max) +1.\n\nFor example, if D=5 and max=3 \u2192 5/3=1.666 \u2192 floor is 1 \u2192 k=2 \u2192 2*3=6>5.\n\nThus, the required k is ceil(D/max).\n\nWait, ceil(D/max) gives the minimal k.\n\nThus, the required number of elements is ceil(D / p[right]).\n\nBut we need to have at least that many elements.\n\nWe can take the largest element (p[right]), and then take the next (k-1) elements from the left.\n\nIf there are enough elements (left + (k-1) <= right), then we can form a team.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order.\n\nInitialize left=0, right =n-1, count=0.\n\nWhile left <= right:\n\n    current_max = p[right]\n\n    required = ceil(D / current_max)\n\n    if required ==0: # current_max > D \u2192 required is 1.\n\n        required =1\n\n    if required ==1:\n\n        count +=1\n\n        right -=1\n\n    else:\n\n        if (right - left +1) >= required:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            right -=1\n\n            left += (required-1)\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\nReturn count.\n\nWait, but how to compute required:\n\nrequired = ceil(D / current_max).\n\nBut in code:\n\nrequired = (D + current_max -1) // current_max\n\nBecause (D + current_max -1) // current_max is the ceiling.\n\nThus:\n\nrequired = (D + current_max -1) // current_max\n\nIf required is 1:\n\nThen, the team can be formed with just the current_max.\n\nThus, count +=1, and move right.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to take the current_max and (required-1) elements from the left.\n\nIf there are enough elements (left + (required-1) <= right):\n\nThen, count +=1.\n\nMove right by 1 (since we took the current_max).\n\nMove left by (required-1).\n\nElse:\n\nCan't form this team, so break.\n\nThus, this is the algorithm.\n\nThe given code for program2.py is:\n\nd = int(input().split(\" \")[1])\n\np = sorted(map(int, input().split(\" \")))\n\nc = 0\n\nl = 0\n\nr = len(p) -
