        "text": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first. So, the problem for program1 is to determine whether the last stripe painted on an 8x8 grid was red or blue. The input gives the grid after all stripes have been painted. The key point here is that when a stripe is painted, it overwrites any previous colors. So, the last stripe's color will be visible in all the cells of that stripe. The approach here should be to check each row and column to see if there's a row that's entirely red. If such a row exists, then a red stripe was painted last. Similarly, check each column for being entirely blue. Wait, but how do we differentiate between the two possibilities? Wait, the problem says that red stripes are horizontal (so each is a full row) and blue are vertical (full columns).",

Test case \"WRW\" \u2192 the non-W segments are \"W\" (no, the segments are \"W\" and \"W\" but they are separated by R? Wait, no. Wait, the string \"WRW\" has two W's separated by an R. \n\nThe non-W segments are the single 'R' in the middle. That's a segment of length 1 \u2192 invalid. So the answer is NO. Another test case: \"WW\" \u2192 all W's \u2192 valid (YES). Another test case: \"RB\" \u2192 valid (YES). Another test case: \"BR\" \u2192 valid (YES). Another test case: \"RBRB\" \u2192 valid. Another test case: \"B\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 invalid. So this seems to work. Now, what about a segment like \"BRBRB\" (5 characters) \u2192 alternating \u2192 valid. Another case: \"BRBWB\" \u2192 the segments are \"BRB\" and \"B\". The second segment is length 1 \u2192 invalid. So the overall answer is NO. Therefore, the algorithm is: For each test case: \n\n- Split the string into non-W segments. \n\n- For each segment: \n\n   - If length <2 \u2192 return NO. \n\n   - Check if the segment is alternating between R and B. \n\n   - The first two characters must be either 'RB' or 'BR'. - Then every next character must alternate. If all segments pass, return YES, else NO. Additionally, the entire string can have W's anywhere, as long as the non-W segments meet the above. Now, how to implement this in code.

So the code's current approach of taking [2::2] would get s1, s3, etc. But the code is missing the part where it reads the n, but perhaps the n is not needed because the string's length is given as n. \n\nWait, the problem says that the input for each test case is n followed by s of length n. So the code can ignore n, since the length of s is n. Therefore, the code can process each s as the even lines after the first line. The current code's first line is: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\nThis would read the s strings correctly. Then, the code needs to process each s. The code needs to output \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each. So the plan is: For each s: \n\n   split into non-W segments. for each segment in segments: \n\n      if len <2 \u2192 no \n\n      check if it is alternating. if all pass \u2192 yes else no \n\nNow, how to split into segments. We can iterate through the string and collect the segments. For example: \n\nsegments = [] \n\ncurrent_segment = [] \n\nfor c in s: \n\n   if c == 'W': \n\n      if current_segment: \n\n          segments.append(''.join(current_segment)) \n\n          current_segment = [] \n\n   else: \n\n      current_segment.append(c) if current_segment: \n\n   segments.append(''.join(current_segment)) Then, for each segment in segments: \n\n   if len <2 \u2192 return NO \n\n   check alternation. To check alternation: \n\ndef is_alternating(segment): \n\n   if len(segment) <2: \n\n      return False \n\n   first = segment[0] \n\n   second = segment[1] \n\n   if first == second: \n\n      return False \n\n   for i in range(2, len(segment)): \n\n      if segment[i] ! = segment[i-2]: \n\n          return False \n\n   return True \n\nWait, because the sequence must alternate between the first and second characters. For example, \"BRB\" \u2192 B R B \u2192 the third character must be B (same as first). Yes. Another example: \"RBRB\" \u2192 R B R B \u2192 alternates. Another example: \"BRBR\" \u2192 B R B R \u2192 alternates. Another example: \"RR\" \u2192 first two are same \u2192 invalid.",

So the code after the for loop's colon must be indented. Thus, the code for program2's completion is the entire block inside the for loop, properly indented. So the code for program2's completion is: \n\n    segments = []\n    current = []\n    for c in s.strip():\n        if c == 'W':\n            if current:\n                segments.append(''.join(current))\n                current = []\n        else:\n            current.append(c)\n    if current:\n        segments.append(''.join(current))\n    valid = True\n    for seg in segments:\n        l = len(seg) if l < 2:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        if seg[0] == seg[1]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        for i in range(2, l):\n            if seg[i] ! = seg[i-2]:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\") Each line must be indented with four spaces (assuming the for loop is at the top level). Thus, the JSON should have the program2's completion as the above code as a string.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nSo, the problem for program1 is to determine whether the last stripe painted on an 8x8 grid was red or blue. The input gives the grid after all stripes have been painted. The key point here is that when a stripe is painted, it overwrites any previous colors. So, the last stripe's color will be visible in all the cells of that stripe. \n\nThe approach here should be to check each row and column to see if there's a row that's entirely red. If such a row exists, then a red stripe was painted last. Similarly, check each column for being entirely blue. Wait, but how do we differentiate between the two possibilities?\n\nWait, the problem says that red stripes are horizontal (so each is a full row) and blue are vertical (full columns). So, if any row is completely red, that must have been painted last because any blue column that passes through that row would have been overwritten by the red row. Conversely, if a column is completely blue, then that column was painted after any red rows that intersect it. \n\nSo the logic is: if there exists a row that's all R, then the last stripe was R. Otherwise, check if there's a column that's all B. If so, then the last was B. But wait, maybe there are both? How can that be?\n\nWait, no. Because if a red row was painted after a blue column, then the red row would overwrite the blue cells in that column. So if a row is all R, then that row must have been the last stripe. Because any blue column that goes through that row would have their cells turned to R by the red row. So the presence of a full red row means R is the last. \n\nSimilarly, if there is a full blue column, but no full red rows, then that column must have been the last. Because if a blue column was painted after any red rows, then those red rows would have their cells in that column turned blue. So the only way a column is all blue is if it was the last stripe, unless there's a red row that covers it. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is: \n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check all 8 rows. If any row is all 'R's, then the answer is R. Because that row was painted last, overwriting any blue in its path.\n\n2. If no such row exists, then check all columns. If any column is all 'B's, then the answer is B. Because that column was the last.\n\n3. If neither exists, then... but the problem states that at least one stripe was painted, so this case can't happen. \n\nWait, but how can that be? Suppose all stripes are red rows except the last one is a blue column. Then the blue column would have overwritten some red cells, but the column would have B's. But the rows that were painted before the blue column would have their cells in that column turned to B. So the column would be all B, so the answer would be B. \n\nSo the code in program1 needs to first check for any all-R rows. If found, set ans to R and break. Else, check columns for all-B. If found, set ans to B. \n\nLooking at the given code for program1:\n\nThe code starts by reading the input into l. Then, the initial ans is \"B\". Then, for each row in l, if the row.count('R') ==8, then the TODO is there. \n\nSo the current code is looping through each row, and when a row with all R is found, what should happen? Probably, set ans to R and break, since that's the answer. \n\nSo in the for loop over rows:\n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R') ==8:\n        ans = \"R\"\n        break  # since once found, we can exit early\n\nThen, after checking all rows, if ans is still B, then check the columns. \n\nWait, the current code doesn't check the columns. So the code is incomplete here. \n\nSo after the loop over the rows, we need to check the columns. \n\nSo after the for loop over the rows, we need to check each column. \n\nHow to check columns? For each column index from 0 to 7, check all 8 rows in that column. \n\nSo after the for row in l loop, perhaps:\n\nif ans == \"B\":  # meaning no all R rows found\n    # check columns for all B\n    found = False\n    for col in range(8):\n        all_b = True\n        for row in l:\n            if row[col] != 'B':\n                all_b = False\n                break\n        if all_b:\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found:\n        ans = \"B\"\n    else:\n        # but according to problem statement, at least one stripe was painted. So this can't happen. \n        # but maybe in some case, like all stripes are red except the last is blue but the blue column isn't all B? No, because the blue column would have been painted last, so it's all B. \n\nWait, if the last stripe is a blue column, then that column must be all B. Because any prior red rows would have their cells in that column overwritten by the blue column. So if the column is all B, then it's the last. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to check columns only if no all R rows were found. \n\nSo the code structure should be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nread the 8x8 grid into l (already done in the code)\n\nans starts as B (default, but maybe better to set after checking?)\n\nWait, the initial code sets ans to \"B\", but then if a row is all R, it should set ans to R. \n\nBut after that, if no rows are all R, then check columns. If any column is all B, then ans is B (so no change needed). But if none of the columns are all B, then that would imply that the last stripe was neither a red row nor a blue column. But the problem says at least one stripe was painted, so this can't happen. \n\nWait, but how can that be? Let's think of a scenario where the last stripe is a blue column, but that column isn't all B. That can't happen because when you paint a blue column, it's vertical, so all 8 cells in that column are painted blue. So the column must be all B. \n\nTherefore, if there are no all R rows, then there must be at least one all B column (since the last stripe must be a blue column). \n\nWait, but what if the last stripe was a red row? Then that row would be all R, so the first check would have found it. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as:\n\nCheck all rows for all R. If found, ans is R. \n\nElse, check columns for all B. If any found, ans is B. \n\nSo the code in program1 needs to add the column checking part. \n\nSo in the code provided, after the for loop over the rows, we need to add code to check columns. \n\nThe current code's for loop over the rows is:\n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R') ==8:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe current code's ans is initialized to \"B\". So the code should set ans to \"R\" when such a row is found, then break. \n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nif row.count('R') ==8:\n    ans = \"R\"\n    break  # exit the loop early\n\nThen, after checking all rows, if ans is still \"B\", then we need to check the columns. \n\nWait, but the code may not have broken out of the loop. So perhaps the code should loop through all rows, and if any row is all R, set ans to R and break. \n\nSo the code for the rows is okay. \n\nThen, after that, if ans is still B, then check the columns. \n\nSo after the for loop over the rows, we can have:\n\nelse:  # no all R rows found, so check columns for all B\n\nWait, no. The code structure is a for loop. So perhaps after the for loop, we can check if ans is still B, then check columns. \n\nWait, the code after the for loop is:\n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R')==8:\n        ans = \"R\"\n        break  # exit the loop\n\nSo after this loop, if ans is \"R\", then we can proceed. \n\nElse, we need to check the columns. \n\nSo after the loop, we can do:\n\nelse: \n\nWait, no. The for loop's else clause runs if the loop didn't break. So perhaps:\n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R') ==8:\n        ans = \"R\"\n        break\nelse:  # no break, so no all R rows\n    # check columns here\n\nWait, that's a good approach. \n\nSo in Python, the else clause after a for loop runs if the loop completed normally (without break). \n\nSo in this case, if the loop breaks (because a row with all R was found), then the else is skipped. \n\nElse, after checking all rows and none had all R, then we enter the else clause, and check the columns. \n\nIn that else clause, we need to check each column for all B. \n\nSo in the else clause:\n\n    # check columns for all B\n    ans = \"B\"  # default, but maybe need to confirm\n    for col in range(8):\n        all_b = True\n        for row in l:\n            if row[col] != 'B':\n                all_b = False\n                break\n        if all_b:\n            # this column is all B, so the answer is B\n            # but since we are in the else clause (no R rows), this is correct\n            ans = \"B\"  # but it's already B, so maybe redundant\n            break  # can break early once found\n    # but if none of the columns are all B, then what? \n\nWait, according to the problem statement, at least one stripe was painted. So if there are no all R rows, then the last stripe must be a blue column, which must be all B. \n\nTherefore, in the else clause, there must be at least one column that is all B. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed by checking each column until it finds one that is all B, and then set ans to B (though it's already B, so maybe not needed). \n\nWait, but the code's initial ans is B. So even if no column is all B, but that can't happen. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as:\n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R') ==8:\n        ans = \"R\"\n        break\nelse:\n    # check columns\n    found = False\n    for col in range(8):\n        all_b = True\n        for r in l:\n            if r[col] != 'B':\n                all_b = False\n                break\n        if all_b:\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        # impossible according to problem constraints, but maybe handle?\n        pass  # but problem says input is valid, so this won't happen\n\nBut since the problem says the input is valid, we can safely assume that in the else case, there is at least one column with all B. \n\nTherefore, the code can just check the columns, and if any is all B, then ans remains B. \n\nWait, but the code's ans is already B. So perhaps no need to do anything. \n\nWait, the code's ans is set to B initially. So in the else clause (no all R rows), the answer must be B, but only if there exists a column that is all B. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is valid, so in this case, there must be at least one such column. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed. \n\nWait, but the code's current ans is B. So even if there are multiple columns with all B, the answer is B. \n\nTherefore, the code can just leave ans as B. \n\nWait, but what if there are both some columns with all B and others not? \n\nThe presence of any column with all B means that the last stripe was a blue column (since that column was painted last). \n\nTherefore, the code can just set ans to B, but only if there exists at least one column with all B. \n\nWait, but in the else clause (no all R rows), the last stripe must be a blue column, so there must be at least one column with all B. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed without changing ans. \n\nWait, but the code's ans is already B. So perhaps the code is okay. \n\nWait, the code's initial ans is B. So if there are no all R rows, then the answer is B. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the last stripe could be a blue column, so the answer is B. \n\nWait, yes. So the code's initial ans is B, and if there are no all R rows, then the answer is B. \n\nWait, but that's exactly what we need. Because in that case, the last stripe must be a blue column, so the answer is B. \n\nWait, but how do we know that there is at least one blue column? Because the problem says that at least one stripe was painted. \n\nSo the code is correct? \n\nWait, no. Because suppose the last stripe was a blue column, so that column is all B. But other columns may have some B and some R. \n\nWait, but the code's initial ans is B, so if there are no all R rows, then the answer is B. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, so the code is actually correct? \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe code's logic is: \n\nInitialize ans to B. \n\nCheck each row. If any row is all R, set ans to R and break. \n\nElse, leave ans as B. \n\nWait, but that's not considering the columns. \n\nWait, the problem is that if the last stripe was a blue column, then the answer is B. But the code's initial ans is B, so even if there are no all R rows, the code would output B. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nWait, but what if the last stripe was a blue column, but there are other blue columns painted before? \n\nThe presence of the last blue column (the one painted last) would have all B in that column. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct. \n\nWait, the code's logic is: \n\nIf any row is all R, then R is the last. \n\nOtherwise, the last must be a blue column, so B. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, but how does that account for the columns? \n\nBecause if the last stripe was a blue column, then that column is all B. \n\nBut the code doesn't check for that. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is valid. So if there are no all R rows, then there must be at least one column that is all B (the last one painted). \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nWait, but what if the last stripe was a blue column, but another blue column was painted after? \n\nNo, because the last stripe is the last one painted. \n\nWait, the code's logic is correct. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample input. \n\nThe first test case's description says that the red stripe was painted after the blue, so the answer is R. \n\nSuppose in that case, there is a row that is all R. So the code would set ans to R. \n\nThe second test case's note says that the last stripe is a blue column, so the answer is B. \n\nIn that case, there are no all R rows, so the code would output B. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nWait, then why is the code in the problem's given code for program1.py not working? \n\nWait, looking back at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code reads the input into l. Then, for each row in l, it checks if the row has 8 R's. If so, then the code would set ans to R and break. \n\nElse, the ans remains B. \n\nSo that's exactly the correct approach. \n\nWait, but then why is the code incomplete? \n\nWait, the code in the problem's program1.py has a TODO in the for loop over the rows. \n\nAh, right. The code currently has:\n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R') ==8:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the user needs to fill in the code here. \n\nSo the correct code here is to set ans to 'R' and break. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is in that loop. \n\nSo the code inside the if should be:\n\nans = \"R\"\nbreak\n\nSo the TODO block should be replaced with those two lines. \n\nTherefore, the program1's missing code is:\n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R') ==8:\n        ans = \"R\"\n        break\n\nWait, but the code after that loop? The code currently has the for loop, and then after that, it just prints ans. \n\nSo the code is okay. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is to replace the TODO with ans = \"R\" and break. \n\nSo the program1's missing code is the lines:\n\nans = \"R\"\nbreak\n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem for program2 is to determine if a given string can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp paints one R and one B in either order. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects two adjacent cells. \n\nThe key is to find if the given string can be formed through such operations. \n\nLet me think of the constraints. \n\nEach stamp application affects two adjacent cells. Each application must turn them into either RB or BR. But since the stamp can be applied multiple times, overlapping, the final colors depend on the parity of the number of times each cell was under a stamp. \n\nWait, but each time a stamp is applied over a pair, the two cells are set to either R and B or B and R. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" \n\nAh, so each application of the stamp on positions i and i+1 will set those two cells to either R and B (in order) or B and R (the stamp can be rotated). \n\nWait, the stamp can be rotated, so each application can choose either BR or RB for the two cells. \n\nWait, but each application must choose one of the two options. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"the stamp can be rotated, i.e. it can be used in both ways: as B R and as R B.\" \n\nSo when you apply the stamp on positions i and i+1, you can choose to set them to BR or RB. \n\nEach application of the stamp on those two cells will overwrite their current colors. \n\nThe question is, given the final string, can it be achieved through any number of such stamp applications (including zero). \n\nHmm. \n\nThe key is to model the possible transitions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final string must satisfy certain conditions. \n\nLet me think of possible observations. \n\nFirst, note that each stamp application affects exactly two adjacent cells. \n\nEach application can set those two cells to either BR or RB. \n\nThe order of applications doesn't matter in terms of the final result, except for the cumulative effect. \n\nWait, but since each application overwrites the cells, the order might matter. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final colors can be represented as the XOR of some choices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final string must satisfy that for every pair of adjacent cells, their colors can be explained by some combination of stamps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must have a certain pattern. \n\nLet me think of possible constraints. \n\nSuppose the final string has a 'W' in some position. Since each stamp application changes the color of the cells under it, the only way a cell remains W is if it was never covered by any stamp. \n\nWait, no. Because each stamp application must set those two cells to either R and B or B and R. So any cell that has been stamped on must be either R or B. \n\nTherefore, any 'W' in the final string must be a cell that was never covered by any stamp. \n\nTherefore, all W's must be isolated in such a way that they are not part of any stamped pair. \n\nWait, but if a cell is W, then it must not have been part of any stamp application. \n\nTherefore, the W's must form regions where they are not adjacent to any other cells that were stamped. \n\nAlternatively, the W's must be in positions where they are not part of any pair that was stamped. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be partitioned into non-overlapping pairs of adjacent cells, each of which is either BR or RB, but that's not necessarily the case because stamps can overlap. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must satisfy that between any two W's, there's some condition. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the final string. \n\nEach cell can be in one of three states: W, R, or B. \n\nFor a cell to be W, it must never have been part of any stamp. \n\nFor a cell to be R or B, it must have been part of at least one stamp, and the last stamp that affected it must have set it to that color. \n\nTherefore, the presence of R or B requires that the cell was part of some stamp. \n\nNow, let's consider the following: \n\nSuppose there is a W in position i. Then, neither i nor i+1 can be part of any stamp that includes them. Because if a stamp was applied to i and i+1, then both would be set to R or B. \n\nWait, but if a stamp was applied to i-1 and i, then the cell i would be set to either R or B. So for cell i to be W, it must not have been part of any stamp. \n\nTherefore, any W must be in a position that is not part of any stamp application. \n\nTherefore, the W's must form a set of positions such that no two W's are adjacent, and also, between any two W's, there must be at least one non-W cell that is part of a stamp. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the W's must be isolated. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that any two adjacent cells cannot both be W. Because if two adjacent cells are both W, then they could have been part of a stamp, but since they are W, they were never stamped. \n\nWait, but two adjacent W's can exist as long as they were never part of any stamp. \n\nHmm, but how can that be? \n\nSuppose the two adjacent cells are W. That means no stamp was ever applied to them. \n\nBut that's allowed. \n\nSo the problem is to find a way to choose a set of overlapping or non-overlapping pairs of adjacent cells, and for each pair, choose to set them to BR or RB, such that after all these operations, the final string is the given s. \n\nThe challenge is to model this. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe final string must satisfy that every non-W cell is part of at least one stamp. \n\nMoreover, for any two adjacent cells, if they are both non-W, then they must form either BR or RB in some order, but not necessarily exactly once. \n\nWait, but each stamp application overwrites the cells. So the final colors depend on the last stamp applied to each cell. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final string must have the property that between any two W's, the non-W cells form a sequence that can be partitioned into pairs of BR or RB. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be viewed as a sequence where every non-W cell is part of a pair, and the pairs can overlap. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions must hold: \n\n1. All W's are isolated in the sense that they are not part of any pair. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. \n\nAlternatively, the key observation is that any R or B must be part of at least one pair. \n\nWait, but how to model this. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the final string. \n\nSuppose the final string has a 'W' at position i. Then, the cell i must not have been part of any stamp. \n\nTherefore, the cells adjacent to i (i-1 and i+1) can be part of stamps, but not involving i. \n\nNow, for the non-W cells: \n\nEach non-W cell must be part of at least one stamp. \n\nMoreover, for any two adjacent non-W cells, they can form a pair (either BR or RB) in the final string. \n\nWait, but the final colors are the result of the last stamp applied to each cell. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe final string can be obtained by some sequence of stamp applications. \n\nEach stamp application affects two adjacent cells, setting them to either BR or RB. \n\nThe final color of each cell is the result of the last stamp that was applied to it. \n\nTherefore, for each cell, the color must be either R or B if it was part of any stamp, or W otherwise. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to checking whether the given string can be represented as the result of such operations. \n\nLet me think of the following necessary conditions: \n\n1. All W's must not be part of any stamp. So, any W must not be in any pair that was stamped. \n\nTherefore, for any W at position i, the cells i-1 and i+1 cannot be part of a stamp that includes i. \n\nWait, but the W at i can be part of a stamp only if it was overwritten by a later stamp. \n\nWait no, because if a stamp was applied to i and i+1, then the cell i would be set to either R or B. So if the final color is W, then that cell was never part of any stamp. \n\nTherefore, the presence of a W at position i means that no stamp was ever applied to i or i-1 (for the left side) or i+1 (for the right side). \n\nWait, more precisely, the cell i can't be part of any stamp. \n\nTherefore, the stamps can't include i in any pair. \n\nTherefore, the W's must be such that they are not part of any pair in any stamp. \n\nTherefore, the W's must be isolated in the sense that they are not adjacent to any other W's? \n\nNo, not necessarily. For example, two W's next to each other can exist as long as neither was part of any stamp. \n\nWait, but if two W's are adjacent, then the pair between them could have been stamped, but since they are W, they were never stamped. \n\nSo that's allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. \n\nThe final string must satisfy that for every position i (except the last), either: \n\nEither the pair (i, i+1) is part of some stamp's last application, or they are both W. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string can be partitioned into some overlapping or non-overlapping pairs, each of which is either BR or RB, such that the final string is the result of applying all these pairs (with the last application overwriting previous ones). \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nPerhaps the key is to look for contradictions. \n\nLet me think of some examples. \n\nTake the sample input's fifth test case (from the problem's note):\n\nThe example's final string is \"BRBB\". \n\nWait, the example's fifth test case's explanation is: \n\nThe steps are WWW \u2192 WRB \u2192 BRB. \n\nWait, the final string is BRB? Or maybe the example is different. \n\nBut regardless, perhaps the key is to find that the string must not have two consecutive W's followed by non-W, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following must hold: \n\nFor any two adjacent cells, if they are both non-W, then they must form either BR or RB. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because suppose a stamp was applied to positions 1-2 as BR, then another stamp to 2-3 as RB. The final colors would be B (from first stamp's first cell), R (from second stamp's first cell), B (from second stamp's second cell). So the middle two cells are R and B, which is RB. \n\nHmm, but the first and second are B and R (BR), and the second and third are R and B (RB). \n\nThe final string is B R B. \n\nThe adjacent pairs are BR and RB. \n\nSo the entire string is allowed. \n\nBut in this case, the first and second are BR, and the second and third are RB. \n\nSo the middle cell is R, which is part of both pairs. \n\nSo the condition that every pair of adjacent non-W cells must form BR or RB is not necessary. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nEach non-W cell must be part of at least one pair (either as left or right in a stamp). \n\nMoreover, the color of each non-W cell must be either R or B, and for each pair of adjacent cells, their colors must be either BR or RB in some stamp's application. \n\nWait, but since the stamps can be applied multiple times, the final colors depend on the last stamp applied to each cell. \n\nThis seems difficult. \n\nPerhaps another approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe final string can be obtained by some sequence of stamps. \n\nEach stamp application can be thought of as choosing a position i (from 0 to n-2), and choosing to set s[i] and s[i+1] to either \"BR\" or \"RB\". \n\nThe final string is the result after all these operations. \n\nThe problem is to determine if such a sequence exists. \n\nNow, to model this, perhaps the following must hold: \n\nFor every position i from 0 to n-1: \n\n- If s[i] is W, then it was never part of any stamp. \n\n- If s[i] is R or B, then it must be the result of the last stamp that included it. \n\nNow, let's think of the W's first. \n\nAll W's must not be part of any stamp. \n\nTherefore, for any W at position i, the stamps cannot include i in any pair. \n\nTherefore, the stamps can only be applied to pairs that do not include any W. \n\nWait, but if a W is at position i, then the pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) cannot be stamped. \n\nTherefore, the W's divide the string into segments of non-W characters, and each such segment must be able to be formed by some stamps. \n\nMoreover, within each such segment (a maximal sequence of non-W characters), the stamps must cover all positions in the segment. \n\nAdditionally, the stamps can only be applied within the segment. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to checking each segment of non-W characters, and ensuring that each such segment can be formed by some sequence of stamps. \n\nNow, the question is: what conditions must a segment of non-W characters satisfy to be formable by stamps? \n\nLet me consider a segment of length m (m >=1). \n\nEach stamp in the segment must be a pair of adjacent cells, and each cell in the segment must be part of at least one stamp. \n\nMoreover, the final colors must be the result of the last stamps applied to each position. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of small cases. \n\nCase 1: segment length 1 (m=1). \n\nThe only cell must be either R or B. \n\nBut to form this, the cell must be part of a stamp. But a stamp requires two adjacent cells. Since the segment is length 1, there are no adjacent cells. \n\nTherefore, it's impossible. \n\nHence, any segment of length 1 (non-W) is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the first condition is that all non-W segments must have even length? No, not necessarily. \n\nWait, for example, a segment of length 3: \n\nSuppose the segment is \"BRB\". \n\nPossible stamps: \n\nApply stamp to positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 \"BRW\" (but the third is W? No, the segment is non-W. \n\nWait, the segment is \"BRB\". \n\nSuppose first apply stamp 0-1 as BR \u2192 \"BR...\", then apply stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 the final would be B (from first stamp's first cell?), no. Wait, the first stamp sets 0 and 1 to B and R. The second stamp on 1-2 would set them to R and B. \n\nSo the final would be B (position 0), R (position 1 from first stamp, then overwritten by second's first?), no. \n\nWait, the second stamp on 1-2 would set position 1 to R and 2 to B. \n\nSo the final string would be B (position 0 from first stamp), R (position 1 from second stamp's first), B (position 2 from second's second). \n\nSo the final is BRB. \n\nSo a segment of length 3 is possible. \n\nHmm, so the length can be odd. \n\nAnother example: segment of length 2: \"RB\". \n\nPossible with one stamp. \n\nSegment of length 3: \"BRB\" as above. \n\nSegment of length 4: \"BRBR\". \n\nPossible with two stamps: first 0-1 as BR, then 2-3 as BR. \n\nAlternatively, other combinations. \n\nHmm. \n\nWhat about a segment of length 1? \n\nImpossible, because you can't apply any stamp to it. \n\nSo any non-W segment of length 1 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the first condition is that all non-W segments must have length >=2? No, because length 3 is allowed. \n\nWait, but length 1 is invalid. \n\nSo the first condition is that all non-W segments must have length >=2? No, because 3 is allowed. \n\nWait, the problem is that for a segment of length 1, it's impossible. \n\nSo the first condition is that all non-W segments must have length >=2? No, because 3 is allowed. \n\nWait, the key is that the segment must be able to be covered by overlapping stamps. \n\nFor a segment of length m, the stamps can overlap. \n\nThe minimal number of stamps needed for a segment of length m is ceil(m/2), but overlapping allows for more flexibility. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe final colors of the segment must alternate between R and B, but not necessarily strictly. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the segment is \"RBRB\". \n\nThis can be formed by applying stamps on 0-1 as RB, then 2-3 as RB. \n\nThe final is R B R B. \n\nAlternatively, applying stamps in overlapping ways. \n\nAnother example: \"BRBR\". \n\nPossible with two stamps. \n\nBut what about a segment like \"RR\"? \n\nIs that possible? \n\nSuppose the segment is \"RR\". \n\nWe need to find a way to apply stamps such that the final is RR. \n\nEach stamp on positions 0-1 must set them to either BR or RB. \n\nSuppose first apply BR: then the cells are B and R. \n\nThen apply RB on the same positions: the first cell becomes R, the second becomes B. \n\nFinal is R B. Not RR. \n\nAlternatively, apply RB first: R B. Then apply BR again: B R. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, can we apply the same pair multiple times? \n\nSuppose first apply RB (R B), then apply RB again. The second application would set them to R B again. So the final is R B. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, is there any way to get RR? \n\nHmm, it seems impossible. \n\nBecause any stamp on the two cells must set them to either BR or RB. \n\nSo the only possible final pairs for two cells are BR or RB. \n\nTherefore, a segment of two cells must be either BR or RB. \n\nSo \"RR\" is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the segment must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, but what about a segment of three cells like \"BRB\"? \n\nThe first and second are B and R (from first stamp), then the second and third are R and B (from second stamp). \n\nThe final is B R B. \n\nSo the first and third are B, and the middle is R. \n\nSo the colors alternate between B and R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother example: \"BRRB\". \n\nIs this possible? \n\nLet's see. \n\nSuppose first apply stamp 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThen apply stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThe first three cells become B (from first stamp's first), R (overwritten by second's first?), no. \n\nWait, after first stamp: positions 0-1 are B R. \n\nThen applying stamp 1-2 as RB would set positions 1 and 2 to R and B. \n\nSo the final after second stamp: \n\nposition 0: B (unchanged), \n\nposition 1: R (from second stamp's first), \n\nposition 2: B (from second's second). \n\nThen, applying a third stamp on 2-3 as BR: \n\nposition 2 becomes B (from third's first?), no. \n\nWait, the third stamp on 2-3 would set them to B and R. \n\nSo after third stamp: \n\nposition 2 is B (third's first), position 3 is R. \n\nSo the final string would be B R B R. \n\nNot the desired BRRB. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not possible. \n\nSo the key observation is that in any segment of non-W characters, the colors must alternate between R and B. \n\nBecause each stamp application on a pair sets them to either BR or RB, which are alternating. \n\nTherefore, the final colors must form an alternating sequence of R and B. \n\nWait, but overlapping stamps can create different patterns. \n\nWait, let's think of the three-cell example \"BRB\". \n\nThe final sequence is B R B, which is alternating. \n\nAnother example: \"RBR\". \n\nWhich is also alternating. \n\nAnother example: \"BRBRB\" (5 characters) \u2192 alternating. \n\nSo perhaps the necessary condition is that the non-W segments must be alternating between R and B. \n\nIf that's the case, then the algorithm is: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Split the string into segments of non-W characters. \n\n- For each such segment: \n\n   - Check if its length is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\n   - Check if the characters alternate between R and B. \n\n   - Also, the first and second characters must be either RB or BR, and so on. \n\nIf all segments satisfy this, then output YES, else NO. \n\nAdditionally, any W's must not be adjacent to any non-W segments in a way that would require them to be part of a stamp. \n\nWait, but the W's are allowed as long as they are not part of any stamp. \n\nWait, the segments of non-W must be separated by W's. \n\nSo the steps for the algorithm would be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n1. Check that all non-W segments have length >=2. \n\n2. Check that each non-W segment is an alternating sequence of R and B. \n\n3. Also, the entire string must not have any two adjacent non-W segments (since they would be separated by W's). \n\nWait, the segments are separated by W's, so that's okay. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n- All non-W segments have length >=2. \n\n- Each non-W segment is an alternating sequence of R and B. \n\n- Additionally, the entire string must not have any W's that are part of a stamped pair. \n\nWait, no, the W's are allowed as long as they are not part of any stamp. \n\nWait, the first two conditions are sufficient? \n\nLet me test some examples. \n\nTest case where the string is \"BRB\" \u2192 valid. \n\nTest case \"RR\" \u2192 invalid (not alternating). \n\nTest case \"BRRB\" \u2192 the segment is length 4, but the sequence is B R R B \u2192 not alternating. So invalid. \n\nTest case \"BRBR\" \u2192 valid. \n\nTest case \"W\" \u2192 valid (since zero stamps needed). \n\nTest case \"WRW\" \u2192 the non-W segments are \"W\" (no, the segments are \"W\" and \"W\" but they are separated by R? Wait, no. \n\nWait, the string \"WRW\" has two W's separated by an R. \n\nThe non-W segments are the single 'R' in the middle. \n\nThat's a segment of length 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the answer is NO. \n\nAnother test case: \"WW\" \u2192 all W's \u2192 valid (YES). \n\nAnother test case: \"RB\" \u2192 valid (YES). \n\nAnother test case: \"BR\" \u2192 valid (YES). \n\nAnother test case: \"RBRB\" \u2192 valid. \n\nAnother test case: \"B\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nNow, what about a segment like \"BRBRB\" (5 characters) \u2192 alternating \u2192 valid. \n\nAnother case: \"BRBWB\" \u2192 the segments are \"BRB\" and \"B\". The second segment is length 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the overall answer is NO. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Split the string into non-W segments. \n\n- For each segment: \n\n   - If length <2 \u2192 return NO. \n\n   - Check if the segment is alternating between R and B. \n\n   - The first two characters must be either 'RB' or 'BR'. \n\n   - Then every next character must alternate. \n\nIf all segments pass, return YES, else NO. \n\nAdditionally, the entire string can have W's anywhere, as long as the non-W segments meet the above. \n\nNow, how to implement this in code. \n\nThe code for program2.py is given as: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe current code is reading the input incorrectly. \n\nThe problem's input for program2 is: \n\nEach test case starts with n, then the string s. \n\nThe code's current approach is to read lines from stdin, but the way it's written may not be correct. \n\nThe user's code for program2 is: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis seems to be trying to read every second line starting from the second line, but perhaps the input format is different. \n\nWait, the input for program2 is: \n\nThe first line is t. \n\nThen, for each test case: \n\n- A line with n. \n\n- A line with the string s. \n\nSo the input lines are: \n\nt \n\nn1 \n\ns1 \n\nn2 \n\ns2 \n\n... \n\nSo the lines are: \n\nLine 0: t \n\nLine 1: n1 \n\nLine 2: s1 \n\nLine 3: n2 \n\nLine4: s2 \n\netc. \n\nTherefore, the strings s are on the even lines after the first line. \n\nSo the code's current approach of taking [2::2] would get s1, s3, etc. \n\nBut the code is missing the part where it reads the n, but perhaps the n is not needed because the string's length is given as n. \n\nWait, the problem says that the input for each test case is n followed by s of length n. \n\nSo the code can ignore n, since the length of s is n. \n\nTherefore, the code can process each s as the even lines after the first line. \n\nThe current code's first line is: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\nThis would read the s strings correctly. \n\nThen, the code needs to process each s. \n\nThe code needs to output \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each. \n\nSo the plan is: \n\nFor each s: \n\n   split into non-W segments. \n\n   for each segment in segments: \n\n      if len <2 \u2192 no \n\n      check if it is alternating. \n\n   if all pass \u2192 yes else no \n\nNow, how to split into segments. \n\nWe can iterate through the string and collect the segments. \n\nFor example: \n\nsegments = [] \n\ncurrent_segment = [] \n\nfor c in s: \n\n   if c == 'W': \n\n      if current_segment: \n\n          segments.append(''.join(current_segment)) \n\n          current_segment = [] \n\n   else: \n\n      current_segment.append(c) \n\nif current_segment: \n\n   segments.append(''.join(current_segment)) \n\nThen, for each segment in segments: \n\n   if len <2 \u2192 return NO \n\n   check alternation. \n\nTo check alternation: \n\ndef is_alternating(segment): \n\n   if len(segment) <2: \n\n      return False \n\n   first = segment[0] \n\n   second = segment[1] \n\n   if first == second: \n\n      return False \n\n   for i in range(2, len(segment)): \n\n      if segment[i] != segment[i-2]: \n\n          return False \n\n   return True \n\nWait, because the sequence must alternate between the first and second characters. \n\nFor example, \"BRB\" \u2192 B R B \u2192 the third character must be B (same as first). \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" \u2192 R B R B \u2192 alternates. \n\nAnother example: \"BRBR\" \u2192 B R B R \u2192 alternates. \n\nAnother example: \"RR\" \u2192 first two are same \u2192 invalid. \n\nAnother example: \"BRRB\" \u2192 first two are BR (okay), but third is R which should be B (since previous is R). \n\nSo the third character is R, which is same as previous \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus, the function is_alternating would return false. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nSo putting it all together. \n\nThe code for program2 would be something like: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    segments = [] \n\n    current = [] \n\n    for c in s.strip(): \n\n        if c == 'W': \n\n            if current: \n\n                segments.append(''.join(current)) \n\n                current = [] \n\n        else: \n\n            current.append(c) \n\n    if current: \n\n        segments.append(''.join(current)) \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for seg in segments: \n\n        if len(seg) <2: \n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n        if seg[0] == seg[1]: \n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n        for i in range(2, len(seg)): \n\n            if seg[i] != seg[i-2]: \n\n                valid = False \n\n                break \n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\") \n\nWait, but the code must read the input correctly. \n\nWait, the code uses s in [*open(0)][2::2], which reads every second line starting from the second line. \n\nBut the first line is t, so the first test case's s is at line 2 (0-based index 2?), so yes. \n\nBut the code may have to process each s correctly. \n\nAlso, note that the input lines may have leading/trailing whitespace, but the problem says that the input strings are correct. \n\nSo using s.strip() is okay. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the input strings are correct, so perhaps just s is sufficient. \n\nWait, the code uses s.strip() because the lines may have newlines. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should process s.rstrip() to remove the trailing newline. \n\nBut in any case, the code should process the string correctly. \n\nNow, let's test this code against the sample inputs. \n\nSample input 2's second test case (from the problem's note): \n\n\"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\" \n\nSuppose the second test case has a string of length 1 (n=1, s=\"W\"). \n\nThen the segments would be empty \u2192 valid \u2192 output YES? \n\nWait, no. The problem says that the second test case has a string that can't be formed. \n\nWait, the note says that for test cases with n=1, it's impossible. \n\nWait, the second test case's input is probably something like \"R\" (n=1). \n\nThen the segment is [\"R\"], length 1 \u2192 invalid \u2192 output NO. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: the fifth example in the note: \n\nThe fifth test case's final string is \"WRB B\" (maybe \"WRBBW\"? Not sure, but the example's explanation shows that it's possible. \n\nAssuming the string is \"WRB B\" (but let's say the string is \"WRBB\"). \n\nThe segments are \"RBB\". \n\nLength 3. \n\nCheck first two: R and B \u2192 okay. \n\nThird character must be R (since previous is B). \n\nBut the third character is B \u2192 so the third character is B, which is same as previous (B?), no. \n\nWait, the third character is B. \n\nThe first is R, second B, third B \u2192 the third should be R (same as first). \n\nSo the third character is B \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nThe example's fifth test case's explanation says: \n\nThe steps are WWW \u2192 WRB \u2192 BRB. \n\nThe final string is \"BRB\". \n\nSo the segments is \"BRB\", which is valid. \n\nThe code would accept it. \n\nAnother example: the seventh test case is all W's \u2192 output YES. \n\nThe code would have no segments \u2192 valid \u2192 YES. \n\nAnother test case: \"BRRB\" \u2192 the segment is length 4. \n\nFirst two are BR \u2192 okay. \n\nThird character R must be same as first (B?), no. \n\nSo third character is R, which is not equal to first (B). \n\nThus, invalid \u2192 code returns NO. \n\nThus, the code seems correct. \n\nNow, the code for program2 needs to be written in the given code structure. \n\nThe given code for program2 is: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe user needs to fill in the code after that. \n\nThe code should process each s as follows. \n\nThe code can be written as follows: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    segments = []\n    current = []\n    for c in s.strip():\n        if c == 'W':\n            if current:\n                segments.append(''.join(current))\n                current = []\n        else:\n            current.append(c)\n    if current:\n        segments.append(''.join(current))\n    valid = True\n    for seg in segments:\n        l = len(seg)\n        if l < 2:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        if seg[0] == seg[1]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        for i in range(2, l):\n            if seg[i] != seg[i-2]:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nThis should be the code for program2. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the missing code for program1 is the two lines inside the if block, and for program2 the code as above. \n\nSo the final answer is: \n\nFor program1, the missing code is in the loop over the rows: \n\nans = \"R\"\nbreak\n\nFor program2, the missing code is the entire block after the for loop, which is the code I wrote above. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code, not the entire program. \n\nWait, the user says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py' runs correctly. Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is the lines inside the for loop's if condition. \n\nThe original code for program1 has: \n\nfor row in l:\n    if row.count('R') ==8:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code is to set ans to 'R' and break. \n\nSo the completion for program1 is \"ans = 'R'\\n    break\".\n\nFor program2, the missing code is the entire block after the for loop. \n\nThe original code for program2 is: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code is everything after the for loop, which is the code I wrote above. \n\nSo the completion for program2 is the entire code block after the for loop. \n\nThus, the JSON should be: \n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"ans = 'R'\\n        break\",\n    \"program2\": \"\"\"\n    segments = []\n    current = []\n    for c in s.strip():\n        if c == 'W':\n            if current:\n                segments.append(''.join(current))\n                current = []\n        else:\n            current.append(c)\n    if current:\n        segments.append(''.join(current))\n    valid = True\n    for seg in segments:\n        l = len(seg)\n        if l < 2:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        if seg[0] == seg[1]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        for i in range(2, l):\n            if seg[i] != seg[i-2]:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nBut since the user requires the code as a string without markdown, and the JSON should have the code as strings. \n\nHowever, in the program2's code, the indentation must be correct. \n\nWait, the code inside the for loop for program2 must be indented properly. \n\nThe original code for program2 is: \n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code is the entire block inside the for loop. \n\nSo the code after the for loop's colon must be indented. \n\nThus, the code for program2's completion is the entire block inside the for loop, properly indented. \n\nSo the code for program2's completion is: \n\n    segments = []\n    current = []\n    for c in s.strip():\n        if c == 'W':\n            if current:\n                segments.append(''.join(current))\n                current = []\n        else:\n            current.append(c)\n    if current:\n        segments.append(''.join(current))\n    valid = True\n    for seg in segments:\n        l = len(seg)\n        if l < 2:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        if seg[0] == seg[1]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        for i in range(2, l):\n            if seg[i] != seg[i-2]:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nEach line must be indented with four spaces (assuming the for loop is at the top level). \n\nThus, the JSON should have the program2's completion as the above code as a string. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"ans = 'R'\\n        break\",\n    \"program2\": \"    segments = []\\n    current = []\\n    for c in s.strip():\\n        if c == 'W':\\n            if current:\\n                segments.append(''.join(current))\\n                current = []\\n        else:\\n            current.append(c)\\n    if current:\\n        segments.append(''.join(current))\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segments:\\n        l = len(seg)\\n        if l < 2:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if seg[0] == seg[1]:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        for i in range(2, l):\\n            if seg[i] != seg[i-2]:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n}"
