Let me think step by step:\n\nSuppose we have processed up to i-1, and the current b_{i-1} is fixed. Then, for the i-th element, we need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and the total moves (sum |k_i|) is minimized. The minimal k_i would be the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}. Let's compute that. Let me denote the required minimal k_i as the minimal integer where k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}. But since a_i can be positive, the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ), but only if a_i is positive. Since a_i is given as positive (per input constraints), yes. Wait, but k_i can be negative. Wait, but if a_i is positive, then to have k_i * a_i as large as possible, we need to choose k_i as large as possible. Wait, but the minimal steps would require choosing the smallest possible |k_i|. Hmm, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and |k_i| is as small as possible. Alternatively, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in terms of absolute value) such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}. Wait, but how do we choose between possible k_i's? Let me think of the minimal possible k_i for each step. Suppose the previous b_{i-1} is known. Then, the minimal k_i must satisfy:\n\nk_i * a_i > b_{i-1}\n\nWe can write this as k_i > (b_{i-1}) / a_i. Since a_i is positive, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i. But since k_i can be any integer (positive or negative), but we want to minimize |k_i|, perhaps the best is to choose the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i is just above b_{i-1}, but with the smallest possible |k_i|. Wait, but how? Alternatively, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and the value of k_i is as close to zero as possible. Let me think of an example. Suppose b_{i-1} is 5, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (since 2*3=6>5). The |k_i| is 2. Alternatively, if k_i is -1, then -3 is not greater than 5. So the minimal possible is 2. Another example: if b_{i-1} is 4, a_i is 3. Then k_i can be 2 (6>4), which is better than 1 (3 is not >4). So yes, the minimal k_i is 2. Wait, but what if b_{i-1} is 3, a_i is 3. Then k_i must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6>3). So k_i=2. Hmm, so the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ) Wait, let's see:\n\nThe required is k_i * a_i > b_{i-1} \u2192 k_i > (b_{i-1})/a_i \u2192 the minimal integer k_i is floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. Yes, that's correct. So k_i_min = floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. But then, the value of k_i must be at least that. However, perhaps there's a smaller k_i if we can have a negative value? Wait, no. Because if a_i is positive, then a negative k_i would give a negative value, which can't be greater than b_{i-1} (which is at least the previous value, which could be positive or negative?",

This seems tricky. Maybe the optimal approach is to set each b_i as small as possible given the constraints from the previous elements. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nStart with b_1 as 0 (k_1=0). Then, for each next element, compute the minimal possible b_i that is just above the previous b_{i-1}, and track the required k_i. Wait, but this might not be optimal. Let me see with an example. Take example 1 from the problem:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nThe sample output is 4. The solution given is subtract a_1 (so k_1 = -1 \u2192 b_1 = -1), then for the others, add a_3, a_4, a_5. So the steps are:\n\nb1 = -1 (k1 = -1 \u2192 1 move)\n\nb2 = 0 (k2=0 \u2192 0 moves)\n\nb3 = 3 (k3=1 \u2192 1 move)\n\nb4 =4 (k4=1 \u2192 1 move)\n\nb5=5 (k5=1 \u21921 move). Total moves: 4.\n\nWait, but how does this fit into the approach? Alternatively, let's see:\n\nThe first element can be set to -1 (k=-1, 1 move). Then the second must be >-1. The minimal for b2 is 0 (k=0, 0 moves). Then third must be >0. The minimal is 3 (k=1, 1 move). Fourth must be >3 \u21924 (k=1, 1 move). Fifth must be >4 \u21925 (k=1, 1 move). Total 4 moves. So the approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i each time (just above the previous) gives the correct result here. Another example: \n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7\n\n3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nThe sample output is 10. The solution is to have b array as [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. The moves are:\n\nFor first element: -3 \u2192 k=-1 (since 3 * -1 = -3 \u2192 1 move. Second: -2 \u2192 k = (-2)/2 \u2192 -1 \u2192 1 move (since 2*(-1) =-2 \u2192 total 2 so far. Third: -1 \u2192 1*(-1) \u2192 k=-1 \u2192 1 move (total 3). Fourth: 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 moves (since 3*0=0 \u2192 total 3. Fifth: 1 \u2192 2*(0.5) \u2192 but must be integer. Wait, 2*0.5 is 1, but k must be integer. So k=0.5 is not allowed. Wait, the fifth element's a_i is 2. So to get 1, k must be 0.5, which is not possible. Wait, the example's solution must have different steps. Wait the example's solution is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Let's see:\n\nFirst element: -3 \u2192 k = -1 (3 * -1 \u2192 yes, 1 move. Second: -2 \u2192 a_i is 2 \u2192 k = -1 \u2192 2*(-1) =-2 \u2192 1 move (total 2). Third: -1 \u2192 a_i is 1 \u2192 k =-1 \u2192 1 move (total 3). Fourth: 0 \u2192 a_i is 3 \u2192 k=0 \u2192 0 moves (total 3). Fifth: 1 \u2192 a_i is 2 \u2192 1/2 \u2192 but k must be integer. So to get 1, k must be 0.5 \u2192 not possible. Wait, maybe the fifth element's b is 2? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. Wait the example's output is 10 moves. Let me see the example's explanation:\n\nThey reach [ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ] in 10 moves. Wait for the fifth element (a_i=2), the b_i is 1. So 1 must be a multiple of 2? No, that's impossible.

But since the second element must be greater than b_1, we need to choose k_1 such that the second element can be set to a value just above b_1 with minimal moves. This seems too vague. Alternatively, let's think greedily. For each i from 1 to n:\n\nWe need to choose k_i such that:\n\nb_i = k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}\n\nWe want to choose the minimal possible |k_i| such that this holds, and also choose the minimal possible b_i to allow the next elements to have smaller required values. Wait, that makes sense. Because if we choose the smallest possible b_i (just above b_{i-1}), then the next elements have a lower threshold to meet, which might allow for smaller k's. So the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity (since there's no previous element for the first one).",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nLooking at the problem description for program1, it's about handling queries on a set of points and counting beautiful triples. A beautiful triple is i<j<k with k-i \u2264d. The code provided uses a segment tree, but there's a missing part in the update function when 'up' is False. \n\nHmm, the SegmentTree's update method has a comment saying \"TODO: Your code here\" when handling the else case (when up is False). The current code for the 'up' case adds to the lazy and updates v1 and v2. For the else case (when we need to subtract), I think we need to reverse those operations. Like, subtract the same terms instead of adding. So, for the else branch, instead of adding 1 to the lazy, we should subtract 1. Then, the v2 and v1 would need to be adjusted accordingly. Let me think: when we're undoing the previous addition, the delta would be -1. So the code for the else part should be similar but with subtraction. \n\nWait, the 'up' parameter is a boolean. So when up is False, we need to subtract the same terms. So in the else clause, the code would be something like:\n\nself.v2[x] -= (2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x])\nself.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\nself.lazy[x] -= 1\n\nWait, but the order might matter here. Let me see. The original code for the 'up' case adds 1 to the lazy, and then updates v1 and v2. So when we are doing the opposite (like, when we remove a point that was previously added), we need to subtract the same effect. So the else part should subtract the same terms. \n\nWait, the 'up' is a boolean indicating whether we are adding or removing. So when up is False, the code should subtract the effect of adding. So the code for the else case would be:\n\nelse:\n    self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] - (2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x])\n    self.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\n    self.lazy[x] -= 1\n\nWait, but maybe the order is important here. Let me think again. The original code for the 'up' case does:\n\nself.v2[x] += 2*self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\nself.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\nself.lazy[x] +=1\n\nSo when we need to undo that (i.e., when up is False), we need to subtract those terms. So the else clause would be:\n\nself.v2[x] -= (2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x])\nself.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\nself.lazy[x] -=1\n\nYes, that makes sense. So that's the missing code for the update function in the SegmentTree's update method.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing, where each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. \n\nThe code provided has a loop that's trying different starting points, perhaps? The current code has a while loop with t1 < m (but m is n?), but the code might be incorrect. Let me read the problem again. \n\nThe approach here is probably dynamic programming. Let's think of the constraints. For each position i, b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. Since initially all b_i are 0, we need to adjust them. \n\nThe key idea is to model the minimal steps required such that each step builds on the previous. Let me think of the variables. Let's denote that for each i, the minimal required value of b_i given the previous constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering the minimal required increments. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem by ensuring that each b_i is at least b_{i-1} + 1. Since each b_i can be adjusted by multiples of a_i (since each move adds or subtracts a_i, so the total change must be a multiple of a_i?), wait no. Wait, each move can add or subtract a_i, so the total change for b_i can be any multiple of a_i. Wait, no. Each move for b_i can add or subtract a_i. So the total change for b_i is k * a_i, where k is any integer (positive or negative). So the final b_i is 0 + k_i * a_i. \n\nWait, the problem says \"in one move you can choose an integer i, and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\". So each move for i changes b_i by \u00b1a_i. So the total change for b_i is the sum of these moves, which can be any multiple of a_i (since each step adds or subtracts a_i). So the final b_i must be equal to some multiple of a_i (could be positive or negative). \n\nWait, no. For example, if you add a_i once and subtract once, the net is 0. So the total change is a multiple of a_i. So the final b_i must be equal to k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (could be positive, negative, or zero). \n\nTherefore, the problem requires that for all i from 2 to n, b_i must be > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nb_1 = k_1 * a_1\n\nb_2 = k_2 * a_2 > b_1\n\nb_3 = k_3 * a_3 > b_2\n\nand so on.\n\nWe need to choose integers k_i such that these inequalities hold, and the total number of moves (sum of |k_i| for all i) is minimized.\n\nHmm, so the problem reduces to choosing k_i's such that the inequalities are satisfied, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let me think of how to model it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it greedily. Let's see.\n\nLet me think of the variables step by step. Let's start from the first element and see how the constraints propagate.\n\nSuppose we have the first element's value fixed. Then the second must be at least b_1 +1, and so on. But since each b_i must be a multiple of a_i, perhaps we can model the minimal steps by considering the minimal required increments.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nLet me denote that for each position i, the minimal required value of b_i given the previous constraints. Let's process the array from left to right.\n\nLet me denote that after processing the first i elements, the minimal required value for b_i is some value. Let's see:\n\nInitialize b_1 can be any multiple of a_1. Let's choose the minimal possible k_1 such that the subsequent constraints can be satisfied. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can express the constraints as:\n\nb_1 = k_1 * a_1\n\nb_2 = k_2 * a_2 > b_1 \u2192 k_2 * a_2 > k_1 * a_1 \u2192 k_2 * a_2 \u2265 k_1 * a_1 +1\n\nSimilarly, for each i \u22652:\n\nk_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\nWe need to choose integers k_i to satisfy all these inequalities, and minimize the sum of |k_i|.\n\nHmm, this seems challenging. Let me think of a way to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of the DP state as the current position and the value of the previous b_i. But since a_i can be up to 1e9, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the minimal required k_i given the previous constraints.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nStart from the first element. Let's set b_1 as 0 (k_1=0). Then, for the next elements, we need to adjust their k_i such that the constraints are met. But this might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the minimal required k_i for each step, given the previous constraints.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nSuppose we have processed up to i-1, and the current b_{i-1} is fixed. Then, for the i-th element, we need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and the total moves (sum |k_i|) is minimized.\n\nThe minimal k_i would be the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}. Let's compute that.\n\nLet me denote the required minimal k_i as the minimal integer where k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}.\n\nBut since a_i can be positive, the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ), but only if a_i is positive. Since a_i is given as positive (per input constraints), yes.\n\nWait, but k_i can be negative. Wait, but if a_i is positive, then to have k_i * a_i as large as possible, we need to choose k_i as large as possible. Wait, but the minimal steps would require choosing the smallest possible |k_i|.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and |k_i| is as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in terms of absolute value) such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}.\n\nWait, but how do we choose between possible k_i's?\n\nLet me think of the minimal possible k_i for each step.\n\nSuppose the previous b_{i-1} is known. Then, the minimal k_i must satisfy:\n\nk_i * a_i > b_{i-1}\n\nWe can write this as k_i > (b_{i-1}) / a_i.\n\nSince a_i is positive, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i.\n\nBut since k_i can be any integer (positive or negative), but we want to minimize |k_i|, perhaps the best is to choose the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i is just above b_{i-1}, but with the smallest possible |k_i|.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and the value of k_i is as close to zero as possible.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose b_{i-1} is 5, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (since 2*3=6>5). The |k_i| is 2. Alternatively, if k_i is -1, then -3 is not greater than 5. So the minimal possible is 2.\n\nAnother example: if b_{i-1} is 4, a_i is 3. Then k_i can be 2 (6>4), which is better than 1 (3 is not >4). So yes, the minimal k_i is 2.\n\nWait, but what if b_{i-1} is 3, a_i is 3. Then k_i must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6>3). So k_i=2.\n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe required is k_i * a_i > b_{i-1} \u2192 k_i > (b_{i-1})/a_i \u2192 the minimal integer k_i is floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So k_i_min = floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1.\n\nBut then, the value of k_i must be at least that. However, perhaps there's a smaller k_i if we can have a negative value?\n\nWait, no. Because if a_i is positive, then a negative k_i would give a negative value, which can't be greater than b_{i-1} (which is at least the previous value, which could be positive or negative? Wait, no, because the array must be strictly increasing. So each b_i must be greater than the previous. So the first element can be anything, but the second must be greater than the first, etc. So the first element can be negative, but the second must be higher than that. \n\nWait, but the initial b array is all zeros. So the first element can be set to any multiple of a_1. Let me think of the first element's possible values. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the entire array is strictly increasing. So for the first element, there's no constraint except that the second must be greater than it. So the first element can be set to any value, but the second must be higher. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by greedily choosing the minimal possible k_i for each step, given the previous constraints, and track the required b_i's.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right, keeping track of the minimal required value for each b_i. \n\nLet me denote that after processing the first i elements, the current b_i must be at least some value, say, prev. Then, for the next element, we need to choose k_{i+1} such that k_{i+1}*a_{i+1} > prev. The minimal |k_{i+1}| is achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_{i+1} such that this holds, and the value is as close to prev as possible. \n\nWait, but how do we track this?\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nInitialize prev = b_1 = k_1 * a_1. \n\nBut since there's no constraint on the first element except that the second must be greater than it, the first element can be set to any value. However, to minimize the total moves, we need to choose k_1 such that the subsequent steps can be done with minimal moves. \n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe the optimal approach is to set each b_i as small as possible given the constraints from the previous elements. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nStart with b_1 as 0 (k_1=0). Then, for each next element, compute the minimal possible b_i that is just above the previous b_{i-1}, and track the required k_i. \n\nWait, but this might not be optimal. Let me see with an example.\n\nTake example 1 from the problem:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nThe sample output is 4. \n\nThe solution given is subtract a_1 (so k_1 = -1 \u2192 b_1 = -1), then for the others, add a_3, a_4, a_5. So the steps are:\n\nb1 = -1 (k1 = -1 \u2192 1 move)\n\nb2 = 0 (k2=0 \u2192 0 moves)\n\nb3 = 3 (k3=1 \u2192 1 move)\n\nb4 =4 (k4=1 \u2192 1 move)\n\nb5=5 (k5=1 \u21921 move). Total moves: 4.\n\nWait, but how does this fit into the approach?\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nThe first element can be set to -1 (k=-1, 1 move). Then the second must be >-1. The minimal for b2 is 0 (k=0, 0 moves). Then third must be >0. The minimal is 3 (k=1, 1 move). Fourth must be >3 \u21924 (k=1, 1 move). Fifth must be >4 \u21925 (k=1, 1 move). Total 4 moves. \n\nSo the approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i each time (just above the previous) gives the correct result here. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7\n\n3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nThe sample output is 10. \n\nThe solution is to have b array as [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. \n\nThe moves are:\n\nFor first element: -3 \u2192 k=-1 (since 3 * -1 = -3 \u2192 1 move.\n\nSecond: -2 \u2192 k = (-2)/2 \u2192 -1 \u2192 1 move (since 2*(-1) =-2 \u2192 total 2 so far.\n\nThird: -1 \u2192 1*(-1) \u2192 k=-1 \u2192 1 move (total 3).\n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 moves (since 3*0=0 \u2192 total 3.\n\nFifth: 1 \u2192 2*(0.5) \u2192 but must be integer. Wait, 2*0.5 is 1, but k must be integer. So k=0.5 is not allowed. Wait, the fifth element's a_i is 2. So to get 1, k must be 0.5, which is not possible. Wait, the example's solution must have different steps. \n\nWait the example's solution is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Let's see:\n\nFirst element: -3 \u2192 k = -1 (3 * -1 \u2192 yes, 1 move.\n\nSecond: -2 \u2192 a_i is 2 \u2192 k = -1 \u2192 2*(-1) =-2 \u2192 1 move (total 2).\n\nThird: -1 \u2192 a_i is 1 \u2192 k =-1 \u2192 1 move (total 3).\n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 a_i is 3 \u2192 k=0 \u2192 0 moves (total 3).\n\nFifth: 1 \u2192 a_i is 2 \u2192 1/2 \u2192 but k must be integer. So to get 1, k must be 0.5 \u2192 not possible. Wait, maybe the fifth element's b is 2? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nWait the example's output is 10 moves. Let me see the example's explanation:\n\nThey reach [ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ] in 10 moves. \n\nWait for the fifth element (a_i=2), the b_i is 1. So 1 must be a multiple of 2? No, that's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding. \n\nWait, the problem says that each move for i can add or subtract a_i. So the total change for b_i is the sum of those moves. So the final b_i can be any integer, but it must be equal to k_i * a_i, where k_i is the net number of moves (each move adds or subtracts a_i, so the total is (number of adds - number of subtracts)*a_i. So yes, b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait in the example's solution, the fifth element's b_i is 1, but a_i is 2. 1 is not a multiple of 2. That's a contradiction. So perhaps I misunderstood the example. \n\nWait the example's explanation says the final array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Let me check each element:\n\nFirst element: -3 \u2192 a_1 is 3 \u2192 yes, -3 is 3*(-1).\n\nSecond: -2 \u2192 a_2 is 2 \u2192 yes, -2 is 2*(-1).\n\nThird: -1 \u2192 a_3 is 1 \u2192 yes, -1 is 1*(-1).\n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 a_4 is 3 \u2192 0 is 3*0.\n\nFifth: 1 \u2192 a_5 is 2 \u2192 1 is not divisible by 2. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the example's explanation has a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait the problem says \"add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\". So each move for i changes b_i by \u00b1a_i. So the total change for b_i is the sum of these, which can be any multiple of a_i. So the final b_i must be equal to the initial value (0) plus a multiple of a_i. So yes, it must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nTherefore, the example's fifth element must have a b_i that is a multiple of 2. So perhaps the example's explanation is wrong, or I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's fifth element is 2, not 1. Let me recalculate the moves:\n\nSuppose the fifth element is 2 (a_i=2 \u2192 k=1 \u2192 1 move. Then the total moves would be:\n\nFirst: 1 move (k=-1)\n\nSecond: 1 move (k=-1)\n\nThird: 1 move (k=-1)\n\nFourth: 0 moves (k=0)\n\nFifth: 1 move (k=1 \u2192 2*1=2)\n\nSixth: a_i=1 \u2192 to get 2, k=2 \u2192 2 moves (since 1*2=2). \n\nWait, but the sixth element's b_i must be greater than the fifth's 2. So it needs to be at least 3. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus back on the algorithm.\n\nThe key idea is that for each position i, the minimal steps are determined by the previous constraints. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem by keeping track of the minimal required value for b_i, and compute the minimal k_i accordingly.\n\nLet me denote that after processing the first i elements, the current b_i must be at least some value, say, prev. \n\nInitialize prev = -infinity (since there's no constraint on the first element except that the second must be greater than it). \n\nWait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's process the array step by step, keeping track of the minimal possible b_i that satisfies the constraints up to that point, and the minimal moves required.\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming where dp[i] is the minimal total moves up to the i-th element, and the value of b_i. But since the value can be large, this might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right, and for each position i, determine the minimal possible b_i given the previous constraints, and track the required k_i and the total moves.\n\nLet me see:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity (since there's no constraint before the first element). \n\nFor the first element:\n\nWe can choose any k_1. The minimal moves would be |k_1|. But since the second element must be greater than b_1, we need to choose k_1 such that the second element can be set to a value just above b_1 with minimal moves. \n\nThis seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, let's think greedily. For each i from 1 to n:\n\nWe need to choose k_i such that:\n\nb_i = k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}\n\nWe want to choose the minimal possible |k_i| such that this holds, and also choose the minimal possible b_i to allow the next elements to have smaller required values. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we choose the smallest possible b_i (just above b_{i-1}), then the next elements have a lower threshold to meet, which might allow for smaller k's. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity (since there's no previous element for the first one). \n\nWait, for the first element, there's no constraint except that the second must be greater than it. So to minimize the total moves, perhaps we can set the first element as low as possible (so that the second can be as small as possible). \n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's process each element step by step:\n\nStart with prev = -infinity (or 0, but not sure). \n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\nThe current a_i is given. \n\nWe need to choose k_i such that:\n\nk_i * a_i > prev \n\nWe want to choose the minimal |k_i| possible, and also choose the smallest possible b_i (so that the next elements have a lower threshold). \n\nThe minimal possible b_i is the smallest value greater than prev that is a multiple of a_i. \n\nSo the minimal b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is > prev. \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nThe minimal b_i is the smallest integer multiple of a_i that is greater than prev. \n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nLet required = prev + 1 (since it must be strictly greater than prev). \n\nThen, the minimal multiple of a_i that is >= required is ceil(required / a_i) * a_i. \n\nWait, but if required is divisible by a_i, then it's exactly required. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nrequired = prev +1 \n\nWe need to find the smallest multiple of a_i that is >= required. \n\nThe minimal k_i is ceil( (required) / a_i )\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i >= required. \n\nSo k_i = ceil( (required) / a_i )\n\nBut since a_i is positive, this is correct. \n\nSo the minimal b_i is k_i * a_i, where k_i is ceil( (prev +1)/a_i )\n\nBut this gives the minimal possible b_i that is just above prev. \n\nThen, the moves for this step are |k_i|. \n\nWait, but what if choosing a smaller k_i (but still satisfying the condition) would allow for a better total? \n\nWait, the minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is as close to zero as possible. \n\nWait, but the minimal possible k_i that satisfies k_i * a_i > prev is ceil( (prev)/a_i + 1e-9 ), but perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal k_i. \n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nWe need to choose the smallest possible k_i (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| can be found by considering the closest integer to zero that satisfies the inequality. \n\nLet me compute the minimal possible k_i:\n\nLet required = prev +1 \n\nWe need k_i * a_i >= required \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in terms of absolute value) such that this holds. \n\nLet me compute the minimal k_i:\n\nLet me compute the minimal k_i as follows:\n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i can be found by:\n\nk_min = ceil( (prev) / a_i )\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose prev is 5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen required is 6. \n\nk_i must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6). \n\nSo k_min is 2. \n\nAnother example: prev is 3, a_i is 3 \u2192 required is 4 \u2192 k_i must be 2 (since 2*3=6>3). \n\nWait, but 3/3 =1 \u2192 ceil(3/3) =1 \u2192 1*3=3 which is not greater than prev (3). So that's not sufficient. \n\nAh, so the correct formula is ceil( (prev) / a_i ) + 1? \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe required is prev +1. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is ceil( (prev +1) / a_i )\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo k_i = ceil( (prev +1)/a_i )\n\nThen, the b_i is k_i * a_i. \n\nThe moves for this step are |k_i|. \n\nWait, but what if k_i is negative? \n\nWait, if a_i is positive, then to have k_i * a_i > prev, if prev is very negative, then a negative k_i could work. \n\nWait, for example, if prev is -100, a_i is 5. \n\nThen required is -99. \n\nThe minimal k_i is ceil( (-99)/5 ) \u2192 which is ceil(-19.8) \u2192 -19. \n\nSo k_i = -19 \u2192 -19 *5 = -95, which is greater than -100. \n\nThe moves would be 19 (absolute value). \n\nAlternatively, choosing k_i =-18 \u2192 -90, which is also greater than -100, but requires 18 moves. \n\nWait, so the minimal k_i is indeed the minimal possible in terms of absolute value. \n\nWait, in this case, the minimal k_i would be -19 (since -19*5 =-95 is the first multiple above -100). \n\nBut the absolute value is 19, but maybe there's a smaller k_i with a smaller absolute value. \n\nWait, for example, k_i =-18 gives -90, which is also greater than -100. The absolute value is 18, which is smaller. \n\nAh, so my previous approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the minimal k_i in terms of absolute value may not be the one given by the formula. \n\nSo the formula gives the minimal k_i in terms of the value of b_i, but not the minimal moves. \n\nThis complicates things. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal possible k_i (in terms of |k_i|) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nLet me think of how to compute that. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo, the possible candidates are the integers around (prev +1)/a_i. \n\nLet me compute the minimal k_i as follows:\n\nWe need to find the integer k such that k * a_i > prev, and |k| is minimized. \n\nLet me compute the minimal possible k:\n\nLet me compute the minimal k such that k * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal k can be found by:\n\nk_min = floor( (prev) / a_i ) + 1 \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev =5, a_i=3 \u2192 (5)/3 =1.666 \u2192 floor is 1 \u2192 +1 \u2192 2 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev=3, a_i=3 \u2192 3/3=1 \u2192 floor is 1 \u2192 +1 \u2192 2 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev =-100, a_i=5 \u2192 (-100)/5 =-20 \u2192 floor is -20 \u2192 +1 \u2192 -19 \u2192 which gives -95. \n\nBut there's a better k: -19 is worse than -18 (since -18 gives -90, which is also >-100 and has smaller |k|). \n\nAh, so the formula gives k_min =-19, but there exists a smaller k (in absolute terms) like -18. \n\nSo the formula is not correct. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the minimal k in terms of |k| may not be the one that gives the minimal b_i. \n\nThis complicates the approach. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is the closest integer to (prev +1)/a_i, but such that k_i *a_i > prev. \n\nWait, let me think of the optimal k_i as the integer closest to (prev +1)/a_i, but adjusted to satisfy the inequality. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| can be found by considering the possible k_i around (prev +1)/a_i. \n\nLet me compute the real number x = (prev +1)/a_i. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the integer closest to x, but such that k_i *a_i > prev. \n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of x as the required value. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (prev)/a_i. \n\nWait, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i > prev/a_i. \n\nSo k_i = floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nWait, that's the same as before. \n\nBut in the case where prev is -100 and a_i is 5, prev/a_i is -20 \u2192 floor is -20 \u2192 +1 \u2192 -19. \n\nBut there are smaller k_i's like -18, which also satisfy the condition. \n\nAh, but the minimal k_i in terms of |k_i| would be the one closest to zero. \n\nWait, in that case, the minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is the smallest possible in absolute value that satisfies the inequality. \n\nSo, the minimal possible k_i is the one closest to zero. \n\nLet me think of the possible candidates:\n\nWe can compute the minimal k_i as the integer closest to (prev +1)/a_i, but ensuring that k_i *a_i > prev. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| can be found by considering the two candidates: floor(x) and ceil(x), where x = (prev +1)/a_i. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nx = (prev +1)/a_i \n\nThe minimal k_i is the integer closest to x, but must be greater than (prev)/a_i. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the floor and ceil of x, but adjusted to satisfy the inequality. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute the possible k candidates as the floor and ceil of x, and see which one gives the minimal |k|. \n\nWait, let me try with the example where prev =-100, a_i=5:\n\nx = (-100 +1)/5 = -99/5 = -19.8 \n\nfloor(x) =-20 \u2192 k=-20 \u2192 -20*5 =-100 \u2192 which is not greater than prev (-100). So that's invalid. \n\nceil(x) =-19 \u2192 -19*5 =-95> -100 \u2192 valid. \n\nSo the minimal k is -19, but there's also k=-18 \u2192 -90> -100 \u2192 which is better in terms of |k|. \n\nAh, so the problem is that the minimal k_i is not necessarily the ceil(x). \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal k_i such that k_i *a_i > prev, and |k_i| is as small as possible. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nWe can compute the minimal possible k_i as follows:\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible |k| such that k *a_i > prev. \n\nLet me compute the minimal possible k:\n\nLet me compute the minimal possible k in terms of absolute value. \n\nLet me consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: a_i is positive (which it is, per input constraints). \n\nWe can write the inequality as k > prev / a_i \n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than (prev)/a_i. \n\nThe minimal k is floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nBut this gives the minimal k in terms of the value of k, but not the minimal |k|. \n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal |k| is achieved by the smallest possible k in absolute terms that satisfies the inequality. \n\nLet me think of the possible k values:\n\nThe minimal possible k is the one closest to zero. \n\nLet me compute the real number x = (prev +1)/a_i \n\nThe minimal k is the integer closest to x, but must be greater than prev/a_i. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k can be found by considering the two candidates: \n\nk1 = ceil( (prev)/a_i )\n\nk2 = floor( (prev)/a_i ) +1 \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. \n\nLet me think of the minimal possible k_i as the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i *a_i > prev. \n\nLet me compute the minimal possible k_i:\n\nLet me compute the minimal possible k_i as follows:\n\nWe can compute the minimal possible k_i as the smallest integer (in absolute value) such that k_i *a_i > prev. \n\nLet me compute the possible candidates:\n\nLet me compute the real number x = (prev +1)/a_i \n\nThe minimal k_i is the integer closest to x, but must be greater than prev/a_i. \n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i can be found by considering the two candidates: floor(x) and ceil(x). \n\nWait, let me try with the example where prev =-100, a_i=5:\n\nx = (-100 +1)/5 = -19.8 \n\nfloor(x) =-20 \u2192 k=-20 \u2192 -20*5 =-100 \u2192 which is not greater than prev (-100). So invalid. \n\nceil(x) =-19 \u2192 -19*5 =-95 \u2192 valid. \n\nSo the minimal k is -19. \n\nBut there's also k=-18 \u2192 which is better (smaller |k|). \n\nAh, so the problem is that the minimal k is not necessarily the ceil(x). \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the closest to zero. \n\nWait, prev/a_i is -20 (since prev is -100, a_i=5 \u2192 -100/5 =-20). \n\nSo the minimal k must be greater than -20 \u2192 so the minimal possible k is -19, but there are larger k's (like -18, -17, etc.) which also satisfy the condition. \n\nThe minimal |k| is achieved when k is as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest possible integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the largest possible (closest to zero). \n\nWait, the minimal |k| is achieved when k is the smallest possible in absolute terms. \n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the largest possible (closest to zero). \n\nWait, the minimal |k| is achieved when k is the smallest possible in absolute terms. \n\nSo in the example, the possible k's are -19, -18, -17, etc. \n\nThe minimal |k| is achieved when k is -18 (|k|=18), but even better is -17 (|k|=17), etc. \n\nWait, but the minimal possible k is the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nWait, but the minimal possible k is the one with the smallest absolute value that satisfies the condition. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal k is the smallest possible (in absolute terms) such that k *a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal possible k is the smallest possible (closest to zero) that satisfies the condition. \n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the largest possible (closest to zero). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the largest possible (closest to zero). \n\nWait, the minimal k in terms of |k| is the one closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the largest possible (closest to zero). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, but also the largest
