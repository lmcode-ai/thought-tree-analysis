Hmm, the problem says that Eric has an array b, and each c_i starts as a copy of b. Then, for non-special arrays (those not k), they use operation 1 at least once. The special one uses operation 2 at least once. The operations modify the arrays in specific ways. The key is to find which array is special and how many times op2 was used on it. The approach in the given code for program1.py seems to be calculating some value for each array.",

So for each feature j, the third card's value must be such that a[j] + b[j] + c[j] is either 0 (all 0), 3 (all 1?), or 6 (all 2?), but that's not exactly right. Wait, perhaps for each feature, the third element is determined as follows: If a[j] == b[j], then c[j] must be equal to them. If a[j] != b[j], then c[j] must be the third value not equal to a[j] or b[j]. Wait, let's think: \n\nSuppose for a feature, the two cards have values x and y. If x == y, then the third must also be x (so all same). If x != y, then the third must be the third value (so all different). So for each feature j, the third card's value is:\n\nif a[j] == b[j], then c[j] = a[j]\n\nelse, c[j] = (3 - a[j] - b[j]) mod 3? Wait, let's see: \n\nSuppose a[j] is 0 and b[j] is 1. Then the third must be 2. 0+1+2 =3. If a is 0 and b is 2, then third is 1. So the third value is 3 - (a + b) if a and b are different. Wait, 0+1 \u2192 third is 2 \u2192 3- (0+1) = 2. \n\n0+2 \u2192 3- (0+2) =1. \n\n1+2 \u2192 3-3=0. Yes, that works. So for each feature j, the third card's value is:\n\nif a[j] == b[j], then c[j] = a[j]\n\nelse, c[j] = 3 - a[j] - b[j]\n\nSo in code, for each j in 0..k-1:\n\nif a[j] == b[j], then last[j] = a[j]\n\nelse, last[j] = 3 - a[j] - b[j]\n\nTherefore, in the code's loop over p and q (indices of two cards), the third card is computed as follows:\n\ncard_p = deck[p]\n\ncard_q = deck[q]\n\nfor each j in 0..k-1:\n\n    if card_p[j] == card_q[j]:\n\n        last[j] = card_p[j]\n\n    else:\n\n        last[j] = 3 - card_p[j] - card_q[j]\n\nThen, check if this third card exists in the deck, and its index is after q (to avoid duplicates? Or perhaps to count each set only once?) Wait, the code's current condition is \"if last in dic and dic[last] > q\". This is to avoid counting the same set multiple times. Because for a set (a, b, c), the code would process pairs (a,b), (a,c), (b,c), each time finding the third card.",

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach can be fixed. Wait, the problem is that the code is trying to compare each array's sum to the first one, but that's not correct. Suppose the first array is the special one. Then its sum is S + x. The next arrays have sum S. \n\nIn that case, when j=1 (second array), the code would see that value (S) is less than tmp (S+x). So it would print \"1 \" + (tmp - value) \u2192 which would be x. But the correct k is 1 (the first array). But the code would print \"1 \" + x, which is correct. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the first array is the special one. Then, for j=0 (the first array), tmp is set to its value (S + x). Then, for j=1 (second array), value is S. Since value < tmp, the code would print \"1 \" + (tmp - value) \u2192 which is (S+x - S) = x. The printed k is 1 (correct), and the x is correct. Then, for j=2 (third array), value is S. \n\nThe code would again compare to tmp (which was S +x). So the code would print \"1 \" + (S+x - S) again. But this would print multiple lines for the same test case, which is wrong. Ah, right! The code is printing for each array, which is incorrect. The code is supposed to process all arrays and then output the correct k and x once per test case.",

This is better because it uses O(1) space. This would work because the non-special arrays all have the same sum. So the minimal value is that sum. Yes! Because the non-special arrays all have the same sum S. The special array has sum S + x. Thus, the minimal value in the list is S (since all non-special arrays have S, and the special has a higher value). Therefore, the code can be written this way.

This is better and efficient. Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is to replace the existing code with this approach. The original code's loop for j in range(n) has a TODO in the else clause.

But the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. The original code's code for the j loop has a TODO in the else clause. The correct code for that part is to do nothing. But the rest of the code is incorrect. Therefore, the correct code for program1.py is to replace the entire loop with the code that tracks max and min. The missing code for program1.py is the code that does this. The original code's code for the j loop is:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1) if j==0:\n        tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp:\n            print(str(j+1)+\" \"+str(value-tmp))\n        elif value < tmp:\n            print(\"1 \"+str(tmp-value))\n            tmp = value\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe correct code for this loop is:\n\nmax_val = -float('inf') min_val = float('inf')\nk_index = 0\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k] * (k+1) if value > max_val:\n        max_val = value\n        k_index = j + 1\n    if value < min_val:\n        min_val = value\n# After the loop, compute x and print\nx = max_val - min_val\nprint(f\"{k_index} {x}\") So the missing code for program1.py is to replace the existing loop with this code. The original code's loop has the if j==0 and other conditions, which are replaced by the new code. The user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. The original code's code for the j loop is incorrect. The missing code is the entire block that replaces it. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the code that tracks max and min, and the final print. Now, for program2.py's missing code: The code's TODO is in the loop over j in range(k): The code needs to compute last[j] as follows:\n\na = deck[p][j]\n\nb = deck[q][j]\n\nif a == b:\n\n    last[j] = a \n\nelse:\n\n    last[j] = 3 - a - b So the missing code is:\n\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = deck[p][j]\n    b = deck[q][j]\n    if a == b:\n        last[j] = a\n    else:\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is this loop. Putting it all together, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"max_val = -float('inf')\\nmin_val = float('inf')\\nk_index = 0\\nfor j in range(n):\\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\\n    value = 0\\n    for k in range(m):\\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\\n    if value > max_val:\\n        max_val = value\\n        k_index = j+1\\n    if value < min_val:\\n        min_val = value\\nx = max_val - min_val\\nprint(f\\\"{k_index} {x}\\\")\",\n  \"program2\": \"for j in range(k):\\n    a = deck[p][j]\\n    b = deck[q][j]\\n    if a == b:\\n        last[j] = a\\n    else:\\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b\"\n}\n\nWait, but the original code for program1.py has the loop for j in range(n) inside the test case loop. The code I wrote for program1's missing part includes the loop and the final print. The original code's existing code for the j loop is replaced by this new code. Therefore, the missing code for program1 is the entire block that replaces the existing loop and adds the final print. The original code's code for the j loop is inside the test case loop. The correct code for program1's missing part is the code that replaces the existing loop and adds the final print.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with the first one, the problem where we need to find the special array and the number of operation 2 uses.\n\nHmm, the problem says that Eric has an array b, and each c_i starts as a copy of b. Then, for non-special arrays (those not k), they use operation 1 at least once. The special one uses operation 2 at least once. The operations modify the arrays in specific ways. The key is to find which array is special and how many times op2 was used on it.\n\nThe approach in the given code for program1.py seems to be calculating some value for each array. The code starts by reading each array, then for each element, it multiplies by (k+1) and sums them up. Then it compares these values. The initial idea might be that the special array's value is different in a certain way.\n\nWait, the operations for non-special arrays (op1) and special (op2) must affect the sum in a particular way. Let me think about the effect of each operation on the sum of c_i * (position). \n\nLet's see for operation 1: when you choose i and j (between 2 and m-1), subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+1]. The positions are 1-based? Let's see the contribution to the sum. \n\nThe change for each element:\n\nFor position i-1: +1, so contributes + (i) (since position i-1 is (i-1 +1) = i? Wait, the position is 1-based. So for position i-1, the multiplier is (i-1)'s index, which is (i-1)th position? Wait, the code uses (k+1) where k is the index in the list. Wait, in the code, list1 is 0-based. So for list1[k], the position is k+1. So the multiplier is (k+1). \n\nSo for operation 1, the elements at positions i and j (original indices in 1-based) are being modified. Let's see:\n\nOriginal sum contribution from those positions:\n\nc[i] * i + c[j] * j \n\nAfter the operation, they become (c[i]-1)*i + (c[j]-1)*j \n\nBut the added parts are (c[i-1]+1)*(i-1) and (c[j+1]+1)*(j+1). \n\nWait, the total change for the sum would be:\n\nThe total change from the operation is:\n\nFor the subtracted parts: -1 * i (from c[i]) and -1 * j (from c[j]) \u2192 total - (i + j)\n\nThe added parts: +1*(i-1) (from c[i-1]) and +1*(j+1) (from c[j+1]). So total + (i-1 + j+1) = (i + j). \n\nSo the total change is (- (i + j) ) + (i + j) \u2192 0. So the sum remains the same for operation 1.\n\nNow for operation 2, which is used on the special array. Let's see its effect. \n\nOperation 2: choose i and j (2 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m-2). Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+2]. \n\nSo the same approach: \n\nOriginal contributions from those positions:\n\nc[i] * i + c[j] * j \n\nAfter operation: (c[i]-1)*i + (c[j]-1)*j \u2192 subtract (i + j)\n\nThe added parts are (c[i-1]+1)*(i-1) and (c[j+2]+1)*(j+2). \n\nThe total added is (i-1) + (j+2) \u2192 (i-1 + j+2) = i + j +1 \n\nSo the total change is (- (i + j)) + (i + j +1) \u2192 +1. \n\nSo each operation 2 increases the sum by 1. \n\nAh! So the key insight is that for each array, the sum of (c_i's elements multiplied by their 1-based indices) must equal the original sum (from array b) plus the number of operation1's done on it (but operation1 doesn't change the sum) for non-special arrays. Wait, no. Wait, non-special arrays can only do operation1, which doesn't change the sum. So their sum remains the same as the original b's sum. \n\nWait, the original array b's sum S is the same as all the c_i's initial sum. Then, for non-special arrays, since they perform operation1 any number of times (but at least once), but each operation1 doesn't change the sum. So their final sum is still S. \n\nThe special array, however, uses operation2. Each operation2 increases the sum by 1. So the sum of the special array is S + x, where x is the number of operation2 uses. \n\nTherefore, all the non-special arrays have the same sum S, and the special array has a sum S + x. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find which array has a sum different from the others. The one with a higher sum is the special array, and the difference is x. \n\nWait, but how do we find which array is the special one? Because all non-special arrays have the same sum, and the special one has a higher sum. \n\nWait, but the problem says that each non-special array must have been operated on at least once with operation1. But operation1 doesn't change the sum, so their sum remains S. The special array's sum is S + x (since each op2 adds 1). \n\nTherefore, the array with the maximum sum is the special one, and the difference between its sum and the others is x. \n\nSo the plan is: for each test case, compute the sum for each array (sum of c[i][j] * (j+1)), then find which array has a sum that is higher than all others. The difference between that array's sum and the others (which should all be equal) is the x. \n\nWait, but what if there are multiple arrays with the same maximum sum? But according to the problem statement, the answer is unique, so there must be exactly one array with a higher sum. \n\nSo in the code provided, the current code is trying to track the first array's sum and compare with others. But that approach might not work because if the first array is the special one, then the next arrays would have lower sums, but the code would incorrectly compare. \n\nThe code in program1.py currently does:\n\nInitialize tmp with the first array's value. Then for each subsequent array j (starting from 0?), compares to tmp. \n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = ... \n    compute value. \n    if j==0: tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp: then print j+1 and value - tmp\n        elif value < tmp: print 1 and tmp - value, and set tmp to value? \n        else: ... \n\nWait, this logic is flawed. Because the first array's value could be the special one, but then when another array has a value less than tmp (the first array's value), it would set tmp to that value, which is wrong. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute all the sums first, then find the array with the maximum sum. The difference between that array's sum and the others (which should all be equal except for that one) is the x. \n\nSo the code should first collect all the sums, then find the maximum. The array with the maximum sum is the special one, and the difference is the x. \n\nTherefore, the code in program1.py is incorrect as written. The current code's logic is trying to compare each array's sum to the first one, which is wrong. \n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nRead all the arrays, compute their sum (value), store them in a list. \n\nFind the array (index) where the value is maximum. \n\nThe difference between that value and the others (since all non-special arrays have the same sum) is the x. \n\nWait, but how do we know the original sum S? Because S is the sum of the non-special arrays. So the maximum array's value is S + x, and all others are S. So the x is (max_value - other_value). \n\nTherefore, the code should:\n\n- For each test case:\n\n   - Read n and m.\n\n   - Read n arrays, compute their sum (value) for each.\n\n   - Find the array with the maximum value. Let's call this max_val and its index (1-based) is the answer's k.\n\n   - The x is (max_val - (sum of any other array's value, except the max one)).\n\n   - Since all non-special arrays have the same sum, so pick any other array's value (or the minimum, since all non-special are same). \n\nWait, but what if all arrays except one have the same value, and one has a higher value? Then that's the special one. \n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nCompute all the values, then find the maximum. The index of the maximum is the k. The x is (max_val - (sum of any other array except the max one)). \n\nBut how to compute S? Well, S is the value of any non-special array. So, the x is (max_val - (sum of any non-special array's value)). \n\nTherefore, in code:\n\nsums = [compute each array's value]\n\nmax_val = max(sums)\n\nk_index = the index (starting from 0) where the max occurs. \n\nThen, the x is max_val - (sums[0] if 0 is not the max, else pick another one). \n\nAlternatively, compute the minimal value among all except the max. Wait, but all non-special arrays have the same sum. So the minimal value (since all non-special are same) would be the S. \n\nWait, the non-special arrays all have the same sum. So the minimal value in the list (excluding the max) is S. \n\nWait, but the max is the only one different. So the other arrays all have the same value. So, for example, the first array that is not the max can be used. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal value in the list is S, because the max is the only one higher. \n\nWait, yes. Because all non-special arrays have the same sum, so the minimal value in the list is S. \n\nWait, the max is the only one higher. So the minimal value is S. \n\nWait, but if there are multiple arrays with the same max? But the problem says the answer is unique, so that can't happen. \n\nTherefore, the minimal value in the list is S. \n\nWait, no. Suppose there are two arrays with the same max? Then the problem's constraints say that the input is valid, so that can't happen. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\nCompute all the sums. Find the array with the maximum sum. The x is (max_sum - (sum of any other array except the max one)). \n\nSo in code, for program1.py, the code should first collect all the sums, then process them. \n\nThe current code is trying to do it on the fly, which is wrong. \n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is in the else clause (when value == tmp). The current code's approach is flawed. \n\nThe correct approach would be to first read all the arrays and their sums, then process them. \n\nTherefore, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nIn the loop over the test cases:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read all n arrays, compute their value (sum of c_i * (index+1)), store in a list.\n\nThen find the index of the maximum value in that list. \n\nThe x is (max_val - (sums[0] if 0 is not the max, else pick another element)). \n\nWait, but how to compute S? Since S is the value of all non-special arrays, which are all the same. So S is the value of any array except the maximum one. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nsums = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = ... \n    compute value and append to sums. \n\nmax_val = max(sums)\nk = sums.index(max_val) +1  # since output is 1-based\n\n# compute S as the value of any other array. \n# pick the first element not the max. \n\nfor s in sums:\n    if s != max_val:\n        S = s\n        break\n\nx = max_val - S\n\nprint(k, x)\n\nSo the code in program1.py needs to be adjusted to collect all the sums first, then process them. \n\nThe current code is trying to do it incrementally, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is in the part where the code is supposed to collect all the sums first. \n\nLooking back at the given code for program1.py:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor i in range(case):\n    n,m = ... \n    tmp=0\n    for j in range(n):\n        list1 = ... \n        compute value. \n        if j==0: tmp = value\n        else:\n            ... \n\nSo the problem is that the code is not storing all the sums. \n\nThe correct approach would be to collect all the sums in a list. \n\nSo the code should be modified as follows:\n\nIn the loop over the test cases:\n\nsums = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k] * (k+1)\n    sums.append(value)\n# Now process sums to find the max and so on. \n\nThen, after collecting all sums, compute the max, find its index, and compute x. \n\nThe current code's logic is wrong because it's comparing each array's value to the first one, which may not be the correct approach. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then process them. \n\nThe original code's TODO is in the else clause when value == tmp. But that's part of a flawed approach. \n\nSo the correct code for program1.py would replace the existing loop with collecting all the sums first, then compute the required values. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py should be modified as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nsums = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k] * (k+1)\n    sums.append(value)\nmax_val = max(sums)\nk_index = sums.index(max_val) + 1  # 1-based\n# find S: any other value except max_val\nS = None\nfor s in sums:\n    if s != max_val:\n        S = s\n        break\nx = max_val - S\nprint(f\"{k_index} {x}\")\n\nSo the missing code in the original program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then process them. \n\nThe original code's current approach is incorrect, so the TODO part (the else clause) is part of a wrong path. The correct code requires changing the structure to collect all sums first. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py should be rewritten to first collect all the sums, then compute the max and so on. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe second problem is about counting the number of meta-sets among n cards. A meta-set is a group of five cards where there are more than one set within them. \n\nThe approach given in the code is trying to count for each pair of cards, the third card that would form a set, and then track how many times each card is part of a set. Then, the result is the sum over all cards of (count choose 2), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the code provided for program2.py is:\n\nimport sys; R = sys.stdin.readline\nn,k = map(int,R().split())\ndeck = [tuple(map(int,R().split())) for _ in range(n)]\ndic = {}\nfor i in range(n): dic[deck[i]] = i\nres = [0]*n\nfor p in range(n-2):\n    for q in range(p+1,n-1):\n        last = [0]*k\n        for j in range(k):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        last = tuple(last)\n        if last in dic and dic[last]>q:\n            res[p] += 1; res[q] += 1; res[dic[last]] += 1\nprint(sum((s*(s-1))//2 for s in res))\n\nThe code is trying to find for each pair of cards (p and q), the third card that forms a set with them. Then, for each such third card, it increments the count for p, q, and the third. \n\nThe idea is that each set contributes to three counts (each card in the set is part of that set). Then, the total number of meta-sets is the number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nWait, but how does the current code's approach relate to meta-sets? \n\nThe code's res array counts, for each card, how many sets it is part of. Then, for each card, the number of pairs of sets that include it would be C(res[i], 2). Summing over all cards gives the total number of pairs of sets that share a common card. But this might overcount, but perhaps the problem requires counting all 5-card groups that have at least two sets. \n\nHmm, the problem states that a meta-set is a group of five cards where there are strictly more than one set among them. \n\nThe approach in the code might be trying to count all possible pairs of sets that share a common card, and then use that to compute the number of 5-card groups. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is incomplete. The TODO is in the part where they compute the third card of the set given two cards. \n\nThe third card in a set given two cards can be computed for each feature. For each feature j, the third element must be such that the three are all same or all different. \n\nGiven two cards a and b, the third card c must satisfy for each feature j:\n\na[j], b[j], c[j] must be all same or all different. \n\nSo for each feature j, the third card's value must be such that a[j] + b[j] + c[j] is either 0 (all 0), 3 (all 1?), or 6 (all 2?), but that's not exactly right. Wait, perhaps for each feature, the third element is determined as follows: \n\nIf a[j] == b[j], then c[j] must be equal to them. \n\nIf a[j] != b[j], then c[j] must be the third value not equal to a[j] or b[j]. \n\nWait, let's think: \n\nSuppose for a feature, the two cards have values x and y. \n\nIf x == y, then the third must also be x (so all same). \n\nIf x != y, then the third must be the third value (so all different). \n\nSo for each feature j, the third card's value is:\n\nif a[j] == b[j], then c[j] = a[j]\n\nelse, c[j] = (3 - a[j] - b[j]) mod 3? \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose a[j] is 0 and b[j] is 1. Then the third must be 2. 0+1+2 =3. \n\nIf a is 0 and b is 2, then third is 1. \n\nSo the third value is 3 - (a + b) if a and b are different. \n\nWait, 0+1 \u2192 third is 2 \u2192 3- (0+1) = 2. \n\n0+2 \u2192 3- (0+2) =1. \n\n1+2 \u2192 3-3=0. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSo for each feature j, the third card's value is:\n\nif a[j] == b[j], then c[j] = a[j]\n\nelse, c[j] = 3 - a[j] - b[j]\n\nSo in code, for each j in 0..k-1:\n\nif a[j] == b[j], then last[j] = a[j]\n\nelse, last[j] = 3 - a[j] - b[j]\n\nTherefore, in the code's loop over p and q (indices of two cards), the third card is computed as follows:\n\ncard_p = deck[p]\n\ncard_q = deck[q]\n\nfor each j in 0..k-1:\n\n    if card_p[j] == card_q[j]:\n\n        last[j] = card_p[j]\n\n    else:\n\n        last[j] = 3 - card_p[j] - card_q[j]\n\nThen, check if this third card exists in the deck, and its index is after q (to avoid duplicates? Or perhaps to count each set only once?)\n\nWait, the code's current condition is \"if last in dic and dic[last] > q\". \n\nThis is to avoid counting the same set multiple times. Because for a set (a, b, c), the code would process pairs (a,b), (a,c), (b,c), each time finding the third card. To count each set exactly once, perhaps they are only considering the third card with index higher than q. \n\nBut the problem is that the code is trying to count for each pair (p, q), the third card, and then increment the counts for all three. \n\nThe res array counts how many sets each card is part of. \n\nThen, the total number of meta-sets is the sum over all cards of (res[i] choose 2). Because each pair of sets that share a common card contributes to a meta-set? \n\nWait, but how does this relate to the meta-sets of five cards? \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is that any five cards that contain at least two sets must have those two sets sharing a common card. So the total number of such pairs of sets (sharing a card) would be the sum over all cards of C(res[i], 2). But this counts all pairs of sets that share a common card, but each such pair could be part of a meta-set of five cards. However, this might overcount because the same five cards could have multiple pairs of sets. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires counting all 5-card groups that have at least two sets. The approach here might be incorrect, but given the code's structure, the missing part is the computation of the third card. \n\nThe code's TODO is in the loop over j in 0..k-1, where they need to compute last[j]. \n\nSo the code for the third card's j-th feature is as I described. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the inner loop for j in range(k):\n\nif card_p[j] == card_q[j]:\n    last[j] = card_p[j]\nelse:\n    last[j] = 3 - card_p[j] - card_q[j]\n\nWait, in code terms, the variables are:\n\ncard_p is deck[p], card_q is deck[q]. \n\nSo in code:\n\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = deck[p][j]\n    b = deck[q][j]\n    if a == b:\n        last[j] = a\n    else:\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO section is this. \n\nSo putting it all together, the code for program2.py's missing part is the loop over each feature to compute last[j]. \n\nSo the code for the TODO part is:\n\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = deck[p][j]\n    b = deck[q][j]\n    if a == b:\n        last[j] = a\n    else:\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b\n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, deck is a list of tuples. So deck[p][j] is the j-th feature of the p-th card. \n\nTherefore, the code for the TODO section is as above. \n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is the code inside the loop over j in range(k) to compute last[j]. \n\nTherefore, the final answers for the two programs are:\n\nFor program1.py, the code needs to collect all the sums first, then compute the max and so on. The original code's structure is incorrect, so the correct code would involve changing the loop to collect all sums first. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nLooking back at the original program1.py code:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    if j==0:\n        tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp:\n            print(str(j+1)+\" \"+str(value-tmp))\n        elif value < tmp:\n            print(\"1 \"+str(tmp-value))\n            tmp = value\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe problem is that this approach is incorrect. The correct approach requires collecting all the sums first. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. The original code's TODO is in the else clause (when value == tmp). \n\nBut the correct approach requires changing the entire structure. However, given the problem's constraints, perhaps the code can be fixed by realizing that the correct approach is to track the sum differences properly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach can be fixed. \n\nWait, the problem is that the code is trying to compare each array's sum to the first one, but that's not correct. \n\nSuppose the first array is the special one. Then its sum is S + x. The next arrays have sum S. \n\nIn that case, when j=1 (second array), the code would see that value (S) is less than tmp (S+x). So it would print \"1 \" + (tmp - value) \u2192 which would be x. But the correct k is 1 (the first array). \n\nBut the code would print \"1 \" + x, which is correct. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the first array is the special one. \n\nThen, for j=0 (the first array), tmp is set to its value (S + x). \n\nThen, for j=1 (second array), value is S. \n\nSince value < tmp, the code would print \"1 \" + (tmp - value) \u2192 which is (S+x - S) = x. \n\nThe printed k is 1 (correct), and the x is correct. \n\nThen, for j=2 (third array), value is S. \n\nThe code would again compare to tmp (which was S +x). \n\nSo the code would print \"1 \" + (S+x - S) again. \n\nBut this would print multiple lines for the same test case, which is wrong. \n\nAh, right! The code is printing for each array, which is incorrect. The code is supposed to process all arrays and then output the correct k and x once per test case. \n\nThe current code's structure is wrong because it's printing inside the loop over the arrays. \n\nSo the code is fundamentally incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach requires storing all the sums first, then processing them. \n\nHence, the missing code in program1.py is to replace the entire loop with collecting all the sums, then compute the max and so on. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code's TODO is in the else clause (when value == tmp). \n\nIn that case, perhaps the code can be fixed by realizing that when the current array's value equals the previous tmp, then we can keep tmp as is. \n\nBut the code's logic is flawed because it's trying to print immediately, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach requires changing the code structure. \n\nBut given the problem's constraints, perhaps the code can be fixed by changing the way tmp is handled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified to track the maximum value and the minimal value. \n\nAlternatively, the correct code for program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then compute the max and so on. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe original code's loop for the arrays is inside the test case loop. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor i in range(case):\n    n,m = ... \n    tmp=0\n    for j in range(n):\n        ... compute value. \n        if j==0: tmp = value\n        else:\n            ... \n\nThe correct code would need to collect all the sums into a list. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to replace the existing code with collecting all the sums first. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code's TODO is in the else clause (when value == tmp). \n\nIn that case, perhaps the code can be fixed by not doing anything in that case. \n\nWait, in the code's current logic, when value equals tmp, it's part of the non-special arrays. \n\nBut the code's logic is to compare each array's value to the first one. \n\nSuppose all arrays except one have the same value (the non-special sum S). The first array is non-special. \n\nThen, the code would set tmp to S. \n\nFor the next arrays, if their value is S, then the code does nothing (the else clause's else: part). \n\nBut the code currently has a TODO there. \n\nPerhaps the correct code in that case is to do nothing. \n\nBut the code's current approach is to print when the value is higher or lower than tmp, but this is only correct if the first array is not the special one. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect and needs to be restructured. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct code for program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then compute the max and so on. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to replace the existing code with the following:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nsums = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k] * (k+1)\n    sums.append(value)\nmax_val = max(sums)\nk_index = sums.index(max_val) + 1\nS = sums[0] if sums[0] != max_val else sums[1]\nx = max_val - S\nprint(f\"{k_index} {x}\")\n\nWait, but how to find S? \n\nAlternatively, after collecting all sums, find the minimal value (since all non-special arrays have the same sum, which is the minimal value if the max is the special one). \n\nWait, the non-special arrays all have the same sum. So the minimal value in the list is S. \n\nBecause the max is the only one higher. \n\nSo:\n\nS = min(sums)\n\nx = max_val - S \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nsums = [ ... compute all ... ]\n\nmax_val = max(sums)\n\nS = min(sums)\n\nx = max_val - S \n\nk_index = sums.index(max_val) +1 \n\nprint(k_index, x)\n\nThis would work. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py should be modified to collect all the sums first, then compute as above. \n\nThe original code's TODO is in the else clause (when value == tmp). \n\nThe correct code would not have that part, so the missing code is to replace the entire loop with the correct approach. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code's loop for j in range(n) has a TODO in the else clause. \n\nIn the current code, when value == tmp, the code does nothing. \n\nBut in the correct approach, we need to collect all the sums. \n\nTherefore, the code should be modified to collect all the sums into a list. \n\nThe missing code in program1.py is to replace the existing code with the code that collects all the sums first. \n\nBut since the user wants only the missing parts, perhaps the code can be adjusted by adding a list to store the sums. \n\nWait, the original code's loop for j in range(n) is inside the test case loop. \n\nThe code can be modified as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nsums = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    sums.append(value)\n# Now process sums to find max and so on. \n\nThen, after the loop over j, compute the max and so on. \n\nThe original code's code after the loop is wrong. \n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to replace the existing code after the j loop with the code that processes the sums. \n\nThe original code's code after the j loop is not present, but the current code is trying to print inside the j loop, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then compute the max and so on. \n\nThe missing code in program1.py is the part that collects the sums into a list and processes them. \n\nThe original code's existing code for the j loop is incorrect, so the missing code is to replace the existing code with the correct code. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop has a TODO in the else clause. \n\nThe correct code for that part is to do nothing, but the entire approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be fixed by changing the way tmp is handled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can track the maximum and the minimum. \n\nWait, here's another approach: \n\nThe correct answer is the array with the maximum sum. \n\nSo, during the loop over the arrays, we can track the maximum value and its index, and also track the minimal value (since all non-special arrays have the same sum). \n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_val = -infinity \n\nmin_val = infinity \n\nfor j in 0..n-1:\n\n    compute value \n\n    if value > max_val:\n\n        max_val = value \n\n        k_index = j+1 \n\n    if value < min_val:\n\n        min_val = value \n\nThen, x = max_val - min_val \n\nThis would work because the non-special arrays all have the same sum, so the minimal value is their sum. \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nmax_val = -float('inf')\n\nmin_val = float('inf')\n\nk_index = 0 \n\nfor j in range(n):\n\n    list1 = ... \n\n    value = ... \n\n    if value > max_val:\n\n        max_val = value \n\n        k_index = j+1 \n\n    if value < min_val:\n\n        min_val = value \n\nx = max_val - min_val \n\nprint(k_index, x)\n\nThis approach doesn't require storing all the sums, just tracking max and min. \n\nThis is better because it uses O(1) space. \n\nThis would work because the non-special arrays all have the same sum. So the minimal value is that sum. \n\nYes! Because the non-special arrays all have the same sum S. The special array has sum S + x. \n\nThus, the minimal value in the list is S (since all non-special arrays have S, and the special has a higher value). \n\nTherefore, the code can be written this way. \n\nSo the code for program1.py can be adjusted as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nmax_val = -float('inf')\n\nmin_val = float('inf')\n\nk_index = 0 \n\nfor j in range(n):\n\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n\n    value = 0\n\n    for k in range(m):\n\n        value += list1[k] * (k+1)\n\n    if value > max_val:\n\n        max_val = value \n\n        k_index = j+1 \n\n    if value < min_val:\n\n        min_val = value \n\nx = max_val - min_val \n\nprint(k_index, x)\n\nThis way, the code doesn't need to store all the sums, just track max and min. \n\nThis is better and efficient. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to replace the existing code with this approach. \n\nThe original code's loop for j in range(n) has a TODO in the else clause. \n\nThe correct code would replace the entire loop with the code that tracks max and min. \n\nThe original code's code after the j loop is wrong (printing inside the loop), so the missing code is to replace the entire block with the correct code. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop is:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    if j==0:\n        tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp:\n            print(str(j+1)+\" \"+str(value-tmp))\n        elif value < tmp:\n            print(\"1 \"+str(tmp-value))\n            tmp = value\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe correct code for this loop is to track max and min. \n\nSo the missing code is to replace the entire block with the code that tracks max and min. \n\nBut the user wants only the missing parts. \n\nThe original code's TODO is in the else clause (when value == tmp). \n\nIn the correct approach, the code doesn't need to do anything in that case. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the else clause (when value == tmp) can be left empty. \n\nBut the rest of the code is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct code can be written by modifying the existing code to track max and min. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be adjusted as follows:\n\nInitialize max_val and min_val properly. \n\nThe original code's tmp is used to track the first value. \n\nBut the correct approach requires tracking max and min. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to replace the existing code with the correct approach. \n\nBut since the user wants only the missing parts, perhaps the code can be adjusted by adding variables to track max and min. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop can be modified as follows:\n\nInitialize max_val and min_val:\n\nmax_val = -infinity \n\nmin_val = infinity \n\nk_index = 0 \n\nThen, inside the loop:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n\n    ... compute value \n\n    if value > max_val:\n\n        max_val = value \n\n        k_index = j+1 \n\n    if value < min_val:\n\n        min_val = value \n\nThen, after the loop, compute x and print. \n\nThe original code's code has the loop with the if j==0: tmp = value. \n\nSo the missing code is to replace the existing code with the code that tracks max and min. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the code that tracks max and min, and the final print. \n\nThe original code's code after the loop is wrong (printing inside the loop), so the missing code is to replace the entire loop and add the final print. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop has a TODO in the else clause. \n\nThe correct code for that part is to do nothing. \n\nBut the rest of the code is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for program1.py is to replace the entire loop with the code that tracks max and min. \n\nThe missing code for program1.py is the code that does this. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop is:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    if j==0:\n        tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp:\n            print(str(j+1)+\" \"+str(value-tmp))\n        elif value < tmp:\n            print(\"1 \"+str(tmp-value))\n            tmp = value\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe correct code for this loop is:\n\nmax_val = -float('inf')\nmin_val = float('inf')\nk_index = 0\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k] * (k+1)\n    if value > max_val:\n        max_val = value\n        k_index = j + 1\n    if value < min_val:\n        min_val = value\n# After the loop, compute x and print\nx = max_val - min_val\nprint(f\"{k_index} {x}\")\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is to replace the existing loop with this code. \n\nThe original code's loop has the if j==0 and other conditions, which are replaced by the new code. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop is incorrect. The missing code is the entire block that replaces it. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the code that tracks max and min, and the final print. \n\nNow, for program2.py's missing code:\n\nThe code's TODO is in the loop over j in range(k):\n\nThe code needs to compute last[j] as follows:\n\na = deck[p][j]\n\nb = deck[q][j]\n\nif a == b:\n\n    last[j] = a \n\nelse:\n\n    last[j] = 3 - a - b \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = deck[p][j]\n    b = deck[q][j]\n    if a == b:\n        last[j] = a\n    else:\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is this loop. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"max_val = -float('inf')\\nmin_val = float('inf')\\nk_index = 0\\nfor j in range(n):\\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\\n    value = 0\\n    for k in range(m):\\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\\n    if value > max_val:\\n        max_val = value\\n        k_index = j+1\\n    if value < min_val:\\n        min_val = value\\nx = max_val - min_val\\nprint(f\\\"{k_index} {x}\\\")\",\n  \"program2\": \"for j in range(k):\\n    a = deck[p][j]\\n    b = deck[q][j]\\n    if a == b:\\n        last[j] = a\\n    else:\\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b\"\n}\n\nWait, but the original code for program1.py has the loop for j in range(n) inside the test case loop. \n\nThe code I wrote for program1's missing part includes the loop and the final print. \n\nThe original code's existing code for the j loop is replaced by this new code. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is the entire block that replaces the existing loop and adds the final print. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop is inside the test case loop. \n\nThe correct code for program1's missing part is the code that replaces the existing loop and adds the final print. \n\nThus, the JSON should have the program1's missing code as the code that replaces the existing loop and adds the final print. \n\nThe original code's code for the j loop is:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    if j==0:\n        tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp:\n            print(str(j+1)+\" \"+str(value-tmp))\n        elif value < tmp:\n            print(\"1 \"+str(tmp-value))\n            tmp = value\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code is to replace this entire block with the new code. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is the entire block of code that does the max and min tracking and the final print. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should have the program1's missing code as the code that does this. \n\nThe program2's missing code is the loop inside the p and q loops. \n\nThus, the final answer is as above."
