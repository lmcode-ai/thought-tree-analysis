The first problem is about simulating stones falling in a grid until they hit an obstacle or another stone. The input is multiple test cases, each with a grid. The stones ('*') fall down until they can't anymore. The output should show the grid after all stones have settled. Looking at the provided code for program1.py, it seems like the code is trying to process each test case. The outer loop is for each test case.",

Now, implementing this in Python. However, given the constraints (n up to 2e5), we need to optimize the space. Using a list of dictionaries or tuples for each step. Let me think of using two arrays for previous and current states. Each state can be represented as a dictionary or a list of tuples. Let's represent prev_dp as a list of two elements (for c=0 and 1), each of which is a list of two elements (for p=0 and 1), storing (cost, segments). Initialize prev_dp as follows:\n\n                      prev_dp is a 2x2 array. For the first character (i=0):\n\n                          current_char = s[0]\n\n                          c0 = 1 if current_char == '1' else 0\n\n                          for c in 0,1:\n\n                              cost = 1 if c != c0 else 0\n\n                              prev_dp[c][1] = (cost, 1)\n\n                          prev_dp[c][0] remains as infinity. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n                          curr_dp is initialized to all (infinity, infinity). current_char = s[i]\n\n                          current_c = 1 if current_char == '1' else 0\n\n                          for prev_c in 0,1:\n\n                              for prev_p in 0,1:\n\n                                  if prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] is not infinity:\n\n                                      # option 1: continue the segment\n\n                                      new_p = (prev_p +1) %2\n\n                                      new_c = prev_c\n\n                                      new_cost = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] + (1 if (current_c ! = new_c) else 0)\n\n                                      new_segs = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][1]\n\n                                      if new_cost < curr_dp[new_c][new_p][0] or (new_cost == curr_dp[new_c][new_p][0] and new_segs < curr_dp[new_c][new_p][1]):\n\n                                          curr_dp[new_c][new_p] = (new_cost, new_segs)\n\n                                      # option 2: start new segment\n\n                                      if prev_p ==0:\n\n                                          for new_c_new in 0,1:\n\n                                              new_p_new =1\n\n                                              cost_new = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] + (1 if (current_c != new_c_new) else 0)\n\n                                              segs_new = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][1] +1 if cost_new < curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new][0] or (cost_new == curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new][0] and segs_new < curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new][1]):\n\n                                                  curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new] = (cost_new, segs_new)\n\n                          prev_dp = curr_dp\n\n                      After processing all characters, we look for the minimal cost among all c and p=0. The minimal cost and corresponding segments are tracked. Now, implementing this in code. However, in Python, for efficiency, we can represent prev_dp as a list of lists of tuples. Let's proceed. Now, the code for program2.py would look like this:\n\n                      import sys\n\n                      def main():\n\n                          import sys\n\n                          input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n                          t = int(input[0])\n\n                          ptr =1\n\n                          for _ in range(t):\n\n                              n = int(input[ptr])\n\n                              ptr +=1\n\n                              s = input[ptr]\n\n                              ptr +=1\n\n                              # Initialize DP\n\n                              INF = float('inf')\n\n                              prev_dp = [ [ (INF, INF) for _ in range(2) ] for _ in range(2) ]\n\n                              first_char = s[0]\n\n                              c0 = 1 if first_char == '1' else 0\n\n                              for c in 0,1:\n\n                                  cost = 1 if c != c0 else 0\n\n                                  prev_dp[c][1] = (cost, 1)\n\n                              for i in range(1, n):\n\n                                  curr_dp = [ [ (INF, INF) for _ in range(2) ] for _ in range(2) ]\n\n                                  current_char = s[i]\n\n                                  current_c = 1 if current_char == '1' else 0\n\n                                  for prev_c in 0,1:\n\n                                      for prev_p in 0,1:\n\n                                          if prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] == INF:\n\n                                              continue\n\n                                          # Option 1: continue the segment\n\n                                          new_p = (prev_p +1) %2\n\n                                          new_c = prev_c\n\n                                          new_cost = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] + (1 if (current_c ! = new_c) else 0)\n\n                                          new_segs = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][1]\n\n                                          if new_cost < curr_dp[new_c][new_p][0] or (new_cost == curr_dp[new_c][new_p][0] and new_segs < curr_dp[new_c][new_p][1]):\n\n                                              curr_dp[new_c][new_p] = (new_cost, new_segs)\n\n                                          # Option 2: start new segment\n\n                                          if prev_p ==0:\n\n                                              for new_c_new in 0,1:\n\n                                                  new_p_new =1\n\n                                                  cost_new = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] + (1 if (current_c != new_c_new) else 0)\n\n                                                  segs_new = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][1] +1\n\n                                                  if cost_new < curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new][0] or (cost_new == curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new][0] and segs_new < curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new][1]):\n\n                                                      curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new] = (cost_new, segs_new)\n\n                                  prev_dp = curr_dp\n\n                              # Find the minimal cost and corresponding segments\n\n                              min_cost = INF\n\n                              best_segs = INF\n\n                              for c in 0,1:\n\n                                  cost, segs = prev_dp[c][0]\n\n                                  if cost < min_cost or (cost == min_cost and segs < best_segs):\n\n                                      min_cost = cost\n\n                                      best_segs = segs\n\n                              print(min_cost, best_segs)\n\n                      if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n                          main() However, this code may have some errors, but it's the general approach.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe first problem is about simulating stones falling in a grid until they hit an obstacle or another stone. The input is multiple test cases, each with a grid. The stones ('*') fall down until they can't anymore. The output should show the grid after all stones have settled.\n\nLooking at the provided code for program1.py, it seems like the code is trying to process each test case. The outer loop is for each test case. Then, they read n and m, then the grid into a list of lists. Then there's a loop for each column (since the inner loop is over int(b[1]), which is m, the number of columns). Then for each column, they're trying to track something with count and row. The code inside the loop for each column is a bit confusing. Let me think about the approach.\n\nThe idea is that for each column, we need to process the stones falling. For each column, the stones in that column will fall down as far as possible. So perhaps for each column, we can process from the bottom up, and track where the stones should end up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each column, we can collect all the stones and obstacles, then determine where the stones should land. Let's think of the column as a list. The stones can only fall until they hit an obstacle or another stone. So in a column, the order from bottom to top would determine where the stones settle.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process each column independently. For each column, we can process from the bottom to the top. Let's think of each column as a vertical line. The stones in this column will fall down until they hit an obstacle or another stone. So the steps for a column would be:\n\n- Start from the bottom. Any stone ('*') in the bottom row can't fall further, so it stays. Obstacles ('o') block the stones above them.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is for each column, we can track the positions where stones can land. Let's think of each column as a list. We can process each column from the bottom up, and for each cell, decide where the stones would end up.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nFor each column in the grid:\n\n- We can collect all the cells in that column, then process them from the bottom up.\n\nWait, maybe for each column, we can track the current \"floor\" where the next stone can fall to. Let's see:\n\nInitialize for the column, the current floor is the bottom row (row n-1). Then, we go up each row in the column:\n\n- If the cell is an obstacle 'o', then any stones above it can't pass through. So the floor is set to the row above the obstacle (since the obstacle itself is a barrier). Wait, no. The obstacle blocks stones from below. Wait, when processing from the top down, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, process each column from the bottom up. Let's think of each column as a list of cells. For each cell in the column, starting from the bottom, we can track where the stones would end up.\n\nWait, here's a better way. For each column, the stones in that column will fall down as far as possible. So the stones can only fall into positions below them that are empty ('.'), until they hit an obstacle or another stone.\n\nSo for each column, the process is:\n\n- The stones in the column will settle in the lowest possible positions, below any obstacles or other stones.\n\nSo, for each column, we can process the cells from the bottom to the top. Let's collect all the stones and obstacles in the column, then determine where each stone should be placed.\n\nAlternatively, here's an algorithm for a single column:\n\n1. For the current column, collect all the cells from top to bottom (or bottom to top?), and track where the stones can fall.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to process each column from the bottom up, and track the current position where a stone can be placed.\n\nLet me think of the column as a list of cells. Let's process each cell from the bottom up (starting at row n-1, going up to 0). For each cell in the column:\n\n- If the cell is an obstacle 'o', then the stones above it cannot pass through. So any stones above this cell can't fall below this obstacle. So the next possible position for stones above is above this obstacle.\n\n- If the cell is a stone '*', then it can fall down until it hits something. Wait, but since we are processing from the bottom up, perhaps we can track the current \"floor\" where stones can land.\n\nHmm, maybe the approach is:\n\nFor each column:\n\n- Start from the bottom. The current available position is the bottom row.\n\n- We go up each row in the column. For each cell (starting from the top of the column and moving down? Or the other way around? Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's process each column from the bottom to the top. Let's have a variable that tracks the current lowest position where a stone can be placed. Initially, this is the bottom row (row n-1). As we go up each row in the column:\n\n- If the current cell is an obstacle 'o', then the current available position is set to the row above this obstacle (since the obstacle blocks anything below it). So stones above this obstacle can't fall below it. So the next available position is the row above the obstacle.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that whenever we hit an obstacle, the stones above it can't go below that obstacle. So the available positions for stones above are between the obstacle and the next obstacle or the top.\n\nAlternatively, here's a step-by-step approach for a column:\n\nInitialize the current \"floor\" (the lowest possible position a stone can fall to) as the bottom row (row n-1).\n\nWe process each row from the bottom up (starting at row n-1, then n-2, etc.):\n\nWait, no. Let's process from the top down? Or bottom up?\n\nWait, let's process each column from the bottom to the top. Let me think:\n\nInitialize the current floor as the bottom row (row n-1). For each row in the column, starting from the bottom and moving up:\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to process each column from the bottom to the top. Let me think of each column as a list of cells from bottom to top. For each cell in the column (starting from the bottom and moving up):\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each column:\n\n- We can create a new list for the column's final state.\n\n- We start from the bottom of the column and go up.\n\n- We track the current position where the next stone can be placed. Initially, this is the bottom row.\n\n- For each cell in the column, starting from the bottom and moving up:\n\n   - If the cell is an obstacle 'o', then any stones above it can't pass through. So the current position is set to the row above this obstacle. Also, in the new column, this position must be set to 'o'.\n\n   - If the cell is a stone '*', then we can place it at the current position (since it can fall down to there). Then, the current position moves up by 1 (since the next stone can't be placed below this one).\n\n   - If the cell is '.', then we leave it as is for now, but the current position remains the same (since empty cells don't block).\n\nWait, maybe this is getting complicated. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose a column has the following cells from top to bottom (rows 0 to 3):\n\nRow 0: *\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 2: o\n\nRow 3: *\n\nProcessing from bottom (row 3) up:\n\nStart with current position at row 3 (the bottom). \n\nRow 3 is *, so we place it at current position (row3). Then current position moves up to row2.\n\nRow2 is o. So we need to place the o at its original position. The current position is now row1 (since the o is at row2, so stones above can't go below row2. So the next available position is row1? Or row2-1?\n\nWait, perhaps when we hit an obstacle, the current position is set to the row above the obstacle. Because the obstacle itself is at row2, so stones above can't go below row2. So the next available position for stones above is row1 (since row2 is blocked).\n\nSo when processing row2 (the o), we set the current position to row1 (since the obstacle is at row2, so the next possible position is row1). Also, the obstacle must stay in its place.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_floor = bottom row (row3 in this case).\n\nWe process each row from bottom to top (starting at row3, then row2, row1, row0).\n\nWait, no, processing from bottom to top would mean starting at row3, then row2, etc. So for each row in the column, starting from the bottom (row3) and moving up to row0:\n\nWait, perhaps the correct order is to process each row in the column from the bottom up (starting at the bottom row and moving up). Let me think again.\n\nLet me try the example:\n\nOriginal column (rows 0 to 3):\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: .\n\nRow2: o\n\nRow3: *\n\nProcessing from bottom (row3) up to row0:\n\nStart with current_floor = 3 (the bottom row).\n\nProcessing row3 (current cell is *):\n\nSince it's a stone, we can place it at current_floor (3). So in the new column, row3 will have a *.\n\nThen, current_floor moves up to 2 (since the next stone can't be placed below row3 now).\n\nNext, row2 (current cell is o):\n\nThis is an obstacle. So we need to place it at row2. The obstacle can't be moved. So in the new column, row2 is o.\n\nNow, the current_floor is set to row2 -1 = 1. Because any stones above row2 can't fall below row2. So the next available position is row1.\n\nThen, row1 (current cell is '.'):\n\nThis is empty. So we leave it as '.' for now. The current_floor remains at 1 (since empty cells don't block).\n\nThen, row0 (current cell is *):\n\nThis is a stone. We can place it at current_floor (1). So in the new column, row1 will have a *, and current_floor moves up to 0.\n\nSo the new column would be:\n\nRow0: . (since the original row0's * was moved to row1)\n\nRow1: * (from row0's * and placed at current_floor 1)\n\nRow2: o (original)\n\nRow3: * (original)\n\nWait, but the original row3's * was placed at row3, so that's correct. The row0's * is now at row1. The row1's '.' remains as '.'?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the new column is built by processing each cell from bottom to top. Let me think of the new column as a list where each position is filled based on the processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nFor each column:\n\n- Create a list to hold the new column's cells.\n\n- The new column starts as all '.'.\n\n- The current_floor starts at the bottom row (row n-1).\n\n- We process each row from the bottom to the top (starting at row n-1, then n-2, etc.):\n\n   For the current row (starting from bottom):\n\n   - If the current cell is 'o' (obstacle):\n\n      - Place 'o' in the new column's current row.\n\n      - The current_floor is now set to row -1 (since stones can't go below this obstacle).\n\n   - Else if the current cell is '*':\n\n      - Place '*' in the new column at current_floor.\n\n      - current_floor decreases by 1 (since the next stone can be placed one row above).\n\n   - Else (current cell is '.'):\n\n      - Leave it as '.' in the new column.\n\n      - current_floor remains the same.\n\nWait, but this might not work because the current_floor is the position where the next stone can be placed. Let me see with the example:\n\nOriginal column (rows 0-3):\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: .\n\nRow2: o\n\nRow3: *\n\nProcessing from bottom (row3) up:\n\nInitialize new_col as [ '.', '.', '.', '.' ] (assuming 4 rows).\n\ncurrent_floor = 3 (row3).\n\nProcessing row3 (cell is *):\n\nPlace '*' at new_col[3] (current_floor is 3). Then current_floor becomes 2.\n\nProcessing row2 (cell is o):\n\nPlace 'o' at new_col[2]. Then current_floor is set to 2-1 =1.\n\nProcessing row1 (cell is '.'):\n\nLeave as '.' in new_col[1]. current_floor remains 1.\n\nProcessing row0 (cell is *):\n\nPlace '*' at new_col[1] (current_floor is 1). Then current_floor becomes 0.\n\nSo the new column would be:\n\nRow0: '.' (since new_col[0] is '.')\n\nRow1: '*' (new_col[1] is set here)\n\nRow2: 'o' (new_col[2])\n\nRow3: '*' (new_col[3])\n\nWait, but the original row0's * is placed at row1, which is correct. The original row3's * is at row3. The obstacle at row2 is in place. So the new column is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose a column has:\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: *\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow3: .\n\nProcessing from bottom (row3):\n\ncurrent_floor starts at 3.\n\nRow3 is '.' \u2192 leave as '.' in new_col[3]. current_floor remains 3.\n\nRow2 is '.' \u2192 same, new_col[2] is '.' \u2192 current_floor still 3.\n\nRow1 is * \u2192 place at current_floor (3). new_col[3] becomes *, current_floor 2.\n\nRow0 is * \u2192 place at 2 \u2192 new_col[2] is *, current_floor 1.\n\nSo the new column would be:\n\nRow0: '.' (since new_col[0] is '.')\n\nRow1: '.' (new_col[1] is '.')\n\nRow2: * (placed at 2)\n\nRow3: * (placed at 3)\n\nWait, but the original two *s in rows 0 and 1 would both fall to the bottom. So the new column's rows 2 and 3 would have the *s. That's correct.\n\nHmm, this seems to work. So the algorithm for each column is:\n\n- For each column, process each row from bottom to top.\n\n- Keep track of current_floor (the lowest available position for a stone).\n\n- When encountering an obstacle, set the new column's cell to 'o', and set current_floor to row-1 (since stones can't go below the obstacle).\n\n- When encountering a stone, place it at current_floor, then decrement current_floor.\n\n- For '.' cells, leave as '.' and current_floor remains.\n\nSo the code for program1.py needs to implement this for each column.\n\nLooking back at the provided code for program1.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor i in range(int(b[1])):  # m columns?\n\nWait, the variables in the code: the first line after reading the test case is:\n\nb = input().split() \u2192 which is the n and m for the grid. So b[0] is n (rows), b[1] is m (columns).\n\nThen, the code loops over each column (since the loop is for i in range(int(b[1])) \u2192 m times, which is the number of columns).\n\nInside that loop, the code is trying to process each column. The variables:\n\ncount=0\n\nrow = int(b[0])-1 \u2192 which is the last row (since rows are 0-based).\n\nThen, for j in range(int(b[0])) \u2192 which is n rows. Wait, but the loop variable j is from 0 to n-1, but the code is using row which starts at the bottom (row = n-1) and then row -=1 each time. So the inner loop is for j in 0..n-1, but the row is being decremented each step. So this is processing each row in the column from bottom to top.\n\nWait, the code's inner loop is:\n\nfor j in range(int(b[0])):  # j from 0 to n-1\n\n    if a[row][i] == '.' \u2192 since row starts at n-1 (the bottom row), then row decreases by 1 each step. So for each j, the row is moving up.\n\nWait, the code's variables are a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe outer loop is over each column (i from 0 to m-1). For each column i:\n\nThen, the code initializes count=0, row = n-1 (the bottom row).\n\nThen, for j in 0 to n-1 (the number of rows):\n\n   process a[row][i], which is the current row in the column.\n\n   row -=1 each time.\n\nSo this is processing each row in the column from bottom to top (since row starts at n-1 and decreases by 1 each step).\n\nThe code's current approach is trying to track something with count, but the problem is in the 'else' clause (when the cell is '*').\n\nThe code's current code for the column processing is:\n\nfor each column i:\n\n    count =0\n\n    row = n-1\n\n    for j in 0..n-1:\n\n        if a[row][i] is '.' \u2192 count +=1\n\n        elif a[row][i] is 'o' \u2192 count=0\n\n        else:  # it's a '*' \u2192 the stone\n\n            # TODO: code here\n\n        row -=1\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track how many empty cells are below, but it's not the right approach.\n\nThe correct approach, as per the algorithm I thought of earlier, is to track the current_floor and for each cell in the column (processed from bottom to top), decide where to place the stone or obstacle.\n\nSo the code needs to, for each column, create a new column array, and track current_floor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can process each column and for each cell in the column, determine where the stone should be placed.\n\nLet me think of how to code this.\n\nThe code in program1.py currently has a loop over each column (i from 0 to m-1). For each column, the code is trying to process each row in that column from bottom to top.\n\nThe code's current code for the column processing is incomplete. The 'else' clause (when the cell is '*') is where the code needs to be filled.\n\nWait, the code's current structure is:\n\nfor each column i in 0..m-1:\n\n    count =0\n\n    row = n-1\n\n    for j in 0..n-1:\n\n        current_cell = a[row][i]\n\n        if current_cell == '.' :\n\n            count +=1\n\n        elif current_cell == 'o':\n\n            count =0\n\n        else:  # it's a '*' (stone)\n\n            # TODO: code here\n\n        row -=1\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of empty cells below, but that's not the right approach.\n\nThe correct approach would be to track the current_floor for each column. Let me think of how to code this.\n\nPerhaps for each column, we can process each row from bottom to top, and track the current_floor. Let's see:\n\nInside the loop over each column (i):\n\nInitialize current_floor to the bottom row (n-1).\n\nWe can create a temporary list for the new column's state. Or, since we can't modify the original array while processing, perhaps we need to create a new array for each column and then update the original grid.\n\nAlternatively, since modifying the grid in place might be tricky (since processing columns in order and modifying rows could interfere), perhaps we can create a new grid for each test case.\n\nWait, the code currently has a as the grid (a list of lists). So for each column, we can process it and update the grid.\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\nFor each column i (from 0 to m-1):\n\n   create a list to hold the new column's cells.\n\n   current_floor starts at n-1 (the bottom row).\n\n   for each row in 0 to n-1 (but processing from bottom to top):\n\n      Wait, perhaps we need to loop from the bottom to the top of the column.\n\n      So for row in reversed(range(n)): \u2192 from n-1 down to 0.\n\n      Wait, but in the code's current structure, the loop is over j in 0..n-1, and row starts at n-1 and decreases by 1 each step. So the loop variable j is just a counter, and row is moving from n-1 down to 0.\n\n      So for each step in the inner loop (j from 0 to n-1):\n\n          current_row = row (starts at n-1, then n-2, etc.)\n\n          current_cell = a[current_row][i]\n\n          process this cell.\n\n          row -=1\n\n      So the order is correct.\n\n      So for each current_row (from bottom to top):\n\n          if the cell is 'o' (obstacle):\n\n              the new column's current_row is 'o'\n\n              current_floor is set to current_row -1 (since stones can't go below this obstacle)\n\n          elif the cell is '*':\n\n              if current_floor >= current_row:\n\n                  # can't place here, but need to place the stone at current_floor?\n\n                  # Wait, no. The stone is at current_row, but it can fall down to current_floor.\n\n                  # So we need to place the stone at current_floor, and then current_floor is decremented.\n\n                  # So in the new column, the current_floor position gets the '*' and the current_row's cell becomes '.'?\n\n                  # Hmm, perhaps the new column's current_floor is set to '*' and the original cell's position is '.'.\n\n                  # So in the new column array, at position current_floor, we set to '*' and then current_floor -=1.\n\n                  # But how to track this?\n\n                  # Maybe we need to track the new column's cells in a temporary array.\n\n                  # Let me think of the steps again.\n\n                  # Let's create a temporary array for the new column.\n\n                  # Initialize new_col as a list of '.' for each row.\n\n                  # current_floor starts at n-1.\n\n                  # Then, for each row from bottom to top (current_row):\n\n                  #   if cell is 'o':\n\n                  #       new_col[current_row] = 'o'\n\n                  #       current_floor = current_row -1\n\n                  #   elif cell is '*':\n\n                  #       new_col[current_floor] = '*'\n\n                  #       current_floor -=1\n\n                  #   else: # '.' :\n\n                  #       new_col[current_row] = '.' (no change?)\n\n                  #       current_floor remains.\n\n                  # Then, after processing all rows, the new_col is the updated column.\n\n                  # So in code, for each column i:\n\n                  # create new_col as a list of '.' of length n.\n\n                  # current_floor = n-1\n\n                  # for current_row in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n\n                  #     cell = a[current_row][i]\n\n                  #     if cell == 'o':\n\n                  #         new_col[current_row] = 'o'\n\n                  #         current_floor = current_row -1\n\n                  #     elif cell == '*':\n\n                  #         new_col[current_floor] = '*'\n\n                  #         current_floor -=1\n\n                  #     else: # '.' :\n\n                  #         new_col[current_row] = '.' \n\n                  #         # but wait, the '.' can stay unless a stone is placed there.\n\n                  #         # Wait, no.

So a is a list where each element is a row (a list of characters). So to update column i, for each row r, a[r][i] = new_col[r].\n\n                  # So this would work.\n\n                  # But in the current code structure, the code is inside a loop over columns, and for each column, processing each row in the column.\n\n                  # So the code needs to be restructured to do this.\n\n                  # However, the current code's structure is not set up for this. The current code's inner loop is trying to do something with count and row, but it's not the right approach.\n\n                  # So the correct approach is to process each column as above, and the code needs to be written in the program1.py's missing part.\n\n                  # Looking back at the code given for program1.py:\n\n                  The code currently has:\n\n                  for i in range(int(b[1])):  # loop over columns\n\n                      count=0\n\n                      row=int(b[0])-1\n\n                      for j in range(int(b[0])):  # loop over rows in the column, from bottom to top via row -=1\n\n                          if a[row][i] == '.' :\n\n                              count +=1\n\n                          elif a[row][i] == 'o':\n\n                              count=0\n\n                          else:  # it's a '*' \n\n                              # TODO: code here\n\n                          row -=1\n\n                      ... \n\n                  So the code is trying to process each column, but the approach is not correct. The 'count' variable is not helpful here.\n\n                  The correct approach requires for each column to track current_floor and build a new column array. So the code needs to be rewritten.\n\n                  Since the user's code is incomplete, the missing part is in the 'else' clause (when the cell is '*'). But perhaps the entire approach is wrong and needs to be replaced.\n\n                  However, given the code structure, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of possible positions for stones, but it's not working. So the correct way would be to process each column as per the algorithm I outlined, and the code needs to be written in the program1.py's missing parts.\n\n                  But given the current code structure, perhaps the code is not following the correct approach, so the missing code is not just a few lines but requires a different approach. However, the user's instruction says to output the missing code, so perhaps the code is supposed to be filled in the 'else' clause.\n\n                  Wait, the code's 'else' clause is when the cell is a '*' (stone). The code needs to do something here. Let me think again.\n\n                  The code's current approach is:\n\n                  For each column, the code is looping through each row in the column from bottom to top (row starts at n-1 and decreases by 1 each step). The variables count and row are being used, but it's unclear.\n\n                  Perhaps the code is trying to track how many empty cells are below the current position, but that's not the right way.\n\n                  Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of stones that can fall, but it's not clear.\n\n                  Since the code is incomplete, perhaps the correct approach is to process each column and for each cell in the column, determine where the stone should be placed.\n\n                  Given that the code's structure is looping over each column and each row in the column (from bottom to top), perhaps the code can track the current_floor and for each cell:\n\n                  Let me try to think of the code in the 'else' clause (when the cell is '*'):\n\n                  The code is inside the loop over rows in the column (for j in 0..n-1):\n\n                  current_row = row (starts at n-1, then n-2, etc.)\n\n                  current_cell = a[row][i]\n\n                  if current_cell is '.' \u2192 count +=1\n\n                  elif 'o' \u2192 count=0\n\n                  else (it's a '*'):\n\n                      # need to place this stone as low as possible.\n\n                      # perhaps the stone can fall to the current_floor, which is the current row plus count?\n\n                      # Not sure.\n\n                      # Alternatively, the code needs to set the stone to the current_floor, and set the current cell to '.'.\n\n                      # But how to track current_floor?\n\n                      # Maybe the code should track current_floor as the lowest possible position.\n\n                      # Perhaps the code should have variables like current_floor, and for each cell:\n\n                      # if it's a stone, then it can fall to current_floor, and current_floor is decremented.\n\n                      # But the current code's variables are not set up for this.\n\n                      # So perhaps the code needs to be restructured.\n\n                      # Since the user's code is given, and the problem requires to fill in the missing parts, perhaps the code is supposed to track the current_floor and move the stones.\n\n                      # Let me think of the code's variables:\n\n                      # The code has 'count' which is incremented when '.' is found, reset to 0 when 'o' is found.\n\n                      # Maybe 'count' is the number of empty cells below the current position where the stone can fall.\n\n                      # So when a stone is encountered, it can fall down to the current row plus count?\n\n                      # Not sure.\n\n                      # Alternatively, the code is trying to track the number of empty cells below the current row, so that the stone can fall there.\n\n                      # For example, when a stone is at row r, the number of empty cells below it (including the current row?) is count.\n\n                      # So the stone can fall to row r + count?\n\n                      # Not sure.\n\n                      # This approach might not be correct.\n\n                      # Since the code is stuck in the 'else' clause, perhaps the correct code here is to set a[row][i] to '.' and then set the current_floor (which is stored in some variable) to place the stone there.\n\n                      # But without knowing the variables, it's hard to say.\n\n                      # Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to move the stone to the current_floor, which is tracked via count.\n\n                      # For example, when a stone is found, it can fall down to the current row plus count (the number of empty cells below it).\n\n                      # But this is getting too vague.\n\n                      # Maybe the correct approach is to process each column and for each cell in the column from bottom to top, track the current_floor.\n\n                      # So the code needs to be restructured, but given the current code's structure, perhaps the missing code is:\n\n                      # In the 'else' clause (when the cell is '*'):\n\n                      # We can place the stone at the current_floor, which is the current row plus count?\n\n                      # Not sure.\n\n                      # Alternatively, perhaps the code should set the current cell to '.' and then set the current_floor (which is stored in count?) to the current position.\n\n                      # This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the correct algorithm and see how to code it.\n\n                      # The correct algorithm for each column is:\n\n                      # 1. Initialize new_col as all '.'.\n\n                      # 2. current_floor starts at the bottom row (n-1).\n\n                      # 3. For each row from bottom to top:\n\n                      #    a. if cell is 'o':\n\n                      #        new_col[row] = 'o'\n\n                      #        current_floor = row -1\n\n                      #    b. elif cell is '*':\n\n                      #        new_col[current_floor] = '*'\n\n                      #        current_floor -=1\n\n                      #    c. else (.):\n\n                      #        new_col[row] = '.'

(since it's a stone, but where to place it?)\n\n                      # Then, the stone should be placed at row + count (count is 0 here?), so row3 +0 \u2192 row3. So set a[3][i] to '*' again?\n\n                      # Not helpful.\n\n                      # This is getting too stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the second problem and come back.\n\n                      # Now, moving to program2.py.\n\n                      The second problem is about finding the minimum number of changes to a binary string so that when divided into contiguous subsegments of same characters, all subsegments have even length, and also find the minimal number of subsegments possible with that minimal changes.\n\n                      The input is multiple test cases. For each, a binary string of even length n.\n\n                      The output is two numbers: the minimal changes, and the minimal number of subsegments.\n\n                      The example given: for \"1110011000\", the minimal changes are 0? Wait no, the example says that in the second, third, and fourth test cases, the string is good initially, so no changes needed. Wait the first test case's example required 3 changes.\n\n                      The approach for this problem is to find the minimal changes so that the string can be divided into subsegments of even length, all same characters, and the minimal number of changes.\n\n                      The key is to model the problem as follows:\n\n                      The string must be partitioned into segments where each segment is a run of the same character, and each segment's length is even.\n\n                      To achieve this, we can consider that each segment must be of even length. So between any two different characters, the transition must occur at even positions.\n\n                      Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to ensure that every pair of consecutive characters must alternate in a way that allows even-length segments.\n\n                      Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: the string must be divided into segments of even length, each consisting of the same character. To do this, the transitions between different characters must occur at even positions.\n\n                      For example, the string \"1100\" can be divided into \"11\" and \"00\", which are both even.\n\n                      The problem requires that the minimal number of changes to achieve this, and among those, the minimal number of segments.\n\n                      To model this, perhaps we can model it as a dynamic programming problem, where for each position, we track the minimal changes and the number of segments.\n\n                      Let me think of the string as being processed from left to right. At each position, we can decide whether to end a segment here or not.\n\n                      However, since the segments must be even-length, the transitions must happen at even intervals.\n\n                      Alternatively, the key is that each segment must have even length. So the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length, each of which is all 0's or all 1's.\n\n                      To minimize the number of changes, we can model this as follows:\n\n                      For each position i (0-based), we can track the minimal changes up to i, and the parity of the current segment's length (whether it's even or odd).\n\n                      Wait, perhaps the DP state can be:\n\n                      dp[i][c][l], where c is the current character (0 or 1), and l is the length of the current segment modulo 2 (0 for even, 1 for odd). But this might be manageable.\n\n                      Alternatively, since the segments must be even-length, the current segment's length must be even when a new segment starts.\n\n                      Hmm, perhaps the DP approach is better.\n\n                      Let me think of the DP state as follows:\n\n                      Let dp[i][k] be the minimal number of changes needed up to position i, with the last segment ending at i, and the last segment's length is even (so k is 0 or 1 indicating the parity of the current segment's length? Or maybe track the current segment's length modulo 2).\n\n                      Alternatively, the state can be:\n\n                      dp[i][last_char][current_length_parity], where current_length_parity is 0 or 1 (even or odd).\n\n                      But this might get complicated.\n\n                      Alternatively, since each segment must be even-length, the transitions must happen at even positions. So for each position i, the previous segment must have ended at i-1, and the current segment starts at i, but that's not helpful.\n\n                      Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows:\n\n                      The string must be divided into segments of even length. Each segment must be all 0's or all 1's.\n\n                      To minimize the number of changes, we can consider that for each possible even-length segment ending at position i, we can track the minimal changes.\n\n                      Let me think of the string as being processed in pairs of characters. Since the length is even, perhaps the minimal changes can be determined by ensuring that every pair of characters is the same, or that transitions happen every even steps.\n\n                      Wait, another approach: the minimal changes required is the number of positions where the current character differs from the desired pattern.\n\n                      The desired pattern must be such that every even-length segment is of the same character.\n\n                      To achieve this, the string must be divided into segments of even length, each of which is all 0's or all 1's.\n\n                      The minimal changes would be the minimal number of flips required to make this possible.\n\n                      To find this, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that the string must alternate between segments of even length of 0's and 1's, but the segments can be of any even length as long as they are contiguous.\n\n                      Alternatively, the optimal way is to have the segments alternate between 0 and 1, but this may not be necessary. The segments can be any even-length runs of the same character.\n\n                      The key is to find a partition of the string into even-length segments, and compute the minimal changes required to make each segment uniform.\n\n                      To find the minimal changes, we can consider all possible ways to partition the string into even-length segments and choose the one with the minimal changes.\n\n                      However, this is computationally infeasible for large n (up to 2e5).\n\n                      So we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\n                      Let me think of the DP state as follows:\n\n                      Let dp[i] be the minimal number of changes needed up to position i.\n\n                      Additionally, we need to track the last character and the length of the current segment modulo 2.\n\n                      Wait, perhaps the state can be:\n\n                      dp[i][c][l], where c is the current character (0 or 1), and l is the length of the current segment modulo 2 (0 or 1).\n\n                      The idea is that when processing the i-th character, we can decide whether to continue the current segment or start a new one.\n\n                      For example:\n\n                      At position i, if the current segment is of length even (l=0), then we can choose to end the segment here (if the next segment starts at i+1), but that would require the current segment's length to be even.\n\n                      Alternatively, the transitions can be:\n\n                      For each position i, and for each possible state (current character and current length parity), we can decide whether to extend the current segment or start a new one.\n\n                      Let me formalize this:\n\n                      The DP state is dp[i][c][p], where:\n\n                      - i is the current position (0-based).\n\n                      - c is the current character (0 or 1).\n\n                      - p is the parity of the current segment's length (0 for even, 1 for odd).\n\n                      The value of dp[i][c][p] is the minimal number of changes needed up to position i, with the current segment ending at i, having character c, and parity p.\n\n                      The transitions would be:\n\n                      For each position i:\n\n                      For each possible previous state (prev_c, prev_p):\n\n                          if the previous segment ended at i-1 with parity prev_p:\n\n                              if we continue the segment:\n\n                                  new_p = (prev_p + 1) % 2\n\n                                  new_c = prev_c\n\n                                  the current character must be set to prev_c (so cost is 0 if s[i] == prev_c, else 1).\n\n                                  So the new cost is dp[i-1][prev_c][prev_p] + (cost).\n\n                                  We can update dp[i][new_c][new_p] with this value.\n\n                              else:\n\n                                  we start a new segment here.\n\n                                  The new segment must have length 1 (so parity 1), but since it's a new segment, the previous segment must have been even length.\n\n                                  So the previous segment's parity must have been 0 (even).\n\n                                  So if prev_p is 0:\n\n                                      new_c is the current character (either 0 or 1, but we choose whichever gives minimal cost).\n\n                                      The new segment starts at i, so its length is 1 (parity 1).\n\n                                      The cost is dp[i-1][prev_c][0] + (cost to set s[i] to new_c).\n\n                                      We can choose new_c as 0 or 1, whichever gives the minimal cost.\n\n                                      Wait, but we have to choose the new_c as the desired character for the new segment.\n\n                                      So for starting a new segment, the new_c can be either 0 or 1, and we choose whichever gives the minimal cost.\n\n                                      So for each possible new_c (0 or 1):\n\n                                          cost = dp[i-1][prev_c][0] + (s[i] != new_c ? 1 : 0)\n\n                                          then, we can update dp[i][new_c][1] with this cost.\n\n                      The base case would be:\n\n                      At position 0:\n\n                          if we start a segment with character s[0], then the cost is 0 (if we don't change it) or 1 (if we change it to the other).\n\n                          So for c in 0 and 1:\n\n                              cost = (s[0] != c ? 1 : 0)\n\n                              dp[0][c][1] = cost (since length is 1, parity 1).\n\n                      Then, after processing all positions, the answer is the minimal value among all dp[n-1][c][0], since the last segment must have even length (parity 0).\n\n                      Additionally, we also need to track the number of segments for the minimal cost.\n\n                      However, this approach may be feasible for n up to 2e5, but with three dimensions (n, 2, 2), it would be O(n * 2 * 2) = O(n), which is acceptable.\n\n                      But we also need to track the number of segments for each state to find the minimal number of segments when the cost is minimal.\n\n                      So the DP state needs to track both the cost and the number of segments.\n\n                      Let me redefine the DP state as a tuple (cost, segments).\n\n                      So for each state (i, c, p), we store the minimal cost and the corresponding number of segments.\n\n                      The transitions would then be:\n\n                      For each state (i-1, prev_c, prev_p):\n\n                          if we continue the segment:\n\n                              new_p = (prev_p +1) %2\n\n                              new_c = prev_c\n\n                              cost = current cost + (s[i] != new_c ? 1 :0)\n\n                              segments = previous segments count.\n\n                              So update dp[i][new_c][new_p] with this cost and segments.\n\n                          else:\n\n                              if prev_p is 0 (so the previous segment was even):\n\n                                  for new_c in 0 and 1:\n\n                                      cost = previous cost + (s[i] != new_c ? 1 :0)\n\n                                      segments = previous segments +1\n\n                                      update dp[i][new_c][1] with this cost and segments.\n\n                      The base case would be:\n\n                      At position 0:\n\n                          for c in 0 and 1:\n\n                              cost = (s[0] != c ? 1 :0)\n\n                              segments =1\n\n                              dp[0][c][1] = (cost, segments)\n\n                      Then, after processing all positions, we look for the minimal cost among all dp[n-1][c][0], and among those with minimal cost, find the minimal segments.\n\n                      This seems feasible.\n\n                      Now, implementing this in code.\n\n                      The code provided for program2.py is:\n\n                      inp = [*open(0)]\n\n                      for s in inp[2::2]:\n\n                          s = s.strip()\n\n                          res = 0\n\n                          mseg = 1\n\n                          prebit = None\n\n                          for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n\n                              if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n\n                                  res +=1\n\n                              else:\n\n                                  if prebit is None:\n\n                                      prebit = s[2*i]\n\n                                  else:\n\n                                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n                          print(res, mseg)\n\n                      The code is trying to process the string in pairs of characters. For each pair (i*2 and i*2+1), if they are different, it increments the res (number of changes). But this is not correct, because the problem requires the entire segments to be even length, not just pairs.\n\n                      The current code's approach is to check every two characters and see if they are the same. If not, it requires a change. But this is not sufficient because the segments can be longer than 2.\n\n                      For example, the sample input \"11001111\" is divided into \"11\", \"00\", \"1111\" which are all even lengths. The pairs (0,1) are same, (2,3) same, (4,5) same (but the third segment is length 4, so pairs (4-5 and 6-7 are same).\n\n                      The current code would count the changes where pairs are different. But in the sample input, all pairs are same, so res is 0, which matches the sample.\n\n                      However, the code's logic is incorrect because it's not considering the entire segments. For example, a string like \"0000\" can be divided into one segment of length 4 (even), so no changes needed. The current code would count 0 changes, which is correct.\n\n                      But for a string like \"0011\", the current code would count 0 changes (since pairs are same), which is correct.\n\n                      However, the code's 'mseg' is initialized to 1, and in the else clause (when the pair is same), it checks prebit. The code's logic is unclear.\n\n                      The current code's approach is not correct for all cases. For example, consider the string \"0000\". The code would process each pair (0-1, 2-3), both pairs are same. So res is 0. The mseg is initialized to 1. The prebit is set to '0' in the first iteration (i=0), then in the next iteration (i=1), the else clause is entered, and since prebit is not None, the code has a TODO.\n\n                      The current code's approach is not correct, so the missing code needs to be filled in to track the number of segments.\n\n                      The correct approach is to use the dynamic programming method outlined earlier.\n\n                      So the code for program2.py should be rewritten using the DP approach.\n\n                      However, given the user's instruction to fill in the missing code in the provided code structure, perhaps the code is supposed to track the number of segments by counting the number of transitions between different characters in even-length segments.\n\n                      Alternatively, the problem requires that the minimal changes are computed by ensuring that every even-length segment is uniform. The minimal changes can be computed by ensuring that every pair of characters must be the same. Because if every pair is the same, then the entire string can be divided into segments of even length (each pair is a segment of length 2).\n\n                      Wait, this is an interesting observation. If every pair of consecutive characters must be the same, then the entire string is a single segment of even length (if n is even). Or, the string can be divided into segments of length 2 each. This would require that every pair is the same. The minimal changes would be the number of positions where s[2i] != s[2i+1], for all i from 0 to n/2-1.\n\n                      But this is not the case. For example, the sample input \"11001111\" can be divided into segments of length 2, 2, and 4. The pairs (0,1) are same, (2,3) same, (4,5) same, (6,7) same. So the number of changes would be 0, which matches the sample.\n\n                      Another example: the string \"1110011000\" (from the problem's note) is good initially. The pairs are:\n\n                      0-1: '11' \u2192 same.\n\n                      2-3: '10' \u2192 different. Wait, but the sample says it's good. Wait the example says the string is \"1110011000\" which is divided into \"111\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\". Wait, but the lengths are 3, 2, 2, 3 \u2192 which are not all even. So perhaps I misunderstood the example.\n\n                      Wait the problem's note says:\n\n                      \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\n                      So the example string must be divided into segments with even lengths. So perhaps the example string is different.\n\n                      Anyway, the key idea is that if every pair of characters is the same, then the minimal changes are zero, and the minimal number of segments is n/2 (each pair is a segment). But this is not the minimal number of segments. For example, if the entire string is all 0's, then it can be divided into one segment of length n (even), so the number of segments is 1, which is better than n/2.\n\n                      So the initial approach of counting the number of differing pairs is not sufficient.\n\n                      Thus, the correct approach is the dynamic programming one.\n\n                      Now, implementing the DP approach in code.\n\n                      Let me outline the steps:\n\n                      For each test case:\n\n                          Read n and s.\n\n                          Initialize a DP table. Since n can be up to 2e5, we need to use a rolling array to save space.\n\n                          The DP can be represented as two arrays: previous and current.\n\n                          Each array has entries for (c, p), where c is 0 or 1, and p is 0 or 1.\n\n                          Each entry stores the minimal cost and the number of segments.\n\n                          Initialize the DP for position 0.\n\n                          Then, iterate through each position from 1 to n-1.\n\n                          After processing all positions, find the minimal cost among all states where the last segment's parity is 0 (even length).\n\n                          Among those with minimal cost, find the minimal number of segments.\n\n                      Let's code this.\n\n                      The code structure would be something like:\n\n                      for each test case:\n\n                          n = int(input())\n\n                          s = input().strip()\n\n                          # Initialize DP\n\n                          prev_dp = [[(infinity, infinity) for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(2)]\n\n                          # for position 0:\n\n                          c0 = int(s[0] == '1')\n\n                          for c in 0,1:\n\n                              cost = 1 if (c != c0) else 0\n\n                              prev_dp[c][1] = (cost, 1)\n\n                          for i in 1 to n-1:\n\n                              curr_dp = [[(inf, inf) for _ in 0..1] for c in 0..1]\n\n                              current_char = s[i]\n\n                              current_c = int(current_char == '1')\n\n                              for prev_c in 0,1:\n\n                                  for prev_p in 0,1:\n\n                                      if prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p] is not infinity:\n\n                                          # option 1: continue the segment\n\n                                          new_p = (prev_p +1) %2\n\n                                          new_c = prev_c\n\n                                          cost = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] + (1 if (current_c != new_c) else 0)\n\n                                          segs = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][1]\n\n                                          if this is better than curr_dp[new_c][new_p], update.\n\n                                          # option 2: start new segment\n\n                                          if prev_p ==0: # previous segment was even\n\n                                              for new_c_new in 0,1:\n\n                                                  new_p_new =1\n\n                                                  cost_new = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] + (1 if (current_c != new_c_new) else 0)\n\n                                                  segs_new = prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][1] +1\n\n                                                  if this is better than curr_dp[new_c_new][new_p_new], update.\n\n                              prev_dp = curr_dp\n\n                          # after processing all positions:\n\n                          min_cost = infinity\n\n                          best_segs = infinity\n\n                          for c in 0,1:\n\n                              if prev_dp[c][0][0] < min_cost or (equal and prev_dp[c][0][1] < best_segs):\n\n                                  update min_cost and best_segs.\n\n                          print(min_cost, best_segs)\n\n                      This is a rough outline.\n\n                      Now, implementing this in Python.\n\n                      However, given the constraints (n up to 2e5), we need to optimize the space. Using a list of dictionaries or tuples for each step.\n\n                      Let me think of using two arrays for previous and current states.\n\n                      Each state can be represented as a dictionary or a list of tuples.\n\n                      Let's represent prev_dp as a list of two elements (for c=0 and 1), each of which is a list of two elements (for p=0 and 1), storing (cost, segments).\n\n                      Initialize prev_dp as follows:\n\n                      prev_dp is a 2x2 array.\n\n                      For the first character (i=0):\n\n                          current_char = s[0]\n\n                          c0 = 1 if current_char == '1' else 0\n\n                          for c in 0,1:\n\n                              cost = 1 if c != c0 else 0\n\n                              prev_dp[c][1] = (cost, 1)\n\n                          prev_dp[c][0] remains as infinity.\n\n                      Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n                          curr_dp is initialized to all (infinity, infinity).\n\n                          current_char = s[i]\n\n                          current_c = 1 if current_char == '1' else 0\n\n                          for prev_c in 0,1:\n\n                              for prev_p in 0,1:\n\n                                  if prev_dp[prev_c][prev_p][0] is not infinity:\n\n                                      #
