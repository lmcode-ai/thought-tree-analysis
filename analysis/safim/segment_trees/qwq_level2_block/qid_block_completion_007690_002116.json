Because for a grid, the sum of the coordinates (i + j) is constant along a diagonal. Similarly, the right diagonal index could be a - b + some offset. Wait, looking at the code's initialization for right: the right array's index is calculated as a + (B-1 - b). Let me see: B is the number of columns. So for a cell (a, b), the anti-diagonal index is a + (B-1 - b) = (a - b) + (B-1).",

So for each a and b:\n\nleft[left_index] += nums[a][b]\nright[right_index] += nums[a][b]\n\nWait, but how are the indices calculated? Let's see:\n\nleft_index is a + b. Since for a grid with rows A and columns B, the maximum a + b would be (A-1)+(B-1) = A+B-2. The array left has size C = A+B-1, so the indices from 0 to C-1. So that's correct. The right_index is a + (B-1 - b). Let's see: for example, when b is 0, the term is B-1, so the index is a + (B-1 -0) = a + B-1. The maximum possible a is A-1, so the maximum index would be (A-1)+(B-1) = A+B-2, same as the left. So the right array's indices are correctly covered by the C size. Therefore, the code for the TODO should be:\n\nleft[left_index] += nums[a][b]\nright[right_index] += nums[a][b]\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are named left and right.

Maybe I should look for a pattern in the example. The a array is [1,2,3], and the B array is [0,2,1]. Looking at the B array:\n\nB[1] =0 \u2192 which is a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 \u21921^2^3 =0 \u2192 correct.

Looking back at the example's b matrix:\n\nFor row 2, column 3:\n\nb_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} \u21922 XOR0 \u21922. b_{2,2} is computed as b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} \u21921 XOR3 \u21922. b_{1,3} is 0. Hmm, so B[2] is 2, which is the value of b_{2,2} (2) XOR b_{1,3} (0). Hmm. Hmm, perhaps the B array can be expressed as the cumulative XOR of the a array from the end, but with some offset. Wait, let's think of the B array as follows:\n\nB[i] = a_i XOR B[i+1]\n\nThen, solving for a_i gives a_i = B[i] XOR B[i+1]. In the example:\n\nB[3] =1 \u2192 a3 =1 XOR0 \u21921 \u2192 but actual a3 is3 \u2192 no. Hmm. Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is a_i = B[i] XOR B[i-1], with B[0] =0. In the example:\n\na1 = B[1] XOR B[0] \u21920^0=0 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm. Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for the solution in the code's structure.

So for each cell (i,j) where both are at least 1, the value is the XOR of the cell to the left (same row, j-1) and the cell above (i-1, same column). Hmm. Let's see for the last column (j = n). Let's see what b_{i,n} is. Let me try to find a pattern for b_{i,n} in terms of a's elements. Let me think recursively. Let's see for small n.\n\nTake n=1:\n\nThe matrix is 2x2 (since n+1 rows and columns). The last column (j=1) has b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR a_1 = a_1. So the input would be [a_1], so the solution is a_1 = that value. So straightforward. n=2: The last column (j=2) has entries for i=1 and 2. For i=1, j=2:\n\nb_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2}\n\nBut b_{0,2} is a_2. b_{1,1} is b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR a_1 = a_1. So b_{1,2} = a_1 XOR a_2. For i=2, j=2:\n\nb_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2}\n\nBut b_{2,1} is computed as follows:\n\nb_{2,1} = b_{2,0} (0) XOR b_{1,1} (a_1) \u2192 a_1. So b_{2,2} = a_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) \u2192 (a_1 XOR a_1) is 0, so XOR with a_2 gives a_2. Wait, so for n=2, the input would be [a1 XOR a2, a2]. So given those two values, how do we get a1 and a2? Suppose the input is [x, y]. Then y must be a2. So a2 = y. Then x must be a1 XOR a2 \u2192 a1 = x XOR a2 = x XOR y.\n\nSo that works. So for n=2, the a array is [x XOR y, y]. Hmm, so the pattern might be that a_n is equal to the last element of the input (since for i=n, j=n, the value is b_{n,n} = ... but let's see for n=3. In the example given, the input is [0,2,1]. So for n=3, the a array is [1,2,3]. Looking at the last column entries:\n\nb_{3,3} (assuming 0-based? Wait the problem says the input is for 1-based i from 1 to n. Wait the problem says the input is b_{i,n} for 1 \u2264i \u2264n. So for n=3, the input is the values of b_{1,3}, b_{2,3}, b_{3,3}. Wait in the example, the given input is [0,2,1], which corresponds to those three values. Let's see:\n\nThe a array is [1,2,3]. Let's compute the b matrix. The first row (row 0) has entries 0, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3 (since columns 0 to 3). Row 1 (i=1):\n\nb_{1,0}=0.\n\nb_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} \u2192 0 XOR 1 \u21921. b_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} \u21921 XOR2 \u21923. b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} \u21923 XOR3 \u21920. Which matches the first element of the input. Row 2 (i=2):\n\nb_{2,0}=0. b_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} \u21920 XOR1 \u21921. b_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} \u21921 XOR3 \u21922. b_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} \u21922 XOR0 \u21922. Which matches the second input element.\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\nb_{3,0}=0.\n\nb_{3,1} = b_{3,0} XOR b_{2,1} \u21920 XOR1 \u21921. b_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2} \u21921 XOR2 \u21923. b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} \u21923 XOR2 \u21921. Which matches the third input element. So the input is [0,2,1], and the a array is [1,2,3]. Hmm, so for the last element of the input (b_{3,3}=1), which is a3? No, a3 is 3. So that's not directly. So the a array's elements are not directly the last column's entries except for the last one? Wait in the example, the last entry of the input is 1, but a3 is 3. So that's not the case. So the a array can't be directly read from the last column.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to find the maximum sum a bishop can attack on a chessboard. The approach given in the code seems to involve precomputing sums for the diagonals. The bishop's attack covers two diagonals: the left and right ones. The code uses left and right arrays to store the sums of each diagonal. The left array probably represents the sum for the diagonals that go from top-left to bottom-right (like the main diagonals), and the right array might be for the anti-diagonals (top-right to bottom-left). \n\nIn the code, the loops for a and b are iterating over each cell. The TODO is where we need to compute the sums for each diagonal. For each cell (a, b), the left diagonal index is a + b. Because for a grid, the sum of the coordinates (i + j) is constant along a diagonal. Similarly, the right diagonal index could be a - b + some offset. Wait, looking at the code's initialization for right: the right array's index is calculated as a + (B-1 - b). Let me see: B is the number of columns. So for a cell (a, b), the anti-diagonal index is a + (B-1 - b) = (a - b) + (B-1). Since a and b start from 0, this would give a unique index for each anti-diagonal. So for each cell, we need to add the current cell's value to both the left and right arrays at their respective indices.\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is to accumulate the current cell's value into the left and right arrays. So for each a and b:\n\nleft[left_index] += nums[a][b]\nright[right_index] += nums[a][b]\n\nWait, but how are the indices calculated? Let's see:\n\nleft_index is a + b. Since for a grid with rows A and columns B, the maximum a + b would be (A-1)+(B-1) = A+B-2. The array left has size C = A+B-1, so the indices from 0 to C-1. So that's correct.\n\nThe right_index is a + (B-1 - b). Let's see: for example, when b is 0, the term is B-1, so the index is a + (B-1 -0) = a + B-1. The maximum possible a is A-1, so the maximum index would be (A-1)+(B-1) = A+B-2, same as the left. So the right array's indices are correctly covered by the C size.\n\nTherefore, the code for the TODO should be:\n\nleft[left_index] += nums[a][b]\nright[right_index] += nums[a][b]\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are named left and right. So the code inside the loops would be:\n\nleft[left_index] += nums[a][b]\nright[right_index] += nums[a][b]\n\nYes. So that's the missing part.\n\nThen, after computing left and right arrays, for each cell (a, b), the total sum the bishop would attack is left[left_index] + right[right_index] minus the current cell's value (since it's counted in both diagonals). The code does that in the damage calculation. So that part is okay.\n\nSo the missing code in program1 is those two lines inside the loops.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to reconstruct array a from the last column of the matrix b. The matrix b is built with certain rules. Let me re-read the problem description.\n\nThe matrix b is (n+1)x(n+1). The rules are:\n\n- b_{i,0} = 0 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264n.\n\n- b_{0,i} = a_i for 1 \u2264i \u2264n. Wait, the problem says \"b_{0,i} = a_i if 1 \u2264i \u2264n\". Wait, the a array is 1-indexed, so a_i is from a_1 to a_n. So the first row (0th index in 0-based) of the matrix's elements from column 1 to n are the a elements.\n\nThen, for the other elements, b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j} when 1 \u2264i,j \u2264n.\n\nThe input gives us the last column (columns n) of the matrix for rows 1 to n. So the input is the list of b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}.\n\nWe need to find any possible a array that could produce these values, or output -1 if impossible.\n\nHmm. The approach in the code provided is using some bitwise operations. The code starts by reading the array a (but probably that's a misnomer here; the input is the b's last column, so maybe the code is using a to store the input values). The code then loops over k in 0,1 and for each bit up to 19 (since 2^30 is the max, so 30 bits). The inner loop is over bits, and for each j (element in a?), if j has the bit set, then do something. But the code is incomplete.\n\nThe problem requires reconstructing a from the given b's last column. Let me think of the recurrence relations.\n\nLet me think of the matrix b's construction. Let's see for small n. Let's take the example given in the note:\n\nSample input for the example's b's last column is [0,2,1], which corresponds to n=3. The a array is [1,2,3].\n\nLooking at the matrix's last column (column 3 in 0-based?), but the problem says the input is b_{i,n} for 1<=i<=n. So for n=3, the input is the values of b_{1,3}, b_{2,3}, b_{3,3}.\n\nIn the example, the last column (column index n=3, but in 0-based it's 3?), the values are 0,2,1. \n\nThe key is to find a way to express the given b's last column in terms of a's elements. Let's see if there's a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me think of the recurrence for b_{i,j}. The value at (i,j) is the XOR of the cell to the left (same row, j-1) and the cell above (i-1, same column). \n\nWait, the problem says for 1 \u2264i,j \u2264n, so the indices are 1-based? Or 0-based? The problem says the matrix is 0-indexed. Wait the problem says matrix b is 0-indexed. So the first row is row 0, and the first column is column 0. \n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"b_{i,0} = 0 if 0 \u2264i \u2264n; b_{0,i} = a_i if 1 \u2264i \u2264n\". Since a is 1-indexed, so for 1-based i in a, so the first row (row 0) of the matrix has elements from column 1 to n as a_1 to a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is for 1 \u2264i,j \u2264n (since the other cases are covered by the base cases). So for each cell (i,j) where both are at least 1, the value is the XOR of the cell to the left (same row, j-1) and the cell above (i-1, same column).\n\nHmm. Let's see for the last column (j = n). Let's see what b_{i,n} is.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for b_{i,n} in terms of a's elements.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's see for small n.\n\nTake n=1:\n\nThe matrix is 2x2 (since n+1 rows and columns). The last column (j=1) has b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR a_1 = a_1. So the input would be [a_1], so the solution is a_1 = that value. So straightforward.\n\nn=2:\n\nThe last column (j=2) has entries for i=1 and 2.\n\nFor i=1, j=2:\n\nb_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2}\n\nBut b_{0,2} is a_2. \n\nb_{1,1} is b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR a_1 = a_1.\n\nSo b_{1,2} = a_1 XOR a_2.\n\nFor i=2, j=2:\n\nb_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2}\n\nBut b_{2,1} is computed as follows:\n\nb_{2,1} = b_{2,0} (0) XOR b_{1,1} (a_1) \u2192 a_1.\n\nSo b_{2,2} = a_1 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) \u2192 (a_1 XOR a_1) is 0, so XOR with a_2 gives a_2.\n\nWait, so for n=2, the input would be [a1 XOR a2, a2]. So given those two values, how do we get a1 and a2?\n\nSuppose the input is [x, y]. Then y must be a2. So a2 = y. Then x must be a1 XOR a2 \u2192 a1 = x XOR a2 = x XOR y.\n\nSo that works. So for n=2, the a array is [x XOR y, y].\n\nHmm, so the pattern might be that a_n is equal to the last element of the input (since for i=n, j=n, the value is b_{n,n} = ... but let's see for n=3.\n\nIn the example given, the input is [0,2,1]. So for n=3, the a array is [1,2,3].\n\nLooking at the last column entries:\n\nb_{3,3} (assuming 0-based? Wait the problem says the input is for 1-based i from 1 to n. Wait the problem says the input is b_{i,n} for 1 \u2264i \u2264n. So for n=3, the input is the values of b_{1,3}, b_{2,3}, b_{3,3}.\n\nWait in the example, the given input is [0,2,1], which corresponds to those three values. Let's see:\n\nThe a array is [1,2,3]. Let's compute the b matrix.\n\nThe first row (row 0) has entries 0, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3 (since columns 0 to 3).\n\nRow 1 (i=1):\n\nb_{1,0}=0.\n\nb_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} \u2192 0 XOR 1 \u21921.\n\nb_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} \u21921 XOR2 \u21923.\n\nb_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} \u21923 XOR3 \u21920. Which matches the first element of the input.\n\nRow 2 (i=2):\n\nb_{2,0}=0.\n\nb_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} \u21920 XOR1 \u21921.\n\nb_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} \u21921 XOR3 \u21922.\n\nb_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} \u21922 XOR0 \u21922. Which matches the second input element.\n\nRow3 (i=3):\n\nb_{3,0}=0.\n\nb_{3,1} = b_{3,0} XOR b_{2,1} \u21920 XOR1 \u21921.\n\nb_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2} \u21921 XOR2 \u21923.\n\nb_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} \u21923 XOR2 \u21921. Which matches the third input element.\n\nSo the input is [0,2,1], and the a array is [1,2,3].\n\nHmm, so for the last element of the input (b_{3,3}=1), which is a3? No, a3 is 3. So that's not directly. So the a array's elements are not directly the last column's entries except for the last one?\n\nWait in the example, the last entry of the input is 1, but a3 is 3. So that's not the case. So the a array can't be directly read from the last column.\n\nHmm, so how to find a from the given b's last column?\n\nLooking for a pattern, perhaps each a_i can be derived from the XOR of certain elements in the input array.\n\nLet me think of the last column entries as an array B where B[i] = b_{i,n} for 1<=i<=n.\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nB = [0,2,1]\n\na = [1,2,3]\n\nLooking for a relation between B and a.\n\nLet me see for each a_i:\n\na_1 = 1. B[1] is 0. B[2] is 2, B[3] is 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps a_i is the XOR of B[i], B[i+1], ..., B[n]?\n\nWait for a_1:\n\nLooking at B[1], B[2], B[3], their XOR is 0 XOR2 XOR1 = 3, which is not a1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a_i is B[i] XOR B[i-1]?\n\nWait for i=1, B[1] is 0. B[0] doesn't exist. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array can be found by reversing the B array and then doing some XOR operations.\n\nWait in the example, the B array is [0,2,1]. Reversed gives [1,2,0]. The a array is [1,2,3]. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to express a_i in terms of B's elements through some XOR operations.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's see for the last element a_n. \n\nLooking at the last row (i =n, j =n):\n\nb_{n,n} = b_{n,n-1} XOR b_{n-1,n}\n\nBut b_{n,n-1} is part of the previous column. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array can be derived by taking the B array and XOR-ing certain bits in reverse order.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the bits of the numbers. Since XOR is a bitwise operation, perhaps each bit can be considered independently.\n\nSuppose we process each bit from the highest to the lowest. For each bit position, decide whether a_i has that bit set based on the B array.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the B array as a vector and find a way to express a in terms of B.\n\nLet me think of the recurrence for the last column. Let's see for each i, B[i] = b_{i,n}.\n\nWe can try to find a recurrence for B[i] in terms of a's elements.\n\nLet me see for the last column (j =n):\n\nFor each row i from 1 to n:\n\nb_{i,n} = b_{i, n-1} XOR b_{i-1, n}\n\nBut b_{i-1,n} is B[i-1], since that's the entry in row i-1, column n.\n\nWait, but the problem is that b_{i,n-1} is part of the previous column, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where B[i] = a_i XOR B[i+1]. Let me test this with the example.\n\nIn the example:\n\nFor i=3 (the last element), B[3] =1. If the formula holds, then a_3 = B[3] XOR B[4], but B[4] doesn't exist. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait let's see for i=2:\n\nB[2] =2. If a_2 = B[2] XOR B[3], then 2 XOR1 =3, but a_2 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think of the B array as the cumulative XOR from a certain direction.\n\nWait let's think of the B array as follows:\n\nSuppose that B[i] = a_i XOR B[i+1]. Then, solving for a_i gives a_i = B[i] XOR B[i+1]. Let's see:\n\nIn the example:\n\nB[1] =0, B[2]=2, B[3]=1.\n\nThen a_1 = B[1] XOR B[2] \u21920 XOR2 =2. But the actual a_1 is 1. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe a_i = B[i] XOR B[i-1], but for i>1. Let's see:\n\nFor i=3, a_3 would be B[3] XOR B[2] \u21921 XOR2 =3, which matches. For i=2, a_2 = B[2] XOR B[1] \u21922 XOR0=2, which matches. For i=1, a_1 = B[1] XOR B[0], but B[0] is not part of the input. Since B starts at i=1, perhaps B[0] is 0? Let's see:\n\nIf B[0] is 0, then a_1 =0 XOR0 (since B[1] is 0) \u21920? No, but a_1 is 1. Hmm, not quite.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is a_i = B[i] XOR B[i-1], with B[0] =0. Let's see:\n\nFor the example:\n\nB[0] =0.\n\na_1 = B[1] XOR B[0] \u21920 XOR0 =0 \u2192 no, but a_1 is 1.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is a_i = B[i] XOR B[i+1], but with B[n+1] =0. Let's see:\n\nIn the example, B[3] is 1. Then a_3 = B[3] XOR B[4] (0) \u21921. But the actual a_3 is 3. So that's not right.\n\nHmm, maybe the formula is a_i = B[i] XOR B[i-1], but for i from n down to 1.\n\nWait let's see for the example:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\na_3 = B[3] (since when i =n, maybe a_n = B[n] ? But in the example, B[3] is 1, but a_3 is 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a_i is the XOR of all B[j] from j=i to n.\n\nIn the example:\n\na_1 would be B[1] XOR B[2] XOR B[3] \u21920 XOR2 XOR1 =3, but a_1 is 1. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of the recurrence for the last column.\n\nLet me try to find a recurrence for B[i] in terms of a and previous B's.\n\nLet me consider the last column entries. Let's see for each i from 1 to n:\n\nb_{i,n} = b_{i, n-1} XOR b_{i-1, n}\n\nBut b_{i-1,n} is B[i-1], since that's the entry in row i-1, column n.\n\nBut what is b_{i, n-1}? That's the entry in the previous column. To express this in terms of a and B, perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the last column entries as a sequence and see if there's a way to express a_i in terms of B's.\n\nLet me try to see for the example:\n\nB = [0,2,1]\n\na = [1,2,3]\n\nLooking for a pattern between B and a:\n\na_1 =1, B[1] =0 \u2192 1 = ?\n\na_2 =2, B[2]=2 \u2192 same.\n\na_3 =3, B[3]=1 \u2192 3 is 2+1, but XOR is different.\n\nHmm, perhaps the a array can be derived by reversing the B array and then applying some XOR operations.\n\nWait in the example, the B array is [0,2,1]. Reversed gives [1,2,0]. The a array is [1,2,3].

For each bit position, decide whether to set it in a_i based on the B array.\n\nThe code provided loops over bits (for i in range(19)), and for each bit, checks if the current element has that bit set. The code is incomplete, but perhaps the idea is to compute a_i as the XOR of B[i] and B[i+1], but with some adjustments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute a_i as B[i] XOR B[i+1], but with B[n] =0.\n\nWait let's try this:\n\nIn the example:\n\nB is [0,2,1], n=3.\n\na1 = B[1] XOR B[2] \u21920^2=2 \u2192 no.\n\na2 = B[2]^B[3] \u21922^1=3 \u2192 no.\n\na3 = B[3]^0 \u21921 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is a_i = B[i] XOR B[i-1], with B[0] =0.\n\nIn the example:\n\na1 = B[1] XOR B[0] \u21920^0=0 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nThe matrix b is built such that each cell (i,j) for i,j >=1 is the XOR of the cell to the left and above.\n\nThe last column entries are B[i] = b_{i,n}.\n\nWe need to find a such that when we build the matrix, the last column matches B.\n\nLet me think of the last column entries in terms of a.\n\nLet me consider the last column entries for each row i:\n\nB[i] = b_{i,n} = b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n}\n\nBut b_{i-1,n} is B[i-1].\n\nSo B[i] = (b_{i,n-1}) XOR B[i-1]\n\nNow, what is b_{i,n-1}?\n\nSimilarly, b_{i,n-1} = b_{i,n-2} XOR b_{i-1,n-1}\n\nThis seems to get into a recursive loop. Perhaps there's a pattern when we look at the B array in reverse.\n\nSuppose we process the B array from the end to the beginning.\n\nLet me define a new array C where C[i] = B[i] XOR C[i+1], with C[n] = B[n].\n\nThen, C[i] would be the XOR of B[i], B[i+1], ..., B[n].\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array can be derived by taking the B array and XOR-ing adjacent elements in reverse.\n\nWait let me think of the example:\n\nB array is [0,2,1].\n\nReversed B is [1,2,0].\n\nThe a array is [1,2,3].\n\nHmm, 1 XOR 2 is 3, which is the third element of a. Not sure.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array is the cumulative XOR of the reversed B array.\n\nReversed B is [1,2,0].\n\nCumulative XOR:\n\n1 \u21921 (a1)\n\n1^2 \u21923 (a2)\n\n3^0 \u21923 (a3)\n\nBut the desired a array is [1,2,3]. So a2 is 3 instead of 2. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the B array is the prefix XOR of the a array in reverse.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nSuppose a is [a1, a2, a3].\n\nThen the reversed a is [a3, a2, a1].\n\nThe prefix XOR would be:\n\na3 \u2192 B[3] =1 (matches).\n\na3 XOR a2 \u21923^2=1 \u2192 B[2] is 2 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is a_i = B[i] XOR B[i-1], with B[0] =0.\n\nIn the example:\n\na1 = B[1] XOR B[0] \u21920^0=0 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck.

So the code is outputting the reversed B array. But in the example, the B array is [0,2,1], reversed is [1,2,0], but the correct a is [1,2,3].

The task is to place a bishop on the board such that the sum of all cells attacked by the bishop is maximal. The bishop attacks on diagonally, and the task is to find the maximal sum he can get.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\n\nFor each test case:\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$ \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the chessboard.\nThe following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each \u2014 the number written in the $$$j$$$-th cell of the $$$i$$$-th row.\n\nThe code should compute the maximum sum over all possible placements of the bishop.\n\nNotes: NoteFor the first test case here the best sum is achieved by the bishop being in this position:  \n\nCode:\n\nT = int(input())\n\nfor tc in range(T):\n    (A, B) = map(int, input().split(' '))\n    nums = []\n    for i in range(A):\n        nums.append([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])\n    # TODO: Your code here\n    C = A + B - 1\n    left = [0 for _ in range(C)]\n    right = [0 for _ in range(C)]\n    for a in range(A):\n        for b in range(B):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    # print (left)\n    # print (right)\n    damage = 0\n    for a in range(A):\n        for b in range(B):\n            left_index = a + b\n            right_index = a + B - 1 - b\n            d = left[left_index] + right[right_index] - nums[a][b]\n            damage = max(damage, d)\n\n    print(damage)\n\n# program2.py\nComplete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: My orzlers, we can optimize this problem from $$$O(S^3)$$$ to $$$O\\left(T^\\frac{5}{9}\\right)$$$! \u2014 Spyofgame, founder of Orzlim religionA long time ago, Spyofgame invented the famous array $$$b$$$ ($$$b_{i,n}$$ for the last column of the matrix.
