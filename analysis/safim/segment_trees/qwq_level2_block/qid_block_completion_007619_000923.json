So each stamp application must set the two cells to either RB or BR. Therefore, in the final string, any two adjacent non-W cells must be either RB or BR. In the example given in the fifth test case's explanation, the final string is \"BRBB\". Let's see:\n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B. That would be invalid because they are adjacent and both B. So that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the example. Let me check the note again.",

So perhaps we can process s as s.strip(). So the code steps for each s:\n\ns = s.strip()\n\nThen, find first and last non-W indices. We can loop through the characters to find first and last. Alternatively, first = s.find('R') if 'R' is present, but maybe better to loop. Alternatively:\n\nfirst = -1\n\nlast = -1\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n    if c != 'W':\n\n        if first == -1:\n\n            first = i\n\n        last = i\n\nif first == -1:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\n    continue\n\nThen check that all between first and last are non-W:\n\nfor i in range(first, last+1):\n\n    if s[i] == 'W':\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        break\n\nelse:  # if all are non-W\n\n    # check consecutive pairs\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(first, last):\n\n        a = s[i]\n\n        b = s[i+1]\n\n        if (a, b) not in {('R','B'), ('B','R')}:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        # check length >=2\n\n        if (last - first +1) <2:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\") Wait, but this can be written more concisely. Alternatively, code steps:\n\nfor s in [...]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    first = -1\n\n    last = -1\n\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n        if c != 'W':\n\n            if first == -1:\n\n                first = i\n\n            last = i\n\n    if first == -1:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        continue\n\n    # check contiguous block\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        # check consecutive pairs\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(first, last):\n\n            a, b = s[i], s[i+1]\n\n            if (a, b) not in [('R','B'), ('B','R')]:\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            if (last - first +1) <2:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\") Wait, but the 'else' after the for loop (the contiguous check) only triggers if the loop didn't break. Hmm, but in code, the 'else' clause of a for loop in Python runs if the loop completed normally (without break). So the code structure is:\n\nfor s in [...]:\n\n    s = s.strip() first = ... \n\n    last = ... \n\n    if first == -1:\n\n        print YES and continue\n\n    # check contiguous block\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] is W:\n\n            print NO and break\n\n    else:  # if all non-W in the block\n\n        # check pairs and length\n\n    ... So that's the structure. Now, implementing this in code. But in Python, for code golf, perhaps we can write it more concisely. Alternatively, here's the code for program2.py:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip() first = -1\n    last = -1\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c != 'W':\n            if first == -1: first = i\n            last = i\n    if first == -1:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    # Check contiguous block\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Check consecutive pairs\n    for i in range(first, last):\n        a, b = s[i], s[i+1]\n        if (a, b) not in [('R','B'), ('B','R')]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Check length >=2\n    if (last - first +1) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\") Wait, but in the code above, after checking contiguous block, then check pairs, then length.

Check that every pair of consecutive characters in this block is either RB or BR. \n\n4. Also, the length of the block must be at least 2. If all these are true, then answer is YES, else NO. Wait, but the length of the block can be 1? No, because then it can't be formed. So the steps are:\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # find first and last non-W\n\n    first = -1\n\n    last = -1\n\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n        if c != 'W':\n\n            if first == -1:\n\n                first = i\n\n            last = i\n\n    if first == -1:  # all W\n\n        return True\n\n    # check that all between first and last are non-W\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n\n            return False\n\n    # check consecutive pairs in the block\n\n    for i in range(first, last):\n\n        a = s[i]\n\n        b = s[i+1]\n\n        if (a, b) not in {('R','B'), ('B','R')}:\n\n            return False\n\n    # check that the block length is at least 2\n\n    if (last - first +1) < 2:\n\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\nWait, but the block length is last - first +1. So if first and last are the same (length 1), then it's invalid. So this covers all the conditions. Now, implementing this in Python for program2.py. The code given for program2 is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is reading from standard input.",

So the final string is R B B. \n\nThe second and third characters are B and B. This is invalid according to my previous logic, but the note says it's valid. Hmm, this suggests that my logic is wrong. Perhaps the problem allows for two B's in a row if they were set by different stamps. Wait, for example, the third character was set by a previous stamp (position 2-3 as RB \u2192 third is B).",

So the final string can have any combination of R and B, as long as every non-W cell is part of at least one stamped pair. The key is that the entire non-W region must be covered by at least one stamped pair. But how to model this. Perhaps the only constraints are:\n\n- The non-W region must be contiguous. - The length of the non-W region must be at least 1. Wait, but length 1 is impossible. So the constraints are:\n\n- The non-W region is contiguous. - The length is at least 2. \n\n- All non-W are in a contiguous block. That's it. Because any contiguous block of length \u22652 can be formed by applying stamps in some way. For example, the RBB case: \n\nThe contiguous block is R B B. \n\nLength is 3. To form this: \n\nFirst apply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nThen apply stamp to positions 2-3 as BB? No, can't. Wait, the second stamp must be applied to positions 2-3 as either RB or BR. If we apply stamp to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 then positions 2 and 3 become B and R \u2192 resulting in R B R. \n\nNot desired.",

Because any contiguous block of length \u22652 can be formed by applying stamps in some way. For example, the RBB case can be formed as above. The consecutive pairs in the final string don't have to be RB or BR. The stamps can be applied in such a way that overlapping pairs allow for any sequence. Thus, the correct conditions are:\n\nThe string is valid if:\n\n- All non-W characters form a contiguous block. - The length of this block is at least 2. \n\n- Or the string is all W. \n\nThus, the code should check these conditions. So the code for program2 is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip() first = -1\n    last = -1\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c != 'W':\n            if first == -1: first = i\n            last = i\n    if first == -1:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    # Check contiguous block\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Check length >=2\n    if (last - first +1) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\") This is much simpler. Testing the example RBB:\n\nfirst is 0, last is 2. The block from 0-2 is R B B \u2192 all non-W. \n\nLength is 3 \u22652 \u2192 YES. Which matches the note's example.",

Wait, but in the example given in the fifth test case, the final string is \"BRBB\", which has two B's adjacent. That would violate this condition. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. Alternatively, maybe the example's final string is \"BRBB\" but the fourth character is a W? Or perhaps the example's explanation is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for W's in the middle of non-W regions, but that can't be.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first since it seems simpler.\n\nFor program1, the task is to determine if a ticket is lucky. The ticket is a 6-digit string, and we need to check if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three. The input has multiple test cases. \n\nSo the code structure is given as a loop over the test cases. The TODO is in the loop body. The steps I need to do here are: for each test case string, split into first three and last three digits, sum each part, compare, then output YES or NO.\n\nWait, the input for each test case is a string of six digits. So for each string s, take the first three characters, convert each to integers, sum them. Do the same for the last three. If the sums are equal, output YES else NO.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\nsum1 = sum(int(d) for d in s[:3])\nsum2 = sum(int(d) for d in s[3:])\nprint(\"YES\" if sum1 == sum2 else \"NO\")\n\nThat's straightforward. So the missing part in program1 is replacing the TODO with that code. So the complete loop would be:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    s = input().strip()\n    sum1 = sum(int(d) for d in s[:3])\n    sum2 = sum(int(d) for d in s[3:])\n    print(\"YES\" if sum1 == sum2 else \"NO\")\n\nOkay, that's program1 done. Now onto program2.py, which is more complex.\n\nThe problem for program2 is about determining if a given string of R, B, W can be formed by stamping pairs of adjacent cells, where each stamp changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects two cells. The question is whether the given final string can be achieved through any number of such operations, starting from all W.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model the possible transitions. Let me think of the constraints here. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. Each time you apply the stamp, those two cells become either RB or BR. But since you can apply the stamp multiple times, each time flipping their colors (since applying the same stamp again would toggle them again?), wait no. Wait, each application of the stamp changes both cells to either BR or RB. Wait, the problem says \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" So each time you use the stamp on a pair, those two cells are set to either BR or RB, regardless of their previous state. So the order of application matters, but each application overwrites those two cells.\n\nWait, the stamp can be rotated, so each time you choose a pair of adjacent cells, and choose to set them to either BR or RB. So each application of the stamp on a pair can set those two to either of those two options. \n\nThe initial state is all W. The final state is given. We need to see if there's a sequence of such operations that leads to the given string.\n\nHmm, how can we model this? Let's think of the constraints that the final string must satisfy for it to be possible.\n\nFirst, note that any W in the final string must be part of a position that was never stamped over. Because whenever a cell is part of a stamped pair, it's set to either R or B. So if a cell is W, it must not have been part of any stamp application. \n\nWait, but if a cell is W, that means it was never part of any stamp's pair. Because every time a stamp is applied to a pair, those two cells are set to either R or B. So if a cell is W, it must not have been in any stamped pair. \n\nTherefore, all the W's in the final string must be isolated in such a way that they are not adjacent to any non-W cells? Or perhaps more precisely, any W must not be adjacent to any non-W cells, because otherwise, that adjacent pair would have been part of a stamp, which would have set those cells to R or B, thus making them non-W. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose there is a W at position i. For it to remain W, it must never have been part of any stamp's pair. So the cells to the left and right of it can't have been part of a stamp that includes this cell. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a W imposes that its neighboring cells must also be W? Because otherwise, if there's a non-W adjacent to a W, then that pair must have been stamped, but then the W would have been changed. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose the final string has \"WRB\". The first cell is W. The second is R. The third is B. \n\nThe first cell is W, so it was never part of any stamp. The second and third cells are R and B. That could be from a stamp applied to positions 2-3 as RB. But then position 1 is W, which is okay. However, the first and second cells are W and R. Since the first was never part of any stamp, but the second was part of a stamp (as part of 2-3). But the first cell is W, so it was never part of any stamp. So the second cell's R comes from being part of a stamp. \n\nWait, but the first and second cells are adjacent. Since the first was never part of any stamp, the second could have been part of a stamp with the third. So that's okay. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key constraints are:\n\n1. Any occurrence of a non-W must be part of a pair that was stamped. But since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the non-W cells must form pairs or sequences that can be built up via overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the non-W cells must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive non-W cells can be part of some stamp application. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the non-W cells. Let me consider the entire string. Let's process the string and see the positions of non-W characters. \n\nSuppose the string has some W's and some R/B's. Let's look at the non-W regions. Each non-W must be part of at least one stamp. But each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So the non-W regions must form a sequence where every pair of adjacent non-W cells can be covered by some stamp. Wait, perhaps the non-W regions must form a sequence where between any two non-W cells, there are no W's. Because if there is a W between two non-W cells, then those two non-W cells are separated by a W, which can't be part of any stamp (since the W was never stamped). So that would be impossible. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose the string is \"RWB\". The middle is W. The first and third are R and B. The middle is W, so it was never part of any stamp. The first R must have been part of a stamp with the second cell (but the second is W, which can't be). Or the third B must have been part of a stamp with the second (W again). So that's impossible. So such a string would be impossible. \n\nTherefore, any non-W cell must be adjacent to another non-W cell, except possibly at the ends. Wait, perhaps the non-W regions must form a continuous block where every pair of adjacent non-W cells are connected through overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, the non-W regions must form a sequence where every non-W cell is part of at least one pair (either with the previous or next cell) that was stamped. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W part must form a sequence where the colors alternate between R and B in some way. Because each stamp application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W cells must be either RB or BR. \n\nWait, that's an important point. Let me think: each stamp application on positions i and i+1 sets them to either RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W cells must be either RB or BR. Because if they were part of a stamp, they must be in one of those two pairs. However, if they were part of multiple stamps, their final state could be a combination. Wait, but each stamp overwrites the previous values. So the final state of two adjacent cells must be either RB, BR, or WW (if they were never stamped). But since they are non-W, they can't be WW. So any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence of non-W cells must form a chain where each adjacent pair is either RB or BR. \n\nAdditionally, any W must not be adjacent to a non-W cell, because otherwise, that would require the W to be part of a stamp (since the adjacent non-W cell must be part of a stamp with its neighbor). Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose there is a W followed by an R. The R must be part of a stamp with its previous or next cell. The previous cell is W, which can't be part of any stamp (since it's W). So the R must be part of a stamp with the next cell. But then the next cell must be B or R? Wait, the stamp on R and next cell would set them to either RB or BR. So if the next cell is B, that's okay. But if the next cell is W, then that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of a W next to a non-W cell would make it impossible. Because the non-W cell must be part of a stamp with its other neighbor, but the W can't be part of any stamp. \n\nWait, let's formalize the constraints:\n\nThe final string must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single continuous block. Because if there are two separate non-W regions separated by a W, then those regions can't be connected via stamps. \n\nWait, not necessarily. Suppose the string is \"RWBWBR\". The first R is part of a non-W block, then a W, then another non-W block. The two non-W blocks are separated by a W. But that would be impossible because the first R's adjacent cell (the W) can't be part of any stamp, so the R must be part of a stamp with the previous cell (which is nothing, since it's the first character). So that's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the non-W regions must form a single continuous block. \n\n2. Within the non-W block, every pair of adjacent characters must be either RB or BR. Because each pair must have been set by a stamp. \n\nWait, but the entire non-W block can be formed by overlapping stamps. For example, a sequence like RBRB could be formed by overlapping stamps. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the initial is WWWW. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W W. \n\nThen stamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B R B. \n\nThen the sequence R B R B would have adjacent pairs RB, BR, RB. Each adjacent pair is allowed. \n\nSo the entire non-W block must form a sequence where every two adjacent characters are either RB or BR. \n\nAdditionally, the entire non-W block must be such that it can be formed by some sequence of stamps. \n\nWait, but how do we check that? \n\nAnother thought: the entire non-W sequence must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp adds either RB or BR. So the sequence must be an alternating R and B, but can start with either. \n\nWait, for example, RBRB is okay. BRBR is okay. But RRRB would have adjacent RR which is invalid. \n\nSo the entire non-W sequence must be a string where every two adjacent characters are either RB or BR. \n\nAdditionally, the entire non-W block must be such that it can be formed by some combination of stamps. \n\nWait, but even that might not be sufficient. Let's see some examples. \n\nTake the example from the note: the fifth test case's example is \"BRBW\" (or similar?), but the example given in the problem's note for the fifth case is \"B R B B\" (but I need to check the note again). \n\nWait the fifth test case's example is \"WWW \u2192 WRB \u2192 BRB B\". Wait the example given in the note for the fifth test case is the input \"BRBB\". Let me see:\n\nThe example says the fifth test case can be formed by stamping steps leading to BRBB. Let's see the final string is \"BRBB\". \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe first two characters are BR (from a stamp), then the next two are BB. Wait, the third and fourth are B and B. But adjacent BB would not be allowed, since they must be either RB or BR. \n\nHmm, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, in the example given in the note for the fifth test case:\n\nThe example says the fifth test case's steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 BRB B. \n\nWait the final string is \"BRBB\". Let's see the third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nWait that's a problem because adjacent B and B would not be allowed. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement for program2.\n\nThe problem says that each stamp can be applied to any two neighboring cells, and when you do so, one becomes red and the other blue. So each stamp application must set the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nTherefore, in the final string, any two adjacent non-W cells must be either RB or BR. \n\nIn the example given in the fifth test case's explanation, the final string is \"BRBB\". Let's see:\n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B. That would be invalid because they are adjacent and both B. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the example. Let me check the note again. \n\nThe fifth test case's example says:\n\n\"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 BRB B\". \n\nWait the final string is \"BRBB\"? Let me parse the steps:\n\nFirst step: the stamp is applied to positions 2-3 (assuming 1-based?), resulting in W followed by RB. So the string is W R B. \n\nSecond step: applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR. So the first two become B R, so the string becomes B R B. The third character is still B. So the final string is BRBB? Wait that would be B R B B. The third and fourth are B and B. \n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps the example's final string is \"BRBB\" but that would have two B's adjacent, which is invalid. \n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me re-read the note's fifth test case explanation:\n\n\"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 BRB B\". \n\nWait the third step's result is \"BRB B\". So the fourth character is B. So the third and fourth are B and B. \n\nHmm, that suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. So there must be something wrong with my assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping stamps that can overwrite previous settings. \n\nWait, in the example, the third step is applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR, so the first two become B and R. The third character was R from the first step, but after the second step, when applying the stamp to positions 1-2, the third character remains as B. \n\nWait the first step: positions 2-3 are set to RB. So the string is W R B. \n\nSecond step: applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR. So positions 1 and 2 become B and R. So the string becomes B R B. The third character is still B. So the final string is B R B (length 3?), but the example's input was n=4? \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is \"BRBB\" but the fourth character is W? Or maybe I'm miscounting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for some W's in the non-W regions. Wait no, because any stamped cell must be set to R or B. \n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Let me think differently. \n\nThe key idea is that every non-W cell must be part of at least one stamp. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So the entire non-W region must form a sequence where every pair of adjacent non-W cells can be part of some stamp. \n\nWait, but each stamp can be applied anywhere, even overlapping. So perhaps the non-W regions can have any pattern as long as the following holds: \n\n- Any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. \n\nBecause each such pair must have been set by a stamp (either directly or through overlapping). \n\nWait, but in the example given in the fifth test case, the final string is \"BRBB\", which has two B's adjacent. That would violate this condition. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's final string is \"BRBB\" but the fourth character is a W? Or perhaps the example's explanation is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for W's in the middle of non-W regions, but that can't be. Because if a W is between two non-W's, then those non-W's must be part of a stamp that includes the W, but that would set the W to R or B. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think of the constraints again. \n\nLet me consider the following: \n\nThe final string must satisfy that any two adjacent cells are either:\n\n- Both W: allowed, since they were never stamped. \n\n- One is W and the other is non-W: this is impossible, because the non-W must have been part of a stamp with its other neighbor (since it can't be with the W). \n\nWait, for example, if there is a W followed by an R, then the R must be part of a stamp with its next cell. But the next cell could be B. So the R and B form a valid pair. But the W and R are adjacent, but the R is part of a stamp with the next cell. The W is not part of any stamp. \n\nWait, but the R is part of a stamp with the next cell. So the R and B are okay. The W and R being adjacent is allowed, as long as the R is part of a stamp with the next cell. \n\nWait, but the W and R are adjacent, but the W is not part of any stamp. So the R must be part of a stamp with its next cell. \n\nSo the presence of a W next to a non-W is allowed, as long as the non-W is part of a stamp with its other neighbor. \n\nWait, but then the non-W cell (R) is adjacent to a W. The R must have been part of a stamp with its other neighbor (the next cell). \n\nSo the R and next cell (say B) form a valid pair. \n\nSo the W and R can be adjacent. \n\nHmm, so the first constraint is not that non-W regions must be contiguous. \n\nWait, but then the problem's second test case (from the note) is when n=1, the input is \"W\", which is allowed (since you can do zero stamps). \n\nAnother example: the string \"WRB\" would be allowed. The first W is okay, the R and B form a valid pair. \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n1. For any two adjacent non-W cells, they must form either RB or BR. \n\n2. Any non-W cell must be part of at least one pair (i.e., there must be a way to cover all non-W cells with overlapping or adjacent stamps). \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that all non-W cells are covered by some stamp? \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence of non-W cells must form a path where each step is either RB or BR. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire non-W sequence must be a string where every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. \n\nSo for example, \"RBRB\" is okay. \"BRBR\" is okay. \"RB\" is okay. \"BR\" is okay. \n\nBut \"RR\" is invalid, \"BB\" is invalid, \"RW\" is allowed (since the W is separate). \n\nWait, but the \"RW\" case: the R must be part of a stamp with its next cell. But the next cell is W, which can't be part of a stamp. So that's impossible. \n\nAh, right. So in the case of \"RW\", the R is at the end. To have R there, it must have been part of a stamp with the previous cell. But the previous cell is W, which can't be part of a stamp. \n\nWait, the R is the first character. So it must have been part of a stamp with the second cell. But the second cell is W, which would require that the stamp was applied to positions 1-2, setting them to either RB or BR. But then the second cell would be B or R, not W. \n\nTherefore, the \"RW\" string is impossible. \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n- All non-W cells must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W cells are either RB or BR. \n\n- Additionally, the entire non-W sequence must form a path that can be covered by some stamps. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? \n\nPerhaps the non-W sequence must be such that it can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, the entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be represented as a series of overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire non-W sequence must be a string where every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. \n\nBecause each stamp application can only set two adjacent cells to RB or BR, so any two adjacent non-W cells must be in one of those two pairs. \n\nTherefore, the entire non-W sequence must be a string where every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. \n\nAdditionally, the non-W sequence can be of any length (as long as it's at least 1?), but must satisfy that. \n\nWait, but what about a single non-W character? \n\nSuppose the string is \"R\" (n=1). Then the single R must have been set by a stamp, but a stamp requires two adjacent cells. Since n=1, you can't apply any stamp. So the only possible string is all W. So \"R\" would be impossible. \n\nAh right. So for a single non-W character, it's impossible. \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n1. All non-W characters must form a sequence where every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. \n\n2. The number of non-W characters must be even? Or not necessarily? \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the non-W sequence is of length 3: RBR. \n\nThe first two are RB, the next two are BR. So that's okay. The total length is 3, which is odd. \n\nWait, but how can that be formed? \n\nLet me see: \n\nStart with WWW. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nThen stamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B R. \n\nSo the final string is RBR (length 3). \n\nYes, that works. So the length can be odd. \n\nSo the length doesn't have to be even. \n\nSo the key constraints are:\n\n- All non-W characters must form a sequence where every two consecutive are RB or BR. \n\n- The entire non-W sequence must be possible to form via some stamps. \n\nWait, but how do we check that? \n\nWait, the first condition is necessary and sufficient? \n\nBecause if the non-W sequence meets the first condition, then it can be formed by applying stamps in a way that builds up the sequence. \n\nFor example, the sequence RBR can be built as above. \n\nAnother example: BRB. \n\nFirst apply stamp to positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W. \n\nThen apply stamp to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R B. \n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother example: RBRB (length 4). \n\nYes, possible. \n\nWhat about a single non-W character? \n\nLike \"R\" in a string of length 1. \n\nThen the non-W sequence is length 1. The first condition is vacuously true (no consecutive pairs), but since it's a single character, it can't be formed by any stamp (since stamps require two cells). So the answer is \"NO\". \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n- All non-W characters must form a sequence where every two consecutive are RB or BR. \n\n- The number of non-W characters must be at least 2? No, because in the case of zero non-W (all W), it's allowed. \n\nWait, the problem allows using zero stamps, so all W is allowed. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nEither:\n\n- The entire string is all W \u2192 \"YES\".\n\nOR\n\n- The non-W characters form a contiguous block (not necessarily, but their positions must form a sequence where between any two non-W characters, there are no W's? Or not?)\n\nWait, no. Because suppose the string is \"RWB\". The R and B are separated by a W. So the non-W are R and B, but they are not adjacent. So their consecutive pairs are not present, so the first condition is satisfied (since there are no consecutive non-W pairs). But the R and B are separated by a W. \n\nBut how can that happen? \n\nThe R must have been part of a stamp with its previous or next cell. The next cell is W, so can't be part of a stamp. The previous cell is nothing (since it's the first character). So the R can't exist. \n\nTherefore, the non-W characters must form a contiguous block. Because if there are two non-W characters separated by a W, then one of them can't be part of any stamp. \n\nWait, let's see the example \"RWB\". \n\nThe R is at position 1. To have R there, it must have been part of a stamp with position 2. But position 2 is W, which can't be part of a stamp. So that's impossible. \n\nTherefore, the non-W characters must form a contiguous block. \n\nSo the second condition is that all non-W characters form a contiguous block. \n\nSo combining all conditions:\n\nThe string is valid if:\n\nEither:\n\n1. All characters are W \u2192 \"YES\".\n\nOR\n\n2. The non-W characters form a contiguous block, and within this block, every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. \n\nAdditionally, the length of the non-W block must be at least 1, but since the stamps can be applied multiple times, even a single non-W is impossible (unless the block has length 1, which can't be formed). \n\nWait, the non-W block must have at least two characters? \n\nWait, if the non-W block has length 1, then that single character must have been set by a stamp. But a stamp requires two adjacent cells. So for a single non-W character, it's impossible. \n\nTherefore, the non-W block must have length \u2265 2. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W characters form a contiguous block. \n\n- The length of this block is \u2265 2. \n\n- Within the block, every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. \n\nAdditionally, the entire string can have W's outside this block. \n\nWait, but the block must be contiguous. So all non-W must be in one block. \n\nSo putting it all together, the steps to check for a given string s are:\n\n1. Find the first and last indices where the character is not W. \n\n   - If there are none (all W), then answer is YES. \n\n   - Else, the non-W block is from first to last. \n\n2. Check that all characters between first and last (inclusive) are non-W. \n\n   (i.e., the non-W form a contiguous block). \n\n3. Check that every pair of consecutive characters in this block is either RB or BR. \n\n4. Also, the length of the block must be at least 2. \n\nIf all these are true, then answer is YES, else NO. \n\nWait, but the length of the block can be 1? No, because then it can't be formed. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # find first and last non-W\n\n    first = -1\n\n    last = -1\n\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n        if c != 'W':\n\n            if first == -1:\n\n                first = i\n\n            last = i\n\n    if first == -1:  # all W\n\n        return True\n\n    # check that all between first and last are non-W\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n\n            return False\n\n    # check consecutive pairs in the block\n\n    for i in range(first, last):\n\n        a = s[i]\n\n        b = s[i+1]\n\n        if (a, b) not in {('R','B'), ('B','R')}:\n\n            return False\n\n    # check that the block length is at least 2\n\n    if (last - first +1) < 2:\n\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\nWait, but the block length is last - first +1. So if first and last are the same (length 1), then it's invalid. \n\nSo this covers all the conditions. \n\nNow, implementing this in Python for program2.py. \n\nThe code given for program2 is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is reading from standard input. The input format is that each test case has two lines: first n, then s. \n\nWait the code for program2 is written as:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\nThis is probably trying to read all lines from stdin, then take every second line starting from index 2. Because the first line is t, then for each test case, the lines are n, s, n, s, etc. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe input for each test case is:\n\nt\n\nn1\n\ns1\n\nn2\n\ns2\n\n...\n\nso the lines are [t, n1, s1, n2, s2, ...]\n\nThus, the test case strings are at positions 1,3,5,... (if 0-based). \n\nWait the code is using [2::2], which would start at index 2, then step by 2. So for example, if the lines are [0,1,2,3,4,5], then [2::2] would be lines 2,4,6. \n\nWait the first line is t. Then the first test case's n is line 1, s is line 2. The second test case's n is line3, s is line4. \n\nThus, the s strings are at lines 2,4,6 etc. So the code is correct in taking [2::2]. \n\nSo the code is iterating over the s strings. \n\nNow, for each s, we need to process it and output YES or NO. \n\nSo the code needs to process each s as per the conditions above. \n\nImplementing the function in code. \n\nFirst, for each s:\n\ns is the string (without leading/trailing whitespace? Probably, since input is read via open(0), which may include newlines. But in the code, the for loop is for s in [...] which would split each line, so each s is the line's content, including any trailing newlines. So perhaps we should process s.strip().\n\nWait, the problem says that the input strings are given as the second line of each test case, and it's guaranteed that the length is n and only contains W, R, B. So perhaps we can process s as s.strip().\n\nSo the code steps for each s:\n\ns = s.strip()\n\nThen, find first and last non-W indices. \n\nWe can loop through the characters to find first and last. \n\nAlternatively, first = s.find('R') if 'R' is present, but maybe better to loop. \n\nAlternatively:\n\nfirst = -1\n\nlast = -1\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n    if c != 'W':\n\n        if first == -1:\n\n            first = i\n\n        last = i\n\nif first == -1:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\n    continue\n\nThen check that all between first and last are non-W:\n\nfor i in range(first, last+1):\n\n    if s[i] == 'W':\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        break\n\nelse:  # if all are non-W\n\n    # check consecutive pairs\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(first, last):\n\n        a = s[i]\n\n        b = s[i+1]\n\n        if (a, b) not in {('R','B'), ('B','R')}:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        # check length >=2\n\n        if (last - first +1) <2:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but this can be written more concisely. \n\nAlternatively, code steps:\n\nfor s in [...]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    first = -1\n\n    last = -1\n\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n\n        if c != 'W':\n\n            if first == -1:\n\n                first = i\n\n            last = i\n\n    if first == -1:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        continue\n\n    # check contiguous block\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        # check consecutive pairs\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(first, last):\n\n            a, b = s[i], s[i+1]\n\n            if (a, b) not in [('R','B'), ('B','R')]:\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            if (last - first +1) <2:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the 'else' after the for loop (the contiguous check) only triggers if the loop didn't break. \n\nHmm, but in code, the 'else' clause of a for loop in Python runs if the loop completed normally (without break). \n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nfor s in [...]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    first = ... \n\n    last = ... \n\n    if first == -1:\n\n        print YES and continue\n\n    # check contiguous block\n\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n\n        if s[i] is W:\n\n            print NO and break\n\n    else:  # if all non-W in the block\n\n        # check pairs and length\n\n    ... \n\nSo that's the structure. \n\nNow, implementing this in code. \n\nBut in Python, for code golf, perhaps we can write it more concisely. \n\nAlternatively, here's the code for program2.py:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    first = -1\n    last = -1\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c != 'W':\n            if first == -1:\n                first = i\n            last = i\n    if first == -1:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    # Check contiguous block\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Check consecutive pairs\n    for i in range(first, last):\n        a, b = s[i], s[i+1]\n        if (a, b) not in [('R','B'), ('B','R')]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Check length >=2\n    if (last - first +1) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but in the code above, after checking contiguous block, then check pairs, then length. \n\nThis should work. \n\nTesting some cases:\n\nTest case 1 from the note (the example given in the problem's fifth test case):\n\nThe fifth test case's final string is \"BRBB\" (assuming the example's final string is \"BRBB\"). \n\nWait let's see:\n\ns = \"BRBB\"\n\nfirst is 0 (B), last is 3 (B). \n\nCheck contiguous block: all from 0-3 are B, R, B, B? \n\nWait the string is B R B B. \n\nWait the first is 0, last is 3. \n\nCheck each position 0-3:\n\ns[0] = B (non-W), s[1] R, s[2] B, s[3] B. All non-W. \n\nThen check consecutive pairs:\n\n0-1: B and R \u2192 BR \u2192 allowed. \n\n1-2: R and B \u2192 RB \u2192 allowed. \n\n2-3: B and B \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the consecutive pairs check would fail here. \n\nBut according to the note's example, it's possible. \n\nHmm, this suggests a problem with my logic. \n\nWait the example's fifth test case's final string must be something else. Let me recheck the note's description:\n\n\"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 BRB B\". \n\nWait the steps are:\n\nInitial: WWW (length 3?)\n\nFirst step: stamp positions 2-3 \u2192 W R B (length 3). \n\nSecond step: stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R B (length 3). \n\nThe final string is \"BRB\", which is length 3. \n\nSo the final string is \"BRB\". \n\nIn that case, the code would process it as:\n\nfirst =0, last=2. \n\nCheck contiguous block: all non-W. \n\nCheck pairs:\n\n0-1: B R \u2192 BR (okay). \n\n1-2: R B \u2192 RB (okay). \n\nLength is 3 \u22652 \u2192 valid \u2192 YES. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo the example is okay. \n\nAnother test case: the sixth test case's example in the note:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 WRB \u2192 RBB\". \n\nWait the final string is \"RBB\". \n\nFirst is 0, last is 2. \n\nCheck contiguous block: all non-W. \n\nCheck pairs:\n\n0-1: R B \u2192 RB (okay). \n\n1-2: B B \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the code would output NO, but according to the note, it's possible. \n\nWait the note says the sixth test case's example is possible. \n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 RBB\". \n\nWait the steps:\n\nFirst step: stamp positions 2-3 (assuming n=3?), resulting in W R B. \n\nSecond step: stamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B B? \n\nWait no. \n\nWait the second step's stamp is applied to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B. \n\nThe third character is B. \n\nSo the final string is R B B. \n\nThe pairs are R-B (okay), B-B (invalid). \n\nHmm, this suggests that my logic is wrong. \n\nWait what's the sixth test case's final string? \n\nThe note says the sixth test case's example is \"RBB\" and it's possible. \n\nBut according to my code, it would output NO. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nHmm, so there's a mistake in my reasoning. \n\nWait let's think again. \n\nThe sixth test case's example:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 RBB. \n\nWait the second step's stamp is applied to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B. \n\nThe third character was B from the first step. \n\nSo the final string is R B B. \n\nThe pairs are R-B (okay), B-B (invalid). \n\nBut according to the note, this is possible. \n\nSo my logic must be wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here? \n\nAh! Wait, the second step's stamp is applied to positions 1-2 as RB. So the first two become R and B. The third character is B. \n\nThe third character is B, which was set in the first step (position 2-3 as RB \u2192 third character is B). \n\nThen in the second step, the third character is not part of the stamp, so it remains B. \n\nSo the final string is R B B. \n\nThe consecutive pairs are R-B (okay), B-B (invalid). \n\nBut according to the note, this is a valid case. \n\nSo my logic is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my previous assumptions are incorrect. \n\nThis means I need to rethink the problem. \n\nWhat's the correct condition here? \n\nIn the example RBB, the final string is R B B. \n\nThe first two characters are R and B (valid). The second and third are B and B (invalid). \n\nBut according to the note, this is possible. \n\nSo my previous constraints are wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct approach here? \n\nLet me think of the example RBB. \n\nHow can this be formed? \n\nThe steps given in the note are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 RBB. \n\nWait the second step's stamp is applied to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B. \n\nThe third character was B from the first step. \n\nSo the final string is R B B. \n\nThe third character is B. \n\nThe second and third are B and B. \n\nBut how is this allowed? \n\nAh! Because the third character was set in the first step (as part of the stamp on positions 2-3). \n\nThe second character is B (from first step's stamp on 2-3, then overwritten by the second step's stamp on 1-2). \n\nWait the second step's stamp on 1-2 sets position 2 to B (from the first step's R?), or wait:\n\nFirst step: positions 2-3 are set to RB \u2192 so position 2 is R, position 3 is B. \n\nThe string after first step is W R B. \n\nSecond step: stamp on positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B. \n\nSo the new string is R B B. \n\nThe second and third characters are B and B. \n\nBut how did that happen? \n\nThe third character was set in the first step to B, and wasn't changed in the second step. \n\nSo the second and third characters are B and B. \n\nBut according to the problem's rules, this is allowed? \n\nWait the problem says that each stamp application must set the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe third character is B, but it was set in the first step (as part of a stamp with position 2). \n\nThe second character is B (from the second step's stamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 position 2 is B). \n\nSo the second and third characters are B and B. \n\nBut according to the problem's rules, this is invalid because they are adjacent and not RB or BR. \n\nBut the note says this is a valid case. \n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nHmm, so there must be a different approach. \n\nAlternative idea: the problem allows overlapping stamps, so the final string can have any sequence of R and B as long as every R or B is part of at least one pair that was stamped. \n\nWait, but how to model this. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire sequence of non-W characters must form a string where every R and B can be covered by some overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nWait, for example, RBB can be partitioned as RB and BB? No. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence RBB can be formed by the following stamps:\n\nFirst stamp on positions 2-3 as BB? No, because each stamp must set to RB or BR. \n\nWait, the third character is B. To have two B's adjacent, there must be a stamp that set them to BR or RB. \n\nWait, the two B's can't be set by a single stamp. \n\nSo the example in the note must have a different explanation. \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in reading the note's example. Let me recheck the note's sixth test case:\n\n\"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 RBB\". \n\nWait the final string is \"RBB\". \n\nWait the second step's stamp is applied to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B. \n\nThe third character was B from the first step. \n\nSo the final string is R B B. \n\nThe second and third characters are B and B. \n\nThis is invalid according to my previous logic, but the note says it's valid. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my logic is wrong. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows for two B's in a row if they were set by different stamps. \n\nWait, for example, the third character was set by a previous stamp (position 2-3 as RB \u2192 third is B). \n\nThe second character was set by the second stamp (position 1-2 as RB \u2192 second is B). \n\nSo the second and third are both B. \n\nBut how is that allowed? \n\nThe problem's description says that each stamp application must set the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nSo the second and third cells were set by different stamps. \n\nThe second cell was set to B in the second stamp (position 1-2 as RB \u2192 position 2 is B). \n\nThe third cell was set to B in the first stamp (position 2-3 as RB \u2192 position 3 is B). \n\nThus, the second and third cells are both B. \n\nBut this is not allowed because they are adjacent and not RB or BR. \n\nSo the example must be incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for two B's if they were set by different stamps, but the final adjacent pair is not required to be RB or BR. \n\nWait, the problem's description says that each stamp application must set the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nBut the final string is the result of multiple such operations. \n\nThe final string's adjacent pairs don't have to be RB or BR, because each pair could have been set by different stamps. \n\nAh! This is the key mistake in my previous reasoning. \n\nThe final string's adjacent pairs don't have to be RB or BR. \n\nThe stamps can be applied in such a way that overlapping stamps can create other combinations. \n\nFor example, applying a stamp to positions 1-2 as RB, then applying a stamp to positions 2-3 as BR. \n\nThe first two are R B, then the second and third become B R. \n\nThe final string is R B R. \n\nThe first and second are RB, second and third are BR. \n\nThis is allowed. \n\nBut if you have two B's in a row, like in the example RBB, how is that possible? \n\nIn the example given in the note's sixth test case, the final string is RBB. \n\nThe first and second are RB (from the second stamp), and the second and third are BB. \n\nThe second and third were set by the first stamp (positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 third is B), and the second was set by the second stamp to B. \n\nThus, the second and third are B and B. \n\nThis is not allowed by the problem's rules, but the note says it is possible. \n\nThis suggests that my understanding of the problem is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows for the final string to have any combination of R and B, as long as every non-W cell is part of at least one stamped pair. \n\nThe key is that each non-W cell must be part of at least one stamped pair. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nEach non-W cell must be part of at least one pair of adjacent cells that were stamped. \n\nBut the stamped pairs can overlap. \n\nThe final string can have any sequence of R and B, as long as every non-W cell is covered by at least one stamped pair. \n\nBut how to check this. \n\nThe problem is that the stamped pairs can be applied in any order, and each application overwrites the cells. \n\nThe final string is the result of all the stamps applied. \n\nThe key is that for every non-W cell, there must be at least one stamp that includes it. \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nAlternatively, the entire non-W region must be such that every cell except possibly the first and last can be part of a pair with their previous or next cell. \n\nWait, but this is vague. \n\nAnother idea: the non-W region must be such that it can be covered by a sequence of overlapping pairs. \n\nFor example, the non-W region can be of any length \u22651, but the first and last characters can be anything, and the others must form pairs with their neighbors. \n\nWait, but this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the non-W region can be any sequence of R and B, as long as it can be formed by some sequence of stamps. \n\nThe only constraints are:\n\n- The non-W region must be contiguous. \n\n- The length of the non-W region can be any \u22651. \n\nWait, but how can a single non-W character be formed? \n\nIt can't, because a stamp requires two cells. \n\nSo the non-W region must have length \u22652. \n\nBut the example in the note's sixth test case has length 3 (RBB), which is okay. \n\nBut the adjacent B and B are allowed? \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem allows any sequence of R and B as long as the non-W region is contiguous and has length \u22652. \n\nBut then the example RBB would be allowed. \n\nBut according to the problem's rules, the two B's are adjacent and not RB or BR. \n\nBut the problem's description says that each stamp must set the two cells to either RB or BR. \n\nSo the final string can have any sequence of R and B, but the way they are formed must be through overlapping stamps. \n\nThe final string's adjacent pairs don't have to be RB or BR. \n\nAh! This is the mistake. \n\nThe final string's adjacent pairs don't have to be RB or BR. \n\nEach stamp application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR, but subsequent stamps can overwrite them. \n\nSo the final string can have any combination of R and B, as long as every non-W cell is part of at least one stamped pair. \n\nThe key is that the entire non-W region must be covered by at least one stamped pair. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nPerhaps the only constraints are:\n\n- The non-W region must be contiguous. \n\n- The length of the non-W region must be at least 1. \n\nWait, but length 1 is impossible. \n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n- The non-W region is contiguous. \n\n- The length is at least 2. \n\n- All non-W are in a contiguous block. \n\nThat's it. \n\nBecause any contiguous block of length \u22652 can be formed by applying stamps in some way. \n\nFor example, the RBB case: \n\nThe contiguous block is R B B. \n\nLength is 3. \n\nTo form this: \n\nFirst apply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W. \n\nThen apply stamp to positions 2-3 as BB? No, can't. \n\nWait, the second stamp must be applied to positions 2-3 as either RB or BR. \n\nIf we apply stamp to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 then positions 2 and 3 become B and R \u2192 resulting in R B R. \n\nNot desired. \n\nAlternatively, first apply stamp to positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 W R B. \n\nThen apply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B B. \n\nYes! \n\nThe first stamp on 2-3 gives W R B. \n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 positions 1 and 2 become R and B. \n\nThe third character remains B. \n\nThe final string is R B B. \n\nThe second and third are B and B. \n\nBut how did that happen? \n\nThe second character was set to B by the second stamp (position 1-2 as RB \u2192 position 2 is B). \n\nThe third character was set to B by the first stamp (position 2-3 as RB \u2192 position 3 is B). \n\nThus, the two B's are allowed because they were set by different stamps. \n\nThe final string's adjacent pairs don't have to be RB or BR. \n\nAh! So my previous assumption that the consecutive pairs must be RB or BR is incorrect. \n\nThe only constraints are:\n\n- The non-W region must be contiguous. \n\n- The length must be at least 2. \n\nThat's it. \n\nBecause any contiguous block of length \u22652 can be formed by applying stamps in some way. \n\nFor example, the RBB case can be formed as above. \n\nThe consecutive pairs in the final string don't have to be RB or BR. \n\nThe stamps can be applied in such a way that overlapping pairs allow for any sequence. \n\nThus, the correct conditions are:\n\nThe string is valid if:\n\n- All non-W characters form a contiguous block. \n\n- The length of this block is at least 2. \n\n- Or the string is all W. \n\nThus, the code should check these conditions. \n\nSo the code for program2 is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    s = s.strip()\n    first = -1\n    last = -1\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c != 'W':\n            if first == -1:\n                first = i\n            last = i\n    if first == -1:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    # Check contiguous block\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\n        if s[i] == 'W':\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Check length >=2\n    if (last - first +1) <2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nThis is much simpler. \n\nTesting the example RBB:\n\nfirst is 0, last is 2. \n\nThe block from 0-2 is R B B \u2192 all non-W. \n\nLength is 3 \u22652 \u2192 YES. \n\nWhich matches the note's example. \n\nAnother test case: \"R\" (length 1) \u2192 first and last are 0. \n\nLength is 1 \u2192 NO. \n\nThe example \"RB\" \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example \"BRB\" \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example \"RBRB\" \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example \"RWB\" \u2192 first is 0, last is 2. \n\nThe block includes position 1 (W) \u2192 invalid \u2192 NO. \n\nThe example \"WRB\" \u2192 first is 1, last is 2. \n\nThe block from 1-2 is RB \u2192 valid. \n\nLength 2 \u2192 YES. \n\nThe example \"BRBB\" (length 4) \u2192 first 0, last 3. \n\nAll non-W \u2192 length 4 \u2192 YES. \n\nThus, this code should work. \n\nSo the missing code for program2 is the code above. \n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe missing code is the loop body:\n\ns = input().strip()\nsum1 = sum(int(d) for d in s[:3])\nsum2 = sum(int(d) for d in s[3:])\nprint(\"YES\" if sum1 == sum2 else \"NO\")\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe code after the for loop:\n\ns = s.strip()\nfirst = -1\nlast = -1\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n    if c != 'W':\n        if first == -1:\n            first = i\n        last = i\nif first == -1:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    continue\nvalid = True\nfor i in range(first, last+1):\n    if s[i] == 'W':\n        valid = False\n        break\nif not valid:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    continue\nif (last - first +1) <2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nThus, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    s = input().strip()\\n    sum1 = sum(int(d) for d in s[:3])\\n    sum2 = sum(int(d) for d in s[3:])\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if sum1 == sum2 else \\\"NO\\\")\",\n  \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    first = -1\\n    last = -1\\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\\n        if c != 'W':\\n            if first == -1:\\n                first = i\\n            last = i\\n    if first == -1:\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        continue\\n    valid = True\\n    for i in range(first, last+1):\\n        if s[i] == 'W':\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    if not valid:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        continue\\n    if (last - first +1) <2:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\"\n}"
