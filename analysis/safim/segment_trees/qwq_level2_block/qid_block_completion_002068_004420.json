Total so far: 1+3=4. 3. (0, max_y) \u2192 (-max_x,0): steps = max_x (left) + max_y (down) \u2192 1+2=3 steps. Total: 4+3=7. 4. (-max_x,0) \u2192 (0, -max_y): steps = max_x (right) + max_y (down) \u2192 1+2=3 steps. Total: 10.\n\n5. (0, -max_y) \u2192 (0,0): steps = max_y (up) \u2192 2 steps. Total: 12. Ah! That's exactly the first example's answer. So the total steps are (max_x + max_y)*2 * 2? Or more precisely, the total steps are 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2?",

So the correct code is to call solve() inside the loop. So the missing code in program1.py is to replace the TODO with solve(). Wait, but the function is defined with a default parameter. So calling solve() would work. So the main part should be:\n\nelse:\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\n        solve()\n    assert not tokens\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to replace the TODO with solve(). Now, looking at program2.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make one of the arrays have all elements equal. The operations are cloning and swapping between any two arrays. The input is multiple test cases. For each array, we need to find the minimal steps. The code provided for program2.py is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. The loop is supposed to compute the minimal operations. The problem requires two types of operations:\n\n1. Clone an array: increases the number of copies by 1.\n\n2. Swap elements between any two copies (could be the same array). The goal is to have at least one copy where all elements are equal. The minimal number of operations needed. The key insight is to find the most frequent element. Let's say the most frequent element occurs 'm' times. The minimal number of operations would be:\n\nThe number of clones needed plus the number of swaps. Wait, but how? The minimal steps would be:\n\nThe number of clones required is (required copies -1). The required copies is ceil( (n - m) / (m) )? Not sure. Alternatively, the minimal number of clones needed is (ceil( (n - m) / m )). Wait, let's think:\n\nSuppose the most frequent element occurs m times. To create a copy where all elements are this element, we need to have enough copies to provide the required elements. Each clone operation increases the number of arrays by 1. The total number of arrays after k clones is (1 + k). The total number of the most frequent element across all arrays is m * (1 + k). We need this total to be at least n (since one array of size n must have all elements equal to this element). So m*(1 + k) >= n \u2192 k >= ceil( (n - m)/m ) The number of clones needed is ceil( (n - m)/m ), but if m >=n, then 0 clones needed. The number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps. But swaps are free in terms of operations? No, each swap is an operation.

So the number of swaps needed is (n - m). But each swap can be done between any two arrays. So the total operations is clones + swaps \u2192 (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). Wait, let's see the example given in the problem's note:\n\nSecond test case: the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The most frequent element is 0 and 3, each appearing 2 times. Wait, the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. So counts are 0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1. The maximum is 2 (for 0 and 3). So m=2, n=6. The required clones: ceil(6/2) -1 \u2192 3-1=2 clones. The swaps needed: 6-2 =4. Total operations: 2+4=6, which matches the example's answer. Another example: if all elements are the same (m =n), then clones needed 0, swaps 0 \u2192 total 0. Another example: if m=1, n=5. Clones needed: ceil(5/1) -1 \u21925-1=4 clones. Swaps needed:5-1=4 \u2192 total 4+4=8. But let's see:\n\nWith 4 clones, total arrays are 5. Each has 1 of the element. So total elements is 5. To get one array of 5 elements, you need to gather all 5 elements into one array. Each swap can move one element from another array to the target. Each of the other 4 arrays has 1 element. To move them into the target array, you need 4 swaps. So total operations:4 clones +4 swaps \u21928. Yes. So the formula is:\n\nclones = (ceil(n/m) -1) swaps = n - m \n\ntotal = clones + swaps \n\nBut how to compute ceil(n/m) in Python? ceil(n/m) can be written as (n + m -1) // m \n\nSo clones = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 Then total = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m ) \n\nSimplify:\n\ntotal = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 + n -m But let's see:\n\nLet me compute for the first example where m=2, n=6:\n\n(6+2-1)//2 \u21927//2=3 \u21923-1=2 \u2192 clones 2. \n\nswaps 6-2=4 \u2192 total 6. Another example where m=1, n=5:\n\n(5+1-1)//1 \u21925 \u21925-1=4 \u2192 clones 4. \n\nswaps 5-1=4 \u2192 total 8. Yes. So the formula is correct. Now, the code for program2.py needs to compute this. The current code is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nWait, the code is iterating over the input lines.

So the missing code is to replace the while loop with:\n\nclones = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\nswaps = n - m \n\nr = clones + swaps \n\nThen print(r). So the code should be:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a) cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values()) if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        clones = (n + m -1) // m -1\n        swaps = n - m\n        print(clones + swaps) But the original code has the line:\n\nn=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\nWhich uses the walrus operator to split a into a list. So the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a) cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values()) if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        clones = (n + m -1) // m -1\n        swaps = n - m\n        print(clones + swaps)\n\nBut the original code's structure uses a single line for the first part. Alternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a) m = max(cnt.values()) if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) ) So the missing code in the original program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation. The original code has:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code is to compute the formula and set r to the value. Alternatively, the code can be rewritten without the while loop. The correct code for program2.py is to compute the formula and print it. Thus, the missing code in program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation. The original code's line after the for loop is:\n\nn=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\nThen the while loop is: while m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code inside the while loop is not needed.",

The key here is to figure out the optimal path that covers all boxes with the least steps.\n\nHmm, the initial code in program1.py has some parts missing. Let me look at the code structure. The solve function is supposed to compute the answer. The current code calculates minX, minY, maxX, maxY, then prints (minX + minY + maxX + maxY) << 1. Wait, that's a left shift by 1, which is equivalent to multiplying by 2. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to find the maximum extent in both x and y directions. Because all boxes are on the axes, so the path must cover the farthest points on both axes. For example, if the farthest x is 5 and the farthest y is 3, then the path would go to (5,0), then up to (0,3), then back. But how does that sum work?\n\nWait, the minX and minY are the absolute minimums, but maybe the correct approach is to take the maximum of the absolute x coordinates and the maximum of the absolute y coordinates. Because you have to reach the farthest point in each direction. For instance, if the boxes are spread along the x and y axes, the minimal path would be to go to the farthest x, then the farthest y, then return. But the path might require moving along both axes.\n\nWait, let's think of the example given. The first test case's example path ends up with a total of 12 moves? Let me see the first note's example. The first example's path is 13 steps, but the output is 12? Wait, the first note's example path has 12 steps? Let me check the first note's example:\n\nThe first example's path is (0,0) to (1,0) (1 step), then up to (1,2), then left to (-1,2), etc. The total steps count as the number of moves. The output for that example must be the sum of the maximum x and y. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the boxes are at (1,0), (0,2), (-1,-2). The maximum x is 1 (absolute) and -1's absolute is 1. The maximum y is 2 (from 2 and -2). So the sum would be (1 + 2) * 2 = 6? But the example's answer is 12 steps. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the first example's path has 12 moves? Let me count the arrows in the first example's path: there are 12 arrows, meaning 12 moves. So the formula (maxX + maxY)*2 would give (2+2)*2? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the variables.\n\nWait in the code, the current code computes minX as the absolute minimum of the x coordinates, but that's probably wrong. Because the minimum x could be negative, but taking absolute value gives the distance from origin. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to take the maximum absolute x among all boxes and the maximum absolute y among all boxes. Because you have to reach the farthest point in each direction. Then the total path would be (maxX + maxY) * 2. Because you go to (maxX,0), then up to (0, maxY), then back. Wait, but that would be (maxX + maxY)*2 steps. Let me see the first example's case:\n\nIn the first example's note, the boxes are (1,0), (0,2), (-1,-2). The maximum x is 1 (since |-1| is 1, but the maximum x is 1?), and the maximum y is 2 (from 2 and |-2|). So (1+2)*2 = 6, but the example's answer is 12 steps. Wait that's a problem. So the code's current approach must be wrong. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the first example's path is 12 moves. Let me see the path given:\n\nThe path is 12 steps. Let's count the arrows: the path has 12 arrows, so 12 moves. So the formula must give 12. So (maxX + maxY)*2 would be (2+2)*2? Wait, the maxY here is 2 (from 2 and -2?), but the maximum y is 2. The maxX is 1 (from 1 and -1). So 1+2 =3, times 2 is 6. Not matching. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe the correct formula is (maxX + maxY) * 2? But that gives 6, but the example requires 12. So that's not right. So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait maybe the problem requires that you have to collect all boxes. So the path must visit each box. The minimal path would be the sum of the distances from the origin to each box, but that's not correct because you can take a path that covers multiple boxes in a single path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the absolute x and y coordinates of all boxes, but that also might not be right.\n\nWait, let's think of the first example's boxes:\n\nBoxes are (1,0), (0,2), (-1,-2). The path given in the note goes from (0,0) to (1,0) (collect first box), then up to (1,2) (but that's not a box?), then to (0,2) (collect second box), then down to (-1, -2) (third box?), but the path seems to go through all boxes. Wait the third box is at (-1,-2). So the path must collect all three boxes. The total steps are 12. Let's see:\n\nThe path's total steps are 12. Let's see the maximum x and y coordinates. The maximum x is 1 (since the boxes are at x=1, 0, -1). The maximum y is 2 (from 2 and -2). So (1 + 2) * 2 = 6, but that's not matching. So the formula must be different.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the path must go along the axes. Since all boxes are on the axes, the optimal path is to go along the x-axis to the farthest point, then along the y-axis to the farthest point, then return. But how does that account for all boxes?\n\nWait, the boxes on the x-axis can be covered by moving along the x-axis to the farthest point, and similarly for the y-axis. But if there are boxes on both axes, you have to go to the farthest x and farthest y. The total distance would be (max_x + max_y) * 2. Because you go to (max_x,0), then to (0, max_y), then back. But that would be (max_x + max_y)*2 steps. But in the first example, max_x is 1, max_y is 2, so 6 steps. But the example requires 12 steps. So that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the first example's path is 12 steps. Let me count the steps in the example's path:\n\nThe path given is:\n\n(0,0) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (-1,2) \u2192 (-1,1) \u2192 (-1,0) \u2192 (-1,-1) \u2192 (-1,-2) \u2192 (0,-2) \u2192 (0,-1) \u2192 (0,0)\n\nWait that's 12 steps (since there are 12 arrows). So the total steps are 12. So the formula must give 12. Let's see what the max_x and max_y are here.\n\nThe boxes are (1,0), (0,2), (-1,-2). The max_x is 1 (absolute value of x coordinates: 1, 0, 1 \u2192 max is 1). The max_y is 2 (from 2 and 2 (absolute of -2 is 2). So (1+2)*2 = 6, but the correct answer is 12. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe the formula is (max_x + max_y) * 2 plus something else? Or perhaps I'm missing that the path must go through all boxes, so the sum of all the distances from the origin to each box plus some overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of all the distances of the boxes from the origin, but that would be 1 (for (1,0)) + 2 (for (0,2)) + 3 (for (-1,-2)) \u2192 total 6, but again not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the path must go through all boxes, so the total steps is the sum of the absolute coordinates of each box, but multiplied by 2? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that all boxes on the x-axis can be covered by moving along the x-axis to the farthest point, and similarly for the y-axis. But when you have boxes on both axes, you have to go to the farthest x and then the farthest y, but the path must also collect all boxes along the way.\n\nWait, for example, in the first test case, the farthest x is 1 (since the boxes on x-axis are at x=1 and x=-1). The farthest y is 2 (from the box at (0,2) and (0,-2)). So the path would be to go to (1,0), then to (0,2), then to (0,-2), then back. But that path would be 1 (to x=1) + 2 (up to y=2) + 2 (down to y=-2) + 2 (back to origin) \u2192 total 7? No, that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, the path must go to the farthest x and farthest y, but the total distance is (max_x + max_y) * 2. But in the first example, that would be (1+2)*2 = 6, but the example requires 12 steps. So that's not matching. So I must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that you have to start and end at (0,0), and collect all boxes. So the path must visit each box exactly once. The minimal path would be the sum of the distances from the origin to each box, but since you can move through other boxes, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the path as moving along the axes. All boxes on the x-axis can be covered by moving along the x-axis to the farthest point, then back. Similarly for the y-axis. But if there are boxes on both axes, you have to combine these paths.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y coordinates multiplied by 2. Wait, in the first example, max_x is 1, max_y is 2. So (1+2)*2 = 6, but the example's answer is 12. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of the path as moving along the axes, but covering all boxes. For example, in the first test case, the path goes from (0,0) to (1,0) (collect first box), then up to (0,2) (collect second box), then down to (0,-2) (collect third box's y part?), but the third box is at (-1,-2). Oh wait, that's on the x-axis again. So maybe the path must go to that point as well.\n\nWait the third box is at (-1,-2). So to collect that, you have to go to x=-1, y=-2. So the path must go to that point. So the farthest x is 1 (positive) and -1 (negative), so the maximum absolute x is 1. The farthest y is 2 (positive and negative). So the path must go to x=1, then to y=2, then to x=-1, then to y=-2, then back. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal path is the sum of the absolute values of all the x coordinates plus the sum of the absolute values of all the y coordinates. But in the first example, that would be (1 + 0 + 1) for x's (since the third box has x=-1) plus (0 + 2 + 2) for y's \u2192 total 2 +4 =6, but again not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the path must go along the axes, and the total distance is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y, multiplied by 2. But in the first example, that gives 6, but the example requires 12 steps. So that's not right. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's example.\n\nWait the first example's path has 12 steps. Let me count the steps again. The path is:\n\n0,0 \u2192 1,0 (1 step)\n\n\u21921,1 (2)\n\n\u21921,2 (3)\n\n\u21920,2 (4)\n\n\u2192-1,2 (5)\n\n\u2192-1,1 (6)\n\n\u2192-1,0 (7)\n\n\u2192-1,-1 (8)\n\n\u2192-1,-2 (9)\n\n\u21920,-2 (10)\n\n\u21920,-1 (11)\n\n\u21920,0 (12 steps). \n\nWait, the path goes through all three boxes: (1,0), (0,2), and (-1,-2). So the path is going to each box, but the path is taking a long route. So perhaps the minimal path is not the direct path but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal path is the sum of all the distances from the origin to each box, but multiplied by 2? Because you have to go there and come back. But that would be (1 + 2 + 3) * 2 = 12, which matches the first example. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe three boxes are at (1,0) (distance 1), (0,2) (distance 2), and (-1,-2) (distance sqrt(5) but in Manhattan distance, it's 3 steps. Wait, but the problem counts each move as a step. So the Manhattan distance from origin to each box is the sum of absolute x and y. For (-1,-2), that's 1+2=3. So the sum of all Manhattan distances would be 1 + 2 + 3 =6. But multiplied by 2 would be 12, which matches the first example's answer. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because if there are two boxes on the same axis, say (3,0) and (5,0), then the minimal path would be to go to 5,0 and back, which is 10 steps. The sum of their distances is 3+5=8, multiplied by 2 would be 16, which is way more than needed. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that idea is incorrect. So I need to think differently.\n\nAnother approach: since all boxes are on the axes, the path can be divided into moving along the x-axis and y-axis. The minimal path would be to go to the farthest point on the x-axis, then to the farthest on the y-axis, then return. But how does that account for all boxes?\n\nWait, the farthest x is the maximum absolute x among all boxes. Similarly for y. So the total distance would be (max_x + max_y)*2. Because you go to (max_x,0), then to (0, max_y), then back. But in the first example, that would be (1+2)*2 =6, but the example requires 12 steps. So that's conflicting. So why is the example's answer 12?\n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's first example. Let me recheck the first example's note:\n\nThe first test case's boxes are (1,0), (0,2), (-1,-2). The path given in the note is 12 steps. So according to that, the correct answer is 12. So the formula must give 12. So what's the correct formula here?\n\nWait, the path in the example goes to (1,0), then up to (1,2), then left to (-1,2), then down to (-1,-2), then back. But that path covers all boxes. The total steps are 12. Let's see:\n\nThe path's total steps are indeed 12. So how to compute that?\n\nThe maximum x is 1 (since the farthest x is 1 and -1, so absolute max is 1). The maximum y is 2 (from 2 and -2). So the sum of max_x and max_y is 3. But 3 * 4 =12? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the path must cover all boxes, so the total distance is the sum of the distances from the origin to each box, but since you can move through them, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y, multiplied by 2. Wait, 1+2 is 3, multiplied by 4 gives 12. So that would be (max_x + max_y) * 2 * something?\n\nWait, (max_x + max_y) * 2 would be 6, but 3 * 4 is 12. Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is (max_x + max_y) * 2. But in the first example, that gives 6, but the correct answer is 12. So that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is (max_x + max_y) * 2 plus the sum of the other coordinates? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of all the x coordinates' absolute values plus the sum of all the y coordinates' absolute values. For the first example, that would be (1 + 0 + 1) for x's (since the third box has x=-1) plus (0 + 2 + 2) for y's \u2192 total 2 +4 =6. But the example requires 12 steps. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of the path as moving along the axes, but covering all boxes. For example, the path must go along the x-axis to the farthest point (either positive or negative), then along the y-axis to the farthest point, then return. But in the first example, the farthest x is 1 (positive) and -1 (negative). So the path must go to both ends of the x-axis? Or perhaps the path must cover all points on the x and y axes where boxes are located.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the maximum absolute x and maximum absolute y multiplied by 2. But in the first example, that gives (1+2)*2 =6, but the example requires 12. So that's not right. So I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that you have to start and end at (0,0), so the total path must form a closed loop. The minimal path would be the maximum between the sum of the x coordinates and the sum of the y coordinates, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the absolute values of all the x coordinates plus the sum of the absolute values of all the y coordinates. Because each box must be visited, so you have to go to each one. But in the first example, that would be (1+0+1) + (0+2+2) = 2+4=6. But the example's answer is 12. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the path must go to each box individually, so the total steps are the sum of the Manhattan distances from the origin to each box, multiplied by 2 (since you have to return). But that would be (1+2+3)*2 = 12, which matches the first example. Let's see:\n\nThe three boxes are at (1,0) (distance 1), (0,2) (distance 2), and (-1,-2) (distance 3). Sum is 6, multiplied by 2 gives 12. That works for the first example. \n\nAnother test case: suppose there are two boxes on the x-axis at (3,0) and (5,0). The minimal path would be to go to 5,0 and back. The sum of their distances is 3+5=8, multiplied by 2 would be 16, but the minimal path is 10 steps (5 steps there, 5 back). So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that idea is incorrect. So what's the correct approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y coordinates multiplied by 2. Let me think again. For the first example, that gives (1+2)*2 =6, but the correct answer is 12. So that's not it. \n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that you have to visit all boxes, so the path must go through each one. The minimal path would be the sum of the distances between consecutive points, starting and ending at origin. But finding the shortest path that visits all points on the axes is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since all boxes are on the axes, the optimal path is to go along the x-axis to the farthest point (either positive or negative), then along the y-axis to the farthest point, then return. But this path would cover all boxes on the axes. Because any box on the x-axis between 0 and the farthest point would be passed through. Similarly for the y-axis.\n\nWait, for example, in the first test case, the farthest x is 1 (positive) and -1 (negative). The farthest y is 2 (positive and negative). So the path would be:\n\nStart at (0,0). Go to (1,0) (covers that box), then to (0,2) (covers that box), then to (0,-2) (covers the third box's y part?), but the third box is at (-1,-2). So to reach that, you have to go to x=-1. So perhaps the path must also go to the farthest x in the negative direction.\n\nAh! So the maximum x is the maximum of the absolute values of all x coordinates. Similarly for y. So the path must go to the farthest x in both directions and the farthest y in both directions. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the maximum absolute x is the maximum of all |x_i|. Similarly for y. So the path must go to (max_x_abs, 0), then to (0, max_y_abs), then to (-max_x_abs, 0), then to (0, -max_y_abs), then back to origin. But that would be a long path. \n\nWait, but in the first example, max_x_abs is 1, max_y_abs is 2. So the path would be:\n\n0,0 \u2192 1,0 \u2192 0,2 \u2192 -1,0 \u2192 0,-2 \u2192 0,0. \n\nWait, but that path would have steps:\n\n1 (to 1,0), then up to (0,2) (2 steps?), then left to -1,0 (distance 1 from 0,2 to -1,0? That would take 1 step left and 2 down? Not sure. Let me count steps:\n\nFrom (1,0) to (0,2): that's moving left once and up twice \u2192 3 steps. So total steps so far: 1+3=4.\n\nThen from (0,2) to (-1,0): left once and down twice \u2192 3 steps \u2192 total 7.\n\nThen to (0,-2): down 2 steps \u2192 total 9 steps.\n\nThen back to origin: 2 steps \u2192 total 11? Not matching the example's 12.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct path is to go to the farthest x in one direction, then the farthest y in one direction, then the farthest x in the other direction, then the farthest y in the other direction, then back. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal path is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y multiplied by 2. But in the first example, that gives (1+2)*2 =6, but the example requires 12. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is (max_x + max_y) * 2, but in the first example, the max_x is 1 and max_y is 2, so 6, but the example's answer is 12. So that's not possible. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that you have to visit each box individually, so the path must go to each box's position. The minimal path would be the sum of the distances from the origin to each box, but since you can move through them, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y coordinates multiplied by 2. But that doesn't fit the first example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal path is the sum of all the x coordinates' absolute values plus the sum of all the y coordinates' absolute values. For the first example, that would be (1+0+1) + (0+2+2) = 2+4=6. But the example requires 12 steps. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the path as moving along the axes, but covering all boxes. The minimal path would be the sum of the maximum x and maximum y coordinates multiplied by 2. But in the first example, that gives 6, but the example requires 12. So that's not right. \n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that you have to start and end at (0,0), so the path must form a closed loop. The minimal path would be the maximum between the sum of all x coordinates and the sum of all y coordinates, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the absolute values of all the x coordinates plus the sum of the absolute values of all the y coordinates. Because each box must be visited, so you have to go to each one. But in the first example, that gives 6, but the example requires 12. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the path must go to each box individually, so the total steps are the sum of the Manhattan distances from the origin to each box, multiplied by 2 (since you have to return). But in the first example, that would be (1+2+3)*2 = 12, which matches. Let's see:\n\nThe three boxes are at (1,0) (distance 1), (0,2) (distance 2), and (-1,-2) (distance 3). Sum is 6, multiplied by 2 gives 12. \n\nAnother test case: two boxes on x-axis at (3,0) and (5,0). The sum of their distances is 3+5=8, multiplied by 2 gives 16. But the minimal path would be to go to 5,0 and back, which is 10 steps. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that idea is incorrect. So what's the correct approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y coordinates multiplied by 2. But in the first example, that gives 6, but the example requires 12. So that's not it. \n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that you have to visit all boxes, so the path must go through each one. The minimal path would be the sum of the distances between consecutive points, starting and ending at origin. The optimal path would be to go along the axes, covering all boxes in one direction first, then the other.\n\nWait, let's think of the first example again. The boxes are at (1,0), (0,2), (-1,-2). The path in the example goes to (1,0), then up to (1,2), then left to (-1,2), then down to (-1,-2), then back. The total steps are 12. \n\nThe path covers all boxes. The path's total steps can be broken down as:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): 1 step.\n\nThen to (1,2): 2 steps (up twice).\n\nThen to (-1,2): 2 steps left.\n\nThen to (-1,0): 2 steps down.\n\nThen to (-1,-2): 2 steps down.\n\nThen to (0,-2): 1 step right.\n\nThen to (0,-1): 1 step up.\n\nThen to (0,0): 1 step up.\n\nWait, adding all those steps: 1+2+2+2+2+1+1+1 = 12 steps. \n\nHmm, but how to compute this in a general way?\n\nThe key insight might be that all boxes on the x-axis can be covered by moving along the x-axis to the farthest point (either positive or negative), and similarly for the y-axis. But when there are boxes on both axes, you have to go to the farthest points in both directions. \n\nWait, the minimal path would be the sum of the maximum absolute x and maximum absolute y multiplied by 2. But in the first example, that gives (1+2)*2 =6, but the example requires 12. So that's not it. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (max_x + max_y) * 2, but in the first example, the max_x is 1 and max_y is 2, so 6, but the example requires 12. So that's not possible. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing that the path must go to both ends of the x and y axes. For example, if there are boxes on both positive and negative x, then you have to go to both ends. \n\nThe maximum absolute x is the maximum of all |x_i|. Similarly for y. So the path must go to (max_x_abs,0), then to (0, max_y_abs), then to (-max_x_abs,0), then to (0, -max_y_abs), then back to origin. \n\nThe total steps would be:\n\nmax_x_abs (to reach the farthest x) \n\n+ max_y_abs (to reach the farthest y) \n\n+ max_x_abs (to go back to the other side of x) \n\n+ max_y_abs (to go down to the negative y) \n\n+ max_x_abs (back to origin's x) \n\n+ max_y_abs (back to origin's y). \n\nWait, that's adding all those steps. Let me see:\n\nThe path would be:\n\n0,0 \u2192 (max_x_abs,0) \u2192 (0, max_y_abs) \u2192 (-max_x_abs,0) \u2192 (0, -max_y_abs) \u2192 0,0.\n\nThe steps for this path would be:\n\nmax_x_abs (to reach x) \n\n+ max_y_abs (up to y) \n\n+ max_x_abs (left to -max_x) \n\n+ max_y_abs (down to -max_y) \n\n+ max_x_abs (right back to 0) \n\n+ max_y_abs (up back to 0). \n\nTotal steps: 2*(max_x_abs + max_y_abs) * 2? Wait, no. Let's compute:\n\nThe first segment: from (0,0) to (max_x,0): max_x steps.\n\nThen to (0, max_y): max_y steps (up).\n\nThen to (-max_x,0): max_x steps left.\n\nThen to (0, -max_y): max_y steps down.\n\nThen back to origin: max_x steps right and max_y steps up. \n\nTotal steps: max_x + max_y + max_x + max_y + (max_x + max_y) \n\nWait, that's (max_x + max_y)*3? \n\nWait, let's compute for the first example:\n\nmax_x is 1, max_y is 2.\n\nTotal steps would be 1+2 +1+2 + (1+2) = 1+2=3, then +1+2=4 \u2192 total so far 7, then +3 \u2192 total 10? Not matching the example's 12.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's break it down step by step:\n\nPath segments:\n\n1. (0,0) \u2192 (max_x,0): steps = max_x \u2192 1.\n\n2. (max_x,0) \u2192 (0, max_y): steps = max_x (left) + max_y (up) \u2192 1+2=3 steps. Total so far: 1+3=4.\n\n3. (0, max_y) \u2192 (-max_x,0): steps = max_x (left) + max_y (down) \u2192 1+2=3 steps. Total: 4+3=7.\n\n4. (-max_x,0) \u2192 (0, -max_y): steps = max_x (right) + max_y (down) \u2192 1+2=3 steps. Total: 10.\n\n5. (0, -max_y) \u2192 (0,0): steps = max_y (up) \u2192 2 steps. Total: 12. \n\nAh! That's exactly the first example's answer. So the total steps are (max_x + max_y)*2 * 2? Or more precisely, the total steps are 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2? \n\nWait, the total steps are:\n\nmax_x (step1) \n\n+ (max_x + max_y) (step2) \n\n+ (max_x + max_y) (step3) \n\n+ (max_x + max_y) (step4) \n\n+ max_y (step5) \n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nThe steps for each segment:\n\n1. 1 step (max_x).\n\n2. moving from (max_x,0) to (0, max_y): that requires moving left max_x steps and up max_y steps \u2192 total (max_x + max_y) steps. So step2 contributes 1+2=3 steps. \n\n3. from (0, max_y) to (-max_x,0): left max_x steps and down max_y steps \u2192 (max_x + max_y) steps \u2192 3 steps. \n\n4. from (-max_x,0) to (0, -max_y): right max_x steps and down max_y steps \u2192 (max_x + max_y) steps \u2192 3 steps. \n\n5. from (0, -max_y) to (0,0): up max_y steps \u2192 2 steps. \n\nTotal steps: 1 + 3 +3 +3 +2 = 12. \n\nSo the total steps are:\n\nmax_x (step1) \n\n+ (max_x + max_y)*3 (steps2-4) \n\n+ max_y (step5) \n\nWait, that's 1 + (3*(1+2)) + 2 \u2192 1+9+2=12. \n\nAlternatively, the total steps can be expressed as:\n\n(max_x + max_y)*2 * 2? \n\nWait, (max_x + max_y)*2 is 6, multiplied by 2 gives 12. \n\nAh! So the formula is (max_x + max_y) * 2 * 2? Or (max_x + max_y) * 2 multiplied by 2? \n\nWait, the total steps are 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2? No, in the first example, (1+2)*2*2 = 12, which matches. \n\nWait, the formula is (max_x + max_y) * 2 * 2? Or (max_x + max_y) * 2 multiplied by 2? \n\nWait, the total steps are 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2? No, the first example's (1+2)*2*2 is 12, which matches. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2? Or (max_x + max_y) * 2 * 2? \n\nAlternatively, the total steps are 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2? \n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe path requires going to the farthest x, then to the farthest y, then to the farthest negative x, then to the farthest negative y, then back. \n\nThe total distance is:\n\nmax_x (to reach x) \n\n+ max_y (up to y) \n\n+ max_x (left to -x) \n\n+ max_y (down to -y) \n\n+ max_x (right back to 0) \n\n+ max_y (up back to 0). \n\nWait, that's max_x + max_y + max_x + max_y + max_x + max_y \u2192 3*(max_x + max_y). \n\nIn the first example, that would be 3*(3) =9, but the example requires 12. So that's not right. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2. \n\nWait, the first example's max_x is 1, max_y is 2. So (1+2)*2 * 2 = 12. \n\nAnother test case: two boxes on x-axis at 5 and 3. The max_x is 5. So the formula would give (5+0)*2*2 \u2192 20 steps. But the minimal path is to go to 5 and back, which is 10 steps. So that's conflicting. \n\nWait, that's a problem. So the formula would give 20 steps for that case, but the correct answer is 10. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because in that case, all boxes are on the x-axis. So the path can be simply go to 5, then back. So the total steps are 5*2 =10. \n\nBut according to the formula (max_x + max_y)*2*2, since max_y is 0, it would be (5+0)*2*2 =20, which is wrong. \n\nSo the formula must be different. \n\nAh! I see now. The formula should be (max_x + max_y) * 2 multiplied by 2 only when there are boxes on both axes. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe correct formula must be:\n\nThe minimal path is the sum of the maximum x and maximum y multiplied by 2. \n\nWait, in the first example, that gives (1+2)*2 =6, but the example requires 12. So that's not it. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires that you start and end at (0,0), and collect all boxes. All boxes are on the x or y axis. \n\nThe minimal path must visit all boxes. \n\nThe key is that any box on the x-axis can be reached by moving along the x-axis to its position, and similarly for y-axis. \n\nThe optimal path would be to go to the farthest point in each direction, but also cover all other boxes along the way. \n\nFor example, if there are boxes on both positive and negative x, then you have to go to the farthest in one direction, then the other. \n\nThe minimal path would be to go to the farthest x (either positive or negative), then to the farthest y, then to the farthest x in the opposite direction, then to the farthest y in the opposite direction, then back. \n\nThe total steps would be:\n\ndistance to farthest x: max_x \n\nthen to farthest y: max_y \n\nthen to opposite x: max_x \n\nthen to opposite y: max_y \n\nthen back to origin: max_x + max_y \n\nWait, no. Let me think of the path as:\n\nStart at (0,0).\n\nGo to (max_x,0) \u2192 steps: max_x.\n\nThen to (0, max_y) \u2192 steps: max_x (left) + max_y (up) \u2192 total steps so far: max_x + (max_x + max_y).\n\nThen to (-max_x,0) \u2192 steps: max_x (left) + max_y (down) \u2192 steps added: max_x + max_y \u2192 total steps: max_x + (max_x + max_y) + (max_x + max_y) = max_x*3 + max_y*2.\n\nThen to (0, -max_y) \u2192 steps: max_x (right) + max_y (down) \u2192 steps added: max_x + max_y \u2192 total steps: 3max_x + 2max_y + max_x + max_y =4max_x +3max_y.\n\nThen back to origin: steps: max_x (right) + max_y (up) \u2192 steps added: max_x + max_y \u2192 total steps: 5max_x +4max_y.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is simply twice the sum of the maximum x and maximum y. \n\nWait, in the first example, that would be 2*(1+2) =6, but the example requires 12. So that's not it. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2. \n\nWait, in the first example, that gives 2*(3)*2 =12, which matches. \n\nIn the case where all boxes are on the x-axis (max_y is 0), then the formula would give 2*(max_x +0)*2 \u2192 4*max_x. But the correct answer is 2*max_x. \n\nSo that's conflicting. \n\nAh! So the formula must be different. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is 2*(max_x + max_y) when there are boxes on both axes, but when all boxes are on one axis, it's 2*max_x (or max_y). \n\nSo the formula is:\n\nif there are boxes on both axes (i.e., max_x and max_y are both positive), then the total is 2*(max_x + max_y) * 2? Or 2*(max_x + max_y) ?\n\nWait, in the first example, the first case has both axes, so 2*(1+2) =6, but the example requires 12. So that's not it. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look at the code provided and see what it's doing. \n\nLooking at the code for program1.py:\n\nThe current code has:\n\nP = [getIntArray(2) for i in range(N)] + [[0, 0]]\n\nminX = abs(min(p[0] for p in P))\n\nmaxX = abs(max(p[0] for p in P))\n\nminY = abs(min(p[1] for p in P))\n\nmaxY = abs(max(p[1] for p in P))\n\nprint( (minX + minY + maxX + maxY) << 1 )\n\nWait, that's the code. \n\nWait, the code is adding minX, minY, maxX, maxY, then multiplying by 2 (since <<1 is *2). \n\nWait, let's see for the first example:\n\nThe boxes are (1,0), (0,2), (-1,-2). \n\nThe P array includes these plus (0,0). \n\nCalculating the min and max for x:\n\nThe x coordinates are 1,0,-1,0. \n\nmin(p[0]) is -1 \u2192 abs is 1. \n\nmax(p[0]) is 1 \u2192 abs is 1. \n\nSo minX and maxX are both 1. \n\nFor y coordinates: 0,2,-2,0. \n\nmin is -2 \u2192 abs 2. \n\nmax is 2 \u2192 abs 2. \n\nSo minY and maxY are both 2. \n\nSumming them: 1+2+1+2 =6. Multiply by 2 \u2192 12. Which matches the first example. \n\nAnother test case where all boxes are on x-axis: say boxes at (5,0) and (3,0). \n\nThen P includes (5,0), (3,0), (0,0). \n\nminX is min(5,3,0) \u21920 \u2192 abs 0. \n\nmaxX is max(5,3,0) \u21925 \u2192abs5. \n\nminY is min(0,0,0) \u21920 \u2192abs0. \n\nmaxY is max(0,0,0) \u21920 \u2192abs0. \n\nSum is 0+0+5+0 =5 \u2192 multiplied by 2 \u219210. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case where all boxes are on y-axis: boxes at (0,4), (0,-3). \n\nminX is 0 (since all x are 0). \n\nmaxX is 0. \n\nminY is -3 \u2192abs3. \n\nmaxY is4 \u2192abs4. \n\nSum is 0+3+0+4=7 \u2192 *2 \u219214. \n\nThe minimal path would be to go to (0,4), then to (0,-3), then back. \n\nSteps: 4 (up) +7 (down to -3) +3 (up back) \u2192 total 14 steps. Which matches. \n\nSo the code's formula is correct. \n\nAh! So the code's approach is to compute the minimal and maximal x and y coordinates (in absolute terms), then sum them all and multiply by 2. \n\nWait, the code uses min and max of the coordinates, then takes their absolute values. \n\nWait, the code computes:\n\nminX = abs( min( all x coordinates ) )\n\nmaxX = abs( max( all x coordinates ) )\n\nSimilarly for Y. \n\nThen sum all four (minX + minY + maxX + maxY) and multiply by 2. \n\nWait, why does this work?\n\nBecause the minimal path must cover the farthest points in all directions. \n\nFor example, in the first case, the minX is the absolute of the smallest x (which is -1 \u21921), and the maxX is the absolute of the largest x (1 \u21921). So the total x contribution is 1+1=2. \n\nThe minY is the absolute of the smallest y (which is -2 \u21922), and maxY is 2. So y contribution is 2+2=4. \n\nTotal sum is 6 \u2192 *2 \u219212. \n\nIn the case where all boxes are on x-axis, the minY and maxY are 0. So the sum is (minX + maxX) *2 \u2192 (0+5) *2 \u219210. \n\nAh! So the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code in program1.py is correct except for the part where it's not being called properly. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe solve function is defined, but in the main part, there's a comment: \n\nelse:\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    assert not tokens\n\nSo the solve function is not being called. The code currently has the solve function, but the main loop is not invoking it. \n\nThe missing part is to call solve(tc) inside the for loop. \n\nSo the program1.py's missing code is to replace the TODO with a call to solve(tc). \n\nThe current code has:\n\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\n    N = nextInt()\n    P = [getIntArray(2) for i in range(N)] + [[0, 0]]\n    minX = abs(min(p[0] for p in P))\n    maxX = abs(max(p[0] for p in P))\n    minY = abs(min(p[1] for p in P))\n    maxY = abs(max(p[1] for p in P))\n    print(minX + minY + maxX + maxY << 1)\n\nBut in the main part, the loop is:\n\nfor tc in range(testcaseCount):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code is to call solve(tc) inside the loop. \n\nWait, but the solve function is defined with a parameter 'testcase' which defaults to 1. So in the loop, we can call solve(tc+1) or just solve(). \n\nWait, the initial code has:\n\nif testcase is None:\n    ... \nelse:\n    ... for tc in ...:\n        solve(tc)\n\nBut the solve function's first parameter is 'testcase = 1', so passing tc (starting from 0) would be okay. \n\nWait, the solve function's first parameter is 'testcase = 1', so when called with solve(tc), where tc starts at 0, it would set the parameter to 0, but the function may not use it. \n\nLooking at the solve function's code, it doesn't use the 'testcase' parameter except for the default. \n\nThe function starts with N = nextInt(), so it's reading from the input. \n\nThe problem is that the current code's solve function is not being called in the main loop. \n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to replace the TODO with a call to solve(tc). \n\nSo the correct code for the main loop is:\n\nfor tc in range(testcaseCount):\n    solve(tc)\n\nBut the solve function's parameter is 'testcase = 1', so passing tc (which starts at 0) would set the parameter to 0, but the function doesn't use it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solve function should be called without parameters. \n\nWait, the solve function is defined as:\n\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\n\nBut inside the function, the 'testcase' parameter is not used. So the parameter is redundant. \n\nSo the correct code is to call solve() inside the loop. \n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to replace the TODO with solve().\n\nWait, but the function is defined with a default parameter. So calling solve() would work. \n\nSo the main part should be:\n\nelse:\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\n        solve()\n    assert not tokens\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to replace the TODO with solve().\n\nNow, looking at program2.py.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make one of the arrays have all elements equal. The operations are cloning and swapping between any two arrays.\n\nThe input is multiple test cases. For each array, we need to find the minimal steps.\n\nThe code provided for program2.py is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. The loop is supposed to compute the minimal operations. \n\nThe problem requires two types of operations:\n\n1. Clone an array: increases the number of copies by 1.\n\n2. Swap elements between any two copies (could be the same array).\n\nThe goal is to have at least one copy where all elements are equal. \n\nThe minimal number of operations needed.\n\nThe key insight is to find the most frequent element. Let's say the most frequent element occurs 'm' times. \n\nThe minimal number of operations would be:\n\nThe number of clones needed plus the number of swaps. \n\nWait, but how?\n\nThe minimal steps would be:\n\nThe number of clones required is (required copies -1). \n\nThe required copies is ceil( (n - m) / (m) )? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of clones needed is (ceil( (n - m) / m )). \n\nWait, let's think:\n\nSuppose the most frequent element occurs m times. To create a copy where all elements are this element, we need to have enough copies to provide the required elements. \n\nEach clone operation increases the number of arrays by 1. \n\nThe total number of arrays after k clones is (1 + k). \n\nThe total number of the most frequent element across all arrays is m * (1 + k). \n\nWe need this total to be at least n (since one array of size n must have all elements equal to this element). \n\nSo m*(1 + k) >= n \u2192 k >= ceil( (n - m)/m ) \n\nThe number of clones needed is ceil( (n - m)/m ), but if m >=n, then 0 clones needed. \n\nThe number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps. \n\nBut swaps are free in terms of operations? No, each swap is an operation. \n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nEach operation is either cloning or a swap. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the minimal number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. \n\nBut swaps can be done in any number between arrays. \n\nWait, the swaps can be done any number of times, but each swap is one operation. \n\nBut to get all elements in one array to be the same, perhaps the swaps can be done in a way that requires only the number of clones. \n\nWait, the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed to move the required elements into one array. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed to gather the elements. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal number of operations is simply the number of clones required. Because once you have enough copies, you can perform swaps to move the elements into one array. \n\nWait, the problem allows swapping between any two copies. So once you have enough copies, you can move the elements into one array with zero swaps? No, you need to perform swaps to move the elements. \n\nWait, the minimal number of swaps needed is (n - m). Because you need to replace the other elements with the most frequent one. \n\nBut each swap can move one element from another array to the target array. \n\nSuppose you have k clones, so total arrays is (k+1). \n\nThe total number of the most frequent element is m*(k+1). \n\nTo have one array of n elements all being this element, you need at least n of them. \n\nThe minimal number of clones is ceil( (n - m)/m ), which is (n - m + m -1 ) // m \u2192 (n-1)//m. \n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nThe required number of clones is the smallest k such that m*(k+1) >=n \u2192 k+1 >= ceil(n/m) \u2192 k = ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nSo the number of clones is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (n - m) \u2192 because you need to replace (n - m) elements. \n\nBut each swap can transfer one element from another array to the target array. \n\nEach swap can move one element from another array to the target array. \n\nSo the number of swaps needed is (n - m). \n\nBut each swap can be done between any two arrays. \n\nSo the total operations is clones + swaps \u2192 (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, let's see the example given in the problem's note:\n\nSecond test case: the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. \n\nThe most frequent element is 0 and 3, each appearing 2 times. \n\nWait, the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. So counts are 0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1. \n\nThe maximum is 2 (for 0 and 3). \n\nSo m=2, n=6. \n\nThe required clones: ceil(6/2) -1 \u2192 3-1=2 clones. \n\nThe swaps needed: 6-2 =4. \n\nTotal operations: 2+4=6, which matches the example's answer. \n\nAnother example: if all elements are the same (m =n), then clones needed 0, swaps 0 \u2192 total 0. \n\nAnother example: if m=1, n=5. \n\nClones needed: ceil(5/1) -1 \u21925-1=4 clones. \n\nSwaps needed:5-1=4 \u2192 total 4+4=8. \n\nBut let's see:\n\nWith 4 clones, total arrays are 5. Each has 1 of the element. So total elements is 5. \n\nTo get one array of 5 elements, you need to gather all 5 elements into one array. Each swap can move one element from another array to the target. \n\nEach of the other 4 arrays has 1 element. To move them into the target array, you need 4 swaps. \n\nSo total operations:4 clones +4 swaps \u21928. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the formula is:\n\nclones = (ceil(n/m) -1)\n\nswaps = n - m \n\ntotal = clones + swaps \n\nBut how to compute ceil(n/m) in Python? \n\nceil(n/m) can be written as (n + m -1) // m \n\nSo clones = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 \n\nThen total = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) \n\nSimplify:\n\ntotal = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) \n\n= ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 + n -m \n\nBut let's see:\n\nLet me compute for the first example where m=2, n=6:\n\n(6+2-1)//2 \u21927//2=3 \u21923-1=2 \u2192 clones 2. \n\nswaps 6-2=4 \u2192 total 6. \n\nAnother example where m=1, n=5:\n\n(5+1-1)//1 \u21925 \u21925-1=4 \u2192 clones 4. \n\nswaps 5-1=4 \u2192 total 8. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nNow, the code for program2.py needs to compute this. \n\nThe current code is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nWait, the code is iterating over the input lines. The first line is the number of test cases, then each test case has two lines: the n and the array. \n\nThe code is using [2::2], which might be incorrect. \n\nWait, the input format for program2.py is:\n\nThe first line is t. \n\nThen for each test case:\n\n- a line with n \n\n- a line with the array elements. \n\nSo the input is read as a list of lines. \n\nThe code is using [2::2], which would take every second line starting from index 2. \n\nFor example, if the input is:\n\n3\n\n3\n\n0 1 2 \n\n2 \n\n3 3 \n\n4 \n\n1 2 3 4 \n\nThen the lines are [ '3', '3', '0 1 2', '2', '3 3', '4', '1 2 3 4' ]\n\nThe [2::2] would take elements at indices 2,4,6 \u2192 '0 1 2', '3 3', '1 2 3 4' \u2192 which are the array lines. \n\nBut the code is processing each array line as 'a', then splitting it into a list. \n\nThe code's first line is:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\nSo 'a' is the array's elements as a string. \n\nThen n is computed as len(a.split()), but the code does a:=a.split() \u2192 so a is now the list of elements. \n\nThen m is the max frequency. \n\nThe code then has a while loop that runs while m <n, but the loop does nothing except increment r? \n\nThe current code's logic is incomplete. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the required clones and swaps as per the formula. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n and the array. \n\n    count the frequency of each element. \n\n    m = max frequency. \n\n    if m >=n: \n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        clones = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 \n\n        swaps = n - m \n\n        total = clones + swaps \n\n        print(total)\n\nSo the code for program2.py should be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n\n    if m >=n:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        clones = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\n        swaps = n - m \n\n        print(clones + swaps)\n\nBut the current code is using a different structure. \n\nThe original code for program2.py is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThe problem is that the code is not properly reading the input. \n\nThe first line is the number of test cases. \n\nThe code is taking every second line starting from the third line (index 2), which are the array lines. \n\nBut the 'n' for each test case is the first line of the test case. \n\nThe current code is not reading the 'n' for each test case. \n\nThe code is taking 'a' as the array string, then splitting it into elements, and the 'n' is computed as the length of that list. \n\nBut that's correct because the array's length is n. \n\nHowever, the code is missing the part where it computes the required clones and swaps. \n\nThe code currently has a while loop that runs while m <n, but the loop does nothing except increment r? \n\nThe correct code should compute the formula and set r to the total. \n\nSo the missing code in the while loop is:\n\nr = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m)\n\nBut the while loop is unnecessary. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute it directly. \n\nThe correct code for the program2.py would be:\n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    arr = a.split()\n    n = len(arr)\n    cnt = Counter(arr)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        clones = (n + m -1) // m -1\n        swaps = n - m\n        print(clones + swaps)\n\nBut the original code has:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nSo the missing code is to compute the formula and set r to the total. \n\nThe while loop is not needed. \n\nThe correct code would replace the while loop with the calculation. \n\nSo the missing code is to replace the while loop with:\n\nclones = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\nswaps = n - m \n\nr = clones + swaps \n\nThen print(r). \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        clones = (n + m -1) // m -1\n        swaps = n - m\n        print(clones + swaps)\n\nBut the original code has the line:\n\nn=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\nWhich uses the walrus operator to split a into a list. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        clones = (n + m -1) // m -1\n        swaps = n - m\n        print(clones + swaps)\n\nBut the original code's structure uses a single line for the first part. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\n\nSo the missing code in the original program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation. \n\nThe original code has:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code is to compute the formula and set r to the value. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be rewritten without the while loop. \n\nThe correct code for program2.py is to compute the formula and print it. \n\nThus, the missing code in program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation. \n\nThe original code's line after the for loop is:\n\nn=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\nThen the while loop is:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code inside the while loop is not needed. \n\nThe correct code would be to compute the required value and print it. \n\nSo the missing code is to replace the while loop with the calculation. \n\nThe code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation. \n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is to compute the formula and print it, instead of the while loop. \n\nThe original code's TODO is inside the while loop, which is unnecessary. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for program2.py is to remove the while loop and compute the formula directly. \n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation. \n\nThe code should be:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to replace the while loop with the formula calculation. \n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is to call solve() in the main loop. \n\nThe original code's main part has:\n\nelse:\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    assert not tokens\n\nThe missing code is to call solve() inside the loop. \n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nelse:\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\n        solve()\n    assert not tokens\n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is to replace the TODO with solve().\n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is to call solve() in the loop. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is to compute the formula and print it, removing the while loop. \n\nThus, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"solve()\",\n  \"program2\": \"    if m >=n:\\n        print(0)\\n    else:\\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\"\n}\n\nWait, but the original code for program2 has:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThe correct code would replace the while loop and the print(r) with the formula. \n\nThe correct code would be:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n -

m) )\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the while loop and the print(r) with the if-else block. \n\nThe original code's line after the for loop is:\n\nn=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\nThen the while loop is:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code inside the while loop is not needed. \n\nThe correct code would replace the while loop and the print(r) with the if-else block. \n\nSo the missing code for program2 is to replace the while loop and the print(r) with the following:\n\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\n\nThus, the JSON entries are:\n\nprogram1's missing code is \"solve()\"\n\nprogram2's missing code is the code block replacing the while loop and print(r):\n\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\n\nBut the code must be written in the correct indentation. \n\nThe original code for program2 has:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThe correct code would replace the while loop and the print(r) with the if-else block. \n\nSo the code after the for loop would be:\n\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\n\nBut the original code uses a walrus operator. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) )\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the entire block after the for loop, replacing the existing lines. \n\nBut the problem states to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe original code has:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThe missing code is to replace the while loop and the print(r) with the if-else block. \n\nSo the code after the for loop should be:\n\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print( ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n -
