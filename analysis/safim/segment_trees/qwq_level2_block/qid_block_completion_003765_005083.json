The constraints are quite tight, so the solution must be efficient. Hmm, the code provided seems to have some parts missing. Let me read through the code to see where the gaps are. The first missing part is in the modpow function. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" in the loop where y is being processed. The modpow function is supposed to compute a^b mod m. The standard approach is to multiply res by x when the current bit is set. So the missing line there should be res = (res * x) % m. That's straightforward. Another part is the di dictionary. The code initializes it by iterating over psum, which is the prefix sums of the D array except the last element. Wait, the psum array is built with psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i], but the loop for psum starts from i=0 to n-2? Wait, the code for psum is:\n\npsum = [0] * n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i] Wait, that's a problem.",

Wait, no, the initial psum is all zeros. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the loop is for i in range(n-1). So for i from 0 to n-2. The first iteration is i=0. Then psum[0] = psum[-1] (since i-1 is -1 when i=0) + a[0]. But initially, psum is all zeros, so psum[-1] is 0. So psum[0] becomes a[0]. Then for i=1, psum[1] = psum[0] + a[1], which is correct. So the psum array is the prefix sums up to each lamp except the last one. But the problem says the arcs between lamp N and 1 is D_N. So the total circumference is sum(D_i) for all i. The code then checks for each i in psum whether i + s/2 is in di. Wait, s is the sum of all D_i. So s/2 is half the circumference.",

But given that the code is provided as is, perhaps the problem is in the way the code is handling the positions. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct in some way. Let me think again. The code's psum array is built as follows:\n\nInitially, psum is [0] * n. Then for i in 0 to n-2 (since the loop is for i in range(n-1)), psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]. Wait, for i=0, psum[0] = psum[-1] (which is 0) + a[0]. Then for i=1, psum[1] = psum[0] + a[1]. Continuing up to i = n-2, which is the second to last index. The last element (psum[n-1]) remains 0. Wait, that's a problem. Because the loop only runs for n-1 iterations (indices 0 to n-2), so the last element (index n-1) is not set. Therefore, the psum array is not properly filled. The correct way to compute the prefix sums would be to start with 0, then add each D_i. Wait, perhaps the code should be:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\ncurrent = 0 \n\npsum[0] = 0 \n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    current += a[i-1]\n\n    psum[i] = current \n\nWait, that way, psum[i] is the position of lamp i+1? Wait, lamp 1 is at position 0 (psum[0]), lamp 2 at psum[1], etc. Then the positions array is psum. Then, the total circumference is psum[-1] + a[-1]. So s = psum[-1] + a[-1]. Therefore, the code's current psum is not properly built. Hence, the code's psum array is incorrect. This is a major issue.",

But the code's psum array is missing the position 0 (lamp1's position), so it's not counting pairs involving lamp1. Hence, the code's count is incorrect. To fix this, the code must include all positions, including 0. So the first step is to correct the psum array. Let me try to adjust the code's psum array. The code currently has:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nThis is incorrect because for i=0, psum[i-1] is psum[-1], which is 0. But the first element (psum[0]) is set to a[0], which is correct. However, the loop only runs for n-1 elements, so the last element (psum[n-1]) is not set. Wait, the loop runs for i from 0 to n-2 (since range(n-1) is 0-based). Thus, the psum array after the loop has:\n\npsum[0] = a[0]\n\npsum[1] = a[0] + a[1]\n\n...\n\npsum[n-2] = sum(a[0] to a[n-2])\n\npsum[n-1] remains 0. This is incorrect. The correct way to compute the positions is to have psum[0] =0 (position of lamp1), then psum[1] = D_1 (position of lamp2), psum[2] = D_1 + D_2 (lamp3), etc. Wait, the positions array should be:\n\npositions[0] =0 \n\npositions[1] = D_1 \n\npositions[2] = D_1 + D_2 \n\n... positions[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} D_k \n\npositions[N-1] = sum_{k=1 to N-1} D_k So the code's psum array should be of length N, where psum[0] =0, psum[1] = a[0], psum[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Thus, the code should be:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\ncurrent =0 \n\npsum[0] =0 \n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    current += a[i-1]\n\n    psum[i] = current \n\nThis way, psum[i] is the position of lamp (i+1) ? No, lamp 1 is at position 0 (psum[0]), lamp2 at psum[1], etc. Yes. So the code's current psum is incorrect. Therefore, the first correction is to fix the psum array. The code's current psum loop is wrong. So in program1.py, the code for psum should be:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\ncurrent =0 \n\npsum[0] =0 \n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    current += a[i-1]\n\n    psum[i] = current \n\nWait, but the code's current loop is:\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i] This is not the same. So the first missing part in program1.py is the correct computation of psum. But the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. Looking back at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\npsum = [0] * n\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nThis is incorrect. The correct loop should be:\n\npsum[0] =0 \n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i-1] So the code's loop is off by one. The current loop is for i in range(n-1) (0-based up to n-2), and psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]. This would set psum[0] = a[0], psum[1] = a[0]+a[1], etc. But the first element (psum[0]) is correct (position of lamp2?), but the positions array should start with 0 for lamp1. Hence, the code's psum array is missing the 0 for lamp1. Therefore, the correct psum array should be initialized with psum[0] =0, and then for i from 1 to n-1:\n\npsum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThus, the code's loop for psum is incorrect. But since the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines, perhaps the code's psum loop is correct but there's another error. Alternatively, perhaps the code's psum is correct but the di dictionary is missing the 0.",

Hence, the code's di dictionary does not include 0. Therefore, the code should also include 0 in the di dictionary. So the code should first add 0 to the di. Hence, the code's di initialization should be:\n\ndi = {0:0}\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    di[i] =0 \n\nWait, but the code's current code is:\n\ndi = {}\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    di[i] =0 So the code is missing the 0. Therefore, the first correction is to add 0 to the di. So the code should have:\n\ndi = {0:0}\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    di[i] =0 But the code's current code does not have this. Alternatively, the code should first add 0 to the psum array. Alternatively, the code's psum array should include 0. This is getting too involved. Perhaps the code's current approach is to compute the pairs correctly, but the count is wrong. The code's count is computed as follows:\n\ncount =0 \n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    if (i + s/2) in di:\n\n        count +=1 But since the psum array does not include 0, pairs involving lamp1 are not counted.

So the inv function should be:\n\ndef inv(x):\n\n    return modpow(x, MOD-2, MOD) Hence, that's the missing code for program2.py. The other part is the code's logic. The code's current approach seems to be using combinatorics with factorials and inversions. The code's variables and loops are a bit unclear, but the missing part is the inv function. Hence, the missing code for program2 is the inv function. Putting it all together, the answers are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe missing lines are: In modpow function:\n\nres = (res * x) % m \n\nAfter the for loop that computes count:\n\ncount = count // 2 \n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe inv function is filled with return modpow(x, MOD-2, MOD). Hence, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"res = (res * x) % m\\n    count = count // 2\",\n    \"program2\": \"return modpow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n} Wait, but the code for program1's count division must be placed after the for loop that increments count. The code's current count loop is:\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    if i + s/2 in di:\n\n        count +=1 \n\nAfter this loop, the code should have count = count //2 Hence, the missing line is count = count //2 The modpow's missing line is the res *=x part. So the program1's missing code is the two lines: the res line and the count division. The program2's missing code is the inv function's return statement. Hence, the JSON should be as above. But the user's instruction says to output the missing code as strings. The program1's missing code for modpow is the line inside the if (y&1) block: \n\nres = (res * x) % m \n\nThen, after the for loop over psum, the line count = count //2 \n\nHence, the program1's completion is those two lines. The program2's completion is the inv function's return statement. So the final answer is as above.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nLooking at the problem statement for program1, the task is to count the number of valid colorings of the lamps such that no three lamps forming a right triangle have the same color. The constraints are quite tight, so the solution must be efficient.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some parts missing. Let me read through the code to see where the gaps are. The first missing part is in the modpow function. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" in the loop where y is being processed. The modpow function is supposed to compute a^b mod m. The standard approach is to multiply res by x when the current bit is set. So the missing line there should be res = (res * x) % m. That's straightforward.\n\nAnother part is the di dictionary. The code initializes it by iterating over psum, which is the prefix sums of the D array except the last element. Wait, the psum array is built with psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i], but the loop for psum starts from i=0 to n-2? Wait, the code for psum is:\n\npsum = [0] * n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because for i starting at 0, the first iteration would use psum[-1], which is the last element of the array (since Python uses negative indices). Wait, no, the initial psum is all zeros. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the loop is for i in range(n-1). So for i from 0 to n-2. The first iteration is i=0. Then psum[0] = psum[-1] (since i-1 is -1 when i=0) + a[0]. But initially, psum is all zeros, so psum[-1] is 0. So psum[0] becomes a[0]. Then for i=1, psum[1] = psum[0] + a[1], which is correct. So the psum array is the prefix sums up to each lamp except the last one. But the problem says the arcs between lamp N and 1 is D_N. So the total circumference is sum(D_i) for all i.\n\nThe code then checks for each i in psum whether i + s/2 is in di. Wait, s is the sum of all D_i. So s/2 is half the circumference. For a right-angled triangle on a circle, the three points must form a right angle, which by Thales' theorem requires that one of the sides is a diameter. So three points A, B, C form a right triangle if one of the arcs between two of them is a semicircle (i.e., length s/2). So for three points to form a right triangle, one of the arcs between two must be exactly s/2. Wait, actually, the right angle is at the point opposite the diameter. So for three points to form a right triangle, one of the arcs between two of them must be exactly half the circumference. So the three points must have one pair separated by exactly s/2.\n\nWait, the problem states that three lamps form a right triangle if one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees. So according to Thales' theorem, the hypotenuse must be a diameter. So for three points A, B, C, if the arc between A and B is exactly half the circumference, then angle at C would be 90 degrees. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the circle's circumference. The three points form a right triangle if one of the arcs between two of them is exactly half the circumference. Because then the third point forms a right angle. So the condition is that there exists two points among the three that are separated by exactly s/2. \n\nTherefore, the forbidden condition is that there are three lamps with the same color, and two of them are separated by exactly s/2. So the problem reduces to ensuring that for any pair of lamps separated by exactly s/2, they cannot have the same color as any third lamp. Wait, no, the problem says that there cannot be three lamps with the same color forming a right triangle. So if three lamps have the same color and form a right triangle, that's invalid. So the forbidden case is when three lamps with the same color form a right triangle. \n\nTherefore, the approach is to find all pairs of lamps that are separated by exactly s/2. Let's call such pairs \"diametrically opposite\". For each such pair (i,j), if they are separated by exactly s/2, then any third lamp k must not have the same color as both i and j. Wait, no, the problem says that all three must have the same color. So if two lamps are diametrically opposite, then any third lamp that forms a triangle with them (i.e., the three form a right triangle) must not have the same color as them. Wait, actually, if two lamps are separated by s/2, then any third lamp forms a right triangle with them. Because the angle at the third lamp would be 90 degrees. So for any three lamps where two are diametrically opposite, the third forms a right triangle with them. Therefore, if two lamps are diametrically opposite and have the same color, then any third lamp with the same color would form an invalid trio. \n\nWait, the problem states that three lamps with the same color forming a right triangle are forbidden. So if two lamps are diametrically opposite (distance s/2 apart), then any third lamp forms a right triangle with them. So if those two have the same color, then any third lamp with the same color would create an invalid trio. Therefore, the two diametrically opposite lamps must not have the same color as any other lamp. Wait, no, the problem allows two lamps to have the same color as long as there isn't a third one forming a right triangle with them. Wait, the problem says that there cannot exist three lamps with the same color forming a right triangle. So if two lamps are diametrically opposite and have the same color, then any third lamp with the same color would form a trio that is invalid. Therefore, the two diametrically opposite lamps must not have the same color as any other lamp. Wait, but that's too strict. Alternatively, perhaps the two diametrically opposite lamps can have the same color, but then no other lamp can have that color. Because otherwise, the third lamp would form a trio with them. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that for any three lamps with the same color, they do not form a right triangle. So if two lamps are diametrically opposite and have the same color, then any third lamp with the same color would form a trio that is invalid. Therefore, the two diametrically opposite lamps must not have the same color as any other lamp. So, for any pair of diametrically opposite lamps (i,j), they must be colored differently from each other, or if they are the same, then no other lamp can have that color. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to model the constraints properly. Let me think of the problem in terms of pairs of diametrically opposite lamps. Let's say that for each such pair (i,j), they can either be colored the same or different. But if they are the same, then no other lamp can have that color. Because otherwise, the third lamp would form a trio with them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: the color of any pair of diametrically opposite lamps must be unique, or they must not have any other lamp with the same color. \n\nAlternatively, the forbidden condition is that there exists three lamps with the same color where two of them are diametrically opposite. Because then the third forms a right triangle with them. So the problem reduces to ensuring that for any pair of diametrically opposite lamps, they cannot have the same color as any other lamp. \n\nWait, let's think of it this way: suppose two lamps i and j are diametrically opposite. If they are colored the same color c, then no other lamp can be color c. Because otherwise, that third lamp would form a trio with i and j, which is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, if two diametrically opposite lamps are colored the same, then that color can't be used anywhere else. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nLet the set of diametrically opposite pairs be S. Each such pair (i,j) must either be colored differently, or if they are the same, then that color is not used elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, the constraints are that for any pair (i,j) in S, if they are the same color, then that color must be unique to them. \n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Maybe the approach is to first find all the diametrically opposite pairs. Let's call these pairs (i, j) where the arc between them is exactly s/2. \n\nThe first step is to compute all such pairs. \n\nThe code in program1.py is trying to do this. Let's see:\n\nThe code has a psum array which is the prefix sum of the D array except the last element. Wait, the D array is given as D_1 to D_N, so the total circumference is sum(D_i). The psum array is the cumulative sum up to each lamp except the last. \n\nWait, the code's psum is built as follows:\n\na is the list of D_i. \n\npsum is initialized to [0]*n. \n\nThen for i in range(n-1):\n\npsum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nWait, but for i=0, psum[0] = psum[-1] (since i-1 is -1) + a[0]. Since psum was initialized to all 0, psum[-1] is 0. So psum[0] = a[0]. \n\nThen for i=1, psum[1] = psum[0] + a[1], which is correct. \n\nSo psum[i] is the sum of D_1 to D_i. \n\nWait, the circumference is s = sum(a). \n\nThe distance between lamp 1 and lamp k is psum[k-1]. \n\nThe distance between lamp k and lamp 1 is s - psum[k-1]. \n\nWait, the distance between lamp i and lamp j (i < j) is psum[j-1] - psum[i-1], but if j is after i. \n\nAlternatively, the distance between lamp i and lamp j can be the minimum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise arcs. But in the problem, the right angle condition requires that the three points form a right triangle, which by Thales' theorem requires that one of the sides is a diameter. So the arc between two of them must be exactly s/2. \n\nTherefore, for two lamps i and j to be diametrically opposite, the distance between them must be exactly s/2. \n\nSo for each lamp i, we can compute the position along the circumference. Let's say the position of lamp i is the cumulative distance from lamp 1 to lamp i. \n\nThe position array can be computed as pos[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} D_k. \n\nWait, but the code's psum array is exactly that. So psum[i] is the position of lamp i+1? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the code's a is the list of D_1 to D_N. \n\npsum[0] = a[0], which is D_1. \n\npsum[1] = a[0] + a[1], which is D_1 + D_2. \n\nSo psum[i] is the sum of the first i+1 D's. Wait, no, for i from 0 to n-2. Because the loop runs for i in range(n-1). So for n lamps, the psum array has n elements, but the last element (psum[n-1]) is not set? Wait, no, the loop runs for i from 0 to n-2 (since range(n-1) is 0-based). So the last index set is i = n-2. So psum[n-1] remains 0. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because the code's psum array is not properly filled. Wait, the code's psum is initialized as [0]*n. Then for i in range(n-1), which is 0 to n-2, the code sets psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]. \n\nWait, for i=0, psum[0] = psum[-1] (which is 0) + a[0]. So that's correct. \n\nFor i=1, psum[1] = psum[0] + a[1]. \n\nContinuing up to i = n-2, which is the second to last element. \n\nThe last element (psum[n-1]) is not set, so it remains 0. \n\nBut the total circumference is s = sum(a) = psum[n-2] + a[n-1]. \n\nWait, because the D_N is the arc between lamp N and 1. So the total sum is sum(D_i) = sum(a) = psum[n-2] + a[n-1]. \n\nHmm, so the code's psum array is not capturing the full positions. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the positions of the lamps except the last one? Not sure. \n\nThe code then creates a dictionary di, which is initialized with all the psum values. \n\nThen, for each i in psum, it checks if (i + s/2) is in di. \n\nWait, s is the total sum. So s/2 is half the circumference. \n\nThe idea is that for a position i, if there exists another position j such that the distance between them is exactly s/2, then they form a diametrically opposite pair. \n\nSo for a lamp at position i, the opposite position would be i + s/2. \n\nBut since the circumference is s, the opposite could also be i - s/2, but modulo s. \n\nWait, the distance between two points can be in either direction. So the absolute difference between their positions must be exactly s/2. \n\nTherefore, for a position x, the opposite position is x + s/2 mod s. \n\nBut since the positions are cumulative, perhaps the code is trying to find for each position x in psum, whether x + s/2 is also a position in the array. \n\nWait, but the code is using the psum array which is the positions up to lamp n-1. Because the last lamp's position would be s - D_N? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering all possible pairs of lamps and checking if their distance is exactly s/2. \n\nBut the code's approach is to collect all the positions in the psum array (excluding the last lamp?), then for each position x in psum, check if x + s/2 is also present in the positions. \n\nWait, but the last lamp's position is s - D_N? Or maybe the code is missing the last lamp's position. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect here. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that for any three lamps forming a right triangle, they must not all have the same color. \n\nThe key is to find all pairs of lamps that are diametrically opposite (distance s/2 apart). Each such pair (i,j) must not have the same color as any other lamp. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nLet the set of diametrically opposite pairs be S. Each such pair (i,j) must either be colored differently, or if they are the same color, that color must not be used anywhere else. \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid colorings is equal to the product over all pairs in S of the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as follows: \n\nEach diametrically opposite pair (i,j) can be considered as a \"group\". The color of i and j must either be different, or if they are the same, that color cannot be used elsewhere. \n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the problem can be approached by first counting the number of diametrically opposite pairs. Let's call the number of such pairs as count. \n\nWait, in the code, the variable count is being incremented when for a position x in psum, x + s/2 is present in the di dictionary. \n\nWait, the code does:\n\ndi is initialized with all the psum values. \n\nThen for each i in psum:\n\nif (i + s/2) is in di, then count +=1. \n\nWait, but s is the total sum. So s/2 must be an integer? Because otherwise, there can't be any diametrically opposite pairs. \n\nWait, the problem allows D_i to be any integer, so s could be even or odd. \n\nWait, but if s is odd, then s/2 is not an integer, so there are no diametrically opposite pairs. \n\nTherefore, the first thing to check is whether s is even. If it's odd, then there are no such pairs, so the answer is M^N mod 998244353. \n\nBut in the code, the variable count is being computed as the number of such pairs. \n\nWait, but the code's approach may have some errors. Let me see:\n\nThe code first computes s = sum(a). \n\nThen psum is the prefix sums up to each lamp except the last. \n\nWait, the last lamp's position would be s - D_N? Or perhaps the code is missing the last lamp's position. \n\nWait, the positions of the lamps are as follows: \n\nThe first lamp is at position 0 (assuming starting point). \n\nThe second lamp is at D_1. \n\nThird at D_1 + D_2, etc. \n\nThe Nth lamp is at sum(D_1 to D_{N-1}), and the arc from N to 1 is D_N. \n\nSo the total circumference is s = sum(D_i). \n\nThe position of lamp k (1-based) is the sum of D_1 to D_{k-1}. \n\nWait, for lamp 1, the position is 0. \n\nLamp 2: D_1. \n\nLamp 3: D_1 + D_2. \n\n... \n\nLamp N: sum_{i=1 to N-1} D_i. \n\nThe distance between lamp N and 1 is D_N, so the total circumference is indeed s = sum(D_i). \n\nTherefore, the positions of the lamps are 0, D_1, D_1+D_2, ..., sum_{i=1}^{N-1} D_i. \n\nThe code's psum array is storing the positions of the lamps except the first one? \n\nWait, the code's a is the list of D_1 to D_N. \n\nThe psum array is initialized as [0]*n. \n\nThen for i in 0 to n-2 (since the loop runs for range(n-1)), psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]. \n\nWait, when i=0, psum[0] = psum[-1] (which is 0) + a[0] \u2192 a[0] = D_1. \n\nSo psum[0] is the position of lamp 2 (since lamp 1 is at 0, lamp 2 is at D_1). \n\npsum[1] is D_1 + D_2 \u2192 position of lamp 3. \n\nContinuing up to psum[n-2], which is the position of lamp n. \n\nThe position of lamp 1 is 0, which is not in the psum array. \n\nTherefore, the psum array contains the positions of lamps 2 to N. \n\nThe code's di dictionary is initialized with all the psum values. \n\nThen, for each x in psum (positions of lamps 2 to N), it checks if x + s/2 is in di. \n\nWait, but lamp 1's position (0) is not in the psum array. So the code is missing checking for pairs involving lamp 1. \n\nFor example, if lamp 1's position (0) plus s/2 is present in the psum array, then that would form a pair with lamp 1 and another lamp. \n\nTherefore, the code is incorrect here. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The code's current approach is not considering the position of lamp 1 (0) in the di dictionary. \n\nSo the correct approach would be to include all positions of all lamps. \n\nThe positions are 0 (lamp 1), D_1 (lamp 2), D_1+D_2 (lamp3), ..., sum_{i=1}^{N-1} D_i (lamp N). \n\nTherefore, the psum array should include all these positions. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should have the psum array start with 0 (position of lamp 1), then add each D_i. \n\nWait, let me think of a better way to compute the positions. \n\nLet me re-calculate the psum array properly. \n\nThe positions array (pos) should be of length n, where pos[0] = 0 (lamp 1's position), pos[1] = D_1 (lamp 2's position), pos[2] = D_1 + D_2 (lamp3's position), ..., pos[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} D_k for i from 1 to N-1. \n\npos[N-1] is the position of lamp N. \n\nSo the code's current psum array is storing pos[1] to pos[N-1], but not pos[0]. \n\nTherefore, the code's di dictionary is missing the position 0. \n\nHence, the code is not considering pairs where one of the lamps is lamp 1. \n\nTo fix this, the psum array should include all positions, including 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should be adjusted as follows:\n\nInitialize psum as [0], then for each i from 0 to n-1, add a[i] to the previous sum. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\npos[0] = 0 \n\npos[1] = D_1 \n\npos[2] = D_1 + D_2 \n\n... \n\npos[i] = pos[i-1] + D_i \n\nWait, but the D array is given as D_1 to D_N. \n\nWait, the code's a is the list of D_1 to D_N. \n\nSo the correct way to compute the positions is:\n\npos = [0]*(n)\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    pos[i] = pos[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nWait, because for lamp 2 (index 1 in pos), the position is D_1 (a[0]). \n\nLamp 3 (index 2) is D_1 + D_2 (a[0] + a[1]). \n\nSo the positions array is built as pos[0] =0, pos[1] = a[0], pos[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. \n\nThen, the total circumference is pos[-1] + a[-1] (since the last D_N is the arc from N to 1). \n\nWait, pos[N-1] is the position of lamp N, and the arc from N to 1 is D_N. So the total circumference is pos[N-1] + D_N = sum(a). \n\nTherefore, the code's current psum array is not capturing the position of lamp 1 (0). \n\nHence, the code's di dictionary is missing that. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nTo fix this, the psum array should be the positions array including 0. \n\nSo the code's psum array should be built as follows:\n\npsum = [0]\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    psum.append(psum[-1] + a[i])\n\nWait, but the code's current psum is of length n, but perhaps it's better to re-calculate. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be adjusted to include the 0 in the psum array. \n\nBut given the current code's structure, perhaps the code's psum is not properly built. \n\nThis is a critical error. \n\nAssuming that the code's psum is missing the 0, then the count variable is undercounting the number of diametrically opposite pairs. \n\nTherefore, the first step is to fix the psum array. \n\nBut given that the code is provided as is, perhaps the problem is in the way the code is handling the positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct in some way. Let me think again. \n\nThe code's psum array is built as follows:\n\nInitially, psum is [0] * n. \n\nThen for i in 0 to n-2 (since the loop is for i in range(n-1)), psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]. \n\nWait, for i=0, psum[0] = psum[-1] (which is 0) + a[0]. \n\nThen for i=1, psum[1] = psum[0] + a[1]. \n\nContinuing up to i = n-2, which is the second to last index. \n\nThe last element (psum[n-1]) remains 0. \n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the loop only runs for n-1 iterations (indices 0 to n-2), so the last element (index n-1) is not set. \n\nTherefore, the psum array is not properly filled. \n\nThe correct way to compute the prefix sums would be to start with 0, then add each D_i. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\ncurrent = 0 \n\npsum[0] = 0 \n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    current += a[i-1]\n\n    psum[i] = current \n\nWait, that way, psum[i] is the position of lamp i+1? \n\nWait, lamp 1 is at position 0 (psum[0]), lamp 2 at psum[1], etc. \n\nThen the positions array is psum. \n\nThen, the total circumference is psum[-1] + a[-1]. \n\nSo s = psum[-1] + a[-1]. \n\nTherefore, the code's current psum is not properly built. \n\nHence, the code's psum array is incorrect. \n\nThis is a major issue. \n\nTherefore, the first step to fix program1.py is to correctly compute the positions of all lamps. \n\nBut given that the code is provided as is, perhaps the code's psum is not properly built, leading to errors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the positions of the lamps except the first one, but that's not correct. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires that no three lamps with the same color form a right triangle. \n\nThe right triangle condition requires that two of the three lamps are diametrically opposite. \n\nTherefore, the forbidden case is when three lamps have the same color and two of them are diametrically opposite. \n\nHence, the constraints are that for any pair of diametrically opposite lamps (i,j), they cannot have the same color as any other lamp. \n\nWait, no. Because if two diametrically opposite lamps are colored the same, then any third lamp with that color would form an invalid trio. \n\nTherefore, if two diametrically opposite lamps are colored the same, then that color must not be used anywhere else. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nLet the set of diametrically opposite pairs be S. \n\nEach such pair (i,j) can either be colored differently, or if they are the same color, that color must be unique to them. \n\nThe total number of colorings is the product over all pairs in S of the possible choices, considering these constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nLet the number of diametrically opposite pairs be count. \n\nEach such pair can be considered as a \"group\". \n\nThe color of the pair must either be different, or if the same, then that color is not used elsewhere. \n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps the solution is to model it as follows: \n\nThe total number of valid colorings is M^N minus the invalid ones. But that might not be feasible for large N. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering that each diametrically opposite pair must not have the same color as any other lamp. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that any two diametrically opposite lamps cannot share a color with any other lamp. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as: \n\nFor any pair of diametrically opposite lamps (i,j), if they are colored the same, then that color must be used only on them. \n\nTherefore, the color of such a pair can be chosen in M ways, and then the remaining lamps must be colored with the remaining M-1 colors, but ensuring that no other pair of diametrically opposite lamps are using those colors. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nLet the number of diametrically opposite pairs be count. \n\nEach such pair can be considered as a \"group\". \n\nThe color of each group can be chosen in M ways, but if two groups are chosen to have the same color, then that color must not be used elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled using inclusion-exclusion, but that might be too slow. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as follows: \n\nThe forbidden condition is that there exists a color c and a pair of diametrically opposite lamps (i,j) such that both i and j are colored c, and there exists another lamp k also colored c. \n\nTherefore, the valid colorings are those where for every color c, either: \n\n- The color c is not used on any diametrically opposite pair, or \n\n- The color c is used on exactly one diametrically opposite pair, and no other lamps have that color. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled by first choosing for each diametrically opposite pair whether to color them with a unique color or not. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nLet the set of diametrically opposite pairs be S. \n\nEach pair in S can be colored in two ways: \n\nEither they are colored with different colors, or they are colored with the same color, which must not be used elsewhere. \n\nThe total number of colorings is the product over all pairs in S of the possible choices, multiplied by the colorings of the remaining lamps. \n\nWait, but this is not straightforward because the pairs are not independent. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as follows: \n\nLet the number of diametrically opposite pairs be count. \n\nEach such pair can be treated as a \"node\" that must be colored in a way that their color is either unique or not conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as follows: \n\nThe total number of valid colorings is equal to the sum over k from 0 to count of the number of ways to choose k pairs to be monochromatic (same color), and the remaining pairs are colored with different colors, and the rest of the lamps are colored with colors not used in those k pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps this is the way to go. \n\nLet me think of it this way: \n\nSuppose there are count diametrically opposite pairs. \n\nWe can choose a subset of these pairs to be \"monochromatic\" (i.e., both lamps in the pair have the same color, and that color is not used elsewhere). \n\nFor each such subset of size k, the number of ways is: \n\n- Choose k pairs from the count pairs: C(count, k). \n\n- Assign a distinct color to each of these k pairs: P(M, k) (permutation, since each pair must have a unique color). \n\n- The remaining (count -k) pairs must be colored with different colors for each lamp in the pair. \n\nWait, no. For the remaining pairs (not chosen to be monochromatic), the two lamps in the pair must have different colors. \n\nAdditionally, the remaining lamps (those not in any pair?) Wait, no, all lamps are part of exactly one pair or not? \n\nWait, each lamp is part of at most one diametrically opposite pair. Because if a lamp is part of two pairs, then the circumference would have to be such that there are two different diameters, which is only possible if the circumference is a multiple of the distance between them. \n\nWait, but in general, each lamp can be in at most one diametrically opposite pair. \n\nWait, suppose the circumference is even. Then for each lamp i, there is exactly one lamp j such that the distance between them is s/2. So each lamp is in exactly one pair. \n\nHence, the total number of pairs is count = n/2 if n is even, but n must be even for that? \n\nWait, the problem allows N to be up to 3e5, which can be even or odd. \n\nWait, if the circumference s is even, then each lamp has exactly one diametrically opposite lamp. So the number of pairs is n/2 if n is even, but if n is odd, then s must be even? \n\nWait, no. For example, if N is 3 and the circumference is 6 (each D_i is 2), then each lamp's opposite would be 3 units away. So lamp 1's opposite is lamp 2 (distance 2+2?), no. Wait, let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose N=3, D1=2, D2=2, D3=2. The circumference is 6. \n\nThe positions are 0 (lamp1), 2 (lamp2), 4 (lamp3). \n\nThe distance between lamp1 and lamp2 is 2, between lamp2 and lamp3 is 2, and between lamp3 and lamp1 is 2. \n\nWait, the distance between lamp1 and lamp3 is 4 (clockwise) or 2 (counter-clockwise). \n\nWait, the minimal distance between lamp1 and lamp3 is 2 (the arc going the other way). \n\nSo the diametrically opposite pairs would be those separated by 3 units (s/2 = 3). \n\nSo lamp1's opposite would be at position 3. But there is no lamp at position 3. \n\nHence, in this case, there are no diametrically opposite pairs. \n\nHmm, so when s is even but N is odd, there can be no diametrically opposite pairs. \n\nTherefore, the number of diametrically opposite pairs is count = (number of lamps in pairs). \n\nEach pair consists of two lamps. \n\nSo the total number of pairs is count = (number of lamps in pairs)/2. \n\nThe code's current approach is to count the number of pairs by checking for each position x in psum whether x + s/2 is also present. \n\nBut the code's psum array is missing the position 0 (lamp1's position), so it's not counting pairs involving lamp1. \n\nHence, the code's count is incorrect. \n\nTo fix this, the code must include all positions, including 0. \n\nSo the first step is to correct the psum array. \n\nLet me try to adjust the code's psum array. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nThis is incorrect because for i=0, psum[i-1] is psum[-1], which is 0. \n\nBut the first element (psum[0]) is set to a[0], which is correct. \n\nHowever, the loop only runs for n-1 elements, so the last element (psum[n-1]) is not set. \n\nWait, the loop runs for i from 0 to n-2 (since range(n-1) is 0-based). \n\nThus, the psum array after the loop has:\n\npsum[0] = a[0]\n\npsum[1] = a[0] + a[1]\n\n...\n\npsum[n-2] = sum(a[0] to a[n-2])\n\npsum[n-1] remains 0. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct way to compute the positions is to have psum[0] =0 (position of lamp1), then psum[1] = D_1 (position of lamp2), psum[2] = D_1 + D_2 (lamp3), etc. \n\nWait, the positions array should be:\n\npositions[0] =0 \n\npositions[1] = D_1 \n\npositions[2] = D_1 + D_2 \n\n... \n\npositions[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} D_k \n\npositions[N-1] = sum_{k=1 to N-1} D_k \n\nSo the code's psum array should be of length N, where psum[0] =0, psum[1] = a[0], psum[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\ncurrent =0 \n\npsum[0] =0 \n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    current += a[i-1]\n\n    psum[i] = current \n\nThis way, psum[i] is the position of lamp (i+1) ? No, lamp 1 is at position 0 (psum[0]), lamp2 at psum[1], etc. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code's current psum is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the first correction is to fix the psum array. \n\nThe code's current psum loop is wrong. \n\nSo in program1.py, the code for psum should be:\n\npsum = [0] * n \n\ncurrent =0 \n\npsum[0] =0 \n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    current += a[i-1]\n\n    psum[i] = current \n\nWait, but the code's current loop is:\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nThis is not the same. \n\nSo the first missing part in program1.py is the correct computation of psum. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nLooking back at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\npsum = [0] * n\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct loop should be:\n\npsum[0] =0 \n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nSo the code's loop is off by one. \n\nThe current loop is for i in range(n-1) (0-based up to n-2), and psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]. \n\nThis would set psum[0] = a[0], psum[1] = a[0]+a[1], etc. \n\nBut the first element (psum[0]) is correct (position of lamp2?), but the positions array should start with 0 for lamp1. \n\nHence, the code's psum array is missing the 0 for lamp1. \n\nTherefore, the correct psum array should be initialized with psum[0] =0, and then for i from 1 to n-1:\n\npsum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThus, the code's loop for psum is incorrect. \n\nBut since the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines, perhaps the code's psum loop is correct but there's another error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's psum is correct but the di dictionary is missing the 0. \n\nThe code's di is initialized with all the psum values. \n\nBut the psum array as computed in the code includes the positions of lamps 2 to N (since psum[0] is a[0], which is the position of lamp2). \n\nThe position of lamp1 (0) is not in the psum array. \n\nHence, the code's di dictionary does not include 0. \n\nTherefore, the code should also include 0 in the di dictionary. \n\nSo the code should first add 0 to the di. \n\nHence, the code's di initialization should be:\n\ndi = {0:0}\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    di[i] =0 \n\nWait, but the code's current code is:\n\ndi = {}\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    di[i] =0 \n\nSo the code is missing the 0. \n\nTherefore, the first correction is to add 0 to the di. \n\nSo the code should have:\n\ndi = {0:0}\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    di[i] =0 \n\nBut the code's current code does not have this. \n\nAlternatively, the code should first add 0 to the psum array. \n\nAlternatively, the code's psum array should include 0. \n\nThis is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the code's current approach is to compute the pairs correctly, but the count is wrong. \n\nThe code's count is computed as follows:\n\ncount =0 \n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    if (i + s/2) in di:\n\n        count +=1 \n\nBut since the psum array does not include 0, pairs involving lamp1 are not counted. \n\nHence, the code's count is incorrect. \n\nTo fix this, the code should include 0 in the psum array. \n\nTherefore, the first missing part in program1.py is the correct computation of psum and including 0 in the di. \n\nBut since the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines, perhaps the code's missing part is in the modpow function. \n\nThe modpow function has a missing line in the loop where the current bit is set. \n\nThe modpow function is supposed to compute a^b mod m. \n\nThe loop is:\n\nwhile (y >0):\n\n    if (y &1):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    y = y >>1 \n\n    x = (x*x %m) %m \n\nThe missing line is res *=x, then mod. \n\nSo the line should be res = res *x %m \n\nHence, the missing line is res = (res * x) % m \n\nSo the modpow function's missing line is res = (res * x) % m \n\nThat's the first part. \n\nNow, the second part of program1.py's code: \n\nThe code then computes count as the number of pairs where x + s/2 is in di. \n\nBut since the psum array is missing the 0, the code is not counting pairs involving lamp1. \n\nHence, the code's count is wrong. \n\nTo fix this, the psum array must include the 0. \n\nBut how to adjust the code? \n\nThe code's psum is initialized as [0]*n, then for i in range(n-1):\n\npsum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]\n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct way is to have psum[0] =0, then for i from 1 to n-1:\n\npsum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nHence, the loop should be:\n\npsum[0] =0 \n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nBut in the current code, the loop is for i in range(n-1) (0-based up to n-2), and psum[i] = psum[i-1] + a[i]. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code's psum loop is wrong. \n\nBut since the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines, perhaps the code's missing part is the correct loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's psum is correct but the count is being computed incorrectly. \n\nThe code's count is computed by iterating over each x in psum and checking if x + s/2 is in di. \n\nBut since the psum array does not include 0, the code is missing pairs where one of the positions is 0. \n\nHence, the code should also include 0 in the psum array. \n\nTherefore, the code's psum array should be initialized with 0 as the first element, and then the loop should be adjusted. \n\nBut given that the user's instruction requires only the missing lines, perhaps the code's missing part is the modpow function's line and the psum loop's correction. \n\nBut since the user's code for program1.py has the psum loop as written, perhaps the problem is elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's count is being counted as the number of pairs, but each pair is counted twice. \n\nFor example, if x and y are a pair, then when x is processed, it increments count, and when y is processed, it also increments count. \n\nHence, the count variable is twice the actual number of pairs. \n\nTherefore, the count should be divided by 2. \n\nHence, after the loop, count = count //2 \n\nBut in the code's current code, count is not divided by 2. \n\nSo that's another error. \n\nTherefore, the code's count is twice the actual number of pairs. \n\nHence, after the for loop over psum, the code should do count = count //2 \n\nThis is another missing line. \n\nSo the code's current count is double the actual count. \n\nHence, the code's count variable is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the missing line after the for loop is count = count //2 \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing parts in program1.py are:\n\n1. In modpow function: the line res = (res * x) % m \n\n2. After the for loop that computes count, add count = count // 2 \n\n3. Also, the psum array is incorrect. But since the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines, perhaps the psum loop is correct and the problem is elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's psum is correct but the count is double. \n\nAssuming that the count is double, then dividing by 2 is needed. \n\nHence, the missing line after the for loop is count = count //2 \n\nNow, the code's ans is computed as follows:\n\nans =0 \n\nfor i in range(count+1):\n\n    ans += C(count,i) * P(m, count -i) * modpow(m - count +i, v, mod) * modpow(P(m - count +i, 2), i, mod) \n\nWait, the formula is a bit unclear. \n\nThe variables v is computed as v = n - 2*count \n\nWait, the code's v is n - 2*count. \n\nThe formula seems to be considering choosing i pairs to be monochromatic. \n\nFor each such choice, the number of ways is C(count, i) (choose i pairs to be monochromatic). \n\nFor those i pairs, each must be assigned a unique color. The number of ways is P(m, i) (permutation of m colors taken i at a time). \n\nThe remaining (count -i) pairs must be colored with different colors for each lamp. \n\nThe remaining lamps (those not in any pair?) \n\nWait, the total number of lamps is n. \n\nEach pair has two lamps, so the number of pairs is count. \n\nHence, the total number of lamps in pairs is 2*count. \n\nThe remaining lamps are n - 2*count, which is v. \n\nThese remaining lamps can be colored freely with any of the remaining colors. \n\nThe remaining colors available are m - i (since i colors are used for the monochromatic pairs). \n\nWait, the formula in the code is: \n\nThe term P(m, count -i) is probably the number of ways to choose colors for the non-monochromatic pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is as follows: \n\nFor the i monochromatic pairs, each uses a unique color (so P(m, i) ways). \n\nThe remaining (count -i) pairs must be colored with different colors for each lamp. \n\nFor each such pair, the two lamps can be colored in (m -i) * (m -i -1) ways? \n\nAlternatively, the remaining pairs must have different colors for the two lamps. \n\nThe remaining colors available are m -i (since i colors are used for the monochromatic pairs). \n\nFor each of the remaining (count -i) pairs, the two lamps can be colored in (m -i) * (m -i -1) ways. \n\nBut this would be (m -i) * (m -i -1) to the power of (count -i). \n\nBut the code's formula has modpow(m - count +i, v, mod) * modpow(P(m - count +i, 2), i, mod). \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the code's formula may have a different approach. \n\nThe code's current formula is:\n\nans += C(count,i) * P(m, count -i) * modpow(m - count +i, v, mod) * modpow(P(m - count +i, 2), i, mod) \n\nThis is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nThe total number of valid colorings is the sum over k of:\n\nC(count, k) * (m)_k * (m -k)^v * (m -k)^{count -k} * ... \n\nNot sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the missing parts are the modpow line and the count division by 2. \n\nSo for program1.py, the missing lines are:\n\nIn modpow function:\n\nres = (res * x) % m \n\nAfter the for loop that computes count:\n\ncount = count // 2 \n\nHence, the program1's missing code is:\n\nmodpow's missing line and the count division. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to compute for each vertex i in a tree with n vertices (n is odd), the number of trees where i is the centroid. \n\nThe centroid is a vertex whose removal splits the tree into subtrees each of size at most (n-1)/2. \n\nThe code provided has some missing parts. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe modmul function is defined, and there's a missing inv function. \n\nThe code has:\n\ndef inv(x):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe inv function is supposed to compute the modular inverse of x modulo MOD. \n\nThe standard way to compute the modular inverse when MOD is prime (which it is, 998244353 is a prime) is using Fermat's little theorem. \n\nThe inverse of x mod MOD is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD. \n\nHence, the inv function can be implemented using modpow. \n\nSo the inv function should be:\n\ndef inv(x):\n\n    return modpow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nHence, that's the missing code for program2.py. \n\nThe other part is the code's logic. \n\nThe code's current approach seems to be using combinatorics with factorials and inversions. \n\nThe code's variables and loops are a bit unclear, but the missing part is the inv function. \n\nHence, the missing code for program2 is the inv function. \n\nPutting it all together, the answers are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe missing lines are:\n\nIn modpow function:\n\nres = (res * x) % m \n\nAfter the for loop that computes count:\n\ncount = count // 2 \n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe inv function is filled with return modpow(x, MOD-2, MOD). \n\nHence, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"res = (res * x) % m\\n    count = count // 2\",\n    \"program2\": \"return modpow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nWait, but the code for program1's count division must be placed after the for loop that increments count. \n\nThe code's current count loop is:\n\nfor i in psum:\n\n    if i + s/2 in di:\n\n        count +=1 \n\nAfter this loop, the code should have count = count //2 \n\nHence, the missing line is count = count //2 \n\nThe modpow's missing line is the res *=x part. \n\nSo the program1's missing code is the two lines: the res line and the count division. \n\nThe program2's missing code is the inv function's return statement. \n\nHence, the JSON should be as above. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output the missing code as strings. \n\nThe program1's missing code for modpow is the line inside the if (y&1) block: \n\nres = (res * x) % m \n\nThen, after the for loop over psum, the line count = count //2 \n\nHence, the program1's completion is those two lines. \n\nThe program2's completion is the inv function's return statement. \n\nSo the final answer is as above."
