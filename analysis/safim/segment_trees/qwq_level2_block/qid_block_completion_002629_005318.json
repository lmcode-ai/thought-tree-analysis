Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the sum formula. Let me re-calculate the total change for operation 1:\n\nThe operation 1 on positions i and j (1-based indices between 2 and m-1):\n\n- c[i] -=1 \u2192 contribution to sum: -i (since the element is at position i, so multiplied by i)\n- c[j] -=1 \u2192 contribution: -j\n- c[i-1] +=1 \u2192 contribution: + (i-1)\n- c[j+1] +=1 \u2192 contribution: + (j+1)\n\nTotal change: (i-1 + j+1) - (i + j) = (i-1 +j+1) = i +j, minus (i +j) \u2192 0. So the total sum remains the same after operation 1. Wait, that's interesting. So for non-special arrays (using operation 1), their sum remains the same as the original array b. Now for the special array (operation 2). Let's see what operation 2 does. Operation 2: choose i and j (2 \u2264i <j \u2264 m-2). Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+2]. So the changes in the sum:\n\nc[i] -=1 \u2192 contribution: -i\nc[j] -=1 \u2192 contribution: -j\nc[i-1] +=1 \u2192 + (i-1)\nc[j+2] +=1 \u2192 + (j+2)\n\nTotal change: (i-1 + j+2) - (i + j) = (i-1 +j+2) = i +j +1, minus (i +j) \u2192 +1. So each operation 2 increases the sum by 1. Therefore, the sum for the special array is the original sum (from b) plus the number of operation 2 times. For the non-special arrays, their sum is exactly the original sum (since operation 1 doesn't change the sum). Therefore, the special array is the one whose sum is different from the others. The difference between its sum and the others is exactly the number of operation 2 uses. So the approach is: For all arrays, compute their sum (each element multiplied by its 1-based index). The special array is the one whose sum is different from the majority.",

So, the code for program1.py would look like this:\n\ncase = int(input())\nfor _ in range(case):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    sums = []\n    for j in range(n):\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = 0\n        for k in range(m):\n            s += arr[k] * (k+1)\n        sums.append(s)\n    # Now find the majority\n    # Find the majority value\n    # Check first three elements\n    a, b, c = sums[0], sums[1], sums[2]\n    if a == b:\n        majority = a\n    elif a == c:\n        majority = a\n    else:\n        majority = b\n    # Now confirm majority by checking how many times it appears\n    count = 0\n    special_sum = 0\n    special_index = -1\n    for idx in range(n):\n        if sums[idx] == majority:\n            count +=1\n        else:\n            special_sum = sums[idx]\n            special_index = idx\n    # Since the problem states exactly one is different, so after loop, count is n-1, and special is found\n    k = special_index +1\n    op2 = special_sum - majority\n    print(k, op2) Wait, but the code for finding the majority may not be correct.",

The current code's approach counts the number of pairs of sets that share a common card. Each such pair of sets must be contained in a 5-card group. The minimal group containing two sets that share a common card is the union of the two sets. If the two sets share two cards, their union has four cards, so the fifth card can be any other card.",

The total would be the sum over all such pairs of (n-4). But this counts each meta-set multiple times. For example, a group that contains three sets would be counted multiple times. But perhaps this is the best we can do. Alternatively, the problem's sample input 1 has the meta-set as the entire five cards. In that case, the two sets are (0000, 0001, 0002) and (0000, 0010, 0020). These two sets share the card 0000. Thus, the pair of sets contributes to the count. The number of such pairs would be 1, and multiplied by (5-4)=1 gives 1, which matches the sample. Another sample input 2 has three meta-sets. Thus, this approach might work.",

The code has a loop over j in range(k), and the 'last' array is being computed. The current code has a TODO in the loop over j. The code needs to compute the third card's j-th feature. The third card's feature must be such that the three features are either all the same or all different.

If a != b, then the third card's j-th feature must be the third value not equal to a or b. For example, if a is 0 and b is 1, then the third must be 2. Thus, the code for the j loop should be: \n\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = deck[p][j]\n    b = deck[q][j]\n    if a == b:\n        last[j] = a\n    else:\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b  # since 0+1+2=3, so 3 - a -b gives the third value.

For example, a group that contains two sets will be counted twice. Thus, this approach overcounts. The inclusion-exclusion principle is needed here. Alternatively, the problem requires a different approach. The code provided for program2.py is trying to count for each pair of cards, the third card that forms a set with them. The 'res' array counts for each card how many sets it is part of. The final line computes the sum over all cards of (res[i] choose 2).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve these two programming problems. Let's start with the first one, program1.py. The problem is about finding the special array and the number of operation 2 uses. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, the user has a loop over each test case. For each array c_i, they compute a value which is the sum of each element multiplied by its index+1. The initial approach seems to compare this value between the first array and others. But the code is incomplete in some parts.\n\nHmm, the key here is probably to find that the special array's value (the sum) differs in a specific way. Let me think about the operations. \n\nOperation 1 on a non-special array (c_i where i\u2260k) affects the sum. Let's see: Operation 1 subtracts 1 from c[i] and c[j], adds 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+1]. The contribution to the sum for each of these elements would be:\n\nFor c[i-1], which was multiplied by (i) (since index is i-1, so (i-1 +1) = i). The added 1 contributes +i. \n\nSimilarly, c[i] was multiplied by (i+1), so subtracting 1 gives -(i+1). \n\nSame for j: c[j-1] (but wait, j is the index here. Wait, the operation on positions i and j (indices starting at 1?), or 0-based? The problem says \"array b of length m\", and the indices in the operations are 2 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m-1 for operation 1. Wait, the problem's description uses 1-based indices probably. Because in the first operation, for example, subtract 1 from c_t[i] and c_t[j], and add to c_t[i-1] and c_t[j+1]. So if i is 2, then i-1 is 1, which is allowed. \n\nSo the sum for the array after operation 1 would be:\n\nOriginal sum S. The operation changes elements at positions i-1, i, j, j+1. \n\nThe change in sum is:\n\n+1*(i) (from i-1's position) \n\n-1*(i+1) (from i's position) \n\n+1*(j+1) (from j+1's position) \n\n-1*(j+1) (from j's position? Wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, for operation 1:\n\nc_t[i] is subtracted by 1. Its position is i (since 1-based?), so its contribution to the sum is (i) * (value). So subtracting 1 here reduces the sum by (i). \n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the sum formula. Let me re-calculate the total change for operation 1:\n\nThe operation 1 on positions i and j (1-based indices between 2 and m-1):\n\n- c[i] -=1 \u2192 contribution to sum: -i (since the element is at position i, so multiplied by i)\n- c[j] -=1 \u2192 contribution: -j\n- c[i-1] +=1 \u2192 contribution: + (i-1)\n- c[j+1] +=1 \u2192 contribution: + (j+1)\n\nTotal change: (i-1 + j+1) - (i + j) = (i-1 +j+1) = i +j, minus (i +j) \u2192 0. So the total sum remains the same after operation 1. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So for non-special arrays (using operation 1), their sum remains the same as the original array b. \n\nNow for the special array (operation 2). Let's see what operation 2 does. \n\nOperation 2: choose i and j (2 \u2264i <j \u2264 m-2). Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+2]. \n\nSo the changes in the sum:\n\nc[i] -=1 \u2192 contribution: -i\nc[j] -=1 \u2192 contribution: -j\nc[i-1] +=1 \u2192 + (i-1)\nc[j+2] +=1 \u2192 + (j+2)\n\nTotal change: (i-1 + j+2) - (i + j) = (i-1 +j+2) = i +j +1, minus (i +j) \u2192 +1. \n\nSo each operation 2 increases the sum by 1. \n\nTherefore, the sum for the special array is the original sum (from b) plus the number of operation 2 times. \n\nFor the non-special arrays, their sum is exactly the original sum (since operation 1 doesn't change the sum). \n\nTherefore, the special array is the one whose sum is different from the others. The difference between its sum and the others is exactly the number of operation 2 uses. \n\nSo the approach is: \n\nFor all arrays, compute their sum (each element multiplied by its 1-based index). \n\nThe special array is the one whose sum is different from the majority. Since all non-special arrays have the same sum (the original sum), the special array's sum will be that plus the count of operation2. \n\nSo, the majority of the arrays will have the same sum. The one that has a different sum is the special one, and the difference is the count. \n\nTherefore, in the code, for each test case, we can compute all the sums of each array. Then, find which sum is unique (the one that occurs once, while others have the same sum). \n\nWait, but how? Let's see: \n\nSuppose there are n arrays. All except one (the special) have the same sum S. The special has S + x, where x is the number of operation2. \n\nSo, the majority of the sums (n-1) are S, and one is S+x. \n\nTherefore, to find the special array, we can compute all the sums, then find which one is different. \n\nThe code in program1.py currently starts by initializing tmp to the first array's sum. Then, for the next arrays, if their sum is greater than tmp, it prints j+1 and the difference. But if it's less, then the code is incomplete. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is flawed. Because the first array's sum could be the special one. For example, if the first array is the special one, then its sum would be higher (if x is positive) than the others. But in that case, when comparing to the second array (non-special), the second array's sum would be equal to tmp (the first array's sum?), but that's not correct. \n\nThe problem is that the code is assuming that the first array is non-special, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nSo the correct approach is to collect all the sums, then find which one is the outlier. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each test case, read all n arrays, compute their sum (each element * (index+1) assuming 0-based indices? Wait, the problem says \"the elements of the array c_i are of length m\". Let me check the code's current approach. \n\nIn the code provided, the code for program1.py has:\n\nvalue = 0\nfor k in range(m):\n    value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n\nAh, so the code is using 1-based indices here. Because for the k-th element (0-based), it's multiplied by (k+1). So that's correct. \n\nSo the sum for each array is computed correctly. \n\nNow, the code's current approach is to compare each array's sum to the first one. But that's not reliable. \n\nInstead, the correct way is to collect all the sums, then find which one is different. \n\nSo, for all the sums, the majority (n-1) will have the same value, and one will be different. \n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n- Compute all the sums for each array. \n\n- Find the mode (the value that occurs n-1 times). \n\n- The array whose sum is different is the special one. The difference between its sum and the mode is the count of operation2. \n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\nsums = []\nfor each array in the n arrays:\n    compute the sum and add to sums.\n\nThen, find which sum is the one that occurs once. \n\nWait, but how to do that efficiently? \n\nWe can count the frequency. Since there are n sums, and n can be up to 1e5, but for each test case, we can do this in O(n) time. \n\nAlternatively, since there are only two possible values (the majority and the special), we can track the first two different values and see which is more common. \n\nAlternatively, let's track the first two elements. \n\nSuppose the first two sums are s0 and s1. \n\nIf they are equal, then the majority is s0, and we can scan the rest to see if there's a different one. \n\nIf they are different, then one of them is the special. \n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nsums = [sum1, sum2, ...]\n\ncount the occurrences of the first element. \n\nIf the count is n-1, then the special is the one with different sum. \n\nElse, the first element is the special, and the others are the majority. \n\nAlternatively, here's a way:\n\nTake the first two sums. \n\nIf they are the same, then the majority is that value. Then, iterate through the rest to find the one that is different. \n\nIf the first two are different, then the majority is whichever of the two is found in the third element. \n\nWait, let's think:\n\nSuppose the first two sums are s0 and s1. \n\nIf s0 == s1, then the majority is s0. The special is the one sum that is different. \n\nIf s0 != s1, then check the third sum s2. \n\nIf s2 == s0 \u2192 then majority is s0, and s1 is the special. \n\nIf s2 == s1 \u2192 majority is s1, and s0 is the special. \n\nSo this can be done in O(1) time for the first three elements, then once we know the majority, we can find the differing one. \n\nThis approach would be O(n) time. \n\nOnce the majority is known, we can loop through all the arrays again to find which one's sum is different. \n\nAlternatively, in code, here's a possible approach:\n\nCompute all the sums into a list. \n\nThen, find the first element that is different from the first element. \n\nIf all are the same, then that can't happen (since there must be exactly one different). \n\nWait, but the problem states that exactly one array is special. \n\nSo, let's proceed as follows:\n\nCompute all the sums. \n\nCheck the first two elements. \n\nIf they are the same, then the majority is that value. \n\nThen, loop through the sums to find the one that is different. \n\nOnce found, that's the special array. \n\nIf the first two are different, then check the third. \n\nSuppose the third is same as first \u2192 then majority is first, so the second is the special. \n\nElse, majority is second, so first is the special. \n\nOnce the majority is known, then loop through all the arrays to find the one with different sum. \n\nAlternatively, here's a code approach:\n\nsums = []\nfor each array in the test case:\n    compute the sum and append to sums. \n\nThen, find the majority value. \n\nWe can do this by checking the first three elements. \n\nLet's see:\n\ns0 = sums[0], s1 = sums[1], s2 = sums[2]\n\nif s0 == s1:\n    majority = s0\nelif s0 == s2:\n    majority = s0\nelse:\n    majority = s1\n\nWait, but this may not work in all cases. \n\nAlternatively, the majority is the one that occurs at least two times among the first three. \n\nSo, if two of the first three are the same, that's the majority. \n\nOnce the majority is determined, then the special array is the one with sum not equal to majority. \n\nOnce we have the majority, we can loop through all the sums to find the index where the sum is different. \n\nOnce found, that's the k (index+1, since the arrays are 1-based in output). \n\nThe count is (sum_special - majority). \n\nSo, in code, for program1.py, the code needs to collect all the sums first. \n\nThe current code in program1.py is trying to compare each array's sum to the first one, but that's not correct. \n\nSo the code should be modified to first collect all the sums, then process them. \n\nSo, in the code:\n\nInside the loop for each test case:\n\nsums = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    sums.append(value)\n\nThen, find the majority. \n\nOnce the majority is found, loop through the sums to find the index where the sum is different. \n\nOnce found, the answer is (index+1, (sums[index] - majority)). \n\nSo, the code needs to be restructured. \n\nThe current code in program1.py is trying to do this in a way that for each array after the first, it compares to the first. But that's not correct because the first array could be the special one. \n\nSo the correct approach is to collect all the sums first. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then process them. \n\nNow, the code in program1.py currently has a loop over the n arrays, but it's not storing all the sums. \n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted. \n\nThe current code for program1.py is:\n\ncase=int(input())\nfor i in range(case):\n  n,m = (int(v) for v in input().split())\n  tmp=0\n  for j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n      value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    if j==0:\n      tmp = value\n    else:\n      if value > tmp:\n        print(str(j+1)+\" \"+str(value-tmp))\n      elif value < tmp:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n      else:\n        pass\n\nThis approach is flawed because it's comparing each subsequent array's sum to the first. \n\nThe correct approach is to collect all the sums first. \n\nSo, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nsums = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    value = sum( ( (k+1)*num for k, num in enumerate(list1) ) )\n    sums.append(value)\n\nThen, find the majority. \n\nOnce the majority is found, find the index where the sum is different. \n\nSo, the code for program1.py's missing part is to collect all the sums first, then process them. \n\nNow, how to implement this in the code. \n\nThe current code is trying to process each array as it reads them, but that's not feasible. \n\nSo, the code needs to read all the arrays first. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py should be modified to first read all the arrays, compute their sums, then process. \n\nSo, the code for program1.py would look like this:\n\ncase = int(input())\nfor _ in range(case):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    sums = []\n    for j in range(n):\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = 0\n        for k in range(m):\n            s += arr[k] * (k+1)\n        sums.append(s)\n    # Now find the majority\n    # Find the majority value\n    # Check first three elements\n    a, b, c = sums[0], sums[1], sums[2]\n    if a == b:\n        majority = a\n    elif a == c:\n        majority = a\n    else:\n        majority = b\n    # Now confirm majority by checking how many times it appears\n    count = 0\n    special_sum = 0\n    special_index = -1\n    for idx in range(n):\n        if sums[idx] == majority:\n            count +=1\n        else:\n            special_sum = sums[idx]\n            special_index = idx\n    # Since the problem states exactly one is different, so after loop, count is n-1, and special is found\n    k = special_index +1\n    op2 = special_sum - majority\n    print(k, op2)\n\nWait, but the code for finding the majority may not be correct. For example, if the first three elements are all different, but that's impossible because the majority is n-1. So in that case, the first three can't all be different. \n\nWait, the problem states that exactly one array is the special one. So among the first three elements, at least two must be the same. \n\nBecause if all three are different, then two of them would have to be part of the non-special arrays, but that's impossible since non-special arrays all have the same sum. \n\nTherefore, the first three elements must have at least two equal. \n\nTherefore, the code above for choosing majority is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to count the occurrences of the first element. \n\ncount = 1\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if sums[i] == sums[0]:\n        count +=1\nif count >1: # then majority is sums[0]\n    majority = sums[0]\n    # find the one that is different\n    for i in range(n):\n        if sums[i] != majority:\n            special_index = i\n            break\nelse: # the first element is the special one\n    # then majority is the other elements\n    # check the second and third to find the majority\n    if sums[1] == sums[2]:\n        majority = sums[1]\n        special_index =0\n    else:\n        # but this can't happen because majority must be n-1\n        # so perhaps the second and third are same, so majority is that\n        # so this code may not be needed. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nCompute the first three elements. \n\nIf the first two are equal, then majority is first. \n\nElse, check the third. \n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nmajority = sums[0]\nif sums[1] != majority:\n    if sums[2] == majority:\n        # then majority is correct, and the second is the special\n        pass\n    else:\n        # then majority is sums[1], and first is special\n        majority = sums[1]\n# but this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code can just count the occurrences of the first element. \n\ncount = 0\nfor s in sums:\n    if s == sums[0]:\n        count +=1\nif count >1:\n    majority = sums[0]\nelse:\n    majority = sums[1] # since the majority is the other value, which occurs n-1 times. \n\nWait, but if the first element is the special one, then the majority is the other value. \n\nBut how to find which is the majority? \n\nAlternatively, after counting the first element's count, if it's 1, then the majority is the other value. \n\nBut how to get the other value? \n\nWe can loop through the sums again to find the first element that is not the first. \n\nAlternatively, once we know that the first element is the special, then the majority is the value of the second element (assuming the second is part of the majority). \n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to loop through all the sums once to find the majority. \n\nWait, but for n up to 1e5, this is manageable. \n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach:\n\nWe can find the majority by checking the first element's count. \n\ncount = 0\nfor s in sums:\n    if s == sums[0]:\n        count +=1\nif count >1:\n    majority = sums[0]\nelse:\n    # the majority is the other value, which occurs n-1 times. \n    # so pick any element that is not the first. \n    # for example, the second element. \n    majority = sums[1] if sums[1] != sums[0] else sums[2]\n\nWait, but in the case where the first is the special, then the majority is the value that occurs n-1 times. So the second element is part of the majority. \n\nSo, in the else case, the majority is the value of the second element (assuming the second is not the special). \n\nBut what if the second is also the special? No, because the special is only one. \n\nSo, in the else case, the majority is the value of the second element (since the first is the special, so the second is part of the majority). \n\nWait, but if the first is the special, then the majority is the value of the other n-1 elements. So the second element is part of the majority. \n\nThus, in the else case, the majority can be set to sums[1], since it's part of the majority. \n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\ncount = 0\nfor s in sums:\n    if s == sums[0]:\n        count +=1\nif count >1:\n    majority = sums[0]\nelse:\n    majority = sums[1]\n\nWait, but what if the second element is also the special? No, because there's only one special. \n\nSo, in the else case, the first element is the special, so the majority is the value of the other elements. \n\nThus, the second element is part of the majority. \n\nTherefore, this code would work. \n\nOnce the majority is known, then loop through the sums to find the index where the sum is different. \n\nOnce found, that's the special array. \n\nThe code for program1.py would then be:\n\ncase = int(input())\nfor _ in range(case):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    sums = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = 0\n        for k in range(m):\n            s += arr[k] * (k+1)\n        sums.append(s)\n    # Determine majority\n    count = 0\n    for s in sums:\n        if s == sums[0]:\n            count +=1\n    if count >1:\n        majority = sums[0]\n    else:\n        majority = sums[1]\n    # Now find the special index\n    special_index = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if sums[i] != majority:\n            special_index = i\n            break\n    # Now check if there is exactly one such (problem says it's unique)\n    # So proceed\n    k = special_index +1\n    op2 = sums[special_index] - majority\n    print(k, op2)\n\nWait, but in the else case, when the first element is the special, then the majority is sums[1], but what if the second element is also the special? No, because there's only one. \n\nThis code should work. \n\nNow, looking back at the original code provided for program1.py, the user's code is trying to process each array as it reads them, but that's not feasible. \n\nThe correct code requires storing all the sums first, so the missing code in program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then process them. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py's missing part is to read all the arrays first, compute their sums, then find the majority and the special array. \n\nNow, the original code in program1.py has a loop over the arrays, but it's not storing all the sums. \n\nThe user's code currently has:\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    if j==0:\n        tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp:\n            print(...)\n        elif value < tmp:\n            # TODO\n        else:\n            pass\n\nThis approach is incorrect because it's comparing each array to the first, which may be the special one. \n\nThe correct approach requires storing all the sums first, so the code must be restructured. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to collect all the sums first, then process them. \n\nThe user's code currently is not doing that, so the correct code would involve modifying the loop to collect all the sums first. \n\nTherefore, the completion for program1.py is to replace the existing code with code that reads all the arrays first, computes their sums, then finds the special array. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is about counting the number of meta-sets among n cards. A meta-set is a group of five cards where there are more than one set among them. \n\nA set is three cards where for each feature, the three are either all the same or all different. \n\nThe approach here is to find all 5-card groups and check how many of them have more than one set. \n\nBut with n up to 1000, the number of 5-card groups is C(1000,5) which is way too big (like 8e13). So this approach is impossible. \n\nWe need a smarter way. \n\nThe problem requires counting the number of 5-card groups that contain more than one set. \n\nFirst, note that a meta-set is a 5-card group with at least two sets. \n\nThe key idea is to find all possible 5-card groups and count those with at least two sets. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nFor each possible set of three cards, count how many 5-card groups include this set and at least one other set. \n\nBut even this might be tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of meta-sets is equal to the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nWe can compute this as the total number of 5-card groups with at least two sets. \n\nAlternatively, the inclusion-exclusion approach. \n\nAlternatively, think of all possible pairs of sets that share some cards, and count the 5-card groups that include both. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach: \n\nFirst, precompute all possible sets among the n cards. \n\nThen, for each set S1, find all other sets S2 that share some cards with S1, and compute how many 5-card groups include both S1 and S2. \n\nBut even this might be computationally intensive. \n\nAlternatively, note that a 5-card group can contain multiple sets. \n\nEach set is a triplet. \n\nSuppose a 5-card group has t sets. Then, it contributes 1 to the meta-set count if t \u22652. \n\nThe total number of meta-sets is the sum over all 5-card groups of (1 if the number of sets in them is \u22652 else 0). \n\nTo compute this, perhaps we can find for each 5-card group the number of sets it contains, and count those with count \u22652. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nThe total number of 5-card groups with at least two sets is equal to the total number of pairs of sets that share exactly two cards (so their intersection is two cards, and the fifth card is the third of each set?), or other overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach: \n\nFirst, compute all possible sets. Let the number of sets be S. \n\nThen, for each pair of sets (S1, S2), compute how many 5-card groups include both S1 and S2. \n\nBut overlapping sets can have different overlaps. \n\nThe total would be the sum over all pairs of sets (S1, S2) of the number of 5-card groups that include both S1 and S2, minus the overcounts where three or more sets are involved. \n\nBut inclusion-exclusion here might be complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering that a meta-set must contain at least two sets. \n\nEach set is a triplet. \n\nSuppose a 5-card group contains two sets. \n\nThese two sets can share 0, 1, or 2 cards. \n\nIf they share 0 cards, then the 5-card group has 6 distinct cards, which is impossible. So they must share at least one card. \n\nWait, two sets in a 5-card group must share at least one card. \n\nFor example, two sets can share two cards. \n\nLet me think of possible cases: \n\nCase 1: The two sets share exactly two cards. \n\nThen, the two sets form a four-card group, and the fifth card is the third card of each set. Wait, no. \n\nWait, suppose set A is {a,b,c}, set B is {a,b,d}. Then the two sets share two cards (a and b). The combined cards are a, b, c, d. To form a 5-card group, there must be a fifth card. \n\nWait, but the 5-card group must include both sets. So the 5-card group must include all elements of A and B. \n\nIn this case, A and B together have 4 distinct elements. So the 5-card group must include those four plus one more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two sets can share two elements, and the fifth element is part of another set. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe number of meta-sets is equal to the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps we can first compute the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least one set, then subtract those that contain exactly one set. \n\nBut how to compute the number of 5-card groups with exactly one set. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of 5-card groups with at least two sets is equal to the sum over all pairs of sets (S1, S2) of the number of 5-card groups that include both S1 and S2, divided by the number of times each group is counted. \n\nBut this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of all possible 5-card groups and count how many sets they contain. \n\nThe problem requires the count of those with count \u22652. \n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each 5-card group the number of sets it contains, but this is O(n^5), which is way too big. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a way to compute the total number of pairs of sets that are contained in the same 5-card group, then subtract overlaps. \n\nWait, the total number of meta-sets is equal to the number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nEach such group contributes 1 to the count. \n\nThe total can be calculated as the sum over all possible 5-card groups of (number of sets in the group choose 2) divided by something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of pairs of sets that are contained in the same 5-card group is equal to the sum over all meta-sets of (number of sets in the group choose 2). \n\nBut this might not help directly. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach: \n\nFirst, find all possible sets. Let S be the list of all sets. \n\nFor each set A in S, we can find all other sets B that share at least two elements with A. Because if two sets share two elements, then their third elements must form a 5-card group with the two shared elements and the two unique elements. \n\nWait, let me think: \n\nSuppose set A is {a,b,c}, set B is {a,b,d}. \n\nThen the 5-card group must include a, b, c, d, and possibly another element. \n\nWait, but the group must have exactly five cards. \n\nSo the two sets A and B can be part of a 5-card group only if their combined elements are exactly five, or less, but then adding other cards. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe problem requires counting all 5-card groups that have at least two sets. \n\nEach such group must contain at least two different sets. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nFor each possible set of three cards (S), we can find all other sets that share two cards with S. \n\nSuppose S is {a,b,c}. \n\nAnother set T must share two cards with S. \n\nSuppose T is {a,b,d}. \n\nThen the 5-card group must include a, b, c, d, and possibly another card. \n\nWait, but the group must have exactly five cards. \n\nSo the group could be {a,b,c,d,e}, where e is another card. \n\nBut in this case, the two sets S and T are both in the group. \n\nThe number of such groups would be the number of possible e's such that the group includes S and T. \n\nAlternatively, the group must include all elements of S and T. \n\nThe combined elements of S and T are a, b, c, d. So the fifth element can be any other card not in S or T. \n\nWait, but the group must have exactly five cards. \n\nSo the group must be the union of S and T plus one more card. \n\nWait, the union of S and T has 4 elements (a, b, c, d). So adding one more card (e) gives five. \n\nThus, the group {a,b,c,d,e} contains both S and T. \n\nSo for each pair of sets S and T that share exactly two elements, the number of 5-card groups that include both is equal to the number of cards not in S \u222a T. \n\nWait, but the fifth card can be any card not in S \u222a T. \n\nWait, but the group must include all elements of S and T. \n\nSo the group must be exactly the four elements of S and T plus one more. \n\nWait, the group must contain all elements of S and T. \n\nThe union of S and T has 4 elements (since they share two). \n\nSo the fifth element can be any other card not in the union. \n\nThus, for each such pair of sets S and T sharing two elements, the number of 5-card groups that include both is (n - 4). \n\nWait, but the fifth card can be any of the remaining (n -4) cards. \n\nBut this counts all such groups. \n\nHowever, this counts each group multiple times. For example, a group that contains three sets would be counted multiple times. \n\nThis approach might be complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following steps can be taken: \n\n1. Precompute all possible sets. \n\n2. For each set S, find all other sets that share two elements with S. \n\n3. For each such pair (S, T), compute the number of 5-card groups that include both S and T. \n\n4. Sum all these, but then subtract overlaps where a group contains three or more sets. \n\nBut this is getting into inclusion-exclusion which is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that a meta-set must contain at least two sets. \n\nEach such meta-set can be formed by choosing a set S and then adding two more cards such that another set is formed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach is feasible: \n\nThe total number of meta-sets is equal to the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nTo compute this, we can first compute the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least one set, then subtract those that contain exactly one set. \n\nThe first part (total with at least one set) can be computed as the sum over all sets of the number of ways to choose two more cards from the remaining n-3 cards, but this counts overlaps where a group contains multiple sets multiple times. \n\nThis is the inclusion-exclusion problem again. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py is:\n\nimport sys; R = sys.stdin.readline\nn,k = map(int,R().split())\ndeck = [tuple(map(int,R().split())) for _ in range(n)]\ndic = {}\nfor i in range(n): dic[deck[i]] = i\nres = [0]*n\nfor p in range(n-2):\n    for q in range(p+1,n-1):\n        last = [0]*k\n        for j in range(k):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        last = tuple(last)\n        if last in dic and dic[last]>q:\n            res[p] += 1; res[q] += 1; res[dic[last]] += 1\nprint(sum((s*(s-1))//2 for s in res))\n\nThe code is trying to compute for each pair of cards (p, q), the third card that forms a set with them. \n\nThe idea is that for any two cards, there is exactly one third card that forms a set with them. \n\nThe code is trying to find that third card (last) and then increment the count for each of the three cards. \n\nThe 'res' array counts how many sets each card is part of. \n\nThen, the final result is the sum over all cards of (s choose 2), which would count the number of pairs of sets that include the card. \n\nWait, but the problem requires the number of 5-card groups with at least two sets. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to compute for each card how many sets it is in, then use that to compute the number of meta-sets. \n\nWait, the current code's approach is to compute for each card the number of sets it is part of (stored in res). \n\nThen, the sum over all cards of (res[i] choose 2) would count the number of pairs of sets that share the card. \n\nBut this counts all pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nHowever, a meta-set is a 5-card group with at least two sets. \n\nEach such group contributes to multiple pairs. \n\nThis approach might not directly give the required count. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is trying to compute the number of sets, but the problem requires meta-sets. \n\nThe code's current approach is incomplete. \n\nThe problem requires counting all 5-card groups that have at least two sets. \n\nThe current code's approach is to count for each pair of cards, the third card that forms a set. \n\nThe 'res' array counts for each card how many sets it is part of. \n\nThe final line computes the sum of (s choose 2) for each card's count s. \n\nThis would count the number of pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nBut this counts all such pairs, but each meta-set may contribute multiple such pairs. \n\nFor example, a meta-set with three sets would contribute three pairs for each common card. \n\nThis approach might not directly give the correct count. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nThe current code's approach is not sufficient. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe number of meta-sets is equal to the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nTo compute this, we can first compute the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least one set, then subtract those that contain exactly one set. \n\nThe first part can be computed as follows: \n\nTotal_with_at_least_one = sum_{each set S} (C(n-3, 2)) \n\nBut this counts overlaps multiple times. \n\nFor example, a group that contains two sets will be counted twice. \n\nThus, this approach overcounts. \n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle is needed here. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires a different approach. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py is trying to count for each pair of cards, the third card that forms a set with them. \n\nThe 'res' array counts for each card how many sets it is part of. \n\nThe final line computes the sum over all cards of (res[i] choose 2). \n\nThis would give the total number of pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nBut each meta-set of five cards with two sets would contribute to this count. \n\nHowever, this counts all pairs of sets that share a common card, but not necessarily in the same 5-card group. \n\nFor example, two sets that share a card but are part of different 5-card groups would also be counted. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find all possible 5-card groups and count those with at least two sets. \n\nBut with n up to 1000, this is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe number of meta-sets is equal to the number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nEach such group must contain at least two sets. \n\nEach set is a triplet. \n\nSuppose a group of five cards contains two sets. \n\nThese two sets must share at least one card. \n\nLet me think of the possible cases: \n\nCase 1: The two sets share two cards. \n\nThen the two sets form a four-card group plus one more card. \n\nFor example, set A is {a,b,c}, set B is {a,b,d}. \n\nThe five-card group must include a, b, c, d, and a fifth card e. \n\nBut then the two sets are in the group. \n\nThe number of such groups would be the number of pairs of sets that share two cards multiplied by the number of possible fifth cards. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the following approach can be used: \n\nFor each possible set of three cards (S), iterate over all other pairs of cards in the deck that form another set with two of the three cards. \n\nWait, perhaps this is not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires a different approach. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py is trying to compute for each pair of cards (p and q), the third card that forms a set with them. \n\nThe 'last' array is computed as follows: \n\nFor each feature j, the third card's j-th feature is such that the three features are either all the same or all different. \n\nFor example, for each feature j of the two cards p and q: \n\nIf p's j and q's j are the same, then the third card's j must also be the same. \n\nIf they are different, then the third card's j must be the remaining value. \n\nThus, the third card is uniquely determined. \n\nThe code is trying to compute this third card and check if it exists in the deck. \n\nIf it does, then the three cards form a set. \n\nThe 'res' array counts for each card how many sets it is part of. \n\nThe final line computes the sum over all cards of (res[i] choose 2). \n\nThis counts the number of pairs of sets that include the card. \n\nThe total of this sum is the total number of pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nBut each meta-set of five cards with two sets contributes to this count. \n\nHowever, a meta-set with two sets that share a common card would contribute 1 to this count. \n\nA meta-set with three sets would contribute multiple times. \n\nBut the problem requires the number of 5-card groups with at least two sets. \n\nThe sum computed by the current code's final line is the total number of pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nBut this counts all such pairs, regardless of whether they are in the same 5-card group. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each 5-card group the number of sets it contains, and count those with at least two. \n\nBut with n up to 1000, this is O(n^5), which is way too big. \n\nWait, but n is up to 1000, so n choose 5 is about 8e10, which is way too big. \n\nThus, this approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe number of meta-sets is equal to the number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nEach such group must contain at least two sets. \n\nEach set is a triplet. \n\nSuppose a group of five cards contains two sets. \n\nThese two sets must share at least one card. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nFor each possible set S of three cards, find all other sets T that share two cards with S. \n\nThe fifth card can be any other card not in S or T. \n\nThe number of such groups is the number of such T multiplied by (n - 5) (since the fifth card must be outside S and T). \n\nWait, but this is not precise. \n\nAlternatively, for each pair of sets S and T that share two cards, the number of 5-card groups that include both S and T is the number of ways to choose the fifth card from the remaining cards not in S or T. \n\nThe combined cards of S and T are four distinct cards (since they share two). \n\nThus, the fifth card can be any of the remaining (n-4) cards. \n\nThus, for each such pair (S, T), there are (n-4) groups. \n\nBut this counts each group multiple times. For example, a group that contains three sets would be counted multiple times. \n\nThus, the total would be the sum over all pairs of sets that share two cards of (n-4), minus overlaps. \n\nBut this is still complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the problem's sample input 1 has n=5 cards, and the meta-set is the entire group. \n\nThe code's current approach would compute for each card the number of sets it is in. \n\nSuppose in sample 1, each card is part of two sets. \n\nThen the sum of (s choose 2) would be 5*(2 choose 2) =5. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nThus, the current approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the current approach is not correct. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to find all possible 5-card groups and count those with at least two sets. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe number of meta-sets is equal to the total number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nEach such group must contain at least two sets. \n\nEach set is a triplet. \n\nFor a group of five cards, the number of sets it contains can be computed as follows: \n\nThe number of triplets in the group that form a set. \n\nThus, for each 5-card group, we can compute the number of sets it contains. \n\nIf it's \u22652, count it. \n\nBut with n=1000, this is impossible. \n\nThus, we need a smarter way. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe number of meta-sets is equal to the number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets. \n\nEach such group must contain at least two sets. \n\nEach set is a triplet. \n\nSuppose a group of five cards contains two sets. \n\nThese two sets must share at least one card. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nFor each possible set S of three cards, iterate over all other pairs of cards in the deck. \n\nThe fifth card can be any card not in S. \n\nThen, check if the five-card group contains another set. \n\nBut this is still O(n^3), which is 1e9 for n=1000. \n\nNot feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py is trying to compute for each pair of cards the third card that forms a set with them. \n\nThe 'res' array counts for each card how many sets it is part of. \n\nThe final line computes the sum of (s choose 2) for each card's count s. \n\nThis counts the number of pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nThe problem requires the number of 5-card groups with at least two sets. \n\nEach such group must contain at least two sets. \n\nEach pair of sets in the group must share at least one card. \n\nThus, each such group contributes at least one pair of sets that share a card. \n\nBut the total count of such pairs is the sum computed by the code. \n\nHowever, each group with two sets contributes one pair (if the two sets share a card), or two pairs (if they share two cards). \n\nBut the code's sum counts all such pairs, but each meta-set contributes at least one such pair. \n\nThus, the sum is an upper bound on the number of meta-sets. \n\nBut this is not the correct count. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is the sum computed by the code divided by something. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets by considering all possible pairs of sets that share two cards. \n\nFor each such pair of sets S and T that share two cards, the number of 5-card groups that include both is (n -4) (as explained before). \n\nThe total would be the sum over all such pairs of (n-4). \n\nBut this counts each meta-set multiple times. \n\nFor example, a group that contains three sets would be counted multiple times. \n\nBut perhaps this is the best we can do. \n\nAlternatively, the problem's sample input 1 has the meta-set as the entire five cards. \n\nIn that case, the two sets are (0000, 0001, 0002) and (0000, 0010, 0020). \n\nThese two sets share the card 0000. \n\nThus, the pair of sets contributes to the count. \n\nThe number of such pairs would be 1, and multiplied by (5-4)=1 gives 1, which matches the sample. \n\nAnother sample input 2 has three meta-sets. \n\nThus, this approach might work. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to count all pairs of sets that share two cards, and multiply by (n-4), then sum over all such pairs. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nTo compute this, we can iterate over all possible pairs of sets that share two cards. \n\nBut how to find such pairs efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, for each set S, we can find all other sets T that share two cards with S. \n\nThe number of such T for each S can be computed by iterating over all possible pairs of cards in S and finding other sets that include those two cards. \n\nThis might be feasible. \n\nBut with n up to 1000, the number of sets could be large. \n\nAlternatively, the following steps can be taken: \n\n1. Precompute all sets. \n\n2. For each set S, store its elements. \n\n3. For each pair of cards in S, find all other sets that contain this pair. \n\n4. For each such pair of sets (S and T), count them as a pair that shares two cards. \n\nBut this requires O(number of sets * 3 choose 2) operations. \n\nThe number of sets can be up to C(1000,3) which is about 1e8, which is too big. \n\nThus, this approach is not feasible. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to use the code provided but fix the missing part. \n\nLooking back at the code for program2.py: \n\nThe code is trying to compute for each pair of cards (p and q), the third card that forms a set with them. \n\nThe 'last' array is computed as follows: \n\nFor each feature j, the third card's j-th feature is determined by the two cards p and q. \n\nThe code has a loop over j in range(k), and the 'last' array is being computed. \n\nThe current code has a TODO in the loop over j. \n\nThe code needs to compute the third card's j-th feature. \n\nThe third card's feature must be such that the three features are either all the same or all different. \n\nFor each feature j of the two cards p and q: \n\nLet a = p's j-th feature, b = q's j-th feature. \n\nIf a == b, then the third card's j-th feature must also be a. \n\nIf a != b, then the third card's j-th feature must be the third value not equal to a or b. \n\nFor example, if a is 0 and b is 1, then the third must be 2. \n\nThus, the code for the j loop should be: \n\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = deck[p][j]\n    b = deck[q][j]\n    if a == b:\n        last[j] = a\n    else:\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b  # since 0+1+2=3, so 3 - a -b gives the third value.\n\nThus, the missing code in the loop over j is: \n\nlast[j] = a if a == b else 3 - a - b \n\nThus, the code for program2.py's missing part is to compute this for each j. \n\nOnce this is done, the code proceeds to check if the third card exists in the deck and is after q (to avoid duplicates). \n\nThe 'res' array counts for each card how many sets it is part of. \n\nThe final line computes the sum over all cards of (s choose 2), which counts the number of pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nBut this is not the correct answer. \n\nHowever, the problem's sample input 1 has the following: \n\nSample 1: \n\nThe meta-set is the five cards. \n\nEach card is part of two sets. \n\nThus, for each card, res[i] = 2. \n\nThe sum would be 5 * (2 choose 2) =5. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is the sum divided by something. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect, but the problem requires a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the sum of (s choose 2) for all cards, minus the number of sets multiplied by (number of sets -1)/2. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is correct but the final line is wrong. \n\nThe problem requires the number of 5-card groups with at least two sets. \n\nThe current code's approach counts the number of pairs of sets that share a common card. \n\nEach such pair of sets must be contained in a 5-card group. \n\nThe minimal group containing two sets that share a common card is the union of the two sets. \n\nIf the two sets share two cards, their union has four cards, so the fifth card can be any other card. \n\nThus, each pair of sets that share two cards contributes (n-4) groups. \n\nBut the code's approach counts each such pair once. \n\nThus, the total number of meta-sets would be the number of such pairs multiplied by (n-4). \n\nBut how to compute the number of such pairs. \n\nThe current code's approach is not directly doing this. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer is the sum computed by the code divided by something. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect and the correct approach is to compute the number of 5-card groups that contain at least two sets by considering all possible pairs of sets that share two cards. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct completion for program2.py is to fill in the missing code for the 'last' array. \n\nThe missing code in the loop over j is to compute the third card's feature. \n\nThus, the code for program2.py's missing part is: \n\nfor j in range(k):\n    a = deck[p][j]\n    b = deck[q][j]\n    if a == b:\n        last[j] = a\n    else:\n        last[j] = 3 - a - b\n\nThus, the completion for program2.py is to fill in this code. \n\nThe final line of the code is incorrect, but perhaps the problem requires this approach. \n\nThe problem's sample input 1 would have the code's final line compute 5*(2 choose 2) =5, but the correct answer is 1. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the problem requires this approach and the final line is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the sum of (s choose 2) minus the number of sets. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code for program2.py's missing part as the computation of the third card's features. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is the loop over j to compute the third card's features. \n\nSo, the completion for program2.py is to fill in that loop. \n\nThus, the final answers are: \n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is to collect all the sums first, then find the special array. \n\nThe code for program1.py's missing part is to read all the arrays first, compute their sums, then process them. \n\nThe code provided in the problem for program1.py is not doing that, so the correct code would involve storing all the sums first. \n\nThe user's code currently has a loop that reads each array and compares to the first. \n\nThe correct code would need to read all arrays first, then compute the majority. \n\nThus, the completion for program1.py is to replace the existing code with code that reads all the arrays first. \n\nBut since the user's code is in the middle of a loop, perhaps the correct completion is to fill in the 'elif' block. \n\nWait, looking back at the code for program1.py: \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nfor j in range(n):\n    list1 = [int(v) for v in input().split()]\n    value = 0\n    for k in range(m):\n        value += list1[k]*(k+1)\n    if j==0:\n        tmp = value\n    else:\n        if value > tmp:\n            print(str(j+1)+\" \"+str(value-tmp))\n        elif value < tmp:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            pass\n\nThis approach is incorrect because it's comparing each array to the first. \n\nThe correct approach requires comparing all arrays. \n\nThus, the code is fundamentally wrong and needs to be restructured. \n\nThe user's code is not just missing a few lines but requires a complete rework. \n\nHowever, the problem states that the user must fill in the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe user's code for program1.py has a 'TODO' in the 'elif' block. \n\nThe current code is trying to print the answer when the current array's sum is greater than the first. \n\nBut when the current array's sum is less than the first, it's the TODO. \n\nThe correct approach is that the first array may be the special one. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to collect all the sums first. \n\nBut since the user's code is structured to process each array as it reads them, perhaps the correct completion is to realize that the first array's sum may be the special one. \n\nThus, the code should track all the sums. \n\nBut given the code's current structure, perhaps the correct completion is to realize that when the current array's sum is less than the first, then the first array is not the special one. \n\nBut this is not reliable. \n\nAlternatively, the correct completion is to realize that the special array is the one with a different sum. \n\nThus, the code should track the first array's sum and compare others. \n\nBut this is not reliable. \n\nAlternatively, the code can track the first array's sum and the current array's sum. \n\nIf the current array's sum is different from the first, then the special array is either the first or the current. \n\nBut this requires more tracking. \n\nPerhaps the correct completion for the 'elif' block is to print the first array as the special one with the difference. \n\nBut this is not correct. \n\nGiven the time constraints and the problem's requirements, I'll proceed with the following completions: \n\nFor program1.py, the missing code in the 'elif' block is to print the first array as the special one with the difference. \n\nBut this is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the correct completion is to realize that the special array is the one with a different sum. \n\nThus, the code should track all the sums. \n\nBut since the user's code is not doing that, perhaps the correct completion is to store all the sums in a list and then process them. \n\nBut the user's code is in the middle of a loop, so the completion would require adding code to store the sums. \n\nHowever, the problem states to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code for program1.py has a loop over the arrays, and in the 'else' clause (when value < tmp), the code is missing. \n\nThe correct approach is to realize that the first array may be the special one. \n\nThus, the code should track all the sums. \n\nBut given the current code structure, perhaps the correct
