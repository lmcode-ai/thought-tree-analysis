Because when you expand the gradients, the X_centered term is multiplied by the sum of grad multiplied by X_centered, which is grad_X_centered_sum, and that sum is then scaled by the inverse standard deviation squared. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact derivative.\n\nLet me recall the derivative for batch norm.

So that sum would be sum( dY * (X - mu)/sigma ), which is sum( dY * X_centered * stddev_inv ). But in grad_X_centered_sum, we have sum( dY * X_centered ), not multiplied by stddev_inv. Therefore, to get the term sum(dY * X_hat), which is sum( dY * X_centered * stddev_inv ), we need to multiply grad_X_centered_sum by stddev_inv.\n\nAh, right. So the term in the formula is X_centered * (stddev_inv^2) * sum(dY * X_centered) * (1/N). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the code structure. The current line is:\n\nbatch_size * grad - grad_sum - X_centered * [something] * grad_X_centered_sum\n\nBut according to the formula, the third term should be X_hat * sum(dY * X_hat) which is (X_centered * stddev_inv) * sum( grad * X_centered * stddev_inv )\n\nSo sum( grad * X_centered * stddev_inv ) is stddev_inv * sum( grad * X_centered ) because stddev_inv is a scalar (per feature). So sum( grad * X_centered * stddev_inv ) = stddev_inv * grad_X_centered_sum.\n\nThen the third term in the formula would be X_centered * stddev_inv * (stddev_inv * grad_X_centered_sum) / batch_size ?\n\nWait, in the code, the expression is:\n\nbatch_size_factor = 1 / batch_size\n\ngrad_X = batch_size_factor * weight_data * stddev_inv * ( batch_size * grad - grad_sum - X_centered * [something] * grad_X_centered_sum )\n\nSo the big parenthesis is:\n\n(batch_size * grad) - grad_sum - X_centered * [...] * grad_X_centered_sum\n\nIn the formula, the third term is (X_centered * stddev_inv) * sum( grad * X_centered * stddev_inv ) multiplied by (1/(batch_size)) ?\n\nAlternatively, let's think step by step.\n\nThe standard derivation of batch norm backward pass gives:\n\ndX = (gamma / (sigma * sqrt(N))) * ( N*dY - sum(dY) - X_hat * sum(dY * X_hat) )\n\nIn this code:\n\nX_hat is X_centered * stddev_inv.\n\nsum(dY * X_hat) is sum( grad * X_hat ) = sum( grad * X_centered * stddev_inv )\n\nBut grad_X_centered_sum is sum( grad * X_centered ), not multiplied by stddev_inv.\n\nSo sum( grad * X_hat ) = stddev_inv * grad_X_centered_sum.\n\nThen, the third term in the formula is X_hat * sum( grad * X_hat ) = (X_centered * stddev_inv) * ( stddev_inv * grad_X_centered_sum )\n\nWhich is X_centered * stddev_inv^2 * grad_X_centered_sum.\n\nSo the third term in the parentheses is X_centered * stddev_inv^2 * grad_X_centered_sum.\n\nBut in the code, the third term is X_centered * [something] * grad_X_centered_sum. So [something] must be stddev_inv squared.\n\nSo the missing part is stddev_inv squared, which is stddev_inv ** 2.\n\nTherefore, the missing code should be stddev_inv ** 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the line should be:\n\nX_centered * stddev_inv ** 2 * grad_X_centered_sum\n\nBut in the code, the line is:\n\nbatch_size * grad - grad_sum - X_centered * # TODO: ... * grad_X_centered_sum\n\nSo the missing code is the product of stddev_inv squared.\n\nSo the code line should be: \n\nbatch_size * grad - grad_sum - X_centered * stddev_inv**2 * grad_X_centered_sum\n\nWait, but in Python, exponentiation is **. So the correct code would be stddev_inv**2. Therefore, the missing part is stddev_inv**2.\n\nSo the completed line is:\n\nbatch_size * grad - grad_sum - X_centered * stddev_inv**2 * grad_X_centered_sum\n\nThat's the term that goes into the parentheses. So the missing part is \"stddev_inv**2\"."
