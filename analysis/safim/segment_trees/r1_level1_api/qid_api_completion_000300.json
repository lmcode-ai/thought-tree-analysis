In the code, there's a model_names dictionary that maps model types to their respective names. For \"bert\", it's \"bert-base-uncased\". Then, under the if condition for model_type == \"bert\", the model is assigned a value with a TODO comment. The other model types (electra and distilbert) have their models initialized with from_pretrained, passing the model_name and num_labels=3. So for BERT, the model should be BertForSequenceClassification loaded from the pretrained model_name with num_labels set to 3, just like the others. The tokenizer is already using BertTokenizer correctly. Therefore, the missing line for the BERT model should be:\n\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=3) That's the same pattern as the other model initializations. The key point is to make sure the num_labels is set to 3 for MNLI, which has three classes.",
