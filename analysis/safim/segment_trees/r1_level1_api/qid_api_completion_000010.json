Wait, how does GMP handle division by powers of two? Oh right, there's a function called mpz_tdiv_q_2exp. That does truncating division by 2^exp. So the idea is to apply that function to the value and store the result in ret. The current code initializes ret as an mpz_class. The missing line should call mpz_tdiv_q_2exp, right? The parameters for that function are the destination, the source, and the exponent. Since we're using mpz_class, we can get the internal mpz_t using get_mpz_t(). So the line would be something like mpz_tdiv_q_2exp(ret.get_mpz_t(), value.get_mpz_t(), exp);. That should compute value divided by 2^exp and assign it to ret. Let me check the function signature again. The function is static in the GMP library. Yes, using mpz_tdiv_q_2exp is correct here.",
