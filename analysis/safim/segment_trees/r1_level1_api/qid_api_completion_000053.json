Looking at the existing code, after creating the User object, the line is String json = /* TODO: Your code here */;. So the missing part is using Gson's toJson method. The Gson instance is already initialized as gson. So the correct code should be gson.toJson(user);. That's straightforward. Let me check if there's anything else. The other parts of the code use fromJson for deserialization, but here it's toJson. Yeah, that's right. The rest of the code seems okay.
