    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user provided Python code and mentioned that there's a missing part in the plotting section. The task is to fill in the missing code. The TODO comment says \"Plotting word embeddings\" and the code after that needs to be completed.\n\nLooking at the existing code, after applying PCA to the word vectors, they create transformed_vectors. Then they use plt.scatter to plot the points. Then there's a loop where for each word in the vocabulary, they annotate the point with the word. Then setting the title and showing the plot.\n\nWait, the code after the TODO is already there. Wait, let me check again. The original code provided by the user includes the plt.scatter, the for loop with annotate, plt.title, and plt.show(). So why is there a TODO there? Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps the code is incomplete. Wait, maybe the code in the original message has the scatter and annotations, but the user wants to see if that's the missing part. Or perhaps the code in the original message is missing those lines, and the user is expecting those to be filled in.\n\nWait, looking at the original code provided by the user, the part after the TODO comment is already filled in. Let me check again. The code as given has:\n\n# Plotting word embeddings\n# TODO: Your code here\nplt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1])\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title('Word Embeddings Visualized with PCA')\nplt.show()\n\nWait, that code is already complete. But the user says to fill in the missing lines. So maybe the code in the original problem actually had the TODO comment but the code below was missing. Because the code provided here has the plt.scatter, the annotations loop, title, and show. So perhaps the user made a mistake in including the solution in the problem. But according to the problem statement, the user is showing the code that has a missing part which needs to be filled in.\n\nWait, maybe the code in the original problem had the TODO line, but the code that follows (the scatter, annotations, etc.) was not present, and the user expects that part to be filled in. But in the code provided, those lines are present. So perhaps the user is testing if the assistant can recognize that the code is already complete. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the code in the problem was missing those lines, and the user is expecting the assistant to provide them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code after the TODO is incomplete. Let me check again. The code after the TODO is:\n\nplt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1])\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title('Word Embeddings Visualized with PCA')\nplt.show()\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user has provided this code, and the assistant needs to fill in the missing part. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem. The user's message says: \"Complete the code in python: [the code here]\". The code includes a TODO comment under the plotting section. So in the code given by the user, the lines after the TODO are part of the code that the user has, but maybe they are commented out or missing. Wait no, looking at the code as presented in the problem statement:\n\nThe code includes:\n\n# Plotting word embeddings\n# TODO: Your code here\nplt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1])\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title('Word Embeddings Visualized with PCA')\nplt.show()\n\nBut the TODO comment is right above these lines. So the code that is provided already includes the correct code. But that's confusing. Unless the code was not present. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the code under the TODO was missing, and the user provided the code that needs to have those lines filled in. However, in the code provided here, the lines are present. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and the code that's supposed to be completed is missing those lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to fill in the code that's already written, but perhaps the user is considering that the code is not complete. But according to the code, the code after the TODO is present. Therefore, perhaps this is a trick question, and there's no missing code. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code that's supposed to be completed is missing the plt.figure(figsize=(...)) line, or some other adjustments. But according to the problem statement, the code as given is supposed to run correctly once the missing lines are added. Since the code as provided by the user already includes the scatter, annotations, title, and show, which are necessary for the plot, then perhaps the code is complete and the user made a mistake in including the TODO comment. However, the problem says to output the missing code. Since the code under the TODO is already present, perhaps the problem is different. Or perhaps the code provided by the user is not the original code but the code after the assistant fills in the missing lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the code after the TODO is missing, and the correct answer is to provide those lines. But in the code as presented, those lines are present.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included the code with the TODO comment, but the code after it is part of their question, and the assistant is supposed to confirm that the code is correct. But that's not the case. The problem says that the code has missing lines or blocks that must be filled in. The assistant must output only the missing code.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the code in the problem statement has a missing block where the TODO is. But looking at the code provided, after the TODO comment, the code is already there. So this is confusing. Unless the user made a formatting error when pasting the code. For example, maybe the code after the TODO is not present in the original code, and the user's code stops at the TODO. But in the code provided here, the code after the TODO is present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct as is, and there's no missing code. But the user says that there's missing code. Hmm. Maybe the code under the TODO is missing, and the user provided the correct code. So in that case, the missing code is the lines that are already written. But the problem says that the code has missing lines, and the assistant must fill them in. Therefore, the assistant's answer should be those lines.\n\nSo, assuming that the code provided by the user has the TODO comment but the lines after are missing, then the missing code would be:\n\nplt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1])\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title('Word Embeddings Visualized with PCA')\nplt.show()\n\nBut since the user's code already has these lines, perhaps this is a mistake. However, given the problem statement, the assistant's job is to output the missing code. In this scenario, the missing code is the code that's written under the TODO comment. Hence, the user's code has the TODO comment, and the lines below are missing, so the assistant needs to provide those lines.\n\nBut why would the user present the code with those lines if they are missing? Maybe it's a formatting error. For example, in the problem statement, the code might have the TODO comment and the code after is not present, but in the user's message here, the code after is present. Therefore, the assistant needs to check carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code under the TODO is present, but the user is expecting that the code is not, and the assistant should provide it. So the correct answer would be those lines.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the code that plots the scatter plot, adds annotations, sets the title, and displays the plot. So the code to be filled in is:\n\nplt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1])\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title('Word Embeddings Visualized with PCA')\nplt.show()\n\nBut since the user's code already includes these lines after the TODO, perhaps there's a mistake. However, given the problem as presented, the assistant's task is to output the missing code. So the answer should be those lines."
