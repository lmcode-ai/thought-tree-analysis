    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let me look at the code provided. The user is asking me to fill in the missing part where the TODO is. The code is about time series analysis using ARIMA and SARIMAX models.\n\nFirst, the existing code for the ARIMA model diagnostics plot. The user has set up a figure with two subplots. The first subplot (211) is for the ARIMA predictions, and the second (212) for diagnostics. But after setting the titles, there's a plt.show() comment. Wait, the TODO is right before plt.show(), so maybe they need to add something in between.\n\nWait, the code as written after the diagnostics plot has:\n\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n# TODO: Your code here\nplt.show()\n\nWait, but the plot_diagnostics() function from ARIMA results usually generates four plots in a grid. But here, the user is using subplot(212) which suggests they want the diagnostics in the second subplot of a 2-row, 1-column figure. However, the plot_diagnostics() creates its own figure by default, which might not be part of the subplots here. That could be a problem. Wait, maybe the code as written is incorrect, and the missing part is adjusting the layout to prevent overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing code is creating two subplots: the first for predictions, the second for diagnostics. But the way the subplots are set up might not be correct. Because the ARIMA plot_diagnostics() function actually creates four plots (standardized residual, histogram plus KDE, Q-Q plot, and correlogram), which are typically arranged in a 2x2 grid. But here, they are trying to put all of those into a single subplot (212), which isn't possible. So this is a mistake in the original code. But the user hasn't noticed that and is asking to complete the code. Wait, but the user's TODO is after the subplot(212) and the plot_diagnostics() call. So maybe the original code is incorrect, but the user expects the assistant to fix it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current code creates two subplots, but the ARIMA diagnostics plot is overwriting the second subplot. Because when you call plot_diagnostics(), it creates a new figure unless you specify a figure. So the code as written would have the first subplot (211) in a figure, then the second subplot (212) would be for the diagnostics, but when plot_diagnostics() is called, it creates a new figure, which would leave the second subplot empty. That would be a problem. So the user's code has an error here. But the task is to fill in the missing code, not to correct existing code.\n\nWait, but the user's code is as given. The TODO is right before plt.show(). The current code has:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(start=1, end=100)\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n# TODO: Your code here\nplt.show()\n\nWait, the plot_predict is in subplot 211, and the plot_diagnostics is in subplot 212. But when you call arima_results.plot_diagnostics(), that function itself creates a new figure. So the code as written would actually create two figures: one with the two subplots (but the diagnostics part is not showing correctly), and another figure from the plot_diagnostics() function. So this is a mistake. However, the user might not realize that and expects the code to work as is. But the TODO is to fill in missing code here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that after plotting the two subplots, there's a need to adjust the layout. So maybe the missing line is plt.tight_layout() to prevent overlapping. Because when you create subplots, sometimes the titles or labels overlap, and tight_layout() adjusts the spacing. The TODO comment is placed right before plt.show(), so adding plt.tight_layout() there would make sense. That's a common step.\n\nSo the missing code is probably plt.tight_layout(). Because in the current code, after setting up the two subplots, the code may have overlapping elements. Adding tight_layout would adjust the spacing. That's a common thing to do before showing the plot. So the line to add is plt.tight_layout().\n\nAnother possibility is that the code is trying to plot the ARIMA diagnostics in the subplot, but the plot_diagnostics() method doesn't use the current axes. So the existing code for subplot(212) is not working. But the user might not be aware of that. However, the task is to complete the existing code, not to fix errors. But the TODO is after the title is set. The code as written would set the title, then the TODO line, then show the plot. So maybe the code is missing a line to actually plot something, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the code needs to save the figure or add a legend, but that's not indicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to add a line to save the figure, but the problem says to output the missing code so that the program runs correctly. The existing code would run, but the ARIMA diagnostics plot would appear in a separate figure. But perhaps the intention is to have the two subplots (predictions and diagnostics) in the same figure. However, the way the code is written, the plot_diagnostics() is called on the second subplot, but that function creates its own figure. Thus, the existing code is incorrect. But the user's code is as given, and the assistant is to fill in the missing code. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the ARIMA plot_diagnostics() function can take a figure parameter. Looking at the documentation, the plot_diagnostics() method of ARIMAResults has a figure parameter. So perhaps to plot the diagnostics into the existing subplot, but that's not possible because the diagnostics consist of four plots, which are arranged in a 2x2 grid. So trying to plot them into a single subplot (212) is impossible. Therefore, the original code is flawed, but the user may not realize that. But the assistant's task is to fill the missing code, not to correct existing code. However, the code as written would not work correctly. The TODO is placed where it is, so maybe the intended code is to adjust the layout with plt.tight_layout(). So adding that line before plt.show().\n\nSo the missing line is plt.tight_layout()."
