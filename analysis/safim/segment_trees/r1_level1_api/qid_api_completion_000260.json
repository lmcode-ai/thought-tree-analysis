Because if freqs is (seq_len, dim//2), then cat along dim=-1 would make it (seq_len, dim). But each theta_i is used for two consecutive dimensions. For example, if theta_0 is for the first two dimensions, theta_1 for next two, etc. So, in that case, we need to interleave them. Wait, no. Let's think. If freqs is [ [theta_0, theta_1, theta_2, ... theta_{d/2-1} ] for each position ], then when you repeat each element twice, you get [theta_0, theta_0, theta_1, theta_1, ...].

For a single position, freqs would be [a, b]. Then, repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1) would give [a, a, b, b]. Which is correct. But another way: if you do freqs.view(sequence_length, -1, 1).expand(-1, -1, 2).reshape(sequence_length, -1), that would also give the same result. Alternatively, using torch.repeat_interleave is more straightforward. So, the correct line is embeddings = freqs.repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to fill in the missing code for the embeddings variable in the Wav2Vec2ConformerRotaryPositionalEmbedding class's forward method. The code is supposed to generate rotary positional embeddings.\n\nLooking at the surrounding code: they're using einops for einsum operations. The inv_freq is already calculated as the inverse frequencies. Then, time_stamps are generated using torch.arange for the sequence length. The line before the TODO is freqs = torch.einsum(\"i,j->ij\", time_stamps, self.inv_freq). So freqs is a matrix where each element is time_stamp[i] * inv_freq[j]. \n\nNow, the next step is to create embeddings by combining these frequencies. For rotary embeddings, typically you create a concatenation of the sine and cosine of the angles, but here they might be interleaving or stacking them. Wait, in the code after, they split into cos and sin embeddings. So maybe the embeddings variable is a concatenation of the freqs and some phase shift?\n\nWait, looking at the original rotary positional embeddings (like in RoFormer), the usual approach is to compute the rotation using cos and sin for each dimension. But how is that structured here? The freqs tensor is of shape (sequence_length, dim/2) because inv_freq was created with step=2, so dim is halved. Wait, when they initialized inv_freq, they used step=2 and dim = hidden_size // num_heads. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn __init__, dim is config.hidden_size // config.num_attention_heads. Then step is 2. So inv_freq is computed as (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, step).float() / dim)) inverse. So the length of inv_freq is dim / 2. Because stepping by 2 from 0 to dim gives dim/2 elements. For example, if dim is 128, then indices 0, 2, 4,...,126, which is 64 elements.\n\nSo the inv_freq has shape (dim//2,), and when we do the einsum i,j->ij between time_stamps (shape (seq_len,)) and inv_freq (shape (dim//2,)), the result freqs is (seq_len, dim//2). \n\nThen, the next step is to create embeddings by interleaving sin and cos for each of these frequencies. Wait, in rotary embeddings, each dimension is paired. So for each position, the embedding for dimension i is [freqs_i * pos, freqs_i * pos], but arranged in a way that when multiplied with the query and key vectors, the rotation is applied. So perhaps here, they are creating a tensor that alternates between the freqs and the same freqs, but then concatenated or stacked.\n\nWait, the standard approach is to compute for each dimension i, a rotation angle theta_i = pos * inv_freq_i. Then, for each pair of dimensions (2j, 2j+1), apply a rotation matrix. This is typically done by creating a complex number where the even indices are cos(theta) and the odd are sin(theta), multiplied by the original vector's components. \n\nBut in the code here, after calculating freqs (which is theta = pos * inv_freq), the next step is to create embeddings which are then split into cos and sin parts. Let's see:\n\nembeddings is used to compute cos_embeddings and sin_embeddings by taking the cosine and sine of embeddings. Then, these are stacked as [cos_embeddings, sin_embeddings]. Wait, but in the code, after creating cos_embeddings and sin_embeddings, they stack them into a tensor of shape [2, seq_len, 1, 1, dim]. Wait, looking at the code:\n\ncos_embeddings = embeddings.cos()[:, None, None, :]\nsin_embeddings = embeddings.sin()[:, None, None, :]\nThen, they stack them as torch.stack([cos_embeddings, sin_embeddings]). So the resulting tensor is of shape (2, seq_len, 1, 1, dim//2). Wait, no, wait. The original embeddings must be of shape (seq_len, dim). Because cos_embeddings is (seq_len, 1, 1, dim//2) after the [:, None, None, :] indexing, which adds two singleton dimensions. Then stacking them gives [2, seq_len, 1, 1, dim//2]. But how?\n\nWait, let's think: the code's embeddings variable is used to compute cos and sin. So for each element in embeddings (which is a frequency multiplied by position), we take cos and sin, then interleave them. Wait, no. Let me think again. For rotary positional embeddings, each pair of dimensions in the key and query vectors are rotated by an angle theta. The rotation is done by multiplying the key and query vectors by a rotation matrix. So for a 2D vector [x, y], the rotated vector is [x cos(theta) - y sin(theta), x sin(theta) + y cos(theta)]. \n\nIn the rotary embedding, the theta is determined by the position. To apply this, each pair of dimensions in the key and query vectors is rotated by theta_i, where theta_i is computed as position * inv_freq_i. \n\nBut how to represent this in the embeddings. The standard approach is to create a tensor where each element is theta_i for each dimension pair. Then, when applied, each pair is rotated by theta_i. \n\nBut in the code here, the freqs tensor is of shape (seq_len, dim//2), where dim is the original dimension (since we took dim = hidden_size // num_heads). Then, perhaps the embeddings should be a tensor of shape (seq_len, dim), where each element is theta_i for each dimension. But since we have dim//2 frequencies (because inv_freq was created with step=2), each frequency is used for two dimensions. \n\nWait, maybe the embeddings need to be a tensor where each element is theta_i, repeated for each pair of dimensions. For example, if the original hidden dimension is 128, then dim is 128 / num_heads (assuming num_attention_heads is a divisor). Then, inv_freq is of size 64 (if step=2). Then, each frequency is used for two dimensions. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is creating a freqs tensor of shape (seq_len, dim//2), and then they interleave these values to create a tensor of shape (seq_len, dim). For example, for each position, the embeddings for the dimensions would be [freq1, freq1, freq2, freq2, ...], so that each pair of dimensions uses the same frequency. Then, when taking cosine and sine, the embeddings are applied to each pair. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the embeddings are created by concatenating the freqs with themselves, but with a shift, or by interleaving. Wait, in the code, after computing freqs as (seq_len, dim//2), perhaps the embeddings are created by tiling the freqs along the last dimension, but interleaved. So that for each position, the embeddings for the dimensions are [freq[0], freq[0], freq[1], freq[1], ...]. \n\nBut how to do that? One way is to repeat each element in the last dimension twice. So for a tensor of shape (seq_len, dim//2), after repeating each element twice along the last dimension, the shape becomes (seq_len, dim). \n\nSo, for example, if dim is 4 (hidden_size is 4, num_attention_heads is 1), then inv_freq would be of size 2. Then freqs for each position would be two elements. Then embeddings would be each of those elements repeated once, so the embeddings for that position would be [freq1, freq1, freq2, freq2]. \n\nSo, the code for embeddings would be to repeat each element in the last dimension twice. That can be done using repeat_interleave. So, embeddings = freqs.repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1). \n\nWait, but why? Because each inv_freq element corresponds to a pair of dimensions. So when you compute theta for each pair, you need to apply the same theta to each pair. Hence, in the embeddings, each theta is repeated twice. \n\nSo, in code, after freqs is of shape (seq_len, dim//2), then embeddings = freqs.repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1). That would make embeddings of shape (seq_len, dim). Then, when you take cos and sin, you get for each element in the embeddings (each theta) the cos and sin, which can then be stacked. \n\nWait, but in the code, after embeddings is computed, they take cos_embeddings and sin_embeddings as cos(embeddings) and sin(embeddings). Then, those are reshaped to (seq_len, 1, 1, dim) and stacked along a new dimension, resulting in a tensor of shape (2, seq_len, 1, 1, dim). \n\nSo, the key line is that embeddings is freqs repeated twice along the last dimension. So each theta_i is repeated twice, so that when you take cos and sin, each pair of dimensions in the hidden state can be rotated using the same theta. \n\nThus, the missing code line should be:\n\nembeddings = torch.cat([freqs, freqs], dim=-1)\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if freqs is (seq_len, dim//2), then cat along dim=-1 would make it (seq_len, dim). But each theta_i is used for two consecutive dimensions. For example, if theta_0 is for the first two dimensions, theta_1 for next two, etc. So, in that case, we need to interleave them. Wait, no. Let's think. If freqs is [ [theta_0, theta_1, theta_2, ... theta_{d/2-1} ] for each position ], then when you repeat each element twice, you get [theta_0, theta_0, theta_1, theta_1, ...]. So using repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1) would achieve that. Whereas concatenating [freqs, freqs] would produce [theta_0, theta_1, ..., theta_0, theta_1, ...], which is not correct. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to use repeat_interleave. So embeddings = freqs.repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1). \n\nBut let's test with a small example. Let's say dim is 4 (so inv_freq is size 2). For a single position, freqs would be [a, b]. Then, repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1) would give [a, a, b, b]. Which is correct. \n\nBut another way: if you do freqs.view(sequence_length, -1, 1).expand(-1, -1, 2).reshape(sequence_length, -1), that would also give the same result. \n\nAlternatively, using torch.repeat_interleave is more straightforward. \n\nSo, the correct line is embeddings = freqs.repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1). \n\nTherefore, the missing code should assign embeddings to this tensor. \n\nLet me double-check. The code after this line uses cos and sin on embeddings. Then, these are reshaped and stacked. So the embeddings need to be of shape (seq_len, dim) where dim is the original dimension (hidden_size // num_heads). \n\nYes. So the correct code is:\n\nembeddings = torch.cat((freqs, freqs), dim=-1)\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, if freqs is (seq_len, dim//2), then cat along dim=-1 (the last dimension) would produce (seq_len, dim). But in that case, the first dim//2 elements are the original freqs, and the next dim//2 are the same. So, for example, if dim is 4, then after cat, it's [theta0, theta1, theta0, theta1]. That's not correct. Because each pair should be [theta0, theta0, theta1, theta1]. \n\nAh, right. So using repeat_interleave is the correct approach here, as it repeats each element in the last dimension twice. So the code should be:\n\nembeddings = freqs.repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1)\n\nSo that each theta_i is repeated twice. For example, if freqs is [a, b], then after repeat_interleave(2, -1), it becomes [a, a, b, b]. \n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is embeddings = freqs.repeat_interleave(2, dim=-1)."
