The line after the TODO is creating a variate_generator called uni, which combines the generator and the distribution. The problem is that the distribution hasn't been declared yet. So the missing line should declare the distribution. The distribution type here is boost::uniform_real, which for the range [0,1) would be default constructed, right? Because the default parameters for boost::uniform_real are min 0 and max 1.
