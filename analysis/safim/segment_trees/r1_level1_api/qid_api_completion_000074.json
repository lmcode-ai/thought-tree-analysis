The existing code adds \"Apple\" twice with bag.add(\"Apple\", 2);. The TODO comment says to add \"Banana\" once. So, I need to figure out the correct syntax for adding an element to a Bag from Apache Commons Collections. The Bag interface has an add method that can take an object and the count. Since they want to add \"Banana\" once, the count should be 1. The line should be bag.add(\"Banana\", 1);. That's straightforward. I just need to make sure there's a semicolon at the end.",
