So where x is greater than 0, the derivative is 1, else 0. Wait, but what about the case when x is exactly zero? Well, ReLU's derivative at zero is sometimes considered 0 or 1, but in practice, using 0 for x <=0 is common. So using np.where(x > 0, 1.0, 0.0) should work. So the line should be return np.where(x > 0, 1.0, 0.0). Let me check. Yes, that should correctly compute the derivative of ReLU.",
