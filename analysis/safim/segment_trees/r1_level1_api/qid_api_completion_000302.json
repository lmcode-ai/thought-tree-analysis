The function uses a dictionary model_names to map model_type to the correct model name. Then, for each model_type, it initializes the model and tokenizer. For 'bert', it uses BertForSequenceClassification with num_labels=3. For 'distilbert', it's similar but with DistilBert classes. The tokenizer for Electra is already set to ElectraTokenizer, but the model part is missing. So, the line under the 'electra' condition is incomplete. The model should be ElectraForSequenceClassification. Since the other models are initialized with from_pretrained with model_name and num_labels=3, Electra should follow the same pattern. The correct code would be ElectraForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=3). I need to make sure that the Electra model is loaded with the right parameters. The tokenizer is already handled. The missing line is initializing the model for Electra. So the code should be model = ElectraForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=3).",
