    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let me look at the code provided. The user is working on a Python script for time series analysis using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. The task is to fill in the missing code for plotting the ARIMA model diagnostics.\n\nLooking at the existing code, there's a TODO comment where the plotting code should be. The current code after the comment sets up two subplots. The first subplot (211) uses arima_results.plot_predict to show predictions from start 1 to end 100, then sets the title. The second subplot (212) is supposed to plot the diagnostics. \n\nWait, the ARIMA model's results object has a plot_diagnostics() method. So the line after plt.subplot(212) should call arima_results.plot_diagnostics(). Then set the title for that subplot. The existing code does have that. So the code under the TODO comment is already written? But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original code has the plt.subplot(211) and plt.subplot(212) calls. Then for the first subplot, they plot predictions, and for the second, diagnostics. But maybe the order is different. Also, the user might have missed setting up the figure or the subplots correctly. Wait, no. The code as provided in the problem shows that the missing part is where the TODO is. The existing code under the TODO comment is part of the correct answer, but perhaps the user didn't include it. Wait, no. The problem states that the code has missing lines or blocks that must be filled in. The user's existing code in the problem includes the lines after the TODO comment, but maybe they are incomplete or incorrect? Or perhaps the actual code in the problem does not include those lines, and the user is supposed to fill them in.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The user provided code with a TODO, and the solution is to fill in the missing code. The code given under the TODO comment in the problem is actually part of the correct answer. But the problem says to complete the code, so perhaps the lines after the TODO are not present in the original code and need to be added. Let me check the original code again.\n\nIn the problem, the code after the TODO comment is:\n\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(start=1, end=100)\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says that the code has missing lines that must be filled in. So perhaps in the original code given to the assistant, the lines after the TODO are missing. Therefore, the correct answer is to write those lines. But looking at the code, the part that's missing would be the plotting code. So the assistant needs to output the code that creates the two subplots, plots the predictions and diagnostics, sets titles, and calls tight_layout and show.\n\nWait, but the code in the problem after the TODO comment is already present. So why is there a TODO? Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps the code is incomplete. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the figure isn't created properly. For example, before creating subplots, you usually create a figure. But in the given code, there's no plt.figure() call. However, when using subplot, if no figure exists, matplotlib creates one automatically, so maybe it's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order of the subplots is incorrect. The first subplot is 211 (2 rows, 1 column, first position), and the second is 212. That would stack them vertically. That makes sense. So the code under the TODO is correct. But why is the user asking to fill it in then? Unless in the original code provided, those lines are missing. So the correct answer is to write those lines exactly as they are. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(start=1, end=100)\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nBut wait, the user's code may have the subplot numbers reversed. For example, if the first plot is 211 (row 2, column 1, position 1) and the second is 212 (row 2, column 1, position 2), but when creating subplots in a 2-row layout, perhaps the first subplot is 211 (top) and the second is 212 (bottom). So the code is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the start and end parameters for plot_predict are incorrect. But the problem doesn't specify, so we can assume the code provided is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code to fill in is the lines starting from plt.subplot(211) up to plt.show(), which are already written. However, perhaps in the problem, those lines are not present and need to be added. So the user's TODO is to write that code. The assistant should output that code as the missing part. \n\nSo the correct answer is the code that sets up the subplots, plots the predictions and diagnostics, adds titles, and displays the plots. The code given in the problem under the TODO comment is correct, so that's what needs to be filled in."
