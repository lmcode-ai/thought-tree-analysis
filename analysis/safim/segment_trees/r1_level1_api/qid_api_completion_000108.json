That line is supposed to serialize the person object into a JSON string. The code uses Newtonsoft. Json, so the correct method is JsonConvert. SerializeObject. The person variable is already created and initialized. So the missing line should be:\n\nstring json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(person); Wait, but there's another part later where they use settings with null value handling. But in the first serialization, there's no settings specified. So the correct code is just calling SerializeObject with the person instance. That's straightforward. I don't see any other parameters needed there. So the answer is to write JsonConvert.SerializeObject(person).",
