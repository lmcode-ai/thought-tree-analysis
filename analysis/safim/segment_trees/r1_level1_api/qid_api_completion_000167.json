The line is supposed to print the first few rows of the dataset. In Python, when using pandas, the DataFrame has a method called head() which returns the first n rows. The default is 5, so maybe the code uses that. The existing print line is:\n\nprint(# TODO: Your code here) So they need to replace the comment with data.head(), right? Because data is the DataFrame loaded from pd.read_csv. The first few rows are usually displayed with head(). Let me check if there's any other possibility, but I think that's it. So the correct code would be print(data.head()).",
