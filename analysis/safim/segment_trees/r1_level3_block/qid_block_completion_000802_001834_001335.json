So if we have already taken [0..i] and [j..n-1], then we cannot take [0..i+1] and [j..n-1] because that would include the candy i+1 and then we have to see if Bob can give up some? But Bob's part is fixed? Actually, the standard solution for this problem (which is known) is:\n\n   i = 0, j = n-1\n   lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n   best = 0\n   while i <= j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            rsum += arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1 - j)   # because we haven't added the current i and j? Actually, we are about to add? But note: the provided code starts with lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1]. Then the pointers are at 0 and n-1. Then the while loop condition is i<j.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n   i = -1, j = n\n   best = 0\n   while i < j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because from 0 to i (i+1) and from j to n-1 (n-j)\n            i += 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n\nBut the provided code starts with the first and last already taken. So in the provided code, we have:\n\n   i=0, j=n-1\n   lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1] Then we enter the while loop (i<j). We have three cases:\n\n   Case 1: lsum < rsum -> then we move i to the right: i += 1, and add arr[i] to lsum. Case 2: rsum < lsum -> then we should move j to the left: j -= 1, and add arr[j] to rsum. Case 3: equal -> then we set best = i + (n-1-j) + 2? Actually, as we calculated: total = (i+1) + (n - j) = i+1 + n - j = i + n - j + 1. But the code does: i + (n-1-j) + 2 = i + n - 1 - j + 2 = i + n - j + 1 -> same. Then after setting best, we move the left pointer: i += 1, and add arr[i] to lsum. But why only move the left? Why not move the right? Or why not move both?",

Why? \n\n   Let me run the provided code (with the missing part filled) for [1,2,3]:\n\n        n=3, arr=[1,2,3]\n\n        i=0, j=2\n        lsum=1, rsum=3\n        while i<j: \n            lsum(1) < rsum(3) -> i becomes 1, lsum = 1+2 = 3. Now i=1, j=2: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> set best = 1 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 1 + (0) + 2 = 3? Then i becomes 2, lsum = 3+3=6 -> now i=2, j=2 -> break. Then we print best=3. But the problem note says the answer for the third test case is 0? This is a contradiction. I see: the problem note says: \n        \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n   But wait, the third test case in the input example is actually: \n        n=3, [1,2,3] -> but the problem note says the third test case is the one with n=3 and the array [1,2,3]? However, the problem note also says: \n        \"For the fourth test case, ... answer is 7\"\n\n   And the fourth test case: n=4? but the input has n=7? Actually, the problem note says:\n\n        \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7\" So the array for the fourth test case: [7,3,20, ... ,10,8,11,1] -> and the array has 7 elements: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]? Then the input:\n\n        t=4\n        n=1: [10] -> test1\n        n=6: [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> test2 -> answer=6\n        n=3: [1,2,3] -> test3 -> answer=3? but the note says 0? n=7: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> test4 -> answer=7\n\n   But the problem note says the third test case has answer 0? I think there is a mistake in the problem note. The third test case in the note is actually the first test case? Alternatively, the third test case in the input is not [1,2,3] but something else?",

Given the confusion, we trust the algorithm: We have two pointers. We start with the first candy for Alice and the last for Bob. We move the pointers until they meet. When the sums are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (i+1 from the left and n-j from the right) and then we move the left pointer? But the known solution for \"Two Candies\" (or similar) is:\n\n        best = 0 left_sum = 0\n        right_sum = 0\n        left = 0\n        right = n-1\n        while left <= right:\n            if left_sum == right_sum:\n                best = left + (n - right - 1)\n            if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                left_sum += arr[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right_sum += arr[right]\n                right -= 1\n        if left_sum == right_sum:\n            best = left + (n - right - 1)\n        print(best) But note: in this solution, we start with 0 on both sides and then add until we meet. However, the provided code in program1.py starts with the first and last already taken. We can either change the algorithm or complete the missing part. Since the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", we must complete the missing part in the provided structure. The provided structure:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = arr[i]\n        rsum = arr[j]\n\n        best = 0\n        while i < j:\n            if lsum < rsum:\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            elif rsum < lsum:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                i += 1\n                if i < j:   # we must check because after i+=1, i might be >=j\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n\n   We need to complete the \"elif rsum < lsum\" block. We should do:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But note: we must be cautious that j might become less than i? The condition is while i<j, so after j-=1, we might break the condition? But the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. So:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n   However, let's test with the sample [1,2,3] (n=3):\n\n        i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=3 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 1, lsum=1+2=3. Then: i=1, j=2: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> enter else: \n            best = 1 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 1 + (0) + 2 = 3 -> then i becomes 2, and then we break because i=2 and j=2 -> i<j fails. Then output 3 -> which is correct. Now test with [10] (n=1):\n\n        i=0, j=0 -> while i<j fails -> output best=0 -> correct. Test with [7,3,20,5,10,5] (n=6) -> the second test case:\n\n        We expect answer=6. How? Alice eats the first three: [7,3,20] = 30\n            Bob eats the last three: [5,10,5] = 20? -> not 30. Wait, the problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\"\n\n        But the array is [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> \n            Alice: [7,3,20] = 30\n            Bob: [5,10,5] = 20 -> not 7. The note says: \"the first three candies from the right\" -> the rightmost three: [5,10,5] -> but that's 20. But the problem says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> meaning the first three he encounters: \n            Bob starts from the right: \n                first candy from the right: 5 (last) second: 10 (second last)\n                third: 5 (third last) -> that's [5,10,5] = 20. How do they get 7? The note says: \"the first three candies from the right\" -> but the array is [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> \n            The rightmost three are [5,10,5] -> 20. I see: the problem note says: \n            \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> meaning the first three as he moves from right to left? But the total weight is 7? Alternatively, the array is: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 5] -> \n            Alice: [7,3,20] = 30\n            Bob: [5,10,5] = 20 -> not 30. How can they both have 30? The problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> 7? But 7+3+20 = 30, not 7. There is a typo in the note: it should be 30. And Bob: [5,10,5] -> 20? But the problem says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that doesn't add up. Actually, the array might be: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 5] -> \n            Bob: the first three from the right: first: 5 (index5) -> 5\n                second: 10 (index4) -> 15\n                third: 5 (index3) -> 20\n\n        How to get 30 for Bob? The problem says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> but then he cannot eat more than three? But the note says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\" -> so they eat all. Then Alice: [7,3,20] = 30, Bob: [5,10,5] = 20 -> not equal. I see: the problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo: it should be 30. \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that should be 20? But then they are not equal. The sample input in the problem note for the second test case: \n            \"s(3) = [7,3,20,5,10,5]\" -> but then the answer is 6 because they eat all? How can they both have the same weight if they eat all? Total = 7+3+20+5+10+5 = 50 -> then each should have 25? But Alice eats the first three: 7+3+20=30, Bob eats the last three: 5+10+5=20 -> 30+20=50, but they are not equal. Alternatively, Alice eats the first two: 7+3=10, Bob eats the last two: 10+5=15 -> not equal. Or Alice eats the first four: 7+3+20+5=35, Bob eats the last two: 10+5=15 -> not equal. Or Alice eats the first one: 7, Bob eats the last one: 5 -> not equal. How about: \n            Alice: [7,3] = 10\n            Bob: [5,5] = 10 -> then they eat 4 candies? But the problem says the answer is 6.",

Alice: [7] = 7, Bob: [5] = 5 -> not equal. Alice: [7,3,20,5] = 35, Bob: [5,10] = 15 -> not equal. Alice: [7,3,20,5,10] = 45, Bob: [5] = 5 -> not equal. So how do they get 6? The problem note says: \"they cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\" -> meaning they eat all, but then the sums must be equal? Only if the total is even? 50 is even, but we need two contiguous parts that meet in the middle and sum to 25 each. Let me check: \n            prefix: [7, 10, 30, 35, 45, 50]\n            suffix: [5, 15, 20, 40, 43, 50]\n\n            Is there an index i such that prefix[i] = 25? -> no.\n            Or suffix[i] = 25? -> no. So how can the answer be 6? I see: the problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo. The array might be different. The sample input in the problem for the second test case: \n            \"3\n            7 3 20 5 10 5\"\n\n        But the first integer is 3? then n=3, and then the array has 3 numbers: [7,3,20]? Then the next test case: n=5,10,5? -> but then we have three test cases? This is a mess. Given the time, we trust the algorithm we are implementing. We'll complete the missing part as:\n\n            elif rsum < lsum:\n                j -= 1\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And hope that the sample [7,3,20,5,10,5] is not used in the judge. But the problem says: the total n over test cases is <=200000, so we can trust the two pointers. We also note that when the sums are equal, we move the left pointer. Why not move the right? Or both? The known solution (from a similar problem) moves one pointer at a time. We'll do as the structure. Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But note: we must be cautious that j might be out of bounds? But we are in the while i<j, and j starts at n-1. When we do j-=1, j becomes at least i? But we are in the loop and the condition is i<j, so j is at least i+1. Then j-1 is at least i, so it's safe. Now, for program2.py:\n\n   The problem: \n        We are given an integer n. We form a string s = \"BAN\" repeated n times.",

The first block we already did separately. The blocks are indexed from 0 to n-1. We want to swap the second character of the (k+1)-th block (which is at 3*(k+1)+1+1? in 1-indexed) -> actually, the second character of the (k+1)-th block (0-indexed block index = k+1) is at 3*(k+1) + 1 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed: 3*(k+1)+2? But wait, 0-indexed:\n                        block0: indices 0,1,2 -> second character at index1 -> 1-indexed: 2.\n                        block1: indices 3,4,5 -> second character at index4 -> 1-indexed: 5.\n                        block2: indices 6,7,8 -> second character at index7 -> 1-indexed: 8. And the last character of the (n-1 - (k+1))-th block? For the last block (block2) in n=3: \n                            last character: index8 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed:9. For the block before the last: block1: last character: index5 -> 1-indexed:6. But we want to swap the second character of the (k+1)-th block with the last character of the (n-1 - (k+1))-th block? For k=0 in the for loop (for n=3, t-1=1, so k=0):\n                        i = 3*(k+1) + 2? -> 3*1+2 = 5 (1-indexed) -> which is the second character of the second block (block1). j = 3*n - 3*(k+1) ? -> 9 - 3 = 6? -> but we want to swap with the last character of the last block? which is 9. Alternatively, we want to swap with the last character of the (n-1 - k) block? The block index for the partner of block (k+1) is n-2 - k? For the second block (k+1=1) in n=3: we want to swap with the last block (block2) -> which is block index = 2 = n-1. But the formula for even was: \n                        for block k: swap with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block? In even: \n                        k from 0 to t-1: \n                            i = 3*k+2\n                            j = 3*n - 3*k   # because the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block: the (n-1-k)-th block starts at 3*(n-1-k) and the last character is at 3*(n-1-k)+2 -> 1-indexed: 3*(n-1-k)+3? But the code for even: \n                        j = (p*3) - (k*3)   # p is n\n\n                    For n=2, k=0: j = 6 - 0 = 6 -> which is the last character of the last block. For the second block in an even of n=2: \n                        k=0: second character of block0: 3*0+2 = 2, and last character of block1: 3*2 - 0 = 6. So for the for loop in the odd case (for the remaining t-1 operations), we can use the same formula as even but for k from 0 to t-2, and the blocks we are considering are from the second block to the middle? Specifically, we can do:\n\n                        for k in range(t-1):\n                            i_index = (k+1)*3 + 2   # but wait, for k=0: 1*3+2=5 -> which is the second character of the second block? j_index = (p*3) - (k*3)   # for n=3, k=0: 9 - 0 = 9 -> the last character. But then we swap (5,9) for n=3 -> which is what we want. However, for the next k (if any) in a larger odd n, say n=5: \n                        t = 5//2+1 = 3\n                        first operation: swap(1,2)\n                        then for k in range(2): \n                            k=0: swap( (0+1)*3+2 = 5, 15 - 0 = 15)\n                            k=1: swap( (1+1)*3+2 = 8, 15 - 3 = 12)\n\n                    What are these?\n                        Block0: indices 1,2,3 -> we swapped 1 and 2 -> so block0 becomes A,B,N? -> but we don't care about the content for the formula, we are just swapping. Block1: indices 4,5,6 -> second character: index5 -> swap with index15 (the last character of the last block, block4: indices 13,14,15 -> last is 15)\n                    Block2: indices 7,8,9 -> second character: index8 -> swap with index12 (which is the last character of block3: indices 10,11,12 -> last is 12)",

Initially, n has a factors of 2 and b factors of 5. Then we can multiply by 2 or 5 to balance? The code does:\n                If a > b: we need more 5s -> so we multiply by 5 as long as we can (without exceeding m) and update t_val (which is the multiplier we are building) and b (so that we count the new 5s). Similarly, if b > a: we need more 2s -> so we multiply by 2 as long as we can. Then, after balancing, we can multiply by 10 as long as we can? But note: 10=2*5, so we can only multiply by 10 if we have balanced factors? Then we set k = the largest multiple of t_val that is <= m. The missing part: \n            elif b > a:\n                while b > a and 2 * t_val <= m:\n                    # we multiply by 2\n                    t_val *= 2\n                    a += 1   # because we are adding one factor of 2\n\n        But note: we are adding one factor of 2 per multiplication. Example: \n            n=5, m=43: \n                n=5: a=0, b=1 -> b>a.\n                Then we do: while 1>0 and 2*1<=43 -> true: \n                        t_val = 1*2 = 2, a=1 -> now a==b? then we break. Then we do: while 10*t_val<=43? 10*2=20<=43 -> true: then t_val=20. Then again: 10*20=200>43 -> break. Then k = 43 - (43 % 20) = 43 - 3 = 40. Then n*k = 5*40 = 200 -> which has two trailing zeros. But the note says: the maximum price multiple of 100 would be 5*40=200 -> so that matches. Another example: \n            n=13, m=5: \n                n=13: a=0, b=0 -> so we skip the if and elif. Then we do: while 10*1<=5? false -> so t_val=1. Then k = 5 - (5%1)=5-0=5 -> n*k=65. The note says: output 65. Example: n=6, m=11:\n                n=6: 6=2^1 * 3 -> a=1, b=0. Then we are in a>0: \n                    while 1>0 and 5*1<=11 -> true: \n                        t_val=5, b=1 -> now a==b? then we break. Then we do: while 10*5=50<=11? false -> so t_val=5. Then k = 11 - (11%5) = 11-1=10 -> n*k=60. The note says: 60. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n            t_val *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n   But note: the variable name: we are using t_val (the variable in the code is t, but the problem uses t for test cases, so we must not use t? Actually, the code uses t_val as the multiplier base, and the variable is named `t` in the provided code? Looking at the provided code:\n\n        t = 1   # our result should be a multiple of t Then in the if block: \n            while ...:\n                t *= 5\n                ... Then in the missing elif block:\n\n            while ...:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then: \n            while 10 * t <= m:\n                t *= 10\n\n        So the variable is named `t`. Therefore, the missing code in the elif block is:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n   But note: the condition in the while loop: \n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n\n        So we do:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n   This will reduce the difference (b - a) by one? because we are adding one factor of 2. We do this until either a becomes equal to b or we cannot multiply by 2 without exceeding m.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\n   But note: the code is inside the while loop, so we do it repeatedly. Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format. Summary:\n\n        program1: \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n        program2: \"print( ( (k+1)*3 + 2, (p*3) - (k*3) ))\"\n        program3: \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   However, note that in program1, the code block for the elif might be:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j] But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the two lines of code. Similarly, for program2, the missing code is one line. For program3, the missing code is two lines. We output as JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"print( ( (k+1)*3 + 2, (p*3) - (k*3) )) \",\n            \"program3\": \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 code: the expression (p*3) - (k*3) -> we use p (which is the input n) and k (the loop variable). And in program3, the variable names are as in the provided code. We write the code exactly as it should appear. However, in program1, the provided code has an indentation of 8 spaces for the block inside the elif? We output the same indentation? The problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information. \"\n\n   We output the exact code that would replace the TODO. For program1, the TODO is in the elif block, and we have two lines. We output:\n\n        \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n   The next line after the elif condition is currently a comment, so we replace the comment and the next lines until the block is complete? But the problem says the missing block. We only output the two lines of code that should be there. Similarly for the others.",

But the even part: for the k-th block, the partner is the (p-1-k)-th block? Then the last character of that block: 3*(p-1-k)+2 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed: 3*(p-1-k)+3 = 3*p - 3*k. So the same formula: 3*p - 3*k.",

But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the surrounding. Since the if block has:\n\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n   and the else block has:\n\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n   So the indentation is 8 spaces (or one level of 4 and then the block is 8). We output:\n\n        \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n   The \"\\n        \" means: newline and then 8 spaces. Similarly, for program3, the missing code is two lines, and the while loop body is indented. The original:\n\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace with:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1 So we output: \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   But note: the while loop body should be indented. The original code uses 4 spaces per level? The surrounding:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\n   So the body is two lines, each indented by 4 more spaces? But the TODO is at the same level. So we output the two lines without extra indentation? Actually, the code we are replacing is at the same level as the comment. We output:\n\n        \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   But the while loop is already indented (the while line is indented by 4, then the body should be 8). However, the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines of the body, and we assume they will be placed at the same indentation level as the comment. Therefore, we output the two lines without any extra spaces? But the program3 code we are to complete has:\n\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1 So we output: \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   But note: the while loop body should be indented by 4 more than the while line. So the two lines should be indented by 8 spaces? However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But the original code in the if block (above) has:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1 So we do the same.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code uses two pointers (i from left, j from right) and two running sums (lsum and rsum). The idea is to:\n- Start with lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1].\n- Then, while i < j:\n   - If lsum < rsum, move i to the right and add to lsum.\n   - If rsum < lsum, we should move j to the left and add to rsum? But note: the current code for the rsum < lsum case is missing.\n\nHowever, note the condition: when the two sums are equal, we record the current total candies eaten (which is i+1 from left and n-j from right, so total = (i+1) + (n-j)) and then we move the left pointer (to try to get another equal sum?).\n\nBut the problem: we are to maximize the total number of candies. The note in the problem says: For the fourth test case, Alice eats [7,3,20] (3 candies) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (4 candies) and they both have 30, so total 7 candies.\n\nIn the code, when the sums are equal, we set:\n   best = i + (n-1-j) + 2   [because i and j are indices, and we have eaten i+1 from left and n-j from right? Actually, the left part: from 0 to i (inclusive) -> i+1 candies. The right part: from j to n-1 (inclusive) -> n-j candies. So total = (i+1) + (n-j) = i + n - j + 1. But the code does i + (n-1-j) + 2 = i + n - 1 - j + 2 = i + n - j + 1 -> same.\n\nBut note: after setting best, we then move the left pointer? Why not also move the right? Actually, we can try to extend. However, the problem is that we are allowed to have non-overlapping. The current code only moves the left pointer when equal? That might cause an issue.\n\nBut the sample: \n   n=4, [1,2,3,4]: \n      Initially: i=0, j=3 -> lsum=1, rsum=4 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 1, lsum=1+2=3.\n      Then: lsum=3, rsum=4 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 2, lsum=3+3=6.\n      Then: lsum=6, rsum=4 -> rsum<lsum -> we need to move j? But the code for that case is missing.\n\nSo we must complete the missing part for when rsum < lsum.\n\nWe should do:\n   j -= 1\n   rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we are moving j to the left, so we are including the next candy on the right.\n\nHowever, the initial condition: j starts at n-1, and then we move j to the left? Then we add the new candy at j (which is now j-1) to rsum? Actually, we are moving j to the left and then adding the candy at the new j? That would be the next candy to the left of the current j.\n\nBut the code for the left side does: \n   i += 1\n   lsum += arr[i]\n\nSo for the right side, we should do:\n   j -= 1\n   rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because j might become less than i? The condition is while i < j.\n\nAlso, we must update the best only when the sums are equal? And then we move the left? Why not move both? Actually, the problem says they are independent: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They can eat independently until they meet. But note: if we have an equal sum, we can record that and then try to extend? Actually, we can try to extend by moving the left pointer and then see if we can get another equal sum? But the problem is that we are not allowed to skip. So if we have an equal sum, we can record the total candies eaten so far and then we can try to extend? But note: we are moving the left pointer and then we break the equality? The problem does not require consecutive equal sums? It's one contiguous block from the left and one from the right.\n\nActually, the problem is: we are to choose one contiguous block from the left (by Alice) and one contiguous block from the right (by Bob) such that the total weights are equal and the total candies eaten (the sum of the two blocks) is maximized.\n\nSo the algorithm: two pointers. We start with Alice having only the first candy and Bob having only the last candy. Then we try to balance the two sums by moving the pointers. When the sums are equal, we record the total candies (i+1 + n-j) and then we move the left pointer (to see if we can get a larger total by having more candies? But note: we are moving the left pointer and then we break the equality? Actually, we are trying to see if we can get another equal sum later? But the problem is that we are allowed to have non-overlapping and contiguous from the ends. So we can have multiple equal sums? But we are to maximize the total candies.\n\nHowever, note: when we have an equal sum, we can record that and then we can try to extend? But the problem is that we cannot skip candies. So if we have an equal sum at (i, j), then we can try to move the left pointer and then see if we can get an equal sum again? But that would require Bob to also extend? Actually, no: because we are only allowed to take contiguous from the ends without gaps. So if we have already taken [0..i] and [j..n-1], then we cannot take [0..i+1] and [j..n-1] because that would include the candy i+1 and then we have to see if Bob can give up some? But Bob's part is fixed? \n\nActually, the standard solution for this problem (which is known) is:\n\n   i = 0, j = n-1\n   lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n   best = 0\n   while i <= j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            rsum += arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1 - j)   # because we haven't added the current i and j? Actually, we are about to add? \n\nBut note: the provided code starts with lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1]. Then the pointers are at 0 and n-1. Then the while loop condition is i<j.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n   i = -1, j = n\n   best = 0\n   while i < j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because from 0 to i (i+1) and from j to n-1 (n-j)\n            i += 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n\nBut the provided code starts with the first and last already taken.\n\nSo in the provided code, we have:\n\n   i=0, j=n-1\n   lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n\n   Then we enter the while loop (i<j). \n\n   We have three cases:\n\n   Case 1: lsum < rsum -> then we move i to the right: i += 1, and add arr[i] to lsum.\n\n   Case 2: rsum < lsum -> then we should move j to the left: j -= 1, and add arr[j] to rsum.\n\n   Case 3: equal -> then we set best = i + (n-1-j) + 2? Actually, as we calculated: total = (i+1) + (n - j) = i+1 + n - j = i + n - j + 1. But the code does: i + (n-1-j) + 2 = i + n - 1 - j + 2 = i + n - j + 1 -> same.\n\n   Then after setting best, we move the left pointer: i += 1, and add arr[i] to lsum.\n\nBut why only move the left? Why not move the right? Or why not move both? Actually, we can move one of them arbitrarily? But note: if we move the left, then we break the equality? Then we try to balance again? This is acceptable because we are trying to see if we can get a larger total? \n\nHowever, the known solution for \"Candies\" (Two Candies) is:\n\n   i = 0, j = n-1\n   l = 0, r = 0\n   ans = 0\n   while i <= j:\n        if l < r:\n            l += arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            r += arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        if l == r:\n            ans = i + (n - j - 1)\n\n   Then output ans.\n\nBut note: the above known solution does not have the same structure. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   i = 0, j = n-1\n   lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n   best = 0\n   while i <= j:\n        if lsum == rsum:\n            best = i + (n - j - 1)   # because we have eaten i candies on the left and n - j - 1 on the right? Actually, the left: [0, i-1] -> i candies, right: [j+1, n-1] -> n - j - 1 candies. Then we can try to extend? \n        if lsum <= rsum:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            rsum += arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n\n   Then if lsum == rsum, we update best = i + (n - j - 1) again.\n\nBut the problem: the provided code already has the first and last taken? \n\nLooking at the sample: \n   n=2, [1,1]: \n        Initially: i=0, j=1 -> lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0 + (2-1-1) + 2? That doesn't match.\n\nActually, the provided code in the problem sets best only when equal and then moves the left. \n\nBut the sample: \n   n=1: then i=0, j=0 -> the while loop condition i<j fails? So we output best=0? But the problem says for the first test case: Alice eats one from the left and Bob one from the right -> total 2. But n=1? That doesn't match.\n\nWait, the first test case: \n   Input: \n        4\n        1\n        10\n        3\n        7 3 20 5 10 5\n        3\n        1 2 3\n        4\n        7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\n   The first test case: n=1, [10] -> the answer is 0? Because Alice and Bob cannot both eat the same total weight? Because if Alice eats the only candy, then Bob has nothing? And if Bob eats the only candy, then Alice has nothing? So they cannot both have the same positive weight? So the answer is 0? But the note says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> that implies n>=2? \n\nActually, the first test case in the note: \n   \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\"\n\nBut the input specification says: the first integer t (number of test cases) and then for each test case, an integer n and then n integers.\n\nThe sample input for the first test case: \n   n=1, [10] -> then the answer should be 0? But the note says the first test case has answer 2? \n\nLooking at the provided example test cases:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            4\n            1\n            10\n            3\n            7 3 20 5 10 5   # wait, n=3 but 6 numbers? That doesn't match.\n\nActually, the problem says: \n   The first line of each test case contains an integer n (the number of candies). The second line of each test case contains n integers.\n\nSo the first test case: n=1 -> [10] -> one candy.\n\nBut the note says: \n   \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2\"\n\nSo there is a discrepancy. \n\nLooking at the sample input in the problem statement:\n\n   \"The first line contains an integer t (1\u2264t\u226410^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1\u2264n\u22642\u22c510^5) \u2014 the number of candies on the table. The second line of each test case contains n integers w1,w2,\u2026,wn (1\u2264wi\u226410^4) \u2014 the weights of candies from left to right.\"\n\nAnd the note:\n\n   \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\"\n\n   \"For the second test case, ... answer is 6\"\n\n   \"For the third test case, ... answer is 0\"\n\n   \"For the fourth test case, ... answer is 7\"\n\nSo the first test case must have n>=2? \n\nBut the sample input in the problem says:\n\n   t=4\n   n=1 -> [10] -> third test case? \n\nActually, the note says:\n\n   \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\nSo the first test case in the input example might be:\n\n   n=2: [10,10] -> then Alice eats the first (10) and Bob eats the last (10) -> total 2.\n\nBut the problem says: the first test case: n=1? \n\nI think the problem statement has a sample input:\n\n   t=4\n   test1: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2\n   test2: n=3, [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> wait, that's 6 numbers? Then n=6? \n\nActually, the problem says: \n   \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n\"\n\n   Then the second test case: n=3? but then 6 numbers? That doesn't match.\n\nI see: the problem note says:\n\n   \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n   So n=6? Then the input for the second test case: \n        n=6\n        [7,3,20,5,10,5]\n\n   Then the third test case: \n        n=3, [1,2,3] -> then Alice and Bob: \n            Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [3] = 3 -> but wait, that would be 3 candies? But the answer is 0? \n\n   Actually, the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\"\n\n   But if we have [1,2,3]: \n        Alice can take [1] (1) and Bob take [3] (3) -> not equal.\n        Alice take [1,2] (3) and Bob take [3] (3) -> equal? Then total 3 candies? \n\n   Why is the answer 0? \n\n   The note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n   But 3 is non-zero? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\"\n\n   So if they both eat 3, that is fair? Then why the answer is 0? \n\n   The note says: \"the answer is 0\" for the third test case? \n\n   But the sample input in the problem statement:\n\n        Input: \n            4\n            1\n            10\n            3\n            7 3 20 5 10 5   # wait, this is 6 numbers? Then n=6? \n            3\n            1 2 3\n            4\n            7 3 20 10 8 11 1   # 7 numbers? Then n=7? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: the second line of each test case contains n integers.\n\n   So the first test case: n=1 -> [10]\n   second: n=3 -> [7,3,20]? but then the note says the second test case has 6 candies? \n\n   I see: the problem note says:\n\n        \"For the first test case\" -> n=1? but then the answer is 0? \n        \"For the second test case\" -> n=6? \n        \"For the third test case\" -> n=3? \n        \"For the fourth test case\" -> n=7? \n\n   But the input specification: the first integer t, then for each test case: \n        first integer n, then a list of n integers.\n\n   So the input:\n\n        4\n        1\n        10\n        6\n        7 3 20 5 10 5\n        3\n        1 2 3\n        7\n        7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\n   Then the answers: \n        test1: 0\n        test2: 6\n        test3: 0? but wait, [1,2,3]: \n            Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [3] = 3 -> total 3 candies? \n            But the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\" -> 3? \n\n        However, the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\"\n\n   Why? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n   So for [1,2,3]:\n        Alice can eat: \n            [] -> 0\n            [1] -> 1\n            [1,2] -> 3\n            [1,2,3] -> 6\n        Bob can eat:\n            [] -> 0\n            [3] -> 3\n            [2,3] -> 5\n            [1,2,3] -> 6\n\n        They can both eat 0: then total 0? \n        Or both eat 3: then Alice eats [1,2] (2 candies) and Bob eats [3] (1 candy) -> total 3 candies? \n        Or both eat 6: then Alice eats all and Bob eats nothing? Or Bob eats all and Alice nothing? \n\n        But note: if Alice eats [1,2,3] then Bob cannot eat any? Because the candies are gone? \n\n        The problem: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\"\n\n        So they cannot both eat the same candy. \n\n        Therefore, the only possibilities for non-zero are:\n            Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [3] (3) -> total 3 candies? \n\n        Why is the answer 0? \n\n   The note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\" -> but they can both eat 3? \n\n   I see: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (contiguous) and Bob from the right (contiguous) and they cannot overlap.\"\n\n   In [1,2,3]: \n        If Alice eats [1,2] (which are contiguous from the left) then the remaining candy is [3] at the right. Bob can eat [3] (contiguous from the right). \n        So that is valid.\n\n   Then the answer for the third test case should be 3? \n\n   But the note says 0? \n\n   Actually, the problem note says: \n        \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\"\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   However, the provided code in the problem sets the answer to 0 for the third test case? \n\n   Looking at the sample input in the problem: \n        The third test case: n=3, [1,2,3] -> the code outputs 0? \n\n   Why? \n\n   Let me run the provided code (with the missing part filled) for [1,2,3]:\n\n        n=3, arr=[1,2,3]\n\n        i=0, j=2\n        lsum=1, rsum=3\n        while i<j: \n            lsum(1) < rsum(3) -> i becomes 1, lsum = 1+2 = 3.\n            Now i=1, j=2: \n                lsum=3, rsum=3 -> set best = 1 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 1 + (0) + 2 = 3? \n                Then i becomes 2, lsum = 3+3=6 -> now i=2, j=2 -> break.\n\n        Then we print best=3.\n\n   But the problem note says the answer for the third test case is 0? \n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   I see: the problem note says: \n        \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n   But wait, the third test case in the input example is actually: \n        n=3, [1,2,3] -> but the problem note says the third test case is the one with n=3 and the array [1,2,3]? \n\n   However, the problem note also says: \n        \"For the fourth test case, ... answer is 7\"\n\n   And the fourth test case: n=4? but the input has n=7? \n\n   Actually, the problem note says:\n\n        \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7\"\n\n   So the array for the fourth test case: \n        [7,3,20, ... ,10,8,11,1] -> and the array has 7 elements: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]? \n\n   Then the input:\n\n        t=4\n        n=1: [10] -> test1\n        n=6: [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> test2 -> answer=6\n        n=3: [1,2,3] -> test3 -> answer=3? but the note says 0? \n        n=7: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> test4 -> answer=7\n\n   But the problem note says the third test case has answer 0? \n\n   I think there is a mistake in the problem note. The third test case in the note is actually the first test case? \n\n   Alternatively, the third test case in the input is not [1,2,3] but something else? \n\n   The problem says: \n        \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n   So the array must be [10,20,30]? \n\n   But the input says: \n        \"3\n        1 2 3\"\n\n   So the array is [1,2,3]. \n\n   How can they not have the same non-zero weight? \n\n   They can: \n        Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [3] = 3 -> non-zero.\n\n   So the note must be wrong? \n\n   Or the problem means that they cannot have the same non-zero weight without overlapping? But they don't overlap.\n\n   I think the note has a typo. The third test case in the note is actually the first test case (n=1, [10])? \n\n   Because for n=1: \n        Alice: [10] -> 10, Bob: nothing -> 0 -> not equal? \n        Alice: nothing -> 0, Bob: [10] -> 10 -> not equal? \n        So they can only both eat 0? Then the total candies eaten is 0? \n\n   So the first test case: n=1 -> answer=0.\n\n   The second test case: n=6 -> answer=6.\n\n   The third test case: n=3, [1,2,3] -> answer=3? \n\n   The fourth test case: n=7 -> answer=7.\n\n   But the problem note says:\n\n        \"For the first test case, ... answer=2\"\n        \"For the second test case, ... answer=6\"\n        \"For the third test case, ... answer=0\"\n        \"For the fourth test case, ... answer=7\"\n\n   So the first test case in the note is not the first in the input? \n\n   The problem says: \n        \"The first line contains an integer t (1\u2264t\u226410^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\"\n\n   Then the test cases are given in order.\n\n   The note says: \n        \"For the first test case\" -> meaning the first test case in the input? \n\n   But the input has:\n        test1: n=1 -> [10] -> answer=0\n        test2: n=6 -> [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> answer=6\n        test3: n=3 -> [1,2,3] -> answer=3\n        test4: n=7 -> [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7\n\n   But the note says the first test case has answer 2? \n\n   So there is a discrepancy.\n\n   I see: the problem note says:\n\n        \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\"\n\n   This implies n>=2. \n\n   And the second test case: n=6 -> answer=6.\n\n   The third test case: n=3 -> [1,2,3] -> but the note says the third test case has answer 0? \n\n   And the fourth test case: n=7 -> answer=7.\n\n   So the first test case in the input example must be n=2? \n\n   The problem says: \n        \"The first line of the input contains t=4\"\n\n        Then the next lines:\n\n            2   [for the first test case: n=2]\n            ... two numbers\n\n        But the sample input in the problem statement is:\n\n            4\n            1\n            10\n            6\n            7 3 20 5 10 5\n            3\n            1 2 3\n            4\n            7 3 20 10 8 11 1   # wait, n=4? but then 7 numbers? \n\n   Actually, the fourth test case: n=4? but then the array has 4 numbers? \n\n   The problem note for the fourth test case: \n        Alice eats [7,3,20] (3 candies) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (4 candies) -> total 7 candies.\n\n   So the array must have 7 candies: [7,3,20, ... ,10,8,11,1] -> so n=7.\n\n   Therefore, the input for the fourth test case is n=7.\n\n   So the sample input:\n\n        t=4\n        test1: n=1 -> [10]\n        test2: n=6 -> [7,3,20,5,10,5]\n        test3: n=3 -> [1,2,3]\n        test4: n=7 -> [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]\n\n   And the answers:\n\n        test1: 0\n        test2: 6\n        test3: 3\n        test4: 7\n\n   But the problem note says:\n\n        \"For the first test case\" -> answer=2\n        \"For the second test case\" -> answer=6\n        \"For the third test case\" -> answer=0\n        \"For the fourth test case\" -> answer=7\n\n   This implies that the first test case in the note is not the first in the input? \n\n   Or the first test case in the input is not described in the note? \n\n   The problem says: \n        \"For the first test case\" -> meaning the first one in the input? \n\n   But the first one in the input has n=1, and the note says the first test case has answer 2? \n\n   I think the note is describing the test cases in the example input in the note, which is different from the sample input provided in the code comments.\n\n   The sample input in the code comments is:\n\n        \"4\n        1\n        10\n        3\n        7 3 20 5 10 5\n        3\n        1 2 3\n        4\n        7 3 20 10 8 11 1\"\n\n   This has a mistake: the second test case has n=3 but then 6 numbers? \n\n   So it should be:\n\n        t=4\n        test1: n=1 -> [10]\n        test2: n=3 -> [7,3,20]   # but then the next numbers are 5,10,5? which are for the next test case? \n\n   This is a formatting error.\n\n   Given the confusion, we trust the algorithm: \n\n   We have two pointers. We start with the first candy for Alice and the last for Bob. \n   We move the pointers until they meet. \n   When the sums are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (i+1 from the left and n-j from the right) and then we move the left pointer? \n\n   But the known solution for \"Two Candies\" (or similar) is:\n\n        best = 0\n        left_sum = 0\n        right_sum = 0\n        left = 0\n        right = n-1\n        while left <= right:\n            if left_sum == right_sum:\n                best = left + (n - right - 1)\n            if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                left_sum += arr[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right_sum += arr[right]\n                right -= 1\n        if left_sum == right_sum:\n            best = left + (n - right - 1)\n        print(best)\n\n   But note: in this solution, we start with 0 on both sides and then add until we meet.\n\n   However, the provided code in program1.py starts with the first and last already taken.\n\n   We can either change the algorithm or complete the missing part.\n\n   Since the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", we must complete the missing part in the provided structure.\n\n   The provided structure:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = arr[i]\n        rsum = arr[j]\n\n        best = 0\n        while i < j:\n            if lsum < rsum:\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            elif rsum < lsum:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                i += 1\n                if i < j:   # we must check because after i+=1, i might be >=j\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n\n   We need to complete the \"elif rsum < lsum\" block.\n\n   We should do:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But note: we must be cautious that j might become less than i? The condition is while i<j, so after j-=1, we might break the condition? But the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration.\n\n   So:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n   However, let's test with the sample [1,2,3] (n=3):\n\n        i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=3 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 1, lsum=1+2=3.\n        Then: i=1, j=2: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> enter else: \n            best = 1 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 1 + (0) + 2 = 3 -> then i becomes 2, and then we break because i=2 and j=2 -> i<j fails.\n\n        Then output 3 -> which is correct.\n\n   Now test with [10] (n=1):\n\n        i=0, j=0 -> while i<j fails -> output best=0 -> correct.\n\n   Test with [7,3,20,5,10,5] (n=6) -> the second test case:\n\n        We expect answer=6.\n\n        How? \n            Alice eats the first three: [7,3,20] = 30\n            Bob eats the last three: [5,10,5] = 20? -> not 30.\n\n        Wait, the problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\"\n\n        But the array is [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> \n            Alice: [7,3,20] = 30\n            Bob: [5,10,5] = 20 -> not 7.\n\n        The note says: \"the first three candies from the right\" -> the rightmost three: [5,10,5] -> but that's 20.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> meaning the first three he encounters: \n            Bob starts from the right: \n                first candy from the right: 5 (last)\n                second: 10 (second last)\n                third: 5 (third last) -> that's [5,10,5] = 20.\n\n        How do they get 7? \n\n        The note says: \"the first three candies from the right\" -> but the array is [7,3,20,5,10,5] -> \n            The rightmost three are [5,10,5] -> 20.\n\n        I see: the problem note says: \n            \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> meaning the first three as he moves from right to left? \n\n        But the total weight is 7? \n\n        Alternatively, the array is: \n            [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 5] -> \n            Alice: [7,3,20] = 30\n            Bob: [5,10,5] = 20 -> not 30.\n\n        How can they both have 30? \n\n        The problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> 7? \n\n        But 7+3+20 = 30, not 7.\n\n        There is a typo in the note: it should be 30.\n\n        And Bob: [5,10,5] -> 20? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that doesn't add up.\n\n        Actually, the array might be: \n            [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 5] -> \n            Bob: the first three from the right: \n                first: 5 (index5) -> 5\n                second: 10 (index4) -> 15\n                third: 5 (index3) -> 20\n\n        How to get 30 for Bob? \n\n        The problem says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> but then he cannot eat more than three? \n\n        But the note says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\" -> so they eat all.\n\n        Then Alice: [7,3,20] = 30, Bob: [5,10,5] = 20 -> not equal.\n\n        I see: the problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo: it should be 30.\n\n            \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that should be 20? \n\n        But then they are not equal.\n\n        The sample input in the problem note for the second test case: \n            \"s(3) = [7,3,20,5,10,5]\" -> but then the answer is 6 because they eat all? \n\n        How can they both have the same weight if they eat all? \n            Total = 7+3+20+5+10+5 = 50 -> then each should have 25? \n\n        But Alice eats the first three: 7+3+20=30, Bob eats the last three: 5+10+5=20 -> 30+20=50, but they are not equal.\n\n        Alternatively, Alice eats the first two: 7+3=10, Bob eats the last two: 10+5=15 -> not equal.\n\n        Or Alice eats the first four: 7+3+20+5=35, Bob eats the last two: 10+5=15 -> not equal.\n\n        Or Alice eats the first one: 7, Bob eats the last one: 5 -> not equal.\n\n        How about: \n            Alice: [7,3] = 10\n            Bob: [5,5] = 10 -> then they eat 4 candies? \n\n        But the problem says the answer is 6.\n\n        The problem says: \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\"\n\n        And they can eat all 6 if they both eat the entire array? But then Alice eats the entire array and Bob eats nothing? -> not equal.\n\n        Or if they split the array in the middle? \n\n        The problem: contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right, and they cannot overlap.\n\n        So they must meet in the middle.\n\n        To eat all, they would have to split the array into two contiguous parts: one from the left and one from the right, and the entire array is covered. \n\n        But then the sum of the entire array is 50, so each should have 25? \n\n        How to split? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] = 30 -> too much.\n            Alice: [7,3] = 10, then Bob: [5,10,5] = 20 -> not equal.\n\n        Alice: [7] = 7, Bob: [5] = 5 -> not equal.\n\n        Alice: [7,3,20,5] = 35, Bob: [5,10] = 15 -> not equal.\n\n        Alice: [7,3,20,5,10] = 45, Bob: [5] = 5 -> not equal.\n\n        So how do they get 6? \n\n        The problem note says: \"they cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\" -> meaning they eat all, but then the sums must be equal? \n\n        Only if the total is even? 50 is even, but we need two contiguous parts that meet in the middle and sum to 25 each.\n\n        Let me check: \n            prefix: [7, 10, 30, 35, 45, 50]\n            suffix: [5, 15, 20, 40, 43, 50]\n\n            Is there an index i such that prefix[i] = 25? -> no.\n            Or suffix[i] = 25? -> no.\n\n        So how can the answer be 6? \n\n        I see: the problem note says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo. The array might be different.\n\n        The sample input in the problem for the second test case: \n            \"3\n            7 3 20 5 10 5\"\n\n        But the first integer is 3? then n=3, and then the array has 3 numbers: [7,3,20]? \n\n        Then the next test case: n=5,10,5? -> but then we have three test cases? \n\n        This is a mess.\n\n        Given the time, we trust the algorithm we are implementing.\n\n        We'll complete the missing part as:\n\n            elif rsum < lsum:\n                j -= 1\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And hope that the sample [7,3,20,5,10,5] is not used in the judge.\n\n        But the problem says: the total n over test cases is <=200000, so we can trust the two pointers.\n\n        We also note that when the sums are equal, we move the left pointer. Why not move the right? Or both? \n\n        The known solution (from a similar problem) moves one pointer at a time. \n\n        We'll do as the structure.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But note: we must be cautious that j might be out of bounds? But we are in the while i<j, and j starts at n-1. When we do j-=1, j becomes at least i? But we are in the loop and the condition is i<j, so j is at least i+1. Then j-1 is at least i, so it's safe.\n\n   Now, for program2.py:\n\n   The problem: \n        We are given an integer n. We form a string s = \"BAN\" repeated n times. \n        We want to perform the minimum number of swaps (each swap: two distinct indices) so that the string does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n   The provided code:\n\n        w = int(input())\n        for i in range(w):\n            p = int(input())\n            if p % 2 == 0:\n                t = p//2\n                print(t)\n                for k in range(t):\n                    print((k*3)+2, ((p*3) - (k*3)))\n            else:\n                if p==1:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(1,2)\n                else:\n                    t = p//2 + 1\n                    print(t)\n                    print(1,2)\n                    for k in range(t-1):\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The sample: \n        n=1: \n            s = \"BAN\"\n            We swap indices 1 and 2 -> becomes \"ABN\" -> no \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        n=2: \n            s = \"BANBAN\"\n            We swap index2 and index6 -> becomes \"BNNBAA\" -> no \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        How? \n            The known solution: \n                For even n: \n                    m = n//2\n                    then swap the second character of the i-th \"BAN\" (which is at position 3*i+1, 0-indexed) with the last character of the (n-1-i)-th \"BAN\" (which is at position 3*(n-1-i)+2).\n\n                But the code for even n: \n                    for k in range(t):   # t = n//2\n                        print( (k*3)+2, (n*3 - k*3) )\n\n                For n=2: \n                    k=0: (0*3+2, 6 - 0) = (2,6) -> 1-indexed?

(1-indexed) -> but we have to account for the first block being already swapped? \n\n                Alternatively, we can do the same pattern: \n                    For the second block (which is the first of the remaining) and the last block? \n\n                The code for even n=2: \n                    swap index2 of the first block (which is at 2) and the last character of the last block (which is at 6) -> but we already swapped the first block? \n\n                Instead, we can do:\n\n                    For k in range(t-1): \n                        # we are going to do the same as in even, but starting from the second block? \n\n                The provided code in the even part: \n                    for k in range(t):   # t = n//2\n                        print( (k*3)+2, (n*3 - k*3) )\n\n                For n=3, we want to do one more swap: \n                    k=0: but if we use k=0 in the same formula: \n                        i = (0*3)+2 = 2\n                        j = 3*3 - 0 = 9\n\n                But we already swapped index2? \n\n                Alternatively, we can shift the indices for the remaining blocks.\n\n                The known solution from known problems: \n                    We can do:\n                        swap the 'A' in the i-th block (for i from 1 to ceil(n/2)) with the 'N' in the (n+1-i)-th block.\n\n                For n=3: \n                    i=1: swap the 'A' in block1 (index2) and the 'N' in block3 (index9) -> but we already swapped index2 in the first operation? \n\n                How about we do the same pattern for the remaining blocks without including the first block? \n\n                The problem says: one of the answers for n=3 is:\n\n                    Operation1: swap(1,2) -> \"ABN\" for the first block.\n                    Operation2: swap(5,9) -> \n                        5: the 'A' in the second block (which is at position 5 in 1-indexed) \n                        9: the last character of the last block.\n\n                Then the string becomes:\n\n                    Block1: A (index1), B (index2), N (index3) -> but we swapped index1 and index2: so now index1 is 'A', index2 is 'B'. Then we swap index5 and index9:\n\n                    Original after first swap: \n                        1: 'A'\n                        2: 'B'\n                        3: 'N'\n                        4: 'B'\n                        5: 'A'\n                        6: 'N'\n                        7: 'B'\n                        8: 'A'\n                        9: 'N'\n\n                    Swap index5 and index9:\n                        1: 'A'\n                        2: 'B'\n                        3: 'N'\n                        4: 'B'\n                        5: 'N'   (from index9)\n                        6: 'N'\n                        7: 'B'\n                        8: 'A'\n                        9: 'A'   (from index5)\n\n                    So the string: \"ABNBNNBAA\"\n\n                Now, check for \"BAN\" as a subsequence: \n                    We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' in order.\n\n                    We have:\n                        'B' at index2, then 'A' at index8, then 'N' at index5 -> but 2<8<5? -> no, 5 is before 8.\n\n                    Or: \n                        'B' at index4, then 'A' at index8, then 'N' at index5 -> 4<8<5 -> no.\n\n                    Or: \n                        'B' at index7, then 'A' at index8, then 'N' at index5 -> 7<8<5 -> no.\n\n                So it works.\n\n                How to compute the indices for the remaining operations?\n\n                    For the k-th operation in the for loop (k from 0 to t-2), we want to swap:\n\n                        the 'A' in the (k+1)-th block of the remaining?

in 1-indexed) -> actually, the second character of the (k+1)-th block (0-indexed block index = k+1) is at 3*(k+1) + 1 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed: 3*(k+1)+2? \n\n                    But wait, 0-indexed:\n                        block0: indices 0,1,2 -> second character at index1 -> 1-indexed: 2.\n                        block1: indices 3,4,5 -> second character at index4 -> 1-indexed: 5.\n                        block2: indices 6,7,8 -> second character at index7 -> 1-indexed: 8.\n\n                    And the last character of the (n-1 - (k+1))-th block? \n                        For the last block (block2) in n=3: \n                            last character: index8 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed:9.\n                        For the block before the last: block1: last character: index5 -> 1-indexed:6.\n\n                    But we want to swap the second character of the (k+1)-th block with the last character of the (n-1 - (k+1))-th block? \n\n                    For k=0 in the for loop (for n=3, t-1=1, so k=0):\n                        i = 3*(k+1) + 2? -> 3*1+2 = 5 (1-indexed) -> which is the second character of the second block (block1).\n                        j = 3*n - 3*(k+1) ? -> 9 - 3 = 6? -> but we want to swap with the last character of the last block? which is 9.\n\n                    Alternatively, we want to swap with the last character of the (n-1 - k) block? \n\n                    The block index for the partner of block (k+1) is n-2 - k? \n\n                    For the second block (k+1=1) in n=3: we want to swap with the last block (block2) -> which is block index = 2 = n-1.\n\n                    But the formula for even was: \n                        for block k: swap with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block? \n\n                    In even: \n                        k from 0 to t-1: \n                            i = 3*k+2\n                            j = 3*n - 3*k   # because the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block: the (n-1-k)-th block starts at 3*(n-1-k) and the last character is at 3*(n-1-k)+2 -> 1-indexed: 3*(n-1-k)+3? \n                    But the code for even: \n                        j = (p*3) - (k*3)   # p is n\n\n                    For n=2, k=0: j = 6 - 0 = 6 -> which is the last character of the last block.\n\n                    For the second block in an even of n=2: \n                        k=0: second character of block0: 3*0+2 = 2, and last character of block1: 3*2 - 0 = 6.\n\n                    So for the for loop in the odd case (for the remaining t-1 operations), we can use the same formula as even but for k from 0 to t-2, and the blocks we are considering are from the second block to the middle? \n\n                    Specifically, we can do:\n\n                        for k in range(t-1):\n                            i_index = (k+1)*3 + 2   # but wait, for k=0: 1*3+2=5 -> which is the second character of the second block? \n                            j_index = (p*3) - (k*3)   # for n=3, k=0: 9 - 0 = 9 -> the last character.\n\n                    But then we swap (5,9) for n=3 -> which is what we want.\n\n                    However, for the next k (if any) in a larger odd n, say n=5: \n                        t = 5//2+1 = 3\n                        first operation: swap(1,2)\n                        then for k in range(2): \n                            k=0: swap( (0+1)*3+2 = 5, 15 - 0 = 15)\n                            k=1: swap( (1+1)*3+2 = 8, 15 - 3 = 12)\n\n                    What are these?\n                        Block0: indices 1,2,3 -> we swapped 1 and 2 -> so block0 becomes A,B,N? -> but we don't care about the content for the formula, we are just swapping.\n\n                    Block1: indices 4,5,6 -> second character: index5 -> swap with index15 (the last character of the last block, block4: indices 13,14,15 -> last is 15)\n                    Block2: indices 7,8,9 -> second character: index8 -> swap with index12 (which is the last character of block3: indices 10,11,12 -> last is 12)\n\n                    This matches the pattern: swap the second character of the (k+1)-th block with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block? \n\n                    But note: the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block for k=0: n-1-0 = 4 -> block4, last character: 15.\n                    for k=1: n-1-1=3 -> block3, last character: 12.\n\n                Therefore, the code for the for loop in the odd case (n>=3) is:\n\n                    for k in range(t-1):\n                        print( ( (k+1)*3 + 2, (p*3) - (k*3) ))\n\n                But note: the formula for the first block we did separately: we swapped (1,2). Then the remaining swaps are for k from 0 to t-2.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        print( ( (k+1)*3 + 2, (p*3) - (k*3) ))\n\n   But note: the variable in the loop is k, and p is the input n.\n\n   Now, for program3.py:\n\n   The problem: \n        We are given t test cases. For each: n and m.\n        We can choose an integer k in [1, m] to maximize the roundness (number of trailing zeros) of n*k. \n        If multiple, choose the maximum n*k.\n\n        If it is impossible to get a rounder price (than the current maximum? or than n*1?) then output n*m.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            data = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n            ns, ms = data[::2], data[1::2]\n\n            output = []\n            for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n                # factor n: n = 2^a * 5^b * c\n                a = b = 0\n                c = n\n                while c % 2 == 0:\n                    a += 1\n                    c //= 2\n                while c % 5 == 0:\n                    b += 1\n                    c //= 5\n                t_val = 1   # we'll use t_val as the multiplier base\n                if a > b:\n                    while a > b and 5 * t_val <= m:\n                        t_val *= 5\n                        b += 1\n                elif b > a:\n                    while b > a and 2 * t_val <= m:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                while 10 * t_val <= m:\n                    t_val *= 10\n                # Then we choose k = the largest multiple of t_val that is <= m? \n                # Specifically: k = m - (m % t_val)   -> then n*k = n * (m - (m%t_val))\n                output.append(n * (m - (m % t_val)))\n\n        The idea: \n            The number of trailing zeros is determined by the factors of 2 and 5.\n            We want to balance the factors of 2 and 5 in n*k. \n            Initially, n has a factors of 2 and b factors of 5.\n            Then we can multiply by 2 or 5 to balance? \n\n            The code does:\n                If a > b: we need more 5s -> so we multiply by 5 as long as we can (without exceeding m) and update t_val (which is the multiplier we are building) and b (so that we count the new 5s).\n\n                Similarly, if b > a: we need more 2s -> so we multiply by 2 as long as we can.\n\n            Then, after balancing, we can multiply by 10 as long as we can? But note: 10=2*5, so we can only multiply by 10 if we have balanced factors? \n\n            Then we set k = the largest multiple of t_val that is <= m.\n\n        The missing part: \n            elif b > a:\n                while b > a and 2 * t_val <= m:\n                    # we multiply by 2\n                    t_val *= 2\n                    a += 1   # because we are adding one factor of 2\n\n        But note: we are adding one factor of 2 per multiplication.\n\n        Example: \n            n=5, m=43: \n                n=5: a=0, b=1 -> b>a.\n                Then we do: \n                    while 1>0 and 2*1<=43 -> true: \n                        t_val = 1*2 = 2, a=1 -> now a==b? \n                    then we break.\n                Then we do: while 10*t_val<=43? 10*2=20<=43 -> true: then t_val=20.\n                Then again: 10*20=200>43 -> break.\n                Then k = 43 - (43 % 20) = 43 - 3 = 40.\n                Then n*k = 5*40 = 200 -> which has two trailing zeros.\n\n            But the note says: the maximum price multiple of 100 would be 5*40=200 -> so that matches.\n\n        Another example: \n            n=13, m=5: \n                n=13: a=0, b=0 -> so we skip the if and elif.\n                Then we do: while 10*1<=5? false -> so t_val=1.\n                Then k = 5 - (5%1)=5-0=5 -> n*k=65.\n                The note says: output 65.\n\n        Example: n=6, m=11:\n                n=6: 6=2^1 * 3 -> a=1, b=0.\n                Then we are in a>0: \n                    while 1>0 and 5*1<=11 -> true: \n                        t_val=5, b=1 -> now a==b? \n                    then we break.\n                Then we do: while 10*5=50<=11? false -> so t_val=5.\n                Then k = 11 - (11%5) = 11-1=10 -> n*k=60.\n\n        The note says: 60.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n            t_val *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n   But note: the variable name: we are using t_val (the variable in the code is t, but the problem uses t for test cases, so we must not use t? Actually, the code uses t_val as the multiplier base, and the variable is named `t` in the provided code? \n\n   Looking at the provided code:\n\n        t = 1   # our result should be a multiple of t\n\n        Then in the if block: \n            while ...:\n                t *= 5\n                ...\n\n        Then in the missing elif block:\n\n            while ...:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then: \n            while 10 * t <= m:\n                t *= 10\n\n        So the variable is named `t`.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in the elif block is:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n   But note: the condition in the while loop: \n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n\n        So we do:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n   This will reduce the difference (b - a) by one? because we are adding one factor of 2.\n\n   We do this until either a becomes equal to b or we cannot multiply by 2 without exceeding m.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\n   But note: the code is inside the while loop, so we do it repeatedly.\n\n   Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        program1: \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n        program2: \"print( ( (k+1)*3 + 2, (p*3) - (k*3) ))\"\n        program3: \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   However, note that in program1, the code block for the elif might be:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the two lines of code.\n\n   Similarly, for program2, the missing code is one line.\n\n   For program3, the missing code is two lines.\n\n   We output as JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"print( ( (k+1)*3 + 2, (p*3) - (k*3) ))\",\n            \"program3\": \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 code: the expression (p*3) - (k*3) -> we use p (which is the input n) and k (the loop variable).\n\n   And in program3, the variable names are as in the provided code.\n\n   We write the code exactly as it should appear.\n\n   However, in program1, the provided code has an indentation of 8 spaces for the block inside the elif? \n\n   We output the same indentation? \n\n   The problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   We output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\n   For program1, the TODO is in the elif block, and we have two lines. We output:\n\n        \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n   The next line after the elif condition is currently a comment, so we replace the comment and the next lines until the block is complete? But the problem says the missing block.\n\n   We only output the two lines of code that should be there.\n\n   Similarly for the others.\n\n   Let me check the program2: the TODO is in a for loop. We output one line.\n\n   But note: the program2 code has:\n\n        for k in range(t-1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with one line: \n\n        print( ( (k+1)*3 + 2, (p*3) - (k*3) ))\n\n   But note: the expression: (p*3) - (k*3) -> we can write as 3*p - 3*k, but the original even part used: (p*3) - (k*3) -> so we do the same.\n\n   Now, we output the JSON.\n\n   Important: the JSON must be valid. We use double quotes.\n\n   We write:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"print(( (k+1)*3 + 2, p*3 - k*3 ))\",\n            \"program3\": \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n        }\n\n   But note: in program2, the expression: ( (k+1)*3 + 2, p*3 - k*3 ) -> we can write without the outer parentheses? \n\n   The print statement: \n        print( ( ... , ... ) )   -> that is a tuple inside parentheses.\n\n   But the original even part: \n        print((k*3)+2,((p*3)-(k*3)))   -> without the tuple parentheses? \n\n   Actually, the even part: \n        print((k*3)+2,((p*3)-(k*3)))\n\n   This prints two numbers: first (k*3)+2, second (p*3 - k*3).\n\n   So we should do the same: \n        print( (k+1)*3+2, p*3 - k*3 )\n\n   But the expression (k+1)*3+2: we can write 3*(k+1)+2.\n\n   However, the even part used: (k*3)+2 -> so we do similarly.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"print(3*(k+1)+2, 3*p - 3*k)\"\n\n   But note: 3*p - 3*k = 3*(p-k)\n\n   Alternatively, we can write: 3*(p-k)\n\n   But the even part: ((p*3)-(k*3)) = 3*(p-k) -> same.\n\n   For clarity, we write:\n\n        print(3*(k+1)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n   But wait, for k=0: \n        3*(0+1)+2 = 5, and 3*(p-0)=3*p -> for n=3: 9 -> which is what we want.\n\n   But the even part for the same k in the even part: \n        for k in range(t): \n            print( (k*3)+2, (p*3) - (k*3) )\n\n        for k=0: 2, 3*p\n\n   So for the odd part, we are doing k+1 for the first argument and p-k for the second? \n\n   Actually, the even part: \n        for block k: \n            first index: (k*3)+2   (the second character of the k-th block)\n            second index: (p*3) - (k*3)   (the last character of the (p-1-k)-th block? because the last character of the (p-1-k)-th block is at 3*(p-1-k)+2+1? -> no, the last character of the entire string is at 3*p, and we subtract 3*k? \n\n        Actually, the last character of the (p-1-k)-th block: \n            the (p-1-k)-th block starts at 3*(p-1-k) and the last character is at 3*(p-1-k)+2 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed: 3*(p-1-k)+3 = 3*p - 3*k - 3 + 3 = 3*p - 3*k? \n\n        But the even part uses: (p*3) - (k*3) -> which is 3*(p-k) -> which is the same as 3*p - 3*k.\n\n        And for the k-th block in the even part: the second character is at 3*k+2.\n\n        In the odd part for the for loop: \n            we are doing for the (k+1)-th block: the second character is at 3*(k+1)+1? (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed: 3*(k+1)+2? -> no, 0-indexed: \n                block0: indices0,1,2 -> second character: index1 -> 1-indexed:2 -> which is 0*3+1+1? \n            Actually, 1-indexed index = 3*(k+1) - 3 + 2 = 3*(k+1)-1? \n\n        Alternatively, the second character of the (k+1)-th block (0-indexed block index = k+1) is at 0-indexed index = 3*(k+1)+1 -> 1-indexed: 3*(k+1)+2.\n\n        So we can write: 3*(k+1)+2.\n\n        And the last character of the (p-1 - k)-th block? \n            The block index = p-1-k (0-indexed) -> last character at 0-indexed index = 3*(p-1-k)+2 -> 1-indexed: 3*(p-1-k)+3 = 3*p - 3*k - 3 + 3 = 3*p - 3*k.\n\n        But the even part: for the k-th block, the partner is the (p-1-k)-th block? \n            Then the last character of that block: 3*(p-1-k)+2 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed: 3*(p-1-k)+3 = 3*p - 3*k.\n\n        So the same formula: 3*p - 3*k.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            print(3*(k+1)+2, 3*p - 3*k)\n\n        Or to match the even part style:\n\n            print( ( (k+1)*3+2, p*3 - k*3 ))\n\n        But the even part did not have an extra set of parentheses for the tuple? \n\n        Actually, the even part: \n            print((k*3)+2,((p*3)-(k*3)))\n\n        This is two arguments to print: \n            first: (k*3)+2\n            second: (p*3)-(k*3)\n\n        So we do the same.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program2: \n\n        print(3*(k+1)+2, 3*p - 3*k)\n\n   But we can write without parentheses in the expression? \n\n        print( (k+1)*3+2, p*3 - k*3 )\n\n   This is clear.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        \"program2\": \"print((k+1)*3+2, p*3 - k*3)\"\n\n   Now, the JSON.\n\n   Note: the program1 code has two lines, and we include the indentation (8 spaces) for the second line? \n\n   The original program1:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with:\n\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n   The first line: j -= 1 -> at the same indentation level as the comment, which is 8 spaces (if the block is 4 spaces per level, then the elif is 4, then the block inside is 8). \n\n   We output the two lines with the same indentation.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the surrounding.\n\n   Since the if block has:\n\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n   and the else block has:\n\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n   So the indentation is 8 spaces (or one level of 4 and then the block is 8).\n\n   We output:\n\n        \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n   The \"\\n        \" means: newline and then 8 spaces.\n\n   Similarly, for program3, the missing code is two lines, and the while loop body is indented. The original:\n\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace with:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n   So we output:\n\n        \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   But note: the while loop body should be indented. The original code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n   The surrounding:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\n   So the body is two lines, each indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n   But the TODO is at the same level. So we output the two lines without extra indentation? \n\n   Actually, the code we are replacing is at the same level as the comment. We output:\n\n        \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   But the while loop is already indented (the while line is indented by 4, then the body should be 8). \n\n   However, the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines of the body, and we assume they will be placed at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\n   Therefore, we output the two lines without any extra spaces? \n\n   But the program3 code we are to complete has:\n\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n   So we output:\n\n        \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   But note: the while loop body should be indented by 4 more than the while line. So the two lines should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But the original code in the if block (above) has:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\n   So we do the same.\n\n   We output the two lines with the same indentation as the if block body.\n\n   But the problem says: output the code that would replace the TODO. The TODO is one line. We replace that one line with two lines? \n\n   We output:\n\n        \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n   The two lines.\n\n   Now, the final JSON."
