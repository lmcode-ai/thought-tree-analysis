Idea: We note that two strings s and t (each of two characters) differ in exactly one position if:\n  (s[0] == t[0] and s[1] != t[1]) OR (s[0] ! = t[0] and s[1] == t[1]) We can group the strings by their first character and by their second character.

Alternatively, we can avoid the double loop by using:\n\n    total_same_first = 0\n    for a, d in group_by_first.items():\n        s = sum(d.values())\n        # Now, the sum of products of distinct second characters: \n        #   = (s^2 - sum_b (cnt_b^2)) // 2\n        # because: \n        #   (sum_b cnt_b)^2 = sum_b cnt_b^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} cnt_i * cnt_j\n        # so: sum_{i<j} cnt_i * cnt_j = (s^2 - sum_b cnt_b^2) // 2\n        sq = 0\n        for cnt in d.values():\n            sq += cnt * cnt\n        total_same_first += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n    Similarly for group_by_second. But note: we are using integer division and s*s might be large, but n<=10^5 per test case?",

Actually, the block is at the same level as the previous `n=int(input())` which is at 4 spaces. So we output the block with 4 spaces per line?

We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem: Count the number of pairs (i, j) (i < j) of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\n\nThe provided code has a nested loop which is O(n^2) and n can be up to 10^5, so it will be too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach.\n\nIdea:\nWe note that two strings s and t (each of two characters) differ in exactly one position if:\n  (s[0] == t[0] and s[1] != t[1]) OR (s[0] != t[0] and s[1] == t[1])\n\nWe can group the strings by their first character and by their second character.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a frequency dictionary for the entire string. However, note that the condition is about one position.\n\nAnother idea: \n  Let f(x, y) be the frequency of the string (x, y).\n\nWe can count:\n  For a fixed first character x, and for two different second characters y1 and y2, the pairs of strings that have the same first character (x) and different second characters (y1 and y2) would be f(x, y1) * f(x, y2). But note: this counts pairs that differ only in the second character.\n\nSimilarly, for a fixed second character y, and for two different first characters x1 and x2, the pairs of strings that have the same second character (y) and different first characters (x1 and x2) would be f(x1, y) * f(x2, y). This counts pairs that differ only in the first character.\n\nTherefore, the total pairs = \n  Sum_{x} [ for each x, sum_{y1 < y2} (f(x, y1) * f(x, y2)) ] \n  + \n  Sum_{y} [ for each y, sum_{x1 < x2} (f(x1, y) * f(x2, y)) ]\n\nBut note: the problem states that the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can iterate over the groups.\n\nHowever, the provided code is O(n^2) and we need to fix it.\n\nLooking at the provided code, it seems to be trying to do something with duplicates? But the approach is O(n^2) and will TLE.\n\nWe must change the approach.\n\nLet's restructure:\n\nWe'll use two dictionaries:\n  dict1: keyed by the first character, and then within that, a dictionary for the second character counts.\n  dict2: keyed by the second character, and then within that, a dictionary for the first character counts.\n\nBut actually, we can do with one dictionary that counts the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  total = 0\n  freq = defaultdict(int)\n  for each string s in the test case:\n      freq[s] += 1\n\n  But then how to count pairs that differ in exactly one position?\n\nWe can iterate over the 26*26 possible strings? But the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters) so 11*11=121.\n\nBut note: the problem says the strings are of two letters from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters). So we can iterate over all 121 strings.\n\nBut we have n up to 10^5 per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do:\n\n  For each distinct string s, we can consider:\n      For the first character same: we look at strings that have the same first character and a different second character. But we have to avoid counting the same string? Actually, we are iterating by distinct strings.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  Let's create:\n      group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n      group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n\n  Then for each string (a, b):\n      group_by_first[a][b] += 1\n      group_by_second[b][a] += 1\n\n  Then for each first character a, we have a list of counts for each second character in group_by_first[a]. Then the number of pairs that have the same first character a and differ in the second character is: \n        total_second = sum(group_by_first[a].values())\n        Then the pairs within a fixed a: \n            = (total_second*(total_second-1))//2   ??? \n        But wait, that counts every pair of two different second characters? Actually, no: that counts every unordered pair of two strings in the same first group. However, note: we want to count every pair of two strings that have the same first character and different second characters. And that is exactly: \n            = total_second*(total_second-1)//2   minus the pairs that have the same second character? \n        Actually, no: the pairs that have the same second character are not included in the condition? The condition for the same first character and different second character: we don't require the second character to be any particular one, just different.\n\n        But note: the above formula (total_second*(total_second-1)//2) counts every pair of two distinct strings in the same first group. However, that includes pairs that have the same second character? Actually, no: if two strings have the same second character, then they are the same string? Not necessarily: they could be the same string? Actually, the same string can appear multiple times. But we are counting distinct pairs (i, j) with i<j. \n\n        However, the problem does not say the strings are distinct. So we have duplicates.\n\n        How to count for a fixed first character a and two different second characters b1 and b2: \n            The pairs of (s1, s2) such that s1 has (a, b1) and s2 has (a, b2) is: count_b1 * count_b2.\n\n        So for a fixed a, the total pairs for the same first character and different second character is:\n            total = 0\n            counts = list of counts for each second character in group_by_first[a]\n            for each count_i in counts:\n                for each count_j in counts for j>i? -> that would be O(11^2) which is acceptable.\n\n            Alternatively: \n                total_pairs = 0\n                s = sum(counts)\n                # But note: the pairs that have the same second character are not included. We want pairs with different second characters.\n                # Actually, the total pairs of two strings in the group is: s*(s-1)//2, but that includes pairs with the same second character? \n                # And the pairs with the same second character: for a fixed second character b, the number of pairs within that second character is: count_b*(count_b-1)//2.\n                # Then the pairs with different second characters = total_pairs - sum_{b} [count_b*(count_b-1)//2]\n\n            But wait, the problem condition: we want pairs that differ in exactly one position. For the same first character and different second character, that is exactly the pairs that have the same first character and different second character. So we can compute:\n\n                total_same_first = 0\n                for b, cnt in group_by_first[a].items():\n                    total_same_first += cnt * (s - cnt)   # but this counts each pair twice? \n                Actually, no: for two distinct second characters b1 and b2, we count cnt1 * cnt2, and we do that for every pair? But in the above double loop we don't.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n                total_same_first = 0\n                for i in range(len(counts)):\n                    for j in range(i+1, len(counts)):\n                        total_same_first += counts[i] * counts[j]\n\n            Since the number of distinct second characters is at most 11, we can do a double loop.\n\n        Similarly, for the same second character and different first character: \n            For a fixed second character b, we have counts for each first character a in group_by_second[b]. Then the pairs for the same second character and different first character is:\n                for i in range(len(counts_second)):\n                    for j in range(i+1, len(counts_second)):\n                        total_same_second += counts_second[i] * counts_second[j]\n\n        Then the answer for the test case = total_same_first + total_same_second.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because the total n over test cases is 10^5, and the distinct groups are at most 11 per first character and 11 per second character, so the double loop is 11*11 per group, and the total groups (by first character) is at most 11 (since first character is from 'a' to 'k')? Actually, the first character can be any of 11, and for each first character we have at most 11 distinct second characters. Similarly for the second character groups. So the total work per test case is O(11*11* (number of distinct first characters + number of distinct second characters)) which is O(11*11* (11+11)) = O(11^3) which is 1331 per test case. But the total n over test cases is 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 100, so worst-case 100 * 1331 = 133100, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the double loop by using:\n\n    total_same_first = 0\n    for a, d in group_by_first.items():\n        s = sum(d.values())\n        # Now, the sum of products of distinct second characters: \n        #   = (s^2 - sum_b (cnt_b^2)) // 2\n        # because: \n        #   (sum_b cnt_b)^2 = sum_b cnt_b^2 + 2 * sum_{i<j} cnt_i * cnt_j\n        # so: sum_{i<j} cnt_i * cnt_j = (s^2 - sum_b cnt_b^2) // 2\n        sq = 0\n        for cnt in d.values():\n            sq += cnt * cnt\n        total_same_first += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n    Similarly for group_by_second.\n\nBut note: we are using integer division and s*s might be large, but n<=10^5 per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the maximum s in one group is at most 10^5? But the groups are by first character, and the first character has at most 11 distinct second characters, so the maximum s is the total number of strings in that first character group, which can be up to 10^5? But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the maximum s in one group in one test case is <= 10^5. But 10^5 squared is 10^10, which is acceptable in Python? Actually, we are using integers and 10^10 is 10 billion, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer may be large and we must use 64-bit integers. This formula uses integers.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n    total = 0\n    # For group_by_first: \n    for key, d in group_by_first.items():\n        s = sum(d.values())\n        sq = 0\n        for cnt in d.values():\n            sq += cnt * cnt\n        total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n    # For group_by_second: \n    for key, d in group_by_second.items():\n        s = sum(d.values())\n        sq = 0\n        for cnt in d.values():\n            sq += cnt * cnt\n        total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\nBut note: we are using two dictionaries. We can build them in one pass.\n\nHowever, the provided code structure is:\n\n    for ii in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        a = []\n        for jj in range(n):\n            a.append(input())\n\n        # We are going to build two dictionaries: group_by_first and group_by_second.\n\n        group_by_first = {}\n        group_by_second = {}\n\n        for s in a:\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n\n            # For group_by_first\n            if c1 not in group_by_first:\n                group_by_first[c1] = {}\n            if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\n                group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n            # For group_by_second\n            if c2 not in group_by_second:\n                group_by_second[c2] = {}\n            if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\n                group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n        total = 0\n        for d in group_by_first.values():\n            s = sum(d.values())\n            sq = sum(cnt*cnt for cnt in d.values())\n            total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n        for d in group_by_second.values():\n            s = sum(d.values())\n            sq = sum(cnt*cnt for cnt in d.values())\n            total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut note: the provided code already has a variable `co` that is printed. We are replacing the inner loop with this.\n\nSo the missing part in the provided code is the entire efficient method? But the provided code has a nested loop that we must replace.\n\nLooking at the provided code:\n\n    for ii in range(int(input())):\r\n        n=int(input())\r\n        a=[]\r\n        co=0\r\n        x=set()\r\n        for jj in range(n):\r\n            a.append(input())\r\n        # Then a nested loop that is O(n^2)\r\n        # We are going to remove the nested loop and replace with the efficient method.\n\nSo we must replace from the line after building the list `a` until the print.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are to output the code that replaces the current nested loop and the counting.\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is the efficient counting using dictionaries.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only to output the missing block that goes in the TODO? Actually, the TODO is in the inner loop. However, the entire approach of the provided code is flawed for large n. We must change the entire counting.\n\nThe TODO is only in one line? But the provided code has:\n\n    elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\r\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut that is inside a double loop. We cannot fix that by just one line. We must change the entire approach.\n\nTherefore, we are allowed to change the entire block? The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". So we can replace the entire block from the point after reading the input.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the code that should replace the current nested loop and the counting.\n\nSo for program1, we output:\n\n    group_by_first = {}\n    group_by_second = {}\n    for s in a:\n        c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n        if c1 not in group_by_first:\n            group_by_first[c1] = {}\n        if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\n        group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n        if c2 not in group_by_second:\n            group_by_second[c2] = {}\n        if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\n        group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n    co = 0\n    for d in group_by_first.values():\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\n    for d in group_by_second.values():\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\nBut note: the original code had a set `x` and a variable `mul` that are not used in this approach. We are replacing the entire nested loop and the counting.\n\nSo we remove the nested loop and the set `x` and the `mul` and do the above.\n\nBut note: the original code had:\n    for jj in range(n): ... with a nested loop.\n\nWe are replacing from the line after building `a` until the `print(co)`.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We are to output the code that goes in the place of the current nested loop? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the block that should be inserted in the TODO? But the TODO is only in one branch. However, the entire approach is inefficient and we must change it.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we are to complete the code by providing the missing block. Since the current approach is inefficient and the problem constraints require efficiency, we must change the entire counting.\n\nTherefore, for program1, we output the above block of code that builds the dictionaries and computes `co`.\n\nBut note: the original code had a set `x` and a variable `mul` that we are not using. We are replacing the entire nested loop and the initialization of `co` (which was 0) and the set `x`. We are going to set `co` to 0 again and then compute it.\n\nSo the code we output for program1 is:\n\n    group_by_first = {}\n    group_by_second = {}\n    for s in a:\n        c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n        if c1 not in group_by_first:\n            group_by_first[c1] = {}\n        if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\n        group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n        if c2 not in group_by_second:\n            group_by_second[c2] = {}\n        if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\n        group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n    co = 0\n    for d in group_by_first.values():\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\n    for d in group_by_second.values():\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because the original code had `co` as the counter. We are setting `co` to the computed value.\n\nHowever, the original code had `co` initialized to 0 and then the nested loop added to it. We are replacing the nested loop with this.\n\nSo we remove the nested loop and the set `x` and the `mul` and put this.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are replacing a block. We output the code that should be placed from the point after reading the list `a` until the `print(co)`, but without the `print(co)`? Actually, the `print(co)` is still there. We are only replacing the counting part.\n\nIn the original code, after reading `a`, there was:\n\n    for jj in range(n): ... (a long loop)\n\nWe are replacing that entire loop and the initialization of `co`? Actually, we are keeping `co=0` at the top? But we are going to recompute `co` from scratch.\n\nBut note: the original `co=0` is there. We are going to set `co` again to 0? Actually, we can do:\n\n    co = 0   # we can leave the initial co=0, but then we are going to reassign? \n\nBut in our code we set `co = 0` again. So we can do:\n\n    # Remove the nested loop and the set x and the mul, and do:\n\n    group_by_first = {}\n    group_by_second = {}\n    ... (as above)\n\nBut the original code had `co=0` at the top. We are going to use that `co` and then add to it? Actually, we are going to set `co` to the total we computed. So we can do:\n\n    # Instead of the nested loop, we do:\n\n    group_by_first = {}\n    group_by_second = {}\n    ... (building dictionaries)\n\n    co = 0   # reset co to 0 because we are going to compute from scratch\n    ... (then the two loops to add to co)\n\nBut the original `co` was 0 at the beginning. So we can reassign.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    # Remove the nested loop and the set x and the mul, and then do the efficient counting.\n\nSo the missing block for program1 is the entire efficient counting code.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the JSON.\n\nSo for program1, we output the string:\n\n    group_by_first = {}\n    group_by_second = {}\n    for s in a:\n        c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n        if c1 not in group_by_first:\n            group_by_first[c1] = {}\n        if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\n        group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n        if c2 not in group_by_second:\n            group_by_second[c2] = {}\n        if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\n        group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n    co = 0\n    for d in group_by_first.values():\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\n    for d in group_by_second.values():\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\nBut note: we must be cautious about the indentation. The entire block is at the same indentation level as the previous `for jj in range(n):` that built the list `a`.\n\nBut the original code after building `a` had the nested loop. We are replacing that nested loop with this block.\n\n### program2.py\nThe problem: Count the number of distinct multisets of palindromic integers that sum to n. This is a classic partition problem but only using palindromic numbers.\n\nWe note that the palindromic numbers are the available coins. We are to count the number of ways to form the sum n (order doesn't matter) using these coins.\n\nWe are to do it for n up to 40000 and t up to 10000.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n    R=range\n    m=40001\n    d=10**9+7\n    p=[]\n    for i in R(1,m):\n        n=str(i)\n        if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n    a=[1]+[0]*m\n    for i in p:\n        for j in R(i,m):\n            a[j]+=a[j-i];a[j]%=d\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:print(a[int(n)])\n\nWe see that the TODO is in the palindrome check. We are building a list `p` of palindromic numbers. The condition `if n==n[::-1]` is checking if the string representation is a palindrome. Then we should append `i` to `p`.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n        p.append(i)\n\nBut note: the next part is a dynamic programming for the coin change (unbounded knapsack) for the number of ways. We are generating the array `a` where `a[j]` is the number of ways to form the sum `j` using the coins in `p`.\n\nBut note: the coin change problem for distinct multisets (order doesn't matter) and the coins are available infinitely. The initialization: `a[0]=1` and then for each coin `i` we iterate `j` from `i` to `m` and do `a[j] += a[j-i]`.\n\nThis is standard.\n\nSo the missing line is: `p.append(i)`\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n\n    for i in R(1,m):\n        n=str(i)\n        if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to append `i` to `p` when it is a palindrome.\n\nSo the missing code for program2 is:\n\n        p.append(i)\n\nBut note: the variable `n` is being reused? Actually, in the loop we have `n=str(i)`, and then later we have `for n in [*open(0)][1:]`. That is okay because the loop for `i` is done by then.\n\nSo for program2, the missing code is: `p.append(i)`\n\nBut note: the indentation. It should be inside the if and inside the for loop.\n\nSo the line is: `        p.append(i)`\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output that one line.\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: Check if a six-digit ticket is lucky (sum of first three digits equals sum of last three digits).\n\nThe provided code:\n\n    import sys\r\n\r\n    def main():\r\n        s = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\\n')[1:]\r\n        r = []\r\n        for i in s:\r\n            # TODO: Your code here\r\n        return r\r\n    print(*main(), sep='\\n')\n\nWe are to complete the TODO. For each ticket string `i` (which is a string of six digits), we need to check if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits.\n\nWe can do:\n\n    first_three = i[:3]\n    last_three = i[3:]\n    sum1 = sum(int(x) for x in first_three)\n    sum2 = sum(int(x) for x in last_three)\n    if sum1 == sum2:\n        r.append(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the ticket is a string of six digits.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])):\n        r.append(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        r.append(\"NO\")\n\nSo the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut we can do it in one line? However, for clarity, we break it down.\n\nBut note: the problem says the ticket is a string of six digits, so we can index.\n\nSo the missing block for program3 is:\n\n        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n        if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]):\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut the above is two lines. We can write:\n\n        r.append(\"YES\" if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut the problem does not require the most compact.\n\nWe'll output:\n\n        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the indentation. It should be inside the for loop.\n\nSo the missing code for program3 is:\n\n        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\n### Summary\n\nWe now have the missing code for each program.\n\nWe output a JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"group_by_first = {}\\n    group_by_second = {}\\n    for s in a:\\n        c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n        if c1 not in group_by_first:\\n            group_by_first[c1] = {}\\n        if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\\n        group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n\\n        if c2 not in group_by_second:\\n            group_by_second[c2] = {}\\n        if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\\n        group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\n    co = 0\\n    for d in group_by_first.values():\\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\\n\\n    for d in group_by_second.values():\\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\",\n  \"program2\": \"        p.append(i)\",\n  \"program3\": \"        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        else:\\n            r.append(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: we must escape the quotes? Actually, the JSON standard requires double quotes and escaping of inner double quotes. But the inner string for program1 has single quotes, so it's okay. For program3, we have double quotes in the string \"YES\" and \"NO\". We must escape them? \n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON string? But the JSON standard requires double quotes for keys and string values. However, the string values can contain any character as long as we escape the double quotes and backslashes.\n\nBut the program3 code has double quotes. We must escape them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes in the code for the string? In Python, both single and double quotes are allowed. So we can change the double quotes to single quotes in the code for program3.\n\nSo for program3, we can write:\n\n        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append('YES')\n        else:\n            r.append('NO')\n\nThen we don't have to escape.\n\nAlternatively, we can escape the double quotes in the JSON string.\n\nBut the problem does not specify, so we can use single quotes in the code.\n\nSo we change to single quotes.\n\nTherefore, the final missing code for program3 is:\n\n        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append('YES')\n        else:\n            r.append('NO')\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nBut note: the program1 code has a long string. We must be careful with newlines. We use \\n to represent newlines.\n\nWe write the JSON as a string.\n\nLet's code the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"group_by_first = {}\\n    group_by_second = {}\\n    for s in a:\\n        c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n        if c1 not in group_by_first:\\n            group_by_first[c1] = {}\\n        if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\\n        group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n\\n        if c2 not in group_by_second:\\n            group_by_second[c2] = {}\\n        if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\\n        group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\n    co = 0\\n    for d in group_by_first.values():\\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\\n\\n    for d in group_by_second.values():\\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\",\n  \"program2\": \"        p.append(i)\",\n  \"program3\": \"        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append('YES')\\n        else:\\n            r.append('NO')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has an extra closing parenthesis? Let me check:\n\n    co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2   -> this is correct.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we have to represent the newlines as \\n and the quotes as is? Actually, we are writing a string in JSON, so we must escape the backslashes and the quotes? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a triple quoted string in Python to write the JSON? But the problem says output the JSON.\n\nWe are writing the JSON as a string. We must escape the double quotes inside the string values? \n\nBut the program1 and program2 and program3 strings do not contain double quotes? \n  program1: uses single quotes for the dictionary keys? Actually, no: the keys are characters, so we use single quotes? In the code we have: \n        if c1 not in group_by_first:   -> c1 is a string of one character, so we can use either, but in the code we are not using quotes for the keys? Actually, the keys are variables that are strings. The code is written without quotes in the condition.\n\nBut wait, the code we wrote for program1 uses single quotes for the characters? Actually, no: we are using the variable `s` which is a string of two characters, and we are indexing. The characters are stored as strings. The condition:\n\n        if c1 not in group_by_first:\n\nThis is valid.\n\nBut the entire program1 string does not contain any double quotes? So we can put it as is.\n\nSimilarly, program2: no double quotes.\n\nprogram3: we changed to single quotes.\n\nSo we can write the JSON without escaping.\n\nBut note: the entire JSON must be a string. We output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"group_by_first = {}\\n    group_by_second = {}\\n    for s in a:\\n        c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n        if c1 not in group_by_first:\\n            group_by_first[c1] = {}\\n        if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\\n        group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n\\n        if c2 not in group_by_second:\\n            group_by_second[c2] = {}\\n        if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\\n        group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\n    co = 0\\n    for d in group_by_first.values():\\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\\n\\n    for d in group_by_second.values():\\n        s_val = sum(d.values())\\n        sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n        co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\", \"program2\": \"        p.append(i)\", \"program3\": \"        first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\\n        second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append('YES')\\n        else:\\n            r.append('NO')\"}\n\nBut note: the program1 string has a lot of newlines and spaces. We are representing newlines as \\n and the spaces are kept.\n\nThis should be acceptable.\n\nLet me check the program1 code: the indentation is 4 spaces per level? The original code in the problem had 4 spaces. We are outputting the same.\n\nBut note: the entire program1 block is at the same indentation level as the previous code (which was the reading of `a`). The previous code was:\n\n    for ii in range(int(input())):\r\n        n=int(input())\r\n        a=[]\r\n        co=0\r\n        x=set()\r\n        for jj in range(n):\r\n            a.append(input())\r\n        # Then we put our block\n\nSo the block we output is at the same indentation (one level in).\n\nWe are outputting:\n\n    group_by_first = {}\n    group_by_second = {}\n    ... \n\nwith each line having 4 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the entire block is inside the for loop for the test case, so it should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\nBut the problem did not specify the exact indentation. However, the provided code in the problem used 4 spaces per level.\n\nIn the JSON string, we have:\n\n    \"group_by_first = {}\\n    group_by_second = {}\\n    for s in a:\\n        ...\"\n\nThe first line has no extra spaces? But the next lines have 4 spaces? Actually, the entire block is at the same level as the previous code (which was the reading loop). The reading loop was:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\r\n            a.append(input())\n\nSo the next line should be at the same level: 4 spaces from the test case loop.\n\nOur block starts at 4 spaces from the test case loop. Then the inner lines are 8 spaces? \n\nBut in the JSON string, we have:\n\n    \"group_by_first = {}\\n    group_by_second = {}\\n    for s in a:\\n        ...\"\n\nThe first line: \"group_by_first = {}\" has no leading spaces? Then we have \"    group_by_second = {}\", which is 4 spaces? \n\nWe must output the entire block with the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\nThe surrounding code in the test case loop is indented by 4 spaces. So the entire block we are inserting should be indented by 4 spaces. Therefore, each line of the block should be prefixed by 4 spaces? \n\nBut the original code for the nested loop was:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\r\n            mul=1\r\n            if jj not in x:\r\n                for kk in range(jj+1,n):\r\n                    ... \n\nSo we are replacing that with a block that is also at 4 spaces.\n\nIn our block, the first line is:\n\n    group_by_first = {}\n\nThis should be at 4 spaces. Then the next line is:\n\n    group_by_second = {}\n\nalso at 4 spaces.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we have the first line without spaces? We must include the 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\nActually, the entire block is at the same level. We should output:\n\n        group_by_first = {}\n        group_by_second = {}\n        for s in a:\n            ... \n\nSo each line of the block should be prefixed by 8 spaces? No, because the test case loop is at 4 spaces, and the block is at the same level as the previous `for jj in range(n):` that built the list. So the block should be at 4 spaces.\n\nBut the previous line that built the list `a` was:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\n            a.append(input())\n\nSo after that, we are at 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the block we output should be at 4 spaces. So the code we write in the JSON for program1 should have each line starting with 4 spaces? Actually, no: the entire block is one level (4 spaces) and the inner loops are two levels (8 spaces). \n\nBut the problem does not require the exact indentation? The problem says the code must run. In Python, indentation matters.\n\nWe must output the code with the correct indentation.\n\nThe structure:\n\n    for ii in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        a = []\n        ... (building a)\n        # Then our block: at 4 spaces\n\n        group_by_first = {}   # at 4 spaces\n        group_by_second = {}  # at 4 spaces\n        for s in a:           # at 4 spaces\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]   # at 8 spaces\n            if c1 not in group_by_first:   # at 8 spaces\n                ...   # at 12 spaces\n\nSo in the JSON string, we must represent:\n\n    \"        group_by_first = {}\\n        group_by_second = {}\\n        for s in a:\\n            ...\"\n\nBut the problem did not specify the exact number of spaces. The original code used 4 per level.\n\nIn the provided code for program1, the initial code had:\n\n        for jj in range(n):   # 4 spaces\n            a.append(input())   # 8 spaces\n\nSo our block should be at 4 spaces, and the inner block at 8, and then 12, etc.\n\nTherefore, we must output the block with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The block we are replacing was at 4 spaces. We output the block as it would appear in the program.\n\nSo for program1, we output:\n\n        group_by_first = {}\n        group_by_second = {}\n        for s in a:\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n            if c1 not in group_by_first:\n                group_by_first[c1] = {}\n            if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\n                group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n            if c2 not in group_by_second:\n                group_by_second[c2] = {}\n            if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\n                group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n        co = 0\n        for d in group_by_first.values():\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\n        for d in group_by_second.values():\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\nBut note: the last two for loops are at 8 spaces? Actually, no: the entire block is at 4 spaces, and the inner loops are at 8 spaces.\n\nBut in the JSON, we must represent this as a string with newlines and spaces.\n\nSo the string for program1 becomes:\n\n        group_by_first = {}\n        group_by_second = {}\n        for s in a:\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n            if c1 not in group_by_first:\n                group_by_first[c1] = {}\n            if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\n                group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n            if c2 not in group_by_second:\n                group_by_second[c2] = {}\n            if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\n                group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n        co = 0\n        for d in group_by_first.values():\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\n        for d in group_by_second.values():\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\n\nBut note: the very first line has 8 spaces? Actually, no: the entire block is at 4 spaces, so each line should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the test case loop. But the test case loop is at 0 and 4. So the block is at 4.\n\nIn the JSON string, we will have:\n\n    \"        group_by_first = {}\\n        group_by_second = {}\\n        for s in a:\\n            ...\"\n\nThis means each line of the block is prefixed by 8 spaces? But that is because the surrounding code in the test case loop is already at 4 spaces. The block is at the same level, so it should be 4 spaces. \n\nBut the problem's initial code for the test case loop had:\n\n    for ii in range(int(input())):\r\n        n=int(input())\r\n        a=[]\r\n        co=0\r\n        x=set()\r\n        for jj in range(n):\r\n            a.append(input())\n\nThe lines after the first are at 4 spaces.\n\nOur block is replacing from the line after the inner loop that built `a`. So the block should be at 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON string, we should not add extra spaces? The block we output is at 4 spaces, so each line should be represented as starting with 4 spaces? \n\nBut the initial `group_by_first = {}` should be at 4 spaces. How do we represent that in the string? We include the 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\nBut the entire program1 string in the JSON will then have:\n\n    \"        group_by_first = {}\\n        group_by_second = {}\\n        ...\"\n\nwith 8 spaces at the beginning of the first line? That is because the surrounding code in the test case loop is at 4 spaces, and we are including 4 more spaces? \n\nActually, the block is at the same level as the previous `n=int(input())` which is at 4 spaces. So we output the block with 4 spaces per line? \n\nBut the previous code had:\n\n        n=int(input())   # 4 spaces\n\nSo our block should be:\n\n        group_by_first = {}   # 4 spaces\n\nTherefore, in the JSON string, we write the block with each line starting with 8 characters of spaces? No, we write the block as it would appear in the program: with 4 spaces for the outer block and then 8 for the inner, etc.\n\nBut the entire block is at one level: 4 spaces. The first line of the block is at 4 spaces, the next at 4, then the for loop at 4, and the body of the for loop at 8, etc.\n\nSo the string for program1 should be:\n\n\"        group_by_first = {}\\n        group_by_second = {}\\n        for s in a:\\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n            if c1 not in group_by_first:\\n                group_by_first[c1] = {}\\n            if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\\n                group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n\\n            if c2 not in group_by_second:\\n                group_by_second[c2] = {}\\n            if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\\n                group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\n        co = 0\\n        for d in group_by_first.values():\\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\\n\\n        for d in group_by_second.values():\\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\"\n\nBut this has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? That is because the entire block is at 4 spaces, and we are representing it in the string with 8 spaces? \n\nActually, in the program, the block is at 4 spaces, but when we output the string in the JSON, we are including the 4 spaces as part of the string. That is correct.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not care about the exact indentation as long as it is valid Python. But to be safe, we do the correct indentation.\n\nFor program2, the missing code is one line: `        p.append(i)`\n\nThis line is inside the for loop and the if, so it should be at 12 spaces? \n\nThe program2 code:\n\n    for i in R(1,m):\n        n=str(i)\n        if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at 8 spaces (one level in). The next line should be at 12 spaces.\n\nSo we output: `        p.append(i)` -> but this has 8 spaces? Actually, the surrounding code:\n\n    for i in R(1,m):   # 4 spaces\n        n=str(i)        # 8 spaces\n        if n==n[::-1]:  # 8 spaces\n            ...         # 12 spaces\n\nSo the missing line should be at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, for program2, we output: `            p.append(i)`\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the line with the correct indentation.\n\nFor program3, the missing block is at 8 spaces (inside the function and the for loop). The surrounding code:\n\n    def main():\n        s = ...   # 4 spaces\n        r = []    # 4 spaces\n        for i in s:   # 4 spaces\n            ...   # 8 spaces\n\nSo the block should be at 8 spaces.\n\nWe output:\n\n            first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n            second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n            if first_sum == second_sum:\n                r.append('YES')\n            else:\n                r.append('NO')\n\nSo in the JSON string for program3, we have:\n\n            first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\\n            second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\\n            if first_sum == second_sum:\\n                r.append('YES')\\n            else:\\n                r.append('NO')\n\n### Final JSON\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        group_by_first = {}\\n        group_by_second = {}\\n        for s in a:\\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n            if c1 not in group_by_first:\\n                group_by_first[c1] = {}\\n            if c2 not in group_by_first[c1]:\\n                group_by_first[c1][c2] = 0\\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n\\n            if c2 not in group_by_second:\\n                group_by_second[c2] = {}\\n            if c1 not in group_by_second[c2]:\\n                group_by_second[c2][c1] = 0\\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\n        co = 0\\n        for d in group_by_first.values():\\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\\n\\n        for d in group_by_second.values():\\n            s_val = sum(d.values())\\n            sq = sum(cnt * cnt for cnt in d.values())\\n            co += (s_val * s_val - sq) // 2\",\n  \"program2\": \"            p.append(i)\",\n  \"program3\": \"            first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\\n            second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\\n            if first_sum == second_sum:\\n                r.append('YES')\\n            else:\\n                r.append('NO')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 string has a long line. We are using \\n for newlines.\n\nWe output this JSON."
