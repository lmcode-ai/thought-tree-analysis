However, we can also relate the moves to the next element: The net forward moves from i to i+1 must be the same as the net forward moves from i+1 to i+2 plus ...? Actually, a known solution for similar problems (like \"Array Restoration\" or \"Zero Array\") is:\n\n      Let s[0] = 0\n      For i from 0 to n-1:\n          s[i+1] = s[i] + a[i]\n\n      Conditions:\n        1. s[i] >= 0 for all i in [0, n-1]\n        2. s[n] = 0\n        3. Once s[i] becomes 0, then for all j>i, s[j] must be 0 and a[j] must be 0.

Then break the outer too?\n              break   # breaks the outer for loop after the inner one? The break after the inner loop would break the outer loop? Actually, the break is at the same level as the inner for, so after the inner for, we break the outer loop. However, the condition: if we break because we found a non-zero after a zero in the partial sums, then we should set v=False and break both loops. So the TODO is: if we find any non-zero in the rest of the array after we have hit a zero in the partial sums, then it's invalid. Therefore, we can do:\n\n      for j in range(i+1, n):\n          if a[j] ! = 0:\n              v = False\n              break   # breaks the inner for loop\n\n      Then we break the outer loop? But note: after the inner for, we break the outer loop (because of the break after the inner for). However, if we set v=False in the inner loop, we want to break the outer loop as well? But the code already breaks the outer loop after the inner for. But what if we break the inner loop because of non-zero? Then we set v=False and then break the outer loop? That is acceptable. However, we must also break the outer loop in that case? Actually, the code has:\n\n      elif b==0:\n          for j in ...:\n              if a[j]!=0:\n                  v = False\n                  break   # breaks the inner for\n          break   # breaks the outer for\n\n  This break after the inner for will break the outer for regardless of what happened in the inner for. That is, even if we set v=False, we break the outer for and then the next condition is:\n\n      if v and sum(a)==0: ... But note: we break the outer for after the first time b becomes zero. However, what if the partial sums become zero at multiple points? The problem says: we break at the first time b becomes zero. Then we check the rest of the array must be zero.

So we can set a flag and then avoid recalculating? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable. However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case total n is 200000. So recalculating the sum for each test case would be O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so worst-case total operations is 200000 (for the first loop) plus 200000 (for the sum) = 400000, which is acceptable. But note: the code already breaks the loop early in many cases. So we can leave the condition as `if v and sum(a)==0`. However, there is a catch: what if we break because of negative? Then we set v=False and break. Then we don't break the outer loop? Actually, we break the inner for? No, we break the entire inner for? Actually, the code:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          b += a[i]\n          if b<0:\n              v = False\n              break   # breaks the outer for\n          elif b==0:\n              ... # inner for and then break So if we break because of negative, we break the outer for and then skip the rest of the array. Then we check: if v and sum(a)==0 -> but v is False, so we print NO. But if we break because of negative, we haven't processed the entire array. Then the condition `sum(a)==0` would be the entire array? That is O(n). We can avoid that by not recalculating the entire sum? Alternatively, we can change the condition to:\n\n      if v and (b==0 or ...) Actually, we can do:\n\n      if v and ( (we broke early and the rest is zero) or (we didn't break and b==0) ) But the code doesn't track that. Since the constraints are low (total n 200000) and we are breaking early in many cases, we can leave the condition as `if v and sum(a)==0`. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case total n is 200000. The condition `sum(a)` for each test case: the total n is 200000, so the total operations for the `sum` is 200000. So overall it's 200000 (for the partial sums loop) + 200000 (for the sum) = 400000, which is acceptable. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      v = False\n      break\n\n  But note: we break the inner for, and then the next statement is `break` (which breaks the outer for). So we set v to False and then break the inner for, then break the outer for.",

Then after swapping, the first array becomes: we replaced min(m, n-m) non-x with x. So the first array now has m + min(m, n-m) x's. Example: \n            n=6, m=3 (so we have 3 of the most frequent element, say '0'). Step1: clone -> operations=1, now we have two arrays: [0,0,0,1,2,3] and [0,0,0,1,2,3].\n            Then we swap: we want to bring more 0's to the first array. We can swap the non-0's in the first array (positions 3,4,5: values 1,2,3) with the 0's in the second array. We can swap up to min(3, 3) = 3 swaps. Then we do 3 swaps -> operations becomes 1+3=4, and the first array becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0] -> done? But wait, we only needed 4 operations? But the example in the note had 6 operations. However, the example in the note: \n            Array: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (for 0 and 3). Actually, 0 appears twice, 3 appears twice, so m=2. Then: \n                while m(2)<6:\n                    operations += 1 (clone) -> 1\n                    t = min(2, 6-2)=min(2,4)=2\n                    operations += 2 -> 3\n                    m = 2+2 = 4\n                then while m(4)<6:\n                    operations += 1 -> 4\n                    t = min(4,2)=2\n                    operations += 2 -> 6\n                    m = 4+2=6 -> break. So the answer is 6. Therefore, the while loop should update:\n\n              r += 1   # for the clone operation\n              t = min(m, n - m)\n              r += t   # for the t swaps\n              m += t   # we increased the number of the desired element in the target array by t So the missing code is:\n\n              r += 1\n              t = min(m, n - m)\n              r += t\n              m += t\n\n          But note: the variable `m` is updated and then the while condition is rechecked. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      r += 1\n      t = min(m, n - m)\n      r += t\n      m += t\n\n  However, note: the variable `t` is used in the next iteration?",

Then it computes `res` by iterating over the vertices and calling `get_area` for each consecutive four vertices? Actually, the call: `get_area((i-1+n)%n, i%n, (i+1)%n, (i+2)%n)`. The function `get_area` is defined to take four indices: _ i, ni, i_, i_2 (which we can call A, B, C, D: the previous, current, next, and next next). The idea: the region S is the set of points that are within distance 1/2 from the boundary? Actually, no: the chord passing through Q of length at most 1. But note: the chord must be entirely in the polygon? Actually, the problem says: a chord of the polygon passing through Q with length not exceeding 1. So Q must lie on a chord of length <=1. The set S is the union of all chords of length <=1. This is known as the set of points that are at most 1/2 from the boundary? Not exactly: because the chord might be in any direction. However, the problem is non\u2010trivial. The provided code has a function `binary_find` that does a binary search over angles? The TODO in `binary_find` is in the inner while loop:\n\n      while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n          mid_a = (ra + la) / 2.0\n          yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          if yy > mid_y:\n              ra = mid_a\n\n  But note: the condition is:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: then we want to adjust la or ra?\n\n  The binary search is trying to find an angle `mid_a` such that `yy` equals `mid_y`? The code in the other branch (for `lb` and `rb`) is:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          rb = mid_b\n\n  So similarly, for the first branch: if yy < mid_y:\n          la = mid_a   # because we want a larger angle? Why? In the second branch, when yy < mid_y, we set lb=mid_b (so we move the lower bound up). Similarly, here we should set la=mid_a. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the condition in the second branch is: if yy < mid_y: lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y: rb = mid_b So we do the same for the first branch. Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  However, note: the code has two while loops: one for `la, ra` and one for `lb, rb`. The first while loop is for the left side (angle at the first vertex) and the second for the right side. The function `binary_find` is called with `la, lb, ra, rb, cy, fy, alpha_1, alpha_2, ab`. The initial `la, lb` are 0.0, and `ra, rb` are `pi - alpha_1` and `pi - alpha_2`. The goal is to find angles `la, ra` (for the left) and `lb, rb` (for the right) such that ...? The rest of the code in `get_area` then uses these angles to compute an area. Since the problem is very complex and the code is provided with a TODO only in that one line, we fill that line. But note: the condition in the first while loop: \n\n      if yy < mid_y: then we set la = mid_a? if yy > mid_y: then we set ra = mid_a. This is a standard binary search to find the angle that makes `yy` equal to `mid_y`. Since `yy` is increasing or decreasing with `mid_a`? We don't know, but the code in the other branch does the same. Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  However, note: the code has two if statements? What if yy==mid_y? Then we break? But the condition is while (ra-la)>eps, so we break eventually. But the code does:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: ... if yy > mid_y: ... If yy==mid_y, then we break the inner while? Actually, we break when the difference is <=eps. So it's safe. But note: the code in the other branch for the second angle uses: if yy < mid_y: lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y: rb = mid_b\n\n  So we do the same. Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the problem has a note that the answer might be printed with a special condition: \n\n      if math.fabs(res-1.02638863065) < 100*eps: print('1.04719792254')\n      if math.fabs(res-1.04692745180) < 100*eps:\n          print('1.04720015894')",

We are only to fill the TODO. So the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the code has a comment: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We write: `la = mid_a`\n\n  However, the code has two if conditions? What if both conditions are true? Actually, if yy < mid_y, we set la=mid_a and then the next condition (if yy>mid_y) is false? So we can write: if yy < mid_y: la = mid_a\n      elif yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  But the original code for the second branch uses two separate ifs. So we do the same. Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: la = mid_a\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  This is acceptable. But the provided code for the second branch does exactly that. Therefore, we write: la = mid_a\n\n  and leave the next condition as is. But note: the code already has the next condition: `if yy > mid_y: ra = mid_a`. So we only need to fill the first if. So the missing line is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  However, the problem says: Output only the missing code. We output the line that goes in the TODO. But note: the TODO is in the inner while loop for the first angle. Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the code has an indentation level. We must output the code with the same indentation? The problem says: output the missing code. We output the line that should replace the TODO. The current code at the TODO is:\n\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace that with:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the next line is `if yy > mid_y: ...` which is already there. So the missing code for program3.py is the single line: `la = mid_a`\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the specified JSON. We now output the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"v = False\\n        break\",\n        \"program2\": \"r += 1\\n d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += d\\n        m += d\",\n        \"program3\": \"la = mid_a\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program1 code: we have two lines. We must preserve the indentation? The original code has 8 spaces for the inner for loop, and then 12 spaces for the if block? Actually, the code:\n\n          for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] ! = 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at an indentation of 20 spaces? Actually, we are in a for loop, then an if, then the TODO. We write:\n\n          for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] ! = 0:\n                    v = False\n                    break\n\n  So the two lines: `v = False` and `break` at the same indentation level. But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines as:\n\n        \"program1\": \"v = False\\n                    break\"\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing code\".",

Since the outer scope does not use `t` (the test case variable is not in this function), we can use `t`. But note: the for loop is:\n\n      for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n = len(a := a.split())\n          m = max(Counter(a).values())\n          r = 0\n          while m < n:\n              # TODO So `t` is not used.

We output the three lines. The program3.py: we output the single line: `la = mid_a`\n\n  But note: the code in the TODO is in a while loop and has an if condition. We output only the line that goes inside the if.

The original code has:\n\n      while m<n):\n          # TODO We replace with:\n\n      while m<n):\n          r += 1\n          t = min(m, n - m)\n          r += t\n          m += t So the four lines are at the same indentation level as the while. The original code uses 4 spaces per level. The while is at 4 spaces? Actually, the code:\n\n      for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n          while m<n:# TODO:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem: We have an array `a` and we want to know if we can obtain it by performing operations that either:\n  1. Move forward: increase current element by 1 and move to next.\n  2. Move backward: decrease current element by 1 and move to previous.\nBut the pointer must end at the first element.\n\nThe code provided reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`. It then uses a variable `b` (which seems to represent the current \"balance\" of operations) and a boolean `v` to check validity.\n\nThe current code does:\n  - It iterates `i` from 0 to n-1.\n  - It adds `a[i]` to `b`.\n  - If `b` becomes negative, it sets `v = False` and breaks (because we cannot have negative balance at any point).\n  - If `b` becomes zero, then it checks the rest of the array (from `i+1` to `n-1`) to see if all are zero. If not, it does something (currently a TODO).\n\nThe note says: In the first test case we can obtain the array but the pointer won't be on the first element. However, the problem states that after we are done the pointer must be on the first element.\n\nAfter reading the note and the example, we can deduce:\n\nThe operations must form a valid sequence that ends at the first element. The key observations are:\n  1. The total sum of the array must be zero (because every forward move adds 1 and backward subtracts 1, and we end at the start so the net displacement is zero? Actually, note: the operations are:\n        Operation1: [current] += 1 and move next -> net effect: we have added 1 to the current and moved to next.\n        Operation2: [current] -= 1 and move previous -> net effect: subtract 1 and move back.\n\n  However, note that the entire sequence must end at the first element. The net movement must be zero? But the operations are not independent: we start at the first element and end at the first element.\n\n  Actually, the net effect on the array: \n      Let the array be [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}].\n      Consider the operations: \n          Each time we move from i to i+1, we add 1 to a_i.\n          Each time we move from i to i-1, we subtract 1 from a_i.\n\n      Also note that we start at index0 and end at index0.\n\n      The movement forms a walk. The walk must start at 0 and end at 0.\n\n      We can model the walk as a sequence of steps. Let f(i) be the number of times we went from i to i+1, and g(i) be the number of times we went from i to i-1 (for i>=1, and for i=0 we cannot go back from 0). Then:\n          a0 = f(0) - g(1)   [because we start at 0: we leave 0 f(0) times (each adding 1) and we come back to 0 from 1 g(1) times (each subtracting 1 at index1, but then we move to 0 so we don't subtract at 0? Actually, when we are at index1 and we move back to 0, we subtract 1 at index1 and then we are at 0. So the value at index0 is only increased by the forward moves that start at 0 and decreased by the backward moves that start at 0? Actually, no: when we are at index0 and we do a forward move: we add 1 to a0 and move to index1. When we are at index1 and we do a backward move: we subtract 1 from a1 and move to index0. So the value at index0 is only the net of the forward moves that started at 0 and the backward moves that ended at 0? Actually, we never leave a0 without adding 1? And we never come back to 0 without having subtracted 1 at index1? \n\n  Actually, the value at index i is:\n      a_i = (number of times we arrived at i from i-1) - (number of times we left i to i+1) \n            + (number of times we arrived at i from i+1) - (number of times we left i to i-1) \n      But note: \n          When we leave i to i+1, we add 1 to a_i and then leave -> so that move contributes +1 to a_i and then we are at i+1.\n          When we leave i to i-1, we subtract 1 from a_i and then leave -> so that move contributes -1 to a_i and then we are at i-1.\n\n      Also, we start at 0 and end at 0.\n\n  Alternatively, we can model the entire walk as a sequence of steps and let the position at step k be p_k. Then:\n      a_{p_k} is modified at step k? Actually, the operation is done at the starting position of the step.\n\n  Actually, the problem is known and the solution is:\n      Condition 1: The total sum must be 0.\n      Condition 2: The partial sums (starting from the beginning) must be non-negative until we hit zero for the first time, and then the rest must be zero.\n\n  Why? \n      Let b_i be the net number of times we have passed from i to i+1 (forward) minus the number of times we have passed from i+1 to i (backward). Then the value at i is: \n          a_i = (forward moves starting at i) - (backward moves starting at i)\n          But note: \n            The forward moves starting at i: that's the number of times we were at i and moved to i+1.\n            The backward moves starting at i: that's the number of times we were at i and moved to i-1 (but note: we cannot move back from i=0).\n\n      However, we can also relate the moves to the next element: \n          The net forward moves from i to i+1 must be the same as the net forward moves from i+1 to i+2 plus ...? \n\n  Actually, a known solution for similar problems (like \"Array Restoration\" or \"Zero Array\") is:\n\n      Let s[0] = 0\n      For i from 0 to n-1:\n          s[i+1] = s[i] + a[i]\n\n      Conditions:\n        1. s[i] >= 0 for all i in [0, n-1]\n        2. s[n] = 0\n        3. Once s[i] becomes 0, then for all j>i, s[j] must be 0 and a[j] must be 0.\n\n  But note: the provided code does:\n\n      b = 0\n      v = True\n      for i in range(n):\n          b += a[i]\n          if b < 0:\n              v = False; break\n          elif b == 0:\n              for j in range(i+1, n):\n                  if a[j] != 0:\n                      # TODO: set v = False and break the inner loop? Then break the outer too?\n              break   # breaks the outer for loop after the inner one?\n\n  The break after the inner loop would break the outer loop? Actually, the break is at the same level as the inner for, so after the inner for, we break the outer loop.\n\n  However, the condition: if we break because we found a non-zero after a zero in the partial sums, then we should set v=False and break both loops.\n\n  So the TODO is: if we find any non-zero in the rest of the array after we have hit a zero in the partial sums, then it's invalid.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      for j in range(i+1, n):\n          if a[j] != 0:\n              v = False\n              break   # breaks the inner for loop\n\n      Then we break the outer loop? But note: after the inner for, we break the outer loop (because of the break after the inner for). However, if we set v=False in the inner loop, we want to break the outer loop as well? But the code already breaks the outer loop after the inner for.\n\n  But what if we break the inner loop because of non-zero? Then we set v=False and then break the outer loop? That is acceptable.\n\n  However, we must also break the outer loop in that case? Actually, the code has:\n\n      elif b==0:\n          for j in ...:\n              if a[j]!=0:\n                  v = False\n                  break   # breaks the inner for\n          break   # breaks the outer for\n\n  This break after the inner for will break the outer for regardless of what happened in the inner for. That is, even if we set v=False, we break the outer for and then the next condition is:\n\n      if v and sum(a)==0: ... \n\n  But note: we break the outer for after the first time b becomes zero. However, what if the partial sums become zero at multiple points? The problem says: we break at the first time b becomes zero. Then we check the rest of the array must be zero. \n\n  Actually, the condition is: once the partial sum becomes zero, we cannot have any non-zero after that? Because the pointer must end at the first element and we are at the first element at that point? But note: we are in the middle of the array. How can we be at the first element when we are at index i? \n\n  The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n      We simulate the walk. The pointer must be at the first element at the end. We can only leave the first element by going forward, and we can only come back to the first element by going backward from the second element. \n\n      Conditions:\n        - The total sum must be zero.\n        - The partial sums must be non-negative.\n        - The first time the partial sum becomes zero must be at the end? Actually, no: we can have the partial sum become zero at an intermediate step and then continue? But note: if we are at the first element at an intermediate step, then we can continue? However, the problem says \"after we are done\" the pointer must be at the first element. So we are not done until we finish the entire array.\n\n      Actually, the known solution (from similar problems) is:\n\n          def solve():\n              n = int(input())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              s = 0\n              seen_zero = False\n              for num in a:\n                  s += num\n                  if s < 0:\n                      print(\"No\")\n                      return\n                  if s == 0:\n                      seen_zero = True\n                  elif seen_zero:\n                      print(\"No\")\n                      return\n              if s != 0:\n                  print(\"No\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"Yes\")\n\n      But note: the problem says the array can be of length up to 200000 and the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can break early.\n\n      However, the provided code does:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              b += a[i]\n              if b<0: ... # invalid\n              elif b==0:\n                  for j in range(i+1, n):\n                      if a[j]!=0: ... # set v=False and break inner, then break outer\n                  break   # breaks the outer for\n\n      This is similar to the known solution: once we hit zero, we break and then check the rest must be zero. But the known solution above checks that after seeing a zero, we cannot have a non-zero? \n\n      So the TODO is: set v = False and break the inner loop. Then the outer break will break the outer loop.\n\n      Therefore, we can write:\n\n          for j in range(i+1, n):\n              if a[j] != 0:\n                  v = False\n                  break   # breaks the inner for\n\n      Then we break the outer for.\n\n  But note: what if we don't break in the inner for? Then v remains True and we break the outer for. Then we check at the end: if v and sum(a)==0 -> YES.\n\n  However, the condition at the end: we require the total sum to be zero? But note: we broke at the first time b==0, and then we checked the rest must be zero. Then the total sum is b (which is zero at that point) plus the rest (which we forced to be zero) so total sum is zero. But what if we break at the first zero and then the rest is zero, but then the total sum is zero? Then we print YES.\n\n  But what if we never break? Then we never hit the condition b==0? Then we don't break the outer for and we go until the end. Then we check at the end: if v (which is still True) and sum(a)==0 -> then YES.\n\n  However, if we never break and the partial sums never become zero until the last element, then we require that the last element makes the total sum zero? Because we break the loop and then check: if v and sum(a)==0.\n\n  But note: the variable `b` at the end is the total sum? Actually, we break the loop when we hit a zero (and then check the rest) or we complete the loop without breaking. Then we check: if v and sum(a)==0.\n\n  However, we can avoid recalculating the total sum by noting that `b` at the end of the loop (if we complete) is the total sum. But the code does: `sum(a)==0` which is O(n). We can change that to `b==0`? But note: if we break early, then `b` is zero at the break, but we also forced the rest to be zero so the total sum is zero. But if we break early, we don't compute the entire `b`? Actually, we break the loop at the first time we get b==0, and then we check the rest of the array to be zero. So the total sum is zero.\n\n  However, the code condition is: `if v and sum(a)==0`. This recalculates the entire array. But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n  But we can optimize: we already have the total sum in `b` if we didn't break? Actually, if we break in the middle, we break the loop and then `b` is the partial sum at the break (which is zero). Then we set `v` to True (if the rest is zero) or False (if the rest is not zero). Then we check the total sum? But if the rest is zero, then the total sum is zero. So we don't need to recalculate? \n\n  However, the code condition is: `if v and sum(a)==0`. But if we broke early and the rest is zero, then the total sum is zero. But if we didn't break early, then we have the entire `b` which is the total sum. So we can change the condition to:\n\n      if v and b==0:   # but note: if we broke early, then after the break, we set v to True (if the rest is zero) and then we break the loop. Then we check: but at that point, b is zero. However, if we didn't break, then we have the entire b.\n\n  But wait: if we broke early, we break the loop and then the condition is: if v and sum(a)==0. But we broke at index i (with b=0) and then we checked the rest (from i+1 to n-1) is zero. Then the total sum is 0. So we can avoid recalculating by storing the total sum? Or we can use the fact that if we broke at the first zero and the rest is zero, then the total sum is zero. But the code condition is: `if v and sum(a)==0`. This is inefficient.\n\n  Alternatively, we can note that if we broke early, then we know the total sum is zero (because we broke at a zero and the rest is zero). So we can set a flag and then avoid recalculating? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n  However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case total n is 200000. So recalculating the sum for each test case would be O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so worst-case total operations is 200000 (for the first loop) plus 200000 (for the sum) = 400000, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the code already breaks the loop early in many cases. So we can leave the condition as `if v and sum(a)==0`.\n\n  However, there is a catch: what if we break because of negative? Then we set v=False and break. Then we don't break the outer loop? Actually, we break the inner for? No, we break the entire inner for? Actually, the code:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          b += a[i]\n          if b<0:\n              v = False\n              break   # breaks the outer for\n          elif b==0:\n              ... # inner for and then break\n\n  So if we break because of negative, we break the outer for and then skip the rest of the array. Then we check: if v and sum(a)==0 -> but v is False, so we print NO.\n\n  But if we break because of negative, we haven't processed the entire array. Then the condition `sum(a)==0` would be the entire array? That is O(n). We can avoid that by not recalculating the entire sum? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the condition to:\n\n      if v and (b==0 or ...) \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      if v and ( (we broke early and the rest is zero) or (we didn't break and b==0) ) \n\n  But the code doesn't track that. \n\n  Since the constraints are low (total n 200000) and we are breaking early in many cases, we can leave the condition as `if v and sum(a)==0`.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case total n is 200000. The condition `sum(a)` for each test case: the total n is 200000, so the total operations for the `sum` is 200000. So overall it's 200000 (for the partial sums loop) + 200000 (for the sum) = 400000, which is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      v = False\n      break\n\n  But note: we break the inner for, and then the next statement is `break` (which breaks the outer for). So we set v to False and then break the inner for, then break the outer for.\n\n  Alternatively, we can break the outer for from the inner for by using a flag and then break twice? But the code already breaks the inner for and then the outer break is executed. So we set v=False and break the inner for, then break the outer for.\n\n  So:\n\n      for j in range(i+1, n):\n          if a[j] != 0:\n              v = False\n              break   # breaks the inner for\n      break   # breaks the outer for\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  However, what if we don't break the inner for? Then v remains True and we break the outer for. Then we check: if v and sum(a)==0 -> YES.\n\n  So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      v = False\n      break\n\n  But note: the break in the inner for is already there? The TODO is only the two lines inside the if.\n\n  So we write:\n\n      if a[j] != 0:\n          v = False\n          break\n\n  But note: the code already has the inner for and the condition. We just need to fill the TODO part.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      v = False\n      break\n\n  But note: the break is already in the code? Actually, the TODO is inside the if block. So we write:\n\n      v = False\n      break\n\n  This will break the inner for and then the outer break will break the outer for.\n\n  However, what if we have multiple non-zeros? We break at the first non-zero.\n\n  This matches the condition: if we have any non-zero after the first zero in the partial sums, then it's invalid.\n\n### program2.py\nThe problem: We are given an array. We can do two operations:\n  1. Clone an existing array.\n  2. Swap two elements from any two arrays (or same) at any positions.\n\nWe want the minimal number of operations to get at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\nThe code:\n\n  from collections import*\n  for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n      n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n      while m<n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      print(r)\n\nWe note:\n  - The input is read: the test cases. We skip the first two lines? Actually, [2::2] means we take every second line starting from index2 (0-indexed). The first line is t, then the next lines: first line of test case is n, second line is the array. So [2::2] gives the array lines (the second, fourth, ... lines).\n\n  - We split the line and assign to `a`, then set `n` to the length of the array? Actually, `a` is the list of string tokens.\n\n  - We compute `m` = the maximum frequency of any element.\n\n  - We set `r=0` (which will be the number of operations).\n\n  - Then we have a while loop: while m < n.\n\n  The idea: \n      We start with one copy. We can clone and then swap. The goal is to have one copy with all the same element.\n\n      How many operations? \n        Operation1 (clone) counts as one operation.\n        Operation2 (swap) counts as one operation per swap.\n\n      We are free to do any number of swaps.\n\n      The minimal operations: \n        We note that we can collect all occurrences of a particular value in one array by swapping. \n\n      The known solution (from Codeforces problems) for this problem (which is problem B from a recent contest) is:\n\n          Let m = max frequency of an element.\n          Then the answer is computed as follows:\n\n          operations = 0\n          current = m   # current maximum in one array\n          while current < n:\n              # We can clone the array that has the most of the desired element? \n              # Then we can swap the non-desired elements in that array with the desired elements from other arrays.\n\n              # How many new desired elements can we get in one clone operation? \n              # In one clone operation, we get a new copy. Then we can swap to bring at most min(current, n - current) of the desired element from the new copy? Actually, we can swap the non-desired elements in the target array with the desired elements in the new copy? \n\n              # The known solution in C++:\n\n                  int ans = 0;\n                  while (m < n) {\n                      ans++;   // for the clone\n                      int t = min(m, n - m);   // the number of swaps we can do in this step? \n                      ans += t;\n                      m += t;\n                  }\n\n          Why? \n            Step 1: We clone the array that has the most of the desired element (say x). Now we have two arrays with m copies of x in each? Actually, no: the clone is identical. Then we can swap the non-x elements in the first array with the x's in the second array. How many swaps? We can swap up to min(m, n-m) because the first array has (n-m) non-x and the second array has m x's. Then after swapping, the first array becomes: we replaced min(m, n-m) non-x with x. So the first array now has m + min(m, n-m) x's.\n\n          Example: \n            n=6, m=3 (so we have 3 of the most frequent element, say '0').\n            Step1: clone -> operations=1, now we have two arrays: [0,0,0,1,2,3] and [0,0,0,1,2,3].\n            Then we swap: we want to bring more 0's to the first array. We can swap the non-0's in the first array (positions 3,4,5: values 1,2,3) with the 0's in the second array. We can swap up to min(3, 3) = 3 swaps. Then we do 3 swaps -> operations becomes 1+3=4, and the first array becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0] -> done? But wait, we only needed 4 operations? But the example in the note had 6 operations.\n\n          However, the example in the note: \n            Array: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (for 0 and 3). Actually, 0 appears twice, 3 appears twice, so m=2.\n            Then: \n                while m(2)<6:\n                    operations += 1 (clone) -> 1\n                    t = min(2, 6-2)=min(2,4)=2\n                    operations += 2 -> 3\n                    m = 2+2 = 4\n                then while m(4)<6:\n                    operations += 1 -> 4\n                    t = min(4,2)=2\n                    operations += 2 -> 6\n                    m = 4+2=6 -> break.\n\n            So the answer is 6.\n\n          Therefore, the while loop should update:\n\n              r += 1   # for the clone operation\n              t = min(m, n - m)\n              r += t   # for the t swaps\n              m += t   # we increased the number of the desired element in the target array by t\n\n          So the missing code is:\n\n              r += 1\n              t = min(m, n - m)\n              r += t\n              m += t\n\n          But note: the variable `m` is updated and then the while condition is rechecked.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      r += 1\n      t = min(m, n - m)\n      r += t\n      m += t\n\n  However, note: the variable `t` is used in the next iteration? We can use a different variable name? But the code uses `t` for the number of test cases, but in the loop we are inside a test case. The variable `t` in the outer scope is the list of test cases? Actually, no: the for loop is:\n\n      for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n  and then we do:\n\n      n = len(a := a.split())\n\n  So `t` is not used in the inner scope. We can use `t` as a temporary variable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a different variable, but the code is short.\n\n  So we write:\n\n      r += 1\n      d = min(m, n - m)\n      r += d\n      m += d\n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. The original code has:\n\n      while m<n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we write the three lines.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 100000, and the while loop runs at most O(log n) times, so it's efficient.\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: We have a convex polygon with n vertices, and every interior angle is in [90, 180) degrees. We want the area of the set of points Q inside the polygon such that there exists a chord of length at most 1 passing through Q.\n\nThe code is complex and involves a function `binary_find` and `get_area`. \n\nThe main part:\n\n  n = eval(input())\n  for i in range(1, n+1): ...   # read the vertices\n\n  Then if n==4, there is a special case: it checks if the quadrilateral is a rectangle with sides 1 and 1? Actually, it checks the angles and the side lengths.\n\n  Then it computes `res` by iterating over the vertices and calling `get_area` for each consecutive four vertices? Actually, the call: `get_area((i-1+n)%n, i%n, (i+1)%n, (i+2)%n)`.\n\n  The function `get_area` is defined to take four indices: _i, ni, i_, i_2 (which we can call A, B, C, D: the previous, current, next, and next next).\n\n  The idea: the region S is the set of points that are within distance 1/2 from the boundary? Actually, no: the chord passing through Q of length at most 1. But note: the chord must be entirely in the polygon? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: a chord of the polygon passing through Q with length not exceeding 1. So Q must lie on a chord of length <=1.\n\n  The set S is the union of all chords of length <=1. This is known as the set of points that are at most 1/2 from the boundary? Not exactly: because the chord might be in any direction.\n\n  However, the problem is non\u2010trivial. The provided code has a function `binary_find` that does a binary search over angles? \n\n  The TODO in `binary_find` is in the inner while loop:\n\n      while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n          mid_a = (ra + la) / 2.0\n          yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          if yy > mid_y:\n              ra = mid_a\n\n  But note: the condition is:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: then we want to adjust la or ra?\n\n  The binary search is trying to find an angle `mid_a` such that `yy` equals `mid_y`? \n\n  The code in the other branch (for `lb` and `rb`) is:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          rb = mid_b\n\n  So similarly, for the first branch:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          la = mid_a   # because we want a larger angle? \n\n  Why? In the second branch, when yy < mid_y, we set lb=mid_b (so we move the lower bound up). Similarly, here we should set la=mid_a.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the condition in the second branch is:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y: rb = mid_b\n\n  So we do the same for the first branch.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  However, note: the code has two while loops: one for `la, ra` and one for `lb, rb`. The first while loop is for the left side (angle at the first vertex) and the second for the right side.\n\n  The function `binary_find` is called with `la, lb, ra, rb, cy, fy, alpha_1, alpha_2, ab`. The initial `la, lb` are 0.0, and `ra, rb` are `pi - alpha_1` and `pi - alpha_2`.\n\n  The goal is to find angles `la, ra` (for the left) and `lb, rb` (for the right) such that ...? \n\n  The rest of the code in `get_area` then uses these angles to compute an area.\n\n  Since the problem is very complex and the code is provided with a TODO only in that one line, we fill that line.\n\n  But note: the condition in the first while loop: \n\n      if yy < mid_y: then we set la = mid_a? \n      if yy > mid_y: then we set ra = mid_a.\n\n  This is a standard binary search to find the angle that makes `yy` equal to `mid_y`. Since `yy` is increasing or decreasing with `mid_a`? We don't know, but the code in the other branch does the same.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  However, note: the code has two if statements? What if yy==mid_y? Then we break? But the condition is while (ra-la)>eps, so we break eventually.\n\n  But the code does:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: ... \n      if yy > mid_y: ...\n\n  If yy==mid_y, then we break the inner while? Actually, we break when the difference is <=eps.\n\n  So it's safe.\n\n  But note: the code in the other branch for the second angle uses:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y: rb = mid_b\n\n  So we do the same.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the problem has a note that the answer might be printed with a special condition: \n\n      if math.fabs(res-1.02638863065) < 100*eps: \n          print('1.04719792254')\n      if math.fabs(res-1.04692745180) < 100*eps:\n          print('1.04720015894')\n\n  This suggests that the problem might have special cases that require hardcoded answers? But we are not to change that.\n\n  We are only to fill the TODO.\n\n  So the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the code has a comment: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We write: `la = mid_a`\n\n  However, the code has two if conditions? What if both conditions are true? Actually, if yy < mid_y, we set la=mid_a and then the next condition (if yy>mid_y) is false? So we can write:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          la = mid_a\n      elif yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  But the original code for the second branch uses two separate ifs. So we do the same.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          la = mid_a\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  But the provided code for the second branch does exactly that.\n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  and leave the next condition as is.\n\n  But note: the code already has the next condition: `if yy > mid_y: ra = mid_a`. So we only need to fill the first if.\n\n  So the missing line is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  However, the problem says: Output only the missing code. We output the line that goes in the TODO.\n\n  But note: the TODO is in the inner while loop for the first angle.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the code has an indentation level. We must output the code with the same indentation? The problem says: output the missing code. We output the line that should replace the TODO.\n\n  The current code at the TODO is:\n\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace that with:\n\n          la = mid_a\n\n  But note: the next line is `if yy > mid_y: ...` which is already there.\n\n  So the missing code for program3.py is the single line: `la = mid_a`\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the specified JSON.\n\n  We now output the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"v = False\\n        break\",\n        \"program2\": \"r += 1\\n        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += d\\n        m += d\",\n        \"program3\": \"la = mid_a\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program1 code: we have two lines. We must preserve the indentation? The original code has 8 spaces for the inner for loop, and then 12 spaces for the if block? Actually, the code:\n\n          for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at an indentation of 20 spaces? Actually, we are in a for loop, then an if, then the TODO. We write:\n\n          for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    v = False\n                    break\n\n  So the two lines: `v = False` and `break` at the same indentation level.\n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines as:\n\n        \"program1\": \"v = False\\n                    break\"\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n  We output the exact lines that are missing, with the same indentation? But the problem does not specify the indentation. However, the original code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n  Alternatively, we can output without extra spaces? But the problem says: the code must run correctly.\n\n  We note: the original code has:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace that with:\n\n                    v = False\n                    break\n\n  But the break is already at the same level? Actually, the break is the next statement? We break the inner for.\n\n  So we write two lines: \n\n      \"v = False\\n                    break\"\n\n  But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we must break the inner for to avoid TLE.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write without the extra spaces? But the problem does not specify. However, the program must run. The original code uses 4-space indentation. The inner for is at 8 spaces, the if is at 12 spaces, and the TODO is at 16 spaces? Actually, the code:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          b += a[i]\n          if b<0:\n              v = False\n              break\n          elif b==0:\n              for j in range(i+1,n):\n                  if a[j] != 0:\n                      # TODO\n\n  The TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\n  We write:\n\n                      v = False\n                      break\n\n  So two lines, each with 20 spaces? But the problem says: output only the missing code. We output the two lines without the leading spaces? Or with the same leading spaces? \n\n  Since the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the two statements that replace the TODO, we output the two statements as they would appear in the code.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But the original code uses 4 spaces per level. The levels:\n\n      for j ...:   -> level 3 (12 spaces)\n          if ...:   -> level 4 (16 spaces)\n              ...   -> level 5 (20 spaces)\n\n  So we output:\n\n      \"program1\": \"v = False\\n                break\"\n\n  But wait, the break is at the same level as the assignment? Then we need 20 spaces for each? \n\n  Actually, we can write:\n\n      \"program1\": \"                v = False\\n                break\"\n\n  But that would be 16 spaces? \n\n  Alternatively, we can output without the spaces and let the existing indentation take care? The TODO is at a certain indentation, and we replace it with two lines at the same indentation.\n\n  But the problem does not require the exact spaces? The code is:\n\n          for j in range(i+1, n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  Actually, the code in the problem has:\n\n          for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The indentation for the for loop is 12 spaces? and the if is 16 spaces? and the TODO is 20 spaces? \n\n  We write the two lines at 20 spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. We output:\n\n      \"program1\": \"                    v = False\\n                    break\"\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We output only the two lines.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at a specific indentation level. We output the two lines at the same level.\n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact string of spaces. Since the problem is about correctness, and the indentation in Python is significant, we must have the correct indentation.\n\n  How many spaces? The original code:\n\n  Line 1: from sys import stdin\n  Line 2: \n  Line 3: t = int(stdin.readline())\n  Line 4: for h in range(t):\n  Line 5:     n = int(stdin.readline())\n  Line 6:     a = list(map(int,stdin.readline().split(' ')))\n  Line 7:     b = 0\n  Line 8:     v = True\n  Line 9:     for i in range(n):\n  Line 10:         b += a[i]\n  Line 11:         if b<0:\n  Line 12:             v = False\n  Line 13:             break\n  Line 14:         elif b==0:\n  Line 15:             for j in range(i+1,n):\n  Line 16:                 if a[j] != 0:\n  Line 17:                     # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at 20 spaces (because the for loop at line15 is at 12 spaces, the if at line16 is at 16 spaces, and the TODO at line17 is at 20 spaces).\n\n  So we write:\n\n      Line17:                     v = False\n      Line18:                     break\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1 is two lines: each starting with 20 spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output:\n\n      \"program1\": \"                    v = False\\n                    break\"\n\n  However, the problem says: \"NOT as markdown code\", so we output the string with the spaces.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without the spaces and assume the existing indentation? But the TODO is already at the correct indentation. We are replacing the comment with two lines at the same indentation.\n\n  But the problem does not require the spaces? The program1.py code is provided and we are only replacing the TODO. The existing code has the indentation. We output the two lines without the leading spaces? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the code that is inserted in place of the TODO. The TODO is at a specific column. We output the two lines as they would be in the program, including the indentation? \n\n  But the problem does not specify. However, to be safe, we output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO: 20 spaces.\n\n  But 20 spaces is the total? Actually, the code in the problem has:\n\n          for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The for loop: 12 spaces? (because the outer for is 8 spaces, then the elif is 12 spaces, then the inner for is 16 spaces, then the if is 20 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the code in the problem is:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          ... \n          elif b==0:\n              for j in range(i+1,n):\n                  if a[j] != 0:\n                      # TODO\n\n  The indentation:\n\n      for i: 4 spaces\n      elif: 8 spaces\n      for j: 12 spaces\n      if: 16 spaces\n      TODO: 20 spaces\n\n  So we write:\n\n      \"program1\": \"                v = False\\n                break\"\n\n  with 16 spaces? \n\n  But the TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the code in the problem is:\n\n  Line14:         elif b==0:\n  Line15:             for j in range(i+1,n):\n  Line16:                 if a[j] != 0:\n  Line17:                     # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The elif is at 8 spaces (level 2), the for is at 12 spaces (level 3), the if is at 16 spaces (level 4), and the TODO is at 20 spaces (level 5).\n\n  So we write:\n\n      \"program1\": \"                    v = False\\n                    break\"\n\n  with 20 spaces per line.\n\n  But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we must break early.\n\n  We output the JSON with the three completions.\n\n  However, note: the program2.py code: we have three lines. The while loop body. We output:\n\n      r += 1\n      d = min(m, n - m)\n      r += d\n      m += d\n\n  But the variable `d` is not used elsewhere? We can use `t` as in the known solution? But the problem says the variable `t` is used for test cases? Actually, in the scope of the while loop, `t` is not defined. The outer for loop uses `a` and `n` and `m` and `r`. So we can use `t`? \n\n  But the known solution uses `t` for the temporary. So we can write:\n\n      r += 1\n      t_val = min(m, n - m)\n      r += t_val\n      m += t_val\n\n  Or we can use `t`? \n\n  Since the outer scope does not use `t` (the test case variable is not in this function), we can use `t`. But note: the for loop is:\n\n      for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n = len(a := a.split())\n          m = max(Counter(a).values())\n          r = 0\n          while m < n:\n              # TODO\n\n  So `t` is not used. We can use `t` for the temporary.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      r += 1\n      t = min(m, n - m)\n      r += t\n      m += t\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the three lines.\n\n  The program3.py: we output the single line: `la = mid_a`\n\n  But note: the code in the TODO is in a while loop and has an if condition. We output only the line that goes inside the if.\n\n  Therefore, the final JSON is:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"                    v = False\\n                    break\",\n        \"program2\": \"        r += 1\\n        t = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += t\\n        m += t\",\n        \"program3\": \"            la = mid_a\"\n      }\n\n  But wait, the program2 code: the while loop body should be indented? The original code has:\n\n      while m<n):\n          # TODO\n\n  We replace with:\n\n      while m<n):\n          r += 1\n          t = min(m, n - m)\n          r += t\n          m += t\n\n  So the four lines are at the same indentation level as the while. The original code uses 4 spaces per level. The while is at 4 spaces? Actually, the code:\n\n      for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n          while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n          print(r)\n\n  The while is at 4 spaces? Then the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: the TODO is in the while loop. We output the body with 8 spaces per line? \n\n  Actually, the code is written in a compact form. The for loop body has three statements: n=...; m=...; r=0. Then the while loop is at the same level? \n\n  But the while loop has a body? The TODO is the body. So we write the body with 8 spaces? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify. But the code after the while is `print(r)` at 4 spaces, so the body of the while must be indented.\n\n  We output the three lines with 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the body of the while. We output:\n\n        r += 1\n        t = min(m, n - m)\n        r += t\n        m += t\n\n  with each line having 8 spaces? \n\n  But the original code has the while at 4 spaces, so the body should be 8 spaces.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without the spaces and let the existing code's indentation take care? But the while loop currently has no body. We are adding the body.\n\n  We output the four lines with 8 spaces per line? \n\n  But the problem says: the code must run. We output:\n\n      \"program2\": \"        r += 1\\n        t = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += t\\n        m += t\"\n\n  Similarly, program3: the TODO is in a while loop that is in a function. The while loop is at 8 spaces? The if condition is at 12 spaces? The TODO is at 16 spaces? We output the line `la = mid_a` at 16 spaces? \n\n  But the code in program3:\n\n      while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n          mid_a = ra / 2.0 + la / 2.0\n          yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          if yy > mid_y:\n              ra = mid_a\n\n  The while is at 8 spaces, the if is at 12 spaces, and the TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\n  We replace the TODO with `la = mid_a` at 16 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      \"program3\": \"                la = mid_a\"\n\n  with 16 spaces.\n\n  But note: the next line is `if yy > mid_y: ...` which is already there.\n\n  So the final JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"                    v = False\\n                    break\",\n        \"program2\": \"        r += 1\\n        t = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += t\\n        m += t\",\n        \"program3\": \"                la = mid_a\"\n      }\n\n  However, the program2 code: the while loop body is four lines. We output each line with 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\n  But the original code has the while at 4 spaces, so the body should be indented by 4 more spaces -> 8 spaces.\n\n  We output the four lines with 8 spaces each.\n\n  But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 100000, and the while loop runs in O(log n) so it's efficient.\n\n  We hope this is correct.\n\n  Let's write the JSON."
