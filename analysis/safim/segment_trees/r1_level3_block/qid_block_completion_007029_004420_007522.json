For program1.py:\nThe missing part is in the inner loop for the query of type 2. The code uses a randomized approach with multiple iterations (itr=12) to check the condition. The condition is that for a subarray [l, r], the count of every number must be divisible by k. The code uses a BIT (Fenwick tree) to maintain a hash for the array. The hash is built by assigning random 2-bit patterns to each distinct number (P). Then, for each element, we add a value that is either 0, 1, 1<<30, or (1<<30 | 1) to the BIT. For a query, we check the sum in the subarray.",

Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (for 0 and 3, but we take the max which is 2). Step1: \n            clone: 1 op -> now two copies. then we can swap: min(6-2, 2)=min(4,2)=2 swaps -> so we fix 2 more zeros in the first array? Then the first array has 2+2=4 zeros?

Then the first array has 4+2=6 zeros -> done.\n            r += 1+2 = 3 -> total r=3+3=6. This matches the example.

Also, `m` is the max frequency.

This matches the first example. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    r += 1\n    take = min(m, n - m)\n    r += take\n    m += take\n\nBut note: the code is written in a compact form.

However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But we must match the existing indentation. Alternatively, we note that the code is already indented. We are only to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at the same indentation level as the previous if block. So we output:\n\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nwith 8 spaces? But the existing code for the condition above is at 16 and 20. Actually, the code structure:\n\n        for q in query: if q[0] == 1:\n                ...

The TODO is at 20 spaces. So we must write:\n\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nwith 20 spaces. But the problem does not show the exact indentation? We must assume the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The structure:\n\n    for _ in range(itr):\n        ... (4 spaces)\n        for q in query:   (4 spaces)\n            if q[0]==1: (8 spaces)\n            else: (8 spaces)\n                ... (12 spaces) and then:\n                if ans[i]==\"NO\": (16 spaces)\n                ... (16 spaces) and then:\n                if c % k != 0: (16 spaces)\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\" (20 spaces)\n                elif ... (16 spaces)\n                    # TODO (20 spaces) So the missing line is at 20 spaces: \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output that line. Similarly, for program2, the while loop body is at the same indentation as the while. The existing code:\n\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to write the body, which should be indented. So we write:\n\n    r += 1\n    take = min(m, n - m)\n    r += take\n    m += take\n\nEach line indented by 4 spaces? But the while loop is at the same level as the previous line (which is at 0 indentation?

We are to replace that entire line with a colon and then the body? Alternatively, we can keep the while condition and then write the body. I think the intended solution is to write:\n\n    while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut note: the existing while line has no colon. We must add the colon. Therefore, the completion for program2.py is the entire while block:\n\n    while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut the existing while line is: \"",

But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body and the colon? Given the complexity, and since the problem is from a known contest, known solutions for program2.py are:\n\n    for _ in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input()) a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        from collections import Counter\n        c = Counter(a)\n        m = max(c.values())\n        ans = 0\n        while m < n:\n            ans += 1\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            ans += d\n            m += d\n        print(ans) But the given code in the problem is compact. We are to complete the given code. The given code is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nWe must change the while line to have a colon and then write the body. So the completion is:\n\n while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut note: the variable `take` is not used in the known solution. We can use any variable. But the known solution uses `d = min(m, n-m)`. We used `take`. But the problem does not require a specific variable name. Therefore, we output for program2.py:\n\n while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut the existing while line has a comment. We remove the comment. Alternatively, we can output only the body, but then the while line remains invalid. Given the instruction, I think we output the entire block that replaces the while line and the TODO. So for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut note: the next line is \" print(r)\", which is at the same level as the while, so we don't change that. Therefore, the JSON for program2.py is that block. Similarly, for program1.py, we output the line: \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\" (with 20 spaces). For program3.py, we output the two lines: \"                ra = mid_a\" and \"                rb = mid_b\", as a string with a newline. Now, we write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\",\n  \"program2\": \" while m < n:\\n        r += 1\\n        take = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += take\\n        m += take\",\n  \"program3\": \"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 completion must be exactly as the while block. The existing while line is replaced.",

So it takes the array lines (the second line of each test case). Then for each array line, we split and then compute n, m, and then r=0. Then the while loop. We replace the while line and the TODO with the block. This should work. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\",\n  \"program2\": \" while m < n:\\n        r += 1\\n        take = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += take\\n        m += take\",\n  \"program3\": \"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 block has a colon after the while condition. The existing while line did not have a colon. We are adding it. This is necessary for correct syntax. We output the JSON.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe missing part is in the inner loop for the query of type 2. The code uses a randomized approach with multiple iterations (itr=12) to check the condition. The condition is that for a subarray [l, r], the count of every number must be divisible by k. The code uses a BIT (Fenwick tree) to maintain a hash for the array. The hash is built by assigning random 2-bit patterns to each distinct number (P). Then, for each element, we add a value that is either 0, 1, 1<<30, or (1<<30 | 1) to the BIT. For a query, we check the sum in the subarray. The idea is that if the counts of all numbers are multiples of k, then the entire segment sum should be divisible by k for both the lower 30 bits and the higher part (shifted by 30). We already checked the lower part (c % k != 0). Now we need to check the higher part.\n\nThe missing code is:\n    elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the code already has an if condition for the lower 30 bits. The missing part is the condition for the higher part. However, the code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\" in the else branch of the condition for the lower part. Actually, the code structure is:\n\n    if c % k != 0:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n    elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n        # We need to set ans[i] to \"NO\" here as well.\n\nBut the code currently has:\n\n    if c % k != 0:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n    elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must set ans[i] to \"NO\" in the TODO part.\n\nSo the missing line for program1.py is:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the code is inside a loop that iterates over queries and then over multiple iterations (itr=12). We are in the context of one iteration. We are only setting the answer to \"NO\" if in this iteration the condition fails. Since we are doing multiple iterations, if in any iteration the condition fails, we set the answer to \"NO\". The initial answer for a query of type 2 is \"YES\" (unless the length condition fails) and then we set it to \"NO\" if any iteration fails.\n\nTherefore, the missing line is simply:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the code is inside an `else` that is attached to the `if` that checks if the answer is already \"NO\". If it is already \"NO\", we skip. So we only set it to \"NO\" if it was \"YES\" and we found a failure in this iteration.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nHowever, the code is written in a way that the condition for the higher part is already in an `elif`. So we just need to set the answer to \"NO\" in that block.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing line is:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the code is indented. We are inside:\n            elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must write:\n                ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the code is in a loop that runs for multiple iterations. We are breaking early if the answer becomes \"NO\", because we have:\n            if ans[i] == \"NO\":\n                continue\n\nSo we can set it and then the next iterations for this query will be skipped.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the exact code to write is one line: `ans[i] = \"NO\"`\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of operations to get a copy with all equal. The code uses a counter and then a while loop. The idea is to use the frequency of the most common element (m). The operations are: we can clone the array (which counts as one operation) and then we can swap arbitrarily (each swap counts as one operation). However, note that we start with one copy. We can do:\n\nOperation 1: clone (so we have two copies). Then we can swap two elements (so two operations: one clone and one swap) to fix two elements? Actually, the note in the problem says we did 6 operations for the example.\n\nThe approach in the code: \n  n = len(a) (but note: a is the list of tokens, but we are counting frequency by string, so it's okay)\n  m = max frequency of any element.\n\nThe while loop condition: while m < n.\n\nWe are to compute r (which is the number of operations). The example: \n  [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (for 0 and 3). Then we do operations until we have one copy with all equal.\n\nThe minimal operations is known from known solutions: \n  We note that we can use the following strategy:\n    Let m = max frequency.\n    We start with one array. We can do:\n      Operation 1: clone -> now we have two arrays.\n      Then we can swap elements to bring more copies of the desired element to one array.\n\n    How many swaps? Actually, we can fix the array by bringing the same element from other copies. \n    The known solution: \n        r = 0\n        while m < n:\n            if m * 2 <= n:\n                r += 1   # for the clone operation\n                m *= 2\n                r += m   # but wait, this doesn't match the example.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: \n        Operation 1: clone (1 op) -> now we have two copies. Then we can swap to fix one element? \n        Actually, we can fix m elements (the current maximum) by leaving them and then for the rest n-m elements, we need to replace them with the desired element. But we can get the desired element from the other copies. \n\n        How many operations? \n          We start with one array. \n          Step 1: clone -> 1 op, now we have two copies. Then we can swap between the two copies to fix one element? Actually, we can fix min(m, n-m) elements in one swap? \n\n        Actually, the known solution for this problem (from known code on Codeforces) is:\n\n          r = 0\n          while m < n:\n              r += 1   # this is for cloning, so we get one more copy\n              # Then we can swap: we can fix at most m elements (because we have m copies of the desired element in the other array) to the current array? \n              # Actually, we can fix m elements from the other copies to the current array? \n              # Then the number of fixed elements becomes m (the ones we had) + m (the ones we brought) = 2*m? \n              # But note: we are limited by the total number of the desired element available: we have m in the first copy, and m in the second copy? \n              # Actually, after cloning, we have two copies, each with m of the desired element. Then we can swap the non-desired elements in the first array with the desired elements in the second array. How many swaps? We can fix min(m, n - m) elements? \n\n          So the next step: we can fix m elements (by swapping) in the first array? Then the first array becomes having m + m = 2*m? \n\n          But note: we are limited by the number of non-desired elements in the first array: there are n - m non-desired elements. And we can swap each non-desired element in the first array with a desired element in the second array. But the second array has m desired elements. So we can fix min(n - m, m) elements? \n\n          Then after the swap, the first array has m + min(n-m, m) = min(n, 2*m) of the desired element? \n\n          Then we set m = min(n, 2*m) and then we do r += the number of swaps? \n\n          The number of swaps is min(n-m, m) (the number of swaps we did). \n\n          But note: the problem counts each swap as one operation. \n\n          So the operations for one step: \n            clone: 1 op\n            then swap: min(n-m, m) swaps -> so total operations in the step: 1 + min(n-m, m)\n\n          Then we update m = m + min(n-m, m) = min(n, 2*m)\n\n          Then we break when m==n.\n\n        Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (for 0 and 3, but we take the max which is 2).\n          Step1: \n            clone: 1 op -> now two copies.\n            then we can swap: min(6-2, 2)=min(4,2)=2 swaps -> so we fix 2 more zeros in the first array? \n            Then the first array has 2+2=4 zeros? \n            Then m becomes 4, and r += 1+2 = 3 -> total r=3.\n\n          Step2: \n            clone: 1 op -> now three copies.\n            then swap: min(6-4,4)=min(2,4)=2 swaps -> fix 2 more zeros in the first array? \n            Then the first array has 4+2=6 zeros -> done.\n            r += 1+2 = 3 -> total r=3+3=6.\n\n          This matches the example.\n\n        Therefore, the code inside the while loop is:\n\n            r += 1  # for the clone\n            take = min(m, n - m)   # the number of swaps we can do in this step\n            r += take\n            m += take\n\n        But note: the condition is while m < n.\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1\n            take = min(m, n - m)\n            r += take\n            m += take\n\n        However, note that the variable `n` is the length of the array, but in the code we have:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split())\n\n        But note: the array `a` is split by spaces, so the length is the number of elements.\n\n        Also, `m` is the max frequency.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            r += 1\n            take = min(m, n - m)\n            r += take\n            m += take\n\n        But note: the code is in a while loop: while m<n: ... and then print(r)\n\n        Example: if all are already equal, then m==n, so we skip the loop and print 0.\n\n        This matches the first example.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    r += 1\n    take = min(m, n - m)\n    r += take\n    m += take\n\nBut note: the code is written in a compact form. We must be careful with the indentation. The existing code:\n\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to write the body of the while loop. We write:\n\n    r += 1\n    take = min(m, n - m)\n    r += take\n    m += take\n\nBut note: the variable `n` is the length and does not change. The variable `m` is updated.\n\nFor program3.py:\nThe problem is about a convex polygon with right or obtuse interior angles. We are to compute the area of the set of points Q such that there exists a chord of length at most 1 passing through Q.\n\nThe code is complex and has a function `binary_find` and `get_area`. The missing part is in the `binary_find` function, in two while loops. The first while loop (for angle a) has:\n\n        while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n            mid_a = ra / 2.0 + la / 2.0\n            yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n            if yy < mid_y:\n                la = mid_a\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSimilarly, the second while loop (for angle b) has:\n\n        while math.fabs(rb - lb) > eps:\n            mid_b = rb / 2.0 + lb / 2.0\n            yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_b), 2) * math.cos(alpha_2 + mid_b) / math.sin(alpha_2)\n            if yy < mid_y:\n                lb = mid_b\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are doing a binary search. In the first loop, we are searching for an angle `mid_a` in the interval [la, ra] such that the computed `yy` equals `mid_y` (within eps). The condition:\n\n    if yy < mid_y: then we set la = mid_a   -> meaning we need a larger angle? \n\n    if yy > mid_y: then we should set ra = mid_a   -> meaning we need a smaller angle.\n\nSimilarly for the second loop.\n\nSo the missing code for the first TODO is:\n\n                ra = mid_a\n\nand for the second TODO is:\n\n                rb = mid_b\n\nBut note: the code for the first while loop already has:\n\n            if yy < mid_y:\n                la = mid_a\n\nand then:\n\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                # TODO: set ra = mid_a\n\nSimilarly for the second.\n\nTherefore, the missing lines for program3.py are:\n\n                ra = mid_a\n\nand\n\n                rb = mid_b\n\nBut note: the code is in two separate while loops. We must output both.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output the missing code for program3.py as a string. We must put both lines in the string? But note the entire program3.py is given and we are only replacing the two TODOs.\n\nBut the output format is: we return a JSON with the key \"program3\" and the value is the entire completion for program3.py? \n\nNo, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the note: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and the output format is a JSON with the completions for each program.\n\nHowever, the missing parts in program3.py are two separate lines. But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the two lines that complete the two TODOs? But the entire program3.py is long and we are only to output the two lines? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and then gives the entire code with two TODOs. We are to output the two lines? \n\nBut the output for program3.py in the JSON should be the two lines? But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", meaning we might have to output the entire block that is missing? However, in this case, each TODO is a single line.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program3.py, we output:\n\n                ra = mid_a\n\nand\n\n                rb = mid_b\n\nBut how to represent two separate lines? We output the two lines as a string? The entire string for program3.py completion would be:\n\n                ra = mid_a\n                rb = mid_b\n\nBut note: the two lines are in two different while loops. We must output the exact code that replaces the two TODOs. However, the problem does not specify whether we output the entire program or just the missing parts. The instruction: \"Output only the missing code\" meaning the two lines? \n\nBut the example output format is a JSON string for each program. For program3.py, we must output a string that contains:\n\n                ra = mid_a\n\nfor the first TODO and\n\n                rb = mid_b\n\nfor the second TODO. But note: the code is given and we are only replacing the TODOs. We are not changing the rest.\n\nTherefore, the completion for program3.py is the two lines? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and we have two separate lines. We can output:\n\n\"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n\nBut wait, the two lines are in two different places. The first TODO is in the first while loop and the second is in the second while loop. We cannot output them as consecutive lines. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\" and we are to output the missing code for the entire program. However, the problem states: \"You will be given program3.py with missing lines or blocks\". And we are to fill in the missing lines. The missing lines are two separate lines. \n\nThe output format: we return a JSON with the key \"program3\" and the value is a string that contains the two lines? But how? \n\nActually, the problem does not specify how to represent multiple missing lines. But note: the missing parts are independent. We are to output the entire set of missing code for program3.py? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", meaning we might have multiple missing parts? \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the exact structure. But note: the example output format is a string for each program. \n\nWe must output the two lines as they would appear in the program, but only the two lines? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output:\n\n\"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n\nBut that would be incorrect because the two lines are not consecutive. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the entire block of the function? But that is not efficient.\n\nRe-read the problem: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\nIt is ambiguous. But note: the two TODOs are the only missing parts. We are to output the two lines. We can output them as two separate lines in a string? \n\nBut the program3.py code is given and we are only replacing the two TODOs. So the completion for program3.py is the two lines? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the two lines? \n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the two lines as a string with a newline between them? \n\nBut note: the two lines are in two different while loops. They are independent. We can output:\n\n\"                ra = mid_a\"\nand\n\"                rb = mid_b\"\n\nBut the JSON value for \"program3\" must be a string. We can put:\n\n\"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n\nBut that would be two lines in the string. However, when inserted, the first line would replace the first TODO and the second line the second TODO? That doesn't work because they are not consecutive.\n\nAlternatively, the problem expects that we output the entire function? But that is not efficient and the problem says \"only the missing lines\".\n\nI think the intended solution is to output the two lines as they are, and the problem expects that we know they are for the two different TODOs. But the problem does not specify how to handle multiple non-consecutive missing lines.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", meaning we might have multiple blocks. However, the example output format is a single string for each program.\n\nWe must assume that the two lines are the entire missing code for program3.py. So we output:\n\n\"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n\nBut that is not the exact placement. \n\nAlternatively, we note that the two TODOs are the only missing parts. We output the two lines as a string with a newline. When the user replaces the first TODO with the first line and the second TODO with the second line, the program is complete.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the order. However, the first TODO comes first in the code.\n\nTherefore, we output the two lines in the order they appear.\n\nSo the completion for program3.py is:\n\n\"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n\nBut note: the existing code for the first TODO has:\n\n            if yy < mid_y:\n                la = mid_a\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with \"                ra = mid_a\" (with the same indentation).\n\nSimilarly for the second.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is the two lines:\n\n                ra = mid_a\n                rb = mid_b\n\nas a string with a newline.\n\nSummary:\n\nprogram1: \"        ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\"\nprogram2: \"    r += 1\\n    take = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += take\\n    m += take\"\nprogram3: \"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n\nBut note: for program1, the line must be indented. The existing code has:\n\n                if c % k != 0:\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\"\n                elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO line with:\n\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nSo the string for program1 is: \"        ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\" (with 8 spaces at the beginning, but note the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces. The block under the for loop is indented by 4, then the if-elif is indented by 8. So we write 8 spaces? But the existing code in the TODO part is at 20 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n                if c % k != 0:\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\"\n                elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO line is at 20 spaces? Actually, the elif line is at 16 spaces and the TODO comment is at 20. We want to write:\n\n                elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nSo the missing line is exactly: \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\" (with 20 spaces) but note: the existing code has 20 spaces for the inner block. However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But we must match the existing indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we note that the code is already indented. We are only to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at the same indentation level as the previous if block. So we output:\n\n        ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nwith 8 spaces? But the existing code for the condition above is at 16 and 20. Actually, the code structure:\n\n        for q in query:\n            if q[0] == 1:\n                ... (indented by 12 spaces)\n            else:\n                ... (indented by 12 spaces) and then inside the else we have:\n                if ans[i] == \"NO\":\n                    continue\n                ... (then the computation of c)\n                if c % k != 0:\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\"\n                elif (c >> 30) % k != 0:\n                    # TODO\n\nThe if-elif block is at 16 spaces (one more indent). The TODO is at 20 spaces. So we must write:\n\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\"\n\nwith 20 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not show the exact indentation? We must assume the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The structure:\n\n    for _ in range(itr):\n        ... (4 spaces)\n        for q in query:   (4 spaces)\n            if q[0]==1: (8 spaces)\n            else: (8 spaces)\n                ... (12 spaces) and then:\n                if ans[i]==\"NO\": (16 spaces)\n                ... (16 spaces) and then:\n                if c % k != 0: (16 spaces)\n                    ans[i] = \"NO\" (20 spaces)\n                elif ... (16 spaces)\n                    # TODO (20 spaces)\n\nSo the missing line is at 20 spaces: \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output that line.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the while loop body is at the same indentation as the while. The existing code:\n\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to write the body, which should be indented. So we write:\n\n    r += 1\n    take = min(m, n - m)\n    r += take\n    m += take\n\nEach line indented by 4 spaces? But the while loop is at the same level as the previous line (which is at 0 indentation? Actually, the code is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nThe while loop is at the same indentation as the for loop body (which is 4 spaces). So the body of the while loop must be indented by 8 spaces? But the problem does not specify. However, in Python, we must indent. The existing code has the while loop and then the print at the same level as the while.\n\nWe are to write the body of the while loop. So we write:\n\n    r += 1\n    take = min(m, n - m)\n    r += take\n    m += take\n\nwith each line indented by 4 more spaces than the while. Since the while is at 4, the body should be at 8.\n\nBut the problem does not show the exact indentation. We assume 4 spaces per indent.\n\nTherefore, the completion for program2 is:\n\n    r += 1\n    take = min(m, n - m)\n    r += take\n    m += take\n\nwith each line starting with 8 spaces? But note: the while loop is written in the same line as the condition. The body must be on the next lines. So we write:\n\n    while m<n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut the problem says: we are to fill in the TODO. The TODO is at the end of the while line. We are to replace the entire while line? Or just the body? \n\nThe problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is at the end of the while line. We are to write the body of the while loop. So we write the body as a block of 4 lines, each indented by 8 spaces? \n\nBut the existing code has:\n\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe can replace the comment with a colon and then write the body? But that would change the structure. Actually, the while loop in Python requires a colon and then an indented block. The existing code has a colon? \n\nWait, the code is:\n\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThere is no colon. That is a syntax error. \n\nLooking back: the problem says:\n\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThis is invalid because the while loop must have a body. The body cannot be a comment. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the body. So we must output:\n\n    while m<n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut then the next line (print(r)) is at the same level as the while, which is correct.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the while loop. We are not to change the while line? \n\nAlternatively, we can keep the while line and then write the body. But the existing while line is:\n\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe can change it to:\n\n    while m<n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nSo the entire block for the while loop is replaced. But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the entire block? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Complete the code in python\". The TODO is in the while line. We are to replace the entire while loop? Or just the body? \n\nThe problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The while loop body is missing. We output the body? \n\nBut the existing while line is correct? Actually, the colon is missing. \n\nWait, the problem's code for program2.py is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nThis is invalid Python because the while loop has no body. We must add a body. The body should be indented. \n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n while m<n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut note: the existing while line has a comment. We remove the comment and add a colon and then the body. \n\nAlternatively, we can break the while line and then write the body. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the while loop. We are not to change the while line. \n\nBut the while line is missing the colon and the body. We must add the colon and the body. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we output the entire block for the while loop, including the colon and the body. \n\nBut the problem says: \"You will be given program2.py with missing lines or blocks\". The given program2.py has a while loop with a TODO comment. We are to replace that entire line with a colon and then the body? \n\nAlternatively, we can keep the while condition and then write the body. \n\nI think the intended solution is to write:\n\n    while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut note: the existing while line has no colon. We must add the colon. \n\nTherefore, the completion for program2.py is the entire while block:\n\n    while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut the existing while line is: \" while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\"\n\nWe replace that line with: \" while m < n:\" and then the next four lines as the body.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body and the colon? \n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem is from a known contest, known solutions for program2.py are:\n\n    for _ in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        from collections import Counter\n        c = Counter(a)\n        m = max(c.values())\n        ans = 0\n        while m < n:\n            ans += 1\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            ans += d\n            m += d\n        print(ans)\n\nBut the given code in the problem is compact. We are to complete the given code.\n\nThe given code is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nWe must change the while line to have a colon and then write the body. So the completion is:\n\n while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut note: the variable `take` is not used in the known solution. We can use any variable. But the known solution uses `d = min(m, n-m)`. We used `take`.\n\nBut the problem does not require a specific variable name.\n\nTherefore, we output for program2.py:\n\n while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut the existing while line has a comment. We remove the comment. \n\nAlternatively, we can output only the body, but then the while line remains invalid. \n\nGiven the instruction, I think we output the entire block that replaces the while line and the TODO. \n\nSo for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n while m < n:\n        r += 1\n        take = min(m, n - m)\n        r += take\n        m += take\n\nBut note: the next line is \" print(r)\", which is at the same level as the while, so we don't change that.\n\nTherefore, the JSON for program2.py is that block.\n\nSimilarly, for program1.py, we output the line: \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\" (with 20 spaces).\n\nFor program3.py, we output the two lines: \"                ra = mid_a\" and \"                rb = mid_b\", as a string with a newline.\n\nNow, we write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\",\n  \"program2\": \" while m < n:\\n        r += 1\\n        take = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += take\\n        m += take\",\n  \"program3\": \"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 completion must be exactly as the while block. The existing while line is replaced. The body is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the for loop which is at 4). But the for loop body has multiple statements on one line. We are replacing the while line and adding the body.\n\nAlternatively, to be safe, we output for program2 only the body of the while loop, but then we must also add the colon. But the problem's while line has no colon. \n\nGiven the time, I will output the entire block for program2 as above.\n\nLet me double-check the example for program2: \n  Input: \n    t test cases\n    for each test case: \n        n\n        list of n integers\n\n  The code: \n      for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:   # this skips the first two lines? \n          n = len(a.split())\n          m = max frequency\n          r = 0\n          while ... \n\n  The first two lines of the entire input are t and then the first test case's n. Then the next line is the array for the first test case. Then the next two lines are for the next test case? \n\n  The slicing [2::2] means: start from index 2 (the third line) and take every second line. So it takes the array lines (the second line of each test case). \n\n  Then for each array line, we split and then compute n, m, and then r=0.\n\n  Then the while loop.\n\n  We replace the while line and the TODO with the block.\n\n  This should work.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                    ans[i] = \\\"NO\\\"\",\n  \"program2\": \" while m < n:\\n        r += 1\\n        take = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += take\\n        m += take\",\n  \"program3\": \"                ra = mid_a\\n                rb = mid_b\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 block has a colon after the while condition. The existing while line did not have a colon. We are adding it.\n\nThis is necessary for correct syntax.\n\nWe output the JSON."
