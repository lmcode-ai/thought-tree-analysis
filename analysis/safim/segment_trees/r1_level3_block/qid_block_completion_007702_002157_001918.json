                "text": "However, the current code only has the loop for the top-left diagonal (handled by the first inner loop) and then two other loops for the top-right and bottom-left are partially written. The missing part is in the second inner loop (with variable w) for the bottom-right diagonal. We note that the bishop attacks in four directions: \n   top-left: (k-v, l-v) for v in [1, min(k,l)] -> already done (with v=0 included in the first loop? Actually the first loop includes v=0 to min(k,l) so it covers the current cell and top-left)\n   bottom-right: (k+w, l+w) for w in [1, ...] -> this is the one missing (the TODO part)\n   top-right: (k-i1, l+i1) for i1 in [1, min(k, m-l-1)] -> done\n   bottom-left: (k+j1, l-j1) for j1 in [1, min(n-k-1, l)] -> done\n\n The current code for the bottom-right direction is missing. We are to add the bottom-right diagonal. The loop for w is from 1 to min(n-k-1, m-l-1) (inclusive). For each step w, we should add the value at (k+w, l+w). So the missing code for program1.py is:\n        for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n            s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n But note: the current code for the top-left diagonal includes the current cell (v=0) and then goes up to min(k,l). The bottom-right loop starts at w=1 (so one step down-right) and goes as far as possible. However, note that the current code for the top-left diagonal already includes the current cell (k,l). The bottom-right loop should not include the current cell again? Actually, the current cell is already added in the top-left loop (v=0). So we only need to add the cells strictly in the bottom-right direction. Therefore, we add: s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n But wait: the problem says the bishop is placed at (k,l) and that cell is attacked. The current code for the top-left loop already adds the current cell (v=0: b[k][l]). Then the bottom-right loop adds the cells (k+1, l+1), (k+2, l+2), etc. So the missing code for program1.py is:\n            for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n However, note that the variable names: the matrix is stored in `b` and we are using indices [k+w][l+w]. But wait: the problem says the bishop attacks in all four diagonal directions. The current code for the top-left and bottom-right are the two main diagonals. The other two loops (top-right and bottom-left) are the anti-diagonals.",

So we just need to complete the bottom-right. However, the current code for the top-left loop is written as:\n        for v in range(min(l,k)+1):\n            s += b[k-v][l-v]\n\n This includes v=0 (the current cell) and then v=1,2,... up to min(k,l). Similarly, the bottom-right loop should start at w=1 (since the current cell is already counted) and go to min(n-k-1, m-l-1). But note: the condition in the bottom-right loop: min(n-k-1, m-l-1) -> because we can go at most n-k-1 steps down and m-l-1 steps right. So the missing code for program1.py is:\n            for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n However, note that the problem states that the total sum of n*m over test cases is at most 40000. But the current code has four nested loops: t, then n, then m, then the maximum diagonal length (which is at most 200). The worst-case total operations would be t * n * m * (max_diagonal_length). Since max_diagonal_length is about 200, and the total n*m over test cases is 40000, then the total operations would be 40000 * 200 = 8e6, which might be acceptable in Pyton? But note the problem says the total n*m is 40000, meaning the sum of the sizes of all test cases. However, the inner loops are over each cell and then the diagonal. The total number of cells is 40000, and for each cell we do 4 * (length of diagonal). The maximum diagonal length is at most 200, so total operations 40000 * 4 * 200 = 32e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in C++ but in Python it might be borderline. However, note that the problem constraints say t<=1000, but the total n*m<=40000, so the worst-case t could be 1000 but then each test case has n*m=40 on average. So worst-case diagonal length might be small. But we are to complete the code as given.",

Actually, 8e6 operations in worst-case for the entire test cases (since 40000 * 200 = 8e6) and 8e6 operations in Python might run in a few seconds. But note: the current code structure is already given. We are only to fill the missing part.

Yes. But wait: the current code uses `min` and we are using it correctly. So the completion for program1.py is the above two lines. But note: the code already has the for-loop for w, we just need to fill the body. The body is: s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n So we write:\n            for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n However, note that the code already has the for-loop header, so we only need to write the body?

Correction: the example says: \"you can choose the substrings 11010 and 101\". How do you get \"101\"? The entire string is \"11010\", so the substring \"101\" must be non contiguous? Actually, the substring must be contiguous. The substring \"101\" in \"11010\": \n                It could be: \n                    starting at index0: \"110\" -> not \"101\"\n                    index1: \"101\" -> that's the substring from index1 to index3: '1','0','1'. But the example says the first substring is 11010 (the entire string) and the second is 101 (from index1 to index3).

Steps:\n                Let T = the entire string without leading zeros. Let L = len(T) We want to set as many bits as possible. The maximum we can set is L bits? and we want them all to be 1.\n\n                We can try: \n                    candidate1: T and T -> OR = T, which is not all ones. candidate2: T and a substring that covers a zero in T and has a 1 in the corresponding position. Known solution: \n                    We can try every possible starting point for the second substring? But n up to 10^6 -> too expensive. There is a known solution for this problem: \n                Step 1: remove leading zeros. Step 2: let L = len(s). The answer will be a string of L ones if we can achieve OR = (2^L-1), else we try L-1 ones? How to check if we can achieve OR = (2^L-1)? We need to cover every zero in T with a 1 in S. But note: we can choose S arbitrarily. We can try: Let Z = the set of positions in T that are zeros and that we need to cover. But note: we can cover multiple zeros with one S?",

Therefore, we can achieve 31.\n\n                    Example2: T = \"1000\", L=4.\n                        bit0: j=0: '1' in the first 4 characters -> yes. bit1: j=1: '1' in the first 3 characters -> only the first character is '1' -> within the first 3, so yes.\n                        bit2: j=2: '1' in the first 2 characters -> yes. bit3: j=3: '1' in the first 1 characters -> yes.

We need to set bit0, bit1, bit2? bit0: we can choose S=\"1\" anywhere -> but to set bit0 we need a substring ending with '1'. -> we can take S=\"1\" at the beginning: then OR = 8|1 = 9 (1001 in binary) -> not 15. How to set bit1? we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character. -> substring of length>=2 that has the second last character '1'. -> the only '1' is at the beginning. We can take S=\"100\" -> then the number is 4, and the second last character is the first '1'? In the substring \"100\", the positions: \n                                    position0: '1' -> most significant -> bit2 in the number (since length=3: bit2, bit1, bit0)\n                                    position1: '0'\n                                    position2: '0' So the number is 4 -> binary 100. When OR with T (8, which is 1000 in 4 bits) and S (4, which is 0100 in 4 bits) -> 1100 (12) -> not 15. How to set bit0 and bit1 and bit2? We need a substring that has:\n                                    bit0: last character '1' -> not possible because the last three are '0's. bit1: second last '1' -> not possible.\n                                    bit2: third last '1' -> only the first character, but then the substring must be at least 3 characters and have the first character as the third last? We can take S=\"100\" (positions0..2): \n                                            bit0: last character is '0' -> not set. bit1: second last is '0' -> not set. bit2: third last is '1' -> set. So we set bit2. Then OR = 8|4 = 12 (1100) -> bits: 8 and 4. Therefore, we cannot achieve 15. What is the condition then? For bit j, we need a '1' that has at least j characters to its right in the string. In \"1000\", for bit0: we need a '1' with at least 0 characters to the right -> any '1'. for bit1: we need a '1' with at least 1 character to its right -> the '1' at the beginning has 3 characters to the right -> satisfies.\n                        for bit2: we need a '1' with at least 2 characters to its right -> the '1' has 3, so satisfies.\n                        for bit3: we need a '1' with at least 3 characters to its right -> the '1' has 3, so satisfies.

However, note: the substring can be anywhere. We can take the substring \"1\" at the beginning. The number for that substring is 1, which is 0001 in 4 bits. Then OR with T (1000) -> 1001, which sets bit0. For bit1: we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character. We can take a substring of length 2 starting at the beginning: \"10\", which is 2 (0010 in 4 bits). This has a 1 at the bit1 position? In the number 2, the bits: \n                                bit0: 0\n                                bit1: 1 (because 2 = 2^1) So it sets bit1. For bit2: we need a substring that has a 1 at the third last character. We can take a substring of length 3: \"100\", which is 4 (0100 in 4 bits) -> sets bit2. For bit3: T has bit3 set.

We can only choose two. How to achieve 15 with two substrings? We can choose T and one other substring that covers the missing bits? The missing bits in T are bit0, bit1, bit2. We need one substring that has bit0, bit1, bit2 set. Is there a substring that has all three? We need a substring that has:\n                                bit0: last character '1'\n                                bit1: second last '1'\n                                bit2: third last '1'\n                            -> a substring \"111\" would work, but we don't have that.

However, note the constraint: in tests from 21 to 40, n=10^6. We cannot do O(n^2). There is a known efficient solution: \n                        We can use a greedy tri-based approach? Alternatively, we note the following: \n                        The OR of T and any substring is at least T.\n                        To set a bit j (>=0) that is not set in T, we need a substring that has a 1 in bit j.\n\n                        The maximum number we can get is at most (2^(L)-1) (all ones in L bits). We can try to build the maximum possible number bit by bit from high to low. We start with the current number = T.\n                        Then we consider the bits from high to low (from bit L-1 down to 0) and try to set the bit if it is not already set. For a bit j (0<=j<L) that is not set in the current number, we can set it if there is a substring that has a 1 in bit j and that is such that the entire number represented by that substring, when ORed with the current number, might set bit j and possibly more bits below. But note: setting a bit j might be done by a substring that has a 1 in bit j and zeros in the bits above j?",

We start at the first '1'. Let current = 0. Let best = 0. For i in range(first1, len(T)):\n                            current = (current << 1) | (1 if T[i]=='1' else 0)\n                            candidate_OR = T_value | current\n                            if candidate_OR > best:\n                                best = candidate_OR\n\n                        But this only considers contiguous substrings starting at the first '1'. Example: T = \"11010\", T_value = 26. i0: '1' -> current=1, OR=26|1=27 (11011) -> best=27. i1: '1' -> current = (1<<1)|1 = 3, OR=26|3=31 -> best=31.\n                            i2: '0' -> current = (3<<1)|0 = 6, OR=26|6=30 -> best=31. i3: '1' -> current = (6<<1)|1 = 13, OR=26|13=31 -> best=31. i4: '0' -> current = (13<<1)|0 = 26, OR=26|26=26. So we found 31. Example2: T=\"1000\", T_value=8. i0: '1' -> current=1, OR=8|1=9. i1: '0' -> current= (1<<1)|0 = 2, OR=8|2=10.\n                            i2: '0' -> current=4, OR=12.\n                            i3: '0' -> current=8, OR=8.\n                            best=12. But is 12 the maximum? Consider substring \"10\" ( which is at i0 to i1): we got 10. substring \"100\" (i0 to i2): 12.\n                            substring \"1000\": 8.\n                            substring \"0\" (any) -> not starting with '1'? we skip. substring at i1: '0' -> skip.\n                            substring at i1 to i2: \"00\" -> skip. substring at i1 to i3: \"000\" -> skip.\n                            substring at i2: \"0\" -> skip.\n                            substring at i2 to i3: \"00\" -> skip. substring at i3: \"0\" -> skip. So we only consider contiguous substring from the first '1'. Why is that sufficient? Because any substring that starts with a '0' will have a number that is<= a substring that starts with a '1' (because leading zeros don't change the number) and might be covered by a shorter substring starting with '1'. But consider: \n                            T = \"1010\", \n                            T_value = 10.\n                            contiguous from first '1': \n                                \"1\" -> 1, OR=10|1=11 (1011)\n                                \"10\" -> 2, OR=10|2=10|2=10 (1010 in bits) -> 1010 OR 0010 = 1010 -> 10. \"101\" -> 5, OR=10|5=15 (1111)\n                                \"1010\" -> 10, OR=10|10=10.\n                            best=15. Is there a substring not starting at the first '1' that might give more? Consider starting at index2: \"10\" -> 2, OR=10. Consider starting at index0: we already did. Consider starting at index1: \"01\" -> 1, OR=10|1=11.\n                                Consider starting at index1: \"010\" -> 2, OR=10.\n                                Consider starting at index1: \"0101\" -> 5, OR=15. So we missed \"0101\" -> which is 5, and 10|5=15. How to include \"0101\"? We can try: start at the first '1' and then also start at the next '1'? Note: the substring \"0101\" starts with '0'. But we can skip the leading zeros?",

We want the maximum OR. We can do: \n                            Let T_value is an integer, but L can be 10^6 -> the number has 10^6 bits, which is too big for Python int in the sense of bit-level operations? Python int is arbitrary precision, but the loop over 10^6 substrings and for each doing an OR of two numbers of 10^6 bits would be O(n^2) in the number of bits -> 10^12.

This suggests that we only need to iterate 100 times. What is the solution in the editorial? We can try: Let T = s without leading zeros. If T is empty, then output 0. Let L = len(T)\n                            We then consider at most (L) additional substrings, but the for loop is 100, and L can be 10^6, so we cannot iterate over L.\n\n                    Another known solution: \n                        The maximum OR is either:\n                            candidate0 = T\n                            candidate1 = T OR ( the number from the substring that is the best we can get) And the best substring is the one that starts at the first occurrence of a 1 and extends for L+L-1? After checking known solutions for a similar problem (C. Min-Max Array Transformation), we find that the solution for this problem (C. AND OR) is:\n\n                        n = int(input().strip())\n                        s = input().strip()\n                        if '0' not in s:\n                            print(s)\n                        else:\n                            # Find the first '0'\n                            # Then the answer is '1' * (n - (len(s) - s.find('0'))) + '0' * (len(s) - s.find('0')) # But this does not match.

Another known solution from a submission in C++ for the problem \"Elementary!\". We note the following: \n                        The maximum OR is a string of x ones, where x = (n - (index of the first zero)) + ( the number of ones before the first zero) \n\n                    But Example1: first zero at index2, then x = (5-2) + (number of ones before index2=2) = 3+2=5 -> '1'*5 = \"11111\" -> matches.\n                    Example2: s=\"1110010\", first zero at index3, then x = (7-3) + 3 = 4+3=7 -> '1'*7 = \"1111111\", but the example output is \"1111110\" -> not matching.\n\n                    Example2 output is \"1111110\", which is 7 ones? no, it's 6 ones and a zero. The example says: \" you can choose the substrings 1110010 and 11100 -> f(s1)=114, f(s2)=28, OR=114|28=126, which in binary is 1111110. Therefore, the maximum OR is 126, which is \"1111110\". How to compute x in example2: \n                        first zero at index3, then x = (7-3) [ which is 4] + 3 [ones before index3] = 7, but we need 6 ones and a zero. Another: \n                        x = the number of ones in the string + 1? \n                        Example1: ones=3, then 4 -> not 5.",

For example, substring \"111001\" ( indices0..5) -> '1' at the last. Then OR with the entire string: \n                                entire: 1110010\n                                substring: 111001 -> number 57, binary 0111001 (7 bits: 00111001 in 8 bits, but we use 7 bits) -> \n                                1110010\n                                0111001\n                                OR: 1111011 -> which is 123, binary 1111011.

The output is the binary representation of the maximum OR, without leading zeros. Given the complexity of the efficient solution, and the fact that the for loop is only 100 iterations, we can try: The solution in the for loop: \n                            res = 0\n                            for i in range(100):\n                                res |= s  # but s is the entire string as an integer, and we are to choose two substrings, not the entire string twice. This sets res = s, and then we output bin(s)[2:], which is the entire string. Example1: s = int(\"11010\",2) = 26, bin(26) = '11010', but the expected is '11111'.

Example1: we want \"11111\", so we should not set any bit to '0' in the output. Therefore, the condition: \n                        if there is at least one '0' in s, then the output is a string of n '1's with the last '0' in the output at the position of the last '0' in s? \n                        but example1: the last '0' in s is at index4, then we set ans[4] to '0' -> \"11110\", but expected \"11111\". How about: \n                        the output is a string of (n - number of trailing zeros) '1's and then the last ( number of trailing zeros) as they are in s? \n\n                    Example1: s=\"11010\", has no trailing zero at the end? last char is '0', so number of trailing zeros=1. then output = '1' * (5-1) + s[4] = \"1111\" + \"0\" = \"11110\" -> not \"11111\".

Finally, we found a solution in a submission for the problem \"https://codeforces.com/contest/1763/problem/C\" ( which is the third problem) in C++: \n\n                        #include <iostream>\n                        #include <string>\n                        using namespace std;\n\n                        int main() {\n                            int n;\n                            string s;\n                            cin >> n >> s;\n                            int first_zero = n;\n                            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                                if (s[i] == '0') {\n                                    first_zero = i;\n                                    break;\n                                }\n                            }\n                            if (first_zero == n) {\n                                cout << s << '\\n';\n                            } else {\n                                string ans = s.substr(first_zero);\n                                for (int i = 0; i < first_zero; i++) {\n                                    string to = s.substr(i, n - first_zero);\n                                    string or = \"\";\n                                    for (int j = 0; j < ans.length(); j++) {\n                                        if (ans[j] == '1' || to[j] == '1') {\n                                            or += '1';\n                                        } else {\n                                            or += '0';\n                                        }\n                                    }\n                                    if (or > ans) {\n                                        ans = or;\n                                    }\n                                }\n                                cout << ans << '\\n';\n                            }\n                        } This is O(n^2) and might work for n<=1000, but not for n=10^6. Given the for loop in program2.py is only 100 iterations, and the note that the tests from 4 to 40 are generated randomly with n=5, then 1000, then 10^6, but the loop is only 100, we can try: \n\n                        res = s\n                        for i in range(100):\n                            res = res | (s >> i)   # or something else. But s is the integer of the entire string. We found a known solution in Python for a similar problem: \n                        n = int(input())\n                        s = input().strip()",

In the OR, leading zeros in the substring are not harmful because they are zeros.

So we put: \n                        res = max(res, s | (s >> i)) Let me test with example1: \n                        s = 26 ( binary: 11010, 5 bits)\n                        i=0: res = max(0, 26|26)=26\n                        i=1: res = max(26, 26|13) = 26|13 = 31\n                        i=2: res = max(31, 26|6) = 31 ( because 26|6 = 30)\n                        i=3: 26>>3 = 3, 26|3=27 -> still 31. i>=4: 0, so 26. res=31.\n\n                    Example2: \n                        s=114 ( binary: 1110010, 7 bits)\n                        i=0: 114\n                        i=1: 114|57 = 123\n                        i=2: 114|28 = 126\n                        i=3: 114>>3 = 14, 114|14=126\n                        i=4: 114>>4 = 7, 114|7=127\n                        i=5: 114>>5 = 3, 114|3=115\n                        i=6: 114>>6 = 1, 114|1=115\n                        i>=7:0 -> 114.\n\n                        res=127. But expected is 126 for example2. Why at i=4: 114>>4 = 7, and 114|7=127? \n                        114: 1110010\n                        7:   0000111\n                        OR:  1110111 = 119? \n                        Let me calculate: \n                            114: 64+32+16+0+0+2+0 = 64+32+16+2 = 114. 7: 4+2+1=7. 114 | 7 = 64+32+16+4+2+1 = 64+32+16=112, plus 7=119. What is 127? 64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 127. How do we get 127? 114 | 13? Let me do 114>>4 = 114//16 = 7.125 -> floor 7. 114 | 7 = 119. Therefore, the maximum in the loop for example2 is 126 at i=2. Why at i=4 we got 119, not 127. So the maximum is 126. Therefore, the code is: \n                        for i in range(100):\n                            res = max(res, s | (s >> i)) But note: the shifting might be by more than the number of bits, then s>>i is 0, and s|0 = s.\n\n                    This will work for i up to the number of bits, and the number of bits is up to 10^6, but we only do 100 iterations. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \n                        res = max(res, s | (s >> i)) But note: the initial res is 0, and in the first iteration (i=0): \n                        0 | (s|s) = s, then we take max(0, s) = s.\n                    Then i=1: max(s, s| (s>>1)), etc. So it's correct. Let me test example2 manually with the code: \n                        n = input()  # \"7\"\n                        s = int(input(),2) # int(\"1110010\",2) = 114\n                        res = 0\n                        for i in range(100):\n                            res = max(res, s | (s >> i)) then ans = bin(res)[2:] = bin(126)[2:] = '1111110'\n\n                    Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \" res = max(res, s | (s >> i))",

The intended solution in the for loop is: \n                        for i in range(n):   # but n may be 10^6, and the loop is only 100 iterations, so we use range(100)\n                            res = max(res, res | (s >> i)) Example1: \n                        i=0: res = 26 | (26>>0) = 26\n                        i=1: res = 26 | (26>>1) = 26 | 13 = 31\n                        then for i>=2: 31 | (26>>i) = 31 | 6 = 31, then 31 | 1 = 31, then 31 | 0 = 31. res=31.\n\n                    Example2: \n                        s=114. i=0: res = 114 | (114>>0) = 114.\n                        i=1: res = 114 | (114>>1) = 114 | 57 = 123. i=2: res = 123 | (114>>2) = 123 | 28 = 127. i=3: 127 | (114>>3) = 127 | 14 = 127.\n                        ... \n                        then output '1111111' -> not '1111110'. How to get 126? \n                        114 | 28 = 126.\n                        28 = 114 >> 2? 114>>2 = 28, so in i=2, we did 123 | 28 = 127, not 114|28=126. Therefore, we should try: \n                        for i in range(100):\n                            res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\n\n                    Example2: \n                        i=0: s| (s>>0) = 114\n                        i=1: s| (s>>1) = 114|57=123\n                        i=2: s| (s>>2) = 114|28=126 -> this is bigger than 123, so res=126. i=3: s| (s>>3) = 114|14=126\n                        ... \n                        then res=126. Example1: \n                        i=0: 26\n                        i=1: 26|13=31\n                        i>=2: 26>>>= floor division, so 26>>2=6, 26|6=30; 26>>3=3, 26|3=27; ... -> the maximum is 31. Therefore, the TODO is: \n                        res = max(res, s | (s >> i)) But note: s is the integer of the entire string. However, the shifting might create numbers that are not substrings?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The current code has a nested loop that for each cell (k,l) it tries to compute the sum of the bishop's attacks in four diagonal directions.\n However, the current code only has the loop for the top-left diagonal (handled by the first inner loop) and then two other loops for the top-right and bottom-left are partially written.\n The missing part is in the second inner loop (with variable w) for the bottom-right diagonal.\n\n We note that the bishop attacks in four directions: \n   top-left: (k-v, l-v) for v in [1, min(k,l)] -> already done (with v=0 included in the first loop? Actually the first loop includes v=0 to min(k,l) so it covers the current cell and top-left)\n   bottom-right: (k+w, l+w) for w in [1, ...] -> this is the one missing (the TODO part)\n   top-right: (k-i1, l+i1) for i1 in [1, min(k, m-l-1)] -> done\n   bottom-left: (k+j1, l-j1) for j1 in [1, min(n-k-1, l)] -> done\n\n The current code for the bottom-right direction is missing. We are to add the bottom-right diagonal.\n\n The loop for w is from 1 to min(n-k-1, m-l-1) (inclusive). For each step w, we should add the value at (k+w, l+w).\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is:\n        for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n            s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n But note: the current code for the top-left diagonal includes the current cell (v=0) and then goes up to min(k,l). The bottom-right loop starts at w=1 (so one step down-right) and goes as far as possible.\n\n However, note that the current code for the top-left diagonal already includes the current cell (k,l). The bottom-right loop should not include the current cell again? Actually, the current cell is already added in the top-left loop (v=0). So we only need to add the cells strictly in the bottom-right direction.\n\n Therefore, we add: s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n But wait: the problem says the bishop is placed at (k,l) and that cell is attacked. The current code for the top-left loop already adds the current cell (v=0: b[k][l]). Then the bottom-right loop adds the cells (k+1, l+1), (k+2, l+2), etc.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is:\n            for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n However, note that the variable names: the matrix is stored in `b` and we are using indices [k+w][l+w].\n\n But wait: the problem says the bishop attacks in all four diagonal directions. The current code for the top-left and bottom-right are the two main diagonals. The other two loops (top-right and bottom-left) are the anti-diagonals.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the one line inside the bottom-right loop.\n\n But note: the current code for the top-right and bottom-left are also done. So we just need to complete the bottom-right.\n\n However, the current code for the top-left loop is written as:\n        for v in range(min(l,k)+1):\n            s += b[k-v][l-v]\n\n This includes v=0 (the current cell) and then v=1,2,... up to min(k,l). Similarly, the bottom-right loop should start at w=1 (since the current cell is already counted) and go to min(n-k-1, m-l-1). \n\n But note: the condition in the bottom-right loop: min(n-k-1, m-l-1) -> because we can go at most n-k-1 steps down and m-l-1 steps right.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is:\n            for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n However, note that the problem states that the total sum of n*m over test cases is at most 40000. But the current code has four nested loops: t, then n, then m, then the maximum diagonal length (which is at most 200). The worst-case total operations would be t * n * m * (max_diagonal_length). Since max_diagonal_length is about 200, and the total n*m over test cases is 40000, then the total operations would be 40000 * 200 = 8e6, which might be acceptable in Pyton? But note the problem says the total n*m is 40000, meaning the sum of the sizes of all test cases. However, the inner loops are over each cell and then the diagonal. The total number of cells is 40000, and for each cell we do 4 * (length of diagonal). The maximum diagonal length is at most 200, so total operations 40000 * 4 * 200 = 32e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in C++ but in Python it might be borderline. However, note that the problem constraints say t<=1000, but the total n*m<=40000, so the worst-case t could be 1000 but then each test case has n*m=40 on average. So worst-case diagonal length might be small. But we are to complete the code as given.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the diagonals to avoid O(n) per cell? But the problem says the total n*m is 40000, so worst-case 40000 cells and each diagonal might be up to 200, so 8e6 operations which is acceptable in Pyton? Actually, 8e6 operations in worst-case for the entire test cases (since 40000 * 200 = 8e6) and 8e6 operations in Python might run in a few seconds.\n\n But note: the current code structure is already given. We are only to fill the missing part.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n            for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n However, note that the variable `min` is the built-in function? Yes.\n\n But wait: the current code uses `min` and we are using it correctly.\n\n So the completion for program1.py is the above two lines.\n\n But note: the code already has the for-loop for w, we just need to fill the body. The body is: s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n So we write:\n            for w in range(1, min(n-k-1, m-l-1)+1):\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n However, note that the code already has the for-loop header, so we only need to write the body? Actually, the TODO is inside the loop. The current code has:\n\n            for w in range(1,min(n-k-1,m-l-1)+1):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n So we replace the TODO line with: s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n But note: the code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", so we remove that and put the line.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the missing block is:\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". Since the for-loop header is already there, we only need to output the line that goes in the body.\n\n However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we output the line that completes the body.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we output the line that should replace the TODO.\n\n But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format of a JSON string.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the completion string is: \"                s += b[k+w][l+w]\"\n\n However, note that the indentation must be exactly 16 spaces? Actually, the existing loop has 12 spaces at the beginning and then the comment is indented 4 more? Let me count:\n\n The code structure:\n\n    for k in range(n):\n        for l in range(m):\n            ... (some loops)\n            for w in range(1,min(n-k-1,m-l-1)+1):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n The current indentation for the TODO line is 16 spaces (the outer for loops are 4 spaces each: 4 for the first for, 8 for the second, 12 for the third, then 16 for the inner for and then 20 for the body). But the TODO is a comment. We are to replace that one line with the code.\n\n So we write the same indentation: 16 spaces? Actually, the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? But we must match the existing code.\n\n Alternatively, we can output the exact line that would be in the body. Since the existing line is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n We replace that with:\n\n                s += b[k+w][l+w]\n\n So the string for program1.py is: \"                s += b[k+w][l+w]\"\n\n But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". Since it's only one line, we output that one line.\n\n However, if we need to output multiple lines, we would output the entire block. But here it's one line.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n The problem: We are given a string of 0s and 1s. We have to choose two substrings and compute the bitwise OR of the two numbers (each substring interpreted as a binary number) and maximize the OR value. Then output the binary representation without leading zeros.\n\n The current code:\n\n    n = input()\n    s = int(input(),2)\n\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(100):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    ans = bin(res)[2:]\n    print(ans)\n\n The challenge: n can be up to 10^6 in some tests. However, the problem states that the tests are generated randomly with each bit independent and probability 1/2. Also, the problem has 40 tests and the first 3 are examples.\n\n How to solve?\n We note that the maximum OR value we can get is by having a substring that gives the maximum possible number (the entire string as a binary number) and then OR with any other substring? But note: we can choose two substrings arbitrarily. The OR of two numbers is at least the maximum of the two and at most the OR of the entire set of bits that appear in either.\n\n However, the maximum OR we can get is when we set every bit that appears in any substring? But note: the entire string is a substring. So the maximum OR we can get is the OR of the entire string? Not exactly: because we can choose two substrings that together cover all the 1's? Actually, the OR of two numbers A and B is A | B. The entire string is the maximum number? But if we take the entire string as one substring, then we can take any other substring and the OR will be the entire string? So the maximum OR is the entire string? \n\n However, consider: the entire string might have leading zeros? Actually, the entire string might not be the maximum number. For example, if the string is \"010\", then the entire string is 2, but if we take the substring \"10\" (which is 2) and then the substring \"1\" (which is 1), then OR(2,1)=3, which is 11 in binary. But wait: the entire string is 2, and if we take the entire string and then the substring \"1\", we get 2|1=3. So the maximum OR is the OR of the entire string and the maximum number that can be formed by a substring? Actually, the entire string is the maximum number? Not necessarily: because the entire string might have a leading zero? Actually, the entire string as a binary number: if the string starts with zeros, then the entire string is a small number. But we can choose a substring that skips the leading zeros.\n\n Therefore, the maximum OR we can get is the OR of the two largest numbers we can form? But note: the OR of two numbers is maximized when we set as many high bits as possible. The key is: we want the highest bit to be set. The highest bit that appears in the string? Then we want the next highest, etc.\n\n However, note: the OR of two numbers can set a bit if it is set in either. So the maximum OR we can get is the OR of all the bits that appear in any substring? But that is the entire set of 1's in the string? Actually, the entire set of 1's in the string is fixed: if a 1 appears anywhere, then we can choose a substring that includes that 1. Therefore, the OR of any two substrings will have a 1 in a position if there is a 1 in that position in the entire string? Actually, no: because if a 1 is in the string, we can always choose a substring that includes that 1. Therefore, the OR of the two substrings will have a 1 in every position that has a 1 in the entire string. So the maximum OR is the entire string? But wait: what about positions that are 0 in the entire string? They will be 0 in the OR? \n\n However, consider: the OR of two numbers cannot set a bit that is 0 in both. So the maximum OR is the entire string? But that is not true: because the entire string as a binary number might not have all the 1's that are present in the string? Actually, the entire string is the entire set of bits? \n\n But note: the entire string is a contiguous substring. So if we take the entire string as one substring, then the OR of the entire string and any other substring will be the entire string? Because the entire string already has all the 1's that appear in the string? Actually, no: the entire string has the 1's that appear in the entire string, but there might be a 1 that appears in a non contiguous part? The entire string has all the 1's that are in the string. So the entire string has the maximum set of 1's? \n\n Therefore, the maximum OR we can get is the entire string? Then why the example: \n   Example 1: n=5, s=\"11010\" -> the entire string is 26 (11010). But the example says the answer is 31 (11111). How? \n   They chose two substrings: \"11010\" and \"101\". \n   26 in binary: 11010\n   5 in binary: 00101\n   OR: 11111 -> 31.\n\n How did they get 31? Because the substring \"101\" is taken from the last three characters? But the entire string is \"11010\", so the substring \"101\" is the last three: starting at index2: '1', then index3: '0', then index4: '1'? Actually, the substring \"101\" is not contiguous in the entire string? Actually, it is: the last three: indices 2,3,4: '1','0','1'. \n\n But note: the entire string is \"11010\", so the substring \"101\" is present. However, the entire string has the 1's at positions 0,1,4 (if we index from 0). The substring \"101\" has 1's at positions 0 and 2 (within the substring) but when converted to a number, the substring \"101\" is 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 5. The OR of 26 and 5 is 31.\n\n How is 31 the maximum? Because 31 is 2^5-1, which is the maximum number with 5 bits? But the entire string is 26, which is less than 31. So the maximum OR is not the entire string? \n\n Insight: we can choose two substrings that together cover all the bits? Actually, the OR of two numbers can set a bit if it is set in either. Therefore, the maximum OR is the OR of all the 1's that appear in the entire string? But that is the same as the entire string? Not exactly: because the entire string has a fixed length. The OR of two numbers can have bits set beyond the length of the entire string? No, because the substrings are contiguous and the numbers are formed from the bits in the string.\n\n However, note: the two substrings can be taken arbitrarily. The OR operation is done on the numbers. The number of bits in the OR result can be at most the maximum length of the two substrings? Actually, the OR result can have a bit set at a position if that bit is set in either substring. The positions are the binary digits: the leftmost bit of the substring is the most significant.\n\n How to achieve the maximum? \n   We want the highest bit to be set. The highest bit that appears in the string? Then we want the next highest, etc. But note: we can set a bit even if it is not in the entire string? No.\n\n However, the example: the entire string \"11010\" does not have the bit 2^4 set? Actually, it does: the entire string is 5 bits: the leftmost is 2^4. The entire string has the 2^4 bit set? Yes: 16. But the OR result 31 has bits set at positions 0,1,2,3,4 (5 bits). The entire string only has bits at positions 0,1,4? How do we get the bits at positions 2 and 3? \n\n We get the bit at position 2 from the substring \"101\": the substring \"101\" is 3 bits: the leftmost is 2^2. The substring \"101\" has the bit at position 2 set? Yes: 1 at the beginning. And the bit at position 0 set? Yes. The entire string \"11010\" has the bit at position 4 (16), position 3 (8) is 0, position 2 (4) is 0, position 1 (2) is 1, and position 0 (1) is 0. Then the OR: \n   position 4: 1 (from the entire string)\n   position 3: 0 (from entire) OR 0 (from substring) -> 0? \n   position 2: 0 (entire) OR 1 (substring) -> 1\n   position 1: 1 (entire) OR 0 (substring) -> 1\n   position 0: 0 (entire) OR 1 (substring) -> 1\n\n That gives 10111? But 10111 is 16+4+2+1=23? \n\n What's wrong? The entire string is 11010 -> 16+8+0+2+0 = 26? \n   Actually: \n     11010: \n        bit4: 1 -> 16\n        bit3: 1 -> 8 -> total 24\n        bit2: 0\n        bit1: 1 -> 2 -> total 26\n        bit0: 0\n\n The substring \"101\" is 101: \n        bit2: 1 -> 4\n        bit1: 0\n        bit0: 1 -> 1 -> total 5\n\n Now, OR of 26 and 5:\n\n   26: 11010\n    5: 00101\n   OR: 11111 -> 31.\n\n How? The OR is done bit by bit? The entire string is 5 bits? But the entire string is 5 bits and the substring is 3 bits. When we OR two numbers, we align the least significant bits? So:\n\n   26:  1 1 0 1 0\n    5:      1 0 1   -> we pad with zeros at the front? So 5 becomes 00101? Then OR:\n\n        11010\n        00101\n        ------\n        11111\n\n Therefore, the OR result has 5 bits.\n\n How to achieve the maximum OR? \n   We want to set as many high bits as possible. The highest bit that can be set is the leftmost 1 in the entire string? Then we want to set the next bit, and so on.\n\n Observation: \n   The maximum OR value must have a length (in bits) equal to the length of the entire string? Why? Because if we take a substring that starts at the first 1 and goes to the end, that number has the maximum length. Then we can try to set the missing bits? \n\n Alternate approach: \n   Step 1: remove leading zeros? Because the entire string might have leading zeros. The maximum OR will not have leading zeros. So we can start from the first '1'.\n\n   Step 2: Let T be the substring from the first '1' to the end. Then the maximum OR must be at least the number represented by T.\n\n   Step 3: How to set more bits? We can choose a second substring that starts with a 1 and then has as many bits as possible? But note: we can set a bit at a position i (from the left) only if there is a 1 in that position in the entire string? But wait: we can set a bit at a position that is not in T? Actually, T is the entire string without the leading zeros, so it has all the 1's? \n\n   However, the example: T = \"11010\" (if the string was \"011010\" then we remove the leading zero and take \"11010\"). Then we can set the missing bits? The missing bits in T are the zeros that we can cover by a substring that has a 1 in that position? \n\n   But note: the OR of T and any other substring S: \n        The bits that are set in T are fixed. The bits that are set in S can be anywhere. However, the positions in the OR result are aligned by the least significant bit? Actually, the OR is done on the numbers, so the alignment is by the binary digit positions: the most significant bit of T is the highest bit in the result. The most significant bit of S might be lower? Then the OR result will have the same most significant bit as T? \n\n   How to set a bit that is in a higher position than the most significant bit of S? It cannot. Therefore, the OR result cannot have a bit set beyond the length of T? \n\n   Then how did the example get 31? The length of T is 5, and 31 is 5 bits. So the OR result has the same length as T? \n\n   The problem: we want to set as many bits as possible in the OR result. The maximum OR result is a number with all bits set from the most significant bit (of T) down to the least significant bit? That is, (2^(len(T)) - 1). \n\n   How to achieve that? \n        We need to set every bit in the range [0, len(T)-1]. \n        The bit at the most significant position (position len(T)-1) is set by T (because T starts with 1). \n        For the other bits: we need to set them by either T or S.\n\n        How to set the bit at position i? We need a substring that has a 1 at the corresponding position? But note: the OR is done by aligning the least significant bits. The substring S is interpreted as a binary number, and when we OR with T, the bit positions are aligned by the least significant bit. Therefore, the bit at position i in the OR result corresponds to the (len(T)-1-i)-th character in T? and similarly for S? \n\n        Actually, the OR operation in numbers: \n            T = t0 t1 ... t_{L-1} (each ti is a bit, t0 is the most significant) -> value = t0 * 2^{L-1} + ... + t_{L-1}*2^0.\n            S = s0 s1 ... s_{k-1} (s0 is the most significant) -> value = s0 * 2^{k-1} + ... + s_{k-1}*2^0.\n\n        When we OR T and S, we align the least significant bits. So the j-th bit of T (counting from the right, j=0 for the least significant) is ORed with the j-th bit of S (from the right). \n\n        Therefore, to set the j-th bit from the right (which is the (L-1-j)-th character from the left in T) we need either T has a 1 at that bit or S has a 1 at that bit.\n\n        We want to set every bit from 0 to L-1? Then we need for every j in [0, L-1] at least one of T or S has a 1 at the j-th bit (from the right).\n\n        How to choose S? \n            We can choose any contiguous substring. We are allowed to choose S arbitrarily. \n\n        Therefore, the condition: for every j in [0, L-1], there must be a 1 in the entire string at a position that corresponds to the j-th bit from the right? But note: the entire string has the substring T, which covers the entire string without the leading zeros. The positions in T are fixed. The positions in the entire string beyond T? Actually, T is the entire string without the leading zeros, so the entire string has T and then nothing? \n\n        Actually, the entire string might have more characters after T? No: because we defined T as from the first 1 to the end. So the entire string is T? \n\n        Then how did the example work? The entire string is \"11010\", and T is \"11010\". Then we need to set the bits that are 0 in T? The bits that are 0 in T: \n            The bits in T (from left to right): \n                position0 (most significant): 1 -> bit (L-1) = 4: set.\n                position1: 1 -> bit 3: set.\n                position2: 0 -> bit 2: not set.\n                position3: 1 -> bit 1: set? Actually, wait: \n                    T: 1 1 0 1 0 -> \n                    bit4: 1\n                    bit3: 1\n                    bit2: 0\n                    bit1: 1\n                    bit0: 0\n\n            We need to set bit2 and bit0? \n\n        How to set bit2? We need a substring that has a 1 at the bit2 position? But note: the OR aligns the least significant bits. So if we take a substring that ends at the last character (so that its least significant bit is aligned with the least significant bit of T) and that has a 1 at the position that corresponds to bit2? \n\n        The substring S must be of length at least 3? Because bit2 is the third bit from the right. \n\n        In the example, they took S = \"101\", which is the last three characters. \n            T: 11010 -> in binary: 16+8+2 = 26 -> bits: 4,3,1.\n            S: 101 -> 4+1 = 5 -> bits: 2,0? \n            But wait: the OR aligns the least significant bits. So:\n                T: ...11010 (we can write with 5 bits: 11010)\n                S: ...00101 (we write with 5 bits: 00101)\n                OR: 11111.\n\n        How did the 1 in S at the most significant bit of S (which is the first character of S) become the bit2 in the 5-bit representation? \n            The substring S is taken from the original string: \n                original: 11010\n                S: from index2 to index4: \"101\"\n            When we interpret \"101\" as a binary number, the first '1' is the most significant bit of S, which is 2^2 = 4. Then the next is 0 (2^1) and then 1 (2^0). So the bits in S: \n                bit2: 1, bit1:0, bit0:1.\n\n            When we align the least significant bits of T and S, the bit0 of S (which is 1) aligns with bit0 of T (which is 0) -> sets bit0.\n            the bit1 of S (0) aligns with bit1 of T (1) -> leaves it as 1.\n            the bit2 of S (1) aligns with bit2 of T (0) -> sets bit2.\n            the bits beyond the length of S (bits3 and 4) are taken from T? Actually, in the OR operation, the numbers are extended to the maximum length? So T has bits3 and 4 set? \n\n        Therefore, we set bits0 and 2.\n\n        How to find such an S? \n            We want to set the zeros in T? But note: we might set multiple zeros with one S? \n\n        The maximum OR is (2^L - 1) if we can set all the zeros in T? \n\n        How to check if we can set all the zeros? \n            We need to cover every zero in T? Actually, no: we only need to cover the zeros that are in the positions that we care about? But note: the OR result has L bits. We want to set every bit in the L bits. \n\n        Therefore, the condition: for every bit position j (0<=j<L) that is 0 in T, we need a substring S that has a 1 at the same bit position (relative to the end) as j? \n\n        How to cover a zero at position i in T (i from 0 to L-1, where i=0 is the most significant)? \n            The bit position in the OR is the distance from the end: the last character of T is the least significant. The zero at position i in T is at distance (L-1-i) from the end? \n            Actually, the j-th bit from the right in T is the character at index (L-1-j) in T? \n\n            We want to set the j-th bit from the right: we need a substring that has a 1 at a position that, when aligned by the least significant bit, falls in the j-th bit from the right. \n\n            How? We can take a substring that ends at the last character of the entire string (so that its least significant bit is aligned with T's least significant bit) and that has a 1 at the j-th position from the end? \n\n            Therefore, we can only set a bit j if there is a 1 in the entire string at a position that is exactly j positions from the end? \n\n        But note: we can also choose a substring that does not end at the last character? Then the alignment would be different? \n\n        Example: \n            T: 11010 (L=5)\n            We want to set bit2 (which is the third from the left, or the third from the right? In the OR result, the bits are labeled from right to left: bit0 (LSB) to bit4 (MSB). We want to set bit2 (which is the middle bit). \n\n            How can we set bit2? \n                We need a substring that has a 1 at the position that will align with bit2 of the OR result. \n\n            If we take a substring that ends at the last character, then the substring must have a 1 at the position that is 2 positions from the end? That is, the substring must have a 1 at the third last character? \n\n            In the entire string, the last three characters are \"010\". The substring that ends at the last character and has a 1 at the third last character? But the third last character is '1'? Actually, the entire string: \n                positions: 0: '1', 1: '1', 2: '0', 3: '1', 4: '0'\n            The last three: positions 2,3,4: \"010\". There is no 1 at the third last? \n\n            But wait, the example used S=\"101\", which is positions 2,3,4: \"101\"? Actually, the example string is \"11010\", so:\n                position0: '1'\n                position1: '1'\n                position2: '0'\n                position3: '1'\n                position4: '0'\n            Then the substring from 2 to 4 is \"010\", not \"101\". \n\n            Correction: the example says: \"you can choose the substrings 11010 and 101\". How do you get \"101\"? \n                The entire string is \"11010\", so the substring \"101\" must be non contiguous? \n\n            Actually, the substring must be contiguous. The substring \"101\" in \"11010\": \n                It could be: \n                    starting at index0: \"110\" -> not \"101\"\n                    index1: \"101\" -> that's the substring from index1 to index3: '1','0','1'. \n                But the example says the first substring is 11010 (the entire string) and the second is 101 (from index1 to index3). \n\n            Then the OR: \n                T: 11010 -> 26\n                S: 101 -> 5\n                OR: 31.\n\n            Now, how does the 1 in S at the most significant bit (which is the first character of S, at index1 in the entire string) align? \n                T: 5 bits: 11010\n                S: 3 bits: 101 -> but when we OR, we align the LSB? So we need to represent S as a 5-bit number? \n                We can write S as 00101? But that would be if we take the substring and then pad with zeros at the front? \n\n            How is the number 101 (which is 5) represented in 5 bits? 00101.\n\n            Then OR: \n                11010\n                00101\n                -----\n                11111\n\n            How did we get 00101 from the substring \"101\" (which is at indices1 to 3)? \n                The substring \"101\" is taken from the entire string: \n                    entire: index0:1, index1:1, index2:0, index3:1, index4:0.\n                    substring from index1 to index3: s[1:4] -> '1','0','1'. \n                When we convert the substring \"101\" to a number: \n                    the first character is the most significant: 1 -> 2^2, then 0, then 1 -> 2^0: so 4+1=5.\n\n            In the OR with T (which is 26, represented as 11010 in 5 bits), we represent S as 00101? \n\n            Therefore, the OR is done after representing both numbers with the same number of bits (the maximum of the two lengths? but the problem doesn't specify, but in bitwise OR in Python, the numbers are in binary and we align by the LSB). \n\n        So the key: \n            The OR result will have a bit set at a position if either T or S has a 1 at that position (where the positions are the powers of 2). The positions are absolute: the LSB is position0, then position1, etc.\n\n        How to set a particular position j? \n            We can choose a substring that has a 1 at a position that, when the substring is interpreted as a binary number, contributes to the j-th bit? \n\n            The j-th bit in the OR result is set if there is a substring (either T or the chosen S) that has a 1 at a character that is exactly j positions from the end of that substring? \n\n            But wait: T is fixed: it has a 1 at a position that is j positions from the end of T? \n            For S: we can choose any substring. We can choose a substring that ends at the last character of the entire string? Then the j-th bit from the end of S would be the character at (last - j) in the entire string? \n\n            However, we are not forced to have S end at the last character. We can choose any substring. \n\n        Alternate insight from known solutions to similar problems: \n            The maximum OR is achieved by taking the entire string as the first substring, and then the second substring is the one that has a 1 in the first zero in T? \n\n            Steps:\n                Let T = the entire string without leading zeros.\n                Let L = len(T)\n                We want to set as many bits as possible. The maximum we can set is L bits? and we want them all to be 1.\n\n                We can try: \n                    candidate1: T and T -> OR = T, which is not all ones.\n                    candidate2: T and a substring that covers a zero in T and has a 1 in the corresponding position.\n\n                Known solution: \n                    We can try every possible starting point for the second substring? But n up to 10^6 -> too expensive.\n\n            There is a known solution for this problem: \n                Step 1: remove leading zeros.\n                Step 2: let L = len(s). The answer will be a string of L ones if we can achieve OR = (2^L-1), else we try L-1 ones? \n\n                How to check if we can achieve OR = (2^L-1)? \n                    We need to cover every zero in T with a 1 in S. But note: we can choose S arbitrarily. \n\n                We can try: \n                    Let Z = the set of positions in T that are zeros and that we need to cover. \n                    But note: we can cover multiple zeros with one S? \n\n                Insight: \n                    The best candidate for S is a substring that starts at the first 1 and has length L? or L-1? or ... \n\n                Known solution from Codeforces (since this is a known problem): \n                    Problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1760/problem/G\n                    But wait, the problem code is not given.\n\n                Actually, the problem is known as: \"Maximum OR\" in a string.\n\n                Common solution: \n                    The maximum OR is achieved by taking the entire string T and then one additional substring: the one that starts at the first occurrence of a 1 and then extends to cover the next zero and then until the end? \n\n                Specifically: \n                    We consider the first zero in T (from the left). Then we take a substring that starts at the beginning of T and goes to the end? That is T itself. \n                    Or we take a substring that starts one character to the right of the beginning of T and goes to the end? \n\n                Example: T = \"11010\": \n                    The first zero is at index2 (0-indexed in T). \n                    Then we can take a substring that starts at index1: \"1010\", but then we want to cover the zero at index2? \n                    But note: if we take S = \"1010\", then the number is 10, and OR with T (26) is 26|10 = 30 (11110) -> not 31.\n\n                Another: take S = \"101\" (which is from index1 to index3) -> 5, then OR=31.\n\n                How to find \"101\"? \n                    We note that the OR result has a 1 in the bit2 position. In T, the bit2 position is the third character from the left? But in the OR alignment, the bit2 position is the third bit from the right? \n\n                We can try: \n                    We want to set the bit2 (which is the third from the right) in the OR result. In the entire string, we look for a 1 that is followed by at least two characters? so that it can be the most significant bit of a 3-bit number and then the last character of that substring is the last character of T? \n\n                Specifically: \n                    We want a substring that ends at the last character of T? Then the least significant bit is fixed at the last character. Then the bit2 position in the OR result is the character that is two positions to the left of the last character? \n\n                    In T: the last character is at index4. The character two positions to the left is index2. But T[2] is '0'. We need a substring that has a 1 at the position that is two positions from the end? \n\n                    But we are not forced to have the substring end at the last character. \n\n                However, if the substring does not end at the last character, then the alignment in the OR will be different: the least significant bit of S will not be aligned with the least significant bit of T. \n\n                But note: the OR is done on the numbers, not on the string alignment. The number represented by a substring does not depend on the alignment with T. However, when we OR two numbers, we align the LSB. \n\n                Therefore, to set the j-th bit in the OR result, we need a substring that has a 1 in its own (j)-th bit? \n\n                The (j)-th bit in the number represented by a substring S is set if the substring has a 1 at a position that is exactly j positions from the end of S. \n\n                So to set the j-th bit in the OR result, we can choose any substring that has a 1 at a position that is j positions from the end of that substring. \n\n                Therefore, to set bit0, we need a substring that has a 1 at the last character.\n                to set bit1, we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character.\n                to set bit2, we need a substring that has a 1 at the third last character.\n\n                In the example: \n                    bit0: we need a substring ending with '1'. -> there is one: the substring \"101\" ends with '1'. \n                    bit1: we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character. -> the substring \"101\" has at the second last character: '0' -> not set. \n                         but T has at bit1: '1' (at index3) -> so bit1 is set by T.\n                    bit2: we need a substring that has a 1 at the third last character. -> the substring \"101\" has at the first character (which is the third last? because the substring has length 3: positions0,1,2 within the substring) -> the first character is the third last? \n                         within the substring: \n                             position0: '1' -> this is the most significant, which is 2^2, so it is the bit2 of the number -> sets bit2.\n                    bit3: set by T.\n                    bit4: set by T.\n\n                Therefore, we set bit0 and bit2 by S=\"101\", and the others by T.\n\n                How to find such an S that sets as many of the missing bits as possible? \n                    We want to set the bits that are not set by T. \n\n                Let missing = [j for j in range(L) if the bit j is not set by T]\n\n                For a bit j in missing, we need a substring that has a 1 at a position that is j positions from the end of that substring. \n\n                Can one substring S set multiple missing bits? \n                    Yes, if in the substring S, there is a 1 at position (len(S)-1 - (j1)) and also at (len(S)-1 - (j2))? \n                    But note: the positions within the substring: \n                        Let the substring be from index i to index i+len(S)-1.\n                        The bit j in the number is the character at index (i + len(S)-1 - j) in the entire string.\n\n                    Therefore, if we choose a substring of length L0, then it can set any bit j for which j < L0 and for which the character at position (start + L0 - 1 - j) is '1'.\n\n                We want to set as many high bits as possible? But note: the OR result is a number, and the high bits are more significant. However, the OR result is not necessarily contiguous in the set of bits. But the maximum OR result is the maximum number, which is achieved by having the largest possible set of bits, and within that set, the bits are from 0 to some maximum. \n\n                But note: the OR result might have gaps? However, the maximum number with a given number of bits is the number with all bits set: (2^(k)-1) for some k. \n\n                Therefore, the maximum OR result is the number with the most significant bit being the first 1 in the string, and then as many consecutive ones as possible? \n\n                Known solution from a similar problem (from the example): \n                    We can do:\n                        Let T = the entire string without leading zeros.\n                        Let L = len(T)\n                        We then try to extend the ones as much as possible. \n\n                        We look for the first zero in T. Then we take the next occurrence of a one after that zero, and then take as many as possible? \n\n                    Specifically: \n                        Let i0 = the first position in T that is '0'. \n                        Then we take the substring from the beginning to the end: T, and then we take the substring from the first '1' after the first zero to the end? \n\n                    Example: T = \"11010\": \n                        first zero at index2. Then the next ones: at index3 and index4? \n                        We take the substring from index1 to the end: \"1010\", but then we convert to number: 10, and OR=26|10=30 (11110) -> not 31.\n\n                    Another: take the substring from index1 to index3: \"101\" -> 5, OR=31.\n\n                How to find the best second substring? \n                    We can try: \n                        For the second substring, we consider every substring that starts at a position i (>= the start of T) and has length at least 1. But that is O(L^2) -> L up to 10^6 -> 10^12 operations.\n\n                There is a linear solution: \n                    We note: the maximum OR result will have length L or L+1? \n                    But if we set a bit beyond L, that would require a substring that is longer than L? which is not possible. So the length is L.\n\n                    Then the maximum OR result is either:\n                        2^L - 1   (if we can set all bits)\n                        or something less.\n\n                    How to achieve 2^L-1? \n                        We need to set every bit from 0 to L-1.\n\n                    For bit0: we need a substring that has a 1 at the last character of the entire string? \n                    For bit1: we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character? \n                    ...\n\n                    Therefore, for each bit j in [0, L-1]:\n                        if T has a 1 at the position (L-1-j) (which is the j-th bit from the right) then we are good.\n                        else, we need the entire string to have a 1 at some substring's position that is j from the end of that substring.\n\n                    But note: we can use one substring S to cover multiple zeros. \n\n                    However, observe: \n                        The condition for bit j is independent of the others? \n\n                    Therefore, the maximum OR result is 2^L-1 if and only if for every j in [0, L-1] there is a 1 in the entire string at a position that is exactly j positions from the end of some substring? \n\n                    But note: the entire string is T, and we can choose any substring. For bit j, we can choose a substring that has a 1 at a position that is j positions from its own end. \n\n                    How to know if there is a substring that has a 1 at a position that is j positions from the end? \n                        This is equivalent to: the entire string has a 1 at a position i such that there is a substring ending at i+j that has length at least j+1 and that has a 1 at position i. \n\n                    But simpler: \n                        For bit0: we need a substring ending with '1'. -> then the last character must be '1' or there must be a substring ending somewhere with '1'. Actually, we can choose any substring. So we need at least one '1' in the entire string? -> which we have because we removed leading zeros.\n\n                        For bit0: we need a substring that has the last character '1'. -> then the last character of the entire string is '1' or there is a substring that ends before the last character and has last character '1'. -> but we can choose any substring. So we can choose a substring that is just \"1\" at any position. Therefore, bit0 can be set if there is at least one '1' in the string.\n\n                        For bit1: we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character. -> we can choose a substring of length>=2 that has the second last character '1'. -> then there must be an occurrence of '1' followed by any character. \n\n                        For bit2: we need a substring of length>=3 that has the third last character '1'. \n\n                    Therefore, the condition for bit j: there must be an occurrence of '1' in the string such that there are at least j characters to its right within the substring. But note: we can choose the substring arbitrarily. So we can choose a substring that starts anywhere and ends anywhere. \n\n                    For bit j: we need an occurrence of '1' that has at least j characters to its right in the entire string? because we can then take a substring that starts at that '1' and goes j characters to the right. \n\n                    However, we might not need to start at that '1': we can take a substring that includes that '1' and has at least j+1 characters and has that '1' at the position that is j from the end. \n\n                    Therefore, the condition for bit j: there must be an occurrence of '1' at a position i such that the entire string has at least j characters to the right of i. \n\n                    In other words, there is a '1' in the first (L - j) characters of T? \n\n                    Example: T = \"11010\", L=5.\n                        bit0: j=0: we need a '1' in the first 5-0=5 characters -> yes.\n                        bit1: j=1: we need a '1' in the first 4 characters -> index0,1,3 are '1' -> yes.\n                        bit2: j=2: we need a '1' in the first 3 characters -> index0,1 are '1' -> yes.\n                        bit3: j=3: we need a '1' in the first 2 characters -> index0,1 -> yes.\n                        bit4: j=4: we need a '1' in the first 1 characters -> index0 is '1' -> yes.\n\n                    Therefore, we can achieve 31.\n\n                    Example2: T = \"1000\", L=4.\n                        bit0: j=0: '1' in the first 4 characters -> yes.\n                        bit1: j=1: '1' in the first 3 characters -> only the first character is '1' -> within the first 3, so yes.\n                        bit2: j=2: '1' in the first 2 characters -> yes.\n                        bit3: j=3: '1' in the first 1 characters -> yes.\n                        Therefore, we can achieve 2^4-1 = 15? \n                        But let's see: \n                            T = 1000 -> 8.\n                            What S can we choose to set the last three bits? \n                            We need to set bit0, bit1, bit2? \n                            bit0: we can choose S=\"1\" anywhere -> but to set bit0 we need a substring ending with '1'. -> we can take S=\"1\" at the beginning: then OR = 8|1 = 9 (1001 in binary) -> not 15.\n                            How to set bit1? we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character. -> substring of length>=2 that has the second last character '1'. -> the only '1' is at the beginning. \n                                We can take S=\"100\" -> then the number is 4, and the second last character is the first '1'? \n                                In the substring \"100\", the positions: \n                                    position0: '1' -> most significant -> bit2 in the number (since length=3: bit2, bit1, bit0)\n                                    position1: '0'\n                                    position2: '0'\n                                So the number is 4 -> binary 100.\n                                When OR with T (8, which is 1000 in 4 bits) and S (4, which is 0100 in 4 bits) -> 1100 (12) -> not 15.\n                            How to set bit0 and bit1 and bit2? \n                                We need a substring that has:\n                                    bit0: last character '1' -> not possible because the last three are '0's.\n                                    bit1: second last '1' -> not possible.\n                                    bit2: third last '1' -> only the first character, but then the substring must be at least 3 characters and have the first character as the third last? \n                                        We can take S=\"100\" (positions0..2): \n                                            bit0: last character is '0' -> not set.\n                                            bit1: second last is '0' -> not set.\n                                            bit2: third last is '1' -> set.\n                                        So we set bit2.\n                                Then OR = 8|4 = 12 (1100) -> bits: 8 and 4.\n\n                            Therefore, we cannot achieve 15.\n\n                    What is the condition then? \n                        For bit j, we need a '1' that has at least j characters to its right in the string. In \"1000\", for bit0: we need a '1' with at least 0 characters to the right -> any '1'. \n                        for bit1: we need a '1' with at least 1 character to its right -> the '1' at the beginning has 3 characters to the right -> satisfies.\n                        for bit2: we need a '1' with at least 2 characters to its right -> the '1' has 3, so satisfies.\n                        for bit3: we need a '1' with at least 3 characters to its right -> the '1' has 3, so satisfies.\n\n                    But we cannot achieve 15.\n\n                    The issue: for bit0, we need a substring that has its last character '1'. In \"1000\", there is no substring ending with '1' (except the substring \"1\" at the beginning, but that doesn't end at the last character). \n\n                    However, note: the substring can be anywhere. We can take the substring \"1\" at the beginning. \n                        The number for that substring is 1, which is 0001 in 4 bits. \n                        Then OR with T (1000) -> 1001, which sets bit0. \n\n                    For bit1: we need a substring that has a 1 at the second last character. \n                        We can take a substring of length 2 starting at the beginning: \"10\", which is 2 (0010 in 4 bits). \n                        This has a 1 at the bit1 position? \n                            In the number 2, the bits: \n                                bit0: 0\n                                bit1: 1 (because 2 = 2^1)\n                        So it sets bit1.\n\n                    For bit2: we need a substring that has a 1 at the third last character. \n                        We can take a substring of length 3: \"100\", which is 4 (0100 in 4 bits) -> sets bit2.\n\n                    For bit3: T has bit3 set.\n\n                    Therefore, we can achieve 1111 = 15.\n\n                    How to do the OR: \n                        T = 1000 (8)\n                        S1 = \"1\" -> 1\n                        S2 = \"10\" -> 2\n                        S3 = \"100\" -> 4\n                        But the problem: we can only choose two substrings. \n\n                    We can only choose two. \n\n                    How to achieve 15 with two substrings? \n                        We can choose T and one other substring that covers the missing bits? \n                        The missing bits in T are bit0, bit1, bit2. \n                        We need one substring that has bit0, bit1, bit2 set. \n                        Is there a substring that has all three? \n                            We need a substring that has:\n                                bit0: last character '1'\n                                bit1: second last '1'\n                                bit2: third last '1'\n                            -> a substring \"111\" would work, but we don't have that.\n\n                        Alternatively, we can take T and one substring that sets as many of the missing bits as possible. \n                        The substring \"100\" sets bit2. \n                        The substring \"10\" sets bit1.\n                        The substring \"1\" sets bit0.\n                        But we can only choose one substring. \n\n                    We can choose a substring that is \"100\" ( sets bit2) and then the OR with T sets bit2, but not bit0 and bit1. \n\n                    We can choose a substring that is the entire string? -> T, then we get T, which is 8.\n\n                    We can choose two substrings: \n                        We can choose any two. \n                        For example, choose S1 = \"1\" (1) and S2 = \"10\" (2). Then the OR of the two numbers: 1|2 = 3 (0011) -> not 15.\n\n                    How about: \n                        choose T and then a substring that is \"1\" and \"10\" and \"100\"? -> but we can only choose two.\n\n                    Insight: \n                        The value is the bitwise OR of f(s1) and f(s2). \n                        We can choose s1 = \"1000\" and s2 = \"1000\" -> then OR=8.\n\n                    Another: s1 = \"1000\", s2 = \"1\" -> 8|1=9.\n                    s1 = \"1000\", s2 = \"10\" -> 8|2=10.\n                    s1 = \"1000\", s2 = \"100\" -> 8|4=12.\n                    s1 = \"1000\", s2 = \"000\" -> 8|0=8.\n                    s1 = \"000\", s2 = \"1\" -> 0|1=1.\n\n                    The maximum is 12.\n\n                    Therefore, we cannot achieve 15.\n\n                    What is the maximum OR for \"1000\"? \n                        12 (1100) or 9 (1001)? 12 is greater.\n\n                    How to achieve 12: \n                        s1 = \"1000\", s2 = \"100\" -> 8|4=12.\n\n                    Therefore, the condition for bit j: \n                        We can set bit j if there is a substring that has a 1 at a position that is j from its own end. \n                        In \"1000\", for bit0: we can set it by substring \"1\" -> sets bit0.\n                        for bit1: substring \"10\" -> sets bit1.\n                        for bit2: substring \"100\" -> sets bit2.\n                        for bit3: T sets it.\n\n                    But we cannot set bit0 and bit1 and bit2 in one go with one substring. \n\n                    Therefore, the OR of two substrings: \n                        We have T. \n                        We can choose one additional substring. \n                        The OR will be T OR ( the number from the substring).\n\n                        To set as many of the missing bits as possible, we should choose a substring that has a 1 in the highest possible bit? and then as many ones as possible below? \n\n                        In \"1000\", the missing bits are bit0, bit1, bit2. \n                        The substring \"100\" has the highest bit set (bit2) and then zeros. \n                        The OR: \n                            T: 1000\n                            S: 0100  (4, represented in 4 bits)\n                            OR: 1100 -> sets bit3 and bit2.\n\n                        This sets bit2, but not bit1 and bit0.\n\n                        Can we set more bits with one substring? \n                            The substring \"10\" has bit1 set: \n                                T: 1000\n                                S: 0010\n                                OR: 1010 -> sets bit3 and bit1.\n                            -> sets only bit1.\n\n                            The substring \"1\" has bit0 set: OR=1001.\n\n                        The best among these is 1100 (12) from substring \"100\".\n\n                    Therefore, the maximum OR is the maximum between:\n                        candidate = T OR (every possible substring)\n\n                    But there are O(n^2) substrings.\n\n                    However, note the constraint: in tests from 21 to 40, n=10^6. We cannot do O(n^2).\n\n                    There is a known efficient solution: \n                        We can use a greedy tri-based approach? \n\n                    Alternatively, we note the following: \n                        The OR of T and any substring is at least T.\n                        To set a bit j (>=0) that is not set in T, we need a substring that has a 1 in bit j.\n\n                        The maximum number we can get is at most (2^(L)-1) (all ones in L bits).\n\n                        We can try to build the maximum possible number bit by bit from high to low. \n\n                        We start with the current number = T.\n                        Then we consider the bits from high to low (from bit L-1 down to 0) and try to set the bit if it is not already set.\n\n                        For a bit j (0<=j<L) that is not set in the current number, we can set it if there is a substring that has a 1 in bit j and that is such that the entire number represented by that substring, when ORed with the current number, might set bit j and possibly more bits below.\n\n                        But note: setting a bit j might be done by a substring that has a 1 in bit j and zeros in the bits above j? because if it has a 1 in a bit above j, then the OR would set that bit, but that bit is already set by T.\n\n                        However, the substring might have ones in bits below j, which would be a bonus.\n\n                        Therefore, we can do a greedy: \n                            Let candidate = T.\n                            Let ans = candidate.\n                            For start in range(0, L): \n                                We consider the substring starting at start and then as long as the number is not too big? \n\n                        But efficiency.\n\n                    There is a solution in O(n) for the second substring: \n                        We note: the only substrings that matter are those that start at the first occurrence of a 1 and have length at most L. \n\n                        Specifically, the best substring to OR with T is the one that maximizes the OR. \n\n                        We can try: \n                            the substring that is the entire string: T.\n                            the substring that is T without the first character.\n                            the substring that is T without the first two characters.\n                            ...\n\n                        and also consider any substring that starts with a 1 and has length up to L.\n\n                        But there are O(L) of these.\n\n                        For each candidate substring (starting at a position i where T[i]=='1', and then taking a prefix of the rest), we can compute the number in O(L) and then OR with T in O(1) since we have the number. \n\n                        Total O(L^2) -> 10^12 for L=10^6 -> not possible.\n\n                    There is a solution using a rolling hash or binary expansion in O(1) per substring? \n\n                    Insight from known problems: \n                        We can precompute the OR for all substrings that start with a '1' and have length up to L in a greedy way. \n\n                        We start at the first '1'. \n                        Let current = 0.\n                        Let best = 0.\n                        For i in range(first1, len(T)):\n                            current = (current << 1) | (1 if T[i]=='1' else 0)\n                            candidate_OR = T_value | current\n                            if candidate_OR > best:\n                                best = candidate_OR\n\n                        But this only considers contiguous substrings starting at the first '1'. \n\n                        Example: T = \"11010\", T_value = 26.\n                            i0: '1' -> current=1, OR=26|1=27 (11011) -> best=27.\n                            i1: '1' -> current = (1<<1)|1 = 3, OR=26|3=31 -> best=31.\n                            i2: '0' -> current = (3<<1)|0 = 6, OR=26|6=30 -> best=31.\n                            i3: '1' -> current = (6<<1)|1 = 13, OR=26|13=31 -> best=31.\n                            i4: '0' -> current = (13<<1)|0 = 26, OR=26|26=26.\n\n                        So we found 31.\n\n                        Example2: T=\"1000\", T_value=8.\n                            i0: '1' -> current=1, OR=8|1=9.\n                            i1: '0' -> current= (1<<1)|0 = 2, OR=8|2=10.\n                            i2: '0' -> current=4, OR=12.\n                            i3: '0' -> current=8, OR=8.\n                            best=12.\n\n                        But is 12 the maximum? \n                            Consider substring \"10\" ( which is at i0 to i1): we got 10.\n                            substring \"100\" (i0 to i2): 12.\n                            substring \"1000\": 8.\n                            substring \"0\" (any) -> not starting with '1'? we skip.\n                            substring at i1: '0' -> skip.\n                            substring at i1 to i2: \"00\" -> skip.\n                            substring at i1 to i3: \"000\" -> skip.\n                            substring at i2: \"0\" -> skip.\n                            substring at i2 to i3: \"00\" -> skip.\n                            substring at i3: \"0\" -> skip.\n\n                        So we only consider contiguous substring from the first '1'. \n\n                        Why is that sufficient? \n                            Because any substring that starts with a '0' will have a number that is<= a substring that starts with a '1' (because leading zeros don't change the number) and might be covered by a shorter substring starting with '1'. \n\n                        But consider: \n                            T = \"1010\", \n                            T_value = 10.\n                            contiguous from first '1': \n                                \"1\" -> 1, OR=10|1=11 (1011)\n                                \"10\" -> 2, OR=10|2=10|2=10 (1010 in bits) -> 1010 OR 0010 = 1010 -> 10.\n                                \"101\" -> 5, OR=10|5=15 (1111)\n                                \"1010\" -> 10, OR=10|10=10.\n                            best=15.\n\n                            Is there a substring not starting at the first '1' that might give more?

\n                            We can try: start at the first '1' and then also start at the next '1'? \n\n                        Note: the substring \"0101\" starts with '0'. But we can skip the leading zeros? \n                            The number represented by \"0101\" is the same as \"101\", which is 5. \n                            So we can skip the leading zeros and then take the next '1'. \n\n                        Therefore, we can do: \n                            We consider every substring that is of the form: after removing the leading zeros, we have a substring starting with '1'. \n                            But then the number is the same as the substring without the leading zeros.\n\n                        Therefore, we only need to consider substrings that start with '1'. \n\n                        In \"0101\", we can remove the leading '0' and get \"101\", which is the same as the substring starting at index2: \"101\", which we did consider in the contiguous from the first '1' (index0) we did \"101\" (from index0 to index2) -> but wait, in the example above, we considered contiguous substring from the first '1' (index0) and then at index0 we did \"101\" ( indices0..2) -> which is \"101\", not \"0101\". \n\n                        However, the number for \"0101\" is the same as the number for \"101\" ( if we remove the leading zero, the number is the same). \n\n                        Therefore, we only need to consider substrings that have no leading zeros. \n\n                        And we can generate them by: \n                            For every occurrence of '1' in T, consider the substring from that '1' to the end of a certain length. \n                            But note: the number might be very long (up to L bits) and we cannot convert to an integer if L=10^6.\n\n                        How to compare the OR without converting to integer? \n                            We want the maximum OR. \n\n                        We can do: \n                            Let T_value is an integer, but L can be 10^6 -> the number has 10^6 bits, which is too big for Python int in the sense of bit-level operations? Python int is arbitrary precision, but the loop over 10^6 substrings and for each doing an OR of two numbers of 10^6 bits would be O(n^2) in the number of bits -> 10^12.\n\n                        Therefore, we need a better way.\n\n                    There is a solution in C++ with bitset? \n\n                    Alternatively, we note the following: \n                        The OR of T and S is at least T.\n                        The only bits we can set are the ones that are not set in T. \n                        We want to set as many high bits as possible. \n\n                        Consider two candidates substring A and B. \n                        We want to know if A is better than B: \n                            Let A and B be two substrings (starting at i and j respectively) and let the numbers be a and b.\n                            We want to know if (T|a) > (T|b).\n\n                        How to compare without big integers? \n                            Since T is fixed, let's let R = (T|a) and S = (T|b).\n                            We want to know if R > S.\n\n                        We can compare from high to low: \n                            The highest bit where R and S differ.\n\n                        But note: R and S have the same bits as T in the positions where T has a 1. \n                        The only difference is in the positions where T has a 0 and a or b has a 1.\n\n                        Therefore, the highest bit where they differ is the highest bit that is set in one of a or b and not in the other, and that is not set in T.\n\n                        So we can compare a and b in the positions where T has a 0, from high to low.\n\n                        Specifically, we can build a binary representation of the number a, but only for the positions where T has a 0, and then compare these numbers. \n\n                        How to generate a for a substring quickly? \n                            We can use a rolling hash for the substring, but for comparison we need the actual binary number in the positions of the zeros of T.\n\n                        Alternatively, we can use a greedy: \n                            We want the substring that has a 1 in the highest bit (among the bits where T has a 0) and then in case of tie, the next highest, etc.\n\n                        This is like a lexicographic order on the binary representation in the positions of the zeros of T, from high to low.\n\n                        But note: the highest bit in the number a is the most significant bit of a, which is the first '1' in the substring. \n\n                        Therefore, the best substring is the one that has the highest first '1' (in the entire string) and then the highest next bit, etc.\n\n                        But wait: the most significant bit of a might be at a lower index in the string? \n\n                        Example: \n                            T = \"1000\", then the positions where T has a 0 are indices1,2,3.\n                            For a substring starting at index0: \"1000\" -> a=8, which in the positions of zeros of T: \n                                bit3: not in the zeros (because bit3 is the first bit, which is set in T) -> skip.\n                                bit2: index1: '0' -> 0\n                                bit1: index2: '0' -> 0\n                                bit0: index3: '0' -> 0\n                            -> the number in the zeros is 0.\n\n                            For a substring starting at index0: \"100\" -> a=4, which is the substring to index0..2: \n                                bit2: index1: '0' -> 0\n                                bit1: index2: '0' -> 0\n                                bit0: not present? \n                            -> also 0.\n\n                            For a substring starting at index0: \"10\" -> a=2: \n                                bit1: index1: '0' -> 0\n                            -> 0.\n\n                            For a substring starting at index0: \"1\" -> a=1: \n                                no bit in the zeros -> 0.\n\n                            For a substring starting at index1: \"0\" -> skip.\n                            For a substring starting at index1: \"00\" -> skip.\n                            For a substring starting at index1: \"000\" -> skip.\n\n                        So they are all 0.\n\n                        But we know that the OR for \"1000\" with \"100\" is 12, and with \"10\" is 10, and with \"1\" is 9.\n\n                        How to compare in the zeros: \n                            The OR result for \"1000\"|\"100\" = 12 = 1100.\n                            The OR result for \"1000\"|\"10\" = 10 = 1010.\n                            We see that in the zeros, the '100\" gives a 1 at bit2 ( which is the third bit from the left, or index1 in the OR result? wait) -> \n                                In 1100, the bits: \n                                    bit3: 1 ( from T)\n                                    bit2: 1 ( from a)\n                                    bit1: 0\n                                    bit0: 0\n                            In the positions where T has a 0 ( initially T=1000: bit3=1, bit2=0, bit1=0, bit0=0), we set bit2 to 1.\n\n                            For \"10\" ( which is 2), the OR=1010: \n                                bit3: 1 (T)\n                                bit2: 0 (T has 0, a has 0)\n                                bit1: 1 ( from a)\n                                bit0: 0\n                            -> in the zeros, we set bit1.\n\n                            We want the highest bit in the zeros to be set. bit2 > bit1, so \"100\" is better.\n\n                        Therefore, the best substring is the one that has a 1 in the highest bit (among the bits where T has a 0).\n\n                        How to find that substring? \n                            The highest bit in the zeros is the highest index j ( in the bit position, so high bit means high power of 2) that is not set in T and that is set in a.\n\n                        In T=\"1000\", the highest bit in the zeros is bit2 ( which is the third bit from the left, or the second bit from the right? in a 4-bit representation, bit3 is the highest, then bit2, then bit1, then bit0). \n                        The highest bit in the zeros is bit2.\n\n                        We therefore look for a substring that has a 1 in bit2. \n                            bit2 in the number a means that the substring must have length at least 3 and the first character must be '1' (because the first character is the most significant and will be bit (len(a)-1) in the number a, and we want it to be bit2 in the OR result? wait, not exactly.\n\n                        How to set bit2 in the OR result? \n                            We need a substring that has a 1 in its own bit2. \n                            The own bit2 of the substring a means the substring must have a 1 at the position that is 2 from the most significant bit? -> no, the most significant bit is bit (len(a)-1), then bit (len(a)-2), etc. \n\n                        Actually, to set bit2 in the number a, the substring must have length at least 3, and the first character must be '1' ( to have bit2 set in a number of length 3: the first character is bit2). \n\n                        In T=\"1000\", the only substring that has a 1 in bit2 is a substring of length 3 that starts with '1'. -> \"100\" ( indices0..2) -> which is the one we found.\n\n                        Then, among those that set bit2, we want the one that sets the next highest bit in the zeros, and so on.\n\n                        Therefore, we can do: \n                            Let F = the set of bit positions where T has a 0, sorted from high to low.\n                            We look for a substring that has a 1 in the highest bit in F. If there are multiple, then we look for a 1 in the next highest, etc.\n\n                        This is like a trie for the substring, but only in the positions where T has a 0.\n\n                        However, note: the substring's number might have a 1 in a bit that is not in F ( because it's in the range of T's ones) -> but that doesn't help.\n\n                        Therefore, we only care about the bits in F.\n\n                        We can build a string of the entire string, but only for the positions where T has a 0? \n\n                        But note: the substring's number is defined by its own length. The bit positions in the number a are determined by the length of a. \n\n                        Alternatively, we can generate the substring in the following way: \n                            For a substring starting at i, the number a has bits: \n                                a = 0\n                                for j in range(i, min(i+length, len(T))):\n                                    a = a * 2 + (1 if T[j]=='1' else 0)\n\n                            and this number has bits that might overlap with T's ones and zeros.\n\n                        Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem has 40 tests and the first 10 have n<=5, then 11-20 have n=1000, and 21-40 have n=10^6, we need an efficient solution.\n\n                    There is a known solution in C++ for this problem ( from Codeforces submissions for the problem \"Educational Codeforces Round 134 (Rated for Div. 2), problem C\", but the problem statement matches).\n\n                    However, the given code for program2.py is:\n\n                        n = input()\n                        s = int(input(),2)\n\n                        res = 0\n                        for i in range(100):\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                        ans = bin(res)[2:]\n                        print(ans)\n\n                    The for loop is from 0 to 99. This suggests that we only need to iterate 100 times. \n\n                    What is the solution in the editorial? \n                        We can try: \n                            Let T = s without leading zeros.\n                            If T is empty, then output 0.\n                            Let L = len(T)\n                            We then consider at most (L) additional substrings, but the for loop is 100, and L can be 10^6, so we cannot iterate over L.\n\n                    Another known solution: \n                        The maximum OR is either:\n                            candidate0 = T\n                            candidate1 = T OR ( the number from the substring that is the best we can get)\n\n                        And the best substring is the one that starts at the first occurrence of a 1 and extends for L+L-1? \n\n                    After checking known solutions for a similar problem (C.

64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 127.\n\n                    How do we get 127? \n                        114 | 13? \n                        Let me do 114>>4 = 114//16 = 7.125 -> floor 7.\n                        114 | 7 = 119.\n\n                    Therefore, the maximum in the loop for example2 is 126 at i=2.\n\n                    Why at i=4 we got 119, not 127.\n\n                    So the maximum is 126.\n\n                    Therefore, the code is: \n                        for i in range(100):\n                            res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\n\n                    But note: the shifting might be by more than the number of bits, then s>>i is 0, and s|0 = s.\n\n                    This will work for i up to the number of bits, and the number of bits is up to 10^6, but we only do 100 iterations.\n\n                    Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \n                        res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\n\n                    But note: the initial res is 0, and in the first iteration (i=0): \n                        0 | (s|s) = s, then we take max(0, s) = s.\n                    Then i=1: max(s, s| (s>>1)), etc.\n\n                    So it's correct.\n\n                    Let me test example2 manually with the code: \n                        n = input()  # \"7\"\n                        s = int(input(),2) # int(\"1110010\",2) = 114\n                        res = 0\n                        for i in range(100):\n                            res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\n                        then ans = bin(res)[2:] = bin(126)[2:] = '1111110'\n\n                    Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \"    res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\"\n\n                    The indentation: inside the for loop, and the for loop is for i in range(100):, and the TODO is in the body.\n\n                    So we replace the TODO with: \"    res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\"\n\n                    But note: the code has 4 spaces for the for loop, and then the TODO is at 8 spaces. So we output: \"    res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\"\n\n                    However, the existing code has:\n\n                        for i in range(100):\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                    So we replace the TODO line with: \"    res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\"\n\n                    But the TODO line is commented, so we remove the comment and put the code.\n\n                    Therefore, the string for program2.py is: \"    res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\"\n\n For program3.py:\n\n The code is for a tree problem. We are to compute the sum of f(v,u) over all pairs, where f(v,u) is the number of values that appear exactly once on the edges of the simple path between u and v.\n\n The given code does a DFS (iterative) and maintains several arrays: \n   prev_node_stack: a stack for each edge value x to track the previous node that had an edge with the same value.\n   prev_node: for a node, the previous node in the DFS tree that had the same edge value? \n   sz: the size of the subtree.\n   dp_root: for a value x, the number of nodes in the tree that are in the component that is connected to the root (0) by edges with value x without going through a duplicate edge? \n   dp_remove: for a node, the number of nodes to remove from the subtree because of duplicate edge values? \n\n The missing part is in the UPDATE_DP state for an edge (v, u, x) (which is the edge from u to v with value x). \n   The code does:\n        if state == UPDATE_DP:\n            v, u, x = param\n            prev_node_stack[x].pop()\n            sz[u] += sz[v]\n            prev_node[v] = prev_node_stack[x][-1]\n            if prev_node[v] == 0:\n                dp_root[x] += sz[v]\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n The meaning: \n   We are updating the DP after finishing the subtree of v. \n   We have already popped the stack for x (which had v on top) and now the top of the stack for x is the previous node that had an edge with value x (which might be 0 meaning the root or another node).\n\n   Then we set prev_node[v] to that node.\n\n   If that node is the root (0), then we add the size of the subtree of v to dp_root[x]. \n\n   Otherwise, we need to update dp_remove for the node that is the previous node (which is stored in prev_node[v]). \n\n   The idea: \n        We are counting the number of pairs (v, u) that have a unique occurrence of edge value x. \n        The standard solution for this problem is to use the contribution of each edge value: \n            For an edge value x, let's consider the tree with only the edges with value x. \n            Then the unique occurrence of x in a path means that the path contains exactly one edge of value x.\n\n        The known solution: \n            For each edge value x, remove all edges that are not x, then the tree becomes a forest. In each tree in the forest, remove the edges with value x that appear more than once? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a DFS and for each edge value x, we want to count the number of paths that have exactly one edge with value x.\n\n        The code is using a method with a stack for each x to track the previous edge with value x.\n\n        In the else branch, we have a non-root previous node. \n        We need to update dp_remove for that previous node: \n            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\n\n        Why? \n            Because the current subtree of v is attached to the node 'prev_node[v]' by an edge with value x, and if there is already an edge with value x in the path from the root to 'prev_node[v]', then the entire subtree of v will be counted in the component of the previous occurrence. \n\n        Then later in the final answer, we use:\n\n            ans = sum((sz[v] - dp_remove[v]) * (sz[prev_node[v]] - (dp_root[x] if prev_node[v] == 0 else dp_remove[prev_node[v]])) ... )\n\n        The final answer calculation is not fully shown, but it is:\n\n            ans = sum((sz[v] - dp_remove[v]) * (sz[prev_node[v]] - (dp_root[x] if prev_node[v] == 0 else dp_remove[prev_node[v]])) for ... )\n\n        Specifically, it is iterating over edges: for u in range(n) for v,x in adj[u] if sz[u] > sz[v] (so we consider each edge once).\n\n        The term: (sz[v] - dp_remove[v]) might be the size of the component in which the edge with value x is the only occurrence? \n\n        Therefore, in the else branch, we should do:\n\n            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\n\n        This is seen in the if branch: if it is the root, we add to dp_root[x] (which is a global for value x) the size of the subtree of v.\n\n        Similarly, for a non-root previous node, we add to dp_remove[prev_node[v]] the size of the subtree of v.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code is: \n            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\n\n        So for program3.py, the missing code is: \"            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\"\n\n        But note: the code has a comment in the else branch, and we replace that with the code.\n\n        The indentation: the else branch is already at 12 spaces, and the TODO is at 16 spaces. So we output: \"            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\"\n\n        However, the existing code has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we replace the TODO line with: \"            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\"\n\n        Therefore, the string for program3.py is: \"            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\"\n\n Summary:\n\n   program1: \"                s += b[k+w][l+w]\"\n   program2: \"    res = max(res, s | (s >> i))\"\n   program3: \"            dp_remove[prev_node[v]] += sz[v]\"\n\n We output in JSON format."
