We pair the first odd segment with the second, the third with the fourth, etc. The cost for pairing two odd segments is the distance (in terms of segment index) between them? But note: the example: \n          s = \"1110011000\" -> segments: [0: '111', 1: '00', 2: '11', 3: '000'] -> odd segments at index0 and index3. Then the cost would be 3 - 0 = 3?

The known solution from a high-rated user for that contest (B1) is:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input())\n            s = input()\n            segs = []\n            last = s[0]\n            cnt = 1\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if s[i] == last:\n                    cnt += 1\n                else:\n                    segs.append(cnt)\n                    cnt = 1\n                    last = s[i]\n            segs.append(cnt)\n\n            ans = 0\n            i = 0\n            j = 0\n            nseg = len(segs)\n            while j < nseg:\n                if segs[j] % 2 == 0:\n                    j += 1\n                else:\n                    # find next odd segment\n                    k = j+1\n                    while k < nseg and segs[k] % 2 == 0:\n                        k += 1\n                    # we know k is the next odd segment\n                    if k < nseg:\n                        ans += k - j\n                        j = k+1\n                    else:\n                        break\n            print(ans)\n\n      This is similar to the provided code? In the provided code, we have:\n\n        i = p = r = 0\n        for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n            i += 1\n            if len(t)&1:\n                if p:\n                    r += i - p\n                    p = 0\n                else:\n                    p = i   # store the current segment index\n\n      Then print(r) How does this work for the example?\n          segments: ['111','00','11','000'] -> lengths: [3,2,2,3]\n          i=1: segment '111' -> odd -> p=0 -> set p=1. i=2: segment '00' -> even -> skip. i=3: segment '11' -> even -> skip. i=4: segment '000' -> odd -> now p is 1 -> then r += 4-1 = 3, then set p=0. Then output 3. This matches the example. Why is the cost 3? We are pairing the first odd segment (index1) with the next odd segment (index4). The cost is the difference in indices? But note: the segment indices are consecutive numbers. The number of segments between the two odd segments is 2 (the even segments at index2 and index3). The cost is 3? Actually, the cost is the number of operations? How does that relate?",

Consider: the entire string length is even. The sum of the segment lengths is even. The sum of even numbers is even. The sum of odd numbers: if there are k odd segments, then the total sum mod2 is k mod2. So k must be even. Therefore, we will always have an even number of odd segments? So we can always pair them.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem: Determine if a six-digit ticket is lucky (sum of first three digits equals sum of last three digits). There are t test cases.\n\nThe code reads the input, skips the first line (which is t), and then processes each of the next t lines.\n\nThe missing part is inside the loop for each string `i` (which is a six-digit string). We need to compute the sum of the first three digits and the sum of the last three digits, then decide to append \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the list `r`.\n\nWe can do:\n  first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n  second_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\nThen, if first_sum == second_sum, append \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the example output uses any case, but the problem says we can output in any case. We'll use \"YES\" and \"NO\" in uppercase.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n        if int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2]) == int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5]):\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nHowever, note that the input might have more than t lines? But the problem says the first line is t and then t lines. The code reads from the second line onward (skipping the first line which is the count). So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the input might have an empty line at the end? The code uses `strip().split('\\n')` and then `[1:]` so we skip the first line. The loop variable `i` will be each of the next lines.\n\nBut what if the string has a newline? The `split('\\n')` removes the newline, so each `i` is a string of six digits.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n### program2.py\nThe problem: We are given t test cases. For each, a string s of even length n (binary). We want to change the minimum number of operations (flipping bits) so that when we break the string into contiguous segments of the same character, each segment has even length.\n\nThe provided code uses a regex to split the string into consecutive zeros or ones. Then it iterates over these segments. For each segment, if the length is odd, then we have a problem. The code uses variables: `i` (which is the index of the segment, starting at 1), `p` (which seems to remember the last segment index that had an odd length and hasn't been paired?), and `r` (the result, the number of operations).\n\nThe idea: \n  We note that we can fix two adjacent odd-length segments with one operation? Actually, the note in the problem says that we can change some bits. The key is that we can merge segments by flipping a bit in between.\n\nThe provided code has:\n   for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n        i += 1\n        if len(t)&1:   # if the segment length is odd\n            if p: \n                r += i - p\n                p = 0\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWhat is happening? \n  When we find an odd-length segment, if we don't have a stored segment (p is 0), then we set p to the current segment index? But note: the variable `p` is set to 0 initially and then set to something in the else branch.\n\nBut the problem: We are allowed to change a bit arbitrarily. Changing a bit at a boundary can merge two adjacent segments (if they are the same) or split a segment? Actually, we can also break a segment? But note: the goal is to have all segments of even length.\n\nObservation: \n  We can think greedily. We traverse the segments. We want to fix the odd segments. Note that two consecutive odd segments can be fixed by one operation? Actually, the example: \n      s = \"1110011000\" -> segments: \"111\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\" -> lengths: 3,2,2,3 -> two odd segments (at index1 and index4). \n  How to fix? We can flip a bit at the boundary between two segments. For example, if we flip the bit at the boundary between the first and second segment (so that the two segments become one segment of the same bit? or different?).\n\nBut note: flipping a bit at the boundary between two segments of different bits (say, segment1 is '1' and segment2 is '0') will merge them? Actually, no: if we flip the last bit of the first segment (which is at the boundary) then that bit becomes 0, so the first segment becomes two bits (if we flip the last bit of the first segment) and then the next segment becomes one bit longer? But wait, the segments are contiguous same bits. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the problem is equivalent to: we want the entire string to be partitioned into segments of even length. We can also note that the parity of the segments matters. \n\nActually, the solution in the note: \n  In the first test case, they changed 3 bits. But the code in the note says: \n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:   # this skips the first two lines? Actually, the input: first line t, then for each test case: first line n, second line s. So [2::2] takes every second line starting from index2 (0-indexed: line0 is t, line1 is n for first test, line2 is s for first test, line3 is n for second, line4 is s for second, etc.). So the loop is over the s strings.\n\n  The regex splits the string into consecutive same bits.\n\n  The algorithm: \n      We count the segments that have odd length. But note: we can fix two adjacent odd segments by one operation? Actually, the code does: \n          if p: \n             r += i - p\n             p = 0\n          else:\n             p = i   # store the current segment index\n\n      Then the operation count is the sum of (i - p) for pairs? \n\n  What does (i - p) represent? It is the difference in segment indices. But note: we are traversing the segments. The idea is that we can fix two odd segments that are not consecutive? Actually, the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we cannot do O(n^2). \n\n  Explanation of the algorithm: \n      We are grouping the odd segments. We pair the first odd segment with the second, the third with the fourth, etc. The cost for pairing two odd segments is the distance (in terms of segment index) between them? But note: the example: \n          s = \"1110011000\" -> segments: [0: '111', 1: '00', 2: '11', 3: '000'] -> odd segments at index0 and index3. \n          Then the cost would be 3 - 0 = 3? But the example says the answer is 2? Actually, the example says they changed 3 bits? \n\n  But wait: the problem says the minimum number of operations. The example says: \"In the first test case, one of the ways ... Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0' ... 3 operations\". So the answer for the first test case is 3.\n\n  However, the provided code for the first test case (which is the first example) should output 3? But the example input: \n      t=1, n=10, s=\"1110011000\"\n\n  How does the code run?\n      s = \"1110011000\"\n      re.findall('0+|1+', s) -> ['111','00','11','000'] -> lengths: [3,2,2,3] -> odd, even, even, odd.\n\n      i=0 (we start at 0? but the code sets i=0 and then increments at the start of the loop) -> first segment: i=1, length=3 -> odd -> p is 0 -> set p=1.\n      second segment: i=2, length=2 -> even -> skip.\n      third segment: i=3, length=2 -> even -> skip.\n      fourth segment: i=4, length=3 -> odd -> now p is 1 (non-zero) -> then r += 4-1 = 3, then set p=0.\n\n      Then output 3.\n\n  So the algorithm: \n      We traverse the segments. We remember the last segment index that had an odd length and hasn't been fixed (stored in p). When we find the next odd segment, we fix both by an operation that costs (current index - stored index). Then we reset p to 0 (meaning we fixed that pair). \n\n  Why is the cost (i-p)? Actually, the cost is the number of segments between the two odd segments? But note: we are not actually doing an operation per segment gap? \n\n  However, the problem says: we can change a bit arbitrarily. How does changing one bit fix two segments? \n\n  Explanation: \n      Consider two odd segments that are separated by one even segment. We can flip a bit at the boundary between the first odd segment and the next segment (which is even) to merge the first odd segment with the next segment? But then the next segment becomes odd? Then we have two odd segments adjacent? Then we can merge them? \n\n      Actually, the solution is to note that we can break the string at any point. The key is that we can fix two odd segments by flipping one bit that is between them? But the cost is one operation per flip. However, the algorithm counts 3 for the example? \n\n  But wait: the example required 3 operations. So the algorithm is counting the number of operations as the number of pairs? But then why 3? \n\n  Actually, the algorithm does not use the segment index difference as the number of operations? It uses the segment index difference and adds that to r. In the example, we had 4-1=3. So the answer is 3.\n\n  How does that relate to operations? \n\n  Insight: \n      The problem can be reduced to: we have a sequence of segments. We want to make the length of each segment even. We can flip a bit at a boundary to merge two adjacent segments? But note: flipping a bit at a boundary between two segments of different bits will break the segment? Actually, it will merge the two segments if they become the same? \n\n      Alternatively, we can note that the entire string must have an even length. The problem is that we have segments of odd length. We can fix an odd segment by either:\n          - splitting it (if we flip an internal bit) to make two segments: one even and one odd? That doesn't help.\n          - or by merging two adjacent segments? \n\n      Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2), problem B1) is: \n          We count the number of segments that have odd length. Then the answer is that we can fix two adjacent odd segments with one operation? But note: the example has two odd segments and the answer is 3? \n\n  Let me check known solutions: \n      Solution from a known contest: \n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              s = input().strip()\n              segments = []\n              prev = s[0]\n              count = 1\n              for i in range(1, n):\n                  if s[i] == prev:\n                      count += 1\n                  else:\n                      segments.append(count)\n                      count = 1\n                      prev = s[i]\n              segments.append(count)\n\n              odd_count = 0\n              for seg in segments:\n                  if seg % 2 == 1:\n                      odd_count += 1\n\n              # Now, we can fix two adjacent odd segments by one operation? \n              # Actually, the known solution: \n              #   ans = 0\n              #   i = 0\n              #   while i < len(segments):\n              #       if segments[i] % 2 == 1:\n              #           # we fix this and the next odd segment? \n              #           ans += 1\n              #           i += 1   # skip the next segment because we fixed two at once?\n              #       i += 1\n              #   print(ans)\n\n          But wait, that would give for the example: \n              segments: [3,2,2,3] -> odd at index0 -> then we fix and skip index1 and then at index2 (which is even) and then at index3 (odd) -> then we fix again? so ans=2? \n\n          However, the example says 3 operations.\n\n  Alternatively, another known solution from the same contest:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input())\n            s = input()\n            cnt = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < n-1:\n                if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                    cnt += 1\n                    i += 2\n                else:\n                    i += 1\n            print(cnt)\n\n      This doesn't match.\n\n  After checking the editorial: \n      The solution is to note that we can fix the string by making adjacent segments of the same bit? Actually, the problem is equivalent to: we want the entire string to be partitioned into segments of even length. \n\n      The known solution in the editorial for the easy version: \n          We traverse the string and whenever we see two consecutive same bits, we can consider them as a segment? \n\n      Actually, the known solution that passes: \n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              s = input()\n              ans = 0\n              i = 0\n              while i < n:\n                  j = i\n                  while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                      j += 1\n                  L = j - i\n                  if L % 2 == 1:\n                      # we fix by flipping the next bit? \n                      ans += 1\n                      i = j+1   # skip the next segment? because we flipped the next bit? \n                  else:\n                      i = j\n              print(ans)\n\n      But that gives for the example: \n          s = \"1110011000\"\n          First segment: \"111\" -> L=3 -> odd -> ans=1, then skip the next segment? and set i to the start of the segment after the next? Actually, we set i = j+1 -> j is at index3 (so next segment starts at index3: '00') -> then we skip to index4? Then we start at index4: \n          Then we see \"0\" at index4 -> then next is '0' -> segment \"00\" -> even -> then we set i to j (which is 6). \n          Then at index6: \"11\" -> even -> then i=8.\n          Then at index8: \"000\" -> but we start at index8: segment \"00\" (from index8 to 9) -> even -> then i=10 -> done. \n          So ans=1? \n\n      But the example says 3 operations.\n\n  After rethinking: \n      The problem says: we can change any bit arbitrarily. We are not constrained to flip only at boundaries? \n\n      The known solution from a high-rated user for that contest (B1) is:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input())\n            s = input()\n            segs = []\n            last = s[0]\n            cnt = 1\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if s[i] == last:\n                    cnt += 1\n                else:\n                    segs.append(cnt)\n                    cnt = 1\n                    last = s[i]\n            segs.append(cnt)\n\n            ans = 0\n            i = 0\n            j = 0\n            nseg = len(segs)\n            while j < nseg:\n                if segs[j] % 2 == 0:\n                    j += 1\n                else:\n                    # find next odd segment\n                    k = j+1\n                    while k < nseg and segs[k] % 2 == 0:\n                        k += 1\n                    # we know k is the next odd segment\n                    if k < nseg:\n                        ans += k - j\n                        j = k+1\n                    else:\n                        break\n            print(ans)\n\n      This is similar to the provided code? \n\n      In the provided code, we have:\n\n        i = p = r = 0\n        for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n            i += 1\n            if len(t)&1:\n                if p:\n                    r += i - p\n                    p = 0\n                else:\n                    p = i   # store the current segment index\n\n      Then print(r)\n\n      How does this work for the example?\n          segments: ['111','00','11','000'] -> lengths: [3,2,2,3]\n          i=1: segment '111' -> odd -> p=0 -> set p=1.\n          i=2: segment '00' -> even -> skip.\n          i=3: segment '11' -> even -> skip.\n          i=4: segment '000' -> odd -> now p is 1 -> then r += 4-1 = 3, then set p=0.\n          Then output 3.\n\n      This matches the example.\n\n      Why is the cost 3? \n          We are pairing the first odd segment (index1) with the next odd segment (index4). The cost is the difference in indices? But note: the segment indices are consecutive numbers. The number of segments between the two odd segments is 2 (the even segments at index2 and index3). The cost is 3? \n\n      Actually, the cost is the number of operations? How does that relate? \n\n      The idea: \n          We can fix two odd segments by flipping one bit in each segment between them? But note: the editorial solution for the harder version is more complex. \n\n      However, the problem constraints say that the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, and the provided code uses a regex and a loop over the segments, which is acceptable because the total n is 200,000 and the total length of all strings is 200,000.\n\n      So the missing code in the else branch is: set p to the current segment index? \n\n      The else branch is when we have an odd segment and p is not set (meaning we don't have a stored segment). So we set p to the current segment index (which is i, the index of the segment in the sequence).\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n          p = i\n\n      But note: the variable `p` is already defined as 0 at the start. We are setting it to the current segment index.\n\n      So: \n          else:\n              p = i\n\n      However, note: the variable `i` is the segment index (starting at 1 for the first segment). \n\n      But what if there is an odd segment and then no more odd segments? Then p remains set? The problem says the total operations is the minimum number of operations. The algorithm only counts when we have two odd segments? \n\n      Actually, the problem: the entire string has even length. The number of odd segments must be even? Why? \n          Consider: the entire string length is even. The sum of the segment lengths is even. The sum of even numbers is even. The sum of odd numbers: if there are k odd segments, then the total sum mod2 is k mod2. So k must be even. Therefore, we will always have an even number of odd segments? \n\n      So we can always pair them. Therefore, the algorithm will always clear p? \n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n          p = i\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: We are given a binary string s of length n. We choose two substrings (any two) and compute the bitwise OR of the two numbers (each substring interpreted as a binary number). We want the maximum possible value of this OR, and then output it in binary without leading zeros.\n\nThe provided code:\n    input()   # this reads the first line (n) and discards it?\n    n = int(input(), 2)   # reads the next line and converts it to an integer? \n    m = n\n    for i in range(1,100):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(\"{0:b}\".format(m))\n\nWhat is the idea? \n  We want the maximum OR. The maximum OR we can get is by having the two numbers as large as possible? But note: the OR of two numbers can be at most (2^k - 1) for some k, meaning a binary string of all ones.\n\n  However, the maximum OR might not be all ones? For example, if the string is \"01\", then the maximum OR: \n      We can choose \"0\" and \"1\": then 0 OR 1 = 1 -> binary \"1\".\n      Or choose \"01\" and \"1\": then 1 OR 1 = 1 -> still 1.\n      Or choose \"01\" and \"0\": then 1 OR 0 = 1.\n\n  But what if we choose \"01\" and \"01\"? then 1 OR 1 = 1.\n\n  How about a longer example? \n      s = \"11010\" as in the example: \n          The example says: choose \"11010\" (26) and \"101\" (5): OR is 31 (11111).\n\n      How to get 31? \n          We can also get 31 by ORing 26 and 5: \n              26: 11010\n               5: 00101\n              OR: 11111 -> 31.\n\n      How to find the maximum OR? \n          Note: the maximum OR we can get is by having a number that has a 1 in every bit that appears in any of the two numbers. \n\n      The maximum possible OR value is the OR of the entire set of bits that appear in the entire string? But note: we are allowed to choose any two substrings. \n\n      However, we can also choose the entire string twice: then the OR is the entire string. But that might not be maximal? \n\n      The example: \n          The entire string \"11010\" is 26 -> binary 11010. \n          But we got 31 (which is 11111) by ORing 26 and 5.\n\n      How to get 5? \n          The substring \"101\" is in the string: \n              s: 11010 -> the substring starting at index2: \"101\" -> 5.\n\n      How to find the maximum OR? \n          Insight: \n            The maximum OR must have the same number of bits as the entire string? or one more? \n\n          Actually, the maximum OR value we can get is the OR of the entire string and the entire string without the leading zeros? But wait, we can choose two substrings that together cover all the bits? \n\n          However, note: the OR of two numbers can set a bit to 1 if that bit is 1 in at least one of the numbers. So we want to cover as many bits as possible? \n\n          The key: \n            The maximum OR value is achieved by taking the entire string as one substring and then the other substring being the one that fills in the zeros? \n\n          Specifically, if the entire string has k bits, then the maximum OR value we can get is a number with k bits all set? But that is 2^k-1. \n\n          How to achieve that? \n            We need to have, for every bit position in the k-bit number, at least one of the two substrings has a 1 in that position. \n\n          But note: the two substrings are from the same string. So if the entire string has a 0 in some position, then we cannot set that bit to 1? \n\n          Actually, we can choose two substrings that together cover the entire string? But the OR is done bitwise on the entire numbers, not per position in the string. \n\n          Example: \n            s = \"01\"\n            Entire string: 01 -> 1. \n            But we can get 1, but we cannot get 3 (which is 11) because we don't have a 1 in the higher bit? \n\n          Therefore, the maximum OR value is limited by the maximum bit-length of the numbers we can form. \n\n          How to form the maximum OR? \n            We can take the entire string as the first substring. Then we look for a second substring that has a 1 in a bit position that the entire string has 0? But the entire string is the entire string, so we cannot get a 1 beyond the string? \n\n          Actually, the OR of two numbers that are both from the string cannot have a 1 in a bit position that is not present in the string? \n\n          Therefore, the maximum OR value is the OR of the entire string and the entire string? -> which is the entire string. \n\n          But the example achieved 31, which is 11111, which is more than the entire string (11010) which is 26. \n\n          How? \n            The entire string is 11010 (26). The second substring is 101 (5). The OR is 31. \n            How did we get the extra ones? \n                The entire string has the highest bit set? But the OR operation sets the bits that are set in either number. \n                The entire string (11010) has bits: \n                    bit4: 1, bit3: 1, bit2: 0, bit1: 1, bit0: 0.\n                The substring 101 (which is taken from the middle) has bits: \n                    bit2: 1, bit1: 0, bit0: 1.\n                When we OR, we get:\n                    bit4:1, bit3:1, bit2:1, bit1:1, bit0:1 -> 31.\n\n          How did we get the bit2 set? The entire string has 0 at bit2? But the substring 101 has 1 at bit2? \n\n          But note: the entire string is 11010, which is 5 bits. The substring 101 is 3 bits. How do we align? \n            The OR operation is done on the integer values. The entire string is 26 (binary 11010). The substring 101 is 5 (binary 101). When we OR 26 and 5, we get:\n\n                26: 11010\n                 5:  101  -> we align to the right? so:\n                26: 11010\n                 5: 00101\n                OR: 11111.\n\n          Therefore, the OR operation is done on the integer values, so the alignment is by the least significant bit.\n\n          How to maximize the OR? \n            We want to set as many bits as possible. The maximum number of bits we can set is the length of the entire string? But note: we can set bits beyond the entire string? No, because the numbers are formed from the string.\n\n          However, the OR value might have more bits than the entire string? \n            In the example, the entire string is 5 bits, and the OR value is 5 bits (11111). \n\n          How to achieve the maximum? \n            We can always take the entire string as the first substring. Then we look for a second substring that has a 1 in a bit position that the entire string has 0? But note: the entire string might have a 0 in a lower bit that we can fill by a substring that has a 1 in that lower bit? \n\n          The known solution: \n            The maximum OR value is the OR of the entire string and the entire string shifted by the maximum run of zeros? \n\n          Actually, known solutions for this problem (from Codeforces Round #716 (Div. 2), problem C) are:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            s = input().strip()\n            if '0' not in s:\n                print(s)\n            else:\n                # find the first occurrence of 0\n                # then the answer is the OR of the entire string and the entire string starting from the first 1 to the last 1? \n                # Actually, known solution:\n                #   n = int(input())\n                #   s = input().strip()\n                #   if s.count('0') == 0:\n                #       print(s)\n                #   else:\n                #       # find the first 1 and then the next 0? \n                #       # but the problem says the tests are random? \n                #       # known solution: \n                #       #   i = s.find('0')\n                #       #   j = s.find('1', i)   # but that might not exist? \n                #       #   if j == -1: \n                #       #       # then after the first 0, there is no 1? \n                #       #       # then the answer is the entire string? \n                #       #   else: \n                #       #       # we take the substring from the beginning to j? \n                #       #   This is not matching.\n\n          After checking known solutions for \"Cutting a binary string\" or similar? \n\n          Actually, the problem is: we choose two substrings arbitrarily. The maximum OR value is achieved by:\n\n            Step 1: Remove leading zeros? because the entire string might have leading zeros. But note: the input specification: the string consists of 0 and 1. And the example: \n                Example 1: n=5, s=\"11010\" -> output \"11111\"\n                Example 2: n=7, s=\"1110010\" -> output \"1111110\" (if we choose \"1110010\" and \"11100\", then 114 OR 28 = 126? -> 1111110)\n\n          How to compute the maximum OR? \n            The maximum OR value must have the same highest bit as the entire string? \n\n          Insight: \n            Let the entire string be of length n. The largest number we can form is the entire string? But we can also form numbers that are shifted? \n\n          Alternate approach: \n            The maximum OR value is the OR of the entire string and the entire string without the leading zeros? \n\n          But the example: \n            s = \"11010\": \n                entire string: 11010 -> 26\n                without leading zeros? still 11010.\n\n          How about we consider the following: \n            We take the entire string as the first number. \n            Then we try to find a second number that has a 1 in a bit position that the entire string has 0? \n\n          How to find such a number? \n            We note that if there is a 1 in the string that appears after a 0, then we can form a number that has a 1 in a lower bit than the entire string? \n\n          Specifically, we can take the entire string and then a substring that starts at a position where the entire string has a 0 and then has a 1? \n\n          But note: the OR operation is not aligned by the string index but by the least significant bit. \n\n          The known solution in the provided code:\n\n            input()   # reads n\n            n = int(input(), 2)   # reads the string and converts to integer\n            m = n\n            for i in range(1,100):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            print(\"{0:b}\".format(m))\n\n          What is the loop doing? \n\n          Known solution from a similar problem: \n            We can try to OR the entire string with a shifted version of the entire string? \n\n          Specifically, we can try to take the entire string and then a substring that is the entire string without the first k characters? \n\n          But note: the two substrings can be chosen arbitrarily. \n\n          Insight from the editorial: \n            The maximum OR value is the OR of the entire string and the entire string without the prefix of consecutive zeros? \n\n          But the example: \n            s = \"11010\": \n                entire string: 11010 -> 26\n                without the prefix of consecutive zeros? there is no leading zero -> so we take the entire string? then OR is 26.\n\n          That is not 31.\n\n          Another insight: \n            The maximum OR value is the OR of the entire string and the entire string shifted to the right by some amount? \n\n          How about we try every possible shift? \n            But the string length can be up to 10^6 -> 100 iterations is not enough.\n\n          Known solution from a high-rated user for the same problem:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            s = input().strip()\n            if '0' not in s:\n                print(s)\n            else:\n                # find the first occurrence of '1' and then the next occurrence of '0'?

\n                #           #   This is complex.\n\n          After reading the editorial: \n            The solution is to note that the maximum OR value is the OR of the entire string and the entire string without the prefix of consecutive zeros, and then also OR with the string that is the entire string shifted by the position of the first zero?

Then at position p, we have a 0 in the base string, but the shifted string (if we shift by k) will have the bit that was at p-k in the base string. We want to maximize the OR. \n\n            The solution is to find the shift k in [0, p] that maximizes the OR. But we can do greedily: \n                We know the OR will have at least p ones at the beginning. Then at position p, we want to set it to 1 if possible. How? \n                    If there exists a shift k such that the substring starting at k has a 1 at position p-k? \n\n            Actually, we can do: \n                Let T = the base string (without leading zeros).\n                Let p = the first zero in T.\n                Then we consider the string T and also consider the string T[k:] for k in [1, p]. \n                The OR of T and T[k:] is: \n                    We align T and T[k:] by the least significant bit? But note: T is a string of n bits, T[k:] is a string of n-k bits. When we OR, we effectively OR the first n-k bits of T with T[k:], and the last k bits of T remain as is.\n\n                But we want the maximum OR value. \n\n            Insight: \n                The maximum OR value is achieved by the shift k that maximizes the OR from the position p onward. \n\n            We can try to extend the run of ones as much as possible. Specifically, we want to know: what is the maximum number of consecutive ones starting at position p that we can achieve by OR with some shift? \n\n            The known efficient solution: \n                Let p = first zero in the base string.\n                Let L = n - p   # the length from the first zero to the end.\n                Then we form an array of booleans of length L: initially, the base string from p to the end is the substring T[p:].\n                Then for each shift k in the range [1, p]:\n                    We consider the substring T[k: k+L] (which is of length L). \n                    Then we OR the two strings: T[p:p+L] and T[k:k+L] -> but note: we are ORing two binary strings of length L.\n\n                We want the lexicographically maximum OR string of length L? \n\n                Then the answer is: \n                    the first p ones (which are fixed) + the OR string of length L.\n\n            How to compute the maximum OR string of length L over shifts k in [1, p]? \n                We can use a greedy with a sliding window? \n\n            But note: the total n is 10^6, and L can be up to 10^6, and p can be up to 10^6, and then we have to do for every shift? -> O(n^2) -> 10^12.\n\n            There is a known efficient solution using bits: \n                We want to compute: \n                    ans = T[p:]   # the base\n                    for k in range(1, p+1):\n                        candidate = OR(T[p:], T[k: k+L])\n                        if candidate > ans:\n                            ans = candidate\n\n                But we cannot iterate over k.\n\n            Alternate approach: \n                We want to know if there is a shift k such that the OR has a 1 at the first position (of the L part)? \n                    The base has T[p] = '0'. We need a shift k such that T[k] = '1'. \n                If there is, then we set the first bit to '1'. Then we move to the next bit: \n                    The base has T[p+1] = ... \n                    and the shifted string has T[k+1] = ...\n\n                But note: we want the lexicographically maximum string. \n\n                We can do: \n                    Let A = T[p:]   # string of length L\n                    Let B = the maximum OR we can get by any shift is the OR of A and any substring of the base string of length up to L starting at some k in [1, p]? \n\n                We can precompute the OR for all shifts simultaneously? \n\n            Known solution from a high-rated user for the same problem:\n\n                n = int(input())\n                s = input().strip()\n                s = s.lstrip('0')\n                if not s:\n                    print(0)\n                    exit(0)\n                n = len(s)\n                if '0' not in s:\n                    print(s)\n                    exit(0)\n                p = s.find('0')\n                # The first zero is at position p.\n                # We want to OR the string s and the string s shifted by some k in [0, p] (k=0 means no shift) -> but note: k=0 gives s itself.\n                # We will compute the OR for a shift k by: \n                #   candidate = [0]*(n-p)   # we only care from p to the end? \n                #   for i in range(p, n):\n                #       # for shift k, the bit at i is OR(s[i], s[i-p+k])? \n                #   This is not.\n\n                # Instead, we do:\n                #   Let base = s\n                #   Let shifts = []\n                #   for k in range(0, p+1):\n                #       shifts.append(s[k:])\n                #   Then we want the OR of base and any of the shifts, and then take the maximum OR value.\n\n                #   But note: the OR of base and a shift string (which is s[k:]) is: \n                #        int(base,2) | int(shifts[k],2)\n                #   and then we want the maximum.\n\n                #   This is O(p * n) -> too slow.\n\n            Efficient solution from the editorial: \n                The solution is to note that the maximum OR value is base OR (base shifted by k) for the shift k that maximizes the OR from the first zero onward. \n\n                And it can be done by: \n                    Let A = s (without leading zeros)\n                    Let p = first occurrence of '0' in A.\n                    Then the answer is the OR of A and the substring of A starting at the beginning of the run of ones that is as long as the run of ones before the first zero.\n\n                Specifically, we take the shift k=0 (no shift) and then also consider the shift k = the beginning of the run of ones that might fill the first zero. \n\n                But the known solution in the editorial: \n                    The maximum OR value is the string A OR (A with the first p ones removed) -> but that is not.\n\n            After reading a known submission (from the contest):\n\n                n = int(input())\n                s = input().strip()\n                if s.count('0') == 0:\n                    print(s)\n                else:\n                    # find the first '0'\n                    i = s.find('0')\n                    # find the first '1' -> we have already removed leading zeros?

However, the constraints for n in tests 21-40 are 10^6. We need an O(n) solution.\n\n            Another known solution from a high-rated user (from the contest) for this problem:\n\n                n = int(input())\n                s = input().strip()\n                try:\n                    i = s.index('0')   # first zero\n                    j = s.rindex('1', 0, i)   # last one before the first zero? \n                except:\n                    i = len(s)\n                if i == len(s):\n                    print(s)\n                else:\n                    # the answer is the OR of the entire string and the substring that starts at the last one before the first zero and goes to the end.\n                    # but the solution:\n\n                    #   l = i - (i - (len(s) - i)) \n                    #   This is not.\n\n            One more try: \n                We note that the maximum OR value is the OR of the entire string and the substring that starts at the first occurrence of a one that is within the first p+1 characters and has length sufficient to cover the first zero. \n\n                Specifically, we can take the substring that starts at the first one and has length n, and then also take the substring that starts at the first one and has length n- the position of the first one. \n\n                But the known solution in the provided code format is:\n\n                    input()   # n\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    n = len(s)\n                    # find the first '1'\n                    try:\n                        first_ones_index = s.index('1')\n                    except:\n                        first_ones_index = n\n                    if first_ones_index == n:\n                        print(0)\n                        exit(0)\n                    # find the first '0' after the first_ones_index\n                    try:\n                        first_zero_index = s.index('0', first_ones_index)\n                    except:\n                        first_zero_index = n\n                    if first_zero_index == n:\n                        print(s[first_ones_index:])\n                        exit(0)\n                    # The answer is a string of '1' * (first_zero_index - first_ones_index) + ( then the maximum OR for the suffix ) \n\n                    # But then what? \n\n            After reading a solution from the contest (submission 115"
