But the entire boundary must be covered by tiles of size 1xa (so each tile covers a consecutive segment of a squares). The condition is that the entire boundary length must be divisible by a? But that is necessary but not sufficient. We also have to consider the structure: the four corners are fixed. Actually, the problem has been studied. The solution is to consider the divisors of the total boundary? But note: the boundary is 2*(w+l-2). However, the problem says: the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. And they are 1xa. We can break the boundary into four segments: \n   Segment1: top row: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> length w\n   Segment2: right column: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> but note (w-1,0) is already covered?

The condition for a to be valid is that a must divide the entire boundary? But that is not sufficient. We must also be able to cover the corners? Actually, we can consider the four corners as fixed. The problem is that the tile must cover consecutive squares. The boundary has four corners. The tile that covers a corner must be placed so that the corner is at one end? But note the tile can be rotated. We can consider the following: \n   The boundary can be covered if and only if a divides the entire boundary? But the sample: w=3, l=5 -> boundary=2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. Then a must divide 12? But the sample says a=1,2,3 are valid. But 4,6,12 also divide 12? Why are they not valid? So we must look at the structure.

The conditions for a>=3:\n\n        (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w % a != 1) or (l % a != 1) )\n\n   Let me test with the sample w=3, l=5, a=3:\n\n        w % 3 = 0 < =2 -> True\n        l % 3 = 2 <=2 -> True\n        (0 != 1) or (2 != 1) -> True (because 0!=1 is true) So a=3 is valid. a=4:\n\n        w % 4 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False. a=5:\n\n        w % 5 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False.\n\n   a=6: \n        w % 6 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False. a=12: \n        w % 12 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False. a=1: valid (by initial set)\n   a=2: valid (by initial set) So the valid a: 1,2,3.

But in the given code, we have:\n\n        solutions = {1,2} Then in the loop, we are to add a if it satisfies the condition and a>2? But the condition is for a>2? However, the condition in the known solution for a>=3. Also, note that a might be 1 or 2 again? But we start with {1,2} and then we are iterating for divisors, and we might get a=1 or a=2? But then we skip because we have a set? Actually, the given code does not have a seen set? The given code snippet does not have a seen set. But the problem says the output must be sorted and distinct. We can do: \n\n        if a not in solutions and a>=3: \n            if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w%a==1 and l%a==1):\n                solutions.add(a) But wait, the condition: not (w%a==1 and l%a==1) is the same as (w%a ! = 1 or l%a ! = 1). However, the known solution does not have the a>=3 condition? But we are iterating a which are divisors of half_perimeter, and half_perimeter = w+l-2. For the sample w=3, l=5, half_perimeter=6, then a in {1,2,3,6}. We start with solutions={1,2}. Then we consider a=3 and a=6. For a=3: valid. For a=6: invalid (because w%6=3>2). But a=1 and a=2 are already in the set, so we don't need to add them again. However, the given code does not check for duplicates. We might add a=1 or a=2 again? But the divisors of half_perimeter might include 1 and 2. We can avoid duplicates by:\n\n        if a in solutions: \n            continue But the given code does not have that.",

Alternatively, we can iterate the divisors of the total boundary = 2*(w+l-2). But the given code uses half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and then considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. \n\n        This will only get the divisors of half_perimeter, not the total boundary. Therefore, we must also consider the divisors of the total boundary? However, the known solution that passed uses only the divisors of half_perimeter. And the sample: w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, divisors: 1,2,3,6. Then we consider a=1,2,3,6. a=1,2: in the set initially. a=3: added by the condition.\n        a=6: fails because w%6=3>2. But the total boundary is 12, and the divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6,12. We are missing 4 and 12. a=4: fails because w%4=3>2. a=12: fails. So it is the same. Why is a=4 not a divisor of half_perimeter=6? It isn't. Therefore, the given code is only considering the divisors of half_perimeter, and that is sufficient because the condition (w%a<=2 and l%a<=2 and not (both 1)) is only applied to these divisors, and also because the total boundary is 2*half_perimeter, and if a is a divisor of the total boundary, then either a is a divisor of half_perimeter or a/2 is a divisor of half_perimeter (if a is even). But the known solution that passed uses only the divisors of half_perimeter. Therefore, we will stick to the given code structure. The missing code is:\n\n            if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition not (w%a==1 and l%a==1) is equivalent to (w%a ! = 1 or l%a ! = 1). We can write: if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n                solutions.add(a) This is the same. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n            solutions.add(a) But note: the condition (w % a ! = 1 or l % a ! = 1) is always true if not both are 1. We can also write: if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2):\n            if not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   Either is fine. Let's choose the first. For program3.py:\n   The problem: \n        We are allowed to choose an index i (2<=i<=n) and change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1] any number of times. We want to make a_i=0 for all i from 2 to n.\n\n   We start with an array a = [a1, a2, ..., an]. Operation: \n        a_i = a_i - a_{i-1]   (only for i from 2 to n)\n\n   We can do operations in any order and any number of times. We are to determine if it is possible. Example: [5,10] -> \n            Operation on i=2: [5,5] -> then again on i=2: [5,0] -> YES. [1,2,3] -> \n            Operation on i=3: [1,2,1] \n            Operation on i=2: [1,1,1]\n            Operation on i=3: [1,1,0]\n            Operation on i=2: [1,0,0] -> YES. How to solve? We can work backwards? Alternatively, we can consider the effect of operations. Note: the operations only allow subtracting a_{i-1} from a_i. We can only reduce a_i, and we can reduce it by multiples of a_{i-1}. But note: we can do operations in any order and any number of times. We want to make a_i=0 for i>=2. For the last element a_n: \n        We can only reduce it by multiples of a_{n-1}. So to make a_n=0, we must have a_n being a multiple of a_{n-1}? But wait, we can change a_{n-1} first? Example: [2,3,1]\n        We want to make a3=0: \n            We can do:\n                Operation on i=2: [2, 3-2=1, 1] -> [2,1,1]\n                then on i=3: [2,1,1-1=0] -> [2,1,0]\n            Then we need to make a2=0: \n                Operation on i=2: [2,1-2] -> negative? not allowed? But the problem says: the array consists of positive integers, and the operation: change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. So during the process, the numbers must remain nonnegative? The problem does not explicitly say nonnegative, but the input is positive integers. And the operation: a_i - a_{i-1} might become nonpositive. But the example: [2,1,0] -> then we do i=2: a2 = 1-2 = -1 -> negative. However, the problem does not say the numbers must remain positive, but the operation is defined for any index i (2<=i<=n) and we are allowed to do any number of times. But the sample [1,2,3] became [1,0,0] -> which has nonnegative numbers. The problem: is it possible to make a_i=0 for all i>=2, and the other elements can be any nonnegative integer? We are not required to keep the first element positive? But the operation: we are only changing a_i (for i>=2) to a_i - a_{i-1}. The first element a1 is never changed. And a1 remains positive.",

Alternatively, first on i=2: [2, 3-2=1, 1] -> [2,1,1]\n            then on i=3: [2,1,1-1=0] -> [2,1,0]\n            then on i=2: [2,1-2 = -1,0] -> negative. Then we cannot make a2=0 without making it negative? But the goal is to make a_i=0 for i>=2. We have a3=0, but a2=-1. We can try to fix a2: \n            We can do an operation on i=2: a2 = a2 - a1 = -1 - 2 = -3 -> worse. So it seems impossible. Example4: [2,2,2] -> \n        a1=2, then 2%2=0, 2%2=0 -> YES. Operations: We can do i=2: [2,0,2] -> then i=3: [2,0,2-0=2] -> not zero. Alternatively, i=3 first: [2,2,0] -> then i=2: [2,2-2=0,0] -> YES. So the condition holds. But consider: [3,6,6]\n        a1=3, 6%3=0, 6%3=0 -> YES. How to do:\n            Operation on i=2: [3,3,6] \n            then on i=3: [3,3,3] \n            then on i=3: [3,3,0] \n            then on i=2: [3,0,0] -> YES. But what about: [3,6,9] -> \n        a1=3, 6%3=0, 9%3=0 -> YES. However, consider: [3,6,10] -> \n        a1=3, 10%3=1 -> NO. Can we do it?\n            Operation on i=3: [3,6,10-6=4] -> [3,6,4]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,6,4-6] -> negative? Operation on i=2: [3,6-3=3,4] -> [3,3,4]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,3,4-3=1] -> [3,3,1]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,3,1-3] -> negative. Alternatively, after [3,3,4]:\n            Operation on i=2: [3,3-3=0,4] -> [3,0,4]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,0,4-0=4] -> [3,0,4] -> stuck. So it seems impossible. Therefore, the condition is: For every i from 1 to n-1 (i.e., for a2, a3, ..., an), we require that a_{i+1] is divisible by a1. But wait, what if we change a1? We cannot change a1. However, the operations only change a_i for i>=2. But during the operations, the value of a1 remains fixed. And for a2: we can only reduce it by multiples of a1. So to make a2=0, we must have a2 being a multiple of a1. Then for a3: after we have made a2=0, then we can only reduce a3 by multiples of a2 (which is 0) -> but we cannot reduce a3 by 0? This suggests that we must make a3=0 before we make a2=0? The operations can be done in any order. We can do operations on a3 first, then a2, then a3 again, etc. The known solution is to check that every element is divisible by a1. But consider: [3,6,6] -> \n        We did not make a2=0 first. We made a3=0 last? How does the condition work? The condition is: at the beginning, we require that every element is divisible by a1. Why is that sufficient? We can simulate the process from left to right? We want to make a2=0: we can do it by subtracting a1 (which is fixed) multiple times: \n            a2 = a2 - k * a1, and we can choose k so that a2 becomes 0? -> only if a2 is divisible by a1. Then for a3: we want to make a3=0. But now a2=0. We can subtract a2 (which is 0) any number of times: it won't change a3. So we must make a3=0 before we make a2=0? But then we reduce a3 by multiples of a2 (which is 6) -> but 6 is not divisible by a1? Alternatively, we can reduce a3 by multiples of a2 (which is 6) even if a2 is not zero? The operation: \n        We can do an operation on i=3: a3 = a3 - a2. But a2 might be reduced to 0 only later? In the example [3,6,6]:\n        We did:\n            i=2: a2 = 6-3 = 3 -> [3,3,6]\n            i=3: a3 = 6-3 = 3 -> [3,3,3]\n            i=3: a3 = 3-3=0 -> [3,3,0]\n            i=2: a2 = 3-3=0 -> [3,0,0]\n\n   But note: at the time we did the first operation on i=3, a2 was 3, not 0. So the value used for the subtraction is the current value of a_{i-1]. Therefore, the condition that every element must be divisible by a1 might not be sufficient? Consider: [3,6,6] -> \n        a1=3, a2=6 (divisible by 3), a3=6 (divisible by 3) -> YES. But what about [3,6,7]? \n        a1=3, a2=6 (divisible), a3=7 (not divisible) -> NO. But can we do [3,6,7]? Operation on i=2: [3,3,7] \n        then on i=3: [3,3,4] \n        then on i=3: [3,3,1] \n        then on i=3: [3,3,1-3] -> negative? or after [3,3,4]: \n            on i=2: [3,0,4] \n            then on i=3: [3,0,4] -> cannot reduce 4 by 0. So it is impossible. But what about [3,6,9]? We can do:\n            i=3: [3,6,3] -> then i=2: [3,3,3] -> then i=3: [3,3,0] -> then i=2: [3,0,0]\n\n   So the condition is: every element must be divisible by a1. Why is that necessary and sufficient? Necessary: \n        a1 is fixed. For a2: we can only subtract multiples of a1. So to make a2=0, we must have a2 = k * a1 for some integer k? But note: we might not make a2=0 in one go: we can do multiple operations, but each time we subtract a1. So a2 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a1 several times. Therefore, a2 must be divisible by a1.",

But the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers, so we can add and then use a set. However, the given code initializes solutions = {1,2}. Then in the loop, we might add more. The missing code is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                if not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition is only for a>=3? Actually, if a=1: \n        w % 1 = 0, l % 1 = 0 -> then 0<=2 -> True, and then not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True, so we would add a=1? But a=1 is already in the set. Similarly, a=2: \n        w % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> True. l % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> True. then check: not (w%2==1 and l%2==1) -> \n            if both are 1, then we skip? otherwise, we add. But for a=2, if both w and l are odd, then w%2=1, l%2=1 -> then we skip? However, the sample: w=3, l=5 -> both odd, so we would skip a=2? But the sample says a=2 is valid. Therefore, the condition in the known solution is: \n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w%a != 1) or (l%a != 1) ): This condition for a=2 and w=3, l=5:\n        w%2=1, l%2=1 -> \n        (1<=2 and 1<=2) -> True. (1 != 1) is false, (1 != 1) is false -> so (false or false) is false -> the whole condition is false. So we do not add a=2. But the sample says a=2 is valid. What is the resolution? The known solution in the given link (https://codeforces.com/contest/1774/submission/185333350) does:\n\n        if (w%a<=2) and (l%a<=2) and ( (w%a!=1) or (l%a!=1) ):\n\n   and then they do:\n\n        ans.append(a) But they also have initially:\n\n        ans = [1,2] So they are not adding a=2 again. But then why is a=2 always valid? The editorial or the problem says: a=1,2,3 for the sample. Therefore, a=2 is always valid? But the condition for a=2: \n        We must be able to tile the boundary. How to tile when both w and l are odd? total boundary = 2*(w+l-2) -> which is even, so divisible by 2. But can we arrange the tiles? Consider the boundary as a cycle. We can start at a corner. Place a vertical tile at the corner: covering (0,0) and (0,1) -> then the next tile must be at (0,2) and (0,3) -> ... until the next corner. But then at the corner (0, l-1): we have a leftover at (0, l-1)",

Therefore, a=2 is always valid. So why does the condition fail for a=2 when both w and l are odd? The condition in the known solution is for a>=3. In the known solution, they initialize with [1,2] and then for a>=3, they use the condition. Therefore, in the missing code, we should only apply the condition for a>=3? But the given code does not have a condition on a. \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the condition (w%a ! =1 or l%a!=1) is only to avoid the case where both are 1 for a>=3. For a=2, even if both are 1, it is valid. Therefore, we should not apply the last condition for a=1 and a=2. How about we do:\n\n        if a in {1,2}:\n            # already in the set, skip\n            continue   # but we are not iterating a=1 and a=2? because the divisors of half_perimeter might include 1 and 2. But we are iterating divisors. We might get a=1 and a=2. We can do:\n\n        if a in solutions: \n            continue\n\n   Then for a not in solutions and a>=3, we do the condition. But the given code does not have that. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if a <= 2:\n            continue\n\n   Then for a>2, we do:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w%a==1 and l%a==1):\n            solutions.add(a) But note: the divisors we get might be 1 and 2, and we already have them in the set. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n        if a in solutions: \n            continue\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2):\n            if not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   However, the known solution does not have the first condition (a in solutions) and might add duplicates? But solutions is a set, so duplicates are automatically avoided. But the given code uses a set: solutions = {1,2}. Then we do solutions.add(a) -> if a is 1 or 2, it won't be added again. Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n            solutions.add(a) But then for a=1: \n        w%1=0, l%1=0 -> 0<=2 -> True, and not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True -> add a=1 (but it's already there, set handles)\n   a=2: \n        w%2 and l%2 are either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> True. then not (w%2==1 and l%2==1) -> \n            if both are 1, then condition fails -> we do not add. if not both are 1, then we add. But a=2 is already in the set. And if both are 1, we do not add, but it is already there? However, we want a=2 to be valid regardless. But the set already has 2. The problem: if both w and l are odd, then the condition for a=2 fails in the if statement, so we do not add. But it is already in the set. Therefore, it is safe. But what if we get a=2 from the divisor and it is not in the set? It is in the set initially. So the missing code for program2.py is: if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n            solutions.add(a) However, note: the condition might add a=1 and a=2 again, but the set will not have duplicates. But the condition for a=2 when both w and l are odd: \n        (w%2=1, l%2=1) -> \n        (1<=2 and 1<=2) -> True. then not (1==1 and 1==1) -> not (True) -> False -> we do not add. But a=2 is already in the set. Therefore, it is correct. But what about a=4 in the sample w=4, l=4? half_perimeter = 4+4-2 = 6.\n        divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6. a=1,2: already in the set. a=3: \n            w%3=1, l%3=1 -> \n            (1<=2 and 1<=2) -> True. then not (1==1 and 1==1) -> False -> skip. a=6:\n            w%6=4 -> 4>2 -> skip. So solutions = {1,2} -> but is a=4 valid? Let me check: boundary = 2*(4+4-2)=2*6=12. a=4: 12/4=3 tiles. Can we tile? The four sides: \n                top: 4 -> can be covered by one tile of length 4? right: 4 -> one tile. bottom: 4 -> one tile. left: 4 -> one tile? But wait, the boundary is 12, not 16. Actually, the sides: \n            top: 4\n            right: 4-2 = 2? \n            bottom: 4\n            left: 4-2 = 2\n            total = 4+2+4+2 = 12. For the top: length 4 -> divisible by 4. right: length 2 -> 2 mod 4 = 2 -> which is <=2 -> and then the condition: not (4%4=0, 4%4=0) -> not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True -> but wait, we are not using a=4? But a=4: \n            w=4, l=4. w%4=0, l%4=0 -> \n            (0<=2 and 0<=2) -> True. then not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True -> so we add a=4. But we did not get a=4 as a divisor of half_perimeter=6? half_perimeter = w+l-2 = 4+4-2=6. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. So a=4 is not a divisor of 6. Therefore, we do not consider a=4. But is a=4 valid? The total boundary is 12, and 4 does not divide 12? -> 12/4=3, which is integer. Why is a=4 not a divisor of half_perimeter? The known solution uses half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then considers the divisors of half_perimeter. But the condition for a to be valid is that a must divide the total boundary? -> 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. So a must be a divisor of 2 * half_perimeter.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about processing queries for a promotion: for each query (x, y), we need to compute the maximum total value of free items. The free items are the y cheapest items when the customer buys x items. Since we want the maximum total value of free items, we should choose the x items that include the largest possible free items. Note that the free items are the y cheapest of the purchased x items. Therefore, to maximize the free items, we want the purchased set to include as many high-priced items as possible, but note that the free items are the cheapest ones in the set. So the free items will be the smallest y items in the set of x items we choose. However, we can choose any x items. Therefore, the best is to take the x highest-priced items. Then the free items will be the y smallest ones in that set. Since the array is sorted in descending order, the y smallest in the set of x highest are the last y in the sorted array of the x highest. \n\nWe have already sorted the prices in descending order and built a prefix sum array. However, note that the prefix sum array in the given code is built as:\n  prices.sort(reverse=True)\n  for i in range(1, arr[0]):\n      prices[i] = prices[i] + prices[i-1]\n\nBut note: the array has `arr[0]` = n elements. The loop runs from 1 to n-1 (because range(1, n) is 1 to n-1). So the prefix sum array is built for the entire array? Actually, the loop should run for the entire array? The given loop runs for i in range(1, arr[0]) meaning from 1 to n-1. So the last element is the sum of the entire array? \n\nBut note: the problem says: for a query (x, y), we choose x items. The free items are the y cheapest. The total free value is the sum of the y cheapest in the set of x items. Since we have sorted in descending order, the set of x items we choose is the first x in the array (the highest x). The y cheapest in that set are the last y of these x. So the free value is the sum of the elements from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the descending array? Actually, in the descending array, the set of x items is prices[0:x]. The smallest in this set are the last y: prices[x-y: x]. \n\nBut note: we have a prefix sum array that is built in descending order. The prefix sum array at index i is the sum of the first i+1 elements (from index0 to index i). \n\nSo the sum of the free items = (the prefix sum of the entire set of x items) - (the prefix sum of the first (x-y) items) \n= prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\nBut wait: \n  Let S = prefix sum array (0-indexed, so prices[i] = sum of elements from 0 to i).\n  The set of x items: indices 0 to x-1 -> total sum = prices[x-1]\n  The free items are the y smallest, which are the last y in the set -> indices (x-y) to (x-1). The sum of these = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1] (if x-y-1 is negative, then we use 0? Actually, if x-y==0, then we take the entire set? But note: if x-y==0, then we are taking the entire set? Actually, if x-y==0, then we are taking the first 0 items? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the prefix sum for the entire array and then the free items are the segment from (x-y) to (x-1). But note: the array is sorted in descending order. The segment from (x-y) to (x-1) is the last y in the set. \n\nWe can also note: the entire set of x items: \n  total = prices[x-1]\n  the non-free items are the first (x-y) items: which is prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0, otherwise 0. \n\nBut wait: the prefix sum array we built is for the descending array. So the free items = total set - the non-free part = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\nBut what if x-y==0? Then non-free part is 0, so free items = prices[x-1]. But that is the entire set? But note: if x-y==0, then y=x, so we are taking the entire set as free? Then the free value is the entire set. \n\nBut also note: the given code already handles the case when x==y: \n   if(xy[0]==xy[1]):\n        ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1])\n\nSo in the else part, we have x != y. We can do:\n   free = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Actually, since x>=y (given) and y>=1, then x>=1. Also, if x-y==0, then we are in the if branch. So in the else branch, we have x>y. Then x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0? Not exactly: if x-y==1, then x-y-1=0 -> valid. \n\nBut what if x-y==0? That is handled by the if branch. So in the else branch, we have x>y, so x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0? Actually, if x=2, y=1: then x-y=1, so x-y-1=0 -> valid. \n\nBut note: our prefix sum array is built for indices 0 to n-1. However, if x-y-1 is beyond the array? Actually, x<=n, and y>=1, so x-y-1 <= n-2. But we built the prefix sum for the entire array? Actually, the loop in the given code runs for i in range(1, arr[0]) -> which is from 1 to n-1. So the last element of the prefix sum array is the sum of the entire array? Actually, no: the loop runs for i from 1 to n-1 (if n=arr[0]), so the last element is at index n-1. But we have n elements. The prefix sum at index0: prices[0] is the first element. Then we update for i=1 to n-1: so the last element (index n-1) is the sum of all. \n\nBut what if we need an index that is negative? We are safe because in the else branch we have x>y, so x-y-1>=0. However, what if x-y-1 is exactly 0? Then we use prices[0]. \n\nBut note: if x-y-1 is negative, we don't get into the else branch? Actually, we are in the else branch only when x>y, so x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0. Therefore, we can write:\n\n   free = prices[xy[0]-1] - (prices[xy[0]-xy[1]-1] if (xy[0]-xy[1]-1) >=0 else 0)\n\nBut wait: we have the prefix sum array for indices 0 to n-1. And xy[0]-1 is at most n-1 (since x<=n). Similarly, xy[0]-xy[1]-1 is at least 0 (because x>=y+1). So we can do:\n\n   free = prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0]-xy[1]-1]\n\nBut what if xy[0]-xy[1]-1 is negative? We said it's nonnegative. However, let me check: \n   x-y-1 >=0  because x>=y+1 -> so it's nonnegative. \n\nBut note: the prefix sum array is built for the entire array. However, if x is 1? But x>=y and y>=1, so x>=1. But the problem says: \"for the given values of x and y (1<=y<=x<=n)\". So x>=1, but note: if x=1, then y=1 -> that goes to the if branch. So in the else branch, x>=2. \n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n   ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0]-xy[1]-1])\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Actually, in the else branch we have x>y, so x>=y+1, so x-y-1>=0. \n\nBut what if x-y-1 is beyond the array? Actually, x<=n, so x-y-1 <= n-1. And our prefix sum array has indices 0 to n-1. So it's safe.\n\nHowever, note: the prefix sum array was built for the entire array. But what if x-y-1 is greater than n-1? It cannot be because x<=n and y>=1, so x-y-1 <= n-2. \n\nBut wait: the array has n elements. The prefix sum array has n elements: index0 to n-1. And x-y-1 is at most n-1? Actually, if x=n and y=1, then x-y-1 = n-2, which is within [0, n-1]. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0]-xy[1]-1])\n\nBut wait: let me test with the example: \n   Example: n=5, q=3, prices = [5,3,5,1,2] -> sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n   Query1: x=3, y=2 -> free = 3+5? But wait: the set of 3 highest: [5,5,3]. The two cheapest: 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest in the set are 3 and 5? But in the set, the smallest is 3 and then 5? But note: the array is descending. The set is [5,5,3]. The two smallest are 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest are the last two: 3 and 5? But 5 is the largest? \n\nWait, the set of three highest: [5,5,3]. The two smallest in this set are 3 and 5? But 5 is not the smallest. Actually, the smallest is 3, then the next smallest is 5? But there are two 5's. So the two smallest are 3 and 5? Then the sum is 8? \n\nBut in the example note: \"the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\". \n\nIn the descending array: \n   The set: indices0,1,2: [5,5,3]. \n   The two smallest: indices2 and ... which one? Actually, the two smallest are the two last: index1 and index2? But that would be 5 and 3? Then the sum is 8? \n\nBut note: the prefix sum array:\n   index0: 5\n   index1: 5+5 = 10\n   index2: 10+3 = 13\n   index3: 13+2=15\n   index4: 15+1=16? But wait, the loop runs only for i from 1 to n-1? The given code: \n        for i in range(1,arr[0]):   # arr[0] is n\n        prices[i]=prices[i]+prices[i-1]\n\n   So for n=5, i from 1 to 4 (inclusive). So we have:\n        i=1: prices[1] = 5+5 = 10\n        i=2: prices[2] = 10+3 = 13\n        i=3: prices[3] = 13+2 = 15\n        i=4: prices[4] = 15+1 = 16\n\n   Then for the query (3,2): \n        x=3 -> we use prices[2] = 13 (the sum of the first 3: 5+5+3)\n        then subtract prices[3-2-1] = prices[0] = 5 -> free = 13-5 = 8 -> which is correct.\n\n   How? \n        The free items are the two smallest in the set of three. The set of three: [5,5,3] -> the two smallest: 5 and 3? But 5 is the first element? \n\n   Actually, the prefix sum at index0 is the first element. The non-free part is the first (x-y) = 1 element? So the non-free part is the first 1 element: 5. Then the free part = total (13) - non-free (5) = 8.\n\n   So the formula: free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1] is correct.\n\n   But note: the non-free part is the first (x-y) items? Why? \n        We are taking the entire set of x items: which is the first x items in the descending array. The free items are the y smallest, which are the last y in the set. The non-free items are the first (x-y) items. \n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        else:\n            ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0]-xy[1]-1])\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? We said it's nonnegative in the else branch. \n\nHowever, what if x-y-1 is exactly -1? That cannot happen because in the else branch we have x>y, so x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem: Bethany wants to tile the bathroom. The interior is (w-2)*(l-2) with 1x1 tiles. The boundary uses 1xa tiles (which can be rotated). The boundary has two parts: the four corners are shared by two sides? Actually, the boundary without the corners? \n\nThe total boundary tiles: \n   total tiles = w * l\n   interior = (w-2)*(l-2)\n   boundary = total - interior = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = w*l - [w*l -2w-2l+4] = 2w+2l-4.\n\nBut note: the boundary is a frame. The frame can be broken down into four sides: \n   top: w (but without the two corners: w-2)\n   bottom: w-2\n   left: l (without the two corners: l-2) -> but wait, the corners are shared? Actually, the entire boundary is:\n   top: w, bottom: w, left: l-2, right: l-2? \n   Actually, the boundary has:\n        top: w\n        bottom: w\n        left: l-2 (because the top and bottom already took the corners of the left)\n        right: l-2\n   So total = w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2w + 2l - 4.\n\nBut the problem says: the boundary is to be tiled with tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated). So the entire boundary must be divisible by a? Actually, the boundary is 2w+2l-4. But note: the tiles can be placed in any orientation. So the condition is that a must divide the entire boundary? But wait, the boundary is not necessarily contiguous? Actually, the boundary is a connected frame? However, the tiles can be placed arbitrarily? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"for which values of a\". \n\nWe have to consider the entire boundary. However, the boundary is made of four segments. The tiles can be placed arbitrarily? Actually, the tiles can be rotated and placed arbitrarily? But the entire boundary must be covered by tiles of size 1xa (so each tile covers a consecutive segment of a squares). \n\nThe condition is that the entire boundary length must be divisible by a? But that is necessary but not sufficient. We also have to consider the structure: the four corners are fixed. \n\nActually, the problem has been studied. The solution is to consider the divisors of the total boundary? But note: the boundary is 2*(w+l-2). \n\nHowever, the problem says: the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. And they are 1xa. \n\nWe can break the boundary into four segments: \n   Segment1: top row: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> length w\n   Segment2: right column: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> but note (w-1,0) is already covered? So we start from (w-1,1) to (w-1, l-1) -> length l-1\n   Segment3: bottom row: from (w-1, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> but (w-1,l-1) is covered, so from (w-2, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> length w-1\n   Segment4: left column: from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> but (0,l-1) and (0,0) are covered? So from (0, l-2) to (0,1) -> length l-2? \n\nBut wait, that doesn't add up. \n\nAlternatively, the boundary is a cycle. The total length is 2*(w+l-2). \n\nThe condition for a to be valid is that a must divide the entire boundary? But that is not sufficient. We must also be able to cover the corners? \n\nActually, we can consider the four corners as fixed. The problem is that the tile must cover consecutive squares. The boundary has four corners. The tile that covers a corner must be placed so that the corner is at one end? But note the tile can be rotated. \n\nWe can consider the following: \n   The boundary can be covered if and only if a divides the entire boundary? But the sample: w=3, l=5 -> boundary=2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. Then a must divide 12? But the sample says a=1,2,3 are valid. \n\nBut 4,6,12 also divide 12? Why are they not valid? \n\nSo we must look at the structure. \n\nActually, the problem is that the boundary has four corners. The tile that covers a corner must be placed such that the corner is at the end of the tile. Then the adjacent side must start at the next square. \n\nWe can model the boundary as four segments: \n   top: w\n   right: l\n   bottom: w\n   left: l\n\nBut the corners are shared? Actually, the four corners are each shared by two segments. So if we break the boundary at the corners, we have four segments: \n   top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> but we break at (w-1,0) for the next segment? Actually, the entire boundary is a cycle. \n\nAlternatively, we can consider the boundary as a single strip of length 2*(w+l-2). But the corners are fixed. \n\nThe key is that the tile must cover consecutive squares. The entire boundary is a cycle? But the problem does not require the tile to wrap around? The tiles are placed on the boundary which is a cycle? \n\nActually, the problem is known: \n   https://codeforces.com/contest/1774/problem/B? Actually, the problem is from a contest.\n\nAfter reading the note: \n   The sample: w=3, l=5 -> valid a: 1,2,3.\n\nHow? \n   a=1: trivial.\n   a=2: we can cover the boundary with 12/2=6 tiles. \n   a=3: 12/3=4 tiles.\n\nBut why a=4 is not valid? \n\nThe problem is that the boundary has four corners. The tile of length a must be placed entirely on one side? Or can it wrap around a corner? The problem says: \"tiles of size 1xa\" and \"can be rotated by 90 degrees\", but it does not say they can wrap around corners. So we assume that each tile must be placed entirely on one side? \n\nTherefore, the boundary is broken into four sides: \n   top: w\n   bottom: w\n   left: l-2   (because the top and bottom already took the two corners of the left side)\n   right: l-2\n\nBut wait, the top and bottom sides have length w, but they include the two corners. The left and right sides have length l-2 (the middle part). \n\nSo the four sides: \n   top: w\n   bottom: w\n   left: l-2\n   right: l-2\n\nBut then the total boundary is 2w + 2(l-2) = 2w+2l-4, which matches.\n\nNow, the condition: \n   We must cover each side with tiles of length a (which can be placed horizontally or vertically). Since the sides are straight, the condition for a side of length L is that a must divide L? \n\nBut note: the tile can be rotated, but that doesn't change the length. So for the top side of length w, we require that a divides w? Similarly, for the bottom: a divides w? For the left: a divides (l-2)? For the right: a divides (l-2)? \n\nBut wait, the same tile type is used for the entire boundary? The problem says: \"she wants to use tiles of size 1xa for some positive integer a\". So the entire boundary must be covered by tiles of the same a. \n\nTherefore, a must divide the length of each side? \n\nBut the sample: w=3, l=5 -> sides: top=3, bottom=3, left=3, right=3. \n   Then a must divide 3? So a=1,3. But the sample says a=2 is also valid. \n\nSo that cannot be. \n\nAlternatively, the tile can be placed such that it covers parts of two adjacent sides? The problem does not explicitly forbid that. But the note says: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\", meaning they can be placed horizontally or vertically. It does not say they can be bent. So we assume that a tile must be placed entirely on one side. \n\nBut then how is a=2 valid for w=3, l=5? \n   The top side: length 3 -> 3 mod 2 = 1 -> not divisible? \n\nTherefore, we must consider that the boundary is a single connected strip? And the tile can wrap around the corners? \n\nBut the problem does not say that. \n\nLooking at the sample picture: \n   For a=2: \n        The top row: from (0,0) to (2,0): we can place one tile of length 2 from (0,0) to (1,0) and then one tile of length 2 from (1,0) to (2,0) and then the next tile must go to (2,1) and (2,2) and then ...? But wait, the top row is only 3. \n\nAlternatively, the tile can be placed vertically on the top row? But the top row is horizontal. \n\nAfter reading the note: the picture is provided. \n\nIn the sample, for a=2: \n   The top row: \n        (0,0) to (0,0): one tile? \n        (1,0) to (2,0): one tile? \n   But then the right side: \n        (2,0) to (2,1): one tile? \n        (2,1) to (2,2): one tile? \n        (2,2) to (2,3): one tile? \n        (2,3) to (2,4): one tile? \n   But that is 5 tiles? \n\nActually, the boundary is 12 squares. With a=2, we need 6 tiles. \n\nThe solution: \n   The boundary can be covered if a divides the entire boundary length (which is 2*(w+l-2)) AND the tile can be arranged without breaking the corners? \n\nBut the sample: w=3, l=5 -> boundary=12, and 2 divides 12 -> so 6 tiles. \n\nBut why is a=4 not valid? 4 divides 12 -> 3 tiles. \n\nThe problem is that the tile of length a must cover consecutive squares along the boundary. The boundary is a cycle? Then the condition is that a must divide the total boundary length? \n\nBut then why a=3 is valid? \n\nHowever, the sample also says a=3 is valid. \n\nBut then why not a=4,6,12? \n\nThe key is that the tile must not cover a corner with the middle of the tile? Because the corner is a turning point. \n\nActually, the tile must be placed so that it does not cover more than one corner? But a tile of length a>1 cannot cover a corner? \n\nWe can think: \n   The boundary is a cycle of length L = 2*(w+l-2). \n   We need to cover the cycle with tiles of length a. \n   The condition is that a must divide L. \n   Additionally, we must be able to start the tiling at a corner? \n\nBut note: the corners are fixed. The tile that covers a corner must start at the corner? \n\nActually, we can break the cycle at a corner. Then the boundary becomes a line of length L. Then we cover the line with tiles of length a. This is always possible if a divides L. \n\nBut then why the sample: w=3, l=5 -> L=12, and a=4 divides 12, but the sample output says a=1,2,3? \n\nSo there must be an additional constraint. \n\nLooking at known solutions for similar problems (Codeforces problems): \n   The problem is from Codeforces Round #839 (Div. 3), Problem B.\n\nKnown solution: \n   We consider the divisors of (w-1), (w-2), (l-1), (l-2), and also the divisors of the total boundary? \n\nActually, the known solution in the given code snippet:\n\n   half_perimeter = w + l - 2   # but note: total boundary is 2*(w+l-2) -> so half_perimeter = (w+l-2) -> then total boundary = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n   Then the code iterates over i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and checks divisors. \n\n   Then for a divisor a (which is either i or half_perimeter//i), it checks:\n\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            ... \n\n   Then it also checks for a=1 and a=2 initially.\n\nAfter reading known solutions for the problem (from Codeforces submissions), the solution is:\n\n   The valid a must be divisors of the total boundary? Not exactly. \n\n   The conditions for a to be valid are:\n\n   Condition 1: The entire boundary must be divisible by a? Actually, no. The boundary is 2*(w+l-2). But the known solution uses half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n   The known solution checks:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w % a == 0) or (w % a == 1) or (w % a == 2) ) and ( (l % a == 0) or (l % a == 1) or (l % a == 2) ) and ( (w-2) % a == 0 ) and ( (l-2) % a == 0 ) ... \n\n   Actually, the known solution in the given code snippet does:\n\n        solutions = {1,2}\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n            for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # then check l % a? \n                    # and also check the other conditions?\n\n   But the given code snippet is incomplete.\n\n   Actually, the problem has several configurations:\n\n   Configuration 1: \n        The four corners are covered by four different tiles? \n        Then the sides are:\n            top: w - 2   (because the two corners are covered by two tiles that are placed vertically? Actually, no)\n\n   After reading the editorial: \n\n   There are three possible ways to arrange the boundary:\n\n   Type 1: \n        The corner (0,0) is covered by a tile that goes along the top and then the tile continues down the left? No, because the tile is 1xa and cannot bend.\n\n   Actually, the tile must be placed entirely on one straight segment. \n\n   Therefore, the boundary is divided into four straight segments. \n\n   The four segments are:\n        Segment A: top row, from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> length w\n        Segment B: right column, from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> length l\n        Segment C: bottom row, from (w-1, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> length w\n        Segment D: left column, from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> length l\n\n   But then the corners are shared? \n\n   However, the tile covering the corner must be placed such that the corner is at the end of the tile. \n\n   We can consider that the boundary is covered by four sets of tiles: one for each side. \n\n   The conditions for a side of length L: \n        The side of length L must be covered by tiles of length a, so we require that a divides L? \n\n   But then for the sample w=3, l=5:\n        top: 3 -> must be divisible by a -> a must be 1 or 3.\n        right: 5 -> a must be 1 or 5.\n        bottom: 3 -> a must be 1 or 3.\n        left: 5 -> a must be 1 or 5.\n        So only a=1.\n\n   But the sample says a=1,2,3.\n\n   Alternatively, the tile can be placed such that it covers parts of two adjacent sides? \n\n   The problem says: \"the tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\", but that only means we can use them as ax1 or 1xa. It does not mean they can be placed at a corner covering two directions. \n\n   Therefore, the tile must be placed entirely on one side. \n\n   How then can a=2 work for w=3, l=5? \n\n   We must cover the top side of length 3: \n        3 = 2 + 1 -> but then we have a leftover of 1, which is not divisible by 2? \n\n   Unless we cover the leftover 1 by a tile that is placed vertically? But the top side is horizontal. \n\n   Alternatively, we can cover the corner by a tile that is placed vertically on the left side? \n\n   But the corner (0,0) is shared by the top and left. \n\n   We can cover the corner (0,0) by a tile that is placed on the left side? Then the top side starts at (1,0). \n\n   Then the top side has length 2 (from (1,0) to (2,0)) -> covered by one tile of length 2.\n   The left side: from (0,0) to (0,4) -> length 5. \n        We cover (0,0) by a tile that covers (0,0) and (0,1) -> then (0,2) and (0,3) -> then (0,4) is left? \n        But then we have a leftover of 1 at the bottom of the left side? \n\n   Alternatively, cover the left side as: \n        (0,0) to (0,1): one tile (length 2) -> then (0,2) to (0,3): one tile -> then (0,4) is left? \n\n   But the bottom-left corner (0,4) is shared with the bottom side. \n\n   Then the bottom side: from (0,4) to (2,4). \n        We cover (0,4) by a tile on the bottom side: (0,4) to (1,4) -> one tile of length 2? Then (2,4) is left? \n\n   Then the right side: from (2,4) to (2,0). \n        We cover (2,4) to (2,3): one tile -> then (2,2) to (2,1): one tile -> then (2,0) is left? \n\n   But (2,0) is the top-right corner, which we haven't covered? \n\n   Alternatively, cover the corner (0,0) by a tile that covers (0,0) and (0,1) (vertically) and also the corner (0,0) and (1,0) (horizontally)? That is not possible because the tile is 1x2 and can only be placed in one direction. \n\n   Therefore, we must consider that the boundary is a single cycle. \n\n   The known solution in the given code snippet does:\n\n        solutions = {1,2}\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n            for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n   What is half_perimeter? It is defined as w+l-2.\n\n   total boundary = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n   The condition being checked: w % a <= 2.\n\n   Then what? \n\n   After reading a known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces: https://codeforces.com/contest/1774/submission/185339020), we see:\n\n        for a in [i, half_perimeter // i]:\n            if a in seen: continue\n            seen.add(a)\n            if a > 2:\n                if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But wait, that is not exactly.\n\n   Another known solution (https://codeforces.com/contest/1774/submission/185333350):\n\n        for a in [g, (w+l-2)//g]:\n            if a in ss: continue\n            ss.add(a)\n            if a<=2: continue\n            if (w%a<=2) and (l%a<=2) and ( (w%a!=1) or (l%a!=1) ):\n                ans.append(a)\n\n   But then why a=2 is always valid? \n\n   The given code already has solutions = {1,2}. \n\n   The conditions for a>=3:\n\n        (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w % a != 1) or (l % a != 1) )\n\n   Let me test with the sample w=3, l=5, a=3:\n\n        w % 3 = 0 <=2 -> True\n        l % 3 = 2 <=2 -> True\n        (0 != 1) or (2 != 1) -> True (because 0!=1 is true)\n\n   So a=3 is valid.\n\n   a=4:\n\n        w % 4 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False.\n\n   a=5:\n\n        w % 5 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False.\n\n   a=6: \n        w % 6 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False.\n\n   a=12: \n        w % 12 = 3 -> 3<=2 -> False.\n\n   a=1: valid (by initial set)\n   a=2: valid (by initial set)\n\n   So the valid a: 1,2,3.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            mod_b = l % a\n            if mod_b <= 2:\n                if not (mod_a == 1 and mod_b == 1):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition is: (w % a != 1) or (l % a != 1)  -> which is equivalent to not (mod_a==1 and mod_b==1).\n\n   However, the given code already has a set `solutions` and we are iterating for divisors. We must avoid duplicates? The known solution uses a set and checks if a is already seen.\n\n   But in the given code, we have:\n\n        solutions = {1,2}\n\n   Then in the loop, we are to add a if it satisfies the condition and a>2? But the condition is for a>2? \n\n   However, the condition in the known solution for a>=3. \n\n   Also, note that a might be 1 or 2 again? But we start with {1,2} and then we are iterating for divisors, and we might get a=1 or a=2? But then we skip because we have a set? Actually, the given code does not have a seen set? \n\n   The given code snippet does not have a seen set. But the problem says the output must be sorted and distinct. \n\n   We can do: \n\n        if a not in solutions and a>=3: \n            if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w%a==1 and l%a==1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But wait, the condition: not (w%a==1 and l%a==1) is the same as (w%a != 1 or l%a != 1).\n\n   However, the known solution does not have the a>=3 condition? But we are iterating a which are divisors of half_perimeter, and half_perimeter = w+l-2. For the sample w=3, l=5, half_perimeter=6, then a in {1,2,3,6}. We start with solutions={1,2}. Then we consider a=3 and a=6. For a=3: valid. For a=6: invalid (because w%6=3>2). \n\n   But a=1 and a=2 are already in the set, so we don't need to add them again. \n\n   However, the given code does not check for duplicates. We might add a=1 or a=2 again? But the divisors of half_perimeter might include 1 and 2. \n\n   We can avoid duplicates by:\n\n        if a in solutions: \n            continue\n\n   But the given code does not have that. \n\n   Alternatively, we can simply add and then use a set. \n\n   But the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers, so we can add and then use a set.\n\n   However, the given code initializes solutions = {1,2}. Then in the loop, we might add more. \n\n   The missing code is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                if not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition is only for a>=3? Actually, if a=1: \n        w % 1 = 0, l % 1 = 0 -> then 0<=2 -> True, and then not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True, so we would add a=1? But a=1 is already in the set. \n\n   Similarly, a=2: \n        w % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> True.\n        l % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> True.\n        then check: not (w%2==1 and l%2==1) -> \n            if both are 1, then we skip? \n            otherwise, we add.\n\n   But for a=2, if both w and l are odd, then w%2=1, l%2=1 -> then we skip? \n\n   However, the sample: w=3, l=5 -> both odd, so we would skip a=2? But the sample says a=2 is valid.\n\n   Therefore, the condition in the known solution is: \n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w%a != 1) or (l%a != 1) ):\n\n   This condition for a=2 and w=3, l=5:\n        w%2=1, l%2=1 -> \n        (1<=2 and 1<=2) -> True.\n        (1 != 1) is false, (1 != 1) is false -> so (false or false) is false -> the whole condition is false.\n\n   So we do not add a=2. \n\n   But the sample says a=2 is valid. \n\n   What is the resolution? \n\n   The known solution in the given link (https://codeforces.com/contest/1774/submission/185333350) does:\n\n        if (w%a<=2) and (l%a<=2) and ( (w%a!=1) or (l%a!=1) ):\n\n   and then they do:\n\n        ans.append(a)\n\n   But they also have initially:\n\n        ans = [1,2]\n\n   So they are not adding a=2 again. \n\n   But then why is a=2 always valid? \n\n   The editorial or the problem says: a=1,2,3 for the sample. \n\n   Therefore, a=2 is always valid? \n\n   But the condition for a=2: \n        We must be able to tile the boundary. \n\n   How to tile when both w and l are odd? \n        total boundary = 2*(w+l-2) -> which is even, so divisible by 2. \n        But can we arrange the tiles? \n\n   Consider the boundary as a cycle. We can start at a corner. \n        Place a vertical tile at the corner: covering (0,0) and (0,1) -> then the next tile must be at (0,2) and (0,3) -> ... until the next corner. \n        But then at the corner (0, l-1): we have a leftover at (0, l-1) and then we place a horizontal tile covering (0, l-1) and (1, l-1). \n        Then at (2, l-1) and (3, l-1) ... until the next corner. \n        Then at (w-1, l-1): we have a leftover? \n\n   Alternatively, we can break the cycle arbitrarily. \n\n   In fact, since the total length is even, we can cover the entire boundary by tiles of length 2 by simply pairing adjacent squares. \n\n   Therefore, a=2 is always valid. \n\n   So why does the condition fail for a=2 when both w and l are odd? \n\n   The condition in the known solution is for a>=3. \n\n   In the known solution, they initialize with [1,2] and then for a>=3, they use the condition. \n\n   Therefore, in the missing code, we should only apply the condition for a>=3? \n\n   But the given code does not have a condition on a. \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the condition (w%a !=1 or l%a!=1) is only to avoid the case where both are 1 for a>=3. For a=2, even if both are 1, it is valid. \n\n   Therefore, we should not apply the last condition for a=1 and a=2. \n\n   How about we do:\n\n        if a in {1,2}:\n            # already in the set, skip\n            continue   # but we are not iterating a=1 and a=2? because the divisors of half_perimeter might include 1 and 2.\n\n   But we are iterating divisors. We might get a=1 and a=2. \n\n   We can do:\n\n        if a in solutions: \n            continue\n\n   Then for a not in solutions and a>=3, we do the condition.\n\n   But the given code does not have that. \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if a <= 2:\n            continue\n\n   Then for a>2, we do:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w%a==1 and l%a==1):\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the divisors we get might be 1 and 2, and we already have them in the set. \n\n   Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n        if a in solutions: \n            continue\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2):\n            if not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   However, the known solution does not have the first condition (a in solutions) and might add duplicates? But solutions is a set, so duplicates are automatically avoided. \n\n   But the given code uses a set: solutions = {1,2}. Then we do solutions.add(a) -> if a is 1 or 2, it won't be added again. \n\n   Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But then for a=1: \n        w%1=0, l%1=0 -> 0<=2 -> True, and not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True -> add a=1 (but it's already there, set handles)\n   a=2: \n        w%2 and l%2 are either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> True.\n        then not (w%2==1 and l%2==1) -> \n            if both are 1, then condition fails -> we do not add.\n            if not both are 1, then we add.\n\n   But a=2 is already in the set. And if both are 1, we do not add, but it is already there? \n\n   However, we want a=2 to be valid regardless. But the set already has 2. \n\n   The problem: if both w and l are odd, then the condition for a=2 fails in the if statement, so we do not add. But it is already in the set. \n\n   Therefore, it is safe. \n\n   But what if we get a=2 from the divisor and it is not in the set? It is in the set initially. \n\n   So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   However, note: the condition might add a=1 and a=2 again, but the set will not have duplicates. \n\n   But the condition for a=2 when both w and l are odd: \n        (w%2=1, l%2=1) -> \n        (1<=2 and 1<=2) -> True.\n        then not (1==1 and 1==1) -> not (True) -> False -> we do not add.\n\n   But a=2 is already in the set. \n\n   Therefore, it is correct.\n\n   But what about a=4 in the sample w=4, l=4? \n        half_perimeter = 4+4-2 = 6.\n        divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n        a=1,2: already in the set.\n        a=3: \n            w%3=1, l%3=1 -> \n            (1<=2 and 1<=2) -> True.\n            then not (1==1 and 1==1) -> False -> skip.\n        a=6:\n            w%6=4 -> 4>2 -> skip.\n\n        So solutions = {1,2} -> but is a=4 valid? \n\n   Let me check: \n        boundary = 2*(4+4-2)=2*6=12.\n        a=4: 12/4=3 tiles.\n        Can we tile? \n            The four sides: \n                top: 4 -> can be covered by one tile of length 4? \n                right: 4 -> one tile.\n                bottom: 4 -> one tile.\n                left: 4 -> one tile? \n            But wait, the boundary is 12, not 16. \n\n        Actually, the sides: \n            top: 4\n            right: 4-2 = 2? \n            bottom: 4\n            left: 4-2 = 2\n            total = 4+2+4+2 = 12.\n\n        For the top: length 4 -> divisible by 4.\n        right: length 2 -> 2 mod 4 = 2 -> which is <=2 -> and then the condition: not (4%4=0, 4%4=0) -> not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True -> but wait, we are not using a=4? \n\n        But a=4: \n            w=4, l=4.\n            w%4=0, l%4=0 -> \n            (0<=2 and 0<=2) -> True.\n            then not (0==1 and 0==1) -> True -> so we add a=4.\n\n        But we did not get a=4 as a divisor of half_perimeter=6? \n\n        half_perimeter = w+l-2 = 4+4-2=6. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. So a=4 is not a divisor of 6. \n\n        Therefore, we do not consider a=4. \n\n        But is a=4 valid? \n            The total boundary is 12, and 4 does not divide 12? -> 12/4=3, which is integer. \n\n        Why is a=4 not a divisor of half_perimeter? The known solution uses half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then considers the divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n        But the condition for a to be valid is that a must divide the total boundary? -> 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. \n\n        So a must be a divisor of 2 * half_perimeter. \n\n        The known solution only iterates the divisors of half_perimeter. Then it also gets a and half_perimeter//a. \n\n        But the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter are not necessarily the same as the divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n        Therefore, we must iterate the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter? \n\n        But the given code uses half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then iterates the divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n        This is a mistake. \n\n        The known solution from the link: \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1774/submission/185339020\n\n            g = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n            factors = set()\n            for i in range(1, int(sqrt(g)) + 1):\n                if g % i == 0:\n                    factors.add(i)\n                    factors.add(g//i)\n\n            ans = set()\n            ans.add(1)\n            ans.add(2)\n            for factor in factors:\n                for a in [factor, 2*factor]:   # note: 2*factor\n                    if a > 2:\n                        if (w % a == 0 or w % a == 1 or w % a == 2) and (l % a == 0 or l % a == 1 or l % a == 2) and ( (w % a != 1) or (l % a != 1) ):\n                            ans.add(a)\n\n        This solution considers factors of gcd(w-1, l-1) and then also 2*factor.\n\n        Another known solution: \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1774/submission/185333350\n\n            for g in [0]:\n                for d in range(1, int(sqrt(w+l))+10):\n                    if d in seen: \n                        continue\n                    seen.add(d)\n                    for a in [d, (w+l-2)//d]:\n                        if a in ss: \n                            continue\n                        ss.add(a)\n                        if a<=2: \n                            continue\n                        if (w%a<=2) and (l%a<=2) and ( (w%a!=1) or (l%a!=1) ):\n                            ans.append(a)\n\n        This solution iterates d from 1 to about sqrt(w+l), and then a in [d, (w+l-2)//d] -> which are the divisors of (w+l-2). \n\n        Therefore, the given code in program2.py is only iterating the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2. \n\n        But the total boundary is 2*(w+l-2). So the divisors of the total boundary include the divisors of half_perimeter and also twice some divisors? \n\n        Specifically, if a is a divisor of the total boundary, then a must be such that a/2 is a divisor of half_perimeter if a is even, or a is a divisor of half_perimeter if a is odd? \n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate the divisors of the total boundary = 2*(w+l-2). \n\n        But the given code uses half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and then considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. \n\n        This will only get the divisors of half_perimeter, not the total boundary. \n\n        Therefore, we must also consider the divisors of the total boundary? \n\n        However, the known solution that passed uses only the divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n        And the sample: w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, divisors: 1,2,3,6. Then we consider a=1,2,3,6. \n        a=1,2: in the set initially.\n        a=3: added by the condition.\n        a=6: fails because w%6=3>2.\n\n        But the total boundary is 12, and the divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6,12. We are missing 4 and 12. \n        a=4: fails because w%4=3>2.\n        a=12: fails.\n\n        So it is the same. \n\n        Why is a=4 not a divisor of half_perimeter=6? It isn't. \n\n        Therefore, the given code is only considering the divisors of half_perimeter, and that is sufficient because the condition (w%a<=2 and l%a<=2 and not (both 1)) is only applied to these divisors, and also because the total boundary is 2*half_perimeter, and if a is a divisor of the total boundary, then either a is a divisor of half_perimeter or a/2 is a divisor of half_perimeter (if a is even). \n\n        But the known solution that passed uses only the divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n        Therefore, we will stick to the given code structure. \n\n        The missing code is:\n\n            if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition not (w%a==1 and l%a==1) is equivalent to (w%a != 1 or l%a != 1).\n\n   We can write:\n\n            if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   This is the same.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1) is always true if not both are 1.\n\n   We can also write:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2):\n            if not (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   Either is fine.\n\n   Let's choose the first.\n\nFor program3.py:\n   The problem: \n        We are allowed to choose an index i (2<=i<=n) and change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1] any number of times.\n        We want to make a_i=0 for all i from 2 to n.\n\n   We start with an array a = [a1, a2, ..., an].\n\n   Operation: \n        a_i = a_i - a_{i-1]   (only for i from 2 to n)\n\n   We can do operations in any order and any number of times.\n\n   We are to determine if it is possible.\n\n   Example: \n        [5,10] -> \n            Operation on i=2: [5,5] -> then again on i=2: [5,0] -> YES.\n\n        [1,2,3] -> \n            Operation on i=3: [1,2,1] \n            Operation on i=2: [1,1,1]\n            Operation on i=3: [1,1,0]\n            Operation on i=2: [1,0,0] -> YES.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   We can work backwards? \n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the effect of operations. \n\n   Note: the operations only allow subtracting a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\n   We can only reduce a_i, and we can reduce it by multiples of a_{i-1}. \n\n   But note: we can do operations in any order and any number of times. \n\n   We want to make a_i=0 for i>=2.\n\n   For the last element a_n: \n        We can only reduce it by multiples of a_{n-1}. So to make a_n=0, we must have a_n being a multiple of a_{n-1}? \n\n   But wait, we can change a_{n-1} first? \n\n   Example: [2,3,1]\n        We want to make a3=0: \n            We can do:\n                Operation on i=2: [2, 3-2=1, 1] -> [2,1,1]\n                then on i=3: [2,1,1-1=0] -> [2,1,0]\n            Then we need to make a2=0: \n                Operation on i=2: [2,1-2] -> negative? not allowed? \n\n   But the problem says: the array consists of positive integers, and the operation: change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. So during the process, the numbers must remain nonnegative? \n\n   The problem does not explicitly say nonnegative, but the input is positive integers. And the operation: a_i - a_{i-1} might become nonpositive. \n\n   But the example: [2,1,0] -> then we do i=2: a2 = 1-2 = -1 -> negative. \n\n   However, the problem does not say the numbers must remain positive, but the operation is defined for any index i (2<=i<=n) and we are allowed to do any number of times. \n\n   But the sample [1,2,3] became [1,0,0] -> which has nonnegative numbers. \n\n   The problem: is it possible to make a_i=0 for all i>=2, and the other elements can be any nonnegative integer? \n\n   We are not required to keep the first element positive? \n\n   But the operation: we are only changing a_i (for i>=2) to a_i - a_{i-1}. The first element a1 is never changed. \n\n   And a1 remains positive. \n\n   For the other elements, they might become zero or positive or negative? \n\n   But if they become negative, then in a later operation when we use an index i, we would be subtracting a_{i-1} which might be negative? \n\n   The problem does not forbid negative numbers. \n\n   However, the known solution in the given code has a function:\n\n        def diff_ops(arr):\n            result = True\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n            return result\n\n   And then they use:\n\n        for case in test_cases:\n            print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\n   This means: \n        It is possible if and only if for every i from 1 to n-1 (i.e., the elements from a2 to an), we have that the element is divisible by a1.\n\n   But let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example1: [5,10] -> \n        a1=5, a2=10 -> 10 % 5==0 -> YES.\n\n   Example2: [1,2,3] -> \n        a1=1, then 2%1==0, 3%1==0 -> YES.\n\n   Example3: [2,3,1] -> \n        a1=2, then 3%2=1 !=0 -> NO.\n\n   But is [2,3,1] really impossible? \n\n        We can do:\n            Operation on i=3: [2,3,1-3] -> [2,3,-2] -> then we have negative.\n\n            Alternatively, first on i=2: \n                [2, 3-2=1, 1] -> [2,1,1]\n            then on i=3: [2,1,1-1=0] -> [2,1,0]\n            then on i=2: [2,1-2 = -1,0] -> negative.\n\n        Then we cannot make a2=0 without making it negative? \n\n        But the goal is to make a_i=0 for i>=2. We have a3=0, but a2=-1. \n\n        We can try to fix a2: \n            We can do an operation on i=2: a2 = a2 - a1 = -1 - 2 = -3 -> worse.\n\n        So it seems impossible.\n\n   Example4: [2,2,2] -> \n        a1=2, then 2%2=0, 2%2=0 -> YES.\n\n        Operations: \n            We can do i=2: [2,0,2] -> then i=3: [2,0,2-0=2] -> not zero.\n            Alternatively, i=3 first: [2,2,0] -> then i=2: [2,2-2=0,0] -> YES.\n\n   So the condition holds.\n\n   But consider: [3,6,6]\n        a1=3, 6%3=0, 6%3=0 -> YES.\n\n        How to do:\n            Operation on i=2: [3,3,6] \n            then on i=3: [3,3,3] \n            then on i=3: [3,3,0] \n            then on i=2: [3,0,0] -> YES.\n\n   But what about: [3,6,9] -> \n        a1=3, 6%3=0, 9%3=0 -> YES.\n\n   However, consider: [3,6,10] -> \n        a1=3, 10%3=1 -> NO.\n\n        Can we do it?\n            Operation on i=3: [3,6,10-6=4] -> [3,6,4]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,6,4-6] -> negative? \n            Operation on i=2: [3,6-3=3,4] -> [3,3,4]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,3,4-3=1] -> [3,3,1]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,3,1-3] -> negative.\n\n        Alternatively, after [3,3,4]:\n            Operation on i=2: [3,3-3=0,4] -> [3,0,4]\n            Operation on i=3: [3,0,4-0=4] -> [3,0,4] -> stuck.\n\n        So it seems impossible.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: \n        For every i from 1 to n-1 (i.e., for a2, a3, ..., an), we require that a_{i+1] is divisible by a1.\n\n   But wait, what if we change a1? We cannot change a1. \n\n   However, the operations only change a_i for i>=2. \n\n   But during the operations, the value of a1 remains fixed. \n\n   And for a2: we can only reduce it by multiples of a1. So to make a2=0, we must have a2 being a multiple of a1. \n\n   Then for a3: after we have made a2=0, then we can only reduce a3 by multiples of a2 (which is 0) -> but we cannot reduce a3 by 0? \n\n   This suggests that we must make a3=0 before we make a2=0? \n\n   The operations can be done in any order. \n\n   We can do operations on a3 first, then a2, then a3 again, etc. \n\n   The known solution is to check that every element is divisible by a1. \n\n   But consider: [3,6,6] -> \n        We did not make a2=0 first. We made a3=0 last? \n\n   How does the condition work? \n\n   The condition is: at the beginning, we require that every element is divisible by a1. \n\n   Why is that sufficient? \n        We can simulate the process from left to right? \n        We want to make a2=0: we can do it by subtracting a1 (which is fixed) multiple times: \n            a2 = a2 - k * a1, and we can choose k so that a2 becomes 0? -> only if a2 is divisible by a1.\n        Then for a3: we want to make a3=0. But now a2=0. We can subtract a2 (which is 0) any number of times: it won't change a3. So we must make a3=0 before we make a2=0? \n            But then we reduce a3 by multiples of a2 (which is 6) -> but 6 is not divisible by a1? \n\n   Alternatively, we can reduce a3 by multiples of a2 (which is 6) even if a2 is not zero? \n\n   The operation: \n        We can do an operation on i=3: a3 = a3 - a2. \n        But a2 might be reduced to 0 only later? \n\n   In the example [3,6,6]:\n        We did:\n            i=2: a2 = 6-3 = 3 -> [3,3,6]\n            i=3: a3 = 6-3 = 3 -> [3,3,3]\n            i=3: a3 = 3-3=0 -> [3,3,0]\n            i=2: a2 = 3-3=0 -> [3,0,0]\n\n   But note: at the time we did the first operation on i=3, a2 was 3, not 0. \n\n   So the value used for the subtraction is the current value of a_{i-1]. \n\n   Therefore, the condition that every element must be divisible by a1 might not be sufficient? \n\n   Consider: [3,6,6] -> \n        a1=3, a2=6 (divisible by 3), a3=6 (divisible by 3) -> YES.\n\n   But what about [3,6,7]? \n        a1=3, a2=6 (divisible), a3=7 (not divisible) -> NO.\n\n   But can we do [3,6,7]? \n        Operation on i=2: [3,3,7] \n        then on i=3: [3,3,4] \n        then on i=3: [3,3,1] \n        then on i=3: [3,3,1-3] -> negative? \n        or after [3,3,4]: \n            on i=2: [3,0,4] \n            then on i=3: [3,0,4] -> cannot reduce 4 by 0.\n\n        So it is impossible.\n\n   But what about [3,6,9]? \n        We can do:\n            i=3: [3,6,3] -> then i=2: [3,3,3] -> then i=3: [3,3,0] -> then i=2: [3,0,0]\n\n   So the condition is: every element must be divisible by a1. \n\n   Why is that necessary and sufficient?\n\n   Necessary: \n        a1 is fixed. \n        For a2: we can only subtract multiples of a1. So to make a2=0, we must have a2 = k * a1 for some integer k? \n        But note: we might not make a2=0 in one go: we can do multiple operations, but each time we subtract a1. So a2 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a1 several times. Therefore, a2 must be divisible by a1.\n\n        For a3: we can subtract a2 (which might be reduced) any number of times. But note: a2 is being reduced by multiples of a1. So at any time, a2 is a multiple of a1. Then a3 must be reduced by multiples of a1 (because we are subtracting multiples of a1 when we subtract a2). Therefore, to make a3=0, we must have that the current value of a3 is a multiple of a1. But initially, a3 is a multiple of a1, and when we subtract a2 (which is a multiple of a1), we get a3 - k * a1 (for some integer k) -> which is also a multiple of a1. So at every step, a3 is a multiple of a1. Therefore, to become 0, it must be that the current value is 0, which is a multiple of a1. \n\n        But how do we know we can make it 0? \n            We can reduce a3 by any multiple of a1? But we are subtracting a2, which is at least a1 (if a2 is not zero) and at most the original a2. \n\n        However, we can reduce a3 arbitrarily: \n            We can do: \n                a3 = a3 - a2   -> then a3 becomes a3 - a2.\n                then if we reduce a2 by a1, then a2 becomes a2 - a1, then we can do a3 = a3 - a2 = a3 - a2 + a1, which is not helpful.\n\n        But note: we can do operations in any order. \n\n        We can reduce a2 to 0 first: \n            Then a3 becomes a3 - k * a2, but while reducing a2, a2 is changing. \n\n        Alternatively, we can reduce a3 by a2 repeatedly until a3 < a2, then reduce a2 by a1, then reduce a3 by the new a2, etc. \n\n        This is essentially the Euclidean algorithm. \n\n        The value we can subtract from a3 is any linear combination of a1 and a2? But with nonnegative coefficients? \n\n        Actually, the set of values we can subtract from a3 is the set of multiples of gcd(a1, a2)? \n\n        But initially, a2 is a multiple of a1, so gcd(a1,a2)=a1. \n\n        Therefore, we can subtract any multiple of a1 from a3. \n\n        And since a3 is a multiple of a1, we can reduce it to 0. \n\n        Similarly, for a4: we can subtract a3 (which is being reduced) and a3 is always a multiple of a1, so we can reduce a4 to 0 if and only if a4 is a multiple of a1.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: every element in the array must be divisible by a1.\n\n   But note: the array after the first element is fixed? \n\n   However, the known solution in the given code has:\n\n        def diff_ops(arr):\n            result = True\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n            return result\n\n   This checks that for every element from index1 to the end, it is divisible by arr[0] (which is a1).\n\n   But what if a1 changes? It doesn't.\n\n   However, consider: [4, 6] -> \n        6 % 4 = 2 !=0 -> NO.\n\n        Can we do it?\n            Operation on i=2: [4,2] \n            then again: [4,2-4] -> negative? \n            or [4,2] -> then we cannot make it 0 because 2 is not divisible by 4? \n\n        But wait, we can do:\n            [4,6] -> i=2: 6-4=2 -> [4,2]\n            then we want to make a2=0: we need to subtract a1=4 from a2=2 -> 2-4 = negative.\n\n        So it is impossible.\n\n   But what if we have [4,8,2]? \n        a1=4, a2=8 (divisible), a3=2 (not divisible) -> NO.\n\n        But can we do:\n            First, reduce a2: \n                [4,8-4=4,2] -> [4,4,2]\n            then reduce a3: [4,4,2-4] -> negative? \n            or reduce a3 first: [4,4,2] -> then reduce a3 by a2: [4,4,2-4] -> negative.\n\n        Or reduce a2 again: [4,0,2] -> then reduce a3: [4,0,2] -> cannot reduce 2 by 0.\n\n        So impossible.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is that every element must be divisible by a1.\n\n   But wait, what if a1 is not the greatest common divisor? \n\n   Consider: [2,4,6] -> \n        a1=2, 4%2=0, 6%2=0 -> YES.\n\n        How to do:\n            Reduce a3: \n                using a2: [2,4,6-4=2] -> [2,4,2]\n            then reduce a2: [2,4-2=2,2] -> [2,2,2]\n            then reduce a3: [2,2,0] \n            then reduce a2: [2,0,0]\n\n   But consider: [2,4,7] -> \n        a1=2, 4%2=0, 7%2=1 -> NO.\n\n   However, is there a possibility? \n        We can reduce a3 by a2: [2,4,3] \n        then reduce a2: [2,2,3] \n        then reduce a3: [2,2,1] \n        then reduce a2: [2,0,1] \n        then cannot reduce a3.\n\n        Or: \n            [2,4,7] -> reduce a2: [2,2,7] \n            then reduce a3: [2,2,5] \n            then reduce a3: [2,2,3] \n            then reduce a3: [2,2,1] \n            then reduce a2: [2,0,1] -> stuck.\n\n   So it is impossible.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is to check that for every i from 1 to n-1, a[i] is divisible by a[0].\n\n   Now, the given code in program3.py is:\n\n        input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n        len_input = len(input_arr)\n        n = input_arr[0]\n        test_cases = []\n        pos = 1\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        for case in test_cases:\n            print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\n   We are to read t test cases. The first integer is t. Then for each test case, we read an integer n, then a list of n integers.\n\n   The input_arr is the list of all integers.\n\n   We have:\n        n = input_arr[0]   -> but wait, the first integer is t, the number of test cases.\n\n   The given code:\n\n        n = input_arr[0]   # this is t, the number of test cases? \n\n        But then the next is the first test case: \n            the first test case: \n                n_i = input_arr[pos]   (the next integer) \n                then the next n_i integers.\n\n   But the variable name is confusing: the first integer is t, not n. \n\n   The given code:\n\n        n = input_arr[0]   # this is t\n\n        Then we have:\n\n        test_cases = []\n        pos = 1\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: read one test case: \n            #   n_i = input_arr[pos]   (the next integer)\n            #   then the next n_i integers: from input_arr[pos+1] to input_arr[pos+n_i]\n\n            # then update pos = pos + n_i + 1\n\n   But the variable n is used for the number of test cases. \n\n   We should do:\n\n        t = input_arr[0]\n        pos = 1\n        for i in range(t):\n            n_i = input_arr[pos]\n            arr_i = input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+n_i]\n            test_cases.append(arr_i)\n            pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n   But the given code uses a while loop: while pos <= len_input-1.\n\n   Since we know there are t test cases, we can do a for loop for t times.\n\n   Alternatively, the while loop condition: while there is more data.\n\n   But the input specification says: the first integer is t, then t test cases.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):   # but n is t\n            n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr_i = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n            pos += n_i\n            test_cases.append(arr_i)\n\n   But the variable n is set to input_arr[0] (which is t). \n\n   Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n        for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n            n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr_i = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n            test_cases.append(arr_i)\n            pos += n_i\n\n   But note: the variable n is the number of test cases, and we are using it in a for loop.\n\n   However, the next integer after t is the first test case's n.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            2\n            2\n            5 10\n            3\n            1 2 3\n\n        input_arr = [2, 2, 5,10, 3, 1,2,3]\n\n        Then:\n            n = 2 (the first integer)\n            pos=1\n            i=0: \n                n_i = input_arr[1] = 2\n                arr_i = input_arr[2:4] = [5,10]\n                then pos becomes 1+1+2 = 4? \n            i=1:\n                n_i = input_arr[4] = 3\n                arr_i = input_arr[5:8] = [1,2,3]\n                pos becomes 4+1+3 = 8 -> then the while condition: pos=8, len_input=8 -> 8<=7? no -> break.\n\n        But the while condition is: while pos<=len_input-1 -> 8<=7? false.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a for loop for the number of test cases.\n\n   But the given code uses a while loop. \n\n   We can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n            size = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr_i = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n            pos += size\n            test_cases.append(arr_i)\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_i = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr_i = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n            test_cases.append(arr_i)\n            pos += n_i\n\n   But note: the variable n is the number of test cases, which is the first integer.\n\n   However, the variable name in the given code is n, but it represents the number of test cases.\n\n   We are using it to loop.\n\n   This is correct.\n\nSummary:\n\n   program1.py: \n        else:\n            ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0]-xy[1]-1])\n\n   program2.py: \n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   program3.py: \n        for i in range(n):\n            n_i = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr_i = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n            test_cases.append(arr_i)\n            pos += n_i\n\n   But note: in program3.py, the variable n is the number of test cases (which is the first integer). \n\n   And we are reading the next n_i integers for the array.\n\n   We output the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\n   However, note: in program2.py, the condition is written as:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n\n   But we must be careful: the condition (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1) is a logical or. \n\n   We can write it as: \n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and (w % a != 1 or l % a != 1):\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let's write the JSON."
