Since z (which is the old cnt) is not less than the new cnt (which is old cnt-1) because z (old cnt) > = new cnt (old cnt-1) -> actually, z (old cnt) is greater than new cnt (old cnt-1). So the last condition does nothing. But the icon we are removing was at the old last cell. In the old state, that icon was counted as correct (because it was in the good region). When we remove it, we must remove one from `correct`. However, we are going to do that in the last line: `if z < cnt: ...`?

Then we check if z < new cnt? It is not, so we don't subtract for the removed icon. However, the removed icon was in the good region (because the old good region was [0, old cnt-1] and z = old cnt-1? Actually, wait: the old good region was [0, old cnt-1] (because the old cnt was the total number of icons). The linear index of the removed icon is z = old cnt-1? Then it was in the good region. So we must subtract one from `correct` for that removal. But in the code above, we subtract one from `correct` only if the removed icon is in the new good region (z < new cnt = old cnt-1) which is false. So we are missing the correction for the removed icon when it is at the boundary. How did the addition branch handle it? In the addition branch, we added an icon and then if the new icon is in the new good region (z < new cnt = old cnt+1) then we add one. So the removal should subtract one if the removed icon was in the old good region? But note: the old good region was [0, old cnt-1] (with old cnt being the total before removal).

But note: the condition is `while b > a and ...`. We are not updating a? Then the condition `b>a` would be always true? That would be an infinite loop. We must update a? But a is not defined in the branch. Alternatively, we can update a by doing `a += 1`? But we are in the branch where b>a, and we are multiplying by 2, so the exponent of 2 in the overall number becomes a+1? But we are not storing that. Alternatively, we can think: we are only using the condition on the difference (b - a). We can maintain the difference? But the code doesn't. Looking at the symmetric branch for a>b: we do `b += 1` (which is updating the exponent of 5) and then the condition `a > b` becomes `a > b+1`? So we are reducing the difference. Similarly, in the branch b>a, we should do `a += 1` to reduce the difference. But note: the variable a is defined in the outer scope. We can update it. So the TODO block should be:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1 But let me test with an example: n=5, m=43. Then a=0, b=1. We enter the branch b>a. Then we do:\n   t=1 -> multiply by 2: t=2, a=1 -> now a==b, so we break. Then we do: while 10*t<=m: t=2 -> 20<=43 -> t=20. Then we do: m - (m%t) = 43 - (43 mod 20) = 43-3=40. Then n*k = 5*40=200. Which is the expected answer. Another example: n=13, m=5. Then a=0, b=0. We skip both branches. Then we do: while 10*t<=m: t=1 -> 10<=5? false. Then k = m - (m%1) = 5. Then output 13*5=65. But what if we have n=10, m=1? Then a=1, b=1. Skip both branches. Then we do: while 10*t<=m: t=1 -> 10<=1? false. Then k=1, output=10. But what if n=10, m=10? Then we do: while 10*t<=10 -> t=1 -> 10<=10 -> then t=10. Then k = 10 - (10%10)=10. Then output=100. But what if n=10, m=15? Then we can do t=10 (because 10*10<=15? no, 10*10=100>15). So we break at t=1? Then k=15 - (15%1)=15. Then output=150. But 150 has one trailing zero. Alternatively, we could do k=10: then 10*10=100, which has two trailing zeros. So 100 is rounder than 150. The issue: the while loop multiplies t by 10 as long as 10*t<=m. But after we balance the 2s and 5s, we have a factor t that we can use to get at least one trailing zero. Then we can multiply by 10 as long as we can (without exceeding m) to get more trailing zeros. But in the example n=10, m=15: \n   n = 10 = 2^1 * 5^1 * 1 -> a=1, b=1 -> skip the balancing. then we do: t=1 -> then we can multiply by 10: 10*1=10<=15 -> so t becomes 10. then we try 10*10=100>15 -> so we stop. then k = m - (m%t) = 15 - (15%10)=15-5=10.\n   then n*k=10*10=100. That is correct. But what if n=2, m=10? \n   a=1, b=0. then we are in the branch a>b: we do while a>0 and 5*t<=10: t=5, then a>0? still, then 5*5=25>10 -> break. So t=5. then we do: while 10*t<=10? 50<=10? false. So k = 10 - (10%5)=10-0=10. Then output=2*10=20. But 20 has one trailing zero. Alternatively, we could do k=5: 2*5=10, which has one trailing zero. But the problem says: if there are several with the same roundness, output the one with the largest new price. 20>10, so 20 is chosen. That is correct. Therefore, the TODO block is: \n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut note: the variable a is defined in the outer scope. We are in the branch `elif b > a:`, so we can update a.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code is: \n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nFor program3.py: The problem is about counting the number of trees (with a specific structure: vertex i for i>=2 is connected to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) such that vertex i is the centroid.

The function `inv` is called in the computation of `invfact`:\n\n    invfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1]) So fact[MAX-1] is non-zero. Also, in the function `invs(x)`:\n\n    return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x]) This is the inverse of x? Because fact[x-1] * invfact[x] = ( (x-1)! ) / (x!) = 1/x. So `invs(x)` returns 1/x mod MOD.",

The body is at 12 spaces. So we output two lines with 12 spaces. Therefore, the string for program2 is 12 spaces + \"t *= 2\" and then newline and then 12 spaces + \"a += 1\".

But the symmetric branch in the addition had:\n\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct += 1\n\nat 12 spaces. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces? But the problem says to output only the code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at 12 spaces, so we output \"correct -= 1\" without any extra spaces?",

But the TODO is at 4 spaces. So we output one line with 4 spaces and then the code. Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    correct -= 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\",\n    \"program3\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut wait, for program1, the TODO is at 12 spaces, and we output 4 spaces? That doesn't match. We must be consistent. Since the problem does not specify, and to avoid overcomplicating, we output the code without any extra indentation. The environment will put it at the correct indentation. So:\n\nprogram1: \"correct -= 1\"\nprogram2: \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\nprogram3: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\" But then the indentation might be off. Given the instructions, I think we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the correct indentation. After re-thinking, I will output:\n\nprogram1: 8 spaces are for the if block, and the body of the if should be 4 more -> 12 spaces. But the symmetric branch in the addition has 12 spaces for the body. So program1: \"    correct -= 1\" (which is 4 spaces) is not enough. We need 12 spaces? But 12 spaces is a string of 12 spaces. We do:\n\n    \"program1\": \"            correct -= 1\"\n\nSimilarly, program2: 12 spaces for each line:\n\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\nprogram3: 4 spaces for the return (because the function body is 4 spaces):\n\n    \"program3\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut wait, in program3, the function body is 4 spaces, so the return should be at 4 spaces. But the TODO is at 4 spaces. So we output \"    return ...\" (4 spaces). But the function header is at 0? No, the function header is at 0 indentation? The function is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    ... The body is indented by 4 spaces. So the return should be at 4 spaces. Therefore, the final answer.",

But to be safe, we output the exact string that would replace the TODO. The TODO is a comment. We replace it with \"correct -= 1\", and the indentation is already there? The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing, without the surrounding. So we output \"correct -= 1\" without any indentation. But then the program would break because of indentation. So we must output the code with the same indentation as the TODO. However, the problem does not specify. But the example of the symmetric branch in the addition has \"correct += 1\" at 12 spaces. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces? But the JSON string would then have 12 spaces at the beginning. That is acceptable. Alternatively, we note that the TODO is at the same level as the comment, so we output the code at the same level. Given the ambiguity, I will output the code without any extra indentation. The environment will place it correctly. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so for program1, it is \"correct -= 1\", for program2, it is two lines: \"t *= 2\" and \"a += 1\", and for program3, it is \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\". But to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation as the surrounding. We decide:\n\nprogram1: the TODO is at 12 spaces? The code we output is at 12 spaces: \"    correct -= 1\" (with 4 spaces) but actually the surrounding if is at 8 spaces and the body should be 12. But the symmetric branch in the addition had 4 spaces for the body? Actually, the addition branch:\n\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct += 1\n\nThe body of the if is at 16 spaces? Let me count the spaces in the addition branch:\n\n        if m[z] == 0:\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct += 1\n            m[z] = 1\n            cnt += 1\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct += 1\n\nThe inner if is at 8 spaces (from the outer if) and its body is at 12 spaces. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces? But 12 spaces is 3 tabs? We avoid tabs and use spaces. But in the removal branch, the TODO is at:\n\n        else: cnt -= 1\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            m[z] = 0\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct -= 1 The else is at 4, the cnt at 8, the if at 8, and the TODO at 12. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces. But in a string, we represent 12 spaces as 12 spaces. Similarly, for program2, the TODO is at 12 spaces, and we output two lines at 12 spaces.",

But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information. \"\n\nSo for program2, we output:\n\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the while loop body. The TODO is at that indentation. We output two lines with 8 spaces each? Or one level of indentation? The problem does not specify the exact indentation level, but we should match the context. In the provided code for program2, the while loop in the symmetric branch (a>b) has:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nSo the body is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the while). Similarly, we should do 8 spaces for the two lines in the else branch. But the TODO is currently at 12 spaces? Actually, the while loop is at 4 spaces (from the for loop) and the body is indented by 4 more (so 8). The TODO is a comment at 12 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at the same level as the body of the while loop in the a>b branch? So we should output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the entire block is indented. The code for the a>b branch has two lines: \n            t *= 5\n            b += 1 So we output two lines with the same indentation. Therefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1 But wait, the existing code for the a>b branch has 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the structure:\n\nfor n, m in ...:\n    a = b = 0\n    ... if a > b:\n        while ...:\n            t *= 5   # this line is indented by 8 spaces from the for loop? b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while ...:\n            ...   # TODO",

So we output two lines, each with 12 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, to match the context, we should use the same indentation as the symmetric branch. Alternatively, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would replace the TODO. Since the TODO is at the same level as the body of the while in the a>b branch, we output:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nwith the same indentation as the body of the while in the a>b branch (which is 8 spaces from the while, but 12 from the outer for). But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, in the provided code for the a>b branch, the body is two lines: \"t *= 5\" and \"b += 1\", each at the same indentation level. So we output two lines: \"t *= 2\" and \"a += 1\", with the same indentation as the while loop body in the a>b branch. But to be safe, we can output the two lines with 8 spaces of indentation relative to the while loop?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about moving icons to form a \"good\" desktop. The desktop is represented as an n x m grid. The good arrangement requires that all icons form a contiguous region starting from the top-left, filling columns first and then the next column partially if needed.\n\nWe note that the code uses a 1D array `a` to store the positions of the icons (converted to a linear index: x * n + y) and an array `m` (which is a bad name because it shadows the variable m, but we see it is redefined) that acts as a presence marker.\n\nThe variable `cnt` is the total number of icons. The variable `correct` counts how many icons are already in the correct positions (i.e., in the first `cnt` positions of the linearized grid?).\n\nThe linearization: the grid is stored row by row? Actually, note: the linear index is computed as `x * n + y`. This means:\n  - The first column (x=0) has indices: 0, 1, 2, ... n-1.\n  - The second column (x=1) has indices: n, n+1, ... 2n-1, etc.\n\nThe \"good\" arrangement would have the first `cnt` icons in the linear order? Actually, the idea is that the entire grid is linearized by columns: so the first `cnt` positions in the linear order (0-indexed) would be the first `cnt` cells in column-major order.\n\nBut note: the condition for an icon at position `z` to be correct is `z < cnt`. Why? Because we want the first `cnt` cells in the column-major order to be filled. However, note that the grid has `n * m` cells. The first `cnt` cells in the linearized array (by column: x from 0 to m-1, and for each x, y from 0 to n-1) are the cells that should be filled.\n\nIn the query, we flip the state of cell (x, y) (note: the input gives y and x? Actually, the input says: \"two integers x_i and y_i\", but in the code we read as `y, x = ...` and then subtract 1. Then we compute `z = x * n + y`. So the input x_i is the row? and y_i is the column? Actually, the problem says: \"the position of the cell which changes its state\" and the input is given as two integers: x_i and y_i. The code then does:\n    y, x = [int(p) for p in sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()]\n    y -= 1\n    x -= 1\n    z = x * n + y\n\nThis suggests that the input x_i is the row index (which becomes y in 0-indexed) and y_i is the column index (which becomes x in 0-indexed). So the linear index is: column index * n + row index.\n\nNow, the missing part is in the removal branch:\n\n        else:\n            cnt -= 1\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            m[z] = 0\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct -= 1\n\nWhat happens when we remove an icon?\nWe are removing the icon at position `z`. We decrement `cnt` (the total number of icons). Then we check: if the cell at linear index `cnt` (which is now the last cell in the current \"good\" region) has an icon (i.e., m[cnt]==1), then we do something.\n\nBut note: when we remove an icon, the total number of icons becomes `cnt` (after decrement). The cell at linear index `cnt` (which was previously inside the good region when the total was `cnt+1`) is now the first cell that is outside the good region? Actually, the good region now is the first `cnt` cells. So if the cell at `cnt` (which is now the first cell beyond the good region) has an icon, then that icon is now incorrectly placed. Therefore, we must decrement `correct` because that icon is no longer in the correct position? But note: we are going to remove the icon at `z` and then update `correct` for that removal.\n\nHowever, observe that we have two updates to `correct`:\n\n1. The icon we are removing: if it was in the good region (z < cnt+1, but note after removal the good region becomes `cnt`), then we do `correct -= 1` at the end.\n\n2. Additionally, the cell at index `cnt` (which is now beyond the good region) might have an icon. If it does, then that icon was previously considered correct (because when the total was `cnt+1`, the good region was the first `cnt+1` cells, so the cell at `cnt` was included) but now it is not. Therefore, we must also decrement `correct` by one for that icon.\n\nBut note: we are about to set `m[z] = 0` and then check `if z < cnt: correct -= 1`. However, the icon at `cnt` is a different icon.\n\nSo the missing code should be:\n\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct -= 1\n\nBut wait: what if the icon we are removing is at `z` and `z == cnt`? Then we are removing the icon at the boundary. Then we decrement `cnt` and then check the cell at `cnt` (which is the same as the old `cnt`? Actually, after removal, `cnt` becomes the old `cnt-1`. The cell at the old `cnt` (which is now beyond the new good region) is the one we are checking. But note: we are removing the icon at `z` and then setting `m[z]=0`. However, if `z == cnt` (the old `cnt` before removal) then after removal the new `cnt` is the old `cnt-1`, and we are checking the cell at the new `cnt` (which is the old `cnt-1`). So we are not checking the removed cell.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is simply: `correct -= 1`\n\nBut note: we are about to set `m[z]=0` and then do `if z < cnt: correct -= 1`. The removal of the icon at `z` might be at a position that is beyond the new `cnt`? Then we don't adjust `correct` for `z` in the following line. However, the icon at `cnt` (the new `cnt`) is a separate icon that is now out of the good region.\n\nSo the missing line is: `correct -= 1`\n\nBut let me reexamine the addition branch for symmetry:\n\nIn the addition branch:\n\n        if m[z] == 0:\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct += 1\n            m[z] = 1\n            cnt += 1\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct += 1\n\nHere, when we add an icon, we first check: if the current last cell of the good region (at index `cnt`) has an icon, then we do `correct += 1`. Why? Because when we add an icon, the good region expands to `cnt+1` cells. The cell at `cnt` was previously beyond the good region, but now it becomes the last cell of the good region. So if it had an icon, then that icon becomes correctly placed. Then we add the new icon and then if the new icon is in the new good region (z < cnt+1) then we do `correct += 1`.\n\nSimilarly, in removal, we are removing an icon. We decrement `cnt`. Then we note that the cell at the new `cnt` (which was previously the last cell of the good region) is now beyond the good region. So if that cell has an icon, then that icon is no longer in the good region and we must decrement `correct`.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the removal branch is:\n\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct -= 1\n\nBut note: we are about to set `m[z] = 0`? Actually, we haven't set `m[z]=0` yet. So the value of `m[cnt]` is still the old value (the presence of the icon at `cnt`). And we are going to remove the icon at `z` (so we set `m[z]=0`). But the icon at `cnt` is a different cell.\n\nSo the code is:\n\n        else:\n            cnt -= 1\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct -= 1\n            m[z] = 0\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct -= 1\n\nBut wait: what if `z == cnt`? Then we are removing the icon at the last cell of the current good region. Then we do:\n   cnt becomes cnt-1.\n   then we check m[cnt] (which is the new last cell of the good region) and if it has an icon, we decrement correct by one? But note: the new last cell (at index cnt-1) might have an icon? Then we decrement correct for that.\n\nBut also, we then set m[z] (which is the old last cell) to 0, and then check if z < cnt? Since z (which is the old cnt) is not less than the new cnt (which is old cnt-1) because z (old cnt) >= new cnt (old cnt-1) -> actually, z (old cnt) is greater than new cnt (old cnt-1). So the last condition does nothing.\n\nBut the icon we are removing was at the old last cell. In the old state, that icon was counted as correct (because it was in the good region). When we remove it, we must remove one from `correct`. However, we are going to do that in the last line: `if z < cnt: ...`? But z (old cnt) is not less than the new cnt (old cnt-1) because old cnt >= old cnt-1. So we don't do the last correction for the removed icon? \n\nBut note: the removal of the icon at z (which is the old cnt) is handled by the first correction: we check the new last cell (which is at index new cnt = old cnt-1) and then we set m[z]=0. Then we check if z < new cnt? It is not, so we don't subtract for the removed icon. However, the removed icon was in the good region (because the old good region was [0, old cnt-1] and z = old cnt-1? Actually, wait: the old good region was [0, old cnt-1] (because the old cnt was the total number of icons). The linear index of the removed icon is z = old cnt-1? Then it was in the good region. So we must subtract one from `correct` for that removal.\n\nBut in the code above, we subtract one from `correct` only if the removed icon is in the new good region (z < new cnt = old cnt-1) which is false. So we are missing the correction for the removed icon when it is at the boundary.\n\nHow did the addition branch handle it? In the addition branch, we added an icon and then if the new icon is in the new good region (z < new cnt = old cnt+1) then we add one. So the removal should subtract one if the removed icon was in the old good region? But note: the old good region was [0, old cnt-1] (with old cnt being the total before removal). The removed icon is at z. We must subtract one if z was in the old good region? The old good region was [0, old cnt-1]. So if z < old cnt, then we subtract one. But note: after removal, the new total is old cnt-1, so the new good region is [0, old cnt-2]. The condition we have at the end is `if z < cnt` (where cnt is the new total, old cnt-1). This condition is equivalent to z < old cnt-1. But the removed icon might be at z = old cnt-1, which is not less than old cnt-1? So we don't subtract.\n\nTherefore, we must subtract one for the removed icon if it was in the old good region? The old good region was [0, old cnt-1]. So we should subtract one if z < old cnt. But note: the variable `cnt` after decrement is old cnt-1. So we can write: if z < old_cnt, then subtract. But we don't have old_cnt stored. However, note that the old value of cnt was `cnt+1` (because we just did `cnt -= 1`). So we can write:\n\n        else:\n            # old_cnt = cnt\n            cnt -= 1   # now cnt is old_cnt-1\n            # The old good region was [0, old_cnt-1] = [0, cnt] (because cnt is now old_cnt-1, so old_cnt = cnt+1)\n            # So the removed icon was in the old good region if z < old_cnt = cnt+1.\n            # But note: we are going to set m[z]=0, so we must adjust `correct` for the removal of this icon: if it was in the old good region, then we lose one correct icon.\n\n            # However, we have two adjustments:\n            # 1. The removal of the icon at z: if it was in the old good region, then we must subtract one from `correct`.\n            # 2. The cell at the new last index (which is now at index cnt) was previously in the good region (because the old good region went up to cnt (which was then the second last) and now it is beyond) so if it has an icon, we must subtract one.\n\n            # But note: the icon at the new last index (cnt) was already counted in `correct` in the old state? Yes, because the old good region was [0, cnt] (since old_cnt = cnt+1) and the cell at index cnt was included.\n\n            # Therefore, we do:\n            #   if m[cnt] == 1: then that icon is now beyond the good region -> subtract one from correct.\n            #   and then for the removed icon: if it was in the old good region (z < old_cnt = cnt+1) then subtract one. But note: the removed icon might be the same as the one at cnt? Only if z == cnt.\n\n            # However, we cannot subtract twice for the same icon? So we must be cautious.\n\n            # Actually, the removed icon is at z, and the icon at cnt is at a different position. So we can do:\n\n            # Step 1: remove the icon at z: if z < old_cnt (which is cnt+1) then we will subtract one (but we haven't done it yet). We are going to do that at the end? Currently, we have an if statement for the cell at cnt.\n\n            # The code currently does:\n            #   if m[cnt] == 1: correct -= 1   [for the icon at cnt]\n            #   then set m[z]=0\n            #   then if z < cnt: correct -= 1   [for the removed icon in the new good region? but note: the new good region is [0, cnt-1]? Actually, the new good region is [0, cnt-1]? No: the new good region is the first `cnt` cells (which are indices 0 to cnt-1). So the condition `if z < cnt` is checking if the removed icon was in the new good region? But we are removing it, so if it was in the new good region, we must subtract one? However, the new good region is defined for the new state (with cnt icons). The removed icon is no longer present, so if it was in the new good region, then we are removing an icon that was correctly placed? But wait: the new good region is defined for the new state, and the removed icon is gone. However, the condition `z < cnt` (with cnt being the new total) is actually checking if the removed icon was in the part of the grid that is now the good region? But note: the good region is the first `cnt` cells. The removed icon might be at a position that is beyond the new good region? Then we don't subtract.\n\n            # Actually, the condition at the end: `if z < cnt` is intended to account for the removal of an icon that was in the new good region? But note: the new good region is the first `cnt` cells. The removed icon was at z. If z is in the new good region (z < cnt) then we subtract one. But what if the removed icon was in the old good region but not in the new good region? Then we don't subtract? That is correct: because in the old state, the good region was [0, old_cnt-1] = [0, cnt] (since old_cnt = cnt+1). The new good region is [0, cnt-1]. The removed icon might be at z = cnt (which is the last cell of the old good region) and that is not in the new good region? So we don't subtract for that icon? But we must: because in the old state, that icon was counted as correct (because it was in the old good region). And now we are removing it, so we lose one correct icon.\n\n            # Therefore, the condition at the end should be: if z < old_cnt (which is cnt+1) then subtract one. But we don't have old_cnt stored. However, note that the condition `z < cnt+1` is always true? Because the linear index z is in the range [0, n*m-1] and cnt (after removal) is at most n*m? But we know that the total number of icons is cnt (after removal) and z is a valid index. But note: we are removing an icon that exists, so z must be in the current set? And the current set of icons is stored in the array `a`? Actually, we are using the array `m` to mark presence.\n\n            # How about: we subtract one for the removed icon if it was in the old good region? And the old good region was [0, old_cnt-1] = [0, cnt] (because we did cnt -= 1, so old_cnt = cnt+1). So we can do:\n\n            #   correct -= 1   # because the removed icon was in the old good region? But wait: what if the removed icon was beyond the old good region? Then we shouldn't subtract.\n\n            # So we must check: if z < old_cnt, then subtract one. Since old_cnt = cnt+1 (after we did cnt-=1, so the current cnt is old_cnt-1), then we can write:\n\n            #   if z < cnt+1:\n            #       correct -= 1\n\n            # But note: we are going to do the check for the cell at cnt (which is the new last cell) and then the check for the removed icon.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can restructure:\n\n            #   old_cnt = cnt   [so we remember the old total]\n            #   cnt -= 1\n            #   if m[cnt] == 1:\n            #       correct -= 1\n            #   m[z] = 0\n            #   if z < old_cnt:\n            #       correct -= 1\n\n            # But the problem is that we are not allowed to change the structure arbitrarily? We can only fill the TODO.\n\n            # Looking at the code: we are only allowed to fill the TODO line.\n\n            # The current code after the TODO is:\n\n            #   m[z] = 0\n            #   if z < cnt:\n            #       correct -= 1\n\n            # But we see that the condition `if z < cnt` is not sufficient: we need `if z < old_cnt` (which is cnt+1). However, we cannot change the condition.\n\n            # Alternatively, note that the condition `if z < cnt` (with cnt being the new total) is equivalent to `if z < old_cnt-1`. But we need `if z < old_cnt`.\n\n            # How about we adjust the value of `correct` for the removed icon in the TODO block? We note that the removed icon is at z. We know that in the old state, the good region was [0, old_cnt-1]. So if z < old_cnt, then the icon was in the good region and we must subtract one. But we are about to do:\n\n            #   if m[cnt] == 1: ...   [then we subtract one for the icon at cnt]\n            #   then we set m[z]=0\n            #   then we do: if z < cnt: ...   [which is if z < old_cnt-1, then subtract one]\n\n            # So we are missing the case when z == old_cnt-1? Then we subtract one for the icon at cnt (if present) and then we do nothing for the removed icon? But the removed icon at z = old_cnt-1 was in the old good region and we must subtract one.\n\n            # Therefore, we can do in the TODO block:\n\n            #   correct -= 1   # because the removed icon was in the old good region? But wait: what if the removed icon was beyond the old good region? Then we shouldn't subtract.\n\n            # But note: the TODO block is inside the else branch for removal and we know that the icon exists at z. The old good region was [0, old_cnt-1]. The removed icon is at z. We must subtract one if and only if z < old_cnt. But old_cnt = cnt (before we decrement) and we are about to decrement. So we can do:\n\n            #   if z < cnt:   # because cnt is still the old total? But we just did `cnt -= 1`? So we cannot.\n\n            # Actually, we did `cnt -= 1` already. So we have to use `cnt+1` for the old total.\n\n            # Therefore, we can do:\n\n            #   if z < cnt+1:\n            #       correct -= 1\n\n            # But note: we are going to do an additional adjustment for the icon at cnt (if present) and then for the removed icon (if z < cnt) later. So if we do:\n\n            #   if m[cnt] == 1:\n            #       correct -= 1\n            #   if z < cnt+1 and z != cnt:   # then we subtract one for the removed icon? But wait, we are going to subtract again in the next condition if z < cnt? Then we would subtract twice for the same icon if z < cnt.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can note that the total adjustment for the removed icon is: subtract one if the icon was in the old good region (z < old_cnt). And then separately, we subtract one for the icon at cnt (if present) because it is now beyond the good region.\n\n            # But the condition at the end: `if z < cnt: correct -= 1` is not needed if we do the full adjustment here? However, the code structure is fixed.\n\n            # Let me reexamine the entire removal branch as it is written:\n\n            #   else:\n            #       cnt -= 1\n            #       if m[cnt] == 1:\n            #           # TODO: Your code here\n            #       m[z] = 0\n            #       if z < cnt:\n            #           correct -= 1\n\n            # We want to account for two things:\n            #   A. The icon at the new last cell (index cnt) is now beyond the good region -> if present, subtract one.\n            #   B. The removed icon was in the old good region -> subtract one.\n\n            # But note: the removed icon might be the same as the icon at cnt? Only if z == cnt. But we are removing the icon at z, and then we are checking the cell at cnt. If z == cnt, then after removal, the cell at cnt is now empty? But we haven't set m[z]=0 yet when we check m[cnt]? So if z == cnt, then when we check m[cnt], we are checking the same cell that we are about to remove. And we see m[cnt]==1 (because we are in the removal branch, so it was 1). Then we do the TODO block. Then we set m[z]=0. Then we do the last condition: if z < cnt? But if z==cnt, then z is not less than cnt? So we don't do the last condition.\n\n            # Therefore, the TODO block must account for the fact that the removed icon might be at the boundary.\n\n            # How about: we always subtract one for the removed icon in the TODO block? But then we would be subtracting one for every removal? And then the last condition would subtract again if the removed icon is in the new good region? That would be double subtraction for some icons.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            #   In the TODO block: subtract one for the icon at cnt (if present) and also subtract one for the removed icon if it was in the old good region and not at cnt? But that is messy.\n\n            # Let me try with an example:\n\n            # Example: n=1, m=3, initially: [1, 1, 0] (meaning two icons: at positions 0 and 1). Then cnt=2, correct=2 (because both are in the first 2 cells).\n\n            # Now remove the icon at position 1 (z=1):\n            #   cnt becomes 1.\n            #   then we check m[cnt] = m[1]: which is 1 -> so we do TODO.\n            #   then set m[1]=0.\n            #   then check if z (1) < cnt (1) -> false.\n\n            # What should be the state? After removal, we have one icon at position 0. The good region is the first 1 cell -> so the icon at 0 is correct. Therefore, correct should be 1. But initially correct was 2. We removed an icon that was in the old good region (at position 1) and also we removed the icon at position 1 which is now beyond the good region? But note: the icon at position 1 was in the old good region (which was [0,1]) and we remove it, so we lose one correct icon. Also, the cell at the new last cell (index 1) is now beyond the good region and had an icon? But we are removing that icon, so it's gone. So the only icon is at 0 and it is correct -> correct=1.\n\n            # How did we get from 2 to 1? We did one subtraction in the TODO block. So the TODO block should be: `correct -= 1`.\n\n            # But then what about the removed icon? We also need to account for its removal from the good region? But note: the TODO block is intended for the cell at cnt (which is index 1) and that cell is the one we are removing? In this case, yes. So we are subtracting one for the removed icon via the TODO block.\n\n            # And then we set m[1]=0 and then we don't do the last condition.\n\n            # Now remove the icon at position 0 (z=0) from the new state (which has only the icon at 0):\n            #   cnt becomes 0.\n            #   then we check m[cnt] = m[0]: which is 1 -> so we do TODO: correct -= 1.\n            #   then set m[0]=0.\n            #   then check if z (0) < cnt (0) -> false.\n\n            # After removal, we have no icons. correct should be 0. Initially correct was 1. We subtracted one in the TODO block -> correct=0.\n\n            # Now consider removing an icon that is not at the boundary. For example, from the initial state (two icons at 0 and 1), remove the icon at 0:\n            #   cnt becomes 1.\n            #   check m[cnt] = m[1]: which is 1 -> so we do TODO: correct -= 1 -> correct becomes 1.\n            #   set m[0]=0.\n            #   then check if z (0) < cnt (1) -> true, so correct -= 1 -> correct becomes 0.\n\n            # But after removal, we have one icon at position 1. The good region is the first 1 cell. The icon at 1 is not in the good region? Because the good region is only cell 0. So correct should be 0. That matches.\n\n            # However, what should correct be? Initially, we had two icons: both in the good region -> correct=2.\n            # After removal of the icon at 0:\n            #   We lose the icon at 0: so we should subtract one -> correct=1.\n            #   Then we note that the cell at the new last cell (index 1) has an icon and is now beyond the good region? So we subtract one -> correct=0.\n\n            # But also, the last condition: we then subtract one because the removed icon was at 0 which is in the new good region? But wait, the new good region is [0,0] (only cell 0). The removed icon was at 0, which is in the new good region? But we are removing it, so we lose one correct icon? But we already accounted for that when we did the TODO block? Actually, no: the TODO block was for the cell at index 1.\n\n            # How did we get two subtractions? We did:\n            #   TODO block: subtract one for the cell at index 1 (which is now beyond) -> correct becomes 1.\n            #   then we set m[0]=0.\n            #   then we subtract one for the removed icon because it is in the new good region (0<1) -> correct becomes 0.\n\n            # But the removed icon was in the old good region (at index 0) and we haven't subtracted for that yet? The TODO block did not account for the removed icon at 0.\n\n            # In the old state, the good region was [0,1]. The removed icon at 0 was in the good region -> we must subtract one. The TODO block subtracted one for the cell at index 1 (which is now beyond) -> that is one subtraction. Then the last condition subtracts one for the removed icon at 0 (because it is in the new good region) -> that is a second subtraction. But the new good region is [0,0] and the removed icon is at 0, which is in the new good region? But we are removing it, so it is no longer there. However, in the new state, the good region is [0,0] and there is no icon at 0 (we removed it) and there is an icon at 1 which is beyond. So the number of correct icons is 0.\n\n            # How many subtractions do we need? We need to account for:\n            #   - The removed icon: it was in the old good region -> subtract one.\n            #   - The icon at index 1: it is now beyond the good region -> subtract one.\n\n            # That is two subtractions. And we did two: one in the TODO block and one in the last condition.\n\n            # But note: the last condition is only applied if the removed icon is in the new good region. In this case, the removed icon is at 0, which is in the new good region? But the new good region is defined for the new state? And the new state has the good region [0,0]. The removed icon is at 0, which is in the new good region, but we are removing it -> so we are removing an icon that would have been correctly placed in the new state? However, in the new state, that icon is gone. So the condition is not about the new state per se, but about the location of the removed icon relative to the new good region? \n\n            # Actually, the condition `if z < cnt` (with cnt being the new total) is intended to account for the fact that the removed icon was in the new good region? But in the new state, the good region is [0, cnt-1] = [0,0] (since cnt=1). The removed icon at 0 is in that region. So we are removing an icon that is in the new good region -> we must subtract one.\n\n            # But wait: in the new state, the good region is [0,0] and there is no icon at 0? So the number of correct icons in the new state is 0. The old state had two correct icons. We removed one correct icon (at 0) and also the icon at 1 is now beyond -> so we lost two correct icons.\n\n            # Therefore, the two subtractions are needed.\n\n            # Now, what if the removed icon is beyond the new good region? For example, remove an icon at index 2 from an initial state of three icons at 0,1,2 (cnt=3, correct=3). \n            #   cnt becomes 2.\n            #   check m[2] (the new last cell) -> but wait, the new last cell is index 2? No, the new good region is the first 2 cells: indices 0 and 1. So we check m[2] (which is the cell beyond) -> but we are removing the icon at 2, so initially m[2]=1. Then we do TODO: correct -= 1 -> correct becomes 2.\n            #   then set m[2]=0.\n            #   then check if z (2) < cnt (2) -> false.\n            #   so correct becomes 2.\n\n            # But after removal, we have two icons at 0 and 1, which are in the good region -> correct=2. That matches.\n\n            # However, we only did one subtraction: from 3 to 2. But we removed an icon that was in the old good region (at index 2) -> the old good region was [0,2] (because old_cnt=3). So we should subtract one for that. And also, the cell at index 2 is now beyond the good region and had an icon? But we removed it, so it's gone. So we only need to account for the removal of the icon at 2? But the TODO block did that.\n\n            # In summary, the TODO block is used to subtract one for the cell at the new last cell (index cnt) if it has an icon, and that accounts for the fact that that cell is now beyond the good region. But note: in this example, the cell at index 2 had an icon and we are removing it, so we are not leaving an icon at index 2. Why are we subtracting? Because in the old state, the cell at index 2 was in the good region (so it was counted in `correct`). When we remove it, we lose that correct icon. And also, after removal, the good region shrinks to [0,1] and the cell at index 2 is now beyond, but we are removing the icon at 2, so there is no icon left at 2. So the TODO block is not about leaving an icon beyond, but about the fact that the cell at index 2 was in the good region in the old state and we are removing it? But wait, we are removing it anyway. \n\n            # Actually, the TODO block is not needed for the removed icon at 2? Because we are about to remove it and then we will not have an icon at 2. But then why did we subtract one? \n\n            # Let me reexamine the addition branch for symmetry:\n\n            #   if m[z] == 0:\n            #       if m[cnt] == 1:\n            #           correct += 1\n            #       m[z] = 1\n            #       cnt += 1\n            #       if z < cnt:\n            #           correct += 1\n\n            # When we add an icon, we first check: if the cell at the current last cell (index cnt) has an icon, then we add one. Why? Because when we add an icon, the good region expands to include cell cnt. So if there was already an icon at cnt, it becomes correct. Then we add the new icon and if it is in the new good region (z < cnt+1) then we add one.\n\n            # In removal, we are doing the reverse:\n\n            #   We are removing an icon. We first shrink the good region (by decrementing cnt). Then we check: if the cell at the new last cell (which is now beyond the good region) has an icon, then we must subtract one because that icon is no longer in the good region. But note: that cell might not be the one we are removing.\n\n            #   Then we remove the icon at z.\n\n            #   Then we check: if the removed icon was in the new good region, then we must subtract one? But wait, the new good region is defined for the new state. The removed icon might be in the new good region or not. If it is in the new good region, then we are removing an icon that is correctly placed in the new state? But in the new state, that icon is gone, so we lose one correct icon.\n\n            # However, note: the removed icon might have been beyond the new good region. Then we don't lose a correct icon in the new state.\n\n            # But also, in the old state, the removed icon might have been in the old good region. We already accounted for that in the TODO block? No, the TODO block was for the cell at the new last cell (which is now beyond) and that cell might be different.\n\n            # Therefore, the TODO block is only for the cell at the new last cell (index cnt) and not for the removed icon.\n\n            # And the removed icon is accounted for in the last condition: if it is in the new good region, then we subtract one.\n\n            # But then why in the example of removing the icon at index 1 (from the state [1,1,0]) we did the TODO block and then not the last condition, and it worked? In that example, the removed icon was at index 1, and the new good region is [0,0]. The removed icon is not in the new good region? So we shouldn't subtract in the last condition. But we did subtract in the TODO block for the cell at index 1, and that was the removed icon? \n\n            # Actually, in that example, the TODO block is for the cell at index 1 (which is the new last cell) and that cell has an icon (before removal) so we subtract one. Then we remove the icon at index 1 (so we set m[1]=0). Then we do the last condition: if 1<0? false. So we only did one subtraction.\n\n            # But the removed icon was in the old good region (index 1 < old_cnt=2) -> so we should subtract one for that. And the TODO block did that.\n\n            # In the example of removing the icon at index 0 from the state [1,1,0]:\n            #   We do TODO block: because the new last cell (index 1) has an icon, we subtract one -> correct becomes 1.\n            #   Then we remove the icon at 0: set m[0]=0.\n            #   Then we do: if 0<1 -> true, so we subtract one -> correct becomes 0.\n            #   This accounts for the removed icon at 0 (which was in the new good region) and also for the icon at 1 that is now beyond.\n\n            # But the removed icon at 0 was in the old good region? Yes, and we haven't explicitly accounted for that. However, the last condition accounts for it because it is in the new good region? But note: the new good region is [0,0] and the removed icon is at 0, which is in the new good region. So we are removing an icon that is in the new good region -> we lose one correct icon in the new state. And the TODO block accounts for the icon at 1 that is now beyond.\n\n            # Therefore, the TODO block is only for the cell at the new last cell (index cnt) and we do not explicitly account for the removed icon being in the old good region in the TODO block. The last condition accounts for the removed icon being in the new good region.\n\n            # But is that sufficient? Consider removing an icon that is in the old good region but not in the new good region. For example, from the state with three icons at 0,1,2 (cnt=3, correct=3), remove the icon at index 2 (which is the last cell of the old good region). \n            #   cnt becomes 2.\n            #   check m[2]: it is 1 -> so we do TODO: correct -= 1 -> correct=2.\n            #   set m[2]=0.\n            #   then check if 2<2 -> false.\n            #   so correct=2.\n\n            # After removal, we have icons at 0 and 1, which are in the new good region [0,1] -> correct=2. That matches.\n\n            # But the removed icon was in the old good region (index 2 < 3) and we haven't subtracted for it explicitly? However, we did subtract in the TODO block for the cell at index 2. And that cell is the removed icon. So it is accounted for.\n\n            # Now consider removing an icon that is in the old good region but not at the new last cell. For example, from the state with three icons at 0,1,2, remove the icon at index 0.\n            #   cnt becomes 2.\n            #   check m[2] (the new last cell) -> it has an icon? yes, so we do TODO: correct -= 1 -> correct=2.\n            #   set m[0]=0.\n            #   then check if 0<2 -> true, so correct -= 1 -> correct=1.\n\n            # After removal, we have icons at 1 and 2. The good region is [0,1]. The icon at 1 is in the good region, the icon at 2 is beyond. So correct=1. That matches.\n\n            # Therefore, the TODO block is simply: `correct -= 1` whenever we find that the new last cell (index cnt) has an icon.\n\n            # Why? Because that cell is now beyond the good region, so if it has an icon, that icon is no longer correct. And in the case that the removed icon is at that cell, then we are removing it anyway, but we are also accounting for the fact that it was in the old good region by this subtraction.\n\n            # But note: if the removed icon is at a different cell, then the cell at cnt might have an icon that is not the removed one, and we are not removing that icon, so it becomes incorrectly placed.\n\n            # Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n            #   correct -= 1\n\n            # But only if m[cnt]==1? We are inside an if that checks m[cnt]==1.\n\n            # So we can write:\n\n            #   correct -= 1\n\n            # And that's it.\n\n            # Let me test with the provided example in the problem? But we don't have one.\n\n            # Given the above examples, it seems to work.\n\n            # Therefore, the missing line is: `correct -= 1`\n\n        else:\n            cnt -= 1\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct -= 1   # TODO: fill this\n            m[z] = 0\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct -= 1\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is: \"correct -= 1\"\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about finding the roundest price: the one with the most trailing zeros. We are allowed to multiply n by an integer k in [1, m]. If there are multiple with the same number of trailing zeros, choose the largest one.\n\nThe code decomposes n as: n = 2^a * 5^b * c.\n\nThen it tries to balance the exponents of 2 and 5 by multiplying by 5 or 2 until they are equal or we run out of m.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to complete the TODO block.\n\nIn the case b > a, we want to multiply by 2 as long as we can (without exceeding m) to reduce the difference. So we should multiply t by 2 and increment a by one? But note: we are not changing a and b? Actually, we are not decomposing n again. The variable t is the factor we are going to multiply by. We are going to multiply n by t and then by 10 as much as possible.\n\nBut in the while loop, we are increasing the exponent of 2? So we should do:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1   # but wait, we don't have a variable a in this branch? \n\nBut look: the code has:\n\n    a = b = 0\n    c = n\n    while c % 2 == 0:\n        a += 1\n        c //= 2\n    while c % 5 == 0:\n        b += 1\n        c //= 5\n\nThen we have t=1.\n\nIn the branch b>a, we want to multiply by 2 to increase a until a==b? But note: we are not actually changing the decomposition of n, we are building a factor t that will be multiplied to n. The factor t will be a multiple of 2^(b-a) if possible? But we are limited by m.\n\nSo the TODO block should be:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1   # but we don't have a in this branch? Actually, we don't. And we don't use a again in the branch? \n\nBut note: the condition is `while b > a and ...`. We are not updating a? Then the condition `b>a` would be always true? That would be an infinite loop.\n\nWe must update a? But a is not defined in the branch. Alternatively, we can update a by doing `a += 1`? But we are in the branch where b>a, and we are multiplying by 2, so the exponent of 2 in the overall number becomes a+1? But we are not storing that.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: we are only using the condition on the difference (b - a). We can maintain the difference? But the code doesn't.\n\nLooking at the symmetric branch for a>b: we do `b += 1` (which is updating the exponent of 5) and then the condition `a > b` becomes `a > b+1`? So we are reducing the difference.\n\nSimilarly, in the branch b>a, we should do `a += 1` to reduce the difference.\n\nBut note: the variable a is defined in the outer scope. We can update it.\n\nSo the TODO block should be:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut let me test with an example: n=5, m=43. Then a=0, b=1. We enter the branch b>a. Then we do:\n   t=1 -> multiply by 2: t=2, a=1 -> now a==b, so we break.\nThen we do: while 10*t<=m: t=2 -> 20<=43 -> t=20. Then we do: m - (m%t) = 43 - (43 mod 20) = 43-3=40. Then n*k = 5*40=200. Which is the expected answer.\n\nAnother example: n=13, m=5. Then a=0, b=0. We skip both branches. Then we do: while 10*t<=m: t=1 -> 10<=5? false. Then k = m - (m%1) = 5. Then output 13*5=65.\n\nBut what if we have n=10, m=1? Then a=1, b=1. Skip both branches. Then we do: while 10*t<=m: t=1 -> 10<=1? false. Then k=1, output=10.\n\nBut what if n=10, m=10? Then we do: while 10*t<=10 -> t=1 -> 10<=10 -> then t=10. Then k = 10 - (10%10)=10. Then output=100.\n\nBut what if n=10, m=15? Then we can do t=10 (because 10*10<=15? no, 10*10=100>15). So we break at t=1? Then k=15 - (15%1)=15. Then output=150. But 150 has one trailing zero. Alternatively, we could do k=10: then 10*10=100, which has two trailing zeros. So 100 is rounder than 150.\n\nThe issue: the while loop multiplies t by 10 as long as 10*t<=m. But after we balance the 2s and 5s, we have a factor t that we can use to get at least one trailing zero. Then we can multiply by 10 as long as we can (without exceeding m) to get more trailing zeros.\n\nBut in the example n=10, m=15: \n   n = 10 = 2^1 * 5^1 * 1 -> a=1, b=1 -> skip the balancing.\n   then we do: t=1 -> then we can multiply by 10: 10*1=10<=15 -> so t becomes 10.\n   then we try 10*10=100>15 -> so we stop.\n   then k = m - (m%t) = 15 - (15%10)=15-5=10.\n   then n*k=10*10=100.\n\nThat is correct.\n\nBut what if n=2, m=10? \n   a=1, b=0.\n   then we are in the branch a>b: we do while a>0 and 5*t<=10: t=5, then a>0? still, then 5*5=25>10 -> break. So t=5.\n   then we do: while 10*t<=10? 50<=10? false. So k = 10 - (10%5)=10-0=10. Then output=2*10=20.\n\nBut 20 has one trailing zero. Alternatively, we could do k=5: 2*5=10, which has one trailing zero. But the problem says: if there are several with the same roundness, output the one with the largest new price. 20>10, so 20 is chosen. That is correct.\n\nTherefore, the TODO block is: \n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut note: the variable a is defined in the outer scope. We are in the branch `elif b > a:`, so we can update a.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code is: \n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nFor program3.py:\nThe problem is about counting the number of trees (with a specific structure: vertex i for i>=2 is connected to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) such that vertex i is the centroid. The answer modulo 998244353.\n\nThe code sets up factorials and inverse factorials. Then it computes an array `out` for i in range((n+1)//2). Then it does a backward update.\n\nThe missing part is the function `inv(x)` which should compute the modular inverse of x modulo MOD.\n\nWe can use Fermat's little theorem: since MOD is prime, the inverse of x is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: what if x is 0? The problem states that n>=3 and is odd, and we are computing factorials for numbers up to MAX-1 (which is 10**6). So x will be at least 1? But we might call inv(0) if we have a zero? We should avoid that.\n\nLooking at the code: we compute fact and invfact for indices up to MAX-1. The function `inv` is called in the computation of `invfact`:\n\n    invfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\n\nSo fact[MAX-1] is non-zero.\n\nAlso, in the function `invs(x)`:\n\n    return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\nThis is the inverse of x? Because fact[x-1] * invfact[x] = ( (x-1)! ) / (x!) = 1/x.\n\nSo `invs(x)` returns 1/x mod MOD.\n\nTherefore, the function `inv(x)` is only called on non-zero x.\n\nSo we can safely compute the inverse with pow(x, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the function `inv` is defined as:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we return the power.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm, but the modulus is prime and the exponentiation is efficient.\n\nSo the code is:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nNow, we output the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\nSummary:\n\nprogram1: \"correct -= 1\"\nprogram2: \n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\nprogram3: \n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: for program2, the code is two lines. We must output both.\n\nFor program3, we must be careful: the function `inv` should return the value.\n\nLet me write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"correct -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\",\n  \"program3\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1 it is one line, for program2 it is two lines, and for program3 it is one line.\n\nHowever, in program2, the TODO is in a while loop. We must preserve the indentation.\n\nIn program2, the existing code in the while loop is:\n\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with two lines. The existing code has 8 spaces of indentation for the while loop, and then the TODO is a comment. We should output the two lines with the same indentation? The problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo for program2, we output:\n\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the while loop body. The TODO is at that indentation. We output two lines with 8 spaces each? Or one level of indentation? The problem does not specify the exact indentation level, but we should match the context.\n\nIn the provided code for program2, the while loop in the symmetric branch (a>b) has:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nSo the body is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the while). Similarly, we should do 8 spaces for the two lines in the else branch.\n\nBut the TODO is currently at 12 spaces? Actually, the while loop is at 4 spaces (from the for loop) and the body is indented by 4 more (so 8). The TODO is a comment at 12 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at the same level as the body of the while loop in the a>b branch? So we should output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the entire block is indented. The code for the a>b branch has two lines: \n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nSo we output two lines with the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut wait, the existing code for the a>b branch has 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the structure:\n\nfor n, m in ...:\n    a = b = 0\n    ... \n    if a > b:\n        while ...:\n            t *= 5   # this line is indented by 8 spaces from the for loop? \n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while ...:\n            ...   # TODO\n\nThe for loop is at 0, the if/elif is at 4, the while is at 8, and the body of the while is at 12.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We are to fill the TODO block. The TODO block is the body of the while loop in the elif branch. So we output two lines, each with 12 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, to match the context, we should use the same indentation as the symmetric branch.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would replace the TODO. Since the TODO is at the same level as the body of the while in the a>b branch, we output:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nwith the same indentation as the body of the while in the a>b branch (which is 8 spaces from the while, but 12 from the outer for). But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, in the provided code for the a>b branch, the body is two lines: \"t *= 5\" and \"b += 1\", each at the same indentation level.\n\nSo we output two lines: \"t *= 2\" and \"a += 1\", with the same indentation as the while loop body in the a>b branch.\n\nBut to be safe, we can output the two lines with 8 spaces of indentation relative to the while loop? Actually, the while loop is at 8 spaces (from the start of the line of the for loop). The body should be 4 more? So 12 in total? \n\nBut the problem does not require the exact indentation? It says the missing code. We'll assume the environment will adjust the indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code as it would appear in the program. Since the symmetric branch has:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nwe output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nwith 12 spaces at the beginning of each line? But the entire program uses 4-space indentation? \n\nActually, the code for program2 is:\n\nfrom sys import stdin, stderr\n\ndata = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n\nns, ms = data[::2], data[1::2]\n\noutput = []\nfor n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n    # n = 2 ** a * 5 ** b * c\n    a = b = 0\n    c = n\n    while c % 2 == 0:\n        a += 1\n        c //= 2\n    while c % 5 == 0:\n        b += 1\n        c //= 5\n    t = 1  # our result should be a multiple of t\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    while 10 * t <= m:\n        t *= 10\n    #print(n, m, t, file=stderr)\n    output.append(n * (m - (m % t)))\n\nprint('\\n'.join(str(x) for x in output))\n\nThe TODO is at the same level as the two lines in the a>b branch. So we replace the TODO with:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the two lines in the a>b branch are at the same indentation as the TODO comment. So we output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut the TODO comment is at 8 spaces from the for loop? Actually, the for loop is at 0, the if/elif at 4, the while at 8, and the body at 12. The TODO comment is at 12. So we output two lines at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we output the two lines as they would appear in the program, with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nTherefore, for program2, we output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nSimilarly, for program1, the missing code is one line: \"correct -= 1\", and it is at the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nFor program3, the missing code is one line: \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning to match the function body).\n\nBut note: the function `inv` in program3 is:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut the function body is indented by 4 spaces. So we output:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nwith 4 spaces.\n\nNow, we write the JSON.\n\nNote: the JSON must be valid. We use double quotes.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"correct -= 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\",\n    \"program3\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut wait, in program2, the existing code has 12 spaces for the body of the while loop? Then we output 12 spaces for each line? But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, to be safe, we output the same as in the symmetric branch.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the spaces in the provided code for the symmetric branch. The symmetric branch has:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nwhich is 12 spaces per line? (because the while loop is at 8 spaces and the body is 4 more). So we output 12 spaces for each line? But in a string, we represent that as 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? It says the missing code. The environment will put it in the right context.\n\nHowever, to be precise, we output the code as it would appear in the program. Since the symmetric branch has two lines with 12 spaces, we output two lines with 12 spaces.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we must escape newlines as \\n.\n\nSo for program2: \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the symmetric branch has 12 spaces? Actually, let me count:\n\nThe code for the a>b branch:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nThe first line of the while is at 8 spaces (from the for loop). The body is at 12 spaces. So we output two lines with 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the string for program2 is 12 spaces + \"t *= 2\" and then newline and then 12 spaces + \"a += 1\".\n\nSimilarly, for program1, the code is at the same indentation as the surrounding, which is 12 spaces? The removal branch:\n\n        else:\n            cnt -= 1\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            m[z] = 0\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct -= 1\n\nThe TODO is at 16 spaces? Actually, the else is at 4, the cnt-=1 at 8, the if at 8, and the TODO at 12? \n\nBut the symmetric branch in the addition had:\n\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct += 1\n\nat 12 spaces. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces? But the problem says to output only the code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at 12 spaces, so we output \"correct -= 1\" without any extra spaces? Because the environment will put it at the same indentation.\n\nBut to be safe, we output the exact string that would replace the TODO. The TODO is a comment. We replace it with \"correct -= 1\", and the indentation is already there? \n\nThe problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing, without the surrounding. So we output \"correct -= 1\" without any indentation.\n\nBut then the program would break because of indentation. So we must output the code with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify. But the example of the symmetric branch in the addition has \"correct += 1\" at 12 spaces. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the JSON string would then have 12 spaces at the beginning. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we note that the TODO is at the same level as the comment, so we output the code at the same level.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will output the code without any extra indentation. The environment will place it correctly.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so for program1, it is \"correct -= 1\", for program2, it is two lines: \"t *= 2\" and \"a += 1\", and for program3, it is \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\".\n\nBut to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation as the surrounding.\n\nWe decide:\n\nprogram1: the TODO is at 12 spaces? The code we output is at 12 spaces: \"    correct -= 1\" (with 4 spaces) but actually the surrounding if is at 8 spaces and the body should be 12. But the symmetric branch in the addition had 4 spaces for the body? Actually, the addition branch:\n\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct += 1\n\nThe body of the if is at 16 spaces? \n\nLet me count the spaces in the addition branch:\n\n        if m[z] == 0:\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                correct += 1\n            m[z] = 1\n            cnt += 1\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct += 1\n\nThe inner if is at 8 spaces (from the outer if) and its body is at 12 spaces. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces? But 12 spaces is 3 tabs? We avoid tabs and use spaces.\n\nBut in the removal branch, the TODO is at:\n\n        else:\n            cnt -= 1\n            if m[cnt] == 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            m[z] = 0\n            if z < cnt:\n                correct -= 1\n\nThe else is at 4, the cnt at 8, the if at 8, and the TODO at 12. So we output \"correct -= 1\" at 12 spaces.\n\nBut in a string, we represent 12 spaces as 12 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the TODO is at 12 spaces, and we output two lines at 12 spaces.\n\nFor program3, the function body is at 4 spaces, and the return statement should be at 8 spaces? But the function is:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with a return statement at 8 spaces? But the function body is indented by 4, so the return should be indented by 8? \n\nBut the existing code in the function `modmul` is:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nwhich is 4 spaces for the function and 8 for the body.\n\nSo we output:\n\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nwith 8 spaces? But the TODO is at 4 spaces? We output 8 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the body of the function, which is one line: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\", and it should be indented by 4 more spaces.\n\nTherefore, for program3, we output:\n\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nwith 8 spaces at the beginning? But the function header is at 0, and the body should be 4. Actually, the function header is at 4 (because the whole program is indented by 0). The function body is 8? \n\nLet me see the provided code for program3:\n\nMOD = 998244353\r\n\r\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\r\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\r\n\r\ndef inv(x):\r\n    # TODO: Your code here\r\n\r\nMAX = 10 ** 6\r\n...\n\nThe function `modmul` has a body at 4 spaces. The function `inv` has a TODO at 4 spaces. So we output the return statement at 4 spaces? \n\nBut the function `modmul` has 4 spaces for the body? Actually, the return is at 4 spaces? \n\nIn Python, the function body is indented by 4 spaces. So we output:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nwith 4 spaces.\n\nBut the TODO is at 4 spaces. So we output one line with 4 spaces and then the code.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    correct -= 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\",\n    \"program3\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut wait, for program1, the TODO is at 12 spaces, and we output 4 spaces? That doesn't match. \n\nWe must be consistent. Since the problem does not specify, and to avoid overcomplicating, we output the code without any extra indentation. The environment will put it at the correct indentation.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram1: \"correct -= 1\"\nprogram2: \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\nprogram3: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut then the indentation might be off.\n\nGiven the instructions, I think we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the correct indentation.\n\nAfter re-thinking, I will output:\n\nprogram1: 8 spaces are for the if block, and the body of the if should be 4 more -> 12 spaces. But the symmetric branch in the addition has 12 spaces for the body. So program1: \"    correct -= 1\" (which is 4 spaces) is not enough. We need 12 spaces? \n\nBut 12 spaces is a string of 12 spaces. We do:\n\n    \"program1\": \"            correct -= 1\"\n\nSimilarly, program2: 12 spaces for each line:\n\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\nprogram3: 4 spaces for the return (because the function body is 4 spaces):\n\n    \"program3\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut wait, in program3, the function body is 4 spaces, so the return should be at 4 spaces. But the TODO is at 4 spaces. So we output \"    return ...\" (4 spaces).\n\nBut the function header is at 0? No, the function header is at 0 indentation? The function is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    ...\n\nThe body is indented by 4 spaces. So the return should be at 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
