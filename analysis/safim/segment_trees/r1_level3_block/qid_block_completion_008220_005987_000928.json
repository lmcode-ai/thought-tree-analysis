We can do:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks] But why? \n\nLet me explain: \n  We want to add the possibility of taking a move of size j (which is a multiple of ks). The minimal move at this step is ks (so j=ks, 2*ks, ...). Then: \n      dp2[i] = dp[i - ks] + dp[i - 2*ks] + ... \n\n  But note that we can write:\n      dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\n  Why? Because if we subtract ks from i, then the term for j=ks would be dp[i-ks], and the terms for j=2*ks, 3*ks, ... would be the same as dp2[i-ks] (which already includes the sum for multiples at the position i-ks). However, wait: the state dp2[i-ks] is for the same step s? But we are building dp2 in the same inner loop. Actually, we are building dp2 in increasing order of i. So when we are at i, we have already computed dp2[i-ks]. But note: the recurrence for the same step s: \n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nThis recurrence is correct because:\n  The ways to get to i with s moves is:\n      - the ways to get to i-ks with s moves (and then add a move of ks) -> but wait, that would be the same as having already taken the move of ks? Actually, no: we are only taking one move of ks? But note: we are breaking the move into one step of ks? Actually, we are taking one move of any multiple of ks. So:\n\n  We can take a move of ks: then we come from i-ks (with s-1 moves) and then add a move of ks -> that gives dp[i-ks] (because the state for s-1 moves at i-ks is dp[i-ks]). Then we can take a move of 2*ks: then we come from i-2*ks (with s-1 moves) -> that gives dp[i-2*ks]. But note: we can also take a move of 3*ks, etc. However, the recurrence above does not account for that. The recurrence:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nwould then be:\n\n  dp2[i] = (dp[i-ks] + dp[i-2*ks] + ... )   but wait: dp2[i-ks] = dp[i-ks-ks] + dp[i-ks]? Actually, if we define:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp[i] for the first step? But we are building dp2 for step s. We can use:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nThis recurrence is standard for the coin problem when we are allowed to use the same coin multiple times? But note: we are not.

Actually, we should. The problem says modulo 998244353. So:\n\n    dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353 But wait: the state `dp` is from the previous step (s-1) and `dp2` is the current step (s). And we are iterating from `first` to `n`. However, note that `i - ks` might be negative? But we start at `first` which is at least ks (because first = ... and we break if first>n+1, but first is at least ks). Actually, first = (ks*(ks+1)//2 - ((k-1)*k//2) which is the minimal displacement for s moves. And ks is the step for the last move. So i starts at first, which is at least ks (for s>=1, but s starts at 2 so ks>=k+1). Therefore, i-ks is at least first-ks, which is nonnegative? But let's check: first = (ks*(ks+1)//2 - (k-1)*k//2\n  and ks = k+s-1. We can compute: \n  first = ( (k+s-1)*(k+s) // 2 ) - ( (k-1)*k // 2 ) But note: the minimal displacement for s moves is the sum of the minimal moves: k, k+1, ..., k+s-1 = s*(2*k+s-1)//2. So first = s*(2*k+s-1)//2. Then i starts at first, so i-ks = first - ks = s*(2*k+s-1)//2 - (k+s-1). This is nonnegative? For s=2: \n  first = 2*(2*k+1)//2 = 2*k+1\n  ks = k+1\n  first - ks = (2*k+1) - (k+1) = k >=1 (given k>=1) -> nonnegative. So we are safe. Therefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n    dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\n\nBut note: the problem says that the moves can be in any order?",

Actually, the example says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below.\" and the sample input n=3 -> output 3. But the precomputation:\n\n  Step0: s=0, tot=0 -> cnt[0]=0\n  Step1: i=0 -> tot += 2*(0 - ctr[0]) = 2*(0-0)=0 -> then set ctr[0]=1, s=1 -> cnt[1]=0? Step2: i=1 -> tot += 2*(1 - ctr[1]) = 2*(1-0)=2 -> then ctr[1]=1, s=2 -> cnt[2]=2\n  Step3: i=2 -> tot += 2*(2 - ctr[2]) = 2*(2-0)=4 -> then tot becomes 0+0+2+4=6? so cnt[3]=6 But the problem says: \n  The first test case: n=1 -> output 2? \n  The second test case: n=2 -> output 2? The third test case: n=3 -> output 3. So for n=1: we need at least 2 lines? because with 2 lines we get 2 triangles (which is >=1). So the answer for n=1 is 2. But the precomputation: \n  cnt[0]=0 -> not enough\n  cnt[1]=0 -> not enough\n  cnt[2]=2 -> enough for n=1 and n=2 -> so the answer for n=1 and n=2 is 2. For n=3: we need 3 lines because with 2 lines we only have 2 triangles (which is <3) and with 3 lines we have 6 (>=3) -> so answer 3. So the precomputation is building the total triangles for x lines. Now, the binary search function:\n\n  def solve(sn):\n      t = int(sn)\n      s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n      while s < e:\n          m = (s+e)//2\n          if cnt[m] >= t:\n              e = m\n          else:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      return str(s) We are searching for the minimal x (which is the index in cnt) such that cnt[x] >= t.\n\nIn the binary search, if cnt[m] >= t, we set e = m. Otherwise, we need to set s to something. Standard binary search: we want the first index that is >= t. If cnt[m] < t, then we need to search in the right half: so we set s = m+1. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n    s = m+1\n\nBut note: the binary search condition: while s < e:\n      m = (s+e)//2\n      if cnt[m] >= t:\n          e = m\n      else:\n          s = m+1\n\nThen at the end, s is the answer. So for program2, the missing code is:\n\n    s = m+1\n\n### Program3:\n\nWe are given a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B') and we must determine if it is possible to form this string by stamping zero or more times. The stamp: covers two adjacent cells and colors them as (R,B) or (B,R). We can stamp multiple times on the same cell. The stamp must be completely on the grid. The provided code:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for i in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().strip()\n      s = s.strip(\"W\") # remove leading and trailing white? temp = list(s.split('W')) Then for each segment in temp (which are the non-white segments separated by white), we check:\n      if the segment is non-empty:\n          if the segment does not contain both 'B' and 'R' (i.e., it only has one color) then we output \"NO\" and break. Otherwise, we output \"YES\". But the problem: \n  The stamp always colors two adjacent cells with one red and one blue. Therefore, in any contiguous segment (without white) we must have a mix of red and blue? However, note that we can stamp multiple times on the same cell.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### Program1:\nWe are counting the number of ways to reach every point x in [1, n] under the given constraints.\n\nThe approach in the code:\n- We have an array `dp` which initially sets to 1 the positions that are multiples of `k` (the first move must be divisible by k).\n- Then we have an array `ans` which is a copy of `dp`.\n- We then have a loop for `s` from 2 to n-1 (but note the break condition: we break when the first move of the next step is too big).\n- For each step `s`, we are considering moves of length divisible by `ks = k + s - 1`.\n- The variable `first` is computed as the minimal total displacement we can have with `s` moves: \n    first = (ks*(ks+1)//2 - ((k-1)*k//2)\n  This is the sum from k to k+s-1: which is the minimal displacement if we take the minimal moves (which are the divisors: k, k+1, ...).\n\nThe missing code inside the inner loop (for i in range(first, n+1)) is to update `dp2` (which represents the next state) using the current `dp`.\n\nWe note that the recurrence is:\n  dp2[i] = dp[i] + dp2[i - step]   (but note: step is not fixed? Actually, we are allowed to take any multiple of the current step size)\n\nHowever, note that the move at step `s` must be a multiple of `ks = k+s-1`. Therefore, we can think of:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i] + dp[i - j]   for j being multiples of ks? But that would be too slow.\n\nInstead, we can use a technique similar to the \"coin problem\" with step sizes being multiples of ks. We can do:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i]   ??? \n\nBut note the current `dp` array holds the number of ways to reach a position using exactly `s-1` moves? Actually, the outer loop is for `s` (the number of moves) starting from 2 (so we are building the second move and beyond). \n\nLooking at the code structure:\n\n  for s in range(2, n):   # but note: we break early if first>n+1\n      ks = k + s - 1\n      first = ...   # minimal displacement for s moves\n      for i from first to n:\n          # missing code: update dp2[i] using dp and dp2?\n      dp = dp2   # then we reset dp2 to zeros for the next iteration\n\nAnd then we update the answer by adding the current `dp` (which now represents the ways with exactly s moves) to `ans`.\n\nWe are missing the recurrence. The idea is that to reach position i with s moves, we can take the last move as any multiple of ks. Therefore, we can write:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nBut wait: the current `dp` array holds the state for s-1 moves. Then to form s moves, we take the state for s-1 moves at position i - j (where j is a multiple of ks) and then add a move of j. However, note that we are allowed to have any positive multiple. So:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i] + dp[i - j] for every j that is a multiple of ks and j>=ks and i>=j.\n\nBut doing that for every multiple would be O(n^2). Instead, we can use a difference array or cumulative sums.\n\nAlternatively, note that we can do:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nBut that would only account for one step? Actually, we can use:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nBut then we are missing the fact that we can have multiple moves? Actually, the recurrence for the coin problem with coin ks is:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i] + dp2[i - ks]   (if we were doing unlimited coins) but note: we are not. We are only adding one move? \n\nWait, the problem: we are building the state for exactly s moves. The state for s moves at position i is the sum over all multiples j (>=ks) of the state for s-1 moves at position i - j.\n\nBut note: the state for s-1 moves at position i - j is already computed in `dp` (which is the state for s-1 moves). However, we can use a cumulative array to avoid the inner loop.\n\nAlternatively, the provided code does not use a cumulative array. But note that the inner loop goes from `first` to `n`. We can do:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nBut why? \n\nLet me explain: \n  We want to add the possibility of taking a move of size j (which is a multiple of ks). The minimal move at this step is ks (so j=ks, 2*ks, ...). \n\n  Then: \n      dp2[i] = dp[i - ks] + dp[i - 2*ks] + ... \n\n  But note that we can write:\n      dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\n  Why? Because if we subtract ks from i, then the term for j=ks would be dp[i-ks], and the terms for j=2*ks, 3*ks, ... would be the same as dp2[i-ks] (which already includes the sum for multiples at the position i-ks). However, wait: the state dp2[i-ks] is for the same step s? But we are building dp2 in the same inner loop.\n\nActually, we are building dp2 in increasing order of i. So when we are at i, we have already computed dp2[i-ks]. But note: the recurrence for the same step s: \n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nThis recurrence is correct because:\n  The ways to get to i with s moves is:\n      - the ways to get to i-ks with s moves (and then add a move of ks) -> but wait, that would be the same as having already taken the move of ks? Actually, no: we are only taking one move of ks? \n\nBut note: we are breaking the move into one step of ks? Actually, we are taking one move of any multiple of ks. So:\n\n  We can take a move of ks: then we come from i-ks (with s-1 moves) and then add a move of ks -> that gives dp[i-ks] (because the state for s-1 moves at i-ks is dp[i-ks]).\n  Then we can take a move of 2*ks: then we come from i-2*ks (with s-1 moves) -> that gives dp[i-2*ks].\n  But note: we can also take a move of 3*ks, etc.\n\nHowever, the recurrence above does not account for that. The recurrence:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nwould then be:\n\n  dp2[i] = (dp[i-ks] + dp[i-2*ks] + ... )   but wait: dp2[i-ks] = dp[i-ks-ks] + dp[i-ks]? \n\nActually, if we define:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp[i] for the first step? \n\nBut we are building dp2 for step s. We can use:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nThis recurrence is standard for the coin problem when we are allowed to use the same coin multiple times? But note: we are not. We are only adding one coin (one move) of size that is a multiple of ks? Actually, we are allowed to take any multiple, but that multiple is one move. So we are taking one move of size j (which is a multiple of ks). Then:\n\n  dp2[i] = sum_{m>=1} dp[i - m*ks]\n\nBut we can compute that with:\n\n  dp2[i] = dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]\n\nbecause:\n\n  dp2[i - ks] = sum_{m>=1} dp[i - ks - m*ks] = sum_{m>=2} dp[i - m*ks]\n\nand then we add dp[i-ks] (which is the m=1 term).\n\nSo the recurrence is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1 is:\n\n    dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\n\nBut note: we are not taking modulo in the inner loop? Actually, we should. The problem says modulo 998244353.\n\nSo:\n\n    dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\n\nBut wait: the state `dp` is from the previous step (s-1) and `dp2` is the current step (s). And we are iterating from `first` to `n`.\n\nHowever, note that `i - ks` might be negative? But we start at `first` which is at least ks (because first = ... and we break if first>n+1, but first is at least ks). Actually, first = (ks*(ks+1)//2 - ((k-1)*k//2) which is the minimal displacement for s moves. And ks is the step for the last move. So i starts at first, which is at least ks (for s>=1, but s starts at 2 so ks>=k+1). Therefore, i-ks is at least first-ks, which is nonnegative? \n\nBut let's check: \n  first = (ks*(ks+1)//2 - (k-1)*k//2\n  and ks = k+s-1.\n\nWe can compute: \n  first = ( (k+s-1)*(k+s) // 2 ) - ( (k-1)*k // 2 )\n\nBut note: the minimal displacement for s moves is the sum of the minimal moves: k, k+1, ..., k+s-1 = s*(2*k+s-1)//2.\n\nSo first = s*(2*k+s-1)//2.\n\nThen i starts at first, so i-ks = first - ks = s*(2*k+s-1)//2 - (k+s-1). This is nonnegative? \n\nFor s=2: \n  first = 2*(2*k+1)//2 = 2*k+1\n  ks = k+1\n  first - ks = (2*k+1) - (k+1) = k >=1 (given k>=1) -> nonnegative.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n    dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\n\nBut note: the problem says that the moves can be in any order? Actually, the problem says: \"Two ways are considered different if they differ as sets of visited positions.\" So the order of moves does not matter? Actually, the moves are sequential: we are building a path. But note: the set of visited positions is what matters. However, the recurrence above does not overcount? \n\nThe recurrence is standard for step sizes that are multiples. We are building the state for exactly s moves. The recurrence is correct.\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is:\n\n    dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\n\nBut note: the modulo operation is important.\n\n### Program2:\n\nWe are given test cases and we must compute the minimum number of lines needed to create at least n triangles.\n\nThe code precomputes an array `cnt` such that `cnt[x]` is the number of triangles we get when we add `x` lines. Then for each test case, we do a binary search over `cnt` to find the minimum x such that cnt[x] >= n.\n\nThe precomputation:\n\n  ctr = [0,0,0]   # counters for the three directions?\n  cnt = [0]   # index 0: 0 lines -> 0 triangles\n  i=0\n  tot=0\n  s=0\n  while tot < 10**9:\n      tot += 2*(s - ctr[i])\n      cnt.append(tot)\n      ctr[i] += 1\n      s += 1\n      i = (i+1) % 3\n\nWhat is happening? \n\nThe problem: adding lines in three directions (since the grid is hexagonal, there are three directions). When we add a line, it can create triangles by intersecting with lines in the other two directions.\n\nThe formula: \n  tot += 2*(s - ctr[i])\n\nHere, `s` is the total number of lines we have added so far? and `ctr[i]` is the count of lines in the current direction? \n\nActually, the note in the problem: after adding the first line: 0 triangles. Then after the second line: 2 triangles. Then after the third line: how many? \n\nThe example: 3 lines -> 6 triangles? But the example says: with 3 lines we get 6 triangles? Actually, the example says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below.\" and the sample input n=3 -> output 3.\n\nBut the precomputation:\n\n  Step0: s=0, tot=0 -> cnt[0]=0\n  Step1: i=0 -> tot += 2*(0 - ctr[0]) = 2*(0-0)=0 -> then set ctr[0]=1, s=1 -> cnt[1]=0? \n  Step2: i=1 -> tot += 2*(1 - ctr[1]) = 2*(1-0)=2 -> then ctr[1]=1, s=2 -> cnt[2]=2\n  Step3: i=2 -> tot += 2*(2 - ctr[2]) = 2*(2-0)=4 -> then tot becomes 0+0+2+4=6? so cnt[3]=6\n\nBut the problem says: \n  The first test case: n=1 -> output 2? \n  The second test case: n=2 -> output 2? \n  The third test case: n=3 -> output 3.\n\nSo for n=1: we need at least 2 lines? because with 2 lines we get 2 triangles (which is >=1). So the answer for n=1 is 2.\n\nBut the precomputation: \n  cnt[0]=0 -> not enough\n  cnt[1]=0 -> not enough\n  cnt[2]=2 -> enough for n=1 and n=2 -> so the answer for n=1 and n=2 is 2.\n\nFor n=3: we need 3 lines because with 2 lines we only have 2 triangles (which is <3) and with 3 lines we have 6 (>=3) -> so answer 3.\n\nSo the precomputation is building the total triangles for x lines.\n\nNow, the binary search function:\n\n  def solve(sn):\n      t = int(sn)\n      s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n      while s < e:\n          m = (s+e)//2\n          if cnt[m] >= t:\n              e = m\n          else:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      return str(s)\n\nWe are searching for the minimal x (which is the index in cnt) such that cnt[x] >= t.\n\nIn the binary search, if cnt[m] >= t, we set e = m. Otherwise, we need to set s to something. \n\nStandard binary search: we want the first index that is >= t.\n\nIf cnt[m] < t, then we need to search in the right half: so we set s = m+1.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\n    s = m+1\n\nBut note: the binary search condition: \n\n  while s < e:\n      m = (s+e)//2\n      if cnt[m] >= t:\n          e = m\n      else:\n          s = m+1\n\nThen at the end, s is the answer.\n\nSo for program2, the missing code is:\n\n    s = m+1\n\n### Program3:\n\nWe are given a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B') and we must determine if it is possible to form this string by stamping zero or more times.\n\nThe stamp: covers two adjacent cells and colors them as (R,B) or (B,R). We can stamp multiple times on the same cell. The stamp must be completely on the grid.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for i in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().strip()\n      s = s.strip(\"W\")   # remove leading and trailing white? \n      temp = list(s.split('W'))\n\n  Then for each segment in temp (which are the non-white segments separated by white), we check:\n      if the segment is non-empty:\n          if the segment does not contain both 'B' and 'R' (i.e., it only has one color) then we output \"NO\" and break.\n\n  Otherwise, we output \"YES\".\n\nBut the problem: \n  The stamp always colors two adjacent cells with one red and one blue. Therefore, in any contiguous segment (without white) we must have a mix of red and blue? \n\nHowever, note that we can stamp multiple times on the same cell. The key observation:\n\n  - The entire picture must be composed of contiguous segments of non-white cells that are separated by white. Each contiguous segment must be independently stampable.\n\n  - In a contiguous segment, the stamping operation always produces an alternating pattern? But note: we can have overlapping stamps. However, the requirement is that the segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n\n  Why? Because if we have a segment of length 1: then it must be stamped? But the stamp covers two cells. So a segment of length 1 is impossible? \n\n  Also, if we have a segment of length 2: \n      It must be either \"RB\" or \"BR\". \n      But if we have \"RR\" or \"BB\", that is impossible.\n\n  For a segment of length 3:\n      Possibilities: \n        We can stamp the first two: then we have \"RB?\" and then stamp the last two: then we have \"RBB\" or \"RBR\"?\n        Actually, we can have:\n          \"RBR\", \"RBB\", \"BRB\", \"BRR\", etc.\n\n      But note: we cannot have a segment of all the same color? \n\n  Therefore, the condition: \n      In each contiguous non-white segment, we must have at least one 'R' and one 'B'. \n\n  However, what about the entire segment being white? Then we skip.\n\n  But also note: a segment of length 1: if it is non-white, then it must be either 'R' or 'B'. Then we don't have both -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n  So the condition is: for each non-empty segment in temp (which is a contiguous non-white segment), if the segment does not contain both 'B' and 'R', then it is impossible.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code: we break and output \"NO\" for the entire test case.\n\n  The code structure:\n\n      for i in temp:\n          if i:   # non-empty\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n      else:\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n  The else clause of the for loop is only executed if we did not break.\n\n  So in the TODO, we should print \"NO\" and break out of the for loop (so that the else is not executed). But note: we are inside a test case.\n\n  However, we cannot break the outer for loop? Actually, we break the inner for loop. Then we must not print \"YES\" for this test case.\n\n  The code:\n\n      for seg in temp:   # I changed the variable to seg to avoid confusion with the outer i\n          if seg: \n              if 'B' not in seg or 'R' not in seg: \n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  break\n      else:\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n  But note: the break will break the for loop and then we continue to the next test case? \n\n  However, the code as written uses the same variable `i` for the segment and for the outer test case loop? Actually, the inner loop variable is `i` (which was the outer test case index). We should change the inner variable to avoid overwriting.\n\n  But the problem says: the code is given. We are only to fill the missing part.\n\n  The given code:\n\n      for i in temp:   # here, i is the segment string\n          if i:\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                  # TODO\n\n  We must output \"NO\" for the entire test case and break out of the inner for loop (so we don't check the rest) and then skip the else.\n\n  So the missing code is:\n\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\n  But note: we break the inner for loop. Then we do not run the else clause.\n\n  However, what if there are multiple segments? We break at the first invalid segment.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But what if we have multiple segments and the first one is valid and the second one is invalid? Then we break and print \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program3 is:\n\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\nHowever, there is one more corner: what if the segment is empty? We skip. \n\nSo the code is:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().strip()\n      s = s.strip(\"W\")\n      temp = list(s.split('W'))\n      for seg in temp:   # in the code, the variable is i, but we are using the same name as the outer loop index? \n          if seg: \n              if 'B' not in seg or 'R' not in seg: \n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  break\n      else:\n          print(\"YES\")\n\nBut note: the outer loop variable is `i` and the inner loop variable is also `i`. This will break the outer loop? \n\nActually, the outer loop is:\n\n  for i in range(t):   # i is integer\n      ...\n      for i in temp:   # now i becomes a string in temp\n\nThis is bad because after the inner loop, the outer i is lost. But we don't use it again. However, the next test case: the outer loop will use the next integer i? \n\nBut the inner loop variable overwrites the outer one. Then after the inner loop, the outer loop index is the last segment? Then the next test case: we try to run the outer loop again? \n\nActually, the outer loop variable is set to the next value in the range(t) regardless. But when we break the inner loop, the outer loop variable is the last segment? Then the next test case: we start with n = ... but the outer loop index is now a string? \n\nThis will cause an error.\n\nTherefore, the provided code has a bug: the inner loop variable should not be `i` because it conflicts with the outer loop index.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to complete the code as given. We cannot change the variable names. \n\nHowever, note the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are only to fill the TODO part.\n\nBut the TODO part is inside the inner loop. We are not allowed to change the rest.\n\nAlternatively, we can break the inner loop and then break the outer loop? But that would break the test cases.\n\nWe must fix the test case to not break the outer loop. \n\nBut note: the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and the inner loop is over segments of the current test case. We can simply break the inner loop and then continue to the next test case? \n\nBut the code after the inner loop is the else clause. We break the inner loop and then the next line is the end of the test case? \n\nActually, the structure:\n\n  for i in range(t):\n      n = ... \n      s = ...\n      ... \n      for i in temp:   # this is the same variable i as the outer loop index? \n          ... \n          break   # breaks the inner loop\n      else:\n          print(\"YES\")\n\nAfter the inner loop breaks, we go to the next test case? \n\nBut the outer loop index `i` is now the segment that caused the break? Then the next test case: the outer loop index will be the next integer? \n\nActually, no: the outer loop variable `i` is reassigned in the inner loop. Then when we break the inner loop, the outer loop variable `i` is the last segment of the current test case. Then the next test case: the outer loop variable `i` is set to the next integer in the range? \n\nBut the outer loop is a for-loop over `range(t)`. The next value of `i` is the next integer provided by the range iterator, regardless of what we did to the variable `i` inside.\n\nSo it is safe? \n\nBut let me test with a small example:\n\n  for i in range(2):\n      print('outer i start:', i)\n      for i in ['a','b']:\n          print('inner i:', i)\n          break\n      print('outer i end:', i)\n\n  Output:\n      outer i start: 0\n      inner i: a\n      outer i end: a   # because after the inner loop, i is 'a'\n      outer i start: 1   # then the next iteration: the range gives 1? \n      inner i: a\n      outer i end: a\n\n  Then we get an error? because we are trying to convert the next input to integer? \n\n  Actually, the next test case: \n      n = int(input())   -> but the current i is a string from the inner loop? \n\n  Then we get an error when we do n = int(input()) because the outer loop variable i is now a string and we are not using it for the next test case? \n\n  Actually, the next test case: the outer loop variable i is set to the next value from the range(t). The inner loop does not affect the next iteration of the outer loop. \n\n  But during the same test case, after the inner loop, we have:\n\n      n = ... (we already read n and s for this test case)\n\n  Then we are done with the test case. The next test case: the outer loop variable i is set to the next integer.\n\n  However, the problem: after the inner loop, we break and then the test case ends. Then the outer loop variable i is set to the next integer. \n\n  But wait: the inner loop breaks and then the test case ends? Then we go to the next test case. \n\n  But the code after the inner loop is the else clause? We break the inner loop so we skip the else. Then we go to the next test case.\n\n  However, the variable i in the outer loop for the next test case is the next integer. \n\n  But the inner loop uses the same variable i? That will break the current test case's outer loop variable i? \n\n  Actually, the outer loop variable i is overwritten by the inner loop. Then after the inner loop, if we break, the outer loop variable i is the last segment? Then when we go to the next test case, the outer loop variable i is the next integer? \n\n  How? The outer loop is:\n\n      for i in range(t):   # i is assigned by the range iterator\n\n  The inner loop:\n\n      for i in temp:   # reassigns i to each element of temp\n\n  After the inner loop, the outer loop variable i is the last value from the inner loop. Then the next iteration of the outer loop: the range(t) iterator will assign the next integer to i? \n\n  Yes, because the for-loop in Python reassigns the loop variable at the beginning of each iteration.\n\n  Therefore, it is safe.\n\n  So the missing code is:\n\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\n  But note: the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and the inner loop is over segments that are non-white. The total length of all strings is the sum of n over test cases, which is <= 10^5. So we are safe.\n\n  However, there is one more corner: what if the entire string is white? Then temp will be a list of empty strings? Then the for loop will not enter the if condition (if i: ...) and then we print \"YES\". That is correct: we don't need to stamp.\n\n  Example: n=3, s=\"WWW\" -> we can do nothing -> valid.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program3 is:\n\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\nBut note: the condition is:\n\n      if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n\n  This condition is true if either 'B' is not in the segment OR 'R' is not in the segment. That means if the segment has only 'B's or only 'R's, then we print \"NO\".\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, note: the condition is written as: \n      if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n\n  This is equivalent to: if the segment does not contain at least one 'B' AND at least one 'R'. Actually, it is equivalent to: if the segment is missing at least one of the colors.\n\n  But we want to fail if the segment does not have both? Then this condition is exactly: if the segment is not containing both, then we fail.\n\n  So it is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program3 is:\n\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\nBut note: the break is necessary to break the inner for loop and skip the else.\n\n### Summary:\n\n  program1: \n      dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\n\n  program2:\n      s = m+1\n\n  program3:\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\nNow, we output in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\",\n  \"program2\": \"s = m+1\",\n  \"program3\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the code in program3 is two lines? Actually, we can write it as one line? But the break is on the same level. We can do:\n\n      if ...:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          break\n\nBut the TODO is only one line? Actually, the TODO is:\n\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace that with two lines? \n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we can output two lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n      print(\"NO\"); break\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the original code uses indentation. We must output the code as it would appear.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is two lines: \n\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\nBut note: the indentation level. The current code is:\n\n      for i in temp:\n          if i:\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO is at an indentation level of 4 (or 8) spaces? We must output two lines at the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n      print(\"NO\")\n      break\n\nBut in the JSON string, we must escape the newline and quotes.\n\nAlternatively, we can output as a string with a newline.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nWe'll output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\nFor program1: one line.\n\nFor program2: one line.\n\nFor program3: two lines.\n\nIn JSON, we can use \\n for the newline.\n\nSo:\n\n  \"program3\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        break\"\n\nBut note: the indentation: the break should be at the same level as the print. The current level is 16 or 12? We don't know exactly. But the original code uses 4-space indentation? \n\nLooking at the provided code for program3:\n\n    for i in temp:\n        if i:\n            if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at 16 spaces (if we assume 4 per level: 4 for for, 4 for if, 4 for if, then 4 for the TODO). Then we need to output two lines at 16 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we can output:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n    break\n\nwith the same indentation as the TODO. Since the TODO is at the same level, we can output two lines with the same indentation.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we can write:\n\n  \"program3\": \"        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        break\"\n\nBut how many spaces? The original code in the problem for program3:\n\n      for i in temp:\n          if i:\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe see that the TODO is at 16 spaces (if the base indentation is 4: then 4 for the for, 4 for the if, 4 for the inner if -> 12? and then 4 more for the inner block? 16). \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the solution must run. The exact indentation must match.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without specifying the exact number of spaces? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\".\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we output the two lines at the same indentation level as the TODO. Since the TODO is at the same level, we can use the same number of spaces.\n\nBut we don't know the exact number. However, the problem says: the code is given. We are to fill the missing part. The missing part is the two lines at the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nTherefore, we can output:\n\n  \"program3\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\nbreak\"\n\nwithout extra spaces? But that would be at the same level as the TODO? Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the code block. \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact string. We can assume that the system will insert the code at the TODO and the indentation will be adjusted by the existing code.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code with the same indentation as the surrounding code. Since the TODO is at the same level as the inner if's body, we can use 8 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: the code is given. We are to output the code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at a certain indentation. We must output the code at that indentation.\n\nBut we don't know the exact indentation. However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output the two lines without any extra indentation? \n\nBut that would be wrong. \n\nLooking at the example: the TODO is at the same level as the inner if. The inner if is at 8 spaces (if we assume 4 per level). Then the TODO is at 8+4=12? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. \n\nWe can count the spaces in the provided code for program3:\n\n      for i in temp:\n          if i:\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\nIn the given code, the lines are:\n\n  for i in temp:\n      if i:\n          if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n\nThe TODO is at the same level as the inner if's body. The inner if is indented one level from the outer if, which is one level from the for. \n\nIn the provided code, the base indentation for the for-loop body is 4 spaces? Then the if i: is 8, and the inner if is 12, and the TODO is 16? \n\nBut we don't know. \n\nAlternatively, we can output the code without extra spaces and let the system handle the indentation? \n\nBut the problem says: the code must run. \n\nWe must output the exact code that would be inserted. \n\nSince the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, we assume that the system will insert the code at the same indentation as the TODO. Therefore, we output:\n\n  \"program3\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\nbreak\"\n\nBut that would be:\n\n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  break\n\nBut that is 16 spaces? \n\nBut we don't know. \n\nAlternatively, we can output:\n\n  \"program3\": \"    print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n    break\"\n\nwith 4 spaces? \n\nBut the original code might use 4 or 8. \n\nWe must rely on the fact that the system will insert the code at the same indentation as the TODO. Therefore, we output the two lines without any extra spaces? \n\nBut that would be 0 spaces? \n\nActually, we output the code as a string. The system will replace the TODO with the string we provide. The TODO is at a certain column. The code we output will be at that column.\n\nTherefore, we can output:\n\n  \"program3\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\nbreak\"\n\nBut that is not indented. \n\nAlternatively, we can output the code with the same indentation as the TODO? But we don't know the exact number.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we output the two lines as they would appear in the program at the correct indentation level. \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the indentation level. \n\nBut the problem says: the code is given. We are to fill the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the surrounding code. We can output the two lines without any additional indentation? \n\nActually, the system that replaces the TODO will put the code at the same indentation. So we output:\n\n  print(\"NO\")\n  break\n\nwithout any extra spaces. \n\nBut in the JSON string, we write:\n\n  \"program3\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\nbreak\"\n\nBut when inserted, it will be:\n\n      for i in temp:\n          if i:\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  break\n\nThis is 16 spaces for the two lines? \n\nBut the for-loop body is at 4, the if i: at 8, the inner if at 12, and the body of the inner if at 16? \n\nBut the break is at 16? Then it breaks the inner for-loop? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  \"program1\": \"dp2[i] = (dp2[i - ks] + dp[i - ks]) % 998244353\",\n  \"program2\": \"s = m+1\",\n  \"program3\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\nbreak\"\n\nBut wait: in program3, the break is at the same level as the print? Then it breaks the inner for-loop. That is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the break is inside the inner for-loop. We break the inner for-loop and then the test case continues? But after the break, we break out of the inner for-loop and then the test case ends? Then we go to the next test case? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
