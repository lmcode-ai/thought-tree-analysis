Note: The problem states that the total sum of n*m over test cases is <= 10^6, so we can do O(m) per array. Observation:\n Let's define a transformation for an array c: \n   Let T(c) = [ c[0], c[1], c[2]-c[1], c[3]-c[2]+c[1], ... ]? But note the operations: \n\n Operation1: \n   It affects positions: [i-1, i, j, j+1] -> [c[i-1]+1, c[i]-1, c[j]-1, c[j+1]+1]. This operation is similar to two independent moves? Actually, note that it subtracts from two positions and adds to two others. However, note that the operations are linear. We can consider the effect on a linear combination. Alternate approach (known from similar problems): \n   Consider the effect on the vector of the array. We can define a potential function that is invariant under the operations (or changes in a predictable way). For Operation1 (non-special):\n   It does: \n      c[i-1] += 1\n      c[i]   -= 1\n      c[j]   -= 1\n      c[j+1] += 1\n\n   How does this affect the value S = sum_{i} i * c[i]? Change = 1*(i-1) + (-1)*i + (-1)*j + 1*(j+1) \n              = (i-1 - i) + (-j + j+1) = (-1) + (1) = 0. So Operation1 does not change S = sum_{i} i * c[i]. For Operation2 (special):\n   It does:\n      c[i-1] += 1\n      c[i]   -= 1\n      c[j]   -= 1\n      c[j+2] += 1\n\n   Change in S = 1*(i-1) + (-1)*i + (-1)*j + 1*(j+2)\n               = (i-1 - i) + (-j + j+2) = (-1) + (2) = 1.

Example: \"RR\"\n\n                             We can do:\n                                 Step1: stamp the two as RB -> then we have RB. Step2: stamp the first two again as RB? -> then we set the first two to RB: so the first becomes R (because the last stamp on the first cell is R) and the second becomes B -> we get RB, not RR. Alternatively, \n                                 Step1: stamp as BR -> then we get BR. Step2: stamp as BR again? then we get BR -> not RR. But wait: we can stamp overlapping:\n\n                             Example for \"RR\" on three cells? Actually, the segment is contiguous and we are only allowed to stamp on two adjacent cells.

Type2: BR -> then we get BR -> not RR. So we cannot achieve \"RR\". Similarly, we cannot achieve \"BB\". But what about \"RBR\" (three cells)? We want: R, B, R.\n\n                             Step1: stamp the first two as RB: -> R, B, W -> then we have the third cell white. Step2: stamp the last two as BR: -> R, B becomes overwritten?

The only two adjacent cells are positions0 and1. If we stamp them, then we get either \"RB\" or \"BR\". We cannot get \"R\" at position0 and \"W\" at position1 because the stamp would have colored position1. Therefore, the condition holds. However, what about a segment of length 2 that is \"RB\" or \"BR\"? \"RB\": has both R and B -> valid. \"BB\": invalid. But note: what if we have a segment of length>=2 that has both R and B? Example: \"RRRRBBBB\" -> valid. How to achieve any pattern that has at least one R and one B? We can use overlapping stamps to adjust the colors arbitrarily?

We can do:\n\n                      s_line = s.strip()   # because s is a line from the input Then we split the string by 'W' and check each segment. But note: the string might have newline? we do .strip(). Therefore, the code for program3:\n\n                      s_clean = s.strip()\n                      segments = s_clean.split('W')\n                      flag = True\n                      for seg in segments:\n                          if seg == '':\n                              continue\n                          if len(seg) == 1:\n                              flag = False\n                              break\n                          if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                              flag = False\n                              break\n\n                      if flag:\n                          print(\"YES\")\n                      else:\n                          print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: what if the string starts or ends with 'W'? Example: \"WRB\" -> split: ['','RB'] -> then we skip the empty string and check 'RB': valid. But what about a segment of length 0? we skip. Therefore, the missing code for program3 is:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        segments = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for seg in segments:\n            if len(seg) == 0:\n                continue\n            if len(seg) == 1:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n   But note: the problem says the total length of strings is <= 10^5, so this is efficient.",

But note: the condition: \n        if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p) However, the condition \"or\" is not exactly what we want. We want:\n\n        if the segment p is non-empty and (either the length is 1 OR the segment does not contain both 'R' and 'B')\n\n   We can write:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)):\n\n   But note: if len(p)==1, then the condition is true. If len(p)>=2, then we require that either 'R' not in p OR 'B' not in p? But we want: if the segment does not have both colors -> that is equivalent to ('R' not in p) OR ('B' not in p) So the condition is correct. However, we can also write:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)): This is clearer. Therefore, we choose:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s_clean = s.strip()\n            parts = s_clean.split('W')\n            for p in parts: if p:   # non-empty\n                    if len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n   But note: what if there are multiple segments that are invalid? We break at the first invalid segment. This is efficient.

So it is correct. Therefore, we output the missing code accordingly.

We must represent it as a string with newlines. However, the problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly. We output the string exactly as it would appear.

We must be careful. Alternatively, we can write without the for-else by using a flag:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p: \n                if len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO') This is also acceptable. We choose the flag version for clarity. Therefore, program3:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p:   # non-empty\n                if len(p)==1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   But note: we can combine the condition:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n            valid = False\n            break\n\n   So:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   We'll use this. Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"ret = index + 1\",\n          \"program2\": \"L = mid\",\n          \"program3\": \"s_clean = s.strip()\\nparts = s_clean.split('W')\\nvalid = True\\nfor p in parts:\\n    if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n        valid = False\\n        break\\nprint('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program3 code must be exactly the body of the for loop. We output the string with newlines as \\n. We assume the code will be inserted with the same indentation. The given program3 has:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   The indentation: the entire block is at the same level as the for loop. Therefore, we output the JSON as above. Let me write the program3 string with proper newlines and without extra spaces. We write:\n\n        \"s_clean = s.strip()\\nparts = s_clean.split('W')\\nvalid = True\\nfor p in parts:\\n    if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n        valid = False\\n        break\\nprint('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n   This is 4 lines of code.

But note: the initial allocation (i+2) for the i-th node in the sorted list: what is that?\n\n                  Example: \n                      n=1: only the root -> then the answer should be 1. In the code: \n                          num_level = 0 -> then if R==0: return 0+1+0 = 1? but then we have the condition if R==0: return num_level+1 -> 1. Example with one child of the root: The tree: \n                          1 -- 2\n\n                      Then the parent list: [1] (for vertex2)\n\n                      Then counter: { '1': 1 } -> count = [1]\n\n                      Then for i=0: count[0] = max(1 - 0 - 2, 0) = max(-1,0)=0. Then R = max(count)=0 -> then the condition if R==0: return 0+1 = 1? but then we return 0+1+0 = 1? But the answer should be 2 seconds:\n\n                          Second0: inject the root -> at the end of second1, the root is infected. Second1: inject the child (vertex2) -> at the end of second2, the child is infected. So the minimal seconds is 2. How does the provided code work for this example?\n\n                      num_level = 1\n                      count = [0] -> then R = max(count)=0 -> then the condition if R==0: return num_level+1 = 1+1 = 2. So it returns 2. Therefore, the formula: answer = num_level + 1 + R   works. But what is the initial allocation (i+2) doing? In the example: \n                      i=0: 0 +2 = 2, then we subtract that from the number of children (which is 1) -> 1-2 = -1 -> then we set to 0. Why 2? \n\n                  Explanation: We have the root infected at time1. Then for the root (which is the only node with children), we can do:\n\n                         At time1: we inject one child -> then the child is infected at time2. But also, at time2: we can spread from the root to one more child? but there is no more child. So we only need one injection for the child. Why did we subtract 2?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nProgram1: \n We are given a test case with t test cases. For each test case, we are given n (number of arrays) and m (length of each array). Then n lines, each with m integers.\n\n The problem: \n Eric started with an array b of length m. He generated n arrays. One of them (the special one, index k) was modified using Operation2 (at least once), and the others (non-special) were modified using Operation1 (at least once).\n\n Operation1: (for non-special) \n   Choose indices i, j (2<=i<j<=m-1): subtract 1 from c_t[i] and c_t[j], add 1 to c_t[i-1] and c_t[j+1].\n Operation2: (for special)\n   Choose indices i, j (2<=i<j<=m-2): subtract 1 from c_t[i] and c_t[j], add 1 to c_t[i-1] and c_t[j+2].\n\n We are to find the index of the special array (k) and the number of times Operation2 was used on it.\n\n Approach:\n The key is to find an invariant that differentiates the arrays modified by Operation1 from those modified by Operation2.\n\n Note: The problem states that the total sum of n*m over test cases is <= 10^6, so we can do O(m) per array.\n\n Observation:\n Let's define a transformation for an array c: \n   Let T(c) = [ c[0], c[1], c[2]-c[1], c[3]-c[2]+c[1], ... ]? \n But note the operations: \n\n Operation1: \n   It affects positions: [i-1, i, j, j+1] -> [c[i-1]+1, c[i]-1, c[j]-1, c[j+1]+1].\n   This operation is similar to two independent moves? Actually, note that it subtracts from two positions and adds to two others.\n\n However, note that the operations are linear. We can consider the effect on a linear combination.\n\n Alternate approach (known from similar problems): \n   Consider the effect on the vector of the array. We can define a potential function that is invariant under the operations (or changes in a predictable way).\n\n For Operation1 (non-special):\n   It does: \n      c[i-1] += 1\n      c[i]   -= 1\n      c[j]   -= 1\n      c[j+1] += 1\n\n   How does this affect the value S = sum_{i} i * c[i]?\n      Change = 1*(i-1) + (-1)*i + (-1)*j + 1*(j+1) \n              = (i-1 - i) + (-j + j+1) \n              = (-1) + (1) = 0.\n\n   So Operation1 does not change S = sum_{i} i * c[i].\n\n For Operation2 (special):\n   It does:\n      c[i-1] += 1\n      c[i]   -= 1\n      c[j]   -= 1\n      c[j+2] += 1\n\n   Change in S = 1*(i-1) + (-1)*i + (-1)*j + 1*(j+2)\n               = (i-1 - i) + (-j + j+2)\n               = (-1) + (2) = 1.\n\n   So each Operation2 increases S by 1.\n\n Therefore, the special array will have a value of S that is greater than the base value (which is the value of S for the original array b) by the number of Operation2 (call it x). \n\n But note: the non-special arrays are modified by Operation1 (which doesn't change S) so they have the same S as the original array b.\n\n However, wait: the problem says that Eric starts with c_i = b for every array. Then he applies operations to each array. For non-special arrays, he applies Operation1 (which doesn't change S) so they have S = S0 (the S of b). For the special array, he applies Operation2 x times, so S_special = S0 + x.\n\n But note: we don't know S0. However, we can note that all non-special arrays have the same S (S0). The special array has S0 + x. Therefore, the special array has the maximum S value? \n\n However, what if there are multiple arrays? We are to find the index of the special array and the value x.\n\n Steps for one test case:\n   For each array (index from 0 to n-1), compute S = sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (j+1) * c[i][j]   [because the array indices in the input are 0-indexed, but the problem uses 1-indexed]\n\n   Then:\n      The non-special arrays should have the same S (which is the base S0). The special array will have S0 + x, and x = (S_special - S0).\n\n   But note: we don't know which one is special. However, the problem states that the special array is uniquely determined.\n\n   How to find S0? \n      Since there are n-1 non-special arrays, the majority of the arrays will have the same value. The special array will be the one with a different (and higher) value.\n\n   Therefore, we can:\n      - Compute S for each array.\n      - Find the minimum value of S (which should be S0, because the special array is the only one with a higher value). \n        But note: what if there are multiple special arrays? The problem says there is exactly one special array.\n\n      So: \n          Let minS = minimum S over the arrays.\n          Then the non-special arrays have S = minS, and the special array has S = minS + x, where x is the number of operations.\n\n      However, we must also output the index of the special array (and note: the problem indexes the arrays from 1 to n).\n\n   But wait: what if the operations on non-special arrays are applied at least once? Then they are not equal to b? \n        However, Operation1 does not change S. So even after applying Operation1, the non-special arrays have the same S as b (which is minS). \n\n   Therefore, the special array will have the maximum S? Actually, it will be the one with the highest S.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the non-special arrays are modified by Operation1 at least once. But that doesn't change S. So they are all minS.\n\n   So:\n      We can find the array with the maximum S. Then:\n          k = index of that array (in 1-indexed) and x = (maxS - minS).\n\n   But wait: what if there are multiple arrays with the same maximum? The problem states the special array is uniquely determined.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"It can be shown that under the constraints given in the problem, this value is unique and won't exceed 10^18, so you can represent it as a 64-bit integer. It can also be shown that the index of the special array is uniquely determined.\"\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n      Let S_arr = [ S0, S1, ... S_{n-1} ] for the n arrays.\n\n      Then:\n          minS = min(S_arr)\n          maxS = max(S_arr)\n\n      The special array is the one with S = maxS, and the number of operations is maxS - minS.\n\n      But note: the problem says the non-special arrays are at least one? Actually, n>=3, so there are at least two non-special arrays.\n\n      However, what if the special array is the only one with maxS? Yes, because the non-special arrays are all minS.\n\n   But wait: what if the special array is the only one with maxS? Then we can find the index of the maximum.\n\n   However, the code provided in the problem has:\n\n        minV = int(1e20)\n        maxV = -1\n        ret = 0\n        for index in range(N):\n            mlist = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            cur = sum([index*val for index, val in enumerate(mlist)])\n\n            minV = min(minV, cur)\n            if maxV < cur:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            maxV = max(maxV, cur)\n\n        print(f\"{ret} {maxV-minV}\")\n\n   We see that the output should be: the index of the special array (ret) and the number of operations (maxV-minV).\n\n   So in the TODO part, we should record the index when we see a new maximum.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        if maxV < cur:\n            maxV = cur   # but note: we are updating maxV after the if? Actually, the next line does maxV = max(maxV, cur). So we can do:\n\n        Instead, we can set ret to the current index (but note: the problem indexes the arrays from 1 to n, and our loop index is 0-indexed, so we need to add 1).\n\n        So:\n\n            if maxV < cur:\n                ret = index + 1   # because the first array is index0 -> k=1, then index1->k=2, etc.\n\n        But note: we are updating maxV in the next line? Actually, we can do:\n\n            if maxV < cur:\n                ret = index + 1\n                maxV = cur   # we can set maxV to cur here? But the next line does maxV = max(maxV, cur). So we can avoid the next line? \n\n        However, the next line is maxV = max(maxV, cur). So we can leave it as is, but then the condition (maxV < cur) is equivalent to (cur > maxV) and then we set ret = index+1.\n\n        But note: if we have two arrays with the same maximum? The problem says the special array is uniquely determined, and the non-special arrays are all minS. So the maximum should be unique? \n\n        Actually, the problem says the special array has S0 + x, and x>=1 (at least one operation). So the maximum is unique.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        if maxV < cur:\n            ret = index + 1\n\n   And then update maxV? Actually, we update maxV in the next line. So we can do:\n\n        if maxV < cur:\n            ret = index + 1\n        maxV = max(maxV, cur)\n\n   But note: the condition (maxV < cur) is the same as (cur > maxV). Since we are updating maxV to be the maximum, we are capturing the maximum.\n\n   However, what if the first array has cur=10, then maxV=-1 -> so we set ret=1 and then maxV=10. Then the next array has cur=20: then we set ret=2 and then maxV=20. Then the next array has cur=15: then we don't set ret, and maxV remains 20. Then we output ret=2 and the difference 20 - minV.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: we must also compute minV. We are already doing minV = min(minV, cur) for every array.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n        if maxV < cur:\n            ret = index + 1\n\n   And then we update maxV in the next line.\n\n   However, the code already has:\n\n        minV = min(minV, cur)\n        if maxV < cur:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        maxV = max(maxV, cur)\n\n   So we just need to set ret = index+1 in the TODO.\n\n   But note: what if the first array is the special one? Then maxV is -1, and cur (which is at least 0) is > -1, so we set ret=1. Then update maxV to cur.\n\n   Then the next array: if it is non-special, then cur = minS (which is less than the special array's S). So we don't update ret.\n\n   Then we output: ret (the index of the special array) and maxV-minV (which is the number of operations).\n\n   So the missing line for program1 is: \"ret = index + 1\"\n\n Program2:\n   We are to compute the minimal number of seconds to infect the whole tree.\n\n   The problem:\n      We have a rooted tree (root=1). Initially, all healthy.\n      Each second:\n          Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, we can choose at most one additional child to infect (so we can choose one more child to infect in this phase).\n          Injection: we can choose any healthy vertex to infect.\n\n      We want the minimal seconds to infect the whole tree.\n\n   The input: \n        t test cases. For each: n, then n-1 integers: p2, p3, ... pn, meaning the parent of i (for i from 2 to n).\n\n   Approach:\n\n   We note that the infection starts at time 0 (if we do an injection at time 0, then at the end of second 1 we have that vertex infected). But the problem says: each second we do spreading then injection.\n\n   We can use a BFS or DFS to compute the children. However, note the constraint: the sum of n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n   Known similar problem: \n        We can model the infection as starting from the root? But note: we can choose any vertex to inject. However, we can also spread from the root.\n\n   Alternate known solution:\n\n        We can note that the root must be infected at some point. We can start by injecting the root? But we don't have to.\n\n        Actually, we can use a greedy strategy:\n\n        Step 1: Build the tree and compute the children for each node.\n\n        Step 2: We note that the infection can be spread from a node to its children. However, the spreading operation at a node v can only occur if at least one child is already infected, and then we can choose one more child to infect.\n\n        We can think of the infection process as:\n\n          Let dp[u] be the time when the entire subtree of u is infected.\n\n          How to compute dp[u]?\n\n          We start by noting that if u is infected at time t0, then we can start infecting its children.\n\n          However, the problem does not require starting at the root.\n\n        Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2) problem D) is:\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let children = list of children of u.\n\n            If there are no children, then we only need to infect u. How? \n                We can inject u at time 0? Then at time 1, u is infected. Then we are done? But the entire tree is just u.\n\n            Actually, we need to consider:\n\n                We can inject u at time 0 -> then at time 1, u is infected. Then we don't need to do anything else.\n\n            So the time for u is 1? But note: the problem says we need to infect the whole tree. So for a leaf, we can do:\n\n                Second 0: injection at u -> at the end of second 1, u is infected.\n\n            So the entire subtree is infected at time 1.\n\n          For a node u with k children:\n\n            We can choose the order of injections and spreading.\n\n            We can first inject one of the children? Or we can use spreading from u to one child? But note: we cannot spread from u until at least one child is infected.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n              Option: \n                - We can inject one child at time t1, then that child becomes infected at time t1+1.\n                - Then at the next second (after t1+1) we can use spreading from u to infect another child? But note: the spreading phase happens each second after the injection.\n\n            How about:\n\n              Let the children be v1, v2, ..., vk.\n\n              We can simulate:\n\n                We start by having u infected at time t0 (by injection at time t0-1? because injection happens at the injection phase of each second, and then the next second the node becomes infected? Actually, the problem says: \n                  - At second 0: we start with no infected.\n                  - Then at second 1: we do injection (we can choose one node to infect) and then that node becomes infected at the end of second 1? Actually, the problem says: \n                    \"a vertex is blue if it is infected by injection during the previous second\" -> meaning that after the injection phase of second 1, the vertex becomes blue (infected by injection) and then at the next second (second 2) it becomes red (meaning it was infected earlier than the previous second).\n\n                But the exact timing:\n\n                  We have two phases per second: \n                    Phase1 (spreading): we can spread from a node that has at least one child infected to at most one more child (so we choose one more child to infect, and that child becomes infected at the end of the spreading phase? Actually, the problem says: \n                      \"spread the disease by infecting at most one other child\" -> so the infection happens during the spreading phase? Then the node becomes green (if infected by spreading) at the end of that second? \n\n                  Then Phase2 (injection): we can inject a healthy vertex, which becomes blue at the end of the second.\n\n                However, the problem says: \"a vertex is blue if it is infected by injection during the previous second\", meaning that at the start of the next second, the blue vertex becomes red? \n\n                Actually, the entire process is:\n\n                  At the start of second i, we have some set of infected nodes (which are either blue, green, or red? but the color is just for illustration). \n\n                  Then we do spreading: we can choose to spread from any node that has at least one child infected to one more child. The child we choose becomes infected (and is green at the end of the second).\n\n                  Then we do injection: we choose one healthy node to become infected (blue).\n\n                Then we move to second i+1.\n\n            How to model:\n\n              We can use state: \n                Let f(u) = the minimal time (in seconds) to infect the entire subtree rooted at u, given that we are allowed to start with u already infected? \n\n              But note: we can choose to inject u at any time.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a known solution:\n\n              We can compute the following:\n\n                Let children = list of children of u.\n\n                We sort the children by the time when their entire subtree is infected (i.e., dp[v] for each child v) in descending order.\n\n                Then we consider:\n\n                  We start at time 0 with u not infected.\n\n                  We can inject one of the children? But note: we can also inject u.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                  We must eventually inject u? Or we can get u infected by spreading? \n\n                  How can u be infected? \n                    - By injection: we can choose to inject u at some second.\n                    - Or by spreading: if u has a parent? But note: u is the root? The root has no parent. So the root must be injected? \n\n                  Actually, the root is vertex 1. So we must inject the root at some time? \n\n                  However, we can also get the root infected by spreading? But the root has no parent. So the root must be injected.\n\n                Therefore, we know that the root is injected at some second.\n\n                For a non-root node, it can be infected by spreading from its parent? But note: the spreading operation: \n                    \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\"\n\n                This operation infects a child of v? But we are talking about infecting the parent? \n\n                Actually, the spreading operation only infects children, not parents. So a node can only be infected by:\n                  - Injection (any time we choose)\n                  - Or by spreading from its parent? But the operation is defined on the parent: the parent can spread to one of its children. There is no operation that spreads upward.\n\n                Therefore, a node u (other than the root) must be infected either by injection or by the parent spreading to it? But the problem does not say the parent can spread to the parent's parent? \n\n                Actually, the operation is: \n                  Operation for a vertex v: if at least one child of v is infected, then we can choose one more child (that is currently healthy) to infect.\n\n                So the infection spreads from a node to its children. Therefore, the root must be injected (because it has no parent to spread to it). Then the root can spread to its children? \n\n                How about the children: \n                  We can either inject a child or spread from the root to the child.\n\n                But note: to spread from the root to a child, we require that at least one child of the root is already infected? Then we can spread to one more. So we must first have at least one child of the root infected (by injection) and then we can spread to the others.\n\n            Therefore, the process for the root:\n\n              Let the root have k children.\n\n              We can inject the root at time t0 (so at the end of time t0, the root is blue).\n\n              Then at time t0+1:\n                 Spreading: we can spread from the root to one child? But wait: at the start of time t0+1, the root is infected (blue from the previous injection) and no child is infected. So we cannot spread from the root? \n\n              Therefore, we must inject at least one child of the root? \n\n              Actually, we can at time t0+1:\n                 Injection: we inject one child (say v1). Then at the end of time t0+1, the root is now red (because it was infected more than one second ago) and v1 is blue.\n\n              Then at time t0+2:\n                 Spreading: from the root (which has one child infected: v1) we can spread to another child (v2). Then v2 becomes infected (green) at the end of the spreading phase.\n                 Then we can inject another child? Or we don't need to? \n\n              Alternatively, we can inject multiple children.\n\n            We can formulate:\n\n              Let the root have k children. We must infect all k children.\n\n              We can do:\n\n                 Option 1: \n                    Time 0: inject root -> root becomes blue at time 1 (end of second 1).\n                    Time 1: inject child1 -> child1 becomes blue at time 2.\n                    Then at time 2: \n                         Spreading: from the root (which has child1 infected) we can spread to child2 -> child2 becomes green at time 3.\n                    Then at time 3: \n                         Spreading: from the root we can spread to child3 -> child3 becomes green at time 4.\n                    ... until we infect all children.\n\n                    Total time: 1 (for root) + 1 (for child1) + (k-1) (for spreading the rest) = k+1.\n\n                 Option 2: \n                    Time 0: inject root -> root becomes blue at time 1.\n                    Time 1: inject child1 -> child1 becomes blue at time 2.\n                    Time 2: inject child2 -> child2 becomes blue at time 3.\n                    Then at time 3: \n                         Spreading: from the root (which has two children infected) we can spread to child3 -> child3 becomes green at time 4.\n                    ... \n\n                    This would take 1 (root) + 2 (child1 and child2) + (k-2) = k+1.\n\n                 Actually, the time to infect the root and all children is k+1? \n\n            But wait, what about the children's children? \n\n            We need to infect the entire subtree.\n\n            We can use a DFS that computes the minimal time for the entire subtree.\n\n            Known solution (from Codeforces submissions for the same problem) is:\n\n                We build the tree.\n\n                We let the root be node 1.\n\n                We compute the children for each node.\n\n                Then we do:\n\n                  Let a = []   # for the root, we will collect the dp values of its children? \n\n                  Actually, we do:\n\n                    dp[u] = 0   # we don't use dp[u] directly.\n\n                  Instead, we do:\n\n                    We traverse the tree from the leaves to the root.\n\n                    For a leaf: \n                         We only need to infect the leaf. How? \n                         We can inject the leaf at time t, then it becomes infected at time t+1. \n                         But note: we can also have the parent spread to it? But the parent must have at least one child infected to spread. \n\n                    Actually, for a leaf, we must inject it? Because it has no children to spread to it? \n\n                    However, the leaf can be infected by the parent spreading? But the parent can only spread to the leaf if the parent has at least one child infected? But the leaf is the only child? Then we must first infect the leaf by injection? \n\n                    So for a leaf, we set dp[leaf] = 0? Then we add 1 for the injection? \n\n                Alternatively, we can use a known solution from the code template:\n\n                  The code provided:\n\n                    counter = defaultdict(int)\n\n                    def solve(a):\n                        for ai in a:\n                            counter[ai] += 1\n                        count = list(counter.values())\n                        num_level = len(count)\n                        count.sort()\n\n                        for i in range(num_level):\n                            count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                        L = 0; R = max(count)\n\n                        if R == 0:\n                            return num_level + 1\n\n                        def check(k):\n                            b = count.copy()\n                            for i in range(len(b)):\n                                b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n                            if sum(b) <= k:\n                                return True\n                            return False\n\n                        while R - L > 1:\n                            mid = (R + L) // 2\n                            if(check(mid)):\n                                R = mid\n                            else:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        return num_level + 1 + R\n\n                  What is 'a'? \n                    The input for one test case: the second line is \"n-1 integers: p2, p3, ... pn\"\n\n                  Then in solve(a.split()): \n                    We are counting the frequency of each parent? \n\n                  Actually, the counter counts the frequency of each node as a parent? \n\n                  But note: the input is the parent of vertex i (for i from 2 to n). So the root (1) does not appear? \n\n                  How do we account for the root?\n\n                  The children of the root: \n                    The nodes that have parent '1'? \n\n                  Then the counter counts the number of children for each node? \n\n                  But note: the counter is built from the list of parents. So if we have [1,1,2,2,3] for n=6, then:\n                    counter[1] = 2 (because 1 appears twice: meaning vertices 2 and 3 have parent 1 -> so root has 2 children)\n                    counter[2] = 2 (vertices 4 and 5 have parent 2)\n                    counter[3] = 1 (vertex 6 has parent 3)\n\n                  Then num_level = number of distinct nodes that are parents? But note: the root (1) is included? \n\n                  Then we sort the count (which is the list of the number of children for each node that is a parent).\n\n                  Then we do:\n\n                    for i in range(num_level):\n                        count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                  Why? \n\n                  Then we do a binary search on k (which is the additional time?).\n\n                  Then we return num_level + 1 + R.\n\n                  How does this work?\n\n                  Explanation from known solutions to \"Infected Tree\" (Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2), problem D):\n\n                    The known solution:\n\n                      We note that the infection process:\n\n                         Let f(u) be the minimal time to infect the entire subtree of u.\n\n                         We consider the children of u. Let the children be v1, v2, ..., vk.\n\n                         We can choose the order of injections and spreading.\n\n                         We can simulate:\n\n                           We start by having u infected at time 0? But we can inject u at time 0, so at time 1 u is infected.\n\n                           Then we have k subtrees to infect. We can use the spreading operation to infect one child at a time, but we can also use injections.\n\n                         Actually, we can do:\n\n                           We can infect the children in any order. For each child, we can either:\n\n                             - Inject the child at some time, then the entire subtree of that child will be infected at time = (injection time) + f(v) \n\n                             - Or we can spread to the child: but we can only spread to a child if we have at least one child already infected. \n\n                         However, we can only spread to one child per second? And we can also inject one node per second.\n\n                         The known solution:\n\n                           We sort the children by the time needed to infect their subtree (f(v)) in descending order.\n\n                           Then:\n\n                             f(u) = 0   # we start with u not infected? \n\n                             Actually, we start by injecting u at time 0 -> then at time 1, u is infected.\n\n                             Then we have k children. We can assign an order: we inject the first child at time 1, then the second at time 2, ... but we can also use spreading.\n\n                         Alternate known solution (from a known AC code):\n\n                            We build the tree.\n\n                            We do a DFS:\n\n                              def dfs(u, par):\n                                  children = []\n                                  for v in adj[u]:\n                                      if v == par: continue\n                                      dfs(v, u)\n                                      children.append(f[v])\n                                  if not children: \n                                      f[u] = 0\n                                  else:\n                                      children.sort(reverse=True)\n                                      # then we simulate: \n                                      #   we have the children and we want to assign an infection time for each child.\n                                      #   we start at time 0 (with u not infected) but we will inject u at time 0? \n                                      #   Actually, we assume u is infected at time 0? \n\n                                      # But note: we must have u infected to spread to children? \n\n                                      # Let t = 0 (meaning we have u infected at time 0) is not realistic because we need to inject u.\n\n                                      # Instead, we consider:\n\n                                      #   We have u infected at time t0 (which we set to 0 for the relative time in the subtree).\n\n                                      #   Then we have a list of children.

It uses a different approach.\n\n                  The provided code:\n\n                    counter = defaultdict(int)\n                    for ai in a:   # a is the list of parents (strings) for vertices 2 to n.\n                        counter[ai] += 1\n\n                    count = list(counter.values())\n                    num_level = len(count)   # number of distinct parents? \n\n                    Then we sort count.\n\n                    Then for i in range(num_level):\n                        count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                    Then we do a binary search on R (which is the additional time needed) and then return num_level+1+R.\n\n                  How does this relate to the tree infection?\n\n                  Explanation from a known solution for the same problem (Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2), problem D):\n\n                    We note that the infection process:\n\n                      Second 0: inject the root -> at the end of second 1, the root is infected.\n\n                      Then for each node, we can only infect its children after the node is infected.\n\n                      The number of children of a node u is deg(u).\n\n                      The infection of the children of u can be done in a rate of one or two per second? \n\n                    The known solution:\n\n                      We consider the following:\n\n                         Let the nodes be processed in increasing order of depth? \n\n                         We start with the root: it has deg(1) = d1.\n\n                         Then we have:\n\n                            time = 1   (for the root)\n\n                            Then we have d1 children to infect. We can infect one child at time1 (by injection) and then at time2 we can infect two children (one by injection and one by spreading from the root) and so on.\n\n                         So the time to infect the children of the root is ceil(d1/1) ? \n\n                         But note: we can infect at a rate of 1 at time1 and then 2 per second. So the time to infect d1 children is 1 + ceil(d1/2) ? \n\n                         Actually, the number of seconds after the root is infected to infect all children of the root is: \n                             if d1==0: 0\n                             else: the minimal t such that 1 + 2*(t-1) >= d1   -> t = ceil((d1+1)/2)\n\n                         Then the entire tree is infected at time = 1 + ceil((d1+1)/2)\n\n                         But what about the children's children?\n\n                    The provided code does:\n\n                         count = sorted list of the number of children for each node (that has at least one child).\n\n                         Then for i in range(len(count)):\n                             count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                         Then we do a binary search on R (additional seconds) such that we can cover the remaining work.\n\n                    Explanation from an AC solution:\n\n                         The answer = (number of nodes that have children) + 1 + (additional time R)\n\n                         And R is the minimal number such that we can cover the \"remaining work\" in R seconds.\n\n                         The \"remaining work\": for a node u that has c children, we have already accounted for i+2 of them? \n\n                         What is i? the index in the sorted list.\n\n                         Then count[i] = max(c - i - 2, 0) is the number of children of u that are not covered by the initial allocation.\n\n                         Then we need to cover these count[i] children with R seconds? \n\n                         How? \n\n                         We can do up to one injection per second and one spread per second per node? \n\n                         Actually, the additional R seconds can be used to cover the remaining children by injections and spreads.\n\n                         Specifically, in R seconds, we can do R injections and also we can do R spreads (because each node can only spread one child per second, but note: we have multiple nodes? and we can do one spread per node per second? \n\n                         However, the problem says: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\"\n\n                         This means that in one second, we can spread from every node that has at least one child infected to one more child. So the number of spreads per second is not limited by R, but by the number of nodes that have children and that have at least one child already infected.\n\n                         But the provided code does:\n\n                             def check(k):\n                                 b = count.copy()\n                                 for i in range(len(b)):\n                                     b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n                                 if sum(b) <= k:\n                                     return True\n                                 return False\n\n                         This means: we are allowed to do k injections? and then the spreads can cover the rest? \n\n                         But note: the spreads are free in the sense that we can do as many as we want per second (one per node) as long as we have at least one child infected for that node.\n\n                         However, the catch: we can only spread one child per node per second. And we have already accounted for the initial allocation (which is i+2 for the i-th node in the sorted list) and then we have count[i] = c_i - i - 2 remaining for node i.\n\n                         Then in k seconds, we can do k injections (anywhere) and also we can spread up to k times from each node? \n\n                         But note: we can only spread one child per node per second. So for a node i, we can spread at most k times? \n\n                         Actually, the spreads are not limited by k per node, but by the number of seconds: in k seconds, we can spread at most k times from a particular node? \n\n                         However, the provided code does: \n                             b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)   # meaning we can use up to k spreads for node i? \n\n                         Then we require that the total remaining b (after subtracting k from each node) is <= k.\n\n                         Why? \n\n                         Explanation: \n                             The total number of spreads we can do in k seconds is k (because we can only do one spread per node per second? but note: we have many nodes) -> actually, we can do one spread per node per second, so in k seconds, we can do up to k spreads per node? \n\n                         But that is not true: we can do one spread per node per second, so for a particular node, we can do at most k spreads in k seconds. \n\n                         Therefore, for node i, we have b[i] remaining children to infect. We can use spreads for node i: at most k spreads (in k seconds) for node i, so we can cover up to k children of node i by spreading. \n\n                         Therefore, if b[i] <= k, then we can cover node i. Otherwise, we need more than k seconds.\n\n                         But then why do we do sum(b) <= k? \n\n                         Actually, we have two ways to infect a child: \n                             - Injection: one child per second (anywhere)\n                             - Spreading: one child per node per second.\n\n                         In k seconds, we can do k injections and also we can do one spread per node (but note: we have many nodes) -> actually, we can do one spread per node per second, so in k seconds, we can do k spreads per node? \n\n                         But wait: the problem says: \"for each vertex v\", meaning that in one second, we can spread from every vertex that has at least one child infected. So in one second, we can spread from multiple vertices. \n\n                         Therefore, in one second, we can spread from as many vertices as we want (as long as they have at least one child infected). \n\n                         So the total number of spreads we can do in k seconds is: (number of nodes that have children) * k? \n\n                         That would be too many.\n\n                         Actually, the problem says: \"you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\" -> so per vertex, per second, at most one child.\n\n                         Therefore, in one second, we can spread from every vertex that has at least one child infected to one more child. So the total spreads in one second is up to (number of nodes that have children and that have at least one child infected).\n\n                         But note: we are in the additional k seconds. We have already allocated the initial i+2 for the i-th node? \n\n                         The known solution in the provided code is:\n\n                             count = sorted list of the number of children for each node (that has children) in increasing order? \n\n                             Then for i in range(len(count)):\n                                 count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                             Then we do a binary search on R (which is the additional seconds) such that:\n\n                                 We can cover the remaining count[i] for each node i by: \n                                     - We can use up to R seconds.\n                                     - In these R seconds, we can do R injections (which can be used anywhere) and also we can do R spreads in total (because in one second, we can only do one spread per second globally? \n\n                         But the check function is:\n\n                             def check(k):\n                                 b = count.copy()\n                                 for i in range(len(b)):\n                                     b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n                                 if sum(b) <= k:\n                                     return True\n                                 return False\n\n                         This means: we are allowed to reduce the remaining work for each node by k (because in k seconds, we can do one spread per node? but note: we can do one spread per node per second, so for a node, we can do up to k spreads in k seconds? -> then we can reduce the remaining work for node i by up to k.\n\n                         Then the total remaining work is sum(b) after this reduction. And then we can cover that by injections: one injection per second, so we need at least sum(b) seconds? \n\n                         But we have only k seconds. In k seconds, we can do k injections. So we require sum(b) <= k.\n\n                         Therefore, the condition is: after using up to k spreads per node (which reduces the remaining work for node i by k), the total remaining work (which must be covered by injections) is at most k.\n\n                         Then the minimal R is the minimal k such that check(k) is true.\n\n                         Then the answer for the test case is: \n                             num_level (which is the number of nodes that have children) + 1 (for the root) + R.\n\n                  Why +1 for the root? \n                      Because we start by injecting the root at time0, then at time1 the root is infected. Then we start infecting the children. The time for infecting the children of the root and the children's children is accounted for by the additional R seconds? \n\n                  But note: the initial allocation (i+2) for the i-th node in the sorted list: what is that?\n\n                  Example: \n                      n=1: only the root -> then the answer should be 1.\n                      In the code: \n                          num_level = 0 -> then if R==0: return 0+1+0 = 1? but then we have the condition if R==0: return num_level+1 -> 1.\n\n                  Example with one child of the root:\n                      The tree: \n                          1 -- 2\n\n                      Then the parent list: [1] (for vertex2)\n\n                      Then counter: { '1': 1 } -> count = [1]\n\n                      Then for i=0: count[0] = max(1 - 0 - 2, 0) = max(-1,0)=0.\n\n                      Then R = max(count)=0 -> then the condition if R==0: return 0+1 = 1? but then we return 0+1+0 = 1? \n\n                      But the answer should be 2 seconds:\n\n                          Second0: inject the root -> at the end of second1, the root is infected.\n                          Second1: inject the child (vertex2) -> at the end of second2, the child is infected.\n\n                      So the minimal seconds is 2.\n\n                  How does the provided code work for this example?\n\n                      num_level = 1\n                      count = [0] -> then R = max(count)=0 -> then the condition if R==0: return num_level+1 = 1+1 = 2.\n\n                  So it returns 2.\n\n                  Therefore, the formula: answer = num_level + 1 + R   works.\n\n                  But what is the initial allocation (i+2) doing? \n\n                  In the example: \n                      i=0: 0+2 = 2, then we subtract that from the number of children (which is 1) -> 1-2 = -1 -> then we set to 0.\n\n                  Why 2? \n\n                  Explanation: \n                      We have the root infected at time1.\n                      Then for the root (which is the only node with children), we can do:\n\n                         At time1: we inject one child -> then the child is infected at time2.\n                         But also, at time2: we can spread from the root to one more child? but there is no more child.\n\n                      So we only need one injection for the child.\n\n                  Why did we subtract 2? \n\n                  The known solution in an editorial: \n                      https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/102562\n\n                  According to the editorial for \"Infected Tree\":\n\n                      Let's store in array d the number of children for each node. Then sort this array in the increasing order.\n\n                      Then we will try to determine the minimum time. Notice that the infection process can be divided into two stages.\n\n                      In the first stage, we infect the children of the node. The time to infect the children of a node u is at least the number of children of u. But also, we can use spreading to reduce the number of injections.\n\n                      The editorial solution is the same as the provided code.\n\n                  Therefore, we trust the provided code.\n\n                  The TODO in program2 is in the binary search:\n\n                        while R - L > 1:\n                            mid = (R + L) // 2\n                            if check(mid):\n                                R = mid\n                            else:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n                  We need to update L or R? \n\n                  We are searching for the minimal R such that check(R) is true.\n\n                  The binary search is set up:\n\n                        L = 0, R = max(count)   (which is the maximum of the count array after the initial subtraction)\n\n                        Then while R-L>1:\n                            mid = (L+R)//2\n                            if check(mid): \n                                R = mid\n                            else:\n                                L = mid   # because if mid is not enough, then we need a larger R.\n\n                  But note: we are searching in the range [0, max_count]. We want the minimal R such that check(R) is true.\n\n                  The current code:\n\n                        if check(mid): \n                            R = mid   # because mid is enough, so we try a smaller R.\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: set L = mid   because mid is not enough, so we need R>mid.\n\n                  Therefore, the missing line is: L = mid\n\n Program3:\n\n   We are given a string s of length n (only 'W','R','B') representing a row of cells.\n\n   We can use a stamp of length 2: it stamps two adjacent cells as either \"RB\" or \"BR\". The stamp must be placed completely on the cells. We can stamp multiple times on the same cell.\n\n   We start from a white row.\n\n   We are to determine if we can achieve the string s.\n\n   Constraints: the total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n   Approach:\n\n   Note: \n        - The stamp covers two adjacent cells. \n        - The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\n\n   Observations:\n\n        1. The entire row must be non-white? Not necessarily: we can have white cells? \n\n           But the stamp always colors two adjacent cells (one red and one blue). So if there is a white cell, then that cell was never stamped? \n\n           However, the problem says: \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells\". So we cannot stamp partially. But we can stamp on any two adjacent cells arbitrarily many times.\n\n           Also, note: we start with all white. Then we stamp. So if a cell is white, it means it was never stamped? \n\n           But wait: if we stamp a cell multiple times, can we revert it to white? \n\n           The stamp has two types: \n                Type1: left red, right blue -> if we apply this to a cell that is currently red, what happens? \n                    The problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\".\n\n                    How is recoloring defined? \n\n                    The example: \n                         WWWWW -> then we stamp on the last two: WWWRB -> then we stamp on the middle two: W WRB -> becomes WBRB? \n\n                    But note: the stamping is not additive. The problem does not specify the color mixing. \n\n                    Actually, the problem says: \"recolors both cells\". It means it sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp.\n\n                    So if we stamp a cell multiple times, the last stamp that covers that cell determines the color.\n\n           Therefore, a white cell must never be stamped.\n\n        2. What are the necessary conditions?\n\n           Condition 1: There must be at least one non-white cell? Otherwise, if the string is all white, then we don't need to stamp -> but the problem says \"zero or more times\". So all white is achievable.\n\n           Condition 2: We cannot have a single non-white cell? \n\n                Because the stamp covers two adjacent cells. So if there is exactly one non-white cell, then we must have stamped a pair that included that cell and an adjacent cell. But then the adjacent cell would also be non-white. Contradiction.\n\n           Therefore, we must have at least two non-white cells? \n\n           But note: what if the string is \"RW\"? \n                We can stamp the first two: \n                    Initially: WW\n                    Stamp as RB: then we get RB -> then we don't stamp the last cell? so we have R and then the last cell is white? \n\n                But the example: \n                    n=3: \"RWB\" -> is that possible? \n\n                Actually, the example in the note: \n                    \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                The second test case: n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO.\n                The third test case: n=1, s=\"B\" -> NO.\n                The fourth test case: n=2, s=\"RW\" -> is that possible? \n\n                    We can stamp the first two as RB: then we get RB -> but we want RW? \n\n                Actually, we cannot have one red and one white? because the stamp always colors two cells. So if we stamp the first two, we get two non-white cells. \n\n                Therefore, if there is a non-white cell, then at least one of its adjacent cells must be non-white? \n\n                But wait: we can stamp multiple times. \n\n                Example: n=3, s = \"R W B\": \n                    We want: \n                         position0: R, position1: W, position2: B.\n\n                    How? \n                         Step1: stamp on positions1 and2: so we set them to (say) RB -> then we have: W, R, B? -> no.\n\n                    Alternatively: \n                         Step1: stamp on positions0 and1: as RB -> then we have R, B, W.\n                         Step2: stamp on positions0 and1: as BR -> then we have B, R, W.\n                         Step3: stamp on positions1 and2: as BR -> then we have B, B, R? -> not matching.\n\n                It seems difficult.\n\n           Known solution for the same problem (Codeforces Round #827 (Div. 4), problem G):\n\n                Conditions:\n\n                  1. The entire string must not have any isolated non-white cell. That is, we can split the string by 'W' and then each contiguous segment of non-white must satisfy:\n\n                  2. In a contiguous segment (without any 'W'):\n\n                         - The length must be at least 2? \n                         - But note: we can have a segment of length 1? -> then it's impossible.\n\n                  3. Also, the entire segment must be colorable by the stamps. \n\n                But note: the stamp always stamps two adjacent cells: one red and one blue. \n\n                How about we consider the following:\n\n                  In a contiguous segment of length L (>=2), we can assign the colors arbitrarily? \n\n                  However, the stamp has two types: \n                      Type1: RB (left red, right blue)\n                      Type2: BR (left blue, right red)\n\n                  And we can stamp any number of times, and the last stamp on a cell wins.\n\n                  Therefore, we can achieve any coloring for the segment as long as:\n\n                      - The number of reds and the number of blues in the segment are not independent.\n\n                  But note: we can also stamp overlapping. \n\n                Known necessary conditions:\n\n                  Condition 1: The entire string must not have any contiguous segment of non-white of length 1.\n\n                  Condition 2: In a contiguous segment of non-white, the coloring must be such that it is possible to assign the entire segment with the stamps. \n\n                  How to check a contiguous segment?\n\n                      We can use dynamic programming? but the length can be up to 10^5 and total n<=10^5, but the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n                  Alternate known solution:\n\n                      We note that the stamping operations are reversible? \n\n                  Insight:\n\n                      We can consider the following:\n\n                         Let\u2019s denote the desired pattern as a string s.\n\n                         We can define an array a of length n: \n                             a[0] = 0\n                             For i>=1: \n                                 a[i] = a[i-1] + (1 if s[i]=='R' else -1)   # but wait, what about blue?\n\n                         But note: the stamp has two types: \n                             RB: then the left cell is R and the right is B -> we can think of R as +1 and B as -1? \n\n                         Then the entire row has a total sum? \n\n                  However, a known solution is:\n\n                      We split the string by 'W'. For each segment that is not empty:\n\n                         If the segment has length 1: then return \"NO\".\n\n                         Else, check that the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n\n                         Why? \n\n                         Because if the segment is all 'R', then how to achieve it? \n\n                             Example: \"RR\"\n\n                             We can do:\n                                 Step1: stamp the two as RB -> then we have RB.\n                                 Step2: stamp the first two again as RB? -> then we set the first two to RB: so the first becomes R (because the last stamp on the first cell is R) and the second becomes B -> we get RB, not RR.\n\n                             Alternatively, \n                                 Step1: stamp as BR -> then we get BR.\n                                 Step2: stamp as BR again? then we get BR -> not RR.\n\n                         But wait: we can stamp overlapping:\n\n                             Example for \"RR\" on three cells? \n\n                         Actually, the segment is contiguous and we are only allowed to stamp on two adjacent cells. \n\n                         For \"RR\" (two cells):\n\n                             We can only stamp on these two. We have two types:\n\n                                 Type1: RB -> then we get RB -> not RR.\n                                 Type2: BR -> then we get BR -> not RR.\n\n                         So we cannot achieve \"RR\".\n\n                         Similarly, we cannot achieve \"BB\".\n\n                         But what about \"RBR\" (three cells)? \n\n                             We want: R, B, R.\n\n                             Step1: stamp the first two as RB: -> R, B, W -> then we have the third cell white.\n                             Step2: stamp the last two as BR: -> R, B becomes overwritten? \n\n                                 When we stamp the last two: \n                                    The second cell: currently B, we stamp with BR: so the second cell becomes B (from the stamp) and the third becomes R -> then we have R, B, R.\n\n                             So \"RBR\" is achievable.\n\n                         Therefore, a segment must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n                  Therefore, the conditions:\n\n                      - Split the string by 'W' into segments.\n                      - For each segment:\n                            if the segment is not empty:\n                                if len(segment)==1: return \"NO\"\n                                else: \n                                    if the segment contains only 'R' or only 'B': return \"NO\"\n\n                      - If all segments are valid, return \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n                  But what about the entire string being non-white? \n\n                  Example: \"RRB\": \n                      It has one segment: \"RRB\" -> has at least one R and at least one B -> valid.\n\n                  Example: \"R\" -> invalid.\n\n                  Example: \"RW\" -> \n                      Split: ['R', ''] -> the segment \"R\" has length 1 -> invalid.\n\n                  But note: the segment after splitting by 'W' might be empty? we skip empty segments.\n\n                  Also, what about the example: \"RWB\" -> \n                      Segments: ['R', 'B'] -> both have length 1 -> invalid.\n\n                  And the example: \"BRW\" -> \n                      Segments: ['BR'] -> valid? \n                         But wait: the segment is \"BR\": \n                             It has both R and B -> valid.\n\n                  However, the example \"BRW\" is achievable? \n\n                      We have three cells: \n                         We want: B, R, W.\n\n                      Step1: stamp the first two: we can choose BR -> then we get B, R, W -> done.\n\n                  So it is valid.\n\n                  But the example \"RW\" is not valid? \n\n                      We want: R at position0 and W at position1.\n\n                      How to achieve? \n                         We cannot stamp only the first cell? \n                         We must stamp two adjacent cells. The only two adjacent cells are positions0 and1. \n                         If we stamp them, then we get either \"RB\" or \"BR\". We cannot get \"R\" at position0 and \"W\" at position1 because the stamp would have colored position1.\n\n                  Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n                  However, what about a segment of length 2 that is \"RB\" or \"BR\"? \n                      \"RB\": has both R and B -> valid.\n                      \"BB\": invalid.\n\n                  But note: what if we have a segment of length>=2 that has both R and B? \n\n                  Example: \"RRRRBBBB\" -> valid.\n\n                  How to achieve any pattern that has at least one R and one B? \n\n                      We can use overlapping stamps to adjust the colors arbitrarily? \n\n                  Actually, we can achieve any pattern that has at least one R and one B in the segment? \n\n                  Why? \n\n                      We can use a constructive method:\n\n                         We can start from the left and fix the colors one by one.\n\n                      But note: the stamp sets two cells at a time. \n\n                  However, the known solution is to check:\n\n                      for each contiguous segment of non-white:\n                         if len(segment)==1: return \"NO\"\n                         if 'R' not in segment or 'B' not in segment: return \"NO\"\n\n                  Then return \"YES\".\n\n                  But note: the entire string might be non-white?

We want:\n\n        if the segment p is non-empty and (either the length is 1 OR the segment does not contain both 'R' and 'B')\n\n   We can write:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)):\n\n   But note: if len(p)==1, then the condition is true. \n        If len(p)>=2, then we require that either 'R' not in p OR 'B' not in p? \n\n        But we want: if the segment does not have both colors -> that is equivalent to ('R' not in p) OR ('B' not in p)\n\n   So the condition is correct.\n\n   However, we can also write:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\n\n   This is clearer.\n\n   Therefore, we choose:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s_clean = s.strip()\n            parts = s_clean.split('W')\n            for p in parts:\n                if p:   # non-empty\n                    if len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n   But note: what if there are multiple segments that are invalid? We break at the first invalid segment.\n\n   This is efficient.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program3 is:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        for p in parts:\n            if p != '':\n                if len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                    print('NO')\n                    break\n        else:\n            print('YES')\n\n   However, we can write:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        if any(p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s_clean.split('W')):\n            print('NO')\n        else:\n            print('YES')\n\n   But note: the condition: \n        (p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p))\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n            if p is non-empty and (either length1 or missing R or missing B)\n\n        But we want to break as soon as we find one.\n\n   The any() function will iterate all segments? \n\n   Since the total length is the length of the string, and the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, it is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            if any(p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\n                print('NO')\n            else:\n                print('YES')\n\n   However, we can also break early with a loop.\n\n   We choose the for-else with break for clarity and potential early termination.\n\n   But note: the worst-case total length is 10^5, so it doesn't matter.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        for p in parts:\n            if p:   # non-empty\n                if len(p)==1:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait: the condition for the second if: if we have a segment of length>=2 and it is missing either R or B, then we break.\n\n   This is the same as:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p)):\n\n   But note: if the segment has length>=2, then we only break if it is missing at least one color. \n\n   However, we can combine:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\n\n   We'll use the combined condition.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program3:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        for p in parts:\n            if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But note: the condition \"or\" is not the same as \"and\" for the colors. \n\n        We want: if the segment has at least two characters, then we require both colors. So if either 'R' is not in p or 'B' is not in p, then it fails.\n\n        So the condition: \n            if p and (len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)):\n\n        This is: \n            if p is non-empty and (condition1 or condition2 or condition3) \n            condition1: len(p)==1 -> then we break.\n            condition2: 'R' not in p -> then we break.\n            condition3: 'B' not in p -> then we break.\n\n        But note: if the segment has both colors, then condition2 and condition3 are false, and if the length is not 1, then we don't break.\n\n        So it is correct.\n\n   However, we can write it as:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\n\n   This is clearer.\n\n   Let me change to:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\n\n   Then we break and print \"NO\". Otherwise, we print \"YES\".\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        for p in parts:\n            if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But note: the condition \"not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)\" is equivalent to \"not 'R' in p or not 'B' in p\".\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or not 'R' in p or not 'B' in p):\n\n   But that is the same as the first condition.\n\n   We'll use the more explicit one.\n\n   However, the original condition in the problem's note: \n        \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n        The second test case: n=1, s=\"R\" -> then we break and print \"NO\".\n\n   So it is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the missing code accordingly.\n\n   Summary of the missing code:\n\n   program1: \n        In the TODO: \n            ret = index + 1\n\n   program2:\n        In the TODO: \n            L = mid\n\n   program3:\n        The entire for loop body:\n\n            s_clean = s.strip()\n            parts = s_clean.split('W')\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n   But note: the program3 code is given as:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   So we must write the code that goes in the for loop.\n\n   However, we must not output the entire program, only the missing code.\n\n   We output in JSON format.\n\n   Example:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"ret = index + 1\",\n          \"program2\": \"L = mid\",\n          \"program3\": \"s_clean = s.strip()\\nparts = s_clean.split('W')\\nfor p in parts:\\n    if p and (len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\\n        print('NO')\\n        break\\nelse:\\n    print('YES')\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program3 code is multiple lines.

We must be careful.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write without the for-else by using a flag:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p: \n                if len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   This is also acceptable.\n\n   We choose the flag version for clarity.\n\n   Therefore, program3:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p:   # non-empty\n                if len(p)==1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   But note: we can combine the condition:\n\n        if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n            valid = False\n            break\n\n   So:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   We'll use this.\n\n   Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"ret = index + 1\",\n          \"program2\": \"L = mid\",\n          \"program3\": \"s_clean = s.strip()\\nparts = s_clean.split('W')\\nvalid = True\\nfor p in parts:\\n    if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n        valid = False\\n        break\\nprint('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program3 code must be exactly the body of the for loop.\n\n   We output the string with newlines as \\n.\n\n   We assume the code will be inserted with the same indentation.\n\n   The given program3 has:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with:\n\n        s_clean = s.strip()\n        parts = s_clean.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for p in parts:\n            if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   The indentation: the entire block is at the same level as the for loop.\n\n   Therefore, we output the JSON as above.\n\n   Let me write the program3 string with proper newlines and without extra spaces.\n\n   We write:\n\n        \"s_clean = s.strip()\\nparts = s_clean.split('W')\\nvalid = True\\nfor p in parts:\\n    if p and (len(p)==1 or 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n        valid = False\\n        break\\nprint('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n   This is 4 lines of code.\n\n   We are done."
