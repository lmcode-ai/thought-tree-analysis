The provided code precomputes an array `cnt` where `cnt[k]` is the number of triangles formed by `k` lines. The array is built in a loop until the total triangles exceed 10^9. The `solve` function uses binary search to find the smallest index `m` such that `cnt[m] >= t` (where `t` is the test case integer). The missing part is in the binary search: when `cnt[m] < t`, we need to adjust the search range. The missing code in the binary search is the else branch. We want to set `s` to `m+1` because we are looking for the first index where `cnt` is at least `t`. So the missing line in program1.py is:\n    s = m + 1\n\nBut note: the binary search is set up so that `e` is the answer. We are using:\n    s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n    while s < e:\n        m = (s+e)//2\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            s = m + 1\n\nThen we return `str(s)`. So the missing code for program1.py is: `s = m + 1`\n\n### Program2.py\nThis program is about cleaning a 2-row grid with a robot that moves to the closest dirty cell.",

But there is no need because there is no tie. So we can do one column at a time. But the known solution for this problem (CodeForces 1579F) uses:\n\n    dp[i][0] = a[0][i] + max(dp[i+1][0], a[1][i] + dp[i+1][1])\n    dp[i][1] = a[1][i] + max(dp[i+1][1], a[0][i] + dp[i+1][0]) But that is for a different state definition. Given the complexity, and the provided code structure, I think the intended else branch is:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j]) But let me test with the examples. Example 1: n=2, grid:\n    row0: '10'\n    row1: '10'\n\nThe robot starts at (0,0) which is clean. The dirty cells are (0,1) and (1,0) and (1,1). We can pre-clean one cell. The answer is 2. How would the DP work? We have N=2. G = [\n    [1, 0, 0],   # row0: '10' -> [1,0] and then we added [0] [1, 0, 0]    # row1: '10' -> [1,0] and then [0]\n] But wait, the input is two lines of length n. The first line is the first row, the second line is the second row. The starting cell (1,1) is clean. In 0-indexed, the starting cell is (0,0). The grid is:\n\n    row0: first line: '10' -> [1, 0] -> but the starting cell (0,0) is clean? The problem says the starting cell is clean. So the first character of the first line is '0'? Actually, the first example in the note: \n    \"In the first example, you can clean the cell (1,2), so the path of the robot is (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2). \"\n\nThe grid has 2 columns. The starting cell (1,1) is clean. The grid is:\n\n    row0: '10'? but then (1,1) is the first cell -> row0[0] should be '0'? row1: '10' But the input says: the first line is the 1st row, the second line is the 2nd row. So for the first example, the input is:\n    n=2\n    first row: '00'  ? -> because (1,1) is clean and (1,2) is dirty? second row: '10'\n\nBut the note says: we clean the cell (1,2) -> which is row0, column1 (0-indexed). Then the robot goes (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). So the grid is:\n\n    row0: [ at (1,1): clean, (1,2): dirty ] -> '01'? row1: [ at (2,1): dirty, (2,2): dirty ] -> '11' But the input is:\n\n    n=2\n    01\n    11 But the starting cell (1,1) is clean -> so row0[0] is '0'. So G[0][0]=0, G[0][1]=1, G[1][0]=1, G[1][1]=1. We added an extra column of 0: so G becomes:\n\n    row0: [0,1,0]\n    row1: [1,1,0]\n\nNow, we initialize:\n    dp[1][0] = G[1][1] = 1   (because 1-0=1, so row1 at index1: G[1][1]=1)\n    dp[1][1] = G[0][1] = 1   (because 1-1=0, so row0 at index1: G[0][1]=1) Then we go to i=0 (from N-2=0 to 0). For j=0 (row0 at column0): \n    Option1: move right in row0: G[0][1] (which is 1) + dp[1][0] = 1 + 1 = 2. Then check if G[1][0] is dirty? yes, it is 1. But G[0][1] is 1 -> so we are in the if branch. Then alternative: 1 + G[1][1] + G[1][2] + dp[2][1] = 1 + 1 + 0 + dp[2][1] = 2 + 0 = 2. So dp[0][0] = max(2,2) = 2. For j=1 (row1 at column0): \n    Option1: move right in row1: G[1][1] (1) + dp[1][1] (1) = 2. Then check if G[0][0] is dirty? no, it is 0 -> skip. So dp[0][0]=2, which is the answer. Now, what if we use the else branch for j=0? We didn't use it because we were in the if branch. Example 2: n=2, grid:\n    n=2\n    first row: '00'\n    second row: '11' But the note says: we can leave it as is. The robot path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2). So the answer is 2. The grid:\n\n    row0: [0,0] -> [0,0,0]\n    row1: [1,1] -> [1,1,0]\n\nInitialize:\n    dp[1][0] = G[1][1] = 1\n    dp[1][1] = G[0][1] = 0\n\nFor j=0 (row0 at column0): Option1: G[0][1] (0) + dp[1][0] (1) = 1. Then check G[1][0] (1) -> yes, and G[0][1] is 0 -> else branch. Then: 1 + G[1][1] (1) + dp[1][1] (0) = 1+1+0 = 2. So dp[0][0] = max(1,2)=2. For j=1 (row1 at column0):\n    Option1: G[1][1] (1) + dp[1][1] (0) = 1.\n    Then check G[0][0] (0) -> skip. So the answer is 2. Therefore, the else branch should be:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: in the if branch, we have:\n\n    if G[1-j][i]:   # which is true in the example for j=0 and i=0: G[1][0] is 1. then if G[j][i+1]:  # in the example, G[0][1] is 0 -> so we go to else branch. So the else branch is taken. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n\n    dp[i][j] = G[j][i+1] + dp[i+1][j]   # option1 Then in the if branch, when there is a dirty cell in the opposite row and the same column, and if the next in the same row is dirty, we do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j]) And in the else branch (when the next in the same row is clean), we do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j]) So the missing code is:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j]) But note: what if `i+1` is beyond the grid? We have added an extra column, so `i+1` is at most `N-1` (because `i` goes from 0 to `N-2`). And we have `dp[i+1][1-j]` defined for `i+1` in [0, N-1] (we initialized for `i=N-1`). So it's safe. ### Program3.py\nThis program is about counting trees (with a specific attachment: vertex i (>=2) is attached to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) for which vertex i is the centroid.

So we can simply do:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        return (x * y) % MOD But then if we call with three, it will ignore the third? That would be wrong. Looking at the code: there is no call with three arguments. So we can do:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        # If c is provided and not zero, multiply all three. if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD But to be safe for any number of multiplications, we might use:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD This works for two or three arguments. But note: the function is called in the backward pass with two arguments: `modmul(out[i], invs(i))` -> then c=0, so we do (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD. So the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c != 0:\n        res = res * c\n    return res % MOD But we can write it in one line:\n\n    return (x * y * (c if c != 0 else 1)) % MOD But that would multiply by 1 when c=0?

But what if c is provided and is 0? Then we do (x*y*0) % MOD = 0. But that is not the same as (x*y) % MOD. So we must not multiply by c if c==0? But the default is 0, and we want to multiply only two when c=0. Actually, the function is designed to multiply two or three numbers. When c is 0 (the default) we multiply two. When c is nonzero, we multiply three. So we can do:\n\n    if c == 0:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n    else:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function might be called with c=0 explicitly? Probably not.

So we write with spaces: `G[1 - j][i + 1]`. But in the else branch, we write: `G[1 - j][i + 1]`. So the string for program2 is: \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1 - j][i + 1] + dp[i + 1][1 - j])\"\n\nBut note: the code in the if branch uses `G[1 - j][i + 1]` and `G[1 - j][i + 2]`. So we use the same style. Finally, the JSON string must escape quotes? But we are not using quotes inside. So we can write as is. Let me write the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"s = m + 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1 - j][i + 1] + dp[i + 1][1 - j])\",\n    \"program3\": \"res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut the newlines in program3 must be represented as \\n. Alternatively, we can write the program3 code in one line? But that would be less readable.",

Our code should be:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c != 0:\n        res = res * c\n    return res % MOD But each line is indented by 4 spaces.

Therefore, the string should be:\n\n    \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\" But the original TODO was a comment with 4 spaces.

We wrote `G[1-j][i+1]`. The original code has `G[1 - j][i + 1]`? Actually, the code has `G[1 - j][i + 1]` in the if branch. So we write it as `G[1-j][i+1]` or `G[1 - j][i + 1]`?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### Program1.py\nThe problem is about finding the minimum number of lines (on a hexagonal grid) needed to form at least `n` equilateral triangles.\n\nThe provided code precomputes an array `cnt` where `cnt[k]` is the number of triangles formed by `k` lines. The array is built in a loop until the total triangles exceed 10^9.\n\nThe `solve` function uses binary search to find the smallest index `m` such that `cnt[m] >= t` (where `t` is the test case integer). The missing part is in the binary search: when `cnt[m] < t`, we need to adjust the search range.\n\nThe missing code in the binary search is the else branch. We want to set `s` to `m+1` because we are looking for the first index where `cnt` is at least `t`.\n\nSo the missing line in program1.py is:\n    s = m + 1\n\nBut note: the binary search is set up so that `e` is the answer. We are using:\n    s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n    while s < e:\n        m = (s+e)//2\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            s = m + 1\n\nThen we return `str(s)`.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is: `s = m + 1`\n\n### Program2.py\nThis program is about cleaning a 2-row grid with a robot that moves to the closest dirty cell. We can pre-clean some dirty cells to avoid the robot malfunctioning (which happens when there are multiple closest dirty cells). We want to maximize the number of dirty cells left (i.e., minimize the cleaning we do) such that the robot never faces a tie.\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming. The state `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left (or the maximum that the robot will clean?) starting from column `i` and row `j` (0-indexed) to the end, under the condition that the robot doesn't malfunction.\n\nThe grid is stored in `G` (two rows, and we added an extra column of zeros at the end). The DP is computed from right to left (from column `N-2` down to 0).\n\nIn the inner loop, for a state `(i, j)` (meaning the robot is at row `j` of column `i`), we consider two options:\n\nOption 1: The robot moves right in the same row to `(j, i+1)`. Then the state becomes `G[j][i+1]` (which is 1 if that cell is dirty) plus `dp[i+1][j]`.\n\nOption 2: If the cell in the opposite row at the same column `(1-j, i)` is dirty, then we have an opportunity to move to that row? But note: the robot must go to the closest dirty cell. However, the grid is only two rows and we are moving from left to right? Actually, the robot can move in any direction, but note the grid has two rows and `n` columns.\n\nThe critical part is the if-block when `G[1-j][i]` is dirty (i.e., 1). Then we have two subcases:\n\nSubcase 2a: If the next cell in the same row `(j, i+1)` is dirty, then we have a potential tie? Because the distance to `(1-j, i)` is 1 (if we are at `(j, i)` then `(1-j, i)` is adjacent vertically) and the distance to `(j, i+1)` is 1. So we cannot have both dirty? Actually, the problem says we can clean some cells arbitrarily. So we have to choose which one to clean? But note: we are trying to maximize the number of dirty cells left. The DP state is the maximum dirty cells we can leave from this state without causing a malfunction.\n\nThe code already handles the case when `G[j][i+1]` is 1: then we consider an alternative path: clean the cell `(j, i+1)`? Actually, the code does:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n\nThis alternative path means: we move to `(1-j, i)` (which is dirty) and then we are forced to clean that cell (so we count 1 for that cell) and then we are at `(1-j, i)`. Then we look at the next two cells in the opposite row? Actually, after cleaning `(1-j, i)`, the robot is at `(1-j, i)`. Then the next moves: we can go to `(1-j, i+1)` and then `(1-j, i+2)`? But note: the grid has two rows. However, the state `dp[i+2][1-j]` is for starting at column `i+2` and row `1-j`.\n\nBut what if `G[j][i+1]` is 0? Then we don't have a tie. So we can move to `(1-j, i)` without any conflict. Then what? After cleaning `(1-j, i)`, we are at `(1-j, i)`. Then we can consider the next moves. However, note that from `(1-j, i)`, the next dirty cell might be in the same row at `(1-j, i+1)` or in the opposite row at `(j, i+1)`? But we are at column `i` and we have already cleaned `(1-j, i)`. The grid at `(1-j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i+2)` might be dirty? And then we can use the state `dp[i+2][1-j]`? Actually, the code adds `G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2]` and then `dp[i+2][1-j]`. This seems to be taking two steps: from `(1-j, i)` we move to `(1-j, i+1)` and then to `(1-j, i+2)`, and then from `(1-j, i+2)` we use the DP state.\n\nBut wait, what if there is a dirty cell at `(j, i+1)`? Then after cleaning `(1-j, i)`, the robot is at `(1-j, i)`. The distance to `(1-j, i+1)` is 1 and to `(j, i+1)` is 2. So the closest is `(1-j, i+1)`. So we move there. Then we clean it (so we count that) and then we are at `(1-j, i+1)`. Then the next closest might be `(1-j, i+2)` (if dirty) or `(j, i+1)`? But note: we are at `(1-j, i+1)`, and `(j, i+1)` is adjacent (distance=1). However, we have not cleaned `(j, i+1)`? But in the state we are considering, we are assuming that we are going to clean the entire grid without malfunction. And we are trying to maximize the dirty cells.\n\nThe problem is that we have two rows and we are processing from left to right. The DP state `dp[i][j]` is defined for the subgrid from column `i` to the end, and the robot is at row `j` of column `i`. But note: the robot might have come from the left? Actually, the DP is computed backwards.\n\nThe missing part is the else branch when `G[j][i+1]` is 0. Then we don't have a tie. So we can move to `(1-j, i)` and then we are at `(1-j, i)`. Then we can move to the next cells. However, we don't necessarily have to move two steps to the right? We can move to `(1-j, i+1)` and then to `(j, i+1)` if it's dirty? But note: the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` is available. Why are we jumping two columns?\n\nLooking at the code when `G[j][i+1]` is 1, they jump two columns: `i+2`. Why? Because they are taking two moves: first to `(1-j, i)` and then to `(1-j, i+1)`? But then they add `G[1-j][i+1]` and `G[1-j][i+2]`? Actually, that doesn't seem right because after cleaning `(1-j, i)`, the robot is at `(1-j, i)`. Then the next move: the closest dirty cell might be `(1-j, i+1)` (if dirty) or `(j, i)` (but we just cleaned it) or `(j, i+1)` (if dirty). But note: we are at `(1-j, i)`, and `(j, i+1)` is at distance 2 (one right and one up/down) and `(1-j, i+1)` is at distance 1. So if `(1-j, i+1)` is dirty, the robot will go there. Then we are at `(1-j, i+1)`. Then the next closest? It could be `(1-j, i+2)` (if dirty) at distance 1, or `(j, i+1)` at distance 1? Then we have a tie! So we cannot have both `(1-j, i+1)` and `(j, i+1)` dirty? \n\nTherefore, to avoid a tie at `(1-j, i+1)`, we must clean one of them? But note: we are allowed to pre-clean arbitrarily. So in the state where we are at `(1-j, i)`, we can choose to clean `(1-j, i+1)` and then `(1-j, i+2)`? But that would be two moves? Then we are at `(1-j, i+2)`. Then we use `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nAlternatively, we might clean `(j, i+1)` and then move to `(1-j, i+1)`? But then we are at `(1-j, i+1)` and then we can move to `(1-j, i+2)`? But note: we are trying to maximize the dirty cells. The code in the if branch (when `G[j][i+1]` is 1) does:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n\nThis means: we clean `(1-j, i)` (counted as 1) and then we get the dirty cells at `(1-j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i+2)` (if they are dirty) and then the state from `i+2` in row `1-j`. But note: we are forced to clean `(1-j, i)`, and then we get the next two in the same row? But what if we don't have two more columns? The grid has an extra column of zeros at the end, so `i+2` might be beyond the grid? Actually, the DP array is of size `N+1` and we are iterating from `N-2` down to 0, so `i+2` is at most `N` (which is safe because we have `dp` for `N`).\n\nNow, in the else branch (when `G[j][i+1]` is 0), we don't have a tie at the first step. So we can move to `(1-j, i)`. Then we are at `(1-j, i)`. Now, what are the dirty cells? The cell `(j, i+1)` is clean (because `G[j][i+1]` is 0). So the next dirty cell might be `(1-j, i+1)` (if dirty) or `(j, i+2)`? But note: the robot is at `(1-j, i)`. The distance to `(1-j, i+1)` is 1, and to `(j, i+2)` is 3? (because we have to go up and then two right). Actually, the distance to `(j, i+2)` is |(1-j) - j| + |i - (i+2)| = 1 + 2 = 3. And to `(1-j, i+2)` is 2. So the closest is `(1-j, i+1)` (if dirty) at distance 1, then `(1-j, i+2)` at distance 2, and then `(j, i+1)` is clean, so the next might be `(j, i+2)` at distance 3? \n\nBut note: we are at `(1-j, i)`. The dirty cells that remain are in the grid from column `i` to the end. However, we have just cleaned `(1-j, i)`. So the dirty cells in column `i` are now gone? Then the next dirty cell in row `1-j` at column `i+1` is the closest. So we move there. Then we clean it. Then we are at `(1-j, i+1)`. Then the next closest? It could be `(1-j, i+2)` (if dirty) at distance 1, or `(j, i+1)` is clean, so the next might be `(j, i+2)` at distance 2? But wait, we are at `(1-j, i+1)`, and `(j, i+2)` is at distance |(1-j)-j| + |(i+1) - (i+2)| = 1 + 1 = 2. And `(1-j, i+2)` is at distance 1. So if `(1-j, i+2)` is dirty, we go there. Then we are at `(1-j, i+2)`. Then we use the state `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nBut what if `(1-j, i+1)` is not dirty? Then we skip that. So we have to check the grid.\n\nHowever, the code in the else branch should be similar to the if branch, but without the possibility of a tie at the first step. So we can do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut wait, the if branch does two columns at once? Actually, the if branch does:\n\n    1 (for cleaning (1-j, i)) \n    + G[1-j][i+1] (if that cell is dirty, we clean it? but then we are at that cell) \n    + G[1-j][i+2] (and then we clean that too? but then we are at (1-j, i+2)) \n    + dp[i+2][1-j] (the state from (1-j, i+2))\n\nThat is, they are cleaning two extra cells? But note: the robot cleans one cell at a time. The state `dp[i][j]` is the maximum dirty cells that the robot will clean from (i, j) to the end? Or the total dirty cells that we leave (so that the robot cleans them without malfunction)? Actually, the problem says: we want the maximum possible number of cells we can leave dirty. And the robot cleans all of them. So the DP state should be the count of dirty cells that the robot cleans from that state.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to pre-clean arbitrarily. So the state `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of dirty cells that we can leave (that the robot will clean) from column `i` to the end, starting at row `j`, without causing a malfunction.\n\nIn the else branch, we are considering the option of cleaning the cell `(1-j, i)` (so we leave it dirty? no, we clean it? Actually, we are leaving as many dirty as possible. But note: we are forced to clean `(1-j, i)` to avoid a tie? Actually, we are not forced: we are allowed to pre-clean arbitrarily. But the state `dp[i][j]` is for the situation where we have already pre-cleaned some cells arbitrarily? Actually, the DP is for the entire process: we are simulating the robot's moves.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: we can clean some cells arbitrarily (before launching the robot). Then we launch the robot. The robot then cleans the rest without malfunction. The goal is to maximize the number of dirty cells left (i.e., minimize the pre-cleaning). So the total dirty cells left is the number the robot cleans.\n\nThe DP state `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of dirty cells that the robot will clean from (i, j) to the end, given that the robot starts at (i, j) and the grid from column `i` to the end is in a state that we have chosen (by pre-cleaning) such that the robot doesn't malfunction and cleans all the dirty cells.\n\nBut note: the grid is fixed? Actually, the input gives the grid. We can only clean dirty cells (we cannot make clean cells dirty). So the grid has some fixed dirty cells. We can choose a subset of the dirty cells to clean arbitrarily. Then we leave the rest for the robot. The robot starts at (0,0) (which is clean) and then cleans the entire grid without malfunction.\n\nThe problem: maximize the number of dirty cells left (i.e., minimize the pre-cleaning). So we want to leave as many dirty cells as possible, but the robot must clean them without malfunction.\n\nThe DP state: we are processing from right to left. The state `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of dirty cells that the robot will clean from column `i` to the end, starting at (j, i), and we have already pre-cleaned some cells arbitrarily (but we cannot make clean cells dirty) and we have ensured that the robot will not malfunction.\n\nHow do we compute it?\n\nOption 1: we move right in the same row: then we clean `(j, i+1)` (if it is dirty) and then we are at `(j, i+1)`. Then we get `dp[i+1][j]`. But note: we are at `(j, i)`, and we move to `(j, i+1)`. The cost is `G[j][i+1]` (which is 1 if dirty) and then `dp[i+1][j]`.\n\nOption 2: we move to the opposite row at the same column: `(1-j, i)`. But we can only do that if that cell is dirty? Actually, we can pre-clean arbitrarily. But if we leave `(1-j, i)` dirty, then the robot will go there. However, we must avoid ties. So if there is a tie at the start (i.e., both `(j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i)` are dirty and at the same distance) then we must pre-clean one of them. But in the else branch, `G[j][i+1]` is 0, so there is no tie. So we can leave `(1-j, i)` dirty. Then the robot moves to `(1-j, i)`. Then we are at `(1-j, i)`. Then we have to consider the next moves.\n\nFrom `(1-j, i)`, the next dirty cells: \n  - `(1-j, i+1)` at distance 1\n  - `(j, i+1)` is clean (because we are in the else branch: `G[j][i+1]` is 0)\n  - `(1-j, i+2)` at distance 2\n  - `(j, i+2)` at distance 2? (because from `(1-j, i)` to `(j, i+2)`: |1-j - j| + |i - (i+2)| = 1+2=3? Actually, from `(1-j, i)` to `(j, i+2)`: the row difference is 1 and the column difference is 2 -> total 3.\n\nBut wait, the distance is Manhattan: |row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|. So from `(1-j, i)` to `(1-j, i+1)`: |0| + |1| = 1.\nFrom `(1-j, i)` to `(1-j, i+2)`: |0|+|2|=2.\nFrom `(1-j, i)` to `(j, i+1)`: |1| + |1| = 2? But `(j, i+1)` is clean? So we don't consider it.\n\nSo the next closest is `(1-j, i+1)` (if dirty) at distance 1. Then we move there. Then we clean it. Then we are at `(1-j, i+1)`. Then the next closest? \n  - `(1-j, i+2)` at distance 1 (if dirty) \n  - `(j, i+1)` is clean? \n  - `(j, i+2)` at distance |1| + |1| = 2? (from `(1-j, i+1)` to `(j, i+2)`: row difference 1, column difference 1 -> 2).\n\nSo if `(1-j, i+2)` is dirty, we move there. Then we are at `(1-j, i+2)`. Then we use `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nBut what if `(1-j, i+1)` is not dirty? Then we skip it. Then the next might be `(1-j, i+2)` at distance 2? But then we move there? Then we clean it and then use `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nSo the alternative path is: we clean `(1-j, i)` (count 1) and then we clean the entire row `1-j` from column `i+1` to the end? But note: we don't have to clean consecutively. The robot will choose the closest. However, if we leave `(1-j, i+1)` dirty, the robot will go there next. Then we are at `(1-j, i+1)`. Then we leave `(1-j, i+2)` dirty? Then the robot will go there? But then we are at `(1-j, i+2)`. Then we use `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nSo the total for this path is: 1 (for `(1-j, i)`) + (1 if `(1-j, i+1)` is dirty) + (1 if `(1-j, i+2)` is dirty) + `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to pre-clean arbitrarily. So we can choose to leave `(1-j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i+2)` dirty? But the grid has fixed ones and zeros. We can only clean dirty cells arbitrarily. So if the grid has `(1-j, i+1)` as 0, we cannot make it dirty. So we have to use the grid values.\n\nTherefore, the alternative path is: \n    count = 1 (for cleaning `(1-j, i)`)\n    plus the dirty cells in the rest of the row `1-j` from `i+1` to `i+2`? Actually, we are forced to clean the next two if they are dirty? But note: the robot will clean them one by one. And we are counting the dirty cells that the robot cleans.\n\nBut the state `dp[i+2][1-j]` already accounts for the dirty cells from column `i+2` to the end. So we don't want to double count.\n\nActually, the code in the if branch does:\n\n    1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j]\n\nThis means: we clean `(1-j, i)` (1) and then we clean `(1-j, i+1)` if it is dirty (G[1-j][i+1]) and `(1-j, i+2)` if it is dirty (G[1-j][i+2]), and then from `(1-j, i+2)` we get `dp[i+2][1-j]` which is the maximum dirty cells the robot cleans from there.\n\nBut wait: the robot cleans `(1-j, i)`, then `(1-j, i+1)` (if dirty), then `(1-j, i+2)` (if dirty), and then the rest from `dp[i+2][1-j]`. So the total is 1 (for `(1-j, i)`) plus the dirty cells at `(1-j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i+2)` (if they are dirty) plus `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nBut note: the state `dp[i+2][1-j]` is defined as the maximum dirty cells the robot cleans starting at `(1-j, i+2)`. However, if we clean `(1-j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i+2)` in the process, then the grid at column `i+1` and `i+2` in row `1-j` must be dirty? Actually, we are using the grid values: `G[1-j][i+1]` and `G[1-j][i+2]` are either 0 or 1.\n\nSo in the else branch, we can do the same? But note: in the else branch, `G[j][i+1]` is 0, so we don't have a tie. So we can do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n\nBut wait, what if we don't have two more columns? For example, if `i = N-2`, then `i+2 = N`, which is beyond the grid? But we have an extra column (we added [0] at the end) and the DP array is of size `N+1`. And we initialized `dp[N-1][j] = G[1-j][N-1]`. For `i = N-2`, we can compute `dp[N-2][j]` and we use `dp[N][1-j]`? But `dp[N][1-j]` is 0 because we didn't initialize beyond `N-1`? Actually, the DP array is of size `N+1` (indexed 0..N). We only initialized for `i = N-1` and then we iterate from `N-2` down to 0. For `i = N-2`, we use `dp[i+2] = dp[N]` which is 0 (because we created `dp` with `[0]*(N+1)`). So that's safe.\n\nBut what if we don't want to take two steps? What if we take one step? That is, after cleaning `(1-j, i)`, we are at `(1-j, i)`. Then we can move to `(1-j, i+1)` (if dirty) and then we are at `(1-j, i+1)`. Then we can use `dp[i+1][1-j]`? But note: from `(1-j, i+1)`, the next dirty cell might be in the same row or in the opposite row. The state `dp[i+1][1-j]` is defined for starting at `(1-j, i+1)`. So we could do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut why does the if branch take two steps? Because in the if branch, we have a dirty cell at `(j, i+1)`. So if we only take one step to `(1-j, i+1)`, then at `(1-j, i+1)` we have a tie? Because the distance to `(j, i+1)` (which is dirty) is 1 and to `(1-j, i+2)` (if dirty) is 1? So we must avoid that tie. Therefore, we must clean `(j, i+1)`? But we are not allowed to make clean cells dirty. And `(j, i+1)` is dirty (because we are in the if branch). So we must pre-clean it? But note: we are already in the process of launching the robot. We pre-cleaned before launch. So we can pre-clean `(j, i+1)`? Then it becomes clean. Then at `(1-j, i+1)`, the next dirty cell is only `(1-j, i+2)` (if dirty) and then we use `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nAlternatively, we can clean `(1-j, i+1)`? Then we leave `(j, i+1)` dirty. Then at `(1-j, i)`, we clean it and then we are at `(1-j, i)`. Then the next dirty cell: `(j, i+1)` is at distance 2? and `(1-j, i+1)` is clean, so the next is `(1-j, i+2)` at distance 2? Then we have a tie? Because `(j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i+2)` are both at distance 2? So we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, in the if branch (when `G[j][i+1]` is 1), we must clean one of the two. The code chooses to clean `(j, i+1)`? Actually, no: the code does not explicitly clean it. Instead, they skip it? They move to `(1-j, i)`, then to `(1-j, i+1)`, then to `(1-j, i+2)`, and then they use `dp[i+2][1-j]`. This implies that they are cleaning `(1-j, i)`, `(1-j, i+1)`, and `(1-j, i+2)` and leaving `(j, i+1)` for later? But then when the robot is at `(1-j, i+2)`, the cell `(j, i+1)` is still dirty? And the distance from `(1-j, i+2)` to `(j, i+1)` is |(1-j)-j| + |(i+2) - (i+1)| = 1+1=2. And the distance to `(1-j, i+3)` is 1? So if `(1-j, i+3)` is dirty, the robot goes there. But then `(j, i+1)` remains dirty? Then eventually the robot will have to come back? But that might cause a tie later.\n\nThis is complex. The intended solution is known: we can use a state machine that considers the possibility of the robot having moved to the other row and then we have to clean a contiguous block in the other row to avoid ties.\n\nActually, known similar problems (like CodeForces 1579F) use a DP that considers two states: \n   state0: the robot is in row0 and we have cleaned the other row in the current column? \n   state1: the robot is in row1 and we have cleaned the other row in the current column?\n\nBut in our code, the provided DP has two states per column.\n\nLooking at known solutions for the problem (if available) or similar problems, but we must complete the code as given.\n\nIn the else branch, we can do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut that would be if we clean `(1-j, i)` and then we are at `(1-j, i)`, and then we use `dp[i+1][1-j]` for the rest. But that ignores the dirty cell at `(1-j, i+1)`? Actually, we are not forced to clean it? The robot will clean it if it is dirty? But the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` already accounts for the grid from `i+1` to the end in row `1-j`. So if `(1-j, i+1)` is dirty, then `dp[i+1][1-j]` will include it? But wait: the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` is defined for starting at `(1-j, i+1)`. However, we are at `(1-j, i)`, not at `(1-j, i+1)`. So we must move to `(1-j, i+1)`? But the distance from `(1-j, i)` to `(1-j, i+1)` is 1, and there is no tie because `(j, i+1)` is clean. So the robot will move to `(1-j, i+1)` and clean it (if dirty) and then we are at `(1-j, i+1)`, and then we use `dp[i+1][1-j]` which includes that cell? But note: the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` is the maximum number of dirty cells the robot cleans from `(1-j, i+1)` to the end. So it does include the cell `(1-j, i+1)`? Actually, no: because the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` is for the robot starting at `(1-j, i+1)`, and the robot hasn't cleaned that cell yet? But the cell `(1-j, i+1)` might be dirty. Then the robot will clean it as the first move from that state? \n\nBut how is `dp[i+1][1-j]` computed? It is computed as:\n\n    dp[i+1][1-j] = G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j]   [if we take the first option]\n\nBut that doesn't include the cell `(1-j, i+1)`.\n\nSo we must include the cell `(1-j, i+1)` explicitly? \n\nTherefore, the else branch should be:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut wait, what if there is a dirty cell at `(1-j, i+1)`? Then we clean it and then use `dp[i+1][1-j]`. But what if there isn't? Then `G[1-j][i+1]` is 0, so we do 1 + 0 + dp[i+1][1-j] = 1 + dp[i+1][1-j]. That means we only cleaned `(1-j, i)` and then moved to `(1-j, i+1)` (which is clean) and then we use the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` which starts at a clean cell? That state should be 0 if there are no dirty cells? But the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` is defined as the maximum number of dirty cells the robot cleans from there, so it will be the number of dirty cells from `i+1` to the end in both rows? But we have pre-cleaned arbitrarily? Actually, the state `dp[i+1][1-j]` is computed under the condition that we have chosen a subset of dirty cells to leave such that the robot cleans them without malfunction.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nBut then why in the if branch they do two steps? Because if we do only one step, then at `(1-j, i+1)` we have a tie with `(j, i+1)` (which is dirty) because both are at distance 1 from `(1-j, i+1)`? So we must clean `(j, i+1)` before the robot gets to `(1-j, i+1)`? But we cannot because we are already in the robot's run. Therefore, we must pre-clean `(j, i+1)`. But then we are not allowed to clean during the run? The problem says: before launching the robot, you can clean some cells. Then the robot cleans the rest. So if we leave `(j, i+1)` dirty, then when the robot is at `(1-j, i+1)`, it will see two closest: `(1-j, i+2)` and `(j, i+1)` (both at distance 1) -> malfunction.\n\nTherefore, we must clean `(j, i+1)` in our pre-cleaning. Then it is clean. Then at `(1-j, i+1)`, the next dirty cell is only `(1-j, i+2)` (if dirty) and then we move there. Then we are at `(1-j, i+2)`, and then we use `dp[i+2][1-j]`.\n\nSo the if branch is:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max( \n        dp[i][j], \n        1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j]\n    )\n\nThis means: we leave `(1-j, i)` dirty (so the robot cleans it) and then we leave `(1-j, i+1)` and `(1-j, i+2)` dirty (if they are in the grid) and then the state from `(1-j, i+2)`. But we must have cleaned `(j, i+1)` in the pre-cleaning? How does that affect the count? The count `dp[i][j]` is the number of dirty cells left for the robot to clean. We are not counting the cells we pre-clean. We are only counting the ones we leave for the robot.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: we want to maximize the number of dirty cells we leave. The robot will clean exactly the dirty cells we leave. So the state `dp[i][j]` is the count of dirty cells that the robot cleans from (i, j) to the end.\n\nIn the if branch, we are forced to pre-clean `(j, i+1)` to avoid a tie. So we do not leave it for the robot. Therefore, the robot does not clean it. So we don't count it.\n\nIn the else branch, we don't have to pre-clean `(j, i+1)` because it is already clean. So we can leave the dirty cells in the other row.\n\nTherefore, the else branch should be:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: the if branch does two columns at once, while the else branch does one column. Why the difference? Because in the if branch, we had to pre-clean `(j, i+1)`, so we skip that cell entirely. Then we are free to move in the other row for two columns.\n\nAlternatively, we could do in the else branch the same two-column jump? But there is no need because there is no tie. So we can do one column at a time.\n\nBut the known solution for this problem (CodeForces 1579F) uses:\n\n    dp[i][0] = a[0][i] + max(dp[i+1][0], a[1][i] + dp[i+1][1])\n    dp[i][1] = a[1][i] + max(dp[i+1][1], a[0][i] + dp[i+1][0])\n\nBut that is for a different state definition.\n\nGiven the complexity, and the provided code structure, I think the intended else branch is:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut let me test with the examples.\n\nExample 1: n=2, grid:\n    row0: '10'\n    row1: '10'\n\nThe robot starts at (0,0) which is clean. The dirty cells are (0,1) and (1,0) and (1,1). We can pre-clean one cell. The answer is 2.\n\nHow would the DP work?\n\nWe have N=2.\nG = [\n    [1, 0, 0],   # row0: '10' -> [1,0] and then we added [0]\n    [1, 0, 0]    # row1: '10' -> [1,0] and then [0]\n]\n\nBut wait, the input is two lines of length n. The first line is the first row, the second line is the second row. The starting cell (1,1) is clean. In 0-indexed, the starting cell is (0,0). The grid is:\n\n    row0: first line: '10' -> [1, 0] -> but the starting cell (0,0) is clean? The problem says the starting cell is clean. So the first character of the first line is '0'? \n\nActually, the first example in the note: \n    \"In the first example, you can clean the cell (1,2), so the path of the robot is (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2).\"\n\nThe grid has 2 columns. The starting cell (1,1) is clean. The grid is:\n\n    row0: '10'? but then (1,1) is the first cell -> row0[0] should be '0'? \n    row1: '10'\n\nBut the input says: the first line is the 1st row, the second line is the 2nd row.\n\nSo for the first example, the input is:\n    n=2\n    first row: '00'  ? -> because (1,1) is clean and (1,2) is dirty? \n    second row: '10'\n\nBut the note says: we clean the cell (1,2) -> which is row0, column1 (0-indexed). Then the robot goes (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). \n\nSo the grid is:\n\n    row0: [ at (1,1): clean, (1,2): dirty ] -> '01'? \n    row1: [ at (2,1): dirty, (2,2): dirty ] -> '11'\n\nBut the input is:\n\n    n=2\n    01\n    11\n\nBut the starting cell (1,1) is clean -> so row0[0] is '0'. \n\nSo G[0][0]=0, G[0][1]=1, G[1][0]=1, G[1][1]=1.\n\nWe added an extra column of 0: so G becomes:\n\n    row0: [0,1,0]\n    row1: [1,1,0]\n\nNow, we initialize:\n    dp[1][0] = G[1][1] = 1   (because 1-0=1, so row1 at index1: G[1][1]=1)\n    dp[1][1] = G[0][1] = 1   (because 1-1=0, so row0 at index1: G[0][1]=1)\n\nThen we go to i=0 (from N-2=0 to 0).\n\nFor j=0 (row0 at column0): \n    Option1: move right in row0: G[0][1] (which is 1) + dp[1][0] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    Then check if G[1][0] is dirty? yes, it is 1.\n        But G[0][1] is 1 -> so we are in the if branch.\n        Then alternative: 1 + G[1][1] + G[1][2] + dp[2][1] = 1 + 1 + 0 + dp[2][1] = 2 + 0 = 2.\n        So dp[0][0] = max(2,2) = 2.\n\nFor j=1 (row1 at column0): \n    Option1: move right in row1: G[1][1] (1) + dp[1][1] (1) = 2.\n    Then check if G[0][0] is dirty? no, it is 0 -> skip.\n\nSo dp[0][0]=2, which is the answer.\n\nNow, what if we use the else branch for j=0? We didn't use it because we were in the if branch.\n\nExample 2: n=2, grid:\n    n=2\n    first row: '00'\n    second row: '11'\n\nBut the note says: we can leave it as is. The robot path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2). So the answer is 2.\n\nThe grid:\n\n    row0: [0,0] -> [0,0,0]\n    row1: [1,1] -> [1,1,0]\n\nInitialize:\n    dp[1][0] = G[1][1] = 1\n    dp[1][1] = G[0][1] = 0\n\nFor j=0 (row0 at column0):\n    Option1: G[0][1] (0) + dp[1][0] (1) = 1.\n    Then check G[1][0] (1) -> yes, and G[0][1] is 0 -> else branch.\n        Then: 1 + G[1][1] (1) + dp[1][1] (0) = 1+1+0 = 2.\n    So dp[0][0] = max(1,2)=2.\n\nFor j=1 (row1 at column0):\n    Option1: G[1][1] (1) + dp[1][1] (0) = 1.\n    Then check G[0][0] (0) -> skip.\n\nSo the answer is 2.\n\nTherefore, the else branch should be:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: in the if branch, we have:\n\n    if G[1-j][i]:   # which is true in the example for j=0 and i=0: G[1][0] is 1.\n    then if G[j][i+1]:  # in the example, G[0][1] is 0 -> so we go to else branch.\n\nSo the else branch is taken.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n\n    dp[i][j] = G[j][i+1] + dp[i+1][j]   # option1\n\nThen in the if branch, when there is a dirty cell in the opposite row and the same column, and if the next in the same row is dirty, we do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n\nAnd in the else branch (when the next in the same row is clean), we do:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: what if `i+1` is beyond the grid? We have added an extra column, so `i+1` is at most `N-1` (because `i` goes from 0 to `N-2`). And we have `dp[i+1][1-j]` defined for `i+1` in [0, N-1] (we initialized for `i=N-1`). So it's safe.\n\n### Program3.py\nThis program is about counting trees (with a specific attachment: vertex i (>=2) is attached to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) for which vertex i is the centroid. The answer modulo 998244353.\n\nThe provided code precomputes factorials and inverse factorials. Then it computes an array `out` for i in [0, (n+1)//2 - 1] (0-indexed). Then it does a backward pass to adjust the array `out`.\n\nThe missing part is the function `modmul` which should do modular multiplication. But note: the function is defined as:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nIt takes three arguments? The third is `c=0`. What is `c`? The name suggests it might be for accumulating? But typically, modular multiplication of two numbers would be:\n\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut what about three numbers? The function is called in several ways:\n\n    modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))   # in comb\n    modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x-y]))       # in invcomb\n    modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])                        # in invs\n    modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))               # in the loop\n    modmul(base, frac)                                   # in the loop\n    modmul(out[i], invs(i))                              # in the backward pass\n\nSo sometimes it is called with two arguments, sometimes with three? But the function has a default `c=0`. So we can do:\n\n    if c == 0:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n    else:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut that would be a ternary function? Actually, the function is called with two arguments in all the above examples. The only call that might use three is not present.\n\nLooking at the code: the function is always called with two arguments? \n\n    modmul(x, y)   -> c=0 by default.\n    modmul(x, y, c) -> then we have three.\n\nBut in the provided code, there is no call with three arguments. So we can simply do:\n\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut wait, in the comb function:\n\n    return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\nThis is nested: the inner modmul has two arguments, the outer has two: fact[x] and the result of the inner modmul.\n\nSo we only need two-argument multiplication.\n\nBut the function signature has `c=0`. We can use:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y % MOD) * c % MOD\n\nBut there is no call with three arguments. So we can ignore c? Or the problem might have intended to multiply up to three numbers? But the backward pass has:\n\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nwhich is two arguments.\n\nSo the safest is to do:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\nBut note: the numbers can be large, so we do modulus at the end? But to avoid overflow in Python, we can do modulus at each step? However, Python integers are big, but we are modding by MOD (998244353). The numbers can be as large as (10^6)! which is huge, but we are doing modulus at the end? But the intermediate multiplication might be too big? Actually, we are doing:\n\n    fact = [1]\n    for i in range(1, MAX):   # MAX = 10**6\n        fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\nHere, we are doing iterative factorial with modulus. But the function `modmul` is used for that. So we must do modulus in `modmul` to keep the numbers within bounds? Otherwise, the factorial of 10^6 is an astronomically large number.\n\nTherefore, we should do:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = (x * y) % MOD\n        if c != 0:\n            res = (res * c) % MOD\n        return res\n\nBut note: the function is called with two arguments: then c=0, so we return (x*y)%MOD.\n\nIf called with three, we do (x*y*c) % MOD.\n\nBut in the code, there is no call with three arguments. So we can also define it for two arguments only? But the signature has c=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    def modmul(*args):\n        res = 1\n        for a in args:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        return res\n\nBut the function is called with two or three? The signature in the code is fixed: it has three parameters. So we must use:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut wait, what if we want to multiply more than three? The code doesn't. So we can do:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = x * y\n        if c:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\nBut note: c might be an integer, but if c=0 then we skip. But 0 is the default.\n\nHowever, the function is only called with two arguments. So we can simply do:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut then if we call with three, it will ignore the third? That would be wrong.\n\nLooking at the code: there is no call with three arguments. So we can do:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        # If c is provided and not zero, multiply all three.\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut to be safe for any number of multiplications, we might use:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\nThis works for two or three arguments.\n\nBut note: the function is called in the backward pass with two arguments: `modmul(out[i], invs(i))` -> then c=0, so we do (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD.\n\nSo the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c != 0:\n        res = res * c\n    return res % MOD\n\nBut we can write it in one line:\n\n    return (x * y * (c if c != 0 else 1)) % MOD\n\nBut that would multiply by 1 when c=0? We want:\n\n    if c==0: (x*y) % MOD\n    else: (x*y*c) % MOD\n\nAlternatively:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c:\n        res *= c\n    return res % MOD\n\nBut note: c might be 0, then we don't multiply. But what if c is provided and is 0? Then we do (x*y*0) % MOD = 0. But that is not the same as (x*y) % MOD. So we must not multiply by c if c==0? But the default is 0, and we want to multiply only two when c=0.\n\nActually, the function is designed to multiply two or three numbers. When c is 0 (the default) we multiply two. When c is nonzero, we multiply three.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n    if c == 0:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n    else:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function might be called with c=0 explicitly? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    return (x * y * c) % MOD if c else (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut that is the same.\n\nGiven the above, we'll write:\n\n    if c:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n    else:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut what if c is 0? Then we return (x*y) % MOD.\n\nBut note: the function is called in the backward pass with two arguments: then c=0, so we return (x*y) % MOD.\n\nIn the factorial loop: modmul(i, fact[i-1]) -> two arguments.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we call with c=0? Then we do (x*y) % MOD. What if we call with c=0 and we want to multiply by 0? Then we should return 0? But if c=0, we are not using it. The function is intended for two or three arguments. When we have two, we set c=0. When we have three, we set c to the third number.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n    if c != 0:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n    else:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut we can write it as:\n\n    return (x * y * c) % MOD if c != 0 else (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut to avoid duplication, we can do:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c != 0:\n        res = res * c\n    return res % MOD\n\nThis is clear.\n\n### Summary\n\nWe have:\n\nprogram1.py: \n    missing code: s = m + 1\n\nprogram2.py: \n    missing code: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nprogram3.py: \n    missing code: \n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\nBut note: the output format is JSON with the keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\". The value for each is a string of the missing code.\n\nWe must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nHowever, the missing code for program1.py is one line, for program2.py is one line, for program3.py is a block of 5 lines? But the function body.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\nSo for program3.py, we output the entire function body? But the function is defined as:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must replace the TODO with the code.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the code that would replace the TODO.\n\nBut note: the function body in program3.py is:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c != 0:\n        res = res * c\n    return res % MOD\n\nBut we must be careful with indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it in a compact way? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven the above, we output:\n\nFor program1: \"s = m + 1\"\nFor program2: \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + dp[i+1][1-j])\"\nFor program3: \n    \"res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\nBut note: the function body must be exactly as it would appear in the program.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire block for program3.\n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\"\n\nSo we output the block as a string with newlines.\n\nNow, we format the JSON.\n\nExample:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"s = m + 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1 - j][i + 1] + dp[i + 1][1 - j])\",\n    \"program3\": \"res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program2, the grid is `G` and the row index is `1-j` (which is the opposite row). We wrote `G[1-j][i+1]`. The original code has `G[1 - j][i + 1]`? Actually, the code has `G[1 - j][i + 1]` in the if branch. So we write it as `G[1-j][i+1]` or `G[1 - j][i + 1]`? The original code has no spaces. But it doesn't matter. We can write without spaces for simplicity.\n\nBut to be safe, we write exactly as we would in the code.\n\nIn the if branch, the code has: `G[1 - j][i + 1]` and `G[1 - j][i + 2]`. So we write with spaces: `G[1 - j][i + 1]`.\n\nBut in the else branch, we write: `G[1 - j][i + 1]`.\n\nSo the string for program2 is: \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1 - j][i + 1] + dp[i + 1][1 - j])\"\n\nBut note: the code in the if branch uses `G[1 - j][i + 1]` and `G[1 - j][i + 2]`. So we use the same style.\n\nFinally, the JSON string must escape quotes? But we are not using quotes inside. So we can write as is.\n\nLet me write the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"s = m + 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1 - j][i + 1] + dp[i + 1][1 - j])\",\n    \"program3\": \"res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut the newlines in program3 must be represented as \\n.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the program3 code in one line? But that would be less readable. The problem does not require one line.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program3 it is a block of multiple lines.\n\nSo we output the string with embedded newlines.\n\nIn JSON, we can write:\n\n    \"program3\": \"res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\nBut the indentation is 4 spaces for the if and return? In the original program, the function body is indented by 4 spaces. The TODO is at the same level. So the code we insert should be indented by 8 spaces? But the function header is already indented. The missing code is the body, so we write the body with the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\nBut the TODO is at the same level as the function header? Actually, the function header is:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n\nand then the next line is:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the body is indented by 4 spaces. Our code should be:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c != 0:\n        res = res * c\n    return res % MOD\n\nBut each line is indented by 4 spaces. So in the string, we write:\n\n    \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\nBut wait, the first line is already at 4 spaces, then the if is at 4 spaces, and the inner is at 8, and the return is at 4.\n\nBut the original code uses 4-space indentation.\n\nSo the exact string for program3 is:\n\n    \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\nBut note: the function header is:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n\nand then we have the body. The body we provide is:\n\n    res = x * y\n    if c != 0:\n        res = res * c\n    return res % MOD\n\nEach line of the body is indented by 4 spaces relative to the function header. So the first line of the body is 4 spaces, the if is 4 spaces, the inner block (the assignment) is 8 spaces, and the return is 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the string should be:\n\n    \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\nBut the original TODO was a comment with 4 spaces. We are replacing that with 4 lines of code, each with 4 spaces of indentation, and the inner with 8.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without worrying about the indentation? But the program must run. So we must have the correct indentation.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to fill in the missing lines. So we assume the existing indentation level. We just output the code as it would appear in the function body.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"s = m + 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1 - j][i + 1] + dp[i + 1][1 - j])\",\n    \"program3\": \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program3 string has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the first line has 4 spaces, the next has 4, then 8, then 4. But in the string, we represent that as:\n\n    Line1: \"    res = x * y\"\n    Line2: \"    if c != 0:\"\n    Line3: \"        res = res * c\"\n    Line4: \"    return res % MOD\"\n\nSo the entire string is:\n\n    \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\nBut we can also write without the initial 4 spaces? Because the function body is already indented. But the TODO was at 4 spaces. We are replacing the TODO line with these 4 lines. So we must have the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, we output the above."
