For each test case:\n- n: number of students\n- a non-decreasing array `s` of shoe sizes. We need to output a permutation `p` of [1, n] (1-indexed) such that:\n1. p_i ! = i (no student gets their own shoes)\n2. The shoe size of the student that the i-th student gets (i.e., the shoe size of the p_i-th student) is at least s_i. 3. If no valid permutation exists, output -1. Note: The array `s` is non-decreasing. ### Approach in the given code: The code uses a while loop that iterates through the shoes. It uses `bisect_left` to find the last occurrence of the current shoe size (by finding the first index where the shoe size is >= s[i]+1 and then subtracting one to get the last index of s[i]). If the last occurrence of the current shoe size is at the same index as the current one (i.e., p == i), then there is only one student with that shoe size? But note: the array is non-decreasing, so if p==i, it means that the current element is the last of its value?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program and what is missing.\n\n## Program1: Shoe Shuffling\n\n### Problem Analysis:\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case:\n- n: number of students\n- a non-decreasing array `s` of shoe sizes.\n\nWe need to output a permutation `p` of [1, n] (1-indexed) such that:\n1. p_i != i (no student gets their own shoes)\n2. The shoe size of the student that the i-th student gets (i.e., the shoe size of the p_i-th student) is at least s_i.\n3. If no valid permutation exists, output -1.\n\nNote: The array `s` is non-decreasing.\n\n### Approach in the given code:\nThe code uses a while loop that iterates through the shoes. It uses `bisect_left` to find the last occurrence of the current shoe size (by finding the first index where the shoe size is >= s[i]+1 and then subtracting one to get the last index of s[i]). \n\nIf the last occurrence of the current shoe size is at the same index as the current one (i.e., p == i), then there is only one student with that shoe size? But note: the array is non-decreasing, so if p==i, it means that the current element is the last of its value? However, if there is only one occurrence of s[i], then we cannot swap because we cannot assign the same shoe to the same student? Actually, the problem says we cannot assign a student their own shoes. But if there is only one student with a particular shoe size, then we cannot assign that student any shoe without giving them their own? Because any other shoe would be either too small (if from a smaller size) or too big? But note: condition 2 requires that the shoe size must be >= s_i. So if we have a student with a unique shoe size, then we must assign them a shoe of the same size? But the same size only exists in their own shoe. However, we cannot assign their own shoe. Therefore, we set perm = [-1] and break.\n\nBut wait: what if there are multiple students with the same shoe size? Then we can form a cycle among them. For example, if we have [1,1,1], then we can assign in a cyclic way: [2,3,1] for example.\n\nSo the idea is:\n- Group consecutive same sizes. For a group of consecutive same sizes, we can form a cycle. However, if the group has size 1, then we cannot form a cycle (because we cannot assign the same shoe to the same student and we cannot assign a different shoe because the shoe must be at least the same size and the same size is the only one available) -> then we output -1.\n\nBut note: the condition also allows assigning a shoe from a larger size. However, the problem says: \"if every student gets shoes of size greater than or equal to their size\". So if we have a group of one, we can assign a larger shoe? But then we break the chain: the student who had the larger shoe must then get a shoe that is at least their size. But if we assign a larger shoe to the student with the unique small size, then the owner of that larger shoe must get a shoe that is at least their size. However, we cannot assign the small shoe to the larger student because the small shoe is less than the larger student's size. Therefore, we must have that every group must be of size at least 2? Actually, we can have a cycle that spans multiple groups? But note: the condition requires that the shoe must be at least the student's size. So we can only assign the same size or a larger size. However, if we assign a larger size to a student, then we must assign that student's shoe to someone else? But that someone else must then get a shoe that is at least their size. This becomes complex.\n\nAlternative approach from known problems: \nWe note that the array is non-decreasing. We can try to form a permutation by swapping within groups of same sizes. But if a group has an odd number of elements? Actually, we can do a cyclic shift: for a group of consecutive same sizes from index L to R (inclusive), we can assign:\n  p[L] = L+1, p[L+1] = L+2, ..., p[R] = L.\nBut note: if the group has size 1, we cannot do that. So we must have at least two in a group.\n\nBut what if we have multiple groups? We can also swap between groups? However, consider: if we assign a student a shoe from a larger size, then the student who originally owned that larger shoe must get a shoe that is at least their own size. The only shoes that are at least the larger size are the same size or even larger. But if we break the group of the larger size by taking one shoe and giving it to a student in a smaller group, then we must assign the larger student a shoe that is at least the larger size. We cannot assign the larger student the small shoe because it is too small. Therefore, we must assign the larger student a shoe from the same group or a larger group. But if we take one shoe from a group of size 1 in the larger group, then that group becomes broken and we have the same problem.\n\nTherefore, the known solution for this problem is:\n  - Group consecutive same sizes.\n  - For each group, if the group has size 1, then output -1 and break.\n  - Otherwise, within the group, we form a cyclic shift: for a group starting at index `start` and ending at index `end` (inclusive), we assign:\n        p[start] = start+1, p[start+1] = start+2, ..., p[end] = start.\n\nBut note: the problem says the array is 0-indexed? The problem uses 1-indexed permutation.\n\nHowever, the given code does not group by consecutive same sizes. Instead, it processes each index `i` and uses:\n    p = bisect_left(shoes, shoes[i]+1)-1   # this gives the last index of the current value.\n\nThen if p == i, then we set perm = [-1] and break.\n\nBut what if we have a group? The code then has a TODO. We need to assign the entire group in a cyclic shift.\n\nSo the plan for the TODO part:\n  We are at index `i`. We know that the current group runs from `i` to `p` (inclusive). We must assign:\n      perm[i] = i+2, ...? Actually, we want a cyclic shift of the group.\n\nBut note: the group might be of size `k = p - i + 1`. We can do:\n   For j from i to p-1: assign the next index (j+1) to the current.\n   For the last one (p): assign the first index (i).\n\nBut we must be cautious: the code is in a while loop. We are at `i` and we process the entire group at once? Then we set `i` to `p+1` to skip the group.\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO part:\n\n  We are at index `i`. We have found that the group of the same size ends at `p` (so from `i` to `p`). We know that if the group has only one element (p==i) then we set perm = [-1] and break. Otherwise, we want to form a cyclic shift for the indices from `i` to `p`.\n\n  Steps:\n      Let k = p - i + 1   (size of the group)\n      We will assign:\n          For j from i to p-1: perm[j] = j+2? Actually, we are building the permutation array for the entire test case. The permutation is 1-indexed. The indices in the array are 0-indexed. The student at position i (0-indexed) should get the shoe of the student at position j (0-indexed) and we output j+1 (because the problem says the p_i-th student, and the students are numbered 1 to n).\n\n      So for the group starting at `i` and ending at `p` (0-indexed indices), we want:\n          For j in [i, p-1]: assign the next student in the group: that is, the student at index j+1 -> so we output j+1+1 = j+2? But note: the permutation array `perm` is 0-indexed? Actually, the problem says: output a permutation of {1,2,...,n}. So we are going to output numbers from 1 to n.\n\n      How we build `perm`? Currently, we are building an array `perm` that we will output.\n\n      We can do:\n          For j from i to p-1:\n              perm.append(j+2)   # because j+1 is the next index, and we want the student number (which is j+1+1? because the student at index j+1 is the (j+1+1)-th student? Actually, the student at index 0 is student 1, at index 1 is student 2, etc.\n\n      But wait: we are at the current index `i`. We are going to assign the entire group at once. Then we break out of the while loop? Actually, the while loop condition is `i < len(shoes) and perm != [-1]`. We are going to process the entire group and then set `i` to the next group.\n\n      However, the code currently does not update `i` beyond the group. We must update `i` to `p+1` after processing the group.\n\n      But the code does not have a for loop inside the while? It uses a while loop and increments `i`? Actually, the current code does not increment `i` in the else branch. So we must update `i` to `p+1` and also build the permutation for the entire group.\n\n      Proposed:\n\n        else:\n            # We are at index i, and we have a group from i to p (both inclusive) of same size.\n            # If the group has size 1, we set perm = [-1] and break. But we already checked that p != i, so group size >=2.\n            # Now, we want to assign a cyclic shift: \n            #   For j from i to p-1: assign the next element (j+1) to the current j -> so the student at j gets the shoe of the student at j+1.\n            #   For the last element (p): assign the first element (i) -> so the student at p gets the shoe of the student at i.\n\n            # How to represent? We are going to extend the `perm` list for the entire group.\n\n            # Currently, `perm` is being built. We are at the start of the group at index i.\n\n            # We will create a list for the group: \n            #   For j in [i, p] (0-indexed indices), we want to assign:\n            #       j -> j+1 (if j is not the last) and the last -> i.\n\n            # But note: the permutation we are building is for the entire array. We are going to output an array of n integers.\n\n            # We can do:\n            #   For j from i to p-1:\n            #       perm.append(j+1+1)   # because the student at index j should get the shoe of the student at index j+1, and the student at index j+1 is represented by the number (j+1+1) (since 0-indexed index to 1-indexed)\n            #   Then for the last one (index p): perm.append(i+1)\n\n            # But then we must update i to p+1.\n\n            # However, the while loop condition is on `i` and we are not updating `i` in the loop. We are using a while loop that increments `i` by one each time? Actually, the code does not increment `i` in the else branch. We must update `i` to skip the entire group.\n\n            # We can do:\n            #   for j in range(i, p):   # from i to p-1\n            #       perm.append(j+2)     # because j+1 (the next index) is j+1, and we add 1 to get the student number: j+1+1 = j+2.\n            #   perm.append(i+1)         # for the last in the group (index p): assign the student at index i, which is student i+1.\n            #   Then set i = p+1.\n\n            # But note: the while loop condition is `i < len(shoes) and perm != [-1]`. We are going to break the loop when i reaches n. We are processing the entire group and then setting i to p+1. Then the next iteration starts at p+1.\n\n            # However, the while loop condition uses `i` and we are not updating `i` in the loop. We must update `i` to p+1 and then continue? But the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. We can update `i` and then the next iteration will start at the new `i`.\n\n            # But the code currently does not update `i` in the else branch.

Then we break.\n\n            # How about:\n\n            #   for j in range(i, p):\n            #       perm.append(j+2)\n            #   perm.append(i+1)\n            #   i = p   # then the next step will do i+1? Actually, we are not in a for loop. We are in a while loop and we are going to break the group and then the next iteration must start at p+1. But the while loop condition is checked at the beginning. We set i = p+1 and then break out of the current group processing? Actually, we are in the while loop and we are going to do the next iteration.\n\n            # But the code does not have a mechanism to update `i` and then continue. We are using a while loop and we are updating `i` to p+1 and then the next iteration will start at p+1.\n\n            # However, the current code does not update `i` at all.
