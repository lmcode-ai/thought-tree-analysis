So we check if that element is an icon? That's what the code does: \n                if g[tot] == '*': inner += 1\n\n            Therefore, the complete addition part is:\n                g[p] = '*'\n                if g[tot] == '*': inner += 1   # because the element at the old total index (which is now the last element of the new inner) is included? But note: the element at g[tot] might have been there from before? And we are about to set tot = tot+1, so that element becomes part of the inner? So we add one if it is an icon. if p <= tot: inner += 1   # because the new icon is at p, and if p is in the new inner (which is [0, tot] because the new total is tot+1) then we add one. But note: if p is exactly tot, then we haven't accounted for it? Actually, the condition p<=tot includes p==tot. And the element at tot we just handled separately? Actually, no: the element at tot is a different element. The new icon is at p. So if p==tot, then we are adding an icon at the position that is the last of the new inner? Then we have to count it. But note: the element at tot (the old total) is a separate element. So we do both. However, consider: if p == tot, then we are setting g[p] to '*' and then we check g[tot] (which is the same as g[p]) and we just set it to '*', so the condition g[tot]=='*' is true. Then we add one for that. Then we also check p<=tot (which is true) and add one again. That would be double counting? Because we are adding one for the same element twice.\n\n            How to fix? Note: the element at tot (the old total) is the element at index tot. The new icon is at p. They are the same only if p==tot. So we have two cases: Case 1: p != tot: then we add one for the element at tot (if it's an icon) and one for the new icon at p (if p<=tot) -> no double counting. Case 2: p == tot: then we set g[p] to '*' (so g[tot] becomes '*') and then we check g[tot] and add one. Then we check p<=tot (which is true) and add one again. But we are adding two for the same element? That is wrong. Therefore, we must avoid double counting. How did the removal avoid? In removal, if we remove an icon at p and if p==tot_old? Then we did: if g[tot]=='*': inner -= 1   # but note: we just removed the icon at p, and if p==tot_old, then we set g[p]='.' and then we check g[tot] (which is the same as g[p]) and it's '.' so we don't subtract? Actually, in removal:\n                    g[p] = '.'   -> so if p==tot, then after setting to '.', we check g[tot] and it's '.' -> so we don't subtract for that condition. Then we check if p<tot? -> p==tot? then false -> so we only subtract one (the one we removed) and that's it. But in addition, we set g[p]='*' and then check g[tot]. If p==tot, then we are checking the same cell we just set. So we see the '*' and add one. Then we check p<=tot (which is true) and add one again. That's two for the same cell. How about: we should check the element at tot (the old total) only if that element is not the one we just set? Actually, we set g[p]='*' and then we check g[tot]. If p==tot, then we are checking the same cell. So we don't need to add for the condition p<=tot when p==tot?",

Similarly, we are adding one for the new icon if it is in the old inner. Therefore, the missing line is: inner += 1\n\n            However, note: the code in the else branch is already written as: if p<tot:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            So we just need to put the statement: inner += 1\n\n            But note: the indentation. The if block must contain that.

Actually, we have: a = a.split() -> so a is a list of strings? and we are counting frequencies? but the problem says integers? Actually, the input says: the second line contains n integers. But the code reads as string and splits. Then we use Counter(a).values() -> but the integers are represented as strings? That is acceptable? Because the same integer string will be counted together. Then: \n                    m = max(Counter(a).values())\n                    r = 0\n                    while m < n: d = min(m, n - m)\n                        r += 1 + d\n                        m += d\n\n                Then print(r)\n\n            But note: the example: \n                First test case: all equal -> m = n -> skip the loop -> output 0 -> correct. Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> frequencies: \n                    0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1 -> m=2. Then: d = min(2,6-2)=min(2,4)=2 -> r=0+1+2=3, then m=2+2=4. Then: d = min(4,2)=2 -> r=3+1+2=6, then m=6 -> break. -> output 6. Therefore, the missing code in the while loop is:\n\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + d\n                m += d\n\n            However, note: the code currently has:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO:",

So we need to put the three lines with 4 more spaces? so 8 in total? But the existing code has the while line at 4 spaces. Then the body should be 8? Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n But note: the print(r) is at 4 spaces? so it is after the while? not in the while. Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? But the problem requires the code to run. Since the problem says the code must run, we must match the indentation. We'll assume 4 spaces per indent. The for body is 4 spaces. The while is at 4 spaces. The while body must be 8 spaces. Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n    {\n        \"program1\": \"    inner += 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\",\n        \"program3\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n    }\n\n But note: in program1, the existing code for the else branch has:\n\n        else:\n            g[p]='*'\n            #\"tide rise\"\n            if g[tot]=='*':inner+=1\n            if p<tot: # TODO: Your code here\n            tot+=1\n\n We are to put the body of the if: one line with 4 spaces? The existing code uses 4 spaces per indent? So the if block should be indented 4 more? The current if is at 12 spaces?",

Then the body of the if should be 16? But the problem does not specify. However, the existing code for the removal branch:\n\n        if g[p]=='*':\n            tot-=1\n            #\"tide fall\"\n            if g[tot]=='*':inner-=1\n            if p<tot:inner-=1\n            g[p]='.' So the body of the inner if is at the same level as the previous if? We can do the same: if p<tot: inner += 1\n\n on the same line? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the if. We can output:\n\n        \"inner += 1\"\n\n and then the existing code will be: if p<tot: inner += 1\n\n But the existing code has the if and then the TODO comment? We are replacing the TODO comment with \" inner += 1\"? Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        \" inner += 1\"\n\n to be appended to the if line? But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The block for the if is one line? We'll output: \"    inner += 1\" (with 4 spaces) to be the next line? But then the if block becomes:\n\n            if p<tot:\n                inner += 1\n\n which is 4 more spaces? so 16? How about we output: \"inner += 1\" (without spaces) and then the user will insert it at the correct indentation? But the problem says: we must output the exact code that goes in the TODO. Since the TODO is at the end of the if line, we can output the entire line? Actually, the problem says: \"fill in\" the missing lines or blocks. We are to fill the TODO. The TODO is at the end of the if line. We can output the body as a separate line? We choose to output the body as a separate line with 4 more spaces? Therefore, for program1: \"    inner += 1\" (with 4 spaces) -> but the existing if line is already at 12 spaces? Then the body should be 16? We output 4 spaces? meaning we are adding 4 spaces? Alternatively, we output 8 spaces? But note: the existing code for the removal branch has:\n\n            if p<tot:inner-=1\n\n which is on the same line. So we can do the same? We can output: \" inner += 1\" (with a space at the beginning) to be appended to the if line? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the expression? We decide: for program1, we output: \" inner += 1\" (with a space at the beginning) to be placed after the colon? Then the line becomes:\n\n            if p<tot: inner += 1\n\n This matches the style of the removal branch. Therefore, we output for program1: \" inner += 1\"\n\n Similarly, for program2: we output: \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\" -> but note: the existing code for the other branches has a space after the colon? Actually, the code for division4: \" Division 4\" -> so we output the same. But the problem says: the output format: \"Division X\".",

But the while loop is at 4 spaces. The body should be 8. So we output:\n\n        \" d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n which is 8 spaces at the beginning of each line. However, note: the first line of the body is at 8 spaces, then the next two also at 8? But the existing code for the for loop body is:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            while m<n):\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + d\n                m += d But the while line is already written? So we only output the body? which is three lines, each starting with 8 spaces? Therefore, we output the three lines with 8 spaces? But note: the 8 spaces are relative to the beginning of the line? The for loop body is at 4 spaces. The while body should be 8? So we output:\n\n        \" d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n (each line has 8 spaces: two indents of 4) But the total string will have 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Alternatively, we can output without the spaces? and let the user insert the indentation? But the problem requires the exact code. We'll output with the 8 spaces. However, note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are outputting a string with newlines and spaces. This is acceptable. Let's write the JSON. Important: escape the quotes in program2. We write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\"\n\n But note: the backslash to escape the quotes. Alternatively, we can use single quotes? But the problem uses double quotes for the JSON. We must escape the double quotes inside the string. Therefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \" inner += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\",\n    \"program3\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n}\n\n But note: the program3 part has newlines? and the JSON standard allows that with \\n. However, we are writing a string in JSON, so we use \\n. Alternatively, we can write the program3 part as a single line with \\n? Yes. We output the above JSON.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The code is already partially written. We are to complete the missing part in the else branch (when adding an icon).\n The idea is to maintain:\n   - `g`: a flattened list of the desktop in column-major order (because we are using chain.from_iterable(zip(*g0)) which transposes and then flattens).\n   - `tot`: the total number of icons.\n   - `inner`: the number of icons that are in the first `tot` positions (which is the \"good\" region for the current total).\n\n When we remove an icon at position p:\n   - We decrement `tot`.\n   - If the icon at position `tot` (which is now just beyond the new total) was an icon, then that icon is no longer in the inner region? Actually, note that the inner region is defined as the first `tot` (after removal) positions. But note: when we remove an icon, we have two effects:\n        a) The icon at p is removed. If p was in the inner region (p < tot_old, which is tot before decrement), then we remove one from inner.\n        b) The icon that was at position tot_old (if any) is now at position tot_old-1? Actually, we are not shifting the array. Instead, we are just changing the total. The inner region becomes the first `tot` (which is tot_old-1) positions.\n\n   However, note the code does:\n        if g[tot]=='*': inner -= 1   # because after removal, the element at position `tot` (which was the last element of the inner region when there were tot_old icons) is now outside the inner region? Actually, the inner region is the first `tot` (which is now tot_old-1) positions. So the element at position tot_old-1 becomes the last of the inner? But wait: we are using 0-indexed. The inner region is indices [0, tot-1]. The element at index `tot` (which is the old total) is now beyond the inner region. So if that element was an icon, then it was not counted in the inner? Actually, before removal, the inner region was [0, tot_old-1] and we counted the icons in that region. After removal, the inner region becomes [0, tot_old-2]. The element at tot_old-1 (which is the last element of the old inner) is now the last of the new inner? But note: we are decrementing tot, so the inner region becomes [0, tot_old-2]. The element at tot_old-1 is now outside. So if that element was an icon, then we must subtract one from inner? Actually, the inner count was for the old inner region (which included tot_old-1). Now we are removing one icon at p and also the inner region shrinks by one at the end. So we subtract one from inner for the removal at p (if p was in the inner) and also if the element at the old last (which is now beyond) was an icon, then we subtract one because that icon is no longer in the inner.\n\n   Similarly, when adding an icon:\n        We set g[p] = '*'\n        Then we check: if the current total (which is the old total) has an icon at position `tot` (which is the last of the old inner region) then when we expand the inner region by one (because tot becomes tot_old+1) that icon at position `tot` will now be included? So we add one to inner.\n        Also, if the new icon is placed in the inner region (p < tot_old) then we add one to inner? But note: the inner region for the old total was [0, tot_old-1]. Now we are adding an icon at p. Then we are going to set tot = tot_old+1. The new inner region will be [0, tot_old]. So the new icon might be in the old inner region (if p < tot_old) and then we add one. But note: if p is exactly tot_old? Then it's not in the old inner but will be in the new inner? Actually, the condition in the code for removal was: if p < tot (the old total) then we subtract. Similarly, for addition, we should check if p < tot (the old total) because the inner region for the old total was [0, tot_old-1]. However, note that after adding, the inner region becomes [0, tot_old] (because tot becomes tot_old+1). So the new icon at p might be in the new inner region? Actually, the condition in the code for removal also checked p<tot (the old total) for the removal. So for addition, we should check if p < tot (the old total) OR if p == tot? Actually, the inner region after the addition will include positions [0, tot_old] (which is tot_old+1 elements). The old inner was [0, tot_old-1]. The new inner includes the old inner and the element at tot_old. So:\n          - The new icon at p: if p is in [0, tot_old] then it will be in the new inner. But note: the old inner was [0, tot_old-1]. So if p is in [0, tot_old-1] then we are adding an icon that is in the old inner? Actually, no: because we haven't updated tot yet. The inner count we are going to use for the new state is the old inner plus:\n                - The new icon if it is in the old inner? But wait, we are going to update tot to tot_old+1. Then the inner count for the new state is the count of '*' in the first tot_old+1 positions.\n\n        However, the code does:\n            g[p] = '*'\n            if g[tot] == '*': inner += 1   # because the element at position tot (which is the last element of the new inner region? Actually, the new inner region will be [0, tot_old] and tot_old is the current tot (before increment) and then we increment tot. So the element at position tot_old (which is the old tot) is now included? But note: the inner count we are maintaining is for the first tot_old (old total) positions? Actually, we are about to update tot to tot_old+1. So the inner count for the new state should be the old inner plus:\n                - The new icon at p: if p is in [0, tot_old] (which it is, because p is at most n*m-1, but tot_old might be less than n*m? Actually, tot_old can be up to n*m) then we have to account for it? But note: we are going to add one to tot, so the inner region becomes [0, tot_old]. The old inner was the count of '*' in [0, tot_old-1]. Now we are adding one icon at p. Also, the element at tot_old (if it was an icon) is now included? So we do:\n            if g[tot] == '*': inner += 1   # because the element at position tot_old (which is now the last element of the new inner) was not in the old inner? But note: the old inner was [0, tot_old-1]. So if the element at tot_old was an icon, then it wasn't counted in the old inner. Now it is in the new inner? So we add one.\n\n            Then, if p < tot_old: then the new icon is placed in the old inner? But wait, the old inner was [0, tot_old-1]. So if p < tot_old, then we are adding an icon that is in the old inner? Actually, no: because the old inner count did not include this new icon. So we have to add one for the new icon if it is in the new inner? But note: the new inner is [0, tot_old]. The new icon is at p. We have two cases:\n                Case 1: p < tot_old -> then the new icon is in the old inner? Actually, the old inner was [0, tot_old-1] and tot_old-1 >= p? Not necessarily: if tot_old is 0 then p must be 0? But note: if tot_old is 0, then the inner region is empty. Then we are adding an icon at p=0? Then we have to count it? Actually, the condition p < tot_old: if tot_old is 0, then p<0 is false. So we don't add. But then we update tot to 1. The inner region becomes [0,0] (if the array has at least one element). The new icon is at 0, so it is included. But we haven't added one for it? How do we account for it?\n\n            Actually, the code for removal did:\n                if p < tot: inner -= 1   # because the icon we removed was in the inner region (the old inner region, which was [0, tot_old-1] and tot_old was the old total). Similarly, for addition, we should check if the new icon is in the new inner region? But note: the new inner region is [0, tot_old] (because we are going to set tot = tot_old+1). The new icon is at p. We are about to set tot to tot_old+1. So the condition for the new icon to be in the new inner is p <= tot_old? Actually, the new inner region has indices from 0 to tot_old (inclusive). So we can do:\n                if p <= tot_old: then we add one to inner? But note: the code for removal used p < tot (the old total) because the inner region for the old total was [0, tot_old-1]. Now for addition, we are going to have a new total of tot_old+1, so the inner region will be [0, tot_old]. Therefore, the condition for the new icon to be in the new inner is p <= tot_old? But note: the variable `tot` at this point is the old total. So we can write:\n                if p < tot:   # because the old total is tot, and the new inner region will be [0, tot] (which has tot+1 elements). The condition p < tot means p is in [0, tot-1] which is the old inner? But we want to know if it is in the new inner? Actually, the new inner is [0, tot] (because tot becomes tot+1). So the new inner includes the old inner and the element at index tot. Therefore, the new icon at p is in the new inner if and only if p <= tot? But note: the old total is stored in `tot` at the moment. So we can do:\n                if p <= tot: inner += 1\n\n            However, the removal code used:\n                if p < tot: inner -= 1   # because the inner region for the old state was [0, tot_old-1] (and tot_old was the old total). So if p was in [0, tot_old-1] then we subtract.\n\n            For addition, the inner region for the new state is [0, tot_old] (which is the old total). So the new icon is in the new inner if p <= tot_old? But note: the old total is stored in `tot` at the time of the condition. So we can write:\n                if p <= tot: inner += 1\n\n            But wait: the removal code also had an adjustment for the element at the old last (which was at index tot_old) because when we remove, the inner region shrinks and that element falls out. Similarly, when we add, we are going to expand the inner region to include the element at index tot_old? So we check if that element is an icon? That's what the code does: \n                if g[tot] == '*': inner += 1\n\n            Therefore, the complete addition part is:\n                g[p] = '*'\n                if g[tot] == '*': inner += 1   # because the element at the old total index (which is now the last element of the new inner) is included? But note: the element at g[tot] might have been there from before? And we are about to set tot = tot+1, so that element becomes part of the inner? So we add one if it is an icon.\n                if p <= tot: inner += 1   # because the new icon is at p, and if p is in the new inner (which is [0, tot] because the new total is tot+1) then we add one. But note: if p is exactly tot, then we haven't accounted for it? Actually, the condition p<=tot includes p==tot. And the element at tot we just handled separately? Actually, no: the element at tot is a different element. The new icon is at p. So if p==tot, then we are adding an icon at the position that is the last of the new inner? Then we have to count it. But note: the element at tot (the old total) is a separate element. So we do both.\n\n            However, consider: if p == tot, then we are setting g[p] to '*' and then we check g[tot] (which is the same as g[p]) and we just set it to '*', so the condition g[tot]=='*' is true. Then we add one for that. Then we also check p<=tot (which is true) and add one again. That would be double counting? Because we are adding one for the same element twice.\n\n            How to fix? Note: the element at tot (the old total) is the element at index tot. The new icon is at p. They are the same only if p==tot. So we have two cases:\n                Case 1: p != tot: then we add one for the element at tot (if it's an icon) and one for the new icon at p (if p<=tot) -> no double counting.\n                Case 2: p == tot: then we set g[p] to '*' (so g[tot] becomes '*') and then we check g[tot] and add one. Then we check p<=tot (which is true) and add one again. But we are adding two for the same element? That is wrong.\n\n            Therefore, we must avoid double counting. How did the removal avoid? In removal, if we remove an icon at p and if p==tot_old? Then we did:\n                if g[tot]=='*': inner -= 1   # but note: we just removed the icon at p, and if p==tot_old, then we set g[p]='.' and then we check g[tot] (which is the same as g[p]) and it's '.' so we don't subtract? Actually, in removal:\n                    g[p] = '.'   -> so if p==tot, then after setting to '.', we check g[tot] and it's '.' -> so we don't subtract for that condition.\n                    Then we check if p<tot? -> p==tot? then false -> so we only subtract one (the one we removed) and that's it.\n\n            But in addition, we set g[p]='*' and then check g[tot]. If p==tot, then we are checking the same cell we just set. So we see the '*' and add one. Then we check p<=tot (which is true) and add one again. That's two for the same cell.\n\n            How about: we should check the element at tot (the old total) only if that element is not the one we just set? Actually, we set g[p]='*' and then we check g[tot]. If p==tot, then we are checking the same cell. So we don't need to add for the condition p<=tot when p==tot? Because we already added one for the element at tot? But note: the element at tot is now included in the inner? And we added one for that. The new icon is the same as that element? Then we have accounted for it. So we don't need to add again.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break the addition into:\n                We are going to add an icon at p. Then the new inner region (after tot becomes tot+1) will be the old inner region plus the element at the old total (if it wasn't already included) and the new icon (if it is in the new inner and not the same as the old total element).\n\n            Actually, the inner count for the new state is the count of '*' in the first tot_old+1 positions. The old inner was the count in the first tot_old positions. So the new inner = old inner + (1 if the element at tot_old is '*' else 0) + (1 if the new icon is at a position that is beyond the old inner? Actually, no: the new icon might be anywhere. But note: the new icon is at p. The old inner was [0, tot_old-1]. The new inner is [0, tot_old]. So the new inner = old inner + (1 if the element at tot_old is '*' else 0) and then we have to account for the new icon? But wait: the new icon might be in the old inner? Then we have already counted it in the old inner? Actually, no: because we are adding it now. The old inner did not have it.\n\n            Therefore, the new inner count = old inner + (1 if the element at tot_old is '*' then 1 else 0) + (1 if the new icon is not at tot_old? because if it is at tot_old, then we are setting that element to '*' and then we count it as the element at tot_old? But note: if the new icon is at tot_old, then we set g[tot_old] to '*' and then we count it in the condition for the element at tot_old. And if the new icon is at a position in the old inner, then we have to add one? But the old inner did not have that icon.\n\n            Actually, the new inner count is the old inner count plus:\n                - The new icon at p: if p is in [0, tot_old] (which is the new inner) then we have to add one? But note: the element at tot_old is also in the new inner. So if p is tot_old, then we are adding one for the new icon and then we also add one for the element at tot_old? which is the same? So we are adding two for the same element.\n\n            How about: we do not need to add for the element at tot_old if the new icon is placed at tot_old? Because we are setting it to '*' and then we check g[tot_old] and it is '*' -> so we add one. But that one is for the new icon? Then we don't need to add again for the new icon at tot_old? But if the new icon is placed at a position that is not tot_old, then we have to add one for the new icon? and also if the element at tot_old is '*' we add one? But note: the element at tot_old might have been there from before? So we have to add it regardless.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n                inner = old_inner + (1 if the element at tot_old is '*' else 0) + (1 if the new icon is in the old inner? i.e., p < tot_old? because if p==tot_old, then we already accounted for it in the element at tot_old? and if p>tot_old, then it's not in the new inner? Actually, the new inner is [0, tot_old]. So if p>tot_old, then the new icon is not in the new inner? So we don't add for it.\n\n            So:\n                if p < tot_old: then we add one for the new icon (because it is in the old inner? but the old inner didn't have it) -> so we add one.\n                if p == tot_old: then we set the element at tot_old to '*' and then we check that element and add one (so we get one for the new icon at tot_old).\n                if p > tot_old: then the new icon is not in the new inner? so we don't add for it? But wait: the new inner is [0, tot_old]. So if p>tot_old, then the new icon is beyond the new inner? Then we don't add.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n                inner += 1   # for the element at tot_old? but wait: we are going to check g[tot_old] and if it's '*' we add one? But note: the element at tot_old might have been '*' already? Then we are adding one for that? But that element was not in the old inner? So we have to add it. And then we add one for the new icon only if it is in the old inner? Actually, no: the new icon might be at tot_old? Then we set it to '*' and then we add one for the element at tot_old? which is the new icon. And if the new icon is in the old inner (p<tot_old) then we add one? But that would be two for the same if p==tot_old? No, because if p==tot_old, then we don't do the p<tot_old branch.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n                inner += (1 if g[tot] == '*' else 0)   # for the element at the old total (which is now included in the new inner)\n                if p < tot:   # meaning p is in the old inner? Then we add one for the new icon? because the old inner didn't have it? But note: the old inner was [0, tot_old-1]. The new inner is [0, tot_old]. The new icon at p (if p<tot_old) is in the old inner? Actually, the old inner was [0, tot_old-1] and tot_old-1 < tot_old. So if p<tot_old, then p is in the old inner? But the old inner count did not include this new icon? So we add one.\n\n            But what if p==tot_old? Then we don't add for the new icon in the condition p<tot? But we did add for the element at tot_old? which is the new icon? So that's one.\n\n            And if p>tot_old? Then we don't add for the new icon? because it's not in the new inner? So that's correct.\n\n            Therefore, the code for addition should be:\n                g[p] = '*'\n                # Check the element at the old total (index tot) becomes included? So if it is an icon, add one.\n                if g[tot] == '*': \n                    inner += 1\n                # Then, if the new icon is placed in the old inner (p < tot) then we add one? But note: the new icon is placed at p. The old inner was [0, tot_old-1] (which is [0, tot-1] because tot is the old total). So if p < tot, then we add one.\n                if p < tot:\n                    inner += 1\n                tot += 1\n\n            However, note: what if the element at tot_old was already an icon? Then we add one for that. And if the new icon is at a position in the old inner, we add one for that. But what if the new icon is placed at a position that is beyond the old inner but not at tot_old? Then we don't add? But the new inner includes the old inner and the element at tot_old. The new icon at p (if p>tot_old) is not included? So we don't add? That's correct.\n\n            But what if the new icon is placed at tot_old? Then we set g[tot_old] to '*' (so it becomes an icon) and then we check g[tot] (which is tot_old) and it is '*' -> so we add one. And we skip the p<tot? because p==tot_old and tot_old==tot? so p==tot -> condition p<tot is false. So we add one? which is correct.\n\n            And if the new icon is placed at a position in the old inner? Then we add one for the element at tot_old (if it was an icon) and one for the new icon? so two? But note: the element at tot_old might be an icon that was already there? and the new icon is an additional one? So two is correct.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n                if p < tot: inner += 1\n\n            And then we do tot += 1.\n\n            But note: the code in the else branch currently has:\n                g[p]='*'\n                if g[tot]=='*':inner+=1\n                if p<tot:   # then we do inner += 1\n                tot+=1\n\n            So we just need to fill the if block for p<tot.\n\n            We write: inner += 1\n\n            So the code for the else branch becomes:\n                else:\n                    g[p] = '*'\n                    if g[tot]=='*': inner += 1\n                    if p < tot:\n                        inner += 1\n                    tot += 1\n\n            But note: the code in the removal branch had a condition for p<tot (the old total) and subtracted one. Similarly, we are adding one for the new icon if it is in the old inner.\n\n            Therefore, the missing line is: inner += 1\n\n            However, note: the code in the else branch is already written as:\n                if p<tot:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            So we just need to put the statement: inner += 1\n\n            But note: the indentation. The if block must contain that.\n\n            So: \n                if p < tot:\n                    inner += 1\n\n For program2.py:\n   We are to complete the condition for the division 3 and also note that the condition for division 4 is already done, division 2 and 1 are also done. The missing part is for the rating in [1400,1599] which is division 3.\n\n   The code currently has:\n        if c<=1399:\n            print(\" Division 4\")\n        elif 1400<=c<=1599:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n            print(\" Division 2\") \n        else:\n            print(\" Division 1\")\n\n   We need to output \"Division 3\" for the ratings in [1400,1599].\n\n   So we write: print(\" Division 3\")\n\n   But note: the output format: the example outputs have a space at the beginning? Actually, the example outputs in the note are without space? But the code for division4 has a space: \" Division 4\". So we follow the same.\n\n   Therefore: print(\" Division 3\")\n\n For program3.py:\n   The problem: We are given an array. We can do two operations: clone an array (operation 1) and swap two elements from any two arrays (operation 2). We want the minimal number of operations to get one copy where all elements are equal.\n\n   The note gives an example: \n        [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> they do 6 operations? But the answer for the example is 6? However, the problem says \"output the minimal number of operations\".\n\n   How to solve?\n        We note that we start with one copy. We can clone it arbitrarily. Then we can swap arbitrarily. The goal is to have one copy that has all elements equal.\n\n        Let the target value in the final copy be x. Then we need to gather k copies of x (where k is the length of the array) in one copy. \n\n        How do we get x? It must be one of the numbers that appears in the array? \n\n        The operations: \n          Operation 1: clone an existing array. This adds one more array. (cost 1)\n          Operation 2: swap two elements from two arrays (or same). (cost 1)\n\n        We can think: we can use the swaps to gather all the x's from different copies into one copy. \n\n        How many operations? \n          Let the frequency of x be f. Then we need k - f additional x's. \n          How do we get them? We can take them from other copies? But note: we can create copies arbitrarily. \n\n        The idea: \n          We can create a copy of the array. Then we can swap an element that is not x in the target copy with an x in a non-target copy? \n\n        Actually, we can use a greedy: \n          Step 1: We start with one copy. \n          Step 2: We can create a clone (operation 1). Then we have two copies. \n          Step 3: We can swap an element from the first copy that is not x with an element from the second copy that is x? Then the first copy gains one x and the second copy loses one x.\n\n        But note: we can do multiple swaps and multiple clones.\n\n        Alternate approach from known solutions to similar problems (like Codeforces Round #767 (Div. 2) problem C): \n          The minimal operations is: \n            Let m = max frequency of any element. \n            Then we start with the original array. \n            We can do:\n                operations = 0\n                while m < n:\n                    operations += 1   # for cloning the current best array (which has the most of the target element)\n                    # Then we can swap: we can take one element of the target from the clone and swap it with a non-target in the target array? \n                    # Actually, after cloning, we have two arrays. Then we can swap one element from the first (which is the one we want to fix) with one element from the second? Specifically, we can swap a non-target in the first with a target in the second? Then the first array gains one target. \n                    # How many swaps? Actually, we can do as many swaps as we want? But note: we are counting operations. Each swap is one operation.\n\n                    # However, note: we can do multiple swaps in one clone? But the problem: we are allowed to do one swap per operation. \n\n            But the known solution for this problem is:\n                Let m = max frequency.\n                ans = 0\n                while m < n:\n                    ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n                    # Then we can swap: we can take min(m, n-m) from the clone? \n                    # Actually, after cloning, we have two arrays. Then we can swap up to m elements (because the clone has m copies of the target) to the original? But the original has n-m non-targets? So we can swap min(m, n-m) times? \n                    # Then the original becomes: m + min(m, n-m) = m + m (if m<=n-m) or m + (n-m) = n (if m>n-m) -> but wait, if m>n-m, then we can swap n-m times and then the original becomes m + (n-m) = n? \n                    # Actually, we are swapping non-targets from the original with targets from the clone. Each swap gives the original one more target. So after k swaps, the original has m + k targets. \n                    # We want to get to n? So we need n-m swaps? \n\n                    # But note: we can do multiple swaps? and each swap is one operation. So after the clone, we can do k swaps? Then the total operations for this step is 1 (for clone) + k (for swaps) = k+1.\n\n                    # However, the problem says: we can do one operation: either clone or swap. So we can do one swap per operation? Then we cannot do k swaps in one step? \n\n            Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    cnt = {}\n                    for x in a:\n                        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x,0)+1\n                    m = max(cnt.values())\n                    res = 0\n                    while m < n:\n                        res += 1  # for the clone operation\n                        # Then we can use the clone to swap: we can swap up to m elements? \n                        # Actually, after cloning, we have two arrays. Then we can swap m elements? (because the clone has m of the target) and then the original gains m more targets? \n                        # But note: we can only swap one element per operation? So we would need m operations? \n                        # However, the problem does not require to do all swaps in one step? We are allowed to do one operation at a time.\n\n                    But the known solution is:\n\n                        res = 0\n                        while m < n:\n                            d = min(m, n - m)\n                            res += 1   # for the clone\n                            res += d   # for the swaps? \n                            m += d\n\n                    Then output res.\n\n            Why? \n                Step: \n                  We clone: cost 1.\n                  Then we can swap d = min(m, n-m) elements: each swap moves one target from the clone to the original? Then the original gains d targets? So m becomes m+d.\n                  Then we do res += 1 + d.\n\n            Example: \n                n=6, m=2 (max frequency is 2). \n                Step1: \n                    d = min(2,4)=2 -> operations += 1+2 = 3, then m becomes 4.\n                Step2: \n                    d = min(4,2)=2 -> operations += 1+2 = 3, then m becomes 6 -> done.\n                Total operations = 6.\n\n            Why is d = min(m, n-m)? \n                Because we can only swap as many as the number of targets we have in the clone (which is m) and we only need n-m more? So we take the minimum.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program3.py:\n\n                We have: \n                    n=len(a)   (but note: the array a is given as a string? Actually, we have: a = a.split() -> so a is a list of strings? and we are counting frequencies? but the problem says integers? Actually, the input says: the second line contains n integers. But the code reads as string and splits. Then we use Counter(a).values() -> but the integers are represented as strings? That is acceptable? Because the same integer string will be counted together.\n\n                Then: \n                    m = max(Counter(a).values())\n                    r = 0\n                    while m < n:\n                        d = min(m, n - m)\n                        r += 1 + d\n                        m += d\n\n                Then print(r)\n\n            But note: the example: \n                First test case: all equal -> m = n -> skip the loop -> output 0 -> correct.\n                Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> frequencies: \n                    0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1 -> m=2.\n                    Then: \n                        d = min(2,6-2)=min(2,4)=2 -> r=0+1+2=3, then m=2+2=4.\n                        Then: d = min(4,2)=2 -> r=3+1+2=6, then m=6 -> break. -> output 6.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code in the while loop is:\n\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + d\n                m += d\n\n            However, note: the code currently has:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We need to put the three lines.\n\n            But note: the variable `m` is being updated and `n` is fixed.\n\n            So:\n\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + d\n                m += d\n\n            But note: the problem says the total of n over test cases <= 10^5, so the while loop runs at most O(log n) per test case? and the total n is bounded by 10^5? So it's efficient.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + d\n                m += d\n\n However, note: the code in program3.py has:\n\n        from collections import*\n        for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n        We are to fill the while loop body.\n\n        We write:\n\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            r += 1 + d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the variable `n` is the length of the array? and `m` is the max frequency.\n\n        However, note: the line `n=len(a:=a.split())` sets n to the number of elements in the array? which is the same as the original n? But the input n is the length of the array? So that's correct.\n\n        But wait: the input for a test case is:\n            first line: n\n            second line: n integers\n\n        The code: \n            [*open(0)]: reads all lines.\n            [2::2]: starting from index 2 (the third line) and then every two lines? \n            Actually, the first line is t, then the next lines are test cases: \n                test case 1: line0: n, line1: the array\n                test case 2: line2: n, line3: the array\n                ...\n\n            So [2::2] gives the lines: index2, index4, ... which are the array lines? \n\n            Then for each array line, we split and set a to the list of tokens? and n = len(a) -> which is the n from the input? \n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            r += 1 + d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we update m until m>=n.\n\n        We must be cautious: the body of the while loop must be indented.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            while m < n:\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + d\n                m += d\n\n        However, the code already has the while loop and the TODO is inside. So we just put the three lines.\n\n Now, we output the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\n Format: \n    {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\", \"program3\": \"completion\"}\n\n For program1: the completion is the line: \"    inner += 1\" (without quotes) but note the context: it is inside an if block. So we output the exact line that goes in the TODO.\n\n But note: the existing code in program1 for the else branch:\n\n    else:\n        g[p]='*'\n        #\"tide rise\"\n        if g[tot]=='*':inner+=1\n        if p<tot:# TODO: Your code here\n        tot+=1\n\n We are to replace the TODO line with:\n\n        if p<tot:\n            inner += 1\n\n But the code already has the \"if p<tot:\" line? So we just need to put the body: \"inner += 1\" (with the same indentation as the if).\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the line that goes in the TODO: the inner block.\n\n But note: the TODO is at the same line as the if. So we cannot output the if again? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill the TODO. The TODO is at the line:\n\n        if p<tot:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are to replace that entire line? or just the part after? The problem says: \"fill in\" the missing lines or blocks.\n\n Since the TODO is in a comment, we can leave the condition and then put the body. But the body must be indented.\n\n How about we output:\n\n        inner += 1\n\n But that would be one line? and then the next line is the tot+=1? \n\n However, the current code after the TODO has the tot+=1 at the same indentation as the if? That is, the if block is empty? Then we must put at least one line in the if block.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        if p<tot: inner += 1\n\n But the original code has the condition and then a comment. We can write the body on the same line? But that is not the style. The problem does not specify.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly\". We can output:\n\n        inner += 1\n\n as the missing block? and then the existing code has the next line (tot+=1) at the same level as the if? So the if block is one line: inner+=1.\n\n Therefore, for program1, we output: \"    inner += 1\" (with the same indentation as the surrounding code). But the surrounding code uses 4 spaces? The existing code uses 4 spaces.\n\n Alternatively, we can output the exact line that should replace the TODO line? \n\n The TODO line is: \n        if p<tot:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We can replace it with:\n        if p<tot:\n            inner += 1\n\n But then the next line (tot+=1) is at the same level as the if? So we have:\n\n        if p<tot:\n            inner += 1\n        tot += 1\n\n How do we output two lines? \n\n The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we can output multiple lines.\n\n But note: the existing code has the line \"if p<tot: ...\" and then the next line is \"tot+=1\". We cannot remove the \"if p<tot:\". \n\n Actually, the TODO is only the body? \n\n The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the if. So we output:\n\n        inner += 1\n\n as one line? \n\n However, the code after the TODO is:\n\n        tot += 1\n\n which is not part of the if block. So we must not change that.\n\n Therefore, we output for program1: \"    inner += 1\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning) to be the body of the if.\n\n Similarly, for program2: we output: \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\" (with the same indentation as the other print statements).\n\n For program3: we output three lines:\n\n        d = min(m, n - m)\n        r += 1 + d\n        m += d\n\n But note: the while loop body must be indented. The existing code has:\n\n        while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are to replace the TODO with the three lines? But the TODO is at the end of the while line? \n\n We can output:\n\n        d = min(m, n - m)\n        r += 1 + d\n        m += d\n\n with the same indentation as the while loop body? (which is 4 spaces more than the while)\n\n Alternatively, we can output the entire while loop body? \n\n The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we output the three lines.\n\n But note: the while loop condition is already written. We are only to fill the body.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n        d = min(m, n - m)\n        r += 1 + d\n        m += d\n\n with the same indentation level as the next line? Actually, the next line is the print? which is not in the loop. So we must not include the print.\n\n We output the three lines as the body of the while.\n\n Now, we write the JSON.\n\n Example:\n\n    {\n        \"program1\": \"    inner += 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\",\n        \"program3\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n    }\n\n But note: the program3 part has three lines. We use \\n to separate.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n Alternatively, we can output the three lines as a single string with embedded newlines.\n\n But the JSON standard allows that.\n\n Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        \"program3\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n But note: the indentation: we use 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code in program3 has:\n\n        while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n The body should be indented one level more. The existing code uses 4 spaces per level? So the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n However, the code we are given for program3:\n\n        from collections import*\n        for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n The while loop body is missing. We are to put the body with the same indentation as the for loop body? which is 4 spaces. But the while loop is already in a for loop that has 4 spaces. Then the while body should be 8 spaces? \n\n But the code we are to output: the three lines should be indented 8 spaces? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation? But we must match the existing style.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the code that goes in the TODO. The TODO is at the end of the while line. We are to write the body of the while. The body should be indented.\n\n How about we output:\n\n        \"program3\": \"    d = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += 1 + d\\n    m += d\"\n\n with 4 spaces? because the while loop is already at 4 spaces? and the body should be 8? Actually, the for loop body is indented 4, and the while loop is inside the for loop? So the while body should be 8? \n\n But the code we are given: the while loop is written as:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n and then the next line is:\n\n            print(r)\n\n which is at the same level as the while? So the while body is empty? Then we must put the body with 8 spaces? \n\n Therefore, we output for program3:\n\n        \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n (with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line) -> but that is 8 spaces? \n\n Alternatively, we can use one tab? but the problem uses spaces.\n\n Since the existing code uses 4 spaces per level, and the while is at level 1 (4 spaces) then the body should be level 2 (8 spaces). \n\n But note: the for loop body has:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split()); ... \n\n which is one line? and then the while is at the same level? and then the print is at the same level as the while? \n\n Actually, the for loop body is:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n So the while and the print are at the same level (4 spaces). The while body must be 8 spaces.\n\n Therefore, we output the three lines each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? as long as it is indented? But to be safe, we match the style of the existing code.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the while. The body should be indented relative to the while. The existing code uses 4 spaces per indent? So we use 4 more spaces? \n\n Therefore, for program3, we output:\n\n        \"    d = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += 1 + d\\n    m += d\"\n\n with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? because the while is already at 4 spaces? and the body should be 4 more? so 8? \n\n But wait: the while line is:\n\n            while m<n: ...\n\n and we are to put the body? The body should be:\n\n            [8 spaces]d = min(m, n - m)\n\n But the existing code has the for loop body at 4 spaces. The while is at 4 spaces (same as the for body). Then the while body should be 8.\n\n So we output 8 spaces? \n\n However, the problem does not specify. But to be safe, we output 4 spaces per indent? and the while body is one indent more than the while? so 4 more? total 8? \n\n But the example output we are to write in the JSON must be a string. We can write:\n\n        \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n (each line has 8 spaces: 8 spaces = two indents of 4)\n\n Alternatively, we can use a single indent of 4? because the while is already in a block? \n\n But the while is at the same level as the for body? and the for body is one block? Then the while body should be one more indent? 4 spaces.\n\n Actually, the code we are given for program3:\n\n        for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n The while body is missing. We are to put the body of the while. The while is at the same level as the for body? Then the while body should be indented one more level? 4 spaces? \n\n But the for body has multiple statements? The first two are on the same line? Then the while and then the print. The while body must be indented relative to the while? \n\n In Python, the body of a while must be indented. So we need to put the three lines with 4 more spaces? so 8 in total? \n\n But the existing code has the while line at 4 spaces. Then the body should be 8? \n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n But note: the print(r) is at 4 spaces? so it is after the while? not in the while.\n\n Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? But the problem requires the code to run.\n\n Since the problem says the code must run, we must match the indentation.\n\n We'll assume 4 spaces per indent. The for body is 4 spaces. The while is at 4 spaces. The while body must be 8 spaces.\n\n Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n    {\n        \"program1\": \"    inner += 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\",\n        \"program3\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n    }\n\n But note: in program1, the existing code for the else branch has:\n\n        else:\n            g[p]='*'\n            #\"tide rise\"\n            if g[tot]=='*':inner+=1\n            if p<tot:# TODO: Your code here\n            tot+=1\n\n We are to put the body of the if: one line with 4 spaces? The existing code uses 4 spaces per indent? So the if block should be indented 4 more? \n\n The current if is at 12 spaces? (because the else is at 8, then the if is at 12). Then the body of the if should be 16? \n\n But the problem does not specify. However, the existing code for the removal branch:\n\n        if g[p]=='*':\n            tot-=1\n            #\"tide fall\"\n            if g[tot]=='*':inner-=1\n            if p<tot:inner-=1\n            g[p]='.'\n\n So the body of the inner if is at the same level as the previous if? \n\n We can do the same: \n\n        if p<tot: inner += 1\n\n on the same line? \n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the if. We can output:\n\n        \"inner += 1\"\n\n and then the existing code will be:\n\n            if p<tot: inner += 1\n\n But the existing code has the if and then the TODO comment? We are replacing the TODO comment with \" inner += 1\"? \n\n Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        \" inner += 1\"\n\n to be appended to the if line? \n\n But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The block for the if is one line? \n\n We'll output: \"    inner += 1\" (with 4 spaces) to be the next line? \n\n But then the if block becomes:\n\n            if p<tot:\n                inner += 1\n\n which is 4 more spaces? so 16? \n\n How about we output: \"inner += 1\" (without spaces) and then the user will insert it at the correct indentation? \n\n But the problem says: we must output the exact code that goes in the TODO.\n\n Since the TODO is at the end of the if line, we can output the entire line? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"fill in\" the missing lines or blocks. We are to fill the TODO. The TODO is at the end of the if line. We can output the body as a separate line? \n\n We choose to output the body as a separate line with 4 more spaces? \n\n Therefore, for program1: \"    inner += 1\" (with 4 spaces) -> but the existing if line is already at 12 spaces? Then the body should be 16? \n\n We output 4 spaces? meaning we are adding 4 spaces? \n\n Alternatively, we output 8 spaces? \n\n But note: the existing code for the removal branch has:\n\n            if p<tot:inner-=1\n\n which is on the same line. So we can do the same? \n\n We can output: \" inner += 1\" (with a space at the beginning) to be appended to the if line? \n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the expression? \n\n We decide: for program1, we output: \" inner += 1\" (with a space at the beginning) to be placed after the colon? \n\n Then the line becomes:\n\n            if p<tot: inner += 1\n\n This matches the style of the removal branch.\n\n Therefore, we output for program1: \" inner += 1\"\n\n Similarly, for program2: we output: \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\" -> but note: the existing code for the other branches has a space after the colon? Actually, the code for division4: \" Division 4\" -> so we output the same.\n\n But the problem says: the output format: \"Division X\". The example outputs in the note do not have a space? But the code for division4 has a space: \" Division 4\". So we output the same.\n\n Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n    {\n        \"program1\": \" inner += 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\",\n        \"program3\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n    }\n\n But wait: in program3, the three lines must be indented 8 spaces? We output 8 spaces? \n\n Actually, we output 8 spaces per line? meaning each line starts with 8 spaces? \n\n But the while loop is at 4 spaces. The body should be 8. So we output:\n\n        \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n which is 8 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n However, note: the first line of the body is at 8 spaces, then the next two also at 8? \n\n But the existing code for the for loop body is:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            while m<n):\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + d\n                m += d\n\n But the while line is already written? So we only output the body? which is three lines, each starting with 8 spaces? \n\n Therefore, we output the three lines with 8 spaces? \n\n But note: the 8 spaces are relative to the beginning of the line? The for loop body is at 4 spaces. The while body should be 8? \n\n So we output:\n\n        \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n\n (each line has 8 spaces: two indents of 4)\n\n But the total string will have 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n Alternatively, we can output without the spaces? and let the user insert the indentation? But the problem requires the exact code.\n\n We'll output with the 8 spaces.\n\n However, note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are outputting a string with newlines and spaces.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n Let's write the JSON.\n\n Important: escape the quotes in program2.\n\n We write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\"\n\n But note: the backslash to escape the quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes? But the problem uses double quotes for the JSON.\n\n We must escape the double quotes inside the string.\n\n Therefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \" inner += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\",\n    \"program3\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + d\\n        m += d\"\n}\n\n But note: the program3 part has newlines? and the JSON standard allows that with \\n.\n\n However, we are writing a string in JSON, so we use \\n.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the program3 part as a single line with \\n? \n\n Yes.\n\n We output the above JSON."
