But how?\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. The correct approach for the second test case:\n\nTest case: n=3, m=1. The pair is (1,2). a values are [4,5,3]. We need the number of cakes to be even. Since m=1 is odd, the total must be even \u2192 0 cakes. So we need to have zero pairs where both friends are invited. So either:\n\n- Neither 1 nor 2 is invited. Then, the unhappiness is a_1 + a_2 =4+5=9. But also, we can invite 3. The unhappiness would be 4+5=9 if 3 is invited, or 9+3=12 if not. Alternatively, exclude 1 or exclude 2. Excluding 1: a_1=4. But then, since 1 is excluded, the pair (1,2) is not counted. So the cakes are zero. So it's valid. The unhappiness is 4. Excluding 2: a_2=5. Cakes zero. Unhappiness 5. Excluding both 1 and 2: a_1 +a_2=9. Cakes zero. Unhappiness 9. But there's another possibility: exclude someone else, like 3. But excluding 3 would not affect the pair (1,2). So if 1 and 2 are invited, the number of cakes is 1 (invalid). So we need to exclude either 1 or 2. So the minimal is 4, which is achieved by excluding 1. So the code's approach would output 4. But according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 2. This indicates that there's a mistake in the sample explanation. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the sample explanation says that the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. Let's see:\n\nInviting 2 and 3:\n\n- 1 is not invited \u2192 a_1=4.\n\n- 2 and 3 are invited. The pair (1,2) is not both invited. So the cakes are zero. So the total is 4. But the sample says it's 2. This suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the sample explanation's a array is different. Perhaps the a array is [4,3,5]. Then, inviting 2 and 3 gives a_1=4, which is the sum. But sample says 2. Alternatively, perhaps the sample explanation's a array is [2,5,3]. Then, inviting 2 and 3 would give a_1=2.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum unhappiness value for a party where the number of cakes (friend pairs both invited) is even. If the original number of friend pairs m is even, then the answer is 0, because we can invite everyone. But when m is odd, we need to make it even by possibly excluding some pairs. So the problem reduces to cases where m is odd.\n\nWait, the current code checks if m is even and outputs 0. That's correct because then all pairs can be invited (so all people are invited, no unhappiness). But when m is odd, we need to adjust.\n\nThe main idea here is that when m is odd, the total number of cakes must be even. So the original m is odd, so we need to reduce the number of cakes by an odd number to make it even. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to have an even number of pairs left. But how?\n\nHmm. The initial approach for the case when m is odd is to find the minimal way to have the number of cakes (friend pairs included) being even. Since m is odd, we need to remove an odd number of pairs. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of cakes is the number of friend pairs where both are invited. So initially, if we invite everyone, the number of cakes is m. So if m is even, that's okay. If m is odd, we need to have the total cakes even. So we can either:\n\n1. Remove an odd number of pairs (so that the remaining is even) by not inviting at least one person from each of those pairs. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the minimal cost to turn the total number of cakes into even. For that, maybe we can remove exactly one pair (so m-1 is even), but that's not possible because when you remove a pair (by not inviting at least one of them), you might remove more pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution involves considering two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\na) Exclude exactly one pair (so the total cakes is m minus 1, which is even if m was odd). But how? Because if we exclude both people from a pair, that only affects that one pair. But if we exclude one person from a pair, then all pairs that include that person are also excluded. So it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost would be to find the pair (x,y) where the sum of the a_i for excluding x or excluding y is minimized. Wait, perhaps the approach is to find for each friend pair (x,y), the minimal cost of either not including x (so a[x] plus the cost of any other pairs involving x being excluded), but perhaps that's not feasible. Wait, but if we exclude x, then all pairs that x is part of are excluded. Similarly for y. So removing x would remove q[x] pairs, and removing y would remove q[y] pairs. But maybe there's a way to find the minimal a[x] + a[y], or min(a[x], a[y]).\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the total number of cakes is even. So when m is odd, we need the total cakes to be even. So the number of pairs that are included must be even. So the original m is odd; perhaps the way to achieve even is to reduce the number of cakes by an odd amount. That can be done by removing an odd number of pairs. But how to remove those pairs.\n\nBut each pair is removed if either x or y is not invited. So the minimal way to remove an odd number of pairs is perhaps to find a single pair (x,y) where excluding x and/or y leads to an even total. Wait, but perhaps the minimal cost is to find a pair (x,y) such that either excluding x (which removes all pairs involving x) or excluding y (removes all pairs involving y), and see which gives an even total. But if m is odd, then the initial count is odd. If we remove an even number of pairs, the total becomes odd (which is invalid). So we need to remove an odd number of pairs. So perhaps the way is to find a pair (x,y) where the number of pairs removed is odd. Then the total would be m - (number of pairs removed), which is even.\n\nBut how to calculate the number of pairs removed when you exclude x or y. Excluding x removes q[x] pairs, excluding y removes q[y] pairs. So the possible options are:\n\n1. Exclude x, which removes q[x] pairs. So if q[x] is odd, then m - q[x] is even (since m is odd). So then the total cakes would be even. But the cost here is a[x]. But maybe there are other pairs removed as well, but the key is that the total is even.\n\nAlternatively, exclude x and y. Then the number of pairs removed would be q[x] + q[y] - 1 (since the pair (x,y) is counted in both q[x] and q[y]). But that's complicated.\n\nWait, let's think again. The original m is odd. We need the remaining number of pairs (after some exclusions) to be even. So the number of pairs removed must be odd.\n\nEach pair is removed if either x or y is not invited. So when we choose not to invite some people, the number of pairs removed is the number of pairs where at least one of x or y is excluded.\n\nThe problem is to choose a subset of people to invite such that the number of pairs where both are invited is even. The minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited.\n\nSo the approach for the case where m is odd is to find the minimal possible sum of a_i where the number of pairs (x,y) both invited is even.\n\nHmm. So how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative idea: the minimal sum can be found by considering two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\n- We have an even number of pairs. So we can either:\n\n   a) Find a way to have the total pairs even by excluding certain people. The minimal cost would be the sum of a_i for those excluded.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the initial state where all are invited (sum 0, but m is odd, so invalid). We need to adjust this to make the number of pairs even, paying the minimal cost.\n\nWe can consider two scenarios:\n\n1. Remove exactly one pair (so the total becomes m-1, even). How to do that? By excluding one of the two friends in that pair. But wait, if we exclude x from a pair (x,y), then all pairs that include x are also excluded. So excluding x would remove q[x] pairs. Similarly for y.\n\nBut if q[x] is even, then removing x would remove an even number of pairs. Since m is odd, removing even gives m - even = odd, which is invalid. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if q[x] is odd, then removing x would remove an odd number of pairs. So m - odd = even, which is valid. So in this case, the cost is a[x]. Similarly, if y's q[y] is odd, then removing y would cost a[y], and the total pairs becomes even.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal a[x] where x has an odd number of pairs (i.e., q[x] is odd). But wait, maybe there's a pair (x,y) where q[x] + q[y] is even. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, find pairs (x,y) where either x has an odd q[x] or y has an odd q[y], then the minimal between a[x] and a[y]. Or maybe find a pair where x and y have a sum of their degrees (q[x] + q[y]) that is even? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is that when you remove a pair (x,y) by excluding both x and y. The number of pairs removed would be the sum of pairs that include x or y (including the pair (x,y) itself). But this is equivalent to q[x] + q[y] - 1 (since (x,y) is counted in both q[x] and q[y]). So if (q[x] + q[y] -1) is odd, then the total pairs removed is odd, which would make the remaining even.\n\nBut then the cost would be a[x] + a[y]. So we need to find the minimal a[x] + a[y] for pairs where (q[x] + q[y] -1) is odd.\n\nWait, but q[x] and q[y] are the degrees of x and y in the friendship graph, i.e., the number of friends each has.\n\nHmm. So for each pair (x,y), the possible options are:\n\nOption 1: Exclude x. Then the number of pairs removed is q[x]. If q[x] is odd, then the total pairs after removal is m - q[x], which is even. The cost is a[x].\n\nOption 2: Exclude y. Similarly, if q[y] is odd, cost is a[y].\n\nOption 3: Exclude both. Then the number of pairs removed is (q[x] + q[y] - 1). If (q[x] + q[y] -1) is odd, then total pairs is even. Cost is a[x] + a[y].\n\nSo for each pair (x,y), we can consider these three options and take the minimal possible cost that results in an even number of pairs. Then the overall minimal cost among all possible pairs and their options would be the answer.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n- For each pair (x,y) in the list of m pairs:\n\n   - Check if q[x] is odd. If so, then excluding x gives a valid even total (since m was odd, subtract q[x] (which is odd) gives even). The cost is a[x].\n\n   - Similarly, check if q[y] is odd. Cost is a[y].\n\n   - Check if (q[x] + q[y] -1) is odd. Then, (m - (q[x] + q[y] -1)) is even. Cost is a[x] + a[y].\n\n   - Take the minimal among these valid options for this pair.\n\nThen, the answer is the minimal of all such options across all pairs.\n\nBut perhaps there are other possibilities where excluding other pairs would lead to a lower cost. But since the problem requires the minimal total unhappiness, the best option would be to find the minimal among all possible valid options for all pairs.\n\nSo the code would loop through all pairs, compute the minimal cost for each pair, and take the overall minimal.\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: if there exists a member x where q[x] is even, then excluding x would remove an even number of pairs, which would make the total pairs m - even, which is odd (since m is odd). So that's invalid. So only considering x with odd q[x] can lead to valid solutions.\n\nSo for each pair (x,y), we can:\n\n- Check if q[x] is odd. Then, excluding x would cost a[x], and the total pairs removed is q[x], which is odd. So the total pairs would be m - q[x], which is even. So that's valid. So the cost for this option is a[x].\n\n- Similarly, check if q[y] is odd. Cost a[y].\n\n- Also, check if (q[x] + q[y]) is even. Because then (q[x] + q[y] -1) is odd. So excluding both x and y would remove an odd number of pairs. Then the total pairs is m - (q[x] + q[y] -1) = (m - (q[x] + q[y] -1)). Since m is odd, and (q[x] + q[y] -1) is odd, their difference is even. So this is valid. So the cost here is a[x] + a[y].\n\nWait, but (q[x] + q[y] -1) must be odd. So (q[x] + q[y] -1) mod 2 = 1. So (q[x] + q[y}) mod 2 is 0. So q[x] and q[y] must have the same parity.\n\nSo for option 3, the sum of q[x] and q[y] must be even. So, for each pair (x,y), if q[x] and q[y] are both even or both odd, then option 3 is possible.\n\nSo, for each pair (x,y), we can compute the three possible options (if applicable) and take the minimal.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nSo in the code, for the case when m is odd, the code loops through all pairs, and for each pair:\n\nCompute the possible candidates:\n\n- If q[x] is odd, then a[x] is a candidate.\n\n- If q[y] is odd, then a[y] is a candidate.\n\n- If q[x] + q[y] is even, then a[x] + a[y] is a candidate.\n\nThen, among these three possibilities (if they are valid), take the minimal for this pair, and track the overall minimal across all pairs.\n\nBut wait, the third option (excluding both) is only valid if the sum of their degrees is even. So, for example, if q[x] is even and q[y] is even, then sum is even. If both are odd, sum is even. So in those cases, the third option is valid.\n\nSo for each pair, the possible options are:\n\nOption 1: x is excluded (if q[x] is odd) \u2192 cost a[x]\n\nOption 2: y is excluded (if q[y] is odd) \u2192 cost a[y]\n\nOption 3: both are excluded (if sum is even) \u2192 cost a[x] + a[y]\n\nThen, among these options, the minimal for the pair is considered.\n\nWe take the minimal among all these candidates across all pairs.\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: what if there's a single member x where q[x] is odd and a[x] is minimal. But that's already considered in the options above, as the pair (x,y) where x has a friend, and we take a[x] as a candidate.\n\nWait, but if x has multiple friends, but in the loop through all pairs, each pair involving x would check if q[x] is odd and take a[x] as a candidate. So for all pairs that x is part of, option 1 (exclude x) will be considered. So the minimal a[x] will be considered across all those pairs. So the overall minimal a[x] (where x has odd degree) will be captured.\n\nSimilarly for option 2.\n\nSo, the code can proceed by, for each pair, considering the three options (if applicable), and track the minimal possible cost.\n\nTherefore, in the code, when m is odd, we need to loop through all pairs (i from 1 to m), and for each pair (x,y), compute the possible candidates and update the ans accordingly.\n\nSo in the code's else block (when m is odd), the loop over i from 1 to m:\n\nFor each pair b[i], x = b[i].x, y = b[i].y.\n\nCompute possible candidates:\n\n- if q[x] is odd, candidate is a[x]\n\n- if q[y] is odd, candidate is a[y]\n\n- if (q[x] + q[y]) % 2 == 0, candidate is a[x] + a[y]\n\nThen, for each candidate (if valid), compare to the current ans and take the minimal.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   if m is even:\n\n      output 0\n\n   else:\n\n      compute ans by iterating over all pairs and considering the three options.\n\nSo in the code, the missing part is the loop over i=1 to m, and for each pair, compute the possible candidates.\n\nSo the code's current structure is:\n\nif (m%2 ==0) output 0\n\nelse:\n\n   loop over the pairs:\n\n      ... compute and update ans ...\n\n   output ans.\n\nThe missing code is inside the for(int i=1; i<=m; i++) loop.\n\nSo, for each pair, we get x and y.\n\nThen, check if q[x] is odd. Then, consider a[x] as a candidate. Similarly for q[y].\n\nCheck if (q[x] + q[y]) is even. Then, consider a[x] + a[y].\n\nTake the minimal of the valid candidates for this pair, and compare to the global ans (which is initially INT_MAX).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint x = b[i].x;\n\nint y = b[i].y;\n\nint current_min = INT_MAX;\n\nif (q[x] %2 ==1) {\n\n   current_min = min(current_min, a[x]);\n\n}\n\nif (q[y] %2 ==1) {\n\n   current_min = min(current_min, a[y]);\n\n}\n\nif ((q[x] + q[y]) %2 ==0) {\n\n   current_min = min(current_min, a[x] + a[y]);\n\n}\n\nif (current_min != INT_MAX) {\n\n   ans = min(ans, current_min);\n\n}\n\nWait, but what if none of the options are valid for a pair? Then current_min remains INT_MAX. So we don't consider that pair.\n\nBut since m is odd, there must be at least some way to make the total even. Because the problem says \"it is possible\".\n\nSo for example, when m is odd, then the sum of all degrees is even (since each edge contributes 2 to the sum). So the number of nodes with odd degrees must be even. So perhaps there are some pairs (x,y) where q[x] and q[y] are both odd. Then, excluding both gives (q[x] + q[y] -1) pairs removed, which is even (since 2k+1 + 2m+1 -1 = 2k + 2m +1 \u2192 which is odd). Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nq[x] is the degree of x, which is the number of edges connected to x.\n\nEach edge contributes to two nodes, so the sum of all degrees is even. So the number of nodes with odd degrees is even.\n\nSo in the graph, the number of nodes with odd degrees is even.\n\nSo when m is odd, and the code is in the else clause, there must be some pairs (x,y) where x and y have degrees that allow some of the options.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows: for each pair, check the possible candidates, and accumulate the minimal.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nx = b[i].x;\n\ny = b[i].y;\n\nint temp = 1e9; // a large number\n\nif (q[x] % 2) {\n\n   temp = min(temp, a[x]);\n\n}\n\nif (q[y] % 2) {\n\n   temp = min(temp, a[y]);\n\n}\n\nif ((q[x] + q[y]) % 2 == 0) {\n\n   temp = min(temp, a[x] + a[y]);\n\n}\n\nif (temp < ans) {\n\n   ans = temp;\n\n}\n\nBut wait, how can we ensure that at least one of the options is valid for some pair?\n\nSince the sum of degrees is even, and m is odd, there must be at least two nodes with odd degrees. So in that case, for a pair (x,y) where both x and y have odd degrees, then options 1 and 2 (exclude x or y) would be valid (since their degrees are odd). So the code would find a[x] or a[y] as candidates.\n\nAlternatively, if x and y have even degrees, then their sum is even, so option 3 is valid.\n\nSo there must be some pair where at least one option is valid.\n\nSo in the code, the ans will be updated from the initial INT_MAX to some valid value.\n\nSo the code for the loop would be:\n\nfor each pair i from 1 to m:\n\n   x = b[i].x, y = b[i].y\n\n   current_min = INF\n\n   if q[x] is odd \u2192 a[x] is a candidate\n\n   if q[y] is odd \u2192 a[y] is a candidate\n\n   if sum is even \u2192 a[x]+a[y] is a candidate\n\n   ans = min(ans, current_min)\n\nSo the code inside the loop would look like:\n\nans = min(ans, min(a[x], a[y], a[x]+a[y])) but considering the conditions.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=m; i++) {\n\n    int x = b[i].x;\n\n    int y = b[i].y;\n\n    int temp = 1e9; // or something like a large value\n\n    if (q[x] %2) {\n\n        temp = min(temp, a[x]);\n\n    }\n\n    if (q[y] %2) {\n\n        temp = min(temp, a[y]);\n\n    }\n\n    if ((q[x] + q[y]) %2 ==0) {\n\n        temp = min(temp, a[x] + a[y]);\n\n    }\n\n    if (temp < ans) {\n\n        ans = temp;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo this is the code that needs to be filled in.\n\nNow, considering that in the code, q[x] and q[y] are the degrees of x and y. Because in the code, after reading each pair (x,y), they increment q[x] and q[y].\n\nYes, in the code:\n\nfor(int i=1;i<=m;i++){\n\n    cin>>b[i].x>>b[i].y;\n\n    q[b[i].x]++, q[b[i].y]++;\n\n}\n\nSo q[x] is the number of friends of x.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is the loop over each pair, compute the possible minimal cost for that pair, and update the answer.\n\nSo the code to be filled in is:\n\nfor(int i=1;i<=m;i++){\n\n    int x = b[i].x;\n\n    int y = b[i].y;\n\n    int cur = 1e9;\n\n    if(q[x]%2) cur = min(cur, a[x]);\n\n    if(q[y]%2) cur = min(cur, a[y]);\n\n    if((q[x]+q[y])%2 ==0) cur = min(cur, a[x]+a[y]);\n\n    ans = min(ans, cur);\n\n}\n\nBut in C++, 1e9 can be represented as 1000000000, but since a[i] can be up to 1e4, and m up to 1e5, 1e9 is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, initializing cur as INT_MAX.\n\nBut since a[x] and a[y] are up to 1e4, adding them gives up to 2e4. So initializing cur as a very high value is okay.\n\nSo the code inside the for loop is:\n\nint x = b[i].x, y = b[i].y;\n\nint current = INT_MAX;\n\nif (q[x] % 2) current = a[x];\n\nif (q[y] % 2) current = min(current, a[y]);\n\nif ((q[x] + q[y]) % 2 ==0) current = min(current, a[x] + a[y]);\n\nans = min(ans, current);\n\nBut wait, when initializing current as INT_MAX, then for example, if none of the options are possible (but according to the problem's note, there must be a solution), but in code, how is that handled?\n\nBut according to the problem's note, there's a valid solution for each test case, so in the code, for some pair, at least one option will be valid.\n\nBut according to the code's current structure, if none of the conditions are met, current remains INT_MAX. But ans is initialized to INT_MAX, and then in each iteration, it's compared with current. If for all pairs, current remains INT_MAX, then ans remains INT_MAX, which would be wrong. But according to the problem statement, there is a solution.\n\nBut given that the code is correct, perhaps the conditions are such that at least one of the options will be valid.\n\nBut according to the graph's properties, since m is odd and sum of degrees is even, the number of nodes with odd degrees is even. So there are even number of nodes with odd degrees.\n\nSo for the case when m is odd:\n\nIf there exists a node x with odd degree, then there must be another node y with odd degree. So in their pair (x,y) (if they are friends), then options 1 and 2 would be possible. But if x and y are not friends, then perhaps there's another pair.\n\nBut since the code loops through all pairs, and in some pair, there must be a case where either x or y has odd degree, or the sum is even.\n\nBut perhaps the code should handle all possibilities.\n\nBut in any case, the code as written here is the correct approach based on the problem's analysis.\n\nSo the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nint x = b[i].x, y = b[i].y;\n\nint cur = 1e9;\n\nif (q[x] %2) cur = a[x];\n\nif (q[y] %2) cur = min(cur, a[y]);\n\nif ((q[x] + q[y]) % 2 == 0) cur = min(cur, a[x] + a[y]);\n\nans = min(ans, cur);\n\nAlternatively, written in C++ code:\n\nfor(int i=1;i<=m;i++){\n    int x = b[i].x;\n    int y = b[i].y;\n    int cur = 1e9;\n    if(q[x]%2) cur = a[x];\n    if(q[y]%2) cur = min(cur, a[y]);\n    if((q[x]+q[y])%2 ==0) cur = min(cur, a[x] + a[y]);\n    ans = min(ans, cur);\n}\n\nBut in C++, 1e9 can be written as 1000000000. Alternatively, we can use INT_MAX. But since a[i] is up to 1e4, adding two gives 2e4. So initializing cur to a higher value like 1e9 is safe.\n\nBut perhaps using INT_MAX could cause overflow, but in this case, it's just a comparison.\n\nAlternatively, the code could initialize cur as a very large value and then check if any of the conditions are met.\n\nBut the code as written should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1\n\n3 1\n\n4 5 3\n\n1 2\n\nm is 1 (odd).\n\nq[1] =1, q[2]=1, q[3] =0.\n\nThe pair is (1,2).\n\nFor this pair:\n\nq[1] is odd \u2192 candidate a[1] =4.\n\nq[2] is odd \u2192 candidate a[2] =5.\n\nsum is 1 +1 =2, even \u2192 candidate a[1]+a[2] =9.\n\nSo the minimal is 4. So ans would be 4. But according to the sample's note, the correct answer is 2 (invite 2 and 3, sum is 3 and 2 is invited, so a[1] is not invited, cost 4. Wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (since the pair is (1,2), which are not both invited). So the sum is a[1] + a[3] (since 1 and 3 are not invited). Wait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. If we invite 2 and 3, then 1 is not invited, so a[1] =4. So the unhappiness is 4. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 2. Wait, the sample input says:\n\nIn the second test case, the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. So the unhappiness is a[1] (4) + a[ not invited? No, wait, the invited are 2 and 3, so the unhappiness is a[1] (since 1 is not invited) \u2192 4. But the sample explanation says the answer is 2. Hmm, wait, what's the sample input:\n\nAh, the second test case has:\n\nn=3, m=1.\n\na = [4,5,3].\n\nThe friends pair is 1 and 2.\n\nThe possible options are:\n\n- invite 1 and 2 \u2192 cakes 1 (odd, invalid), so need to avoid that.\n\nSo the correct answer is to invite 2 and 3. Then, the number of cakes is 0 (even). The unhappiness is a[1] (4) since 1 is not invited.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the code would output 4, but the sample expects 2. Wait, this indicates that there's a problem with the approach.\n\nWait, this suggests that the code's approach is wrong. So what's the mistake here?\n\nIn this test case, m is 1 (odd). So the code's approach is to look for the minimal cost to make the number of cakes even.\n\nThe code's code would loop through the pair (1,2):\n\nCheck q[1] and q[2], which are both 1 (since m=1, each is part of one pair).\n\nSo for this pair, option 1 is a[1] =4, option 2 is a[2] =5, option 3: sum of degrees is 2 \u2192 even. So cost a[1]+a[2] =9.\n\nThe minimal among these is 4. But the correct answer is 2 (invite 2 and 3, which gives zero cakes, which is even. The unhappiness is a[1] (4) + a[3] (3) ? No, no. Wait, the invited are 2 and 3. So the not invited are 1. So the unhappiness is 4. So the code would output 4, but according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 2. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that in the second test case, the answer is 2. But according to the code's approach, it's 4. So there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nTest case:\n\n3 1\n\na values: 4,5,3.\n\nFriend pair: 1 and 2.\n\nSample explanation says the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The unhappiness is a[1] + a[3] \u2192 4+3=7? But according to the sample explanation, the unhappiness value is 2. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the second test case, the options are:\n\ninvite 2 and 3 \u2192 cakes 0 (even). Unhappiness is a[1] (4) + a[3] (3) ?\n\nNo. Wait, no. The unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. If invited are 2 and 3, then the not invited is 1. So the sum is a[1] =4.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that this option's unhappiness is 3. Wait, no. The sample explanation lists:\n\ninvite 2 and 3 \u2192 0 cakes (even), unhappiness is 2 (sum of a_1 (4) + a_3 (3) ? No. Wait, the a array is [4,5,3]. So a_1 is 4, a_2 is 5, a_3 is 3.\n\nIf you invite 2 and 3, then the not invited is 1. So the unhappiness is 4.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the unhappiness for this option is 2. Which contradicts.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe sample explanation says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: ... invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2); ... The minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3.\"\n\nBut why is the unhappiness 2?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input. Let me recheck:\n\nThe a array is given as: a_1, a_2, a_3. The second test case's a array is [4,5,3]. So the indices are 1-based.\n\nSo, if 1 is not invited, a_1 is added. If 2 is not invited, a_2 is added, etc.\n\nSo inviting 2 and 3 means that 1 is not invited. So the unhappiness is 4. But the sample says the unhappiness is 2.\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in the sample explanation, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the a array is different. Let's recheck the sample input.\n\nThe sample says:\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=3, m=1.\n\nSecond line: a_1, a_2, a_3 \u2192 4,5,3.\n\nThen, pairs: 1 and 2.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the minimal possible is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. But according to the a array, that would add a_1=4 and a_3=3? Wait, no. Because the invited are 2 and 3. So the not invited is 1. So the unhappiness is a_1=4.\n\nBut the sample says the unhappiness is 2.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the sample explanation, or perhaps the a array is different. But according to the sample input given, the a array is 4,5,3.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different. Let's check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement's note for sample input 2:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: ... invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 3); ... The minimum unhappiness value is achieved by inviting 2 and 3.\"\n\nAh, I see! I made a mistake. The sample explanation says that the unhappiness value is 3. So for the option of inviting 2 and 3:\n\nThe not invited are 1 and 3? No, no. 1 is not invited, 2 and 3 are invited. So the unhappiness is a_1=4. But according to the sample explanation, the unhappiness is 3. So there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the a array is different. Let me recheck.\n\nThe sample input's a array is given as:\n\nThe second line of the test case is 4 5 3. So a_1=4, a_2=5, a_3=3.\n\nIf you invite 2 and 3, then the not invited is 1. So the unhappiness is a_1=4. But according to the sample explanation, the option has unhappiness 3. Which implies that a_3 is not invited. But that would be if the invited are 1 and 2, which would give a cake count of 1 (invalid).\n\nThis is confusing. But perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the sample explanation has a typo. Let me read the problem's sample explanation again.\n\nProblem statement's note for sample 2:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 1 and 2 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 3); invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2); ... The minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3.\"\n\nWait, how does inviting 2 and 3 give an unhappiness of 2? According to the a array, the sum of a_i for those not invited. So not invited is 1. So 4. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that there's an error in the sample explanation, but according to the code's approach, the code would output 4 for this test case. But the sample explanation says the answer is 2. So there's a problem.\n\nThis indicates that the code's approach is incorrect. So where is the error?\n\nAh, wait, the code's approach may not consider other possibilities. For example, what if we exclude multiple people?\n\nThe code's approach only considers removing one or two people (from a pair), but perhaps there's a better solution by removing two different people from different pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm. Let's think differently.\n\nThe correct approach for the second test case:\n\nTest case: n=3, m=1. The pair is (1,2). a values are [4,5,3].\n\nWe need the number of cakes to be even. Since m=1 is odd, the total must be even \u2192 0 cakes.\n\nSo we need to have zero pairs where both friends are invited. So either:\n\n- Neither 1 nor 2 is invited. Then, the unhappiness is a_1 + a_2 =4+5=9. But also, we can invite 3. The unhappiness would be 4+5=9 if 3 is invited, or 9+3=12 if not.\n\nAlternatively, exclude 1 or exclude 2.\n\nExcluding 1: a_1=4. But then, since 1 is excluded, the pair (1,2) is not counted. So the cakes are zero. So it's valid. The unhappiness is 4.\n\nExcluding 2: a_2=5. Cakes zero. Unhappiness 5.\n\nExcluding both 1 and 2: a_1 +a_2=9. Cakes zero. Unhappiness 9.\n\nBut there's another possibility: exclude someone else, like 3. But excluding 3 would not affect the pair (1,2). So if 1 and 2 are invited, the number of cakes is 1 (invalid). So we need to exclude either 1 or 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 4, which is achieved by excluding 1. So the code's approach would output 4.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 2.\n\nThis indicates that there's a mistake in the sample explanation. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. Let's see:\n\nInviting 2 and 3:\n\n- 1 is not invited \u2192 a_1=4.\n\n- 2 and 3 are invited. The pair (1,2) is not both invited. So the cakes are zero.\n\nSo the total is 4. But the sample says it's 2.\n\nThis suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation's a array is different. Perhaps the a array is [4,3,5]. Then, inviting 2 and 3 gives a_1=4, which is the sum. But sample says 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation's a array is [2,5,3]. Then, inviting 2 and 3 would give a_1=2. Which matches the sample's answer.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample input's second line is 4 5 3.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. This suggests that either the sample explanation is incorrect, or the code's approach is missing something.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut why is the sample's answer 2?\n\nLooking back at the sample explanation:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2); ... The minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3.\"\n\nSo the unhappiness value is 2. How is that possible?\n\nAh! Because the unhappiness is the sum of the a_i for those not invited. But if 2 and 3 are invited, then the not invited are 1. So the sum is a[1] =4. But the sample says it's 2. This suggests that the a array in the sample is different.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample input, the second line is:\n\n4 5 3.\n\nSo this is conflicting. Unless there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation refers to a different test case. But according to the note, the second test case is the one with n=3, m=1.\n\nThis indicates that there's a problem with the code's approach. But according to the code's logic, the minimal answer for this test case is 4, but the sample expects 2. This implies that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo what's wrong with the approach?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the code is considering not only the pairs but also other ways to reduce the number of cakes. For example, if we can exclude two pairs by excluding a single person, but that person is part of two pairs.\n\nBut in this test case, m=1. So there's only one pair. Excluding either x or y from that pair removes one pair. So the total becomes zero, which is even. So the minimal cost is min(a[x], a[y]). Which is 4 and 5, so 4.\n\nBut the sample says the answer is 2.\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect, and there's another way to achieve an even number of cakes with lower cost.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different way to have an even number of cakes by excluding other people. For example, inviting no one. Then the number of cakes is zero (even), and the unhappiness is a[1]+a[2]+a[3] =4+5+3=12. Which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, invite only 3. Cakes zero. Unhappiness is a[1]+a[2] =4+5=9.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that inviting 2 and 3 gives unhappiness 3. Which is a[1] (4) + a[3] (3) ? No, that's 7. But sample says 3.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the sample explanation. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, and the sample explanation is wrong.\n\nBut why does the sample explanation say the answer is 2? That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is missing another possibility.\n\nLet's think again about the problem.\n\nThe code's approach is to consider each pair and find the minimal cost by excluding either x, y, or both, provided certain conditions.\n\nBut maybe there's a scenario where excluding two different people, each from different pairs, results in a lower cost.\n\nBut in the second test case, there's only one pair, so that's not possible.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is missing the case where we can exclude a single person who is not in any pair. But since m=1, there are no other pairs.\n\nWait, but for example, in the second test case, if we exclude person 3 (not part of any pair), then the pair (1,2) is still included (if they are both invited). So the number of cakes is 1, which is invalid. So that's not helpful.\n\nSo the code's approach seems correct for this test case. So why does the sample explanation say the answer is 2?\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the sample explanation. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is different than described.\n\nAssuming that the code's approach is correct, then the missing code is as described earlier.\n\nBut given the sample input and the code's approach, the code would output 4 for the second test case. But the sample explanation says 2. So this suggests that the code is wrong.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is missing a case where we can exclude a pair by excluding a single person, but the code's current approach considers this.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should consider another option: exclude both x and y. But the sum of their degrees is even.\n\nIn the second test case, degrees are 1 and 1. Sum is 2, which is even. So option 3 is valid. The cost is a[1] + a[2] =4+5=9. Which is higher than option 1.\n\nBut the sample's answer is 2. So this suggests that the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut how to get a cost of 2?\n\nIn the sample explanation, the answer is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The unhappiness is 2. But according to the a array, this would mean that a_3 is not invited. So the sum of a_i is a_3 =3. But the invited are 2 and 3. So the not invited are 1. Sum is 4.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement or sample explanation.\n\nAssuming that the code's approach is correct, the missing code is as outlined earlier.\n\nTherefore, the code to fill in is the loop over the pairs, and for each pair, compute the minimal of the three options and update the ans.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor(int i=1;i<=m;i++) {\n    int x = b[i].x, y = b[i].y;\n    int curr = 1e9;\n    if (q[x] % 2) curr = a[x];\n    if (q[y] % 2) curr = min(curr, a[y]);\n    if ((q[x] + q[y]) % 2 == 0) curr = min(curr, a[x] + a[y]);\n    ans = min(ans, curr);\n}\n\nSo this is the missing code."
