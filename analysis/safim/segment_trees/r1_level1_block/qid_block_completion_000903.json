The problem is about determining whether a given string can be formed using the stamp operations described. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each time it affects two adjacent cells. Each application flips their colors. The key here is to find out the necessary conditions that the final string must satisfy for it to be possible. So, the existing code is processing each character in the string. When a 'W' is encountered, it checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. If they are, then do something. Otherwise, break.

Let me check that again. The example given in the note for the fifth test case is \"B RB\" (maybe a typo?), but the actual input is \"BRB\". Wait, regardless, the key point is that each non-W chunk must be possible to form. Let's think about the conditions. Each non-W chunk must have at least two cells. Because each stamp operation affects two cells. So any single cell in the chunk (like R) is impossible. So, first check: all non-W chunks must have length >= 2. But in the code provided, when a 'W' is encountered, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. Wait, r_in_chunk is true if there's at least one R in the current chunk, and similarly for B. So, after a W is found, the code checks if (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk). If not, then it breaks, leading to a \"NO\". So, what's the condition here? The code is splitting the string into chunks separated by Ws. For each chunk (sequence of non-W characters), the code is checking if the chunk has both R and B. Because, if a chunk has only R's, then r_in_chunk is true and b_in_chunk is false. So the condition (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk) would be false. Thus, the code breaks and outputs \"NO\". So the code is trying to check for each chunk whether it contains both R and B.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let's think of the problem as building the target string from right to left. Each step, we can choose a pair and set it to either RB or BR.

Then, proceeds to process B and R in the next chunk. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe code starts with r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk as false. When processing the first character, which is W:\n\n- enters the 'if (arr[i] == 'W')' clause.\n\n- checks if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk. Since both are false, proceeds.\n\n- then, what code is there? The code has a TODO here. Ah, here's the problem. The code provided has a TODO in the 'if (arr[i] == 'W')' clause. The code is:\n\nif (arr[i] == 'W') {\n  if (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n  } else {\n    break;\n  }\n} So when a W is encountered, and the previous chunk (before this W) has r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk (which implies either both are false or both are true), then the code proceeds. But in the case where a W is encountered and the current chunk is valid (both R and B present), the code needs to reset the r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk variables for the next chunk. So, the missing code here is to reset r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk to false after processing a W. Because after a W, any subsequent non-W characters form a new chunk.",

When processing the next W (after the B), the code checks if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk (true), so proceeds. But the current chunk is B, which is a single character. However, the code would think that the chunk has both R and B (since r_in_chunk is true from the previous chunk). This would lead to an incorrect YES. So the code must reset the flags after each W.\n\nThus, the missing code is to reset r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk to false when a W is encountered and the current chunk is valid (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk). So the correct code for the TODO part is:\n\nr_in_chunk = false;\nb_in_chunk = false;\n\nThis way, after processing a W, the next non-W characters are treated as a new chunk, and the flags are reset.",

So at the next W, the code checks if they are equal (true). But this would process the second chunk as part of the first, leading to incorrect behavior. So the missing code is resetting the flags after a W is encountered. Therefore, the code that needs to be added is setting r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk to false inside the 'if (arr[i] == 'W')' clause when the condition is met.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what code to fill in the TODO section to make this program work correctly. The problem is about determining whether a given string can be formed using the stamp operations described.\n\nThe stamp can be applied multiple times, and each time it affects two adjacent cells. Each application flips their colors. The key here is to find out the necessary conditions that the final string must satisfy for it to be possible.\n\nSo, the existing code is processing each character in the string. When a 'W' is encountered, it checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. If they are, then do something. Otherwise, break. Then, after processing all characters, if r_in_chunk equals b_in_chunk, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, the variables r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are tracking whether there are any R or B in the current chunk between W's. Because the code is splitting the string into chunks separated by W's, and each chunk must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nThe idea here is that each non-W segment (a chunk between W's) must have both R and B, otherwise it's impossible. Because each stamp operation affects two cells, and the parity of R and B in a chunk must be such that they can be created by some combination of stamps.\n\nWait, for example, if a chunk is all R's, that's impossible because each stamp must create one R and one B. So each chunk must have at least one R and one B. Also, the number of R's and B's must have the same parity? Or maybe not. Because each application of the stamp can flip the colors. For instance, applying a stamp twice on the same two cells would revert them. So the final configuration depends on the number of times each pair is stamped, but modulo 2.\n\nBut perhaps the key condition is that each non-white chunk must have at least one R and one B, and the total counts of R and B in each chunk must satisfy some parity condition. Also, since each stamp operation affects two adjacent cells, maybe the entire chunk's R and B counts must have the same parity. Or perhaps not. Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: Each stamp operation toggles the colors of two adjacent cells. Let's model each cell's color as a state. Since each stamp can be applied multiple times, the order might not matter except for the parity (even or odd number of times). For example, applying the stamp BR once will set the two cells to BR. Applying it again would toggle them back to WW. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is white. So if the stamp is applied once as BR, those two cells become BR. Applying the same stamp again (same orientation) would change BR to WB and BW? Or wait, each time the stamp is applied to the same pair, it's XORed. Wait, perhaps each application of the stamp on a pair (i,j) swaps their colors. But I'm not sure. The problem statement says each usage of the stamp recolors both cells under the stamp. So each application of a stamp on two cells will set them to BR or RB, depending on the stamp's orientation. Wait, no. Because the stamp can be applied in either direction. So each application of the stamp on positions i and i+1 will set them to either RB or BR, regardless of their previous colors. So each stamp application overrides the colors of the two cells. So each stamp can be thought of as applying a specific pattern (either RB or BR) to two consecutive cells, regardless of their previous state. Because the problem statement says \"recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\"\n\nSo each time you use the stamp, you are choosing two adjacent cells and setting them to either RB or BR. So each stamp operation completely changes those two cells. So the order of operations matters, but perhaps certain patterns are possible.\n\nFor example, to create a single R followed by a B followed by B, etc., you need to see if applying the stamp in a way that propagates the colors.\n\nBut how to model this? The problem is to check if the given string can be formed by a sequence of such stamp applications.\n\nThe key observation is that each stamp operation affects exactly two adjacent cells. So each cell (except the first and last) can be part of multiple stamp operations. But the final color of each cell depends on the number of times it is part of a stamp and the orientation of those stamps.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern that the final string must satisfy.\n\nAn alternative approach is to split the string into chunks between W's. For each such chunk, it must be possible to create it using stamps. Also, each chunk must be of length at least 2. Wait, no. Because if there's a single non-W cell, like R, then it's impossible. Because the stamp covers two cells. So any chunk (sequence of non-W cells) must have at least length 1? Wait, but how can a single cell be colored? Each stamp affects two cells. So if there's a chunk of length 1 (e.g., a single R surrounded by Ws), then it's impossible to create that. Because the stamp must cover two cells. Therefore, any chunk (sequence of non-W cells) must have length >=2. Wait, but the example in the problem statement includes a case where the initial step is to apply the stamp to the last two cells of WWWWW, resulting in WWW RB. So the chunk after that is two cells. So for each non-W chunk, the length must be at least 1? No, because if a chunk has length 1, you can't apply the stamp on it. So any chunk of non-W cells must have length at least 2, but that's not the case. Wait, for example, the fifth test case in the notes is \"RBB\", which is a chunk of length 3, but how was that achieved? Wait, the example says for the fifth test case (n=3) the input is \"B RB\". Let me check that again. The example given in the note for the fifth test case is \"B RB\" (maybe a typo?), but the actual input is \"BRB\".\n\nWait, regardless, the key point is that each non-W chunk must be possible to form. Let's think about the conditions.\n\nEach non-W chunk must have at least two cells. Because each stamp operation affects two cells. So any single cell in the chunk (like R) is impossible. So, first check: all non-W chunks must have length >= 2.\n\nBut in the code provided, when a 'W' is encountered, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. Wait, r_in_chunk is true if there's at least one R in the current chunk, and similarly for B. So, after a W is found, the code checks if (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk). If not, then it breaks, leading to a \"NO\".\n\nSo, what's the condition here? The code is splitting the string into chunks separated by Ws. For each chunk (sequence of non-W characters), the code is checking if the chunk has both R and B. Because, if a chunk has only R's, then r_in_chunk is true and b_in_chunk is false. So the condition (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk) would be false. Thus, the code breaks and outputs \"NO\".\n\nSo the code is trying to check for each chunk whether it contains both R and B. Because if a chunk has only R's or only B's, then it's impossible. Because each stamp application must place one R and one B. So, for example, a chunk of two R's would require that each stamp applied to it must have R and B, but that would change the colors. Wait, maybe the code's logic is that each chunk must have both R and B. So any chunk that is all R or all B is invalid.\n\nBut in the code, during the loop, when a 'W' is encountered, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. So if either both are false (meaning the chunk is empty, which can't happen because W is the separator), or both are true. Wait, because when you process a chunk, after a W is found, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. For a valid chunk, they must both be true. Because if the chunk has both R and B, then r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are both true. Wait, no. For example, if the chunk has R and B, then r_in_chunk is true and b_in_chunk is true, so their equality holds. If the chunk has only R, then r_in_chunk is true, b_in_chunk is false. So their equality is false. So the code breaks and returns NO.\n\nSo the code's logic is: each non-W chunk must have at least one R and at least one B. Otherwise, the answer is NO.\n\nAdditionally, after processing all characters, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. Which, for the last chunk (if it's not followed by a W), would require that it has at least one R and B.\n\nBut what about the case where the entire string is W's? Then, r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are both false, so their equality holds. Then the code outputs YES, which is correct because zero stamps are allowed.\n\nSo the code is correctly handling that.\n\nBut wait, there's another condition. The code is missing the check for the length of the chunks. For example, if a chunk has exactly one cell (non-W), then it's impossible. So the code should check that each chunk (except possibly the empty ones) has a length >=2.\n\nBut in the current code, there's no check for the length of the chunk. So the code is missing this part.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"RWWB\", then the code would split into two chunks: \"R\" and \"B\". Both have length 1, which is impossible. So the answer should be NO, but the current code would check that the first chunk has only R (r_in_chunk is true, b_in_chunk is false, so when the W is encountered, the code checks if r and b are equal. Since they are not, the code breaks and outputs NO. So in this case, the code correctly outputs NO. Wait, but the code checks the condition only when a W is encountered. So in the case of a chunk that is the entire string (no Ws), the code doesn't check the length.\n\nWait, the code's logic is that during processing the characters, when a W is found, it checks the previous chunk. But for the last chunk (after the last W), the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal (both true) but also needs to check that the chunk's length is at least 2.\n\nSo the code is missing the check that each chunk (non-W) must have length >=2.\n\nSo the code as written would output YES for a string like \"RB\" (valid), but \"R\" would be invalid. But how to track the length of the current chunk.\n\nWait, the code is not tracking the chunk's length. For example, in a chunk of length 1 (like \"R\"), the code would set r_in_chunk to true and b_in_chunk to false. Then, when the next character is W, the code checks if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk (false) and breaks, leading to a \"NO\". So that's correct.\n\nBut if the entire string is a single non-W chunk of length 1, then after processing all characters, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. For example, if the string is \"R\", then after processing, r_in_chunk is true and b_in_chunk is false. So their equality is false, so the code outputs \"NO\", which is correct.\n\nBut what about a string of length 2 with \"RR\"? Then, during processing, when the first R is encountered, r_in_chunk is true. Then the next R: r_in_chunk remains true. No W is encountered. So after processing all characters, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. Here, r is true, b is false. So they are not equal. Thus, the code outputs \"NO\".\n\nBut in this case, the chunk is of length 2 but has two R's. So the code correctly outputs NO because the chunk must have at least one R and B.\n\nBut what about a chunk of length 3 that's all R's? Like \"RRR\". Then, during processing, r_in_chunk is true, b_in_chunk is false. After processing all characters, the code checks if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk. They are not, so code outputs NO. Which is correct, as such a chunk is invalid.\n\nSo the code is correctly handling the check for the presence of both R and B in each chunk, but it's not checking the chunk length. However, in the code's current setup, when a chunk has only one character (non-W), then the code will detect that because when the next W is encountered (or the end of the string), the code will check if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. For a single R, r is true, b is false. So they are not equal, leading to NO. So even if the chunk length is 1, it's handled.\n\nWait, but how to track the length of the chunk? For example, in the case where the chunk is of length 1 (no Ws, but the entire string is one character), then the code correctly outputs NO. So maybe the code doesn't need to track the length, because a chunk of length 1 would have either R or B, but not both. Thus, the code's existing checks would catch it.\n\nWait, but what if the chunk is of length 2 and has both R and B. For example, \"RB\" is valid and the code outputs YES. That's correct. But what about a chunk of length 2 with \"RR\"? Then, the code would set r_in_chunk to true, b_in_chunk to false. After processing, the code checks if they are equal (no), so outputs NO.\n\nSo the code's existing logic seems to check for the presence of both R and B in each chunk, but how about the length?\n\nAnother example: \"WWRBWW\" \u2014 the chunk is \"RB\" (length 2, valid). So code outputs YES.\n\nAnother example: \"RBW\" \u2014 during processing, when the W is encountered, check if r and b are both true. They are, so code proceeds. Then, after processing all characters, the final check is also for the last chunk (RB) which is valid. So code outputs YES.\n\nAnother example: \"RW\" \u2014 the chunk is 'R' (length 1). When processing the W, the code checks if r and b are equal. Since r is true and b is false, code breaks and outputs NO.\n\nSo the code is handling the chunk length implicitly. Because any chunk that is valid (has both R and B) must have length >=2. Because a chunk of length 1 can't have both R and B.\n\nWait, for a chunk of length 2, if it's \"RB\" then both R and B are present. So code works. If it's \"RR\", then only R is present. So code correctly outputs NO.\n\nBut there's another condition: the parity of the number of R and B in the chunk. For example, can a chunk with even counts of R and B be formed? Or is there any parity requirement?\n\nWait, the problem says that each stamp can be applied multiple times. Each stamp application to a pair of cells sets them to RB or BR. But each stamp application is a choice. So the order of operations may determine the final colors. However, since each stamp application overwrites the two cells, the number of times a pair is stamped matters. For example, if you apply the same stamp (same direction) twice, the cells would revert to their original colors after two applications. So each stamp application is a choice of which direction to use, and how many times to apply it.\n\nBut considering this, the problem can be viewed as finding a way to assign for each consecutive pair (i, i+1) the number of times a stamp is applied (mod 2) and the direction of each application. But this seems complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a graph where each cell's color is determined by the parity of stamps applied to it and its neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the number of R and B in the chunk must be even. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, considering that each stamp application adds exactly one R and one B to the pair. So each application increases the count of R by 1 and B by 1 in the pair. But since the stamp can be applied multiple times, each application toggles the two cells.\n\nWait, no. Because each stamp application sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So each application of a stamp to a pair (i, i+1) overwrites their colors. So the previous colors are irrelevant. So the number of applications to a pair is not additive but rather each application sets the pair's colors to a specific pattern.\n\nThis complicates things. For example, applying the stamp to pair (i, i+1) once as RB, then applying it again as BR would first set them to RB, then to BR. So each application changes the two cells. Thus, the order of applying stamps matters.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAnother observation: the problem is equivalent to building the target string through a series of operations where each operation replaces two consecutive cells with either RB or BR.\n\nBecause each stamp application overwrites the two cells. So the final state is determined by the last stamp applied to each pair. But since the stamp can be applied multiple times, perhaps the order is important. For example, applying a stamp to pair (i, i+1), then to pair (i+1, i+2), then again to (i, i+1) would affect the cells in a way that depends on the order.\n\nThis seems difficult to model. However, perhaps there's a pattern that the target string must satisfy. For example, each chunk of non-W cells must have at least one R and B, and the first and last characters in the chunk must alternate in color.\n\nWait, perhaps the chunk must start and end with different colors, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the sample input given in the problem statement, one of the steps was to create BRB. How was that possible?\n\nLet's see the example: the fifth test case in the note says that the input is \"BRB\" (n=3). The explanation is that the steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB (applying the stamp to the last two cells as RB) \u2192 BRB (applying the stamp to the first two cells as BR). So after two steps, the result is BRB.\n\nSo the first application sets positions 2 and 3 to RB. The second application sets positions 1 and 2 to BR. So after the second application, positions 1 is B, position 2 is R, and position 3 remains B. So the final string is BRB.\n\nSo in this case, the chunk is BRB. The first and last characters are B. So the first and last can be same.\n\nSo the idea that the chunk must start and end with different colors is not valid.\n\nAnother approach: for each chunk, the parity of R and B must be even. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each chunk can be colored in such a way that for even-length chunks, the number of R and B can vary, but for odd-length chunks, certain constraints apply.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the parity of the number of times each cell is stamped. But since each stamp operation covers two adjacent cells, the parity of each cell's stamp count (mod 2) depends on the operations applied to its left and right pairs.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each stamp application affects two cells and sets them to RB or BR, perhaps the following must hold:\n\nIn the target string, for any two consecutive cells in a chunk, they must alternate colors. Because each stamp application forces two cells to be different. But this isn't necessarily the case, as seen in the example where BRB is allowed.\n\nWait, but the example shows that consecutive cells can be the same. For instance, the third example's input is \"RBBW\" which is part of the note and is invalid. Wait, no. The third example in the problem's note says that the answer is NO because it's impossible.\n\nWait, the problem says that for the second, third, and fourth test cases, it's impossible because they have single cells. So perhaps the third test case is, for example, \"R\".\n\nBut another example: the fifth test case's input is \"BRB\", which is allowed. The two consecutive B's (positions 2 and 3) are allowed. How?\n\nAh, because the stamp can be applied to different positions. For example:\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nApply stamp to positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 W RRB? No, wait. Wait the example says:\n\nThe fifth test case's steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB (stamp applied to positions 3-4? Wait, but n=3. Wait the input is n=3. So the steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB (applying the stamp to positions 2-3) \u2192 BRB (applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR). So after first stamp: positions 2 and 3 are RB. So string is W RB. Then applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR, so positions 1 becomes B, position 2 becomes R. So the string becomes BRB. So the final string has B at position 1, R at 2, B at 3. So consecutive positions 2 and 3 are R and B. So consecutive characters are allowed.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the third position is B. So positions 2 and 3 are R and B, which is allowed. So consecutive positions are different.\n\nBut in the sixth test case, the example is \"RBBW\". Wait, according to the note, it's possible. Let's see:\n\nInput is \"RBB\" (n=3). The steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB (positions 2-3) \u2192 RB B. So the final string is RB B. So positions 1-2 are R and B, and 3 is B. So positions 2 and 3 are B and B. Wait, but that's two B's in a row. How is that allowed?\n\nWait, no. The sixth example's input is \"RBB\". The explanation says: the steps are WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 RB B. Wait, how does applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as RB produce R B in positions 1 and 2, and the third position is B. So the string becomes R B B. But this has consecutive B's in positions 2 and 3. How is this possible?\n\nAh, because the stamp is applied to positions 1-2, which sets them to RB. Then, the third position is B. Wait, but initially, the third position was W, and after applying the stamp to positions 2-3, it becomes B. Then, applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as RB would set positions 1 and 2 to R and B. Then, the third position remains B. So the final string is R B B. But this has two B's in positions 2 and 3. How is this possible?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this is allowed. So the code must accept this.\n\nSo the code's existing checks would check the chunk (positions 1-3) which has R, B, B. The code would check if the chunk has at least one R and B, which it does. So the code would output YES. But according to the problem's note, this is possible.\n\nSo the code's existing logic (checking that each non-W chunk has both R and B) is necessary but not sufficient. Because there's another condition: the chunk must be of even length? Or is there a pattern in the colors?\n\nWait, in the sixth test case, the chunk is of length 3. It has R, B, B. But how can this be formed with stamp applications.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Apply stamp to positions 2-3 as RB: the string becomes WWRB \u2192 No, initial string is WWW. Applying the stamp to positions 2-3 as RB would result in W RB. Then, applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as RB would result in RB B. So the final string is RBB.\n\nBut why are the two B's allowed? Because each stamp application is allowed to overwrite previous changes. So the stamp applied to positions 1-2 as RB sets them to R and B. But the third position was previously set to B. So the third position remains B. So the final string is RBB. This is allowed.\n\nBut according to the existing code's logic, this chunk has R and B, so it's allowed. So the code would output YES. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code's existing logic (checking that each non-W chunk has at least one R and B) is sufficient for the sample test case. But is there a case where this is not sufficient?\n\nFor example, a chunk of length 3 with R B B. It has both R and B, but can it be formed?\n\nYes, as per the sixth test case.\n\nSo the code's current logic seems to work for that case.\n\nAnother example: a chunk of length 4 with R R B B. The code would check that both R and B are present. But how can that be formed?\n\nPossible steps: apply stamps to positions 1-2 (BR), 3-4 (BR). Then the string is BR BR. So R R B B. But wait, no. Applying BR to positions 1-2 gives BR. Then applying BR to 3-4 gives BR. So the string is BRBR. Which is R B R B. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, apply the stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 RBWW. Then apply to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R (B) and BR in 2-3. So R \u2192 B in position 2, R in 3. Then apply to 3-4 as RB \u2192 RRB.\n\nWait, perhaps this isn't the way. But the point is that the code's logic checks that each chunk has both R and B, but there's another condition.\n\nHmm. Let's think of a possible scenario where a chunk has both R and B but is impossible to form. For example, a chunk of length 2 with RR. The code would correctly reject it since there's no B. But what about a chunk of length 2 with RB. That's allowed. So code outputs YES.\n\nAnother example: a chunk of length 3 with RBR. The code would check that there are R and B (yes), and output YES. Can that be formed?\n\nYes. Apply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 RBW. Then apply to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 RBR.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code's logic is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, what about a chunk of length 4 with RRRB. This has both R and B. But can it be formed?\n\nLet's see. How?\n\nThe desired string is R R R B.\n\nPossible steps:\n\n1. Apply stamp to positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 WWWRB.\n\n2. Apply stamp to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 WBRB.\n\n3. Apply stamp to positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 BRB B.\n\nWait, that gives B R B B. Not the desired string.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nApply to 1-2 as BR \u2192 BR WW.\n\nApply to 2-3 as BR \u2192 BBR W.\n\nApply to 3-4 as BR \u2192 BBRB.\n\nBut that gives BBRB, which is B B R B. Not R R R B.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's impossible to create R R R B.\n\nBut according to the code, since there's at least one R and B, it would output YES. But is this possible?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is missing a condition. So the code's logic is not sufficient.\n\nSo the code's current logic checks two things:\n\n- Each non-W chunk must have both R and B.\n\nBut perhaps there's another condition: the first and last characters of the chunk must be different.\n\nWait, but in the sixth test case example, the chunk is RBB. The first character is R and the last is B. Different. So maybe that's a condition.\n\nBut in the fifth test case, the chunk is BRB. First character B, last character B. Same. So the condition can't be that.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chunk must have an even number of R and B, but that's not obvious.\n\nAnother approach: consider that each stamp application sets two consecutive cells to either RB or BR. The final pattern of the chunk must be achievable by a sequence of such operations.\n\nFor example, each stamp application can be considered as writing a pair of R and B. But overlapping pairs can overwrite previous changes.\n\nThe problem reduces to whether the target string can be written as a series of such overlapping pairs, where each pair is either RB or BR.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps each chunk must start and end with the same color if its length is odd, or different colors if even. But how?\n\nWait, let's consider possible cases.\n\nFor a chunk of length 2:\n\n- Must be either RB or BR. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nFor a chunk of length 3:\n\nThe first and third characters can be same or different. For example, the fifth test case's chunk is BRB (B and B), which is allowed.\n\nFor a chunk of length 4:\n\nPossible to have RBRB (alternating), or any other combination as long as each pair can be set by a stamp.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the colors must alternate, but this isn't required. For example, the sixth test case's chunk is RBB, which has two B's in a row but is allowed.\n\nSo this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: since each stamp operation can be applied to any pair, the order of operations can affect the final result. However, the parity of the number of times each cell is covered by a stamp may affect the final color.\n\nEach cell (except the first and last) can be part of two pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as building the target string from right to left.\n\nEach step, we can choose a pair and set it to either RB or BR.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For a chunk of length k, the last two cells must be set by a stamp operation. So the last two cells must be either RB or BR.\n\nBut in the case of the sixth test case, the last two cells are BB, which are invalid. But according to the problem statement, this is allowed.\n\nWait, no. The sixth test case's input is \"RBB\", which is allowed. But the last two cells are BB. How?\n\nAh, because the last stamp applied was to the first two cells (positions 1-2), setting them to RB. The third position was set earlier to B. So when the stamp is applied to positions 1-2, the third position remains B, resulting in R B B.\n\nBut how can the third position be B?\n\nBecause in the first step, the stamp was applied to positions 2-3, setting them to RB (so positions 2 is R, 3 is B). Then, applying the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR: positions 1 becomes B, 2 becomes R, and position 3 remains B. So the string becomes B R B. So the last two positions are R and B. Which is allowed.\n\nBut in the sixth test case, according to the note, the input is \"RBB\" (n=3). How is this possible?\n\nThe steps given are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB (applying to positions 2-3) \u2192 RB B (applying to positions 1-2 as RB).\n\nWait, applying to positions 1-2 as RB would set positions 1 and 2 to R and B. Position 3 was set to B in the first step. So the string becomes R B B.\n\nSo the last two positions are B and B. This seems impossible, but according to the problem note, it's allowed.\n\nThis suggests that the code's current logic is incorrect. Because the chunk has R and B (yes), but the last two positions are B and B, which according to the problem's example is valid.\n\nSo the code's current logic is missing something. So what's the actual condition?\n\nAh, I see. The code's current logic only checks that each chunk has at least one R and B. But there's another condition: the entire chunk must not be possible to form even if it has both R and B.\n\nSo the existing code's logic is not sufficient.\n\nSo what's the correct condition?\n\nAfter some research and thinking, I recall that this problem can be solved by checking two conditions for each non-W chunk:\n\n1. The chunk must have at least one R and one B.\n\n2. The length of the chunk must be at least 2.\n\nBut in the code provided, the first condition is checked, but the second is not. But in the code, the second condition is implicitly checked because a chunk of length 1 would have either R or B, but not both, so the code would reject it.\n\nWait, no. A chunk of length 1 would have only one cell, which is non-W, but since the stamp requires two cells, it's impossible. So any chunk of length 1 is invalid.\n\nBut the code's existing logic would catch that, because the chunk of length 1 would have only one R or B, so r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk would be different, leading to a NO.\n\nSo, for example, a chunk of length 1 is impossible, and the code correctly handles it.\n\nBut what about a chunk of length 2 with RR? The code would set r_in_chunk to true and b_in_chunk to false. When processing the end of the string, the code checks if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk (false), so outputs NO.\n\nSo code correctly handles it.\n\nBut what about a chunk of length 3 with RBR (R, B, R). The code will check that there are both R and B, so outputs YES. But can this be formed?\n\nYes. For example:\n\nApply stamp to positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 BR W.\n\nApply stamp to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B RR.\n\nWait, that gives B R R. Not RBR.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nApply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 RB W.\n\nApply stamp to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R BR.\n\nThe final string is R B R. So yes, this is possible. So the code outputs YES, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code's existing logic is sufficient.\n\nBut according to the problem's sixth test case, the code's existing logic would allow the string RBB. Because:\n\nr_in_chunk is true (due to R in position 1), and b_in_chunk is true (due to B in positions 2 and 3). So after processing all characters, r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are both true. So the code outputs YES.\n\nWhich is correct according to the problem's note.\n\nSo the code's existing logic is correct. So why is the code not passing all test cases? Perhaps the code is missing something.\n\nLooking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code loops through each character. When a W is encountered, it checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. If they are not, break and output NO. Then, after the loop, it checks if the final chunk (the one after the last W) is valid by checking if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk.\n\nBut the code is missing the reset of r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk after each W. Because when a W is encountered, it processes the current chunk (before the W), but then the variables r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are not reset. So, for example, in the case of \"WBRW\", after the first W, the code checks the current chunk (which is empty, so r and b are both false). Then, proceeds to process B and R in the next chunk.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe code starts with r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk as false.\n\nWhen processing the first character, which is W:\n\n- enters the 'if (arr[i] == 'W')' clause.\n\n- checks if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk. Since both are false, proceeds.\n\n- then, what code is there? The code has a TODO here.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code provided has a TODO in the 'if (arr[i] == 'W')' clause. The code is:\n\nif (arr[i] == 'W') {\n  if (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n  } else {\n    break;\n  }\n}\n\nSo when a W is encountered, and the previous chunk (before this W) has r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk (which implies either both are false or both are true), then the code proceeds. But in the case where a W is encountered and the current chunk is valid (both R and B present), the code needs to reset the r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk variables for the next chunk.\n\nSo, the missing code here is to reset r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk to false after processing a W. Because after a W, any subsequent non-W characters form a new chunk. So, after checking that the previous chunk is valid (r and b are both present or both absent), we need to reset the flags for the new chunk.\n\nFor example, consider the string \"RBRBWWBRB\". When processing the first W, after checking that the previous chunk (RBRB) is valid (both R and B present), the code should reset the r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk variables to false for the next chunk (BRB).\n\nBut in the current code, after encountering a W, the code checks if r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are equal. If they are (like both true), then proceeds. But the code doesn't reset them. So the next characters would be part of the same chunk (since r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are still true). This would lead to incorrect processing.\n\nSo the missing code is to reset r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk to false after a W is encountered and the current chunk is valid.\n\nThus, the TODO code should be:\n\nr_in_chunk = false;\nb_in_chunk = false;\n\nThis way, after a W is processed, the next characters belong to a new chunk, starting with both flags reset.\n\nWithout this reset, the code would accumulate r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk for all previous chunks. For example, consider the input \"RWWB\". The code would process the first chunk (R), which is invalid (only R), so output NO. But if the input is \"RBWWB\", the code would process the first W after the first chunk (RB). Since r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are both true, the code proceeds. Then, the next chunk is W, but then the next chunk is B. But since the code didn't reset the flags after the first W, the variables r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are still true and true. When processing the next W (after the B), the code checks if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk (true), so proceeds. But the current chunk is B, which is a single character. However, the code would think that the chunk has both R and B (since r_in_chunk is true from the previous chunk). This would lead to an incorrect YES.\n\nSo the code must reset the flags after each W.\n\nThus, the missing code is to reset r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk to false when a W is encountered and the current chunk is valid (r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk).\n\nSo the correct code for the TODO part is:\n\nr_in_chunk = false;\nb_in_chunk = false;\n\nThis way, after processing a W, the next non-W characters are treated as a new chunk, and the flags are reset.\n\nWithout this reset, any W encountered would leave the flags as they are, leading to incorrect processing of subsequent chunks.\n\nFor example, let's take the input \"RBWBR\".\n\nProcessing the first chunk \"RB\":\n\n- r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are true. When the W is encountered, the code checks if they are equal (true), so the code proceeds. The TODO code is to reset them to false.\n\nThen, the next chunk is \"BR\".\n\n- Process B: b_in_chunk becomes true.\n\n- Process R: r_in_chunk becomes true.\n\nAt the end of the loop, check if r_in_chunk == b_in_chunk (true). So output YES.\n\nBut if the reset is not done, after processing the first W, the r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk are still true. The next characters 'B' and 'R' would set b_in_chunk to true (but it's already true), then r_in_chunk to true. So at the next W, the code checks if they are equal (true). But this would process the second chunk as part of the first, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nSo the missing code is resetting the flags after a W is encountered.\n\nTherefore, the code that needs to be added is setting r_in_chunk and b_in_chunk to false inside the 'if (arr[i] == 'W')' clause when the condition is met."
