The goal is to find the minimal total energy for both of them to reach their destinations. Let's break down their movements. Stanley starts at (1,1) and goes to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). Each step (adjacent move) costs 1. Portals allow them to teleport with a cost of 1, but Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So, the optimal path probably involves them using the portals effectively. The key is to figure out the best meeting point where they can use the portals to minimize their combined steps. Looking at the sample explanation: when a=7 and b=5, the solution was 15. Let's see how that formula works. Wait, the code currently has a case when a >= b, outputting (a + 2*b -2). But when a < b, what's the formula? Hmm. Let's think about possible scenarios. The minimal energy probably comes from choosing a portal that's optimal for both. Since Megan is placing portals along her path, maybe the best is for both to use a certain portal once. Wait, perhaps the optimal path is when Megan creates a portal at some point, and both use it. For example, Megan's path may be from (n,1) to some point (x,y) then to (1,m). Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (x,y) via teleport, then to (n,m). But how to model this? Alternatively, maybe the minimal energy is when Megan's path creates portals that allow both to minimize their path.",

But perhaps the optimal path is that Megan creates a portal at a certain cell, and both use that to teleport. But how do we model this for the general case?\n\nLooking for patterns in the sample input. The sample given in the note is when n=7, m=5. The answer is 15. Let's see how that would fit into the existing code. In the code's current logic, when a >= b, it's a + 2*b -2. For a=7 and b=5, that would be 7 + 10 -2=15, which matches the sample. So that case is covered. But when a < b, the code is missing. So the code's logic for a < b must be different. Wait, in the sample, a=7 (n) and m=5 (b). But in the code's logic, a >=b is true here. So the code uses that formula. So that works. But when a < b, we need a different formula. Let's think of cases where a < b. For example, n=2, m=3.",

For example, if the portal is at (1, m-1) or something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is min(a + 2b -2, 2a +b -2) if n and m are not 1. But for n=2, m=3, 2a +b-2=5, which is higher than 4. So this formula is not correct. Hmm. This suggests that the existing code's logic for a >=b works, but the a < b case requires a different approach. Another approach: consider that the minimal sum is the sum of their paths minus the maximum of (n-1, m-1) plus 1. Wait, in the sample case:\n\nn=7, m=5. Stanley's path: (1,1) to (7,5). Normally 6+4=10 steps. Megan's path: (7,1) to (1,5). Normally 6+4=10 steps. Sum is 20. But the sample answer is 15. The difference is 5. Which is the maximum of (6,4) (6) plus 1? No, 6+1=7. 20-7=13. No. Not matching. Alternatively, 20 - (6+4) + (6+4 -1) + something. Not sure. Alternatively, the minimal sum is (n-1 + m-1) * 2 - (max(n,m) -1) + 1. For sample case: (6+4)*2=20. Subtract 6 (7-1), add 1: 20-6+1=15. Which matches. For the case where a=2, m=3: (2-1 +3-1)*2 = (1+2)*2=6. Subtract max(2,3)-1=3-1=2. Add 1:6-2+1=5. But earlier example suggests sum could be 4, which is lower than 5. So this formula is not correct. Hmm. Confusing. Let's think of another sample case. For n=1 and m=1. Then the answer is 0. Which is handled by the code. What about n=1 and m=2. Stanley's path: (1,1) to (1,2). Steps 1. Megan's path: (1,1) to (1,2). Steps 1. Sum is 2. But according to the existing code, since a=1 >= b=2? No, a=1 is less than b=2. So the code would enter the a < b case, which is missing. So for this case, what's the correct answer? Megan's path is (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). She leaves portals here. Stanley starts at (1,1), goes to (1,2). No need to use portals. Sum is 1+1=2. If the code outputs 2 for a=1, m=2, then the formula for a < b must handle it. Another example: n=3, m=3.\n\na=3, b=3. The existing code uses a >=b formula: 3+2*3-2=7. But what's the actual minimal sum?\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (3,3). Normal steps:4+2=6 steps. Using portals, maybe he can save steps. Megan's path: (3,1) to (1,3). Steps:2+2=4. Using portals, perhaps she can teleport. But what's the optimal sum? Wait, Megan's path could be (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (1,3).

So her steps: 1 +1 = 2. Total sum is 2+2=4. But according to the formula 2a +b-2=5. So why is the sum 4?\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the formula is not correct, and that there's a different formula when a < b. So what's the correct formula for a < b? Let's think of other examples. If a=2, m=4. What's the minimal sum? Megan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4). Portals at all these cells. Stanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,4) via teleport (cost 1). Then move down to (2,4) (cost 1). Total steps: 1+1=2. Megan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (1 step) \u2192 teleport to (1,4) (cost 1). So sum 1+1=2. Total sum 4. But according to 2a +b -2: 2*2 +4-2=6. Which is higher than 4. So again, this suggests that the formula for a < b is different. So what is the correct formula? Alternative idea: For a < b, the minimal sum is (a + b) + (min(a,b) - 2) ). Wait, for the sample case a=7, b=5, but a >=b, so the formula is a+2*b-2. But when a <b, perhaps it's 2*a +b -2. But in the cases above, that gives higher values than possible. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a <b is a + b + min(a,b) -2. Wait, for a=2, b=3: 2+3+2-2=5. Which doesn't match the example where sum is 4. This isn't helpful. Alternative approach: find a pattern in possible test cases. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: n=1, m=1. Sum 0. Case 2: n=1, m=2. Sum 2. Case 3: n=2, m=2. Sum is (2+2*2-2) = 4. Which would be 4 steps. Let's see:\n\nStanley: 1 step to (2,2). Megan: 1 step to (1,2). But wait, Megan starts at (2,1) and needs to go to (1,2). Her path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). Steps: 2. Stanley's path is (1,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (2,2). Steps: 2. Sum 4. Which matches the formula. But according to the existing code's formula for a >=b: a=2, b=2, sum 2+4-2=4. Yes. Another case: n=2, m=3. We think the sum should be 4. But according to the existing code's formula for a < b, which is missing, what is it? What if the formula for a < b is (2*a + b -2) ?\n\n2*2 +3-2=5. Which is higher than the possible 4. So that's not correct. Alternative approach: let's try to find the minimal sum formula for a < b.\n\nThe formula for a >=b is a + 2*b -2. But for a < b, perhaps it's the same as the formula for when b >= a, but swapping the roles. Wait, perhaps the formula is min( a + 2*b -2, 2*a + b -2 ). But for a=2, m=3: min(2 + 6-2=6, 4+3-2=5) \u2192 5. But earlier example suggests sum could be 4. So this is not correct. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to find the formula for the general case. Let me think of the problem in terms of the portals. The portals are placed along Megan's path.

Or any combination. This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal sum is the same for both cases (a >=b and a <b) and can be written as (a + m) + (min(a,m) - 2). But this is just a guess. Alternatively, based on the existing code's logic and the sample, perhaps the correct formula for a <b is 2*a +b -2. But in the example where a=2, m=3, this gives 5, but the actual sum is 4. So why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in that example. Wait, let's re-calculate for a=2, m=3. Megan's path: She starts at (2,1). She needs to reach (1,3). Her minimal path is steps: (2-1) + (3-1) =1+2=3 steps. But if she uses a portal, she can save steps. For example, she moves to (2,2) (1 step), then teleports to (1,3) (1 step). So her energy is 1+1=2. Stanley starts at (1,1). He can move to (1,2) (1 step), teleport to (2,2) (1), then move to (2,3) (1). His energy is 1+1+1=3. Sum is 2+3=5. Which matches the formula 2*a +b -2=5. But earlier scenario where sum was 4 is not possible? Or is there a mistake in that scenario?",

According to the formula 2a +b -2 for a=3, b=4: 6+4-2=8. Which is higher than 6. So again, the formula doesn't hold. Hmm. So what's the pattern here? In the case where a=2, m=3, the minimal sum is 4. In the case where a=3, m=4, sum is 6. What's the relation between a and m in these cases? In the first case: 2+3=5. 5-1=4. In the second: 3+4=7. 7-1=6. Ah! So the sum is (a + m) + (a + m) - (max(a, m) +1) ? Wait, for a=2, m=3: (2+3) + (2+3) - (3+1) =5+5-4=6. No, but the sum was 4. Hmm. Alternative approach: when a < m, the minimal sum is a + m + a -1. For a=2, m=3: 2+3+2-1=6. Which doesn't match. Alternatively, for a < m, the sum is a + m + (a-1). For a=2, m=3: 2+3+1=6. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is a + m -2 + a.\n\nFor a=2, m=3: 2+3-2+2=5. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is (a-1)*2 + m-1 + a-1 + m-1. No. For a=2, m=3: (1)*2 +2 +1 +2=2+2+3=7. Not helpful. Alternative idea: for a < b, the minimal sum is (a + m) * 2 - (m - a) - 2. For a=2, m=3: (5)*2 -1 -2=10-3=7. No.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is a + m + a -1. For a=2, m=3: 2+3+2-1=6. No.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Another approach: think of the problem in terms of the portals. Megan's path must be from (n,1) to (1,m). The minimal path length is (n-1)+(m-1) steps. But she can choose to take any path, which leaves portals along the way. The optimal path is the one that allows both her and Stanley to teleport in a way that minimizes the total energy. The portals can be used by both once each. Each teleport costs 1 unit. Stanley's path: from (1,1) to his destination (n,m). He can teleport once. Megan's path: from (n,1) to her destination (1,m). She can teleport once. The total energy is the sum of their individual steps plus 1 for each teleport.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about Stanley and Megan moving through a grid, using portals to minimize their total energy. The code provided handles some cases but is missing part of the logic, especially when a < b.\n\nSo first, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The goal is to find the minimal total energy for both of them to reach their destinations. Let's break down their movements.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and goes to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). Each step (adjacent move) costs 1. Portals allow them to teleport with a cost of 1, but Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So, the optimal path probably involves them using the portals effectively.\n\nThe key is to figure out the best meeting point where they can use the portals to minimize their combined steps.\n\nLooking at the sample explanation: when a=7 and b=5, the solution was 15. Let's see how that formula works. Wait, the code currently has a case when a >= b, outputting (a + 2*b -2). But when a < b, what's the formula?\n\nHmm. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nThe minimal energy probably comes from choosing a portal that's optimal for both. Since Megan is placing portals along her path, maybe the best is for both to use a certain portal once.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path is when Megan creates a portal at some point, and both use it. For example, Megan's path may be from (n,1) to some point (x,y) then to (1,m). Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (x,y) via teleport, then to (n,m).\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal energy is when Megan's path creates portals that allow both to minimize their path.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe total energy is the sum of Stanley's energy and Megan's energy, but they can share portals. So the minimal sum would involve them using a common portal (or two) to save steps.\n\nWait, the portals are placed by Megan as she moves. So the portals are in every cell Megan has visited. So, Megan's path determines where the portals are. So, the optimal path for Megan would be to create a portal in a cell that allows both Stanley and Megan to teleport to it, thereby saving steps.\n\nLet's consider the possible paths for Megan and Stanley.\n\nMegan's path:\n\nShe needs to go from (n,1) to (1,m). The minimal steps for her would be (n-1) + (m-1) steps. But she leaves portals along her path. But using portals, perhaps she can teleport from her starting point to somewhere else, but that's not possible unless she already placed portals. Wait, no\u2014 Megan's first step is from (n,1), which leaves a portal there. So any portal she steps on can be used once she passes through.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal path is that Megan creates a portal at a certain cell, and both use that to teleport.\n\nBut how do we model this for the general case?\n\nLooking for patterns in the sample input. The sample given in the note is when n=7, m=5. The answer is 15. Let's see how that would fit into the existing code.\n\nIn the code's current logic, when a >= b, it's a + 2*b -2. For a=7 and b=5, that would be 7 + 10 -2=15, which matches the sample. So that case is covered. But when a < b, the code is missing. So the code's logic for a < b must be different.\n\nWait, in the sample, a=7 (n) and m=5 (b). But in the code's logic, a >=b is true here. So the code uses that formula. So that works. But when a < b, we need a different formula.\n\nLet's think of cases where a < b. For example, n=2, m=3.\n\nWhat would be the optimal path here?\n\nPossible scenario:\n\nMegan's path: from (2,1) to (2,2), then to (1,2), then to (1,3). But she leaves portals at each cell. So the portals are at (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to (1,2) (steps 1), then teleport to (2,2) (cost 1), then to (2,3) (steps 1). Total for Stanley: 1 (steps) + 1 (teleport) +1 (steps) = 3.\n\nMegan's path: from (2,1) to (2,2) (1 step), then teleport to (1,2) (cost 1), then to (1,3) (1 step). Total for Megan: 1 +1 +1=3. Total combined: 3+3=6.\n\nBut what's the actual minimal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's compute the minimal sum.\n\nAnother approach is to find the best portal cell (x,y) such that Megan's path includes that cell, and both Stanley and Megan can use it to minimize their paths.\n\nSuppose the best portal is (1,1). But Megan can't reach there unless she goes there. Wait, Megan starts at (n,1). So for small n and m, perhaps the optimal is when Megan's path is such that she reaches a certain point, and both use that.\n\nBut how to model this mathematically.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal total energy is the sum of their individual minimal paths plus some adjustments from using portals. However, using portals can save steps.\n\nThe key is to find a point where using the portals can save the maximum steps for both.\n\nAnother possible approach is to find the minimal sum of (Stanley's path) + (Megan's path), but considering that both can use portals once.\n\nLet's model each possible path for Stanley and Megan, using portals.\n\nFor Stanley:\n\nHe can go from (1,1) to portal A, teleport to portal B, then go to (n,m).\n\nFor Megan:\n\nShe goes from (n,1) to portal C, teleport to portal D, then go to (1,m).\n\nBut since all portals are placed by Megan, all portals are on her path. So Stanley can only use portals that are on Megan's path.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is for both to use the same portal or two different portals along Megan's path to minimize their total steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best is for Megan to take a path that allows her to create a portal that's optimal for both.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the general case.\n\nSuppose that Megan's path is along the optimal path (the minimal steps possible). So she moves from (n,1) to (1, m), taking (n-1)+(m-1) steps. But since she leaves portals in all cells she visits, Stanley can use any of those cells to teleport.\n\nSo Stanley can choose to teleport once from a portal cell to another.\n\nWhat's the minimal path for Stanley?\n\nStanley's path without portals would be (n-1)+(m-1) steps. But using portals, perhaps he can save some steps.\n\nSimilarly for Megan's path, but her path is fixed as she's placing the portals. Wait, no. Megan's path can be chosen arbitrarily. The problem allows them to choose their paths optimally. So Megan's path can be chosen such that it creates portals in positions that minimize the total energy.\n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing Megan's path and their teleportation points such that the sum of their energies is minimized.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: Both use a single portal.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is such that there's a portal at (x,y) that both can use. Stanley can go to (x,y) normally, then teleport to some other portal, but perhaps the best is to teleport once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best is for Megan to create a portal at some cell that's on the minimal path for both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is when Megan creates a portal at a cell that allows both to teleport once and save steps.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe total energy is the sum of:\n\nStanley's energy: (steps to a portal cell) + 1 (teleport) + steps from teleport destination to his end.\n\nMegan's energy: (steps to a portal cell) +1 (teleport) + steps from teleport destination to her end.\n\nBut since all portals are on Megan's path, the portals available are all cells she has visited. So, for example, Megan's path could be designed such that she leaves a portal at (x,y), which is the point where Stanley teleports from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal is for Megan to go directly from (n,1) to (1,m), and Stanley uses the portals along that path.\n\nBut this seems vague. Let's look for a mathematical pattern.\n\nLooking at the existing code:\n\nIf a >= b, output (a + 2*b -2).\n\nFor example, when a=7, b=5: 7 + 2*5 -2=15. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: if a=3, b=2. Then 3+4-2=5. Let's see.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (3,2). Then teleport? Hmm. Maybe when a is >= b, the formula is derived from some pattern.\n\nBut for a < b, what's the formula?\n\nLooking for another example. Let's say n=2, m=3. Here a=2 < b=3. What's the minimal sum?\n\nPossible scenario:\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3). Portals at all these cells.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) (already there) teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then move to (2,3) (cost 1). So Stanley's total is 0 steps +1 teleport +1 step = 2.\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (1 step), teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then done. So 1 +1 = 2. Total sum 4. But maybe this isn't possible.\n\nWait, Megan starts at (2,1). She needs to reach (1,3). The minimal path is 3 steps (right, right, up), but maybe there's a better path using portals.\n\nAlternatively, Megan's steps:\n\nShe can walk from (2,1) to (1,1) (1 step), then teleport to (1,3) (1 unit), then that's her destination. So total steps 1 +1 = 2.\n\nStanley's steps: starts at (1,1), teleport to (1,3) (1), then go to (2,3) (1 step). Total 2.\n\nSum is 2+2=4. Which is better than other options.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nIn that case, the formula would be (m + ... ), perhaps. But how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for a < b is similar but swapped. For example, 2a + b -2.\n\nBut let's test with n=2, m=3. 2*2 +3 -2=5. But the scenario above gives sum 4, which is less than 5. So that formula wouldn't work.\n\nHmm. So maybe the existing code's logic is incomplete.\n\nWait, what's the general approach here?\n\nThe key idea is to find the minimal total energy for both to reach their destinations, possibly using a portal once each.\n\nThe minimal total energy is the sum of:\n\nStanley's energy: steps from start to a portal, plus 1 teleport, plus steps from teleport destination to end.\n\nMegan's energy: steps from start to a portal (she leaves portals along her path), plus 1 teleport, plus steps from teleport destination to end.\n\nBut since Megan's path is part of the optimization, she can choose the path that allows for the best portals.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal portals are such that the sum of the two's steps is minimized.\n\nLet me consider that the optimal point for the portals is the cell where Megan's path and Stanley's path intersect, but that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal is for Megan to create a portal at (1,1) (Stanley's starting point). Then Stanley can start there, use teleport (cost 1) to another portal, perhaps near the end. But Megan needs to visit (1,1) first.\n\nBut how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum can be found by considering two possible scenarios:\n\n1. They both teleport once. For example, they find a portal along their paths to minimize their steps.\n\n2. One of them teleports and the other doesn't.\n\nWe need to find which scenario gives the minimal sum.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is the minimum between several possible candidates.\n\nFor example, the candidates could be:\n\n- The sum when both take their minimal paths without using any portals.\n\nBut that sum would be (n-1 + m-1) * 2 (since both have to walk their entire paths).\n\nAlternatively, maybe using portals can save steps.\n\nSo, the possible minimal sum is the minimum between several options.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula.\n\nWhen a >= b:\n\nThe existing code uses a + 2*b - 2.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the optimal is when Megan's path allows for Stanley to use portals to save steps. For example, when a=7 and b=5, the formula gives 15, which matches the sample.\n\nSo perhaps when a >= b, the formula is a + 2b - 2.\n\nWhen a < b, maybe the formula is 2a + b - 2.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nIf n=2, m=3. a=2, b=3. Then 2a +b -2 =4+3-2=5.\n\nBut earlier example suggested sum could be 4.\n\nSo that's a discrepancy. So maybe this formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula when a < b is min(a + 2b -2, 2a + b -2).\n\nBut this is getting a bit stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the minimal sum in terms of n and m.\n\nAnother possible formula that works for the sample when a >=b is (a-1) + 2*(b-1) + (a-1) + (b-1). Wait, let's see.\n\nSample a=7, m=5. (7-1) + 2*(5-1) =6+8=14. Plus (7-1)+(5-1) =6+4=10. Sum 24. No, that's not matching. So perhaps that's not the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is calculated as follows:\n\nThe minimal sum is the sum of the minimal paths for both, minus the maximum possible overlapping steps that can be saved by using portals.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is (n + m - 2) * 2 - (max(n,m) -1) + 1.\n\nWait, for the sample where n=7, m=5: (7+5-2)*2 =10*2=20. Then subtract (7-1)=6, add 1: 20-6+1=15. Which matches.\n\nSo the formula would be (n + m -2)*2 - (max(n,m) -1) +1.\n\nWhich simplifies to 2*(n + m -2) - max(n,m) +1 +1.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n2*(n+m-2) - (max(n,m) -1) +1.\n\nWhich is 2n + 2m -4 - max(n,m) +1 +1?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's re-express:\n\nOriginal sample's formula: 7+2*5 -2 = 7+10-2=15.\n\nWhich is a +2*b -2. That's for when a >=b.\n\nIf we use this formula when a >=b, then for a < b, perhaps the formula is 2a +b -2.\n\nFor example, if a=2, b=3: 2*2 +3 -2=5. But earlier example suggests that sum could be 4.\n\nBut maybe the correct answer for a=2, m=3 is 5.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIf the formula for a < b is 2a +b -2, then for a=2, m=3, sum is 5.\n\nBut what is the actual minimal sum?\n\nLet me re-examine the case where n=2 and m=3.\n\nStanley's path:\n\n(1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,3). Steps: 3. Or, he could use a portal.\n\nMegan's path:\n\n(2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). Steps:3. But she can teleport.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nMegan takes path (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (1 step). Then she can teleport to (1,3) (cost 1). Then she is at (1,3), which is her destination. So her total energy is 1 +1 =2.\n\nStanley can start at (1,1). He can teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then go to (2,3) (1 step). So his energy is 1+1=2.\n\nTotal sum 2+2=4.\n\nBut according to the formula 2a +b -2, where a=2, b=3: 2*2 +3-2=5. Which is higher than 4.\n\nSo the formula isn't correct.\n\nSo, there's a problem with the existing logic for when a < b.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula depends on the parity of the difference between n and m, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is the minimum between the two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: when the optimal portal is along Megan's path in a way that allows both to save steps. For example, if the portal is at (1, m-1) or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is min(a + 2b -2, 2a +b -2) if n and m are not 1. But for n=2, m=3, 2a +b-2=5, which is higher than 4. So this formula is not correct.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the existing code's logic for a >=b works, but the a < b case requires a different approach.\n\nAnother approach: consider that the minimal sum is the sum of their paths minus the maximum of (n-1, m-1) plus 1.\n\nWait, in the sample case:\n\nn=7, m=5.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (7,5). Normally 6+4=10 steps. Megan's path: (7,1) to (1,5). Normally 6+4=10 steps. Sum is 20. But the sample answer is 15. The difference is 5. Which is the maximum of (6,4) (6) plus 1? No, 6+1=7. 20-7=13. No. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, 20 - (6+4) + (6+4 -1) + something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is (n-1 + m-1) * 2 - (max(n,m) -1) + 1. For sample case: (6+4)*2=20. Subtract 6 (7-1), add 1: 20-6+1=15. Which matches.\n\nFor the case where a=2, m=3: (2-1 +3-1)*2 = (1+2)*2=6. Subtract max(2,3)-1=3-1=2. Add 1:6-2+1=5. But earlier example suggests sum could be 4, which is lower than 5. So this formula is not correct.\n\nHmm. Confusing.\n\nLet's think of another sample case. For n=1 and m=1. Then the answer is 0. Which is handled by the code.\n\nWhat about n=1 and m=2.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (1,2). Steps 1.\n\nMegan's path: (1,1) to (1,2). Steps 1.\n\nSum is 2. But according to the existing code, since a=1 >= b=2? No, a=1 is less than b=2. So the code would enter the a < b case, which is missing.\n\nSo for this case, what's the correct answer?\n\nMegan's path is (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). She leaves portals here. Stanley starts at (1,1), goes to (1,2). No need to use portals. Sum is 1+1=2.\n\nIf the code outputs 2 for a=1, m=2, then the formula for a < b must handle it.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=3.\n\na=3, b=3. The existing code uses a >=b formula: 3+2*3-2=7.\n\nBut what's the actual minimal sum?\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (3,3). Normal steps:4+2=6 steps. Using portals, maybe he can save steps.\n\nMegan's path: (3,1) to (1,3). Steps:2+2=4. Using portals, perhaps she can teleport.\n\nBut what's the optimal sum?\n\nWait, Megan's path could be (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (1,3). But she can teleport after creating portals.\n\nAlternatively, she could move to (3,3), then teleport to (1,3), saving steps. But how?\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the correct formula based on the existing code.\n\nThe existing code has the following cases:\n\nif a == 1 and b == 1: 0.\n\nelse if a >= b: output (a + 2*b -2).\n\nelse if a < b: missing.\n\nSo for a < b, what formula should we use.\n\nLet's think of the case where a=1 and b=2. The answer is 2. According to the existing code, since a < b, the missing code would need to compute this.\n\nIf the formula for a < b is (2*a + b -2), then 2*1+2-2=2. Which matches.\n\nFor the case where a=2, m=3. The existing formula gives 2*2 +3-2=5, but the actual sum can be 4. So there's a discrepancy.\n\nBut perhaps the correct answer for that case is 5. Maybe my previous assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate.\n\nCase a=2, m=3.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,3). Steps: 3.\n\nBut with portals:\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). Portals are in all these cells.\n\nStanley can use portals. For example:\n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then move to (2,3) (cost 1). Total steps: 1 +1 = 2.\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (1 step). Then she can teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), and she's done. So her steps: 1 +1 = 2.\n\nTotal sum is 2+2=4.\n\nBut according to the formula 2a +b-2=5. So why is the sum 4?\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the formula is not correct, and that there's a different formula when a < b.\n\nSo what's the correct formula for a < b?\n\nLet's think of other examples.\n\nIf a=2, m=4.\n\nWhat's the minimal sum?\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4). Portals at all these cells.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,4) via teleport (cost 1). Then move down to (2,4) (cost 1). Total steps: 1+1=2.\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (1 step) \u2192 teleport to (1,4) (cost 1). So sum 1+1=2.\n\nTotal sum 4.\n\nBut according to 2a +b -2: 2*2 +4-2=6. Which is higher than 4.\n\nSo again, this suggests that the formula for a < b is different.\n\nSo what is the correct formula?\n\nAlternative idea: For a < b, the minimal sum is (a + b) + (min(a,b) - 2) ).\n\nWait, for the sample case a=7, b=5, but a >=b, so the formula is a+2*b-2. But when a <b, perhaps it's 2*a +b -2. But in the cases above, that gives higher values than possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a <b is a + b + min(a,b) -2.\n\nWait, for a=2, b=3: 2+3+2-2=5. Which doesn't match the example where sum is 4.\n\nThis isn't helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: find a pattern in possible test cases.\n\nLet's see:\n\nCase 1: n=1, m=1. Sum 0.\n\nCase 2: n=1, m=2. Sum 2.\n\nCase 3: n=2, m=2. Sum is (2+2*2-2) = 4. Which would be 4 steps. Let's see:\n\nStanley: 1 step to (2,2). Megan: 1 step to (1,2). But wait, Megan starts at (2,1) and needs to go to (1,2). Her path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). Steps: 2. Stanley's path is (1,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (2,2). Steps: 2. Sum 4. Which matches the formula.\n\nBut according to the existing code's formula for a >=b: a=2, b=2, sum 2+4-2=4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=3.\n\nWe think the sum should be 4. But according to the existing code's formula for a < b, which is missing, what is it?\n\nWhat if the formula for a < b is (2*a + b -2) ?\n\n2*2 +3-2=5. Which is higher than the possible 4.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: let's try to find the minimal sum formula for a < b.\n\nThe formula for a >=b is a + 2*b -2.\n\nBut for a < b, perhaps it's the same as the formula for when b >= a, but swapping the roles.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is min( a + 2*b -2, 2*a + b -2 ).\n\nBut for a=2, m=3: min(2 + 6-2=6, 4+3-2=5) \u2192 5. But earlier example suggests sum could be 4.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to find the formula for the general case.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the portals.\n\nThe portals are placed along Megan's path. So Megan's path is optimal in terms of creating portals that both can use.\n\nThe optimal scenario would be for Megan to create a path that allows both her and Stanley to use a single teleport each, saving the maximum number of steps.\n\nFor example, Megan's path could be designed to reach a certain cell where she can teleport to another cell closer to her destination. Similarly for Stanley.\n\nAlternatively, the best way is to find a portal that is in the same row or column as both their destinations.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal sum as the sum of the minimal possible steps for both, minus the maximum possible overlap that can be saved by teleporting once each.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal sum is (n + m -2) * 2 - max(n, m) + 1.\n\nFor example, when n=7, m=5: (7+5-2)*2 =10*2=20. 20 -7+1=14. No, doesn't match the sample.\n\nSample requires 15. So not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: look for a pattern in the existing code.\n\nThe existing code's formula for a >=b is a + 2*b -2. Which seems to be derived from the following:\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (1, m) steps (m-1), teleport to (n,1) steps 1, then to (n,m) steps (m-1). So total steps (m-1 +1 +m-1) = 2m-1. But for a=7, m=5: 2*5-1=9. But in the sample, Stanley's steps are 2+6 (walking) +1 (teleport) +2 (walking). Wait, that's 2+6+1+2=11. Which doesn't match. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the formula a + 2*b -2 could be derived from other steps.\n\nFor example, when a >=b, perhaps Megan's path is such that she creates a portal that allows both to teleport once, saving steps.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is a + 2*b -2. For a=7, m=5:7+10-2=15.\n\nSo perhaps for a >=b, the formula is (a + 2*b -2).\n\nFor a <b, perhaps the formula is (2*a +b -2).\n\nBut in the earlier example where a=2 and m=3, this formula gives 5, but the actual sum is 4. So there's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for a <b is (a +b) + (min(a,b) -2).\n\nFor a=2, m=3: 2+3 +2-2=5. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is min( a + 2*b, 2*a +b ) -2.\n\nFor a=2, m=3: min(2+6=8, 4+3=7) \u21927-2=5. Still not.\n\nSo, what is the correct formula for a <b?\n\nLet's think of another example where a <b.\n\nn=3, m=4.\n\nWhat's the minimal sum?\n\nMegan's path: (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4). Steps:5.\n\nBut she can use portals. For example, after reaching (1,1), she can teleport to (1,4) (cost 1). So her steps are 2 steps to (1,1), then teleport (1), total 3.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,4) (cost 1), then move to (3,4) (2 steps). Total 1+2=3.\n\nTotal sum 3+3=6.\n\nAccording to the formula 2a +b -2 for a=3, b=4: 6+4-2=8. Which is higher than 6.\n\nSo again, the formula doesn't hold.\n\nHmm. So what's the pattern here?\n\nIn the case where a=2, m=3, the minimal sum is 4.\n\nIn the case where a=3, m=4, sum is 6.\n\nWhat's the relation between a and m in these cases?\n\nIn the first case: 2+3=5. 5-1=4.\n\nIn the second: 3+4=7. 7-1=6.\n\nAh! So the sum is (a + m) + (a + m) - (max(a, m) +1) ?\n\nWait, for a=2, m=3: (2+3) + (2+3) - (3+1) =5+5-4=6. No, but the sum was 4.\n\nHmm. Alternative approach: when a < m, the minimal sum is a + m + a -1.\n\nFor a=2, m=3: 2+3+2-1=6. Which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, for a < m, the sum is a + m + (a-1).\n\nFor a=2, m=3: 2+3+1=6. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is a + m -2 + a.\n\nFor a=2, m=3: 2+3-2+2=5. No.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is (a-1)*2 + m-1 + a-1 + m-1.\n\nNo. For a=2, m=3: (1)*2 +2 +1 +2=2+2+3=7.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: for a < b, the minimal sum is (a + m) * 2 - (m - a) - 2.\n\nFor a=2, m=3: (5)*2 -1 -2=10-3=7. No.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is a + m + a -1.\n\nFor a=2, m=3: 2+3+2-1=6. No.\n\nThis is really frustrating.\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem in terms of the portals.\n\nMegan's path must be from (n,1) to (1,m). The minimal path length is (n-1)+(m-1) steps. But she can choose to take any path, which leaves portals along the way.\n\nThe optimal path is the one that allows both her and Stanley to teleport in a way that minimizes the total energy.\n\nThe portals can be used by both once each. Each teleport costs 1 unit.\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to his destination (n,m). He can teleport once.\n\nMegan's path: from (n,1) to her destination (1,m). She can teleport once.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of their individual steps plus 1 for each teleport.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the sum.\n\nSo for Stanley, his steps are:\n\nsteps from (1,1) to portal A + 1 (teleport) + steps from portal B to (n,m).\n\nFor Megan, steps from (n,1) to portal C + 1 (teleport) + steps from portal D to (1,m).\n\nBut since portals are only placed along Megan's path, portals A and B must be on her path. Also, the order in which Megan visits portals matters, because she can't teleport to a portal she hasn't visited yet.\n\nBut since time is not a factor, they can choose to teleport after Megan has visited all portals.\n\nSo, the optimal scenario is that Megan's path includes two portals that allow Stanley and Megan to teleport once each, thereby minimizing their steps.\n\nThe key is to find two portals (could be the same) that minimize the total steps.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's denote Megan's path as a set of cells P. For any two cells x and y in P, the total energy for Stanley and Megan is:\n\nStanley: steps from (1,1) to x + 1 (teleport) + steps from y to (n,m).\n\nMegan: steps from (n,1) to x + 1 (teleport) + steps from y to (1,m).\n\nWait, no. Megan can use a different portal for her teleport.\n\nAlternatively, Megan's path includes x and y. She can teleport from x to y. Stanley can teleport from x to y as well.\n\nBut this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, the best is for both to teleport once, using the same portal.\n\nFor example, both teleport from portal A to portal B.\n\nBut portal B must be visited by Megan after portal A.\n\nBut since time is not a factor, they can choose the order.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal is for both to use the same portal for their teleport.\n\nFor example, Stanley teleports from portal X to portal Y, and Megan teleports from portal Y to portal Z. Or any combination.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal sum is the same for both cases (a >=b and a <b) and can be written as (a + m) + (min(a,m) - 2).\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, based on the existing code's logic and the sample, perhaps the correct formula for a <b is 2*a +b -2.\n\nBut in the example where a=2, m=3, this gives 5, but the actual sum is 4.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in that example.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate for a=2, m=3.\n\nMegan's path:\n\nShe starts at (2,1). She needs to reach (1,3).\n\nHer minimal path is steps: (2-1) + (3-1) =1+2=3 steps. But if she uses a portal, she can save steps.\n\nFor example, she moves to (2,2) (1 step), then teleports to (1,3) (1 step). So her energy is 1+1=2.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can move to (1,2) (1 step), teleport to (2,2) (1), then move to (2,3) (1). His energy is 1+1+1=3. Sum is 2+3=5. Which matches the formula 2*a +b -2=5.\n\nBut earlier scenario where sum was 4 is not possible? Or is there a mistake in that scenario?\n\nAh, in the earlier scenario, I assumed that Megan can teleport from (2,1) to (1,3). But can she?\n\nMegan's path must create portals in every cell she visits. So she has to visit (2,1) first. Then, if she moves to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), those cells have portals. But if she chooses to take a different path that allows her to teleport earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if Megan takes the path (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). She leaves portals at all those cells. Then, she can teleport from (2,1) to (1,3) (cost 1), but she must first reach (2,1). But wait, she starts at (2,1). So she can immediately teleport from (2,1) to (1,3) (cost 1). That would save her steps. So her path would be: start at (2,1) (portal exists), teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then she's at (1,3) and needs to reach (1,3) which is already her destination. So her total energy is 0 steps + 1 teleport =1.\n\nStanley's path: starts at (1,1), teleport to (2,1) (cost 1), then move to (2,2), (2,3) (steps 2). Total energy: 1+2=3.\n\nSum is 1+3=4.\n\nBut this scenario is possible only if Megan's starting cell (2,1) has a portal. But according to the problem statement, Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So she starts at (2,1) and leaves a portal there. So she can teleport from (2,1) to any other portal she visits.\n\nWait, but if she teleports from (2,1) to (1,3), she must have already visited (1,3), which she hasn't. Because she starts at (2,1), and teleporting to (1,3) is possible only if she has already placed a portal there. So that's not possible.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. Megan can only use portals that she has already created. So, she can't teleport to a portal that she hasn't visited yet. So in the scenario where Megan starts at (2,1), she can teleport to any portal she has already visited. But if she hasn't visited (1,3) yet, she can't teleport there.\n\nSo in the previous scenario where Megan's path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3), she leaves portals in those cells. So during her journey, after visiting (1,3), she can teleport back to any previous portal.\n\nSo, when Megan is at (1,3), she can teleport back to (2,1), but that's not helpful. Or she can teleport to any other portal she has visited.\n\nBut the key point is that Megan can only use portals that she has already visited.\n\nSo in the example where Megan starts at (2,1), the only portal is (2,1). She can't teleport anywhere else until she visits other cells.\n\nSo, the scenario where Megan uses teleport from (2,1) to (1,3) is only possible if she has already visited (1,3), which she hasn't. So that scenario is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation for Megan's energy in the case of a=2, m=3 is:\n\nMegan must travel from (2,1) to (1,3).\n\nThe minimal steps she can take is 3 steps, but using portals.\n\nPossible path:\n\nMegan goes from (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (1 step). She can now teleport to (1,1). Then, she can move to (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) (2 steps). But using portals, she can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) (cost 1), but only if she has visited (1,3) already. Which she hasn't. So no.\n\nAlternatively, Megan's path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (1 step). Teleport to (1,1) (cost 0?), but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, she can move from (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) (3 steps). So energy 3.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,3) via teleport (cost 1), but only if (1,3) is a portal. Which is created when Megan arrives there. So Stanley can teleport to (1,3) after Megan has visited it. So Stanley's path is:\n\n (1,1) \u2192 (1,3) via teleport (cost 1), then move to (2,3) (1 step). Energy is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nMegan's path is 3 steps. Sum 3+2=5.\n\nSo the correct answer for a=2, m=3 is 5, which matches the formula 2*a +b -2=5.\n\nSo my earlier scenario was incorrect because I assumed that Megan could teleport to a portal she hasn't visited yet.\n\nThis changes everything. So for a <b, the formula is indeed 2*a +b -2.\n\nSo the missing code for the a <b case is to output 2*a +b -2.\n\nLet's test this with other examples.\n\nCase a=3, m=4. Formula 2*3+4-2=6+4-2=8.\n\nMegan's path: (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4). Steps:5.\n\nShe can use teleport once. For example, after moving to (1,1) (2 steps), she can teleport to (1,4) (cost 1). But she can't do that until she has visited (1,4). So no, she can't teleport to (1,4) until she has stepped there.\n\nAlternative path: she moves to (1,1) (2 steps), then moves to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) (3 steps). Steps 5. She can then teleport from (1,4) back to (1,1), but that's not helpful.\n\nSo her energy is 5 steps.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (3,4). He can use teleport.\n\nFor example, he can go from (1,1) to (3,1) (2 steps), then teleport to (1,4) (cost 1), then move to (3,4) (2 steps). Total steps: 2+1+2=5. But sum is 5+5=10. But according to the formula, the sum is 8. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm. What's wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct. How?\n\nStanley's path using teleport:\n\nHe can go from (1,1) to (1,4) via teleport (cost 1) if that portal exists. But Megan's path must have already visited (1,4). So Megan's path is (3,1) \u2192 ... \u2192 (1,4). Stanley can teleport to (1,4) after Megan has placed a portal there.\n\nSo Stanley's path:\n\n(1,1) to (1,4) via teleport (cost 1), then down to (3,4) (2 steps). Total 1+2=3.\n\nMegan's path: (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4). Steps 5. She can teleport once. For example, from (3,1) (starting point) to (1,4) (cost 1), but only after she has visited (1,4). So she must first walk there, then teleport back. But that doesn't save steps. So her energy is 5.\n\nSum 3+5=8. Which matches the formula 2*a +b -2=8.\n\nAh, I see. So in this case, Megan's path is 5 steps, but she can't use teleport to save steps because she hasn't visited the destination portal yet. So her energy is 5. Stanley uses teleport to save steps, energy is 3. Sum 8.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nThus, the correct formula for a <b is 2*a +b -2.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nSystem.out.println((2 * a + b) - 2);\n\nSo in the code's else if (a < b) block, we need to output (2*a +b -2).\n\nSo the missing code for the else if (a < b) case is:\n\nSystem.out.println((2 * a + b) - 2);"
