So those elements are the elements at positions (n - x) to (n -x + y -1) in the sorted array. So the sum is the sum from index (n -x) to (n -x + y - 1) in the sorted array. So if the prefix sum array is computed such that prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements (starting from index 0), then the sum of elements from a to b (inclusive) would be prefix[b+1] - prefix[a]. Wait, let's see. For example, if the prefix array is 0, a1, a1+a2, etc. Then, sum from index 0 to 2 is prefix[3] - prefix[0] = a1+a2+a3. So the general formula for sum from a to b (0-based indices) is prefix[b+1] - prefix[a]. So in the code, the code is written as:\n\nprefix is sorted, then for each i, prefix[i+1] += prefix[i]. Wait, that's not correct. Because if the array is sorted, and then the code builds a prefix sum array by adding each element cumulatively. For example, suppose the sorted prices are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The initial code after sorting would have prefix as [0,1,2,3,4,5] (assuming the loop was filled correctly). Then, the code does:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n   prefix[i+1] += prefix[i];\n}\n\nSo after this loop, the prefix array becomes:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =0 +1 =1\n\nprefix[2] =1 +2=3\n\nprefix[3] =3 +3=6\n\nprefix[4] =6 +4=10\n\nprefix[5] =10 +5=15\n\nSo prefix[i] now holds the sum of the first i elements. Then, for a query (x=3, y=2), the sum is the sum of the first y elements in the last x elements. So the last x elements are 3,4,5 (indices 2,3,4 in the sorted array, assuming 0-based). The first y elements in these are 3 and4. Sum is3+4=7. Which is prefix[2+2] - prefix[2] = prefix[4] - prefix[2] =10 -1=9? Wait, that can't be. Wait, the code in the problem currently computes:\n\nSystem.out.println((prefix[n-x + y] - prefix[n-x])); Wait, in the example where n=5, x=3, y=2, then n-x is 2. n-x +y is 4. So the code returns prefix[4] - prefix[2] =10 -3=7. Which is correct. Oh right, because prefix[2] is3 (sum of first 2 elements:1+2=3), and prefix[4] is10 (sum of first4 elements:1+2+3+4=10). The sum from index2 to3 is3+4=7. Which is 10-3=7. So the code works. So, the code's approach is to sort the array in ascending order, then compute the prefix sum.",

For example, the note says:\n\nIn the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8. But this array is [5,3,5], sorted in ascending order is [3,5,5]. When x=3, y=2. So the sum of the first two elements is 3+5=8. So the code would compute prefix[3-3 +2] - prefix[3-3] \u2192 prefix[2] - prefix[0] = (3+5) -0=8.

So the loop for (int i=0; i <n; i++) { ... } should read the prices into prefix[i]. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nprefix[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nBut since the prices can be up to 1e6, and multiplied by 2e5 items, the sum can be up to 2e11, which fits into a long. So the code uses a long array for prefix. So the correct code in the loop is:\n\nprefix[i] = sc.nextLong();\n\nYes. So the missing code is to read each price into prefix[i] as a long. That's the line that's missing in the loop. So the answer is to fill the loop with:\n\nprefix[i] = sc.nextLong(); That's the missing code.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum total value of free items when a customer buys x items and gets y cheapest for free. So, for each query, we need to compute the sum of the y smallest items when the customer buys x items. Wait, but how to efficiently compute that for multiple queries?\n\nHmm. The code provided has a sorted prefix array. Wait, the original array of prices must be sorted in non-decreasing order so that the cheapest items are first. Because when you choose x items, the maximum free value comes from selecting the y cheapest items from those x. But wait, no. Wait, the customer will buy at least x items. Wait, the problem says \"if a customer purchases at least x items, then the y cheapest are free.\" Oh wait, no. Wait the promotion is: when a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free. Wait, but for each query, x and y are given. So for each query, the customer will choose to buy exactly x items (since buying more than x doesn't help, because the y is fixed for the query). Wait, no. Because if the customer buys more than x, they can get y cheapest from all the items they bought. But the problem says, for the promotion, if a customer buys at least x, then the y cheapest of the purchased items are free. So to maximize the free sum, the customer will buy exactly x items (because buying more would require including more items, but the y is fixed. Wait, no: the y is part of the query. So for a query (x_i, y_i), the customer must buy at least x_i items, and then the y_i cheapest are free. So to maximize the sum of free items, the customer should buy exactly x_i items (since buying more would mean that the y_i is still the number of free items, but the cheapest y_i among all bought items. So if you have x_i+1 items, then the y_i cheapest would be even better? Wait, no. Because if you have more items, the sum of the y cheapest might be higher. Wait, for example: suppose you have items sorted as 1,2,3,4,5. If x_i is 3, y_i is 2. If the customer buys 3 items (the three largest: 3,4,5?), then the two cheapest are 3 and4. Sum is 7. But if they buy 4 items, like 2,3,4,5, then the two cheapest are 2 and3, sum is5. Which is better. Wait, but how does the customer choose which items to buy? The customer wants to maximize the sum of the free items. So the customer will choose the x items where the sum of the y smallest is maximum. Wait, no. Wait, the free sum is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchased set. So to maximize this sum, the customer would select x items such that the y cheapest among them are as large as possible. So the optimal approach is to take the x items with the highest prices, then the y cheapest among them are the first y of those x items. Wait, no. Wait, if you take x items with the highest prices, then when sorted, their y cheapest will be the first y in the sorted list. So the sum would be the sum of the first y items in the sorted list of those x. Wait, but that's not the case. Let me think: Suppose the items are sorted in ascending order. So the cheapest is first. So if the customer selects the x largest items (the last x in the sorted array), then when sorted, those x items are in order. The y cheapest among them would be the first y of those x. But since the entire array is sorted in ascending order, the x largest items are the last x. So when sorted, they are already in ascending order. So the y cheapest among them are the first y of those x, which would be the elements from (n - x) to (n -x + y -1) indices. Wait, maybe the original array is sorted in ascending order. Then, for the x items selected, which are the largest x (so the last x elements in the sorted array), their y cheapest would be the first y elements in those x. So the sum would be sum from index (n-x) to (n-x + y -1). \n\nSo the plan is: \n\n1. Sort the array in ascending order.\n\n2. Precompute the prefix sums so that sum from index a to b can be computed quickly.\n\n3. For each query (x, y), the maximum free sum is the sum of the first y elements in the sorted list's subset of x elements, but those x elements are the largest possible (since those have the highest y elements when sorted). Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the y cheapest in the x elements is the sum of the first y elements in the sorted x elements. But since the entire array is sorted, the x elements can be any consecutive subset. Wait, no. Because the customer can choose any x elements. So the optimal choice is to pick the x elements where their y smallest elements sum to the maximum possible. So how to select x elements where the sum of their y smallest is as large as possible? \n\nWait, for example, the array is sorted in ascending order. Let's say the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. For x=3, y=2. The best choice is to pick [3,4,5]. The two cheapest are 3 and4. Sum is7. Alternatively, if you pick [2,3,4], sum of two cheapest is5. So yes, choosing the largest x elements gives the maximum sum. So the optimal strategy is to select the x largest elements. Then, the sum of the y cheapest in those x elements is the sum of the first y elements in the sorted list of those x elements (since the entire array is sorted, the x elements are already in order). \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Sort the array in ascending order.\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array, where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements.\n\nBut wait, the code in the problem has a prefix array initialized to n+1 elements. Then, after reading the elements, they are sorted. Then, the code does a loop where prefix[i+1] += prefix[i], which suggests that the code is building the prefix sum array. Wait, but in the given code, the initial loop is filling the prefix array for i from 0 to n-1, but after that, the code sorts the prefix array. Wait, that can't be right. Because the initial code seems to have a bug here.\n\nWait, the problem code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nThen, Arrays.sort(prefix);\n\nWait, but the prefix array is initialized as a new long[n+1], which starts with all zeros. Then, the loop is for i from 0 to n-1. So, for example, the code is intended to read the prices into the prefix array (but only the first n elements). Then, sort the prefix array, but that's probably not correct.\n\nWait, the correct approach is to sort the prices in ascending order, then compute the prefix sum. For example, the code should read the prices into an array, sort that array in ascending order, then compute the prefix sum where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements (i starts from 0). Then, for a query (x, y), the sum is the sum of the first y elements in the first x elements. Wait, no. Wait, the customer selects x elements. The best is to select the x largest elements (so the last x elements in the sorted array). Then, the y cheapest in those x are the first y of those x elements (since the x elements are sorted in ascending order). So those elements are the elements at positions (n - x) to (n -x + y -1) in the sorted array.\n\nSo the sum is the sum from index (n -x) to (n -x + y - 1) in the sorted array. So if the prefix sum array is computed such that prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements (starting from index 0), then the sum of elements from a to b (inclusive) would be prefix[b+1] - prefix[a].\n\nWait, let's see. For example, if the prefix array is 0, a1, a1+a2, etc. Then, sum from index 0 to 2 is prefix[3] - prefix[0] = a1+a2+a3. So the general formula for sum from a to b (0-based indices) is prefix[b+1] - prefix[a].\n\nSo in the code, the code is written as:\n\nprefix is sorted, then for each i, prefix[i+1] += prefix[i]. Wait, that's not correct. Because if the array is sorted, and then the code builds a prefix sum array by adding each element cumulatively. For example, suppose the sorted prices are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The initial code after sorting would have prefix as [0,1,2,3,4,5] (assuming the loop was filled correctly). Then, the code does:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n   prefix[i+1] += prefix[i];\n}\n\nSo after this loop, the prefix array becomes:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =0 +1 =1\n\nprefix[2] =1 +2=3\n\nprefix[3] =3 +3=6\n\nprefix[4] =6 +4=10\n\nprefix[5] =10 +5=15\n\nSo prefix[i] now holds the sum of the first i elements. Then, for a query (x=3, y=2), the sum is the sum of the first y elements in the last x elements. So the last x elements are 3,4,5 (indices 2,3,4 in the sorted array, assuming 0-based). The first y elements in these are 3 and4. Sum is3+4=7. Which is prefix[2+2] - prefix[2] = prefix[4] - prefix[2] =10 -1=9? Wait, that can't be. Wait, the code in the problem currently computes:\n\nSystem.out.println((prefix[n-x + y] - prefix[n-x]));\n\nWait, in the example where n=5, x=3, y=2, then n-x is 2. n-x +y is 4. So the code returns prefix[4] - prefix[2] =10 -3=7. Which is correct. Oh right, because prefix[2] is3 (sum of first 2 elements:1+2=3), and prefix[4] is10 (sum of first4 elements:1+2+3+4=10). The sum from index2 to3 is3+4=7. Which is 10-3=7. So the code works.\n\nSo, the code's approach is to sort the array in ascending order, then compute the prefix sum. Then, for each query, the sum is prefix[n-x + y] - prefix[n-x].\n\nBut in the given code, the prefix array is being sorted. Wait, no. Wait, the code reads the prices into the prefix array, then sorts the entire prefix array, including the initial zero. Let's see:\n\nThe code initializes prefix as new long[n+1]. So for n=5, the array is 6 elements long.\n\nThen, in the loop for i from 0 to n-1 (5 elements?), the code is supposed to read the input into prefix[i]. So the first 5 elements (indices 0-4) are filled with the prices, and index5 remains 0. Then, Arrays.sort(prefix) would sort all 6 elements, including the 0 at index5. So after sorting, the array will be in ascending order, but with a zero at some position. Wait, that can't be right. Because that zero is part of the initial array (the prefix array was initialized to size n+1, which for n=5, is 6 elements: all zero initially). Then, in the loop, the code is supposed to read the prices into the first n elements (indices 0 to4). But that's not correct. Because after the loop, the code sorts the entire prefix array (6 elements), including the zero. So the sorted array will have the zero as the first element, followed by the sorted prices. But this is wrong. Because the original code's setup is incorrect. The code as given has a bug here.\n\nAh, right. Because the code initializes the prefix array as size n+1, but the loop is for i from 0 to n-1. So for n items, the code is reading n elements into the first n elements of the prefix array (indices 0 to n-1). Then, the code sorts the entire prefix array (which has n+1 elements), which includes the 0 at index n. So after sorting, the prefix array starts with 0, followed by the sorted prices. But that's not correct. Because the prices are supposed to be sorted, but the code is adding a zero into the array and then sorting. So the code is flawed here.\n\nSo the correct approach is to read the prices into an array, sort them in ascending order, then compute the prefix sum array. The prefix sum array should start with 0, followed by the sum of the first element, then sum of first two, etc. So the code's initial steps are wrong. Let's see the correct code steps:\n\nThe correct code steps are:\n\nRead the prices into an array.\n\nSort the array in ascending order.\n\nCompute a prefix sum array where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = prices[0], prefix[2] = prices[0] + prices[1], etc. So prefix has length n+1.\n\nThen, for a query (x, y), the answer is prefix[n - x + y] - prefix[n -x].\n\nBut in the given code, after reading into prefix, the code sorts the entire prefix array, including the initial zero. Which is wrong. Because the initial zero (from the prefix array) is not part of the prices. So how to fix this?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nIn the loop for (int i=0; i <n; i++) { /* TODO */ }\n\nThis is where the prices are read. So for the first n elements (indices 0 to n-1), we read the prices. Then, the code sorts the entire prefix array, which includes the initial zeros (since the array was initialized with n+1 elements, all zeros). Wait, no. Wait, when you create a new long[n+1], all elements are zero. Then, the loop runs from 0 to n-1 (i <n), and reads n elements into prefix[0] to prefix[n-1]. Then, prefix[n] is still 0. Then, Arrays.sort(prefix) sorts all elements, including the zero at index n, which was part of the initial array. So after sorting, the prefix array starts with the zeros. For example, if the prices are [5,3,5], then the initial prefix array after reading is [5,3,5,0]. Then, after sorting, it becomes [0,3,5,5]. Then, the code computes prefix[i+1] += prefix[i], which would create the prefix sum.\n\nBut that's incorrect. Because the 0 is included in the sorted array, which is not part of the original prices. So the code is wrong here.\n\nSo the correct approach is to read the prices into a separate array, sort that array, then compute the prefix sum array. But the given code tries to read into the prefix array directly, which includes an extra zero, leading to incorrect sorting.\n\nSo the missing code in the loop should read the prices into the prefix array, but starting from index 0. Then, after the loop, the code sorts the first n elements of the prefix array, not the entire array. But the code has Arrays.sort(prefix), which sorts the entire array (n+1 elements). So this is incorrect.\n\nWait, how can we fix this? The correct code would read the prices into an array, sort them in ascending order, then compute the prefix sum.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nRead the n prices into an array (say, prices array).\n\nSort the prices array in ascending order.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array, which starts with 0, then prices[0], then prices[0]+prices[1], etc.\n\nBut the given code's structure is different. It uses the prefix array to store the prices and then sorts it. So the code's initial steps are:\n\nRead n prices into the prefix array (from index 0 to n-1).\n\nSort the entire prefix array (including index n, which was 0). So this is wrong.\n\nTo fix this, the loop should read the prices into the prefix array, but only the first n elements. Then, the code should sort the prefix array from index 0 to n-1. But Java's Arrays.sort() can take a range. So perhaps after the loop, the code should sort the prefix array from 0 to n-1. Then, the code can compute the prefix sum.\n\nBut in the current code, after reading the prices into prefix[0..n-1], the code sorts the entire prefix array (including the 0 at index n). So that's wrong.\n\nSo the correct code would have:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n   prefix[i] = sc.nextLong();\n}\n\nThen, Arrays.sort(prefix, 0, n); // sorts the first n elements.\n\nThen, compute the prefix sum. But the code currently sorts the entire prefix array, which includes the 0 at index n.\n\nSo the missing code in the loop is to read the prices into the prefix array. Then, after the loop, sort the first n elements of the prefix array, then build the prefix sum.\n\nSo in the code provided, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <n; i++) {\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nThe missing code here is reading the input into prefix[i], but prefix is of type long. So each price is read as a long.\n\nSo the code for the loop should be:\n\nprefix[i] = sc.nextLong();\n\nThen, after this loop, the code sorts the entire array (including the prefix[n] which is 0). Which is wrong. So the code's sorting is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code's first error is in the sorting step. The code should sort the first n elements of the prefix array. So the correct code is to call:\n\nArrays.sort(prefix, 0, n);\n\nBut in the given code, it's calling Arrays.sort(prefix), which sorts the entire array (n+1 elements). This is a bug.\n\nBut the user's code is provided with this line, so we have to work with that. Wait, but how? Because according to the problem statement, the code is given, and we need to fill in the missing parts. The code's initial part reads n and q, then initializes the prefix array of size n+1. Then, the loop for i in 0..n-1 (so n elements) and then sorts the entire prefix array, which includes the n+1 elements. This is incorrect.\n\nBut the code provided in the problem is wrong. So the user is supposed to fill in the missing code such that the program works correctly.\n\nSo the correct approach for the missing code is to read the prices into the prefix array, and then sort the first n elements, but the given code uses Arrays.sort(prefix), which sorts all n+1 elements (including the 0 in the last position). This is a mistake, but the code is given, and we need to fill in the missing parts.\n\nWait, but how can the code work? Because if the prefix array after the loop has the prices in the first n elements, and then a zero at the end, then sorting the entire array will place the zero in the first position, and the sorted prices after that. Then, when building the prefix sum array, the first element (zero) is added. Which is not correct.\n\nBut according to the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n5 3\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nQueries:\n\n3 2 \u2192 output 8 (3+5?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the first sample query, the customer buys 3 items. The two cheapest among them are free. According to the note, the customer buys items worth 5,3,5. Wait, but that's in the note of the problem. Oh, the note might be part of a different example.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input given in the problem's note is different. For example, the note says:\n\nIn the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8.\n\nBut this array is [5,3,5], sorted in ascending order is [3,5,5]. When x=3, y=2. So the sum of the first two elements is 3+5=8. So the code would compute prefix[3-3 +2] - prefix[3-3] \u2192 prefix[2] - prefix[0] = (3+5) -0=8.\n\nBut according to the code's steps:\n\nAfter reading the prices into the prefix array (prefix[0]=5, prefix[1]=3, prefix[2]=5, prefix[3]=0 (since n=3, q= ... but maybe the sample input in the note is different. \n\nBut regardless, the code's current approach is incorrect. Because the code sorts the entire prefix array, including the zero. So to make this code work, the missing code must be that the prices are stored in the prefix array from index 1 to n, and index 0 remains 0. Then, after sorting the entire array, the zero is at the beginning, followed by the sorted prices. Then, the prefix sum can be computed correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is intended to have the prefix array start with 0, then the sorted prices. For example, after sorting, the prefix array has 0 in the first position, then the sorted prices. Then, the code computes the prefix sums by adding each element to the next.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nOriginal code after reading:\n\nprefix[0] = price 1?\n\nWait, no. Let's think of the sample input in the note.\n\nSample note: first query is x=3, y=2. The items purchased are 5,3,5. When sorted, they are 3,5,5. The two cheapest sum to 8.\n\nSo if the code reads these three elements into prefix[0], prefix[1], prefix[2]. Then, the code sorts the entire prefix array (including the zero at index3). So after sorting, the array becomes [0,3,5,5]. Then, the code does the loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n   prefix[i+1] += prefix[i];\n}\n\nSo the loop runs for i=0,1,2 (n=3).\n\ni=0: prefix[1] += prefix[0] \u2192 3 +0 =3.\n\nprefix array becomes [0,3,5,5].\n\ni=1: prefix[2] +=3 \u21925+3=8. prefix[2] is now8.\n\ni=2: prefix[3] +=8 \u21925+8=13. prefix[3] is13.\n\nSo the prefix array after the loop is [0,3,8,13].\n\nThen, for the query x=3, y=2:\n\nn=3, x=3, y=2.\n\nn-x =0. n-x +y=2.\n\nSo the code computes prefix[2] - prefix[0] =8-0=8. Which is correct.\n\nAh, so the code works. How?\n\nBecause after sorting the entire prefix array (including the zero), the zero is at the beginning, followed by the sorted prices. Then, the loop adds the prefix[i] to prefix[i+1], building the prefix sum array.\n\nWait, in this case, after sorting, the array is [0,3,5,5]. Then, the code runs the loop for i from0 ton-1 (i<3):\n\ni=0: prefix[1] += prefix[0] \u21923+0=3. Now prefix[1] is3.\n\ni=1: prefix[2] +=3 \u21925+3=8. prefix[2] is8.\n\ni=2: prefix[3] +=8 \u21925+8=13. prefix[3] is13.\n\nSo the prefix array becomes [0,3,8,13].\n\nThen, the sum for the query is prefix[0+2] - prefix[0] \u21928-0=8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo in this approach, the zero is part of the sorted array and is placed at the first position. Then, the loop builds the prefix sum starting from index 0.\n\nSo the code works because the initial code after sorting has the zero in the first position, followed by the sorted prices.\n\nSo the initial code's approach is to:\n\n1. Read the prices into the prefix array (prefix[0] to prefix[n-1]).\n\n2. Sort the entire prefix array (n+1 elements), which includes the zero at indexn (which was initially part of the array). So after sorting, the zero is at index0, and the prices are sorted from index1 ton.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you sort the entire array, including the zero at indexn, which was part of the initial array (after the loop, the first n elements are the prices, and the last element is zero). For example, if the initial prices are [5,3,5], then the prefix array after the loop is [5,3,5,0]. When sorted, it becomes [0,3,5,5]. Then, the code builds the prefix sum array:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =0 +3=3\n\nprefix[2] =3 +5=8\n\nprefix[3] =8 +5=13\n\nSo for a query x=3, y=2: n-x=0, y=2. So prefix[0+2] - prefix[0] =8-0=8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works as intended. Because the initial loop reads the prices into the first n elements of the prefix array. Then, the entire array is sorted, which includes the zero at the end. Then, the code builds a prefix sum array where the sum is computed including the zero. But in reality, the zero is part of the sorted array's first element, and the rest are the prices sorted.\n\nSo the code is correct. Because the code's approach is to have the sorted array start with zero, followed by the sorted prices. Then, the prefix sum is built such that prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements. But since the first element is zero, the sum starts at zero. So the sum from index a to b is computed correctly.\n\nSo in the code, the missing part is reading the prices into the prefix array. So the loop for (int i=0; i <n; i++) { ... } should read the prices into prefix[i]. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nprefix[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nBut since the prices can be up to 1e6, and multiplied by 2e5 items, the sum can be up to 2e11, which fits into a long. So the code uses a long array for prefix. So the correct code in the loop is:\n\nprefix[i] = sc.nextLong();\n\nYes.\n\nSo the missing code is to read each price into prefix[i] as a long. That's the line that's missing in the loop.\n\nSo the answer is to fill the loop with:\n\nprefix[i] = sc.nextLong();\n\nThat's the missing code. Because the code reads the prices into the prefix array, sorts the entire array (including the zero), which moves the zero to the front. Then, the prefix sum is built correctly. So the code works."
