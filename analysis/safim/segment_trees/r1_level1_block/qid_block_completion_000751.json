The code provided has some missing parts, specifically in the else if conditions and the corresponding output. Looking at the existing code in the Solve method:\n\nThe first condition checks if n is >=1900, which is Division 1. Then the else if checks if n is between 1600 and 1899 inclusive, which is Division 2. Then the next else if is for when n is between 1400 and 1599, which should be Division 3. But the code there has a comment saying TODO. So in that else if block, the correct output should be \"Division 3\". So the missing line there is to write that. The current code has the condition n <=1599 && 1400 <=n, which correctly covers the Division 3 case. So in that block, we just need to output \"Division 3\". So the missing code would be adding Console. WriteLine(\"Division 3\"); in that else if block. Wait, let's check the division definitions again: Division 1: 1900 <= rating\nDivision 2: 1600 <= rating <=1899\nDivision 3: 1400 <= rating <=1599\nDivision 4: rating <=1399 Yes. So the else if (n <=1599 && 1400 <=n) captures exactly the Division 3 scenario. So in that case, we need to output Division 3.",
