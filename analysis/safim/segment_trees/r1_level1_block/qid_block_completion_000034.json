Let me read through the code again and see where the missing parts are. Looking at the code structure, there's a TODO comment in the part where (s/k) equals b. The code is supposed to print the array elements here. The for loop runs from i=0 to n-2 (since it's n-1 times), and then prints s. But wait, if n is 1, then this loop doesn't execute, and s is printed, which is correct. But if n is larger than 1, the loop needs to output n-1 zeros, and then the last element would be s.
