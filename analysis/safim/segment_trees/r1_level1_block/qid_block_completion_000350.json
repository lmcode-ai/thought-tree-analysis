        "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be made using n blocks. Each block's length is ceil(i/2) for the i-th block. The height of each is 1, so the square's area is side^2. The total area of the blocks used must be at least side^2. So the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that the sum of the first k block lengths (for some k <=n) is >= s\u00b2. But since we can choose any subset of blocks, the sum of all possible blocks up to n gives the maximum possible area. Wait, no. Because the order of the blocks might not matter. Wait, the blocks are numbered from 1 to n. Each block's length is ceil(i/2). So the sum of all the blocks' lengths is the sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2). So the total area available is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). The maximum square possible would have s such that s\u00b2 is <= this sum. So the problem reduces to compute s_max where s_max is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= total_sum, and total_sum is the sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n. So the first step is to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Then find the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum. So the question is, how to compute sum = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's compute this sum. For even i and odd i.\n\nFor i=1: ceil(1/2) = 1.\n\ni=2: 1.\n\ni=3: 2.\n\ni=4: 2.\n\ni=5:3, etc. So for even numbers: i=2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2) = k.\n\nFor odd numbers: i=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2) = k. So the sum can be calculated by considering how many even and odd terms there are. Wait, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nIf i is odd: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. If i is even: ceil(i/2) = i/2. So sum can be split into sum of odd i and even i.\n\nLet's split n into even and odd terms. Suppose n is even. Then there are n/2 even numbers and n/2 odd numbers. Wait, no. For example, if n=4: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd),4 (even). So even count is 2, odd count is 2. If n=5: even count 2 (2,4), odd count 3 (1,3,5). So for general n:\n\nnumber of even terms: floor(n/2) = (n)//2.\n\nnumber of odd terms: ceil(n/2) = (n+1)//2. Now, the sum for even terms: each even term is i/2. So sum_evens = sum_{k=1 to m} (2k)/2 = sum k from 1 to m = m(m+1)/2, where m is the number of even terms (since even terms are 2,4,...,2m). Wait, but m is the number of even terms. So for even terms up to n, the count is m = floor(n/2). Because for example, n=4, floor(4/2)=2 terms: 2 and4. So m = floor(n/2). Sum_evens = sum of i/2 where i is even and <=n. Since i =2k for k from 1 to m. So sum_evens = sum_{k=1 to m} (2k)/2 = sum_{k=1 to m} k = m(m+1)/2.\n\nSum_odds: for each odd term i, which is 1,3,5,..., up to n if n is odd. So i=2k-1 for k from 1 to p. Then ceil(i/2) = k. So sum_odds = sum_{k=1 to p} k, where p is the number of odd terms. The number of odd terms is ceil(n/2). For example, n=5: ceil(5/2)=3. Which is correct (1,3,5). So sum_odds = p(p+1)/2, where p = ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2 if n is odd, or n/2 if n is even? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf n is even, say 4. Then the number of odd terms is 2 (1,3). Which is n/2. (4/2=2). So ceil(4/2) = 2. So yes. If n is 5, then (5+1)/2 = 3. So yes. So p = ceil(n/2) = (n +1)//2 (integer division). So sum_odds = p*(p +1)/2. Wait, let's test for n=5:\n\np = (5+1)//2 =3. So sum_odds = 3*4/2=6. Let's check:\n\ni=1: ceil(1/2)=1.\n\ni=3: ceil(3/2)=2.\n\ni=5: ceil(5/2)=3. Sum:1+2+3=6. Correct. For n=4, p=(4+1)//2 =2 (since (4+1)/2=2.5, floor is 2). sum_odds =2*3/2=3. i=1:1, i=3:2. Sum 3. Correct. So sum_total = sum_evens + sum_odds = [m*(m+1)/2] + [p*(p+1)/2], where m = floor(n/2), p=ceil(n/2) = (n+1)//2. But m is n//2, and p is (n+1)//2. Because for even n, (n+1)//2 is n/2 + 0.5, but integer division truncates. Wait, let's see:\n\nn=4: even. n//2=2. (n+1)//2 = 5//2=2 (since 5/2 is 2.5, integer division truncates to 2). So p=2. But in that case, p is same as m. So sum_evens = m(m+1)/2, sum_odds= p(p+1)/2. So sum_total is (2*3/2)+(2*3/2) =3 +3=6. For n=4:\n\nsum of even terms (2 and4) \u2192 1 +2 =3. sum of odds (1 and3) \u21921 +2=3. Total 6. Correct. So the formula works. So the sum is:\n\nsum_total = [m*(m+1)/2] + [p*(p+1)/2], where m = n//2, p=(n+1)//2. But m + p = (n//2) + ( (n+1)//2 ) = for even n: (n/2) + (n/2) =n. For odd n: (n-1)/2 + (n+1)/2 = (n-1 +n+1)/2 = (2n)/2 =n. So m +p =n.\n\nBut in terms of m and p, the sum can be written as sum_total = (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2.",

But since n can be up to 1e9, and t up to 1e4, the code must compute sum_total quickly, then compute s via some efficient method. So the steps:\n\nFor each n:\n\n1.

So the key is to compute s as the integer square root of sum_total. But how to compute integer square root in C++? Well, for numbers up to 1e9, the sum can be up to:\n\nLet's compute maximum sum for n=1e9. m = 5e8, p=5e8+1 (since n is even, n=1e9 is even? Wait 1e9 is even. So m=5e8, p=5e8 (since (1e9+1)/2=500,000,000.5, integer division truncates to 5e8. So p=5e8. sum_evens = 5e8*(5e8+1)/2.\n\nsum_odds =5e8*(5e8+1)/2. sum_total = 2 * (5e8 * (5e8+1)/2) ) = 5e8 * (5e8+1). So sum_total is 5e8*(5e8+1) \u2248 2.5e17. The square root of that is sqrt(2.5e17) \u2248 5e8. So s is around 5e8. But for n up to 1e9, sum_total can be up to about 5e8*5e8=2.5e17, so s is up to about 7e8 (since for n=1e9, sum is 5e8*(5e8+1) = (5e8)^2 +5e8 \u2192 square root is 5e8 + 0.5 (approx), but since it's not a perfect square, s is floor(sqrt(sum_total)). So to compute s, we can use the sqrt function, but for very large numbers, floating point may not be precise. So perhaps use binary search to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total.",

But given that sum_total can be up to 5e17, binary search would be feasible as log2(5e17) is about 58 steps, which is acceptable for 1e4 test cases. So the code will need to compute sum_total as m(m+1)/2 + p(p+1)/2, where m = n//2, p = (n+1)//2. Then find s = floor( sqrt(sum_total) ). Wait, but how to compute sum_total? Wait, sum_evens = m(m+1)/2. sum_odds = p(p+1)/2. So sum_total is [ m(m+1) + p(p+1) ] / 2. But m and p are integers, so sum_total could be a fraction? Let's see:\n\nm and p are such that m +p =n. If n is even, then m =n/2, p =n/2. So sum_evens + sum_odds = [ (n/2)(n/2+1) + (n/2)(n/2 +1) ] / 2 \u2192 [ 2 * (n/2 (n/2+1) ) ] /2 \u2192 (n/2 (n/2+1) ). So sum_total is n/2 (n/2 +1). Wait, no. Let's compute for even n:\n\nm =n/2. p = (n+1)//2. For even n, n+1 is odd. So (n+1)/2 = n/2 + 0.5, but integer division truncates. So p = (n+1)//2 = n/2. Wait, for even n, like n=4:\n\nn=4 even. m=4//2=2. p=(4 +1)//2=5//2=2. So sum_evens =2*3/2=3. sum_odds=2*3/2=3. sum_total=6. Which is (2*3)+(2*3) / 2 \u2192 (6+6)/2=6. So yes. But 4/2*(4/2 +1) = 2*(3)=6. So sum_total is indeed equal to m*(m+1) + p*(p+1)/2? Wait, in this case, m and p are 2 and 2.\n\nsum_evens is m(m+1)/2 = 2*3/2=3. sum_odds is p(p+1)/2 = 2*3/2=3. sum_total=6. But for even n, m and p are equal. So sum_total = 2 * sum_evens = m(m+1). But for even n, sum_total is (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2 \u2192 since m =p, that's (2 m(m+1))/2 \u2192 m(m+1). So sum_total is m(m+1) for even n.\n\nWait, but when n is even, m is n/2. So sum_total = (n/2) * (n/2 +1). For example, n=4: 2*3=6. Correct. For even n, sum_total = (n/2) * (n/2 +1). For odd n, let's take n=5. m=5//2=2. p=(5+1)//2=3. sum_evens =2*3/2=3. sum_odds=3*4/2=6.\n\nsum_total=3+6=9. But (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2 = (2*3 +3*4)/2 = (6 +12)/2=18/2=9. Correct. Now, sum_total can be written as:\n\nsum_total = [m(m+1) + p(p+1)] / 2. But m + p = n.\n\nWait, m = floor(n/2), p = ceil(n/2). So m + p =n.\n\nSo for even n, m =p= n/2. For odd n, m = (n-1)/2, p = (n+1)/2. So sum_total is (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2. But perhaps there's a way to simplify this expression. Let's substitute m = n//2, p = (n+1)//2. But for even n:\n\nn=2k:\n\nm =k.\n\np= (2k +1)//2 =k.\n\nsum_total = k(k+1) + k(k+1) / 2 \u2192 (2k(k+1))/2 =k(k+1). For even n, sum_total = k(k+1) = (n/2) (n/2 +1). For odd n:\n\nn=2k+1.\n\nm= (2k+1)//2 =k.\n\np= (2k+2)//2 =k+1.\n\nsum_evens =k(k+1)/2.\n\nsum_odds = (k+1)(k+2)/2. sum_total = [k(k+1) + (k+1)(k+2)] /2 \u2192 (k+1)[k +k +2] /2 \u2192 (k+1)(2k+2)/2 \u2192 (k+1)(k+1) \u2192 (k+1)^2. But for odd n=2k+1, sum_total is (k+1)^2. Wait, let's check n=5:\n\nk= (5-1)/2=2.\n\nsum_total= (2+1)^2=9. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nm=1, p=2.\n\nsum_evens=1*2/2=1. sum_odds=2*3/2=3. sum_total=4. (1+3=4). Which is (1+1+1)^2= (2+1)^2? Wait for n=3, k= (3-1)/2=1. sum_total is (1+1)^2=4. Correct. Wait, so for odd n=2k+1, sum_total is (k+1)^2. So for even n=2k: sum_total is k(k+1). For odd n=2k+1: sum_total is (k+1)^2. So perhaps we can find a formula based on whether n is even or odd. Alternatively, perhaps find a general formula for sum_total. Let's see:\n\nIf n is even:\n\nsum_total = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4. If n is odd:\n\nsum_total = ((n+1)/2)^2 \u2192 (n+1)^2 /4. But how to generalize this. Alternatively, sum_total can be written as:\n\nsum_total = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ). Wait, let's check:\n\nFor even n=4:\n\n(n+1)^2 =25. 25/4=6.25. floor(6.25)=6. Which matches sum_total=6. For odd n=5: (5+1)^2=36. 36/4=9. floor(9)=9. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)^2=16/4=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3)^2=9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor 2. sum_total is 2*(3)/2 \u2192 3. Wait, no. Wait n=2 is even. sum_total is (2/2)*(2/2 +1)=1*2=2. But according to floor( (2+1)^2 /4 )=9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor is 2. Which matches. n=1: (1+1)^2=4/4=1 \u2192 sum_total is 1. Correct. Yes! So sum_total is equal to floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ). Wait, let's test for even n=6. sum_total for even 6:\n\nm=3, sum_evens=3*4/2=6.\n\nsum_odds: p=(6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3.\n\nsum_odds=3*4/2=6. sum_total=12. According to (6+1)^2 /4=49/4=12.25 \u2192 floor is 12. Correct. Another example: even n=2. sum_total= (2/2)*(2/2 +1) =1*2=2. floor( (2+1)^2 /4 ) =9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor 2. Correct. Yes! So sum_total can be computed as floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ). Wow, that's a neat formula. So regardless of n being even or odd, sum_total is (n+1)^2//4 (integer division). So the sum_total is equal to ( (n+1)^2 ) //4. Wait, because for even n:\n\n(n+1)^2 = (2k+1)^2 =4k\u00b2 +4k +1 \u2192 divided by4 gives k\u00b2 +k + 0.25. The integer division (floor) would be k\u00b2 +k \u2192 which is k(k+1), which matches the even case. For odd n=2k+1: (n+1)^2 = (2k+2)^2=4(k+1)^2 \u2192 divided by4 gives (k+1)^2, which is integer. So for odd n, sum_total is (k+1)^2. Thus, sum_total = ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) //4. So now, the code can compute sum_total as ((n+1) * (n+1)) /4, but using integer division. Wait, but in C++, if we write (n+1)*(n+1)/4, but using integer division, does that work? Yes. Because (n+1) is integer, so (n+1)^2 is computed as (n+1)*(n+1), then divided by4 using integer division. So for example, when n=4 (even), (4+1)^2=25 \u2192 25/4=6.25 \u2192 integer division gives 6, which is correct. n=5 \u21926^2=36/4=9 \u2192 correct. So sum_total can be written as ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4. So that's a much simpler way to compute sum_total. Thus, the code for sum_total is simply ((n +1) * (n+1)) /4. Wait, but wait: Wait, (n+1)^2 /4 can be written as ((n+1)/2)^2, but for integer division. But in code, how is this handled? For example, when n is even:\n\nn=4 \u21925^2=25. 25/4=6.25, but integer division (25 /4) is 6. Yes. So in code, sum_total is ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4. But in C++, for integer variables, (n+1) is a long long, and multiplied by (n+1) gives a long long, then divided by4. Yes. So in code:\n\nlong long sum_total = ( (n +1) * (n+1) ) /4; But wait, when n is up to 1e9, (n+1) is 1e9+1. (n+1)^2 is 1e18+2e9+1, which is 1.002e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e9, (n+1)^2 can be up to (1e9+1)^2 =1e18 + 2e9 +1 \u22481e18, which is within the range of a 64-bit integer (since 2^63 is about 9e18). So using long long is okay. So sum_total is (n+1)*(n+1)/4. Thus, the code can compute sum_total as ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4. Once sum_total is computed, the problem is to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total. So the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of sum_total.",

But for numbers up to 1e18, binary search would be feasible. Alternatively, compute sqrtl(sum_total) as a long double and floor it, but check if (s+1)^2 is <= sum_total.

For sum_total up to 1e18, double has 52 bits of precision, which is enough for integers up to 2^52 (about 4e15), but sum_total can be up to (1e9+1)^2/4 = 2.5e17. So for numbers larger than 2^52 (4.5e15), the sqrt function may not represent them accurately, leading to possible errors. So using sqrt in this case may not be precise.

Which is correct. Because sum_total is6. The maximum square is 2x2=4. But wait, in the sample input n=5, sum_total is9, s=3. Wait, for n=4, sum_total is6. So the maximum s is 2 (since 2^2=4 \u22646, 3^2=9>6). So the answer is 2. So the code would output 2. But according to the formula sum_total = (n+1)^2//4. For n=4: sum_total is (5*5)/4=25/4=6. So binary search would find s=2. Yes. Thus, the code seems correct. Now, code implementation. The code must read t test cases. For each, read n, compute sum_total as ((n+1)*(n+1))/4, then compute s via binary search. But for n up to 1e9, sum_total is up to ((1e9+1)^2)/4 \u2248 (1e18)/4=2.5e17. So binary search would take around 30 steps per test case. For t=1e4, 3e5 steps, which is manageable. So the code: Inside solve function:\n\nlong long n;\n\ncin >> n;\n\nlong long sum_total = ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4;\n\nlong long low=0, high=1e9+1;\n\nlong long s=0;\n\nwhile (low <= high) {\n\n    long long mid = (low + high)/2; if (mid * mid <= sum_total) {\n\n        s=mid;\n\n        low=mid+1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        high=mid-1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\ncout << s << endl;\n\nWait, but (n+1) can be up to 1e9+1. So (n+1) is 1e9+1. (n+1)*(n+1) is (1e9+1)^2 which is 1e18+2e9+1. So when we divide by4, sum_total is 250000000500000000.25 \u2192 but integer division truncates to 250000000500000000. Then, binary search would find s = sqrt(250000000500000000) \u2192 which is 500,000,000.25 \u2192 floor is 500,000,000. So s^2=250000000000000000, which is less than sum_total. But sum_total is 250000000500000000. So s is 500,000,000. But is there a larger s where s^2 <= sum_total? Let's see:\n\n500,000,000^2 =250,000,000,000,000,000.\n\n500,000,000^2 + 500,000,000 = 250,000,000,500,000,000. Which is exactly sum_total. So (500,000,000.5)^2 is sum_total. So s can be 500,000,000, since 500,000,000^2 is 2.5e17, sum_total is 2.5e17 +5e8. Wait, sum_total is (1e9+1)^2 /4 = (1e18 + 2e9 +1)/4 = 250,000,000,500,000,000.25. But in code, (n+1) is 1e9+1, so (n+1)*(n+1) is (1e9+1)^2, which is 1e18 + 2e9 +1. Divided by4 as integer division gives (1e18 +2e9 +1)/4 = 250000000500000000 (since (1e18 +2e9 +1) mod4 is (0 +2e9 mod4 +1 mod4). 2e9 is 2*(1e9). 1e9 mod4 is 0, so 2e9 mod4 is 0. So 0+0+1=1. So (1e18+2e9+1)/4=250000000500000000.25 \u2192 integer division gives 250000000500000000.\n\nsum_total =250000000500000000. The square of 500,000,000 is (5e8)^2=25e16=250,000,000,000,000,000.\n\nsum_total is 250,000,000,500,000,000 \u2192 5e8 squared is 2.5e17, sum_total is 2.5e17 + 5e8. So 5e8 squared is 2.5e17 < sum_total. (5e8+1)^2= (5e8)^2 + 2*5e8 +1 =2.5e17 +1e9 +1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be made using n blocks. Each block's length is ceil(i/2) for the i-th block. The height of each is 1, so the square's area is side^2. The total area of the blocks used must be at least side^2. So the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that the sum of the first k block lengths (for some k <=n) is >= s\u00b2. But since we can choose any subset of blocks, the sum of all possible blocks up to n gives the maximum possible area. Wait, no. Because the order of the blocks might not matter. Wait, the blocks are numbered from 1 to n. Each block's length is ceil(i/2). So the sum of all the blocks' lengths is the sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2). So the total area available is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). The maximum square possible would have s such that s\u00b2 is <= this sum. So the problem reduces to compute s_max where s_max is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= total_sum, and total_sum is the sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\nSo the first step is to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Then find the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nSo the question is, how to compute sum = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet's compute this sum. For even i and odd i.\n\nFor i=1: ceil(1/2) = 1.\n\ni=2: 1.\n\ni=3: 2.\n\ni=4: 2.\n\ni=5:3, etc.\n\nSo for even numbers: i=2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2) = k.\n\nFor odd numbers: i=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2) = k.\n\nSo the sum can be calculated by considering how many even and odd terms there are.\n\nWait, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nIf i is odd: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2.\n\nIf i is even: ceil(i/2) = i/2.\n\nSo sum can be split into sum of odd i and even i.\n\nLet's split n into even and odd terms.\n\nSuppose n is even. Then there are n/2 even numbers and n/2 odd numbers.\n\nWait, no. For example, if n=4: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd),4 (even). So even count is 2, odd count is 2.\n\nIf n=5: even count 2 (2,4), odd count 3 (1,3,5).\n\nSo for general n:\n\nnumber of even terms: floor(n/2) = (n)//2.\n\nnumber of odd terms: ceil(n/2) = (n+1)//2.\n\nNow, the sum for even terms: each even term is i/2. So sum_evens = sum_{k=1 to m} (2k)/2 = sum k from 1 to m = m(m+1)/2, where m is the number of even terms (since even terms are 2,4,...,2m).\n\nWait, but m is the number of even terms. So for even terms up to n, the count is m = floor(n/2). Because for example, n=4, floor(4/2)=2 terms: 2 and4. So m = floor(n/2).\n\nSum_evens = sum of i/2 where i is even and <=n. Since i =2k for k from 1 to m. So sum_evens = sum_{k=1 to m} (2k)/2 = sum_{k=1 to m} k = m(m+1)/2.\n\nSum_odds: for each odd term i, which is 1,3,5,..., up to n if n is odd. So i=2k-1 for k from 1 to p. Then ceil(i/2) = k. So sum_odds = sum_{k=1 to p} k, where p is the number of odd terms.\n\nThe number of odd terms is ceil(n/2). For example, n=5: ceil(5/2)=3. Which is correct (1,3,5).\n\nSo sum_odds = p(p+1)/2, where p = ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2 if n is odd, or n/2 if n is even? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf n is even, say 4. Then the number of odd terms is 2 (1,3). Which is n/2. (4/2=2). So ceil(4/2) = 2. So yes.\n\nIf n is 5, then (5+1)/2 = 3. So yes. So p = ceil(n/2) = (n +1)//2 (integer division).\n\nSo sum_odds = p*(p +1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test for n=5:\n\np = (5+1)//2 =3. So sum_odds = 3*4/2=6. Let's check:\n\ni=1: ceil(1/2)=1.\n\ni=3: ceil(3/2)=2.\n\ni=5: ceil(5/2)=3.\n\nSum:1+2+3=6. Correct.\n\nFor n=4, p=(4+1)//2 =2 (since (4+1)/2=2.5, floor is 2). sum_odds =2*3/2=3. i=1:1, i=3:2. Sum 3. Correct.\n\nSo sum_total = sum_evens + sum_odds = [m*(m+1)/2] + [p*(p+1)/2], where m = floor(n/2), p=ceil(n/2) = (n+1)//2.\n\nBut m is n//2, and p is (n+1)//2. Because for even n, (n+1)//2 is n/2 + 0.5, but integer division truncates. Wait, let's see:\n\nn=4: even. n//2=2. (n+1)//2 = 5//2=2 (since 5/2 is 2.5, integer division truncates to 2). So p=2.\n\nBut in that case, p is same as m. So sum_evens = m(m+1)/2, sum_odds= p(p+1)/2. So sum_total is (2*3/2)+(2*3/2) =3 +3=6. For n=4:\n\nsum of even terms (2 and4) \u2192 1 +2 =3. sum of odds (1 and3) \u21921 +2=3. Total 6. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nsum_total = [m*(m+1)/2] + [p*(p+1)/2], where m = n//2, p=(n+1)//2.\n\nBut m + p = (n//2) + ( (n+1)//2 ) = for even n: (n/2) + (n/2) =n. For odd n: (n-1)/2 + (n+1)/2 = (n-1 +n+1)/2 = (2n)/2 =n. So m +p =n.\n\nBut in terms of m and p, the sum can be written as sum_total = (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum_total.\n\nSo the approach is: for each test case n, compute sum_total using m and p as above, then find the largest s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 sum_total.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e9, and t up to 1e4, the code must compute sum_total quickly, then compute s via some efficient method.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFor each n:\n\n1. Compute m = n // 2.\n\n   p = (n +1) //2.\n\n2. sum_evens = m*(m+1)/2.\n\n   sum_odds = p*(p+1)/2.\n\n   sum_total = sum_evens + sum_odds.\n\n3. Find the maximum s where s^2 <= sum_total.\n\nSo the key is to compute s as the integer square root of sum_total.\n\nBut how to compute integer square root in C++?\n\nWell, for numbers up to 1e9, the sum can be up to:\n\nLet's compute maximum sum for n=1e9.\n\nm = 5e8, p=5e8+1 (since n is even, n=1e9 is even? Wait 1e9 is even. So m=5e8, p=5e8 (since (1e9+1)/2=500,000,000.5, integer division truncates to 5e8. So p=5e8.\n\nsum_evens = 5e8*(5e8+1)/2.\n\nsum_odds =5e8*(5e8+1)/2.\n\nsum_total = 2 * (5e8 * (5e8+1)/2) ) = 5e8 * (5e8+1).\n\nSo sum_total is 5e8*(5e8+1) \u2248 2.5e17.\n\nThe square root of that is sqrt(2.5e17) \u2248 5e8. So s is around 5e8.\n\nBut for n up to 1e9, sum_total can be up to about 5e8*5e8=2.5e17, so s is up to about 7e8 (since for n=1e9, sum is 5e8*(5e8+1) = (5e8)^2 +5e8 \u2192 square root is 5e8 + 0.5 (approx), but since it's not a perfect square, s is floor(sqrt(sum_total)).\n\nSo to compute s, we can use the sqrt function, but for very large numbers, floating point may not be precise. So perhaps use binary search to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total.\n\nAlternatively, use the C++ function sqrtl which returns long double, but even that might have precision issues for very large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, compute s via binary search.\n\nBut given that sum_total can be up to 5e17, binary search would be feasible as log2(5e17) is about 58 steps, which is acceptable for 1e4 test cases.\n\nSo the code will need to compute sum_total as m(m+1)/2 + p(p+1)/2, where m = n//2, p = (n+1)//2. Then find s = floor( sqrt(sum_total) ).\n\nWait, but how to compute sum_total?\n\nWait, sum_evens = m(m+1)/2. sum_odds = p(p+1)/2. So sum_total is [ m(m+1) + p(p+1) ] / 2.\n\nBut m and p are integers, so sum_total could be a fraction? Let's see:\n\nm and p are such that m +p =n.\n\nIf n is even, then m =n/2, p =n/2. So sum_evens + sum_odds = [ (n/2)(n/2+1) + (n/2)(n/2 +1) ] / 2 \u2192 [ 2 * (n/2 (n/2+1) ) ] /2 \u2192 (n/2 (n/2+1) ). So sum_total is n/2 (n/2 +1).\n\nWait, no. Let's compute for even n:\n\nm =n/2.\n\np = (n+1)//2. For even n, n+1 is odd. So (n+1)/2 = n/2 + 0.5, but integer division truncates. So p = (n+1)//2 = n/2.\n\nWait, for even n, like n=4:\n\nn=4 even.\n\nm=4//2=2.\n\np=(4+1)//2=5//2=2.\n\nSo sum_evens =2*3/2=3.\n\nsum_odds=2*3/2=3.\n\nsum_total=6. Which is (2*3)+(2*3) / 2 \u2192 (6+6)/2=6. So yes.\n\nBut 4/2*(4/2 +1) = 2*(3)=6. So sum_total is indeed equal to m*(m+1) + p*(p+1)/2? Wait, in this case, m and p are 2 and 2.\n\nsum_evens is m(m+1)/2 = 2*3/2=3.\n\nsum_odds is p(p+1)/2 = 2*3/2=3.\n\nsum_total=6.\n\nBut for even n, m and p are equal. So sum_total = 2 * sum_evens = m(m+1).\n\nBut for even n, sum_total is (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2 \u2192 since m =p, that's (2 m(m+1))/2 \u2192 m(m+1). So sum_total is m(m+1) for even n.\n\nWait, but when n is even, m is n/2. So sum_total = (n/2) * (n/2 +1).\n\nFor example, n=4: 2*3=6. Correct.\n\nFor even n, sum_total = (n/2) * (n/2 +1).\n\nFor odd n, let's take n=5.\n\nm=5//2=2.\n\np=(5+1)//2=3.\n\nsum_evens =2*3/2=3.\n\nsum_odds=3*4/2=6.\n\nsum_total=3+6=9.\n\nBut (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2 = (2*3 +3*4)/2 = (6 +12)/2=18/2=9. Correct.\n\nNow, sum_total can be written as:\n\nsum_total = [m(m+1) + p(p+1)] / 2.\n\nBut m + p = n.\n\nWait, m = floor(n/2), p = ceil(n/2). So m + p =n.\n\nSo for even n, m =p= n/2. For odd n, m = (n-1)/2, p = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo sum_total is (m(m+1) + p(p+1))/2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to simplify this expression.\n\nLet's substitute m = n//2, p = (n+1)//2.\n\nBut for even n:\n\nn=2k:\n\nm =k.\n\np= (2k +1)//2 =k.\n\nsum_total = k(k+1) + k(k+1) / 2 \u2192 (2k(k+1))/2 =k(k+1).\n\nFor even n, sum_total = k(k+1) = (n/2) (n/2 +1).\n\nFor odd n:\n\nn=2k+1.\n\nm= (2k+1)//2 =k.\n\np= (2k+2)//2 =k+1.\n\nsum_evens =k(k+1)/2.\n\nsum_odds = (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nsum_total = [k(k+1) + (k+1)(k+2)] /2 \u2192 (k+1)[k +k +2] /2 \u2192 (k+1)(2k+2)/2 \u2192 (k+1)(k+1) \u2192 (k+1)^2.\n\nBut for odd n=2k+1, sum_total is (k+1)^2.\n\nWait, let's check n=5:\n\nk= (5-1)/2=2.\n\nsum_total= (2+1)^2=9. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nm=1, p=2.\n\nsum_evens=1*2/2=1.\n\nsum_odds=2*3/2=3.\n\nsum_total=4. (1+3=4). Which is (1+1+1)^2= (2+1)^2? Wait for n=3, k= (3-1)/2=1. sum_total is (1+1)^2=4. Correct.\n\nWait, so for odd n=2k+1, sum_total is (k+1)^2.\n\nSo for even n=2k: sum_total is k(k+1).\n\nFor odd n=2k+1: sum_total is (k+1)^2.\n\nSo perhaps we can find a formula based on whether n is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find a general formula for sum_total.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf n is even:\n\nsum_total = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4.\n\nIf n is odd:\n\nsum_total = ((n+1)/2)^2 \u2192 (n+1)^2 /4.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, sum_total can be written as:\n\nsum_total = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ).\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFor even n=4:\n\n(n+1)^2 =25. 25/4=6.25. floor(6.25)=6. Which matches sum_total=6.\n\nFor odd n=5: (5+1)^2=36. 36/4=9. floor(9)=9. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)^2=16/4=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3)^2=9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor 2. sum_total is 2*(3)/2 \u2192 3. Wait, no.\n\nWait n=2 is even. sum_total is (2/2)*(2/2 +1)=1*2=2. But according to floor( (2+1)^2 /4 )=9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor is 2. Which matches.\n\nn=1: (1+1)^2=4/4=1 \u2192 sum_total is 1. Correct.\n\nYes! So sum_total is equal to floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ).\n\nWait, let's test for even n=6.\n\nsum_total for even 6:\n\nm=3, sum_evens=3*4/2=6.\n\nsum_odds: p=(6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3.\n\nsum_odds=3*4/2=6.\n\nsum_total=12.\n\nAccording to (6+1)^2 /4=49/4=12.25 \u2192 floor is 12. Correct.\n\nAnother example: even n=2.\n\nsum_total= (2/2)*(2/2 +1) =1*2=2.\n\nfloor( (2+1)^2 /4 )=9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor 2. Correct.\n\nYes! So sum_total can be computed as floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ).\n\nWow, that's a neat formula. So regardless of n being even or odd, sum_total is (n+1)^2//4 (integer division).\n\nSo the sum_total is equal to ( (n+1)^2 ) //4.\n\nWait, because for even n:\n\n(n+1)^2 = (2k+1)^2 =4k\u00b2 +4k +1 \u2192 divided by4 gives k\u00b2 +k + 0.25. The integer division (floor) would be k\u00b2 +k \u2192 which is k(k+1), which matches the even case.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1: (n+1)^2 = (2k+2)^2=4(k+1)^2 \u2192 divided by4 gives (k+1)^2, which is integer. So for odd n, sum_total is (k+1)^2.\n\nThus, sum_total = ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) //4.\n\nSo now, the code can compute sum_total as ((n+1) * (n+1)) /4, but using integer division. Wait, but in C++, if we write (n+1)*(n+1)/4, but using integer division, does that work?\n\nYes. Because (n+1) is integer, so (n+1)^2 is computed as (n+1)*(n+1), then divided by4 using integer division.\n\nSo for example, when n=4 (even), (4+1)^2=25 \u2192 25/4=6.25 \u2192 integer division gives 6, which is correct.\n\nn=5 \u21926^2=36/4=9 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo sum_total can be written as ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4.\n\nSo that's a much simpler way to compute sum_total.\n\nThus, the code for sum_total is simply ((n +1) * (n+1)) /4.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nWait, (n+1)^2 /4 can be written as ((n+1)/2)^2, but for integer division.\n\nBut in code, how is this handled?\n\nFor example, when n is even:\n\nn=4 \u21925^2=25. 25/4=6.25, but integer division (25 /4) is 6.\n\nYes. So in code, sum_total is ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4.\n\nBut in C++, for integer variables, (n+1) is a long long, and multiplied by (n+1) gives a long long, then divided by4.\n\nYes. So in code:\n\nlong long sum_total = ( (n +1) * (n+1) ) /4;\n\nBut wait, when n is up to 1e9, (n+1) is 1e9+1. (n+1)^2 is 1e18+2e9+1, which is 1.002e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e9, (n+1)^2 can be up to (1e9+1)^2 =1e18 + 2e9 +1 \u22481e18, which is within the range of a 64-bit integer (since 2^63 is about 9e18). So using long long is okay.\n\nSo sum_total is (n+1)*(n+1)/4.\n\nThus, the code can compute sum_total as ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4.\n\nOnce sum_total is computed, the problem is to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total.\n\nSo the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of sum_total.\n\nIn C++, for a given sum_total, s can be computed as (long long)sqrt(sum_total).\n\nBut wait, due to floating point precision issues, this might not be accurate. For example, if sum_total is a very large number, the sqrt function may not compute the exact integer square root.\n\nSo better to use binary search to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total.\n\nBut for numbers up to 1e18, binary search would be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrtl(sum_total) as a long double and floor it, but check if (s+1)^2 is <= sum_total.\n\nBut perhaps the binary search method is more reliable.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCompute sum_total = (n+1)^2 /4.\n\nCompute s such that s is the largest integer where s^2 <= sum_total.\n\nBut sum_total can be as large as (1e9 +1)^2 /4 = (1e18)/4 = 2.5e17. So the square root is about 5e8, which fits in a 64-bit integer.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute sum_total = ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4.\n\nCompute s = floor( sqrt(sum_total) )\n\nBut wait, in code:\n\nsum_total is a long long variable.\n\ns can be computed via:\n\ns = sqrt(sum_total);\n\nBut when sum_total is a perfect square, then s is exact. Otherwise, floor.\n\nBut due to floating point precision, perhaps we can compute s via binary search.\n\nBut for speed, perhaps using sqrt is acceptable here.\n\nBut let's think of edge cases.\n\nFor example, sum_total = 25 \u2192 sqrt(25) is 5.0 \u2192 correct.\n\nsum_total=24 \u2192 sqrt(24) is ~4.898 \u2192 floor is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut for very large numbers, like sum_total= (1e18), sqrt would give 1e9.\n\nBut when sum_total is (1e9 +1)^2, the sqrt is 1e9+1.\n\nBut in code, (n+1) can be up to 1e9+1. sum_total is (1e9+1)^2/4. For example, n=1e9:\n\nsum_total = (1e9+1)^2 /4 = (1e18 + 2e9 +1)/4 = 2.5e17 + 5e8 + 0.25.\n\nBut when we compute sum_total in code, (n+1) is 1e9+1, which is stored as a long long. (1e9+1) * (1e9+1) is 1e18 + 2e9 +1. Divided by4 using integer division gives (1e18 +2e9 +1)/4 = 250,000,000,500,000,000.25 \u2192 but integer division truncates to 250000000500000000.\n\nThe square root of that is approx 500,000,000.5, but the actual sqrt may be 500,000,000, and (500,000,000)^2 =250,000,000,000,000,000 which is less than sum_total, but 500,000,000,500,000,000.25 is (500,000,000.5)^2.\n\nWait, sum_total is ( (n+1)^2 ) /4, which may not be a perfect square. But the maximum s is the floor of the square root of sum_total.\n\nSo in code, the problem is to compute the floor of the square root of sum_total.\n\nIn C++, the function sqrt returns a double. For sum_total up to 1e18, double has 52 bits of precision, which is enough for integers up to 2^52 (about 4e15), but sum_total can be up to (1e9+1)^2/4 = 2.5e17. So for numbers larger than 2^52 (4.5e15), the sqrt function may not represent them accurately, leading to possible errors.\n\nSo using sqrt in this case may not be precise. Therefore, binary search is a better approach.\n\nSo implement a binary search for s.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=sum_total (but sqrt(sum_total) is at most sum_total^(0.5) which is up to 5e8 for sum_total up to 2.5e17).\n\nBut binary search would work.\n\nSo code for binary search:\n\nlong long sum_total = ((n+1) * (n+1)) /4;\n\nlong long low=0, high=1e9+1;\n\nlong long s=0;\n\nwhile (low <= high) {\n\n    long long mid = (low + high)/2;\n\n    if (mid * mid <= sum_total) {\n\n        s=mid;\n\n        low=mid+1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        high=mid-1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, this code finds the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total.\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nThe code for the solve function would be:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nCompute sum_total = ((n+1) * (n+1)) /4.\n\nThen compute s via binary search.\n\nOutput s.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst test case: n=1. sum_total = (2^2)/4=4/4=1. s=1. Correct.\n\nSecond test case: n=5.\n\nsum_total = (6^2)/4=36/4=9. s=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. sum_total=(4^2)/4=16/4=4. s=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. sum_total=25/4=6.25 \u2192 integer division gives6. s=2, since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6. So s=2. Which is correct. Because sum_total is6. The maximum square is 2x2=4. But wait, in the sample input n=5, sum_total is9, s=3.\n\nWait, for n=4, sum_total is6. So the maximum s is 2 (since 2^2=4 \u22646, 3^2=9>6). So the answer is 2. So the code would output 2.\n\nBut according to the formula sum_total = (n+1)^2//4. For n=4: sum_total is (5*5)/4=25/4=6. So binary search would find s=2.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nThe code must read t test cases. For each, read n, compute sum_total as ((n+1)*(n+1))/4, then compute s via binary search.\n\nBut for n up to 1e9, sum_total is up to ((1e9+1)^2)/4 \u2248 (1e18)/4=2.5e17. So binary search would take around 30 steps per test case. For t=1e4, 3e5 steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code:\n\nInside solve function:\n\nlong long n;\n\ncin >> n;\n\nlong long sum_total = ( (n+1) * (n+1) ) /4;\n\nlong long low=0, high=1e9+1;\n\nlong long s=0;\n\nwhile (low <= high) {\n\n    long long mid = (low + high)/2;\n\n    if (mid * mid <= sum_total) {\n\n        s=mid;\n\n        low=mid+1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        high=mid-1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\ncout << s << endl;\n\nWait, but (n+1) can be up to 1e9+1. So (n+1) is 1e9+1. (n+1)*(n+1) is (1e9+1)^2 which is 1e18+2e9+1. So when we divide by4, sum_total is 250000000500000000.25 \u2192 but integer division truncates to 250000000500000000.\n\nThen, binary search would find s = sqrt(250000000500000000) \u2192 which is 500,000,000.25 \u2192 floor is 500,000,000. So s^2=250000000000000000, which is less than sum_total. But sum_total is 250000000500000000. So s is 500,000,000.\n\nBut is there a larger s where s^2 <= sum_total? Let's see:\n\n500,000,000^2 =250,000,000,000,000,000.\n\n500,000,000^2 + 500,000,000 = 250,000,000,500,000,000. Which is exactly sum_total. So (500,000,000.5)^2 is sum_total. So s can be 500,000,000, since 500,000,000^2 is 2.5e17, sum_total is 2.5e17 +5e8.\n\nWait, sum_total is (1e9+1)^2 /4 = (1e18 + 2e9 +1)/4 = 250,000,000,500,000,000.25. But in code, (n+1) is 1e9+1, so (n+1)*(n+1) is (1e9+1)^2, which is 1e18 + 2e9 +1. Divided by4 as integer division gives (1e18 +2e9 +1)/4 = 250000000500000000 (since (1e18 +2e9 +1) mod4 is (0 +2e9 mod4 +1 mod4). 2e9 is 2*(1e9). 1e9 mod4 is 0, so 2e9 mod4 is 0. So 0+0+1=1. So (1e18+2e9+1)/4=250000000500000000.25 \u2192 integer division gives 250000000500000000.\n\nsum_total =250000000500000000.\n\nThe square of 500,000,000 is (5e8)^2=25e16=250,000,000,000,000,000.\n\nsum_total is 250,000,000,500,000,000 \u2192 5e8 squared is 2.5e17, sum_total is 2.5e17 + 5e8.\n\nSo 5e8 squared is 2.5e17 < sum_total. (5e8+1)^2= (5e8)^2 + 2*5e8 +1 =2.5e17 +1e9 +1. Which is 250,000,000,000,000,000 +1,000,000,001 \u2192250,001,000,000,001,000,001. But sum_total is 250,000,000,500,000,000. So (5e8+1)^2 is 250,001,000,000,001,000,001, which is way larger than sum_total. So the maximum s is 5e8.\n\nSo binary search would find s=5e8.\n\nThus, code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nThe code must read n as a long long (but n is up to 1e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer, but since using long long is safer.\n\nSo the code in solve() function:\n\nlong long n;\n\ncin >> n;\n\nlong long sum_total = ((n+1) * (n+1)) /4;\n\nThen binary search for s.\n\nBut wait, the binary search's upper bound can be sum_total. But sum_total's square root is up to (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, for sum_total = (n+1)^2 /4. So the square root of sum_total is (n+1)/2.\n\nBut (n+1)/2 may not be an integer. For example, n=5 \u2192 sum_total=9. sqrt(9)=3. (5+1)/2=3. So yes.\n\nn=4 \u2192 sum_total=6.25/4=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)\u22482.449. (4+1)/2=2.5. So yes, sqrt(sum_total) is (n+1)/2.\n\nThus, the maximum possible s is floor( (n+1)/2 ), but only if (n+1)/2 is such that s\u00b2 <= sum_total.\n\nWait, but sum_total is ((n+1)/2)^2 when n is odd.\n\nWait, when n is odd, sum_total is ( (n+1)/2 )^2. So s is exactly (n+1)/2.\n\nBut when n is even, sum_total is (n/2)*(n/2+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt( (n/2)*(n/2+1) ) )\n\nFor example, n=4: sum_total=2*3=6 \u2192 s=2, since 2^2=4 <=6, 3^2=9>6. So s=2. (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor is 2. So s=2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo perhaps s is floor( (n+1)/2 ), but this is not always the case.\n\nWait, let's take n=5: sum_total=9. s=3. (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum_total=4. (3+1)/2=2. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=6: sum_total=(7^2)/4=49/4=12.25 \u2192 sum_total in code is 12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 s=3.\n\n(n+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 floor is3. Which matches.\n\nSo for even n, sum_total is (n/2)(n/2 +1), and s is floor( sqrt( sum_total ) ), which is floor( sqrt( (n/2)(n/2 +1) ) ).\n\nBut in code, using binary search gives the correct s.\n\nSo the code as written is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is the solve function as described.\n\nNow, the code in C++:\n\nThe solve function reads n, computes sum_total as (n+1)*(n+1)/4, then binary search for s.\n\nBut in code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define long long int\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define long long int\n\nBut this is incorrect. The #define is wrong here. The correct code would use typedef.\n\nBut the original code has:\n\n#define long long int\n\nWhich is incorrect. Because the #define replaces 'long' with 'long int' wherever it appears. So for example, variables declared as 'long long' would become 'long int long', which is invalid.\n\nBut the original code may have a typo. Perhaps the intended line is:\n\ntypedef long long int ll;\n\nBut the code given has:\n\n#define long long int\n\nWhich is wrong. So the code is incorrect, but the user must fill in the missing part.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code.\n\nThe missing code is the solve function.\n\nSo inside solve():\n\nRead n as a long long (but in the code as given, the #define is incorrect. But perhaps the code is written with 'long long' variables.)\n\nAssuming that the code is correct, the solve function will be:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    long long n;\n\n    cin >> n;\n\n    long long sum_total = ((n + 1) * (n + 1)) / 4;\n\n    long long low = 0, high = 2e9;\n\n    long long s = 0;\n\n    while (low <= high) {\n\n        long long mid = (low + high) / 2;\n\n        if (mid * mid <= sum_total) {\n\n            s = mid;\n\n            low = mid + 1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            high = mid - 1;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout << s << '\\n';\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, high can be set to (n+1), but since n can be up to 1e9, (n+1)/2 is up to 5e8+1. So high can be initialized to 1e9+1.\n\nAlternatively, high can be initialized to 1e18 (but that's overkill). For sum_total up to 2.5e17, the square root is up to 5e8. So setting high to 1e9 is sufficient.\n\nSo the code above.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=5 \u2192 sum_total=36/4=9 \u2192 s=3.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=1 \u2192 sum_total=4/4=1 \u2192 s=1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=6 \u2192 sum_total=49/4=12.25 \u2192 integer division gives12. Binary search:\n\nmid between 0 and 1e9.\n\nmid=6e8 \u2192 6e8^2 is 3.6e17 which is larger than 12. So high=5e8, etc. But the binary search would quickly converge.\n\nBut in reality, sum_total=12. s=3 (3^2=9 \u226412, 4^2=16>12).\n\nSo code outputs 3.\n\nThus, the code is correct."
