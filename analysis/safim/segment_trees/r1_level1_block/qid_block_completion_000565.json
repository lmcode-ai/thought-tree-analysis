        "text": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully. The problem is about calculating the minimum amount of energy to restore by sitting on benches to reach the last bench. The setup is that there are n+1 benches in a row. The distance between bench i and i+1 is a_i meters. We start with m units of energy. Walking each meter uses one unit. We can sit on any bench (after bench 1, I guess) and restore any integer amount of energy. The goal is to find the minimum total energy restored to reach the end. Hmm. So, the key is to track our energy as we move from bench to bench. At each step, we need to ensure that we have enough energy to get to the next bench.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the minimum amount of energy to restore by sitting on benches to reach the last bench. The setup is that there are n+1 benches in a row. The distance between bench i and i+1 is a_i meters. We start with m units of energy. Walking each meter uses one unit. We can sit on any bench (after bench 1, I guess) and restore any integer amount of energy. The goal is to find the minimum total energy restored to reach the end.\n\nHmm. So, the key is to track our energy as we move from bench to bench. At each step, we need to ensure that we have enough energy to get to the next bench. If we don't, we have to sit on the current bench and restore just enough to cover the deficit. But how do we calculate the minimum total?\n\nLet's think through the example. In the first test case of the example, the input is n=3, m=1, and a = [1,2,1]. The benches are 1-2-3-4. The steps are:\n\nStart at bench 1 with 1 energy. Walk to bench 2 (distance 1), uses 1 energy. Now at bench 2 with 0 energy. Need to restore. Then walk 2 meters to bench 3. So need 2 energy. But after restoring, can have more than m. So here, restore 2 units (total now 2), walk to bench 3 (uses 2, back to 0). Then restore 1 unit to walk 1 meter to bench 4. So total restored is 2+1=3.\n\nWait, but the problem says the output for that case is 2. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me check the note again. The note says in the first test case, you restore 2 units at bench 2, then walk to 3 (spend 2), then restore 1 unit at bench 3, then walk to 4. So total restored is 2+1=3. But according to the problem's note, the answer is 3? But the output example says that the first test case's answer is 3. Wait, but in the note, the example output says the first test case's answer is 3. Wait, the note says that the output for the first test case is 3. So the code's logic needs to calculate the sum of the deficits that occur when the current energy is less than the required a_i for the next step.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to track the current energy, subtract the a_i each time, and whenever the current energy goes negative, accumulate the deficit (since that's the amount needed to restore), then set current energy back to zero (since after restoring, you have enough to cover the a_i). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: each time you move from bench i to i+1, you spend a_i energy. If your current energy is less than a_i, you need to restore (a_i - current_energy) units. But when you restore, you can restore exactly the deficit. Then, after restoring, your energy becomes (current_energy + restored) - a_i. Wait, no. Wait, you sit on bench i, which is after you arrive at bench i. So you arrive at bench i with some energy. Then, you can restore any amount (including zero). Then, when you leave bench i, you have that energy. So the process is:\n\ncurrent_energy starts at m.\n\nFor each a_i (from bench 1 to bench 2, then to 3, etc. up to n+1):\n\nIf current_energy < a_i: you need to restore (a_i - current_energy) units. But once you restore that, after spending a_i, your energy would be (current_energy + restored) - a_i. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nAt each bench i (from 1 to n), when you are there, you have some energy. To proceed to bench i+1, you need to have at least a_i energy. If you don't, you have to restore (a_i - current_energy) units. Then, after restoring, your energy is (current_energy + restored_amount) - a_i. But the total restored is the sum of all the restored_amounts.\n\nWait, but how do we track the current_energy after each step.\n\nLet me think with the example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTest case: n=3 (so 4 benches), m=1, a = [1,2,1].\n\nSo steps:\n\nStart at bench 1 with 1 energy.\n\nMove to bench 2: distance 1. Spend 1. Now energy is 0. No problem. So at bench 2. Now, next step is to move to bench 3, which requires 2 energy. But current energy is 0. So need to restore 2 units. Total restored becomes 2. Now, energy after restoring is 0 + 2 = 2. Spend 2, now energy is 0 again. Now at bench 3. Next step is move to 4, which is a distance 1. Current energy is 0. Need to restore 1. Total restored is 3. Then spend 1. So total restored is 3. But according to the note, the answer is 2+1=3, which matches. But the sample input says in the first test case, the output is 3. So the code's current structure seems to be adding up all the a_i, compare to m, and if sum exceeds m, output sum - m. Wait, in this example, sum of a_i is 1+2+1=4, m=1. sum - m is 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, that's exactly the code's current logic. The code reads n and m (though in the code, it's m and n, but the variables are swapped). Wait, the code's current structure is:\n\nIt reads m and n, then the a array of m elements. Then sums the a array. If sum >n, output sum -n else 0.\n\nWait, but according to the input description, the first line of the test case is n and m. So the code's variables are swapped. Because the code says scanf(\"%lld %lld\", &m, &n), but according to the problem statement, the first line of the test case is n and m. So the code has swapped the variables. So in the code, m in the test case is n, and n is m?\n\nWait, the problem says the first line of the test case is two integers n and m. But in the code, the code reads m and n. So the code's m is the n from the problem, and the code's n is the m from the problem.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. For example, in the first test case of the example, the input is n=3 and m=1. But in the code, the code reads m=3, n=1. Then the a array has m=3 elements. Then sum all a elements. sum is 1+2+1=4. Then if sum> n (1), then output sum -n =3, which is correct.\n\nSo in the code, the variables are swapped. So the code's m is the problem's n (number of benches minus one), and the code's n is the initial energy m. Then, the code's a array is of size m, which is correct. Then, the code sums all the a_i. If the sum exceeds the initial energy (n), then the answer is sum -n. Else 0.\n\nWait, but this approach would work only if the sum of all a_i is the total required energy, and the initial energy is m. So the minimal restore is sum a_i - initial m, but only if sum a_i > initial m. Otherwise, zero. But is this correct?\n\nWait, let's think of another example. Suppose the a array is [3,3], initial m=5. Sum a is 6. So initial m is 5. So 6-5=1. So the answer is 1. Let's see:\n\nBench 1 to 2: distance 3. Initial energy 5. Spend 3, now 2. Bench 2 to 3: distance 3. Current energy 2. Need 3. So restore 1. Total restored 1. Then spend 3. So total restored is 1, which is correct. So code's approach works here.\n\nAnother example: a = [5,5], m=5. Sum is 10. 10-5=5. Let's see:\n\nBench 1: energy 5. Spend 5 to bench 2. Now 0. Need to go to bench3, 5. So restore 5. Total restored 5. Spend 5. So yes, sum - m is correct.\n\nAnother example where the sum is the same as the required, but the steps require more.\n\nWait, suppose a = [4, 1], m=4.\n\nSum a is 5. m=4. 5-4=1. So code's approach would say 1. Let's see:\n\nBench1 to 2: spend 4, energy 0. Then, need to go to bench3, which is 1. So need to restore 1. Total restored 1. Correct.\n\nBut what if the a array is [1,4], m=4. Sum is 5, same as before. So code's approach would output 1. Let's see:\n\nBench1 to 2: spend 1, energy 3. Then go to bench3: 4. Have 3, need 4. So restore 1. Total 1. Correct. So code's approach works.\n\nSo in all these cases, the code's logic of summing all a_i, subtract m (if sum is larger) gives the correct answer. So why is that?\n\nBecause the minimal energy to restore is exactly the sum of the a_i minus the initial m, provided that sum is larger. Because, regardless of the order of the a_i, as long as you restore the necessary amount at each step, the total is the same. For example, even if the first a_i is larger than m, you need to restore (a_i - m) at the first bench, then have zero energy, but the sum approach works.\n\nWait, let's test another case. Suppose a = [6], m=3. Sum is 6. 6-3=3. So the answer is 3. Let's see:\n\nStart with 3. Need to walk 6. Not enough. So must restore 3 (since 3 +3 =6). Spend 6. So total restored 3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a = [3,3], m=4. Sum is 6. 6-4=2. So code's approach would say 2. Let's see:\n\nBench1 to 2: spend 3. Energy left 1. Then to bench3: need 3. So restore 2 (1 +2 =3). Spend 3. Total restored 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut why? Because each time you have to have enough energy to cover the next a_i. The optimal way is to restore exactly the deficit for each step. So the sum of all a_i is the total required, and the initial m is given. So the minimal restore is max(0, sum a_i - m).\n\nSo the code's approach is correct, but the code has a variable swap. The problem's first line of each test case is n and m. But in the code, the code reads m and n. So in the code's variable names, m is the number of a_i elements (since n is the problem's n, which is the number of a_i elements). Wait, the problem's n is the number of distances between benches, which is n, so the array a has n elements. So the code's m is the problem's n, and the code's n is the problem's m.\n\nSo the code reads:\n\nscanf(\"%lld %lld\", &m, &n); where m is problem's n, and n is problem's m.\n\nThen the code loops for i=0 to i<m (problem's n) to read the a array. Then sum all a_i. If sum >n (problem's m), then sum -n else 0.\n\nWhich is exactly the approach needed.\n\nSo the missing code is to read the a array elements, and compute their sum.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nfor(i=0;i<m;i++)\n{\n/* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo inside this loop, each a[i] is read, and added to s (sum). So the code inside the loop is:\n\nscanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\ns += a[i];\n\nBut wait, in the code, the variable s is initialized to 0. So the missing code is the lines to read each a[i] and accumulate the sum.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nscanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\ns += a[i];\n\nPutting that inside the loop.\n\nSo the code's for loop would read all the a_i elements and sum them into s. Then, after that, compare s to n (problem's m). If s> n, output s-n. Else 0.\n\nThus, the missing code is adding the a_i elements to the sum.\n\nSo the answer is to fill the loop with reading each a_i and adding to s.\n\nSo the correct missing code is:\n\nscanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\ns += a[i];"
