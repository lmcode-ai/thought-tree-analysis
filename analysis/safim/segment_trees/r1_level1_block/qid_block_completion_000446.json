But the sum of multiple non-decreasing arrays is not necessarily non-decreasing. So, this complicates things. Hmm. Maybe the key insight is that the sum of all increments for a node must be >= the sum of all increments for its parent. Because each time you add a non-decreasing sequence along a path. For example, if you have a node u and its parent p. Any operation that affects u's path will also affect p. So in each such operation, the increment for p is <= the increment for u. Therefore, the total sum of increments for u is >= the sum for p. Because each time you add some c_i where c_p <= c_u. So sum(c_p over all ops including p) <= sum(c_u over all ops including u). But u's path may be part of multiple operations. So, the total sum for u is the sum of all c's from operations that include u. Similarly for p.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a path p -> u. If we apply an operation on u with c_p = 2 and c_u =3. Then another operation on p with c_p=4. Then the total for p is 2+4=6, for u it's 3. So 6>3. Which violates the sum_p <= sum_u. But that's allowed, but according to the problem's operations, each individual c array is non-decreasing. But the sum across operations can have sum_p > sum_u, which would not satisfy the sum_p <= sum_u. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the sum of the a_v's must be between l_v and r_v, but the sum of the increments (from all operations) must satisfy sum(c_p) <= sum(c_u) for all u's parent p. Because each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path, so in each operation, when you add c_p and c_u (with p being the parent of u along the path), then c_p <= c_u. So when you sum all such c_p and c_u across all operations, sum(c_p) <= sum(c_u). Because each term c_p_i (for operation i) is <= c_u_i in that same operation. So sum(c_p_i) over i <= sum(c_u_i) over i.\n\nAh, this is a crucial point. So the sum of all increments for a node u must be >= the sum of all increments for its parent p.

Wait, but this would violate the requirement that the sum for p must be <= the sum for u. Because in this scenario, sum_p could be higher than sum_u. Wait, this is a problem. Because according to the problem statement, each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path.

An operation on v would affect the path from root to v, which includes p and v. So in that case, the increment for p (c_p) in that operation is <= the increment for v. But u is not part of that path, so u's sum is not affected. So for p's sum, this operation contributes c_p, but u's sum is not affected. So if in this operation, c_p is 5, then p's sum increases by 5, and u's sum remains. So sum_p could be larger than sum_u. But this contradicts the earlier logic that sum_p <= sum_u.

So, for a node v, the increments added to it in different operations can vary, but each time v is part of an operation's path, the c_i for v in that operation must be >= the c_i of the previous nodes in the path (i.e., ancestors of v). However, since each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path, the increments in that operation for the ancestors of v must be <= the increment for v in that same operation. But when you combine multiple operations, the sum for v can be higher than the sum for its parent. For example, if in one operation you add c1 to parent and c2 to v (c1 <= c2), and in another operation you add c3 to parent and c4 to v (c3 <= c4), then the sum for parent is c1 + c3, and for v is c2 + c4.",

Wait, here's an insight from the problem's sample explanation: In the second test case, two operations are needed. The first operation is on vertex 2, with c = [3,3]. This sets a_1=3 and a_2=3, but a_3=0. Then, an operation on vertex 3 with c = [2,7] (assuming the path is 1->3?), but wait, the parent of 3 must be p_3 <3, which in the sample is probably 1. So the path is 1 and 3. The c array [2,7] adds 2 to a_1 and 7 to a_3. So after this, a_1=3+2=5, a_3=7. So each operation's increments are non-decreasing along their path. So the sum for a_1 is 5, which is higher than a_3's sum (7). Wait, no: 5 <7. So in the second operation, the c array is [2,7], which is non-decreasing. So the sum for 1 is increased by 2, and for 3 by 7. So the sum for 3 (7) is greater than the sum for 1 (2 in this operation). So the total a_1 is 3+2=5, a_3 is 7. So in this case, the sum for a_3 (7) is larger than a_1 (5), which is allowed. But how does the algorithm model this? Another approach: think of each node's a_v as a sum that can be adjusted through multiple operations. The minimal number of operations required is determined by the nodes that require the most \"steps\" in their path. Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: each operation can add a non-decreasing sequence to a path.",

But since the increments in the path to v include u, the increment for u in those operations must be <= the increment for v in the same operations. So, for any operation that includes both u and v (which is every operation that includes v, since u is the parent), the increment for u in that operation is <= the increment for v in that operation. Therefore, the sum of increments for u from operations that include v is <= the sum for v. But u may have other operations that are not part of the path to v, which can contribute to u's sum.

Wait, but each operation that contributes to a child's a will also contribute to the parent's a. So for example, if a child v requires a certain increment, then the parent u's increment in the same operations must be <= v's. So the parent's a is the sum of increments from all operations that include u. Some of those operations are on the paths to v and its siblings, and others are on paths to u's other descendants.

So, for each child v of u:\n\nThe operations on v's path must have increments for u <= increments for v. So the sum of increments for u from these operations is <= sum of increments for v from these operations. But the sum for v must be >= l_v and <= r_v. So, the sum for u from these operations is <= sum for v, which is >= l_v. So, sum for u from these operations is >= l_v if sum for v is exactly l_v. No, that's not correct. sum for u from these operations can be less than l_v. So this approach might not work. Another idea: For each node u, the required sum a_u must be at least the maximum of the l_v of its children. Because for each child v, the sum for v is >= l_v. And the sum for u from the operations that include v is <= the sum for v. So, the sum for u from these operations is <= sum for v >= l_v.",

So node 1 requires no operation. So total operations are 2. This matches the sample. So this suggests that the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of nodes where the node's l is greater than the maximum l of all its children. Thus, the solution is to count the number of nodes where l_u > max(l_v for v in children of u). So, the code's DFS function should, for each node u, compute the maximum l among its children, and compare it with l_u. If l_u is greater than this maximum, then increment the operation count. So, the code for the DFS function would be:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    ll max_child_l = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        max_child_l = max(max_child_l, l[v]); // Or perhaps f[v]?\n    } if (l[u] > max_child_l) {\n        c++;\n    }\n    f[u] = max(l[u], max_child_l);\n}\n\nWait, but then what about the r constraints?

But the problem's input guarantees that a solution exists, so perhaps the condition l_u < = r_u and for each node u, the maximum of its children's l and its own l must be <= r_u. But how to ensure that. So the code would need to check if the maximum l (from children and own) is <= r_u. If not, it's impossible, but the problem says the input is valid. So, in the code's DFS, we compute the maximum of the children's l and compare with the current node's l. If the current node's l is larger, then we need an operation. The variable c is incremented in that case. The f[u] stores the maximum between the node's l and the maximum of the children's l. This is passed to the parent to compute the same condition. This approach seems to align with the samples.",

Thus, the number of operations is the number of nodes where l[u] exceeds the maximum l of its children. This seems to be the correct approach. Testing this against the samples:\n\nFirst sample: Node 2 is a child of 1. It has no children. max_child_l is 0. l[2] is 2>0: increment c (now 1). f[2] =2. Node 1's children's max_child_l is 2. l[1] is 1 <2: no increment. f[1] =2. So c=1. Second sample: Node 3: no children. l[3] =7>0: increment c (c=1). f[3]=7.\n\nNode 2: no children. l[2] =3>0: increment c (c=2). f[2]=3. Node 1: children max_child_l is max(7,3)=7. l[1] =5 <7: no increment. f[1] =7. So c=2. Which matches the samples. So this approach seems correct. Thus, the missing code in the DFS function is:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    ll max_l = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        max_l = max(max_l, f[v]);\n    } if (l[u] > max_l) {\n        c++;\n    }\n    f[u] = max(l[u], max_l);\n    if (f[u] > r[u]) {\n        f[u] = r[u]; // This line might be necessary to handle cases where the maximum exceeds r[u], but the problem guarantees it's valid.\n    }\n} Wait, but in the problem statement, the a_v must be <= r_v.",

But in the second sample, node 1's l_v is 5, and the maximum of its children's l_v is 7 (from node 3). So node 1's l_v is 5, which is less than 7. So according to the initial approach, node 1 would not require an operation, and the sum for node 1 would be 7. But node 1's r is 5, which is impossible. This indicates that the initial approach is incorrect. So, the code must take into account both the l and r constraints. Thus, the correct approach must track for each node u the required a_u, which is between l_u and r_u, and also >= the required a_v of all children. But since the required a_v for the children is between l_v and r_v, and the required a_u must be >= a_v (from the operations that include the child's path), but a_u can be anything >= l_u and <= r_u.

Ah! Here's the key insight: Each node's a_v is the sum of increments from all operations that include v in their path. So, for node 1 in the second sample, the two operations are:\n\n1. Operation on node 2: increments [3,3]. This contributes 3 to node 1 and 3 to node 2.\n\n2. Operation on node 3: increments [2,7]. This contributes 2 to node 1 and 7 to node 3. So, a_1 is 3+2=5, which is within [5,5]. a_3 is 7, which is within [7,7]. a_2 is 3, within [3,3]. In this case, node 1's a is 5, which is covered by the two operations. The max_l for node 1's children is max(3,7) =7. But node 1's l is 5, which is less than 7. But according to the initial approach, node 1's required a is the max between l_u (5) and max_children_l (7), which would be 7. But node 1's a is 5. This contradicts the initial approach. Thus, the initial approach is wrong. So there must be a different way to model the problem.",

For example, a_v must be >= a_parent. Because each operation that includes v's path also includes the parent, and the increment for the parent is <= the increment for v in that operation. So the sum for the parent from those operations is <= the sum for v.\n\nBut wait, this is only true for the sum contributed by operations that include v. The parent's sum can include other operations that do not include v, which can have higher increments. But the sum for the parent's a is the sum of all increments from all operations that include the parent. This includes operations that include the parent but not v (like operations on other children). Thus, the parent's sum can be higher than the sum for v.\n\nSo, there's no constraint that a_parent <= a_v. This complicates the problem.",

But also, the f[u] is set to the maximum between l[u] and the children's f. However, if this maximum exceeds the node's r, then f[u] is set to r[u]. Thus, the code should be:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    f[u] = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        f[u] = max(f[u], f[v]);\n    } if (l[u] > f[u]) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u]));\n    }\n} Wait, but this needs to be adjusted. For example, in the second sample:\n\nNode 3's f is 7 (l is 7, which is >0, so c increments. f becomes r[3] =7. Node 2's f is 3 (l=3>0, c increments, f becomes 3. Node 1's f is max(7,3) =7. l[1] is 5 <=7. So no increment. f[1] is min(r[1], max(7,5)) \u2192 if r[1] is 5, then f[1] is 5. But how does this happen? So, the code would set f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u])). But in node 1's case:\n\nf[u] after children is 7. l[u] is5. max(7,5) is7. Then min(r[u], 7) is min(5,7) =5. So f[u] is 5. Which is within the required range. Thus, the code would be:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    ll mx = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        mx = max(mx, f[v]);\n    }\n    if (l[u] > mx) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(mx, l[u]));\n    }\n} This code would handle the second sample correctly. Let's test it:\n\nTest case 2: Node 3: e[u] is empty. mx is 0. l[3] =7>0 \u2192 c increments to 1. f[3] = r[3] =7. Node 2: e[u] is empty. mx is 0. l[2] =3>0 \u2192 c increments to 2. f[2] =3. Node 1: e[u] has 2 and 3. mx is max(7,3) =7. l[1] is5 <=7. So f[u] = min(5, max(7,5)) \u2192 max(7,5)=7. min(5,7) =5. So f[u] is5. No increment. c remains 2. Thus, correct. Test case 1:\n\nNode 2: mx 0. l[2] =2>0 \u2192 c increments to 1. f[2] =2. Node 1: mx is2. l[1] =1 <=2. f[u] = min(1's r, max(2,1))= min(1's r (which is1), 2 \u2192 which is1? Or wait, wait. l[1] is 1, r[1] is1. So, max(mx, l[u]) = max(2,1) =2. min(r[u], 2) is min(1,2) =1. So f[u] is1. Which is within the required range. So the code works. Thus, the correct code for the DFS function is:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    f[u] = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v); if (f[v] > f[u]) {\n            f[u] = f[v];\n        }\n    }\n    if (l[u] > f[u]) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u]));\n    }\n}\n\nBut the code can be written more concisely. In the code, the initial f[u] is 0. Then, for each child v, we update f[u] to be the maximum of f[u] and f[v]. Then, if l[u] > f[u], we increment c and set f[u] to r[u]. Otherwise, we set f[u] to the minimum of r[u] and the maximum of f[u] and l[u]. Thus, the code for the DFS function is:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    f[u] = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        f[u] = max(f[u], f[v]);\n    }\n    if (l[u] > f[u]) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u]));\n    }\n}\n\nThis should be the correct code.",

Wait, perhaps the key is that for each node u, the sum of increments from operations that include any of its children must be >= the sum required by the children. So, for u, the sum must be at least the maximum of the sums required by its children. Because for each child v, the sum for v is the sum of increments from operations that include v (and hence u). For each such operation, the increment for u is <= the increment for v. So the sum of increments for u in those operations is <= the sum for v. But this implies that the sum for u from those operations is <= the sum for v. But the sum for u's own operations (those that include u but not any children) can be added to this. But how does this help? Alternatively, the required sum for u must be >= the maximum of the sums required by its children. Because the sum for each child is in [l_v, r_v], and the sum for u from the operations that include the child is <= the child's sum.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nWe have a rooted tree with vertex 1 as the root. Each vertex has a value a_v that starts at 0. We need to make sure that each a_v is between l_v and r_v. The operations allowed are choosing a path from root to some vertex v, then selecting a non-decreasing array of increments c_i for each node along the path, and adding c_i to each a_i. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the constraints for all nodes.\n\nHmm. The key is to model how the operations affect the nodes and find a way to cover all the required ranges with the least steps. Since each operation can affect a path from root to some node, and the increments are non-decreasing along the path, we need to find a way to model the necessary increments and determine how they can be combined in the fewest operations.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. Each operation's increments must form a non-decreasing sequence along the path. So, when you apply an operation on a node v, you add some c_1, c_2, ..., c_k (non-decreasing) to the path from root to v. The sum of these increments affects each node on the path.\n\nBut since the operations can be applied multiple times, maybe the optimal approach is to process the tree in a bottom-up or top-down manner, keeping track of the required ranges and how they can be covered with the minimal operations.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering each node and determining the minimal and maximal possible values that can be achieved based on the operations applied to it and its ancestors. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since each operation's increments are non-decreasing along the path, the increments at a deeper node (closer to the root) can't be less than those of the nodes below. So, when you perform an operation on a node v, the increments along the path must form a non-decreasing sequence. That suggests that the increments for higher (closer to root) nodes can't be smaller than those for lower nodes.\n\nWait, the path is from root to v, so the order is root (b_1) to v (b_k). So the c array is non-decreasing: c_1 <= c_2 <= ... <= c_k. So, when you apply this operation, each node along the path (starting from root) gets an increment that is at least the previous one.\n\nBut how does this affect the required a_v ranges?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the required a_v. Each operation contributes to the a_v along some path. Since the increments are non-decreasing, the total sum of increments along a path must be such that for each node on the path, the sum of increments (from all operations that include it) is within [l_v, r_v].\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe for each node, the minimal number of operations is determined by how much we need to adjust its value beyond what can be carried over from its parent.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each node, the increment applied to it must be at least the increments applied to its children. Because when you process a child's path, the increment at the parent (which is part of the path) must be <= the increment at the child. So, the parent's total increment from all operations must be <= the child's total increment from all operations. Wait, no. Because each operation's c array is non-decreasing. So, in each individual operation, when you select a path, the increments along that path are non-decreasing. But different operations can have different c arrays. So the sum of all c's for a node might not be non-decreasing along the path.\n\nWait, no. Each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path. So, the sum across all operations would be the sum of multiple non-decreasing arrays. But the sum of multiple non-decreasing arrays is not necessarily non-decreasing. So, this complicates things.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key insight is that the sum of all increments for a node must be >= the sum of all increments for its parent. Because each time you add a non-decreasing sequence along a path. For example, if you have a node u and its parent p. Any operation that affects u's path will also affect p. So in each such operation, the increment for p is <= the increment for u. Therefore, the total sum of increments for u is >= the sum for p. Because each time you add some c_i where c_p <= c_u. So sum(c_p over all ops including p) <= sum(c_u over all ops including u). But u's path may be part of multiple operations. So, the total sum for u is the sum of all c's from operations that include u. Similarly for p.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a path p -> u. If we apply an operation on u with c_p = 2 and c_u =3. Then another operation on p with c_p=4. Then the total for p is 2+4=6, for u it's 3. So 6>3. Which violates the sum_p <= sum_u. But that's allowed, but according to the problem's operations, each individual c array is non-decreasing. But the sum across operations can have sum_p > sum_u, which would not satisfy the sum_p <= sum_u. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the sum of the a_v's must be between l_v and r_v, but the sum of the increments (from all operations) must satisfy sum(c_p) <= sum(c_u) for all u's parent p. Because each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path, so in each operation, when you add c_p and c_u (with p being the parent of u along the path), then c_p <= c_u. So when you sum all such c_p and c_u across all operations, sum(c_p) <= sum(c_u). Because each term c_p_i (for operation i) is <= c_u_i in that same operation. So sum(c_p_i) over i <= sum(c_u_i) over i.\n\nAh, this is a crucial point. So the sum of all increments for a node u must be >= the sum of all increments for its parent p. Because each time p and u are part of the same operation, the increment for p is <= that for u. And if they are part of separate operations, then any operation that includes p but not u (but that's impossible because any path that includes p but not u would be a path from root to some node that's not u's descendant. But when you process u's parent p, the path is from root to p. So in such a case, u is not part of that path. So the increments for p in that operation would have c_p, and u is not part of that path. So the sum for p is increased, but u's sum remains the same. Therefore, the sum for p can be higher than u's sum. Wait, but this would violate the requirement that the sum for p must be <= the sum for u. Because in this scenario, sum_p could be higher than sum_u.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because according to the problem statement, each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path. So for any operation that includes p and u (if u is a descendant of p), then in that operation's c array, the increment for p (which is earlier in the path) is <= the increment for u. But if there are operations that include p but not u (like operations on p's other children), then those increments to p do not affect u. So the sum_p could be higher than sum_u, which would violate the sum_p <= sum_u.\n\nWait, but that's impossible. Because each node's sum is the sum of increments from all operations that include it. So for a parent p and child u, any operation that affects u must include p (since the path from root to u includes p). So in such operations, the c array's increment for p is <= that for u. But operations that affect p (but not u) are those that are on paths that include p but not u. For example, if p has two children u and v. An operation on v would affect the path from root to v, which includes p and v. So in that case, the increment for p (c_p) in that operation is <= the increment for v. But u is not part of that path, so u's sum is not affected. So for p's sum, this operation contributes c_p, but u's sum is not affected. So if in this operation, c_p is 5, then p's sum increases by 5, and u's sum remains. So sum_p could be larger than sum_u.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier logic that sum_p <= sum_u. So how is that possible? Because the problem's constraints only require that each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path for that operation. So the sum across all operations is allowed to have sum_p > sum_u, which would mean that the a_p could be higher than a_u. However, in the problem's desired state, each a_v is between l_v and r_v, but there's no requirement that a_p <= a_u. The l and r ranges for each node are independent.\n\nWait, but the problem's note gives an example where a_1 (the root) is 5, a_2 is 3, which is allowed because the l and r ranges for each are such that 5 is within the root's range. So the sum of increments for the parent can be higher than the child's. So my initial assumption was wrong. The sum of increments for a parent can be higher than that of a child, as long as each individual operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path. So, for example, an operation on p's path (root to p) can have a c array where the last element is 3. Then another operation on p's other child's path, where the c array is 4 (for p) and 5 (for the child). So sum_p is 3 +4 =7, and sum_child is 5. So sum_p (7) is greater than sum_child (5). But each individual operation's c arrays are non-decreasing. So that's allowed.\n\nSo the initial approach where sum_p must be <= sum_u is incorrect. Therefore, my earlier line of thinking was wrong.\n\nSo the problem is to find a way to assign increments to each node such that:\n\n1. For any operation, the c array is non-decreasing along the path.\n\n2. The sum of all increments for node v (a_v) is between l_v and r_v.\n\n3. The number of operations is minimized.\n\nSo the challenge is to model the constraints of the operations and find the minimal number of steps.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think in terms of the required a_v's. Since each a_v is the sum of increments from all operations that include v in their path. Each such operation contributes c_i to v, where c_i is part of a non-decreasing array along the path of that operation.\n\nSo, how can we model the required a_v's such that the increments can be represented as a sum of non-decreasing arrays along certain paths?\n\nHmm. Let's consider the increments from all operations. For each node v, the total increment a_v is the sum of c_i over all operations where v is on the path of the operation.\n\nEach operation's c array for its path is non-decreasing. So for each operation, along the path, the c_i's are non-decreasing.\n\nBut the sum of such c_i's across all operations must result in a_v >= l_v and a_v <= r_v.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of operations.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each node v, a_v must be in [l_v, r_v]. The a_v is the sum of all increments from operations that include v in their paths.\n\nEach operation can choose a path (from root to some node) and a non-decreasing c array for that path, adding c_i to a_{b_i}.\n\nThe minimal number of operations needed to reach the desired a_v's.\n\nBut how to model this. One possible approach is to find for each node the required increments that must be added, considering their positions in the tree. Since each operation's increments are non-decreasing along their path, the increments to a node can influence the possible increments to its ancestors.\n\nWait, perhaps a greedy approach is possible here. Let's process the tree in a post-order traversal. For each node, determine the minimal and maximal possible increments that can be applied to it, considering the constraints of its children.\n\nWait, here's an idea: each operation affects a path from the root to a node. The c array is non-decreasing. So, for a node v, the increments added to it in different operations can vary, but each time v is part of an operation's path, the c_i for v in that operation must be >= the c_i of the previous nodes in the path (i.e., ancestors of v). However, since each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path, the increments in that operation for the ancestors of v must be <= the increment for v in that same operation.\n\nBut when you combine multiple operations, the sum for v can be higher than the sum for its parent. For example, if in one operation you add c1 to parent and c2 to v (c1 <= c2), and in another operation you add c3 to parent and c4 to v (c3 <= c4), then the sum for parent is c1 + c3, and for v is c2 + c4. If c1 + c3 > c2 + c4, that's allowed.\n\nSo the sum for a parent can be larger than the child's sum. But during each individual operation, the increments for the parent and child (if they are in the path) are non-decreasing.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAnother thought: the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times we need to \"cover\" the required ranges for each node, considering that each operation can affect a path and the increments are non-decreasing along the path.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the required a_v must be the sum of some increments. Since each increment comes from a non-decreasing sequence along a path, for each node, the sum of increments from operations that include it must be at least the sum of the increments from operations that include its parent. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because different operations can contribute differently.\n\nWait, but each operation that includes the parent and the child (since the child is on the path) will contribute c_parent <= c_child in that operation. But operations that include the parent but not the child (like operations on the parent's path) will contribute to the parent's sum but not the child's.\n\nSo, for example, in operations that include the child, the parent's increment in that operation is <= the child's increment. But in operations that don't include the child, the parent's increment can be higher than the child's sum. So the total sum for the parent can be higher than the child's sum.\n\nThis complicates the problem. So how can we model the minimal number of operations?\n\nAnother approach: think of each node's required a_v as being covered by some set of increments, each of which is part of an operation. The constraints are that for each operation, the increments along the path are non-decreasing. The problem is to cover all nodes' a_v requirements with the fewest such operations.\n\nPerhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of nodes where the required increment can't be covered by the previous operations. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each operation can add a certain amount to a path, but the increments are non-decreasing. So, for each node, the maximum possible increment per operation is determined by the minimal required for the nodes below it.\n\nWait, here's a possible strategy. For each node, the required a_v must be at least the maximum a_u of all its children. Because, in any operation that includes u's path, the parent's increment in that operation is <= u's increment. So the sum of increments for the parent in that operation is <= sum for u in that operation. But other operations can contribute to the parent. But this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since each operation's increments are non-decreasing along the path, the minimal increments required for a node's children may influence how much we can increment the parent in that operation.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to process the tree in a post-order traversal. For each node, we track the minimal and maximal possible accumulated increments, and determine how many operations are needed based on overlapping ranges.\n\nWait, the code given has a DFS function. The variables c (which seems to count the number of operations) and f, which might be part of the solution. The code's DFS function is supposed to compute something that allows us to find the minimal number of operations.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe main function calls S() for each test case. S() builds the tree, reads l and r for each node, and then calls DFS(1). After that, it prints c, which is the answer for the test case.\n\nSo, the variable c is modified during the DFS. So the key is to determine what the DFS is doing.\n\nIn the sample input, in the first test case, after one operation, the answer is achieved. So the code's DFS must compute that.\n\nThe code's variables:\n\ne is the adjacency list for the tree (children).\n\nl and r are the ranges for each node.\n\nf might be some dynamic programming array that holds information for each node.\n\nSo, the DFS function must compute for each node the necessary information to determine the number of operations.\n\nThe approach might be:\n\nFor each node u, during DFS, we process all its children first. Then, we compute the minimal and maximal possible values for u's a_v, considering the constraints from its children.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the problem requires that a_v is between l_v and r_v. But each a_v is the sum of increments from all operations that include v in their paths.\n\nEach operation can add a non-decreasing sequence of increments along some path.\n\nPerhaps, for each node u, we need to determine the minimal number of operations required to cover the path from the root to u, such that the increments for u and its ancestors are non-decreasing in each operation, and the sum of increments for u is within [l_u, r_u], and similarly for the ancestors.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal number of operations required for a node u is determined by the maximum number of operations needed among its children, plus any additional operations required due to u's own constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is determined by how the ranges [l_u, r_u] of a node u and its children can be covered by non-decreasing sequences of increments.\n\nLet's think of each operation as adding a certain value to a path. Since each operation's increments are non-decreasing along the path, each such operation contributes to the nodes along the path in a way that the increment for a node is at least as much as the increments for its ancestors in that operation.\n\nSo, for a node u and its parent p, the sum of increments from all operations that include u (since each such operation's path includes p) will have, in each such operation, the increment for p is <= the increment for u. So the sum of increments from these operations for u is the sum of c_u's, and for p it's the sum of c_p's. Since c_p <= c_u in each of these operations, sum(c_p) <= sum(c_u).\n\nBut p can also be part of other operations (those that don't include u), where the increments for p can be any value, as long as they are part of a non-decreasing array for their respective paths.\n\nSo, sum(c_p) can be larger than sum(c_u) if p is part of other operations. But in that case, sum(c_u) is contributed only by operations that include u, and those operations' c_p's are <= c_u's.\n\nSo, for the node u's sum (a_u), it's equal to the sum of all c_u's from operations that include u. For the parent p, a_p is the sum of all c_p's from all operations that include p. But since some of those operations are on paths that don't include u, those contribute to p's sum but not u's.\n\nSo, a_p can be greater than a_u. So there's no requirement that a_p <= a_u.\n\nBut then, the problem allows that, as long as each individual operation's increments are non-decreasing along the path.\n\nThis complicates things. So how can we model the minimal number of operations required?\n\nPerhaps the key is to process the tree in such a way that, for each node, we determine the minimal and maximal possible increments that can be applied through the operations, and how these constraints affect the parent nodes.\n\nWait, here's an insight from the problem's sample explanation:\n\nIn the second test case, two operations are needed. The first operation is on vertex 2, with c = [3,3]. This sets a_1=3 and a_2=3, but a_3=0. Then, an operation on vertex 3 with c = [2,7] (assuming the path is 1->3?), but wait, the parent of 3 must be p_3 <3, which in the sample is probably 1. So the path is 1 and 3. The c array [2,7] adds 2 to a_1 and 7 to a_3. So after this, a_1=3+2=5, a_3=7. So each operation's increments are non-decreasing along their path.\n\nSo the sum for a_1 is 5, which is higher than a_3's sum (7). Wait, no: 5 <7. So in the second operation, the c array is [2,7], which is non-decreasing. So the sum for 1 is increased by 2, and for 3 by 7. So the sum for 3 (7) is greater than the sum for 1 (2 in this operation). So the total a_1 is 3+2=5, a_3 is 7. So in this case, the sum for a_3 (7) is larger than a_1 (5), which is allowed.\n\nBut how does the algorithm model this?\n\nAnother approach: think of each node's a_v as a sum that can be adjusted through multiple operations. The minimal number of operations required is determined by the nodes that require the most \"steps\" in their path.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: each operation can add a non-decreasing sequence to a path. The minimal number of operations is the minimal number of such sequences needed to cover all the required ranges for the nodes.\n\nThis sounds like a covering problem, but it's not obvious how to model it.\n\nPerhaps the solution involves greedily choosing the paths and their increments in such a way that each operation covers as much as possible.\n\nAnother idea: For each node, the minimal number of operations needed is determined by the difference between the required a_v and the sum provided by the operations on the parent nodes.\n\nWait, but this is vague.\n\nLooking for similar problems or standard techniques: The problem seems to involve constraints along the path from root to each node, with non-decreasing increments. This suggests that the required increments for a node must be at least those of its ancestors in the same operation. But since multiple operations can contribute, this complicates things.\n\nAnother possible approach: For each node u, the minimal number of operations required is determined by the required range [l_u, r_u] and the accumulated increments from the parent's operations.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think of each node u's required a_u as a sum of increments from operations on paths that pass through u. Each such operation contributes to u and all its ancestors. For the minimal number of operations, we want to maximize the contribution of each operation.\n\nPerhaps for each node u, the required a_u must be covered by some sum of increments from operations on paths that include u. Additionally, for each such operation, the increments along the path (root to u) must form a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nWait, but the same operation can include other nodes besides u. For example, if you choose a path that goes to a deeper node, then the increment for u's parent would be <= the increment for u in that operation.\n\nSo, the minimal number of operations is related to the number of nodes where the required range cannot be covered by the increments from the parent's operations.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible solution approach inspired by some tree-based dynamic programming:\n\nWe process the tree in a post-order traversal. For each node u, we determine the minimal number of operations needed to satisfy its constraints and the constraints of its children.\n\nEach node u has a range [L, R], which represents the possible total increments (a_u) that can be achieved. However, the choice of a_u must be such that in each operation that includes u, the increment for u's parent is <= the increment for u in that operation.\n\nBut since each operation's increments are non-decreasing along the path, the sum for the parent must be <= the sum for u in that operation. But the sum across all operations may vary.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of increments for the parent from all operations that include u (since u's path includes the parent) is <= the sum for u in those operations. But the parent can have additional increments from operations that don't include u.\n\nThis seems difficult to track.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to model for each node u the minimal and maximal possible increments that can be applied to it, considering the constraints of its children.\n\nLet's think recursively. For a leaf node, the required a_v must be between l_v and r_v. Each operation that affects the leaf's path (root to leaf) contributes to a_v. The increments for the leaf must be >= the increments for the parent in that operation.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the code's existing variables: The code uses f[u], which may represent the required increments for the node u, and during DFS, it accumulates the number of operations in variable c.\n\nThe sample input's first test case has a tree with two nodes: 1 and 2 (child of 1). The l and r for node 1 are (1,1), node 2 is (2,2). The solution is to choose v=2 and c=[1,2]. So a_1 becomes 1 and a_2 becomes 2. So the sum for the parent (1) is 1, and the child is 2. Each is within their ranges. So this is one operation.\n\nIn this case, the f array for node 1 would be 1, and node 2 would be 2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of operations?\n\nAnother sample: the second test case has three nodes. The solution is two operations. The first adds 3 to the root and 3 to node 2. The second adds 2 to root and 7 to node 3. So the root's sum is 3+2=5, which is within [5,5], assuming the root's l and r are 5.\n\nSo the minimal number of operations depends on how the required ranges can be covered by overlapping paths and their increments.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is to track for each node the minimal and maximal possible increments that can be achieved through the operations applied to it and its subtree. The number of operations is then the sum of the required operations for each node that cannot be covered by their parent's operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's DFS function is intended to compute for each node u the required number of operations based on the range [l_u, r_u] and the ranges of its children.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\nFor each node u, during DFS, we collect the minimal and maximal possible increments from its children. Then, the required increments for u must be such that it's >= the minimal required by the children (since increments in the path must be non-decreasing). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u, the required increment is determined by the maximum of the required increments from its children and its own [l_u, r_u] range.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet's think: when you process a node u, all of its children have already been processed. For each child v, the required increment for v is in [l_v, r_v]. But since the increments in the path to v include u, the increment for u in those operations must be <= the increment for v in the same operations.\n\nSo, for any operation that includes both u and v (which is every operation that includes v, since u is the parent), the increment for u in that operation is <= the increment for v in that operation. Therefore, the sum of increments for u from operations that include v is <= the sum for v. But u may have other operations that are not part of the path to v, which can contribute to u's sum.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimal number of operations such that the sum for each node is within its range. So, perhaps for each node u, the minimal number of operations required is the sum of the operations required by its children, plus any additional operations needed to cover u's own [l_u, r_u] range beyond what is contributed by the children's operations.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's the solution idea:\n\nFor each node u, after processing its children, we calculate the minimal and maximal possible values of a_u that can be achieved by the operations applied to u's subtree. The required a_u must be within [l_u, r_u]. So the minimal required is the maximum of the children's minimal a and l_u, and the maximal is the minimum of the children's maximal a and r_u. But this is a guess.\n\nWait, but each operation that contributes to a child's a will also contribute to the parent's a. So for example, if a child v requires a certain increment, then the parent u's increment in the same operations must be <= v's. So the parent's a is the sum of increments from all operations that include u. Some of those operations are on the paths to v and its siblings, and others are on paths to u's other descendants.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of nodes where the required range [l, r] is not covered by the ranges of their children.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let me look for hints in the code structure.\n\nThe code has a DFS function. Inside it, for each node u, we need to compute something and possibly update the global variable c.\n\nThe existing code variables:\n\n- e is the adjacency list for children.\n\n- l and r arrays are the ranges for each node.\n\n- f array: perhaps for each node, f[u] represents some value that contributes to the answer.\n\nThe code's main loop processes test cases, and for each test case, it builds the tree, reads l and r for each node, calls DFS(1), and then prints c.\n\nThe variable c is initialized to 0 in S().\n\nSo, during the DFS, c is being incremented to count the number of operations needed.\n\nThe key is to figure out what the DFS function is doing.\n\nLet's think of the following approach:\n\nFor each node u, during the DFS:\n\n- We process all children first.\n\n- For each child v of u, we need to ensure that the sum of increments in the path to v is such that a_v is in [l_v, r_v]. But since the path includes u, the increments for u in those operations must be <= those for v in the same operations.\n\n- The minimal number of operations for the subtree rooted at u is determined by the sum of operations required for each child plus any operations needed for u itself.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u, the minimal number of operations required is the sum of the operations required by all of its children, plus one if the current node's required range cannot be covered by the children's operations.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother possible approach:\n\nEach operation can be thought of as contributing a non-decreasing sequence of increments to a path. The minimal number of operations is equal to the number of nodes where the required a_v is not covered by the parent's a_v.\n\nWait, perhaps not. But the sample input shows that the root node's a is covered by an operation that also covers its child.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some tree-based problems where the answer is the number of leaves or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of nodes where the required lower bound l_v exceeds the upper bound of their parent's required range. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each operation as covering a path to some node. The minimal number of operations is the number of nodes where the required increment can't be achieved by the parent's increment in any existing operations.\n\nAnother possible approach is to model the problem as requiring that for each node u, the minimal number of operations is the maximum between the number of operations required by its children and the number of operations required by u's own constraints.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to model for each node u the required range [low, high] that must be satisfied by the sum of increments from operations on paths passing through u. Then, the number of operations is the sum of the required increments from the children.\n\nAlternatively, the code's DFS function is designed to calculate for each node u the number of operations required to cover its subtree, and accumulate this into c.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track for each node u the required range of a_u that must be satisfied, and if the current accumulated operations cannot cover this range, increment the operation count and adjust the range.\n\nWait, here's an idea from the code's possible variables: during DFS, for each node u, we track the maximum and minimum possible values that can be provided to u by the operations applied to its subtree. If these values are outside of [l_u, r_u], then we need to perform additional operations to cover this. Each such operation corresponds to a path to u, which allows us to set the a_u to a value in [l_u, r_u], and this may affect the parent nodes.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's think of each node's required a_u as needing to be in [l_u, r_u]. When processing a node u, after processing its children, we compute the range of possible a_u values that can be achieved by the operations applied to the children. If this range does not overlap with [l_u, r_u], then we need to add some operations to u's path to cover the required range. Each such operation contributes to a_u and its ancestors.\n\nBut how to compute the range.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u, we track the sum of increments required from the operations that include u. This sum must be between l_u and r_u. The increments from operations that include u must be >= the increments from operations that include u's children.\n\nWait, no. Because in an operation that includes u's child v, the increments for u are <= those for v in that operation. So the sum of increments for u from such operations is the sum of c_u_i for each operation that includes v. For each such c_u_i <= c_v_i. But the sum for u could be less than the sum for v.\n\nBut if u has multiple children, how does this affect the sum for u?\n\nAlternatively, for node u, the sum of increments from all operations that include u must be >= the maximum of the sums of increments from operations that include any of its children.\n\nBecause each operation that includes a child v also includes u. So for each such operation, the increment for u in that operation is <= the increment for v in that operation. So the sum for u from all operations that include v is <= the sum for v.\n\nBut u may have other operations that are not part of any child's path, which can contribute to u's sum.\n\nBut this makes it possible that the sum for u can be larger than any of the sums for its children.\n\nThis seems very complex.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to process each node in post-order and keep track of the minimal and maximal possible increments that can be applied to it through its children's operations, and then adjust these based on the node's own constraints.\n\nFor example, when processing node u:\n\n- We have already processed all its children.\n\n- The children's required increments impose that the increment for u in their operations must be <= their own increments.\n\n- So, for each child v, the sum of increments for u in the operations that include v is <= the sum for v.\n\n- But u's own required sum must be between l_u and r_u.\n\n- So, the minimal sum for u is the maximum between l_u and the maximum sum required by any of its children.\n\n- The maximal sum for u is the minimum between r_u and the sum of the child's maximal sum (but this might not be applicable).\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each node u, the sum of increments from operations that include any of its children must be >= the sum required by the children. So, for u, the sum must be at least the maximum of the sums required by its children. Because for each child v, the sum for v is the sum of increments from operations that include v (and hence u). For each such operation, the increment for u is <= the increment for v. So the sum of increments for u in those operations is <= the sum for v. But this implies that the sum for u from those operations is <= the sum for v. But the sum for u's own operations (those that include u but not any children) can be added to this.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, the required sum for u must be >= the maximum of the sums required by its children. Because the sum for each child is in [l_v, r_v], and the sum for u from the operations that include the child is <= the child's sum. So, if the sum for u is less than the child's sum, then the sum from the operations that include the child would not cover the child's required sum. Therefore, the sum for u must be at least the maximum of the children's sums.\n\nBut this is not necessarily true, because the sum for u can be higher than the children's sums through additional operations.\n\nWait, no. For example, the sum for u can be higher than the sum for its child v by adding operations that include u but not v. In those operations, the increment for u can be any value (as long as it's part of a non-decreasing sequence for the path chosen). So, for example, you can have a sum for u that is higher than v's sum.\n\nBut the problem requires that the sum for each node is between l_v and r_v. So, for u, the sum must be >= l_u and <= r_u. For v, it's >= l_v and <= r_v. There's no requirement that u's sum is >= v's sum. So u can have a sum lower than v's, as long as it's within its own l_u and r_u.\n\nSo the initial assumption that u's sum must be >= the maximum of its children's sums is incorrect.\n\nThis makes the problem even more challenging.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to realize that each operation can be applied to any path, and each such operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence of increments. The minimal number of operations is determined by the number of nodes that cannot have their required increments covered by their parent's increments.\n\nBut how to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code's variables:\n\nFor each node u, during the DFS, we compute the minimal number of operations required for the subtree rooted at u. We track for u the maximum of the required lower bound from its children and its own lower bound. Then, if this exceeds the upper bound, it's impossible (but the problem likely guarantees it's possible). The number of operations is the sum of the operations required for the children plus one if the current node's required range cannot be covered by the children's operations.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the code:\n\nThe variable c is initialized to 0 in S(), and during DFS, it's incremented. The answer is printed as c.\n\nSo, the DFS function must increment c for each required operation.\n\nThe key is to find the condition under which c is incremented during the DFS.\n\nIn the sample input, for the first test case, the DFS visits node 1 and node 2. For node 2, the l and r are 2, 2. During processing, it's determined that one operation is needed, which increments c to 1.\n\nFor node 1, the l and r are 1,1. The operation that includes node 2 also covers node 1's requirement.\n\nSo, the code must be structured such that when processing a node, if the sum of the required increments from the children is not sufficient to cover the node's own requirement, an additional operation is added.\n\nBut how.\n\nPerhaps, for each node u:\n\n- We first process all children.\n\n- We compute the required minimal and maximal increments for u based on the children's requirements.\n\n- If the required range for u [l_u, r_u] is not covered by the current range, we increment the operation count and adjust the range.\n\nThis is very vague.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible solution:\n\nEach time we process a node u, we collect the sum of the required operations from its children. Then, we check if the current node's [l_u, r_u] range is satisfied by the sum of increments from the children's operations. If not, we need to perform additional operations to cover the difference, and each such operation increments c.\n\nBut how to model the sum of increments.\n\nAlternatively, the code's f array might track the maximum required increment from the children. For example, f[u] is the maximum of the f[v] for all children v of u. Then, if the current node's l_u is greater than f[u], then we need to perform an operation that adds enough to the path to u to reach l_u. This would increment c by 1.\n\nIn this case, f[u] is the minimum possible increment required for u to satisfy the children's requirements and its own. So:\n\nFor a node u:\n\nf[u] = max(l_u, sum of children's f values?)\n\nNo. Because each child's f represents the required increment from their own operations, but the parent's increment must be <= the child's in those operations.\n\nSo, for each child v of u:\n\nThe operations on v's path must have increments for u <= increments for v. So the sum of increments for u from these operations is <= sum of increments for v from these operations.\n\nBut the sum for v must be >= l_v and <= r_v.\n\nSo, the sum for u from these operations is <= sum for v, which is >= l_v. So, sum for u from these operations is >= l_v if sum for v is exactly l_v. No, that's not correct. sum for u from these operations can be less than l_v.\n\nSo this approach might not work.\n\nAnother idea: For each node u, the required sum a_u must be at least the maximum of the l_v of its children. Because for each child v, the sum for v is >= l_v. And the sum for u from the operations that include v is <= the sum for v. So, the sum for u from these operations is <= sum for v >= l_v. So, sum for u from these operations can be less than l_v, which would require that sum for u must be supplemented by other operations.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's look for hints from existing solutions or similar problems. For example, the problem resembles the \"water the tree\" problem, where each operation can water a path from the root and requires that the number of operations is minimized.\n\nIn that problem, the solution involves a greedy approach: process the tree in a post-order manner, and for each node, if it hasn't been covered by the parent's operations, perform an operation on its path.\n\nInspired by that, perhaps the solution to this problem is similar:\n\nFor each node u, after processing its children, check if the required a_u can be achieved by the operations applied to its children's paths. If not, perform an operation on u's path, incrementing c by 1. The value of this operation's increment is chosen to satisfy the required a_u.\n\nBut how to determine the increment's value.\n\nAlternatively, during the DFS:\n\n- For each node u, keep track of the maximum required value among its children and u's own l and r.\n\n- If the maximum required value is greater than the current node's r, then it's impossible. But the problem guarantees a solution.\n\n- If the maximum required value is within the node's l and r, then no additional operations are needed.\n\n- Otherwise, if the node's l is greater than the maximum required value, then an additional operation is needed, and the increment is set to l.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAnother possible approach is that each node contributes one operation if its l is greater than the maximum l of its children. The number of operations is the number of nodes where l_u exceeds the maximum l of its children.\n\nIn the first sample, node 2's l is 2, which is greater than node 1's l of 1. So node 2 requires an operation, and node 1's l is covered by this operation. So the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second sample, node 3's l is 7. The parent (node 1) has l 5. Node 3 requires an operation, which contributes to node 1 and 3. Node 2's l is 3, which is covered by another operation. So total operations is 2.\n\nThis matches the sample inputs.\n\nSo the minimal number of operations is the number of nodes where l_u is greater than the maximum l of its children.\n\nWait, but how to handle the r constraints?\n\nIn this case, the solution is to compute for each node u the maximum of l_u and the maximum l_v of its children. If this maximum is greater than the current node's r_u, then it's impossible (but the problem says it's possible). Otherwise, the number of operations is the number of nodes where l_u > the maximum l_v of its children.\n\nBut in the first sample, node 2's children are none (leaf), so the maximum l_v is zero. node 2's l is 2, which is greater than zero, so it requires an operation.\n\nNode 1's children have maximum l_v of 2. node 1's l is 1, which is less than 2. So no operation is needed for node 1.\n\nTotal operations is 1.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\n- node 3 is a leaf. Its l is 7. No children, so maximum l_v is 0. So 7>0, so it requires an operation.\n\n- node 2's l is 3. Its children are none, so requires an operation.\n\n- node 1's children's maximum l is max(3,7) =7. node 1's l is 5. 7>5, so node 1's l is 5, but the maximum of children is 7. So node 1 requires no operation. So total operations are 2.\n\nThis matches the sample.\n\nSo this suggests that the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of nodes where the node's l is greater than the maximum l of all its children.\n\nThus, the solution is to count the number of nodes where l_u > max(l_v for v in children of u).\n\nSo, the code's DFS function should, for each node u, compute the maximum l among its children, and compare it with l_u. If l_u is greater than this maximum, then increment the operation count.\n\nSo, the code for the DFS function would be:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    ll max_child_l = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        max_child_l = max(max_child_l, l[v]); // Or perhaps f[v]?\n    }\n    if (l[u] > max_child_l) {\n        c++;\n    }\n    f[u] = max(l[u], max_child_l);\n}\n\nWait, but then what about the r constraints?\n\nBecause the problem requires that a_v <= r_v. So, even if the required l is satisfied, the r could be too small.\n\nBut the problem's input guarantees that a solution exists, so perhaps the condition l_u <= r_u and for each node u, the maximum of its children's l and its own l must be <= r_u.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nSo the code would need to check if the maximum l (from children and own) is <= r_u. If not, it's impossible, but the problem says the input is valid.\n\nSo, in the code's DFS, we compute the maximum of the children's l and compare with the current node's l. If the current node's l is larger, then we need an operation. The variable c is incremented in that case.\n\nThe f[u] stores the maximum between the node's l and the maximum of the children's l. This is passed to the parent to compute the same condition.\n\nThis approach seems to align with the samples.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nFor each node u:\n\n- Process all children.\n\n- Compute the maximum l among all children.\n\n- If l[u] > max_child_l: increment c (this node requires an operation).\n\n- Set f[u] = max(l[u], max_child_l).\n\nThus, the number of operations is the number of nodes where l[u] exceeds the maximum l of its children.\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach.\n\nTesting this against the samples:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nNode 2 is a child of 1. It has no children. max_child_l is 0. l[2] is 2>0: increment c (now 1). f[2] =2.\n\nNode 1's children's max_child_l is 2. l[1] is 1 <2: no increment. f[1] =2.\n\nSo c=1.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nNode 3: no children. l[3] =7>0: increment c (c=1). f[3]=7.\n\nNode 2: no children. l[2] =3>0: increment c (c=2). f[2]=3.\n\nNode 1: children max_child_l is max(7,3)=7. l[1] =5 <7: no increment. f[1] =7.\n\nSo c=2.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the missing code in the DFS function is:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    ll max_l = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        max_l = max(max_l, f[v]);\n    }\n    if (l[u] > max_l) {\n        c++;\n    }\n    f[u] = max(l[u], max_l);\n    if (f[u] > r[u]) {\n        f[u] = r[u]; // This line might be necessary to handle cases where the maximum exceeds r[u], but the problem guarantees it's valid.\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the a_v must be <= r_v. So, even if the required maximum is greater than r_v, we must cap it at r_v. But the problem states that it's possible to find a solution, so this condition must hold.\n\nBut in the code, after computing f[u] as max(l[u], max_l), we need to ensure that it doesn't exceed r[u]. Because the a_v is the sum of increments, and it must be <= r[v]. So, if the required f[u] (which is the minimal required to cover the children and own l) is greater than r[u], then it's impossible. But the problem's input guarantees that it's possible.\n\nSo, in the code, perhaps the f[u] should be the minimum between max(l[u], max_l) and r[u].\n\nBut how?\n\nIn the code's DFS, after calculating f[u] as max(l[u], max_l), we need to set it to min(f[u], r[u]). Because even if the required is higher than r[u], the a_v cannot exceed r[u].\n\nWait, but this might lead to a contradiction. For example, if the max_l is 5, and l[u] is 3, but r[u] is 4. Then, the required f[u] is 5, but r[u] is 4. So it's impossible. But the problem says the input is valid, so such cases won't exist.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nCompute f[u] = max(l[u], max_l).\n\nBut then, we need to check if f[u] exceeds r[u]. If so, it's impossible. But since the problem guarantees a solution, we can assume that this is not the case.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps the code sets f[u] to the minimum of (max(l[u], max_l), r[u]).\n\nBut in the samples, the f[u] is max(l[u], max_l), and this is within the r[u] range.\n\nFor example, in the first sample:\n\nf[2] is 2, r[2] is 2.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nNode 3's f is 7, r is 7.\n\nNode 2's f is 3, r is 3.\n\nNode 1's f is 7, but according to the second sample's input, what is node 1's r?\n\nIn the second sample, the node 1's l and r are probably 5 and 5.\n\nWait, the second sample's input:\n\nAfter the first operation, a_1 is 3, and the second operation adds 2, making it 5. So the l and r for node 1 must be 5.\n\nSo for node 1, f[u] is 7, but r[u] is 5. This would imply that the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut according to the previous code, node 1's f would be 7, which is larger than its r of 5, which is invalid.\n\nSo, there's a problem with this approach.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. Because in the second sample, node 1's f would be 7 (max of its children's f, which are 3 and 7). But node 1's r is 5. So according to the code, this would set f[u] to 7, which exceeds r[u], which is impossible.\n\nBut in reality, the correct solution for the second sample allows node 1's a_v to be 5, which is within the [5,5] range.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the initial approach?\n\nThe initial approach assumes that the required f[u] is the maximum between the children's f and the node's l. But this may exceed the node's r, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the correct approach must consider both the lower and upper bounds.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to track the required a_u as a value that must be between l_u and r_u, and also >= the maximum of the children's required a_v.\n\nBecause the sum of increments for u must be >= the sum of increments for v (from the operations that include v's path) for each child v.\n\nBut the sum of increments for u from those operations is <= the sum for v. So, the sum for u must be >= the sum for v's required l_v.\n\nWait, no. The sum for v is >= l_v. The sum for u from the operations that include v is <= the sum for v. So, the sum for u from those operations is <= sum for v >= l_v. So, sum for u from those operations can be less than l_v, which would require additional operations for u.\n\nBut the sum for u must be >= l_u.\n\nSo, the sum for u must be at least the maximum between l_u and the sum of increments from operations on its children's paths.\n\nBut this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to compute for each node u the minimal required a_u, which is the maximum between l_u and the minimal required a_v of all children. And the maximal allowed a_u is the minimum between r_u and the maximal required a_v of all children.\n\nBut this may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the required a_u must be at least the maximum l_v of its children, and at least l_u, and at most the minimum r_v of its children and r_u.\n\nBut this is not correct.\n\nAnother approach inspired by the problem's samples and the code's structure:\n\nEach operation on a node v contributes to the path from root to v. The increment for each node in the path is non-decreasing. So, the increment for the root in this operation is <= the increment for the child.\n\nBut the sum of increments for the root from all operations can be higher than the sum for the child if there are other operations.\n\nBut the problem requires that a_v is between l_v and r_v.\n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is determined by the nodes where their l_v is higher than the maximum of the l_v of their children.\n\nBut in the second sample, node 1's l_v is 5, and the maximum of its children's l_v is 7 (from node 3). So node 1's l_v is 5, which is less than 7. So according to the initial approach, node 1 would not require an operation, and the sum for node 1 would be 7. But node 1's r is 5, which is impossible.\n\nThis indicates that the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, the code must take into account both the l and r constraints.\n\nThus, the correct approach must track for each node u the required a_u, which is between l_u and r_u, and also >= the required a_v of all children.\n\nBut since the required a_v for the children is between l_v and r_v, and the required a_u must be >= a_v (from the operations that include the child's path), but a_u can be anything >= l_u and <= r_u.\n\nBut this is not necessarily the case. For example, a_u can be higher than a_v if there are other operations contributing to a_u.\n\nBut the problem requires that each a_v is within [l_v, r_v]. So, a_u must be between l_u and r_u, and a_v must be between l_v and r_v. There's no direct constraint between a_u and a_v.\n\nSo, the initial approach of counting nodes where l_u > max child l is incorrect, as it doesn't account for the upper bounds.\n\nThus, the correct approach must consider both lower and upper bounds.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\nFor each node u, during DFS:\n\n- Collect the minimal and maximal required a_v for all children.\n\n- The required a_u must be >= the maximal lower bound of the children (max_l), and <= the minimal upper bound of the children (min_r).\n\n- Also, a_u must be within [l_u, r_u].\n\n- The combined range for a_u is [max(max_l, l_u), min(min_r, r_u)].\n\nIf this range is valid (max <= min), then the required a_u can be chosen from this range. The number of operations is determined by whether the current node's l is greater than the maximal lower bound of children.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u:\n\nWe compute the maximum of the children's minimal required a_v (which is their l_v), and the minimal of the children's maximal allowed a_v (their r_v).\n\nThen, a_u must be >= max(l_u, max_children_l) and <= min(r_u, min_children_r).\n\nIf this range is valid, then a_u can be chosen within it. If not, it's impossible (but the problem says it's possible).\n\nThe number of operations is the number of nodes where the node's l_u is greater than the max_children_l. Because each such node requires an additional operation to cover its l_u.\n\nBut again, this doesn't handle the upper bound.\n\nBut how to handle the upper bound.\n\nFor example, if the children's min_r is less than the node's l_u, then it's impossible.\n\nBut the problem states that a solution exists, so this case is not present.\n\nThus, the code must:\n\nFor each node u:\n\n- Compute the max_l as the maximum l_v of all children.\n\n- Compute the min_r as the minimum r_v of all children.\n\n- The required a_u must be >= max(l_u, max_l), and <= min(r_u, min_r).\n\nBut this is not correct, because the node's a_u is not directly constrained by the children's r_v.\n\nThe children's a_v can be up to their r_v. The node's a_u can be up to its r_u, but this is independent of the children's r_v.\n\nSo the previous approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the solution must be more nuanced.\n\nAfter struggling to find the correct approach, I recall that the correct solution is to count the number of nodes where the lower bound l_u is greater than the maximum lower bound of all children. This is because each such node requires an operation to cover its own lower bound, which is not covered by the children's operations.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't account for the upper bounds. But the problem's sample where node 1's required a is 5, but the max children's l is 7, and the node's own r is 5, which is impossible. So the previous approach is wrong.\n\nBut the sample shows that node 1's a is 5, which is within [5,5], and the children's a are 3 and 7. So, this must be possible because the operations are structured such that the parent's a is covered by operations that are not part of the children's paths.\n\nAh! Here's the key insight: Each node's a_v is the sum of increments from all operations that include v in their path. So, for node 1 in the second sample, the two operations are:\n\n1. Operation on node 2: increments [3,3]. This contributes 3 to node 1 and 3 to node 2.\n\n2. Operation on node 3: increments [2,7]. This contributes 2 to node 1 and 7 to node 3.\n\nSo, a_1 is 3+2=5, which is within [5,5]. a_3 is 7, which is within [7,7]. a_2 is 3, within [3,3].\n\nIn this case, node 1's a is 5, which is covered by the two operations. The max_l for node 1's children is max(3,7) =7. But node 1's l is 5, which is less than 7. But according to the initial approach, node 1's required a is the max between l_u (5) and max_children_l (7), which would be 7. But node 1's a is 5.\n\nThis contradicts the initial approach.\n\nThus, the initial approach is wrong. So there must be a different way to model the problem.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the sample:\n\nThe required a_v for each node can be achieved by a combination of operations. The minimal number of operations is the number of leaves, plus any nodes where the required a_v is not covered by parent operations.\n\nBut this doesn't seem right.\n\nAnother possible idea: For each node, the required a_v is determined by its own l_v and r_v, and the required a_v of its parent. For example, a_v must be >= a_parent. Because each operation that includes v's path also includes the parent, and the increment for the parent is <= the increment for v in that operation. So the sum for the parent from those operations is <= the sum for v.\n\nBut wait, this is only true for the sum contributed by operations that include v. The parent's sum can include other operations that do not include v, which can have higher increments.\n\nBut the sum for the parent's a is the sum of all increments from all operations that include the parent. This includes operations that include the parent but not v (like operations on other children).\n\nThus, the parent's sum can be higher than the sum for v.\n\nSo, there's no constraint that a_parent <= a_v.\n\nThis complicates the problem.\n\nGiven that the code's existing variables and structure must be filled in, and the correct answer for the sample requires counting the nodes where l_u is greater than the maximum l of children, but the sample contradicts this, it's possible that the correct approach is to track for each node the maximum of the children's f and compare it with the node's l. If the node's l is greater than this maximum, increment c. But also, the f[u] is set to the maximum between l[u] and the children's f. However, if this maximum exceeds the node's r, then f[u] is set to r[u].\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    f[u] = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        f[u] = max(f[u], f[v]);\n    }\n    if (l[u] > f[u]) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u]));\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this needs to be adjusted. For example, in the second sample:\n\nNode 3's f is 7 (l is 7, which is >0, so c increments. f becomes r[3] =7.\n\nNode 2's f is 3 (l=3>0, c increments, f becomes 3.\n\nNode 1's f is max(7,3) =7. l[1] is 5 <=7. So no increment. f[1] is min(r[1], max(7,5)) \u2192 if r[1] is 5, then f[1] is 5.\n\nBut how does this happen?\n\nSo, the code would set f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u])).\n\nBut in node 1's case:\n\nf[u] after children is 7. l[u] is5. max(7,5) is7. Then min(r[u], 7) is min(5,7) =5.\n\nSo f[u] is 5. Which is within the required range.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    ll mx = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        mx = max(mx, f[v]);\n    }\n    if (l[u] > mx) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(mx, l[u]));\n    }\n}\n\nThis code would handle the second sample correctly.\n\nLet's test it:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nNode 3: e[u] is empty. mx is 0. l[3] =7>0 \u2192 c increments to 1. f[3] = r[3] =7.\n\nNode 2: e[u] is empty. mx is 0. l[2] =3>0 \u2192 c increments to 2. f[2] =3.\n\nNode 1: e[u] has 2 and 3. mx is max(7,3) =7. l[1] is5 <=7. So f[u] = min(5, max(7,5)) \u2192 max(7,5)=7. min(5,7) =5. So f[u] is5. No increment. c remains 2.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nNode 2: mx 0. l[2] =2>0 \u2192 c increments to 1. f[2] =2.\n\nNode 1: mx is2. l[1] =1 <=2. f[u] = min(1's r, max(2,1))= min(1's r (which is1), 2 \u2192 which is1? Or wait, wait. l[1] is 1, r[1] is1.\n\nSo, max(mx, l[u]) = max(2,1) =2. min(r[u], 2) is min(1,2) =1. So f[u] is1. Which is within the required range.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the correct code for the DFS function is:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    f[u] = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        if (f[v] > f[u]) {\n            f[u] = f[v];\n        }\n    }\n    if (l[u] > f[u]) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u]));\n    }\n}\n\nBut the code can be written more concisely.\n\nIn the code, the initial f[u] is 0. Then, for each child v, we update f[u] to be the maximum of f[u] and f[v].\n\nThen, if l[u] > f[u], we increment c and set f[u] to r[u]. Otherwise, we set f[u] to the minimum of r[u] and the maximum of f[u] and l[u].\n\nThus, the code for the DFS function is:\n\nvoid DFS(ll u) {\n    f[u] = 0;\n    for (auto v : e[u]) {\n        DFS(v);\n        f[u] = max(f[u], f[v]);\n    }\n    if (l[u] > f[u]) {\n        c++;\n        f[u] = r[u];\n    } else {\n        f[u] = min(r[u], max(f[u], l[u]));\n    }\n}\n\nThis should be the correct code."
