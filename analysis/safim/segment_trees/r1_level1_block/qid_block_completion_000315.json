Then, in the loop, for each element after the zero (until the next zero), we add their values to a temporary sum. For each step, we update the hashmap with this temporary sum's occurrence. The most frequent sum in the hashmap is then used to decide what x should be. The count is increased by the frequency of this most common sum. So, the code inside the while loop (the one with the comment) should be:\n\nsum += current element, then update the hashmap with the sum's count. Then, check if this sum is the most frequent. Then, move index2 forward. Also, handle the first iteration (since 'fist' is true initially, the loop runs once even if index2 is still at index). Wait, the loop condition is: while (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) ! = 0)). So the loop runs at least once (fist is true initially), then continues while index2 hasn't hit the end and the element is not zero. So the loop processes the elements starting at index (the current zero's position) and goes until the next zero or end, but including those elements. Wait, no.

Then, for each element after the zero (index+1, index+2, etc.), we add their a_i to the sum. So the total sum up to position k is (S + x) + sum_{index+1 to k} a_i. We want this to be zero for as many k as possible. So x can be set to - (S + sum_{index+1 to k} a_i ), but we can only choose one x.

So for each index2 in the block (after the current zero), the sum from index+1 to index2 is computed, and the frequency is tracked. But how to compute that sum? Perhaps the code needs to accumulate the sum incrementally. For example, initialize a variable currentSum to zero. Then, for each index2 starting from index+1, currentSum += lst.get(index2), and then update the hashmap with currentSum.\n\nBut in the code's loop, index2 starts at index. So in the first iteration, index2 is index (current zero). Then, after processing, index2 is incremented. Then, the loop processes elements from index+1 to next zero. So perhaps the code's missing part is:\n\ncurrentSum += lst.get(index2);\nthen, update the hashmap with currentSum.\n\nBut wait, currentSum should start at zero, then accumulate elements from index+1 onwards. So in the first iteration (index2=index), adding lst.get(index2) (which is the current zero) would be wrong. So perhaps there is a mistake here, and the loop should start at index+1.

But in the code's current loop structure, index2 starts at index. So to accumulate the sum of elements starting from index+1, the code needs to start adding elements from index+1. So inside the loop, the first element processed would be index+1. But how? The code's loop starts with index2 = index, and in the first iteration (fist is true), the code processes index2=index, then increments index2. So the code's first iteration of the loop is for index2=index, but then index2 is incremented, and the next elements are processed. Ah, so the code's loop processes index2 starting at index, but during the first iteration (when fist is true), the code processes index2=index (the current zero), then increments index2 to index+1. Then, the loop continues processing index2+1, etc., until a zero is found. So the code's loop starts with index2=index, but during the first iteration, it's just a dummy run to enter the loop. Then, the code processes index2 starting from index+1. But what is done during the first iteration? In the code's loop, the missing code is inside the while loop. So during the first iteration (fist is true), the code processes index2=index. But since the element at index2=index is the current zero (before replacement), which is being replaced, perhaps the code should not process it. So during the first iteration, perhaps the code doesn't add anything to the hashmap, but just moves index2 to index+1.",

Alternatively, maybe the code's sumOfBlock is initialized to 0 outside the loop, and inside the loop, for each index2 >= index+1, the code adds lst.get(index2) to sumOfBlock and updates the hashmap. So here's the plan for the missing code: Initialize sumOfBlock to 0 outside the loop. Inside the loop:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n   sumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\n   hm.put(sumOfBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumOfBlock, 0L) + 1); if (hm.get(sumOfBlock) > hm.get(mostFreq)) {\n       mostFreq = sumOfBlock;\n   }\n}\n\nBut how to handle index2=index and index2=index+1.\n\nAlternatively, in the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1, but does not process any elements. Then, in the next iterations (index2=index+1, index+2, etc.), the code processes the elements. But how to do that in the code. Let's think. The code could have:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 ! = index) {\n   // process the element\n} But since the loop starts with index2=index, and in the first iteration, fist is true, but the code checks if index2 is not index to process the elements. Alternatively, the code could have:\n\nsumOfBlock starts at 0. Inside the loop:\n\nif (index2 != index) {\n   sumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\n   hm.put(sumOfBlock, ...);\n} But this would skip the index2=index element (current zero) and start adding elements from index+1. So in the code's missing part, the code could have:\n\nsumOfBlock += lst.get(index2); But since index2 starts at index, and the current zero is being replaced, adding it would be wrong. So maybe the code should start accumulating from index+1.",

So perhaps the code should start accumulating sumOfBlock from index+1. Therefore, inside the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1, and then starts adding elements. But how to manage this. Perhaps the code should process the elements starting from index+1. So during the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1, and then processes the elements from index+1 onwards. So the code inside the loop could be:\n\nif (index2 ! = index) {\n    sumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumOfBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumOfBlock, 0L) +1); if (hm.get(sumOfBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumOfBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nBut how to handle the first iteration. Alternatively, the code could initialize sumOfBlock to 0, and inside the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), for index2=index+1 and onwards:\n\nsumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\nthen update the hashmap. But how to structure this. Let's see. Perhaps the missing code is:\n\nlong currentSum = 0;\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) ! = 0)) {\n    if (!fist) {\n        currentSum += lst.get(index2);\n        hm.put(currentSum, hm.getOrDefault(currentSum, 0L) + 1); if (hm.get(currentSum) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n            mostFreq = currentSum;\n        }\n    }\n    fist = false;\n    index2++;\n} Wait, but fist is set to false after the first iteration. So in the first iteration (fist is true), the code does not process the element. Then, in subsequent iterations (fist is false), the code processes index2 by adding to currentSum. But this would start processing from index2=index+1, which is correct. So currentSum is the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Then, the code adds currentSum to the hashmap.",

So in the first iteration, the code doesn't process the element (index2=index). Then, in the next iterations, index2 is incremented, and the code processes index2=index+1, etc. So the missing code would track the currentSum as the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Then, the hashmap is filled with the frequencies of currentSum. The most frequent currentSum is chosen. The count is increased by the frequency of that sum, and the sum variable is updated to sum + (-sum - mostFreq) = -mostFreq. Then, index is set to index2. But how is currentSum initialized?",

So how to structure the loop to do that. The code's current loop structure is:\n\nindex2 = index\nfist = true\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) ! = 0)) {\n   ...\n   fist = false\n   index2++\n}\n\nBut in this setup, the first iteration processes index2=index, then increments to index+1. Then, the loop continues. So inside the loop, during the first iteration (fist is true), the code can process index2=index, but then ignore it, and process index2=index+1 onwards. But how?\n\nPerhaps the code's missing part is:\n\nInside the loop: if (!fist) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, ...);\n    // update mostFreq\n}\n\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nThis way, during the first iteration (fist is true), the code does nothing. Then, in subsequent iterations, when fist is false, the code processes index2. But this way, the first iteration processes index2=index, but does nothing. Then, index2 is incremented to index+1. Then, in the next iterations, the code processes index2=index+1, etc. So the missing code would be:\n\nif (!fist) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1); if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nBut how is sumBlock initialized? Before the loop, sumBlock should be 0. So, before the loop, add:\n\nlong sumBlock = 0; Then, the code inside the loop:\n\nif (!fist) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nThis way, sumBlock starts at 0, and during the first iteration (fist is true), nothing is added. Then, index2 is incremented to index+1, and the loop continues. The next iterations process index2=index+1, index+2, etc., adding their elements to sumBlock and updating the hashmap. This seems correct. In the first test case example:\n\nAfter the current zero (index=1), the elements are 1, -1, 0. But during processing, the loop will process index2=1 (fist=true, so no processing), then index2=2 (sumBlock += 1 \u2192 sumBlock=1), add to hm. Then index2=3 (sumBlock += -1 \u2192 0), add to hm. Then index2=4 (element is 0, loop stops. So hm will have 1 \u2192 1 occurrence, 0 \u2192 1 occurrence. The most frequent is either 1 or 0 (tie). The code chooses the first occurrence. Then, count += 1 (the frequency). But the example expects 3. So this suggests that the code is missing something. Wait, no. Because in the example, after replacing the zero at index=1 with x=-2, the sum up to index=1 is 2 + (-2) = 0. Then, adding elements 1 and -1 gives sum up to index=2: 0 + 1 =1, index=3: 0+1-1=0, index=4: 0+1-1+0=0. But according to the code's logic, the sumBlock would be the sum of elements from index+1 (2) to index2. For index2=2, sumBlock=1. For index2=3, sumBlock=0. So the most frequent sum is 1 and 0 each with frequency 1. So the code would choose one of them (say, 1), and count +=1. Then, sum is set to -mostFreq = -1. But then, after processing, the code adds sum += -mostFreq (sum becomes 2 -1 = 1). Then, when processing further elements, the sum would be 1 + 1 (element at index=2) = 2, then 2 + (-1) =1, then 1 +0=1. So no additional zeros. But this doesn't align with the example. So perhaps the code's approach is not correct. Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the problem. Let's re-examine the problem statement. The score is the number of indices i where the sum of the first i elements is zero. When we replace a zero at index, we can choose x such that sum up to index is zero. Then, when processing the elements after, if their sum adds up to zero again, those positions would also count. In the example, after replacing index=1 (zero) with -2:\n\nsum up to index=1: 2 + (-2) = 0 \u2192 count +=1.\n\nsum up to index=3: 2 + (-2) +1 + (-1) =0 \u2192 count +=1. sum up to index=5 (the last element): 0 +0 =0 \u2192 count +=1.\n\nTotal 3. So how does the code's approach count these? In the code's current approach, after replacing the zero at index=1 with x=-2, the code processes the elements from index+1 (index=2) to index=4 (next zero). The sumBlock is the sum of elements from index+1 (2) to index2. For index2=2 (element 1), sumBlock=1. For index2=3 (element -1), sumBlock=1-1=0. The code would track these sums. The most frequent sum is 1 and 0 (each once). So the code would choose either, say 0. Then, x is set to -(sum + 0) = -(2 +0) =-2. This creates sum up to index=1 as zero. Then, when adding elements after, the sum up to index=3 (index=3) is zero (sum + x + sumBlock) \u2192 2 + (-2) + (1-1) =0. But sumBlock here is zero. So the code's count increases by the frequency of sumBlock=0, which is 1. Then, sum becomes sum + x + sumBlock (2 + (-2) + 0 =0. But then, the code proceeds to process the next elements, which include the next zero at index=4. But perhaps the code's approach is to count each occurrence where the sum of the elements after the replaced zero is equal to the most frequent sum, thereby creating zeros at those positions. So in the example, after replacing the zero at index=1 with x=-2, the sum up to index=1 is zero (count +=1). Then, the sum up to index=3 is zero (count +=1), and the sum up to index=4 (the next zero) is zero (count +=1). So how does this happen. But according to the code's approach, the sumBlock in the first block (from index=1 to index=4) would be:\n\nelements are 1, -1, 0 (the zero at index=4 is not part of this block, because the loop stops when a zero is encountered). So the sumBlock for index=2 (element 1) is 1. For index=3 (element -1) sumBlock is 0. So the most frequent sum is 1 and 0 (each once). So the code chooses the most frequent (one of them), say 0. Then, the count is increased by 1 (the frequency of 0). Then, sum is updated to sum + (-sum - mostFreq) \u2192 sum was 2 (sum up to index-1=0), so sum = 2 + x \u2192 x = -sum - mostFreq \u2192 x = -(2 +0) \u2192 x =-2. So sum becomes 0. Then, the code processes the next zero at index=4. When processing the next zero (index=4), the sum is zero. So when the code enters that block, it processes elements from index=4 onwards. The sum up to index=4-1 (index=3) is zero. So the code would create another block here. But the element at index=4 is zero, and the code can replace it. So for this block, the sum up to index=4-1 is zero. The sum of the elements after index=4 is none (since it's the end of the array). So the code would add 1 to the count (since replacing the zero at index=4 with x=0 would make the sum up to index=5 (assuming the array is 5 elements long) to be zero. But the example's array has 5 elements. So in the code's processing, after the first block (index=1), the sum is zero. Then, when processing the next zero (index=4), the code enters the block again. The sum is zero (sum up to index=4-1=3). The code's loop processes elements from index=4. During the first iteration (index2=4), fist is true.",

So this is a problem. But in reality, the code's initial mostFreq is sum (0). hm is empty, so hm.get(0) is null. So the code would throw an error. To prevent this, the code should initialize the hashmap with sum (mostFreq) with a frequency of zero. So the code would add:\n\nhm.put(mostFreq, 0L); So in the code block after creating the hashmap:\n\nhm.put(mostFreq, 0L);\n\nThen, during the loop, the code would process elements and increment frequencies. But the existing code does not do this. So perhaps the code needs to initialize the hashmap with sum's frequency as zero. But given the code provided, this is not done, which could lead to null pointer exceptions. But the code's sample input may not hit this case. For example, in the first test case, after processing index=4, the code would have hm as empty. So hm.get(mostFreq) is 0, but how? Assuming that the code's mostFreq is initialized to sum (0), and the hashmap is empty, hm.get(0) would return null. So adding count += hm.get(mostFreq) would throw a null pointer exception. To avoid this, the code should use getOrDefault. But in the code's existing code, the count += hm.get(mostFreq) would have to be changed to count += hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L). But in the existing code, the line is:\n\ncount += hm.get(mostFreq);\n\nThis would throw a null pointer exception if the hashmap is empty. But given that the code is provided and we have to fill in the missing part, perhaps the code's missing part is as follows, and the code's other parts have been adjusted to handle this. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed. The correct code to fill in the missing part is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut with the following explanation: this code adds the current element to sumBlock and updates the hashmap.",

But the loop starts at index. So the code must process index+1, index+2, etc. until next zero. So the code's loop should process index2 from index+1 to next zero. But the loop's current structure starts at index and processes until next zero. So to skip the current zero's element, the code must start processing from index+1. Therefore, inside the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1 and processes from there. But how to do this in the code. The missing code could be:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nThis way, during the first iteration (index2=index), the code skips processing. Then, for index2=index+1, the code processes. But to implement this, the code would need to check if index2 is greater than index. However, this requires that the loop increments index2 even during the first iteration. So, the code inside the loop:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\n\nBut this adds the current zero's element to sumBlock. Which is incorrect. Hmm. Given the time constraints and the fact that the code's missing part is in the while loop, perhaps the correct code to fill in is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this will process the current zero's element (index) in the first iteration, which is incorrect. So the sumBlock will include the zero, which is not part of the elements after the zero. So this will lead to incorrect results. But according to the sample input, this approach would not work.

But given that we have to fill in the missing code, perhaps the correct approach is to start the sumBlock from zero and add elements from index+1 to index2. But the code's loop starts at index. So how to achieve this. The solution is to, inside the loop, check if index2 is greater than index. If so, add to sumBlock. So the missing code could be:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1); if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this requires initializing sumBlock to zero before the loop. So inside the code block where the zero is found:\n\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>();\nlong mostFreq = sum;\nint index2 = index;\nboolean fist = true;\nlong sumBlock = 0;\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) ! = 0)) {\n    if (index2 > index) {\n        sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n        hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n        if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n            mostFreq = sumBlock;\n        }\n    }\n    fist = false;\n    index2++;\n}\n\nThis way, sumBlock accumulates the elements from index+1 onwards. For example, in the first iteration (index2=index), index2 is not greater than index, so nothing is added. index2 increments to index+1. In the next iteration, index2=index+1, which is greater than index, so sumBlock += lst.get(index+1), and so on.\n\nThis correctly accumulates the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Then, the hashmap tracks the frequency of these sums. The most frequent sum is chosen. The count is increased by the frequency of that sum. Then, x is set to -(sum + mostFreq), so that sum + x + sumBlock =0 for all occurrences of sumBlock = mostFreq. This should solve the problem. So the missing code is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut only if index2 > index. But the code must check if index2 is greater than index before adding to sumBlock. So the code inside the loop is:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1); if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this requires that sumBlock is initialized to 0 before the loop. So the complete code for the missing part is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++; But with the condition that this is only done for index2 > index. Wait, no. The code as written would process all index2 >= index, but the if condition skips index2=index. Therefore, the code must be:\n\nsumBlock is initialized to 0.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut how to implement this. So in the code's missing part, the code would have:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1); if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this would process index2=index, leading to sumBlock including the current zero. Which is incorrect. So the correct code must have a condition to skip index2=index. But given that the code's loop starts at index, the correct code for the missing part is:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut how to initialize sumBlock and other variables. The code inside the zero block should be:\n\nHashMap< Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>();\nlong mostFreq = sum;\nint index2 = index;\nboolean fist = true;\nlong sumBlock = 0;\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) ! = 0)) {\n    if (index2 > index) {\n        sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n        hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n        if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n            mostFreq = sumBlock;\n        }\n    }\n    fist = false;\n    index2++;\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is the code inside the loop that checks if index2 is greater than index, and if so, adds the current element to sumBlock, updates the hashmap, and checks for the most frequent sum. So the code to fill in the missing part is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut only if index2 > index. But the code as written does not have the condition. Therefore, the code is incorrect. But given the time constraints and the code structure, perhaps the correct answer is to add the following code inside the loop:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this would include the current zero's element in sumBlock.",

Then, the count would be 2 (frequency of 0) plus 1 (sum up to index=1). So the total count would be 3, which matches the example. Wait, let's see: In the example, after the zero at index=1:\n\nsum is 2 (sum up to index=0). index2 starts at 1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nsumBlock is initialized to 0.

Second iteration (fist is false):\n\nindex2=2 >1 \u2192 sumBlock += 1 \u2192 sumBlock=1. hm.put(1, 1). mostFreq is 2 (sum up to index-1=2). So hm.get(1)=1 is not >0.

So hm has 1 \u21921, 0\u21921. mostFreq is 0. count += hm.get(mostFreq) \u2192 hm.get(0) is 1. count becomes 1.\n\nsum is updated to sum + (-sum - mostFreq) \u2192 2 + (-2 -0) \u21920. index is set to index2=4. Then, processing index=4, which is a zero. So enter the loop again. sum is 0 (sum up to index-1=3). create hm, mostFreq=0. index2=4. fist=true. loop runs once:\n\nindex2=4. sumBlock starts at 0. if index2>4? No. So no addition. fist becomes false. index2 increments to5, which is beyond array size. So loop ends. count += hm.get(0) \u2192 hm is empty.",

But given the code structure, the missing code must be written with a check to exclude the current zero's element. Thus, the correct code is:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut how to implement this in the code. In the code's missing part, we need to add:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    long current = lst.get(index2);\n    sumBlock += current;\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut given that the code must be written in the missing part, and the code's loop structure, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this would include the current zero's element. Which is incorrect. So the code would not work for the sample input. Thus, the correct answer must involve processing elements after the current zero. But given the code structure provided, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this code would include the current zero's element, leading to incorrect results. Thus, the correct answer is to fill in the loop with:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this is the only code that fits into the given code's structure, even though it may have errors. However, according to the sample input, this code may not work, but perhaps the code's other parts account for this. After further analysis, perhaps the code's initial sum is sum up to index-1. Then, when the current zero is replaced by x, the sum becomes sum + x. The elements after the zero are then added to this sum. Thus, the sum of elements from index+1 to index2 is sumBlock. So x is chosen such that sum + x + sumBlock =0 \u2192 x = -sum - sumBlock. The code tracks the sumBlock (sum of elements from index+1 to index2) for each index2 in the block. But the code's loop includes the current zero's element (index) in sumBlock, which is sumBlock = sum of elements from index to index2.",

Then, in the outer loop, index=5 is >= arrSz, so loop ends. Then, the code's count is 2 +1 =3, which matches the sample. Yes! Because after processing the first block (index=1), count is increased by 2. Then, when processing index=4, the code's loop processes index2=4 (current zero), sumBlock becomes 0. hm.get(0) is 1. count +=1. Total count is 3.

But the code's sumBlock includes the current zero's element (index), which is replaced. So this is incorrect. But in the example, this code works. So perhaps the code's approach is correct despite this. But why?\n\nBecause when the current zero's element is included in sumBlock, sumBlock becomes the sum of elements from index (current zero) to index2. But after replacing the zero with x, the sum up to index2 is sum (sum up to index-1) +x (replaced zero) + sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Which is the same as sum +x + (sumBlock - lst.get(index)). Because sumBlock includes the current zero's element (index) which is replaced. But lst.get(index) is zero. So sumBlock -0 = sum of elements from index+1 to index2. So sum up to index2 is sum +x + (sumBlock -0). So setting x = -(sum + sumBlock) would make the sum up to index2 zero. So the code's approach is to find sumBlock (sum of elements from index to index2), then x is set to -(sum + sumBlock). Thus, the sum up to index2 is sum +x + (sumBlock - lst.get(index)) \u2192 sum + (-sum - sumBlock) + (sumBlock -0) = 0. So this approach works. Thus, the code's approach is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what code to add to the Java program to solve this problem. Let's read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about maximizing the score of an array after performing certain operations. The score is the number of indices i where the sum of the first i elements is zero. The allowed operations are changing any zero in the array to an arbitrary integer. We can do this multiple times. The goal is to find the maximum possible score after these operations.\n\nHmm. So the approach here is to find how we can adjust the zeros in the array to create as many prefix sums equal to zero as possible. Let's think about how the zeros can be manipulated. Each zero can be replaced with any value, which allows us to adjust the prefix sums at certain points.\n\nLet me look at the existing code structure. The code processes each test case. For each element in the array, when a zero is encountered (lst.get(index) == 0), they create a hashmap. Then there's a while loop that runs while either it's the first iteration (fist is true) or index2 hasn't reached the end and the next element is not zero. Inside this loop, the code is missing. The idea here is probably to collect all possible sums between consecutive zeros and find the most frequent sum, so that replacing the zero with a value that cancels that sum will create the maximum number of zero prefixes in that segment.\n\nWait, the code's structure might be handling the array in segments between zeros. Each time a zero is encountered, they look ahead to the next zero (or end of array) to process a block. For each such block, the existing code uses a hashmap to track the frequency of cumulative sums. The most frequent sum in that block determines how many times a zero can be inserted (by replacing the current zero) to create prefixes that sum to zero.\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose between two zeros (or between a zero and the end), there are elements. The sum of elements up to the first zero (before replacement) is S. When we replace that zero with some value x, the new sum after the zero becomes S + x. Then, for each position in the next block (until the next zero), the cumulative sum from the start up to that position is S + x + sum of elements in the block up to that point. We want to choose x such that as many of these sums as possible are zero. So x would be chosen to be the negative of the sum up to a certain point. The idea is to find the sum value that occurs most frequently in the block, set x such that S + x is the negative of that sum, thereby maximizing the number of times the cumulative sum becomes zero in this block.\n\nSo the code's missing part is where, for each element in the current block (from index to the next zero), we calculate the sum and track the frequency in the hashmap. Then, the most frequent sum in the hashmap gives how many times we can have a zero prefix by setting x appropriately.\n\nSo in the loop where index2 is moving, we need to accumulate the sum of elements from the current zero's position (or after it?) to index2. Wait, the initial sum before the loop is 'sum', which is the cumulative sum up to the current zero (index). Then, in the loop, for each element after the zero (until the next zero), we add their values to a temporary sum. For each step, we update the hashmap with this temporary sum's occurrence. The most frequent sum in the hashmap is then used to decide what x should be. The count is increased by the frequency of this most common sum.\n\nSo, the code inside the while loop (the one with the comment) should be:\n\nsum += current element, then update the hashmap with the sum's count. Then, check if this sum is the most frequent. Then, move index2 forward. Also, handle the first iteration (since 'fist' is true initially, the loop runs once even if index2 is still at index).\n\nWait, the loop condition is: while (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0)). So the loop runs at least once (fist is true initially), then continues while index2 hasn't hit the end and the element is not zero. So the loop processes the elements starting at index (the current zero's position) and goes until the next zero or end, but including those elements. Wait, no. Because the loop starts with index2 equal to index. But index is the position of the zero. So the first element processed is index2 = index (the zero). Wait, but in the code, when we find a zero (index), the code enters this block and initializes index2 to index. Then, the while loop runs as long as either it's the first iteration (fist is true) or index2 hasn't reached the end and the next element is not zero.\n\nWait, in the while loop, after processing the first iteration (fist becomes false), then it checks if index2 is less than arrSz and the element is not zero. So the loop will process elements starting from index (the zero's position) until the next zero (exclusive), but including the elements after the initial zero? Wait, but the initial element is the zero (index). So the first element in the loop is the zero. But since the code is in the block where a zero was found, perhaps the code is processing the elements after the zero. But maybe not. Maybe the code is considering the zero as the start of a new segment. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the initial sum is the cumulative sum up to the current index (which is a zero). Then, when we process this zero, we can replace it with any value. The idea is that the sum after replacing this zero (sum += x, since the original value is zero, adding x is equivalent to replacing it). Then, the next elements (from index + 1 onwards) contribute to the sum. The code is trying to find the best x to set so that the sum up to some positions in this segment (after the replaced zero) become zero as much as possible.\n\nSo, the code's approach here is: for the current zero (at index), process all the elements starting from index+1 until the next zero (exclusive). Because the loop starts with index2 = index. Let's see:\n\nWait, index is the current zero's position. Then, index2 starts at index. The loop condition is: fist is true (so first iteration runs). Then, inside the loop, after processing, index2 is incremented. Then, the next iterations run as long as index2 hasn't reached the end and the next element is not zero. So the loop processes index2 starting from index (the current zero), then index +1, etc., until the next zero. Wait, but the elements after the current zero (index) are non-zero (since the next zero would be the next index to process in the outer loop). So the code is processing all elements from the current zero's position up to but not including the next zero.\n\nWait, but the initial zero (index) is being processed. But the element at index is zero, which would be replaced. So when processing the elements after the zero, the code should start at index + 1. So perhaps the code is handling this by starting index2 at index and then incrementing it. Wait, maybe the code is incorrect. Let me see.\n\nWait, the original code when it encounters a zero (index) starts a loop where index2 starts at index, and the loop runs as long as index2 is in the array and the element is not zero (after the first iteration). So, the first element in the loop is the zero (index). Then, after the first iteration, index2 is incremented. Then, the loop continues until a zero is found. But in the elements after index, there might be other zeros. So this loop is processing a block that starts at index (the current zero) and ends before the next zero (or end of array). But the elements between the current zero and next zero (if any) are non-zero. Wait, no. Because in the outer loop, when index is processed, it's the current zero. The code replaces it. Then, after processing the block up to the next zero, the code sets index to index2 (which would be the next zero's position). So each zero is processed in turn.\n\nBut how does this loop process the elements after the current zero? Because in the loop, index2 starts at index (the current zero). The code processes index2 as part of the loop. Then, during the first iteration, fist is set to false, and the loop checks if index2 is in the array and the next elements are not zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is structured such that when a zero is found (at index), the code processes all elements from index to the next zero (including index). But index is a zero, which is being replaced. So the loop starts at index, and in the first iteration, processes the zero (which is being replaced), then index2 increments. Then, the next elements are processed until the next zero is found. But perhaps this is not correct. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should start processing elements after the zero. Because the zero at index is the one being modified. So the elements after it (index+1, etc.) are part of the next block. So the loop should start at index+1 and process until the next zero. But in the code, index2 starts at index. So maybe the code is incorrect here, but perhaps the missing code is intended to handle the elements after the current zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct as is. Let's try to see what needs to be done in the missing part.\n\nIn the while loop for index2:\n\nWe need to calculate the cumulative sum for the elements in the current block (from index to next zero), but considering that the zero at index can be replaced. The idea is that the sum up to the zero (before replacement) is S. Then, when we replace the zero with x, the sum becomes S + x. Then, each subsequent element's sum will be (S + x) + a_{index+1} + ... + a_{k}.\n\nBut to create a zero sum at any position in this block (from index to next zero), we need (S + x) + (sum of a_{index+1} to a_{k}) ) = 0. So x can be chosen as -(S + sum of a_{index+1} to a_{k} ), for some k. To maximize the number of such positions, we need to find the sum of a_{index+1} to a_{k} that occurs most frequently, then set x to -(S + that sum). Then, each occurrence of that sum will result in a zero at position k.\n\nBut in the code, when we process the block, we need to compute the sum of each possible prefix in this block (from index to next zero). The initial sum is S (sum up to index-1, since the zero at index is being processed). Then, when we replace the zero with x, the sum becomes S + x. Then, for each element after the zero (index+1, index+2, etc.), we add their a_i to the sum. So the total sum up to position k is (S + x) + sum_{index+1 to k} a_i. We want this to be zero for as many k as possible. So x can be set to - (S + sum_{index+1 to k} a_i ), but we can only choose one x. To maximize the number of k, we need to find the sum_{index+1 to k} a_i that occurs most frequently. Then x = - (S + target_sum). Thus, the number of times the sum becomes zero is the frequency of target_sum.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to track all possible sums that can be achieved in the current block (sum of a_i from index+1 to k, for each k). Then, the most frequent sum in this collection will determine how many zeros we can add.\n\nBut how do we compute these sums? Let's see. The initial sum before the current zero is 'sum' (which is the sum up to index-1, since index is the zero). Then, in the block (from index to next zero), we can have a variable that accumulates the sum from the current zero's position (index) onwards. Wait, but the current zero can be replaced. So the sum after replacing the zero is sum + x (since sum was up to index-1, then adding the new x at index). Then, adding the next elements (index+1, etc.) gives the cumulative sum.\n\nSo the code needs to calculate the sum of elements from index+1 to k for various k. Because the sum up to k would be sum + x (from replacing the zero) plus the sum of elements from index+1 to k.\n\nBut in the code, the current sum (before processing the zero) is 'sum' (sum up to index-1, since index is the zero). Then, when processing the block (from index to next zero), the code is going to calculate the sum of elements from index onwards. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake. Because the zero is at index, which is being replaced. So the sum up to index is sum (up to index-1) plus x (the new value). So the sum of elements from index+1 to k would be added to sum + x. Therefore, the sum up to k is sum + x + (sum of elements from index+1 to k). But the elements from index+1 to k are part of the array and not changed. So the sum of elements from index+1 to k is a fixed value once we process those elements.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to compute for each possible k (from index to next zero) the sum of elements from index+1 to k. Wait, but the code is processing from index (the current zero) to next zero, but the elements after index may include non-zero elements.\n\nWait, the code is replacing the zero at index. So the elements after index (index+1, etc.) are part of the array. So in the code's loop, index2 starts at index (the current zero), then moves forward. So for each index2 in this loop, the code needs to accumulate the sum of elements starting from index (the current zero) to index2. But since the zero is replaced by x, the sum up to index2 would be sum (sum up to index-1) + x (the new value) + sum of elements from index+1 to index2. But since x can be set to any value, the sum up to index would be sum + x, and the sum from index+1 to index2 is the sum of the original elements. So the total sum up to index2 would be sum + x + (sum of elements from index+1 to index2).\n\nWe need this sum to be zero. So x can be set to -(sum + sum_of_elements_from_index_plus_1_to_index2). Then, for each index2 in this block, if x is set in this way, the sum up to index2 becomes zero. But we can only choose x once. So to maximize the number of such index2, we need to find the sum_of_elements_from_index_plus_1_to_index2 that occurs the most times. Then, x is set to -(sum + target_sum), which makes all those index2 positions sum to zero.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to compute the prefix sums starting from index (the current zero) and track their frequencies. Wait, no. Because the sum_of_elements_from_index_plus_1_to_index2 is the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. But that's equivalent to the prefix sum up to index2 minus the prefix sum up to index. So the code can track these differences.\n\nAlternatively, in the loop for index2, we can compute a current sum that starts at zero (for the elements after the current zero). So, after replacing the zero at index, the sum for index is sum (up to index-1) + x. Then, each element after index adds to this. So the sum for index2 (>= index) is sum + x + sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2.\n\nBut sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2 is the same as (prefix_sum[index2] - prefix_sum[index]). So during the loop, the code needs to compute this sum.\n\nBut perhaps the code uses a running total. Let's see.\n\nIn the code's loop for index2:\n\nInitially, sum is the cumulative sum up to index-1 (since when we encounter a zero at index, we enter this block). Then, the code creates a hashmap and starts processing elements from index to the next zero.\n\nWait, but the code's sum variable is the cumulative sum up to the previous elements. So when index is the zero's position, sum is up to index-1. So for the elements after index, when we process them, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\nLet's say that after replacing the zero at index with x, the sum becomes sum + x. Then, adding the elements at index+1, index+2, etc. So for each index2 >= index, the sum up to index2 is sum + x + (sum of elements from index to index2-1). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is that when a zero is found at index, the code enters this block. The code then looks at the elements from index onwards, until the next zero. For each of these elements (starting at index), the code calculates the cumulative sum as part of the block. But how?\n\nPerhaps, the code's current approach is that after replacing the zero, the sum up to index is sum (sum up to index-1) plus x. Then, each element after index contributes to the sum. The code needs to compute for each possible position in this block (from index onwards) the required sum that would make the prefix sum zero.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the example given in the problem.\n\nIn the first test case, the array is [2,0,1,-1,0]. The optimal change is to replace the second element (0) with -2, resulting in [2,-2,1,-1,0]. The score is 3. The prefixes are:\n\ni=2: 2 + (-2) =0.\n\ni=4: sum of first 4 elements is 0.\n\ni=5: sum of all 5 elements is 0.\n\nSo the code's approach should find that in the block after the first zero (index 1, assuming zero-based or one-based?), the elements after the zero are 1, -1, 0. Wait, but the original array is [2,0,1,-1,0]. So when processing the first zero (index 1 in zero-based), the code would process elements from index 1 (the zero) to the next zero (index 4). The elements in between are 1, -1. The sum after replacing the zero (index1) with x is sum (which is 2 up to index0) plus x. Then, the sum for index1 (after replacement) is 2 + x. Then, adding the elements 1 and -1: sum becomes 2+x +1, then 2+x+1-1 = 2+x. Then, the next zero is at index4.\n\nSo in this block (from index1 to index4), the possible positions where the sum could be zero are at index1, index2, index3. The code needs to find the x that allows as many of these positions as possible to sum to zero.\n\nFor the sum at index1 (after replacement): 2 +x =0 \u2192 x =-2. This gives one position.\n\nFor the sum at index2 (2+x+1=0 \u2192 x =-3), this is another possibility.\n\nAt index3 (2+x+1-1=0 \u2192 x= -2. So for x=-2, the sums at index1 and index3 are zero. So choosing x=-2 gives two positions. But in the example, the code counts three positions. Oh wait, the example includes the sum up to index5 (the last element, which is zero). So perhaps the code's approach is considering the sum up to the next zero as part of the current block.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic for the hashmap is to track the cumulative sum of elements from the current zero (index) onwards. Wait, no. Because after replacing the zero, the sum becomes sum (sum up to index-1) plus x. Then, each element after index is added to this. So for each element in the block (from index+1 onwards), the sum is sum + x + (sum of elements from index+1 to k). So the code's approach is to compute all possible sum values of (sum_of_elements_from index+1 to k) for all k in this block, and then find the most frequent such sum. Then, set x to -(sum + mostFreqSum), so that sum + x + mostFreqSum =0. Then, each occurrence of mostFreqSum in the block contributes to a zero prefix.\n\nTherefore, in the code's loop, when processing elements from index2 (starting at index), we need to compute the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. But wait, index starts at index (the current zero). So index+1 is the next element. So for each index2 in the loop (starting from index), the code processes elements after index. But perhaps the code is processing the elements from index to the next zero, but excluding the zero at index (since it's being replaced). So the loop starts at index, but the first element is the zero, which is replaced. So the elements after the zero (index+1, etc.) are processed.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's loop starts at index (the zero) and processes all elements from index onwards until the next zero. But since the element at index is a zero (before replacement), which can be changed, perhaps the code is processing the elements after the zero. So when the code starts processing index2=index, the element is zero (original value), but after replacement, the code would ignore it. So perhaps the code's loop is a bit off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct as follows: when the code enters the block for a zero at index, it looks ahead to the next zero (or end). For the elements in between, including the current zero (which can be modified), the code calculates the possible sums. But how?\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile (fist || index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0) {\n\n}\n\nInitially, fist is true, so the loop runs once. Then, index2 is incremented. Then, the loop continues as long as index2 is within bounds and the element is not zero.\n\nSo for example, in the first test case's initial zero (index=1), the loop starts with index2=1 (the zero). Then, fist is false. So the loop runs again if index2 is within bounds and lst.get(index2) is not zero. But lst.get(1) is zero, so the loop breaks after the first iteration. But that's not correct. Wait, maybe the code is supposed to process the elements after the zero. So there's a mistake here. Because in the code's current structure, when index2 is index (the current zero), the loop runs once (since fist is true), then index2 is incremented. Then, the loop checks if index2 < arrSz and lst.get(index2) != 0. So in the first example, after index=1 (zero), index2 starts at 1. Then, fist is true, so the loop runs. Then, inside the loop, we process index2=1 (zero), then set fist to false. Then, index2 is incremented to 2. Then, check if 2 < 5 and lst.get(2) is 1 != 0 \u2192 loop continues. Then, process index2=2. Then index2 becomes 3. Check again. Then, index2=4 (element is 0), so the loop stops. So in this case, the loop processes index2=1 (the current zero), then 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is the next zero). So index2 increments from 1 to 2, 3, 4. Then, when index2 is 4, lst.get(4) is zero, so the loop stops. So the code's loop processes index2=2 and 3 (elements 1 and -1) in the first example.\n\nBut how is that handled in the code? The code's loop is supposed to process the elements after the current zero. Because the current zero (index) is being replaced. So the elements after index (index+1, etc.) are processed.\n\nBut in the code's current setup, the loop starts at index (the current zero). So perhaps the code is including the current zero's position in the processing. But since the current zero can be replaced, perhaps the sum needs to account for that.\n\nHmm. Maybe the code's loop is incorrect, but since the code is provided and we have to fill in the missing parts, perhaps the missing code is supposed to process the elements after the current zero. So perhaps the code inside the loop should start accumulating the sum from index+1 onwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is intended to process all elements from index (current zero) to the next zero (exclusive), and the sum is computed as the sum of elements from index onwards. But since the current zero can be replaced, the code is considering that sum as part of the block.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's think about what the code needs to do in the missing part.\n\nInside the loop, for each index2, the code should accumulate the sum of the elements from index (current zero) up to index2. But wait, the current zero is being replaced, so those elements after the current zero (index+1, etc.) are the ones that contribute to the sum. So the code should accumulate the sum starting from index+1 to index2.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's see. The code has a variable sum, which up to the current zero (index) is sum up to index-1. Then, when processing the current zero, the code's block is entered. Then, the code creates a hashmap, sets mostFreq to sum (initial sum up to index-1). Then, index2 starts at index, and the loop runs.\n\nBut the elements from index to index2 (inclusive) are part of this block. But since the current zero is at index, which is being replaced, the code needs to compute the sum of the elements after the current zero. So perhaps, for each index2 in the loop, the code should compute the sum of elements from index+1 to index2.\n\nWait, but the code's sum variable is the sum up to index-1. So when processing the elements after the current zero (index), the code can compute the sum for each position in the block as follows:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2.\n\nThis current_sum is the sum of elements after the current zero (index) up to index2. So for each index2, current_sum is a new value. Then, the code can track the frequency of current_sum. The most frequent current_sum will determine how many zeros can be created by replacing the current zero with x, such that sum (sum up to index-1) + x + current_sum = 0 \u2192 x = -sum - current_sum.\n\nTherefore, the code's missing part should compute current_sum as the sum from index+1 to index2, for each index2 in the block. Then, in the hashmap, the code increments the count for current_sum. The most frequent current_sum is chosen, and the count is added to the total.\n\nSo in the code's loop, for each index2:\n\ncurrent_sum += lst.get(index2)\n\nBut wait, starting from index+1. So perhaps in the code, after replacing the current zero, the elements from index+1 to index2 are summed. So the code should accumulate the sum starting from index+1.\n\nBut in the code's loop, index2 starts at index (current zero). Then, in the first iteration, index2 is index (current zero). Then, index2 increments. So the loop processes index2 from index to next zero, but the elements processed are index+1, index+2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's loop is structured such that index2 starts at index, but inside the loop, we process the elements after index. So for each index2 in the loop, we process the element at index2, but only after incrementing index2. Or maybe the loop is processing index2 as the next element after the current zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process elements starting from index+1, and the loop is designed to process each element from index+1 until the next zero. But how?\n\nLet's think. The loop starts with index2 = index. Then, fist is true, so the loop runs once. Inside the loop, the code processes index2, then increments index2. Then, the loop checks if index2 is within array and element is not zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is supposed to process elements from index onwards, but since the first element is the current zero (which is being replaced), the code ignores it. So the code's loop is processing the elements after the current zero. For example, in the first test case's first zero (index=1), the loop processes index2=1 (current zero) in the first iteration, but since fist is true, it enters the loop. Then, the code processes this index, but how? Because the current zero is being replaced, perhaps the sum for the block starts from index+1. So in the first iteration (index2=index), the code processes the elements after index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is intended to start processing elements from index onwards, but since the current zero can be replaced, the code is supposed to include the current zero's position in the sum.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look at the code again.\n\nThe code, when encountering a zero at index, initializes the hashmap. Then, enters a loop with index2 starting at index and runs while fist (true) or index2 is in array and element is not zero.\n\nInside this loop, the code has to process each element from index to the next zero (exclusive). But the current zero is being replaced. So the sum for the block is the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. So for each index2 in the block (after the current zero), the sum from index+1 to index2 is computed, and the frequency is tracked.\n\nBut how to compute that sum? Perhaps the code needs to accumulate the sum incrementally. For example, initialize a variable currentSum to zero. Then, for each index2 starting from index+1, currentSum += lst.get(index2), and then update the hashmap with currentSum.\n\nBut in the code's loop, index2 starts at index. So in the first iteration, index2 is index (current zero). Then, after processing, index2 is incremented. Then, the loop processes elements from index+1 to next zero.\n\nSo perhaps the code's missing part is:\n\ncurrentSum += lst.get(index2);\nthen, update the hashmap with currentSum.\n\nBut wait, currentSum should start at zero, then accumulate elements from index+1 onwards. So in the first iteration (index2=index), adding lst.get(index2) (which is the current zero) would be wrong. So perhaps there is a mistake here, and the loop should start at index+1.\n\nBut given the code structure, perhaps the code's missing part should handle this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's initial index2 is index, and the first iteration (fist) is to process the element at index+1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example. Suppose the array is [0,1,2,0]. The current zero is at index 0. The code enters the loop, index2 starts at 0. The loop runs once (fist is true). Then, index2 increments to 1. Then, the loop runs while index2 < n and elements are not zero. So for index2=1 (element 1), which is not zero. Then index2=2 (element 2). Then index2=3 (element 0, so loop stops. So the code processes index2=0,1,2. But the currentSum would include the element at index0 (the zero being replaced), which is not part of the elements after the current zero. So this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, there's a mistake in the code's loop structure. But since we have to fill in the missing code, we need to work with what's given.\n\nWait, the code's initial sum is the sum up to index-1. So when the current zero is replaced by x, the sum becomes sum + x. Then, the elements after the zero (index+1, etc.) are added to this new sum. So the sum up to index2 (after the current zero) is sum + x + sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2.\n\nWe want this sum to be zero. So sum + x + sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2 = 0 \u2192 x = -sum - sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2.\n\nTo maximize the number of index2 where this is true, we need to choose x such that sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2 is the same for as many index2 as possible. So the code needs to track all possible sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2 values for index2 in the current block (from index+1 to next zero). The most frequent sum in this collection determines the best x.\n\nTherefore, the code's loop should iterate over index2 from index+1 to next_zero-1, accumulating the sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2 for each index2, and tracking their frequencies.\n\nBut in the code's current loop structure, index2 starts at index. So to accumulate the sum of elements starting from index+1, the code needs to start adding elements from index+1. So inside the loop, the first element processed would be index+1.\n\nBut how? The code's loop starts with index2 = index, and in the first iteration (fist is true), the code processes index2=index, then increments index2. So the code's first iteration of the loop is for index2=index, but then index2 is incremented, and the next elements are processed.\n\nAh, so the code's loop processes index2 starting at index, but during the first iteration (when fist is true), the code processes index2=index (the current zero), then increments index2 to index+1. Then, the loop continues processing index2+1, etc., until a zero is found.\n\nSo the code's loop starts with index2=index, but during the first iteration, it's just a dummy run to enter the loop. Then, the code processes index2 starting from index+1. But what is done during the first iteration?\n\nIn the code's loop, the missing code is inside the while loop. So during the first iteration (fist is true), the code processes index2=index. But since the element at index2=index is the current zero (before replacement), which is being replaced, perhaps the code should not process it. So during the first iteration, perhaps the code doesn't add anything to the hashmap, but just moves index2 to index+1. Then, in the next iterations, the code processes index2 from index+1 to next zero.\n\nBut how to handle this in the code? Let's see. The code has:\n\nwhile (fist || index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0) {\n   // missing code\n}\n\nIn the first iteration, fist is true. So the loop body is executed. After processing, fist is set to false, and index2 is incremented. So the first iteration processes index2=index, then increments to index+1. Then, in the next iterations, index2 starts at index+1 and processes until a zero is found.\n\nSo in the first iteration, perhaps the code should not add anything to the hashmap. So the missing code could be:\n\nsumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumOfBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumOfBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumOfBlock) > hm.get(mostFreq)) {\n    mostFreq = sumOfBlock;\n}\n\nBut wait, sumOfBlock should start at 0. So during the first iteration (index2=index), sumOfBlock would be 0 + lst.get(index) (the current zero), but since we are replacing this zero, the sum from index+1 is the sum of elements after. So perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's sumOfBlock is initialized to 0 outside the loop, and inside the loop, for each index2 >= index+1, the code adds lst.get(index2) to sumOfBlock and updates the hashmap.\n\nSo here's the plan for the missing code:\n\nInitialize sumOfBlock to 0 outside the loop.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n   sumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\n   hm.put(sumOfBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumOfBlock, 0L) + 1);\n   if (hm.get(sumOfBlock) > hm.get(mostFreq)) {\n       mostFreq = sumOfBlock;\n   }\n}\n\nBut how to handle index2=index and index2=index+1.\n\nAlternatively, in the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1, but does not process any elements. Then, in the next iterations (index2=index+1, index+2, etc.), the code processes the elements.\n\nBut how to do that in the code. Let's think. The code could have:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 != index) {\n   // process the element\n}\n\nBut since the loop starts with index2=index, and in the first iteration, fist is true, but the code checks if index2 is not index to process the elements.\n\nAlternatively, the code could have:\n\nsumOfBlock starts at 0.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 != index) {\n   sumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\n   hm.put(sumOfBlock, ...);\n}\n\nBut this would skip the index2=index element (current zero) and start adding elements from index+1.\n\nSo in the code's missing part, the code could have:\n\nsumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\nBut since index2 starts at index, and the current zero is being replaced, adding it would be wrong. So maybe the code should start accumulating from index+1.\n\nAlternatively, the code should initialize a variable, say currentSum, to 0, and for each index2 in the loop, starting from index+1, add to currentSum.\n\nBut how to structure this. Let's see.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nsumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumOfBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumOfBlock, 0L) +1);\nif (hm.get(sumOfBlock) > hm.get(mostFreq)) {\n    mostFreq = sumOfBlock;\n}\n\nindex2++;\n\nBut sumOfBlock is initialized to 0 before the loop. Then, in the first iteration (index2=index), which is the current zero, sumOfBlock becomes 0 + 0 (since the element is zero). Then, this is added to the hashmap. But that's wrong. Because the current zero is being replaced, so the sumOfBlock should be sum of elements after the current zero.\n\nSo perhaps the code should start accumulating sumOfBlock from index+1. Therefore, inside the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1, and then starts adding elements.\n\nBut how to manage this. Perhaps the code should process the elements starting from index+1. So during the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1, and then processes the elements from index+1 onwards.\n\nSo the code inside the loop could be:\n\nif (index2 != index) {\n    sumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumOfBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumOfBlock, 0L) +1);\n    if (hm.get(sumOfBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumOfBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nBut how to handle the first iteration.\n\nAlternatively, the code could initialize sumOfBlock to 0, and inside the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), for index2=index+1 and onwards:\n\nsumOfBlock += lst.get(index2);\nthen update the hashmap.\n\nBut how to structure this. Let's see.\n\nPerhaps the missing code is:\n\nlong currentSum = 0;\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0)) {\n    if (!fist) {\n        currentSum += lst.get(index2);\n        hm.put(currentSum, hm.getOrDefault(currentSum, 0L) + 1);\n        if (hm.get(currentSum) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n            mostFreq = currentSum;\n        }\n    }\n    fist = false;\n    index2++;\n}\n\nWait, but fist is set to false after the first iteration. So in the first iteration (fist is true), the code does not process the element. Then, in subsequent iterations (fist is false), the code processes index2 by adding to currentSum. But this would start processing from index2=index+1, which is correct.\n\nSo currentSum is the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Then, the code adds currentSum to the hashmap. The most frequent currentSum is found, and that's used to set x.\n\nThis seems correct. But how to handle the case where there are no elements between the current zero and the next zero. For example, if the current zero is followed by another zero. Then, the sum is zero, and the code would count that as one occurrence.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nInitialize currentSum to 0.\n\nDuring the first iteration (index2=index, fist is true), the code skips processing (since fist is true). Then, sets fist to false, increments index2 to index+1.\n\nThen, if index2 is a zero, the loop stops. So the hashmap remains empty, which would cause the code to add hm.get(mostFreq), but mostFreq is initialized to sum (the sum up to index-1). But in this case, there are no elements after the current zero, so the sum after replacement is sum + x. To make this zero, x can be set to -sum. Then, the count is increased by 1 (since the current zero's position would have sum 0). So in this case, the code would add 1 to the count.\n\nBut if the hashmap is empty, then hm.get(mostFreq) would be null. But mostFreq is initialized to sum, which may not be present in the hashmap. So perhaps the code needs to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, the code initializes the hashmap with sum's frequency as 0. Or, perhaps the code's initial mostFreq is sum, but in the case where no elements are processed, the hashmap is empty. So when the code does count += hm.get(mostFreq), this would return null, leading to a null pointer exception. So this needs to be handled.\n\nBut the code's current code initializes hm as new HashMap<>(), and mostFreq is set to sum (the sum up to index-1). So when there are no elements in the block (like when the current zero is followed by another zero), the hashmap is empty. Then, hm.get(mostFreq) would be null, leading to a NullPointerException. So this is a problem.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps the code should initialize the hashmap with sum's frequency as 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut regardless, the code's missing part is inside the loop. So the missing code should be:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (!fist) {\n    currentSum += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(currentSum, hm.getOrDefault(currentSum, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(currentSum) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = currentSum;\n    }\n}\n\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nBut wait, fist is set to false after the first iteration. So in the first iteration, the code doesn't process the element (index2=index). Then, in the next iterations, index2 is incremented, and the code processes index2=index+1, etc.\n\nSo the missing code would track the currentSum as the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Then, the hashmap is filled with the frequencies of currentSum. The most frequent currentSum is chosen. The count is increased by the frequency of that sum, and the sum variable is updated to sum + (-sum - mostFreq) = -mostFreq. Then, index is set to index2.\n\nBut how is currentSum initialized? In the code, before the loop, currentSum should be initialized to zero. So inside the code block where the zero is found, before the loop, currentSum is initialized to zero.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, after creating the hashmap, the code initializes mostFreq to sum. Then, the loop starts. So perhaps in the missing code, currentSum is initialized to zero inside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part should have:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 != index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nBut this would require initializing sumBlock to zero before the loop.\n\nSo the code inside the zero block:\n\n...\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>();\nlong mostFreq = sum;\nint index2 = index;\nboolean fist = true;\nlong sumBlock = 0;\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0)) {\n    if (index2 != index) {\n        sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n        hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n        if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n            mostFreq = sumBlock;\n        }\n    }\n    fist = false;\n    index2++;\n}\n...\n\nThis way, sumBlock starts at zero. For each index2 in the loop starting from index, if index2 is not the current zero (index), then the element is added to sumBlock and the frequency is tracked. So in the first iteration (index2=index), we check if index2 != index \u2192 false, so nothing is added. Then, index2 increments. For index2=index+1, the element is added to sumBlock, and so on.\n\nThis would correctly accumulate the sum of elements after the current zero.\n\nBut the code in the sample provided needs to have this logic. So the missing code is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\n\nBut this would require a check to skip index2=index. So the code inside the loop must have:\n\nif (index2 != index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nBut the code as provided in the problem doesn't have this check. So perhaps the code has a mistake here. But given that the code is structured to process elements from index to next zero, including the current zero, this would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's initial index2 is index, and in the first iteration, the code processes the current zero (index), but since the current zero can be replaced, perhaps the code's sumBlock should not include it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's sumBlock starts at zero, and in the loop, sumBlock is the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. So for each index2 in the loop, the code adds the element at index2 to sumBlock. But the loop starts at index, and increments index2 after processing. So the first element processed is index+1.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nindex2 starts at index. The loop runs.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2); \u2192 index2 is index. So sumBlock becomes lst.get(index) (zero).\n\nThen, index2 is incremented.\n\nThen, in the next iterations, index2 is index+1, and the code processes that element.\n\nBut this would include the current zero in sumBlock, which is incorrect. So this is a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the code's loop is processing the current zero's element in sumBlock, which is wrong. To fix this, the code's missing part should start processing elements from index+1.\n\nSo the missing code should process index2 >= index+1.\n\nBut the code's loop starts with index2=index. So how to skip the first element.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Perhaps the code's missing part should initialize sumBlock to zero, and during the loop, process elements starting from index+1. So inside the loop:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, ...);\nindex2++;\nBut this would include the current zero's element. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the code should initialize sumBlock to zero, and during the loop, index2 starts at index+1. So how to structure the loop to do that.\n\nThe code's current loop structure is:\n\nindex2 = index\nfist = true\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0)) {\n   ...\n   fist = false\n   index2++\n}\n\nBut in this setup, the first iteration processes index2=index, then increments to index+1. Then, the loop continues.\n\nSo inside the loop, during the first iteration (fist is true), the code can process index2=index, but then ignore it, and process index2=index+1 onwards.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the code's missing part is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (!fist) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, ...);\n    // update mostFreq\n}\n\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nThis way, during the first iteration (fist is true), the code does nothing. Then, in subsequent iterations, when fist is false, the code processes index2.\n\nBut this way, the first iteration processes index2=index, but does nothing. Then, index2 is incremented to index+1. Then, in the next iterations, the code processes index2=index+1, etc.\n\nSo the missing code would be:\n\nif (!fist) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nBut how is sumBlock initialized? Before the loop, sumBlock should be 0.\n\nSo, before the loop, add:\n\nlong sumBlock = 0;\n\nThen, the code inside the loop:\n\nif (!fist) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nThis way, sumBlock starts at 0, and during the first iteration (fist is true), nothing is added. Then, index2 is incremented to index+1, and the loop continues. The next iterations process index2=index+1, index+2, etc., adding their elements to sumBlock and updating the hashmap.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nIn the first test case example:\n\nAfter the current zero (index=1), the elements are 1, -1, 0.\n\nBut during processing, the loop will process index2=1 (fist=true, so no processing), then index2=2 (sumBlock += 1 \u2192 sumBlock=1), add to hm. Then index2=3 (sumBlock += -1 \u2192 0), add to hm. Then index2=4 (element is 0, loop stops.\n\nSo hm will have 1 \u2192 1 occurrence, 0 \u2192 1 occurrence. The most frequent is either 1 or 0 (tie). The code chooses the first occurrence. Then, count += 1 (the frequency). But the example expects 3. So this suggests that the code is missing something.\n\nWait, no. Because in the example, after replacing the zero at index=1 with x=-2, the sum up to index=1 is 2 + (-2) = 0. Then, adding elements 1 and -1 gives sum up to index=2: 0 + 1 =1, index=3: 0+1-1=0, index=4: 0+1-1+0=0.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, the sumBlock would be the sum of elements from index+1 (2) to index2. For index2=2, sumBlock=1. For index2=3, sumBlock=0. So the most frequent sum is 1 and 0 each with frequency 1. So the code would choose one of them (say, 1), and count +=1. Then, sum is set to -mostFreq = -1. But then, after processing, the code adds sum += -mostFreq (sum becomes 2 -1 = 1). Then, when processing further elements, the sum would be 1 + 1 (element at index=2) = 2, then 2 + (-1) =1, then 1 +0=1. So no additional zeros.\n\nBut this doesn't align with the example. So perhaps the code's approach is not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the problem. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe score is the number of indices i where the sum of the first i elements is zero.\n\nWhen we replace a zero at index, we can choose x such that sum up to index is zero. Then, when processing the elements after, if their sum adds up to zero again, those positions would also count.\n\nIn the example, after replacing index=1 (zero) with -2:\n\nsum up to index=1: 2 + (-2) = 0 \u2192 count +=1.\n\nsum up to index=3: 2 + (-2) +1 + (-1) =0 \u2192 count +=1.\n\nsum up to index=5 (the last element): 0 +0 =0 \u2192 count +=1.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSo how does the code's approach count these?\n\nIn the code's current approach, after replacing the zero at index=1 with x=-2, the code processes the elements from index+1 (index=2) to index=4 (next zero).\n\nThe sumBlock is the sum of elements from index+1 (2) to index2. For index2=2 (element 1), sumBlock=1. For index2=3 (element -1), sumBlock=1-1=0. The code would track these sums. The most frequent sum is 1 and 0 (each once). So the code would choose either, say 0. Then, x is set to -(sum + 0) = -(2 +0) =-2. This creates sum up to index=1 as zero. Then, when adding elements after, the sum up to index=3 (index=3) is zero (sum + x + sumBlock) \u2192 2 + (-2) + (1-1) =0. But sumBlock here is zero. So the code's count increases by the frequency of sumBlock=0, which is 1. Then, sum becomes sum + x + sumBlock (2 + (-2) + 0 =0. But then, the code proceeds to process the next elements, which include the next zero at index=4.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is to count each occurrence where the sum of the elements after the replaced zero is equal to the most frequent sum, thereby creating zeros at those positions.\n\nSo in the example, after replacing the zero at index=1 with x=-2, the sum up to index=1 is zero (count +=1). Then, the sum up to index=3 is zero (count +=1), and the sum up to index=4 (the next zero) is zero (count +=1). So how does this happen.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the sumBlock in the first block (from index=1 to index=4) would be:\n\nelements are 1, -1, 0 (the zero at index=4 is not part of this block, because the loop stops when a zero is encountered). So the sumBlock for index=2 (element 1) is 1. For index=3 (element -1) sumBlock is 0. So the most frequent sum is 1 and 0 (each once). So the code chooses the most frequent (one of them), say 0. Then, the count is increased by 1 (the frequency of 0). Then, sum is updated to sum + (-sum - mostFreq) \u2192 sum was 2 (sum up to index-1=0), so sum = 2 + x \u2192 x = -sum - mostFreq \u2192 x = -(2 +0) \u2192 x =-2. So sum becomes 0. Then, the code processes the next zero at index=4.\n\nWhen processing the next zero (index=4), the sum is zero. So when the code enters that block, it processes elements from index=4 onwards. The sum up to index=4-1 (index=3) is zero. So the code would create another block here. But the element at index=4 is zero, and the code can replace it. So for this block, the sum up to index=4-1 is zero. The sum of the elements after index=4 is none (since it's the end of the array). So the code would add 1 to the count (since replacing the zero at index=4 with x=0 would make the sum up to index=5 (assuming the array is 5 elements long) to be zero.\n\nBut the example's array has 5 elements. So in the code's processing, after the first block (index=1), the sum is zero. Then, when processing the next zero (index=4), the code enters the block again. The sum is zero (sum up to index=4-1=3). The code's loop processes elements from index=4. During the first iteration (index2=4), fist is true. Then, index2 increments to 5 (out of bounds). So the code would initialize sumBlock to 0. The hashmap is empty. So mostFreq is sum (0). But hm.get(0) is null. So count +=0. Then, sum is set to -0=0. So after this, the code would increment index to 5 (end of array). So the code's total count is 1 (from first block) +1 (from sum==0 in the else part) +1 (from next block). Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Perhaps the code's approach is to process each block between zeros and find the best possible x for each zero, thereby accumulating the maximum possible count. The missing code is the part that computes the sum of elements after the zero and tracks their frequencies.\n\nTo sum up, the missing code inside the loop should process the elements after the current zero (index+1 to next zero), accumulate their sum, and track the frequencies. The code should add to the hashmap the sum of elements from index+1 to index2 for each index2 in that block. Then, the most frequent sum in the hashmap is chosen, and the count is increased by that frequency.\n\nTherefore, the code's missing part should be:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\n\nBut this would include the current zero's element (index) in the sumBlock, which is incorrect. So the code must avoid adding the current zero's element.\n\nBut given the code's structure, perhaps the code is designed to process elements from index onwards, including the current zero. This leads to incorrect results. Therefore, the code must be adjusted to process elements after the current zero.\n\nBut how to do that within the given code structure.\n\nThe correct approach is to process elements starting from index+1. But the loop starts at index. So the code must process index+1, index+2, etc. until next zero.\n\nSo the code's loop should process index2 from index+1 to next zero.\n\nBut the loop's current structure starts at index and processes until next zero. So to skip the current zero's element, the code must start processing from index+1.\n\nTherefore, inside the loop, after the first iteration (index2=index), the code increments index2 to index+1 and processes from there.\n\nBut how to do this in the code.\n\nThe missing code could be:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\n\nfist = false;\nindex2++;\n\nThis way, during the first iteration (index2=index), the code skips processing. Then, for index2=index+1, the code processes.\n\nBut to implement this, the code would need to check if index2 is greater than index. However, this requires that the loop increments index2 even during the first iteration.\n\nSo, the code inside the loop:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\n\nBut this adds the current zero's element to sumBlock. Which is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Given the time constraints and the fact that the code's missing part is in the while loop, perhaps the correct code to fill in is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this will process the current zero's element (index) in the first iteration, which is incorrect. So the sumBlock will include the zero, which is not part of the elements after the zero. So this will lead to incorrect results.\n\nBut according to the sample input, this approach would not work. So what's the correct way?\n\nPerhaps the code's initial approach is incorrect and should start processing from index+1. But given the existing code structure, perhaps the correct way is to initialize sumBlock as 0, and in each iteration of the loop, add lst.get(index2) to sumBlock. But then, after processing index2=index (current zero), which is being replaced, the sumBlock would be zero (since the element is zero). So this would be treated as a possible sum, which x is set to -(sum + 0) \u2192 x = -sum. This would allow the sum up to index (current zero) to be zero. Then, if there are other elements after, their sumBlock would include the current zero's element, but since the zero is replaced, this sum is no longer valid.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct code for the missing part is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this would include the current zero's element in sumBlock, but the current zero is being replaced, so the sumBlock is the sum of the current zero (before replacement) and subsequent elements. Which is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the current zero is replaced. So the sum after replacement is sum (sum up to index-1) + x. Then, the sum up to index is sum + x. The elements after index are added to this sum. So sum up to index2 is sum + x + sum of elements from index+1 to index2.\n\nThus, to find x such that sum + x + sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2 =0 for as many index2 as possible, x must be equal to -(sum + sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2). The sum_of_elements_from_index+1_to_index2 is the sum of the elements after the current zero.\n\nTherefore, the code must compute the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. But in the current code's loop, the sumBlock includes the current zero's element. So this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the code's loop is incorrect. But given that we have to fill in the missing code, perhaps the correct approach is to start the sumBlock from zero and add elements from index+1 to index2.\n\nBut the code's loop starts at index. So how to achieve this.\n\nThe solution is to, inside the loop, check if index2 is greater than index. If so, add to sumBlock.\n\nSo the missing code could be:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this requires initializing sumBlock to zero before the loop.\n\nSo inside the code block where the zero is found:\n\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>();\nlong mostFreq = sum;\nint index2 = index;\nboolean fist = true;\nlong sumBlock = 0;\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0)) {\n    if (index2 > index) {\n        sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n        hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n        if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n            mostFreq = sumBlock;\n        }\n    }\n    fist = false;\n    index2++;\n}\n\nThis way, sumBlock accumulates the elements from index+1 onwards. For example, in the first iteration (index2=index), index2 is not greater than index, so nothing is added. index2 increments to index+1. In the next iteration, index2=index+1, which is greater than index, so sumBlock += lst.get(index+1), and so on.\n\nThis correctly accumulates the sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Then, the hashmap tracks the frequency of these sums. The most frequent sum is chosen. The count is increased by the frequency of that sum. Then, x is set to -(sum + mostFreq), so that sum + x + sumBlock =0 for all occurrences of sumBlock = mostFreq.\n\nThis should solve the problem.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut only if index2 > index.\n\nBut the code must check if index2 is greater than index before adding to sumBlock.\n\nSo the code inside the loop is:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this requires that sumBlock is initialized to 0 before the loop.\n\nSo the complete code for the missing part is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut with the condition that this is only done for index2 > index.\n\nWait, no. The code as written would process all index2 >= index, but the if condition skips index2=index.\n\nTherefore, the code must be:\n\nsumBlock is initialized to 0.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut how to implement this. So in the code's missing part, the code would have:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this would process index2=index, leading to sumBlock including the current zero. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct code must have a condition to skip index2=index.\n\nBut given that the code's loop starts at index, the correct code for the missing part is:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut how to initialize sumBlock and other variables.\n\nThe code inside the zero block should be:\n\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>();\nlong mostFreq = sum;\nint index2 = index;\nboolean fist = true;\nlong sumBlock = 0;\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) != 0)) {\n    if (index2 > index) {\n        sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n        hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n        if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n            mostFreq = sumBlock;\n        }\n    }\n    fist = false;\n    index2++;\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is the code inside the loop that checks if index2 is greater than index, and if so, adds the current element to sumBlock, updates the hashmap, and checks for the most frequent sum.\n\nSo the code to fill in the missing part is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut only if index2 > index. But the code as written does not have the condition. Therefore, the code is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time constraints and the code structure, perhaps the correct answer is to add the following code inside the loop:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this would include the current zero's element in sumBlock. However, in the example, this would lead to sumBlock being 0 (current zero's element) plus 1 (index+1) plus -1 (index+2). So sumBlock would be 0, then 1, then 0. The most frequent is 0 (twice). But this would allow x to be set to -(sum + 0) = -2, which is correct. Then, the count would be 2 (frequency of 0) plus 1 (sum up to index=1). So the total count would be 3, which matches the example.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the example, after the zero at index=1:\n\nsum is 2 (sum up to index=0).\n\nindex2 starts at 1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nsumBlock is initialized to 0.\n\nFirst iteration (fist is true):\n\nindex2=1. Since index2 is not > index (1 is not >1), so no addition. fist is set to false. index2 increments to 2.\n\nSecond iteration (fist is false):\n\nindex2=2 >1 \u2192 sumBlock += 1 \u2192 sumBlock=1. hm.put(1, 1). mostFreq is 2 (sum up to index-1=2). So hm.get(1)=1 is not >0. So mostFreq remains 2. index2 increments to 3.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nindex2=3>1 \u2192 sumBlock +=-1 \u2192 sumBlock=0. hm.put(0,1). now, 0's count is 1, which is >0. So mostFreq is 0. index2 increments to4.\n\nFourth iteration:\n\nindex2=4. element is 0, so loop stops.\n\nSo hm has 1 \u21921, 0\u21921. mostFreq is 0.\n\ncount += hm.get(mostFreq) \u2192 hm.get(0) is 1. count becomes 1.\n\nsum is updated to sum + (-sum - mostFreq) \u2192 2 + (-2 -0) \u21920.\n\nindex is set to index2=4.\n\nThen, processing index=4, which is a zero. So enter the loop again.\n\nsum is 0 (sum up to index-1=3).\n\ncreate hm, mostFreq=0.\n\nindex2=4. fist=true.\n\nloop runs once:\n\nindex2=4. sumBlock starts at 0.\n\nif index2>4? No. So no addition. fist becomes false. index2 increments to5, which is beyond array size.\n\nSo loop ends. count += hm.get(0) \u2192 hm is empty. hm.get(0) is null \u2192 null pointer exception. So this is a problem.\n\nBut in reality, the code's initial mostFreq is sum (0). hm is empty, so hm.get(0) is null. So the code would throw an error.\n\nTo prevent this, the code should initialize the hashmap with sum (mostFreq) with a frequency of zero. So the code would add:\n\nhm.put(mostFreq, 0L);\n\nSo in the code block after creating the hashmap:\n\nhm.put(mostFreq, 0L);\n\nThen, during the loop, the code would process elements and increment frequencies.\n\nBut the existing code does not do this. So perhaps the code needs to initialize the hashmap with sum's frequency as zero.\n\nBut given the code provided, this is not done, which could lead to null pointer exceptions.\n\nBut the code's sample input may not hit this case. For example, in the first test case, after processing index=4, the code would have hm as empty. So hm.get(mostFreq) is 0, but how?\n\nAssuming that the code's mostFreq is initialized to sum (0), and the hashmap is empty, hm.get(0) would return null. So adding count += hm.get(mostFreq) would throw a null pointer exception.\n\nTo avoid this, the code should use getOrDefault.\n\nBut in the code's existing code, the count += hm.get(mostFreq) would have to be changed to count += hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L).\n\nBut in the existing code, the line is:\n\ncount += hm.get(mostFreq);\n\nThis would throw a null pointer exception if the hashmap is empty.\n\nBut given that the code is provided and we have to fill in the missing part, perhaps the code's missing part is as follows, and the code's other parts have been adjusted to handle this.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed.\n\nThe correct code to fill in the missing part is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut with the following explanation: this code adds the current element to sumBlock and updates the hashmap. However, this includes the current zero's element (index) in the sumBlock. But according to the problem's example, this would still result in the correct count.\n\nWait, in the first example:\n\nsum up to index-1 (0) is 2.\n\nindex is 1 (zero). sumBlock starts at 0.\n\nIn the first iteration of the loop (index2=1):\n\nsumBlock += 0 (element at index=1). sumBlock=0. hm.put(0,1). mostFreq is initially sum=2. 1 >0 \u2192 mostFreq becomes 0. index2 increments to 2.\n\nSecond iteration (index2=2):\n\nsumBlock +=1 \u2192 1. hm.put(1,1). 1 is not >1. mostFreq remains 0.\n\nindex2 increments to3.\n\nThird iteration (index2=3):\n\nsumBlock +=-1 \u21920. hm.put(0,2). 2>1. mostFreq becomes 0.\n\nindex2 increments to4.\n\nFourth iteration (index2=4):\n\nelement is 0. loop stops.\n\ncount += hm.get(0) \u21922. sum is updated to 2 + (-2-0) =0. index=4.\n\nThen, processing index=4 (zero):\n\nsum is 0.\n\ncreate hm, mostFreq=0.\n\nloop runs once (index2=4, fist=true):\n\nsumBlock +=0 (element at 4). sumBlock=0. hm.put(0,1). mostFreq=0, 1>0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nindex2 increments to5. loop stops.\n\ncount +=1. sum is updated to 0 + (-0 -0) =0.\n\nSo total count is 2 (from first block) +1 (from sum up to index=1 being zero) +1 (from index=4's processing) \u2192 total 4. But the example expects 3.\n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach must be to process elements after the current zero.\n\nThus, the missing code must process elements from index+1 onwards, not including the current zero.\n\nBut given the code structure, the missing code must be written with a check to exclude the current zero's element.\n\nThus, the correct code is:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    sumBlock += lst.get(index2);\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut how to implement this in the code.\n\nIn the code's missing part, we need to add:\n\nif (index2 > index) {\n    long current = lst.get(index2);\n    sumBlock += current;\n    hm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\n    if (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n        mostFreq = sumBlock;\n    }\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut given that the code must be written in the missing part, and the code's loop structure, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this would include the current zero's element. Which is incorrect. So the code would not work for the sample input.\n\nThus, the correct answer must involve processing elements after the current zero.\n\nBut given the code structure provided, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this code would include the current zero's element, leading to incorrect results.\n\nThus, the correct answer is to fill in the loop with:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nBut this is the only code that fits into the given code's structure, even though it may have errors. However, according to the sample input, this code may not work, but perhaps the code's other parts account for this.\n\nAfter further analysis, perhaps the code's initial sum is sum up to index-1. Then, when the current zero is replaced by x, the sum becomes sum + x. The elements after the zero are then added to this sum. Thus, the sum of elements from index+1 to index2 is sumBlock. So x is chosen such that sum + x + sumBlock =0 \u2192 x = -sum - sumBlock. The code tracks the sumBlock (sum of elements from index+1 to index2) for each index2 in the block.\n\nBut the code's loop includes the current zero's element (index) in sumBlock, which is sumBlock = sum of elements from index to index2. This would be sum of elements from index (zero) to index2. But after replacing the zero, the elements from index+1 onwards are added. So this sumBlock includes the current zero's element, which is not part of the elements after replacement. Thus, this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct code must process elements from index+1 onwards. But given the code's loop structure, it's impossible to do so. Therefore, the code provided has a logical error. But since the code is given and we have to fill in the missing part, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nEven though this includes the current zero's element, the code may still pass some test cases. However, according to the sample input, this would not produce the correct result.\n\nBut given that the sample input's code's expected output is 3, and the code with this missing code would produce:\n\nIn the first block, sumBlock includes the current zero (index=1), sumBlock is 0 +1 +(-1) =0. So mostFreq is 0. count +=2. sum becomes 0. Then, processing the next zero (index=4), sum is 0, and the block processes sumBlock=0. count +=1. Total count is 2 +1=3. Which matches the sample.\n\nWait, how?\n\nIn the first block:\n\nindex=1 (zero).\n\nsum is 2.\n\nsumBlock is initialized to 0.\n\nFirst iteration of loop (index2=1, fist=true):\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(1) \u21920. hm.put(0,1). mostFreq is sum=2. 1 >0 \u2192 mostFreq becomes 0. index2=2.\n\nSecond iteration (index2=2, fist=false):\n\nsumBlock +=1 \u21921. hm.put(1,1). 1 >1 \u2192 no. index2=3.\n\nThird iteration (index2=3):\n\nsumBlock +=-1 \u21920. hm.put(0,2). 2>1 \u2192 mostFreq=0. index2=4.\n\nFourth iteration (index2=4, element 0 \u2192 loop stops.\n\ncount += hm.get(0) \u21922.\n\nsum becomes 2 + (-2 -0) \u21920.\n\nThen, processing index=4 (zero):\n\nsum is 0. The code enters the block.\n\nhm is created, mostFreq=0.\n\nloop runs:\n\nindex2=4 (fist=true).\n\nsumBlock +=0 \u21920. hm.put(0,1). mostFreq=0. index2=5 (out of bounds).\n\ncount +=1.\n\nsum is updated to 0 + (-0 -0) \u21920.\n\nTotal count is 2 +1 (from sum being zero when processing index=4) +1 (from the block) = 3 +1 =4? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the code, after processing the first block (index=1), count +=2 (from hm.get(0) =2). Then, when processing the current zero (index=1), the code's else part is not entered, because the code is in the block. Then, the code increments index to 4. Then, in the outer loop, index=4, which is a zero. The code enters the block again. In the code's loop, sumBlock is initialized to 0. In the first iteration (index2=4, fist=true), sumBlock +=0. hm.put(0,1). mostFreq=0. index2=5. Loop stops. count +=1. Then, sum becomes 0 + (-0-0)=0. index is set to5. Then, in the outer loop, index=5 is >= arrSz, so loop ends.\n\nThen, the code's count is 2 +1 =3, which matches the sample.\n\nYes! Because after processing the first block (index=1), count is increased by 2. Then, when processing index=4, the code's loop processes index2=4 (current zero), sumBlock becomes 0. hm.get(0) is 1. count +=1. Total count is 3.\n\nSo the code would produce the correct result for the sample input.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;\n\nThis code is correct, even though it includes the current zero's element in sumBlock. Because when the current zero is replaced, the sum up to index is sum + x. The sum of elements from index onwards (including the replaced zero) is sum +x + sumBlock (sum of elements from index+1 to index2).\n\nBut the code's sumBlock includes the current zero's element (index), which is replaced. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut in the example, this code works. So perhaps the code's approach is correct despite this.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause when the current zero's element is included in sumBlock, sumBlock becomes the sum of elements from index (current zero) to index2. But after replacing the zero with x, the sum up to index2 is sum (sum up to index-1) +x (replaced zero) + sum of elements from index+1 to index2. Which is the same as sum +x + (sumBlock - lst.get(index)). Because sumBlock includes the current zero's element (index) which is replaced.\n\nBut lst.get(index) is zero. So sumBlock -0 = sum of elements from index+1 to index2.\n\nSo sum up to index2 is sum +x + (sumBlock -0).\n\nSo setting x = -(sum + sumBlock) would make the sum up to index2 zero. So the code's approach is to find sumBlock (sum of elements from index to index2), then x is set to -(sum + sumBlock). Thus, the sum up to index2 is sum +x + (sumBlock - lst.get(index)) \u2192 sum + (-sum - sumBlock) + (sumBlock -0) = 0.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nsumBlock += lst.get(index2);\nhm.put(sumBlock, hm.getOrDefault(sumBlock, 0L) + 1);\nif (hm.get(sumBlock) > hm.getOrDefault(mostFreq, 0L)) {\n    mostFreq = sumBlock;\n}\nindex2++;"
