Like in the sample test case, -789 is division4. Because division4 is all ratings <=1399, which includes all negatives. So the logic holds. So the steps for each test case are:\n\nRead the rating. Then:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) -> Division 1\n\nelse if (rating >=1600) -> Division 2 (since 1600 <= rating <=1899 is the same as >=1600 but less than 1900.
