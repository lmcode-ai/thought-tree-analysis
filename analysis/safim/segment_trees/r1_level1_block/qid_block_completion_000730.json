        "text": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine which division a given rating belongs to. Let's read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly. The divisions are defined as:\n- Division 1: rating >= 1900\n- Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n- Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n- Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nSo, the function needs to take a rating and return the correct division. The existing code has a function div(n) that returns 1 if n >=1900, else 2 if n >=1600, else 3 if n >=1400 else 4. Wait, wait. Let's think about that logic. Because if n is 1600, then the first condition (1900) is false. Then it checks if n >=1600, which is true. So returns 2. That's correct for division 2. Similarly, for 1400, the first two conditions are false, so it checks if >=1400, returns 3. That's correct. And anything below 1400, returns 4. So that function seems correct. Now, looking at the main part of the code. The loop runs for each test case. The user inputs t test cases, and each test case is a rating. For each, we need to print \"Division X\". So the missing code is in the loop. The current code has a for loop that iterates over the number of test cases.",
