So the answer is the integer part of the square root of the sum of all blocks' lengths. So the problem now is to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n, then take the square root of that sum, and take the floor. But wait, no. Because sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n is the key. Let's find the formula for the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's compute this sum for different n.\n\nFor i even: i=2k, ceil(2k/2) = k.\n\nFor i odd: i=2k-1, ceil((2k-1)/2) = k. So for each pair of numbers (2k-1, 2k), their sum is k + k = 2k. So for even n=2m, the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). So S(2m) = m(m+1). For odd n=2m+1, the sum is S(2m) + (m+1) = m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Wait, let's see: For n=1 (m=0, since 2m+1=1), sum is 1 \u2192 (0+1)^2 =1. Correct.\n\nn=3 (m=1), sum is 1+1+2=4 \u2192 (1+1)^2=4. Correct. So for n even:\n\nn=2m \u2192 sum is m(m+1). For n odd:\n\nn=2m+1 \u2192 sum is (m+1)^2. So the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nS(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nS(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2. Alternatively, we can combine these two cases into a formula. Let's see:\n\nLet m = (n +1) // 2. Wait, for even n=2m: m is n/2. For odd n=2m-1: m is (2m-1 +1)/2 = m. So for even n=2m, sum is m*(m+1). For odd n=2m-1, sum is m\u00b2. So in code, we can calculate m as (n+1)//2. Then, if n is even, sum is m*(m+1) - m? Wait, maybe not. Wait, for even n=2m, m is (2m+1)/2 rounded down, which is m. So m is 2m//2 +1? Wait no. Let me think again. Wait, for n even:\n\nn=2m \u2192 (n+1)/2 = (2m +1)/2 = m + 0.5 \u2192 when integer division is done, (n+1)//2 is m +0.5 floored, so m.\n\nWait, for n even, (n+1) // 2 is (2m +1)/2 = m.5, which when using integer division (floor division) is m.\n\nWait, for example, n=4 (even), (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. For n=5 (odd), (5+1)//2=3, which is correct (m=3, sum is 3\u00b2=9). Wait, maybe another approach. Let's see:\n\nFor n even: sum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1). For n odd: sum = ((n+1)/2)^2. But how to express this in code. For example, when n is even, say n=2m:\n\nsum = m*(m+1). When n=2m-1 (odd):\n\nsum = m\u00b2. So for n, m = (n +1) // 2. If n is even, then m = (2m +1 -1) // 2? Wait, no. Let me see. Wait, for even n=2m: m = (2m +1)/2 \u2192 when integer divided, it's m.5, which truncates to m. So (n+1)//2 for even n is (2m+1)//2 = m.\n\nFor n even, m = n/2. So sum is m*(m+1). For n odd, m = (n+1)/2. So sum is m\u00b2. So the code can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nelse:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+1)/2)\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e9, we have to compute this efficiently. Once we have the sum S, the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S.\n\nWait, but how? Because we need the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= S. So s = floor(sqrt(S)). But computing sqrt(S) accurately when S is a huge number (up to 1e18, since for n=1e9, sum is (5e8)^2 = 2.5e17 for odd n=1e9? Wait, no. Let's see: If n is even, say n=1e9 (even), then m = 1e9 / 2 = 5e8. sum is 5e8 * (5e8 +1) = 5e8*5e8 +5e8 = 25e16 + 5e8 \u2248 25e16. So S is about 2.5e17. So sqrt(S) is sqrt(25e16) =5e8, but maybe a bit more. But the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(S). So how to compute that. But when computing the square root of a very large number (up to 1e18), we can use binary search to find s.\n\nAlternatively, in C++, using sqrtl() function which can handle 64-bit integers, but even then, there's possible precision issues. So perhaps the binary search approach is better. Wait, but the sum S can be up to (5e8)^2 for even n=1e9, which is 2.5e17. The sqrt of that is 5e8 * sqrt(1 + 1/(5e8)) which is approximately 5e8 + 0.5. So the floor would be 5e8. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nFor example, sum when n is even:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. The square root of this is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) \u2248 m + 0.5 for large m. So the integer part would be m when m\u00b2 +m < (m+1)^2. But (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 + 2m +1. So m\u00b2 +m < m\u00b2 +2m +1 \u2192 m < 2m+1 \u2192 always true. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is between m and m+1. So the floor is m.\n\nWait, for sum = m(m+1), the square is m\u00b2 + m. The sqrt of that is m*sqrt(1 + 1/m) \u2248 m(1 + 1/(2m)) = m + 0.5. So the floor would be m.\n\nWait, let's test with m=5. sum is 5*6=30. sqrt(30) is ~5.477. Floor is 5. So yes. But for sum = m^2, the square root is m. So the floor is m. So for even n, sum is m(m+1) where m =n/2.",

Sample input 2: n=5. n is odd. m = (5+1)/2 =3. sum is 3\u00b2=9. So sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. Which matches the sample output. Another sample: when n=2 (even). sum is 1*(1+1)=2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414. So s=1. Which matches the first sample (n=1: sum 1, s=1; but when n=2, sum 2, s=1. So for n=2, the maximum s is 1.) So for even n=2m, the maximum s is m.

So in both cases, s is equal to (n +1)//2. Wait, but earlier conclusion was that for even n=2m, sum is m(m+1), and s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1)))=m. For example, when n=2, m=1. sum=2. s=1.

Correct. n=5: 6/2=3. n=6:7/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Correct. So yes. But why is this the case? Because the sum S(n) for n=2m even is m(m+1), and the maximum s is m. For n=2m-1, sum is m\u00b2, s is m. So s is m for both even and odd cases. And m is equal to (n+1)//2. Yes. Therefore, the code is simply outputting (n+1)//2 for each test case. But how can this be possible? Because the sum for even n is m(m+1), which allows for a square of s = m. Because m(m+1) >= m\u00b2. So yes. So the code is as simple as that. Wow, I think this is the case. So the problem reduces to a very simple formula.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n wooden blocks. Each block is 1 unit high and has a length of ceil(i/2) where i is the block's number. So, for example, block 1 and 2 are length 1, blocks 3 and 4 are length 2, 5 and 6 are 3, etc.\n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out how much total length we can get from the blocks, since each layer of the square is 1 unit high. So the square's side length s is determined by the sum of the lengths of the blocks divided by s (since each layer contributes to the length in one direction). Wait, no. Wait, since each block is 1 unit high, when building a square of side s, each layer is a row of height 1. So the total number of blocks used in each row is s. Wait, no. Wait, the blocks are placed horizontally, and each has length. So each block contributes to covering a certain horizontal length in a row. To form a square of side s, each row (there are s rows) must have a total length of s. So the total sum of all the blocks' lengths must be at least s*s. Because each row contributes s length, and there are s rows. So the sum of the lengths of the selected blocks must be >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest integer such that the sum of the ceil(i/2) for some subset of the blocks is at least s\u00b2. But we need to find the maximum possible s given that the sum of all possible blocks up to n is as much as possible. Wait, but the problem allows us to choose any subset of the blocks, but we can take any subset. But to maximize the sum, we should take all the blocks, right? Because adding more blocks would only increase the sum. So the maximum possible s is the largest s such that the sum of the first k blocks (for k up to n) is >= s\u00b2. But we need to compute the sum of the first n blocks, then find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the first n blocks' lengths, then finding the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum. Then output s.\n\nWait, yes. Because the sum is the maximum possible (since we can choose all blocks), so the maximum s is the floor of the square root of that sum. But wait, maybe there's a case where using all blocks gives a sum of s\u00b2, but using a subset gives a higher sum? No, because the sum is the total of all blocks, which is the maximum possible. So the answer is the integer part of the square root of the sum of all blocks' lengths.\n\nSo the problem now is to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n, then take the square root of that sum, and take the floor. But wait, no. Because sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n is the key.\n\nLet's find the formula for the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet's compute this sum for different n.\n\nFor i even: i=2k, ceil(2k/2) = k.\n\nFor i odd: i=2k-1, ceil((2k-1)/2) = k.\n\nSo for each pair of numbers (2k-1, 2k), their sum is k + k = 2k. So for even n=2m, the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). So S(2m) = m(m+1).\n\nFor odd n=2m+1, the sum is S(2m) + (m+1) = m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=1 (m=0, since 2m+1=1), sum is 1 \u2192 (0+1)^2 =1. Correct.\n\nn=3 (m=1), sum is 1+1+2=4 \u2192 (1+1)^2=4. Correct.\n\nSo for n even:\n\nn=2m \u2192 sum is m(m+1).\n\nFor n odd:\n\nn=2m+1 \u2192 sum is (m+1)^2.\n\nSo the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nS(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nS(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nAlternatively, we can combine these two cases into a formula. Let's see:\n\nLet m = (n +1) // 2.\n\nWait, for even n=2m: m is n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2m-1: m is (2m-1 +1)/2 = m.\n\nSo for even n=2m, sum is m*(m+1).\n\nFor odd n=2m-1, sum is m\u00b2.\n\nSo in code, we can calculate m as (n+1)//2. Then, if n is even, sum is m*(m+1) - m? Wait, maybe not. Wait, for even n=2m, m is (2m+1)/2 rounded down, which is m. So m is 2m//2 +1? Wait no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for n even:\n\nn=2m \u2192 (n+1)/2 = (2m +1)/2 = m + 0.5 \u2192 when integer division is done, (n+1)//2 is m +0.5 floored, so m.\n\nWait, for n even, (n+1) // 2 is (2m +1)/2 = m.5, which when using integer division (floor division) is m.\n\nWait, for example, n=4 (even), (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2.\n\nFor n=5 (odd), (5+1)//2=3, which is correct (m=3, sum is 3\u00b2=9).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see:\n\nFor n even: sum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1).\n\nFor n odd: sum = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nBut how to express this in code.\n\nFor example, when n is even, say n=2m:\n\nsum = m*(m+1).\n\nWhen n=2m-1 (odd):\n\nsum = m\u00b2.\n\nSo for n, m = (n +1) // 2.\n\nIf n is even, then m = (2m +1 -1) // 2? Wait, no. Let me see.\n\nWait, for even n=2m: m = (2m +1)/2 \u2192 when integer divided, it's m.5, which truncates to m. So (n+1)//2 for even n is (2m+1)//2 = m.\n\nFor n even, m = n/2. So sum is m*(m+1).\n\nFor n odd, m = (n+1)/2. So sum is m\u00b2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nelse:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+1)/2)\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e9, we have to compute this efficiently.\n\nOnce we have the sum S, the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S.\n\nWait, but how? Because we need the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= S. So s = floor(sqrt(S)).\n\nBut computing sqrt(S) accurately when S is a huge number (up to 1e18, since for n=1e9, sum is (5e8)^2 = 2.5e17 for odd n=1e9? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf n is even, say n=1e9 (even), then m = 1e9 / 2 = 5e8. sum is 5e8 * (5e8 +1) = 5e8*5e8 +5e8 = 25e16 + 5e8 \u2248 25e16. So S is about 2.5e17. So sqrt(S) is sqrt(25e16) =5e8, but maybe a bit more. But the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(S). So how to compute that.\n\nBut when computing the square root of a very large number (up to 1e18), we can use binary search to find s.\n\nAlternatively, in C++, using sqrtl() function which can handle 64-bit integers, but even then, there's possible precision issues. So perhaps the binary search approach is better.\n\nWait, but the sum S can be up to (5e8)^2 for even n=1e9, which is 2.5e17. The sqrt of that is 5e8 * sqrt(1 + 1/(5e8)) which is approximately 5e8 + 0.5. So the floor would be 5e8.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nFor example, sum when n is even:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m.\n\nThe square root of this is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) \u2248 m + 0.5 for large m.\n\nSo the integer part would be m when m\u00b2 +m < (m+1)^2. But (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 + 2m +1. So m\u00b2 +m < m\u00b2 +2m +1 \u2192 m < 2m+1 \u2192 always true. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is between m and m+1. So the floor is m.\n\nWait, for sum = m(m+1), the square is m\u00b2 + m. The sqrt of that is m*sqrt(1 + 1/m) \u2248 m(1 + 1/(2m)) = m + 0.5. So the floor would be m.\n\nWait, let's test with m=5. sum is 5*6=30. sqrt(30) is ~5.477. Floor is 5. So yes.\n\nBut for sum = m^2, the square root is m. So the floor is m.\n\nSo for even n, sum is m(m+1) where m =n/2. The maximum s is the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)), which is m.\n\nWait, no. Wait, m(m+1) is m\u00b2 +m. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is larger than m but less than m+1. So the floor is m.\n\nWait, for m=5: 5*6=30. sqrt(30) is ~5.477. So floor is 5.\n\nFor m=3: 12, sqrt(12) is ~3.464 \u2192 3.\n\nSo in this case, the maximum s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1))) which is m, because m\u00b2 < m(m+1) < (m+1)^2 \u2192 sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So the floor is m.\n\nSo for even n, sum is m(m+1), s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1))) = m.\n\nBut wait, m(m+1) is equal to m\u00b2 +m. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is less than m+1. So yes, floor is m.\n\nSo for even n, s is m.\n\nFor odd n, sum is m\u00b2, so s is m.\n\nSo combining the two cases, when n is even:\n\ns = floor(sqrt(m(m+1))) \u2192 m.\n\nWhen n is odd:\n\ns = m.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSample input 2: n=5.\n\nn is odd. m = (5+1)/2 =3. sum is 3\u00b2=9. So sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: when n=2 (even). sum is 1*(1+1)=2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414. So s=1. Which matches the first sample (n=1: sum 1, s=1; but when n=2, sum 2, s=1. So for n=2, the maximum s is 1.)\n\nSo for even n=2m, the maximum s is m. Because m(m+1) is sum, s=floor(sqrt(m(m+1))) which is m.\n\nSo for even n, s is m.\n\nFor odd n, s is m.\n\nBut m for even n is n/2, and for odd n is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo for even n, m = n/2 \u2192 s = m.\n\nFor odd n, m = (n+1)/2 \u2192 s = m.\n\nSo combining both cases, s is equal to (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, what?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2m:\n\ns = m = n/2.\n\nBut (n+1)//2 for even n=2m is (2m +1)/2 = m + 0.5 \u2192 integer division gives m.\n\nSo (n +1)//2 = m for even n=2m.\n\nFor odd n=2m-1: (2m-1 +1)//2 = (2m)/2 =m.\n\nSo in both cases, s is equal to (n +1)//2.\n\nWait, but earlier conclusion was that for even n=2m, sum is m(m+1), and s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1)))=m.\n\nFor example, when n=2, m=1. sum=2. s=1. Which is equal to (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 integer division gives 1.\n\nBut for n=4 (even), m=2. sum is 2*3=6. s= sqrt(6)~2.449 \u2192 floor is 2. Which is (4+1)//2=2.5 \u2192 2.\n\nSo for even n, s is m =n/2 = (n+1)//2.\n\nSo the s is (n+1)//2, regardless of whether n is even or odd.\n\nWait, but for even n=2m:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) \u2192 s = floor(sqrt(m(m+1))).\n\nBut m(m+1) is m\u00b2 +m. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) = m * sqrt(1 + 1/m) < m +1. So floor is m.\n\nSo yes, s is m, which is (n+1)//2.\n\nFor example, n=6 (even), m=3. sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is 3.464 \u2192 floor 3. s=3. Which is (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3 in integer division.\n\nSo yes, s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but wait: let's take n=5 (odd). sum is 3\u00b2=9. s=3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. So yes.\n\nn=3 (odd): sum is 4. s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Yes.\n\nn=4 (even): sum is 2*3=6. s=2. (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nn=6: sum 3*4=12. s=3. (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Correct.\n\nSo the s is always equal to (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, what? So for all n, the maximum s is (n+1)//2. But how?\n\nWait, let's test with n=5. sum is 9. s=3. (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=6. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3. Which is (6+1)//2=3.\n\nn=7. sum is (7+1)/2=4. So 4\u00b2=16. sum= (7+1)/2=4. sum=4\u00b2=16. s=4.\n\nWait, n=7 is odd. So sum is (8/2)^2=4\u00b2=16. s is 4.\n\nYes. So for n=7, s=4.\n\nSo according to this, the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut why is that the case?\n\nBecause for the sum S(n) which is:\n\nif even: m*(m+1) where m =n/2.\n\nif odd: m\u00b2 where m=(n+1)/2.\n\nSo in the even case, the sum is m*(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. The square root is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) which is between m and m+1. So floor is m. But m is (n/2) = (n+1)//2 when n is even.\n\nWait, no. For even n=2m:\n\n(n+1)//2 = (2m +1)/2 \u2192 in integer division, this is m. So (n+1)//2 = m.\n\nSo s is m.\n\nIn the even case, sum is m*(m+1), which is S. So s is floor(sqrt(S)).\n\nBut sqrt(m^2 +m) is m*sqrt(1 + 1/m) \u2192 which is approximately m + 0.5. But the floor is m.\n\nSo in even case, s is m.\n\nIn the odd case, sum is m\u00b2, so s is m.\n\nSo in all cases, s is m = (n+1)//2.\n\nBut why? Because for even n, sum is m(m+1) >= m\u00b2, but s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1)))=m.\n\nSo yes, the s is (n+1)//2.\n\nSo the formula for s is s = (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification. So regardless of the sum, the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut how? Let's see.\n\nFor example, when n=5: sum is 9, s=3. (5+1)/2=3.\n\nn=4: sum 6, s=2. (4+1)//2=2.\n\nn=6: sum 12, s=3. (6+1)//2=3.\n\nn=7: sum 16, s=4. (7+1)//2=4.\n\nn=2: sum 2, s=1. (2+1)//2=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is simply (n+1) // 2.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause for even n=2m, sum is m(m+1). The maximum s is m.\n\nBut m(m+1) >= m\u00b2, so s could be m.\n\nBut sqrt(m(m+1)) is larger than m, but the floor is m.\n\nWait, but when sum is m(m+1), then s\u00b2 can be up to m(m+1). So the maximum s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1))).\n\nBut why is that equal to m?\n\nBecause m(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2.\n\nFor example, m=3: sum is 12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. So floor is 3.\n\nWhich is m=3.\n\nSo for even n, s = m.\n\nWhich is equal to (n+1)//2.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n=2m-1, sum is m\u00b2. So s is m.\n\nWhich is equal to (2m-1 +1)//2 = m.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, this is a huge simplification. So the problem reduces to simply outputting (n+1)//2 for each test case.\n\nBut wait, let's check some more examples.\n\nTest case n=5: answer is 3. (5+1)//2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nTest case n=6: (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3 as integer. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. 3^2=9 <=12. So yes.\n\nBut wait, sum is 12. 3*4=12. The square is 3x4, but since the square's area is s\u00b2, the maximum s is floor(sqrt(12))=3.\n\nBut 3^2=9, which is less than 12. So why isn't the s 3, but could we make a larger square?\n\nWait, no. Because s^2 must be <= sum. So the maximum s is 3 for sum 12, but 3*4=12. Wait, but the sum is 12. So the total area is 12 (since each layer is 1 unit high, and sum is the total length of all blocks). So s^2 is 9, but sum is 12. So why can't s be 3? Because the sum is 12, which is greater than 3\u00b2=9. So 3 is allowed, but what about 4?\n\n4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3 is correct.\n\nSo for even n=6, s=3.\n\nWhich is (6+1)//2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the maximum possible s is (n+1)//2.\n\nSo the code is straightforward: for each test case, read n, compute (n+1)//2, output it.\n\nBut wait, that's not possible. What's the sample input 2?\n\nSample input 2 is n=5, output 3. Which matches (5+1)/2=3.\n\nAnother sample: first test case is n=1. (1+1)/2=1. Output is 1. Correct.\n\nSecond test case n=5: 3.\n\nSo the code is simply:\n\nfor each test case, output (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, when n is even, (n+1)//2 is (n+1)/2 using integer division.\n\nFor example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division in C++ (using / operator with integers) truncates to 2.\n\nWait, (n +1) divided by 2, in C++, using integer division.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while(t--) {\n        long long n; // in case n is up to 1e9, using long long\n        cin >> n;\n        cout << (n + 1)/2 << endl;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but according to our analysis, the answer is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me recheck.\n\nLet me take n=2: output should be 1. (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 integer division gives 1. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: 5/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=5: 6/2=3.\n\nn=6:7/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Correct.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nBecause the sum S(n) for n=2m even is m(m+1), and the maximum s is m. For n=2m-1, sum is m\u00b2, s is m. So s is m for both even and odd cases. And m is equal to (n+1)//2.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code is simply outputting (n+1)//2 for each test case.\n\nBut how can this be possible? Because the sum for even n is m(m+1), which allows for a square of s = m. Because m(m+1) >= m\u00b2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that.\n\nWow, I think this is the case. So the problem reduces to a very simple formula.\n\nThus, the missing code is to read t test cases, and for each, output (n+1)/2 using integer division.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead t.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nread n.\n\noutput (n + 1) / 2.\n\nIn C++, since n can be up to 1e9, using integer division (since n is an integer, (n+1)/2 in C++ when using variables of type int or long long will perform integer division).\n\nThus, the code is straightforward."
