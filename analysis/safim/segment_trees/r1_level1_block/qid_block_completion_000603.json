So the problem is about determining whether a given sequence b could have been formed by splitting some sequence a into segments and adding the length of each segment either to the left or right of the segment. For example, a segment like [1] could be sent as [1,1] or [1,1], depending on where the length is placed. Our task is to check if such a sequence b is valid. The code given uses a dynamic programming approach. The 'dp' array is initialized with dp[0] = 1 (probably indicating that after processing 0 elements, we're in a valid state), and then for each element in the sequence, they are updating the dp array.",

Let's think again. In the code's current structure, for each i in 1 to n, the code is processing each element of b in order. So for the second case, when processing j, if dp[j] is true, then for the position i = j + b[j], we need to mark that i can be set to true. But how to track this. An alternative is to precompute for each possible i, the j's that could contribute to it via j + b[j] = i.\n\nBut how? Because for each j, j can vary, and i is j + b[j]. But perhaps for each j, when we process j, if dp[j] is true, then we can check if j + b[j] is <=n, and if so, mark that dp[j + b[j]] can be set to true. Wait, but in the code's loop, we are processing i from 1 to n. For each j, when we process j, if dp[j] is true, then we can compute the i = j + b[j], and set dp[i] to true (provided i <=n). But this would require that for each j, we process j, and when dp[j] is true, we immediately set dp[i] where i = j + b[j] to true, if possible. But wait, the code's loop is for i from 1 to n. So in each iteration i, we process the current element, and then check for both possibilities. So the first possibility is handled by looking back to j = i - b[i] -1. The second possibility is handled by checking if any j < i has j + b[j] = i and dp[j] is true. But how to check that efficiently? One way is to, during the processing of each j, keep track of all j where j + b[j] = i. For example, when j is processed, and dp[j] is true, then j contributes to i = j + b[j]. So for that i, we can note that j is a possible candidate. Then, when i is processed, we check if any j's are stored for that i, and if any of them have dp[j] = true. But how to collect those j's. Since j can be up to i-1, and for each j, i = j + b[j], we can create a map from i to list of j's. Then, when processing i, we can look up all j's that have j + b[j] = i. Then, check if any of those j's have dp[j] = true. But building such a map for each test case would take O(n) time, which is acceptable. But for each j in 0 to i-1, we can compute i = j + b[j], and add j to the list of i's. Wait, but j here is the index in the array. Let me think about the 1-based vs 0-based indices.",

Alternatively, during the processing of each j, when j is being considered, and dp[j] is true, then we can immediately check if j + b[j] is <=n, and if so, set dp[j + b[j]] to true.

So putting this all together: the code must read each element of b into val (assuming the code is using 1-based indexing for the array), and then for each i, check the two cases. Now, the missing code is inside the loop for i in 1..n. So for each i, the code should read val (which is b[i]). Then, process the two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: the length is after the segment. So j = i - val - 1. If j >=0 and dp[j] is true, then dp[i] can be set to true. Case 2: the length is before the segment. So check if there exists any j where j + b[j] = i and dp[j] is true. If yes, then dp[i] can be set to true. But how to check case 2 efficiently. Because for each i, we need to check if any j (less than i) has j + b[j] = i and dp[j] is true. But if during the processing of j, whenever j is processed and dp[j] is true, we can add j to a list of j's that have j + b[j] = i (where i is j + b[j]). Then, for each i, when processing it, we can check the list of j's that have j + b[j] = i and see if any of them have dp[j] true. But how to track that. One way is to use a hash map (or array) that for each i, stores the list of j's that could lead to i in case 2. But given the constraints, perhaps we can precompute for each j, the i where j + b[j] = i, and for each i, collect all j's that could contribute to it. But how to do this in code. Let's see. Alternative approach:\n\nFor each test case, after reading the array b (elements from 1 to n in 1-based index), we can precompute a list for each possible i, which contains all j's where j + b[j] =i. Then, during processing, when i is being considered, we can check all j's in that list for i, and if any of them have dp[j] true, then set dp[i] to true. So during the preprocessing step for each test case:\n\n- Read all elements of b into an array (1-based index)\n- Create a map (like a vector of vectors) where for each i, we store all j's such that j + b[j] =i.\n\nThen, during the DP loop: For each i from 1 to n:\n\n- Read val (b[i])?

An efficient way would be to, for each j where dp[j] is true, precompute the i =j + b[j], and for those i's, when processing them, set dp[i] to true. But how to track this in code. Here's an idea: during processing of j, whenever dp[j] is true, we can compute the i =j + b[j]. If i <=n, we can add this i to a list. Then, when processing each i, we can check if there's any j in the list where j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true. But this would require maintaining a data structure that allows adding possible j's and checking when i is processed. Alternatively, since the code processes i in order, for each j, when dp[j] becomes true, we can note that i = j + b[j], and if this i is <=n, we can mark that i is reachable via case 2. But how to implement this. Wait, here's the approach:\n\n- For each j in 1..n:\n\n   When we process j, if dp[j] is true, then compute i = j + b[j].

But for large n, declaring a vector of size n+2 may be time-consuming. But since in C++, vectors can be declared with dynamic sizes, this is manageable. But given the code's existing structure, the code provided has a global variable 'val' and 'dp' array of size 200005. So perhaps in the code's solve function, the possible array is declared as a vector and resized for each test case. But for large n, using a vector<bool> possible may be more efficient. But let's proceed. So the code's missing part is inside the loop for i=1 to n. So the code inside that loop must read the elements into a vector, process the transitions. But the code's loop for i=1 to n is the same loop where the elements are read. So the code must first read all elements into a vector, then process them. But how?\n\nWait, the code's loop for i=1 to n is the same loop where the code is missing. So perhaps the code must read the elements into a vector first, then process the DP transitions in a separate loop. But the code's current structure is:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    cin >>n;\n\n    initialize dp[0] =1, others 0.\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n        // missing code here.\n\n    }\n\n    check dp[n].\n\n} So the code is missing the part where the elements are read and processed. So the correct approach is:\n\nInside the solve function: Read n.\n\nRead the next line's n elements into a vector b (1-based index). Initialize the dp array. Create a possible array (vector<bool> possible(n+2, false)). Loop from i=1 to n:\n\n   current element is b[i]. check case 1: j =i -b[i] -1. if j >=0 and dp[j] is true, then dp[i] =1.\n\n   check case 2: if possible[i] is true, then dp[i] =1.\n\n   if dp[i] is true, compute next_i =i +b[i]. if next_i <=n, set possible[next_i] = true.",

Thus, the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i]; // read into the vector.\n\n    // process case 1:\n\n    int j = i - b[i] -1;\n\n    if (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    // process case 2:\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    // update possible for future i's: if (dp[i]) {\n\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the code's solve function, this would require declaring the vector and possible array within the solve function. But in the code provided, the variables are global. However, the code must read the elements into a vector and use the possible array. Thus, the missing code would be:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    int j = i - b[i] - 1;\n\n    if (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n\n        dp[i] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (dp[i]) {\n\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in C++, vectors cannot be declared with a variable size unless using C++11 or later and using dynamic allocation.",

But the code provided's loop is for i=1 to n, and the code must read the elements in this loop.

But the code's existing loop is only one. So the code must read and process in the same loop. Thus, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nint val;\ncin >> val;\n// case 1: int j = i - val - 1;\nif (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n// case 2: check possible[i]\nif (possible[i]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n// update possible for future i's\nif (dp[i]) {\n    int next_i = i + val;\n    if (next_i <= n) {\n        possible[next_i] = true;\n    }\n} But the possible array must be declared inside the solve function as a vector of size n+2.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining whether a given sequence b could have been formed by splitting some sequence a into segments and adding the length of each segment either to the left or right of the segment. For example, a segment like [1] could be sent as [1,1] or [1,1], depending on where the length is placed. Our task is to check if such a sequence b is valid.\n\nThe code given uses a dynamic programming approach. The 'dp' array is initialized with dp[0] = 1 (probably indicating that after processing 0 elements, we're in a valid state), and then for each element in the sequence, they are updating the dp array. The idea is that dp[i] represents whether the first i elements of the sequence b form a valid configuration up to that point.\n\nHmm, so how does the DP transition work here? Let's think.\n\nEach position i in the array could be the start of a new segment or part of an existing segment. Wait, no. Wait, the DP approach here probably checks for possible positions where a segment could end.\n\nWait, maybe for each position i in the sequence b, we check if there's a possible segment that ends here. The segment's length would be either before or after the segment in the sequence.\n\nSo for a segment to end at position i, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. The current element is the length of a segment that starts at some position j. Then the segment would be from j+1 to i. But wait, if the length is at the start, then the segment is the next 'k' elements, where k is the value at j. So if the length is to the left of the segment, then the length is at position j, and the segment is j+1 to j + k. For this to be possible, j + k <= n.\n\nAlternatively, if the length is to the right of the segment, then the segment is from j to j + k -1, and the length is at j +k. So j +k <=n.\n\nSo, the DP approach would track possible positions where a segment ends. So dp[i] is true if there's a way to reach position i by ending a valid segment.\n\nSo for each i, we can check two possibilities:\n\na) The current element could be the length of a segment that starts before. So if there's a position j where dp[j] is true, and then from j, we have a segment of length b[i], which would start at j+1. So the segment would be from j+1 to j + b[i], and the length is at j. But wait, no. Wait, the length can be either before or after the segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is: for each position i in b, we check if the current element could be the length of a segment that ends here. Or starts here. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of building the DP array. For each i, we can look back and see if any possible previous positions j allowed a segment that ends at i.\n\nWait, for the DP to work, dp[i] is true if there's a valid way to split the first i elements into segments according to the rules.\n\nSo how do we transition?\n\nAt any position i, we can check two possibilities:\n\n1. The current element is the length of a segment that ends at i. So the length is stored here. Then the segment would start at i - len (length is stored at the end of the segment). The segment would be from (i - len) to i - 1. Then len must be equal to the length of that segment, which is len. Wait, but len is the length of the segment. So the length stored here is the same as the length of the segment. For example, if the segment is [1,2], then the length could be 2, stored after. So the segment starts at i - len, which would be i - 2, and the segment is positions i - len + 1 to i-1? No, wait. Let's see.\n\nIf the length is after the segment, then the segment is positions j to j + len -1, and the length is at j + len. So for this case, if i is the position of the length, then the segment is from i - len to i -1. So len must be equal to the value at i. Then, the length of the segment is len, and the length is stored at i. So the start of the segment is i - len. So for this case, if the length is after the segment, then the segment is i - len ... i-1, and the length is at i. So to have this, we need to check if the value at i is len, and len must be such that the segment starts at i - len and ends at i-1. Also, the position i - len -1 must have been reachable (dp[i - len -1] is true).\n\nWait, no. Because the segment starts after some previous end. For example, if the previous end was at position j, then the next segment starts at j+1. So in this case, if the length is stored at the end of the segment (i), then the segment starts at j+1, and the length is at i. So the length of the segment is (i - (j+1) + 1) = i -j. So the length must be equal to i -j, and that's the value at i. So for this to be possible, we need to have j such that i -j is equal to b[i], and j + (i - j) +1 = i+1? Not sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for the case where the length is at the end of the segment:\n\nThe segment is from j+1 to i-1. Then the length is at i. The length of the segment is (i-1 - (j+1) +1) = i - j -1. But the value at i is the length, which should be equal to i - j -1. So for this to hold, j must be i - b[i] -1. Wait, because b[i] is the length. So j+1 to i-1 is the segment, length is (i-1 - (j+1) +1) = i-j-1. So b[i] must equal i-j-1. So j must be i - b[i] -1.\n\nBut in that case, the previous segment must end at j. So for this to be possible, dp[j] must be true, and the current length is at i. So the condition is: if there exists j such that dp[j] is true, and j = i - b[i] -1. Then, after processing up to j, the next segment is j+1 to i-1 (length b[i], which is stored at i). So then, the current position i is after the length, so the next segment would start at i+1. So the end of this segment is i. Therefore, if this condition is met, then dp[i] can be set to true.\n\nSimilarly, for the case where the length is at the start of the segment. So the length is stored at position j, and the segment is j+1 to j + b[j]. So in this case, the length is at j, and the segment is j+1 to j + b[j]. So the length of the segment is b[j]. So the end of the segment is j + b[j], and the next segment would start there. So for the current position i, if there exists a j where j + b[j] == i, and dp[j] is true, then we can set dp[i] to true.\n\nSo combining these two possibilities: for each i, check both cases:\n\n1. The current i is the end of a segment where the length is after the segment. So check if there exists a j = i - len -1 (where len is b[i]), such that dp[j] is true. Then, i must be j + len + 1 (since j is the end of the previous segment, then the next segment starts at j+1. The segment is j+1 to j + len, and the length is j + len + 1 (i). So j + len + 1 must equal i. So len = b[i], so j = i - b[i] -1. So if j is >=0 and dp[j] is true, then dp[i] can be set to true.\n\n2. The current i is the end of a segment where the length is before the segment. So the length is at some j, and the segment is j+1 to j + b[j]. So the end is j + b[j]. So for i to be j + b[j], then j can be any position before i where j + b[j] == i. And dp[j] must be true. Then, after processing the segment, the end is i, so dp[i] is true.\n\nSo the transitions for dp[i] are:\n\ndp[i] = true if either:\n\n- There exists j where j = i - b[i] -1, and dp[j] is true.\n\nOR\n\n- There exists j where j + b[j] == i, and dp[j] is true.\n\nSo in the code, for each i from 1 to n, we need to check these two possibilities.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe first case: for each i, compute j = i - b[i] - 1. If j is >=0 and dp[j] is 1, then set dp[i] to 1.\n\nThe second case: for each j, when we process j, we can mark that j + b[j] is a possible candidate. So for each j where dp[j] is true, we can precompute the position j + b[j], and when i reaches that position, check if any j has dp[j] true and j + b[j] == i.\n\nBut if we process this in a loop for each i, how to check if there's any j such that j + b[j] == i and dp[j] is true.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the loop is over i from 1 to n. For each i, we need to check the two possibilities.\n\nThe first possibility is easy: compute j and check dp[j].\n\nThe second possibility is harder. How do we know if there's a j such that j + b[j] == i and dp[j] is true?\n\nBut for the second case, j must be such that j + b[j] = i. So for each j, when we process j, we can note that if dp[j] is true, then when we reach i = j + b[j], then we can set dp[i] to true.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is over i. So how can we track which j's have j + b[j] equal to i?\n\nAn alternative approach is to, for each j, if dp[j] becomes true, then we can precompute the position i = j + b[j], and if that i is within bounds (<=n), then we can mark that when we reach i, this j contributes to dp[i] being true.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nWait, perhaps using a queue or a set. But for the given constraints (n up to 2e5), we need an O(n) approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think again.\n\nIn the code's current structure, for each i in 1 to n, the code is processing each element of b in order.\n\nSo for the second case, when processing j, if dp[j] is true, then for the position i = j + b[j], we need to mark that i can be set to true. But how to track this.\n\nAn alternative is to precompute for each possible i, the j's that could contribute to it via j + b[j] = i.\n\nBut how? Because for each j, j can vary, and i is j + b[j].\n\nBut perhaps for each j, when we process j, if dp[j] is true, then we can check if j + b[j] is <=n, and if so, mark that dp[j + b[j]] can be set to true.\n\nWait, but in the code's loop, we are processing i from 1 to n. For each j, when we process j, if dp[j] is true, then we can compute the i = j + b[j], and set dp[i] to true (provided i <=n).\n\nBut this would require that for each j, we process j, and when dp[j] is true, we immediately set dp[i] where i = j + b[j] to true, if possible.\n\nBut wait, the code's loop is for i from 1 to n. So in each iteration i, we process the current element, and then check for both possibilities.\n\nSo the first possibility is handled by looking back to j = i - b[i] -1.\n\nThe second possibility is handled by checking if any j < i has j + b[j] = i and dp[j] is true.\n\nBut how to check that efficiently?\n\nOne way is to, during the processing of each j, keep track of all j where j + b[j] = i. For example, when j is processed, and dp[j] is true, then j contributes to i = j + b[j]. So for that i, we can note that j is a possible candidate. Then, when i is processed, we check if any j's are stored for that i, and if any of them have dp[j] = true.\n\nBut how to collect those j's. Since j can be up to i-1, and for each j, i = j + b[j], we can create a map from i to list of j's. Then, when processing i, we can look up all j's that have j + b[j] = i. Then, check if any of those j's have dp[j] = true.\n\nBut building such a map for each test case would take O(n) time, which is acceptable. But for each j in 0 to i-1, we can compute i = j + b[j], and add j to the list of i's.\n\nWait, but j here is the index in the array. Let me think about the 1-based vs 0-based indices. Because in the code, the array is read as b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. So the code's loop is for i from 1 to n.\n\nWait, in the code's code:\n\nThe code reads n, then the sequence b_1 to b_n.\n\nIn the code's loop for the DP, i starts at 1 and goes up to n. So the indices in the code are 1-based.\n\nSo for each j (1-based), when processing j, if dp[j] is true, then the possible i is j + b[j]. So that i must be <=n.\n\nSo during the processing of j, if dp[j] is true, and j + b[j] <=n, then we can mark that for i = j + b[j], this j is a candidate. So when we reach i = j + b[j], we can check if any j's in the list for i have dp[j] true.\n\nBut how to collect these j's.\n\nOne approach is to have an array (or a list) for each i, which contains all j's that could contribute to i via j + b[j] =i. Then, when processing i, we check all such j's and see if any of them have dp[j] true.\n\nBut building this array for each test case would require O(n) time and space, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of each j, when j is being considered, and dp[j] is true, then we can immediately check if j + b[j] is <=n, and if so, set dp[j + b[j]] to true. But that's not correct, because j is processed in order, and the code's loop is for i from 1 to n. So when processing j, the code hasn't processed j + b[j] yet.\n\nWait, for example, j is 1. Then j + b[j] could be 3. Then, when j is processed (i=1), we check if j + b[j] (3) is <=n. If yes, then we can set dp[3] = true. But when processing i=3, we can handle that.\n\nBut this approach would require that when j is processed, if dp[j] is true, then we can immediately set dp[j + b[j]] to true. Because that's the second case (length is before the segment). So for this case, when j is processed, and dp[j] is true, then the next possible position is j + b[j], which is the end of the segment. So in the code, during the loop for i from 1 to n, for each i, after handling the first case, we can check if any j's from previous steps have j + b[j] == i. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps when processing i, the code checks:\n\n1. Check if i is the end of a segment where the length is after (case 1). So j = i - b[i] - 1. If j is >=0 and dp[j] is true, then set dp[i] to true.\n\n2. Check if there exists any j where j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true. If any such j exists, set dp[i] to true.\n\nBut how to efficiently check the second condition? Because for each i, we need to check all j's such that j + b[j] ==i. But how to track those j's.\n\nHmm. So for each test case, we can create a hashmap (or an array of lists) that maps i to a list of j's where j + b[j] =i. Then, during processing of each i, we can look up the j's in the list for i, and check if any of them have dp[j] = true.\n\nBut how to build this hashmap. For each j from 1 to n, compute i = j + b[j], and add j to the list for i.\n\nBut wait, in the code's code, the input for each test case is stored in b_1 to b_n (assuming that the code is using 1-based indices for the array). Wait, but in the code, the loop is for i from 1 to n. Let me check:\n\nThe code's input is read into 'val' for each element. Wait, the code's for loop is for i from 1 to n, and for each i, it's doing something. But in the code as given, the missing part is inside this loop. So the code for each i in 1..n reads the elements? Or perhaps the code is incomplete.\n\nWait, the code given is:\n\nvoid solve() {\n    cin >> n;\n\n    dp[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <=n; i++) dp[i] = 0;\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n        // TODO: code here\n    }\n\n    if (dp[n] ==1) cout YES else NO.\n}\n\nWait, so the code is missing the part where the elements of b are read. Oh wait, the code given in the problem is incomplete. So the code for solve() is supposed to read n, then the elements of b. But in the code as provided, after reading n, the code initializes dp[0] to 1 and the others to 0, then loops from i=1 to n, but the code for processing each element is missing. Oh right, the code has a comment saying \"your code here\" inside the loop.\n\nSo the code is missing the part where the elements of b are read. Wait, but in the code, in the solve function, after reading n, the code proceeds to initialize the dp array and then loops i from 1 to n. So the missing code must include reading each element of b, and processing them to update the dp array.\n\nWait, but how is the sequence b stored? Because the code as given has a variable 'val' declared as a global variable. So perhaps in the loop, for each i, the code reads the next element into 'val', and then processes it.\n\nSo the code's missing part is inside the loop for i from 1 to n, where for each i, the code reads the element into 'val' (assuming that the elements are read in order). Then, process the DP transitions.\n\nBut in the problem statement's sample inputs, the second line of each test case contains the elements of b. So the code must read all elements of b for each test case. So the missing code in the for loop for i=1 to n would include reading each element into an array, but the code provided has a variable 'val' declared globally. So perhaps the code is intended to read the elements into a variable (like val) one by one, and process them on the fly, without storing the entire array.\n\nBut that depends on the code's approach. So in the code, during the loop for i=1 to n, for each i, we read b[i] into val (but perhaps the code is using a 1-based array). Alternatively, since the code is using a global variable val, perhaps for each i, they read the element into val, then process it.\n\nBut that's probably the case. So in the loop for i from 1 to n, the code reads val (each element of the sequence), then checks the two possibilities for transitions.\n\nSo putting this all together: the code must read each element of b into val (assuming the code is using 1-based indexing for the array), and then for each i, check the two cases.\n\nNow, the missing code is inside the loop for i in 1..n. So for each i, the code should read val (which is b[i]).\n\nThen, process the two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: the length is after the segment. So j = i - val - 1. If j >=0 and dp[j] is true, then dp[i] can be set to true.\n\nCase 2: the length is before the segment. So check if there exists any j where j + b[j] = i and dp[j] is true. If yes, then dp[i] can be set to true.\n\nBut how to check case 2 efficiently. Because for each i, we need to check if any j (less than i) has j + b[j] = i and dp[j] is true.\n\nBut if during the processing of j, whenever j is processed and dp[j] is true, we can add j to a list of j's that have j + b[j] = i (where i is j + b[j]). Then, for each i, when processing it, we can check the list of j's that have j + b[j] = i and see if any of them have dp[j] true.\n\nBut how to track that. One way is to use a hash map (or array) that for each i, stores the list of j's that could lead to i in case 2.\n\nBut given the constraints, perhaps we can precompute for each j, the i where j + b[j] = i, and for each i, collect all j's that could contribute to it.\n\nBut how to do this in code. Let's see.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each test case, after reading the array b (elements from 1 to n in 1-based index), we can precompute a list for each possible i, which contains all j's where j + b[j] =i. Then, during processing, when i is being considered, we can check all j's in that list for i, and if any of them have dp[j] true, then set dp[i] to true.\n\nSo during the preprocessing step for each test case:\n\n- Read all elements of b into an array (1-based index)\n- Create a map (like a vector of vectors) where for each i, we store all j's such that j + b[j] =i.\n\nThen, during the DP loop:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n- Read val (b[i])? Wait, no. Because the code's loop for i from 1 to n is the same loop where the elements are being read. So the code must read the elements in order. So perhaps the code is supposed to read each element as it's processed.\n\nBut in the given code, the code's loop is for i from 1 to n, and inside that loop, the code is missing the part where each element is read. So the code must read the elements into an array as part of the loop.\n\nWait, but the code provided doesn't read the elements. So perhaps the missing code in the loop includes reading the elements into the array. So perhaps the code is supposed to read each element into a vector b, and then process the transitions.\n\nBut given that the code provided has a global variable 'val', maybe the code is supposed to read each element into val, then process it for the current i.\n\nBut how to store the array? Because for case 2, we need to know b[j] for j < i. So perhaps during the loop, the code is supposed to read all elements into a temporary array first, then process them. But in the code provided, the loop for i from 1 to n is where the elements are read. So the code is missing the part where the elements are read and stored in a vector.\n\nSo the first thing the code must do in the solve function is read n, then read the n elements into a vector b (1-based). Then, initialize the dp array.\n\nBut the code provided's loop for i from 1 to n is empty. So the missing code must include reading the elements of b and processing the DP transitions.\n\nAlternatively, the code is missing the part where during the loop for each i, it reads the element into val, then processes the DP transitions.\n\nBut then, to handle case 2 (j + b[j] =i), since j ranges from 1 to i-1, and in order to compute j + b[j], we need to know the value of b[j] for j < i. But if the elements are read in the loop in order (from 1 to n), then during processing i, the code has already read and stored (or processed) the previous elements.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, there's no array for the elements. The code uses a variable 'val' which is global. So perhaps during the loop, for each i, the code reads the element into val, which represents b[i], and then processes the transitions.\n\nBut then, to handle case 2, where j + b[j] =i, we need to know the b[j] for j <i, but since we read the elements in order, during the processing of j, we would have read b[j] into val, but there's no array to store it. So this approach would not work, because when processing i, we don't have access to the previous elements' values.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because for case 2, we need to know the value of b[j] for j <i. But if the code reads each element into val and does not store them in an array, then there's no way to retrieve the previous values.\n\nTherefore, the code must read the entire array b first, then process the DP transitions. So the missing code must first read the array elements into a vector, then proceed to process each i from 1 to n.\n\nBut in the code provided, the loop for i from 1 to n is where the code is missing. So the code must read the elements into a vector during that loop. For example, in the solve function:\n\nAfter reading n, read the next line's elements into a vector b of size n+1 (1-based). Then, initialize the dp array, then loop through i from 1 to n, processing each element.\n\nBut the code given doesn't do that. The code's loop for i from 1 to n is where the missing code is, and that's where the elements are being read. So the code must read each element into a variable (like val) in each iteration of the loop, but then store them into a vector. Otherwise, there's no way to retrieve the previous values for case 2.\n\nSo the code's loop for i from 1 to n must:\n\n1. Read the current element (val) into a vector b at position i.\n\nThen, process the DP transitions for case 1 and case 2.\n\nSo the missing code would include reading the elements into a vector, then processing the transitions. But the code provided does not have such a vector. Hence, the missing code must include the code to read the elements into a vector.\n\nBut since the code provided has a loop from i=1 to n, perhaps the code inside the loop reads each element into a vector. So the code would look like:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1); // 1-based indexing\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n    cin >> b[i];\n    // process dp here\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, the code's loop for i=1 to n is empty. So the missing code is inside this loop. So the code would read the elements into a vector, and then process the DP transitions.\n\nTherefore, the code must have a vector to store the elements of b.\n\nBut given the code's current structure, which uses a global variable val, perhaps the code is intended to read each element into val, then process it. But that's not sufficient for case 2.\n\nThus, the code must read all elements into a vector first, then process each i in 1..n. But the code's current structure has the loop for processing the DP in the same loop as reading the elements, which is not possible. Because in case 2, when processing i, we need to know b[j] for j <i.\n\nTherefore, the code must read the entire array first, then process each i from 1 to n in a separate loop.\n\nBut the code provided has the loop from i=1 to n where the missing code is. So the code must read the elements in that loop, store them into a vector, and then after that loop, process the DP. But this is not the case. Because in the code provided, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo this loop is where the code is missing. So during this loop, the code must read the elements into a vector, and then process the DP transitions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is missing two parts: one loop to read the elements into a vector, and another loop to process the DP transitions. But the code provided has only one loop.\n\nThis suggests that the code provided is incorrect, but we have to fill in the missing code as per the problem's instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read each element into val, and during the processing of each i, process the DP transitions for case 1 and case 2.\n\nBut for case 2, we need to look back at j's where j + b[j] ==i. However, when processing i, we have not yet stored the value of b[j] for j >=i. So this approach can't work.\n\nThus, the code must first read all elements into a vector, then process each i in a loop, using the vector to refer to previous elements.\n\nTherefore, the missing code must first read the entire array into a vector, then process each i from 1 to n.\n\nBut according to the code's given structure, the loop for i from 1 to n is the same loop where the elements are read. So the code's missing part must include reading the elements into a vector.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n    cin >> b[i];\n    // process DP for i here\n}\n\nBut how to process the DP for i here. Because for case 2, j can be any position <i where j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true.\n\nSo during the loop for i, after reading b[i], the code can process the two cases:\n\nCase 1: j = i - b[i] -1. If j >=0 and dp[j] is true, then dp[i] is true.\n\nCase 2: Check if there's any j where j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true.\n\nBut how to check case 2. Since the code is processing i in order, and during the processing of i, the code has access to the previous elements of b.\n\nBut case 2 requires that for some j <i, j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true. So during the processing of i, the code can loop through all j <i and check if j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true. But this approach is O(n^2), which is not acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo this approach would not be efficient enough. Thus, we need a way to track all possible j's that could contribute to i in case 2.\n\nSo here's the problem: how to efficiently check for case 2 during processing i.\n\nAn efficient way would be to, for each j where dp[j] is true, precompute the i =j + b[j], and for those i's, when processing them, set dp[i] to true.\n\nBut how to track this in code.\n\nHere's an idea: during processing of j, whenever dp[j] is true, we can compute the i =j + b[j]. If i <=n, we can add this i to a list. Then, when processing each i, we can check if there's any j in the list where j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true.\n\nBut this would require maintaining a data structure that allows adding possible j's and checking when i is processed.\n\nAlternatively, since the code processes i in order, for each j, when dp[j] becomes true, we can note that i = j + b[j], and if this i is <=n, we can mark that i is reachable via case 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, here's the approach:\n\n- For each j in 1..n:\n\n   When we process j, if dp[j] is true, then compute i = j + b[j]. If i <=n, then we can set a flag for i, indicating that it is reachable via case 2.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a queue or a set to track the j's that contribute to case 2.\n\nBut perhaps the code can use an array to track possible j's.\n\nWait, but the code must process i in order, and for each i, after checking case 1, also check if any j has j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true.\n\nSo during the processing of i, after case 1, the code can check if any j <i has j + b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true. But this would require O(1) time.\n\nBut how?\n\nAh! Here's a possible optimization. Since j can be up to i-1, and j + b[j] =i. So during processing j, when we set dp[j] to true, we can compute i =j + b[j], and if this i is <=n, then we can add this i to a list (like a set or a hash map) where for each i, we track that there's a j that can reach it via case 2. Then, when processing i, if i is in this list, and the j's that contribute to it have dp[j] true, then dp[i] can be set to true.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nAnother approach: when processing j, if dp[j] is true, then for i =j + b[j], we can mark that i is reachable via case 2. For example, we can maintain a boolean array 'possible' where possible[i] is true if there's any j <i that can reach i via case 2. Then, when processing i, if possible[i] is true, then dp[i] can be set to true.\n\nBut this array 'possible' can be maintained as follows:\n\n- Initialize all possible[i] to false.\n\n- For each j from 1 to n:\n\n   If dp[j] is true, compute i =j + b[j].\n\n   If i <=n, set possible[i] to true.\n\nThen, during processing of i, case 2 is handled by checking possible[i].\n\nBut this approach is not correct because possible[i] is set to true based on j's that have dp[j] true at the time of processing j. However, if j is processed before i, and possible[i] is set, but later j's can also contribute to i. So this approach may not capture all possible j's that can reach i via case 2.\n\nWait, no. Because j is processed in order from 1 to n. So when j is processed, if dp[j] becomes true, then i =j + b[j] is computed. If i is <=n, then possible[i] is marked. But this marks all j's that can contribute to i via case 2. However, if j is processed after i, then possible[i] will not be marked.\n\nBut j is processed in order from 1 to n. So for j <i, j is processed before i. So when processing j, if dp[j] is true, then possible[j + b[j]] is set to true. Thus, when processing i, possible[i] would already include all j's that are <i and have j +b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true.\n\nBut this is not the case. Because possible[i] is set during the processing of j's, which are processed before i. But j can be any j <i. So if during processing j, we set possible[j +b[j]] to true, then when i is j +b[j], which could be greater than j, and thus processed later.\n\nSo for example, j=2, b[j] =3. Then j +b[j] =5. possible[5] is set to true when j=2 is processed, assuming dp[j] is true. Then, when i=5 is processed, possible[i] is true, so case 2 applies.\n\nBut this approach has a problem: possible[i] is set to true based on j's that have been processed so far, but not those that may be processed after. However, since j's are processed in order, this is correct.\n\nBecause j can only be less than i. Because j is processed in order, when j is processed, i could be j +b[j], which is >=j. So when processing j, possible[i] is marked for j's contribution. Then, when i is processed later, possible[i] is checked.\n\nBut possible[i] is set during the processing of j's, not during the processing of i.\n\nBut how can the code set possible[i] for j's that have not been processed yet. It can't. So this approach would only consider j's that are processed before i. Which is correct, because j must be <i.\n\nThus, the possible array can be maintained as follows:\n\n- possible is initialized to false for all i.\n\n- For each j from 1 to n:\n\n   If dp[j] is true, compute i =j +b[j].\n\n   If i <=n, then set possible[i] to true.\n\nThen, during processing of i, case 2 is handled by checking possible[i].\n\nBut this is only valid if possible[i] is true, meaning there exists a j <i where j +b[j] ==i and dp[j] is true.\n\nBut when j is processed before i, this is correct.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut in the code's loop for processing i from 1 to n, after reading b[i], we need to:\n\n1. Check case 1: j =i -b[i] -1. If j >=0 and dp[j] is true, set dp[i] to true.\n\n2. Check case 2: if possible[i] is true, set dp[i] to true.\n\nBut then, after processing i, if dp[i] is true, compute i +b[i], and if that's <=n, set possible[i +b[i]] to true.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nfor each i in 1..n:\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    // case 1:\n\n    j = i - b[i] -1;\n\n    if (j >=0 && dp[j] ==1) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    // case 2:\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    // update possible for future i's:\n\n    if (dp[i] ==1) {\n\n        next_i = i +b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] =1;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nBut possible is an array that starts as all false. As j's are processed (i's here), when a j (i) is processed and dp[j] is true, then possible[j +b[j]] is set to true.\n\nThis way, for j's processed before i, their contribution to possible[i] is already recorded.\n\nSo this approach would handle both cases.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nThe code would need to have an array 'possible' of size n+2 (since i can be up to n, and j +b[j] can be up to n + 1e9, but we have to check if it's <=n).\n\nBut for the code to be efficient, we can use a boolean array possible of size n+2.\n\nBut in the code's current structure, the variables are global. So the code would need to declare 'possible' as a global array. But the code provided uses a global 'dp' array of size 200005, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, the code must reset the possible array for each test case.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a vector possible and reset it for each test case.\n\nSo in the code's solve function:\n\nAfter reading n, the code reads the elements into a vector b of size n+1.\n\nThen, initializes dp[0] =1, and the rest of dp to 0.\n\nInitializes a possible array (vector<bool> possible(n+2, false)).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\n   j =i -b[i] -1.\n\n   if (j >=0 and dp[j] ==1) then set dp[i] =1.\n\n   if (possible[i] is true) then set dp[i] =1.\n\n   if (dp[i] ==1 and i +b[i] <=n) then possible[i +b[i]] = true.\n\nBut wait, possible is a per-test-case array. So for each test case, possible is reinitialized.\n\nYes. So for each test case, we create a possible array and process it.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, this would require O(2e5 * 1e4) memory, which is 2e9, which is way too much. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nWait, but no. Because for each test case, the possible array is size O(n), and after the test case is processed, it's discarded. So for each test case, the possible array is of size up to 2e5, and sum of n over all test cases is 2e5. So total memory is O(2e5), which is acceptable.\n\nThus, in the code's solve function:\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read the elements into a vector b (1-based index).\n\n3. Initialize dp[0] =1, dp[1..n] =0.\n\n4. Initialize a possible array of size n+2, all false.\n\n5. For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. Check case 1: j =i -b[i] -1.\n\n   b. If j >=0 and dp[j] is true, set dp[i] =1.\n\n   c. Check case 2: if possible[i] is true, set dp[i] =1.\n\n   d. If dp[i] is true, then compute next_i =i +b[i]. If next_i <=n, set possible[next_i] = true.\n\n6. After processing all i, check if dp[n] is true.\n\nBut the code's existing variables are global. So the possible array can be a global array, but for each test case, it's initialized.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, since the possible array is needed only per test case, it can be declared inside the solve function as a vector.\n\nBut for large n, declaring a vector of size n+2 may be time-consuming. But since in C++, vectors can be declared with dynamic sizes, this is manageable.\n\nBut given the code's existing structure, the code provided has a global variable 'val' and 'dp' array of size 200005. So perhaps in the code's solve function, the possible array is declared as a vector and resized for each test case.\n\nBut for large n, using a vector<bool> possible may be more efficient.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nSo the code's missing part is inside the loop for i=1 to n. So the code inside that loop must read the elements into a vector, process the transitions.\n\nBut the code's loop for i=1 to n is the same loop where the elements are read. So the code must first read all elements into a vector, then process them. But how?\n\nWait, the code's loop for i=1 to n is the same loop where the code is missing. So perhaps the code must read the elements into a vector first, then process the DP transitions in a separate loop.\n\nBut the code's current structure is:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    cin >>n;\n\n    initialize dp[0] =1, others 0.\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n        // missing code here.\n\n    }\n\n    check dp[n].\n\n}\n\nSo the code is missing the part where the elements are read and processed.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nInside the solve function:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next line's n elements into a vector b (1-based index).\n\nInitialize the dp array.\n\nCreate a possible array (vector<bool> possible(n+2, false)).\n\nLoop from i=1 to n:\n\n   current element is b[i].\n\n   check case 1: j =i -b[i] -1.\n\n   if j >=0 and dp[j] is true, then dp[i] =1.\n\n   check case 2: if possible[i] is true, then dp[i] =1.\n\n   if dp[i] is true, compute next_i =i +b[i]. if next_i <=n, set possible[next_i] = true.\n\nThus, the missing code would involve:\n\n- Reading the elements into a vector.\n\n- Processing the cases for each i.\n\nBut the code provided doesn't have a vector. So the missing code must include:\n\n- Reading the elements into a vector.\n\n- Processing the DP transitions.\n\nBut in the code provided, the code's loop for i=1 to n is where the elements are read and processed.\n\nSo the code must be modified to read the elements into a vector first, then process each i.\n\nBut the code's structure is as follows:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    cin >>n;\n\n    reset dp.\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n        // code here.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo during this loop, the code must read each element into a vector and process the DP transitions.\n\nBut how to do both in the same loop.\n\nAh, so the code can read each element into a temporary variable (val) and store it in a vector.\n\nSo inside the loop:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1); // 1-based.\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    // process DP for i.\n\n}\n\nThen, after reading the entire vector, process the DP transitions.\n\nBut no, the code's loop is for processing each i in 1..n. So the code can read the elements into a vector in this loop, and then process the transitions in the same loop.\n\nThus, the code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> val;\n\nb[i] = val;\n\n// process cases.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    // process cases 1 and 2.\n\n}\n\nBut this is not possible in the code's given structure. Because the code's loop is for i from 1 to n, and inside this loop, the code must read each element and process the DP transitions.\n\nBut to process the DP transitions for i, the code needs the elements of b from 1 to i.\n\nThus, the code can read each element into a vector and process the transitions in the same loop.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    // process case 1 and case 2.\n\n}\n\nBut then, the code also needs to handle the possible array.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nInside the solve function:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the elements into a vector b of size n+1.\n\nInitialize dp[0] =1.\n\nInitialize possible array as vector<bool>(n+2, false).\n\nLoop for i from 1 to n:\n\n   // case 1: j =i -b[i] -1.\n\n   int j = i - b[i] - 1;\n\n   if (j >=0 && dp[j] ==1) {\n\n       dp[i] =1;\n\n   }\n\n   // case 2: possible[i] is true.\n\n   if (possible[i]) {\n\n       dp[i] =1;\n\n   }\n\n   // update possible for future i's.\n\n   if (dp[i] ==1) {\n\n       int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n       if (next_i <=n) {\n\n           possible[next_i] = true;\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\nAt the end, check if dp[n] is 1.\n\nBut in the code provided, the possible array is not declared. So the code must declare a vector<bool> possible of size n+2 for each test case.\n\nThus, the missing code must include:\n\nReading the elements into a vector.\n\nDeclaring and initializing the possible array.\n\nProcessing the two cases for each i.\n\nBut in the code provided, the code's loop is for i from 1 to n, and the code inside must fill in.\n\nThus, the code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> val;\n\nb[i] = val;\n\n// process cases.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is missing:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n}\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    int j = i - b[i] -1;\n\n    if (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (dp[i]) {\n\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the code's loop is already present as for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) { ... }\n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n}\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    int j = i - b[i] - 1;\n\n    if (j >= 0 && dp[j]) {\n\n        dp[i] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (dp[i]) {\n\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut how to fit this into the code's existing loop.\n\nThe code provided's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i ++) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nSo the code must read the elements into the vector inside this loop, and process the DP transitions.\n\nThus, the code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> b[i];\n\nBut this requires declaring a vector b outside the loop.\n\nBut in the code provided, there's no vector. So the code must first declare a vector b of size n+1, read the elements into it, then process the DP transitions.\n\nBut the code's existing code has the loop for i from 1 to n. So the code must read the elements into the vector inside this loop.\n\nThus, the code would look like:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n}\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    // process DP.\n\n}\n\nBut the code's existing loop is the same loop where the elements are read. So the code must read the elements and process the DP in the same loop.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, the code must read the elements into a vector first, then process the DP in a separate loop.\n\nBut the code's existing code has only one loop. So perhaps the code's missing code is split into two loops:\n\nThe first loop reads the elements into the vector.\n\nThe second loop processes the DP transitions.\n\nThus, the code inside solve would be:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n}\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    // process DP.\n\n}\n\nBut this would require adding the code for the second loop, which is not present in the code provided.\n\nBut the code provided has a single loop for i=1 to n.\n\nThus, the code's missing code must include:\n\n- Declaring a vector to store b.\n\n- Reading the elements into it.\n\n- Declaring a possible array.\n\n- Processing the two cases for each i in a separate loop.\n\nBut this is not possible within the code's existing structure. Hence, the code provided must be modified.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, we are to fill in the missing code blocks. So the code provided has a loop for i=1 to n, and the missing code is inside that loop.\n\nTherefore, the code must read the elements into a vector inside this loop, then process the transitions in the same loop.\n\nBut this is not possible, since the possible array depends on j's that are processed in order.\n\nThus, perhaps the code's structure is flawed, but we have to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, the code's existing loop is the one that processes the elements and the DP transitions in the same loop. So for each i:\n\n1. Read the element into val (which is b[i].\n\n2. Check case 1 and case 2.\n\n3. Update the possible array.\n\nBut the problem is that for case 2, we need to know b[j] for j <i. But if we haven't stored them in a vector, we can't access them.\n\nThus, the code must store the elements into a vector, which is possible by reading all elements first, then processing the DP transitions.\n\nBut the code's existing loop is the same loop where the elements are read. So the code must read the elements into a vector first, then process the DP transitions in another loop.\n\nBut the code's current structure has only one loop. So the missing code must include:\n\nInside the loop for i=1 to n:\n\n    Read each element into a vector.\n\nAfter that loop, process another loop for i=1 to n, processing the DP transitions.\n\nBut the code's current structure has only one loop. So this is not possible.\n\nThus, the code's structure is incorrect, but we have to fill in the missing code as per the problem's instruction.\n\nPerhaps the code's loop for i=1 to n is used for both reading the elements and processing the DP transitions.\n\nBut in that case, the code must store the elements in a vector and process the transitions in the same loop.\n\nThus, the code would look like:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    // process case 1 and case 2.\n\n}\n\nBut the processing of case 2 requires that for each i, we have access to the possible array, which is being built as we process i in order.\n\nBut in this case, the code processes i from 1 to n in order, and for each i:\n\n- case 1 is handled using j = i -b[i] -1.\n\n- case 2 is handled by checking possible[i].\n\nThen, if dp[i] is true, update possible[i +b[i]].\n\nThus, the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i]; // read into the vector.\n\n    // process case 1:\n\n    int j = i - b[i] -1;\n\n    if (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    // process case 2:\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    // update possible for future i's:\n\n    if (dp[i]) {\n\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the code's solve function, this would require declaring the vector and possible array within the solve function.\n\nBut in the code provided, the variables are global. However, the code must read the elements into a vector and use the possible array.\n\nThus, the missing code would be:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    int j = i - b[i] - 1;\n\n    if (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n\n        dp[i] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (dp[i]) {\n\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in C++, vectors cannot be declared with a variable size unless using C++11 or later and using dynamic allocation.\n\nThus, the code must use dynamic allocation for the vectors.\n\nBut given that the code is using global variables, this is possible.\n\nBut in the code provided, there's no vector for b or possible.\n\nThus, the code's missing part must include declaring these vectors.\n\nBut the code's existing code uses a global 'val' variable, which is an integer. So the code must read each element into val, and store it in a vector.\n\nBut this is not possible in the code provided's structure.\n\nThus, the code's structure is incorrect, but we must fill in the missing code as per the problem's instruction.\n\nAfter analyzing all possibilities, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n- Read the element into val (b[i]).\n\n- Check case 1: j =i - val -1.\n\n- Check case 2: possible[i] is true.\n\n- Update possible array if dp[i] is true.\n\nBut to track case 2, the code must have a possible array that is dynamically managed.\n\nBut the code's existing variables are global. So the possible array must be declared as a global array, but this is not feasible for multiple test cases. Alternatively, the possible array can be declared inside the solve function as a dynamic array.\n\nBut in C++, for each test case, the possible array can be declared as a vector of size n+2.\n\nThus, the code's missing part would be:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n}\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    int j = i - b[i] - 1;\n\n    if (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n\n        dp[i] = 1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (possible[i]) {\n\n        dp[i] =1;\n\n    }\n\n    if (dp[i]) {\n\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n        if (next_i <=n) {\n\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut how to fit this into the code's existing loop.\n\nBut the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    /* TODO */\n\n}\n\nThus, the code must read the elements into a vector inside this loop and process the DP transitions.\n\nBut this is not possible, since the vector must be declared outside the loop.\n\nThus, the code's structure is incorrect, but according to the problem's instruction, we must fill in the missing code.\n\nAfter carefully considering all possibilities, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nInside the loop for i=1 to n:\n\n- Read the current element into val (b[i]).\n\n- Process case 1: j =i - val -1.\n\n- Process case 2: possible[i].\n\n- Update possible array for future i's.\n\nBut without a vector, how to track the b array.\n\nThis is impossible, as the code's existing structure does not store the b array. Therefore, the code must have a vector to store the elements of b.\n\nThus, the missing code must include:\n\nDeclare a vector b of size n+1.\n\nRead each element into b[i] in the loop.\n\nDeclare a possible array.\n\nProcess the two cases.\n\nThus, the missing code would be:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    cin >> b[i];\n    int j = i - b[i] - 1;\n    if (j >= 0 && dp[j]) {\n        dp[i] = 1;\n    }\n    if (possible[i]) {\n        dp[i] = 1;\n    }\n    if (dp[i]) {\n        int next_i = i + b[i];\n        if (next_i <= n) {\n            possible[next_i] = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBut how to manage the possible array for each test case.\n\nBut in C++, declaring a vector inside the solve function for each test case is possible.\n\nThus, this code would handle each test case correctly.\n\nBut in the code provided, the possible array is not declared. So the code must include this.\n\nBut the code's existing code does not have the vector declarations. Thus, the missing code must include:\n\nInside the solve function:\n\nAfter reading n:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nThen, read the elements into b, and process the DP transitions.\n\nThus, the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> b[i];\n\n    // process cases.\n\n}\n\nBut this is not possible in the code's existing loop, which is a single loop.\n\nBut the code's loop is for i from 1 to n, and the code must read the elements and process the transitions in the same loop.\n\nThus, the code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> b[i];\n\nint j = i - b[i] -1;\n\nif (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n\n    dp[i] =1;\n\n}\n\nif (possible[i]) {\n\n    dp[i] =1;\n\n}\n\nif (dp[i]) {\n\n    int next_i = i + b[i];\n\n    if (next_i <=n) {\n\n        possible[next_i] = true;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the code must declare the possible array and the b vector inside the solve function.\n\nThus, the complete missing code inside the loop is:\n\nBut given the code provided's structure, the code must read the elements into a vector, process the transitions, and manage the possible array.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the loop for i=1 to n is:\n\nint val;\ncin >> val;\nint j = i - val - 1;\nif (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\nif (possible[i]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\nif (dp[i]) {\n    int next_i = i + val;\n    if (next_i <= n) {\n        possible[next_i] = true;\n    }\n}\n\nBut this assumes that the possible array is declared and managed for each test case.\n\nBut the code provided does not declare the possible array. So the code must declare it inside the solve function.\n\nBut the code's existing variables are global, but possible is per-test-case.\n\nThus, the code must declare possible as a local vector in the solve function.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the solve function would include declaring possible and reading the elements into a vector.\n\nBut the code provided's loop is for i=1 to n, and the code must read the elements in this loop.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nvector<int> b(n+1);\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    cin >> b[i];\n    // process cases.\n}\n\nBut this requires two separate loops: one to read the elements and another to process them.\n\nBut the code's existing loop is only one. So the code must read and process in the same loop.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nint val;\ncin >> val;\n// case 1:\nint j = i - val - 1;\nif (j >=0 && dp[j]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n// case 2: check possible[i]\nif (possible[i]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n// update possible for future i's\nif (dp[i]) {\n    int next_i = i + val;\n    if (next_i <= n) {\n        possible[next_i] = true;\n    }\n}\n\nBut the possible array must be declared inside the solve function as a vector of size n+2.\n\nThus, the code inside the solve function would look like:\n\nvoid solve() {\n    cin >> n;\n\n    dp[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        dp[i] = 0;\n    }\n\n    vector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        int val;\n        cin >> val;\n\n        int j = i - val - 1;\n        if (j >= 0 && dp[j]) {\n            dp[i] = 1;\n        }\n\n        if (possible[i]) {\n            dp[i] = 1;\n        }\n\n        if (dp[i]) {\n            int next_i = i + val;\n            if (next_i <= n) {\n                possible[next_i] = true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (dp[n] == 1) {\n        cout << \"YES\\n\";\n    } else {\n        cout << \"NO\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\nBut this is the correct approach.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the loop for i=1 to n is:\n\nint val;\ncin >> val;\n\nint j = i - val - 1;\nif (j >= 0 && dp[j]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n\nif (possible[i]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n\nif (dp[i]) {\n    int next_i = i + val;\n    if (next_i <= n) {\n        possible[next_i] = true;\n    }\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, the possible array is not declared. So the code must declare it as a local vector in the solve function.\n\nThus, the code must include:\n\nvector<bool> possible(n+2, false);\n\nInside the solve function, after reading n and initializing the dp array.\n\nPutting it all together, the code's solve function would look like this:\n\nvoid solve() {\n    cin >> n;\n\n    dp[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        dp[i] = 0;\n    }\n\n    vector<bool> possible(n + 2, false);\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        int val;\n        cin >> val;\n\n        // Case 1: length is after the segment\n        int j = i - val - 1;\n        if (j >= 0 && dp[j]) {\n            dp[i] = 1;\n        }\n\n        // Case 2: length is before the segment\n        if (possible[i]) {\n            dp[i] = 1;\n        }\n\n        // Update possible for future positions\n        if (dp[i]) {\n            int next_i = i + val;\n            if (next_i <= n) {\n                possible[next_i] = true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (dp[n] == 1) {\n        cout << \"YES\\n\";\n    } else {\n        cout << \"NO\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\nThus, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nint val;\ncin >> val;\n\nint j = i - val - 1;\nif (j >= 0 && dp[j]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n\nif (possible[i]) {\n    dp[i] = 1;\n}\n\nif (dp[i]) {\n    int next_i = i + val;\n    if (next_i <= n) {\n        possible[next_i] = true;\n    }\n}\n\nBut in the code's existing structure, the possible array is declared inside the solve function, which is correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is the code inside the loop, which reads the element, processes the two cases, and updates the possible array."
