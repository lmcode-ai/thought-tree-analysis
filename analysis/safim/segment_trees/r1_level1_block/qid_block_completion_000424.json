Another observation: the process can be thought of as building up the array from left to right, with some conditions. For example, after processing each element, you have to have enough \"credit\" to handle the next elements. Let's see. Let's model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right. For each position i, the sum of the previous elements up to i-1 must allow us to reach i. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's think about the total \"steps\" that can be used to reach each position. Wait, perhaps the key idea is that the sum of the first i elements must be non-negative, except for the last element. Because when you move right, you add 1 to the current element. So, for each element a[i], the total steps taken to reach and leave it must satisfy certain conditions. Alternatively, the array must satisfy that:\n\n- The first element a[0] must be non-negative.

Looking at the code:\n\nThe initial code is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input()) a = list(map(int,input().split()))\n    tot = a[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if tot < 0:\n            break\n        elif tot == 0:\n            if a[i] ! = 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            tot += a[i]\n    else:\n        if tot == 0:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            continue\n\n    print(\"No\") So the code is processing each element in the array.

Thus, the missing code is inserting a break statement. So the code for the TODO part is:\n\n                break\n\nSo the complete code for the elif block is:\n\n        elif tot == 0: if a[i] ! = 0:\n                break\n\nBut wait, in the code, after breaking, the code will proceed to the print(\"No\") line. But in the code's structure, the for loop has an else clause which runs only if the loop didn't break. So inserting a break here would trigger the code to exit the loop, and then print \"No\". So yes, inserting 'break' is correct. So the missing code is to break the loop when a[i] is non-zero and tot is zero. Thus, the code should be:\n\n            elif tot == 0:\n                if a[i] ! = 0:\n                    break\n\nBut what about when the i is the last element? For example, if the array is [1, -1, 0], the code processes i=1 (a[i] =-1, tot=1 \u2192 add to tot \u2192 0). Then i=2: tot is zero. a[2] is zero, so the loop continues. The loop ends, and the else clause checks if tot is zero (yes), so outputs yes. Another example: [1, -1, 1].",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether a given array can be obtained through a series of operations with certain constraints. The key points here are understanding the operations and the conditions that must be met for the array to be valid.\n\nSo, the operations are: when moving right, you add 1 to the current element and move. When moving left, you subtract 1 from the current element and move. But after all operations, the pointer must end up on the first element.\n\nLet me think about how the array is built. Let's consider the process step by step. Since each move to the next element (right) increases the current element by 1, and each move left (previous) decreases the current element by 1. But the order of these moves and the final position matter.\n\nWait, the problem says that after all operations, the pointer must be on the first element. So whatever operations we do, in the end, we must have the pointer back to the first element. That's a crucial condition.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sequence of moves. Each time we move right, we add 1 to the current element and move right. But when moving left, we subtract 1 from the current element and move left. But the path of the pointer must end up at the first element.\n\nSo, perhaps the process can be modeled as a series of steps where for each position i (starting from 0), the number of times you leave it to the right versus the number of times you come back from the right (i.e., leave to the left from i+1 and come back to i) will affect the final value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the cumulative effect. Let's think recursively. For each position i, the number of times we leave it to the right must be exactly one more than the number of times we come back from the right. Except for the last element, which can't be left to the right again. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy certain conditions based on the order of the steps. For example, the first element a_0 must be non-negative, because to move right from it, you have to increment it. But then, when you come back left, you decrement the previous element (which would be a_1 in this case). But after all operations, the pointer is on a_0 again.\n\nWait, perhaps the process can be viewed as a sequence of moves. Each time you go right, you add to the current element, and each time you go left, you subtract. But the pointer's path must end at the first element, so the total number of left moves from the first element (but the first element can't be left to the left, so that's impossible). So perhaps the movement is such that the pointer's path is a series of right and left moves that starts at 0, moves around, and ends at 0.\n\nLet me try to model the array's elements. Let's consider the sum of certain variables. For example, the i-th element's value is determined by the number of times the pointer left it to the right minus the number of times it came back to it from the left. Because each time you leave to the right, you add 1 (since moving right increases the element by 1). Then, when you come back from the right (i.e., moving left from i+1 to i), you subtract 1 from i+1 and move left, but the current i (when you arrive from the left) would have been increased by 1 when you left to the right. Wait, maybe that's not the right way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, each time you are on position j and move right, you add 1 to j and move to j+1. Each time you are on position j and move left, you subtract 1 from j and move to j-1. The initial array is all zeros, and the pointer is at position 0.\n\nSo, the final array is the result of all these increments and decrements. But the pointer must end at position 0.\n\nLet's think about the cumulative effect. For the first element a_0, the number of times you moved right from it (each contributes +1) minus the number of times you moved left into it (each time you came back from position 1 to 0, you subtracted 1 from position 1, but that doesn't affect a_0. Wait, no. Moving left from position j to j-1: you subtract 1 from j, and move to j-1. So the elements are modified when you move left or right.\n\nSo, the first element a_0 is equal to the number of times you moved right from position 0 minus the number of times you moved left from position 0 (but you can't move left from position 0, so the second term is zero). Wait, no. Because you can't move left from position 0. So a_0 is exactly the number of times you moved right from it. Because each time you leave to the right, you add 1. So a_0 must be non-negative. Because you can't have any left moves from position 0.\n\nWait, that's a key point. The first element a_0 can't have any left moves from it. So any time you are on position 0, you can only move right. So each time you move right from 0, you add 1 to a[0]. Then, when you are on position 1, you can move left or right. When moving left from 1, you subtract 1 from a[1], then move to 0. But then, when you are back at 0, you can again move right, adding 1 to a[0].\n\nSo the value of a[0] is the total number of times you moved right from position 0. Because each such move adds 1. But once you move to the right, you can come back to 0 by moving left from 1, but that doesn't affect a[0]. So a[0] must be >=0.\n\nSimilarly, for a[1], each time you move right from 1, you add 1. Each time you move left from 1, you subtract 1. But when you move left from 1, you end up at 0, which allows you to move right again. So a[1] = (number of right moves from 1) - (number of left moves from 1). But the movement is such that the pointer must end at 0. So the sequence of moves must form a valid path that ends at 0.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or certain conditions that the array must satisfy.\n\nLet me look at the sample input. In the second test case, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The sample shows that it's possible, and the pointer ends on the first element. So how does that happen?\n\nThe process given in the note:\n\nStart at 0 (underline), then after some moves, the array becomes [2, -1, -1, 0], and the pointer is at position 0.\n\nHmm. Let's see. The first element is 2, which makes sense because you have to move right from 0 three times. Wait, no, in the sample, the first step is moving right once, then moving back. Let's see:\n\nThe steps in the note:\n\nInitial state: [0,0,0,0], pointer on 0.\n\nStep 1: move right, add 1 to a[0], now a[0] is 1. Pointer at 1.\n\nStep 2: move left from 1, subtract 1 from a[1], which becomes -1. Pointer at 0.\n\nStep 3: move right again from 0, adding 1 (a[0] becomes 2). Pointer at 1.\n\nStep 4: move right from 1, adding 1 (a[1] becomes 0). Pointer at 2.\n\nStep 5: move left from 2, subtract 1 (a[2] becomes -1). Pointer at 1.\n\nStep 6: move left from 1, subtract 1 (a[1] becomes -1). Pointer at 0.\n\nSo the final array is [2, -1, -1, 0], and the pointer is at 0. So the steps involve moving back and forth, but the final pointer is at 0.\n\nSo, the elements can be negative (like a[1] and a[2] in the sample), but there's a certain way they must be structured.\n\nAnother observation: the process can be thought of as building up the array from left to right, with some conditions. For example, after processing each element, you have to have enough \"credit\" to handle the next elements. Let's see.\n\nLet's model the problem as follows:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right. For each position i, the sum of the previous elements up to i-1 must allow us to reach i. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's think about the total \"steps\" that can be used to reach each position.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that the sum of the first i elements must be non-negative, except for the last element. Because when you move right, you add 1 to the current element. So, for each element a[i], the total steps taken to reach and leave it must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the array must satisfy that:\n\n- The first element a[0] must be non-negative. Because each time you leave it to the right, you add 1. Since you can't move left from 0, a[0] is exactly the number of times you moved right from it, which can't be negative.\n\n- For each subsequent element a[i] (i > 0), the sum of a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i] must be <= 0. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the sample where a is [2, -1, -1, 0], the sum of the array is 0. That's probably not a coincidence. Because each time you move right, you add 1, and each time you move left, you subtract 1. So the total number of moves to the right and left must balance out such that the pointer ends up at 0.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of all elements in the array must be zero. Let's check the sample. The second sample's array sum is 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0. The first test case's array isn't given, but the note says that the pointer won't be on the first element, which would make it invalid according to the problem's condition. So perhaps the sum of all elements must be zero.\n\nBut why? Because each right move adds 1, and each left move subtracts 1, but after all moves, the pointer is back to 0. So the total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves plus 1? Wait, no. Because every time you move right, you add 1 to the current element, but moving left subtracts 1 from the next element. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, each right move (from i to i+1) increases a[i] by 1. Each left move (from i to i-1) decreases a[i] by 1. The total number of right and left moves affects the sum of the array. For example, every right move contributes +1 to the array. Every left move contributes -1. So the sum of the array is equal to (number of right moves) - (number of left moves).\n\nBut the pointer starts at 0 and ends at 0. So the total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. Because each right move moves you +1, left move moves you -1. So the total displacement is (number of rights) - (number of lefts). Since you end up at 0, the displacement is zero. So (number of rights) - (number of lefts) = 0. Therefore, sum of the array is (rights - lefts) = 0. Because sum is rights - lefts. Wait, no. Because sum of the array is equal to the sum of all the increments and decrements caused by the moves. Each right move on position i adds 1 to a[i]. Each left move on position j subtracts 1 from a[j]. So sum of array = (sum of right moves on all positions) - (sum of left moves on all positions).\n\nBut the total number of rights (sum over all positions of right moves from that position) is equal to the total number of left moves (sum over all positions of left moves from that position) plus 1? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the array is equal to (total rights) - (total lefts). But for the pointer to end at 0, the number of rights and lefts must be equal, so sum is zero.\n\nYes! Because each right move increases the pointer by 1, and each left move decreases it by 1. So to return to 0, the number of rights must equal the number of lefts. Therefore, sum of the array is rights - lefts = (rights - lefts) = (rights + lefts) - 2 lefts. But if rights = lefts, then sum = 0.\n\nSo the sum of all elements in the array must be zero. That's a necessary condition. But is it sufficient?\n\nWait, the first sample in the problem's note says that the array could be obtained but the pointer wasn't on the first element. So in that case, the sum would be zero? But perhaps that array was invalid because the pointer wasn't on the first element, even though the sum was zero. So sum zero is a necessary but not sufficient condition.\n\nSo the first check is to see if the sum of all elements is zero. If not, output \"No\".\n\nBut in the sample given in the note where the answer is \"Yes\", the sum is zero. So that's a necessary condition.\n\nBut what about other cases? For example, if the array is [3, -3], sum is zero. Let's see if it's possible.\n\nStart at 0. Move right three times (a[0] becomes 3, pointer at 1). Then move left three times (each time, subtract 1 from a[1], which becomes -3, pointer back to 0). So yes. So this array is possible. So sum zero is necessary.\n\nSo the first condition is that the sum of the array must be zero. Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nBut then, there's another condition. For example, the array [1, -1, 0]. Sum is zero. But let's see:\n\nWe start at 0. Move right once (a[0] is 1, pointer at 1). Then move left once (a[1] becomes -1, pointer at 0). Now, the pointer is at 0. So the array is [1, -1, 0]. So this is possible.\n\nBut what about [0, 0, 0]. Sum is zero. But the pointer is at 0. Since we did no operations, the array is possible.\n\nAnother example: [2, -1, -1]. Sum is zero. Let's see:\n\nStart at 0. Move right twice (a[0] becomes 2, pointer at 2). Then move left once (a[2] becomes -1, pointer at 1). Then move left once (a[1] becomes -1, pointer at 0). Sum is 2-1-1=0. So possible.\n\nBut what about [1, 0, -1]. Sum is zero. Let's see:\n\nPossible?\n\nWe need to have pointer at 0 after operations. Let's try:\n\nStart at 0. Move right (a[0] 1, pointer at 1). Then move right again (a[1] 1, pointer at 2). Then move left (a[2] -1, pointer at 1). Then move left (a[1] 0, pointer at 0). The array is [1,0,-1]. So yes. So sum zero is possible.\n\nSo sum zero is necessary.\n\nBut what about the first element? It must be non-negative. Because each time you move right from 0, you add 1. Since you can't move left from 0, the first element must be equal to the number of times you moved right from 0, which can't be negative. So a[0] must be >=0.\n\nSo another condition is a[0] >=0.\n\nBut wait, in the code provided, the first line after input is:\n\ntot = a[0]\n\nSo perhaps the code is checking the conditions step by step.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nIf tot (which starts as a[0]) becomes negative, break. Because that's impossible.\n\nElse, if tot is zero, then a[i] must be zero? Because once the cumulative sum up to i is zero, there's no way to proceed further. Because if the pointer is at position i-1 and the cumulative sum is zero, then you can't move right (since the sum is zero, which represents the total steps available?), so any non-zero a[i] would require moving, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is accumulating the sum of a[0], a[1], etc., but with some conditions.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe initial code is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int,input().split()))\n    tot = a[0]\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if tot < 0:\n            break\n        elif tot == 0:\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            tot += a[i]\n    else:\n        if tot == 0:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            continue\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nSo the code is processing each element in the array. Let's see:\n\n- The first thing is tot is set to a[0]. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, check if tot is <0. If so, break and print No.\n\nSo the first check is a[0] must be >=0. Because if a[0] is negative, the code immediately breaks and prints No.\n\nThen, for each next element, if tot (which starts as a[0] and is being added to) is zero, then the code checks if a[i] is not zero, and in that case, does something. But the code as provided has a TODO here.\n\nThe else clause is part of the for loop, meaning that if the loop completes without breaking, then check if tot is zero. If so, print Yes.\n\nSo the code is building a tot variable as follows:\n\nInitially, tot is a[0]. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n- If tot < 0, break (invalid).\n\n- Else if tot == 0:\n\n   - if a[i] != 0: then we need to do something (probably break and invalidate the array).\n\n- Else (tot > 0):\n\n   - add a[i] to tot.\n\nAt the end, if the loop completes (no breaks) and tot is zero, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nSo this code is checking two main conditions:\n\n1. The first element a[0] must be non-negative.\n\n2. For the subsequent elements, once the cumulative sum (tot) becomes zero, all remaining elements must be zero.\n\nBecause once tot is zero, you can't proceed further. Because moving right would require adding to the current element (but the code's logic here is a bit unclear). Wait, let's think.\n\nThe code is processing the array in a way that after each step, tot is modified. The logic is:\n\n- Start with tot = a[0]. If a[0] is negative, it's impossible.\n\nThen, for each i >=1:\n\n- If the current tot is zero, then any a[i] != 0 makes it impossible. Because once you have a cumulative tot (from a[0] to a[i-1]) of zero, you can't proceed further. Because moving right would require that the current tot (which is a[0] + ... + a[i-1]?) allows for the next step.\n\nWait, perhaps the tot variable represents the total \"available\" steps. For example, when you are at position i-1, the number of times you can move right from i-1 to i is determined by some variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to model the total number of times you can move right from the previous positions, and how that affects the current element.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as follows: to reach element i, you must have passed through i-1. Each time you move right from i-1, you add 1 to a[i-1], and move to i. Then, when you move left from i, you subtract 1 from a[i], and return to i-1.\n\nBut the key is that the way the array is built must allow the pointer to end at 0.\n\nHmm. Maybe the code is trying to model the cumulative sum of the first i elements. For example, for the array to be valid, after processing the first i elements, the cumulative sum (from a[0] to a[i]) must be non-negative, except for the last element.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is:\n\n- The cumulative sum up to each position must be >=0, except that after the last position, the sum must be zero.\n\nLet me think. For example:\n\nIn the sample [2,-1,-1,0], the cumulative sums are:\n\na[0] = 2 (sum 2)\n\na[0] + a[1] = 2-1 =1 (sum 1)\n\na[0]+a[1]+a[2] = 2-1-1=0 (sum 0)\n\na[0]+...+a[3] = 0.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\n- The sum of a[0] must be >=0.\n\n- For each i >=1, the cumulative sum up to i must be >=0, except that after processing all elements, the cumulative sum must be zero.\n\nBut how is the code doing this?\n\nIn the code, tot starts as a[0]. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, if tot is >=0, then:\n\n- if tot is zero, then a[i] must be zero. Because once the cumulative sum (tot) is zero, there's no way to proceed further. Because you can't move to the next element if you have zero steps available. So any non-zero a[i] in this case would be impossible.\n\n- else, add a[i] to tot. So the code is accumulating the sum of a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i], but maybe in a different way.\n\nWait, no. The code starts with tot = a[0]. Then, for each i >=1, in the else block (when tot is not zero and not negative), it adds a[i] to tot. So tot becomes a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i].\n\nWait, but in the code's loop:\n\nFor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n- if tot <0: break.\n\n- elif tot ==0:\n\n   if a[i] !=0: then do something (like break or set a flag).\n\n   else: continue (since if a[i] is zero, then proceed).\n\n- else: tot += a[i]\n\nSo, after processing i=1, tot is a[0] + a[1]. Then, for i=2, the same, etc.\n\nSo the code is checking that the cumulative sum of a[0] to a[i] must be >=0 at each step. Because if at any step, tot (sum) becomes negative, it's invalid.\n\nAdditionally, once the cumulative sum becomes zero, all subsequent elements must be zero. Because if the cumulative sum is zero and you have a non-zero element, then adding it to the sum would make it non-zero again. But according to the code, once tot is zero, any a[i] that's not zero would cause a problem.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nOnce tot is zero (cumulative sum up to i-1 is zero), then for any a[i] !=0, the code must break and mark as invalid. Because when the cumulative sum up to i-1 is zero, you can't move to i, because moving to i would require that you have a positive sum (since you have to leave the current position to the right, which requires that the cumulative sum is positive? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is modeling the process where:\n\nThe pointer starts at 0, and to move right from position k, you must have enough \"steps\" (which is represented by the cumulative sum tot).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's take another example. Suppose the array is [3, -3]. The sum is zero. According to the code:\n\ntot starts at 3 (a[0] =3, which is >=0).\n\nThen i=1:\n\ntot is 3 (>=0 and not zero), so add a[1] (-3) to tot. Now tot is 0.\n\nThe loop ends. The for loop's else clause is executed (since there was no break), and check if tot is zero. Yes. So print \"Yes\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, -1, 0].\n\nProcessing:\n\na[0] =1 (tot=1)\n\ni=1: tot is 1. Add a[1] (-1) to tot. tot=0.\n\ni=2: tot is zero. Check if a[2] !=0. Since it's zero, nothing happens. Loop continues.\n\nAfter loop, check if tot is zero (yes). So output \"Yes\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [2, -1, -1, 0]. Sum is zero.\n\nProcessing:\n\na[0] =2 \u2192 tot=2.\n\ni=1: add -1 \u2192 tot=1.\n\ni=2: add -1 \u2192 tot=0.\n\ni=3: tot is zero. Check a[3] is zero. So proceed.\n\nLoop ends. tot is 0. So output yes.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 0, -1]. Sum is zero.\n\nProcessing:\n\na[0] =1. i=1: add 0 \u2192 tot=1.\n\ni=2: add -1 \u2192 tot=0. Loop ends. Check tot is zero \u2192 yes.\n\nSo code outputs yes.\n\nBut what about a case where after the cumulative sum becomes zero, there are non-zero elements.\n\nFor example: [2, -2, 1]. Sum is 1. So code would output no because sum is not zero. But suppose sum is zero: [1, -1, 1, -1]. Sum is zero.\n\nProcessing:\n\na[0] =1 \u2192 tot=1.\n\ni=1: add -1 \u2192 tot=0.\n\ni=2: tot is zero. Check a[2] is 1. Since a[i] !=0, the code must break. So loop breaks. Then, output no.\n\nWhich is correct, because the array [1,-1,1,-1] can't be formed. Because once the cumulative sum up to i=1 is zero (1-1=0), then a[2] must be zero. But here it's 1, which is invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly breaks and outputs no.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\n- Check that the sum of all elements is zero (because the code's loop adds all a[i], except for the first, and in the end checks if tot is zero. But the sum is a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1] = tot. So the code's final check is whether the sum is zero. But in the code, the sum is being accumulated as a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i] for each step.\n\nWait, the code starts with tot = a[0]. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, if tot is not zero and not negative, it adds a[i] to tot. But if tot is zero, then the code checks if a[i] is non-zero and breaks.\n\nWait, but the code's loop is from 1 to n-1. So for each element after a[0], it processes them in order. For each i:\n\n- If tot (sum so far) is negative \u2192 break.\n\n- Else if tot is zero \u2192 if a[i] is not zero, then break (because once sum is zero, you can't have any more non-zero elements).\n\n- Else \u2192 add a[i] to tot.\n\nAt the end, after processing all elements, check if the total sum is zero.\n\nSo the code is ensuring two things:\n\n1. The cumulative sum at each step (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i]) must be non-negative. Because if at any point it becomes negative, the code breaks and outputs no.\n\n2. Once the cumulative sum becomes zero, all remaining elements must be zero. Because otherwise, adding them would make the sum non-zero again.\n\nMoreover, after processing all elements, the total sum must be zero.\n\nBut wait, the code's tot variable is the sum of a[0] plus a[1] plus a[2], etc., but only up to the point where the cumulative sum is positive. Once the sum becomes zero, any subsequent elements must be zero. Because if the sum is zero, you can't move further, so any non-zero element would require movement which is impossible.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\n- The sum of the array must be zero.\n\n- The first element must be >=0.\n\n- The cumulative sum up to any element i must be >=0.\n\n- Once the cumulative sum reaches zero, all remaining elements must be zero.\n\nThese conditions are necessary and sufficient.\n\nSo the code's structure is:\n\nInitialize tot as a[0]. If a[0] is negative, output no.\n\nThen, for each element from a[1] to a[n-1]:\n\n   if current tot is negative: break.\n\n   if tot is zero: check if a[i] is zero. If not, break.\n\n   else: add a[i] to tot.\n\nAfter processing all elements, if tot is zero, output yes.\n\nSo the missing code is handling the case where, when tot is zero, a[i] must be zero. Otherwise, it's invalid. So in the code, when tot is zero and a[i] is not zero, we need to break and output no.\n\nSo the missing code is to break the loop and mark it as invalid.\n\nIn the code provided, there's a TODO section:\n\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo in this case, when tot is zero and a[i] is not zero, the code should break out of the loop and print \"No\".\n\nThus, the code to insert is:\n\n                break\n\nBut wait, in the code structure, the break would exit the for loop. Then, the else clause (which is executed only if the loop completes without breaking) would not be triggered. Then, the code proceeds to print \"No\".\n\nSo, in this case, when we encounter a non-zero a[i] when tot is zero, we break, which skips the else clause, and proceeds to print \"No\".\n\nThus, the missing code is inserting a break statement.\n\nSo the code for the TODO part is:\n\n                break\n\nSo the complete code for the elif block is:\n\n        elif tot == 0:\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                break\n\nBut wait, in the code, after breaking, the code will proceed to the print(\"No\") line.\n\nBut in the code's structure, the for loop has an else clause which runs only if the loop didn't break. So inserting a break here would trigger the code to exit the loop, and then print \"No\".\n\nSo yes, inserting 'break' is correct.\n\nSo the missing code is to break the loop when a[i] is non-zero and tot is zero.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\n            elif tot == 0:\n                if a[i] != 0:\n                    break\n\nBut what about when the i is the last element? For example, if the array is [1, -1, 0], the code processes i=1 (a[i] =-1, tot=1 \u2192 add to tot \u2192 0). Then i=2: tot is zero. a[2] is zero, so the loop continues. The loop ends, and the else clause checks if tot is zero (yes), so outputs yes.\n\nAnother example: [1, -1, 1]. Sum is 1 \u2192 code would break in the final check.\n\nBut in the code, the code adds a[i] to tot only when tot is not zero. So for the array [1, -1, 0], after adding a[1], tot is zero. Then for a[2], since tot is zero, check if a[2] is non-zero. If it is zero, proceed. The loop completes. Then check if tot is zero (yes).\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the missing line is to break when a[i] is not zero and tot is zero.\n\nSo the code to fill in is:\n\n                break\n\nThus, the correct code for the missing part is inserting a break statement when a[i] is not zero and tot is zero."
