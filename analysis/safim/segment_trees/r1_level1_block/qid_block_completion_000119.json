So the answer is \"NO\". Otherwise, it's possible to move all robots left j times and up i times (if the candidate is in row i). Wait, but the code doesn't check the rows. How?\n\nWait, suppose the candidate is in row i. To reach row 0, you need to move up i times. All robots in rows >= i can move up i times. But if there's a robot in a row < i, then moving up i times would take it to a row less than 0, which is invalid. But since the candidate is in the topmost row (i), there are no robots in rows < i. So the code's processing order (rows from top to bottom) ensures that the first robot is in the topmost row, and any other robots are in rows >= that row. So when moving up i times (i is the candidate's row), robots in rows >=i will have rows >=0 after moving up i times. So the code's logic is correct. Because all robots are in rows >= the candidate's row. So when you move up i times (i being the candidate's row), their rows decrease by i, but since their original rows are >= i, their new rows are >=0. So no explosions.",

So the code's logic ensures that the candidate is in the first row (from top) with a robot. So any robots in rows above (earlier rows) are impossible. Because those rows were processed first and would have set top_robot_col already. So, the missing code is simply assigning j to top_robot_col. Thus, the missing line is:\n\ntop_robot_col = j;\n\nThat's it. That's the code that's missing. Because when the first robot is found (top_robot_col is -1), the code sets top_robot_col to that robot's column. Then, for any subsequent robots, if their column is less than top_robot_col, ans is set to false. Testing this logic against the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: Input: n=1, m=2. Row is ER. The first robot is in column 1. top_robot_col is set to 1. No other rows. So ans is true. Output is YES. Sample 2: Input: n=2, m=2. Rows are RE and ER. The first row's first robot is column 0. Then, the second row's robot is at column 1. Which is >= 0. So ans is true? But according to the note, the answer is NO. Wait, this contradicts the code's logic. Wait, sample 2's description says that any command would cause at least one robot to explode. Let me see:\n\nSample 2's input is:\n\nn=2, m=2. Row 0: R E\n\nRow 1: E R\n\nSo the robots are at (0,0) and (1,1). The code's logic would first process row 0. The first 'R' is at j=0. top_robot_col is set to 0. Then, in row 1, the 'R' is at j=1.",

So the code would output NO. Which is correct. But in the previous example I mentioned (sample 2 in the note), where the robots are (0,0) and (1,1), the code's logic would output YES. But according to the note, such a case would be handled correctly. For example, if a robot is already in (0,0), then the answer is YES, as in sample 4's note.

Wait, let's think of the example given. For the first test case in the note, moving left once. Suppose the robot is in (0,1). So after moving left, it's in (0,0).

So that's why the code's approach is checking for the leftmost robot in each row. The code seems to track top_robot_col. For each row, when the first robot is found (since top_robot_col is -1 for the first row), it records something. Then, for subsequent rows, any robot in a column less than top_robot_col would make ans false. Wait, maybe the code is iterating rows from top to bottom (since n is being decremented in the while loop). For the first row (top row), when a robot is found, we set top_robot_col to that column. Then, in the next row (the row below), if any robot is in a column left of top_robot_col, that's a problem.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether there's a way to move robots so that at least one reaches the upper-left corner without any robots exploding. The code provided seems to have some missing parts, and I need to fill them in.\n\nThe code structure is in the Solve function. They're reading n and m, then looping through each row. For each cell in the row, if it's an 'R', they check some conditions. The variable top_robot_col is initialized to -1. Then, if it's the first robot encountered (since top_robot_col is -1), there's a TODO. Otherwise, they check if j (the current column) is less than top_robot_col, and if so, set ans to false.\n\nHmm. So the idea here is probably to track the leftmost robot in each row. Because to reach the upper left corner (0,0), the robots must be able to move up and left enough times. But for this, perhaps the first robot in each row (from top to bottom) must be in a position that allows moving up, and the leftmost positions in their respective rows form a non-decreasing sequence when looking from top to bottom. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nThe key observation here is that for a robot to reach (0,0), all the robots in the rows above it (if any) must be positioned such that they can move left enough. Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nEach command moves all robots at once. So, the sequence of moves must be such that after moving, all robots are still on the grid. The goal is for at least one robot to reach (0,0), and during the process, no robot steps outside the grid.\n\nSo, the approach here is to find a robot that can reach (0,0) through some sequence of moves, and during each move, all other robots (if any) don't go out of bounds.\n\nAlternatively, the approach taken in the code is to check for each robot whether it's possible for that robot to reach (0,0) without any other robot being forced to exit the grid during the movement steps. But how?\n\nWait, the code's logic is processing each row, and for the first robot in each row (since top_robot_col is initially -1), they set something. Then, in subsequent rows, if a robot is in a column less than the top_robot_col, then ans is false.\n\nWait, maybe the code's idea is to track the leftmost robot in each row. Then, for each row, the leftmost robot must be in a column that is >= the leftmost robot of the previous row. Because when you move left, the robots in the upper rows (which are processed first) must have their leftmost robot at a column that allows moving left enough steps so that when you move left, all robots can move left, but the leftmost ones in upper rows must not be to the right of the leftmost in lower rows. Otherwise, when you move left multiple times, the lower row's robot might have to move left beyond the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the earliest row (from top to bottom) where a robot exists, and then check if all other robots in that row and subsequent rows are in positions that allow moving up and left enough steps, but ensuring that other robots don't go out of bounds.\n\nWait, let's think of the example given. For the first test case in the note, moving left once. Suppose the robot is in (0,1). So after moving left, it's in (0,0). Other robots (if any) must not be in positions where moving left would take them out. For example, if another robot is in (1,0), moving left would take it to column -1, which is invalid. So that's why the code's approach is checking for the leftmost robot in each row.\n\nThe code seems to track top_robot_col. For each row, when the first robot is found (since top_robot_col is -1 for the first row), it records something. Then, for subsequent rows, any robot in a column less than top_robot_col would make ans false.\n\nWait, maybe the code is iterating rows from top to bottom (since n is being decremented in the while loop). For the first row (top row), when a robot is found, we set top_robot_col to that column. Then, in the next row (the row below), if any robot is in a column left of top_robot_col, that's a problem. Because when you move left, the robots in the row below would have to move left as well, but if they are already in a column that's to the left of the first robot's column, then moving left could cause them to go out of the grid before the first robot reaches the upper left corner.\n\nWait, maybe the idea is that the earliest robot (the first one encountered in the topmost row that has any robots) must be the leftmost possible. Then, any robots in lower rows must be to the right of that column. Because otherwise, when you start moving left, the lower robots might go out of bounds before the top robot reaches (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is checking if all robots are in positions such that there's a path for one of them to reach (0,0) without any other robot moving out. For that, perhaps the leftmost robot in the topmost possible row is the candidate. Let's see.\n\nIn the code, the first robot encountered (since the code is processing rows from top to bottom) would be in the topmost row. Then, in that row, the code records the column of the first robot (since top_robot_col is initially -1). Then, for any subsequent rows (lower rows), if any robot is in a column to the left of the top_robot_col, then ans is false. Because when moving left, the lower robots would have to move left, and if their column is already left of the top_robot_col, then moving left enough times would cause them to go out of the grid before the top robot reaches (0,0).\n\nWait, but the code allows for multiple rows. For example, in the fifth test case mentioned in the note, the solution required moving up, left, up. So maybe the code's approach is not sufficient. Or perhaps the code's approach is correct, and the fifth test case is handled in a way that the leftmost robot in the top row is considered.\n\nWait, let's think about the fifth test case. The problem says that the sequence is up, left, up. So maybe the robot starts in a lower row, moves up, then left, then up again. How would the code handle that?\n\nHmm. The code's logic seems to process rows from top to bottom. So the first row (top row) is checked first. If there's a robot there, then any robot in lower rows must not be in a column to the left of the top's robot's column. Otherwise, moving left would cause those lower robots to go out.\n\nBut in the fifth test case, perhaps the robot is in a lower row. So the code's logic would allow that?\n\nWait, maybe the code's approach is to find the leftmost robot in the topmost possible row. Then, check if all other robots are in columns >= that leftmost column. Because that way, when you move left, all robots can move left, and the leftmost robot in the top row will reach (0,0) first. Because the other robots are to the right, so moving left enough times would bring the top robot to (0,0) while others are still on the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is that the first robot encountered (which is the first row's leftmost robot) is the candidate. Then, any robot in a lower row must be in a column >= that. Because when you move left, the candidate robot moves left, and the others also move left. But for the lower robots, if they are in a column >= the candidate's column, then after moving left the same number of steps as the candidate, their columns would be >=0 (since the candidate's initial column minus steps is >=0). So the other robots would not go out.\n\nFor example, suppose the candidate robot is at (row i, col j). To reach (0,0), we need to move left j steps and up i steps. But during the left moves, all robots must stay in the grid. So for any other robot at (row k, col l), after moving left j steps, l - j must be >=0. So l >= j. So all other robots must be in columns >= j. Then, when moving left j times, they don't go out.\n\nSimilarly, when moving up i steps, their row must be >= i, so after moving up i steps, their row is >=0. So the code's current logic is not checking the rows. Wait, but in the code, it's only checking the columns. So perhaps the code is incomplete.\n\nWait, the code processes the rows in order (from top to bottom), and for each row, checks the columns. The code's ans starts as true. For the first robot encountered (topmost row's first robot), we set top_robot_col to that column. Then, for any other row, if any robot is in a column j < top_robot_col, ans becomes false.\n\nBut this misses checking the rows. For example, a robot in a row lower than the candidate's row would have to be in a row >= i (the candidate's row). But perhaps the code is missing that part.\n\nWait, the code is written in such a way that the rows are processed from top to bottom. So, the first robot encountered is in the topmost possible row. Then, for each subsequent row (lower rows), if any robot is in a column to the left of the top_robot_col, then it's impossible. Because moving left enough steps would cause that lower robot to move left beyond the grid before the candidate robot reaches column 0.\n\nWait, but the code's approach might not account for moving up. For example, maybe the candidate robot is in row 2, column 3. There's a robot in row 0, column 4. Then, the code would set top_robot_col to 4. Then, the robot in row 2, column 3 would have j=3 < top_robot_col=4, so ans becomes false. But that's incorrect because the candidate is in row 2. But the code processes rows from top to bottom, so row 0 is processed first, then row 1, etc. Wait, wait, in the code's code: the while (n--) loop. Suppose n is 3 rows. The loop would run 3 times, processing the first row (row 0), then row 1, then row 2. So the code's logic is that the first robot found in the first row (row 0) would be the candidate, setting top_robot_col. Then, any row in lower rows (row 1, 2, etc.) must not have a robot in a column left of top_robot_col.\n\nBut in reality, maybe the candidate is in a lower row. For example, in the fifth test case, which requires moving up, left, up. So the robot is in row 2, column 2. To reach (0,0), you need to move up once, then left twice (but perhaps the steps are in different orders). But according to the code's logic, the code would first check row 0. If there are no robots there, then top_robot_col remains -1. Then, row 1 is processed. If there are robots there, then top_robot_col is set to their column. Then, any lower rows (like row 2) must have robots in columns >= that. But in the fifth test case, if the candidate is in row 2, then in row 0 and 1, there might be no robots. So the code would process row 0, no robots. Then row 1: if there are no robots, then top_robot_col remains -1. Then, row 2: when a robot is found, since top_robot_col is -1, the code's TODO is to set top_robot_col to j. Then, any subsequent rows (if any) must have robots in columns >= j. So perhaps the code's logic is that the candidate is the leftmost robot in the first non-empty row (from top to bottom). Then, all robots in lower rows must have columns >= that column. But how does this account for moving up?\n\nAh, perhaps the code's logic is that the candidate must be in the topmost row that has a robot. Then, all robots in lower rows must be to the right (or same column) as the candidate's column. Because when moving left, the candidate can reach (0,0), and the lower robots can move left but since their columns are >= the candidate's column, they won't go out of bounds. Also, moving up steps: the candidate is in row i. To reach row 0, we need to move up i times. All robots in rows >= i can move up i times without going out of bounds. But any robots in rows < i (but since the candidate is the topmost row, there are none) would have to move up, but if they exist, that's a problem. But according to the code, the candidate is the first robot in the topmost row. So any robots in higher rows (above) would have been considered, but since the code processes rows from top to bottom, the first robot is in the first row (row 0) if any. So if a robot exists in row 0, then the candidate is in row 0. All other robots (rows 1, 2, etc.) must have column >= candidate's column. Then, moving left candidate's column steps, and up 0 steps (since candidate is in row 0) will bring the candidate to (0,0), and other robots will move left the same steps, but since their columns are >= candidate's column, they don't go out of bounds.\n\nBut what about robots in lower rows? For example, candidate is in row 0, column 2. There's a robot in row 1, column 2. When you move left twice, candidate moves to (0,0), and the other robot moves to (1,0). Which is valid. So no explosions.\n\nBut suppose there's a robot in row 1, column 1, which is less than the candidate's column of 2. Then, according to the code, ans would be false. So moving left once would bring the candidate to (0,1), and the other robot to (1,0). Then moving left again, the candidate would go to (0,0), but the other robot would try to go to (1,-1), which is invalid. So the code correctly marks this case as impossible.\n\nSo the code's approach seems to be:\n\n- Find the leftmost robot in the topmost row that contains any robots. Let's call its column j.\n\n- Then, for all other robots in lower rows, their columns must be >= j. Because when moving left j times, all robots can move left j steps (since j is the leftmost in the top row, their columns are >= j), so after moving left j times, their columns become >=0. Then, moving up i steps (if the candidate is in row i) would require that all robots are in rows >= i. But since the candidate is in the topmost row, there are no robots in rows above, so when moving up i steps, they just move up and remain in the grid.\n\nWait, but the code doesn't check the rows. For example, if the candidate is in row i, then any robot in a row less than i (higher up) would have to move up (i) steps. But the candidate is the first robot in the topmost row. So such robots cannot exist. Because the code processes rows from top to bottom. So if there's a robot in a higher row (row 0), the code would have processed that row first, and set top_robot_col to that robot's column. Then, any robot in lower rows (row 1, etc.) must have columns >= top_robot_col. So in that case, the candidate is in row 0. Then, moving up 0 times, left j steps. All other robots (in rows >=0, which they are) can move left j steps. Since their columns are >= j, their final columns are >=0.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nIf all robots are in columns >= j, where j is the column of the leftmost robot in the topmost row containing a robot, then it's possible. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo in the code, when processing the first robot in the topmost row, the code must set top_robot_col to that robot's column. Then, for any subsequent robots (in lower rows), check if their column is >= top_robot_col. If any is less, ans is false.\n\nWait, but in the code, the first robot in each row (since the code checks the first occurrence of 'R' in each row) may not be the leftmost in that row. Wait, in the code, when processing a row, they loop through each cell (j from 0 to m-1). So for the first row (top row), the first 'R' encountered (from left to right) is the leftmost robot in that row. So top_robot_col is set to that j. Then, for all other rows, the first 'R' in that row must be >= top_robot_col. Wait, no. The code's logic is: for each row, when processing each cell (from j=0 to m-1), if it's 'R' and top_robot_col is -1, then do something. Else, if j < top_robot_col, set ans to false.\n\nWait, the code is not considering all robots. Because for the first row (top_robot_col is -1), the first 'R' encountered in the row (leftmost) sets top_robot_col to j. Then, in the same row, any other 'R's (to the right) are not checked. Because once top_robot_col is set, for that row, other 'R's are not in the first occurrence. Then, for other rows, any 'R' in a column j < top_robot_col will set ans to false.\n\nWait, but what about other 'R's in the same row? For example, the top row has two robots: one at (0,1) and (0,3). The code would process the first robot (j=1), set top_robot_col to 1. The other robot (j=3) is in the same row, so the code's else clause (j < top_robot_col is 1?) No, 3 is not less than 1. So no problem. But in that case, when moving left, the leftmost robot (j=1) can move left once to (0,0). The robot at j=3 would move left once to (0,2). No explosions. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nBut what if in the same row, there's a robot to the left of the leftmost one? That's impossible, since we process the row from left to right. So the first 'R' in the row is the leftmost. So other 'R's in the same row are to the right. So the code's logic of checking j < top_robot_col is sufficient for other rows.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nFind the leftmost robot in the topmost row that contains any robot. Let this column be j.\n\nThen, for all other robots in any row (including lower rows), if any robot is in a column less than j, then it's impossible. So the answer is \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise, it's possible to move all robots left j times and up i times (if the candidate is in row i). Wait, but the code doesn't check the rows. How?\n\nWait, suppose the candidate is in row i. To reach row 0, you need to move up i times. All robots in rows >= i can move up i times. But if there's a robot in a row < i, then moving up i times would take it to a row less than 0, which is invalid. But since the candidate is in the topmost row (i), there are no robots in rows < i. So the code's processing order (rows from top to bottom) ensures that the first robot is in the topmost row, and any other robots are in rows >= that row. So when moving up i times (i is the candidate's row), robots in rows >=i will have rows >=0 after moving up i times.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct. Because all robots are in rows >= the candidate's row. So when you move up i times (i being the candidate's row), their rows decrease by i, but since their original rows are >= i, their new rows are >=0. So no explosions.\n\nThus, the code's missing part is when the first robot is encountered (top_robot_col is -1), we need to set top_robot_col to the column j of that robot, and also check that the robot's row is such that after moving up (i steps), it can reach row 0. But the code doesn't check that. Wait, but the code's logic is that the candidate robot's row is i. So moving up i steps. But the code doesn't check if the candidate's row is <= the number of rows.\n\nWait, but the candidate is in the topmost row. So i is 0 (since rows are processed from top to bottom). Because if the first row (row 0) has a robot, then the candidate's row is 0, so moving up 0 times. So the code's logic in this case is correct.\n\nWait, no. The code's loop is while (n--), which originally n is the number of rows. So, for example, if n is 3, then the first iteration is row 0, then row 1, then row 2. So the first robot encountered is in the topmost row (row 0). Unless the first rows are all 'E's, then the first robot would be in a lower row.\n\nWait, for example, if all rows except the last row are empty. Then, the code processes row 0 (no robots), row 1 (no robots), row 2 (has a robot). So top_robot_col is set to j in row 2. Then, any robots in rows after that (but n is 3, so rows are 0, 1, 2, and the loop runs 3 times). So after processing row 2, there are no more rows. Then, the code proceeds.\n\nBut in that case, the candidate is in row 2. To reach (0,0), we need to move up 2 times. But moving up 2 times would take the robot from row 2 to row 0. So that's allowed. But during those moves, other robots (if any) must not be present in rows 0 or 1. Because when moving up, robots in row 0 would move up to row -1, which is invalid. But according to the code's logic, since the candidate is in row 2 (the first row with a robot), any robots in rows 0 or 1 (higher up) are impossible. Because the code processes rows from top to bottom, and for those rows (0 and 1), if they had robots, they would have been processed first. So the code's logic ensures that the candidate is in the first row (from top) that has a robot. So if there are robots in rows 0 or 1, then the candidate would be in row 0 or 1, not row 2.\n\nAh, right. So in the code's processing order, the first robot encountered is in the topmost row that has a robot. Because the code processes rows from top to bottom. So if the first row (row 0) has no robots, the code proceeds to the next row (row 1), etc. So the candidate is in the first row (from top) that has a robot. Thus, the code's logic ensures that there are no robots in rows above (earlier processed rows) the candidate's row. Because those rows were processed first and didn't have any robots. So when moving up (i steps, where i is the candidate's row), the robots in rows >= i (which are all the robots) can move up i steps to row 0, 1, etc. No robot would go out of bounds.\n\nThus, the code's approach is to check two conditions:\n\n1. The candidate robot is the leftmost robot in the topmost row that has any robot.\n\n2. All other robots are in columns >= the candidate's column.\n\nIf both are true, then answer is YES. Else NO.\n\nSo in the code's missing part (the TODO section), when the first robot is found (top_robot_col is -1), the code needs to set top_robot_col to j. But wait, in the code, the rows are processed from top to bottom. For each row, we iterate through each column (left to right). So the first robot encountered in the entire grid is the leftmost robot in the topmost row that has any robot. Because the code processes rows from top to bottom and within each row, columns from left to right.\n\nThus, when the first robot is found (when top_robot_col is -1), we need to set top_robot_col to j. Because that's the leftmost column in the topmost row that has a robot. Then, any subsequent robot (in the same row or lower rows) with j < top_robot_col would cause ans to be false.\n\nWait, but in the same row, once top_robot_col is set, any other robot's j will be >= top_robot_col (since we process left to right). Because the first robot in the row is the leftmost. So the code's logic correctly captures that.\n\nSo, the missing code is to set top_robot_col to j, and also check that the robot's row is such that it can reach the top-left corner. Wait, no. The code's logic is that once the robot is in the topmost row, moving up (i steps, where i is the row index) will take it to row 0. But the row index is counted from 0. For example, if the candidate is in row i (0-based), moving up i times would bring it to row 0. But during that movement, the other robots must not go out of bounds. But according to the code's logic, other robots are in rows >= i, and columns >= top_robot_col. So moving up i times is allowed.\n\nSo the missing code is simply setting top_robot_col to j.\n\nLooking at the code's structure:\n\nif (row[j] == 'R') {\n    if (top_robot_col < 0) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    } else {\n        if (j < top_robot_col)\n            ans = false;\n    }\n}\n\nSo, when the first robot is found (top_robot_col is -1), the code needs to set top_robot_col to j. So the missing line is:\n\ntop_robot_col = j;\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Because after setting top_robot_col, the code needs to check that this robot's row is such that it can reach the upper left corner. But according to the code's logic, since the robot is in the topmost row, moving up i steps (where i is the row index) will bring it to row 0. But the code doesn't check that. Because, for example, if the candidate is in row 2 (0-based), then moving up 2 steps would require that during those steps, no other robots in rows 0 or 1. But according to the code's processing order, those rows are processed first. If they have any robots, then the candidate would have been in a higher row (earlier processed row). So the code's logic ensures that the candidate is in the first row (from top) with a robot. So any robots in rows above (earlier rows) are impossible. Because those rows were processed first and would have set top_robot_col already.\n\nSo, the missing code is simply assigning j to top_robot_col.\n\nThus, the missing line is:\n\ntop_robot_col = j;\n\nThat's it. That's the code that's missing. Because when the first robot is found (top_robot_col is -1), the code sets top_robot_col to that robot's column. Then, for any subsequent robots, if their column is less than top_robot_col, ans is set to false.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: n=1, m=2. Row is ER.\n\nThe first robot is in column 1. top_robot_col is set to 1. No other rows. So ans is true. Output is YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: n=2, m=2. Rows are RE and ER. The first row's first robot is column 0. Then, the second row's robot is at column 1. Which is >= 0. So ans is true? But according to the note, the answer is NO. Wait, this contradicts the code's logic.\n\nWait, sample 2's description says that any command would cause at least one robot to explode. Let me see:\n\nSample 2's input is:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nRow 0: R E\n\nRow 1: E R\n\nSo the robots are at (0,0) and (1,1).\n\nThe code's logic would first process row 0. The first 'R' is at j=0. top_robot_col is set to 0. Then, in row 1, the 'R' is at j=1. j is not less than top_robot_col (0), so ans remains true.\n\nSo the code would output YES. But according to the note, the correct answer is NO.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, this means that the code's approach is missing some condition.\n\nIn sample 2, the two robots are at (0,0) and (1,1). The candidate is (0,0). To reach (0,0), you don't need to move. But according to the problem statement, you need to make at least one robot reach the upper left corner. Since there's already a robot there, the answer is YES. Wait, no. Wait, sample 2's note says that the answer is NO. Wait, looking back:\n\nNo, sample 2's note says that in the second test case, if you send any command, at least one robot explodes. So the answer is NO.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that you can send any number of commands. If there's already a robot in (0,0), then the answer should be YES. But according to the note, sample 2's answer is NO. So what's going on here?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample notes:\n\nIn the second test case, if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes.\n\nAh, but perhaps the input for the second test case does not have a robot in (0,0). Let me recheck the note:\n\nSample 2's note says: \"in the second test case, if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes.\"\n\nSo the second test case's input must not have a robot in (0,0). Let me think: the input must have robots such that any movement command would cause at least one to explode.\n\nFor example, if the robots are at (0,1) and (1,0). Then, moving left would cause the (0,1) robot to move to (0,0), and the (1,0) robot would move to (1,-1), which is invalid. So the answer is NO.\n\nSo in that case, the code's logic would process row 0 first. The first robot is at (0,1). Then, row 1's robot is at (1,0), which is j=0 < top_robot_col=1. So ans is set to false. So the code would output NO. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the previous example I mentioned (sample 2 in the note), where the robots are (0,0) and (1,1), the code's logic would output YES. But according to the note, such a case would be handled correctly. For example, if a robot is already in (0,0), then the answer is YES, as in sample 4's note.\n\nSo, why did the code give a wrong answer for the second test case? Because the code's logic is correct, but perhaps the sample 2's input is such that the code would catch the problem.\n\nSo perhaps the code's logic is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's structure, the code's ans starts as true. Then, when a robot is found in a column less than top_robot_col, ans is set to false. But once ans is set to false, it remains false for all subsequent checks.\n\nSo, in the code's processing of the example where the first robot is (0,1) and there's a robot in (1,0), the code sets ans to false.\n\nBut in the case where the first robot is (0,0) and another robot is in (1,1), the code's ans remains true. So the code would output YES, which is correct.\n\nSo why is the sample 2's answer NO? Because the robots are in positions where any movement command would cause at least one explosion. But according to the code's logic, if there's a robot in (0,0), then the answer is YES. So perhaps in sample 2, the input is such that no robot is in (0,0).\n\nFor example, sample 2's input could be:\n\n2 2\n\nRE\n\nER\n\nSo the robots are in (0,0) and (1,1). Then, the code's logic would output YES, which is correct. But according to the note, sample 2's answer is NO. So there must be a different input.\n\nAh, perhaps sample 2's input is:\n\n2 2\n\nER\n\nRE\n\nSo robots are at (0,1) and (1,0). Then, in the code's logic, the first robot is (0,1), top_robot_col is 1. Then, in row 1, j=0 < 1. So ans is set to false. So output is NO, which matches the note.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nThus, the missing line is to set top_robot_col = j when the first robot is found.\n\nSo in the TODO section, the code should set top_robot_col to j.\n\nThus, the code to fill in is:\n\ntop_robot_col = j;\n\nThis is the missing line."
