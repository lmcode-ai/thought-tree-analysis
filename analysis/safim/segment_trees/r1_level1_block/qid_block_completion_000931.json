Each stamp application affects two neighboring cells, and you can apply the stamp multiple times. The key is figuring out the conditions under which the given string is possible. So, looking at the code provided. The code splits the input string by 'W's. For example, if the input is \"RBRBWWBR\", splitting by W gives [\"RBRB\", \"\", \"BR\"]. Then, for each of these segments (excluding the empty ones?), we check some conditions. In the loop, for each segment s in the split parts, they check if s has R or B. The variables b1 and b2 are true if R or B exist in s.",

So the code's current check is correct for that case. So perhaps the code's current logic is correct, and the missing code is in the 'TODO' part. Looking at the code:\n\nfor s in l:\n\n    b1 = 'R' in s\n\n    b2 = 'B' in s\n\n    if (b1 ^ b2):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo, the code sets bad = True if any of the segments has R or B but not both. So the code's logic is to check for that. But there's another condition: if the segment is of length 1. But the code's current check (b1 ^ b2) would catch that. For example, if s is \"R\", then 'R' is present, 'B' is not. So (b1 ^ b2) is True, and bad is set to True. Similarly, for s of length 2, like \"RR\": same logic. So code will mark it as invalid.

But the code currently does not do anything. So the missing code is to set bad = True here. So in the code, the line after the if (b1 ^ b2): should set bad to True. Because if any of the segments between Ws has only R or only B, then the answer is NO. So the missing code is:\n\nbad = True\n\nAnd perhaps break out of the loop. But the code may not need to break; setting bad to True is enough. So the code should be:\n\nif (b1 ^ b2):\n\n    bad = True But wait, that's already covered in the current code. Wait, no. Let's look:\n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor s in l:\n\n    b1 = 'R' in s\n\n    b2 = 'B' in s\n\n    if (b1 ^ b2):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code is missing the code to set bad = True when (b1 ^ b2) is True. So the answer to the problem is to fill in the TODO part with setting bad = True. Because whenever a segment has only R or only B, it's invalid. So the code should be:\n\nif (b1 ^ b2):\n\n    bad = True So the missing code is just that line. But why is that? Because any segment that contains only R or only B can't be formed by any number of stamps.",

So any such segment must have at least one R and one B. So the code's current logic is correct, and the missing code is to set bad = True in that case. But then why in the sample input 5, which has a segment \"BRB\", which has both R and B, the code's check passes and the answer is YES. So the code is correct, and the missing line is setting bad = True when (b1 ^ b2) is True. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n    if (b1 ^ b2):\n\n        bad = True\n\nWhich is to say, whenever a segment has only R or only B, the answer is NO. So the solution is to add 'bad = True' inside that if block.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed using the stamp which changes two adjacent cells into R and B in some order. Each stamp application affects two neighboring cells, and you can apply the stamp multiple times. The key is figuring out the conditions under which the given string is possible.\n\nSo, looking at the code provided. The code splits the input string by 'W's. For example, if the input is \"RBRBWWBR\", splitting by W gives [\"RBRB\", \"\", \"BR\"]. Then, for each of these segments (excluding the empty ones?), we check some conditions.\n\nIn the loop, for each segment s in the split parts, they check if s has R or B. The variables b1 and b2 are true if R or B exist in s. Then, if (b1 XOR b2), which means the segment has only R's or only B's. But according to the problem's constraints, that's impossible. Because each stamp application must place an R and B pair. So any valid segment (the parts between W's) must have at least one R and one B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, the code currently sets bad to True if (b1 ^ b2), which is when the segment has only R or only B. Because that's invalid. Because each stamp operation affects two adjacent cells as R and B. So if a segment has only R's and no B's, or only B's and no R's, then it's impossible.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a segment is of length 1? Like \"R\" or \"B\". Then, that's impossible, because the stamp requires two cells. So the code splits on W's, and each non-W segment must have at least one R and B. Also, any segment of length 1 (like \"R\") would automatically fail, because it can't be formed by any number of stamp operations. Because each stamp affects two cells. So the code's current check (if the segment has R but no B, or B but no R) would catch that, since a single R would have b1=True, b2=False, leading to (b1 ^ b2) being true. Then bad becomes True.\n\nBut wait, the code's current check is: if (b1 XOR b2), then set bad to True. So for any segment that's non-empty (like after splitting by W), if the segment has only R's or only B's, then it's invalid.\n\nBut there's another condition. For example, the segments between W's must have even number of R's and B's? Or perhaps the parity is important. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nEach stamp application changes two cells. Each application can toggle the colors. For example, applying a stamp on two cells can change them from W to RB or BR. Applying again would toggle again. So each application is equivalent to XOR'ing the colors. But because each cell can be part of multiple stamps, the parity of the number of times it's stamped might affect the color.\n\nWait, the problem states that each usage of the stamp recolors both cells. So if a cell is stamped multiple times, each time it flips its color. For example, applying RB once, then applying RB again would turn it back to W. Wait no. Let's see. Wait, the initial color is W. When you stamp a pair, you set them to R and B. Then, if you stamp again, you set them again. So, for example, if you stamp the same pair again as RB, then the first cell becomes R (since it was R, but stamping again would flip it? Wait, wait. Let's clarify the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: Each usage of the stamp recolors both cells under the stamp. So, each time you stamp a pair of cells, their colors are set to either RB or BR, depending on how you apply the stamp. Wait, no. Wait, the stamp can be applied in either orientation. So each application of the stamp sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So it's not a toggle. For example, if you apply the stamp as RB, then applying it again as RB would set the same colors again. But maybe you can apply it in different orientations each time.\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Using a stamp, you can stamp any two neighboring cells such that one becomes red and the other becomes blue. A stamp can be rotated, i.e. it can be used in both ways: as BR and as RB. During use, the stamp must completely fit on the given n cells (it cannot be partially outside the cells). The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell. Each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\"\n\nAh, so each time you apply the stamp, you choose which orientation to use. So each application of the stamp on positions i and i+1 can set them to either RB or BR. So, for example, if you apply the stamp once as RB, then apply it again as BR, the first cell would be R then B, and the second cell would be B then R. But each application overwrites the previous colors.\n\nBut wait, that's not possible. Because if you apply the stamp once as RB, then applying again as BR would set them to BR. So each stamp application completely overwrites the colors of the two cells. So each application is independent. So the order of applying the stamps is important. But how can this lead to a certain configuration?\n\nBut the problem is to determine if it's possible to reach the target configuration from all white cells by applying any number of stamps (each in any orientation). So each stamp application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. But since you can apply the stamp multiple times, perhaps even overlapping applications, the final colors are determined by the parity of the number of times each cell is covered by a stamp in a certain way.\n\nWait, maybe that's the key. Let's model the problem in terms of parity.\n\nEach cell's color depends on the number of times it is covered by a stamp. For example:\n\nEach time a cell is part of a stamp, its color is flipped. Because applying the stamp again would change it. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think:\n\nIf a cell is covered by a stamp in the first position (as R in an RB stamp), then its color becomes R. If it's covered again in the same position (R in another RB stamp), then it becomes R again. Wait, but that's not flipping. It's just setting to R again. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that each application of the stamp recolors the two cells. So each application sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So each application overwrites the previous color. So the order of application is important. For example, applying a stamp on positions 1-2 as RB, then applying on 2-3 as BR, then applying on 1-2 as BR, etc.\n\nBut in that case, the final color of each cell depends on the last time the stamp was applied to a pair that includes it. Because each application of a stamp on a pair sets their colors. So for example, cell 1 is only affected when the pair (1,2) is stamped. Cell 2 is affected when (1,2) or (2,3) is stamped. So if cell 2 is part of two stamps, its color will be set by the latest application.\n\nBut if this is the case, the problem becomes more complex. Because the order of applying the stamps matters, but we need to find any possible sequence of stamps that leads to the target configuration. So perhaps the key is to model the problem in terms of parity of the number of stamps applied to each cell, but the problem's approach is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern that the target configuration must satisfy. For example, each non-W segment (the parts between Ws) must have an even number of R and B, or some parity condition.\n\nWait, looking at the sample inputs. For example, the fifth test case example: input is \"BRB\". The solution is possible. The steps are:\n\nWWW -> W RB (applied to positions 2-3 as RB) -> BR B (applied to 1-2 as BR). So the final is BRB.\n\nAnother example, the sixth test case: \"RBB\" is possible. Steps: WWW -> W RB (positions 2-3 as RB) -> RB B (applied to 1-2 as RB). So the final is RBB.\n\nWait, but in this case, the third cell is B. So how can that be achieved? Because the stamp applied to 2-3 as RB sets cell 2 to R and 3 to B. Then applying to 1-2 as RB sets cell 1 to R and 2 to B. So the final is R B B. So yes.\n\nBut in this case, the non-W segments (RBB) has R and B, so it's allowed.\n\nSo the key condition seems to be that each non-W segment (split by W) must have at least one R and one B. Because otherwise, if a segment is all R or all B, it's impossible.\n\nBut also, each segment must have a length of at least 2. Because the stamp covers two cells. Wait, no. Because even a single cell can be part of a stamp. Wait, no. The stamp is two cells. So for a segment to be non-W, it must have a length of at least 1? But how?\n\nWait, the segments are split by W. So if the original string is \"R\", then splitting by W gives [\"R\"], which is a segment of length 1. But such a string is impossible, since you can't apply any stamps to create a single R. Because the stamp requires two cells. So any segment with length 1 is invalid, as the code's current check would catch it (since if the segment is \"R\", then 'R' is present and 'B' is not, so (b1 ^ b2) is True, leading to bad = True).\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each split segment s (split by W):\n\nIf s is non-empty:\n\n   check if s has R (b1) and B (b2)\n\n   if (b1 XOR b2) is True (meaning it has R but no B, or B but no R):\n\n       then set bad = True.\n\nBut in this case, if the segment is \"R\" (length 1), then the check would set bad = True, which is correct.\n\nBut what about segments of even length? Or other conditions?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is missing another check. Because even if a segment has both R and B, but starts with R and has even length, maybe that's impossible. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's think of another example. Suppose a segment is \"RBRB\". Then, the code would check that there are both R and B, so (b1 ^ b2) is False. So it's allowed. Which is correct, because that's possible.\n\nAnother example: \"RBBB\". Let's see. The split by W would be [\"RBBB\"], which has R and B. So code allows it. But can it be formed?\n\nSuppose the steps: starting from WWWW.\n\nApply the stamp to 1-2 as RB: R B W W.\n\nApply to 2-3 as BR: R R B W.\n\nApply to 3-4 as BR: R R R B.\n\nWait, that's RRRB. So how to get RBBB?\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. For example, stamp 3-4 as BR (so positions 3 and 4 become B and R?), then stamp 2-3 as BR (positions 2 becomes B, 3 becomes R), then stamp 1-2 as BR (1 becomes B, 2 becomes R). Then, the sequence would be B R R R. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is possible. For example, to get \"RBBB\":\n\nStart with WWWW.\n\nStamp 1-2 as BR: B R W W.\n\nStamp 2-3 as BR: B B R W.\n\nStamp 3-4 as BR: B B B R.\n\nWait, but that's BBBR. Not RBBB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe stamp 2-3 as BR, then 1-2 as BR, then 3-4 as BR.\n\nWait:\n\nStart WWWW.\n\nStamp 2-3 as BR: W B R W.\n\nStamp 1-2 as BR: B B R W.\n\nStamp 3-4 as BR: B B B R.\n\nStill not.\n\nHmm. So perhaps \"RBBB\" is not possible? Then the code's current check would allow it (since it has R and B), but in reality it's impossible.\n\nWait, so the code's current check is not sufficient.\n\nSo, the problem arises when the code's existing logic is missing some other condition.\n\nSo, what's the correct condition?\n\nThe key insight is that each non-W segment must have at least one R and one B (so the code's current check is correct for that), but also that the number of R's and B's in the segment must have the same parity. Or perhaps that the first and last characters are different? Or perhaps the parity of the length of the segment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the segment must have at least two characters and must have both R and B. But that's the same as the code's current check plus checking that the segment is not of length 1. Wait, but in the code, after splitting, the segments can be of length 1. For example, if the input is \"RW\", the split would be [\"R\", \"\"], and the code checks each s in l. So for s = \"R\", it checks if it has R but not B, which sets bad to True.\n\nBut what about segments of length 2? Like \"RR\". The code would see that it has R but not B, so (b1 ^ b2) is True, which is bad. So \"RR\" is invalid, which is correct.\n\nBut what about a segment like \"RBR\"? Let's see. It has both R and B, so the code would allow it. But can such a segment be formed?\n\nWait, \"RBR\" has length 3. So the segments after splitting by W must have even length? Because each stamp affects two cells. Wait, but the sample input 5 had \"BRB\", which is of length 3. But according to the sample explanation, it's possible. So that's a problem. Because the code's current check allows it, but according to the problem's sample, it's possible. So maybe segments of odd lengths are possible.\n\nWait, in sample 5: \"BRB\" is the input. The code splits it into [\"BRB\"], which has both R and B. So code allows it. So the code's current check would allow it, which is correct.\n\nSo the code's current logic (check that each non-W segment has at least one R and B) is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps there's another condition: the segment must have an even number of R's and B's? Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the number of R's and B's in the segment is irrelevant, but the order and arrangement must allow for overlapping stamps to build up the desired pattern.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem differently.\n\nEach stamp application affects two adjacent cells, setting them to either RB or BR. So each stamp operation can be viewed as choosing a pair and writing either RB or BR. The question is whether the target can be built from these operations.\n\nBut each time you apply the stamp to a pair, it overwrites their colors. So the last stamp applied to a pair determines their colors. However, overlapping pairs can be applied in any order.\n\nSo for example, the segment \"RBR\" can be achieved by:\n\nApply to positions 1-2 as RB: R B W.\n\nApply to positions 2-3 as BR: R B R.\n\nSo that's possible. So a segment of length 3 is allowed, as long as it has R and B.\n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" can be achieved by applying stamps in the first two positions and then the next two.\n\nSo the code's current check is necessary but not sufficient. It ensures that each non-W segment has at least one R and B, but there are other cases that might be invalid even if that's true.\n\nWait, but in the code's current form, how is the check done? For example, for a segment like \"RBRB\", the code checks that there are both R and B. So (b1 and b2) are True, so (b1 ^ b2) is False. So the code proceeds.\n\nBut what about a segment like \"RBBR\"? That has both R and B. So the code allows it. Which is correct, as it can be formed by stamps.\n\nSo perhaps the code's check is sufficient. Let's see some other test cases.\n\nTest case where the answer is NO:\n\nInput: \"RBRR\"\n\nSplit into [\"RBRR\"], which has R and B. So code allows it, but can it be formed?\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with four white cells.\n\nStamps:\n\nApply 1-2 as RB: R B W W.\n\nApply 3-4 as BR: R B B R.\n\nResult: R B B R. But the target is R B R R. So no. So how to achieve that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nApply 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply 2-3 as BR \u2192 R R B W.\n\nApply 3-4 as BR \u2192 R R R B.\n\nNo. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, apply to 2-3 as RB, then 3-4 as RB:\n\nR B R B.\n\nBut that's R B R B. Target is R B R R.\n\nHmm. Not sure. Maybe it's possible. Or maybe it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's current check is sufficient. Because even if the code allows some cases that are impossible, maybe there's a mistake in the code. But according to the sample inputs and the code's logic, perhaps the code is missing some checks.\n\nWait, in the code, after splitting the string into parts separated by W, for each part s:\n\nIf the part s is empty (i.e., due to consecutive Ws or leading/trailing Ws), we ignore it.\n\nFor each non-empty part s:\n\nWe check if s contains R or B.\n\nIf s contains R but not B, or B but not R \u2192 invalid.\n\nBut this would allow parts that have both R and B but are of even or odd length.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample input 5 has a part of length 3 (BRB) which is allowed.\n\nSo the code's current check is correct for that case. So perhaps the code's current logic is correct, and the missing code is in the 'TODO' part.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nfor s in l:\n\n    b1 = 'R' in s\n\n    b2 = 'B' in s\n\n    if (b1 ^ b2):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo, the code sets bad = True if any of the segments has R or B but not both. So the code's logic is to check for that. But there's another condition: if the segment is of length 1. But the code's current check (b1 ^ b2) would catch that.\n\nFor example, if s is \"R\", then 'R' is present, 'B' is not. So (b1 ^ b2) is True, and bad is set to True.\n\nSimilarly, for s of length 2, like \"RR\": same logic. So code will mark it as invalid.\n\nBut what about s of length 0? For example, after splitting, some parts can be empty. For example, input \"WW\" \u2192 split into [\"\", \"\", \"\"], which are all empty. So in this case, the code will output YES (since all parts are empty), which is correct because the desired string is all Ws, which is possible by not using any stamps.\n\nSo the code's current logic seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about a segment of length 3 with R and B, like \"RBR\"?\n\nThe code's check would pass (since it has R and B), and the code would not set bad. So the code would output YES. Which is correct, as we can form it with stamps.\n\nSo perhaps the code's current check is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 7, the input is all Ws. So code splits into empty strings, and the code returns YES.\n\nSo why is the code's current logic correct?\n\nThe key is that each segment between Ws must have both R and B. Because each stamp application affects two cells and adds at least one R and B. So any sequence between Ws that has only R or only B is impossible. And any sequence with both R and B is possible.\n\nWait, but is that true? Let's see.\n\nFor example, the segment \"BRB\" is possible. But what about a segment like \"BRRB\"?\n\nCan that be formed?\n\nYes. For example:\n\nStamps:\n\nApply 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nApply 3-4 as RB \u2192 B W R B.\n\nBut this is not possible. Wait, the stamp must be applied on adjacent pairs. So how to build \"BRRB\".\n\nHmm. Let's think:\n\nStart with four Ws: WWWW.\n\nApply stamp on 1-2 as BR: B R W W.\n\nApply stamp on 2-3 as RB: B B R W.\n\nApply stamp on 3-4 as BR: B B B R.\n\nResult is BBBR, which is not the desired BRRB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another sequence:\n\nApply 2-3 as BR \u2192 W B R W.\n\nApply 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B R W.\n\nApply 3-4 as BR \u2192 R B B R.\n\nResult: RBBR.\n\nNot BRRB.\n\nHmm. So maybe BRRB can't be formed. But according to the code's logic, it would be considered valid since the segment has both R and B.\n\nSo there's a problem here. The code's logic would allow BRRB, but in reality, it might not be possible.\n\nBut how to check for such cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct, but there's another condition. For example, the first and last characters must be different.\n\nWait, in the sample input 5, BRB starts with B and ends with B. So the first and last characters are the same. But it's possible. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the number of R's and B's must be the same.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of a segment like \"RBRB\" (even length, two R's and two B's). That's possible.\n\nBut what about \"RBR\" (two R's and one B). Can that be formed?\n\nYes, as we saw earlier. So the parity of the count may not matter.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the code's current logic is not sufficient, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct and the sample cases are covered. So what's the missing code?\n\nLooking at the code: the code loops through each split segment. For each, if (b1 XOR b2) is True, then bad is set to True. The TODO part is where this happens. So the code currently sets bad = True if any segment has only R or only B.\n\nBut the code as provided is missing that check. Wait, no. The code has:\n\nif (b1 ^ b2):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo, when the segment has only R or only B, the code needs to set bad to True. But the code currently does not do anything. So the missing code is to set bad = True here.\n\nSo in the code, the line after the if (b1 ^ b2): should set bad to True. Because if any of the segments between Ws has only R or only B, then the answer is NO.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nbad = True\n\nAnd perhaps break out of the loop. But the code may not need to break; setting bad to True is enough.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif (b1 ^ b2):\n\n    bad = True\n\nBut wait, that's already covered in the current code. Wait, no. Let's look:\n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor s in l:\n\n    b1 = 'R' in s\n\n    b2 = 'B' in s\n\n    if (b1 ^ b2):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code is missing the code to set bad = True when (b1 ^ b2) is True.\n\nSo the answer to the problem is to fill in the TODO part with setting bad = True. Because whenever a segment has only R or only B, it's invalid.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif (b1 ^ b2):\n\n    bad = True\n\nSo the missing code is just that line.\n\nBut why is that? Because any segment that contains only R or only B can't be formed by any number of stamps. Because each stamp must apply to two cells, and each application must set one to R and the other to B. So any such segment must have at least one R and one B.\n\nSo the code's current logic is correct, and the missing code is to set bad = True in that case.\n\nBut then why in the sample input 5, which has a segment \"BRB\", which has both R and B, the code's check passes and the answer is YES.\n\nSo the code is correct, and the missing line is setting bad = True when (b1 ^ b2) is True.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\n    if (b1 ^ b2):\n\n        bad = True\n\nWhich is to say, whenever a segment has only R or only B, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the solution is to add 'bad = True' inside that if block."
