Then, for each day i, if removing it's contribution would eliminate all positions j where the maximum a_j (without day i) is <= M. But how to compute the maximum a_j after removing each day i.

Wait, in the code, the current code for the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < int(coords.size()); i++) {\n    cur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n    cur_pos = coords[i].first;\n    cur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\n    if (cur_val > M) {\n        // need to update lo and hi\n        // the interval is [previous_cur_pos, current cur_pos)\n        // previous_cur_pos was the value before the first line of the loop iteration.\n        // So previous_cur_pos = cur_pos before the first line.\n        // But after the first line, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\n        // So during this iteration, the interval is [prev_cur_pos, coords[i].first)\n        // where prev_cur_pos is the original cur_pos before the first line.\n\n        // So in this case, prev_cur_pos is coords[i].first - (coords[i].first - cur_pos_original) ?\n        // No. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\n        // Before processing the current iteration, cur_pos is some value, say, A.\n\n        // Then, in the first line, we compute (coords[i].first - A) * cur_slope and add to cur_val.\n\n        // Then, cur_pos is set to coords[i].first.\n\n        // So the interval processed is [A, coords[i].first).\n\n        //",

So the missing code would be:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        Because cur_pos is now coords[i].first.

But given the code's current structure, this is the only way to proceed. So, the missing code is:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        This would track the leftmost and rightmost coordinates where the value after processing the interval is over M.\n\n        In the first test case, perhaps these coordinates form the boundaries of the problematic interval. So when the third day's influence covers them, removing it would reduce the a_j's in that interval. So, the answer to fill in the TODO is:\n\n        lo = std::min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = std::max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        Because cur_pos is coords[i].first, and when cur_val > M, this position is considered part of the problematic region. But this is incorrect in the general case. However, the code's author may have intended this. So, according to the code's structure, the correct code to fill in the missing part is:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        Which in C++ would be:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos); So the missing code is:\n\n        lo = std::min(lo, cur_pos);\n        hi = std::max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        But in the code, the variables lo and hi are initialized to INF and -INF. So, after the first occurrence of cur_val > M, lo will be set to cur_pos (coords[i].first), and hi to the same value. Subsequent checks will update lo and hi to track the minimum and maximum of such cur_pos values.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each rain day whether removing that day's rain will prevent a flood. A flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds M. The original approach in the code seems to be using a line sweep or coordinate compression to track the maximum accumulated rainfall. The missing part is where the current value (cur_val) exceeds M. \n\nThe code processes each rain event by creating intervals with start, peak, and end points. These are sorted, and then the line sweep calculates the accumulated rainfall. When cur_val exceeds M, the code needs to update the lo and hi variables, which I suppose represent the minimum and maximum positions where the rainfall exceeds M. \n\nSo, when the current value is over M between two coordinates, the interval from the previous position (cur_pos before the current step) to the current coords[i].first is where the flood occurs. But how to track the maximum and minimum positions where this happens?\n\nWait, when cur_val > M, that means during the interval between the previous position (cur_pos) and the current coords[i].first, the value is above M. So the entire interval [prev_pos, current pos) has a_val exceeding M. So for each such interval, we need to track the earliest position (prev_pos) and the latest position (current coords[i].first) where this occurs. \n\nThe variables lo and hi are initialized to INF and -INF. The idea is that lo will be the minimum left end of any such interval, and hi the maximum right end. After collecting all such intervals, the union of all these intervals would form a range from lo to hi. Then, for each rain event, if removing it (by setting p_i=0) would cover this entire lo to hi range, then the answer is 1; otherwise, 0.\n\nSo, for each interval where the rainfall is over M, we need to update lo to be the minimum of the current lo and the start of the interval (which is the previous position before this step). Similarly, hi is the maximum of current hi and the end of the interval (coords[i].first).\n\nWait, but how do we get the start of the interval? Because during the line sweep, when we process coords[i], the current_val is computed as the value after moving from cur_pos (previous) to coords[i].first. So the interval between the previous cur_pos and coords[i].first is where the current_val is updated. So when cur_val > M, that entire interval is where the a[j] exceeds M.\n\nSo in the code, during the loop over coords, when cur_val exceeds M, the interval is [prev_pos, current coords[i].first). So for that interval, we need to update lo to be the minimum of the previous lo and prev_pos. Similarly, hi is the maximum of hi and coords[i].first.\n\nWait, but how to track prev_pos? Because before processing coords[i], cur_pos is the previous position. Then, cur_val is calculated by multiplying the time since the last position (coords[i].first - cur_pos) by the slope. Then, after adding that to cur_val, the cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\nWait, the code starts with cur_pos = 0. Then, for each coords[i], it does:\n\ncur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\nThis means that between the previous cur_pos and the current coords[i].first, the value increases by (distance) multiplied by the slope. So during that interval, the slope is constant. So the value is increasing or decreasing linearly.\n\nIf during this interval, the value exceeds M, then we need to find the part of the interval where this happens. However, since the code checks if cur_val > M, but that's after the entire interval has been processed. Wait, maybe that's not right. Because the cur_val is the value at the current position. So when you process the coords[i], the code is adding the contribution from the previous position to the current position, then updating the slope.\n\nBut the problem is that the cur_val might cross M during the interval between cur_pos and coords[i].first. So perhaps the code's approach is not precise. But maybe the code is designed to track the maximum value in each interval, assuming that the slope is constant. So the maximum in the interval can be at the start or end, depending on the slope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line sweep is capturing all the critical points where the slope changes, and between these points, the a[j] function is linear. So during each interval [cur_pos, coords[i].first), the function is linear with slope cur_slope (before processing coords[i]).\n\nWait, maybe the code is incorrect in how it calculates the intervals. Let me think again.\n\nThe coords are sorted. For each interval between two consecutive coords points, the slope is the same. So between coords[i].first and coords[i+1].first, the slope is cur_slope (after processing coords[i]). But when we process each coord, we first calculate the contribution to the current value from the previous position to this coord. Then we update the slope.\n\nSo the code's approach is to track the current value and slope, and for each interval between the previous position and current coord, compute the accumulated change.\n\nBut when they check if cur_val > M after processing the interval, perhaps they are checking if at the end of the interval, the value is above M. But that's not capturing all cases where the value in the interval was above M.\n\nWait, maybe the code is incorrect. Because the code checks if cur_val (the value after the interval) is greater than M. But during the interval, the value could have been higher, depending on the slope.\n\nFor example, if the slope is positive (increasing), then the maximum in the interval is at the end (current coords[i].first). If the slope is negative (decreasing), the maximum is at the start (cur_pos). If the slope is zero, the value remains the same.\n\nSo, if during the interval [prev_pos, coords[i].first), the maximum a[j] in that interval is either the starting value (if slope is negative) or the ending value (if slope is positive). So in the code, when they check cur_val > M after processing the interval, they might miss intervals where the maximum was in the middle.\n\nBut perhaps the code is designed such that the maximum a[j] over all positions j can be found by considering all the points where the slope changes, and the code checks the maximum in each interval by looking at the endpoints.\n\nBut maybe in the problem's setup, the code is correct. So the code is tracking all the points where the slope changes, and for each interval between those points, the maximum value is either at the start or end.\n\nBut the code's current approach is to check if the current value (after processing the interval) is greater than M, and then update lo and hi. But this might miss intervals where the value was above M in the middle but not at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the code's line sweep might not capture all maximum points. So maybe the code is incorrect. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the problem requires that at any moment (i.e., after each day's rain), the a[j] could be over M. But the code's approach is to compute the maximum a[j] after all rains, and then see if any position exceeds M. So the code is processing all rains first, and then checking if any position's a[j] exceeds M. But the problem's flood occurs if at any moment (after each day's rain), there's a j with a[j] > M. Wait, no, the problem says: after the i-th day's rain. So the order of adding the rain days matters.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says that after all days' rains (if you don't erase any), the a[j] is the sum of all max(0, p_i - |x_i -j|) for each day i. So the code's approach is to compute the total a[j] after all days, and if any a[j] exceeds M, then there's a flood.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that a flood occurs if at any moment, after any day's rain, the accumulated rainfall exceeds M. So after each day, we have to check if any a[j] exceeds M. So the code's approach of computing the total a[j] (summing all days) and checking if that exceeds M would be incorrect, because perhaps during the process, after some day, the a[j] already exceeds M, even if the total after all days is below M.\n\nWait, but the code's current approach may not model that. Because it's adding all the rains, and then computing the a[j]. So the code is incorrect as per the problem statement.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the code's approach is to model the a[j] after all days, but the actual flood condition is that after any day's rain, any a[j] exceeds M. So the code's approach is wrong. But according to the code given, the coords are generated by considering each rain's contribution. So the code is modeling the total a[j] after all rains. So perhaps the problem's actual condition is that the flood occurs if, after all days, any a[j] exceeds M. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"A flood will hit your field if, at any moment, there is a position j with accumulated rainfall a_j > m.\"\n\nAh, so it's not after all days, but after any day. So even if after the first day, a_j exceeds M, the flood happens. But the code's current approach is to compute the a[j] as the sum of all days. So the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code given is wrong. But the user wants us to fill in the missing parts of this code, assuming that the code is correct otherwise. So perhaps the problem's code is correct, and the problem's statement is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that the accumulated a_j is the sum of all days' contributions. Because in the code, the coords are all the events from all days. So perhaps the problem's actual description is that the a_j is the sum of all days, and the flood occurs if after all days, any a_j is over M. Because otherwise, the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's note, in the first test case, when not using the spell, the accumulated a_j is such that some positions are over M. So the code's approach is to compute the sum of all days, check if any a_j exceeds M, and then when you remove a day, check if the sum after removing it is acceptable.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is correct. So in the code, after processing all rain events, the code calculates the maximum a[j] over all positions j. If that maximum exceeds M, then there is a flood. Otherwise, no. But the problem's statement says that a flood occurs if at any moment (after any day's rain), any a_j exceeds M. So the code's approach is incorrect. But given that the code is provided and we need to fill in the missing parts, perhaps the problem's actual intended solution is that the flood is determined based on the final a_j.\n\nBut the problem's note says that in the first test case, the third day's rain is erased. So perhaps the code is correct in considering the sum of all days except the erased one. So the code's approach is to compute for each i, the a_j after all days except the i-th, and check if any a_j exceeds M.\n\nBut how to model that efficiently. The code uses a line sweep to compute the maximum a_j, but for each i, the code must subtract the contribution of the i-th day. \n\nBut the code's approach seems to compute the entire a_j for all days, and then for each rain event, checks if removing that event (so that its contribution is subtracted) would cause the maximum a_j to be <= M. But how to do that efficiently.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\n- For each test case, compute the initial a_j for all days. Then, for each day i, check if removing that day's contribution (i.e., subtracting its contribution) would bring all a_j's to <= M.\n\nBut the code's approach is to compute the initial maximum a_j's. Then, for each day i, if the maximum a_j in the initial computation is such that after removing day i's contribution, it's <= M. But that's not correct, because when you remove day i's contribution, the a_j's are sum of all days except day i. So the initial code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut according to the code, the variables lo and hi are computed based on the initial a_j's (with all days), and then for each day i, the code checks if the day's contribution covers the entire [lo, hi] interval. If the day's contribution (x_i - p_i) is <= lo and x_i + p_i >= hi, then removing this day would subtract a contribution that covers the entire problematic interval. Because the problematic interval is [lo, hi], and the day's rain contributes max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|) for j in [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i]. So if [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i] includes [lo, hi], then subtracting this day's contribution would remove all contributions in that interval, potentially bringing the a_j's in [lo, hi] down by their respective values. So if the original a_j's in [lo, hi] were all exceeding M by at most the contribution of this day (so a_j - (p_i - |x_i -j|) <= M), then removing this day would make a_j <= M.\n\nBut this logic depends on the assumption that the maximum a_j's are in the [lo, hi] interval, and that the day's contribution is the only one contributing to that interval. Which is not necessarily true. However, the code's approach is that if the day's influence covers the entire problematic interval, then removing it would eliminate the maximums, thus preventing the flood.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\n1. Compute the initial a_j's (sum all days).\n2. Find the interval [lo, hi] where a_j exceeds M. The lo is the leftmost position where a_j exceeds M, and hi is the rightmost.\n3. For each day i, check if the day's influence (x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i) covers the entire [lo, hi]. If yes, then removing this day would subtract its contribution from all positions in [lo, hi], possibly bringing a_j down by enough to be <= M. Otherwise, even after removing this day, there are positions in [lo, hi] that still have a_j > M.\n\nBut how to compute [lo, hi]? The code is supposed to track all intervals where a_j exceeds M. Then, lo is the minimum of all left endpoints of such intervals, and hi is the maximum of all right endpoints.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nIn the code's current setup, during the line sweep, when cur_val > M, the code is supposed to process that interval. The variables lo and hi are initialized to INF and -INF. Then, for each such interval, lo is the minimum between current lo and the start of the interval, and hi is the maximum between current hi and the end of the interval.\n\nBut how to get the start of the interval. The code's current loop processes coords in order, and for each coord, calculates the current_val after moving from the previous position (cur_pos) to the current coord's position. The interval is [prev_pos, current coords[i].first). So when cur_val exceeds M, the entire interval is problematic. \n\nBut in the code, the check is if (cur_val > M). Wait, but cur_val is the value at the end of the interval. So the code is checking if the value after processing the interval is over M. But if the slope is negative, the maximum in the interval is at the start. So maybe the code is missing cases where the interval's starting value is over M, but the ending value is not.\n\nBut how to properly track all intervals where a_j exceeds M. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, and the missing part is simply updating lo and hi whenever cur_val exceeds M. But I need to see the code structure.\n\nThe code has:\n\n{\n    int64_t cur_pos = 0;\n    int64_t cur_val = 0;\n    int64_t cur_slope = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < int(coords.size()); i++) {\n        cur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n        cur_pos = coords[i].first;\n        cur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\n        if (cur_val > M) {\n            // TODO: Update lo and hi\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but cur_val is the value at coords[i].first. The code checks if cur_val > M here, which is the value at the current position. So if during the interval [prev_pos, cur_pos], the value was over M, but at the end it's not, then the code will miss that interval.\n\nSo this approach is only checking the endpoints. So perhaps the code is incorrect. However, given that the code is provided and we need to fill in the missing part, perhaps the correct approach is to track the interval where the value after processing the current step is over M, and then update lo and hi accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the code is intended to collect all positions where the a_j exceeds M. The line sweep is building the a_j function, and during the sweep, whenever the current value (after the interval) is over M, we need to track the entire interval.\n\nBut how to compute the interval where the value is over M. Let's think:\n\nEach time we process a coordinate, the code is moving from cur_pos to coords[i].first. During that interval, the slope is cur_slope (before processing coords[i].second). So the value increases by (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope. So the value at the start of the interval is cur_val_prev = cur_val - (coords[i].first - cur_pos)*cur_slope.\n\nWait no. Before adding the contribution, cur_val is the value at the previous position. Then, we add (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope to get the new value. So during the interval [cur_pos, coords[i].first), the value changes from cur_val_prev to cur_val_prev + (coords[i].first - cur_pos)*cur_slope. Wait, no. Because the code does:\n\ncur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\nSo the cur_val after this line is the value at the new position (coords[i].first). But during the interval between previous cur_pos and coords[i].first, the value is changing linearly. So the value at the start of the interval is cur_val_prev = cur_val (before this step) + (coords[i].first - cur_pos)*cur_slope_prev (but cur_slope_prev is the slope before adding coords[i].second). Wait, perhaps the code's approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correctly capturing the maximum a_j for all positions. Let's see:\n\nThe coords array is sorted. For each interval between two consecutive coords points, the slope is constant. So the a[j] function is a piecewise linear function. The maximum a[j] in each interval can be found by checking the endpoints. So the code's approach of checking the endpoints is sufficient.\n\nSo when processing coords[i], after adding the contribution from cur_pos to coords[i].first, the code checks if the current value (at coords[i].first) is over M. If so, then the entire interval from cur_pos (before this step) to coords[i].first (current) is part of the problem. Wait, no. Because the value at coords[i].first is cur_val, which is after adding (coords[i].first - cur_pos)*cur_slope. So the previous cur_val was the value at cur_pos (before moving). Then, during the move to coords[i].first, the value increases by (distance) * slope. So the value during this interval is linear. So the maximum in the interval could be at the start, end, or somewhere in between.\n\nBut if the slope is positive, then the maximum is at the end. If the slope is negative, the maximum is at the start. If slope is zero, the value is constant.\n\nSo during the loop, for each interval [prev_pos, current pos], we need to check if the maximum value in that interval exceeds M.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor example, if during the interval, the value starts at V_prev and ends at V_curr (cur_val). The maximum is max(V_prev, V_curr) if the slope is non-zero. If the slope is positive, V_curr is larger. If slope is negative, V_prev is larger.\n\nSo the code's current approach of only checking if V_curr exceeds M will miss cases where the maximum in the interval is V_prev (which would be when the slope is negative).\n\nSo the code's current approach is incorrect because it may miss intervals where the value started above M and ended below, but the code only checks the end value.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic for finding the intervals where a_j exceeds M is flawed. But given that this is the code provided, we have to fill in the missing part.\n\nBut according to the code, when the current value exceeds M, we need to update lo and hi. So perhaps the code is only checking the points where the current value is over M, and then assuming that the entire interval from the previous position to current position contributes to the flood.\n\nBut this is incorrect. For example, if the slope is negative and the previous value was higher than M, but the current value is lower than M, then during the interval [prev_pos, current pos], the value decreases from higher than M to lower. So part of the interval is above M. But the code would not catch this because it only checks the current value.\n\nBut given that the code is written this way, perhaps the intended solution is to track all positions where the a_j exceeds M by checking during the line sweep. So the missing code is to update lo and hi whenever cur_val exceeds M.\n\nBut in that case, the code would miss the intervals where the value was above M but the end value is not. \n\nHowever, perhaps the code is intended to compute the maximum a_j over all positions, and if that maximum is <= M, then there's no flood. Otherwise, there is. Then, for each day i, if removing it's contribution would eliminate all positions j where the maximum a_j (without day i) is <= M.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum a_j after removing each day i.\n\nThe code's approach seems to precompute the initial lo and hi, which are the leftmost and rightmost positions where a_j exceeds M. Then, for each day i, if the day's contribution covers the entire [lo, hi], then removing it would subtract from all positions in [lo, hi], potentially reducing a_j's in that region by enough to be <= M. Otherwise, there's still a position in [lo, hi] that remains above M.\n\nBut this requires that the day's influence (x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i) includes the entire [lo, hi] interval. So, when the code checks if r.x - r.v <= lo and r.x + r.v >= hi, then this day's contribution is the only one covering the entire problematic interval. So removing it would eliminate all the contributions in that interval.\n\nBut this approach is only valid if the initial a_j in [lo, hi] are exactly equal to the maximum (M + something), and the contribution of this day in those positions is the main reason they exceed M.\n\nBut this may not be the case. For example, multiple days could contribute to a_j's in [lo, hi], and removing one may not be sufficient. However, the code's approach seems to be that if the day's influence covers [lo, hi], then removing it will reduce all a_j's in that region by their contribution, which may bring them below M.\n\nBut the code's logic is that after removing the day i, the a_j's in [lo, hi] are a_j_original - (p_i - |x_i -j|). If the original a_j's in [lo, hi] were all greater than M, then subtracting (p_i - |x_i -j|) would make them a_j_original - (p_i - ... ). If (p_i - ...) >= a_j_original - M, then after subtraction, a_j becomes <= M.\n\nBut how to ensure that. The code's approach is that if the day's influence covers the entire [lo, hi], then the contribution of this day in [lo, hi] is at least (p_i - |x_i - j|). But since the original a_j's in [lo, hi] are > M, and the day's contribution is part of that sum, then subtracting it would reduce those a_j's by at least (p_i - ... ), which might be enough.\n\nBut this depends on the other days' contributions. For example, if multiple days contribute to a_j's in [lo, hi], removing one day may not be sufficient. However, the code's approach assumes that if the day's influence covers the entire problematic interval, then removing it will suffice.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, in the first test case, removing the third day's rain (which covers the problematic interval) is sufficient to prevent the flood. So this logic works there.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nSo the code's approach is:\n\n- Find the minimal lo and maximal hi such that there exists positions in [lo, hi] where a_j > M.\n\n- For each day i, if the day's influence [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i] covers [lo, hi], then removing this day's contribution will subtract (p_i - |x_i - j|) from all j in [lo, hi]. So the new a_j's in that interval will be a_j_original - (p_i - ... ). If the original a_j's were a_j_original = M + delta, then after subtracting (p_i - ... ), the new a_j is M + delta - (p_i - ... ). So if delta <= (p_i - ... ), then the new a_j is <= M.\n\nBut the code's approach is to assume that if the day's influence covers the entire problematic interval, then removing it will make all a_j's in that interval <= M. But how can we be sure of that?\n\nIt's possible that after removing the day's contribution, there's another day whose contribution is still making a_j's exceed M. So the code's approach may be incorrect. But according to the problem's note, in the first example, this approach works.\n\nSo perhaps the code's logic is correct, and the answer is to update lo and hi whenever the current value exceeds M. The missing code in the TODO section is to set lo to the minimum of lo and the previous position (cur_pos before the update), and hi to the maximum of hi and the current coords[i].first.\n\nWait, during the loop, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first after processing the interval. So the interval processed is [previous cur_pos, coords[i].first). So when cur_val exceeds M (after processing the interval), the interval [prev_pos, coords[i].first) has the value at coords[i].first being cur_val. But the maximum value in that interval depends on the slope. So if the code is checking if the current value (after the interval) is over M, then the interval where the value is over M is from some point in the interval to the end. For example, if the slope is positive and the value was below M at the start of the interval but exceeds M at the end. The entire interval may have a part that's over M.\n\nBut the code's approach is to track the minimal lo and maximal hi such that all intervals where the a_j exceeds M are within [lo, hi]. But how to compute lo and hi correctly.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to track all intervals where the a_j exceeds M, and then compute lo as the minimal start of such intervals and hi as the maximal end. So, whenever cur_val exceeds M, the entire interval from previous cur_pos to coords[i].first is considered problematic. So lo is the minimum between current lo and the previous cur_pos (the start of the interval), and hi is the maximum between current hi and coords[i].first (the end of the interval).\n\nBut how to get the previous cur_pos. Before processing coords[i], cur_pos is the previous position. After adding (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope to cur_val, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\nSo the interval processed in this step is [previous cur_pos, coords[i].first). So if cur_val (after the step) is over M, then the entire interval's value is over M. But that's only true if the value is non-decreasing in the interval. For example, if the slope is positive and the value increases from below to above M, then part of the interval is over M. But the code is assuming that the entire interval is problematic if the final value is over M.\n\nSo this approach may not capture all intervals where a_j exceeds M. But perhaps given time constraints, this is the best possible approach, and the code's answer is to update lo and hi with the previous cur_pos and current coords[i].first.\n\nSo the missing code would be:\n\nlo = min(lo, coords[i].first - (coords[i].first - cur_pos));\n\nWait, no. The previous cur_pos is the start of the interval. So when processing coords[i], the interval is [prev_cur_pos, coords[i].first). So prev_cur_pos is the start, coords[i].first is the end.\n\nSo when cur_val (the value at coords[i].first) is > M, the entire interval [prev_cur_pos, coords[i].first) is considered to have a_j > M. Therefore, in the TODO section, we need to update lo to the minimum of lo and prev_cur_pos, and hi to the maximum of hi and coords[i].first.\n\nBut how to get prev_cur_pos. Because before processing coords[i], cur_pos is prev_cur_pos, and then after processing, it's updated to coords[i].first. So in the code, after the line:\n\ncur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\ncur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\nSo, during the first iteration, the interval is from 0 (initial cur_pos) to coords[0].first. So if cur_val after this step is > M, then the interval [0, coords[0].first) is problematic. So lo would be min(INF, 0) which is 0, and hi would be max(-INF, coords[0].first) which is coords[0].first.\n\nBut how to get the previous cur_pos. Because after the line:\n\ncur_pos = coords[i].first;\n\nSo, during the step where we check if cur_val > M, the interval that was processed is [prev_cur_pos, coords[i].first). So prev_cur_pos is the original cur_pos before the addition.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nprev_cur_pos = cur_pos;\n\ncur_val += (coords[i].first - prev_cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\ncur_pos is set to coords[i].first.\n\nSo, during the check if (cur_val > M), the interval [prev_cur_pos, cur_pos) (which is coords[i].first) is the interval where the value at cur_pos is cur_val.\n\nSo if cur_val > M, then the entire interval [prev_cur_pos, cur_pos) has a value that is potentially above M. But this depends on the slope.\n\nBut the code's approach is to consider that if the value at the end of the interval is over M, then the entire interval is problematic. Which is not correct. But given that this is the code's approach, the missing code would be:\n\nlo = min(lo, prev_cur_pos);\nhi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\nSo for each interval where the current value is over M, the code assumes that the entire interval is problematic and updates lo and hi accordingly.\n\nBut how to get prev_cur_pos. Because before the code processes coords[i], cur_pos is prev_cur_pos. So during the processing of coords[i], the code adds (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope to cur_val. So prev_cur_pos is cur_pos before the update.\n\nTherefore, in the code, prev_cur_pos is the value of cur_pos before the update. So when we are in the loop iteration i, after the lines:\n\ncur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\ncur_pos = coords[i].first;\ncur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\nthen, the code checks if (cur_val > M). So the interval that was processed is [prev_cur_pos (which is the original cur_pos), coords[i].first (now cur_pos)].\n\nSo in the missing code, to track the interval, we need to take prev_cur_pos (original cur_pos) as the start, and coords[i].first as the end. \n\nThus, the code inside the if (cur_val > M) block should be:\n\nlo = min(lo, prev_cur_pos);\nhi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\nBut how to get prev_cur_pos. Because in the code, after processing, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\nSo inside the loop, before processing coords[i], cur_pos is the previous position. So in the code, during each iteration, the code calculates the contribution from the previous position to coords[i].first. So prev_cur_pos is the value of cur_pos before the first line in the loop iteration.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nfor (i from 0 to coords.size()-1):\n\n    // compute contribution from cur_pos to coords[i].first\n    cur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n    cur_pos = coords[i].first;\n    cur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\n    if (cur_val > M) {\n        // the interval is [old_cur_pos, coords[i].first)\n        lo = min(lo, old_cur_pos);\n        hi = max(hi, coords[i].first);\n    }\n\nBut old_cur_pos is the value of cur_pos before the line 'cur_val += ...', which is the original cur_pos.\n\nSo in code, old_cur_pos is the value before the update. But in the code, after the update, cur_pos becomes coords[i].first. So during the loop iteration, the old_cur_pos is stored in a variable, but in the code, we don't track it. So how to get it.\n\nWait, no. Let's step through the code:\n\nInitial state:\n\ncur_pos = 0 (for example)\n\nLoop iteration i=0:\n\ncur_val += (coords[0].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope; // here, cur_pos is 0\n\nThen, cur_pos is updated to coords[0].first.\n\nSo the interval processed is [0, coords[0].first).\n\nSo, during the check if (cur_val > M), the interval is [0, coords[0].first), and if cur_val (the value at coords[0].first) is over M, then the entire interval is considered problematic.\n\nBut how to track the start of the interval (0 in this case) and end (coords[0].first).\n\nBut in the code, after processing the line:\n\ncur_pos = coords[i].first;\n\nthe start of the interval is the previous cur_pos, which is stored in the variable before the update.\n\nSo inside the loop iteration, before the update, cur_pos is the start of the interval. So in the code:\n\nprev_cur_pos = cur_pos; // before processing coords[i]\n\ncur_val += (coords[i].first - prev_cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\ncur_pos = coords[i].first;\n\nSo prev_cur_pos is the start of the interval. But the code doesn't store this. So how to get it.\n\nWait, in the code, the current code for the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < int(coords.size()); i++) {\n    cur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n    cur_pos = coords[i].first;\n    cur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\n    if (cur_val > M) {\n        // need to update lo and hi\n        // the interval is [previous_cur_pos, current cur_pos)\n        // previous_cur_pos was the value before the first line of the loop iteration.\n        // So previous_cur_pos = cur_pos before the first line.\n        // But after the first line, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\n        // So during this iteration, the interval is [prev_cur_pos, coords[i].first)\n        // where prev_cur_pos is the original cur_pos before the first line.\n\n        // So in this case, prev_cur_pos is coords[i].first - (coords[i].first - cur_pos_original) ?\n        // No. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\n        // Before processing the current iteration, cur_pos is some value, say, A.\n\n        // Then, in the first line, we compute (coords[i].first - A) * cur_slope and add to cur_val.\n\n        // Then, cur_pos is set to coords[i].first.\n\n        // So the interval processed is [A, coords[i].first).\n\n        // So, if during this iteration, cur_val (the value at coords[i].first) is > M, then the interval [A, coords[i].first) is considered problematic.\n\n        // So in the missing code, lo is min(lo, A), hi is max(hi, coords[i].first).\n\n        // But how to get A, which is the original cur_pos before the first line of the loop iteration.\n\n        // In the code, after the first line, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\n        // So the original cur_pos is stored in a variable before the first line.\n\n        // But in the code, it's not stored. So there's a problem here.\n\n        // Therefore, the code is missing the tracking of the original cur_pos (A) to know the start of the interval.\n\n        // So the code's current approach cannot correctly compute the start of the interval.\n\n        // So this is a bug in the code. But the user provided this code, and we have to fill in the missing part.\n\n        // Given that the code is structured as such, perhaps the intended approach is to track the start of the interval (prev_cur_pos) as the original cur_pos before processing coords[i].\n\n        // But since the code doesn't track it, the code is incorrect.\n\n        // So, how to fix this?\n\n        // The code as written would have cur_pos updated to coords[i].first before the check. So in the check, cur_pos is coords[i].first.\n\n        // So the interval is [prev_cur_pos, cur_pos), where prev_cur_pos is the original cur_pos before the first line of the loop iteration.\n\n        // But in the code, after processing the first line, cur_pos is updated. So there's no way to retrieve prev_cur_pos.\n\n        // Therefore, the code is incorrect, and this is a bug. But how to proceed?\n\n        // Assuming that the code's author intended to track the start of the interval as cur_pos before the first line, but failed to store it.\n\n        // So, the correct code would require capturing the prev_cur_pos before the first line.\n\n        // So inside the loop:\n\n        // for each i:\n\n        // prev_cur_pos = cur_pos;\n\n        // cur_val += (coords[i].first - prev_cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\n        // cur_pos = coords[i].first;\n\n        // cur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\n        // if (cur_val > M) {\n\n        //     lo = min(lo, prev_cur_pos);\n\n        //     hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        // }\n\n        // But in the code provided, the first line of the loop is:\n\n        // cur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\n        // So prev_cur_pos is indeed cur_pos before the first line. So prev_cur_pos is cur_pos.\n\n        // So, in the loop, before the first line, cur_pos is the previous position, which is the start of the interval.\n\n        // Therefore, the start of the interval is stored in cur_pos before the first line of the loop iteration.\n\n        // But after the first line, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first.\n\n        // So, inside the loop iteration, the start of the interval is the original cur_pos, which is the value before the first line.\n\n        // So, to capture this, we need to save the original cur_pos before processing the first line.\n\n        // But the code as written does not do that.\n\n        // Therefore, the code has a bug. But the code provided in the problem does not save this value, making the code's logic incorrect.\n\n        // But since the user is asking us to fill in the missing code, perhaps the code's author intended that whenever cur_val > M, the current interval is from the previous cur_pos (before the first line) to coords[i].first.\n\n        // So the missing code should be:\n\n        lo = std::min(lo, cur_pos - (coords[i].first - cur_pos));  // No, this is not correct.\n\n        // Wait, no. The original cur_pos is the one before processing the current coords[i]. So during the first line of the loop iteration, cur_val is updated based on (coords[i].first - cur_pos_prev) * cur_slope, where cur_pos_prev is the value before processing this iteration.\n\n        // So, during the loop iteration, after the first line, cur_pos_prev is the start of the interval, coords[i].first is the end.\n\n        // So, to compute the interval, we need to use cur_pos_prev (start) and coords[i].first (end).\n\n        // But how to get cur_pos_prev. It's the value of cur_pos before the first line of the loop iteration.\n\n        // So, during the loop iteration, the code should store cur_pos_prev before the first line.\n\n        // So the code should be modified to:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < int(coords.size()); i++) {\n\n            int64_t prev_cur_pos = cur_pos;\n\n            cur_val += (coords[i].first - prev_cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\n            cur_pos = coords[i].first;\n\n            cur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\n            if (cur_val > M) {\n\n                lo = min(lo, prev_cur_pos);\n\n                hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        But in the code provided by the user, the loop is written as:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < int(coords.size()); i++) {\n\n            cur_val += (coords[i].first - cur_pos) * cur_slope;\n\n            cur_pos = coords[i].first;\n\n            cur_slope += coords[i].second;\n\n            if (cur_val > M) {\n\n                /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        So, in this code, the start of the interval is cur_pos before the first line. So, prev_cur_pos is the value of cur_pos before the first line of the loop iteration. So, during the first line of the loop iteration, (coords[i].first - cur_pos) is the distance from the previous cur_pos to coords[i].first.\n\n        So, the start of the interval is prev_cur_pos (cur_pos before the first line), and the end is coords[i].first (cur_pos after the first line).\n\n        So, in the missing code, we need to take prev_cur_pos and cur_pos as the start and end of the interval.\n\n        But in the code provided, prev_cur_pos is not stored. So how to get it.\n\n        Wait, in the code provided, after processing the first line of the loop iteration, cur_pos is updated to coords[i].first. So, during the check if (cur_val > M), cur_pos is now coords[i].first. But the start of the interval is the previous cur_pos (before processing the line).\n\n        So, the code cannot retrieve the start of the interval, because it's not stored. Therefore, the code is incorrect.\n\n        So, this is a bug in the code provided. But since the code is given and we have to fill in the missing part, perhaps the intended code is:\n\n        In the TODO section, the code should compute the interval from cur_pos (before processing coords[i]) to coords[i].first. But since cur_pos is now coords[i].first, how to get the previous value.\n\n        Therefore, the code's approach is incorrect, but perhaps the intended solution is to update lo and hi with coords[i].first (current pos) in both cases. But that's not correct.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the code's author intended to track the points where the value after processing the interval is over M, and then the interval is considered as [coords[i].first, coords[i].first + ...), but that doesn't make sense.\n\n        This is a tricky part. But given the code's structure, the missing code must be lo = min(lo, cur_pos) and hi = max(hi, cur_pos), but that would only capture the current position as the interval.\n\n        But that's incorrect because the interval is from prev_cur_pos to cur_pos.\n\n        Therefore, this suggests that the code is incorrect. But since this is the code provided, perhaps the intended answer is:\n\n        When cur_val > M, the code updates lo to be the minimum between lo and cur_pos (which is now coords[i].first), and hi to be the maximum between hi and cur_pos.\n\n        But that would capture only the current position, not the entire interval.\n\n        This would be incorrect. But perhaps the code's author intended to track the positions where the value is over M. But how?\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the code's author intended to track the minimal and maximal positions where the value exceeds M. So, whenever the current value exceeds M, the current position is part of the interval. But this would also be incorrect.\n\n        Given the confusion, perhaps the correct code to fill in is:\n\n        lo = std::min(lo, cur_pos - (coords[i].first - cur_pos));\n\n        Wait, no. Because cur_pos after the first line is coords[i].first. So, cur_pos - (coords[i].first - cur_pos) is 2*cur_pos - coords[i].first. That's not right.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the code's author intended to track all positions where the value is over M, and the lo and hi are the minimal and maximal positions among them.\n\n        But given the code's current structure, it's impossible to track individual positions. So perhaps the code's approach is to track the start and end of all intervals where the value is over M, and then set lo to the earliest start and hi to the latest end.\n\n        So, in the missing code, whenever cur_val > M, we need to set lo to the minimum between the current lo and the start of the interval (which is prev_cur_pos, which is not stored), and hi to the maximum between the current hi and the end of the interval (coords[i].first).\n\n        But since prev_cur_pos is not stored, it's impossible to get it. So the code is incorrect, but perhaps the author made a mistake and thought that cur_pos is the start of the interval, which is not the case.\n\n        Therefore, the code's approach is wrong, but according to the code, the missing part is:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        But this would set lo and hi to the current coords[i].first, which is the end of the interval. So lo would be the earliest coords[i].first where cur_val is over M, and hi the latest. But this would miss the start of the interval.\n\n        But according to the problem's sample input, this might not be sufficient. For example, in the first sample test case, the rain's contribution creates a peak in the middle. So the code's approach of checking the endpoints would not capture that the maximum is in the middle.\n\n        But given the code's structure and the time constraints, perhaps the intended answer is to update lo and hi to the previous cur_pos and current cur_pos (coords[i].first). But since prev_cur_pos is not stored, this is impossible.\n\n        Therefore, the code is incorrect, and the missing code cannot be filled in. But since this is a programming competition problem, perhaps there's another way.\n\n        Let's think differently. Suppose that during the line sweep, we are tracking the maximum value. The code's approach is to find the earliest and latest positions where the value exceeds M. But perhaps the code's initial approach is to track the entire interval where the value is over M, and compute lo as the earliest and hi as the latest.\n\n        If the code's current approach is incorrect in capturing the intervals, but the problem requires that the initial code's logic is correct, then the missing code must be:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos - (cur_val - M) / 1);\n\n        But I'm not sure.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the code's author intended to find the earliest and latest positions where the value exceeds M, and the missing code is to set lo to min(lo, coords[i].first) and hi to max(hi, coords[i].first). This would track all the points where the value is over M, and the final [lo, hi] would be the minimal and maximal positions where the value exceeds M. But this would only track individual points, not intervals.\n\n        But according to the problem's sample input, in the first test case, the third day's rain is erased. The day's influence is from x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i, which covers the entire problematic interval. So perhaps the code's lo is the minimal position where the a_j exceeds M, and hi is the maximal position.\n\n        So, during the line sweep, whenever the a_j exceeds M, the code updates lo to be the minimal position (i.e., the current position if it's smaller than lo) and hi to be the maximal position.\n\n        So, for example, if during the line sweep, the code finds positions where a_j exceeds M, and tracks the minimal and maximal such positions.\n\n        So, in that case, whenever cur_val > M (the value at coords[i].first), then coords[i].first is a position where a_j exceeds M. So the code should update lo and hi to include coords[i].first.\n\n        But this would only track positions at the coordinates where the slope changes, and not the intervals between them where a_j exceeds M.\n\n        But given the code's current setup, perhaps this is the intended approach.\n\n        So the missing code would be:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        Because cur_pos is now coords[i].first. So whenever the value at coords[i].first is over M, the code adds coords[i].first to the lo and hi.\n\n        So, after processing all coordinates, lo is the leftmost coordinate where a_j exceeds M, and hi is the rightmost. Then, for each day i, if the day's influence covers [lo, hi], then removing that day's contribution would subtract from all positions in [lo, hi], possibly bringing them below M.\n\n        But this is only correct if the maximum a_j's are at these points. For example, if the maximum a_j's are in between the coordinates, this approach will miss them.\n\n        But given the code's current structure, this is the only way to proceed.\n\n        So, the missing code is:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        This would track the leftmost and rightmost coordinates where the value after processing the interval is over M.\n\n        In the first test case, perhaps these coordinates form the boundaries of the problematic interval. So when the third day's influence covers them, removing it would reduce the a_j's in that interval.\n\n        So, the answer to fill in the TODO is:\n\n        lo = std::min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = std::max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        Because cur_pos is coords[i].first, and when cur_val > M, this position is considered part of the problematic region.\n\n        But this is incorrect in the general case. However, the code's author may have intended this.\n\n        So, according to the code's structure, the correct code to fill in the missing part is:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        Which in C++ would be:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        So the missing code is:\n\n        lo = std::min(lo, cur_pos);\n        hi = std::max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        But in the code, the variables lo and hi are initialized to INF and -INF. So, after the first occurrence of cur_val > M, lo will be set to cur_pos (coords[i].first), and hi to the same value. Subsequent checks will update lo and hi to track the minimum and maximum of such cur_pos values.\n\n        This would collect the leftmost and rightmost coordinates where a_j exceeds M. Then, for each day i, if the day's influence interval includes all such positions, then removing it would subtract its contribution from those positions. But this may not cover all positions in between. For example, if the problematic positions are a continuous interval, but the code's lo and hi are only the left and right endpoints, then the day's influence must cover this interval.\n\n        But how can the code's lo and hi capture the entire interval? It can't, unless the code's line sweep captures the entire interval. But given that the code is written as is, this is the intended approach.\n\n        So, the correct code to fill in is:\n\n        lo = min(lo, cur_pos);\n\n        hi = max(hi, cur_pos);\n\n        Therefore, the answer is to write these two lines in the TODO section."
