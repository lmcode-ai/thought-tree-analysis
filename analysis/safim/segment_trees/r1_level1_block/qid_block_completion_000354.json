The task is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be created using n wooden blocks. Each block is 1 unit high, and the length of the i-th block is the ceiling of i/2. So for i=1, it's 1, i=2 it's 1, i=3 is 2, i=4 is 2, i=5 is 3, etc. The square's side length is the minimum between the total area of the blocks and the sum of lengths in a way that the total area is at least s^2 (since each block contributes area equal to their length times 1, so sum of lengths >= s^2). Wait, no, the square's side is s, so the area needed is s*s. Each block contributes 1 * length units of area. So the sum of all selected blocks' lengths must be >= s\u00b2. But the maximum possible s is the largest s where sum of some subset of the blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2. But how do we model this? The problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of lengths of the blocks (possibly a subset) is >= s\u00b2. But since we can choose any subset, the optimal is to take as many blocks as possible, but in this problem, perhaps all the blocks are used?",

So the problem reduces to compute the sum of all the blocks' lengths up to n, then find the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= total_sum. So first, compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks. Then find the maximum s where s^2 \u2264 sum. So how to compute the sum of the first n blocks' lengths? Let's see. For each i from 1 to n, the length is ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for the sum. For even i: i = 2k. ceil(2k/2) = k. So for even i, the length is k. For odd i: i = 2k-1. ceil((2k-1)/2) = k. So for odd i, it's k. So let's split into even and odd numbers.",

Each pair (2k-1, 2k) has lengths k and k. So each pair contributes 2k. So for n even, there are n/2 pairs. The sum is sum_{k=1 to n/2} (k + k) = sum_{k=1 to n/2} 2k = 2 * sum_{k=1 to m} k where m is n/2. Sum of first m integers is m(m+1)/2. So sum is 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). So when n is even, sum = m(m+1) where m = n/2. Wait, let's check with n=2. m=1. sum is 1+1 = 2. m(m+1) = 1*2=2. Correct. For n=4, the pairs are (1,2) sum 1+1=2, (3,4) sum 2+2=4. Total 6. m=4/2=2. 2*3=6. Correct. If n is odd, then n=2m-1. Then, for the first 2m-2 numbers (even), the sum is (m-1)*m). Then the last number (2m-1) has ceil((2m-1)/2) = m. So total sum is (m-1)*m + m = m(m-1 + 1) = m^2. So for n odd, sum is m^2 where m = (n+1)/2. Wait example: n=3. m=(3+1)/2=2. sum is (1+1)+(2) \u2192 sum is 2+2=4, which is 2^2. Correct. n=5: sum is (1+1)+(2+2)+3 \u2192 2+4+3=9, which is 3\u00b2. Correct. So sum can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nWait, no. Let me check for n=1 (odd). m=(1+1)/2=1. sum is 1\u00b2=1. Correct. n=5: 3\u00b2=9. Correct. So sum for even n is (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) \u2192 which is (m)(m+1) where m = n/2. Now, the total sum is S. We need to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 S. So the problem reduces to compute S, then compute the integer square root of S, i.e., the largest integer s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input where n=5 (sum is 9), s is 3. Which matches the sample. For n=6 (even), sum is (6/2)*(6/2 +1) =3*4=12. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(12))=3, since 3\u00b2=9<=12, 4\u00b2=16>12. So answer is 3. Another example: n=2. sum=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414. So 1. Wait, the first test case in the note says when n=1, the answer is 1. Which is correct. For n=1, sum is 1, s=1. Second test case in the note: n=5, answer is 3. Which is correct. So the steps are:\n\n1. Compute S based on n being even or odd. 2.",

So sqrt(S) is exactly (n+1)/2. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct. So for n odd, the sum S is ((n+1)/2)^2. So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Which is indeed n/2 +1 when n is odd. Because for n=5: 5/2=2 in integer division, 2+1=3. So the code's else clause is correct. For even n, we need to compute S = m*(m+1), where m = n/2. Then compute s as the integer part of sqrt(m*(m+1)). Wait, but m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. For example, m=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is about 3.464. So the integer part is 3. So s=3. So how to compute s for even n?\n\nWe can compute s as the floor of sqrt(S). But how? Alternatively, we can find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= S.\n\nSo for even n:\n\nS = m*(m+1) where m = n/2. We can model this as solving s^2 <= m(m+1). Find maximum s.\n\nBut m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is approx m + 0.5*sqrt(4m +1) - 0.5. But perhaps there's a pattern here. Alternatively, let's note that m\u00b2 + m < (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 +2m +1. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So the floor is either m or m.\n\nWait, let's compute for m=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. Which is m.\n\nm=2: 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.45 \u2192 floor 2. Which is m.\n\nm=1: 1*2=2 \u2192 floor 1. m=1. So in all cases, s for even n is the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)) which is m.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see m=3: 3*4=12, sqrt(12) is 3.464, floor is 3. Which is m. So s = floor(sqrt(m*(m+1))) = m when m*(m+1) >= m\u00b2 \u2192 which it is. So sqrt(m*(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor is m.\n\nWait, no. Let me check for m=3: sqrt(12) is approx 3.464, so floor is 3. Which is m. For m=4: 4*5=20. sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor 4. So yes, s is m.\n\nWait, but wait: if m(m+1) is a perfect square, then s would be the exact sqrt. Otherwise, it's m.\n\nBut m(m+1) is a product of two consecutive integers. The only time this is a perfect square is when m=0 (0*1=0). So for m >=1, m(m+1) is not a perfect square. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is not integer, so floor is m.\n\nWait, is that true? For example, m=0: 0*1=0. sqrt is 0.\n\nm=1: 1*2=2 \u2192 sqrt ~1.414 \u2192 floor 1.\n\nm=2: 6 \u2192 sqrt ~2.45 \u2192 floor 2.\n\nm=3: 12 \u2192 sqrt ~3.464 \u2192 floor 3. So yes, for m >=1, floor of sqrt(m(m+1)) is m. So for even n, when we have S = m*(m+1), then s is m.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Let's take m=3, S=12. s is 3. So s\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So correct. So for even n, the answer is m.\n\nWait, but m is n/2. So for even n, the code needs to output m. But wait, the code currently for even n is a TODO. So in the code, for even n, the code would compute m = n/2, and then compute s = floor(sqrt(m*(m+1))). But as per our analysis, this s is m.\n\nBut wait, m*(m+1) is the sum. So the maximum s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1))). Which for m >=1 is m. Because m\u00b2 < m(m+1) < (m+1)^2. So s is m. But then, for even n, the answer is m, which is n/2. Wait, for even n=6: m=3. sum is 12. s is 3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes. But wait, sum is 12. So s is 3. So 3 is the maximum. But 3 is equal to m. So for even n, the answer is m. But wait, for even n=2: m=1. sum is 2. s is 1. Which is m.\n\nYes. So for even n, the answer is m = n/2. But wait, let's see. Suppose n=4. sum is 2*3=6. The maximum s is 2, since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6. So answer is 2, which is m=4/2=2. Correct. n=6: m=3, answer 3. Correct. So for even n, the answer is m = n/2. Wait, but why? Because the sum is m(m+1). The square root is sqrt(m^2 +m), which is slightly larger than m. So the floor is m. So the maximum s is m. So for even n, the answer is m = n/2. So for even n, the code can simply compute m = n/2, and output m.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let's see for m=3: sum=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. Correct. Yes, that works. But wait, sum is 12. s can be 3. But 12 >= 3\u00b2 (9) and 12 <4\u00b2. So yes. But the sum is 12, which allows for s=3. Because 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So the answer is 3. So the answer for even n is m. So the code for even n should output m = n/2. Wait, but that's only true if m(m+1) >= m\u00b2. Which it is, but how to confirm that. Wait, for even n, the code's else clause handles the odd case. The code's current structure is:\n\nif(n is even) {\n   // compute even case\n} else {\n   System.out.println(n/2 +1);\n} So for even n, the code must compute the maximum s. According to the analysis, s is m = n/2. Wait, but let's test with even n=2:\n\nsum is m*(m+1) where m=1. sum is 2. s is 1. Which is m=1. Yes. So for even n, the code should output m = n/2. But wait, what about n=4? sum is 2*3=6. s is 2. Which is m=2. Yes. But wait, sum is 6, which allows for s=2 (since 2\u00b2=4 <=6). So correct. But in the sample input where n=5 (odd), the code outputs 3. Which is correct. But for even n=6, the code would output 3. Wait, but according to the problem statement, when n=5, the answer is 3. So the code for even n=6 would output 3, which is correct. So the code for even n can be simply outputting m = n/2. But why is that the case?",

The maximum s is 3, which is sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. So output 3. Which is n/2=3. Correct. Another example: n=4. sum=6. s=2. sqrt(6)=2.449. So floor is 2. Which is 4/2=2. Correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be created using n wooden blocks. Each block is 1 unit high, and the length of the i-th block is the ceiling of i/2. So for i=1, it's 1, i=2 it's 1, i=3 is 2, i=4 is 2, i=5 is 3, etc. The square's side length is the minimum between the total area of the blocks and the sum of lengths in a way that the total area is at least s^2 (since each block contributes area equal to their length times 1, so sum of lengths >= s^2). Wait, no, the square's side is s, so the area needed is s*s. Each block contributes 1 * length units of area. So the sum of all selected blocks' lengths must be >= s\u00b2. But the maximum possible s is the largest s where sum of some subset of the blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2.\n\nBut how do we model this? The problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of lengths of the blocks (possibly a subset) is >= s\u00b2. But since we can choose any subset, the optimal is to take as many blocks as possible, but in this problem, perhaps all the blocks are used? Wait, the problem says you can use any subset. But since the sum of all blocks' lengths would be the largest possible, the maximum s is determined by the total sum of all the blocks. Because taking all blocks gives the maximum possible sum. So, the maximum possible s is the largest integer s where total_sum >= s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to compute the sum of all the blocks' lengths up to n, then find the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= total_sum.\n\nSo first, compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks. Then find the maximum s where s^2 \u2264 sum.\n\nSo how to compute the sum of the first n blocks' lengths?\n\nLet's see. For each i from 1 to n, the length is ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for the sum.\n\nFor even i: i = 2k. ceil(2k/2) = k. So for even i, the length is k.\n\nFor odd i: i = 2k-1. ceil((2k-1)/2) = k. So for odd i, it's k.\n\nSo let's split into even and odd numbers.\n\nFor numbers 1 to n:\n\nIf n is even:\n\nNumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n.\n\nThe sum is sum for each i from 1 to n of ceil(i/2).\n\nLet's split into pairs. Each pair (2k-1, 2k) has lengths k and k. So each pair contributes 2k. So for n even, there are n/2 pairs. The sum is sum_{k=1 to n/2} (k + k) = sum_{k=1 to n/2} 2k = 2 * sum_{k=1 to m} k where m is n/2. Sum of first m integers is m(m+1)/2. So sum is 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). So when n is even, sum = m(m+1) where m = n/2.\n\nWait, let's check with n=2. m=1. sum is 1+1 = 2. m(m+1) = 1*2=2. Correct. For n=4, the pairs are (1,2) sum 1+1=2, (3,4) sum 2+2=4. Total 6. m=4/2=2. 2*3=6. Correct.\n\nIf n is odd, then n=2m-1. Then, for the first 2m-2 numbers (even), the sum is (m-1)*m). Then the last number (2m-1) has ceil((2m-1)/2) = m. So total sum is (m-1)*m + m = m(m-1 + 1) = m^2. So for n odd, sum is m^2 where m = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait example: n=3. m=(3+1)/2=2. sum is (1+1)+(2) \u2192 sum is 2+2=4, which is 2^2. Correct. n=5: sum is (1+1)+(2+2)+3 \u2192 2+4+3=9, which is 3\u00b2. Correct.\n\nSo sum can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nWait, no. Let me check for n=1 (odd). m=(1+1)/2=1. sum is 1\u00b2=1. Correct.\n\nn=5: 3\u00b2=9. Correct.\n\nSo sum for even n is (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) \u2192 which is (m)(m+1) where m = n/2.\n\nNow, the total sum is S. We need to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 S.\n\nSo the problem reduces to compute S, then compute the integer square root of S, i.e., the largest integer s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input where n=5 (sum is 9), s is 3. Which matches the sample. For n=6 (even), sum is (6/2)*(6/2 +1) =3*4=12. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(12))=3, since 3\u00b2=9<=12, 4\u00b2=16>12. So answer is 3.\n\nAnother example: n=2. sum=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414. So 1.\n\nWait, the first test case in the note says when n=1, the answer is 1. Which is correct. For n=1, sum is 1, s=1.\n\nSecond test case in the note: n=5, answer is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute S based on n being even or odd.\n\n2. Compute the integer square root of S. That's the maximum s.\n\nSo the code needs to compute S, then compute the floor of sqrt(S).\n\nBut how to compute S for even and odd n?\n\nLet's code that.\n\nFirst, in the code provided, when n is even, there's a TODO. When n is odd, the code outputs (n/2 +1). Wait, let's see: for n=5 (odd), the code outputs 5/2 (which is 2 in integer division) +1 =3. Which is correct. But that's the code for the else clause. Wait, but according to our analysis, when n is odd, the sum is ((n+1)/2)^2. Then the maximum s is sqrt(S) which would be (n+1)/2. Because S is ((n+1)/2)^2. So sqrt(S) is exactly (n+1)/2. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for n odd, the sum S is ((n+1)/2)^2. So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Which is indeed n/2 +1 when n is odd. Because for n=5: 5/2=2 in integer division, 2+1=3.\n\nSo the code's else clause is correct. For even n, we need to compute S = m*(m+1), where m = n/2. Then compute s as the integer part of sqrt(m*(m+1)).\n\nWait, but m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. For example, m=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is about 3.464. So the integer part is 3. So s=3.\n\nSo how to compute s for even n?\n\nWe can compute s as the floor of sqrt(S). But how?\n\nAlternatively, we can find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= S.\n\nSo for even n:\n\nS = m*(m+1) where m = n/2.\n\nWe can model this as solving s^2 <= m(m+1). Find maximum s.\n\nBut m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is approx m + 0.5*sqrt(4m +1) - 0.5. But perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that m\u00b2 + m < (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 +2m +1. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So the floor is either m or m.\n\nWait, let's compute for m=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. Which is m.\n\nm=2: 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.45 \u2192 floor 2. Which is m.\n\nm=1: 1*2=2 \u2192 floor 1. m=1.\n\nSo in all cases, s for even n is the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)) which is m.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see m=3: 3*4=12, sqrt(12) is 3.464, floor is 3. Which is m.\n\nSo s = floor(sqrt(m*(m+1))) = m when m*(m+1) >= m\u00b2 \u2192 which it is. So sqrt(m*(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor is m.\n\nWait, no. Let me check for m=3: sqrt(12) is approx 3.464, so floor is 3. Which is m. For m=4: 4*5=20. sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor 4. So yes, s is m.\n\nWait, but wait: if m(m+1) is a perfect square, then s would be the exact sqrt. Otherwise, it's m.\n\nBut m(m+1) is a product of two consecutive integers. The only time this is a perfect square is when m=0 (0*1=0). So for m >=1, m(m+1) is not a perfect square. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is not integer, so floor is m.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nFor example, m=0: 0*1=0. sqrt is 0.\n\nm=1: 1*2=2 \u2192 sqrt ~1.414 \u2192 floor 1.\n\nm=2: 6 \u2192 sqrt ~2.45 \u2192 floor 2.\n\nm=3: 12 \u2192 sqrt ~3.464 \u2192 floor 3.\n\nSo yes, for m >=1, floor of sqrt(m(m+1)) is m.\n\nSo for even n, when we have S = m*(m+1), then s is m.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Let's take m=3, S=12. s is 3. So s\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So correct. So for even n, the answer is m.\n\nWait, but m is n/2. So for even n, the code needs to output m. But wait, the code currently for even n is a TODO. So in the code, for even n, the code would compute m = n/2, and then compute s = floor(sqrt(m*(m+1))). But as per our analysis, this s is m.\n\nBut wait, m*(m+1) is the sum. So the maximum s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1))). Which for m >=1 is m. Because m\u00b2 < m(m+1) < (m+1)^2.\n\nSo s is m.\n\nBut then, for even n, the answer is m, which is n/2.\n\nWait, for even n=6: m=3. sum is 12. s is 3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes.\n\nBut wait, sum is 12. So s is 3. So 3 is the maximum. But 3 is equal to m. So for even n, the answer is m.\n\nBut wait, for even n=2: m=1. sum is 2. s is 1. Which is m.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for even n, the answer is m = n/2.\n\nBut wait, let's see. Suppose n=4. sum is 2*3=6. The maximum s is 2, since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6. So answer is 2, which is m=4/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=6: m=3, answer 3. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, the answer is m = n/2.\n\nWait, but why? Because the sum is m(m+1). The square root is sqrt(m^2 +m), which is slightly larger than m. So the floor is m. So the maximum s is m.\n\nSo for even n, the answer is m = n/2.\n\nSo for even n, the code can simply compute m = n/2, and output m.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nLet's see for m=3: sum=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. Correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nBut wait, sum is 12. s can be 3. But 12 >= 3\u00b2 (9) and 12 <4\u00b2. So yes.\n\nBut the sum is 12, which allows for s=3. Because 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the answer for even n is m.\n\nSo the code for even n should output m = n/2.\n\nWait, but that's only true if m(m+1) >= m\u00b2. Which it is, but how to confirm that.\n\nWait, for even n, the code's else clause handles the odd case. The code's current structure is:\n\nif(n is even) {\n   // compute even case\n} else {\n   System.out.println(n/2 +1);\n}\n\nSo for even n, the code must compute the maximum s. According to the analysis, s is m = n/2.\n\nWait, but let's test with even n=2:\n\nsum is m*(m+1) where m=1. sum is 2. s is 1. Which is m=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for even n, the code should output m = n/2.\n\nBut wait, what about n=4? sum is 2*3=6. s is 2. Which is m=2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, sum is 6, which allows for s=2 (since 2\u00b2=4 <=6). So correct.\n\nBut in the sample input where n=5 (odd), the code outputs 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut for even n=6, the code would output 3.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, when n=5, the answer is 3. So the code for even n=6 would output 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code for even n can be simply outputting m = n/2.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the sum for even n is m(m+1), and the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(m(m+1)), which is m.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nBecause m(m+1) is m\u00b2 +m. The sqrt of that is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) = m * sqrt(1 + 1/m). As m increases, sqrt(1+1/m) approaches 1 + 1/(2m) - 1/(8m\u00b2) etc. So for m>=1, sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is less than m+1. So the integer part is m.\n\nSo, for even n, the maximum s is m = n/2.\n\nSo the code for even n can be:\n\nSystem.out.println(n/2);\n\nBut wait, what about n=2:\n\nsum is 1*2=2. s^2 must be <=2. So s=1. Which is 2/2=1. Correct.\n\nn=4: sum 2*3=6. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=6: sum 3*4=12 \u2192 s=3. Correct.\n\nBut let's check n=6, sum 12. s can be 3, because 3\u00b2=9 <=12, 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes.\n\nSo the code for even n is to output n/2.\n\nBut wait, let's check when sum is m(m+1) and m is even. For example, m=2: sum is 6. s=2. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, the code should output n/2.\n\nBut why is the code for even n not doing that? Because in the current code, when n is even, the code is missing (the TODO part). So the user needs to fill in the code for even case.\n\nSo the correct code for even n is to output n/2. But wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The answer for even n is n/2? That's possible.\n\nBut let's take an example where even n is 5: but wait, n can't be even. Wait, in the sample input when n=5, the answer is 3. Because sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So code for odd n outputs (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, in the code's else clause (when n is odd), it's outputting n/2 +1. Which for n=5, 5/2 is 2 in integer division, adding 1 gives 3.\n\nSo code for even n is when n is even, the code should output n/2.\n\nBut wait, no. Let's take another example.\n\nSuppose n=6 (even). sum is 3*4=12. The maximum s is 3, which is sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. So output 3. Which is n/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. sum=6. s=2. sqrt(6)=2.449. So floor is 2. Which is 4/2=2. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, outputting n/2 gives the correct s.\n\nThus, the code for even case should be:\n\nSystem.out.println(n / 2);\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause sum for even n is m*(m+1) where m =n/2. s is floor(sqrt(m*(m+1))). But since sqrt(m*(m+1)) is between m and m+1, floor is m. So s =m. So yes, for even n, output m= n/2.\n\nTherefore, the code's TODO part for even n is to print n/2.\n\nSo the complete code would be:\n\nif (n % 2 == 0) {\n    System.out.println(n / 2);\n} else {\n    System.out.println(n / 2 + 1);\n}\n\nWait, but according to our analysis, that's correct. Let's see for n=5 (odd), output is 3, which is correct. For even n=6, output is 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but what if sum is m*(m+1) for even n. For example, n=6, sum is 3*4=12. The maximum s is 3. Because 3\u00b2=9 \u226412, and 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes.\n\nBut wait, 12 is bigger than 9. So why can't we have a square of size 3.46 (but since we need integer s). So the maximum is 3.\n\nThus, the code for even n is correct.\n\nBut let's think again. Suppose n=7 (odd). sum is ((7+1)/2)^2=4\u00b2=16. So s is 4. Correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=2 (even). sum is 1*2=2. s is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let's take another example. Let's say n=8 (even). sum is 4*5=20. s is 4. Because 4\u00b2=16 <=20. 5\u00b2=25>20. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nSo the missing code for the even case is to print n divided by 2.\n\nThus, the code to fill in is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n/2);\n\nBut in Java, when n is even, integer division by 2 will give the correct m.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif(n%2 ==0){\n    System.out.println(n/2);\n}\n\nThus, the code for the even case is simply outputting n/2.\n\nSo the answer is to add that line.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n/2);"
