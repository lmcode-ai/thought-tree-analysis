Looking at the code structure, the solution processes each test case. The code seems to track the current sum and uses a frequency map to count how often each sum occurs. The key part is when a zero is encountered in the array. Let's break down what the code does step by step. When val is zero, there's a block that checks if leadingZero is true. If it is, then the code inside the TODO block runs. Otherwise, it adds the frequency of zero to ans and sets leadingZero to true. Then, maxFreq is reset and the frequency map is cleared.",

Then, by replacing the current zero with X = -S, the sum up to the current zero becomes S + X = 0. However, each occurrence of S in the prefix sums corresponds to a prefix in the segment where the sum up to that position is S. So, when the current zero is set to X = -S, the sum up to the current zero is zero. But also, each of the positions in the segment where the sum was S would have their sum plus X equal to zero. Wait, no. Because the sum up to the current zero is S + X. So, if S is the sum of the segment up to j-1, then X = -S makes the sum up to j zero. But how does this affect the prefixes within the segment? Wait, the segments are processed as follows. After each original zero (except the first), the code accumulates the maximum frequency of the current segment.

But the code is adding the maximum frequency, which suggests that perhaps there's a way to get more occurrences. Ah! Oh right, because each occurrence of a sum S in the segment can be turned into a point where the sum up to that position in the segment is S. Then, by choosing the zero at the end of the segment to be -S, the sum up to that zero becomes S + (-S) = 0. But this would only contribute one to the answer.

We can choose X to be any value. If we choose X = -S3, then the sum up to the zero becomes zero. This gives one point.

Otherwise, add the count of sum zero in the entire array. Wait, but why would the maximum frequency of the segment contribute to the answer? Let's think of a segment between two zeros. Let's say the original array is [0, a, b, 0, c, d, 0]. The first segment is [a, b], and the second is [c, d]. For each of these segments, we track the prefix sums. For the first segment (a, b), the sum after a is S1 = a, after b is S2 = a + b. The frequencies of S1 and S2 are tracked. The maximum frequency is say, 2 (if S1 and S2 are the same). Then, when replacing the zero after the segment with X = -S_max (the sum with maximum frequency), then the sum up to that zero becomes S_max + X = 0, contributing one to the answer. But how does that relate to the frequency? Ah! Oh right, perhaps each occurrence of S_max in the segment's prefix sums can be turned into a zero. Wait, no. Because the sum up to that point (in the segment) would be S_max. If the zero is set to -S_max, then the sum up to the zero is S_max + (-S_max) = 0, which is one occurrence. But how does the frequency of S_max in the segment's prefix sums lead to multiple zeros? Wait, maybe the code is considering that when you replace the zero with X, the sum up to that zero is zero.",

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. For example, if the segment is [a, b], and the prefix sums are a, a+b. Suppose the maximum frequency is for a (frequency 1). Replacing the zero after b with -a would make the sum up to that zero equal to a + b + (-a) = b. If the sum is to be zero, then that's not the case. So maybe this approach is incorrect. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let's refer back to the example in the problem statement. In the first test case, the input array is [2, 0, 1, -1, 0]. The optimal solution is to replace the second element (0) with -2, leading to [2, -2, 1, -1, 0]. The score is 3. The prefixes that sum to zero are:\n\n- index 2: 2 + (-2) = 0.\n- index 4: sum up to 4 is 0.\n- index 5: sum up to 5 is 0. But according to the code's logic, let's see:\n\nThe array is split into segments. The first zero is at index 1 (element 0). So the first segment is [2], with sum 2.",

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect. Let's take the example from the problem. In the first test case, the array is [2, 0, 1, -1, 0]. The code would process each element:\n\nFirst element: 2. val is not zero. currentSum += 2. freqs now has 2:1. maxFreq is 1. Second element: 0. val is zero. leadingZero is false. So ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0, 0) \u2192 0. leadingZero becomes true. Then, maxFreq is reset to 0, freqs cleared. Then, val (0) is added to currentSum. So currentSum is 0+0=0. Then, the code increments freq for currentSum (0) to 1. maxFreq is 1. Third element: 1. val is not zero. currentSum +=1 \u21921. freqs has 0:1 (from previous step?), wait no. Let's retrace:\n\nAfter processing the second element (zero): After handling the zero, leadingZero is set to true. Then, the code clears freqs and resets maxFreq. Then, after the if (val ==0) block, val (0) is added to currentSum. So currentSum was zero before (after adding the first element 2 and then zero). Wait, no. Let me re-trace: Wait, the code's variables are initialized as currentSum = 0. Then, for each element:\n\ni=0: val=2. not zero. currentSum += 2 \u21922. add to freqs: 2:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=1: val=0. zero. leadingZero is false. ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0, 0) \u21920. leadingZero becomes true. maxFreq reset to 0, freqs cleared. Then, currentSum +=0 \u21920+0=0. So currentSum is now 0. Then, in the code after the if block, the code adds val to currentSum. Wait, wait no. The code is:\n\nif (val == 0L) {\n   ... handle zero ...\n}\ncurrentSum += val; So, after the if block, val is added to currentSum. So for val=0 (i=1), currentSum was 2 (from previous steps).

So the code's logic must treat the original zeros as points where the sum up to that point can be adjusted. But according to the code's current structure, the sum includes the original zero. For example, in the first test case, the first zero is processed. Then, the code adds 0 (val) to currentSum, which is 2 + 0 = 2. Then, the code adds this to the frequency map, which now has 2:1. So the sum up to the first zero is 2 (currentSum after adding val=0). But that's not correct, because the original zero is part of the array. So the code's approach seems to include the original zeros in the sum, but they can be modified. This seems wrong. Ah! Here's the problem.",

The score is 3. The code's output for this case should be 3. Let's step through the code's execution for this test case. n=5, array [2,0,1,-1,0]. Processing each element:\n\ni=0, val=2. Not zero. currentSum +=2 \u21922. freqs now has 2:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=1, val=0. Zero. leadingZero is false. So ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0L,0) \u21920. leadingZero becomes true. Then, maxFreq=0, freqs cleared. Then, currentSum +=0 \u21922+0=2. freqs.put(2, 1). maxFreq=1.\n\ni=2, val=1. Not zero. currentSum +=1 \u21923. freqs has 3:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=3, val=-1. Not zero. currentSum +=-1 \u21922. freqs has 2:1 (existing 2's count was 1 from i=1). Now 2's count is 2. So freq=2. maxFreq becomes 2.\n\ni=4, val=0. Zero. leadingZero is true. So enter the TODO block. Then, maxFreq is reset to 0, freqs cleared. currentSum +=0 \u21922+0=2. freqs.put(2, 1). maxFreq=1. After processing all elements, leadingZero is true. So ans += maxFreq (which is 1). Total ans is 0 (from first zero) + 2 (from the TODO block?) Wait, no. Let's track ans step by step. Initial ans is 0.\n\ni=1 (val=0): leadingZero is false. ans +=0 \u2192ans=0. leadingZero becomes true. Then, after adding val to currentSum, freqs.put(2,1). maxFreq=1.\n\ni=2: val=1. currentSum=3. freqs has 3:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=3: val=-1. currentSum=2. freqs has 2:2 (since after i=1, currentSum was 2, and now it's 2 again). So freq is 2. maxFreq=2.\n\ni=4: val=0. leadingZero is true. So enter TODO block. The code here needs to add the maxFreq (which is 2) to ans. So ans increases by 2 \u2192 ans=0+2=2. Then, maxFreq is reset to 0, freqs cleared. currentSum +=0 \u21922+0=2. freqs.put(2,1). maxFreq=1. After the loop ends, leadingZero is true. So ans += maxFreq (1) \u2192 ans=2+1=3. Which matches the example's answer. So in the TODO block, we should add the maxFreq (which is 2) to ans. This comes from the segment between the first zero (i=1) and the current zero (i=4). The maxFreq for this segment is 2. So the code for the TODO block should be adding ans += maxFreq. So the missing code is ans += maxFreq;\n\nTherefore, in the TODO part, when val is zero and leadingZero is true, the code should add the current maxFreq to ans. So the line to add is ans += maxFreq;. Let me check another example. The second test case in the problem statement:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0]. Output: 3. Wait, no.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what code to add in the TODO part of the given Java code. Let's read the problem statement again to understand what's going on.\n\nThe problem is about maximizing the score of an array after performing certain operations. The score counts how many prefixes sum to zero. The operations allowed are replacing any zero in the array with any integer. So the idea is to manipulate those zeros to maximize the number of prefix sums that are zero.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the solution processes each test case. The code seems to track the current sum and uses a frequency map to count how often each sum occurs. The key part is when a zero is encountered in the array. Let's break down what the code does step by step.\n\nWhen val is zero, there's a block that checks if leadingZero is true. If it is, then the code inside the TODO block runs. Otherwise, it adds the frequency of zero to ans and sets leadingZero to true. Then, maxFreq is reset and the frequency map is cleared.\n\nThe variables involved are:\n- ans: the answer being accumulated.\n- maxFreq: the maximum frequency of a sum in the current segment.\n- freqs: a map tracking how many times each sum has occurred.\n- currentSum: the running sum of the current segment.\n\nWait, I think the code is handling the array in segments separated by zeros. Because whenever a zero is found, they process the previous segment. The idea is that each zero in the original array (before any operations) can be turned into a value that allows us to create as many prefix sums as possible. But how?\n\nLet me think. When we encounter a zero in the original array, we can replace it with any value. However, this allows us to split the array into segments. For example, if there's a zero at position i, we can choose a value such that the sum up to i is zero, which would count towards the score. But then, the next segment starts from i+1.\n\nBut the code's approach is to split the array into segments separated by the original zeros. Each of these segments (except possibly the first) can be adjusted by replacing the zero with a value that allows us to maximize the number of times the sum reaches zero in that segment.\n\nWait, here's the key insight. Each original zero in the array (before any operations) can be a point where the sum up to that index is zero. But since we can change the zero to any value, including one that would make the prefix sum up to that index zero, but perhaps even better, we can split the array into segments between these zeros. For each such segment (except the first), the maximum possible contributions are determined by the maximum frequency of a prefix sum in that segment. Because we can adjust the zero at the end of the segment (the original zero) to make the sum up to that point equal to the sum that occurred the most in the segment. Then, the number of times that sum occurs would be the number of times a prefix sum equals that sum, leading to a contribution to the total ans.\n\nSo, for each original zero (except the first one), when we process it, we add the maximum frequency of the sum in the current segment. Then, we reset the frequency map and maxFreq for the next segment.\n\nThe initial code seems to handle the first zero correctly. For the first zero, leadingZero is false, so it adds the frequency of zero (the sum before that zero) to the answer. Then, for subsequent zeros (when leadingZero is true), the code needs to add the maximum frequency from the current segment.\n\nSo, in the TODO part, which is when we encounter a zero and leadingZero is already true (meaning it's not the first zero), we should add the maxFreq to the answer. But wait, in the code, after encountering a zero, the code does:\n\nif (leadingZero) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n} else {\n    ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0L, 0);\n    leadingZero = true;\n}\nmaxFreq = 0;\nfreqs.clear();\n\nSo, for each zero after the first, when leadingZero is true, the code needs to add the maxFreq of the current segment. Because the maxFreq represents the maximum number of times a sum occurred in that segment. By replacing the current zero with a value that sets the sum to that most frequent sum, we can create maxFreq instances where the sum up to that index is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the current segment (from the start of the segment up to just before the zero) would have a certain sum. The maxFreq is the maximum number of times any sum occurs in that segment. By setting the zero to a value that makes the entire sum up to the zero equal to zero, but that's the sum of the current segment. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the current segment starts after a zero (the previous zero) and ends at the current zero. For example, the array is [ ... 0, ... elements ..., 0 ... ]. The first zero is processed, leadingZero becomes true. Then, the elements between the first zero and the second zero form a segment. For this segment, we track the prefix sums. The maxFreq is the maximum number of times a sum occurs in this segment. When we reach the current zero (the second one), we can choose to replace it with a value such that the sum up to this zero is equal to the sum that occurred maxFreq times. Then, each occurrence of that sum in the segment would correspond to a prefix sum that, when added to the modified zero, makes the total sum zero. Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nThe idea is that between two original zeros (say, positions i and j), we can compute the prefix sums. The sum up to j-1 is S. By replacing the zero at j with a value X, the sum up to j becomes S + X. We want this sum to be zero, so X = -S. However, when processing the segment between the previous zero (i) and current zero (j), the prefix sums are computed starting from i+1. So, each prefix sum in this segment (from i+1 to j-1) would be added to the sum of the previous segments. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the way the code is structured, when a zero is encountered, the code processes the current segment, adds to ans, and then starts a new segment.\n\nWait, here's how the code works:\n\nThe array is processed element by element. For each element, if it's a zero, the code enters a block. The leadingZero variable is a flag indicating whether a zero has been processed before (i.e., we are in a segment after the first zero).\n\nFor the first zero encountered (leadingZero is false), the code adds the frequency of sum zero to ans. Because the sum up to this zero can be set to zero (by replacing the zero with a value that cancels the sum so far). Then, leadingZero is set to true, and the frequency map is reset. For subsequent zeros (leadingZero is true), the code needs to add the maximum frequency of the sums in the current segment. Because, in the current segment (between the previous zero and this zero), the sum up to each element in the segment can be adjusted by replacing this zero with a value that allows the sum up to this zero to be zero. The maximum frequency of a sum in this segment tells us how many times we can have a prefix sum equal to that sum. By choosing the sum with the highest frequency, we can set X such that the sum up to the current zero is zero for all those occurrences.\n\nFor example, suppose between the previous zero and the current zero, the prefix sums are S_1, S_2, ..., S_k. The maximum frequency is for sum S. Then, by replacing the current zero with X = -S, the sum up to the current zero becomes S + X = 0. However, each occurrence of S in the prefix sums corresponds to a prefix in the segment where the sum up to that position is S. So, when the current zero is set to X = -S, the sum up to the current zero is zero. But also, each of the positions in the segment where the sum was S would have their sum plus X equal to zero. Wait, no. Because the sum up to the current zero is S + X. So, if S is the sum of the segment up to j-1, then X = -S makes the sum up to j zero. But how does this affect the prefixes within the segment?\n\nWait, the segments are processed as follows. After each original zero (except the first), the code accumulates the maximum frequency of the current segment. So, each time a zero is encountered and leadingZero is true, the code should add the maxFreq to the answer. Then, reset the frequency map and maxFreq.\n\nSo in the TODO section, the code should be adding the maxFreq to ans. Because for each such zero (after the first), the current segment's maxFreq indicates how many times a sum occurred in that segment. By replacing the zero with X = -S (where S is the sum that occurred maxFreq times), we can have that many instances where the sum up to that zero is zero. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose the segment between two zeros has elements [a, b, c]. The original array is [0, a, b, c, 0]. The first zero is processed, leading to ans += frequency of 0 (which is 1, since the sum is 0 at the first zero). Then, for the next zero (current element), leadingZero is true. So during processing this zero, the code will enter the TODO block.\n\nThe sum after processing a, b, c is sum = a + b + c. The maxFreq is the maximum frequency of the sums encountered in this segment (a, a+b, a+b+c). Let's say the sum a occurs once, a+b occurs twice, and a+b+c once. The maxFreq is 2. So, in the TODO block, we add 2 to ans. Then, when the zero is replaced with X = -(a+b), making the sum up to that zero equal to a + b + X = a + b - (a + b) = 0. Then, the prefix sums up to that zero will be zero in two positions: once when the sum is a+b (before adding X), and once at the end. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is that each time a segment is between two zeros (original), the maximum frequency in that segment is the maximum number of times a prefix sum occurs. By replacing the current zero (the one that ends the segment) with a value that sets the sum up to that zero to zero, the number of times the sum up to that zero is zero is 1 (only at the end). But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the logic is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to group the array into blocks separated by the original zeros. For each block except the first, we can choose the sum that occurs most frequently in the block. Then, by setting the zero at the end of the block to the negative of that sum, we can have the sum up to that zero be zero. Additionally, each occurrence of that sum in the block's prefix sums would correspond to a previous index where the sum (up to that index in the block) plus the sum of the previous blocks is zero. Wait, maybe the key is that each time a sum occurs in the block, the total sum up to that point (including previous blocks) is zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible explanation. Let's consider the array divided into segments separated by the original zeros. Each segment (except the first) is between two original zeros. For each such segment, the sum of the elements in the segment plus the modified zero can be adjusted to zero. But how does that contribute to the total score?\n\nWait, the code's solution seems to process each zero in the original array. The first zero is handled by adding the count of sum zero in the initial segment (before the first zero). For each subsequent zero (which is part of the original array), the code adds the maximum frequency of any sum in the current segment (the segment between the previous zero and current zero). Then, after processing all elements, if leadingZero is true (i.e., there was at least one original zero), the code adds the maxFreq of the last segment (after the last zero). Otherwise, it adds the count of sum zero in the entire array.\n\nSo the logic is: each original zero can be used to split the array into segments. The first segment (before the first zero) contributes the number of times sum zero occurs in it. Each subsequent segment contributes the maximum frequency of any sum in that segment. The reason is that in each such segment, by replacing the zero at the end of the segment with a value that makes the sum up to that zero zero (i.e., the sum of the segment up to that point is S, so set the zero to -S), you get one occurrence (the end of the segment). But the code is adding the maximum frequency, which suggests that perhaps there's a way to get more occurrences.\n\nAh! Oh right, because each occurrence of a sum S in the segment can be turned into a point where the sum up to that position in the segment is S. Then, by choosing the zero at the end of the segment to be -S, the sum up to that zero becomes S + (-S) = 0. But this would only contribute one to the answer. So how does the maximum frequency come into play?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering that the sum of the entire segment (including the replaced zero) can be adjusted to create multiple zeros. For example, imagine a segment where the prefix sums (without the zero) are S1, S2, S3. If the original zero is replaced with X, then the sum up to the zero is S3 + X. We can choose X to be any value. If we choose X = -S3, then the sum up to the zero becomes zero. This gives one point. But if in the segment, the same sum S occurs multiple times, then by choosing X = -S, the sum up to each occurrence of S in the segment would be S + X (but X is added only once). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is considering that the sum of the entire segment (up to the zero) can be set to zero, but also any occurrence of that sum within the segment would allow the sum up to that position plus previous segments to be zero. Wait, maybe not. Let's take a step back.\n\nThe key idea is that each original zero can be a point where we can adjust the sum. Each segment between two zeros can be manipulated by replacing the zero at the end. So for each segment (except the first), we can choose the sum S (the sum of the elements in the segment, but the prefix sums are tracked as the segment is processed). The maximum frequency of any sum in the segment tells us how many times that sum occurs. By replacing the zero with -S, the sum up to the end of the segment is zero. Additionally, all occurrences of S in the prefix sums of the segment would correspond to positions where the sum up to that position (plus previous segments) equals zero. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is tracking the prefix sums of the entire array. When we encounter a zero in the original array, the sum up to that point (before replacement) is S. Replacing the zero with X changes the sum to S + X. If we set X such that S + X = 0, then the sum up to that index is zero, contributing 1 to the score. But how can multiple zeros in the original array contribute multiple points?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is grouping the array into regions between original zeros. For each such region, the code tracks the prefix sums and finds the maximum frequency of a sum in that region. By replacing the original zero at the end of the region, we can adjust the sum to be zero at that point. But also, any occurrence of the same sum in the region can be used to create a zero sum by adjusting the zero at the end. For example, suppose in a region, the sum after processing the first element is S, then after the second is S again. If we set the zero at the end of the region to -S, then all those positions where the sum was S would have their cumulative sum plus the previous regions' sums (if any) equal to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is that the sum of the entire array up to the current zero is the sum of all previous regions (processed and with their zeros adjusted) plus the current segment's sum plus the replaced zero's value. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the fact that when you replace a zero, the sum up to that zero can be any value. But to maximize the number of prefixes that sum to zero, you can adjust the replaced zeros such that multiple prefixes sum to zero.\n\nThe algorithm used in the code seems to be as follows:\n\n1. Split the array into segments separated by original zeros.\n2. For the first segment (before the first zero), count how many times the prefix sum is zero. This is added to the answer.\n3. For each subsequent segment (between two zeros), the maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the segment is added to the answer. This is because by replacing the zero at the end of the segment with the negative of that sum, you can have as many zeros as the frequency of that sum in the segment.\n4. After processing all elements, if there was at least one zero (leadingZero is true), add the maximum frequency of the last segment (after the last zero) to the answer. Otherwise, add the count of sum zero in the entire array.\n\nWait, but why would the maximum frequency of the segment contribute to the answer? Let's think of a segment between two zeros. Let's say the original array is [0, a, b, 0, c, d, 0]. The first segment is [a, b], and the second is [c, d]. For each of these segments, we track the prefix sums. For the first segment (a, b), the sum after a is S1 = a, after b is S2 = a + b. The frequencies of S1 and S2 are tracked. The maximum frequency is say, 2 (if S1 and S2 are the same). Then, when replacing the zero after the segment with X = -S_max (the sum with maximum frequency), then the sum up to that zero becomes S_max + X = 0, contributing one to the answer. But how does that relate to the frequency?\n\nAh! Oh right, perhaps each occurrence of S_max in the segment's prefix sums can be turned into a zero. Wait, no. Because the sum up to that point (in the segment) would be S_max. If the zero is set to -S_max, then the sum up to the zero is S_max + (-S_max) = 0, which is one occurrence. But how does the frequency of S_max in the segment's prefix sums lead to multiple zeros?\n\nWait, maybe the code is considering that when you replace the zero with X, the sum up to that zero is zero. Also, any occurrence of the same sum in the segment's prefix sums would have their sum up to that index plus the X (but X is added after the segment). Hmm, that doesn't make sense. For example, if the segment is [a, b], and the prefix sums are a, a+b. Suppose the maximum frequency is for a (frequency 1). Replacing the zero after b with -a would make the sum up to that zero equal to a + b + (-a) = b. If the sum is to be zero, then that's not the case. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let's refer back to the example in the problem statement.\n\nIn the first test case, the input array is [2, 0, 1, -1, 0]. The optimal solution is to replace the second element (0) with -2, leading to [2, -2, 1, -1, 0]. The score is 3. The prefixes that sum to zero are:\n\n- index 2: 2 + (-2) = 0.\n- index 4: sum up to 4 is 0.\n- index 5: sum up to 5 is 0.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, let's see:\n\nThe array is split into segments. The first zero is at index 1 (element 0). So the first segment is [2], with sum 2. The code adds the frequency of 0 in this segment, which is 0. But wait, the code adds freqs.getOrDefault(0L, 0) when the first zero is encountered. The freqs would have sum 2 (from the first element). So the ans is 0. Then leadingZero is set to true. The next elements are 1, -1, 0. So when the next zero is processed (element 4 in the original array?), the code enters the TODO block. The current segment is [1, -1], sum 0. The prefix sums are 1 and 0. The frequencies are {1:1, 0:1}. maxFreq is 1. So in the TODO block, ans += 1. Then, the code clears the freqs and resets maxFreq. Finally, after processing the last zero, the code adds maxFreq (since leadingZero is true). The last segment is [0], but the currentSum after adding the zero is 0 (since the zero is processed). Wait, perhaps this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is that each original zero (except the first) allows us to choose a value for the zero such that the sum up to that zero is zero, and that the number of times a particular sum occurs in the segment before the zero gives us the number of possible zeros. For example, in the first test case's second segment (elements 1, -1, 0), the zero is replaced with 0. Wait, but that's not the case. The example's solution replaces the second element (the first zero) with -2, which is in the first segment.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is as follows:\n\n- The first time a zero is encountered (leadingZero is false), we can replace it with a value that makes the sum up to that point zero. The number of times the sum was zero in the first segment (before the first zero) is added to ans. Then, leadingZero becomes true.\n\n- For subsequent zeros (leadingZero is true), each such zero is part of a segment. The maximum frequency of a sum in that segment is added to ans. The idea is that by replacing the current zero with a value that cancels the sum of the segment up to that point (sum S, replace zero with -S), we can get one occurrence (the end of the segment). However, the code is adding the maximum frequency of the sum in the segment, which suggests that each occurrence of that sum in the segment contributes to the answer.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's look at the code again.\n\nWhen a zero is encountered:\n\nif (val == 0L) {\n    if (leadingZero) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    } else {\n        ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0L, 0);\n        leadingZero = true;\n    }\n    maxFreq = 0;\n    freqs.clear();\n}\n\ncurrentSum is updated after handling the zero. Wait, no. currentSum += val is after the zero check. So, when val is zero, the code handles the zero, then adds val (zero) to currentSum. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    long val = scanner.nextLong();\n    if (val == 0L) {\n        ... handle zero ...\n    }\n    currentSum += val;\n    ... update freqs and maxFreq ...\n}\n\nWait, no. The code reads val, then checks if it is zero. If so, processes the block. Then, adds val to currentSum. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the code after the if (val == 0) block adds val to currentSum. So, even if val is zero, it is added to currentSum.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the code's logic, when a zero is encountered (original zero), the code handles the segment up to that point. But then, the val (zero) is added to currentSum. So the currentSum after processing the zero is not the sum up to before the zero, but including the zero. That seems wrong. Because when the zero is in the original array, the code is allowed to change it to any value. So, the code should treat the zero as a point to split the array, but not include it in the sum until after it's processed.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect. Let's take the example from the problem.\n\nIn the first test case, the array is [2, 0, 1, -1, 0]. The code would process each element:\n\nFirst element: 2. val is not zero. currentSum += 2. freqs now has 2:1. maxFreq is 1.\n\nSecond element: 0. val is zero. leadingZero is false. So ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0, 0) \u2192 0. leadingZero becomes true. Then, maxFreq is reset to 0, freqs cleared. Then, val (0) is added to currentSum. So currentSum is 0+0=0. Then, the code increments freq for currentSum (0) to 1. maxFreq is 1.\n\nThird element: 1. val is not zero. currentSum +=1 \u21921. freqs has 0:1 (from previous step?), wait no. Let's retrace:\n\nAfter processing the second element (zero):\n\nAfter handling the zero, leadingZero is set to true. Then, the code clears freqs and resets maxFreq. Then, after the if (val ==0) block, val (0) is added to currentSum. So currentSum was zero before (after adding the first element 2 and then zero). Wait, no. Let me re-trace:\n\nWait, the code's variables are initialized as currentSum = 0. Then, for each element:\n\ni=0: val=2. not zero. currentSum += 2 \u21922. add to freqs: 2:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=1: val=0. zero. leadingZero is false. ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0, 0) \u21920. leadingZero becomes true. maxFreq reset to 0, freqs cleared. Then, currentSum +=0 \u21920+0=0. So currentSum is now 0. Then, in the code after the if block, the code adds val to currentSum. Wait, wait no. The code is:\n\nif (val == 0L) {\n   ... handle zero ...\n}\ncurrentSum += val;\n\nSo, after the if block, val is added to currentSum. So for val=0 (i=1), currentSum was 2 (from previous steps). Then, after the if block, currentSum += val \u21922 + 0 = 2. Wait, no. Because the code adds val to currentSum after the if block. So the currentSum is accumulated regardless of whether the element is a zero. So when the code processes a zero, the val (0) is added to currentSum. Then, the code updates the freqs and maxFreq.\n\nWait, this can't be right. Because when the code encounters an original zero, that zero is part of the array but can be modified. So the code's logic must treat the original zeros as points where the sum up to that point can be adjusted.\n\nBut according to the code's current structure, the sum includes the original zero. For example, in the first test case, the first zero is processed. Then, the code adds 0 (val) to currentSum, which is 2 + 0 = 2. Then, the code adds this to the frequency map, which now has 2:1. So the sum up to the first zero is 2 (currentSum after adding val=0). But that's not correct, because the original zero is part of the array. So the code's approach seems to include the original zeros in the sum, but they can be modified. This seems wrong.\n\nAh! Here's the problem. The code is treating the original zeros as part of the array and adding them to the currentSum. But when we replace a zero, its value is changed. So the code's current approach of adding the original zeros to the sum is incorrect. Because the zeros can be replaced with any value, so their contribution to the sum can be anything. So the code's logic of processing the original zeros and adding them to currentSum is incorrect. Instead, the code should process the elements in between zeros, and when a zero is encountered, it's treated as a breakpoint where we can choose the value of that zero to affect the sum.\n\nSo, the code's current approach may be incorrect. But according to the code structure, the zeros are included in the currentSum. So how does this work?\n\nLet me think again. The code must be designed such that the zeros in the original array are considered as positions where the sum can be adjusted. So the code is dividing the array into segments between original zeros. Each segment (except the first) is the elements between two zeros. For each such segment, the code tracks the prefix sums. When a zero is encountered (the end of a segment), the code uses the maximum frequency of sums in that segment and adds it to the answer. Then, the sum up to that zero is adjusted by replacing the zero with a value that makes the sum up to that point zero.\n\nBut in the code, the val (zero) is added to currentSum, which represents the sum including the original zero. But since the zero can be replaced, the currentSum should not include the original zero. Instead, the code should process the elements up to but not including the zero, then handle the zero by adjusting the sum.\n\nSo, the code's current logic is flawed. But given that the code is provided as a skeleton that we need to complete, perhaps the code's logic is correct, and we need to figure out the correct code to add.\n\nWait, let's think about the variables after processing a zero. For example, when a zero is encountered, leadingZero is true. The code inside the TODO block would add something to ans. Then, the currentSum is set to currentSum + val (zero), which is currentSum + 0. But since val is zero, it's added to currentSum. But the code then proceeds to process the next elements.\n\nThis suggests that the code is considering the original zero as part of the sum, but when the zero is replaced with another value, that value is not included in the currentSum. That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to process each segment between original zeros. Each segment is the elements after the previous zero up to but not including the current zero. Then, the current zero is a separate element. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is to treat each original zero as the end of a segment, and the zero itself is not part of the segment. So when a zero is encountered, the code processes the segment up to the previous element. Then, the zero is processed as part of the next segment.\n\nBut this isn't reflected in the code. Let's look again:\n\nIn the loop for each element:\n\n- Read val.\n\n- If val is zero, process the code inside the if block.\n\n- Then, add val to currentSum.\n\nSo, for example, if the array is [a, 0, b], the first zero is encountered after a. The code processes the zero (adds to ans), then adds zero to currentSum. Then, the next element is b. currentSum is a + 0 + b.\n\nBut the code's logic seems to treat the zero as part of the sum, but the zero can be replaced, so its contribution to the sum can be anything. So this seems incorrect.\n\nBut given that the code is provided, and the missing part is in the TODO block, we need to figure out what code to add there.\n\nLet's return to the original example provided in the problem statement. The first test case:\n\nOriginal array: [2, 0, 1, -1, 0]\n\nAfter replacing the second element (0) with -2, the array becomes [2, -2, 1, -1, 0]. The score is 3.\n\nThe code's output for this case should be 3.\n\nLet's step through the code's execution for this test case.\n\nn=5, array [2,0,1,-1,0].\n\nProcessing each element:\n\ni=0, val=2. Not zero. currentSum +=2 \u21922. freqs now has 2:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=1, val=0. Zero. leadingZero is false. So ans += freqs.getOrDefault(0L,0) \u21920. leadingZero becomes true. Then, maxFreq=0, freqs cleared. Then, currentSum +=0 \u21922+0=2. freqs.put(2, 1). maxFreq=1.\n\ni=2, val=1. Not zero. currentSum +=1 \u21923. freqs has 3:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=3, val=-1. Not zero. currentSum +=-1 \u21922. freqs has 2:1 (existing 2's count was 1 from i=1). Now 2's count is 2. So freq=2. maxFreq becomes 2.\n\ni=4, val=0. Zero. leadingZero is true. So enter the TODO block. Then, maxFreq is reset to 0, freqs cleared. currentSum +=0 \u21922+0=2. freqs.put(2, 1). maxFreq=1.\n\nAfter processing all elements, leadingZero is true. So ans += maxFreq (which is 1). Total ans is 0 (from first zero) + 2 (from the TODO block?) Wait, no. Let's track ans step by step.\n\nInitial ans is 0.\n\ni=1 (val=0): leadingZero is false. ans +=0 \u2192ans=0. leadingZero becomes true. Then, after adding val to currentSum, freqs.put(2,1). maxFreq=1.\n\ni=2: val=1. currentSum=3. freqs has 3:1. maxFreq=1.\n\ni=3: val=-1. currentSum=2. freqs has 2:2 (since after i=1, currentSum was 2, and now it's 2 again). So freq is 2. maxFreq=2.\n\ni=4: val=0. leadingZero is true. So enter TODO block. The code here needs to add the maxFreq (which is 2) to ans. So ans increases by 2 \u2192 ans=0+2=2. Then, maxFreq is reset to 0, freqs cleared. currentSum +=0 \u21922+0=2. freqs.put(2,1). maxFreq=1.\n\nAfter the loop ends, leadingZero is true. So ans += maxFreq (1) \u2192 ans=2+1=3. Which matches the example's answer.\n\nSo in the TODO block, we should add the maxFreq (which is 2) to ans. This comes from the segment between the first zero (i=1) and the current zero (i=4). The maxFreq for this segment is 2. So the code for the TODO block should be adding ans += maxFreq.\n\nSo the missing code is ans += maxFreq;\n\nTherefore, in the TODO part, when val is zero and leadingZero is true, the code should add the current maxFreq to ans. So the line to add is ans += maxFreq;.\n\nLet me check another example. The second test case in the problem statement:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0]. Output: 3.\n\nWait, no. The problem's second example says:\n\n\"In the second test case, it is optimal to change the value of a3 to -2e9, giving us an array with a score of 1.\"\n\nWait, the second test case input is [0, 0, 0], and the output is 1? Or perhaps another example.\n\nWait, the problem's second test case example says: the array is [2000000000, 2000000000, 0]. The output is 1. So the code should process this correctly.\n\nBut regardless, in the TODO block, adding ans += maxFreq; seems to be correct based on the first example.\n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO block is ans += maxFreq;."
