Let me start by understanding the problem. The problem says that each stamp operation affects two neighboring cells. Each stamp can be applied in two orientations: RB or BR. Every time the stamp is applied, both cells under it are recolored. So, applying the stamp multiple times on the same cells can toggle their colors.",

But since you can apply the stamp multiple times, including overlapping ones, how can we model this? Wait, perhaps the key is to model the parity of how each cell is stamped. Let's think differently. Each cell is part of some number of stamps. Let's say for a cell i, the number of times it is the left or right in a stamp. Each stamp application that includes cell i as the left or right element will affect its color. However, each stamp application has a direction.

But wait, in the fifth test case, the input is BRB. The explanation says that it's possible. So that's a segment of length 3. How?\n\nSo the idea is that segments of length >=2 are possible as long as they meet certain conditions. But what conditions?\n\nAnother observation: In a segment of even length, perhaps the colors must alternate. For example, RB RB etc. Or BR BR, etc. But for a segment of odd length, perhaps it's possible to have an alternation starting with R and ending with B, but I'm not sure.

If any segment has length 1, output NO. But how to split the string into segments separated by W? For example, in the sample input, the first test case is BRBBW. Splitting on W gives the segment \"BRBB\".",

So if there are two stamps, that's 4 cells. But in reality, overlapping stamps overwrite previous cells. So the sum approach is invalid. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Alternative approach inspired by code structure:\n\nThe given code appends a 'W' to the end of the string. So, the code is splitting the string into segments between Ws. Then, the check function must process each segment and determine validity. Looking at the code:\n\nIn main, after reading s, it appends a 'W'. Then, the check function is called. The check function's current code has a loop from i=0 to n (since s is now length n+1, with the added W). The code in the check function is supposed to process the segments. The current code is:\n\nlong long check(){\n    long long num1=0,num2=0;\n    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nThe variables num1 and num2 might be used to track something as we iterate through the string. But how?\n\nPerhaps, the code is intended to track the segments between Ws. So, for each segment (sequence of non-W characters), we need to check the conditions. In the code, the for loop iterates from i=0 to n (inclusive), which now includes the added W. So, when processing each character, when we hit a W, we can process the current segment (if any). So, the code inside the loop might look something like:\n\nif (current character is W) {\n    if the current segment length is non-zero:\n        check if it's valid. if invalid, return 0. reset the current segment variables. } else {\n    add to the current segment.\n} But how to implement this?",

So R is present once, B twice. So the counts are R:1, B:2. But each stamp adds one R and B. So applying two stamps would result in 2 R and 2 B. But in this case, the counts are 1 and 2. So the counts don't balance. So this suggests that the R and B counts are not necessarily equal. So the condition of having at least one R and B is not sufficient. Alternatively, the segment must have at least one R and one B. For example, a segment of BB is invalid (no R). A segment of RB is valid (has both), a segment of RBR is valid (has both), and so on. So the conditions are:\n\n- All non-W segments must have length >=2.\n\n- All non-W segments must contain at least one R and at least one B.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then the answer is YES, otherwise NO. But wait, let's test this with the examples. Sample test case 2: n=2, s=WW. The answer is YES (no stamps needed). But according to the conditions, since there are no non-W segments, it's allowed. Sample test case 3: n=2, s=RR. The segment has length 2, but no B. So the answer is NO.\n\nSample test case 4: n=2, s=RB. This has both R and B. So answer is YES. Sample test case 5: BRB (n=3).",

But how?\n\nBecause the last stamp applied to the pair 2-3 is RB, which sets them to R and B. But then, perhaps another stamp is applied to 3-4 as BR, which affects cell 3. So cell 3 could be overwritten. But this is getting complicated. So perhaps the only conditions are the two mentioned: non-W segments must have length >=2 and contain both R and B.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n1. Split the string into non-W segments.\n\n2. For each such segment:\n\n   a. If length is 1 \u2192 invalid. b. If all characters are same (e.g., RR or BBB) \u2192 invalid. 3. If all segments are valid, return YES; else NO. So the code inside check() should iterate through the string, track the current segment, and check these conditions. Now, how to implement this in code. In the provided code, the check() function loops from i=0 to n (inclusive). The string s has been appended with a 'W' in main. So each original character plus the added W is processed.",

The code's variables are num1 and num2. Maybe they are counts of R and B in the current segment. So, when we encounter a 'W', we check if the current segment is valid. For example:\n\ncurrent_segment_length = 0\n\ncurrent_R = 0\n\ncurrent_B = 0\n\nfor each character in s:\n\n    if char is W:\n\n        if current_segment_length > 0:\n\n            if current_segment_length == 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\n            elif current_R == 0 or current_B == 0 \u2192 invalid. reset current_segment_length, current_R, current_B.\n\n    else:\n\n        increment current_segment_length. if char is R \u2192 current_R++\n\n        else \u2192 current_B++ So, this would check for each segment whether it's valid. Thus, the code in the check() function's loop should:\n\n- For each character in s (including the added W):\n\n   - if the character is W:\n\n      - check if there's a current segment (current_segment_length >0)\n\n      - if current_segment_length is 1 \u2192 invalid (return 0)\n\n      - else if current_R ==0 or current_B ==0 \u2192 invalid (return 0)\n\n      - reset counters.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - increment current_segment_length.\n\n      - increment current_R or current_B based on the character. Thus, in code:\n\nlong long check() {\n    long long current_length = 0;\n    long long current_R = 0, current_B = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n        if (s[i] == 'W') {\n            if (current_length > 0) {\n                if (current_length == 1) {\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                if (current_R == 0 || current_B == 0) {\n                    return 0;\n                }\n            }\n            current_length = 0;\n            current_R = 0;\n            current_B = 0;\n        } else {\n            current_length++;\n            if (s[i] == 'R') {\n                current_R++;\n            } else {\n                current_B++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return 1;\n} But the original code has variables num1 and num2. Maybe they are current_R and current_B.\n\nThe original code in the check() function has:\n\nlong long num1=0,num2=0;\n\nSo, perhaps num1 is current_R and num2 is current_B. Or vice versa. So, the code inside the loop would be:\n\nif (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n   if (current_length > 0) {\n\n      if (current_length == 1 \u2192 return 0. if (num1 == 0 || num2 ==0 \u2192 return 0.\n\n   }\n\n   reset num1, num2, current_length.\n\n} else {\n\n   current_length++. if s[i] == 'R', increment num1, else increment num2.\n\n}\n\nBut in the code, the variables are num1 and num2, which are initialized to 0 at each call. So, the code should look like this:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n   if (num1 + num2 > 0) { // meaning current segment length is num1 + num2 (since each character is either R or B) if (num1 + num2 == 1) {\n\n          return 0;\n\n      }\n\n      if (num1 ==0 || num2 ==0) {\n\n          return 0;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   num1 = 0;\n\n   num2 = 0;\n\n} else {\n\n   if (s[i] == 'R') {\n\n       num1++;\n\n   } else {\n\n       num2++;\n\n   }\n\n} Wait, but num1 and num2 are counts of R and B in the current segment. When we hit a W, we check if the sum of num1 and num2 (current segment length) is >=2, and whether both are non-zero. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n        // Check current segment\n\n        int len = num1 + num2;\n\n        if (len > 0) {\n\n            if (len == 1) {\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n            if (num1 ==0 || num2 ==0) {\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // Reset counters\n\n        num1 = 0;\n\n        num2 = 0;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (s[i] == 'R') {\n\n            num1++;\n\n        } else {\n\n            num2++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nreturn 1;\n\n}\n\nThis code would check that each non-W segment has length >=2 and contains at least one R and one B.\n\nSo, the variables num1 and num2 are counts of R and B in the current segment. So, the missing code in the check function is this logic. But how to fill this into the existing code.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the check function in the provided C++ code so that it correctly determines if the given string s can be formed using the stamp operations as described. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe problem says that each stamp operation affects two neighboring cells. Each stamp can be applied in two orientations: RB or BR. Every time the stamp is applied, both cells under it are recolored. So, applying the stamp multiple times on the same cells can toggle their colors. For example, if a cell was first turned to R and then stamped again, it might change to B, depending on the stamp's orientation.\n\nThe goal is to check if the given final configuration is possible. Let's think about the constraints that the final string must satisfy for it to be achievable.\n\nFirst, let's note some observations:\n\n1. Each stamp operation affects exactly two adjacent cells. So, any non-white cell (R or B) must be part of at least one such pair. Except for the case where all cells are white (which requires zero stamps, so it's valid).\n\nWait, but if a cell is white in the final configuration, that's possible only if it was never stamped, or was stamped an even number of times in such a way that it ends up white. Wait, no\u2014because each stamp changes the color. Wait, the initial color is white. Each stamp application affects two cells. Each application changes the color of each of the two cells. But the initial color is white. So for example, applying a BR stamp once on two white cells turns them to B and R. Applying the same stamp again would turn B to R and R to B? Or does each stamp application overwrite the colors? The problem statement says \"recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So each stamping sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. So for example, applying the BR stamp once on two white cells makes them B and R. Applying the same stamp again would make them B and R again, not changing. Wait, no\u2014the problem says \"recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So each stamp application sets the two cells to the stamp's colors. So each time you apply a stamp, it overwrites the previous colors of those two cells. So the order of operations matters. But since you can apply the stamp multiple times, including overlapping ones, how can we model this?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the parity of how each cell is stamped. Let's think differently. Each cell is part of some number of stamps. Let's say for a cell i, the number of times it is the left or right in a stamp. Each stamp application that includes cell i as the left or right element will affect its color. However, each stamp application has a direction. For example, applying a BR stamp on cells i and i+1 sets cell i to B and i+1 to R. If later we apply a RB stamp on the same cells, then cell i becomes R and i+1 becomes B. So each application of a stamp on a pair (i,i+1) can be thought of as toggling the colors of those cells according to the stamp's direction.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that each pair of adjacent cells must form a BR or RB pattern. Wait, but the problem allows multiple applications. For example, in the first sample, the final configuration is BRBBW. Let's see how that is achieved. The stamps are applied in such a way that each application changes certain pairs. But perhaps the key is that the colors must form segments where each non-white segment has adjacent pairs that alternate between R and B.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be broken down into looking at the runs of non-white characters. Because whenever you stamp a pair, you can create a BR or RB. Applying the stamp again on the same pair can change it to the opposite. But how does this affect the overall arrangement?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each non-white cell must be part of at least one pair of adjacent cells that are of different colors. Because each stamp operation creates a pair of different colors (BR or RB). So if the final picture has any adjacent pair that is RR, BB, or WW (but W can't be part of a stamp), then maybe it's impossible.\n\nWait, no. Because multiple stamps can be applied. For example, suppose you have two adjacent cells that are both R. How could that happen?\n\nLet's say we have a pair of cells that are stamped in the following way:\n\nFirst, stamp them as BR (so B R). Then, stamp the left cell with the previous one (if there is one) as RB, making that left cell R and the current left cell B. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern that the final string must have.\n\nWait, here's an important observation: Each time a stamp is applied to a pair, it sets them to either BR or RB. So, after all stamps are applied, every pair that was stamped an odd number of times (in a particular direction) would contribute to the final color. Wait, maybe not. Because each application overwrites the colors. For example, applying BR once gives B R. Applying BR again gives B R again. So the parity of the number of BR applications on that pair doesn't matter. Each application sets the colors, regardless of previous state.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So each stamp application on a pair (i, i+1) in either BR or RB orientation will set those two cells to that particular color pair. So, the last application on a pair determines their colors. However, other applications on overlapping pairs can affect other cells. So, for example, if you stamp (i, i+1) as BR, then stamp (i+1, i+2) as RB, then stamp (i, i+1) as RB, the colors would be R B R B, etc.\n\nThis makes it challenging because the order of operations matters, and overlapping stamps can affect the same cells multiple times.\n\nBut given that, how can we model the possible final configurations?\n\nAlternative approach: To model the problem by considering that each non-white cell must be part of at least one stamp. But even that's not necessarily true because a cell could be part of multiple stamps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final configuration can be broken into segments between the W's. For each such segment (a consecutive sequence of R and B), we need to check if it can be formed by some sequence of stamps.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Split the string into segments separated by W's. Each segment must be non-empty (since W's are the separators). For each such segment, check if it's possible.\n\n2. For a segment to be possible, it must satisfy certain conditions. Let's think about each such segment. For example, a segment of length 1 is impossible because each stamp affects two cells, so any non-W cell must be part of at least one pair. So a single non-W cell can't exist.\n\nWait, exactly. So any segment (between W's) that has length 1 is invalid. So the first check is that all non-W segments have length >= 2.\n\nBut wait, in the fifth test case, the input is BRB. The explanation says that it's possible. So that's a segment of length 3. How?\n\nSo the idea is that segments of length >=2 are possible as long as they meet certain conditions. But what conditions?\n\nAnother observation: In a segment of even length, perhaps the colors must alternate. For example, RB RB etc. Or BR BR, etc. But for a segment of odd length, perhaps it's possible to have an alternation starting with R and ending with B, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but let's think of the example given. The fifth test case's input is BRB. The steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 BR B.\n\nSo the first stamp is on positions 2-3 (assuming 1-based) as RB, making them R and B. Then, the next stamp is on positions 1-2 as BR, making them B and R. So the final string is B R B.\n\nSo in this case, the segment is B R B, which is length 3. The first and third cells are B, the middle is R. So adjacent pairs are BR, RB, so they are alternating.\n\nAnother example from the sixth test case: input is RB B. Steps are WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 RB B. So the first stamp is on 2-3 as RB (R and B). Then stamp on 1-2 as RB (R and B). So final string is R B B. Wait, the adjacent pairs are RB and BB. But how is this possible?\n\nWait, that example's input is RBB. But the explanation says that after the first stamp (positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 R and B), then the next stamp is positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R and B. So the final string is R B B. So the pairs are RB and BB. But the BB pair would not be allowed? Unless there's another stamp that affects them.\n\nWait, in the sixth test case's example, the final configuration is RBB. How is that possible? Because the second stamp is applied to positions 1-2 as RB, which makes them R and B. Then the third cell was B from the first stamp. So the pairs are RB (positions 1-2) and BB (positions 2-3). But the BB pair is invalid. Wait, but according to the problem statement, in that example, it's considered a valid configuration. So that contradicts my earlier assumption that adjacent pairs must alternate.\n\nHmm. So maybe the earlier approach is incorrect. Let me re-examine that example.\n\nWait, in the sixth test case's input, the final string is RBB. The steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 WRB (stamp on 2-3 as RB) \u2192 RBB (stamp on 1-2 as RB). Wait, how? Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: WWW (all white).\n\nApply stamp on positions 2 and 3 as RB \u2192 W R B. Then apply stamp on positions 1 and 2 as RB \u2192 R B B. So the final string is R B B.\n\nBut the adjacent pairs are R B and B B. The B B pair is adjacent. So according to this, the configuration can have adjacent same colors as long as they are part of overlapping stamp operations.\n\nSo the earlier idea that adjacent pairs must alternate is invalid. Therefore, there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternative approach: Each time you stamp a pair, you set them to either RB or BR. So the final colors are determined by the last stamp applied to each pair. But since a pair can be part of multiple stamps, the overlapping might allow for varying possibilities.\n\nBut how can we model the possibilities for the entire string?\n\nLet's think of the problem in terms of the parity of the number of times a cell is stamped. But since each stamp affects two cells, perhaps the parity of the number of times each cell is covered by any stamp is important.\n\nBut each stamp application to a pair (i, i+1) affects the colors of i and i+1. However, each stamp application can be either BR or RB. So the color of each cell depends on the last stamp applied to any pair that includes it.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that each cell (except the first and last in a segment) is part of two pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). But since each stamp can be applied multiple times, the order determines the final color.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we need to find some invariant or pattern that the final string must satisfy.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each cell's color is determined by the parity of the number of times it has been part of a stamp. For example, if a cell is part of an even number of stamps, maybe it's white. But no, because the initial color is white, and each stamp changes the color. But the problem allows stamps to overwrite previous colors.\n\nWait, no. Each stamp application sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. So, for example, if a cell is stamped once with B (as part of a BR pair), then later stamped again with R (as part of an RB pair), the final color is R. So it's not the parity but the last stamp applied that affects the color.\n\nThis complicates things. However, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: the entire process of stamping can be viewed as a sequence of operations where each operation sets a pair of adjacent cells to either BR or RB. The order of operations matters because overlapping pairs can overwrite previous colors.\n\nBut given that the problem allows any number of operations, how can we determine if the final configuration is achievable?\n\nAn alternative idea is to process the string from left to right, ensuring that each pair of non-W cells has a valid transition. For example, after a B, the next must be R and vice versa. But the sixth test case example shows that this is not the case. So that idea is invalid.\n\nAnother observation: Any non-W segment must have at least two cells (since a single cell cannot be stamped). So any test case with a non-W segment of length 1 is automatically invalid. So, first step is to split the string into segments separated by W and check each segment's length. If any segment has length 1, output NO.\n\nBut how to split the string into segments separated by W? For example, in the sample input, the first test case is BRBBW. Splitting on W gives the segment \"BRBB\". Then, the following W is part of the split. So each segment is a sequence of non-W characters between Ws.\n\nSo the algorithm should:\n\n- Split the original string into runs of non-W characters.\n\n- For each run, check:\n\n   a. If the length is 0 (all W), it's allowed.\n\n   b. If the length is 1, return NO.\n\n   c. For runs of length >=2, check some other conditions.\n\nBut what conditions?\n\nWait, in the sixth test case example, the segment is \"RBB\" (length 3), which is allowed. So even though there's a BB in the middle, it's possible.\n\nAnother example: the fifth test case's input is \"BRB\" (length 3), which is allowed.\n\nSo perhaps the condition for a segment is that it must have at least two cells, and the first and last characters must be different. Or perhaps there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, think of the segment as being formed by applying stamps in a certain way. Let's consider that the first stamp applied in the segment sets two adjacent cells to BR or RB. Subsequent stamps can overlap and change the colors.\n\nFor example, in a segment of length 3:\n\nWe can stamp positions 1-2 as BR (B R W), then stamp positions 2-3 as RB (R B), resulting in B R B. Then, perhaps stamp 1-2 again as BR (B R B again). But this example is similar to the fifth test case.\n\nHmm. So what's common between the allowed segments? Let's look for some pattern.\n\nIn the fifth test case, the segment is B R B. The first and last characters are B. So it's possible to have a segment of odd length with first and last characters the same.\n\nIn the sixth test case, the segment is R B B. The first is R, last is B. So the first and last are different.\n\nSo maybe the parity of the segment's length and the first and last characters' equality is not a factor.\n\nAlternative idea: For a segment to be valid, the number of R and B in the segment must be such that they can be formed by overlapping stamp operations. Since each stamp operation adds one R and one B (or B and R), perhaps the total number of R and B must be balanced in some way. But for example, a segment of length 3 has three cells. If in the fifth test case, it's B R B (B:2, R:1), but the total number of stamps applied would be two (each stamp adds one R and B). So two stamps: 2 R and 2 B. But the segment has 2 B and 1 R. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of R and B in each segment must be even. Because each stamp adds one R and one B. But for example, the fifth test case's segment has 3 cells (B R B) which sum to 3. Each stamp adds 2 cells (R and B). So if there are two stamps, that's 4 cells. But in reality, overlapping stamps overwrite previous cells. So the sum approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by code structure:\n\nThe given code appends a 'W' to the end of the string. So, the code is splitting the string into segments between Ws. Then, the check function must process each segment and determine validity.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nIn main, after reading s, it appends a 'W'. Then, the check function is called.\n\nThe check function's current code has a loop from i=0 to n (since s is now length n+1, with the added W). The code in the check function is supposed to process the segments.\n\nThe current code is:\n\nlong long check(){\n    long long num1=0,num2=0;\n    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nThe variables num1 and num2 might be used to track something as we iterate through the string.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, the code is intended to track the segments between Ws. So, for each segment (sequence of non-W characters), we need to check the conditions.\n\nIn the code, the for loop iterates from i=0 to n (inclusive), which now includes the added W. So, when processing each character, when we hit a W, we can process the current segment (if any).\n\nSo, the code inside the loop might look something like:\n\nif (current character is W) {\n    if the current segment length is non-zero:\n        check if it's valid.\n        if invalid, return 0.\n    reset the current segment variables.\n} else {\n    add to the current segment.\n}\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMoreover, the code's variables num1 and num2 might be tracking the first and last characters of the segment, or the counts of R and B, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is keeping track of the current run's start and end, and when a W is encountered, it checks the run's validity.\n\nBut let's think: for each non-W segment:\n\n- The length must be >=2. If not, return invalid.\n\nBut also, there's another condition. For example, even if the length is >=2, the segment must be possible.\n\nWhat's that condition?\n\nAnother observation: In a valid segment, there must be at least one occurrence of R and B. Because each stamp creates one R and one B. However, applying multiple stamps can overwrite previous cells. But for a segment of all R's, how can that happen?\n\nFor example, a segment of RR. Can this be achieved?\n\nEach stamp applied to these two cells must be either BR or RB. But each stamp application sets them to BR or RB. So, applying BR once gives B R. Then, applying RB on them gives R B. Then, applying BR again gives B R. So, it's impossible to have both R and R. So a segment of RR is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, a segment of BB is invalid.\n\nBut what about a segment of RB? That's valid. Or BR. Or BRB (like the fifth test case).\n\nSo the key is that in each non-W segment, the colors must alternate between R and B. But in the sixth test case, the segment is RBB. How does that work?\n\nWait, the sixth test case's example is RBB. How is that possible?\n\nThe steps to create it are:\n\nOriginal: WWW.\n\nApply stamp to positions 2-3 as RB: W R B.\n\nThen apply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB: R B B.\n\nThe segment is R B B. So the first two are R and B, but the next two are B and B. So the third character is B, but the previous is B. So adjacent B's.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this is considered a valid configuration. So that suggests that the segment does not need to have alternating colors. So the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so why is RBB possible?\n\nBecause the last stamp applied to positions 1-2 (R and B) sets them to R and B (as RB), and the third position is already B from the previous stamp. So the final configuration is R B B.\n\nBut how can this be allowed? Because the stamp operations can overwrite previous colors. So, the third cell (originally B) was set to B by the first stamp, and no further stamps are applied to positions 2-3 again, so it remains B. So the pair 2-3 is B B. But according to the problem statement, this is allowed.\n\nThis suggests that the adjacent cells in the final configuration can be the same color as long as they were last set by a stamp that affects other pairs.\n\nSo, the initial approach of checking alternating colors is invalid. So, what's the correct approach?\n\nAlternative idea: For a segment to be valid, it must have at least one occurrence of R and B. Because each stamp introduces both colors. However, applying a stamp on a pair can overwrite previous colors, so the final segment can have any combination of R and B as long as:\n\n- The segment length is at least 2.\n\n- The segment contains at least one R and at least one B. Because each stamp operation introduces both colors. Wait, but in the sixth test case example, the final segment is RBB. It has R and B. So that's allowed.\n\nBut what about a segment of RR? How can that happen? Let's see.\n\nIf you have a segment of two cells. To make them RR, you would need to apply a stamp that sets them to RB, then apply another stamp that sets the left cell to R. But each stamp affects two cells. So:\n\nInitial: W W.\n\nApply stamp as RB: R B.\n\nThen apply stamp as RR? No, the stamp can only be RB or BR. So there's no way to set two cells to RR. So such a segment is invalid.\n\nThus, any segment of length 2 must be either RB or BR. If the segment is RR or BB, it's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for segments of length 3, like RBB:\n\nThe first stamp on positions 2-3 as RB (R B) \u2192 W R B.\n\nSecond stamp on positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B B.\n\nThus, the segment is RBB. This has two B's in a row. But the segment is valid.\n\nBut how can that be? Because the last stamp on positions 1-2 sets them to R and B, and the third cell remains B from the first stamp.\n\nSo, in this case, the segment has R, B, B. The third cell was not modified by any other stamp. So the segment can have consecutive B's.\n\nThis suggests that the key is not that the entire segment must alternate, but that each pair of adjacent cells in the segment must have at least one occurrence of being covered by a stamp. Wait, but in the example of RBB, the last two cells are B and B. How were they covered by a stamp?\n\nIn this example, the first stamp was on positions 2-3 (R B). Then the second stamp was on 1-2 (R B). The third cell is B. So the pair 2-3 was only stamped once, resulting in B. The pair 3-4 (if any) wasn't stamped. So the third cell's B is from the first stamp. So, in the final configuration, the last two cells are B and B. But there's no stamp that affects that pair. So, the problem allows this because the last two cells weren't stamped again, but the entire segment is built by overlapping stamps.\n\nThis suggests that the only necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W segments have length >=2.\n\n2. Each non-W segment contains at least one R and at least one B.\n\nBecause each stamp introduces one R and one B, and each non-W segment must be formed by some sequence of stamps, which would require at least one R and one B.\n\nWait, but in the sixth test case's example, the segment is RBB. So R is present once, B twice. So the counts are R:1, B:2. But each stamp adds one R and B. So applying two stamps would result in 2 R and 2 B. But in this case, the counts are 1 and 2. So the counts don't balance. So this suggests that the R and B counts are not necessarily equal. So the condition of having at least one R and B is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must have at least one R and one B. For example, a segment of BB is invalid (no R). A segment of RB is valid (has both), a segment of RBR is valid (has both), and so on.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All non-W segments must have length >=2.\n\n- All non-W segments must contain at least one R and at least one B.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then the answer is YES, otherwise NO.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nSample test case 2: n=2, s=WW. The answer is YES (no stamps needed). But according to the conditions, since there are no non-W segments, it's allowed.\n\nSample test case 3: n=2, s=RR. The segment has length 2, but no B. So the answer is NO.\n\nSample test case 4: n=2, s=RB. This has both R and B. So answer is YES.\n\nSample test case 5: BRB (n=3). It has B and R. So answer is YES.\n\nSample test case 6: RBB. It has R and B. So answer is YES.\n\nSample test case 7: WWW. Answer is YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, s=BR \u2192 allowed. s=BB \u2192 invalid.\n\nBut what about a segment like BRBRB (length 5, has B and R). So according to the conditions, it's allowed. Is that possible?\n\nYes. For example:\n\nStamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W W W.\n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 B R R B W.\n\nStamp 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R R B R.\n\nWait, but the final segment is B R R B R. That has two R's in a row. So according to the conditions, it's allowed because the segment has both R and B. But according to the earlier analysis, this should be allowed. So the conditions seem to hold.\n\nBut wait, how is this configuration possible?\n\nThe stamps applied would be:\n\nApply 1-2 BR \u2192 B R W W W.\n\nApply 2-3 RB \u2192 B R R B W.\n\nApply 3-4 BR \u2192 B R R B R.\n\nSo the final string is BRRBR. The segment is BRRBR. The pairs are BR, RR, RB, BR. The RR pair is allowed as per the problem statement. But how?\n\nBecause the last stamp applied to the pair 2-3 is RB, which sets them to R and B. But then, perhaps another stamp is applied to 3-4 as BR, which affects cell 3. So cell 3 could be overwritten.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. So perhaps the only conditions are the two mentioned: non-W segments must have length >=2 and contain both R and B.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n1. Split the string into non-W segments.\n\n2. For each such segment:\n\n   a. If length is 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\n   b. If all characters are same (e.g., RR or BBB) \u2192 invalid.\n\n3. If all segments are valid, return YES; else NO.\n\nSo the code inside check() should iterate through the string, track the current segment, and check these conditions.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nIn the provided code, the check() function loops from i=0 to n (inclusive). The string s has been appended with a 'W' in main. So each original character plus the added W is processed.\n\nThe variables num1 and num2 may track the start and end of the current segment, or the counts of R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is intended to track the current segment's start and end, and for each segment, check whether it has both R and B.\n\nLet's think. The code's variables are num1 and num2. Maybe they are counts of R and B in the current segment.\n\nSo, when we encounter a 'W', we check if the current segment is valid.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent_segment_length = 0\n\ncurrent_R = 0\n\ncurrent_B = 0\n\nfor each character in s:\n\n    if char is W:\n\n        if current_segment_length > 0:\n\n            if current_segment_length == 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\n            elif current_R == 0 or current_B == 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\n        reset current_segment_length, current_R, current_B.\n\n    else:\n\n        increment current_segment_length.\n\n        if char is R \u2192 current_R++\n\n        else \u2192 current_B++\n\nSo, this would check for each segment whether it's valid.\n\nThus, the code in the check() function's loop should:\n\n- For each character in s (including the added W):\n\n   - if the character is W:\n\n      - check if there's a current segment (current_segment_length >0)\n\n      - if current_segment_length is 1 \u2192 invalid (return 0)\n\n      - else if current_R ==0 or current_B ==0 \u2192 invalid (return 0)\n\n      - reset counters.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - increment current_segment_length.\n\n      - increment current_R or current_B based on the character.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nlong long check() {\n    long long current_length = 0;\n    long long current_R = 0, current_B = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n        if (s[i] == 'W') {\n            if (current_length > 0) {\n                if (current_length == 1) {\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                if (current_R == 0 || current_B == 0) {\n                    return 0;\n                }\n            }\n            current_length = 0;\n            current_R = 0;\n            current_B = 0;\n        } else {\n            current_length++;\n            if (s[i] == 'R') {\n                current_R++;\n            } else {\n                current_B++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nBut the original code has variables num1 and num2. Maybe they are current_R and current_B.\n\nThe original code in the check() function has:\n\nlong long num1=0,num2=0;\n\nSo, perhaps num1 is current_R and num2 is current_B. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, the code inside the loop would be:\n\nif (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n   if (current_length > 0) {\n\n      if (current_length == 1 \u2192 return 0.\n\n      if (num1 == 0 || num2 ==0 \u2192 return 0.\n\n   }\n\n   reset num1, num2, current_length.\n\n} else {\n\n   current_length++.\n\n   if s[i] == 'R', increment num1, else increment num2.\n\n}\n\nBut in the code, the variables are num1 and num2, which are initialized to 0 at each call.\n\nSo, the code should look like this:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n   if (num1 + num2 > 0) { // meaning current segment length is num1 + num2 (since each character is either R or B)\n\n      if (num1 + num2 == 1) {\n\n          return 0;\n\n      }\n\n      if (num1 ==0 || num2 ==0) {\n\n          return 0;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   num1 = 0;\n\n   num2 = 0;\n\n} else {\n\n   if (s[i] == 'R') {\n\n       num1++;\n\n   } else {\n\n       num2++;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, but num1 and num2 are counts of R and B in the current segment. When we hit a W, we check if the sum of num1 and num2 (current segment length) is >=2, and whether both are non-zero.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <=n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n        // Check current segment\n\n        int len = num1 + num2;\n\n        if (len > 0) {\n\n            if (len == 1) {\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n            if (num1 ==0 || num2 ==0) {\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // Reset counters\n\n        num1 = 0;\n\n        num2 = 0;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (s[i] == 'R') {\n\n            num1++;\n\n        } else {\n\n            num2++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nreturn 1;\n\n}\n\nThis code would check that each non-W segment has length >=2 and contains at least one R and one B.\n\nSo, the variables num1 and num2 are counts of R and B in the current segment.\n\nSo, the missing code in the check function is this logic.\n\nBut how to fill this into the existing code.\n\nThe original code's check function has the loop with i from 0 to n, and the variables num1 and num2 are initialized to 0.\n\nSo, the code inside the loop should be:\n\nif (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n    if (num1 + num2 >0) { // current segment is non-empty\n\n        if (num1 + num2 ==1) return 0;\n\n        if (num1 ==0 || num2 ==0) return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    num1 = 0;\n\n    num2 = 0;\n\n} else {\n\n    if (s[i] == 'R') num1++;\n\n    else num2++;\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif (s[i] == 'W') {\n    if (num1 + num2 > 0) {\n        if (num1 + num2 == 1) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (num1 == 0 || num2 == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    num1 = 0;\n    num2 = 0;\n} else {\n    if (s[i] == 'R') {\n        num1++;\n    } else {\n        num2++;\n    }\n}\n\nSo, the code inside the loop checks for W, processes the current segment, and resets counters. For non-W characters, increments R or B count.\n\nSo, putting this into the code.\n\nThe original code in the check function's loop is:\n\nfor(int i=0;i<=n;i++){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nSo, the missing code is:\n\nif(s[i] == 'W') {\n\n    if(num1 + num2 > 0) {\n\n        if(num1 + num2 ==1) {\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n        if(num1 ==0 || num2 ==0) {\n\n            return 0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    num1=0;\n\n    num2=0;\n\n} else {\n\n    if(s[i] == 'R') {\n\n        num1++;\n\n    } else {\n\n        num2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, this is the code that needs to be filled in.\n\nSo, the answer is the code inside the for loop."
