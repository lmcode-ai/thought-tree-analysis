Because each stamp application on those two cells would set them to either BR or RB. So how can you get two B's? Wait, perhaps if the segment is part of a longer sequence. For example, consider a segment of three cells. Let's say BBB. How can that happen? Each stamp application covers two cells, but overlapping. Let's see. Suppose the initial cells are WWW.",

So maybe the code's logic is correct. But wait, in the example where the segment is \"RBR\", which has R and B, but perhaps cannot be formed. Let me try again. Wait, let's think of the possible parity. Each stamp application affects two cells. The order of application can affect the result. But perhaps there's a parity condition. For example, each cell's color depends on the number of times it's covered in a stamp. Let's model this as follows:\n\nEach cell can be part of multiple stamps. For example, cell i can be part of a stamp on i-1 and i, or i and i+1.",

So the code would look like:\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\") Wait, but this is incorrect. Because in Python, the else clause is part of the for loop. So the code would loop through each i in temp. For each i, if it's non-empty and (lacks B or R), then print NO and break.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this Python code to determine if a given string can be formed using the stamp operations described. The code as provided has a loop over the test cases and processes the string s by stripping W's and splitting on W's. Then, for each non-empty segment in temp (which are the parts between W's), it checks if 'B' is not in i or 'R' not in i. If that's the case, there's a TODO. Otherwise, it prints YES.\n\nHmm. The problem says that each stamp application affects two adjacent cells, turning them into RB or BR. Also, each use of the stamp can be applied multiple times, which means the colors can flip each time. For example, applying RB once would turn two white cells to RB. Applying the same stamp again would flip them back to WB (wait, no, because each application is a recolor. Wait, how does the stamp work when applied multiple times? The problem says each usage recolors both cells. So each stamp application toggles the colors according to the stamp. Wait, maybe it's better to model the problem as each stamp application can be thought of as adding the pattern BR or RB to the cells. But since the cells can be overwritten multiple times, the order of applying the stamps matters.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: the stamp changes two adjacent cells. Each application must be a pair of cells. Each application can be either BR or RB. And each application affects those two cells by setting them to that pair. So applying a stamp in the same place multiple times can toggle between BR and RB. For example, applying BR once gives BR, applying BR again would set it again to BR (no change?), wait no. Wait, each application of the stamp sets those two cells to the current orientation. So if you apply BR once, they are BR. If you apply RB (same two cells, reversed), then they become RB. But the stamp can be applied in any order. So the final color depends on the parity of the number of times each orientation is applied. For example, applying BR once and RB once would result in BR after the first and then RB after the second. But if you apply BR twice, it's still BR. Wait, no. Each application overwrites the colors. So each time you apply a stamp, the two cells become exactly the pattern of the stamp. So if you apply BR, then RB, the first two cells are first BR, then RB. So each stamp application is a direct assignment. But the problem allows applying the stamp multiple times to the same cells, so the final color depends on the last stamp applied that covers those cells. But that's not right. Because the problem states that each usage of the stamp recolors both cells under the stamp. So if a cell is part of multiple stamps, each application changes its color according to the stamp's orientation. For example, if a cell is first part of a BR stamp (so becomes B then R), and then part of a RB stamp (so becomes R then B?), but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have two cells. The first stamp is BR: cell 1 becomes B, cell 2 becomes R. Then, applying the same BR stamp again: cell 1 becomes B again, cell 2 becomes R again. So it's the same as the first application. So applying the same stamp even multiple times doesn't change the result. However, if after the first BR, you apply RB to the same two cells, then cell 1 becomes R, cell 2 becomes B. So each application of a stamp on a pair of cells overwrites their colors. Thus, the order of applying stamps matters, but the key is that each stamp application can be thought of as setting the two cells to the specific colors of the stamp's orientation.\n\nBut how can this process create the target pattern? The problem requires that after some number of stamp applications (possibly zero), the target string is achieved.\n\nSo, the main question is: what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given string to be achievable using these stamps?\n\nLet's think about the possible conditions. \n\nFirst, all white cells (W) must be possible. But the initial state is all white. To have some W in the final string, those cells must have never been stamped. Because once a cell is part of a stamp, it becomes either R or B. So any cell that is W in the final must not be part of any stamp application. Therefore, all the non-W characters in the target must form contiguous segments where each segment is between W's, and each such segment must have been formed by stamp applications. Also, each such segment must have even length? Wait, no. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So each segment of non-W characters must have at least two characters? Wait, no. For example, if the target is \"RB\", that's possible. But if the target is \"R\", then no, because each stamp must cover two cells. So any single non-W cell is impossible. So the first condition is that any non-W segment must have length at least 2. Because each stamp covers two cells. So if there's a segment of length 1, like \"R\" between two W's, that's impossible. But wait, what if there's a segment like \"RB\"? That's possible. So the code's current approach is to split the string into parts separated by W's. For each of these parts (segments of non-W), they must meet certain conditions.\n\nSo the first check is: for each segment (after splitting on W's and stripping leading and trailing W's), the segment must have length >= 2. Otherwise, it's impossible. For example, a segment of length 1 can't be formed by any stamps. So in the code, when processing each i in temp (the list after splitting on W's), if i is non-empty (i.e., a segment), then if it's length 1, then that's invalid. Also, the code's current check is if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i. Hmm. So for example, if the segment is all R's, like \"RRR\", then 'B' is not present. So this condition would trigger, meaning the segment is invalid.\n\nSo the code is checking that each segment (non-W) must have at least one B and one R. Because if a segment is all B's, then how could that be achieved? Let's think. Each stamp application must set two adjacent cells to either BR or RB. Suppose you have a segment of all B's. For example, BB. How can that happen?\n\nWait, the initial state is all white. Suppose you apply a stamp to the two cells as BR: then they become B and R. Then apply BR again: they remain B and R. If you apply RB, then they become R and B. So to get BB, maybe it's impossible. Because each stamp application on those two cells would set them to either BR or RB. So how can you get two B's?\n\nWait, perhaps if the segment is part of a longer sequence. For example, consider a segment of three cells. Let's say BBB. How can that happen? Each stamp application covers two cells, but overlapping. Let's see. Suppose the initial cells are WWW. First, apply the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR: now BRW. Then apply the stamp to positions 2-3 as BR: so B becomes R, W becomes B. So the sequence becomes R, B, B. Wait, no. Wait, each stamp application affects two cells. So the first application on 1-2 sets them to BR. So positions 1 is B, 2 is R. Then applying BR on 2-3: position 2 becomes B, position 3 becomes R. So now the sequence is B, B, R. Then applying BR on 3-4 (if there is one), etc. Hmm, but in this case, how can we get BBB? Maybe it's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that each segment must contain both R and B. Because each stamp application introduces both colors. So any segment that is all R or all B cannot be achieved. So that's why the code checks if in a segment, 'B' not present or 'R' not present. If so, then that segment is impossible. Hence, the code's current check is: if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i, then output NO. But wait, the code has a loop over each i in temp, and if any of them is non-empty, and in that segment, either B or R is missing, then it's invalid. The code then prints NO. Otherwise, prints YES. But in the code, the code is in the 'for i in temp' loop, and in each iteration, if i is non-empty and 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i, then it does something (the TODO part) which probably sets a flag to output NO. But the code as written is incomplete. The original code's TODO is where the check for these conditions should be handled. \n\nSo the code's current logic is:\n\nAfter splitting the string into parts separated by W's, for each part:\n\n- if the part is non-empty (i.e., a segment of non-W), check if it contains both B and R. If any segment fails this check, then the answer is NO. Otherwise, all segments are valid, so answer is YES.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient. Because even if a segment has both B and R, it's possible that it's impossible to form. For example, consider the segment \"BRB\". Let's see:\n\nn=3, s=BRB. Split into [\"BRB\"]. So the code checks that 'B' and 'R' are present. So according to the current code, it would return YES. But can it be formed?\n\nInitial state is WWW. Let's see:\n\nStamping positions 1-2 as BR: becomes BRW. Then stamping positions 2-3 as RB: so position 2 becomes R (from previous R to B?), wait no. Wait, each stamp application sets the two cells to the stamp's pattern. So after first stamp on 1-2: BRW. Then stamping 2-3 as RB: position 2 becomes R, position 3 becomes B. So the string is BRB. Yes. So this is possible. So the code's logic would correctly accept this case.\n\nAnother example: the segment is \"RBR\". Let's see. Can this be formed?\n\nInitial WWW. Stamp 1-2 as RB: RBW. Then stamp 2-3 as BR: the second cell (B) becomes R, third becomes B. So the string is RRB. Not RBR. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe another approach. Let me think. Wait, maybe stamp 1-2 as RB (RBW), then stamp 1-2 as BR (BRW), then stamp 2-3 as RB. So after first step: RBW. Second step: BRW. Third step: B RB. So the string becomes B R B. Wait, that's BRB. Not RBR. Hmm. Maybe this is possible via a different sequence.\n\nAlternatively, stamp 2-3 as BR first. Then stamp 1-2 as BR. Let's see: initial WWW. After stamp 2-3 as BR: W BR. Then stamp 1-2 as BR: BR R. So the string is BR R. So BRR. Not RBR. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe RBR is possible. Let's try another approach. Maybe stamping 1-2 as RB (RBW), then stamp 1-2 as BR (B R W), then stamp 2-3 as BR (B becomes R, W becomes B). So the string becomes R R B. No, that's RRB. Not RBR. Hmm. Maybe RBR is not possible. Wait, but according to the code's logic, since the segment has both R and B, it would accept it. But maybe it's impossible. So there's a flaw in the code's logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's current conditions are not sufficient. So the code as written would return YES for segments that have both R and B, but maybe some of those segments cannot be formed. Therefore, the code is incomplete and needs additional checks.\n\nSo what other conditions are necessary?\n\nAnother example: the segment is \"RRB\". So split into [\"RRB\"]. The code checks that it has R and B. So returns YES. Is it possible?\n\nYes. For example, initial WWW. Stamp 1-2 as RB: RBW. Then stamp 1-2 as RB again (no change). Then stamp 2-3 as RB: R becomes B, W becomes R. So the string becomes R B R. Wait, no. Wait, the stamp on 2-3 as RB would set cell 2 to R, cell 3 to B. Wait, no. Wait, the stamp is RB. So applying it to cells 2-3 would set cell 2 to R, cell 3 to B. So after first stamp (cells 1-2 RB: R B W), then stamp cells 2-3 RB: cell 2 becomes R, cell 3 becomes B. So the string becomes R R B. So RRB is possible. So code's logic works here.\n\nHmm. So maybe the code's logic is correct. But wait, in the example where the segment is \"RBR\", which has R and B, but perhaps cannot be formed. Let me try again.\n\nWait, let's think of the possible parity. Each stamp application affects two cells. The order of application can affect the result. But perhaps there's a parity condition. For example, each cell's color depends on the number of times it's covered in a stamp. Let's model this as follows:\n\nEach cell can be part of multiple stamps. For example, cell i can be part of a stamp on i-1 and i, or i and i+1. Each time a cell is part of a stamp, its color is set according to the stamp's orientation. But since stamps can be applied in any order, the final color depends on the last stamp that affects the cell. So perhaps the parity of the number of stamps applied to the cell's position is important. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the entire segment must start with either R or B and alternate colors. Wait, but the example given in the problem statement has BRBBW, which is B followed by R, B, B. So the B and B are consecutive. So that's possible. So that approach is not correct.\n\nWait, maybe the parity of the number of stamps applied on each pair of cells. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the possible transitions. Each time a pair of adjacent cells is stamped, their colors are set to either BR or RB. So each stamp on a pair (i, i+1) can set them to BR or RB. So the problem is to find a way to apply these stamps such that the final colors are the target string.\n\nBut how can this be modeled?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that each pair of adjacent non-W cells must have opposite colors. But this is not the case. For example, in the example BRBBW, the third and fourth cells are both B, but they were stamped as part of overlapping pairs.\n\nSo that idea is not correct.\n\nWait, let's think of the process as a series of operations. Each stamp application can be used in any order. So the key is that the colors must form a chain where each transition between adjacent cells could have been set by some stamp. But since stamps can overwrite previous changes, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that each consecutive pair of non-W cells in the target must have been set by a stamp in one of the two possible orientations. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows:\n\nFor a segment of non-W cells, each cell (except the first) must have been part of a stamp with the previous cell, and each cell (except the last) must have been part of a stamp with the next cell. But this seems a bit vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the parity of the length of the segment matters. For example, even-length segments are possible, but odd-length require certain conditions. Or perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first and last characters of the segment must be different. For example, in a segment of length 2, it must be either BR or RB. But the sample input includes a segment of length 3, like BRB, which is possible. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This seems complicated. Let's think again about the code's current logic. The code splits the string into segments separated by W's, strips leading and trailing W's. For each segment, if it's non-empty, check that it contains at least one R and at least one B. If any segment fails this check, output NO. Otherwise, output YES.\n\nBut the sample input includes test case 7, which is all W's, which would split into an empty list, hence output YES. That's correct.\n\nAnother sample input is \"B\", which would split into [\"B\"], which is a segment of length 1 and missing R. So the code would output NO. That's correct.\n\nBut there's another case where the code's logic may not be sufficient. For example, consider a segment of length 2: \"BB\". According to the code's logic, since it has B but no R, it would output NO. Which is correct, because a segment of two B's is impossible. Because each stamp application on the two cells would set them to either BR or RB. So to get BB, you would need to apply a stamp that sets both to B, which isn't possible. So the code's check for B and R in the segment is correct here.\n\nBut what about a segment of even length where some parts have R and B, but the arrangement is not possible. For example, \"RBRB\" is even, has both R and B. That's possible. But what about \"RBBR\"? Let's see.\n\nHow can \"RBBR\" be achieved? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the segment is four cells. Let's think of the steps. Starting with WWWW.\n\n1. Apply BR to positions 1-2: BRWW.\n2. Apply BR to positions 3-4: BRWW -> BR RB. So now BRBR.\nWait, no. Applying BR to 3-4 changes them to BR. So the sequence is BRBR. Then, apply BR to 2-3: positions 2 becomes R, 3 becomes B. So sequence is B R B R. Then, apply BR to 2-3 again: positions 2 and 3 become BR. So sequence is B B R R. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get RBBR.\n\nAlternatively, let's try:\n\nApply RB to positions 1-2: RBWW.\n\nApply BR to positions 2-3: so position 2 becomes B, 3 becomes R. Now R B R W.\n\nApply BR to positions 3-4: R B R B.\n\nBut the sequence is R B R B. Not RBBR.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is not possible. So the code's current logic would accept it (since it has R and B), but it's actually impossible. So the code's logic is incomplete.\n\nThis suggests that there's another condition that needs to be checked. So the initial approach of just checking that each segment has at least one R and B is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nSo what's the missing condition?\n\nAnother idea: For each segment, the first and last characters must be different. Wait, in the sample example, the fifth test case has s=BRB. The first character is B, last is B. But that's possible. Wait, no. Wait the fifth test case in the note is:\n\nSample Input 5:\n\nn=3, s=BRB. The code's logic would split into [\"BRB\"], which contains B and R. So code returns YES, which is correct because it can be formed.\n\nSo that idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parity of the number of R's and B's in the segment must satisfy certain conditions. For example, the sum of R and B in the segment must be even. But no, in the example BRB (length 3), sum is 3, which is odd.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of the parity of the positions. Each stamp application affects two adjacent cells. So each cell's color depends on whether it was the left or right part of the stamp in its last application. For example, the left cell in a BR stamp is B, the right is R. The left cell in an RB stamp is R, right is B. So, each time a cell is part of a stamp, its color is determined by the stamp's orientation. The key observation is that each cell's color is determined by the parity of the number of times it was the left or right part of a stamp.\n\nAlternatively, think of each cell as being covered by some number of stamps. Each stamp that covers cell i can be either as the left part (stamp starting at i) or as the right part (stamp starting at i-1). For example, if a stamp is applied to i and i+1, then cell i is the left part of the stamp. If a stamp is applied to i-1 and i, then cell i is the right part.\n\nIf a cell is covered as the left part in a stamp, its color is set to either B or R, depending on the stamp's orientation. Similarly for the right part.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think differently. Suppose that for a given segment of non-W cells, each cell's color must alternate between B and R. Because each time a stamp is applied, the two cells are set to BR or RB. So, in the segment, the colors must alternate. For example, BRBR, or BBRB (no, that's not alternating). Wait, but the sample input includes BRBB, which has consecutive B's. How is that possible?\n\nWait, in the example given in the problem statement:\n\nThe final picture is B R B B W. The steps are:\n\nWWWWW \u2192 WWRBW \u2192 BRRBW \u2192 BRBBW.\n\nSo the third step is applying the stamp to positions 3-4 (assuming 1-based). Let's see:\n\nAfter the second step, the string is BRRBW. Then, applying the stamp to positions 3-4 as RB (R and B). So positions 3 and 4 become R and B. So the string becomes BR R B W \u2192 BRBBW. Wait, no. Wait the third and fourth cells are set to RB. So after that step, the string is BR RB W \u2192 BRBBW. So the third cell is B, fourth cell is B. So two consecutive B's. But how? Because the stamp applied to positions 3-4 is RB, so cell 3 becomes R and cell 4 becomes B. Wait, no. If the stamp is applied as RB, then the left cell is R and the right cell is B. So positions 3 and 4 become R and B. But in the example, the fourth cell is B. So after applying the stamp, positions 3 and 4 are R and B, but in the example's final state, it's B. Hmm, perhaps the example steps in the problem description are different. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the problem statement's example:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nWWWWW \u2192 WWRBW (applied stamp to positions 3-4 as RB? Or 2-3 as RB? Wait the example says:\n\nFirst step: WWWWW \u2192 WWRBW (underline WWRBW). Wait the first stamp is applied to positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but perhaps the example is using 1-based. So first step: apply the stamp to positions 3-4 (1-based) as RB. So cells 3 and 4 become R and B. So string becomes WW RB W. Then the next steps.\n\nWait, but the example's explanation says:\n\nSecond step: apply BR to positions 1-2. So the first two cells (WW) become BR. So now it's BR RB W. Then third step applies RB to positions 3-4 (third and fourth cells), which are RB, so they become RB again (no change). Then the fourth step applies RB to positions 2-3: cells 2 and 3 (R and R) become RB. So cell 2 becomes R, cell 3 becomes B. So the string becomes B R B B W.\n\nAh, here's the key. Applying the stamp multiple times can overwrite previous colors. So consecutive B's are possible if a stamp is applied to a pair where the left cell is B and the right is R, but then another stamp is applied to the right cell and the next one, changing the right cell again.\n\nBut this complicates the conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n1. All segments of non-W characters have length >= 2.\n\n2. Each segment contains at least one R and one B.\n\nBut according to the previous example where a segment is \"BB\", which is invalid, the code's current logic correctly identifies this. But the code's current logic splits the string into segments, and for each segment, checks if it's non-empty and contains at least one R and B. So if any segment doesn't meet this, output NO. Otherwise, YES.\n\nBut according to this logic, a segment like \"RBR\" (which contains R and B) would be considered valid. But is that possible?\n\nLet's see. Can \"RBR\" be formed?\n\nThe segment is of length 3. Let's think of possible steps.\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB: RB W.\n\nThen apply stamp to 2-3 as BR: the second cell becomes B, third becomes R. So now R B R. So yes, this is possible. So the code's logic is correct here. So the code's current logic is correct.\n\nAnother example: segment is \"RBBR\". Length 4.\n\nCan this be formed?\n\nLet's try:\n\nStart with WWWW.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB: RBWW.\n\nApply stamp to 3-4 as BR: RBWW becomes RB BR. Now the string is R B B R. So yes. So code's logic would accept this. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code's current logic seems to be correct. So the missing code is when a segment is non-empty and either R or B is not present, then we need to output \"NO\".\n\nSo in the code, after splitting into temp, for each i in temp:\n\nif i is non-empty and (B not in i or R not in i) \u2192 output NO and break.\n\nOtherwise, after processing all segments, output YES.\n\nBut in the current code, the code is written as:\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nIn the TODO part, we need to set a flag to indicate that the answer is NO and break. Then, after checking all segments, if none of them failed, output YES.\n\nSo the code as written has a for loop over temp. For each segment i in temp:\n\nif the segment is non-empty and (lacks B or lacks R), then output NO and break.\n\nBut the code currently uses a for loop and then an else clause. The else clause is attached to the for loop, which means that if the loop completes normally (i.e., without breaking), then the else block is executed, which prints YES.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    s = s.strip(\"W\")\n    temp = s.split('W')\n    valid = True\n    for part in temp:\n        if part:\n            if 'B' not in part or 'R' not in part:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the original code in the user's code is:\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            # TODO: Your code here\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut in Python, the else clause after a for loop is executed only if the loop didn't break. So in the user's code, after looping through all elements in temp, if none of them caused a break, then the else block is executed (print YES). But the current code's TODO is in the case where a segment is invalid. So inside the if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i, the code needs to print NO and break. So the code would look like:\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but this is incorrect. Because in Python, the else clause is part of the for loop. So the code would loop through each i in temp. For each i, if it's non-empty and (lacks B or R), then print NO and break. If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., all segments are valid), then the else clause is executed, printing YES.\n\nBut the code has to handle multiple test cases. The original code is:\n\nfor i in range(t):\n    n=int(input())\n    s=input()\n    s=s.strip(\"W\")\n    temp=list(s.split('W'))\n\n    for i in temp:\n        if i:\n            if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nBut the 'else' here is part of the for loop over temp. So if during the loop over temp, any of the segments causes a break (like print NO and break), then the else clause is not executed. Otherwise, after processing all segments, print YES.\n\nSo the code should be modified as follows: inside the loop over temp, if a segment is invalid, print NO and break. Else, after all segments, print YES.\n\nSo in the TODO part, the code should print NO and break. But also, after breaking, the code should not proceed to the else clause.\n\nSo the correct code would be:\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nThis works because:\n\n- For each test case, after processing the string into temp, the code loops through each segment in temp.\n\n- For each segment, if it's non-empty and lacks either B or R, then print NO and break out of the loop.\n\n- If all segments are processed without breaking (i.e., all are valid), then the else clause is executed, printing YES.\n\nSo the missing code is the print(\"NO\") and break statements inside the if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i block.\n\nBut in the original code, the code is written as:\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            # TODO: Your code here\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nSo the TODO is to add code that prints NO and breaks out of the loop. Because if any segment is invalid, the answer is NO, and we need to exit the loop and proceed to the next test case.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut how to ensure that after breaking, the code doesn't print YES. Because the else clause is attached to the for loop, so if the for loop breaks (via the break statement inside the if block), then the else clause is not executed. Otherwise, after the loop finishes normally, the else clause is executed (print YES).\n\nSo the code is correct as:\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut in the code provided by the user, the loop over temp uses the variable 'i' again, but in Python, this is allowed because the outer loop variable is also 'i' (the loop for i in range(t)). However, in Python, the inner loop variable will overwrite the outer loop variable, which can cause bugs. But in the user's code, it's written as:\n\nfor i in temp:\n\nBut the outer loop is:\n\nfor i in range(t):\n\nSo during the inner loop, i is each segment in temp. But after the inner loop, the outer loop's i is lost. So this is a bug in the code. The outer loop variable should not be named 'i' if the inner loop also uses 'i'. So the code as provided by the user has a bug here. The code should use a different variable name for the inner loop.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the code to be completed is the one given, and the user must fill in the missing parts, not fix variable name conflicts. However, the original code may have a bug here.\n\nBut in the code provided by the user, the outer loop is:\n\nfor i in range(t):\n\nThen, inside that loop, the code does:\n\ns = input()\ns = s.strip(\"W\")\ntemp = list(s.split('W'))\n\nfor i in temp:\n    if i:\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            # TODO\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nHere, the inner loop uses the variable 'i' again. This is a problem because the outer loop variable 'i' (from for i in range(t)) will be overwritten by the inner loop's 'i'. So after the inner loop, the variable 'i' will refer to the last element of temp, not the test case index. However, in this code, since after the inner loop, there is no further use of 'i', perhaps it's not a problem. But it's a bad practice. However, the code to be completed is as provided, and we need to fill in the missing part.\n\nSo the correct code to be added is, in the TODO section, print(\"NO\") and break. So when any segment is invalid, the code prints NO, breaks out of the inner loop, and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, after all segments, it prints YES.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nprint(\"NO\")\nbreak\n\nBut this must be placed inside the if block. So the code after filling in would look like:\n\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut in Python, the break statement here will exit the for loop over temp. Then, since the loop was broken, the else clause (print \"YES\") is not executed. Then, the code proceeds to the next test case.\n\nTherefore, the correct code is adding those two lines.\n\nThus, the answer is to insert those two lines in the TODO section."
