The divisions are based on the rating ranges. The input is multiple test cases. For each test case, read the rating and output the division. The divisions are:\n- Division 1: rating >= 1900\n- Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n- Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n- Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the way the problem describes the divisions. Let me check again. Yes, Division 2 is between 1600 and 1899 inclusive. Division 3 is 1400 to 1599 inclusive. Division 4 is anything <=1399.
