For example, if (t1 - t2) is 1 mod 2, then we need (k2 -k1) mod 2 to be 1. Which is possible by choosing k2 =k1 +1, but since they can be any number of operations, including zero. Wait, but how?",

For example, if (t1 -t2) is 0 mod 2, then (k2 -k1) mod 2 must be 0. So we can set k1 =k2. Then (t1 +k1) = t1 +k1, and (t2 +k2) = t2 +k1. So the difference between these two is (t1 -t2) mod 2. But if (t1 -t2) mod 2 is zero, then they are equal. So in that case, we can choose k1 =k2 (any value), and the parities will match. But if (t1 -t2) mod 2 is 1, then (k2 -k1) mod 2 must be 1. Which can be achieved by setting k2 =k1 +1. Then the difference is 1 mod 2. So in that case, (t1 +k1) and (t2 +k2) would be t1 +k1 and t2 +k1 +1. The difference is (t1 -t2) +1. If (t1 -t2) is 1, then this becomes 1+1=2, which mod 2 is 0. So (t1 +k1) and (t2 +k1+1) mod 2 would be (t1 +k1) mod 2 and (t2 +k1 +1) mod 2. So (t1 +k1) mod 2 = (t2 +k1 +1) mod 2. Which implies (t1 - t2 -1) mod 2 =0. But if (t1 -t2) is 1 mod 2, then (t1 -t2 -1) is 0 mod 2. So this works. So regardless of the initial t1 and t2, we can choose k1 and k2 such that the parities of the even and odd groups are the same.

So if their original parities are the same, then this would work. But if some are even and others are odd originally, then after adding k1, they can't all have the same parity.

So the input for the second test case is n=2, a=[2,1]. Wait, the code's sample input may be different. Let me check the problem's note again. Wait, the note for the second test case says that after any operations, can't make all elements same parity. Let's think: \n\nSuppose the array is [2,1]. Then even indices (0-based 0) is 2 (even), odd index (1) is 1 (odd). Even group's parity is 0 (t1=0). Odd group's parity is 1 (t2=1). So checkArray would check if all even indices have parity 0 (yes), and all odd indices have parity 1 (yes). So returns true. Then, according to the code, the answer is YES, but according to the problem's note, it's NO. But this can't be. Wait, but in this case, can we choose k1 and k2 to make even and odd groups have the same parity? Even group's parity after k1 operations: (0 +k1) mod2. Odd group's parity after k2 operations: (1 +k2) mod2. We need (0 +k1) \u2261 (1 +k2) mod2 \u2192 k1 -k2 \u22611 mod2. Possible. For example, k1=1, k2=0. Then even group becomes (0+1)=1, odd group becomes (1+0)=1. So all elements are odd. So answer is YES. But according to the problem's note, this case's answer is NO.",

So the answer would be YES. So that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the second test case's array is [1,3]. Then, even indices (0-based 0) is 1 (odd), odd indices (1) is 3 (odd). So checkArray would return true. But then we can choose k1=0, k2=0. All are odd. So answer is YES. Alternatively, perhaps the second test case has array [1,2,3,4]. Then, even indices (0, 2) are 1 and 3 (both odd), odd indices (1,3) are 2 and4 (even). So checkArray returns true. Then, to make all even: choose k1=1 (even indices become even), k2=1 (odd indices become even). So (1+1) mod2=0 for even, (0+1) mod2=1 for odd. Not equal. Wait, no. Let me see: even indices are 1 and 3. Adding k1=1: their parities become even (1+1=2, 3+1=4). So even indices' parities are 0. Odd indices: 2 and4. Adding k2=0: parities remain 0. So even group is 0, odd group is 0. All elements even. So answer is YES. So why would the problem's second test case have a NO answer? Ah, maybe the array is [1,2,3,5]. Even indices: 1,3 (both odd). Odd indices: 2 (even),5 (odd). So the second loop would check if all odd indices have parity equal to t2=2%2=0. The third element in odd indices is 5 (index 3), which is 5%2=1. So checkArray returns false, hence answer is NO. Ah, right. So in this case, the code would return false. But in the problem's note, the second test case's array is not provided. But according to the code, the checkArray function returns true if all even indices have same parity and all odd indices have same parity. So when the code returns true, it's possible to adjust k1 and k2 to make the entire array same parity. But when checkArray returns false, it's not possible. But according to the code, the second test case's code would return true, but the problem's note says it returns NO. So there's a contradiction. So what's wrong here? Ah, wait, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect. Because even if all even indices have same parity and all odd indices have same parity, it's possible that it's impossible to choose k1 and k2 such that (t1 +k1) mod2 == (t2 +k2) mod2. Wait, no. Because (t1 +k1) mod2 and (t2 +k2) mod2 can be made equal by choosing appropriate k1 and k2. Because k1 and k2 can be any numbers. For example, if t1 is 0 and t2 is 0. Then, (0 +k1) mod2 must equal (0 +k2) mod2. So k1 and k2 must be of the same parity. But this is possible (k1=0, k2=0). If t1 is 1 and t2 is 0. Then, (1 +k1) mod2 must equal (0 +k2) mod2. So (k1 -k2) mod2 = (0 -1) mod2 = 1. So k1 -k2 must be 1 mod2. This is possible (e.g., k1=1, k2=0). So in this case, the code's checkArray returns true, and the answer is YES. But the problem's second test case's answer is NO. So this suggests that the code's check is incorrect, but according to the code's logic, the answer is YES. So there's a mistake in the code's logic. Ah! Wait, perhaps the code's check is correct, but the problem's note has a different example. Maybe the second test case in the problem's note is not covered by the code's logic. But how can that be? Let's re-examine the problem's note.",

But according to previous reasoning, this is always possible. But what if t1 and t2 are 0 and 1. Then, we can choose k1=1, k2=0. Then even group parity is 0+1=1, odd group parity is 1+0=1. So yes. So why would the problem's second test case return NO? Ah, perhaps the array is [2,1]. Let's see: even indices (0) is 2 (parity 0). Odd indices (1) is 1 (parity 1). So checkArray returns true. Then, we can choose k1=1 and k2=0. Even group parity: 0+1=1. Odd group parity:1+0=1. So all elements have parity 1 (odd). So answer is YES. So the code's logic would return YES, which contradicts the problem's note. But according to the problem's note, the second test case's answer is NO. So this indicates that either the code's logic is wrong, or the problem's note's test case has a different array. Alternatively, perhaps the code's logic is missing a condition.",

We need to find k1 and k2 such that (0 +k1) mod2 == (1 +k2) mod2. Which is k1 -k2 mod2 == 1. So for example, k1=1, k2=0: (0+1)=1 mod2, (1+0)=1 mod2. So all elements are odd.",

But according to the problem's note, there exists a test case where even and odd groups are homogeneous, but the answer is NO. Thus, there's a contradiction. So what's wrong here? Ah, perhaps the code's logic is missing a check that the required parity can be achieved. Wait, suppose that all even indices are even and all odd indices are even. Then, answer is YES. If all even indices are even and all odd indices are odd. Then, we can choose k1=1 (even indices become odd), k2=0 (odd indices stay odd). So all elements are odd. If all even indices are even and all odd indices are even. Then, answer is YES. If all even indices are odd and all odd indices are even. Then, choose k1=1 (even indices become even), k2=1 (odd indices become odd). Then, even and odd are even and odd again. No. Wait, no. Wait, even indices are odd (t1=1). We can add k1=1: even indices become 1+1=2, even. Odd indices are even (t2=0). Add k2=0: remain even. So even group is even, odd group is even. All even. So yes. So in all cases where even and odd groups are homogeneous, it's possible to make the entire array have the same parity. But according to the problem's note, there's a case where this is impossible. So there must be a mistake in the problem's note, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether we can make all elements of an array have the same parity (all even or all odd) after performing any number of two types of operations. The operations are adding 1 to all odd indices or even indices. Wait, the indices here\u2014are they 1-based or 0-based? Because in programming, arrays are 0-based. But looking at the code provided, in the checkArray function, the first loop is for i starting at 0, stepping by 2. So the code treats the indices as 0-based. So the first element is index 0 (odd index as per the problem's description?), but the problem's first operation is adding to odd indices. Hmm, wait, maybe the code's loops for i=0 and i=1 are considering even and odd positions as per the problem's description. Wait, the problem says adding to elements with odd index (like 1,3,5) or even index (2,4,6). So in 0-based terms, those would be even indices (since 1 becomes 0-based 0, which is even index?), wait no. Wait, no. Let's think. Problem's first operation is adding 1 to elements with odd indices (like 1st, 3rd, etc.). So in 0-based terms, those would be even indices. Wait, no. Wait, 1st element in 1-based is index 0 in 0-based. So when the problem says \"odd index\", like a_1, a_3, etc., those are 0-based even indices. Because 0 is even. So the first loop in the code (i starting at 0, stepping by 2) checks all elements at even 0-based indices, which correspond to the problem's odd indices (1,3,5 in 1-based). Similarly, the second loop starts at 1, steps by 2, which are even indices in 1-based (like 2,4,6).\n\nSo the checkArray function seems to be checking that all the elements at the original odd positions (1-based) have the same parity as the first element (arr[0]%2), and all even positions (1-based) have the same parity as arr[1]%2. Because the first loop iterates over even indices (0,2,4 in 0-based) and checks if their parity matches t1 (which is arr[0]%2). The second loop iterates over the odd indices (1,3,5 in 0-based), checking if their parity matches t2 (arr[1]%2). \n\nBut why is that? Because each operation affects all elements in either the odd or even positions (as per the problem's 1-based). So, each operation can add 1 to all elements in the same parity group. So for example, applying the first operation (add to odd indices in 1-based, which are even in 0-based) will toggle the parity of all elements in even indices. Similarly for the second operation. \n\nThe key idea here is that, after any number of operations, the parity of elements in the even indices (0-based) can be adjusted by adding even or odd numbers of operations. Each operation of type 1 adds 1 to each even index. So applying it k times adds k to each even index. So the parity of each even index element depends on the initial parity and the number of times we apply operations of type 1. Similarly for the odd indices and type 2 operations. \n\nBut how can we get all elements to have the same parity? Let's think in terms of parity. For even and odd indices (0-based), each group can be toggled any number of times. For example, for even indices (0,2,4...), each operation of type 1 adds 1, so their parity flips each time. So the parity of each even index element is (original parity + k1) mod 2, where k1 is the number of times we apply operation 1. Similarly, the parity of each odd index element is (original parity + k2) mod 2, where k2 is the number of times we apply operation 2.\n\nWe need to choose k1 and k2 such that all even indices have the same parity as all odd indices. So, (original_even_parity + k1) mod 2 == (original_odd_parity + k2) mod 2 for all even and odd elements. \n\nBut how can this be possible? Let's think about the parity of the even and odd groups. \n\nFor all even indices, after applying k1 operations, their parity is (t1 + k1) mod 2. Similarly for odd indices: (t2 + k2) mod 2. We need these two to be equal. So (t1 +k1) mod 2 == (t2 +k2) mod 2. So (t1 - t2) mod 2 must be equal to (k2 -k1) mod 2. But since k1 and k2 can be any integers (0 or more), the difference (k2 -k1) can be any possible modulo 2. Wait, because for example, if we need (k2 -k1) mod 2 to be a certain value, we can choose k1 and k2 such that it is achieved. For example, if (t1 - t2) is 1 mod 2, then we need (k2 -k1) mod 2 to be 1. Which is possible by choosing k2 =k1 +1, but since they can be any number of operations, including zero. Wait, but how? Let's think: the difference (k2 -k1) can be any integer. So modulo 2, it's either 0 or 1. So if (t1 -t2) mod 2 is 0, then (k2 -k1) mod 2 must be 0, but since (t1 +k1) and (t2 +k2) must be equal mod 2. Let me rephrase: (t1 +k1) \u2261 (t2 +k2) mod 2. Rearranging, (t1 -t2) \u2261 (k2 -k1) mod 2. So k2 -k1 can be any value modulo 2. But since k1 and k2 can be any non-negative integers, we can choose k2 and k1 such that (k2 -k1) mod 2 is equal to (t1 -t2) mod 2. Wait, but (t1 -t2) mod 2 is fixed. For example, if (t1 -t2) is 0 mod 2, then (k2 -k1) mod 2 must be 0. So we can set k1 =k2. Then (t1 +k1) = t1 +k1, and (t2 +k2) = t2 +k1. So the difference between these two is (t1 -t2) mod 2. But if (t1 -t2) mod 2 is zero, then they are equal. So in that case, we can choose k1 =k2 (any value), and the parities will match. But if (t1 -t2) mod 2 is 1, then (k2 -k1) mod 2 must be 1. Which can be achieved by setting k2 =k1 +1. Then the difference is 1 mod 2. So in that case, (t1 +k1) and (t2 +k2) would be t1 +k1 and t2 +k1 +1. The difference is (t1 -t2) +1. If (t1 -t2) is 1, then this becomes 1+1=2, which mod 2 is 0. So (t1 +k1) and (t2 +k1+1) mod 2 would be (t1 +k1) mod 2 and (t2 +k1 +1) mod 2. So (t1 +k1) mod 2 = (t2 +k1 +1) mod 2. Which implies (t1 - t2 -1) mod 2 =0. But if (t1 -t2) is 1 mod 2, then (t1 -t2 -1) is 0 mod 2. So this works. So regardless of the initial t1 and t2, we can choose k1 and k2 such that the parities of the even and odd groups are the same. So the only problem is when the even group or the odd group themselves have varying parities. \n\nWait, but the code in checkArray is checking whether all even indices have the same parity as the first even element (t1), and all odd indices have the same parity as the first odd element (t2). If that's the case, then it returns true, else false. Because if all even indices have the same parity, then applying k1 operations (adding 1 to even indices) can toggle their parity. Similarly for the odd indices. But if there's a mix in either group, then even after any number of operations, their parities can't be made to be all same. \n\nFor example, if even indices have elements with some even and some odd parities, then applying any number of operations (k1) would flip all even indices' parity by k1 mod 2. But if the original even indices have different parities, then after adding k1 (same for all), they would all have (original +k1) mod 2. So if their original parities are the same, then this would work. But if some are even and others are odd originally, then after adding k1, they can't all have the same parity. \n\nSo the checkArray function is verifying that all even indices (0-based) have the same parity as the first element (arr[0]), and all odd indices have the same parity as the second element (arr[1]). Because if that's the case, then by choosing appropriate k1 and k2, we can make the two groups (even and odd indices) have the same overall parity. \n\nSo in the code, after the first two loops, if all even indices have the same parity as t1 and all odd indices have the same as t2, then it returns true. Otherwise, returns false. \n\nBut the code currently has a 'return false' in the first loop if any element in even indices doesn't match t1. The second loop checks the odd indices against t2. If any element in the odd indices doesn't match t2, then we have to return false. So in the code, the second loop's if statement is missing the code. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\". \n\nSo in the code, the second loop is for i starting at 1, stepping by 2. For each element in the odd indices (0-based), check if their parity is not equal to t2. If any such element exists, then the answer is false, so return false. Otherwise, after checking all, return ans (which is initialized to true). \n\nSo the missing code is: return false; \n\nBecause, in the first loop, if any element in even indices doesn't match t1, the function returns false. Similarly, in the second loop, if any element in the odd indices doesn't match t2, the function should return false. \n\nSo in the second loop's if block, the code should return false. \n\nBut wait, in the first loop, the code returns immediately upon finding a discrepancy. The second loop does the same. So the code's checkArray function works as follows: check that all even indices have the same parity as the first element, and all odd indices have the same parity as the second element. If this is the case, then return true. Otherwise, false. \n\nOnce that condition is met, then the answer is \"YES\", because we can choose k1 and k2 such that even and odd groups have the same parity. \n\nSo the missing line in the code is a 'return false;' statement. \n\nSo the code after the comment should have:\n\nreturn false;\n\nBecause if any element in the odd indices (0-based) doesn't match t2, the answer is no. \n\nSo the missing code is just that line. \n\nTesting this with the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input: 3 elements 1 2 1. \n\nEven indices (0,2) are 1 and 1: both odd. t1 is 1%2=1. So first loop passes. Odd index (1) is 2%2=0. So t2 is 0. Then, for the second loop, check all odd indices (only index 1 here). Its parity is 0, which matches t2 (0). So returns true. So output is YES. \n\nSecond test case: 2 elements 1 2. Even index 0: 1%2=1. Odd index 1: 2%2=0. Then, in checkArray, t1 is 1, t2 is 0. Check even indices (0) is okay. Check odd indices (1) is okay. Then returns true. Wait but according to the problem statement, the second test case's output is NO. Wait, wait. Wait the sample input 2 is n=2, array [1,2]. The sample output is NO. But according to the code as per current logic, checkArray would return true. But according to the problem's note, the second test case's answer is NO. So this indicates that there's a problem. \n\nWait, wait. Let me check the problem's note for the second test case. The note says: For the second test case, after any number of operations we can't make all elements have the same parity. So in the code, according to the current code (with the missing line filled in as return false), this test case would return true, which is incorrect. So this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let's think again. \n\nWait, the code checks whether all even indices (0-based) have the same parity as the first even index element (t1), and all odd indices have the same as the first odd index (t2). But then, even if this is true, the code returns true, but the problem requires that after applying some operations, all elements can have the same parity. So when the code returns true, does that mean that it's possible to choose k1 and k2 such that the parities of even and odd groups can be equal?\n\nYes. Because then, the even group's parity is (t1 +k1) mod 2. The odd group's parity is (t2 +k2) mod 2. We need to choose k1 and k2 such that these two are equal. \n\nSo (t1 +k1) \u2261 (t2 +k2) mod 2. Rearranged: (k1 -k2) \u2261 (t2 -t1) mod 2. So possible as long as there exists some k1 and k2 (non-negative integers) that satisfy this equation. \n\nBut since k1 and k2 can be any non-negative integers, including zero. So the equation can be satisfied as follows: choose k1 = a, k2 = a + (t2 -t1) mod 2. But since we can choose any a, but adding 0 or 1 to k2. \n\nWait, but for example, if (t2 -t1) mod 2 is 1, then we need k1 -k2 \u22611 mod 2. So k1 = k2 +1 + 2m. So for example, k1=1, k2=0. Then (t1 +1) mod2 and (t2 +0) mod2. So (t1 +1) must equal t2. \n\nBut the code allows any k1 and k2. So as long as the parity of the even group and the odd group can be adjusted via the operations to match. \n\nSo, for the code's logic, the checkArray returns true when all even indices have same parity, and all odd indices have same parity. Then, we can adjust k1 and k2 to make the two groups' parities match. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct only if the parity of the even group and the odd group can be adjusted to be the same. \n\nBut in the second test case, n=2, array is [1,2]. The even indices are [1], and the odd indices are [2]. t1 is 1%2=1, t2 is 2%2=0. All even indices (only index 0) have parity 1. All odd indices (only index 1) have parity 0. So checkArray returns true. But according to the problem's note, the answer should be NO. \n\nThis indicates that the code's logic is wrong. So why is that? \n\nIn the second test case, the code returns true, but the actual answer is NO. So this shows that the code's check is incorrect. \n\nSo why is the code's logic wrong here?\n\nBecause the code's check is not sufficient. Because even if all even indices have the same parity and all odd indices have the same parity, it's possible that it's impossible to make all elements have the same parity. \n\nIn the second test case, the code's check returns true. So according to the code, the answer is YES. But the problem's note says it's NO. \n\nSo what's the correct condition here?\n\nAh, I see. Let's think again. \n\nIn the code's check, the code allows for all even indices to have the same parity and all odd indices to have the same parity. Then, the code returns true. \n\nBut in the second test case, even indices have parity 1 (all even indices), odd indices have parity 0. Then, we need to choose k1 and k2 such that (1 +k1) mod 2 == (0 +k2) mod 2. \n\nSo 1 +k1 \u2261 0 +k2 mod2 \u2192 k1 -k2 \u2261 -1 mod2 \u2192 k1 -k2 \u2261 1 mod2. \n\nBut since k1 and k2 can be any non-negative integers. For example, choose k1=1, k2=0. Then even group parity is (1+1) mod2=0. Odd group parity is (0+0)=0. So all elements would be even. So the answer should be YES. But according to the problem's note, the answer is NO. \n\nWait, this is a contradiction. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem's second test case. \n\nProblem's note says: second test case is [2,1]. Wait no, wait the second test case is described as the second case in the note. Let me check the problem statement's notes. \n\nProblem note: \n\nFor the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity. \n\nSo the input for the second test case is n=2, a=[2,1]. Wait, the code's sample input may be different. Let me check the problem's note again. \n\nWait, the note for the second test case says that after any operations, can't make all elements same parity. Let's think: \n\nSuppose the array is [2,1]. Then even indices (0-based 0) is 2 (even), odd index (1) is 1 (odd). \n\nEven group's parity is 0 (t1=0). Odd group's parity is 1 (t2=1). \n\nSo checkArray would check if all even indices have parity 0 (yes), and all odd indices have parity 1 (yes). So returns true. \n\nThen, according to the code, the answer is YES, but according to the problem's note, it's NO. But this can't be. \n\nWait, but in this case, can we choose k1 and k2 to make even and odd groups have the same parity? \n\nEven group's parity after k1 operations: (0 +k1) mod2. \n\nOdd group's parity after k2 operations: (1 +k2) mod2. \n\nWe need (0 +k1) \u2261 (1 +k2) mod2 \u2192 k1 -k2 \u22611 mod2. \n\nPossible. For example, k1=1, k2=0. Then even group becomes (0+1)=1, odd group becomes (1+0)=1. So all elements are odd. So answer is YES. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, this case's answer is NO. \n\nThis suggests that either I'm misunderstanding the problem's test case or there's a mistake in the reasoning. \n\nBut the problem's note says that for the second test case, it's impossible. So there must be some confusion here. \n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's input is different. Let's recheck the problem's notes. \n\nProblem note says: \n\nFor the first test case: array [1,2,1], after even index operations, becomes [1+0 (no op?), even index adding? Wait, maybe I'm getting the operations wrong. \n\nWait, the first operation in the problem's note is adding 1 to elements with even indices (in the problem's terms, which are 2,4, etc. in 1-based). So for the first test case, which is [1,2,1], adding even index operations (even index in 1-based are 2, which in 0-based is index 1). So adding 1 to index 1. So the array becomes [1,3,1], which is all odd. So the answer is YES. \n\nThe second test case's note says that the answer is NO. So what's the input for this case? Let's think. Perhaps the second test case's array is [2, 1], but that would allow us to make the array [3,1] (after adding 1 to even indices (0-based 0)), which is all odd. So the answer would be YES. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second test case's array is [1,3]. Then, even indices (0-based 0) is 1 (odd), odd indices (1) is 3 (odd). So checkArray would return true. But then we can choose k1=0, k2=0. All are odd. So answer is YES. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case has array [1,2,3,4]. Then, even indices (0, 2) are 1 and 3 (both odd), odd indices (1,3) are 2 and4 (even). So checkArray returns true. Then, to make all even: choose k1=1 (even indices become even), k2=1 (odd indices become even). So (1+1) mod2=0 for even, (0+1) mod2=1 for odd. Not equal. Wait, no. Let me see: even indices are 1 and 3. Adding k1=1: their parities become even (1+1=2, 3+1=4). So even indices' parities are 0. Odd indices: 2 and4. Adding k2=0: parities remain 0. So even group is 0, odd group is 0. All elements even. So answer is YES. \n\nSo why would the problem's second test case have a NO answer? \n\nAh, maybe the array is [1,2,3,5]. Even indices: 1,3 (both odd). Odd indices: 2 (even),5 (odd). So the second loop would check if all odd indices have parity equal to t2=2%2=0. The third element in odd indices is 5 (index 3), which is 5%2=1. So checkArray returns false, hence answer is NO. \n\nAh, right. So in this case, the code would return false. \n\nBut in the problem's note, the second test case's array is not provided. \n\nBut according to the code, the checkArray function returns true if all even indices have same parity and all odd indices have same parity. So when the code returns true, it's possible to adjust k1 and k2 to make the entire array same parity. \n\nBut when checkArray returns false, it's not possible. \n\nBut according to the code, the second test case's code would return true, but the problem's note says it returns NO. So there's a contradiction. \n\nSo what's wrong here?\n\nAh, wait, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect. Because even if all even indices have same parity and all odd indices have same parity, it's possible that it's impossible to choose k1 and k2 such that (t1 +k1) mod2 == (t2 +k2) mod2. \n\nWait, no. Because (t1 +k1) mod2 and (t2 +k2) mod2 can be made equal by choosing appropriate k1 and k2. Because k1 and k2 can be any numbers. \n\nFor example, if t1 is 0 and t2 is 0. Then, (0 +k1) mod2 must equal (0 +k2) mod2. So k1 and k2 must be of the same parity. But this is possible (k1=0, k2=0). \n\nIf t1 is 1 and t2 is 0. Then, (1 +k1) mod2 must equal (0 +k2) mod2. So (k1 -k2) mod2 = (0 -1) mod2 = 1. So k1 -k2 must be 1 mod2. This is possible (e.g., k1=1, k2=0). \n\nSo in this case, the code's checkArray returns true, and the answer is YES. But the problem's second test case's answer is NO. So this suggests that the code's check is incorrect, but according to the code's logic, the answer is YES. \n\nSo there's a mistake in the code's logic. \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the code's check is correct, but the problem's note has a different example. Maybe the second test case in the problem's note is not covered by the code's logic. \n\nBut how can that be? Let's re-examine the problem's note. \n\nThe problem's note says for the second test case, the answer is NO. So the code's checkArray function must return false for that case. So in that case, the even indices or odd indices must have elements with varying parities. \n\nFor example, perhaps the array is [1,3,2]. Then even indices are 1 and 2 (parities 1 and 0). So checkArray would return false. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct. \n\nSo why in the code's example of [1,2], the checkArray returns true, but according to the problem's note, it's a NO case. But according to our previous analysis, in that case, the answer should be YES. \n\nThis suggests that the problem's note's second test case is not [1,2], but something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's note is incorrect, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is missing a condition. \n\nWait, perhaps after ensuring that all even indices have the same parity and all odd indices have the same parity, we need to check that (t1 +k1) and (t2 +k2) can be made equal for some k1 and k2. \n\nBut according to previous reasoning, this is always possible. \n\nBut what if t1 and t2 are 0 and 1. Then, we can choose k1=1, k2=0. Then even group parity is 0+1=1, odd group parity is 1+0=1. So yes. \n\nSo why would the problem's second test case return NO? \n\nAh, perhaps the array is [2,1]. Let's see: even indices (0) is 2 (parity 0). Odd indices (1) is 1 (parity 1). So checkArray returns true. Then, we can choose k1=1 and k2=0. Even group parity: 0+1=1. Odd group parity:1+0=1. So all elements have parity 1 (odd). So answer is YES. \n\nSo the code's logic would return YES, which contradicts the problem's note. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the second test case's answer is NO. \n\nSo this indicates that either the code's logic is wrong, or the problem's note's test case has a different array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is missing a condition. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is correct, but the problem's note's second test case has the array [2,1]. So according to the code's logic, the answer would be YES, but according to the problem's note, it's NO. So there's a contradiction. \n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nSo why is this happening? \n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nThe problem says: after any number of operations, can you make the array have all even or all odd. \n\nWait, but the code's logic allows for the two groups to have the same parity, which could be even or odd. \n\nBut what if the two groups' parities can be made equal, but this parity is either even or odd. But maybe the parity is even, but there's no way to have all elements even. Or all elements odd. \n\nWait, no. If the two groups have the same parity (say even), then all elements are even. If their parity is the same (say odd), then all elements are odd. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct. \n\nBut then why does the problem's note have a test case where the code's logic returns true, but the answer is NO? \n\nThis must mean that the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is missing a part where after making even and odd groups have the same parity, there's another condition. \n\nWait, another possibility: the code's checkArray function returns true when even and odd groups have the same parity already, but in the problem's note's second test case, the even and odd groups have different parities, but the code's checkArray function returns true. \n\nWait, no. For example, the array [2,1] (even index 0 is 2 (parity 0), odd index 1 is 1 (parity 1). So checkArray returns true. But according to the code's logic, it is possible to choose k1 and k2 to make their parities the same. Which is possible. \n\nSo the code's logic says YES, but according to the problem's note's second test case, the answer is NO. \n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nSo there's a mistake here. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe code's logic: check that all even indices have the same parity (t1), and all odd indices have the same parity (t2). If this is the case, then return true. Otherwise, false. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, there exists a case where even and odd groups are homogeneous, but the answer is NO. \n\nSo there must be another condition. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a scenario where even and odd groups are homogeneous, but it's impossible to make their parities match. \n\nBut according to the previous reasoning, this is possible. \n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nFor example, let's say t1 is even and t2 is even. Then, adding k1 and k2 such that even group's parity is even (k1 even) and odd group's parity is even (k2 even). So even group parity remains even, odd group parity remains even. So all elements are even. \n\nIf t1 is even and t2 is odd. Then, add k1 even (0) to even group, and k2 even (0) to odd group. Then even group parity is even, odd group parity is odd. So they are different. But according to the code's logic, we need to choose k1 and k2 such that even group's parity and odd group's parity are the same. \n\nFor example, if t1 is 0 (even) and t2 is 1 (odd). We need to find k1 and k2 such that (0 +k1) mod2 == (1 +k2) mod2. \n\nWhich is k1 -k2 mod2 == 1. \n\nSo for example, k1=1, k2=0: (0+1)=1 mod2, (1+0)=1 mod2. So all elements are odd. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, there exists a test case where even and odd groups are homogeneous, but the answer is NO. \n\nThus, there's a contradiction. \n\nSo what's wrong here? \n\nAh, perhaps the code's logic is missing a check that the required parity can be achieved. \n\nWait, suppose that all even indices are even and all odd indices are even. Then, answer is YES. \n\nIf all even indices are even and all odd indices are odd. Then, we can choose k1=1 (even indices become odd), k2=0 (odd indices stay odd). So all elements are odd. \n\nIf all even indices are even and all odd indices are even. Then, answer is YES. \n\nIf all even indices are odd and all odd indices are even. Then, choose k1=1 (even indices become even), k2=1 (odd indices become odd). Then, even and odd are even and odd again. No. Wait, no. \n\nWait, even indices are odd (t1=1). We can add k1=1: even indices become 1+1=2, even. \n\nOdd indices are even (t2=0). Add k2=0: remain even. So even group is even, odd group is even. All even. So yes. \n\nSo in all cases where even and odd groups are homogeneous, it's possible to make the entire array have the same parity. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, there's a case where this is impossible. \n\nSo there must be a mistake in the problem's note, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct, but the problem's note's second test case is not covered by this logic. \n\nSo perhaps the second test case has even and odd groups that are not homogeneous. \n\nFor example, array [2,1,3]. \n\nEven indices: 2 and 3. Parity 0 and 1. So checkArray returns false. So answer is NO. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the second test case's answer is NO. \n\nSo perhaps in that case, the code's logic correctly returns NO. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nSo why does the code's logic return YES for [2,1], but according to the problem's note, the answer would be NO. \n\nBut according to our analysis, the answer should be YES. \n\nSo perhaps the problem's note's second test case is not the array [2,1]. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nSo the code's missing line in the second loop's if statement is return false; \n\nThus, the correct code to fill in is return false; \n\nBut why does the problem's note have a case where the code's logic returns true but the answer is NO. \n\nThere's a contradiction here. \n\nBut given the code provided, the missing code is the return false; \n\nSo in the code's checkArray function, the second loop checks for each odd index. If any element's parity is not equal to t2, return false. \n\nThus, the missing code is return false; \n\nSo the correct answer is to fill in return false; in that line."
