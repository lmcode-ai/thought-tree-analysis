The code structure is given, and I have to fill in the part inside the loop where each test case is processed. First, let me understand the problem. The divisions are as follows: Division 1: rating >= 1900\nDivision 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\nDivision 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\nDivision 4: rating <= 1399 So for each rating, I need to check which of these conditions it meets and output the corresponding division. The input is t test cases, each with a rating. For each one, output the division. Let me think about the order of checking. Since the conditions are ranges, but some are overlapping in the boundaries. Like, if a rating is 1900, it's division 1. If it's 1600, division 2, etc. So the logic could be: Check if the rating is >=1900 \u2192 Division 1.\nElse, check if between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 Division 2.\nElse, check if between 1400 and 1599 \u2192 Division3.

Wait, the code as provided has a loop that runs t times. For each iteration, I need to read the rating. So in the loop, first step is to read the rating via scanf. Wait, the current code is:\n\nfor (scanf(\"%d\", &t); t > 0; --t) {\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n} So the loop runs t times. Each iteration, the code inside is supposed to handle one test case. So in each iteration, we need to read the rating. So first, inside the loop, there should be a scanf(\"%d\", &rating);. Then process it. So the missing code part includes reading the rating, then checking the conditions. So the steps are:\n\nInside the loop: 1. Read the rating (scanf(\"%d\", &rating);)\n2. Determine which division it's in.\n3. Print \"Division X\" accordingly. So the code inside the loop would be something like:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &rating);\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    printf(\"Division 1\\n\");\n} else if (rating >= 1600) { // because if it's >=1600 but not >=1900, then 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n    printf(\"Division 2\\n\");\n} else if (rating >= 1400) { // 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n    printf(\"Division 3\\n\");\n} else { // <=1399\n    printf(\"Division 4\\n\");\n} Wait, yes.
