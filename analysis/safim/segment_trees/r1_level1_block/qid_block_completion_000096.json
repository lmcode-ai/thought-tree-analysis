The task is to compute the sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each query. The awesomeness is the number of consecutive blocks in a subsegment. For example, the array [1, 2, 2] has an awesomeness of 2 for the entire array. The code provided has a Segments class that handles queries. The Query method is supposed to update the array and adjust the result efficiently. The missing part is in the code where there's a TODO comment in the Query method.",

So the total sum is the number of transitions multiplied by the number of subarrays that include them, plus the number of subarrays (since each has at least one block). Thus, the sum S = sum_{k=0 to n-2} (if a[k] != a[k+1]) (k+1) * (n - (k+1))) ) + (n*(n+1)/2). So when a transition is added or removed, the sum S changes by \u00b1 (k+1) * (n - (k+1)), where k is the position of the transition. In the code's Query method, when a transition is added or removed between index-1 and index (k = index-1), the contribution is (index) * (n - index). Similarly for the transition between index and index+1 (k = index), which is (index+1) * (n - (index+1)) = (index+1)*(n - index -1). So, in the code's left neighbor part (index>0), when the transition is added (changeVal=1), the code adds index * 1. But according to the formula, it should be index * (n - index) * 1. So this suggests a mistake in the code. But given that the code must pass the sample input, perhaps there's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the missing code is:\n\nchangeVal = -1;\n\nBut wait, why? Let's think.",

But how can changeVal be - (n - index) here? But in the code, the variable changeVal is an integer, and in the right neighbor case, it's multiplied by (n - index -1).

But how does the code handle the initial array? The initial array in the sample is [1,2,2,4,5]. The transitions are between 0-1 (1 and 2), 2-3 (2 and4), 3-4 (4 and5). So three transitions. The sum should be 3*(index+1)*(n - index -1) + n*(n+1)/2. The transitions' contributions are:\n\n0-1: 1*4=4\n\n2-3:3*2=6\n\n3-4:4*1=4 \u2192 sum 14. Plus 15 (n=5, 5*6/2=15). Total 14+15=29. Correct. So the code's _res variable should track this correctly. When a query changes an element, the code must adjust the sum based on the transitions added or removed. In the sample, after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. Suppose the first query is to change index 0 from 1 to 1 (no change).",

So the missing code is:\n\nchangeVal = -1;\n\nBecause in the right neighbor case, when the new value equals the right neighbor, changeVal is set to -1. So the code for the left case should mirror that. Thus, the missing code is setting changeVal = -1.",

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's think. For the pair (index, index+1), any subsegment that starts <= index and ends >= index+1 would include this pair. So the left can be from 0 to index, which is (index+1) options, and the right can be from index+1 to n-1, which is (n-1 - (index+1) +1) = n - index -1 options. So total (index+1)*(n - index -1). But in the code, when index <n-1, they are adding (n - index -1) * changeVal. Wait, why?\n\nIn the code for the right side (index <n-1):\n\nif (_nums[index] == _nums[index+1]) \n    changeVal =1;\nelse if (val == _nums[index+1])\n    changeVal =-1;\n\nThen _res += (n-index-1) * changeVal.

The task is to compute the sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each query. The awesomeness is the number of consecutive blocks in a subsegment. For example, the array [1, 2, 2] has an awesomeness of 2 for the entire array.\n\nThe code provided has a Segments class that handles queries. The Query method is supposed to update the array and adjust the result efficiently. The missing part is in the code where there's a TODO comment in the Query method. The code is handling the case when the current value is equal to the previous element and when the new value equals the previous element. \n\nLooking at the first if block in the Query method where index >0:\n\nThe code checks if the current value (before update) is equal to the previous element. If so, changeVal is set to 1. Then, else if the new value (val) equals the previous element, we need to adjust changeVal. The comment says to fill this part. \n\nWait, in the first part of the code (for index <n-1), when the original value is the same as the next element, changingVal is 1. Then, if the new val is same as next, changeVal is -1. So maybe in the index>0 case, the same logic applies.\n\nIn the index>0 block, the code is checking the left neighbor. The current code is checking if the current value (before change) was equal to the left neighbor. If so, changeVal is 1. Now, when the new value (val) becomes equal to the left neighbor (which was not the case before), we need to decrease the awesomeness sum. Because if the original a[index] was not equal to a[index-1], but after the update, it becomes equal, this can reduce the number of blocks in some subsegments.\n\nWait, how does this affect the total sum?\n\nThe awesomeness sum is the total number of blocks across all possible subsegments. So when two adjacent elements become the same, any subsegment that includes both and crosses the boundary between them would have their awesomeness reduced by 1. For example, if the original elements are [a, b] (different), changing b to a would merge them into one block. So all subsegments that include both elements would have their awesomeness reduced by 1.\n\nSo, in the code, when the new value (val) is equal to the left neighbor (a[index-1]), then this change will affect subsegments that include both index-1 and index. The number of such subsegments is the number of possible left starts (from 0 to index-1) multiplied by the number of possible right ends (from index to n-1). So that's index (since left can be 0 to index-1: index choices) multiplied by (n - index) (since right can be index to n-1: n - index choices). \n\nBut in the code, when the new value is equal to the left neighbor, the code is supposed to adjust the sum. In the first part (index <n-1), when the new value equals the next element, they subtract 1 from changeVal and multiply by (n - index - 1). Similarly, for the left side, when the new value equals the left neighbor, the code should adjust the sum by subtracting 1 for each of the possible subsegments that cross the index-1 and index.\n\nWait, looking at the code structure. In the index>0 part:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n{\n    changeVal = 1;\n}\nelse if (val == _nums[index-1])\n{\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n_res += index * changeVal;\n\nHmm. The first condition checks if the current element is equal to the left. So, if they were equal, then changing the current element to a different value (val) would split any subsegments that cross this boundary. So the changeVal is 1, which is added to _res multiplied by index. \n\nBut when the new value is equal to the left neighbor (val == _nums[index-1]), then the current value (before change) wasn't equal. So changing it to be equal would merge blocks. For example, if before, the elements were different, now they are the same. So any subsegment that includes both index-1 and index would have their awesomeness reduced by 1. But how does that affect the total sum?\n\nThe original sum would have counted each such subsegment as contributing a block. Now, those subsegments contribute one less block. So the total sum would decrease by the number of such subsegments. But the code here is handling the case where the change is from not equal to equal. So in this case, the changeVal should be -1 multiplied by the number of subsegments affected. \n\nWait, in the first part (index <n-1), when the current value is equal to the next, changingVal is 1. So for example, when the current and next are the same, changing the current to a different value (val) would split the block into two. So the number of blocks in all subsegments that include both index and index+1 would increase by 1. So the total sum would increase by the number of such subsegments. \n\nBut in the code, when the current and next are same, changeVal is 1, and multiplied by (n-index-1). Because the number of possible subsegments that include both index and index+1 is (index+1) possible left starts (from 0 to index) multiplied by (n - (index+1)) possible right ends (from index+1 to n-1). Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's think. For the pair (index, index+1), any subsegment that starts <= index and ends >= index+1 would include this pair. So the left can be from 0 to index, which is (index+1) options, and the right can be from index+1 to n-1, which is (n-1 - (index+1) +1) = n - index -1 options. So total (index+1)*(n - index -1). But in the code, when index <n-1, they are adding (n - index -1) * changeVal. Wait, why?\n\nIn the code for the right side (index <n-1):\n\nif (_nums[index] == _nums[index+1]) \n    changeVal =1;\nelse if (val == _nums[index+1])\n    changeVal =-1;\n\nThen _res += (n-index-1) * changeVal.\n\nSo for example, if the original pair was equal (so changeVal is 1), and after the update, they become different. Then the total sum would increase by (n-index-1)*1. Wait, but why? Because changing from equal to not equal would add 1 to all subsegments that cross index and index+1. So the total number is (index+1) * (n - (index+1)) = (index+1) * (n - index -1). But the code uses (n - index -1) multiplied by changeVal. So why is it (n - index -1) instead of (index+1)*(n - index-1)?\n\nAh, perhaps this is because the code is handling the contributions for each possible left start. Wait, maybe the code is structured such that the change in the right direction (index+1) is handled in a different part. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code's InitRes function is a bit unclear, but the Query method is trying to compute the effect of changing a single element. The key idea is to track how changing a single element affects the total sum by checking its left and right neighbors.\n\nFor the left neighbor (index >0), when the original elements were equal, changing the current element to a different value would split the blocks between index-1 and index. So any subsegment that includes both would have their awesomeness increase by 1. The number of such subsegments is the number of left starts (from 0 to index-1) multiplied by the right ends (from index to n-1), which is index * (n - index). \n\nBut in the code, when the original elements were equal, changeVal is 1, and then multiplied by index. So that's adding index * 1. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is structured in a way that for the left side, the contribution is index * changeVal, and for the right side, (n - index -1) * changeVal. Then there's a third part where it's index*(n - index -1) * changeVal. \n\nSo perhaps the code is breaking down the problem into three parts:\n\n1. Changes that affect the left neighbor (index-1 and index) pair.\n2. Changes that affect the right neighbor (index and index+1) pair.\n3. Changes that affect both left and right pairs, which may require a combined adjustment.\n\nIn the case of the left neighbor, the code checks if the current element (before change) was equal to index-1. If so, then changing it to a different value (val) would split the block. The number of affected subsegments is the number of possible left starts (left can be from 0 to index-1) and right can be from index to n-1. So left has index possibilities (since 0 to index-1 is index elements), right has (n - index) possibilities. So total is index * (n - index). But in the code, it's index multiplied by changeVal, which in this case is 1. So that's adding index *1. But where's the (n - index) part?\n\nAh, perhaps the code is considering that in the case where the left pair was equal, changing to a different value would split the left pair. The impact is that all subsegments that start <= index-1 and end >= index. For each such subsegment, the awesomeness increases by 1, so the total sum increases by the number of such subsegments. Which is (index) * (n - index). But in the code, it's _res += index * changeVal. So if changeVal is 1, then that's adding index *1. But that's not the case. That would undercount. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a mathematical approach where the total sum can be expressed in terms of the number of transitions between elements. Because each transition between consecutive elements contributes to the awesomeness of the subsegments that include them.\n\nThe total awesomeness across all subsegments can be calculated as follows: for each position between i and i+1 where a[i] != a[i+1], the number of subsegments that include this transition. Because each such transition contributes 1 to the awesomeness of the subsegment. So the total sum is equal to the sum over all transitions of the number of subsegments that include that transition.\n\nSo for example, if there's a transition between i and i+1, then the number of subsegments that include this transition is (i+1) * (n - (i+1)), since the left can be any start <=i, and the right can be any end >=i+1.\n\nSo the total sum is sum for each transition i (i+1)*(n - i -1) + n, since each single element contributes 1 (and there are n of them). But maybe the initial code accounts for the transitions and the individual elements.\n\nIn that case, when a transition is added or removed, the sum changes by the number of subsegments that cross that transition. So for example, if two elements that were different become the same, then the transition is removed, and the sum decreases by (i+1)*(n - i -1). If two elements become different, a transition is added, increasing the sum by that amount.\n\nIn the code's Query method, when we change a value at index, we need to check its left and right neighbors to see if transitions are added or removed.\n\nSo, for the left neighbor (index-1 and index):\n\nIf before the change, they were equal (so no transition), but after the change they are different (so a new transition is added), then the sum increases by (index) * (n - index), since the transition is at index-1 and index. The number of subsegments that cross this transition is (index) * (n - index) (left can be 0 to index-1, right can be index to n-1). So the sum increases by that amount.\n\nConversely, if before they were different (so there was a transition), and after the change they become the same (so the transition is removed), the sum decreases by (index) * (n - index).\n\nSimilarly for the right neighbor (index and index+1): the transition there would contribute (index+1) * (n - index -1) if there is a transition.\n\nSo in the code's Query method, the left and right neighbor checks are handling these transitions.\n\nNow, looking back at the code for the left neighbor (index >0):\n\nThe code first checks if _nums[index] == _nums[index-1]. If so, that means that there was no transition between index-1 and index. If we change _nums[index] to val which is different from _nums[index-1], then a new transition is added. The changeVal would be 1, and _res is increased by index * changeVal. But wait, according to the logic above, the change should be (index) * (n - index). But the code is adding index * changeVal. So this is missing the (n - index) factor. This suggests that perhaps the code is structured differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is handling the left and right transitions in a different way. Let's see.\n\nIn the code:\n\nFor the left neighbor (index>0):\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n{\n    changeVal = 1;\n}\nelse if (val == _nums[index-1])\n{\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n_res += index * changeVal;\n\nSo when the original elements were equal (so no transition), and after changing, they are different. So changeVal is 1. The code adds index *1 to _res. But according to the transition logic, this should be index * (n - index) *1. So why is it multiplied by index here?\n\nHmm, this discrepancy suggests that perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let's look at how the initial sum is calculated.\n\nIn the InitRes function, there's some code that calculates _res. Let's try to understand it.\n\nIn InitRes:\n\nThey start with segCount=1 and tmp=1L. Then for i from 1 to _n-1:\n\nif _nums[i] != _nums[i-1], segCount increases by 1. Then tmp += segCount.\n\nSo after this loop, tmp is the sum of the awesomeness of all subsegments starting at index 0. Because for each i, the current segCount is the number of transitions in the array from 0 to i. Then the code for the next part adds other contributions.\n\nBut maybe the code is using an O(n^2) approach but optimized to O(n). However, the main point is that the code's Query method is supposed to adjust the _res based on the changes in transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's Query method is handling each possible pair of transitions. For example, when the element at index is updated, it can affect transitions with the left neighbor (index-1 and index) and the right neighbor (index and index+1). Each of these transitions contributes a certain amount to the total sum. So when a transition is added or removed, the code adjusts _res accordingly.\n\nIn the code:\n\nFor the left neighbor (index>0):\n\nIf the original elements were equal (no transition), and after changing, they are different (so a transition is added), then the code adds index * 1 to _res. But according to the transition logic, it should be index * (n - index). So perhaps the code is missing a multiplication by (n - index), but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering the left and right contributions in two separate steps. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the code for the right neighbor (index <n-1):\n\nThey check if _nums[index] equals _nums[index+1]. If so, changeVal is 1. Then, _res is increased by (n - index -1) * changeVal.\n\nSo for example, if the original pair was equal (no transition), and after changing, they become different, then changeVal is 1. The code adds (n - index -1) *1. But according to transition logic, the contribution should be (index+1) * (n - (index+1)) = (index+1) * (n - index -1). But the code uses (n - index -1). So why?\n\nThis suggests that maybe the code is splitting the left and right contributions into left starts and right ends. For example, when considering the left neighbor, the code accounts for the left starts (0 to index-1) and the right ends (index to n-1). So the number of left starts is index (since there are index elements from 0 to index-1). The number of right ends is (n - index). So the total is index * (n - index). But in the code, for the left neighbor, they use index * changeVal. So perhaps they are multiplying by index (left starts) and the right ends (n - index) is handled elsewhere.\n\nWait, no. Because in the right neighbor case, the code is using (n - index -1) as the multiplier. For the right neighbor, the transition is between index and index+1. The left starts can be from 0 to index (index+1 elements) and the right ends from index+1 to n-1 (n - index -1 elements). So the total is (index+1) * (n - index -1). But the code adds (n - index -1)*changeVal, which suggests that the left starts are not accounted for here.\n\nSo perhaps the code is splitting the contribution into three parts:\n\n1. Left contribution (handled in the left neighbor code)\n2. Right contribution (handled in the right neighbor code)\n3. The combined contribution (handled in the third part)\n\nLooking at the third part (index <n-1 && index>0):\n\nThey calculate a changeVal based on whether the left and right transitions are added or removed. Then, they multiply by index * (n - index -1). So that term is for transitions that involve both left and right neighbors. For example, when changing the element at index, it could affect both transitions (left and right), and their combined effect is handled here.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input:\nAfter the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. The sum is 29.\n\nLet's compute the transitions. The transitions are between 1 and 2 (index 0 and 1), between 2 and 4 (index 2 and 3), and between 4 and 5 (index 3 and 4). So there are 3 transitions. Each transition contributes (left+1) * (n - (left+1)) where left is the index of the transition. For example:\n\nTransition between 0 and1: contributes (0+1) * (5 - (0+1)) = 1 *4=4.\n\nTransition between 2 and3: contributes (2+1)*(5 - (2+1))=3*2=6.\n\nTransition between3 and4: 4*1=4.\n\nPlus the individual elements (5 elements, each contributes 1, sum 5). So total sum is 4+6+4 +5 =19. But according to the sample, the sum is 29. So my approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transition contributes (left+1)*(n - right). Wait, the transitions are between i and i+1. For the transition between i and i+1, the number of subsegments that include this transition is (i+1) * (n - (i+1)). Because the subsegments start at any position up to i and end at any position >=i+1.\n\nSo for transitions in the sample:\n\n0-1: 1 *4=4.\n\n2-3:3*2=6.\n\n3-4:4*1=4.\n\nTotal transitions sum: 4+6+4=14. Add the individual elements (5) \u2192 total 19. But the sample sum is 29. So clearly, there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, the sample sum is 29. How is that possible? Let's see the sample explanation. The sum includes all subsegments' awesomeness. For example, [1,2,2,4,5] has 15 subsegments. The sum is 29.\n\nBut according to the transition approach, each transition's contribution is the number of subsegments that cross it. So each transition contributes 1 to every subsegment that includes it. So the total sum is the sum of the number of transitions in each subsegment plus 1 for each single element.\n\nWait, the awesomeness of a subsegment is the number of transitions in the subsegment plus 1. For example, a subsegment with no transitions (all elements same) has awesomeness 1. A subsegment with 2 transitions has 3 blocks, so awesomeness 3.\n\nSo the sum of all awesomeness values is equal to the sum of (number of transitions in the subsegment + 1) for all subsegments. The sum can be broken down into the sum of 1 for each subsegment plus the sum of the number of transitions in each subsegment.\n\nThe sum of 1 for each subsegment is the number of subsegments, which is n*(n+1)/2. For n=5, that's 15.\n\nThe sum of the number of transitions in each subsegment is the sum over all transitions of the number of subsegments that include that transition.\n\nSo for the sample, sum of transitions is 14 (from earlier), plus 15 gives 29, which matches the sample. So this approach works.\n\nSo the total sum is (n*(n+1)/2) + sum over transitions of (i+1)*(n - (i+1))).\n\nTherefore, the code must be tracking transitions and calculating the sum as the number of transitions' contributions plus the number of subsegments.\n\nSo when a query changes an element, it can affect up to two transitions (the left and right neighbors). The code must adjust the sum based on whether transitions are added or removed.\n\nNow, in the code's Query method:\n\nThe code is adjusting _res for the left and right transitions, and then a combined part.\n\nSo when the element at index is changed, the code checks the left neighbor (index-1 and index) and the right neighbor (index and index+1). For each of these pairs, it determines if a transition was added or removed.\n\nFor example, changing the element at index from oldVal to newVal:\n\nFor the left pair (index-1 and index):\n\n- If oldVal was equal to left neighbor, but newVal is different, a transition is added. This increases the sum by (index) * (n - index).\n\n- If oldVal was different from left neighbor, but newVal is equal, the transition is removed. This decreases the sum by (index) * (n - index).\n\nFor the right pair (index and index+1):\n\nSimilarly, if oldVal was equal to right neighbor but newVal is different, add (index+1)*(n - index -1).\n\nIf oldVal was different but newVal is equal, subtract (index+1)*(n - index -1).\n\nBut looking at the code:\n\nIn the left neighbor part (index>0):\n\nif (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1]) // they were equal before, so no transition.\n\nThen, if after the change, val is different, a transition is added. So the code is adding index * 1. Wait, this doesn't match the formula. Because according to the formula, it should be index * (n - index) * changeVal, where changeVal is 1. So in the code, why is it index * 1?\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps the code is not directly using the transition approach, but a different method. Let's think about the code structure again.\n\nThe code has a variable _res which holds the current sum. The InitRes() function computes the initial sum. Let's look at how the InitRes() is implemented.\n\nIn the commented code of InitRes(), there's another approach:\n\nindex starts at 0, then finds the right end of the current block. Then, _res is calculated using right * (_n - index) and subtracting (right - index) * (right - index -1)/2. This seems like a different approach.\n\nBut the current code uses a different method. The uncommented InitRes() uses a tmp variable that starts at 1 (for the first element), then for i from 1 to _n-1, if the current element is different from previous, segCount increases. Then tmp += segCount.\n\nSo for the first element, tmp is 1. Then for i=1, if different, segCount becomes 2, and tmp is 1+2=3. Then, for i=2, if same, segCount remains 2, tmp +=2. And so on.\n\nAfter that loop, tmp is the sum of the awesomeness of all subsegments that start at index 0. Then, for i from 1 to _n-1, the code subtracts 1 from tmp each time and adjusts if the current element is different from previous. Then, _res is summed with tmp each time.\n\nThis approach seems to calculate the sum in a way that for each starting index l, it calculates the sum of awesomeness for all subsegments [l, r], r >= l. For example, when l=0, the awesomeness for each r is added. Then, for l=1, subtract the contribution of the first element and adjust for the new starting point.\n\nBut perhaps this is not relevant to the current problem of filling in the missing code.\n\nBack to the original problem: the missing code is in the 'else if (val == _nums[index-1])' block of the index>0 part. The code is supposed to handle the case where the new value (val) is equal to the left neighbor. So before the change, the elements were different (since the else if is after checking if they were equal), and after the change, they are the same. So this transition is removed, which means the sum decreases by the number of subsegments that include this transition (which is index * (n - index)).\n\nSo in the code, when val equals the left neighbor (so the transition is removed), changeVal should be -1. And _res += index * changeVal. Wait, but according to the formula, it should be index*(n - index) * (-1). So why is the code using index * changeVal?\n\nAh, perhaps the code is making a mistake here. Because the current code for the right neighbor part uses (n - index -1) * changeVal, which for the right transition is (n - index -1) * 1 or -1. But according to the transition logic, it should be (index+1)*(n - index -1) * changeVal. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is broken, but the user expects us to fill in the missing code according to the existing pattern.\n\nIn the code for the left neighbor:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n{\n    changeVal = 1;\n}\nelse if (val == _nums[index-1])\n{\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n_res += index * changeVal;\n\nWhen the code reaches the else if, it means that _nums[index] != _nums[index-1] before the change. Then, if the new value val is equal to _nums[index-1], this means that after the change, the elements are equal. So the transition between index-1 and index is removed. The number of subsegments that include this transition is index * (n - index), so the sum should decrease by index*(n - index). But in the code, _res is being adjusted by index * changeVal. So changeVal should be -(index*(n - index)) / index = -(n - index). But that's not possible because changeVal is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, the code is structured such that when a transition is added or removed, the code increments or decrements _res by the number of subsegments affected, which is (left starts) * (right ends). \n\nIn the left neighbor case, the left starts are from 0 to index-1 (index choices), and the right ends are from index to n-1 (n - index choices). So total is index*(n - index). \n\nBut in the code, for the left neighbor part, when the original elements were equal (so no transition), and after the change they are different (so a transition is added), the code adds index * 1. But this seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is wrong. But the sample code must have passed some test cases. So perhaps the code is using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the code's changeVal for the left neighbor is handling the left starts, and the right ends are handled elsewhere. For example, the code for the left neighbor part is handling the left starts (index) and the right neighbor part is handling the right ends (n - index -1). Then the third part handles the combined effect of left and right transitions.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's look for patterns in the code.\n\nIn the left neighbor case (index>0):\n\n- The code checks if the old value was equal to left neighbor. If so, changing to a different value would split the block. The changeVal is 1. _res += index * changeVal. This suggests that the code is adding index to the result. But according to the transition logic, it should be index*(n - index). So why is the code adding index here?\n\nSimilarly, in the right neighbor case, the code is adding (n - index -1)*changeVal. \n\nThis suggests that the code is splitting the contributions into left and right parts, but not considering the product of left and right. \n\nFor example, when a transition is added between index-1 and index, the code adds index (left starts) and (n - index) (right ends) as separate terms. But that's not correct. Unless there's another part of the code that multiplies them.\n\nWait, in the third part of the code (index <n-1 && index>0):\n\nThere's a changeVal calculated based on both left and right transitions. Then, _res += changeVal * index * (n - index -1).\n\nAh, so this part handles the product of left and right contributions. So the code is structured to split the transitions into three parts:\n\n1. Left transitions (index * changeVal)\n2. Right transitions ((n - index -1) * changeVal)\n3. Combined effect (index * (n - index -1) * changeVal)\n\nBut why? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the following approach:\n\nThe sum of awesomeness can be expressed as the sum over all possible pairs (i, j) where i <= j, of the number of transitions in the subarray a[i..j] plus 1.\n\nEach transition between k and k+1 contributes 1 to all subarrays that include it. So the total sum is the number of transitions multiplied by the number of subarrays that include them, plus the number of subarrays (since each has at least one block).\n\nThus, the sum S = sum_{k=0 to n-2} (if a[k] != a[k+1]) (k+1) * (n - (k+1))) ) + (n*(n+1)/2).\n\nSo when a transition is added or removed, the sum S changes by \u00b1 (k+1) * (n - (k+1)), where k is the position of the transition.\n\nIn the code's Query method, when a transition is added or removed between index-1 and index (k = index-1), the contribution is (index) * (n - index). Similarly for the transition between index and index+1 (k = index), which is (index+1) * (n - (index+1)) = (index+1)*(n - index -1).\n\nSo, in the code's left neighbor part (index>0), when the transition is added (changeVal=1), the code adds index * 1. But according to the formula, it should be index * (n - index) * 1. So this suggests a mistake in the code.\n\nBut given that the code must pass the sample input, perhaps there's a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the missing code is:\n\nchangeVal = -1;\n\nBut wait, why? Let's think.\n\nIn the left neighbor part:\n\nWhen the old value was not equal to the left neighbor (so a transition existed), and the new value is equal to the left neighbor (so the transition is removed), the changeVal should be -1. Then, _res += index * (-1). \n\nBut according to the transition logic, this should subtract (index)*(n - index) from the sum. But the code is only subtracting index. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. But perhaps the code uses a different way of calculating the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's initial sum is not just the sum of transitions but also includes other terms. \n\nLooking at the InitRes() function:\n\nThe code has two loops. The first loop calculates tmp, which is the sum of the awesomeness of all subsegments starting at 0. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, tmp is adjusted by subtracting 1 and possibly more if the previous elements are different, and _res is added with tmp each time.\n\nThis suggests that the code's InitRes() is calculating the sum of awesomeness for all subsegments in a way that is O(n) time, but the actual formula is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the missing code is to set changeVal = -1. Because in the right neighbor code, when the new val equals the right neighbor, changeVal is -1. Similarly, in the left neighbor code, when the new val equals the left neighbor, changeVal should be -1.\n\nSo in the else if block for the left neighbor:\n\nchangeVal = -1;\n\nThen, _res += index * changeVal.\n\nBut why?\n\nIn the left neighbor code:\n\nWhen val == _nums[index-1], then after the change, the old value was different (since else if is only executed if the previous condition was false). So the transition between index-1 and index is removed. The number of subsegments affected is index*(n - index). So the sum should decrease by that amount. But in the code, this is handled by adding index * changeVal. So if changeVal is - (n - index), then index * changeVal would be -index*(n - index). But how can changeVal be - (n - index) here?\n\nBut in the code, the variable changeVal is an integer, and in the right neighbor case, it's multiplied by (n - index -1). So perhaps in the left case, the code is missing a factor of (n - index). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is incorrect, but according to the existing code structure, the missing code should set changeVal to -1. Because in the right neighbor code, when the new value equals the right neighbor, changeVal is set to -1, and multiplied by (n - index -1). So for the left case, perhaps the code is setting changeVal to -1, and then multiplied by index. But how does that make sense?\n\nFor example, if the new value is equal to the left neighbor, then the transition is removed. The number of subsegments that include this transition is index * (n - index). So the sum should decrease by index*(n - index). But the code adds index * changeVal. So to get the correct change, changeVal should be -(n - index). But that's not possible since changeVal is an integer variable.\n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect, but perhaps the intended code is to set changeVal = -1 here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is handling the left and right contributions in a way that the left part is multiplied by index and the right part is multiplied by (n - index -1), and the combined part handles the product. \n\nWait, in the third part of the code (index <n-1 && index>0), the code calculates changeVal based on both left and right transitions. For example, if changing the value at index causes both left and right transitions to change, then the code adjusts the sum by index * (n - index -1) * changeVal. \n\nBut how does this fit into the overall calculation?\n\nThe code's Query method is structured to handle three cases:\n\n1. Left neighbor (index>0): handles the left transition (index-1 and index)\n2. Right neighbor (index <n-1): handles the right transition (index and index+1)\n3. Both neighbors: handles the combined effect when both transitions are changed.\n\nSo for each of these transitions, the code is adding or subtracting the number of subsegments affected by the transition. \n\nIn the left case, the code is adding index * changeVal. For example, when a transition is added, changeVal is 1. So index *1. But according to the transition logic, this should be index * (n - index). So why is the code missing the (n - index) part?\n\nAh, perhaps the code is missing this because the (n - index) part is accounted for in the third part of the code. But I'm not seeing how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. For example, the code's InitRes function may calculate the sum in a way that allows for efficient updates by tracking the contribution of each possible transition and adjusting based on the changes in the transitions. \n\nBut without understanding the InitRes function fully, it's hard to see. \n\nGiven that the code for the right neighbor case uses (n - index -1)*changeVal, and the left case uses index * changeVal, perhaps the code is splitting the contribution into the left starts and right ends. For example, the left starts are index (number of left starts) and the right ends are (n - index) for the left transition. But the code is only handling the left starts in the left part and the right ends in the right part. Then, the third part handles the product of left and right ends for combined transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's _res variable is not tracking the actual sum, but a different value that can be adjusted incrementally. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct answer is to set changeVal = -1 in the TODO section. \n\nIn the right neighbor code, when the new value equals the right neighbor, the code sets changeVal to -1. Similarly, for the left neighbor case, when the new value equals the left neighbor, we should set changeVal to -1. Because this indicates that a transition is being removed, which decreases the sum by the number of left starts (index) multiplied by the changeVal (-1). But how does that match the actual required change?\n\nFor example, in the left case:\n\nIf the original elements were different (transition exists), and after the change they are the same (transition removed), the code should subtract index * (n - index) from _res. But the code is adding index * changeVal. So changeVal should be - (n - index). But that's not possible because changeVal is an integer. \n\nBut in the code, the third part of the Query method handles the product of index and (n - index -1). For example, when both left and right transitions are affected, the code adds changeVal * index * (n - index -1). \n\nSo perhaps the code is structured as follows:\n\nFor each of the left and right transitions, the code adds the left starts or right ends multiplied by changeVal. The third part handles the combined effect where both transitions are changed, which affects the product of left and right ends.\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the code structure and the sample, perhaps the missing code is simply setting changeVal to -1. Because in the right neighbor case, when the new value equals the right neighbor, changeVal is set to -1, and multiplied by (n - index -1). Similarly, for the left case, the code would multiply index by -1. \n\nBut according to the transition logic, this would be incorrect. But perhaps the code is designed in this way for some reason.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample input after first query:\n\narray is [1,2,2,4,5]. The sum is 29.\n\nSuppose we have a query to change index 1 (0-based) from 2 to 2 (no change). Then, the sum remains 29. \n\nBut in the code, perhaps after changing an element, the code checks the left and right neighbors. \n\nFor example, changing index 1 to 2 (no change), but in the code's logic, perhaps it would do nothing. \n\nBut how does the code handle the initial array? \n\nThe initial array in the sample is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\nThe transitions are between 0-1 (1 and 2), 2-3 (2 and4), 3-4 (4 and5). So three transitions. The sum should be 3*(index+1)*(n - index -1) + n*(n+1)/2. \n\nThe transitions' contributions are:\n\n0-1: 1*4=4\n\n2-3:3*2=6\n\n3-4:4*1=4 \u2192 sum 14. \n\nPlus 15 (n=5, 5*6/2=15). Total 14+15=29. Correct.\n\nSo the code's _res variable should track this correctly.\n\nWhen a query changes an element, the code must adjust the sum based on the transitions added or removed.\n\nIn the sample, after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. Suppose the first query is to change index 0 from 1 to 1 (no change). Then, the code should not change the sum. \n\nBut if a query changes index 1 (0-based) from 2 to 3:\n\nThe array becomes [1,3,2,4,5]. This adds transitions between 0-1 and 1-2, and removes the transition between 1-2 and 2-3 (if any). So the code must account for these changes.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. \n\nBack to the original problem: in the code, for the left neighbor case (index>0), when the new value equals the left neighbor, the code must set changeVal to -1. So the missing code is:\n\nchangeVal = -1;\n\nBecause in the right neighbor case, when the new value equals the right neighbor, changeVal is set to -1. So the code for the left case should mirror that. \n\nThus, the missing code is setting changeVal = -1."
