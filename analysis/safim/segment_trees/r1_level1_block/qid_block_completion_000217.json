        "text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n that has the minimum possible weight. The weight is the count of indices i where i divides p_i. So we need to minimize the number of such positions. The sample given for n=4 is [2,1,4,3], which has weight 1. Looking at that permutation:\n- For i=1, p_i is 2. 1 divides 2 \u2192 yes, so count increases by 1.\n- For i=2, p_i is 1. 2 doesn't divide 1.\n- For i=3, p_i is 4. 3 doesn't divide 4.\n- For i=4, p_i is 3. 4 doesn't divide 3. So total weight is 1. But how do we construct such a permutation? Hmm. The goal is to have as few i's as possible where i divides p_i. The minimal possible weight is 1 when n is even? Wait, the first test case is n=1, which has weight 1. For n=4, the weight is 1. But the note says it's impossible to get a smaller weight than 1 for n=4. So maybe when n is even, the minimal weight is 1, and when n is odd, perhaps it's also 1? Wait, no. Let's see for n=3. What's possible?\n\nFor n=3, possible permutations. Let's see:\n\nIf we have permutation [2,3,1]. Check each position:\n\ni=1: 1 divides 2 \u2192 yes (count 1)\ni=2: 2 divides 3? No.\ni=3: 3 divides 1? No. So weight is 1. But is that possible?",

Wait, the code provided in the sample has for even n, a loop that starts at i=2 and increments by 2. The sample code for even n in the code is in the part where they do for (i=2; i<=n; i +=2), and the TODO is to fill in the code there. So let's look at the sample for n=4. The permutation is [2,1,4,3]. So pairs are (2,1), (4,3). So for even i, we swap with the previous odd position. For example, 2 and 1, 4 and 3. That way, each even position i has p_i = i-1, and the previous odd position has p_i = i+1. Let's see:\n\ni=1: p_i=2. 1 divides 2 \u2192 yes (count 1).\ni=2: p_i=1 \u2192 2 doesn't divide 1.\ni=3: p_i=4 \u2192 3 doesn't divide 4.\ni=4: p_i=3 \u2192 4 doesn't divide 3. So only one occurrence. So the approach for even n seems to be to swap adjacent elements, but in pairs. So perhaps for even n, the permutation is constructed by swapping every pair. So for even i, we have p_i = i-1 and p_{i-1} = i. So this way, only i=1 will have p_i=2, which is divisible by 1. All others will have i not dividing p_i. So the code for even n would generate a permutation where every even index i has p_i = i-1, and the previous index (i-1) has p_i = i. So for example, for i=2, we output 1, then 2. Wait, no. Wait in the sample code for even n, the loop starts at i=2 and increments by 2. So for each even i (like 2,4,6...), we process them. For each such i, perhaps we output i and i-1 alternately? Wait, in the sample code, when n is even, the code is in the else block. The code starts a loop from i=2 to n, stepping by 2. For each i, there's a TODO. So perhaps for each i in this loop, the code needs to output two elements: i and i-1. Wait, for example, when i=2, we output 2, then 1. Then when i=4, output 4,3. Then when i=6, 6,5. And so on. But that would generate a permutation where the even positions are swapped with the previous ones.",

All other positions: for i=2, the value is 1 (2 doesn't divide 1), for i=3, 4 (3 doesn't divide 4), etc. So this gives a weight of 1, which is optimal. So the code for even n would need to output for each pair (i, i-1) as a pair. So in the loop, for i starting at 2, step 2, we output i and i-1. But how? For example, for i=2, output 2 and 1. Then for i=4, output 4 and 3, etc. So in the loop, each iteration would handle two elements. So perhaps in the code, for each i (even), we need to print i and i-1. But how to structure the loop? Wait, the loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n} So each iteration of the loop is for even i. For example, when n=4, i would be 2 and 4. For each i, we need to print i and i-1? Then for i=2, print 2 1. For i=4, print 4 3. So the permutation is 2 1 4 3, which matches the sample. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \"); But then, this would work for even i. For example, for n=6, the output would be 2 1 4 3 6 5. Which would have only the first element (2) where i=1 divides 2. All others are swapped. So the weight is 1. So the missing code in the even case is to print i and i-1 for each even i.

For i=4, which is the last iteration, print 4 3 followed by a new line. So the code would be:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    if (i ==n) {\n        pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \"\\n\");\n    } else {\n        pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n    }\n} But this would work for n=4 (even), but for n=6, the loop would have i=2,4,6. So for i=6, the last iteration, it would print 6 5 followed by a new line. Then the output would be \"2 1 4 3 6 5\\n\", which is correct. So the code inside the loop would check if i is equal to n (the last element in the loop), and if so, append a new line. Otherwise, append a space. But how to implement this. For example, in the code inside the loop:\n\nif (i == n) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\n} else {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n}\n\nWait, but in that case, for n=4, i=2 and 4.

But given that the code provided's structure doesn't allow adding code after the loop, the user must find a way to output the new line within the loop. But how?",

But according to the problem statement, the user must output only the missing code as plain text. So the missing code is the code inside the loop (printing the pairs) and the new line after the loop. But how?\n\nHmm. This is a dilemma. But given the code provided, the user can only fill in the code inside the loop. So perhaps the code provided is missing a new line, but the user can't fix that. So the correct code for the even case's loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \"); And then, after the loop, the code must have a pw.println(); but since the code provided doesn't have that, the user's code will be incorrect. But according to the problem's sample, the code for even n=4 must output a line with 2 1 4 3 followed by a new line. So the code for even n is missing the new line. So the code provided is incorrect, and the user must find a way to add it. But the user can't modify the code outside the loop. So perhaps the code provided has a mistake, and the user is supposed to add the new line inside the loop for the last element. So for each iteration, check if it's the last element, and if so, print a new line. But how to check if it's the last element. For example, in the loop, for each i, after printing the pair, if i +2 >n, then it's the last iteration. So:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1)); if (i +2 >n) {\n        pw.println();\n    } else {\n        pw.print(\" \");\n    }\n} But this would print a space after each pair except the last one, which prints a new line. But for n=4, the loop has i=2 and 4. For i=2: i+2=4, which is not greater than n (4). So the code would print a space. Then for i=4: i+2=6>4, so it prints a new line. So the code for n=4 would print \"2 1 4 3\\n\", which is correct. For n=6: i=2,4,6. For i=2: prints space. i=4: space. i=6: new line. So the permutation would be \"2 1 4 3 6 5\\n\". So this code inside the loop would handle the new line correctly. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n} But in Java, the print statements are additive. So for example, for i=2 in n=4, after printing \"2 1 \", then for i=4, it prints \"4 3\" and then a new line. So the line would be \"2 1 4 3\\n\". Yes. So this code would handle the new line correctly. So the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut wait, when i=4 in n=4, i+2 is 6, which is greater than n (4), so we print a new line. Correct. Yes. So this code would handle the new line correctly. So the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 >n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n} But the code in the loop is supposed to print the pair, then a space or new line. So for each pair, the code appends either a space or a new line. So the missing code is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, the print statements would accumulate, so the code would generate the correct output. So this is the code that needs to be filled inside the loop. So putting it all together, the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, the code would be written as:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nSo this code would handle the new line correctly. Therefore, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n} But the code must be written in Java syntax. So the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, this is written as:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n} But this is two separate statements. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, the loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i=2; ...) {\n    // code here\n} So the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, this is allowed. So this code would print the pairs and the new line. So this is the correct code for the even case's loop. So the missing code is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, the code must be written properly. So for example:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n} Yes. So this code would handle the even case correctly, including the new line. Thus, the answer is to fill in the loop with this code.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n that has the minimum possible weight. The weight is the count of indices i where i divides p_i. So we need to minimize the number of such positions.\n\nThe sample given for n=4 is [2,1,4,3], which has weight 1. Looking at that permutation:\n- For i=1, p_i is 2. 1 divides 2 \u2192 yes, so count increases by 1.\n- For i=2, p_i is 1. 2 doesn't divide 1.\n- For i=3, p_i is 4. 3 doesn't divide 4.\n- For i=4, p_i is 3. 4 doesn't divide 3.\nSo total weight is 1. But how do we construct such a permutation?\n\nHmm. The goal is to have as few i's as possible where i divides p_i. The minimal possible weight is 1 when n is even? Wait, the first test case is n=1, which has weight 1. For n=4, the weight is 1. But the note says it's impossible to get a smaller weight than 1 for n=4. So maybe when n is even, the minimal weight is 1, and when n is odd, perhaps it's also 1? Wait, no. Let's see for n=3. What's possible?\n\nFor n=3, possible permutations. Let's see:\n\nIf we have permutation [2,3,1]. Check each position:\n\ni=1: 1 divides 2 \u2192 yes (count 1)\ni=2: 2 divides 3? No.\ni=3: 3 divides 1? No. So weight is 1. But is that possible?\n\nWait, but in that permutation, the first element is 2, which is not 1. So the weight is 1, which is better than the initial case. So maybe for even and odd n, except n=1, the minimal weight is 1 when possible.\n\nWait, the note says for n=4, the weight is 1 and it's impossible to get a smaller one. So maybe the minimal possible weight is 1 for all n except 1? Or maybe for even n, it's possible to have weight 1, but for odd n, you can't avoid having at least one, but perhaps there's a way.\n\nWait, the code provided in the sample has for even n, a loop that starts at i=2 and increments by 2. The sample code for even n in the code is in the part where they do for (i=2; i<=n; i +=2), and the TODO is to fill in the code there.\n\nSo let's look at the sample for n=4. The permutation is [2,1,4,3]. So pairs are (2,1), (4,3). So for even i, we swap with the previous odd position. For example, 2 and 1, 4 and 3. That way, each even position i has p_i = i-1, and the previous odd position has p_i = i+1. Let's see:\n\ni=1: p_i=2. 1 divides 2 \u2192 yes (count 1).\ni=2: p_i=1 \u2192 2 doesn't divide 1.\ni=3: p_i=4 \u2192 3 doesn't divide 4.\ni=4: p_i=3 \u2192 4 doesn't divide 3. So only one occurrence.\n\nSo the approach for even n seems to be to swap adjacent elements, but in pairs. So perhaps for even n, the permutation is constructed by swapping every pair. So for even i, we have p_i = i-1 and p_{i-1} = i. So this way, only i=1 will have p_i=2, which is divisible by 1. All others will have i not dividing p_i.\n\nSo the code for even n would generate a permutation where every even index i has p_i = i-1, and the previous index (i-1) has p_i = i. So for example, for i=2, we output 1, then 2. Wait, no. Wait in the sample code for even n, the loop starts at i=2 and increments by 2. So for each even i (like 2,4,6...), we process them. For each such i, perhaps we output i and i-1 alternately?\n\nWait, in the sample code, when n is even, the code is in the else block. The code starts a loop from i=2 to n, stepping by 2. For each i, there's a TODO. So perhaps for each i in this loop, the code needs to output two elements: i and i-1. Wait, for example, when i=2, we output 2, then 1. Then when i=4, output 4,3. Then when i=6, 6,5. And so on. But that would generate a permutation where the even positions are swapped with the previous ones.\n\nWait, but when you do this, the permutation would be [2,1,4,3,6,5,...], which for even n would have each even element followed by the previous one. Then, in this permutation, only the first element (1) is 2, which is divisible by 1. All other positions: for i=2, the value is 1 (2 doesn't divide 1), for i=3, 4 (3 doesn't divide 4), etc. So this gives a weight of 1, which is optimal.\n\nSo the code for even n would need to output for each pair (i, i-1) as a pair. So in the loop, for i starting at 2, step 2, we output i and i-1. But how? For example, for i=2, output 2 and 1. Then for i=4, output 4 and 3, etc. So in the loop, each iteration would handle two elements. So perhaps in the code, for each i (even), we need to print i and i-1. But how to structure the loop?\n\nWait, the loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo each iteration of the loop is for even i. For example, when n=4, i would be 2 and 4. For each i, we need to print i and i-1? Then for i=2, print 2 1. For i=4, print 4 3. So the permutation is 2 1 4 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n\nBut then, this would work for even i. For example, for n=6, the output would be 2 1 4 3 6 5. Which would have only the first element (2) where i=1 divides 2. All others are swapped. So the weight is 1.\n\nSo the missing code in the even case is to print i and i-1 for each even i. But how to handle the loop? Because for each even i, the code processes two elements.\n\nSo in the code block for even n, after the loop, perhaps we need to print these pairs. Then, the code for even n would generate the permutation correctly.\n\nWait, but the loop is from i=2 to n, stepping by 2. For each i, the code should print (i) and (i-1). But in the sample for n=4, the loop would process i=2 and i=4. For i=2, print 2 1, and for i=4, print 4 3. So the entire permutation would be \"2 1 4 3\", which is correct.\n\nYes. So the missing code is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n\nBut wait, when you print them, you need to make sure that the order is correct and that all elements are printed. Let's test for i=2:\n\nPrinting 2 followed by 1. Then i=4, print 4 followed by 3. So the permutation is 2,1,4,3. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Java, when using print, the elements would be concatenated. So for the even case, after processing all even i's, the permutation is built correctly.\n\nSo in the code, for the even case:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, perhaps a new line is printed. Wait, looking at the code structure: after the else block, which handles even and odd n, for even n, after the loop, the code in the else block is done, and the next line is pw.println(). Wait, no. Let's check the code structure.\n\nIn the code:\n\nelse { // if n is even\n    if(n%2==0) {\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        // handle odd n\n    }\n}\n\nWait, no. The code structure is:\n\nif(n==1){\n    ...\n}\nelse{\n    if(n%2==0) { // even\n        for loop here\n    }\n    else { // odd\n        print n, then 1 to n-1\n    }\n}\n\nSo, after the for loop in the even case, the code does not append a new line. But in the code for the odd case, after printing the permutation, a pw.println() is called. So for the even case, after the for loop, the code probably appends a new line. But in the code provided, the code for the even case runs the for loop, and after that, the else block ends, and then the loop for the test case ends. But how is the line ended?\n\nWait, looking at the code for the test case: in the if(n==1) case, it does pw.println(1). In the else block, for even n, the code is the for loop, which prints the elements. Then, the code for the else part (the even/odd block) ends, and after that, there is no new line. So after processing the even case, the code would have printed all elements without a new line. So we need to add a pw.println() after the for loop.\n\nBut in the code provided, in the even case, after the for loop, there is no code. But the code for the odd case does have pw.println(). So perhaps in the even case, the code is missing the pw.println().\n\nWait, in the code provided, the even case is handled with the for loop, but the code for even n is:\n\nif(n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nThen, after that loop, there is no code. So the code would print the elements in the loop, but not append a new line, leading to all elements being printed in one line, but the next test case would be printed in the same line. So this is a problem.\n\nLooking at the code for the odd case: the code does:\n\npw.print(n+\" \");\nfor(int i =1; i<=n-1; i++) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \");\n}\npw.println();\n\nSo, after the loop, it adds a println(). But for the even case, the code in the for loop is part of the code, but after the loop, there's no println(). So the code for the even case would generate a line with all the elements printed, but no new line, leading to the next test case's output being on the same line.\n\nThat's a bug. So in the current code, the even case is missing a pw.println() after the loop.\n\nBut according to the code given, the user is supposed to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code has an error here, and the user is supposed to add the new line. But the code provided for the even case has the loop, but the missing code is inside the loop.\n\nWait, the code provided for even n is:\n\nif(n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; i<=n; i +=2) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nThe code inside the loop is missing. So the user has to fill in the code inside the loop. So each iteration of the loop would print two elements, like 2 1, then 4 3, etc. But after all elements are printed, the even case does not have a new line. So the code would not work correctly.\n\nBut in the code for the odd case, they have pw.println(). So for the even case, the code should have a pw.println() after the loop. However, the current code structure is:\n\nIn the else block (when n is not 1), if n is even, run the for loop. Then, no code, so after the loop, the code proceeds to the next test case. So the even case would not have a new line, which is required.\n\nWait, no. Because after each test case, the code must print a line for the permutation. So in the even case, after processing the loop (printing the elements), we need to print a new line.\n\nBut in the code provided, the even case's code is the for loop. So after the loop, there is no code, so the line is not ended. So the next test case's output will be on the same line. Which is wrong.\n\nSo the problem in the given code is that, after the for loop for even n, there's no println(), leading to incorrect output. But according to the problem statement, the code must be completed. So the user needs to not only fill in the code inside the loop but also ensure that the even case ends with a new line.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, looking at the code structure:\n\nfor each test case:\n    if n ==1:\n        print 1\n    else:\n        if even:\n            loop for i from 2 to n step 2:\n                print i and i-1\n        else:\n            print n followed by 1 to n-1, then new line\n\nBut the even case's code is missing the new line. So the code would have the elements printed, but not a new line.\n\nSo in the even case's code, after the loop, the code should print a new line.\n\nBut in the code provided, after the loop, there is no code. So to fix this, the code inside the even case's block should have a pw.println() after the loop.\n\nBut in the code provided, the even case's code is:\n\nif(n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i = 2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n        // code here prints elements\n    }\n    // need to print new line here\n}\n\nBut the code after the loop is not there. So the missing code includes the elements in the loop and the new line. But the code inside the loop is the TODO. So the code inside the loop would be to print the elements, and then after the loop, the code must add a pw.println().\n\nWait, but how can that be done? Because the code provided has the for loop inside the even case. So the missing code is the code inside the loop. Then, after the loop, the code must add a println().\n\nBut the code for the even case is structured as:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    // fill in code here\n}\n\nSo after the loop, there's no code. So the code inside the loop must include all the necessary prints, including the new line. But that's not possible. Because each loop iteration handles two elements, but the new line is needed once after all elements are printed.\n\nWait, but each iteration of the loop is handling two elements. For example, when i=2, print 2 and 1. Then i=4, print 4 and 3. So after all elements are printed, the code must add a new line.\n\nSo in the even case's code block, after the for loop, we need to add a pw.println().\n\nBut the code provided for the even case doesn't have that. So the code has a mistake. But the user is supposed to fix it by adding the missing code. But the code given is to fill in the code inside the loop. How to resolve this?\n\nAh, perhaps the code in the even case's loop is to print each pair, and then after the loop, there's a call to pw.println().\n\nBut in the code provided, the even case's code is:\n\nif(n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nSo the missing code is inside the loop. But after the loop, there is no code. So the code would not print a new line. Therefore, the code for the even case would have all the elements printed but no new line, leading to all test cases' outputs being concatenated.\n\nBut according to the sample code's odd case, after printing the elements, they do pw.println(). So for the even case, the code must also do the same.\n\nSo, the user must add the code inside the loop to print the pairs and also add a new line after the loop.\n\nBut how can the code be written? The code structure for the even case is:\n\nif (n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n        // print i and i-1\n        pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n    }\n    pw.println(); // this is needed\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, the code after the loop is missing. So the code for even case would print the elements, but not the new line. So the code would be incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem's code, the user must fill in the code only in the loop. So this suggests that the code provided has a mistake, and the new line is not present. However, in the code provided, the code for the even case has to have the loop code filled, but no code to print a new line. So perhaps the code is missing that.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. So the code to be filled is inside the loop, and also possibly adding the new line.\n\nBut how? Because the code for the even case's loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i=2; ...) {\n    // missing code here\n}\n\nThe code inside the loop must generate the elements, and then after the loop, the code needs to add a new line. But the code provided for the even case does not have code after the loop. So the user cannot add code after the loop.\n\nBut the code provided has the code in the else block. Wait, the code is:\n\nelse { // else here is when n !=1\n    if (n%2 ==0) {\n        // even case\n    } else {\n        // odd case\n    }\n}\n\nIn the even case's code, after the loop, there's no code. So for the even case, the code must print the elements in the loop and then add a new line. But how to do that.\n\nWait, looking at the code for the odd case:\n\npw.print(n + \" \");\nfor(...) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \");\n}\npw.println();\n\nSo for the even case, after the loop, we need to do the same: print all elements in the loop, then a new line.\n\nBut the even case's code is inside the for loop. So the code for the even case's loop is:\n\nfor (i=2; i<=n; i +=2) {\n    print i and i-1.\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, we need to print a new line.\n\nBut the code provided for the even case's block does not have that. So the code as provided is incorrect. But the user has to fix it.\n\nSo perhaps the correct code for the even case is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n}\npw.println();\n\nBut in the code provided, the code for the even case's loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i=2; ...) {\n    // code here\n}\n\nSo the code inside the loop must handle the printing of the pairs. But after the loop, how to add the new line?\n\nAh! Because the code for the even case is inside the loop, and the code for each test case is handled in the loop for t=1 to test. So after processing each test case, the code in the loop for the even case would have printed all elements in the permutation, but no new line. So the code would have all elements printed, and then when the next test case starts, it would print in the same line.\n\nSo the code is missing the pw.println() after the even case's loop.\n\nBut the code provided in the problem does not have that. So the code must be modified to add this. But the user can't add code outside the loop. So this suggests that the code provided has a mistake, and the user is supposed to fill in the code inside the loop and add the new line inside the loop.\n\nBut that's not possible. Because the new line should be printed once per test case, after all elements are printed. So the code inside the loop can't handle that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the code in the even case's loop is written to print all the elements, and after the loop, the code adds a new line. But the code provided doesn't have the new line. So perhaps this is a mistake in the code that the user is supposed to fix. However, the problem states that the user must output the missing code as plain text, not the entire program. So the missing code is the code inside the loop (the TODO part) and also the code to add the new line after the loop.\n\nBut according to the code given, the code for the even case's block is:\n\nif(n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nSo the user must fill in the code inside the loop, but after the loop, there's no code. So how to handle the new line.\n\nAh, perhaps the code inside the loop handles all the elements, and after the loop, the code for the test case automatically adds a new line. But that's not the case. Because in the code for the test case's loop (the outer loop), after processing each case, there is no code that adds a new line. Only the code inside each case's handling adds the new line.\n\nFor example, in the odd case, they have pw.println(), but the even case's code doesn't. So the code for even case would not have a new line.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the code must output each permutation on a separate line.\n\nSo the code for even case must output the elements and then a new line. So in the even case's code block, after the for loop, we need to call pw.println().\n\nBut the code provided doesn't have this. So the user must add that code.\n\nBut how? Because the code provided for the even case's block is:\n\nif (n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; ...) {\n        // code to print pairs\n    }\n    // missing code here: pw.println();\n}\n\nBut the user is supposed to fill in only the missing code inside the loop. So this is a problem. Unless the code for even case's block is different.\n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n\n        int test = in.nextInt();\n\n        for(int t=1;t<=test;t++){\n            int n = in.nextInt();\n\n            if(n==1){\n                pw.println(1);\n            }\n            else{\n                if(n%2==0) {\n                    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {\n                        /* TODO: Your code here */\n                    }\n                }\n                else{\n                    pw.print(n+\" \");\n                    for(int i = 1;i<=n-1;i++){\n                        pw.print(i+\" \");\n                    }\n\n                    pw.println();\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        pw.close();\n    }\n\n    static void debug(Object... obj) {\n        System.err.println(Arrays.deepToString(obj));\n    }\n}\n\nAh, so the code for the even case is inside the else block. After the else, if n is even, the code runs the for loop, and after that, nothing. So after the for loop, there's no code, which means that after printing the elements in the loop, no new line is added. So this is the problem.\n\nSo the code for even n is incomplete. The code in the even case's loop should print the pairs, and then the even case's block should add a new line.\n\nBut according to the code provided, the even case's block is:\n\nif (n%2 ==0) {\n    for loop here\n}\n\nSo the code after the loop is missing. So in order to print the new line, the code inside the even case's block should have:\n\nfor loop {\n    print pairs\n}\npw.println();\n\nSo the code for the even case would be:\n\nif (n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; ...) {\n        print pairs\n    }\n    pw.println();\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, there's no pw.println() after the loop. So the user has to add this. But according to the problem statement, the missing code is only the code that is to be filled in, which in this case is inside the for loop.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Because the code provided has a loop in the even case's block, but no code after the loop, leading to no new line. So the user needs to not only fill the code inside the loop but also add code after the loop. However, according to the problem statement, the user is to output only the missing code, which is the code inside the loop and the code to add the new line. But the code provided does not have any place to add code after the loop.\n\nThis suggests that the code provided has a mistake, and the user is supposed to fill in the code inside the loop and also add the new line.\n\nBut given the code structure, how can the user do that? The code after the loop is not part of the code to be filled.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the code inside the loop prints all the elements, and the new line is added by the code outside the loop. But no, the code as provided doesn't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for even n is supposed to output the permutation as a single line, and the code inside the loop prints all elements, followed by a new line. But how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code for even n should generate the permutation as follows:\n\nFor example, for n=4, the permutation is 2 1 4 3. So each pair is printed in the loop. After the loop, the code adds a new line.\n\nBut in the code provided, after the loop, there's no code. So the code would print the elements but no new line. So the code would be incorrect.\n\nBut in the code for the odd case, they have a pw.println() after printing all elements. So the even case's code must also do the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct code for the even case is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n}\npw.println();\n\nBut the code provided has no code after the loop. So how to include this?\n\nAh! The code provided for the even case's block is:\n\nif (n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n        // code here\n    }\n}\n\nSo after the loop, the code in the even case's block would need to print the new line. But in the code provided, there's no code after the loop. So this is missing.\n\nBut the user can't modify the code outside the loop. So this suggests that the code provided has a mistake, and the user is supposed to fix it. However, according to the problem statement, the user is to fill in the missing code, which is the code inside the loop. So perhaps the code provided is incorrect, and the user must find a way to output the new line within the loop.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can print the new line inside the loop for the last iteration. For example, check if i is the last element in the loop and then print a new line.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the code can print the pairs in the loop and after the loop, the code outside the loop can print a new line. But since the code provided does not have that, the user must find a way to do it.\n\nBut the problem states that the code to be filled is only the missing code, which is the code inside the for loop. So perhaps the code inside the loop is responsible for printing the pairs and the new line.\n\nBut that's not possible. Because the new line must be printed once per test case, after all elements are printed.\n\nSo perhaps the code provided is missing the new line, and the user is supposed to add it as part of the code in the loop. But how?\n\nThis is a problem. Because the code provided for the even case has a loop that iterates over the even indices. For example, when n=4, the loop runs for i=2 and i=4. For each i, it prints two elements. Then, after the loop, no new line. So the code for the even case would output 2 1 4 3, but no new line, leading to the next test case's output being appended.\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct code for the even case must include a new line after all elements are printed. But the code provided doesn't have that. So the user must add it, but the code provided's structure doesn't allow it.\n\nBut according to the code provided, the code inside the even case's loop is to be filled. So perhaps the code must be written in such a way that the new line is printed as part of the loop.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code inside the loop for even i is to print the elements, and after the loop, the code outside the loop (but inside the even case's block) prints the new line. But the code provided doesn't have that.\n\nTherefore, the code provided is incorrect, and the user is to fill in the code inside the loop and also add a new line after the loop. But since the code provided doesn't have code after the loop, the user can't do that. So this suggests that the code has a mistake.\n\nBut perhaps the code for even case is written as follows: after processing all pairs, the code adds a new line. But since the code provided doesn't have that, the user can't do anything.\n\nHmm. Maybe the code provided by the problem has a mistake, and the intended solution is to print the pairs and then a new line, but the code in the problem doesn't include the new line. Therefore, the user must find a way to print the new line within the loop.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code inside the loop is written to print each pair, and after the loop, the code for the even case's block has a new line. But the code provided doesn't have that.\n\nThis is a problem. But according to the problem statement, the user must fill in the missing code. So the correct code for the even case's loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n\nThen, after the loop, the code must add a new line. But since the code provided doesn't have code after the loop, the user can't add that. So this suggests that the code provided is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the sample input and the code's structure, the code for the even case's loop is missing the new line. So the code would not pass the test cases.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, when n is even, the code must print the permutation and then a new line.\n\nTherefore, the correct code for the even case's block is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n}\npw.println();\n\nBut the code provided doesn't have the pw.println() after the loop. So the user must add this code. But how can they do that if the code provided's structure doesn't have code after the loop.\n\nThis suggests that the code provided is incomplete and the user must fill in the code inside the loop and also add the new line. But according to the problem statement, the user is to fill in the missing code as plain text, which is the code inside the loop. So perhaps the code provided has a mistake, but the user is supposed to only fill in the code inside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code provided's for loop is designed to print all elements, and then the new line is printed elsewhere. For example, perhaps the code for the even case's block is followed by a pw.println().\n\nBut according to the code provided, the even case's block is:\n\nif (n%2 ==0) {\n    for (int i=2; ...) {\n        // code here\n    }\n}\n\nAnd then, after this block, the code proceeds. So after the loop, there's no code. So the new line is not printed.\n\nThis is a problem. So the code provided is incorrect, and the user is supposed to add the new line after the loop. But since the code provided doesn't have code there, the user can't do that.\n\nHmm. Perhaps this is a mistake in the code provided, and the correct code for the even case's loop is to print the pairs, and then, after the loop, the code for the even case's block adds a new line. But the code provided doesn't have that.\n\nThis is a difficult situation. But given the code provided, the user must fill in the code inside the loop. So assuming that the code for the even case's loop is correct, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n\nBut then, the code would not have a new line. So the code for the even case would print the elements but no new line, leading to all test cases' outputs being concatenated. Which is wrong.\n\nSo this suggests that the code provided is incorrect, and the user must find a way to add the new line.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user must output the missing code. So perhaps the code provided's even case loop is missing the new line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the even case's loop includes a new line after processing all elements, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code inside the loop appends a new line after each pair. But that's not possible because each test case's permutation must be on a single line. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, after the loop, the code prints a new line. But the code provided doesn't have code after the loop. So the code would not work.\n\nBut perhaps the code provided's structure is wrong. For example, the code for the even case's loop should print the elements, and then after the loop, the code calls pw.println().\n\nBut in the code provided, that code is missing. So the user's solution must include that. But the user can't modify the code outside the loop.\n\nThis seems to be a mistake in the code provided. So the correct code for the even case's loop is to print the pairs, and the code after the loop must add a new line. But the code provided doesn't have that. Therefore, the code provided is incomplete, and the user must find a way to add the new line.\n\nBut according to the problem's instruction, the user is to complete the code by filling in the missing lines or blocks. So perhaps the code for the even case's loop is supposed to print the pairs, and after the loop, the code adds a new line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the even case's loop is written as follows:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n}\npw.println();\n\nBut in the code provided, after the loop, there's no pw.println(). So the code would not work. But the user can't add that code. So this is a problem.\n\nBut according to the code provided, the code for the even case's loop is missing code. So perhaps the code inside the loop is supposed to print the pairs and then, after the loop, the code for the even case's block adds a new line. But the code provided doesn't have that.\n\nIn this case, the code provided is incorrect, but the user must proceed with filling in the code inside the loop, assuming that the code after the loop is correct. But that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the even case's loop is correct, and the code after the loop is handled elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at the code for the odd case:\n\npw.print(n + \" \");\nfor (int i=1; i <=n-1; i++) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \");\n}\npw.println();\n\nSo for the odd case, after printing all elements, a new line is added. So for the even case, the code must also add a new line after printing all elements. But in the code provided's even case, there's no new line.\n\nBut how to handle that. This suggests that the code provided is incorrect, and the user must add the new line in the even case's code.\n\nBut the code provided's even case's block has no code after the loop. So the code for the even case's block must be modified to add a new line after the loop. But the user can't do that because the code provided's even case's block doesn't have code there.\n\nTherefore, the code provided has a mistake. But the user must fill in the code inside the loop. So perhaps the code is supposed to print the pairs, and the code after the loop is not required. But that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the even case's loop is written such that the last element printed is followed by a new line. For example, in the last iteration of the loop, after printing the pair, add a new line. But that's not possible since for n=4, the loop runs for i=2 and 4. For i=4, which is the last iteration, print 4 3 followed by a new line. So the code would be:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    if (i ==n) {\n        pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \"\\n\");\n    } else {\n        pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n    }\n}\n\nBut this would work for n=4 (even), but for n=6, the loop would have i=2,4,6. So for i=6, the last iteration, it would print 6 5 followed by a new line. Then the output would be \"2 1 4 3 6 5\\n\", which is correct.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would check if i is equal to n (the last element in the loop), and if so, append a new line. Otherwise, append a space.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in the code inside the loop:\n\nif (i == n) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\n} else {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n}\n\nWait, but in that case, for n=4, i=2 and 4. For i=2, it would print \"2 1 \", and for i=4, print \"4 3\". Then, after the loop, there's no new line. So the code would output \"2 1 4 3\" followed by the next test case's output. Which is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the code for the odd case, the code adds a new line after all elements are printed. So the code for the even case must do the same. So perhaps the code inside the loop should print the pairs, and then after the loop, the code adds a new line. But again, the code provided doesn't have that.\n\nThis is a problem. But according to the problem statement, the code provided has missing lines or blocks, and the user must fill them in. So the user must assume that the code provided is missing the code inside the loop, and also possibly the new line. But given that the code provided's structure doesn't allow adding code after the loop, the user must find a way to output the new line within the loop.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can print the new line after the loop. But the code provided doesn't have code after the loop. So the user can't do that.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the code provided is missing the new line, and the user must include it in their answer. But according to the problem statement, the user must output only the missing code as plain text. So the missing code is the code inside the loop (printing the pairs) and the new line after the loop. But how?\n\nHmm. This is a dilemma. But given the code provided, the user can only fill in the code inside the loop. So perhaps the code provided is missing a new line, but the user can't fix that. So the correct code for the even case's loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1) + \" \");\n\nAnd then, after the loop, the code must have a pw.println(); but since the code provided doesn't have that, the user's code will be incorrect. But according to the problem's sample, the code for even n=4 must output a line with 2 1 4 3 followed by a new line.\n\nSo the code for even n is missing the new line. So the code provided is incorrect, and the user must find a way to add it.\n\nBut the user can't modify the code outside the loop. So perhaps the code provided has a mistake, and the user is supposed to add the new line inside the loop for the last element.\n\nSo for each iteration, check if it's the last element, and if so, print a new line.\n\nBut how to check if it's the last element.\n\nFor example, in the loop, for each i, after printing the pair, if i +2 >n, then it's the last iteration. So:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n; i +=2) {\n    pw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\n    if (i +2 >n) {\n        pw.println();\n    } else {\n        pw.print(\" \");\n    }\n}\n\nBut this would print a space after each pair except the last one, which prints a new line. But for n=4, the loop has i=2 and 4. For i=2: i+2=4, which is not greater than n (4). So the code would print a space. Then for i=4: i+2=6>4, so it prints a new line. So the code for n=4 would print \"2 1 4 3\\n\", which is correct.\n\nFor n=6: i=2,4,6. For i=2: prints space. i=4: space. i=6: new line. So the permutation would be \"2 1 4 3 6 5\\n\".\n\nSo this code inside the loop would handle the new line correctly.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, the print statements are additive. So for example, for i=2 in n=4, after printing \"2 1 \", then for i=4, it prints \"4 3\" and then a new line. So the line would be \"2 1 4 3\\n\".\n\nYes. So this code would handle the new line correctly.\n\nSo the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut wait, when i=4 in n=4, i+2 is 6, which is greater than n (4), so we print a new line. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code would handle the new line correctly.\n\nSo the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 >n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut the code in the loop is supposed to print the pair, then a space or new line. So for each pair, the code appends either a space or a new line.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, the print statements would accumulate, so the code would generate the correct output.\n\nSo this is the code that needs to be filled inside the loop.\n\nSo putting it all together, the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i +2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, the code would be written as:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nSo this code would handle the new line correctly.\n\nTherefore, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut the code must be written in Java syntax. So the code inside the loop is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, this is written as:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut this is two separate statements. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, the loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i=2; ...) {\n    // code here\n}\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, this is allowed. So this code would print the pairs and the new line.\n\nSo this is the correct code for the even case's loop.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nBut in Java, the code must be written properly. So for example:\n\npw.print(i + \" \" + (i-1));\nif (i + 2 > n) {\n    pw.println();\n} else {\n    pw.print(\" \");\n}\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code would handle the even case correctly, including the new line.\n\nThus, the answer is to fill in the loop with this code."
