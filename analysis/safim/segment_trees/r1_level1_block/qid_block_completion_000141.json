The cost is the maximum between the number of 0s left and the number of 1s removed. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a vector p that's being precomputed. The loop for j from 1 to x.length() increments p[j]. Then, lim is set to p.back(), which suggests that p is a prefix sum array. Oh right, maybe p is the prefix sum of 1s. Let me think. Wait, the code after precomputing p uses lim as the total number of 1s. Because when they loop j from 0 to j + lim <= x.length(), and then calculate lim - p[j + lim] + p[j], that looks like the number of 1s in the substring from j to j+lim.",

So the code's approach must be incorrect. But according to the user, the code is to be filled in. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm missing something. Wait, let's re-examine the sample input. The first test case is \"0011\". The code's approach would compute O as 2 (since there are two 1s). So the code loops j from 0 to j + 2 <= 4. So j can be 0,1,2. For each j, the window is j to j+2. For j=0: window is 0-1 (\"00\"), o=0. Cost is 2 - 0 = 2. For j=1: window is 1-2 (\"01\"), o=1. Cost is 2-1=1. For j=2: window is 2-3 (\"11\"), o=2. Cost is 0. So the minimal ans is 0. But according to the sample, the correct answer is 1. So this approach is wrong. So there's a problem here. Wait that can't be. So the code's approach is wrong, but the user is expecting us to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code is not correct as provided. But the user says that the code is missing some parts, and we have to fill them in. So perhaps the code is correct when the missing part is filled in. Hmm. So maybe the code's approach is different. Let me re-examine the code. In the code, after precomputing p (prefix sum of 1s), lim is set to p.back(). Then, the code loops j from 0 to j+lim <= x.length(). For each j, the code calculates lim - p[j+lim] + p[j]. Then ans is the minimum of these values. Wait, the code is for j in 0 <= j <= x.length() - lim. For each j, the window is j to j+lim-1, of length lim. So the code is considering all possible windows of length lim. Then, the code computes lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]) which is the number of 0s in the window.",

The maximum of these two is the same as the maximum of len_substring and total_1s minus o. Because if len_substring >= total_1s, then len_substring - o is larger than total_1s - o (since len_substring >= total_1s). Similarly, if total_1s >= len_substring, then the other term is larger. Wait no, that's not correct. For example, len_substring is 3, total_1s is 2. o is 1. Then, len_substring - o is 2, total_1s - o is 1. So maximum is 2. Which is max(3, 2) - 1 = 3-1=2. So the formula holds. Another example: len_substring=2, total_1s=3. o=2. Then len_substring - o is 0, total_1s - o is 1. Max is 1. max(2,3) is 3, 3-2=1. So the formula holds.

But how to compute this efficiently. An alternative approach is to split into two cases: L >= O and L <= O.\n\nCase 1: L >= O. Then the cost is L - o. We need to minimize L - o. But since L >= O, L can be any value from O to the maximum possible substring length (the entire string). For this case, since L is in the range [O, ...], the minimal value of L - o is when o is maximized.",

Then the cost would be max(L, 0) - 0 (since o is 0). So for L >= 0, cost is L. But the minimal is 0, which is achieved when L is 0 (removing all characters). So the code needs to handle cases where O is zero. But in the code provided, after computing ans, there's a check if ans is 1<<30 (which is a very high value), set ans to 0. That's probably to handle cases where O is zero, and there are no windows of length O (since O is zero, and the code's loop j + lim <= x.length() becomes j <= x.length(), but lim is zero, so the loop would run once for j=0, but the window is of length zero. So the code may not handle O=0 cases correctly. But perhaps the code's missing part is in the prefix sum. But back to the approach. Let's think how to compute max_o_all and max_o_for_L_ge_O.\n\nFor the first case (L >= O), the minimal (L - max_o) can be found by for each L starting from O to n, compute the maximum o for that L. Then compute (L - o) and take the minimum. For the second case (L <= O), compute the maximum o in any window of length up to O. Then compute (O - o). The minimal between these two cases is the answer. But how to compute these efficiently. For case 1:\n\nWe can compute the maximum o for each L >= O using a sliding window. For each L in O to n, the maximum o is the maximum number of 1s in any window of length L.",

But this can be computed using a sliding window approach where we track the maximum o for all possible window lengths up to O.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently. Alternatively, for case 2, the maximum o is the maximum possible o in any window of length <= O. To compute this, perhaps we can use a sliding window where we allow the window to expand until its length exceeds O, and track the maximum o.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum o for case 2 can be found by considering all possible windows of length <= O, and the maximum o among them. This can be found by using a sliding window approach where we track the number of 1s in the current window, and expand the window while it's length is <= O.\n\nWait, here's an approach for case 2:\n\nInitialize left = 0, current_sum = 0, max_o = 0. For right from 0 to n-1:\n\n   current_sum += (s[right] == '1')\n\n   while (right - left + 1) > O:\n\n       current_sum -= (s[left] == '1')\n\n       left +=1\n\n   if current_sum > max_o: max_o = current_sum\n\nSo, this way, we track the maximum number of 1s in any window of length up to O.

Let me re-examine the code. The code initializes p as a vector of size x.length() + 1. Then, for j from 1 to x.length(), it's accumulating something into p[j]. The missing code is the part inside this loop. The code must be accumulating the number of 1s. Because p[j] is a prefix sum array of 1s. So for the code to work, the missing line should be p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] == '1'). Yes, that's right. Because the string is 0-based, and j ranges from 1 to x.length(). For each j, p[j] is the sum of the first j characters. So x[j-1] is the j-th character (0-based), and p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] is '1'). So the missing code is p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] == '1').",

The possible windows of length 2 are:\n\n00 \u2192 o=0 \u2192 cost 2-0=2.\n\n01 \u2192 o=1 \u2192 cost 1.\n\n11 \u2192 o=2 \u2192 cost 0. So the minimal cost is 0.

So the sample's answer is incorrect. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 1. This is a contradiction. So perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, or the problem statement is different. But according to the problem statement's sample input, the first test case's answer is 1. So there's a mistake in my understanding. Wait, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect because the code's calculation of the cost is wrong.",

So in the first sample, the code's approach correctly finds the window \"11\", which is a valid substring, and the cost is 0. But the sample's answer is 1, which indicates that the code's approach is incorrect. This is a contradiction. But according to the problem statement's sample input, the first answer is 1. So the code's approach is incorrect. So what's the mistake in the code's approach? Ah! Maybe the code is not considering all possible windows.",

But in the first sample, the entire string has two 0s and two 1s. So the cost would be max(2, 0) = 2. But according to the code's approach, the window of length 2 (O=2) is considered, and the minimal cost is 0. So according to the code's approach, the answer is 0. But the sample says 1. So either the code is wrong, or the sample is wrong. This implies that the code's approach is wrong. But how can that be? Perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample's answer is wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, and there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. Another possibility: The code's approach is considering all possible windows of length O, but also other cases. For example, when the window is longer than O.\n\nWait, the code's loop is j from 0 to j+lim <= x.length(), where lim is O. But j+lim is the end index. So the window is of length lim. So the code's approach is only considering windows of length O.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the optimal solution can be in any window of any length. So the code's approach is incorrect.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum cost after removing some characters from the beginning and end of a binary string. The cost is the maximum between the number of 0s left and the number of 1s removed. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a vector p that's being precomputed. The loop for j from 1 to x.length() increments p[j]. Then, lim is set to p.back(), which suggests that p is a prefix sum array. Oh right, maybe p is the prefix sum of 1s. Let me think.\n\nWait, the code after precomputing p uses lim as the total number of 1s. Because when they loop j from 0 to j + lim <= x.length(), and then calculate lim - p[j + lim] + p[j], that looks like the number of 1s in the substring from j to j+lim. Because p is the prefix sum of 1s, p[j + lim] - p[j] would be the number of 1s in that interval. So lim minus that would give the number of 0s in that interval. Wait, but lim is the total number of 1s in the entire string. Wait no, maybe lim is the total number of 1s. Because p is built as a prefix sum. So p.back() would be the total count of 1s.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the loop for j from 1 to x.length() is filling the p array. The initial code's missing part is inside this loop. So I need to figure out what p[j] represents. Let's see.\n\nIf the code is using p as a prefix sum of 1s, then p[j] would be the number of 1s up to index j-1 (assuming 0-based). Because in the standard prefix sum setup, p[0] is 0, and p[1] is count of 1s in first element (index 0 in the string). So for each j, the code is accumulating the number of 1s.\n\nWait, the code has for j from 1 to x.length(), which probably runs for j in 1..x.length(), and the string is 0-based. So the original code's p array is a prefix sum array where p[j] is the number of 1s in the first j characters of the string. Or wait, maybe the string is processed as 0-based, and p[j] is the sum of the first j elements. For example, if the string is \"101\", then p[0] = 0, p[1] = 1, p[2] = 1, p[3] = 2. So p.back() would be the total number of 1s in the string. That makes sense.\n\nThen, the loop that follows is trying to find a substring (after removing some from the start and end) where the number of 0s in the substring is the number of 0s left (since the cost is max of that and the number of 1s removed). The number of 1s removed is the total 1s (lim) minus the 1s in the substring. Because if the substring has k 1s, then the 1s removed are lim - k. So the cost is max( (number of 0s in substring), (lim - k) ). But how does the code compute this?\n\nIn the code, they loop j from 0 to j + lim <= x.length(). Wait, j is the starting index, and the length of the substring is lim? Because lim is the total 1s. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, maybe they are considering substrings that have exactly k 1s, where k is the number of 1s in the substring. But the code uses lim (the total 1s) in the loop. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find a window where the number of 1s is as high as possible, thereby minimizing the number of 1s removed (lim - number of 1s in window) and the number of 0s in the window (which is the number of 0s left). The cost is the maximum of these two values. So the goal is to find a window where the maximum between (number of 0s in window) and (total 1s - number of 1s in window) is minimized.\n\nBut how does the code compute this? Let's see. For each possible window (after trimming the start and end), the window is a substring of the original string. Let the substring have z zeros and o ones. Then the cost is max(z, (lim - o)), since lim is the total number of 1s in the original string. Because the 1s removed are the original total minus the 1s in the substring. So the code is trying to find the minimum possible max(z, lim - o).\n\nBut since in the substring, the number of 0s is (length of substring - o), since each character is 0 or 1. So z = (length of substring) - o. So the cost is max( (length - o), (lim - o) ). Which can be written as max( length - o, lim - o ). So to minimize this, perhaps we can find a substring where (lim - o) is as small as possible and (length - o) is also as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to find for each possible number of 1s in the window, what's the minimal max value. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop is j from 0 to j + lim <= x.length(). Wait, j is the starting index. Then the window is from j to j + lim - 1. So the window has length lim. But why would the code be considering windows of length lim? Because lim is the total number of 1s in the string. Hmm. That doesn't seem to make sense. Unless perhaps the code is using a sliding window approach where they are considering all possible windows that could potentially minimize the cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the maximum number of 1s in any window, thereby minimizing the lim - o (since o is the number of 1s in the window). But how does this tie into the zeros in the window?\n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to find a window where the number of 1s is as high as possible, which would minimize lim - o (since o is higher). But then, the number of 0s in the window (z) would be (window length - o). So the cost is the maximum of (window length - o) and (lim - o). So the code is trying to minimize this maximum value.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think. For each possible window, compute the cost and find the minimum. But with the string length up to 2e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nLooking at the code's approach, they precompute the prefix sum of 1s. Then, they loop through all possible j where j + lim is <= the length of the string. Then, for each j, they compute lim - p[j+lim] + p[j]. Wait, p[j+lim] - p[j] is the number of 1s in the window starting at j with length lim. So lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]) is the number of 0s in the window. Wait, no. Because the window length is lim. The number of 1s is (p[j+lim] - p[j]). The number of 0s is lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]). Wait, no: the window is of length lim. So 0s = lim - o, where o is the number of 1s. So the code computes lim - (o) as the number of 0s in the window. Then, the code takes the maximum of this and the number of 1s removed (which is lim - o). But the code is taking lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]) (the 0s) and lim - o (the 1s removed). Wait, but those are the same as (lim - o) and (o is the number of 1s in the window). Wait, no: lim is the total number of 1s in the entire string. So the 1s removed is total_1s (lim) minus the 1s in the window. So that's lim - o. The 0s in the window is (window length) - o. But the window length in the code is j+lim - j = lim. So the code's code is correct in calculating the 0s as lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]).\n\nBut then the code computes lim - p[j+lim] + p[j] as the 0s in the window. Then, the cost for this window is the maximum between the 0s in the window and the 1s removed (which is lim - o = lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j])). So both are lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]). So the cost for this window is lim - (o) (since both terms are the same). Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, the cost is computed as (lim - p[j+lim] + p[j]) which is the 0s in the window, and (lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j])) which is the 1s removed. So the code's calculation is ans = min(ans, max( (0s in window), (1s removed) )).\n\nWait, no. The code says ans = min(ans, lim - p[j+lim] + p[j]). But wait, in this code, lim - p[j+lim] + p[j] is (lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j])) which is the 1s removed. Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\np[j+lim] is the prefix sum up to j+lim. p[j] is the prefix sum up to j. So p[j+lim] - p[j] is the number of 1s in the window of length lim. So lim (the window length) minus (p[j+lim] - p[j]) is the number of 0s in the window. Then, the 1s removed is the total 1s (lim, since p.back() is the total 1s) minus the 1s in the window. So 1s removed = lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]). So the code is taking the maximum of the number of 0s in the window (lim - o) and the number of 1s removed (lim - o). Oh wait, both are the same value. So the cost for this window is lim - o. So the code's approach is to find the minimal (lim - o) over all possible windows of length lim. But why is the window length fixed to lim?\n\nThat can't be right. Because lim is the total number of 1s in the entire string. So the window length is lim. So this approach is considering all possible windows of length equal to the total number of 1s in the string. But why?\n\nWait, that's a possible approach. Let's think: For example, if the total number of 1s in the string is O. Then, the code is looking for a window of length O. Because in such a window, the number of 1s can be O (if all 1s are in the window). Then, the number of 0s is O - o (window length is O, so 0s is O - o). The 1s removed is O - o. So the cost is max(O - o, O - o) = O - o. So the code is trying to find the minimal value of O - o, which is equivalent to maximizing o. Since O is fixed, the maximum o possible in a window of length O is the maximum number of 1s in any window of length O. So the code's approach is to find the maximum number of 1s in any window of length O, then the minimal cost would be O minus that maximum.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Let me see. Because the code is trying to find the window (after trimming start and end) that has as many 1s as possible in a window of length equal to the total number of 1s. So in this window, the number of 0s is O - o (window length is O, which is the total 1s). The 1s removed is O - o. So the cost is O - o. So to minimize this, o should be as large as possible, hence the code is trying to find the window of length O with the maximum number of 1s.\n\nBut what if the optimal window is not of length O? For example, maybe a window of smaller or larger length could yield a lower cost.\n\nWait, let's take the example from the note. The first test case is \"0011\". The total 1s is 2. The code's approach would look for a window of length 2. The possible windows are \"00\" (0 1s), \"01\" (1 1), \"11\" (2 1s). The maximum o is 2. So cost is 2 - 2 = 0. But the example's answer is 1. Wait, that's a problem. Oh wait, the code's approach is not correct then. So perhaps the code's approach is wrong. But according to the sample input, the first test case's answer is 1. But according to this code's approach, the answer would be 0. So that suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. So why is that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is not considering all possible window lengths. Because the code's current approach is to look at windows of length O (the total 1s), but maybe the optimal solution is to have a window of a different length.\n\nSo the code's approach must be incorrect. But according to the user, the code is to be filled in. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample input. The first test case is \"0011\". The code's approach would compute O as 2 (since there are two 1s). So the code loops j from 0 to j + 2 <= 4. So j can be 0,1,2. For each j, the window is j to j+2. For j=0: window is 0-1 (\"00\"), o=0. Cost is 2 - 0 = 2. For j=1: window is 1-2 (\"01\"), o=1. Cost is 2-1=1. For j=2: window is 2-3 (\"11\"), o=2. Cost is 0. So the minimal ans is 0. But according to the sample, the correct answer is 1. So this approach is wrong. So there's a problem here.\n\nWait that can't be. So the code's approach is wrong, but the user is expecting us to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code is not correct as provided. But the user says that the code is missing some parts, and we have to fill them in. So perhaps the code is correct when the missing part is filled in.\n\nHmm. So maybe the code's approach is different. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nIn the code, after precomputing p (prefix sum of 1s), lim is set to p.back(). Then, the code loops j from 0 to j+lim <= x.length(). For each j, the code calculates lim - p[j+lim] + p[j]. Then ans is the minimum of these values.\n\nWait, the code is for j in 0 <= j <= x.length() - lim. For each j, the window is j to j+lim-1, of length lim. So the code is considering all possible windows of length lim. Then, the code computes lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]) which is the number of 0s in the window. Also, the 1s removed is lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j]). So the cost is the maximum of these two values, which are the same. So the code is taking the maximum as that value and trying to find the minimum.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the code would compute the answer as 0, but the correct answer is 1. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is not correct. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the problem statement. The cost is the maximum of two values: the number of 0s left in the string and the number of 1s removed. So when you choose a substring (after trimming left and right), the 0s in the substring are the 0s left, and the 1s removed are the total 1s in the original string minus the 1s in the substring.\n\nSo the cost is max( (number of 0s in substring), (total_1s - number_of_1s_in_substring) ).\n\nThe code's approach is to find a substring where the maximum between these two is minimized.\n\nSo for each possible substring (after trimming), compute the cost and take the minimum.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe code seems to be using the following approach: For a window of length (total_1s), the cost is (number of 0s in window) = (window length - number_of_1s_in_window) = (total_1s - o). The 1s removed is (total_1s - o). So the cost is max( (total_1s - o), (total_1s - o) ), which is total_1s - o. So by finding the window of length total_1s with the maximum o, the code finds the minimum cost as total_1s - max_o. But in the first sample, the code's approach gives 0, but the correct answer is 1.\n\nSo what's wrong here?\n\nLet's look at the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1: \"0011\" \u2192 the optimal is to remove two from the start and one from the end. The remaining string is \"1\". The 0s left is 0, the 1s removed is 2 (original total 2, but 1 in substring \u2192 2-1=1. So the cost is max(0,1) =1. But according to the code's approach, the code would select the window \"11\" (length 2) where o=2, so cost is 0. But that's allowed? Because the window can be selected. So trimming the start and end to leave \"11\" as the substring. But in that case, the number of 0s left is 0, and the 1s removed is 2-2=0. So the cost is max(0,0)=0. So why is the sample answer 1?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says: \"Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\" But according to this scenario, the window is \"01\" (after removing two from start and one from end), which is \"01\". Oh wait, no. The original string is \"0011\". If we remove two from the beginning (leaves \"11\") and one from the end (leaves \"1\"), then the substring is \"1\". So 0 zeros left, 1's removed is 2-1=1. So cost is max(0,1) = 1.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the code is considering window of length 2 (the total 1s) which is \"11\", leading to cost 0. So why is the sample's answer 1?\n\nAh! Because in the code's approach, the window must be of length 2. But if the code chooses that window, then the substring is \"11\". Which requires removing two characters from the start (the first two 0s) and zero from the end. So the cost is max(0, 0) = 0. But according to the sample, the answer is 1. So this is a contradiction. So the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo why is this discrepancy?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the optimal is to remove two from the start and one from the end. The remaining string is \"1\". So the window is \"1\". But in this case, the window length is 1, not 2. So the code's approach of considering only windows of length lim (2) is missing this possibility.\n\nAh! So the code's approach is incorrect. Because the optimal solution may involve a window that is not of length lim (the total number of 1s). So the code's approach is not considering all possible window lengths, hence it's wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct approach?\n\nAlternative approach: The cost is max( z, r ), where z is the number of 0s left (z = number of 0s in the substring), r is the number of 1s removed (r = total_1s - o, where o is the number of 1s in the substring). The goal is to minimize max(z, r).\n\nWe can model this as follows: for any possible substring (after trimming), compute max( (len_substring - o), (total_1s - o) ), and find the minimal value.\n\nBut since len_substring can vary, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nNote that max(a, b) is the maximum of the two values. So to minimize this, we can find the point where a and b are as balanced as possible.\n\nLet's see:\n\nmax(len_substring - o, total_1s - o) = max( (len_substring - o), (total_1s - o) ) = max( (len_substring, total_1s) ) - o.\n\nWait, because len_substring - o and total_1s - o. The maximum of these two is the same as the maximum of len_substring and total_1s minus o. Because if len_substring >= total_1s, then len_substring - o is larger than total_1s - o (since len_substring >= total_1s). Similarly, if total_1s >= len_substring, then the other term is larger.\n\nWait no, that's not correct. For example, len_substring is 3, total_1s is 2. o is 1. Then, len_substring - o is 2, total_1s - o is 1. So maximum is 2. Which is max(3, 2) - 1 = 3-1=2. So the formula holds. Another example: len_substring=2, total_1s=3. o=2. Then len_substring - o is 0, total_1s - o is 1. Max is 1. max(2,3) is 3, 3-2=1. So the formula holds.\n\nSo, in general, max(len_substring - o, total_1s - o) = max(len_substring, total_1s) - o.\n\nSo the cost can be rewritten as max(len_substring, total_1s) - o.\n\nWe need to minimize this value over all possible substrings (after trimming).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the substring (contiguous) where max(len_substring, total_1s) - o is minimized.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's see. Let's denote total_1s as O. So the cost is max(L, O) - o, where L is the length of the substring and o is the number of 1s in it.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of this expression over all possible substrings.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to split into two cases: L >= O and L <= O.\n\nCase 1: L >= O. Then the cost is L - o. We need to minimize L - o. But since L >= O, L can be any value from O to the maximum possible substring length (the entire string). For this case, since L is in the range [O, ...], the minimal value of L - o is when o is maximized. Because for a given L, the minimal L - o is L - max_o (where max_o is the maximum possible o in a substring of length L). So the minimal for this case is the minimal (L - max_o) where L ranges from O to max_length.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nCase 2: L <= O. Then the cost is O - o. So for this case, the minimal value is O - max_o (since for a given L, o can be up to the maximum possible in any substring of length L. But since L can vary, we need to find the maximum o possible across all substrings of length <= O. Then O - max_o would be the minimal cost for this case.\n\nBut this approach still seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is either when L is as small as possible (to minimize max(L, O)), or when o is as large as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal solution can be found by considering all possible substrings where L is either O or O \u00b1 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the optimal solution. To minimize max(L, O) - o, we can have two possibilities:\n\n1. The optimal substring has L >= O. Then the cost is L - o. To minimize this, for each L >= O, find the maximum o possible (sliding window approach). The minimal cost for this case is the minimal (L - max_o) for L >= O.\n\nBut to find this, for each L starting from O up to the entire string length, compute the maximum o in any substring of length L, then compute L - o. The minimal of these values is the candidate.\n\nBut for a string of length up to 2e5, this would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\n2. The optimal substring has L <= O. Then the cost is O - o. To minimize this, we need to find the maximum o possible across all substrings of any length up to O. The minimal cost for this case is O - max_o_all.\n\nSo the overall minimal cost is the minimum between the minimal cost from case 1 and case 2.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nCompute max_o_all = maximum number of 1s in any substring with length up to O.\n\nCompute max_o_for_L_ge_O = for each L >= O, compute the maximum o in any substring of length L. Then compute (L - o) for each L and take the minimal.\n\nThe minimal cost is the minimum between (O - max_o_all) and the minimal (L - max_o_for_L_ge_O).\n\nBut how to compute these efficiently.\n\nBut how to compute max_o_all, the maximum number of 1s in any substring of length up to O.\n\nThis can be computed using a sliding window approach where we track the maximum number of 1s in windows of varying lengths up to O.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible o is O (all 1s in the string), but if there's a substring of length <= O with o = current_max, then max_o_all is O. But perhaps not.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"000\" and O is 0 (since there are no 1s). Then the cost would be max(L, 0) - 0 (since o is 0). So for L >= 0, cost is L. But the minimal is 0, which is achieved when L is 0 (removing all characters). So the code needs to handle cases where O is zero.\n\nBut in the code provided, after computing ans, there's a check if ans is 1<<30 (which is a very high value), set ans to 0. That's probably to handle cases where O is zero, and there are no windows of length O (since O is zero, and the code's loop j + lim <= x.length() becomes j <= x.length(), but lim is zero, so the loop would run once for j=0, but the window is of length zero. So the code may not handle O=0 cases correctly. But perhaps the code's missing part is in the prefix sum.\n\nBut back to the approach. Let's think how to compute max_o_all and max_o_for_L_ge_O.\n\nFor the first case (L >= O), the minimal (L - max_o) can be found by for each L starting from O to n, compute the maximum o for that L. Then compute (L - o) and take the minimum.\n\nFor the second case (L <= O), compute the maximum o in any window of length up to O. Then compute (O - o).\n\nThe minimal between these two cases is the answer.\n\nBut how to compute these efficiently.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nWe can compute the maximum o for each L >= O using a sliding window. For each L in O to n, the maximum o is the maximum number of 1s in any window of length L. This can be done in O(n) time with a sliding window.\n\nBut for L varying from O to n, each step would require moving the window by 1, which is O(n) time.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nWe need to find the maximum o in any window of length up to O. This can be done by sliding window for varying window lengths up to O. But this could be O(O * n) time, which is not acceptable when O is large (e.g., O = 2e5).\n\nAlternative approach for case 2: the maximum o in any window of length up to O is the same as the maximum o in all possible windows of length 1 to min(O, n). But this can be computed using a sliding window approach where we track the maximum o for all possible window lengths up to O.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for case 2, the maximum o is the maximum possible o in any window of length <= O. To compute this, perhaps we can use a sliding window where we allow the window to expand until its length exceeds O, and track the maximum o.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum o for case 2 can be found by considering all possible windows of length <= O, and the maximum o among them. This can be found by using a sliding window approach where we track the number of 1s in the current window, and expand the window while it's length is <= O.\n\nWait, here's an approach for case 2:\n\nInitialize left = 0, current_sum = 0, max_o = 0.\n\nFor right from 0 to n-1:\n\n   current_sum += (s[right] == '1')\n\n   while (right - left + 1) > O:\n\n       current_sum -= (s[left] == '1')\n\n       left +=1\n\n   if current_sum > max_o:\n\n       max_o = current_sum\n\nSo, this way, we track the maximum number of 1s in any window of length up to O. This runs in O(n) time.\n\nSo case 2 can be handled with this approach.\n\nBut then, the code provided in the original problem must have a different approach, but the code's current method is to find windows of length O (total_1s).\n\nSo, perhaps the code's approach is incomplete and needs to be adjusted.\n\nBut the code's current approach is to compute the minimal ans as the minimal of (O - o) for windows of length O, and then perhaps the other case is when the window is of length less than O. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct in certain cases. Let's see the sample input:\n\nSample 1: s = \"0011\", O = 2.\n\nIn case 2 (windows of length <= O=2), the maximum o is 2 (window \"11\"). So O - o is 0. For case 1 (windows of length >= O=2), the minimal (L - o) would be for L=2, o=2 \u2192 cost 0. So the minimal cost is 0. But the sample's correct answer is 1. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because in the sample input, the code's approach would return 0, but according to the problem statement, the correct answer is 1. This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo the code's approach must be wrong. Therefore, the code provided by the user must be incorrect. Hence, the missing code is not sufficient to solve the problem.\n\nSo what's the correct approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is not considering all possible window lengths. For example, in the first sample, the code's approach considers windows of length O=2, but the optimal solution requires a window of length 1.\n\nSo the code's approach is wrong. Hence, the code must have a different logic.\n\nBut the user's code is given, and the missing part is the filling of the p array. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the logic.\n\nWait, the code's current approach is to compute lim = p.back(), which is the total_1s. Then, for j in 0 to (x.length() - lim), it computes ans as the minimum between ans and (lim - (p[j+lim] - p[j])).\n\nThis is (lim - o), where o is the number of 1s in the window of length lim. But in the first sample, the code would compute this as 0 (for the window \"11\"), but the sample's answer is 1. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code's approach is wrong. Therefore, the code must be missing some other part of the logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the sample's explanation is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nSo where is the mistake in the code's approach?\n\nThe code's approach is considering only windows of length O (total_1s) and computes the minimal (O - o) over these. But in some cases, the optimal solution may require a window of length less than O.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the code's approach finds a window of length 2 with o=2 (cost 0). But according to the sample explanation, the cost is 1. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Let me re-examine the first sample.\n\nSample input 1: s = \"0011\"\n\nThe correct answer is 1. But according to the code's approach, the cost is 0. So how can that be?\n\nBecause if the code's approach is correct, then the sample's answer would be wrong. But that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the code's approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the code is not considering all possible windows. For example, the code's approach is to choose a window of length O and compute (O - o) as the cost, but perhaps there's another case where the cost is (L - o) for L > O.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is only considering one part of the possible cases, and there's another part that's missing.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, after computing the minimal ans for windows of length O, it checks if ans is 1<<30 (which is infinity) and sets it to 0. But perhaps there are other cases where ans could be 0, but that's correct.\n\nBut in the first sample, the code's approach returns 0, which would imply that the answer is 0, but according to the sample, it's 1. So there's a contradiction.\n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. But the user's code is given, and we are to fill in the missing parts. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is correct but there's a mistake in the calculation of the prefix sum.\n\nLet me re-examine the code.\n\nThe code initializes p as a vector of size x.length() + 1. Then, for j from 1 to x.length(), it's accumulating something into p[j]. The missing code is the part inside this loop.\n\nThe code must be accumulating the number of 1s. Because p[j] is a prefix sum array of 1s. So for the code to work, the missing line should be p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] == '1').\n\nYes, that's right. Because the string is 0-based, and j ranges from 1 to x.length(). For each j, p[j] is the sum of the first j characters. So x[j-1] is the j-th character (0-based), and p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] is '1').\n\nSo the missing code is p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] == '1').\n\nOnce this is filled in, the code's approach is to compute the minimal (O - o) for windows of length O. But in the first sample, this gives 0, but the correct answer is 1.\n\nSo why?\n\nAh! Because the code's approach is not considering other possible costs. The code is only considering windows of length O (total_1s). But the cost can also be higher if the window is of different length.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the optimal solution may require a window of length less than O.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the code's approach finds a window where the cost is 0, but according to the sample explanation, the optimal cost is 1. This indicates that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code's approach is not correct. So what's wrong with the code?\n\nThe code's approach is based on the assumption that the minimal cost is achieved by a window of length O. But that's not the case in the first sample. So why is the code's approach passing the sample?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So there must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the first sample.\n\nSample 1: s = \"0011\".\n\nO is 2.\n\nThe code's approach is to find the minimal (O - o) for windows of length O (2).\n\nThe possible windows of length 2 are:\n\n00 \u2192 o=0 \u2192 cost 2-0=2.\n\n01 \u2192 o=1 \u2192 cost 1.\n\n11 \u2192 o=2 \u2192 cost 0.\n\nSo the minimal cost is 0. So according to the code's approach, the answer is 0, but the sample says it's 1. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nBecause the sample's explanation must have chosen a different window. But according to the code's approach, the window \"11\" is valid. Why isn't that the optimal choice?\n\nAh! Because the code's approach allows trimming the start and end. So in the first sample, the entire string is \"0011\". To select the window \"11\" (characters 2 and 3), you need to remove the first two characters (00) and zero from the end. The resulting substring is \"11\". The number of 0s left is 0. The number of 1s removed is 2 - 2 = 0. So the cost is max(0, 0) = 0. Which is better than the sample's answer of 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 1. So this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, or that there's a misunderstanding of the problem statement.\n\nBut the sample explanation says:\n\n\"In the first test case, it's possible to remove two characters from the beginning and one character from the end. Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\"\n\nBut if we remove two from the beginning and one from the end, the remaining string is \"1\". So the window is \"1\". The number of 0s left is 0. The number of 1s removed is 2 (original total) - 1 (in the window) = 1. So cost is max(0, 1) =1.\n\nBut why would this be better than the window \"11\" which has a cost of 0?\n\nAh! Because the code's approach is correct, and the sample explanation is incorrect. Or perhaps the code is wrong, and the sample explanation is correct.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"You have to remove several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of the string, and then several (possibly zero) characters from the end of the string. The string may become empty after the removals.\"\n\nSo after removing from the beginning and end, the remaining string is a substring that can be any contiguous substring of the original string. So selecting the last two characters (\"11\") is allowed. That substring has two 1s. So the number of 0s left is zero. The number of 1s removed is 2 - 2 =0. So the cost is max(0, 0) = 0. So the sample's answer is incorrect. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 1. This is a contradiction.\n\nSo perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, or the problem statement is different.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample input, the first test case's answer is 1. So there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect because the code's calculation of the cost is wrong. The code computes ans as lim - p[j+lim] + p[j], which is (O - o). But the cost should be the maximum of (number of 0s in the window) and (O - o). But in the code, the code is assuming that both are equal, but they are not.\n\nAh! This is the mistake. The code is calculating the cost as lim - o (which is O - o), but the cost is actually max( (number of 0s in the window), (O - o) ). But in the code's approach, the code assumes that these two are equal, which is only true when the window's length is O.\n\nBecause number of 0s in the window is (window length - o). The window's length is O. So number of 0s is O - o. The code's approach is using O - o as the cost, which is correct for windows of length O. But for other window lengths, the cost is max( (window_length - o), (O - o) ), which may be higher than O - o.\n\nSo the code's approach is not considering other possible window lengths, which may have a higher cost.\n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. So the code needs to be modified to account for all possible window lengths.\n\nBut the user's code is as provided, and we're to fill in the missing code.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the code is correct, but there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Or perhaps the code is correct, and the sample's explanation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the sample's explanation is wrong. Because according to the code's approach, the first sample's answer is 0, which is better than the sample's explanation's answer of 1.\n\nSo what's the correct answer for the first sample?\n\nOriginal string: \"0011\".\n\nPossible options:\n\n1. Remove nothing. The entire string is kept. Number of 0s is 2. Number of 1s removed is 0. Cost is max(2, 0) = 2.\n\n2. Remove first two characters: \"11\" remains. Cost is max(0, 0) = 0.\n\nThis is possible. So the correct answer should be 0. But the sample's explanation says 1. So there's a contradiction. This implies that the sample's explanation is incorrect, or the problem statement is different.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample input, the first test case's answer is 1. So this suggests that the code is wrong.\n\nBut why is the sample's answer 1?\n\nLooking at the sample explanation:\n\n\"In the first test case, it's possible to remove two characters from the beginning and one character from the end. Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\"\n\nWait, removing two from the beginning (00) and one from the end (the last '1') leaves the string as \"1\". So the 0s left are zero. The 1s removed is 2 - 1 =1. So the cost is max(0, 1) =1. But why would this be the case when there's a better option?\n\nAh! This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. Because there's a window (the last two characters) which gives a cost of 0. But the sample says the answer is 1. So there's a contradiction.\n\nSo this implies that the problem statement has different conditions than what I understand. Perhaps the cost is computed differently.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\n\"The cost of the removal is the maximum of the following two values: the number of characters 0 left in the string; the number of characters 1 removed from the string.\"\n\nAh! The number of characters 1 removed from the string. Not the number of 1s removed from the original string. So the code's approach is wrong.\n\nThe code's approach assumes that the number of 1s removed is total_1s - o. But according to the problem statement, the number of 1s removed is the number of 1s in the original string that are not in the resulting substring. So that is indeed total_1s - o. So the code's approach is correct in this aspect.\n\nSo in the first sample, the optimal cost is 0. So the sample's explanation is wrong, but according to the problem statement's sample input, the answer is 1. So this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the code is wrong. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that you remove characters from the beginning and then from the end. The resulting string is the substring that is left. So the order of removals is first beginning, then end. For example, you can't remove characters from the end first. So the resulting substring must be a prefix of a suffix of the original string.\n\nWait, no. The order is: first remove some characters from the beginning (possibly zero), then remove some from the end (possibly zero). So the remaining string is a contiguous substring that starts at some index i and ends at some index j, where i <= j. For example, if the original string is \"abcde\", you can remove two from the beginning (i=2), then remove one from the end (j=3), resulting in \"c\".\n\nBut the remaining substring must be a contiguous block. So the code's approach of considering all possible substrings is correct.\n\nSo in the first sample, the code's approach correctly finds the window \"11\", which is a valid substring, and the cost is 0. But the sample's answer is 1, which indicates that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nThis is a contradiction. But according to the problem statement's sample input, the first answer is 1. So the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the mistake in the code's approach?\n\nAh! Maybe the code is not considering all possible windows. For example, the code is only considering windows of length O (total_1s), but the optimal cost may come from a window with a different length.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect. The correct approach should consider all possible window lengths.\n\nBut the user's code is as provided, and we need to fill in the missing code. So the code must be correct according to the problem's test cases, but how?\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the code's approach, but the code is passing the test cases. But according to the first sample, it's not. So why?\n\nPerhaps the code is correct, and the sample's explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the code's approach is correct and there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct for some other reason.\n\nAnother possibility is that the code's approach is not considering the case when the window is the entire string. But in the first sample, the entire string has two 0s and two 1s. So the cost would be max(2, 0) = 2.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the window of length 2 (O=2) is considered, and the minimal cost is 0.\n\nSo according to the code's approach, the answer is 0. But the sample says 1. So either the code is wrong, or the sample is wrong.\n\nThis implies that the code's approach is wrong. But how can that be?\n\nPerhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample's answer is wrong. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, and there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem.\n\nAnother possibility: The code's approach is considering all possible windows of length O, but also other cases. For example, when the window is longer than O.\n\nWait, the code's loop is j from 0 to j+lim <= x.length(), where lim is O. But j+lim is the end index. So the window is of length lim. So the code's approach is only considering windows of length O.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the optimal solution can be in any window of any length. So the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code is wrong, and we need to find the missing code that would fix it.\n\nBut the user's code is provided, and we need to fill in the missing part. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the way the cost is computed is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct for certain cases, but not all.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the code as provided and fill in the missing code as p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] == '1'), and see if that makes sense.\n\nBecause the missing code is the prefix sum of 1s, and the code's approach is to compute that.\n\nBut according to the first sample, this code would produce an incorrect answer. So why would the code be correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the sample's explanation is wrong.\n\nBut the sample's explanation says that the answer is 1, but according to the code's approach, the answer would be 0. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but there's a mistake in the code's logic. For example, the code computes ans as lim - o, but the correct cost is max( (window length - o), (lim - o) ), which is equal to max( window length, lim ) - o.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect because for windows of length O, the cost is O - o. But for windows of length L > O, the cost is L - o. For windows of length L < O, the cost is O - o. So the code's approach only considers windows of length O and computes O - o. But the minimal cost may come from a window of length L < O, where O - o is minimal, or from a window of length L > O, where L - o is minimal.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, it's only considering windows of length O. So it's possible that there's a window of length L > O where L - o is smaller than the minimal O - o.\n\nSo the code's approach is incomplete.\n\nBut the code is provided, and we need to fill in the missing part. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample's explanation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample's explanation is incorrect. But this is unlikely.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. But the user's code is provided, and the missing code is the prefix sum. So the missing code is p[j] = p[j-1] + (x[j-1] == '1').\n\nSo I'll provide that as the answer."
