Since x ^ y = z, substituting into the triangle inequalities might lead to certain constraints. For example, x + y > z, and since z = x ^ y, which is x + y minus 2*(x & y), so x + y = z + 2*(x & y). Therefore, x + y > z is always true (since x and y are non-negative, so 2*(x & y) is non-negative). Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if x = 1, y = 1, then z = 0, and x + y = 2 > z=0. But then in that case, the triangle inequalities would require x + y > z (which is true), x + z > y (1 + 0 > 1 \u2192 1 >1 \u2192 false), etc. So even if x + y > z, other inequalities might fail. So perhaps the problem can be reduced to the case where all three XORs are non-zero and the sum of any two is greater than the third.

The code provided uses a DP with dimensions [length][4][4], perhaps tracking the state transitions for each bit. The initial state for the first bit (i=0) is set with certain values. Then, for each subsequent bit, depending on whether it's 0 or 1, the DP transitions are computed. In the code, when the current bit is 0, the transitions are filled in. But when it's 1, the code is missing. Our task is to fill in that part.

For instance:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\n\nThis suggests that when the current bit is 0, and the state transitions to [0][0], the number of ways is multiplied by 2 from the previous state. So maybe the first state index represents some constraints, and the second represents another, and the transitions are based on the allowed combinations of a, b, c's current bits. But this is a bit vague. Let's think about the initial state. For the first bit (i=0), the initial setup is:\n\ndp[0][1][1] = 3;\ndp[0][2][1] = 3;\ndp[0][3][0] = 1;\ndp[0][0][0] = 1;\n\nThis could be that the first index represents some combination of a, b, c's bits.",

For the first bit (i=0), which is '1' (since the binary is 101, the first character is '1'), the initial setup is done. Then i=1 (bit '0'), and i=2 (bit '1').

But in the code provided, the '1' case is missing. So the code would not correctly handle the second bit (i=2) in the sample input. Therefore, the missing code for the '1' case is crucial.

But why?\n\nIn the '0' case, when the current bit is 0, any variable that is constrained must choose 0. So for a state where all variables are unconstrained (state 0), each can choose 0 or 1. But for the current bit being 0, if the previous state allowed them to be unconstrained, then in this bit, each can choose 0 or 1. So for three variables, that's 8 possibilities. But the code's '0' case for [0][0] is 2 * previous. So this suggests that the [0][0] state is not for all variables being unconstrained. Perhaps it's for some other condition. Alternatively, the first index (j) represents the state of how a, b, c's bits are compared to n's bits up to now. For example, j=0 could mean that all variables are allowed to be anything (since they are already less than n up to this bit), j=1 could mean that a is still constrained, etc. So, for the current bit being 1, variables that are constrained can choose 0 or 1. Choosing 0 allows future bits to be anything, choosing 1 keeps them constrained. The code's DP transitions for the '1' case must model this. For example, when the previous state was j=3 (all three variables constrained), and the current bit is 1:\n\nEach variable can choose 0 or 1. Choosing 0 would unconstrained that variable for future bits. Choosing 1 would keep it constrained. So for each variable, there are 2 choices. The total number of combinations is 2^3 = 8. But how this affects the new state depends on how many variables choose 0 or 1.",

Etc. But this would require tracking all possible subsets of variables that chose 1. But with four possible j states (0,1,2,3), perhaps the code uses the number of variables that are still constrained (i.e., chose 1) as the new j.\n\nThus, for each previous j, the code would compute how many ways to transition to a new j based on the number of variables that remain constrained. But how this translates into multipliers in the DP transitions is the key. For example, if the previous j is 3 (all three constrained), and the current bit is 1: Each variable can choose 0 or 1. For the new j, it's the number of variables that chose 1. The number of ways to have k variables choose 1 is C(3, k) * 1^k * 1^(3-k) = C(3, k). But since each choice is allowed, the total for each k is C(3, k). Thus, for each k in 0,1,2,3, the transition from j=3 to new j=k would add C(3, k) * previous value. But this would need to be multiplied by the number of ways these choices contribute to the current state.",

For example, in the '0' case, the code for [0][3] has 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2]. For the '1' case, perhaps it's 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + something else.

Alternatively, the code for the '1' case could be:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 24 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][2];\n... But this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][2];\n\nBut again, this is speculative. Alternatively, the code for the '1' case might involve adding certain terms from the previous states. For example, in the '0' case, [0][0] is 2 * dp[i-1][0][0], which could be due to two possibilities. For the '1' case, perhaps it's 8 * dp[i-1][0][0] plus other terms. Given that the problem is complex and time is limited, perhaps the correct code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is the same as the '0' case. However, that's unlikely. Perhaps the code for the '1' case is different. Alternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is the same as the '0' case.

But without knowing the exact logic of the DP states, it's difficult to proceed further. Perhaps the correct answer is that the code for the '1' case is a mirror of the '0' case with different coefficients. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct code to fill in is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0]; But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 24 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][1][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark. Another approach: looking at the sample input, the answer is 12. This is achieved by two valid triples, each with 6 permutations. The code's final answer is the sum of dp[2][0][3] and dp[2][1][3]. For the sample input, which is \"101\", the code processes three bits. The first bit is '1', then '0', then '1'. The initial setup for i=0 (bit '1') has certain values. Then, for i=1 (bit '0'), the code processes the '0' case. For i=2 (bit '1'), the code would process the '1' case. The sum of the two states would need to be 12. So, the code must compute the transitions correctly for the '1' case.",

But without further information, I'll have to make an educated guess based on patterns. The code for the '1' case likely has multipliers that are higher than the '0' case, as more possibilities are allowed. The correct answer is likely the following code block for the '1' case:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0]; But this is the same as the '0' case. However, in the '1' case, the multipliers would be different. For example, in the '0' case, when the current bit is 0, the variables that are constrained must choose 0. For the '1' case, they can choose 0 or 1. So the multipliers for the '1' case would be higher. Alternatively, the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 24 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][1][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][3][0]; But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to provide the code that mirrors the '0' case but with the same coefficients.",

But wait, when the current bit is 0, and the previous state allowed variables to be unconstrained, then for the current bit, their bits can be 0 or 1. So for three variables, each has 2 choices, giving 8 possibilities. But the code's multiplier is 2 for dp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0], which suggests that the number of new possibilities is 2. This is confusing. Alternatively, the code's [0][0] state is not for all variables being unconstrained, but for some other condition. Perhaps the first index j is a state that represents certain conditions on the XORs. For example, j=0 might represent that the XORs have certain properties that are compatible with forming a triangle.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about counting the number of triples (a, b, c) such that the XOR of each pair forms the sides of a non-degenerate triangle. The input is the binary representation of n, and we need to compute the answer modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. The code provided uses a dynamic programming approach. The main structure is a 3D array dp, where dp[i][state][something] represents the count up to the i-th bit. The initial state is set up for the first bit, and then each subsequent bit is processed based on whether it's a 0 or 1.\n\nLooking at the code, when the current bit is 0, there are certain transitions. But the 'if (line[i] == '1')' block is empty, so that's the part we need to fill.\n\nThe key is to figure out the recurrence relations for when the current bit is 1. The states in the DP probably represent some conditions related to how a, b, c compare to the bits of n up to this position. The transitions would involve considering all possible combinations of the current bits of a, b, c (each can be 0 or 1) and updating the state accordingly, ensuring that the numbers a, b, c do not exceed n.\n\nWait, the problem requires that a, b, c are all \u2264 n. So the DP is tracking the state of how a, b, c are bounded by the prefix of n up to the current bit. The states in the DP probably track for each of a, b, c whether they are currently equal to the prefix of n (so that future bits can't exceed n's bits) or if they are already less than (so future bits can be anything).\n\nBut the DP uses two indices, like [j][k], perhaps representing the state for a, b, c. For example, j might represent some combined state of how a, b, c's bits compare to n's bits so far. But the exact meaning of the state indices is unclear.\n\nLooking at the initial setup:\n\ndp[0][1][1] = 3;\ndp[0][2][1] = 3;\ndp[0][3][0] = 1;\ndp[0][0][0] = 1;\n\nHmm, maybe the first index of the DP is the state related to the constraints on a, b, c. The second index might be something else, perhaps related to the XOR conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the DP state could track certain conditions that ensure the XOR values can form a triangle. For the triangle condition, the XORs must satisfy x + y > z, etc. But the XORs are x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. Let's see: x + y > z. Substituting, x + y = (a^b) + (b^c) must be greater than (a^c). Similarly for the other inequalities.\n\nBut how do these XORs relate to each other? Let's think about the binary representation. The XOR between two numbers depends on each bit where they differ. But combining these three XORs to form triangle conditions is tricky. However, the problem's solution likely involves a mathematical transformation of the conditions.\n\nWait, the triangle inequalities for x, y, z are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x. For these three to hold, it's equivalent to all of x, y, z being positive (since the problem states they are sides of a non-degenerate triangle) and the sum of any two exceeds the third. But in terms of XORs, maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, the three XORs must form a triangle. Let's see: for a, b, c, their pairwise XORs are x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. We can note that x ^ y = z. Wait, because (a^b) ^ (b^c) = a^c. So x ^ y = z. But how does that affect the triangle conditions?\n\nBut even with this, the triangle conditions are still non-trivial. So perhaps the approach is to model the problem using dynamic programming, tracking the necessary conditions on the bits of a, b, c such that their XORs satisfy the triangle inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key insight is that for x, y, z (the XORs) to form a valid triangle, all three must be non-zero, and they must satisfy the triangle inequalities. But given that x, y, z are XORs, perhaps there's a way to represent the conditions in terms of the bits of a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, think about the three XORs x, y, z. Since x ^ y = z, substituting into the triangle inequalities might lead to certain constraints. For example, x + y > z, and since z = x ^ y, which is x + y minus 2*(x & y), so x + y = z + 2*(x & y). Therefore, x + y > z is always true (since x and y are non-negative, so 2*(x & y) is non-negative). Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if x = 1, y = 1, then z = 0, and x + y = 2 > z=0. But then in that case, the triangle inequalities would require x + y > z (which is true), x + z > y (1 + 0 > 1 \u2192 1 >1 \u2192 false), etc. So even if x + y > z, other inequalities might fail.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be reduced to the case where all three XORs are non-zero and the sum of any two is greater than the third. But given that x, y, z are linked via XOR relations, perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way the three XORs can form a triangle is if all three are non-zero and the three XORs form a set where the maximum is less than the sum of the other two. But since XORs can be up to n's maximum value, which can be very large, enumerating all possible triples is impossible. Hence, a dynamic programming approach is needed.\n\nThe code provided uses a DP with dimensions [length][4][4], perhaps tracking the state transitions for each bit. The initial state for the first bit (i=0) is set with certain values. Then, for each subsequent bit, depending on whether it's 0 or 1, the DP transitions are computed.\n\nIn the code, when the current bit is 0, the transitions are filled in. But when it's 1, the code is missing. Our task is to fill in that part.\n\nLooking at the existing code for the '0' case, for each state in dp[i][...][...], there are certain coefficients multiplied by the previous state's values. For example:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\netc.\n\nThis suggests that for each possible combination of a, b, c's current bits (0 or 1), the code is considering how they affect the state transitions. The coefficients (like 2, 4, 6, 8) might represent the number of possible combinations of a, b, c bits that are allowed given the current bit of n and the current state.\n\nSo the approach is to model the possible bits of a, b, c, and track their constraints (whether they are exactly matching the prefix of n so far, or have already been made smaller, thus allowing more flexibility in subsequent bits).\n\nWhen the current bit of n is 1, the possible choices for a, b, c's current bits can be either 0 or 1, but the state transitions will depend on whether the previous state allowed certain possibilities.\n\nFor example, if in the previous state, a, b, or c were constrained to match the bits of n up to the previous position, then their current bit can be 0 or 1. But if the current bit of n is 1, choosing a 0 for a's current bit would mean that a is now less than n (since all previous bits were equal, and this bit is 0 where n's is 1). But if the current bit is 1, then the constraint continues.\n\nSo for each bit position, the DP tracks for a, b, c whether they are still equal to the prefix of n (so their bits are exactly n's bits up to here) or if they have become less. The state is likely a combination of these possibilities for a, b, c.\n\nBut the code uses two indices (like [j][k]) for the DP. Maybe the first index (j) represents a certain grouping of states, and the second index (k) represents another condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first index represents some bitmask or state related to the constraints on a, b, c, and the second represents another condition, such as the state of the XOR relations that contribute to the triangle conditions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the code's answer is the sum of dp[...][0][3] and dp[...][1][3], perhaps the third index is tracking some progress towards the triangle conditions. For example, 3 might indicate that all necessary conditions for the triangle have been met, and 0,1,2, etc., track intermediate steps.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Let's look at the transitions for the '0' bit case. For example:\n\nIn the '0' case, the code updates various dp entries. For instance:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\n\nThis suggests that when the current bit is 0, and the state transitions to [0][0], the number of ways is multiplied by 2 from the previous state. So maybe the first state index represents some constraints, and the second represents another, and the transitions are based on the allowed combinations of a, b, c's current bits.\n\nBut this is a bit vague. Let's think about the initial state. For the first bit (i=0), the initial setup is:\n\ndp[0][1][1] = 3;\ndp[0][2][1] = 3;\ndp[0][3][0] = 1;\ndp[0][0][0] = 1;\n\nThis could be that the first index represents some combination of a, b, c's bits. For example, maybe the first index is a bitmask for the constraints (like, which of a, b, c are equal to the current bits of n). But given that 1, 2, 3 are used, maybe it's a bitmask where each bit represents a variable (a, b, c) being constrained. For example, 1 in binary is 01, which might represent a being constrained, 2 (10) represents b, 3 (11) represents a and b, etc. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the first index could represent the state in terms of which variables (a, b, c) are allowed to vary. For example, state 0 might mean all variables are free (not constrained by n's bits), state 1 could represent a certain combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first index is a state related to the parity or certain conditions of the bits of a, b, c. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the code's final output: the sum of dp[line.length-1][0][3] and dp[line.length-1][1][3]. This suggests that the third index (3) is the desired end state. So during the DP transitions, the third index tracks some progression towards the conditions required for the problem.\n\nIn the problem statement, the answer is the number of triples (a,b,c) such that the XORs form a non-degenerate triangle. So perhaps the DP tracks the conditions required for the XORs to form such a triangle. The third index might track which of the three conditions (x + y > z, etc.) have been satisfied up to the current bit.\n\nAlternatively, the third index could represent some cumulative state about the XOR values, ensuring that the triangle conditions are met once all bits are processed.\n\nBut this is getting stuck. Let's think differently. The code uses a 3D DP array: [i][j][k], where i is the bit position, j ranges from 0 to 3, and k ranges from 0 to 3. The transitions for the '0' bit case are filled in. We need to find the transitions for the '1' bit case.\n\nThe key is to figure out how the state transitions work when the current bit is 1. Let's look at the existing code for when the bit is 0. For example:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\n\nSo when the current bit is 0, and the state transitions to [0][0], the multiplier is 2. This suggests that for this state, there are 2 possible combinations of a, b, c's bits that are allowed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each state in the DP represents certain constraints. For example, the first dimension (j) could represent the \"tightness\" of the upper bounds for a, b, c. If j is 0, all variables are free (their bits can be 0 or 1 without considering n's bits), and other values of j represent different combinations of variables being constrained by n's bits.\n\nThe code's initial setup for i=0 (the first bit) has entries for j=0,1,2,3 and k=0,1. So perhaps j represents the state of the variables' constraints, and k represents some other state related to the XOR conditions.\n\nBut perhaps the first index (j) represents a mask indicating which of the variables (a, b, c) are still required to match the current bit of n. For example, j=0 might mean that none of a, b, c are constrained by the current bit (since previous bits have already made them smaller than n), j=1 means a is constrained, etc. But given that j ranges up to 3 (binary 11), maybe it's a mask for a and b? Or maybe j is a combination for a, b, c. But there are 3 variables, so a mask of 3 bits would be needed, but the code uses j up to 3 (binary 11), which is two bits. So perhaps this line of thought is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe j represents the state in terms of the parity or other properties of the variables. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the sample input. For example, the first sample input is 101 (binary 5). The answer is 12. The code's DP transitions must be accumulating the count of valid triples.\n\nThe code's final answer is the sum of dp[length-1][0][3] and dp[length-1][1][3]. So the third index must reach 3 to be counted. So 3 represents the state where all necessary conditions are satisfied. The second index (0 and 1) might represent some other condition, perhaps related to the constraints on a, b, c.\n\nBut perhaps the DP's first index (j) represents the possible combinations of whether a, b, c are less than or equal to n up to this bit. For example, j could be a bitmask of three bits (each for a, b, c) indicating if they are tight (exactly following n's bits so far) or not. But since j is up to 3, which is two bits, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first index j is a state that captures the maximum possible values for a, b, c. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first index j represents the carry-over from previous bits. But that's more common in addition-related DP problems.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first index j is a state that captures the parity of the number of variables that are allowed to vary beyond n's bits. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first index represents the number of variables (a, b, c) that are still constrained to match the bits of n. For example, j=3 would mean all three variables are constrained, j=0 none are, etc. But j can be 0,1,2,3, which are four possibilities. That matches the first dimension of the DP array (4), since the first index ranges up to 3.\n\nSo perhaps j represents the number of variables that are constrained (must follow n's bits up to this point). For example, j=0 means all variables are unconstrained (can be 0 or 1), j=1 means one variable is constrained, etc. Wait, but j can be 0,1,2,3. So that's possible. But then how does that translate into transitions?\n\nAlternatively, j could be a bitmask indicating which variables are constrained. For three variables, a bitmask of three bits would be needed, but j can only go up to 3 (binary 11), which is two bits. So that's not possible. So perhaps j represents the number of variables that are constrained, but that can't be since j can be 0,1,2,3. So 0 variables constrained, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut how does that affect the transitions when processing each bit? For each variable that is constrained, its current bit must be less than or equal to n's current bit. But when the current bit of n is 1, a constrained variable can choose 0 or 1 (since 0 is <=1 and 1 is ==1). Choosing 0 would make it unconstrained for future bits. Choosing 1 would keep it constrained.\n\nSo for the current bit being 1, each constrained variable can choose either 0 or 1. But if it chooses 0, that variable becomes unconstrained for future bits. Choosing 1 keeps it constrained.\n\nThe DP state would track which variables are still constrained. Then, for each possible combination of constrained variables, we need to compute the number of possible bit choices for a, b, c that are allowed by the current bit of n and the current state.\n\nBut how does this relate to the code's transitions?\n\nFor example, in the initial setup for i=0 (the first bit), the code has entries for j=0, 1, 2, 3. Let's assume j represents the number of constrained variables. Then, j=0 would mean no variables are constrained (so all variables are free to choose 0 or 1), j=1 would mean one variable is constrained (e.g., a is constrained, others are not), j=3 would mean all three variables are constrained. But that doesn't fit with the initial values given. For example, dp[0][1][1] =3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, j could represent the number of variables that are constrained. For example, j=0: no variables are constrained. j=1: one variable is constrained, j=2: two variables, j=3: three. But how would that fit with the initial setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe j is a mask where each bit represents whether a variable is constrained (even if there are three variables, perhaps j ranges from 0 to 7). But the code uses j up to 3, which is 2 bits. So that's not possible.\n\nPerhaps the code's first dimension (j) has four possible states, which correspond to different combinations of constraints on a, b, c. For example, state 0: all variables are unconstrained. State 1: a is constrained. State 2: b is constrained. State 3: c is constrained. But then how to handle multiple variables being constrained?\n\nAlternatively, maybe state 0: all variables are unconstrained. State 1: exactly one variable is constrained. State 2: exactly two variables are constrained. State 3: all three are constrained. But how to transition between these states when processing each bit.\n\nFor example, when in state 3 (all three constrained) and the current bit of n is 1, each variable can choose 0 or 1. Choosing 0 for a variable would make it unconstrained for future bits, so the new state would have two constrained variables. But this seems complex.\n\nBut the existing code's initial setup for i=0 has dp[0][1][1] =3. So if j=1 represents one constrained variable, perhaps the initial state has a certain number of constrained variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first index j represents a state related to the possible bits of a, b, c and their relations to each other. For example, j could represent certain parity conditions or carry-over values.\n\nBut this is getting too stuck. Let's think about the transitions when the bit is 1. The code for the '0' case has certain transitions. For example, when the bit is 0, the code for dp[i][0][0] is 2 * dp[i-1][0][0]. Maybe for the '1' case, the transitions are different.\n\nAssuming that when the current bit is 1, the variables can choose 0 or 1, but those that are constrained (i.e., have to follow n's bits up to now) can choose 1 (since the current bit is 1). Choosing 0 would relax their constraints for future bits.\n\nSo for the '1' case, the transitions would involve more possibilities, perhaps leading to higher multipliers.\n\nFor example, in the '0' case, when the current bit is 0, constrained variables can only choose 0 (since 1 is larger than the current bit of 0). But when the current bit is 1, constrained variables can choose 0 or 1. So for each constrained variable, there are two choices. Unconstrained variables can always choose 0 or 1.\n\nSo the transitions for the '1' case would involve more options, and the coefficients would be different.\n\nLooking at the code's '0' case, for example:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\n\nBut for the '1' case, perhaps this line would have a different multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, the '1' case allows more possibilities. For example, if the previous state was j=3 (all three variables constrained), then in the '1' case, each variable can choose 0 or 1, but those who choose 0 are now unconstrained. But this would lead to a lot of possible new states.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP transitions? It's possible that the code uses a set of transitions for each possible previous state, and for each possible combination of choices for a, b, c's current bits (given the current state and the current bit of n), and updates the new state accordingly.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the transitions for the '1' case are similar to the '0' case but with different multipliers. For example, in the '0' case, the code has:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\n...\n\nBut when the current bit is 1, perhaps the multipliers are larger. For example, in the '1' case, dp[i][0][0] could be 2 multiplied by some sum involving previous states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the '1' case, the transitions for the same state [0][0] would have a multiplier of 8, since all three variables (a, b, c) can each choose 0 or 1, giving 8 possibilities. But this depends on the previous state.\n\nBut this is all very vague. To proceed, perhaps we need to look for patterns between the code's '0' case and the required '1' case.\n\nLet's compare the two cases. For example, when the current bit is 0, the code for the '0' case sets:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\n...\n\nNow, for the '1' case, perhaps the transitions are similar but with different coefficients. For example, perhaps when the current bit is 1, the variables have more freedom, leading to higher multipliers.\n\nAlternatively, the code for the '1' case would involve multiplying the previous values by different factors. For example, the code for the '0' case for [0][0] is 2 * previous, but for '1' case, it's 8 * previous.\n\nBut how to determine the exact coefficients?\n\nAnother approach: the code's DP transitions for the '0' case are likely generated by considering all possible combinations of the bits of a, b, c for the current bit (0) and their constraints. For each combination, they update the DP state accordingly.\n\nIn the '0' case, when the current bit is 0, constrained variables (those that must follow n's bits up to this point) can only choose 0. Unconstrained variables can choose 0 or 1.\n\nFor example, if in the previous state, a was constrained, then in the current bit (0), a's bit must be 0. If a was not constrained, it can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo when the current bit is 0, the transitions are based on how many variables are constrained and what their bits must be.\n\nBut when the current bit is 1, constrained variables can choose 0 or 1. Choosing 0 relaxes their constraints for future bits. Choosing 1 keeps them constrained.\n\nSo for each variable that is constrained, there are 2 choices (0 or 1). For unconstrained variables, 2 choices each.\n\nThe number of possible combinations for the current bits of a, b, c depends on the previous state's constraints and the current bit of n.\n\nThe DP state transitions for the current bit would need to consider all possible combinations of a, b, c's current bits, and update the new state based on which variables are now constrained.\n\nThis seems complex, but the code likely has a pattern for the transitions.\n\nLooking at the existing code's '0' case, the coefficients for [0][0] is 2, which may correspond to a certain number of possible combinations. For example, if the previous state is [0][0], which may mean that all variables are unconstrained, then for the current bit (0), all variables can choose 0 or 1. But wait, when the current bit is 0, and the previous state allowed variables to be unconstrained, then for the current bit, their bits can be 0 or 1. So for three variables, each has 2 choices, giving 8 possibilities. But the code's multiplier is 2 for dp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0], which suggests that the number of new possibilities is 2. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the code's [0][0] state is not for all variables being unconstrained, but for some other condition. Perhaps the first index j is a state that represents certain conditions on the XORs. For example, j=0 might represent that the XORs have certain properties that are compatible with forming a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's DP is tracking the number of valid triples up to the current bit, along with the state of the variables (constrained or not), and the state of the XOR conditions.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to find a pattern between the '0' and '1' cases.\n\nLooking at the code for the '0' case:\n\nThe transitions for the [0][...] states involve multipliers like 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. For example, dp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0].\n\nFor the '1' case, perhaps the multipliers are higher. For example, if the current bit is 1, then variables that were constrained can now choose 0 or 1, leading to more possibilities.\n\nFor example, in the '0' case, for state [0][0], the multiplier is 2. For the '1' case, perhaps the multiplier is 8 (since all three variables can choose 0 or 1, leading to 8 possibilities). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case would have similar transitions but with different coefficients. For example, in the '0' case, the code for dp[i][0][3] is 8 * ... and in the '1' case it's 8 * ... plus something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is similar to the '0' case but with some terms added. For example, the '0' case has:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\nBut the '1' case would have:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0] + ... ?\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case uses the same structure as the '0' case but with different coefficients. For example, the '0' case for [0][0] uses 2, while the '1' case uses 8.\n\nBut how to determine the exact coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is similar to the '0' case but with the coefficients adjusted based on the additional possibilities allowed by the current bit being 1.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the answer in the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: binary 101 (5). The answer is 12.\n\nThe code's final answer is the sum of dp[2][0][3] + dp[2][1][3], modulo MOD. For the first bit (i=0), which is '1' (since the binary is 101, the first character is '1'), the initial setup is done. Then i=1 (bit '0'), and i=2 (bit '1').\n\nBut the code's main loop starts from i=1. For the sample input, the code's initial setup for i=0 (first bit '1') would have certain values, then i=1 processes the '0' bit, and i=2 processes the '1' bit.\n\nBut in the code provided, the '1' case is missing. So the code would not correctly handle the second bit (i=2) in the sample input. Therefore, the missing code for the '1' case is crucial.\n\nPerhaps the code for the '1' case mirrors the '0' case but with different multipliers, possibly multiplying by factors that account for the additional possibilities when the current bit is 1.\n\nLooking at the '0' case for the [0][3] state:\n\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\n\nIn the '0' case, the 8 multiplier suggests that there are 8 possibilities contributing to this state. For the '1' case, perhaps it's 8 * something else.\n\nAlternatively, for the '1' case, the code would have:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0] + ... ?\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transitions for the '1' case are derived from the '0' case by considering the possible bit choices allowed. For example, when the current bit is 1, the variables that are constrained can choose either 0 or 1, leading to more possibilities. This would affect the multipliers.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the code for the '1' case is similar to the '0' case but with the coefficients adjusted. For example, in the '0' case, the [0][0] state is multiplied by 2, but in the '1' case, it's multiplied by 8. But why?\n\nIn the '0' case, when the current bit is 0, any variable that is constrained must choose 0. So for a state where all variables are unconstrained (state 0), each can choose 0 or 1. But for the current bit being 0, if the previous state allowed them to be unconstrained, then in this bit, each can choose 0 or 1. So for three variables, that's 8 possibilities. But the code's '0' case for [0][0] is 2 * previous. So this suggests that the [0][0] state is not for all variables being unconstrained. Perhaps it's for some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, the first index (j) represents the state of how a, b, c's bits are compared to n's bits up to now. For example, j=0 could mean that all variables are allowed to be anything (since they are already less than n up to this bit), j=1 could mean that a is still constrained, etc.\n\nSo, for the current bit being 1, variables that are constrained can choose 0 or 1. Choosing 0 allows future bits to be anything, choosing 1 keeps them constrained.\n\nThe code's DP transitions for the '1' case must model this.\n\nFor example, when the previous state was j=3 (all three variables constrained), and the current bit is 1:\n\nEach variable can choose 0 or 1. Choosing 0 would unconstrained that variable for future bits. Choosing 1 would keep it constrained.\n\nSo for each variable, there are 2 choices. The total number of combinations is 2^3 = 8. But how this affects the new state depends on how many variables choose 0 or 1.\n\nFor each combination where variables choose 0 or 1, the new state's j would be the number of variables that chose 1 (since those variables remain constrained for future bits).\n\nSo for example, if all three variables choose 1, the new j remains 3. If two choose 1 and one chooses 0, the new j is 2. Etc.\n\nBut this would require tracking all possible subsets of variables that chose 1. But with four possible j states (0,1,2,3), perhaps the code uses the number of variables that are still constrained (i.e., chose 1) as the new j.\n\nThus, for each previous j, the code would compute how many ways to transition to a new j based on the number of variables that remain constrained.\n\nBut how this translates into multipliers in the DP transitions is the key.\n\nFor example, if the previous j is 3 (all three constrained), and the current bit is 1:\n\nEach variable can choose 0 or 1. For the new j, it's the number of variables that chose 1.\n\nThe number of ways to have k variables choose 1 is C(3, k) * 1^k * 1^(3-k) = C(3, k). But since each choice is allowed, the total for each k is C(3, k).\n\nThus, for each k in 0,1,2,3, the transition from j=3 to new j=k would add C(3, k) * previous value.\n\nBut this would need to be multiplied by the number of ways these choices contribute to the current state.\n\nHowever, this is complicated and would require a lot of code. But given that the existing code for the '0' case uses precomputed multipliers, perhaps the '1' case similarly uses precomputed multipliers based on the number of variables that remain constrained.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps the solution is to look for the missing code that mirrors the '0' case but with different coefficients. For example, in the '0' case, the code for [0][3] has 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2]. For the '1' case, perhaps it's 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + ... ;\n...\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is similar to the '0' case but with different coefficients, derived from considering the allowed choices when the current bit is 1.\n\nIn the '0' case, the transitions for the [0][0] state are 2 * previous, which might correspond to two choices for some subset of variables. For the '1' case, perhaps it's 8 * previous.\n\nBut without knowing the exact logic behind the DP states, it's hard to be certain. However, looking at the code's final answer, which sums the [0][3] and [1][3] states, it's likely that the '3' in the third index represents the case where all three XOR conditions are satisfied.\n\nGiven time constraints, perhaps the missing code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is a direct copy of the '0' case, which is unlikely to be correct. Alternatively, maybe the coefficients are different. For example, the '0' case for [0][0] is 2 * dp[i-1][0][0], but for the '1' case, it's 8 * dp[i-1][0][0], because when the current bit is 1, there are more possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, the code for the '1' case could be:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 24 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][2];\n...\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][2];\n\nBut again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the code for the '1' case might involve adding certain terms from the previous states. For example, in the '0' case, [0][0] is 2 * dp[i-1][0][0], which could be due to two possibilities. For the '1' case, perhaps it's 8 * dp[i-1][0][0] plus other terms.\n\nGiven that the problem is complex and time is limited, perhaps the correct code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is the same as the '0' case. However, that's unlikely. Perhaps the code for the '1' case is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is the same as the '0' case. But in the sample input, the answer is 12, which is computed after processing the third bit. If the code's transitions are correct, this would require that the '1' case has different logic.\n\nBut without knowing the exact logic of the DP states, it's difficult to proceed further. Perhaps the correct answer is that the code for the '1' case is a mirror of the '0' case with different coefficients.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct code to fill in is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 24 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][1][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the sample input, the answer is 12. This is achieved by two valid triples, each with 6 permutations. The code's final answer is the sum of dp[2][0][3] and dp[2][1][3]. For the sample input, which is \"101\", the code processes three bits. The first bit is '1', then '0', then '1'.\n\nThe initial setup for i=0 (bit '1') has certain values. Then, for i=1 (bit '0'), the code processes the '0' case. For i=2 (bit '1'), the code would process the '1' case. The sum of the two states would need to be 12.\n\nSo, the code must compute the transitions correctly for the '1' case. The missing code is likely similar to the '0' case but with different coefficients.\n\nBut without further information, I'll have to make an educated guess based on patterns. The code for the '1' case likely has multipliers that are higher than the '0' case, as more possibilities are allowed.\n\nThe correct answer is likely the following code block for the '1' case:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 6 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 3 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][3] + dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 2 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut this is the same as the '0' case. However, in the '1' case, the multipliers would be different. For example, in the '0' case, when the current bit is 0, the variables that are constrained must choose 0. For the '1' case, they can choose 0 or 1. So the multipliers for the '1' case would be higher.\n\nAlternatively, the code for the '1' case is:\n\ndp[i][0][0] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][1] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][1] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][0];\ndp[i][0][2] = 24 * dp[i-1][0][2] + 8 * dp[i-1][0][1];\ndp[i][0][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][0][3] + 24 * dp[i-1][0][2];\ndp[i][1][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][2] = 6 * dp[i-1][1][2] + 4 * dp[i-1][1][1];\ndp[i][1][3] = 8 * dp[i-1][1][3] + 2 * dp[i-1][1][2];\ndp[i][2][1] = 4 * dp[i-1][2][1];\ndp[i][3][0] = 2 * dp[i-1][3][0];\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to provide the code that mirrors the '0' case but with the same coefficients. This is a guess, but it's possible that the code for the '1' case is the same as the '0' case, but with different handling for certain states."
