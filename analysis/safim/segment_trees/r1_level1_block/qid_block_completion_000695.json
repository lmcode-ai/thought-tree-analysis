So for the code, elements at even positions in the array (0-based) are the even indices (1-based). Wait no, because 0-based index 0 is 1-based index 1 (odd). So in the code, for i=0 (0-based), that's 1-based index 1 (odd), so the code's 'even1' and 'odd1' variables are for the odd indices (1-based). Similarly, the else part (i%2 ! =0) would be even indices in 1-based terms. The variables even1 and odd1 track the parities of elements at the original odd positions (1-based). Even1 is set if there's an even number in an original odd position, odd1 if there's an odd.",

For example, i=0 (0-based) \u2192 index 1 (odd), i=1 (0-based) \u2192 index 2 (even), i=2 \u2192 index 3 (odd), etc. So in code, when i is even (0-based), the element is in an odd position (1-based). The code's if(i%2 ==0) branch is for elements at 1-based odd indices, else branch for 1-based even indices. So the code splits the array into two groups: the elements at 1-based odd indices (even indices in 0-based terms, since i%2==0) and 1-based even indices (odd in 0-based terms). For each group, we need to check if all elements can have the same parity after any number of operations. Wait, how do the operations affect the parities? Let's think.

So, for group1 (original all even): possible parities are even (0 flips) or odd (1 flip). For group1 (original all odd): possible parities are even (1 flip) or odd (0 flips). Similarly for group2. So, the possible combinations depend on the original parities of the two groups. Suppose group1 is even (original all even) and group2 is odd (original all odd):\n\ngroup1_parity can be even or odd.",

Because even if each group is uniform, but the group's parities cannot be adjusted to the same overall parity. For example:\n\nGroup1 (odd indices) has elements all even. Group2 (even indices) has elements all even. Thus, possible to make all even.\n\nGroup1 is even, group2 is even \u2192 yes. But suppose group1 is even, group2 is odd. Then, x can be 0 (group1 stays even), y can be 1 (group2 becomes even \u2192 all even). Or x=1 (group1 becomes odd), y=0 (group2 remains odd \u2192 all odd). So answer is yes. But how can there be a case where groups are uniform but the answer is NO?\n\nOnly if the two groups have different parities and there's no way to make them same. For example, group1 is even, group2 is even \u2192 answer yes. Group1 is even, group2 is odd \u2192 answer yes. Group1 is odd, group2 is even \u2192 answer yes.",

But in the case where each group is uniform, but their parities are such that no combination of flips can make all elements even or all elements odd, then the answer is NO. But according to previous analysis, this is not possible. Thus, the code's logic is correct. So why is sample 2's answer NO? The code's logic would output YES for sample 2's case. But according to the note, the answer is NO. This suggests that the sample's input is different. Ah, perhaps the sample input for the second test case is not [2,1], but [1, 2]. Wait, let's take [1,2]. Group1 (odd indices, 1-based) \u2192 index 0 in 0-based (element 1) \u2192 odd. So group1 is all odd (even1=0, odd1=1). Group2 (even indices, 1-based) \u2192 index 1 in 0-based (element 2) \u2192 even (even2=1, odd2=0). Thus, code's variables:\n\neven1=0, odd1=1. even2=1, odd2=0. Thus, code will output YES.

But according to the code's logic, it's always YES. But according to the sample note, in some cases, even if groups are uniform, the answer is NO. But this is not possible. Thus, the code's logic is correct, and the sample note must be wrong. But this is unlikely. Alternative approach: perhaps the code's variables are initialized incorrectly. Looking at the code:\n\nint even1 = 0, even2 = 0, odd1 = 0, odd2 = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    int t;\n\n    cin >> t;\n\n    if (i % 2 == 0) {\n\n        if (t % 2 == 1) odd1 = 1;\n\n        else even1 = 1; \n\n    } else {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n} In the else block (i is odd in 0-based terms, which corresponds to even indices in 1-based terms). Thus, the missing code should process the even indices (1-based), setting even2 and odd2 variables. The code for the else block should be:\n\nif (t % 2 == 1) {\n\n    odd2 = 1;\n\n} else {\n\n    even2 = 1;\n\n} This way, if any element in the even indices (1-based) is odd, odd2 is set to 1. If any is even, even2 is set to 1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining if we can make all elements of an array have the same parity (all even or all odd) by performing certain operations. The operations are adding 1 to all elements at odd indices or even indices. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, the indices here are 1-based or 0-based? Because in the code, there's a loop with i starting at 0. The problem statement says \"odd index\" and \"even index\". Let me check the note. For example, the first test case example: the array was [1, 2, 1], and after adding to even indices (like index 2), the array becomes [1,3,1], which are all odd. So the indices are 1-based here. So in the code, when i is 0, that's the first element, which is index 1 (odd). So when i is even (0-based), the actual index is odd (1-based). So for the code, elements at even positions in the array (0-based) are the even indices (1-based). Wait no, because 0-based index 0 is 1-based index 1 (odd). So in the code, for i=0 (0-based), that's 1-based index 1 (odd), so the code's 'even1' and 'odd1' variables are for the odd indices (1-based). Similarly, the else part (i%2 !=0) would be even indices in 1-based terms.\n\nThe variables even1 and odd1 track the parities of elements at the original odd positions (1-based). Even1 is set if there's an even number in an original odd position, odd1 if there's an odd. Similarly, even2 and odd2 should track the parities of elements at original even positions (1-based), which in code are the i%2 !=0 cases (since 0-based even indices are 1-based odd indices). Wait no: For i in 0-based, the 1-based index is i+1. So if i is even (0-based), then the 1-based index is i+1 which could be even or odd. Wait, no. For example, i=0 (0-based) \u2192 index 1 (odd), i=1 (0-based) \u2192 index 2 (even), i=2 \u2192 index 3 (odd), etc. So in code, when i is even (0-based), the element is in an odd position (1-based). The code's if(i%2 ==0) branch is for elements at 1-based odd indices, else branch for 1-based even indices.\n\nSo the code splits the array into two groups: the elements at 1-based odd indices (even indices in 0-based terms, since i%2==0) and 1-based even indices (odd in 0-based terms). For each group, we need to check if all elements can have the same parity after any number of operations.\n\nWait, how do the operations affect the parities? Let's think. Each operation is adding 1 to all elements in either the 1-based odd indices or even indices. Each such operation flips the parity of those elements. Because adding 1 toggles even/odd.\n\nSo, for example, if we perform the odd-index operation once, all elements in the odd indices (1-based) get their parity flipped. Similarly for the even-index operation.\n\nThe key insight here is that for the entire array to have the same parity, two conditions must hold:\n\n1. All elements in the odd positions (1-based) must have the same parity after any number of flips (since each operation on odd indices can flip their parities any number of times).\n2. All elements in the even positions (1-based) must have the same parity after any number of flips.\n3. The parities of the two groups (odd and even positions) must be compatible. For example, they can all be even (so both groups must be even), or all odd (so both groups must be odd). But how can the operations affect this?\n\nWait, because each operation can be applied any number of times. Let's model this.\n\nEach group (odd positions and even positions) can have their parities adjusted independently. For the group of odd positions (1-based), each operation (adding to them) toggles their parity. So, for that group, the possible parity after any number of operations is either the original parity (if even number of operations) or the flipped parity (if odd number of operations). But since we can apply the operation any number of times, the parity of each element in the group can be adjusted. But wait, the group consists of elements that must all be adjusted in the same way. Because each operation on the odd positions affects all elements in that group. So the parity of each element in the group can be adjusted, but all elements in the group must flip together.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the group (odd positions) has elements with parities even and odd. Then, applying the odd operation once would flip all of their parities. But if some elements were even and others odd, after a flip, some would be odd and even again. So to have all elements in the group have the same parity, the initial group must have all elements with the same parity modulo 2. Because each operation toggles the parity of all elements in the group. So, for example, if in the group (odd positions) there are elements with both even and odd parities, then even after any number of operations, there's no way to make them all even or all odd, because each flip toggles all elements, but if the group already has elements of mixed parity, flipping them all would result in another mixed parity. For example, if a group has elements even and odd, flipping once would make them all odd and even again. So, the group must have all elements with the same parity, otherwise it's impossible.\n\nWait, that's the key. So, for the groups (odd positions and even positions), each group must consist of elements with the same parity (mod 2). Because otherwise, flipping their parities via operations won't make them all the same. Because the operations flip all elements in the group. So for example, if a group has both even and odd elements, then flipping them once would make them odd and even. So, the group's elements would still be a mix. Hence, for the entire array to have the same parity, each group (odd and even positions) must be uniform in their parity. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think again. Let's say for the odd positions group, there are elements with different parities. Then, no matter how many times we apply the operation (adding 1 to them), the entire group's parities would toggle each time, but the group would still have a mix. For example, initial elements: 2 (even) and 3 (odd). Apply operation once: 3 (odd) and 4 (even) \u2192 mixed. Apply again: 4 (even) and 5 (odd) \u2192 mixed. So no way to make them all same. So, the group must have all even or all odd elements. Then, applying operations can flip their parity (as a group) any number of times, but they'll all be same.\n\nTherefore, the code checks two things: for each group (odd and even positions), all elements in the group must have the same parity. Because only then can you flip the group's parity as needed to make both groups' parities match (either both even or both odd).\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\n- For the group in odd positions (1-based, i.e., i%2 ==0 in 0-based terms), check if all elements are even or all are odd. Similarly for the even positions group.\n\nIn the code, variables even1 and odd1 track if there are any even or odd elements in the odd positions group. Similarly even2 and odd2 for the even positions group. For example, if even1 is 1, it means there's at least one even element in the odd positions group. If both even1 and odd1 are 1, that means the group has elements of both parities \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo in the code, after processing all elements, if either group has both even and odd elements (even1 && odd1, or even2 && odd2), then the answer is NO. Otherwise, it's possible to adjust the parities of the two groups (by flipping them as needed) to have the same overall parity.\n\nSo for example, if the odd group is all even and the even group is all even \u2192 possible. Or odd group all even, even group all odd \u2192 then applying the even group's operation once (flipping their parity) makes them even. Then all elements are even.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose the odd group is all even, even group is all odd. Then:\n\n- The odd group can have their parity as even (since applying 0 operations).\n\n- The even group can have their parity as even by applying one operation (flipping their parity from odd to even).\n\nSo the total would be all even.\n\nAlternatively, the odd group can be flipped once (to become odd), and the even group flipped once (to become even). Then the groups would be odd and even \u2192 no. So that's why the code checks that both groups can be made to have the same parity.\n\nWait, but in the code, after ensuring that each group is uniform (either even or odd), we need to check whether the two groups can be adjusted to have the same parity.\n\nBecause each group can be either their original parity or flipped (since applying an odd number of flips changes their parity). For example, group1 (odd positions) is all even. So they can stay even (0 flips) or become odd (1 flip). Similarly, group2 (even positions) is all odd. They can stay odd (0 flips) or become even (1 flip). So possible combinations:\n\nGroup1: even, group2: even \u2192 possible (group2 flipped once).\n\nGroup1: even, group2: odd \u2192 possible only if group1 can be adjusted to be odd and group2 adjusted to be even.\n\nWait no. Wait, after group1 is even, group2 is odd. Then, we need to choose a number of flips for group1 and group2 such that group1's parity and group2's parity are the same. So group1 can be even (0 flips) or odd (1 flip). group2 can be odd (0 flips) or even (1 flip). So possible combinations:\n\neven (group1) and even (group2 with 1 flip \u2192 even).\n\nOR\n\nodd (group1 with 1 flip) and odd (group2 with 0 flips).\n\nSo in this case, it's possible.\n\nBut if group1 is even (so possible to be even or odd), and group2 is even (so possible even or odd). Then there must be a way to choose their parity such that both are even or both are odd.\n\nWait, for example, group1 is all even (so can be even or odd), group2 is all even (so even or odd). Then possible combinations:\n\neven + even \u2192 yes.\n\neven + odd \u2192 group1 even, group2 odd: not same.\n\nodd + even \u2192 no.\n\nodd + odd \u2192 yes.\n\nSo as long as group1 and group2 can be adjusted to have the same parity, even if their original parities are different, it's possible.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's take an example.\n\nTest case 4 from the problem statement:\n\nSample input 4:\n\n5\n\n1000 1 1000 1 1000\n\nOriginal array is [1000,1,1000,1,1000]. The 1-based indices are:\n\n1 (odd) \u2192 1000 (even)\n\n2 (even) \u2192 1 (odd)\n\n3 (odd) \u21921000 (even)\n\n4 (even) \u21921 (odd)\n\n5 (odd) \u21921000 (even)\n\nSo group1 (odd indices in 1-based terms) are indices 1,3,5. Their elements are all even (1000, 1000, 1000). So group1 is all even \u2192 even1=1, odd1=0.\n\nGroup2 (even indices in 1-based terms) are indices 2,4. Elements are 1 and 1 (both odd). So group2 has even2=0, odd2=1.\n\nSo the code will check if (even1 and odd1) \u2192 1 and 0 \u2192 no. Then check if (even2 and odd2) \u2192 0 and 1 \u2192 no. So proceed to else.\n\nNow, group1 is even (so can be even or odd via flips), group2 is odd (can be odd or even via flips). Are there combinations where group1 and group2 are the same? Yes. For example, group1 is even (0 flips), group2 is even (1 flip). So overall even. Or group1 is odd (1 flip), group2 is odd (0 flips). So overall odd.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n\nSo the code correctly returns YES.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nIf either group (odd positions or even positions) has elements of mixed parities (even and odd), then it's impossible. Otherwise, since each group can be toggled any number of times (so their parity can be even or odd), we need to check whether there exists a parity combination of the two groups that is the same. Which is possible as long as the two groups can have the same parity after some flips.\n\nWait, but the code as written in the problem doesn't check this. It only checks that each group is not mixed, and if so, outputs YES. Wait, the code in the problem is:\n\nif (even1 && odd1) \u2192 output NO.\n\nelse if (even2 && odd2) \u2192 output NO.\n\nelse \u2192 YES.\n\nBut that's not sufficient. Because even if each group is uniform, the two groups' parities may be such that they cannot be made the same. For example, group1 is even and group2 is even: yes. group1 is even and group2 is odd: can we make them same?\n\nYes. Because group1 can be flipped to odd (once), group2 can be flipped once to even. So their parities would be odd and even \u2192 not same. Wait no, wait. Let's see:\n\nWait, group1's parity can be even (0 flips) or odd (1 flip). Group2's parity can be even (0 flips if original is even, or 1 flip if original is odd). Wait, group2's original parity is even or odd?\n\nWait, the code's variables even1 and odd1 are set based on the initial parities. For group1 (odd indices in 1-based terms), even1 is 1 if there's any even element in that group. odd1 is 1 if there's any odd element. But the code's initial processing checks for group1: if even1 and odd1 are both 1, then the group is mixed. Else, the group is uniform.\n\nSo, after processing, if even1 and odd1 are not both 1, then the group is uniform. So group1 is either all even (even1=1, odd1=0) or all odd (even1=0, odd1=1).\n\nSimilarly for group2.\n\nSo the code's logic is that if either group is mixed, output NO. Otherwise, output YES.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Suppose group1 is all even (so even1=1, odd1=0) and group2 is all even (even2=1, odd2=0). Then output is YES. Which is correct. If group1 is all even and group2 all odd (even1=1, even2=0, odd2=1), then:\n\nWe can choose to flip group1 once (now odd) and group2 once (now even) \u2192 groups are odd and even \u2192 no. Or flip group1 once (odd) and group2 0 times (odd) \u2192 group1 is odd, group2 is odd \u2192 yes. So in this case, it's possible to make both groups odd.\n\nWait, how?\n\nWait group1 is all even (original). So after 1 flip (add 1 to odd positions once), group1's elements are all odd. Group2 is all odd (original). So after 0 flips, they are odd. So all elements (group1 is odd, group2 is odd) \u2192 same parity. So possible.\n\nSo in this case, even if group1 and group2 are originally even and odd, respectively, they can be adjusted to have the same parity.\n\nSo the code's current logic (output YES as long as each group is uniform) is correct.\n\nBecause when each group is uniform, their parities can be adjusted (by flipping any number of times) to either even or odd. Then, as long as there's a combination where the two groups' adjusted parities are the same, it's possible.\n\nBut how can you ensure that such a combination exists?\n\nBecause group1 can be even or odd (depending on the number of flips), group2 can be even or odd. So possible combinations are:\n\ngroup1_parity and group2_parity:\n\n- even, even \u2192 yes.\n\n- even, odd \u2192 no.\n\n- odd, even \u2192 no.\n\n- odd, odd \u2192 yes.\n\nBut group1_parity and group2_parity can be chosen to be even/even or odd/odd as long as the original groups' parities allow it.\n\nWait, group1's original parity (all even or all odd) can be adjusted to even or odd via even or odd number of flips.\n\nSo, for group1 (original all even): possible parities are even (0 flips) or odd (1 flip).\n\nFor group1 (original all odd): possible parities are even (1 flip) or odd (0 flips).\n\nSimilarly for group2.\n\nSo, the possible combinations depend on the original parities of the two groups.\n\nSuppose group1 is even (original all even) and group2 is odd (original all odd):\n\ngroup1_parity can be even or odd.\n\ngroup2_parity can be odd or even.\n\nSo possible combinations:\n\neven and odd \u2192 no.\n\neven and even \u2192 group1 even (0 flips), group2 even (1 flip). So possible.\n\nodd and odd \u2192 group1 odd (1 flip), group2 odd (0 flips). So possible.\n\nodd and even \u2192 no.\n\nSo in this case, it's possible to make them even/even or odd/odd \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother example: group1 is even, group2 is even.\n\nThen, possible combinations even/even (0/0 flips), even/even (1/1 flips). So yes.\n\nAnother example: group1 is even (original even), group2 is even (original even). Yes.\n\nAnother example: group1 is even (original even), group2 is even (original even). So yes.\n\nSo the conclusion is that as long as each group is uniform (no mixed parities), then it's possible to adjust the flips so that the two groups have the same parity. Because group1 can be adjusted to even or odd, group2 same. So there must be a way to choose their parities to be the same.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's take group1 is even and group2 is even \u2192 yes.\n\nGroup1 even, group2 even \u2192 same parity.\n\nGroup1 even, group2 even (original even). Yes.\n\nGroup1 even (original even), group2 odd (original odd):\n\ngroup1 can be even (0) or odd (1).\n\ngroup2 can be odd (0) or even (1).\n\nSo possible combinations: even/odd \u2192 no. odd/even \u2192 no. even/even \u2192 yes (group1 0, group2 1). Or odd/odd \u2192 yes (group1 1, group2 0).\n\nSo regardless of the original parities of the groups (as long as they are uniform), there exists a way to have the two groups have the same parity.\n\nThus, the code's current logic is correct: if both groups are uniform, output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nTherefore, the code correctly checks if each group is uniform (even1 and odd1 can't both be 1, same for even2 and odd2). If either group is mixed, output NO. Else, YES.\n\nNow, looking at the code provided in the problem. The code initializes even1, odd1, even2, odd2 as 0. Then, for each element in the array:\n\nif i%2 ==0 (0-based, which is 1-based odd indices):\n\ncheck if t is even or odd. If it's even, set even1=1. If odd, set odd1=1.\n\nElse (i%2 !=0 \u2192 1-based even indices):\n\nneed to do the same for even2 and odd2. So in the else block, for each element in the even positions (1-based), check if the element is even or odd, and set even2 or odd2 accordingly.\n\nSo in the code, the missing part is the else block. For the current element (i is odd in 0-based \u2192 1-based even index), we need to check if it's even or odd, and set even2 or odd2.\n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nif (t % 2 == 1) odd2 = 1;\nelse even2 = 1;\n\nSo, in the else clause, for each element, check its parity. If odd, set odd2 to 1. Else, even2 to 1. Because if any element in the even positions (1-based) is odd, then the group has at least one odd element, so odd2 is set. Similarly for even.\n\nOnce all elements are processed, the code checks if even1 and odd1 are both 1 (meaning group1 has mixed parities), or even2 and odd2 are both 1 (group2 is mixed). If either is true, output NO. Else, YES.\n\nThus, the missing code is inside the else block (for even indices in 1-based terms), which is handled by the else clause when i is odd in 0-based terms.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif(t % 2 == 1) odd2 = 1;\nelse even2 = 1;\n\nThat's the code to be filled in the else part.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3\n\n1 2 1\n\nn=3, elements at 0-based indices 0,1,2. \n\nFor i=0 (even \u2192 1-based odd index):\n\nelements are 1 (odd \u2192 odd1=1), 2 (even \u2192 even1=1?), wait wait:\n\nWait, for the first test case, the array is [1,2,1]. So elements at 0-based index 0 (1-based 1, odd) is 1 (odd \u2192 odd1 is set to 1). Index 1 (even in 1-based) is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 even2 is set to 1. Index 2 (0-based even \u2192 1-based 3, odd) is 1 \u2192 odd1 is set to 1 again. \n\nSo after processing, group1 (odd indices) has elements 1,1. So even1=0, odd1=1 (since all elements are odd). Group2 (even indices) has element 2 \u2192 even2=1, odd2=0. So even1 and odd1 are not both 1 (only odd1=1). even2 and odd2 are not both 1 (even2=1). So code outputs YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: test case 2:\n\nn=2\n\nelements 1 1.\n\nGroup1 (0-based even indices \u2192 index 0, which is 1-based 1, odd) \u2192 element 1 (odd \u2192 odd1=1). Group2 (0-based odd index \u2192 1-based 2, even) \u2192 element 1 \u2192 odd. So even2 is 0, odd2=1.\n\nSo code checks: group1 is uniform (all odd), group2 is uniform (all odd). So code outputs YES, but according to the sample, the answer is NO. Wait wait, no. Wait sample 2 is:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\nWait no, let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait the note says: For the second test case, the answer is NO.\n\nWait the second test case's input is:\n\n2\n\n2 1.\n\nSo array is [2,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0 (0-based even \u2192 1-based 1, odd) \u2192 element is 2 (even \u2192 even1=1).\n\ni=1 (0-based odd \u2192 1-based 2, even) \u2192 element is 1 (odd \u2192 odd2=1).\n\nSo group1 is even (even1=1, odd1=0), group2 is odd (even2=0, odd2=1). So the code will output YES. But according to the sample, the answer is NO.\n\nWait wait this is a problem. Because according to the code, the answer for sample 2 would be YES, but according to the note, the answer is NO.\n\nThis indicates that the code is incorrect. But this contradicts our earlier analysis.\n\nWait this means there's a mistake in the code's logic.\n\nWait let's re-examine the sample 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, elements are 2 and 1.\n\nGroup1 (1-based odd indices) \u2192 elements 2 (even). Group2 (1-based even indices) \u2192 element 1 (odd).\n\nSo group1 is all even, group2 is all odd.\n\nAccording to the code, since both groups are uniform, output YES.\n\nBut according to the sample, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect. But why?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code's logic is incomplete. Even if each group is uniform, the code assumes that they can be adjusted to the same parity. But in some cases, this is not possible.\n\nWait, in sample 2: group1 is even, group2 is odd.\n\nWe can perform operations to adjust their parities.\n\nGroup1 can be even (0 flips) or odd (1 flip).\n\nGroup2 can be odd (0 flips) or even (1 flip).\n\nPossible combinations:\n\neven (group1) and odd (group2) \u2192 no.\n\neven (group1) and even (group2) \u2192 group1 even (0), group2 even (1 flip) \u2192 yes.\n\nBut group2's original is odd, so flipping once (even) \u2192 group2 becomes even.\n\nSo group1 is even (0 flips), group2 even (1 flip). All elements even. So answer should be YES.\n\nBut according to the sample, the answer is NO. What's wrong here?\n\nWait no. Wait the sample's note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity.\"\n\nBut according to the code's logic, the answer should be YES. But according to the problem statement's note, sample 2's answer is NO. So this indicates that the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nHmm. What's the actual correct approach here?\n\nWait, let's re-analyze sample 2:\n\nSample 2's input:\n\nn=2\n\narray is [2, 1].\n\nSo the elements are at positions 1 (odd) and 2 (even).\n\nGroup1 (position 1) is 2 \u2192 even.\n\nGroup2 (position 2) is 1 \u2192 odd.\n\nSo group1 can be even or odd (by flipping once), group2 can be odd or even.\n\nSo possible combinations:\n\ngroup1 even (0 flips), group2 even (1 flip) \u2192 [2+0=2, 1+1=2 \u2192 even and even \u2192 all even. Yes. So why does the sample say NO?\n\nWait this contradicts the sample's note. But according to the note, sample 2's answer is NO. But according to this analysis, it's possible. But that's not the case. Let's see.\n\nWait let's think about what the operations actually do.\n\nIn the first operation type (add 1 to all odd indices), for the array [2,1], adding 1 to the odd indices (position 1) would make it [3, 1]. Then, the elements are 3 (odd) and 1 (odd). All odd \u2192 answer is YES. Wait wait, this is possible.\n\nBut according to the sample's note, the answer is NO. So there's a problem here.\n\nWait the sample note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity.\"\n\nBut according to the example I just did, adding one operation of type 1 (add to odd indices), the array becomes [3,1], which are all odd. So the answer should be YES. But according to the note, sample 2's answer is NO.\n\nWait this indicates that there's a misunderstanding of the problem statement.\n\nWait wait, let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nThe two types of operations are:\n\nAdd 1 to every element with an odd index (1-based).\n\nAdd 1 to every element with an even index (1-based).\n\nSo for sample 2:\n\nInitial array is [2,1]. \n\nPossible operations:\n\nOption 1: perform the odd-index operation once. Then elements at 1-based odd indices (position 1) are incremented by 1. So the array becomes [3,1]. All elements are odd. So answer is YES. But according to the note, sample 2's answer is NO. So this suggests that the sample note is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample note for the second test case says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". \"\n\nBut according to this example, it's possible. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh, wait maybe the sample input is different. Let me check the note again.\n\nWait the note for the second test case says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is not 2 and [2,1], but another input.\n\nWait the problem description's note lists four test cases. Let me check them:\n\nFirst test case: array [1,2,1], after adding to even indices (positions 2 in 1-based) becomes [1,3,1], all odd.\n\nSecond test case: answer is NO.\n\nThird test case: array already has same parity.\n\nFourth test case: array [1000,1,1000,1,1000], after adding to odd indices once becomes all odd.\n\nSo perhaps the sample input for the second test case is different.\n\nAh, perhaps the second test case is:\n\nn=2\n\narray [2,2].\n\nWait no. Let me recheck the problem statement's note:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\nSo what is the input for the second test case?\n\nThe sample input is likely:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=2\n\nelements 1 and 2.\n\nWait in that case, group1 (position 1) is 1 (odd), group2 (position 2) is 2 (even).\n\nSo group1 is all odd, group2 all even. So according to the code, they are both uniform groups. So code outputs YES, but according to the note, the answer is NO.\n\nBut in that case, it is possible to make all elements even or all odd. For example:\n\nPerform even operation once (add 1 to even positions). Then the array becomes [1,3]. Both are odd \u2192 answer is YES.\n\nSo this contradicts the note.\n\nHmm. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect and there's a flaw in the logic.\n\nSo perhaps the code's logic is wrong, and the actual condition is more complex.\n\nSo why is the sample 2's answer NO?\n\nLet me think of the correct approach.\n\nThe problem is to determine if after any number of operations (possibly zero), the array can have all elements with the same parity.\n\nEach operation adds 1 to all elements in either even or odd indices (1-based).\n\nThe key is that each operation affects multiple elements. So, the parity of each element depends on the number of times its index group was flipped (mod 2).\n\nFor each element a_i in group G (even or odd indices), the final parity is: original_parity XOR (number of flips for group G) mod 2.\n\nTo have all elements with the same parity, there must exist two variables x and y (0 or 1) such that:\n\nFor every element in group G:\n\n(original_parity + x) mod 2 = target_parity (if G is odd indices, x is the number of flips for odd group mod 2).\n\nSimilarly, for group even indices: (original_parity + y) mod 2 = target_parity.\n\nSo, target_parity must be the same for all elements.\n\nThus, for the entire array to have the same parity (say, even):\n\nFor each element in group odd: (original_parity + x) mod 2 = 0.\n\nFor each element in group even: (original_parity + y) mod 2 = 0.\n\nSimilarly for odd parity.\n\nBut x and y are the number of flips mod 2 for the two groups.\n\nThus, for the array to be all even, all elements in group odd must have original_parity +x \u2261 0 mod 2. Similarly for group even.\n\nBut since all elements in group odd are the same parity (as per the code's check), then x can be chosen as (original_parity of group odd) mod 2. For example, if group odd is all even, x must be 0. If group odd is all odd, x must be 1.\n\nSimilarly for group even and y.\n\nThus, the target_parity for group odd is even (when x is 0) if group odd is even. Or even when x is 1 and group odd is odd.\n\nSo, to make all elements even, x must be 0 for even group odd, 1 for odd group odd. Similarly for group even.\n\nBut then, the target_parity for even and odd groups must be the same. So, whether the sum of x and group odd's parity is even, and sum of y and group even's parity is even.\n\nBut x and y can be chosen independently. So, for example:\n\nIf group odd is even (x can be 0 or 1, but x must be 0 to make group odd even), group even is even (y can be 0 or 1, but y must be 0 to make group even even). Then target_parity is even.\n\nAlternatively, group odd can be even (x=0) and group even even (y=0 \u2192 target even). Or group odd even (x=0) and group even even (y=1 \u2192 target odd). But in that case, the target_parities would differ.\n\nWait, no. The target_parity must be the same for all elements. So, for example, x and y must be chosen such that:\n\nFor group odd: (original_parity + x) mod 2 = target.\n\nFor group even: (original_parity + y) mod 2 = target.\n\nSo, target must be the same for both groups.\n\nSo, there must exist a target parity (even or odd), and x and y (0 or 1) such that:\n\nFor all elements in group odd: (original_parity +x) mod 2 == target.\n\nFor all elements in group even: (original_parity +y) mod 2 == target.\n\nSince group odd and group even are uniform (as per the code's check), then:\n\nFor group odd: original_parity is the same for all elements. Let's call it P_odd (0 for even, 1 for odd).\n\nFor group even: original_parity is P_even (0 or 1).\n\nWe need to find x and y in {0,1} such that:\n\n(P_odd + x) mod 2 == target.\n\n(P_even + y) mod 2 == target.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\ntarget = (P_odd + x) mod 2.\n\ntarget = (P_even + y) mod 2.\n\nSo, we need:\n\n(P_odd + x) mod 2 = (P_even + y) mod 2.\n\nBut x and y are variables. We can choose x and y to satisfy this equation.\n\nFor example, for group odd P_odd = 0 (even), group even P_even = 1 (odd).\n\nThen, we can choose x=0, y=1:\n\ntarget = (0+0) mod 2 = 0.\n\ntarget must also be (1 +1) mod 2 = 0. So it works. So target is even.\n\nThus, the array can be made all even.\n\nWhich matches the sample test case 2's example I considered earlier. But according to the note, the answer is NO. So there's a contradiction.\n\nHmm. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample note, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the sample note is wrong. Or perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a case where even if both groups are uniform, there's no way to choose x and y to make their target parities the same.\n\nFor example, group odd is even (P_odd=0), group even is even (P_even=0). Then, possible target parities:\n\nIf x=0, target is 0. Then y must be 0 (since 0 + y must be 0 \u2192 y=0). So target 0 \u2192 possible.\n\nIf x=1, target is 1. Then y must be 1. So target 1 \u2192 possible.\n\nThus, possible.\n\nAnother example: group odd is even (0), group even is even (0). So all even. Answer YES.\n\nAnother example: group odd is even (0), group even is odd (1). Possible target parity:\n\nChoose x=0 and y=1 \u2192 target 0 (0+0=0, 1+1=2 mod 2=0). So target even.\n\nOR x=1 and y=0 \u2192 target (0+1=1, 1+0=1). Target odd.\n\nThus, answer is YES.\n\nSo why would sample 2's answer be NO?\n\nPerhaps the sample 2's input is different. Let me recheck.\n\nThe note says: For the second test case, the answer is NO. The input may be:\n\nn=2\n\narray [1, 2].\n\nGroup1 (odd indices 1-based) is [1] \u2192 odd (P_odd=1). Group2 (even indices) [2] \u2192 even (P_even=0).\n\nPossible x and y:\n\ntarget must be same for both.\n\nPossible x can be 0 or 1 (for group odd). Possible y can be 0 or 1 (for group even).\n\nFor target even:\n\n(P_odd +x) mod 2 = even \u2192 (1 +x) mod 2 =0 \u2192 x=1.\n\n(P_even +y) mod2=0 \u2192 (0+y) mod2=0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nThus, target even requires x=1, y=0. Which is possible. The array would be:\n\nGroup odd (after x=1 flips \u2192 adding once to odd indices): 1+1=2 (even).\n\nGroup even (y=0 flips \u2192 remains 2 (even).\n\nSo all even. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother possibility: target odd.\n\nx=0 \u2192 group odd: 1+0=1 (odd).\n\ny=1 \u2192 group even: 0+1=1 (odd).\n\nSo array elements [1, 2+1=3] \u2192 [1,3] all odd.\n\nThus, answer is YES.\n\nBut according to the note, the answer is NO.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample note. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that after any number of operations, all elements are even or all are odd. But the code's approach allows for some combinations where it's possible.\n\nBut in all cases where the groups are uniform, it's possible to choose x and y such that the target parities are the same.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. The sample note must have a mistake.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, sample 2's answer is NO. So there must be a scenario where the groups are uniform but the answer is NO.\n\nBut according to the analysis, this is impossible.\n\nThus, there must be a mistake in the code's logic.\n\nHmm. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect. Because even if each group is uniform, but the group's parities cannot be adjusted to the same overall parity.\n\nFor example:\n\nGroup1 (odd indices) has elements all even.\n\nGroup2 (even indices) has elements all even.\n\nThus, possible to make all even.\n\nGroup1 is even, group2 is even \u2192 yes.\n\nBut suppose group1 is even, group2 is odd.\n\nThen, x can be 0 (group1 stays even), y can be 1 (group2 becomes even \u2192 all even). Or x=1 (group1 becomes odd), y=0 (group2 remains odd \u2192 all odd). So answer is yes.\n\nBut how can there be a case where groups are uniform but the answer is NO?\n\nOnly if the two groups have different parities and there's no way to make them same.\n\nFor example, group1 is even, group2 is even \u2192 answer yes.\n\nGroup1 is even, group2 is odd \u2192 answer yes.\n\nGroup1 is odd, group2 is even \u2192 answer yes.\n\nGroup1 is odd, group2 is odd \u2192 answer yes.\n\nSo in all cases, as long as each group is uniform, the answer is YES.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample note, there's a case where groups are uniform but the answer is NO.\n\nThis suggests that the sample's note is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the array to have even and odd elements after operations, but all elements must have the same parity. For example, if group1 is even and group2 is even, but one group is even and the other is even after flips \u2192 all even.\n\nBut according to the analysis, that's possible.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. So why the sample 2's answer is NO?\n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. But why?\n\nPerhaps the code's logic is missing some condition.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the code is only checking if each group is uniform, but not considering that the combination of their parities must allow for a common target parity.\n\nWait, but according to the analysis, this is always possible. So perhaps the code's logic is correct.\n\nBut then why in the sample 2's case (groups are even and even) the code would output YES.\n\nBut the sample note says the answer is NO.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample note.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is wrong. Maybe there's another condition that must be checked.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem requires that after any number of operations, all elements have the same parity. So, the code's approach is to check that each group is uniform, because if any group has mixed parities, then it's impossible.\n\nBut in the case where each group is uniform, but their parities are such that no combination of flips can make all elements even or all elements odd, then the answer is NO. But according to previous analysis, this is not possible.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo why is sample 2's answer NO?\n\nThe code's logic would output YES for sample 2's case.\n\nBut according to the note, the answer is NO.\n\nThis suggests that the sample's input is different.\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input for the second test case is not [2,1], but [1, 2].\n\nWait, let's take [1,2].\n\nGroup1 (odd indices, 1-based) \u2192 index 0 in 0-based (element 1) \u2192 odd. So group1 is all odd (even1=0, odd1=1).\n\nGroup2 (even indices, 1-based) \u2192 index 1 in 0-based (element 2) \u2192 even (even2=1, odd2=0).\n\nThus, code's variables:\n\neven1=0, odd1=1.\n\neven2=1, odd2=0.\n\nThus, code will output YES. But according to the note, the answer is NO.\n\nBut according to analysis, it's possible to make all even or all odd.\n\nFor example:\n\nPerform even operation once (add 1 to even indices \u2192 group2's elements become 3 (odd)).\n\nThen, array is [1,3]. All odd.\n\nSo answer is YES.\n\nThus, the code is correct and the sample note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the code's logic. For example, the code's variables even1 and odd1 are set based on the current element's parity, but the code doesn't check whether all elements in the group have the same parity. It just sets even1 to 1 if any element in the group is even, and odd1 to 1 if any is odd. So if the group has multiple elements with different parities, even1 and odd1 will both be 1, leading to output NO.\n\nBut for a group with all elements even, even1 will be 1, odd1 0. If group has all elements odd, even1 0, odd1 1.\n\nBut in the case of group1 being a mix, even1 and odd1 are both 1 \u2192 output NO.\n\nThus, the code correctly checks if each group is uniform.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, sample 2's answer is NO. So there must be a case where groups are uniform, but the answer is NO.\n\nBut according to the analysis, this is not possible. So the code must be correct, and the sample note is wrong.\n\nBut this is unlikely.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the code's variables even1 and odd1 are set incorrectly.\n\nWait, for example, in the code:\n\nfor each element in group1 (i%2 ==0):\n\nif t is odd \u2192 odd1=1.\n\nelse \u2192 even1=1.\n\nThus, even if all elements in group1 are even, even1 will be 1. But if any element in group1 is odd, even1 is not set, but odd1 is set.\n\nWait, no. For each element in group1, the code checks if it's even or odd. So for example, if group1 has elements [2,4,6], all even. Then, even1 will be set to 1 for each element. But since even1 is initially 0, after the first element (even), even1 becomes 1. For the next elements (even), even1 remains 1. So even1 is 1, odd1 is 0. Which correctly represents that all elements in group1 are even.\n\nSimilarly, if group1 has elements [1,3,5], odd1 is set to 1 for each element. So even1 is 0, odd1 is 1.\n\nBut if group1 has elements [2,3], then even1 is set to 1 (for element 2), odd1 is set to 1 (for element 3). So even1 and odd1 are both 1 \u2192 group is mixed.\n\nThus, the code's logic for setting even1 and odd1 is correct.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct, and the sample note must have a mistake.\n\nBut this is not possible. The problem statement's sample note must be correct.\n\nThus, there must be a flaw in the code's logic.\n\nAh! Oh, wait! Perhaps the code is allowing for the possibility of flipping groups multiple times, but each flip affects all elements in the group. So, when you apply an operation to group1 (odd indices), all elements in that group are flipped. Thus, if group1 is all even, flipping once (adding 1) makes them all odd. Flipping again makes them even again. So the parity of group1 can be even (even number of flips) or odd (odd number of flips).\n\nSimilarly for group2.\n\nBut to get all elements to have the same parity, the parities of group1 and group2 after flips must be the same.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct: as long as each group is uniform, you can choose the number of flips for each group to make their parities match.\n\nBut in some cases, this is not possible.\n\nWait no. For example, group1 is even, group2 is even. Then, possible flips: group1 even, group2 even \u2192 all even. Or group1 even (0 flips), group2 even (0 flips) \u2192 yes.\n\nSo why would it ever be impossible when groups are uniform?\n\nAh! I think I see the mistake.\n\nThe code's logic assumes that if each group is uniform, then there exists a way to choose x and y (flips for each group) such that their parities are the same. But this is only possible if the original parities of the two groups can be adjusted to the same parity via flips.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf group1 is even and group2 is even \u2192 can be made even.\n\nIf group1 is even and group2 is odd \u2192 can be made even by flipping group2 once.\n\n group1 even, group2 becomes even.\n\nOr group1 flipped once (becomes odd), group2 flipped once (becomes even \u2192 no).\n\nWait, no:\n\nGroup1 even (0 flips), group2 even (1 flip \u2192 becomes even+1 flip (odd group2's original is even, adding once makes them odd \u2192 no, wait group2's original is even \u2192 adding once makes them odd.\n\nWait group2 is even (original even), so flipping once makes them odd. So group1 is even, group2 is odd. So after one even flip (group2), group2's elements are odd.\n\nBut group1 is even (0 flips), group2 is odd (1 flip \u2192 even+1 becomes odd). So parities are even and odd \u2192 not same. So this is not allowed.\n\nThus, to make them same:\n\nGroup1 even (0 flips) \u2192 even.\n\nGroup2 even (0 flips) \u2192 even.\n\nOr group1 even (0), group2 even (0). So yes.\n\nBut group2's original is even \u2192 no flips needed.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. But perhaps there's a case where the two groups' original parities are such that they cannot be adjusted to the same parity.\n\nBut according to previous analysis, this is possible.\n\nFor example, group1 is even, group2 is even \u2192 yes.\n\n group1 is even, group2 is odd \u2192 yes.\n\n group1 is odd, group2 is even \u2192 yes.\n\n group1 is odd, group2 is odd \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo why the sample note says that the answer is NO for the second test case? This suggests that the sample's input has groups with mixed parities.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, if the sample's input has groups with mixed parities, the code outputs NO.\n\nAh! The sample input for the second test case must have groups with mixed parities.\n\nLet me re-read the problem's note.\n\nNote: For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity.\n\nSo what is the input for this test case?\n\nAssume the input is:\n\nn=2\n\nelements [1, 1].\n\nThen, group1 (position 1) is 1 (odd), group2 (position 2) is 1 (odd). Both groups are uniform. So code outputs YES. But according to the note, the answer is NO. So this can't be.\n\nAnother possibility: the input is [1,2,3,4], n=4.\n\nGroup1 (positions 1,3): elements 1 and 3 (all odd). Group2 (positions 2,4): 2 and4 (all even). Code outputs YES.\n\nBut according to the note, this would have answer YES.\n\nThus, the only way for the code to output NO is if one of the groups is mixed.\n\nThus, the sample input for the second test case must have a group with mixed parities.\n\nFor example, n=2, elements [1,2].\n\nGroup1 (position 1): 1 (odd).\n\nGroup2 (position 2): 2 (even).\n\nSo groups are uniform. Code outputs YES. But according to the note, answer is NO. Contradiction.\n\nThus, the only possibility is that the code's logic is wrong.\n\nBut why?\n\nAh! Oh, I see now. The code's logic is incorrect because it allows for each group to be uniform, but the parity of the two groups after flips must be the same.\n\nBut the code does not check whether there exists a common parity between the two groups.\n\nFor example, group1 is all even (possible parities even or odd), group2 is all odd (possible parities odd or even).\n\nThe code outputs YES, but there exists a combination where they can be made the same.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, it's sufficient that the groups are uniform, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, no. As per the previous analysis, even if group1 and group2 are uniform, but their original parities are even and odd, it's possible to flip them to the same parity.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, it's always YES.\n\nBut according to the sample note, in some cases, even if groups are uniform, the answer is NO.\n\nBut this is not possible.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct, and the sample note must be wrong.\n\nBut this is unlikely.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the code's variables are initialized incorrectly.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nint even1 = 0, even2 = 0, odd1 = 0, odd2 = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    int t;\n\n    cin >> t;\n\n    if (i % 2 == 0) {\n\n        if (t % 2 == 1) odd1 = 1;\n\n        else even1 = 1; \n\n    } else {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIn the else block (i is odd in 0-based terms, which corresponds to even indices in 1-based terms).\n\nThus, the missing code should process the even indices (1-based), setting even2 and odd2 variables.\n\nThe code for the else block should be:\n\nif (t % 2 == 1) {\n\n    odd2 = 1;\n\n} else {\n\n    even2 = 1;\n\n}\n\nThis way, if any element in the even indices (1-based) is odd, odd2 is set to 1. If any is even, even2 is set to 1.\n\nThus, after processing all elements, if even1 and odd1 are both 1, then group1 has mixed parities. Similarly for even2 and odd2.\n\nThus, the code correctly checks if any group is mixed.\n\nBut in the sample test case where groups are uniform, the code outputs YES.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is the else block setting even2 and odd2 based on the parity of the current element.\n\nSo the code to fill in is:\n\nif(t % 2 == 1) odd2 = 1;\nelse even2 = 1;"
