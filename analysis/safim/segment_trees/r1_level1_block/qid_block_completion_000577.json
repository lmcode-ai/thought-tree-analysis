The allowed operations are swapping \"ab\" to \"ba\" or \"bc\" to \"cb\". Hmm, so these operations let certain characters move past others. Let me think about the possible transformations. First, let's understand the operations. Swapping \"ab\" to \"ba\" allows 'a's and 'b's to switch places, but only if the 'a' is before the 'b'. Similarly, swapping \"bc\" allows 'b's and 'c's to switch. But wait, what's the effect of these operations? For example, 'a's can move past 'b's to the right, but not the other way around?

Let's think for each position i in s and t:\n\n   For each i, compare s[i] and t[i]. If they are the same, proceed. If not:\n\n   Suppose in s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b'. Then, perhaps we can swap this 'a' with the next 'b' in s. But how? Alternatively, perhaps the key is to look for the positions where s and t differ and see if a swap is possible. The code given in the problem has a loop over each i, and when s[i] != t[i] and i is not the last index, then there's some code to process. So the code's approach may be to look for a position where a swap can be done to make s[i] equal to t[i]. So perhaps in the code, when s[i] is not equal to t[i], the code will check if a swap can be done at positions i and i+1. For example:\n\n   Suppose s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b'.",

So perhaps the correct code to fill in is to check if the current character can be swapped with the next character to match t[i], and perform that swap. For example, if s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b', then check if s[i+1] is 'b' and swap them, making s[i] = 'b' and s[i+1] = 'a'. Then, after this swap, the next characters may need to be processed. Similarly, if s[i] is 'b' and t[i] is 'c', check if s[i+1] is 'c' and swap. So the code in the loop would be:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   }\n\n   else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   }\n\n   else {\n\n       break; // can't fix, so exit loop\n\n   } But wait, the code is inside a for loop over i from 0 to n-1. So after swapping, we need to process the next i or maybe process the same i again, but the code as written increments i each time. So for example, after swapping, the next character may now have a mismatch, but the code will not reprocess the current i. So this approach may not work. For example, if after swapping at i=0, the new s[0] is correct, but s[1] may now have a mismatch. But the loop would proceed to i=1 and process it. Wait, the code is a for loop from i=0 to n-1. So for each i, even after swapping, the loop proceeds to i+1. So this may miss some opportunities to swap back. For example, s is \"ab\", t is \"ba\". The code would process i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b', and s[1] is 'b'. So swap them, making s \"ba\". Then i increments to 1. The loop ends. Then s equals t, so output is YES. So this case works. Another example: s is \"abc\", t is \"bac\". At i=0, s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b'. So swap them: s becomes \"bac\". Then i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. Then i increments to 2. s[2] is 'c' which matches. So output is YES. Another example: s is \"acb\", t is \"abc\". At i=1, s[1] is 'c', t[1] is 'b'. Check if s[2] is 'b'. It is. So can we swap 'c' and 'b'? But the allowed swaps are \"bc\" to \"cb\". So in this case, s[1] and s[2] are 'c' and 'b', which is \"cb\". So the swap is not allowed. So the code can't swap them. So the code will proceed, but s will not equal t. So output is NO, which is correct. So this approach seems to handle some cases correctly. But what about cases where multiple swaps are needed? For example, s is \"abba\", t is \"baba\". s: a b b a\n\n   t: b a b a\n\n   Let's see how the code processes this. i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. Check s[1] is 'b'. Swap them. s becomes b a b a. Now, i=0 is processed, and i increments to 1.\n\n   i=1: s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2.\n\n   i=2: s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'b'. i increments to 3. Loop ends. s is now \"baba\", which matches t. So output is YES. Correct. So this approach works. Another example: s is \"abbc\", t is \"babc\". Let's see:\n\n   s: a b b c\n\n   t: b a b c\n\n   Processing i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b'. Swap. Now s is b a b c. i increments to 1.\n\n   i=1: s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2.\n\n   i=2: s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'b'. i increments to 3. Done. s matches t. Correct. Now, a case where the code may fail.",

Correct. So this approach works. So the code's missing part is to handle the two possible swaps: when s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b', and the next character is 'b', swap them. Or when s[i] is 'b' and t[i] is 'c', and the next character is 'c', swap them. So in the code, the missing part is:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else {\n       break; // can't fix, so the loop will exit and check s == t\n   }\n\n   But wait, the code is inside a for loop that increments i each time. So after swapping, the next characters may need to be processed. For example, after swapping at i=0, the code will process i=1 next. But what if the swap at i=0 creates a problem at i=1? The code would process it in the next iteration. However, in the code as given, the loop is a for loop that processes each i once. So, for example, if after swapping at i=0, the new s[0] is 'b', s[1] is 'a', and t[0] is 'b', but s[1] may not match t[1]. The code would process i=0, then increment to i=1 and check if s[1] matches t[1], and swap if possible. So the code's approach is to process each position once. But this may not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed at the same position. For example, s is \"abba\", t is \"baab\". As discussed earlier, the code would swap at i=0 (a and b), making s \"ba b a\". Then, at i=1, s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a' (ok). At i=2: s is 'b', t is 'a'. So s[i] is 'b', t[i] is 'a'. The code checks if i < n-1 (n=4, i=2 < 3). So the code would check if s[i] is 'b' and t[i] is 'a' which is not handled by any of the conditions. So the code would break and exit the loop. Then, s is \"b a b a\", which does not equal t (\"baab\"), so output is NO. But the correct answer is YES. Wait, no. Because the target is \"baab\", and after swapping at i=0, s becomes \"ba b a\". Then, to get \"baab\", we need to swap the third character (b) with the fourth (a). But that's \"ba\", which is allowed. So swap at i=2 and i=3. But the code's loop would process i=0, 1, 2, 3. Let's walk through this example:\n\n   s is \"abba\", t is \"baab\".\n\n   i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b', so swap. Now s is \"ba ba\". i increments to 1.\n\n   i=1: s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2.\n\n   i=2: s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'a'. So s[i] is 'b', t[i] is 'a'. Check if i < n-1 (yes). But none of the conditions apply. So code breaks and loop exits. So s is \"baba\", which is not equal to t \"baab\". So the code outputs NO, but the correct answer is YES. So this approach is not handling all cases correctly. Hmm, so the code's approach of processing each position once is insufficient. This indicates that the code's current approach is flawed. So what's the correct way to handle this?",

But some cases require multiple swaps on the same position. For example, after swapping at i=0, the code moves to i=1, but subsequent swaps may affect previous positions. So perhaps the code needs to process the string in a way that allows rechecking previous positions after a swap. But in the given code's loop structure, it's a for loop that processes each i once. So this approach may not work. Alternative approach: process the string from left to right, and whenever a swap is done, decrement i to recheck the current position again. But this would require using a while loop instead of a for loop. For example:\n\n   for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\n       if (s[i] == t[i]) {\n           i++;\n           continue;\n       }\n       if (i == n-1) break;\n\n       if (s[i] == 'a' && s[i+1] == 'b' && t[i] == 'b') {\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n           i = max(0, i-1); // go back to check previous position\n       }\n       else if (s[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'c' && t[i] == 'c') {\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]); i = max(0, i-1);\n       }\n       else {\n           break;\n       }\n   }\n\n   But this approach could get stuck in an infinite loop.",

But in some cases, the current character cannot be matched immediately, but a swap further to the right would allow a chain of swaps to fix the current position. For example, in the case of s=\"abba\", t=\"baab\":\n\n   After swapping at i=0, s becomes \"b a b a\". Then, the code processes i=0, then i=1. At i=1, s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. So i increments to 2. s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'a'. The code tries to swap with i+1=3. s[3] is 'a'. So the current pair is 'ba', which can be swapped. But according to the allowed swap rules, 'ab' can be swapped to 'ba', but 'ba' can't be swapped to 'ab'. So in this case, the code cannot swap 'ba' to 'ab', so the code breaks. But the desired swap is 'ba' \u2192 'ab', which is not allowed. So the correct answer is NO.\n\n   Wait, no. The target t is \"baab\". So the code's approach gives \"baba\" which is not equal to t. But is there a way to transform s=\"abba\" into t=\"baab\"? Let's see:\n\n   s: a b b a \u2192 target is b a a b.\n\n   Let's see if it's possible. The allowed swaps are:\n\n   - swap 'ab' to 'ba'.

The correct answer for this case is NO. So perhaps the code's approach is correct after all. This suggests that the code's approach of greedily swapping when possible is sufficient. So in the code, the missing code is:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else {\n       break; // cannot swap, so the loop proceeds to next i.\n   }\n\n   But wait, in the code, after swapping, the loop will increment i, but the next character may need to be processed.

So after swapping at i, the code will proceed to i+1. But the swapped character at i+1 may now have a problem that can be fixed by a swap. So the code processes i+1 in the next iteration. For example:\n\n   s is \"abc\", t is \"bac\". Processing i=0: swap 'a' and 'b' \u2192 s becomes \"bac\". Then i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', which matches t[1]. i increments to 2. s[2] matches. Output is YES. Another example: s is \"ab\", t is \"ba\". Swap at i=0. s becomes \"ba\". i increments to 1. Loop ends. Output is YES. So this approach works. So perhaps the code's approach is correct. So the missing code should check for these two conditions and swap if possible. Otherwise, break out of the loop and check if s equals t. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\n   if (s[i] != t[i] && i < n-1) {\n\n       if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n       } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n       } else {\n\n           // Can't swap, so break. break;\n\n       }\n\n   } But wait, after swapping, the code would proceed to the next i. But after swapping, the current i may have been fixed, but the next characters may have new mismatches. But the loop will process them in subsequent iterations. For example:\n\n   s is \"abba\", t is \"baba\". The code's approach:\n\n   i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b'. Swap. s becomes \"ba b a\". i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2. s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'b'. i increments to 3. s[3] is 'a', t[3] is 'a'. Loop ends. s is \"baba\", which does not equal t \"baba\". So output is YES? Wait, no.",

So code outputs YES. But according to the previous example, the code's approach works. So perhaps the code is correct. So the missing code is to check the two allowed swaps and perform them when possible. So the code to fill in is:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   } else {\n\n       break;\n\n   }\n\n   But in the code, after swapping, the loop continues to the next i. So any subsequent mismatches will be handled in later iterations. So this approach should work. But what about cases where the code needs to swap multiple times in the same place? For example, s is \"abb\", t is \"bab\". The code processes i=0: swap 'a' and 'b' \u2192 \"bab\". i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', which matches t[1] ('a'). i increments to 2. s[2] is 'b', which matches. So code outputs YES. Correct. Another example: s is \"abc\", t is \"bca\". This is impossible. The code's approach would swap at i=0 ('a' and 'b'), making s \"bac\". Then i=1, s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'c'. No swap possible. Break. s is \"bac\" ! = t. So output NO. Correct. So the code's approach works.",

So output is NO. Correct. So the code's approach implicitly checks these conditions. Therefore, the code's approach is correct. The missing code is to perform the two allowed swaps when possible. So the code that needs to be filled in is:\n\n   if(s[i]=='a' && t[i]=='b' && s[i+1]=='b') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else if(s[i]=='b' && t[i]=='c' && s[i+1]=='c') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else {\n       break;\n   }\n\n   This code checks for the two allowed swaps and performs them if possible.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if it's possible to transform string s into t using the allowed operations. The allowed operations are swapping \"ab\" to \"ba\" or \"bc\" to \"cb\". Hmm, so these operations let certain characters move past others. Let me think about the possible transformations.\n\nFirst, let's understand the operations. Swapping \"ab\" to \"ba\" allows 'a's and 'b's to switch places, but only if the 'a' is before the 'b'. Similarly, swapping \"bc\" allows 'b's and 'c's to switch. But wait, what's the effect of these operations? For example, 'a's can move past 'b's to the right, but not the other way around? Or wait, no. Because if you have \"ab\", you can swap it to \"ba\". So that means 'a' can move left past 'b's. Wait no, in the swap, the 'a' is moving to the right. Because in \"ab\", after swapping, it's \"ba\". So the 'a' is moving one position to the right. So over multiple operations, an 'a' can shift past a 'b' by swapping each time. Similarly, a 'b' can shift past a 'c' to the right by swapping each occurrence. But what about moving in the opposite direction?\n\nWait, the allowed swaps are \"ab\" becomes \"ba\", which allows 'a's to move to the right (since each swap moves the 'a' past the 'b'). Similarly, \"bc\" becomes \"cb\" allows 'c's to move to the left (since each swap moves the 'c' past the 'b'). Wait, no: swapping \"bc\" to \"cb\" moves the 'c' to the left. So the 'c' can move left, and the 'b' can move right. Wait, no, in the swap of \"bc\" to \"cb\", the 'b' is moving to the right. So in that case, a 'b' can move past a 'c' to the right. Wait, no. Let's see: original is bc. After swapping, it's cb. So the 'b' is now after the 'c'. So the 'b' has moved to the right. Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought. So the allowed swaps are: swap 'a' and 'b' when they are in order 'a' followed by 'b' (so 'a' can move right past 'b'), and swap 'b' and 'c' when in order 'b' followed by 'c' (so 'b' can move right past 'c'? Or wait, after swapping, the 'b' is before 'c' in the original, and after swap, it's 'cb', so the 'b' is after 'c'\u2014so the 'b' can move right past the 'c'? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the allowed operations are to swap \"ab\" to \"ba\", which is moving 'a' to the right (since after the swap, the 'a' is now to the right of the 'b'? No, wait, original is ab. After swap, it becomes ba. So the 'a' was at position i, 'b' at i+1. After swap, 'b' is at i, 'a' at i+1. So the 'a' is moving to the right by one position, and 'b' to the left by one. So over multiple swaps, an 'a' can move past a sequence of 'b's to the right, but not the other way. Similarly, for bc to cb: original is bc. Swap gives cb. So 'b' moves to the right (position i+1) and 'c' moves to the left (position i). So 'b's can move to the right past 'c's. Wait, but in that case, a 'b' can move past a 'c' to the right. So the allowed operations let 'a's and 'b's swap positions (but only when 'a' is first), and 'b's and 'c's swap positions (only when 'b' is first). So the effect is that 'a's can be moved to the right past 'b's, and 'b's can be moved to the right past 'c's. \n\nSo this implies that the relative order of 'a's and 'c's is fixed. Because there's no operation that allows swapping 'a's and 'c's directly. For example, if you have 'ac', you can't swap them. Because the allowed swaps are only ab and bc. So the order between 'a' and 'c' can't be changed. So in the transformed string s, the 'a's must appear in the same order relative to 'c's as in the original s. Wait, no. Because perhaps through a series of swaps involving 'b's, maybe 'a's and 'c's can change their relative positions. Hmm, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the original string is 'ac'. There's no 'ab' or 'bc' here, so no swaps can be done. So the order between 'a' and 'c' can't be changed. So in the target t, any occurrence where an 'a' comes after a 'c' in t but not in s would make it impossible. So the first thing to check is whether the multiset of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's is the same between s and t. Because if the counts don't match, then it's impossible. Then, for each character, the order of 'a's and 'c's in s and t must be the same. Because you can't swap 'a's and 'c's. Also, for the 'a's and 'b's, perhaps their relative order can be modified, but only in a certain way.\n\nWait, the 'a's can move to the right past 'b's. So for example, in the original string 'ab', you can swap to 'ba'. So 'a's can move to the right. So in the transformed string, the 'a's can be in positions after some 'b's. Similarly, 'b's can move to the right past 'c's. So for example, 'bc' becomes 'cb', so 'b' moves right. So in the transformed string, 'b's can be after 'c's.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. The multiset of each character must be the same between s and t. So for each test case, first check if s and t have the same count of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. If not, output NO.\n\nBut wait, in the given code, there's no check for this. So perhaps that's a missing part. Because if the counts are different, it's impossible. So that's a necessary condition.\n\nBut looking at the code given, after some processing, they check if s equals t. So perhaps the code is supposed to process s and t in a way that if possible, modifies s to t. So the code's approach might be to try to perform the swaps in the code's loop.\n\nBut perhaps the code is incomplete. Let's look at the code structure.\n\nThe code reads q test cases, then for each, reads n, s, t. Then, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nIf s[i] != t[i] and i < n-1, then do some processing. Then after all loops, check if s equals t.\n\nSo the idea is to loop through each character, and when a mismatch is found, try to swap. But how?\n\nWait, the code loops over each i, and when s[i] != t[i], and i is not the last index, then there's a code block. So perhaps the code is trying to perform swaps in s to make it equal to t. But the code is missing the actual logic here.\n\nSo what needs to be filled in here is the code that, for a position i where s and t differ, tries to swap the necessary characters to make them match.\n\nBut how? Let's think.\n\nFor example, suppose at position i, s[i] is 'a', and t[i] is 'b'. Then, maybe we need to swap the 'a' with the next 'b' (assuming s[i+1] is 'b'). But according to the allowed operations, you can swap 'ab' to 'ba', which would move the 'a' to the right. So if s has 'ab', swapping gives 'ba', so the 'a' is now in position i+1. But in this case, if the target at position i is 'b', then perhaps this swap would help. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to check for possible swaps and perform them in a way that fixes the current position. But since the code can process the string in a loop, perhaps the code is supposed to handle the transformation step by step.\n\nBut the allowed operations allow swapping 'ab' to 'ba' and 'bc' to 'cb'. So these swaps can be done in any order and any number of times.\n\nBut how can we model the possible transformations?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the allowed swaps allow:\n\n- 'a's can move to the right past 'b's. So, in the transformed string, each 'a' must be in a position >= its original position relative to 'b's. Wait, no. Because each swap moves an 'a' to the right by one, but maybe there are multiple 'b's, allowing the 'a' to move past multiple 'b's. So the 'a's can be rearranged among themselves, but they can also move past 'b's to the right. However, 'a's cannot move past 'c's, unless there are 'b's involved. Wait, no. Since 'a's can only swap with 'b's, and 'b's can swap with 'c's. So perhaps an 'a' can move to the right past a 'b', but then that 'b' could be swapped with a 'c' to the right. So perhaps the 'a's can end up in positions that are to the right of 'c's if there's a 'b' in between.\n\nBut this complicates the matter. So perhaps the correct approach is to process the strings s and t and check the following conditions:\n\n1. The counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's must be the same in both s and t.\n\n2. For each position i, the order of 'a's and 'c's in s and t must be the same. That is, if in s, there's an 'a' at position i and a 'c' at position j, and i < j, then in t, the 'a' must come before the 'c' in their positions. Because there's no way to swap 'a's and 'c's directly. However, if there are 'b's in between, maybe the 'a' can move past 'b's and the 'c' can move past 'b's in the other direction, allowing the 'a' and 'c' to swap places. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose s is 'acb'. The allowed operations are to swap 'ab' (if present) and 'bc' (if present). Here, the 'c' is after 'a' and before 'b'. Suppose we want to turn this into 'cab'. How?\n\nOriginal is a c b.\n\nWe can swap 'cb' (positions 2 and 3) to get 'acb' \u2192 'abc'? Wait, no. 'bc' is allowed. So the 'b' and 'c' can be swapped. So in 'acb', there's a 'cb' in positions 2-3. So swapping them would give 'acb' \u2192 'abc'? Wait, original is a c b. The substring at positions 2-3 is 'cb', which is allowed. So swapping 'cb' gives 'acb' \u2192 'abc'? No. Wait, no. The allowed swap is 'bc' to 'cb', but in this case, the substring is 'cb'. So that's not allowed. So the swap is only allowed when the substring is 'bc'. So to swap 'bc' into 'cb', but in this case, the substring is 'cb', so you can't swap that. So in the original 'acb', there's no allowed swaps. So you can't change it. So the target 'cab' would be impossible.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the order of 'a's and 'c's cannot be altered. So for any i and j where s[i] is 'a' and s[j] is 'c' and i < j, in t, all 'a's must come before 'c's. So in other words, the relative order of 'a's and 'c's in t must be the same as in s. Wait, no. Because suppose in s, the 'a's and 'c's are in a certain order, but in t, their order is different. Then, since there's no way to swap 'a' and 'c's directly, or through other swaps, that would make it impossible.\n\nSo another condition is that for all positions i in s and t, if in s, an 'a' is at position i and a 'c' is at position j > i, then in t, the 'a' must appear before the 'c' in the same order. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nBut how to check that? Because in s and t, the 'a's and 'c's must form the same sequence when you ignore the 'b's.\n\nSo another approach: create a version of s and t where all 'b's are removed. If these two versions are not equal, then the answer is NO. Because you cannot swap 'a's and 'c's, so their relative order must remain the same.\n\nSo this is a crucial condition. So steps:\n\n1. Check if the multiset of 'a's, 'b's, 'c's is the same in s and t.\n\n2. Check that the order of 'a's and 'c's (ignoring 'b's) is the same in s and t.\n\nIf either of these is false, output NO.\n\nThen, for the remaining cases, check the order of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in a way that allows the swaps.\n\nWait, but even if the 'a's and 'c's are in the same order, there's another problem. For example, consider s = \"acb\" and t = \"abc\". Here, the 'a's and 'c's are in the same order (since ignoring 'b's, s is \"ac\", t is \"ac\"). But the 'c' and 'b' are swapped. So can we swap the 'cb' into 'bc'? No, because the allowed swap is for 'bc' to become 'cb'. So in s, the 'c' is before 'b'. The allowed swap is for 'bc' to 'cb'. But here, the 'c' is before 'b', which can't be swapped. So in this case, the 'b' is after the 'c', so we cannot swap them. So the target 'abc' would require the 'b' to be after the 'c' in s, but we can't perform the swap. So in this case, it's impossible.\n\nSo the problem is that for 'b's and 'c's, you can only swap when 'b' is before 'c', which allows the 'b' to move to the right. So in t, any 'c' that comes before a 'b' must have a way to have been moved there via swaps, but since the allowed swap is only bc to cb, the 'b's can't move left past 'c's. So for 'b's and 'c's, in the transformed string t, the 'b's must appear in a position that is >= their original positions relative to 'c's.\n\nWait, no. Because each swap of 'bc' to 'cb' moves the 'b' one position to the right. So a 'b' can move to the right past 'c's. So in s, if a 'b' is followed by a 'c', we can swap them, making 'cb'. Then, if there's another 'c' to the right, the 'b' can swap again. For example, if s is 'bcc', then after swapping the first two characters (bc becomes cb), we get 'cbc'. Then, the 'b' is followed by 'c', so we can swap again to get 'ccb'. So the 'b' can move two positions to the right. So in the target t, the 'b's can be after some 'c's as long as they are originally before those 'c's in s and can move right via swaps. But if in t a 'b' comes before a 'c' where in s the 'c' comes before the 'b', then it's impossible.\n\nWait, no. For example, in s the 'c' comes before 'b', which is \"cb\". Then, since the allowed swap is 'bc' \u2192 'cb', which is the reverse. So we can't swap \"cb\" to \"bc\". So once a 'b' is to the right of a 'c', you can't swap them. So in s, if there's a 'c' followed by a 'b', you can't swap them. So in t, if that 'b' needs to be to the left of the 'c', but in s it's to the right, then it's impossible. So the relative order of 'b's and 'c's in s and t must be such that in t, each 'b' that is to the left of a 'c' must have been in s in a position that allows moving left. Wait, but since the swaps can only move 'b's to the right past 'c's, then in s, if a 'b' is to the left of a 'c', then in t, the 'b' can be further to the right of that 'c'. But if in s, a 'b' is to the right of a 'c', then you can't swap them to move the 'b' to the left of the 'c'. So in this case, in t, any 'b' that is to the left of a 'c' must have that 'b' in s in a position that is to the left of that 'c' in s.\n\nSo for example, if in s we have \"cb\", then in t, the 'b' can't be moved to the left of the 'c'. So in t, if there's a 'b' before a 'c' where in s the 'c' is before the 'b', then it's impossible.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to check, for each 'b' in s and t, their positions relative to 'a's and 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the allowed movements:\n\n- 'a's can move to the right past 'b's.\n\n- 'c's can move to the left past 'b's.\n\nWait, no. Because the allowed swaps for 'bc' to 'cb' allows 'b's to move to the right past 'c's. So a 'b' in 'bc' can move to the right. So for 'b's and 'c's, the allowed swaps allow 'b's to move to the right past 'c's. So in the transformed string, a 'b' can be after a 'c' only if there was a 'bc' in the original s that was swapped. But if the original s has 'cb', then the 'b' can't move past the 'c' to the left. So in this case, the 'b' is stuck to the right of the 'c'.\n\nSo this suggests that in the target t, for each 'b' and 'c' pair:\n\n- If in s, the 'b' is before the 'c', then in t, the 'b' can be either before or after the 'c' (since the 'b' can move right past the 'c' via swaps).\n\n- If in s, the 'b' is after the 'c', then in t, the 'b' must be after the 'c' (since you can't swap 'cb' to 'bc').\n\nSo the 'b's in t can't be to the left of a 'c' unless they were already to the left of that 'c' in s.\n\nSimilarly, for 'a's and 'b's:\n\nThe 'a's can move to the right past 'b's. So in s, if an 'a' is before a 'b', then in t, the 'a' can be after the 'b' (if swapped), but the 'a's can't move to the left past 'b's. Wait, no: the 'ab' swap allows the 'a' to move to the right. So if in s, an 'a' is after a 'b', then you can't swap them. So in t, if an 'a' is before a 'b' where in s the 'a' is after the 'b', then it's impossible.\n\nWait, for example, s is \"ba\". Then you can't swap them, since the allowed swap is 'ab' \u2192 'ba'. So 'ba' can't be swapped. So the 'a' can't move to the left. So in s, if an 'a' is after a 'b', then in t, that 'a' must remain after that 'b'. So the 'a's can only move to the right past 'b's.\n\nSo this suggests that the relative order of 'a's and 'b's in s and t must be such that, for any 'a' and 'b' in s, if the 'a' is before the 'b' in s, then in t, the 'a' can be either before or after the 'b', but if the 'a' is after the 'b' in s, then in t the 'a' must also be after the 'b'.\n\nWait, no. Because if in s, the 'a' is after the 'b' (s is \"ba\"), then you can't swap them. So the 'a' can't move left. So in t, that 'a' must be after the 'b'. So the 'a's in t can't appear before any 'b's that they were after in s.\n\nSimilarly, for 'b's and 'c's: if in s, the 'b' is after a 'c' (s is \"cb\"), then you can't swap them. So in t, that 'b' must remain after the 'c'.\n\nSo, combining all these observations, the conditions for s to be transformable into t are:\n\n1. s and t have the same multiset of characters (a's, b's, c's).\n\n2. The sequence of a's and c's in s and t (ignoring the b's) must be the same.\n\n3. For each position in s and t:\n\n   a. For any a in t, the number of a's before the current position must be <= the number of a's in s up to the current position. Because a's can only move to the right. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the order of a's and b's must be such that in the positions of a's in s, in t, each a can't appear before where it was in s. Because a's can only move to the right through swaps with b's.\n\nSo for each a in s at position i, in t, the a must be at a position j >= i's position adjusted for the movement through swaps. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compare the order of the a's, b's, and c's in a way that allows for the swaps.\n\nAnother approach is to model the possible permutations allowed by the swaps. Since the swaps allow:\n\n- a's can move to the right past b's.\n\n- b's can move to the right past c's.\n\nSo, the permutations allowed are such that:\n\n- The relative order of a's and c's must be preserved.\n\n- For a's and b's: each a in s must appear in t at a position that is not earlier than their original position in s, considering that they can move past b's to the right.\n\nWait, no. Because a's can move past any number of b's to the right. So for example, if s is \"abbb\", then the a can swap with each b in sequence to become \"baab\", then \"bbaa\", etc. So the a can move any number of steps to the right past b's. So in t, the a's can be anywhere to the right of their original positions, but their order relative to other a's is preserved (since swapping a's with b's doesn't affect other a's).\n\nSimilarly, b's can move past c's to the right. So a b in s can move to the right past any number of c's in the string.\n\nBut the relative order of a's and c's must remain the same.\n\nSo, how to model this in code.\n\nThe steps to check:\n\n1. Check that the counts of a, b, c are the same in s and t.\n\n2. Check that the a's and c's, when taken in order (ignoring b's), form the same sequence in s and t.\n\n3. For the remaining characters (a's and c's are in order), check that for each character in s and t:\n\n   a. For a's: in t, each a must not be positioned before where it could have been moved via swapping with b's. But how?\n\n   Alternatively, for the a's in s and t:\n\n   For each a in s, in the original s, let's look at its position. In t, the a's can be moved to the right past b's. So the order of a's in t must be the same as in s, but each a can be anywhere to the right, but not passed c's.\n\n   Wait, but a's can't pass c's. So if in s, an a is before a c, then in t, the a must also be before the c. Because there's no way to swap a's and c's. So the positions of a's and c's must remain in the same order as in s.\n\n   So combining this with the earlier condition about the a's and c's when ignoring the b's, the first two steps are correct.\n\n   Now, for the a's and b's:\n\n   For a given a in s, in t, the a can be moved to the right past any number of b's, but cannot cross a c.\n\n   So for each a in s and its corresponding a in t (since the order is preserved when ignoring b's and c's?), the a in t must be at a position that is not before its original position in s, but how to model that.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps a better way is to process the strings s and t from left to right, keeping track of the a's, b's, and c's, and ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\n   Let's think for each position i in s and t:\n\n   For each i, compare s[i] and t[i]. If they are the same, proceed. If not:\n\n   Suppose in s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b'. Then, perhaps we can swap this 'a' with the next 'b' in s. But how?\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the key is to look for the positions where s and t differ and see if a swap is possible.\n\n   The code given in the problem has a loop over each i, and when s[i] != t[i] and i is not the last index, then there's some code to process. So the code's approach may be to look for a position where a swap can be done to make s[i] equal to t[i].\n\n   So perhaps in the code, when s[i] is not equal to t[i], the code will check if a swap can be done at positions i and i+1. For example:\n\n   Suppose s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b'. Then, perhaps the code checks if s[i+1] is 'b', and swaps them. But according to the allowed swaps, swapping 'ab' is allowed, which would turn 'ab' into 'ba'. So after swapping, s[i] becomes 'b', which matches t[i]. So this would solve the problem for this position.\n\n   Similarly, if s[i] is 'b' and t[i] is 'c', then perhaps the code checks if s[i+1] is 'c' and swaps them. But according to the allowed swaps, you can swap 'bc' into 'cb'. So after swapping, the 'b' moves to i+1, and 'c' to i. So s[i] becomes 'c', which matches t[i].\n\n   So the code's approach is to perform such swaps as needed.\n\n   But how to implement this in the given code?\n\n   Let's look at the code structure. The code loops over each i from 0 to n-1. For each i, if s[i] != t[i] and i < n-1, then do some code. So the code is trying to fix s[i] by swapping with the next character. So for each position i, if it's different from t[i], and there's a next character, then swap if possible.\n\n   So the code may look something like:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b') {\n\n       if (s[i+1] == 'b') { swap them, incrementing i or something }\n\n   }\n\n   else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c') {\n\n       if (s[i+1] == 'c') { swap them }\n\n   }\n\n   else {\n\n       // no possible swap, so break and output no.\n\n   }\n\n   But this approach may not work for all cases. For example, suppose s is \"abc\" and t is \"bac\". Then, to fix the first 'a' to 'b', we can swap the first two characters. But after that, the string becomes \"bac\", which matches t. So this case would be handled correctly.\n\n   But what about when the required swap is further away? For example, s is \"acb\" and t is \"abc\". Here, the 'c' and 'b' need to be swapped, but the code would process each i. At i=0, s[i] is 'a', t[i] is 'a' (matches). At i=1: s[i] is 'c', t[i] is 'b'. So the code would check if i is less than n-1. i=1 is less than 2 (since n=3). So the code would check if a swap can be done here. But s[i] is 'c' and t[i] is 'b'. The allowed swaps are 'ab' and 'bc'. So in this case, the code can't swap 'c' with the next character (which is 'b'), because 'cb' is not allowed. So this case would fail, which is correct.\n\n   So the code's approach of trying to swap adjacent characters when there's a mismatch may not cover all possible cases, but perhaps after processing all positions, if the final s equals t, then it's possible.\n\n   But the problem is that this approach may not cover all possible swap sequences. For example, a swap may need to be done further to the right and then propagated back. For example:\n\n   s is \"abbc\", and t is \"bab c\".\n\n   Wait, perhaps a more complex example. Let's say s is \"abba\", and t is \"baab\". How can the code handle this?\n\n   But perhaps the code's approach is to greedily swap whenever possible, and after processing all positions, check if s equals t. But how to handle cases where multiple swaps are needed.\n\n   Alternatively, the code's loop may need to process the string in a certain order, perhaps from left to right, and perform swaps as needed.\n\n   So perhaps the correct code to fill in is to check if the current character can be swapped with the next character to match t[i], and perform that swap.\n\n   For example, if s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b', then check if s[i+1] is 'b' and swap them, making s[i] = 'b' and s[i+1] = 'a'. Then, after this swap, the next characters may need to be processed.\n\n   Similarly, if s[i] is 'b' and t[i] is 'c', check if s[i+1] is 'c' and swap.\n\n   So the code in the loop would be:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   }\n\n   else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   }\n\n   else {\n\n       break; // can't fix, so exit loop\n\n   }\n\n   But wait, the code is inside a for loop over i from 0 to n-1. So after swapping, we need to process the next i or maybe process the same i again, but the code as written increments i each time.\n\n   So for example, after swapping, the next character may now have a mismatch, but the code will not reprocess the current i. So this approach may not work. For example, if after swapping at i=0, the new s[0] is correct, but s[1] may now have a mismatch. But the loop would proceed to i=1 and process it.\n\n   Wait, the code is a for loop from i=0 to n-1. So for each i, even after swapping, the loop proceeds to i+1. So this may miss some opportunities to swap back.\n\n   For example, s is \"ab\", t is \"ba\". The code would process i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b', and s[1] is 'b'. So swap them, making s \"ba\". Then i increments to 1. The loop ends. Then s equals t, so output is YES. So this case works.\n\n   Another example: s is \"abc\", t is \"bac\". At i=0, s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b'. So swap them: s becomes \"bac\". Then i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. Then i increments to 2. s[2] is 'c' which matches. So output is YES.\n\n   Another example: s is \"acb\", t is \"abc\". At i=1, s[1] is 'c', t[1] is 'b'. Check if s[2] is 'b'. It is. So can we swap 'c' and 'b'? But the allowed swaps are \"bc\" to \"cb\". So in this case, s[1] and s[2] are 'c' and 'b', which is \"cb\". So the swap is not allowed. So the code can't swap them. So the code will proceed, but s will not equal t. So output is NO, which is correct.\n\n   So this approach seems to handle some cases correctly. But what about cases where multiple swaps are needed?\n\n   For example, s is \"abba\", t is \"baba\".\n\n   s: a b b a\n\n   t: b a b a\n\n   Let's see how the code processes this.\n\n   i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. Check s[1] is 'b'. Swap them. s becomes b a b a. Now, i=0 is processed, and i increments to 1.\n\n   i=1: s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2.\n\n   i=2: s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'b'. i increments to 3. Loop ends.\n\n   s is now \"baba\", which matches t. So output is YES. Correct.\n\n   So this approach works.\n\n   Another example: s is \"abbc\", t is \"babc\". Let's see:\n\n   s: a b b c\n\n   t: b a b c\n\n   Processing i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b'. Swap. Now s is b a b c. i increments to 1.\n\n   i=1: s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2.\n\n   i=2: s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'b'. i increments to 3. Done. s matches t. Correct.\n\n   Now, a case where the code may fail.\n\n   For example, s is \"abc\", t is \"bca\". But according to the earlier analysis, this is impossible. Let's see.\n\n   s: a b c\n\n   t: b c a\n\n   The code would process i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b'. Swap. Now s is b a c. i=0 increments to 1.\n\n   i=1: s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'c'. Check if i < n-1 (yes). Can we swap a with c? The allowed swaps are 'ab' and 'bc'. So no. So code breaks, loop exits. s is \"bac\", which is not equal to t (\"bca\"). So output is NO. Correct.\n\n   So the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\n   Now, a more complex case where multiple swaps are needed. For example, s is \"acbc\" and t is \"abcc\". Let's see:\n\n   s: a c b c\n\n   t: a b c c\n\n   The code would process i=0 (matches), i=1: s[1] is 'c', t[1] is 'b'. i=1 < 3. Check if s[1] and s[2] can be swapped. s[1] is 'c', s[2] is 'b'. The allowed swaps are 'bc' \u2192 'cb'. But the current pair is 'cb', so can't swap. So the code can't process this. So the code would break. But wait, perhaps there's a different way to swap.\n\n   In s, the 'c' and 'b' are at positions 1 and 2. To swap them, but the allowed swaps are for 'bc', not 'cb'. So this can't be done. So the code would output NO, which is correct.\n\n   Now, another example: s is \"abcc\", t is \"acbc\".\n\n   s: a b c c\n\n   t: a c b c\n\n   Processing i=0: ok. i=1: s is 'b', t is 'c'. Check next character: s[i+1] is 'c'. Allowed swap is 'bc' \u2192 'cb'. So swap. Now s becomes a c b c. i increments to 2. Processing i=2: s is 'b', t is 'b'. i=3: ok. s equals t, so output YES. Correct.\n\n   So this approach works.\n\n   So the code's missing part is to handle the two possible swaps: when s[i] is 'a' and t[i] is 'b', and the next character is 'b', swap them. Or when s[i] is 'b' and t[i] is 'c', and the next character is 'c', swap them.\n\n   So in the code, the missing part is:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else {\n       break; // can't fix, so the loop will exit and check s == t\n   }\n\n   But wait, the code is inside a for loop that increments i each time. So after swapping, the next characters may need to be processed. For example, after swapping at i=0, the code will process i=1 next. But what if the swap at i=0 creates a problem at i=1? The code would process it in the next iteration.\n\n   However, in the code as given, the loop is a for loop that processes each i once. So, for example, if after swapping at i=0, the new s[0] is 'b', s[1] is 'a', and t[0] is 'b', but s[1] may not match t[1]. The code would process i=0, then increment to i=1 and check if s[1] matches t[1], and swap if possible.\n\n   So the code's approach is to process each position once. But this may not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed at the same position.\n\n   For example, s is \"abba\", t is \"baab\". As discussed earlier, the code would swap at i=0 (a and b), making s \"ba b a\". Then, at i=1, s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a' (ok). At i=2: s is 'b', t is 'a'. So s[i] is 'b', t[i] is 'a'. The code checks if i < n-1 (n=4, i=2 < 3). So the code would check if s[i] is 'b' and t[i] is 'a' which is not handled by any of the conditions. So the code would break and exit the loop. Then, s is \"b a b a\", which does not equal t (\"baab\"), so output is NO. But the correct answer is YES.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the target is \"baab\", and after swapping at i=0, s becomes \"ba b a\". Then, to get \"baab\", we need to swap the third character (b) with the fourth (a). But that's \"ba\", which is allowed. So swap at i=2 and i=3. But the code's loop would process i=0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n   Let's walk through this example:\n\n   s is \"abba\", t is \"baab\".\n\n   i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b', so swap. Now s is \"ba ba\". i increments to 1.\n\n   i=1: s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2.\n\n   i=2: s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'a'. So s[i] is 'b', t[i] is 'a'. Check if i < n-1 (yes). But none of the conditions apply. So code breaks and loop exits. So s is \"baba\", which is not equal to t \"baab\". So the code outputs NO, but the correct answer is YES.\n\n   So this approach is not handling all cases correctly.\n\n   Hmm, so the code's approach of processing each position once is insufficient.\n\n   This indicates that the code's current approach is flawed. So what's the correct way to handle this?\n\n   The problem is that the code only allows one swap per position and moves forward. But some cases require multiple swaps on the same position. For example, after swapping at i=0, the code moves to i=1, but subsequent swaps may affect previous positions.\n\n   So perhaps the code needs to process the string in a way that allows rechecking previous positions after a swap. But in the given code's loop structure, it's a for loop that processes each i once. So this approach may not work.\n\n   Alternative approach: process the string from left to right, and whenever a swap is done, decrement i to recheck the current position again. But this would require using a while loop instead of a for loop.\n\n   For example:\n\n   for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\n       if (s[i] == t[i]) {\n           i++;\n           continue;\n       }\n       if (i == n-1) break;\n\n       if (s[i] == 'a' && s[i+1] == 'b' && t[i] == 'b') {\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n           i = max(0, i-1); // go back to check previous position\n       }\n       else if (s[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'c' && t[i] == 'c') {\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n           i = max(0, i-1);\n       }\n       else {\n           break;\n       }\n   }\n\n   But this approach could get stuck in an infinite loop. For example, if the swap is done and then rechecked but no progress is made.\n\n   Alternatively, process the string in passes, but this may not be efficient.\n\n   But given the problem's constraints (n up to 1e5 and q up to 1e4), the code must be efficient. So an O(n) approach is needed.\n\n   So the initial approach of processing each i once is O(n), but may not handle all cases. The code provided in the problem may be incomplete.\n\n   So the code's current approach is to process each i once and perform a swap if possible. But this may not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed.\n\n   So how to handle such cases within the given code structure?\n\n   Let's think again about the problem's allowed swaps. Each swap can be done any number of times. So the order in which swaps are done may not matter. But the code's approach of processing from left to right and performing swaps when needed may be sufficient.\n\n   For example, the code may not handle cases where a swap further to the right would allow a swap to the left. But according to the allowed swaps, the 'a's can move to the right past 'b's, and 'b's can move to the right past 'c's. So perhaps any valid transformation can be achieved by greedily processing from left to right.\n\n   Let's re-examine the example where s is \"abba\" and t is \"baab\".\n\n   After processing i=0, s becomes \"baba\". The code's loop will process i=0, then 1, 2, 3. At i=2, s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'a'. The code checks if s[2] can be swapped with s[3], which is 'a'. So s[2] is 'b', s[3] is 'a'. But the allowed swaps are 'ab' to 'ba'. So the code would swap them, but only if s[2] is 'a' and s[3] is 'b'. Which is not the case here. So no swap possible, loop breaks, and s remains \"baba\", which is not equal to t. So the code outputs NO, but the correct answer is YES.\n\n   So this indicates that the code's approach is incorrect. So the code's current approach is missing some cases.\n\n   So what's the problem here?\n\n   The problem is that the code's approach only swaps when the current character can be matched to the target by swapping with the next character. But in some cases, the current character cannot be matched immediately, but a swap further to the right would allow a chain of swaps to fix the current position.\n\n   For example, in the case of s=\"abba\", t=\"baab\":\n\n   After swapping at i=0, s becomes \"b a b a\". Then, the code processes i=0, then i=1. At i=1, s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. So i increments to 2. s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'a'. The code tries to swap with i+1=3. s[3] is 'a'. So the current pair is 'ba', which can be swapped. But according to the allowed swap rules, 'ab' can be swapped to 'ba', but 'ba' can't be swapped to 'ab'. So in this case, the code cannot swap 'ba' to 'ab', so the code breaks. But the desired swap is 'ba' \u2192 'ab', which is not allowed. So the correct answer is NO.\n\n   Wait, no. The target t is \"baab\". So the code's approach gives \"baba\" which is not equal to t. But is there a way to transform s=\"abba\" into t=\"baab\"?\n\n   Let's see:\n\n   s: a b b a \u2192 target is b a a b.\n\n   Let's see if it's possible.\n\n   The allowed swaps are:\n\n   - swap 'ab' to 'ba'.\n\n   So the first 'ab' in s is positions 0-1: 'ab' \u2192 swap to 'ba'. s becomes b a b a.\n\n   Then, the next 'ab' is positions 2-3: 'ba' cannot be swapped. So no more swaps.\n\n   So the resulting s is \"b a b a\", which is not equal to t \"baab\". So the answer is NO. So the code's output is correct. So my previous assumption was wrong. The correct answer for this case is NO.\n\n   So perhaps the code's approach is correct after all.\n\n   This suggests that the code's approach of greedily swapping when possible is sufficient.\n\n   So in the code, the missing code is:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else {\n       break; // cannot swap, so the loop proceeds to next i.\n   }\n\n   But wait, in the code, after swapping, the loop will increment i, but the next character may need to be processed. However, this approach may not catch all possible swaps.\n\n   Wait, the code is inside a for loop that runs for each i from 0 to n-1. So after swapping at i, the code will proceed to i+1. But the swapped character at i+1 may now have a problem that can be fixed by a swap. So the code processes i+1 in the next iteration.\n\n   For example:\n\n   s is \"abc\", t is \"bac\".\n\n   Processing i=0: swap 'a' and 'b' \u2192 s becomes \"bac\". Then i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', which matches t[1]. i increments to 2. s[2] matches. Output is YES.\n\n   Another example: s is \"ab\", t is \"ba\". Swap at i=0. s becomes \"ba\". i increments to 1. Loop ends. Output is YES.\n\n   So this approach works.\n\n   So perhaps the code's approach is correct. So the missing code should check for these two conditions and swap if possible. Otherwise, break out of the loop and check if s equals t.\n\n   So the code inside the loop would be:\n\n   if (s[i] != t[i] && i < n-1) {\n\n       if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n       } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n\n           swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n       } else {\n\n           // Can't swap, so break.\n\n           break;\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n   But wait, after swapping, the code would proceed to the next i. But after swapping, the current i may have been fixed, but the next characters may have new mismatches. But the loop will process them in subsequent iterations.\n\n   For example:\n\n   s is \"abba\", t is \"baba\".\n\n   The code's approach:\n\n   i=0: s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'b'. s[1] is 'b'. Swap. s becomes \"ba b a\".\n\n   i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'a'. i increments to 2. s[2] is 'b', t[2] is 'b'. i increments to 3. s[3] is 'a', t[3] is 'a'. Loop ends. s is \"baba\", which does not equal t \"baba\". So output is YES? Wait, no. The target is \"baba\", but after swapping, s is \"ba b a\" \u2192 \"baba\". So it's the same as the target. So code outputs YES. So why earlier analysis said the correct answer is NO?\n\n   Wait, in this example, the target is \"baba\" and s after swapping is \"baba\". So code outputs YES. But according to the previous example, the code's approach works.\n\n   So perhaps the code is correct.\n\n   So the missing code is to check the two allowed swaps and perform them when possible.\n\n   So the code to fill in is:\n\n   if (s[i] == 'a' && t[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'b') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   } else if (s[i] == 'b' && t[i] == 'c' && s[i+1] == 'c') {\n\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n\n   } else {\n\n       break;\n\n   }\n\n   But in the code, after swapping, the loop continues to the next i. So any subsequent mismatches will be handled in later iterations.\n\n   So this approach should work.\n\n   But what about cases where the code needs to swap multiple times in the same place? For example, s is \"abb\", t is \"bab\".\n\n   The code processes i=0: swap 'a' and 'b' \u2192 \"bab\". i increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', which matches t[1] ('a'). i increments to 2. s[2] is 'b', which matches. So code outputs YES. Correct.\n\n   Another example: s is \"abc\", t is \"bca\". This is impossible. The code's approach would swap at i=0 ('a' and 'b'), making s \"bac\". Then i=1, s[1] is 'a', t[1] is 'c'. No swap possible. Break. s is \"bac\" != t. So output NO. Correct.\n\n   So the code's approach works.\n\n   Now, the code also needs to handle the other conditions: the multiset of characters must be the same, and the a's and c's must be in the same order when ignoring b's.\n\n   But the given code does not check these conditions. So perhaps the code's approach is incomplete.\n\n   For example, if s and t have different counts of 'a's, the code would process the swaps and may end up with s == t, but in reality, it's impossible. For example, s has an extra 'a', but the code's swaps may not change the counts. So the code's approach may incorrectly output YES.\n\n   So the code is missing the initial checks for the counts and the order of a's and c's.\n\n   But according to the problem's code skeleton, the code's for loop is the only code that modifies s, and after processing, it checks if s equals t. So if the initial conditions (counts and order of a's and c's) are not met, the code will not be able to make s equal to t, even after performing swaps.\n\n   But how?\n\n   For example, if s has a different count of 'a's than t, then after any swaps, the counts are preserved. So the code would fail to make s equal to t, and output NO.\n\n   Similarly, if the order of a's and c's is different, then even after swaps, the code would not be able to fix this.\n\n   So the code's approach implicitly checks these conditions by checking if s equals t after processing. But in reality, this may not be sufficient.\n\n   For example, consider s and t have the same counts, but the order of a's and c's is different. The code would process the swaps, but since the order of a's and c's can't be changed, the code would output NO.\n\n   So the code's approach may work correctly even without explicitly checking these conditions. But there are cases where the code may incorrectly output YES.\n\n   For example, s is \"ac\" and t is \"ca\". The counts are the same. The code's loop would process i=0. s[0] is 'a', t[0] is 'c'. i < n-1 (1). Check if s[i+1] is 'c' and possible swaps. But the allowed swaps are ab and bc. So no swaps possible. So code breaks. s remains \"ac\", which is not equal to \"ca\". So output is NO. Correct.\n\n   So the code's approach implicitly checks these conditions.\n\n   Therefore, the code's approach is correct. The missing code is to perform the two allowed swaps when possible.\n\n   So the code that needs to be filled in is:\n\n   if(s[i]=='a' && t[i]=='b' && s[i+1]=='b') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else if(s[i]=='b' && t[i]=='c' && s[i+1]=='c') {\n       swap(s[i], s[i+1]);\n   } else {\n       break;\n   }\n\n   This code checks for the two allowed swaps and performs them if possible. Otherwise, it breaks the loop, and the code proceeds to check if s equals t.\n\n   So this is the correct code to fill in the missing part."
