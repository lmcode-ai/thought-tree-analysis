But the operations that include p(u) but not u (like operations whose path ends at a sibling of u) will contribute to s_p(u) but not to s_u.

So in the sum s_p(u), there are contributions from operations that include u (which have c_i for p(u) <= c_i for u in those operations) and operations that don't include u (which have no relation to u). Therefore, s_p(u) can be larger than s_u. But according to the problem's constraints, the final a_v must be between l_v and r_v, but there's no explicit requirement that a_v >= a_p(v). Wait, but the problem doesn't require the a_v's to form a non-decreasing sequence. Only that each a_v is within [l_v, r_v]. So perhaps the earlier conclusion was wrong. Wait, but the problem allows any sequence of operations. The a_v's can be anything as long as they are within their [l, r] ranges. The only constraints are on the operations' structure. But in each operation, the c array is non-decreasing. So the sum of all operations' contributions to a node u must be such that, for each operation that includes u, the c_i for u is >= the c_i for p(u) in that same operation.

But how to model this. Another sample: the second test case. Test case 2:\n\nn=3. Parents of 2 and 3: 1 and 2. Wait, the input is p_2, p_3. So the code reads p_2 as 1 (so node 1's parent is 0), p_3 as 2 (so node 2's parent is 1). So the tree is 0 ->1 ->2. The l and r for the nodes are:\n\nnode 0: l=5, r=5. node 1: l=3, r=3. node 2: l=7, r=7. The solution requires two operations. First, choose v=2 (node 1 in code, since code is 0-based?), path is 0,1. Then choose c=[3,3], sum for node 0 is 3, node 1 is 3. Then choose v=3 (node 2), path is 0,1,2. Choose c=[2,7,7]. Wait, no. Wait in the sample explanation, after first operation, a_1 (node 0) is 3, a_2 (node1) is 3. Then, second operation is choosing v=3 (node2), c=[2,7]. So the path is 0,1,2. But the c array must be non-decreasing. So [2,7,7] would be allowed. Then sum for node0 is 3+2=5, node1 is 3+7=10? Wait, but that's not matching the sample explanation. Wait, perhaps the code's 0-based indices are causing confusion. Let me re-examine the sample explanation. Sample Input 2:\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\nThen three lines of l and r:\n\n5 5 (for node 1, but code uses 0-based, so node 0's l=5, r=5)\n\n3 3 (node1)\n\n7 7 (node2) Then the sample explanation says first choose v=2 (code's node1) and c = [3,3]. So the path is nodes 0 and 1. Then a_0=3, a_1=3, a_2=0. Then choose v=3 (node2 in input, code's node2) and c=[2,7]. Wait, but the path for node2 is 0,1,2. So the c array must be length 3, but the sample says [2,7]. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the code's input is different. Alternatively, perhaps in the sample explanation, the first operation's v is 2 (node2 in input), which is code's node1 (since the input is p_2=1, which becomes code's p[1] =0).",

Sample explanation for test case2: First operation: choose v=2 (input's node2, which is code's node1). Path is 0,1. So c is [3,3]. a_0 becomes 3, a_1 becomes 3.

Then, l and r for node 0 (which is root) are 1 and 1, and for node 1 (child of 0) are 2 and 2. So in the sample, the solution is to apply one operation on the path to node 1 (0 and 1), with c=[1,2], which gives a_0=1, a_1=2. So the sum for the root is 1 (from c_1=1 in the operation), and for the child it's 2 (from c_2=2). The c array is non-decreasing (1 <= 2), so it's valid. Thus, the minimal number of operations is 1.

But in this case, the child's sum is the sum of all operations that include the child's path (i.e., operations on the child or any of its descendants). So the parent's sum includes all operations that include the parent (which includes all operations that include the child, plus any operations that include the parent but not the child). Therefore, s_p(u) = sum of contributions from all operations that include p(u), which includes all operations that include u (since p(u) is on the path to u) plus any operations that end at p(u) or any other sibling of u.\n\nBut the sum s_p(u) could be greater than s_u, but that's allowed. So the key is to determine the minimal number of operations such that each node's sum is in [l, r], and each operation's c array is non-decreasing. But how to model this with dynamic programming. The code's approach uses a dp array.",

But the code's dp array is of type long long, which suggests it's storing the maximum possible sum, and k is the number of operations. Wait, in the code's existing loop, after processing all children of node i, they update the DP for node i. The variable k is the answer, which is the minimal number of operations. Let me think of the first sample. After processing node 1 (the child), then processing node 0 (root). For the root, the required l is 1, r is 1. The child's l and r are 2 and 2. The code's DP for node 1 (processed first) would set dp[1] to 2. Then, for node 0, since the parent's required sum is 1, which is <= 2 (child's dp), but the parent's required sum is 1. So perhaps the code would merge these into one operation. But how?\n\nAnother approach: the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of nodes where the required l_i exceeds the maximum sum that can be passed down from the parent. But this is vague. Wait, looking for hints from the code: The code's main loop is:\n\nfor (i = n-1; i >=0; i--) {\n\n   // code here\n\n}\n\nSo nodes are processed from last to first. So in 0-based, node 0 is the root. The loop starts from the highest index (n-1) down to 0. So the root is processed last.",

This seems plausible. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Process nodes in post-order (children before parents). 2. For each node u, compute the minimal required s_p(u) to satisfy s_u >= l_u. Since s_p(u) >= s_u, we have s_u >= l_u implies s_p(u) >= l_u. But to have s_u >= l_u, s_p(u) must be >= s_u >= l_u. So the minimal s_p(u) is max(s_p(u), l_u). Wait, perhaps for each node u, the required s_p(u) must be >= s_u. And s_u must be >= l_u, s_u <= r_u.\n\nBut when processing u, since p(u) is processed after u, we can compute the required minimal s_p(u) to ensure that s_u can be set to a value between l_u and r_u. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in reverse. Suppose we have processed all children of node u. Each child v of u requires that s_u > = s_v (since u is the parent of v). Because s_v <= s_u. But when processing u, we need to set s_u to a value between l_u and r_u, and also s_u must be >= the maximum of the s_v of all children. So s_u can be in [max(l_u, max_children_s_v), min(r_u, s_p(u))]. But s_p(u) is the parent's sum, which hasn't been processed yet. So during processing u, the minimal possible s_p(u) is s_u. Because s_p(u) must be >= s_u. Therefore, when processing u, we need to set s_u as large as possible (up to r_u) to minimize the required s_p(u). Because a larger s_u allows s_p(u) to be larger, which could help satisfy the constraints of higher nodes. So for each node u, the maximum possible s_u is min(r_u, s_p(u)), but since we want to maximize s_u, we set s_u = min(r_u, s_p(u)). However, since s_p(u) is processed later, we can't know it.",

The delta is l[i] - dp[i].\n\n   k += 1.\n\n   dp[i] += delta (now dp[i] = l[i]). then, since this operation contributes delta to all ancestors of i, we add delta to the parent's dp. So, we do something like dp[pp[i]] += delta. But wait, the parent's dp is initially 0. For example, in the first sample:\n\nAfter processing node 1 (the child), dp[1] is 0. l[1] is 2, so delta is 2-0=2. k increases by 1. dp[1] becomes 2. Then, the parent (node 0) has dp[0] += delta (2). So dp[0] becomes 2. Then, when processing node 0, l[0] is 1, and dp[0] is 2 >= 1. So no operation is needed. The total k is 1.\n\nWhich matches the first sample. In the second sample:\n\nProcessing nodes 2, 1, 0. Node 2 has l=7. dp[2] is 0. Delta is 7-0=7. k=1. dp[2] =7. Parent is 1, so dp[1] +=7 (now 7).

So nothing changes. Then, the parent of node1 is 0. So during node1's processing, since no operation was needed, delta is 0. So dp[0] +=0.

Hmm, this approach is not working. Ah, because node0's r is5. So the sum for node0 must be <=5. But the current approach would set dp[0] to 7, which exceeds r[0]=5. Ah, right! So the code's approach must also ensure that the sum does not exceed r[i]. So the algorithm must not only check if the current sum is below l[i], but also ensure that the sum is <= r[i].

So dp[i] is the sum of deltas from its children. But after adding deltas, we need to ensure that s_i does not exceed r_i. So s_i = min(r_i, dp[i]). If this s_i is < l_i, then we need to add an additional delta of (l_i - s_i), which requires a new operation. This delta is added to s_i and to the parent's dp. But this seems like the correct approach. So the steps are: For each node i processed in post-order:\n\n   s_i = min(r_i, dp[i]). if s_i < l_i:\n\n      delta = l_i - s_i.\n\n      k +=1.\n\n      s_i += delta. parent = pp[i]. if parent >=0:\n\n          dp[parent] += delta.\n\n   else:\n\n      s_i = min(r_i, dp[i]).\n\n   dp[i] = s_i. But how is this tracked in the code's dp array? The code's dp array is initialized to 0. For each node i, when processed, the dp[i] contains the sum of deltas from its children. Then, the code computes the maximum possible s_i as min(r_i, dp[i]). If this is less than l_i, we need to add a delta of l_i - s_i.",

But in the first sample:\n\nTest case1:\n\nnode0: l=1, r=1.\n\nnode1: l=2, r=2. Processing node1:\n\ndp[1]=0. s_i = min(2,0) =0 <2. delta=2. k=1. parent is0. dp[0] +=2. So dp[0] is 2. Processing node0:\n\ns_i = min(1,2) =1. 1 >=1. No operation. k remains1. dp[0] is set to1. Thus, correct. This approach seems correct. So the code's missing code would be:\n\ns_i = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\n\nif (s_i < ll[i]) {\n\n   delta = ll[i] - s_i;\n\n   k++;\n\n   s_i += delta;\n\n   if (pp[i] >=0) { // if not root\n\n       dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\ndp[i] = s_i;\n\nBut in the code, pp is the array of parents for i >=1 (since pp is read as p_2 to p_n). For node0, which is the root, pp[0] is not set. But in the code, the nodes are processed from 0 to n-1. Wait, no. The code's pp array is for i=1 to n-1. For example, for n=3, pp[0] is not used. Because pp is read as p_2, p_3. So for node i (0-based), the parent is pp[i] for i >=1. For node0, which is the root, there is no parent. So during the processing of nodei, pp[i] is only valid for i >=1. Thus, in the code, for i >=1, pp[i] is the parent's index (0-based). Thus, the code for the missing part would be:\n\nlong long s = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\n\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n\n    long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n\n    k++;\n\n    s += delta; if (i > 0) {\n\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\ndp[i] = s; But wait, in the code, the pp array is stored for i=1 to n-1. For example, pp[i] for i=1 to n-1. So for node i (0-based), when i is 0, there is no parent. For i >=1, the parent is pp[i]. But in the code's reading:\n\nfor (i = 1; i < n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &pp[i]), pp[i]--; So pp[1] is p_2's parent minus 1. For example, if the input is p_2=1, then pp[1] =0. Thus, for node i (1-based in input), pp[i-1] is the parent index (0-based) in code. Wait, no. Let's see: In the code, for i from 1 to n-1:\n\npp[i] is read, and then decremented by 1. For example, in the first sample:\n\nn=2. The input is p_2 =1. So pp[1] is read as1, then pp[1] becomes0. Thus, for node 1 (code's index), pp[1] is0, which is the parent of node1 (code's index 1). So for code's nodei (i >=1), pp[i] is the parent's code index. Thus, in the code, for nodei (i >=0), the parent is pp[i] if i >=1. So during processing nodei:\n\nif i >0, then pp[i] is the parent's index. Thus, the code for the missing part would be:\n\nlong long s = min((long long)rr[i], dp[i]);\n\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n\n    long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n\n    k++;\n\n    s += delta; if (i != 0) {\n\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\ndp[i] = s; Yes. Because for the root (i=0), there's no parent. For other nodes (i>0), the parent is pp[i]. Thus, the missing code is:\n\ns = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n    delta = ll[i] - s;\n    k++;\n    s += delta; if (i != 0) {\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n    }\n}\ndp[i] = s;\n\nSo, the code inside the loop for i from n-1 downto 0 is:\n\nlong long s = ll[i] > dp[i] ? min(rr[i], dp[i]) : min(rr[i], dp[i]);\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n    long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n    k++;\n    s += delta; if (i != 0) {\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n    }\n}\ndp[i] = s; Wait, but calculating s as min(rr[i], dp[i]) is correct. Thus, the code is:\n\nfor (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    long long s = dp[i] < ll[i] ? ll[i] : (dp[i] > rr[i] ? rr[i] : dp[i]);\n    // Or more simply: s = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\n    // Because s = min(rr[i], dp[i]) and then check if s < ll[i]\n    s = min((long long)rr[i], dp[i]);\n    if (s < ll[i]) {\n        long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n        k++;\n        s += delta;\n        if (i != 0) {\n            dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n        }\n    }\n    dp[i] = s;\n}\n\nThis should handle all cases. Thus, the missing code is the block where for each node i, compute s as the minimum of rr[i] and dp[i].",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. We need to find the minimum number of operations required to adjust all nodes in the tree such that each node's value a_v is within its [l_v, r_v] range. The operations involve selecting a path from root to a node and adding a non-decreasing array of increments along that path. Each operation can affect multiple nodes along the path, but the increments must be non-decreasing.\n\nHmm. The key is to model how these operations can be optimally applied. Since each operation contributes to a path from root to some node, and the increments are non-decreasing, perhaps we can process the tree in a way that tracks the required increments for each node, considering their constraints.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to some kind of greedy approach. Let's think about the constraints. For each node, after all operations, a_v must be between l_v and r_v. Each operation affects a path, so the sum of the increments from all operations along the path must meet these constraints.\n\nBut since the operations are additive, the total sum for each node is the sum of all c_i's from the paths that include it. But each c_i in an operation's array is non-decreasing along the path. So, for any node, the sum of c_i's along its path in each operation must be such that the total a_v is within [l_v, r_v].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by working from the leaves up to the root. Because each node's constraints might influence the required operations for its subtree.\n\nLooking at the code skeleton provided: they are processing nodes in reverse order (from n-1 down to 0). And there's a dp array involved. Also, the variable k is the answer, which gets printed for each test case.\n\nSo perhaps the solution involves dynamic programming. The idea is that for each node, we determine the minimal number of operations needed for its subtree, considering the constraints and how operations can be merged or overlapped.\n\nWait, the code uses a loop starting at i = n-1 down to 0. Since the nodes are numbered from 0 (assuming 0-based index here?), or maybe they are 1-based but converted to 0-based. Let's check the input part: the code reads p_i and subtracts 1, so the parents are 0-based indices.\n\nSo the tree is stored with 0-based indices. For each node i (from 0 to n-1), the code reads ll[i] and rr[i], which are the l and r constraints.\n\nThe approach seems to process nodes in reverse order, which might correspond to processing from leaves up to the root.\n\nLet's think about each node. For a node, the sum of all the contributions to its a_v comes from operations that include any of its ancestors (including itself). So the path for any operation is from the root to some node, and the increments along that path are non-decreasing.\n\nThe minimal number of operations would depend on how these increments can be combined. For example, if two nodes along a path require certain increments, maybe a single operation can cover both if their constraints allow a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think recursively. For a node u, the constraints are l_u <= a_u <= r_u. The a_u is the sum of all c_i's along paths that include u. Each c_i in an operation's array must be non-decreasing along the path from root to the chosen node.\n\nWait, in an operation, when you choose a path to node v, the c array must be non-decreasing. So for the nodes on the path (b_1, b_2, ..., b_k), c_1 <= c_2 <= ... <= c_k. Each of these nodes gets their a increased by c_i. So, when you apply multiple operations, the sum of all the c_i's for each node must result in a total between l and r.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe for each node, the required total increment (the sum of c_i's from all operations that include it) must be at least l_i and at most r_i.\n\nBut since the operations are additive, and each operation's increments are non-decreasing along the path, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the nodes that require the most \"steps\" in their path.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the required increments for the path from root to it must form a non-decreasing sequence. But how can we model the minimal operations needed to cover all nodes.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be viewed as follows: Each operation corresponds to a path (root to some node) and a non-decreasing array. The sum of all such arrays' entries along each node's path must be between l and r. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations to achieve this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model for each node the required increments from its parent. Since the increments along the path must be non-decreasing, the increment for a node cannot be less than that of its parent. Therefore, for a node u, the sum of increments in the path to u must be >= the sum in its parent.\n\nWait, perhaps each operation's contribution to a node must be >= the contribution to its parent. Because in any operation that includes u, the c_i for u (which is in the path) must be >= the c_i for the parent.\n\nBut since the sum across multiple operations can be any combination, perhaps the sum of all c_i's for u must be >= the sum of all c_i's for the parent. Because each individual operation's contribution to u is >= the contribution to the parent.\n\nYes, because for each operation that includes u, when you select a path that includes u (since u is in the path), the c array is non-decreasing. So for that operation, the contribution to u (c_k) is >= the contribution to its parent (c_{k-1}), which is part of the same operation. However, if the same node is part of multiple operations, each of those contributes a c value that is >= the c values of their parents in their respective operations.\n\nBut the total sum for a node u is the sum of all c's from operations that include u. Let's denote s_u as the total sum for u. Then, s_u must be >= l_u and <= r_u. Moreover, for any node u, s_u must be >= s_p(u), where p(u) is the parent. Because each time u is part of an operation's path, its c_i is >= the parent's c_i in that operation. Summing over all operations, s_u is the sum of all c_i for u's position in each path, which must be >= sum of all c_i for the parent's position in each such path, which is s_p(u).\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because each time u is included in a path (as part of an operation), the c_i for u is >= the c_i for p(u) in that same operation. Therefore, the total sum s_u is the sum of all such c_i's for u, which is >= sum of c_i's for p(u) in those same operations. But p(u) could be included in more operations than u. Wait, no. Because if u is part of an operation's path, then p(u) is also part of that path. So any operation that includes u must include p(u) as well. Therefore, for each operation that includes u, p(u) is included, and the c_i for u in that operation is >= the c_i for p(u) in that same operation. Therefore, the sum s_u is equal to the sum over all operations that include u of their c_i for u. Similarly, s_p(u) is the sum over all operations that include p(u) of their c_i for p(u). But any operation that includes u must include p(u), so those operations contribute to both s_u and s_p(u). But the operations that include p(u) but not u (like operations whose path ends at a sibling of u) will contribute to s_p(u) but not to s_u. So s_u could be less than s_p(u) if there are operations that contribute to p(u) but not u. But that's impossible, because for those operations that don't include u, their c_i for p(u) could be any value, but for the operations that include u, their c_i for u is >= their c_i for p(u). So in the sum s_p(u), there are contributions from operations that include u (which have c_i for p(u) <= c_i for u in those operations) and operations that don't include u (which have no relation to u). Therefore, s_p(u) can be larger than s_u. But according to the problem's constraints, the final a_v must be between l_v and r_v, but there's no explicit requirement that a_v >= a_p(v). Wait, but the problem doesn't require the a_v's to form a non-decreasing sequence. Only that each a_v is within [l_v, r_v]. So perhaps the earlier conclusion was wrong.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any sequence of operations. The a_v's can be anything as long as they are within their [l, r] ranges. The only constraints are on the operations' structure. But in each operation, the c array is non-decreasing. So the sum of all operations' contributions to a node u must be such that, for each operation that includes u, the c_i for u is >= the c_i for p(u) in that same operation. But across multiple operations, this does not impose a direct relation between the total sum s_u and s_p(u). Because in one operation, the c_i for u could be 2 and p(u) could be 1, and in another operation, the c_i for u could be 1 and p(u) could be 3. Wait, but in that case, the sum for p(u) is 1+3=4 and for u is 2+1=3, which would be s_p(u) =4 and s_u=3, which is s_p(u) > s_u. But the problem allows this, as the constraints on a_v are just their ranges. So there's no inherent requirement that s_u >= s_p(u). But each individual operation's contribution to u's path must be non-decreasing. So the sum of all contributions for u can be anything, as long as each operation's contribution is non-decreasing along the path. But that's allowed. So the total sum for u can be less than that of p(u), as long as each operation's individual contributions along the path are non-decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach was incorrect. So the sum s_u can be anything as long as each operation's c array for the path is non-decreasing. So there's no global requirement that s_u >= s_p(u). But each operation's contribution must have c_i's that are non-decreasing along the path.\n\nBut how to model this. Since the sum of all operations' contributions to each node must be within [l, r], but each operation's c array must be non-decreasing along the path. So each individual operation's c array must be non-decreasing. But when you combine multiple operations, the sum can be anything.\n\nSo the minimal number of operations is determined by how to cover the required increments in a way that each operation's c array is non-decreasing and the sum for each node is within [l, r].\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of each node's required increments. For example, each operation contributes some amount to the nodes along a path. The sum of these contributions must meet each node's l and r constraints.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimal number of operations.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved greedily by processing the tree in a bottom-up manner. For each node, determine the minimal number of operations needed to cover its constraints, considering the constraints of its children.\n\nWait, the code's existing structure processes the nodes in reverse order (i from n-1 down to 0). So perhaps the nodes are processed in reverse order of their numbering. But the way the tree is structured, the root is 0 (since the parents are given as 0-based in the code). So processing from leaves upwards.\n\nThe code has a DP array. So the DP[i] might represent some value related to the minimal increments required for the subtree rooted at i, or the minimal operations needed up to that node.\n\nThe solution probably involves for each node, tracking the maximum possible sum that can be achieved for that node given the constraints, and the minimal number of operations required. Because when you process a node, you need to ensure that the sum for that node is within [l, r], and that the sum for its children (if any) do not require more operations than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the DP[i] might track the maximum possible a_i that can be achieved with the current number of operations, such that all descendants of i are satisfied. Or perhaps it's tracking the minimal required increments.\n\nLet's look at the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\nn=2\np_2 is 1 (but in code, p[1] is 0 after decrementing)\nnodes 0 and 1:\nnode 0's l and r: 1 and 1 (since in sample input 1, after the first test case, l_1=1, r_1=1 (assuming 0-based?), but the actual sample input says:\n\nSample Input 1:\n1\n2\n1\n1 1\n2 2\n\nWait, the code reads for the nodes 0 to n-1 (since the loop for i from 0 to n-1 for l and r). So in the first test case:\n\nn=2, so nodes 0 and 1.\n\np_2 is given as 1 (since the input is p_2, p_3, etc.), which in code is stored as p[1] =1-1=0. So node 1's parent is 0.\n\nThen, l and r for node 0 (which is root) are 1 and 1, and for node 1 (child of 0) are 2 and 2.\n\nSo in the sample, the solution is to apply one operation on the path to node 1 (0 and 1), with c=[1,2], which gives a_0=1, a_1=2.\n\nSo the sum for the root is 1 (from c_1=1 in the operation), and for the child it's 2 (from c_2=2). The c array is non-decreasing (1 <= 2), so it's valid.\n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is 1.\n\nIn the sample, the code's answer k is 1.\n\nThe problem's key insight is that each operation can contribute to multiple nodes along a path, and the non-decreasing nature of the increments in each operation's c array allows us to model the required steps in a way that higher nodes (closer to the root) can accumulate their required increments through overlapping operations.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother sample: the second test case.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nParents of 2 and 3: 1 and 2. Wait, the input is p_2, p_3. So the code reads p_2 as 1 (so node 1's parent is 0), p_3 as 2 (so node 2's parent is 1).\n\nSo the tree is 0 ->1 ->2.\n\nThe l and r for the nodes are:\n\nnode 0: l=5, r=5.\n\nnode 1: l=3, r=3.\n\nnode 2: l=7, r=7.\n\nThe solution requires two operations.\n\nFirst, choose v=2 (node 1 in code, since code is 0-based?), path is 0,1. Then choose c=[3,3], sum for node 0 is 3, node 1 is 3. Then choose v=3 (node 2), path is 0,1,2. Choose c=[2,7,7]. Wait, no. Wait in the sample explanation, after first operation, a_1 (node 0) is 3, a_2 (node1) is 3. Then, second operation is choosing v=3 (node2), c=[2,7]. So the path is 0,1,2. But the c array must be non-decreasing. So [2,7,7] would be allowed. Then sum for node0 is 3+2=5, node1 is 3+7=10? Wait, but that's not matching the sample explanation.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's 0-based indices are causing confusion. Let me re-examine the sample explanation.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\nThen three lines of l and r:\n\n5 5 (for node 1, but code uses 0-based, so node 0's l=5, r=5)\n\n3 3 (node1)\n\n7 7 (node2)\n\nThen the sample explanation says first choose v=2 (code's node1) and c = [3,3]. So the path is nodes 0 and 1. Then a_0=3, a_1=3, a_2=0. Then choose v=3 (node2 in input, code's node2) and c=[2,7]. Wait, but the path for node2 is 0,1,2. So the c array must be length 3, but the sample says [2,7]. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the code's input is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the sample explanation, the first operation's v is 2 (node2 in input), which is code's node1 (since the input is p_2=1, which becomes code's p[1] =0). Wait, perhaps the code's nodes are 0-based, so the root is 0, and the input's node 2 is code's node1. So in the first sample, the input's node2 is code's node1.\n\nWait, in the code, the parents are read for p_2, p_3, ..., p_n, which are stored in pp[1], pp[2], ..., pp[n-1]. For example, in test case 2, the parent array is [1, 2]. So pp[1] is 1-1=0 (parent of node1 is 0), pp[2] is 2-1=1 (parent of node2 is 1). So the tree is 0->1->2.\n\nSample explanation for test case2:\n\nFirst operation: choose v=2 (input's node2, which is code's node1). Path is 0,1. So c is [3,3]. a_0 becomes 3, a_1 becomes 3.\n\nSecond operation: choose v=3 (input's node3, code's node2). Path is 0,1,2. c array is [2,7, something]. Wait, but the sample explanation says the c array is [2,7]. But that's length 2. So perhaps a typo. Or maybe the sample explanation is using different 1-based indices.\n\nBut regardless, the key is that the code's logic must process the tree from leaves up, tracking some constraints.\n\nThe idea is that for each node, we need to find the minimal number of operations required to cover its subtree's constraints, considering that each operation can contribute to multiple nodes along a path.\n\nThe DP approach likely tracks for each node the minimal required operations and the maximum possible value that can be contributed to that node. Because when processing a node, we need to ensure that the sum of the increments along its path (from root) can be adjusted to meet the l and r constraints, and that the parent nodes' increments are <= the current node's increments in each operation.\n\nWait, but each operation's c array is non-decreasing. So when we apply an operation on a path that includes node u and its parent p, the contribution to u (c_i) must be >= the contribution to p (c_{i-1}).\n\nSo for the cumulative sum of all operations, each operation's contribution to u must be >= the contribution to p in that same operation. Therefore, the sum for u's total increments (s_u) is the sum of all c_i for u in the operations that include u. Similarly for p. But s_u is not necessarily >= s_p, because the operations that include p but not u can contribute to s_p but not to s_u. So s_p could be larger than s_u.\n\nBut this complicates the model. How can we find the minimal number of operations to cover all the constraints?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach node u has a required range [l_u, r_u]. The sum of the increments for u from all operations must be in this range. Each operation can be any path from root to a node, with non-decreasing c array.\n\nThe minimal number of operations is determined by the nodes that require the most \"steps\" in their path. For example, a leaf node may require multiple operations along its path to meet its constraints, and each of these operations can also contribute to the nodes higher up in the path.\n\nBut how to model this. Perhaps for each node, we need to track the maximum allowable contribution from the current operations to its ancestors. For example, if a node requires a certain amount of increments, the increments for its parent in the same operation must be <= the node's increment.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nLooking back at the code skeleton. The code processes the nodes in reverse order (from n-1 to 0). For each node i, it's doing something with the DP array. The k variable is the answer, which is the minimal number of operations.\n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nread n.\n\nread p_2, p_3,... p_n (0-based parents).\n\nread l_i and r_i for each node.\n\ninitialize dp array to 0.\n\nk =0.\n\nloop i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   ... code here ...\n\nthen print k.\n\nSo for each node i (processed in reverse order, perhaps from leaves up to root), the code updates the dp array and k.\n\nSo the key is that each node's processing is in post-order, so children are processed before their parents.\n\nSo the DP[i] likely represents the maximum possible sum that can be allocated to node i given the constraints of its children, and the number of operations needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: when you process a node, you can accumulate the necessary operations from its children. If a node's required range is such that its minimum is higher than the sum of what can be provided by the parent's operations, you need to perform additional operations that cover this node's path.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's think of each node u. Its sum s_u must be >= l_u and <= r_u. Also, the sum s_u must be achievable through some operations that include u. Each such operation's contribution to u must be >= the contribution to its parent in that operation.\n\nBut when processing the nodes in reverse order (children first), for each node u, the required sum for u depends on the sum of its parent.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u, after processing all its children, we can determine the maximum and minimum sum that can be assigned to u, given the constraints of its children.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose for each node u, after processing its subtree, we track the maximum possible sum s_u that can be achieved with the current number of operations. We want s_u to be as large as possible (within [l_u, r_u]) to minimize the number of operations required for the parent nodes.\n\nBecause if s_u is larger, the parent can have a smaller s_p (since in the operations that include the parent and u, the parent's contribution is <= u's). So by maximizing s_u, we allow more flexibility for the parent's sum.\n\nSo, for each node u:\n\nThe sum s_u must be in [l_u, r_u]. However, since the parent's sum s_p must be <= s_u (no, wait, no: each operation that includes u also includes p(u), and in that operation, the contribution to u is >= contribution to p(u). So the sum s_u is the sum of all contributions to u across all operations that include u. s_p(u) is the sum of contributions to p(u) across all operations that include p(u). But some operations include p(u) but not u (like operations on siblings of u). So s_p(u) can be larger than s_u. So there's no requirement that s_p(u) <= s_u.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So the parent's sum can be larger than the child's sum, as long as each individual operation's contribution to the child (if included) is >= the contribution to the parent.\n\nBut how to model this. It's possible for a parent to have a higher sum than a child if some operations contribute to the parent but not the child.\n\nBut in this case, the child's sum is the sum of all operations that include the child's path (i.e., operations on the child or any of its descendants). So the parent's sum includes all operations that include the parent (which includes all operations that include the child, plus any operations that include the parent but not the child).\n\nTherefore, s_p(u) = sum of contributions from all operations that include p(u), which includes all operations that include u (since p(u) is on the path to u) plus any operations that end at p(u) or any other sibling of u.\n\nBut the sum s_p(u) could be greater than s_u, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the key is to determine the minimal number of operations such that each node's sum is in [l, r], and each operation's c array is non-decreasing.\n\nBut how to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nThe code's approach uses a dp array. Let's assume that dp[i] represents the maximum possible sum that can be assigned to node i, given the operations chosen so far, and the constraints of the subtree rooted at i.\n\nWhen processing a node i, we want to set dp[i] to the minimum of r[i] and the sum of the contributions from its children. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps dp[i] represents the minimal number of operations needed for the subtree rooted at i, and some other parameter (like the maximum possible sum that can be achieved for i with those operations).\n\nBut the code's dp array is of type long long, which suggests it's storing the maximum possible sum, and k is the number of operations.\n\nWait, in the code's existing loop, after processing all children of node i, they update the DP for node i. The variable k is the answer, which is the minimal number of operations.\n\nLet me think of the first sample. After processing node 1 (the child), then processing node 0 (root). For the root, the required l is 1, r is 1. The child's l and r are 2 and 2.\n\nThe code's DP for node 1 (processed first) would set dp[1] to 2. Then, for node 0, since the parent's required sum is 1, which is <= 2 (child's dp), but the parent's required sum is 1. So perhaps the code would merge these into one operation.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of nodes where the required l_i exceeds the maximum sum that can be passed down from the parent. But this is vague.\n\nWait, looking for hints from the code:\n\nThe code's main loop is:\n\nfor (i = n-1; i >=0; i--) {\n\n   // code here\n\n}\n\nSo nodes are processed from last to first. So in 0-based, node 0 is the root. The loop starts from the highest index (n-1) down to 0. So the root is processed last.\n\nThe variables involved are the dp array and k.\n\nSo for each node i, during processing, we might accumulate some information into dp[i] and possibly increment k.\n\nThe sample code's approach might be based on the following idea: for each node, the required sum must be at least l_i. But the sum can't exceed r_i. However, when processing the node, the sum allocated to the node must be at least the sum allocated to its children. Wait, but earlier analysis suggests this is not required. However, the code might model it this way as a heuristic.\n\nAlternatively, the dp[i] represents the maximum sum that can be allocated to node i, given the current number of operations. When processing node i, we need to ensure that this sum is >= the sum of all its children's required minima, but also <= r_i.\n\nBut perhaps the code is using the following approach:\n\nFor each node i:\n\nCompute the maximum sum that can be allocated to i, which is the minimum between r_i and the sum of the required sums of its children. But this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, during processing, the code may track for each node i the sum of the current maximum possible values for its children. Then, the required sum for node i must be at least the maximum of its children's required sums, but this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the code may use a greedy approach where for each node i, the minimal number of operations is the number of times that the required increments for the node's path can't be covered by previous operations.\n\nWait, perhaps each node i has a required increment that must be at least l_i. But when processing the node, if the current accumulated sum (from previous operations) is less than l_i, we need to perform additional operations that cover this node's path, which will contribute to the sum of this node and all ancestors.\n\nBut since each operation's contribution is non-decreasing along the path, each new operation can contribute at least as much to the node as to its parent. So, when adding an operation for a node, we can increase the node's sum and the sums of all ancestors by a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nTo minimize the number of operations, it's optimal to maximize the increments added in each operation. So for each node, we need to cover the deficit between the current sum and the required minimum l_i, and do this in a way that also covers the ancestors.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe code's approach is probably as follows:\n\nWe process nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node, we track the maximum possible sum that can be allocated to it (up to r_i). If the maximum possible sum is less than l_i, then we need to perform an operation that increases the sum of this node and its ancestors. The number of such operations is tracked by k.\n\nThe dp array for a node i represents the maximum sum that can be allocated to i after processing its children. The sum of the node i's children may influence the required sum for i.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nFor each node i, after processing all its children, compute the minimum required sum for i. The required sum is the maximum between its own l_i and the sum of the required sums of its children. Because, for example, the sum for the parent must be at least the sum of the children to allow the non-decreasing increments in each operation.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because the sum of the parent can be less than the sum of the child, as long as each operation's contribution to the child is >= the parent's contribution in that same operation.\n\nBut in the sum, the parent's sum can be less than the child's sum if there are operations that contribute to the child but not the parent. Wait, no. Because any operation that contributes to the child must include the parent. So any operation that contributes to the child's sum also contributes to the parent's sum. Therefore, the parent's sum is the sum of all operations that include any node in the parent's subtree. So the parent's sum is at least the sum of all operations that contribute to its children.\n\nWait, no. For example, if you have two children of a parent. An operation can be done on one child's path, contributing to the parent and that child. Another operation can be done on the other child's path. So the parent's sum is the sum of both operations' contributions, while each child's sum is the sum of their own operations. Therefore, the parent's sum is the sum of all operations that pass through it, which includes all operations for both children and any operations that end at the parent or its ancestors.\n\nTherefore, the parent's sum is >= the sum of each child's sum. Because each child's sum is the sum of operations that include their own paths (which includes the parent), but the parent's sum includes all operations that include any path passing through it, which includes all operations for all children plus any other operations that end at the parent or its ancestors.\n\nWait, no. Suppose we have a parent node P and two children C1 and C2. Each operation on C1's path contributes to P and C1. Each operation on C2's path contributes to P and C2. The sum for P is the sum of all operations on C1's path plus all operations on C2's path plus any operations that end at P or higher. The sum for C1 is the sum of all operations on C1's path. The sum for C2 is the sum of all operations on C2's path. So P's sum is sum_C1_ops + sum_C2_ops + sum_other_ops. C1's sum is sum_C1_ops. So P's sum is greater than or equal to C1's sum and C2's sum.\n\nTherefore, for any node u, s_p(u) >= s_u. Because s_p(u) includes all operations that contribute to u, plus possibly more.\n\nAh! This is a key insight. Because any operation that contributes to u's sum must also contribute to p(u)'s sum, the parent's sum is at least the child's sum. So s_p(u) >= s_u.\n\nTherefore, for each node u, the sum s_u must be <= s_p(u).\n\nBut the problem requires that s_u >= l_u and s_u <= r_u, and s_p(u) >= s_u.\n\nSo for each node u, the sum s_u must satisfy:\n\nl_u <= s_u <= min(r_u, s_p(u)).\n\nBut since s_p(u) is the sum of all operations that include p(u), which includes all operations contributing to u, s_p(u) is >= s_u. So the upper bound for s_u is min(r_u, s_p(u)).\n\nBut how to model this when processing nodes from leaves up.\n\nThe algorithm would process nodes in post-order (children before parents). For each node u:\n\nThe sum s_u must be between l_u and r_u.\n\nBut the sum s_u can be at most s_p(u), which is processed after u.\n\nBut when processing u, the parent hasn't been processed yet. So this complicates the model.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to track for each node u the maximum possible s_u that can be achieved, which is min(r_u, s_p(u)). But since the parent is processed after u, how can we model s_p(u) when processing u?\n\nAh, this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the solution is to determine for each node u the minimal required s_p(u) that allows s_u to be within [l_u, r_u]. Then, when processing the parent p(u), we can ensure that s_p(u) is at least the maximum of the required s_u's of all its children.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Process nodes in post-order (children before parents).\n\n2. For each node u, compute the minimal required s_p(u) to satisfy s_u >= l_u. Since s_p(u) >= s_u, we have s_u >= l_u implies s_p(u) >= l_u. But to have s_u >= l_u, s_p(u) must be >= s_u >= l_u. So the minimal s_p(u) is max(s_p(u), l_u).\n\nWait, perhaps for each node u, the required s_p(u) must be >= s_u. And s_u must be >= l_u, s_u <= r_u.\n\nBut when processing u, since p(u) is processed after u, we can compute the required minimal s_p(u) to ensure that s_u can be set to a value between l_u and r_u.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in reverse. Suppose we have processed all children of node u. Each child v of u requires that s_u >= s_v (since u is the parent of v). Because s_v <= s_u.\n\nBut when processing u, we need to set s_u to a value between l_u and r_u, and also s_u must be >= the maximum of the s_v of all children.\n\nSo s_u can be in [max(l_u, max_children_s_v), min(r_u, s_p(u))].\n\nBut s_p(u) is the parent's sum, which hasn't been processed yet.\n\nSo during processing u, the minimal possible s_p(u) is s_u. Because s_p(u) must be >= s_u.\n\nTherefore, when processing u, we need to set s_u as large as possible (up to r_u) to minimize the required s_p(u). Because a larger s_u allows s_p(u) to be larger, which could help satisfy the constraints of higher nodes.\n\nSo for each node u, the maximum possible s_u is min(r_u, s_p(u)), but since we want to maximize s_u, we set s_u = min(r_u, s_p(u)). However, since s_p(u) is processed later, we can't know it. Therefore, when processing u, we set s_u to the minimum between r_u and the minimal required s_p(u) (which we can't know yet). This seems circular.\n\nBut perhaps during processing u, the code computes the required s_p(u) as at least the maximum of the s_v of all children and l_u. Wait, no. Because s_p(u) is the parent of u's sum, not u's parent.\n\nWait, for node u, its parent is p(u). So s_p(u) is the sum of the parent node. Therefore, when processing u, the parent node hasn't been processed yet. So how can we compute s_p(u)?\n\nThis suggests that the code must process the nodes in a way that allows the parent to be processed after the children. So during processing of the parent, we can adjust the parent's sum based on the children's requirements.\n\nThe key insight is that for node u, the parent's sum s_p(u) must be >= s_u. Therefore, when processing node u, the maximum possible s_u is min(r_u, s_p(u)), but since s_p(u) is processed later, we can't determine it. Therefore, we must set s_u to be as large as possible (within r_u) and the parent's sum must be >= s_u.\n\nBut during processing the parent of u, we need to ensure that the parent's sum is >= the maximum of all children's s_u.\n\nTherefore, for each node u, when processing its parent p(u), the parent's sum s_p(u) must be >= the maximum s_u of all its children. This way, each child's s_u is <= s_p(u).\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Process nodes in post-order (children before parents).\n\n2. For each node u, calculate the required minimal s_p(u) as the maximum between l_u and the maximum s_v of all children of u (since s_u must be >= l_u and >= s_v for all children v).\n\nWait, no. Because s_u is the sum for node u, which must be >= l_u and <= r_u. Also, s_p(u) (the parent's sum) must be >= s_u.\n\nBut during processing node u, we can't know s_p(u), so we need to set s_u as large as possible (to minimize the required s_p(u)). Therefore, we set s_u to the maximum possible value, which is r_u. However, we must also ensure that the parent's sum s_p(u) is at least s_u. So when processing the parent p(u), we must set its sum to be at least the maximum s_u among all its children.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each node u (processed in post-order):\n\n- Compute the required minimum sum for u's parent. This required minimum is the maximum of all s_u of the children of the parent.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by looking at existing code:\n\nThe code uses a variable k, which is the minimal number of operations. The dp array likely tracks the maximum possible sum that can be achieved for each node given the current number of operations.\n\nWhen processing a node, if the current maximum sum (from dp[i]) is less than the node's l_i, then we need to perform an operation that increases the sum along the path to this node. The number of operations is increased by 1, and the dp values for the ancestors are updated.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: each time we need to add an operation for a node, the operation's c array must be non-decreasing. The operation contributes to the node and all its ancestors. To maximize the efficiency of each operation, we set the c array to be as large as possible at the node and non-decreasing up the path.\n\nBut since the c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to the node is the largest in the path. So to cover the deficit between the current sum and the required l_i, we can perform an operation that adds exactly (l_i - current_sum) to the node, and this value must be >= the contributions to the ancestors.\n\nBut this may require that the contributions to the ancestors are <= (l_i - current_sum). So for each ancestor, the contribution in this operation is the minimum between their possible deficit and the current operation's contribution.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, when you perform an operation on node u, you can set the contributions along the path such that the c_i for u is as large as needed to cover the deficit. Then, the contributions to the ancestors are <= c_i. To cover the deficit in one operation, you can set c_i for u to be (required) and for each ancestor in the path, c_i can be any value <= c_i of u, but ideally, to maximize their contribution, you set c_i for ancestors to be the same as c_i of u, thus allowing their sum to be increased as much as possible.\n\nThis way, each operation for node u contributes the maximum possible to all ancestors, thus reducing the need for future operations.\n\nSo for each node u, when the current sum is below l_u, we perform an operation that sets the sum of u to at least l_u. The number of operations is incremented by 1. The contribution to u and all ancestors is the maximum possible (the deficit for u) in a non-decreasing way. This is done by setting c_i for each ancestor to the same value as for u. So the c array is [x, x, ..., x], where x is the amount needed to reach l_u.\n\nBut this may not be sufficient if the parent's required sum is higher.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, this seems to be the optimal way to minimize the number of operations.\n\nThus, the algorithm would process each node in post-order. For each node u:\n\n- The maximum possible sum (dp[u]) is initially 0.\n\n- If dp[u] < l_u, then we need to perform an operation. The amount needed is delta = l_u - dp[u].\n\n- We perform one operation, which adds delta to u and all its ancestors. The contributions to each ancestor are at least delta (since the c array is non-decreasing). But to maximize the contribution, we can set all contributions in this operation to delta. So the sum for u becomes dp[u] + delta = l_u. The sum for each ancestor is increased by delta.\n\n- The number of operations k is incremented by 1.\n\n- For each ancestor of u, their dp values are increased by delta. But this is not feasible for large trees, as there could be O(n) ancestors per node.\n\nTherefore, this approach is not efficient for large n.\n\nThus, there must be a smarter way to track the required increments without explicitly updating each ancestor.\n\nThe code's solution must be using the dp array in a way that accumulates the required contributions without explicitly iterating through the ancestors for each node.\n\nThe key is to realize that when you perform an operation on a node u, the contribution to u is delta, and the contribution to its parent p(u) is delta as well. However, when processing nodes from leaves up, the parent's required contribution can be handled when the parent is processed.\n\nSo, for each node u, after processing all children, we compute the required delta for u. This delta is the maximum between 0 and (l_u - current dp[u]).\n\nThis delta is added to the parent's dp value. But how?\n\nWait, in the code's existing structure, the code processes each node in reverse order. For each node i, during processing, it's possible to update the dp[pp[i]] (the parent's dp value) by adding some delta.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFor each node i:\n\n   if the current dp[i] is less than l[i], we need to perform an operation. The delta is l[i] - dp[i].\n\n   k += 1.\n\n   dp[i] += delta (now dp[i] = l[i]).\n\n   then, since this operation contributes delta to all ancestors of i, we add delta to the parent's dp.\n\n   So, we do something like dp[pp[i]] += delta.\n\nBut wait, the parent's dp is initially 0. For example, in the first sample:\n\nAfter processing node 1 (the child), dp[1] is 0. l[1] is 2, so delta is 2-0=2. k increases by 1. dp[1] becomes 2. Then, the parent (node 0) has dp[0] += delta (2). So dp[0] becomes 2. Then, when processing node 0, l[0] is 1, and dp[0] is 2 >= 1. So no operation is needed. The total k is 1.\n\nWhich matches the first sample.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nProcessing nodes 2, 1, 0.\n\nNode 2 has l=7. dp[2] is 0. Delta is 7-0=7. k=1. dp[2] =7. Parent is 1, so dp[1] +=7 (now 7).\n\nNode 1's l is 3. dp[1] is 7 >=3. So no operation. Then parent is 0, but node 1's processing doesn't change anything.\n\nNode 0's l is5. dp[0] is 0 + 7 (from node2's delta) + 0 (from node1's delta, which was 0 because no operation). Wait, no. Wait, when processing node1, which is the parent of node2 and has parent 0.\n\nWhen processing node1:\n\ndp[1] is 7 (from node2's delta of 7). l[1] is 3. Since 7 >=3, no operation needed. So nothing changes. Then, the parent of node1 is 0. So during node1's processing, since no operation was needed, delta is 0. So dp[0] +=0. So dp[0] is 7 (from node2's processing) + 0 (from node1's processing) =7.\n\nNow processing node0:\n\ndp[0] is7. l[0] is5. 7 >=5, so no operation. So k remains 1.\n\nBut the sample expects k=2. Hmm, this approach is not working.\n\nAh, because node0's r is5. So the sum for node0 must be <=5. But the current approach would set dp[0] to 7, which exceeds r[0]=5.\n\nAh, right! So the code's approach must also ensure that the sum does not exceed r[i].\n\nSo the algorithm must not only check if the current sum is below l[i], but also ensure that the sum is <= r[i].\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each node i:\n\n   The sum s_i must be in [l_i, r_i]. \n\n   The sum s_i is initially the sum of all deltas added from its children.\n\n   So dp[i] is the sum of deltas from its children.\n\n   But after adding deltas, we need to ensure that s_i does not exceed r_i.\n\n   So s_i = min(r_i, dp[i]).\n\n   If this s_i is < l_i, then we need to add an additional delta of (l_i - s_i), which requires a new operation. This delta is added to s_i and to the parent's dp.\n\nBut this seems like the correct approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each node i processed in post-order:\n\n   s_i = min(r_i, dp[i]).\n\n   if s_i < l_i:\n\n      delta = l_i - s_i.\n\n      k +=1.\n\n      s_i += delta.\n\n      parent = pp[i].\n\n      if parent >=0:\n\n          dp[parent] += delta.\n\n   else:\n\n      s_i = min(r_i, dp[i]).\n\n   dp[i] = s_i.\n\nBut how is this tracked in the code's dp array?\n\nThe code's dp array is initialized to 0. For each node i, when processed, the dp[i] contains the sum of deltas from its children.\n\nThen, the code computes the maximum possible s_i as min(r_i, dp[i]). If this is less than l_i, we need to add a delta of l_i - s_i. This delta is added to the parent's dp (so that when the parent is processed, it will account for this delta). The node's s_i is now l_i.\n\nBut how is the code's dp array structured.\n\nLet's walk through the second sample:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3.\n\npp[1]=0 (parent of node1 is 0), pp[2]=1 (parent of node2 is 1).\n\nl and r:\n\nnode0: l=5, r=5.\n\nnode1: l=3, r=3.\n\nnode2: l=7, r=7.\n\nProcessing nodes in reverse order: 2,1,0.\n\nProcessing node2:\n\ndp[2] is 0 (initial value).\n\ns_i = min(7, 0) =0 <7.\n\ndelta =7-0=7.\n\nk becomes 1.\n\nparent is pp[2] =1.\n\ndp[1] +=7 \u2192 dp[1] is now7.\n\ns_i =7.\n\ndp[2] is set to7.\n\nProcessing node1:\n\ndp[1] is7.\n\ns_i = min(3,7) =3.\n\nSince 3 >=3 (l_i=3), no operation.\n\nSo delta is 0.\n\ndp[1] is set to3.\n\nparent is0. dp[0] +=0 \u2192 remains0.\n\nProcessing node0:\n\ndp[0] is0.\n\ns_i = min(5, 0) =0 <5.\n\ndelta=5-0=5.\n\nk becomes 2.\n\nparent is pp[0] which is -1 (since root has no parent).\n\nSo no addition to parent's dp.\n\ns_i becomes5.\n\ndp[0] is set to5.\n\nThis gives k=2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the second sample.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\nFor each node i:\n\n1. Compute s_i as min(r_i, dp[i]).\n\n2. If s_i < l_i, need to perform an operation. The delta is l_i - s_i.\n\n3. Add delta to the parent's dp.\n\n4. Update k.\n\nThis way, when processing the parent, its dp will include the deltas from its children's required operations.\n\nBut in the first sample:\n\nTest case1:\n\nnode0: l=1, r=1.\n\nnode1: l=2, r=2.\n\nProcessing node1:\n\ndp[1]=0. s_i = min(2,0) =0 <2. delta=2.\n\nk=1. parent is0. dp[0] +=2. So dp[0] is 2.\n\nProcessing node0:\n\ns_i = min(1,2) =1. 1 >=1. No operation. k remains1.\n\ndp[0] is set to1.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nThis approach seems correct.\n\nSo the code's missing code would be:\n\ns_i = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\n\nif (s_i < ll[i]) {\n\n   delta = ll[i] - s_i;\n\n   k++;\n\n   s_i += delta;\n\n   if (pp[i] >=0) { // if not root\n\n       dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\ndp[i] = s_i;\n\nBut in the code, pp is the array of parents for i >=1 (since pp is read as p_2 to p_n). For node0, which is the root, pp[0] is not set. But in the code, the nodes are processed from 0 to n-1. Wait, no. The code's pp array is for i=1 to n-1. For example, for n=3, pp[0] is not used. Because pp is read as p_2, p_3. So for node i (0-based), the parent is pp[i] for i >=1. For node0, which is the root, there is no parent.\n\nSo during the processing of nodei, pp[i] is only valid for i >=1.\n\nThus, in the code, for i >=1, pp[i] is the parent's index (0-based).\n\nThus, the code for the missing part would be:\n\nlong long s = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\n\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n\n    long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n\n    k++;\n\n    s += delta;\n\n    if (i > 0) {\n\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\ndp[i] = s;\n\nBut wait, in the code, the pp array is stored for i=1 to n-1. For example, pp[i] for i=1 to n-1. So for node i (0-based), when i is 0, there is no parent. For i >=1, the parent is pp[i].\n\nBut in the code's reading:\n\nfor (i = 1; i < n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &pp[i]), pp[i]--;\n\nSo pp[1] is p_2's parent minus 1. For example, if the input is p_2=1, then pp[1] =0.\n\nThus, for node i (1-based in input), pp[i-1] is the parent index (0-based) in code.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn the code, for i from 1 to n-1:\n\npp[i] is read, and then decremented by 1.\n\nFor example, in the first sample:\n\nn=2.\n\nThe input is p_2 =1. So pp[1] is read as1, then pp[1] becomes0.\n\nThus, for node 1 (code's index), pp[1] is0, which is the parent of node1 (code's index 1).\n\nSo for code's nodei (i >=1), pp[i] is the parent's code index.\n\nThus, in the code, for nodei (i >=0), the parent is pp[i] if i >=1.\n\nSo during processing nodei:\n\nif i >0, then pp[i] is the parent's index.\n\nThus, the code for the missing part would be:\n\nlong long s = min((long long)rr[i], dp[i]);\n\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n\n    long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n\n    k++;\n\n    s += delta;\n\n    if (i != 0) {\n\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\ndp[i] = s;\n\nYes. Because for the root (i=0), there's no parent. For other nodes (i>0), the parent is pp[i].\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\ns = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n    delta = ll[i] - s;\n    k++;\n    s += delta;\n    if (i != 0) {\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n    }\n}\ndp[i] = s;\n\nSo, the code inside the loop for i from n-1 downto 0 is:\n\nlong long s = ll[i] > dp[i] ? min(rr[i], dp[i]) : min(rr[i], dp[i]);\nif (s < ll[i]) {\n    long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n    k++;\n    s += delta;\n    if (i != 0) {\n        dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n    }\n}\ndp[i] = s;\n\nWait, but calculating s as min(rr[i], dp[i]) is correct.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nfor (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    long long s = dp[i] < ll[i] ? ll[i] : (dp[i] > rr[i] ? rr[i] : dp[i]);\n    // Or more simply: s = min(rr[i], dp[i]);\n    // Because s = min(rr[i], dp[i]) and then check if s < ll[i]\n    s = min((long long)rr[i], dp[i]);\n    if (s < ll[i]) {\n        long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n        k++;\n        s += delta;\n        if (i != 0) {\n            dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n        }\n    }\n    dp[i] = s;\n}\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the missing code is the block where for each node i, compute s as the minimum of rr[i] and dp[i]. If s is less than ll[i], compute delta, increment k, add delta to s, and if i is not the root, add delta to the parent's dp.\n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the missing part is:\n\n            long long s = rr[i] < dp[i] ? rr[i] : dp[i];\n            if (s < ll[i]) {\n                long long delta = ll[i] - s;\n                k++;\n                s += delta;\n                if (i != 0)\n                    dp[pp[i]] += delta;\n            }\n            dp[i] = s;"
