The code is almost complete except for the else part in the Solve method. The existing conditions handle divisions 1, 2, and 3. So the else case must be division 4. Wait, looking at the conditions. Division 2 is checked for 1600 <= n <= 1899. Division 3 is 1400 <= n <= 1599. Then the else would cover all other cases not caught by the previous ifs. But the initial if checks if n is >=1900. So the else would be when n is less than 1600 (since division 2's lower bound is 1600), but after checking division 3 which handles down to 1400. So the else would be for n less than 1400, which is exactly division 4. So in the else block, we just need to print \"Division 4\". So the missing code is Console.
