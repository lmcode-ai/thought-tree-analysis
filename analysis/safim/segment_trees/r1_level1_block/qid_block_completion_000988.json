So the j-th element's value is div * a[j], and the sum adds the number of steps (div). But div can be positive or negative? Wait, no. Because a[j] is a positive integer. So pre is 0, then div is 0 + 1 =1. So pre becomes a[j] * 1, sum adds 1. Then next j, pre is a[j], so div is (a[j] / next_a) +1. Wait, but next_a is the a[j+1]. So for example, if the next a[j] is 3, and previous pre is 5, then 5 /3 is 1, so div=2. Then pre becomes 3*2=6, which is larger than 5. So this code for the right part is building a sequence where each element is the minimal possible to be strictly larger than the previous, which would minimize the sum of steps (since each step is div, which is the minimal possible to get the required value). But for the left part, which is j from i-1 downto 0, we need to compute the sum for the left elements. The left elements must form a strictly increasing sequence up to the ith element. Wait, but in the code's current setup, when processing the left elements, what's the starting point? Wait, after processing the left elements, the code sets pre=0 and processes the right elements. So perhaps the left part is handled first, and then the right part. Wait, no. The code first runs the left loop (from j=i-1 downto 0), then sets pre=0 and processes the right loop (j=i+1). So the left loop's processing is before the right loop. But how is the left loop connected to the right part?",

But how is the ith element's value determined in this case? In the code's current setup, for the left part, the code's loop starts with sum=0 and pre=0. Then processes j from i-1 downto 0. Then, after processing the left part, pre is set to 0 again for the right loop. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the left part and right part would both start with pre=0. So perhaps the code's approach is that the ith element is treated as zero, but that's impossible since all elements must be strictly increasing. For example, if i=0 (the first element), then all elements to the right must be larger than it. But if the first element is zero, the next must be at least 1 (assuming a[j] is 1). But the code may not be correct. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but the user expects us to fill in the left part code.",

So for j < j+1, b[j] < b[j+1]. But in the code's left loop, processing j from i-1 downto 0. So j+1 is processed before j (since we are going backward). So when handling j, j+1's value is already known (pre). So for j, we need to choose k_j such that k_j * a[j] < pre. But pre is the value of j+1's element. So the maximum possible k_j is floor( (pre -1)/a[j] ), which would be the largest k_j such that k_j * a[j] < pre. But how do we compute that? Let's see: For example, if pre is 5 and a[j] is 2. Then the maximum k_j is 2, since 2*2=4 <5. So k_j is 2, steps is 2. If pre is 4 and a[j] is 2: max k_j is 1 (2*1=2 <4). So steps is 1. So the formula for k_j is (pre -1) // a[j]. Because (pre-1) divided by a[j], using integer division, gives the largest integer q where q*a[j] <= pre-1. So q*a[j] <= pre-1 < pre, so q is the maximum k_j possible. But wait, pre can be negative. For example, if pre is -3, and a[j] is 2. Then the maximum k_j is (-3-1)/2 = -4/2 = -2. So k_j * a[j] = -2 *2 = -4 < pre (-3). But that's not possible. Wait, no.",

So j's element must be less than -3. So the maximum possible is -4 (when a[j] is 2). So k_j is -2. Steps is 2. So the formula (pre-1) // a[j] would give the correct k_j. But we need to handle negative pre values as well. So for the left loop, for each j, we need to compute k_j as (pre -1) divided by a[j], using integer division. But in Java, integer division truncates towards zero, which may not be correct in all cases. Wait, for example, if pre is 5 and a[j] is 3. (pre-1) is 4. 4//3 is 1. So k_j is 1. 3*1=3 <5. Correct. If pre is 4, a[j] is 3: (4-1) is 3. 3//3=1. 3*1=3 <4. Correct. If pre is -3, a[j] is 2. (pre-1) is -4. -4 divided by 2 is -2. So k_j is -2. 2*(-2) = -4 < -3. Correct. Another example: pre is -4, a[j] is 3. (pre-1) is -5. -5 divided by 3 is -2 (since 3*(-2) =-6 is less than -5. So -5//3 is -1 in Java because integer division rounds towards zero. Wait, Java's integer division for (-5)/3 would be -1, because 3*(-1) is -3, which is larger than -5. So the division truncates towards zero. So (-5)/3 is -1. But in our case, (pre-1) is -5, a[j] is 3. So (pre-1)/a[j] is (-5)/3 = -1. But we need the largest k_j such that k_j *3 < pre (which is -4). So k_j *3 must be < -4. The maximum k_j is -2 (since -2*3 = -6 < -4). But (-5)/3 is -1, which is not correct. So using (pre-1)/a[j] would not work here.",

So for example, (pre-1) = -5, a[j] = 3. (pre-1)/a[j] = -5/3 = -1. But the correct floor is -2. So in this case, the formula (pre-1 - (a[j] -1 )) / a[j] ? Alternatively, you can compute it as:\n\nlong q = (pre -1) / a[j];\n\nif ((pre -1) % a[j] ! = 0 && (pre-1) <0) {\n    q--;\n} But perhaps there's a better way. Wait, but how to compute floor division in Java. Let's think. For any integers x and y (y>0), floor(x/y) can be computed as (x - y +1) / y when x is negative. Alternatively, use:\n\nlong q = (pre-1) / a[j];\nlong r = (pre-1) % a[j];\nif (r !=0 && ((pre-1) <0 || a[j] <0)) {\n    q--;\n} Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can use:\n\nq = Math.floorDiv(pre-1, a[j]); But Java's Math.floorDiv is available since Java 8. So for example, Math.floorDiv(x, y) returns the largest (closest to positive infinity) long value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient. So for x = -5, y=3, Math.floorDiv(-5,3) is -2, which is correct. So using Math.floorDiv(pre-1, a[j]) would give the correct k_j. But in Java, how to handle this? For the code to be filled in, perhaps we can write:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\n\nBut then, the code must compute div and sum += Math.abs(div), and set pre to div * arr[j]. Wait, but the code's sum for the left loop is sum += ... ? So the code for the left loop would be:\n\nfor (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n    long currentPre = pre; // this is the next element (j+1's value)\n    long div = Math.floorDiv(currentPre - 1, arr[j]);\n    sum += Math.abs(div);\n    pre = div * arr[j];\n}\n\nBut wait, pre starts as 0 in the left loop. Wait, no. Let's look at the code: In the code:\n\nsum=0;\n\npre=0;\n\nThen for j in left loop (i-1 downto 0):\n\nSo the first j is i-1. The next element is j+1 = i. So the value of the next element (i) is pre, which is 0. So for j=i-1, we need to compute div such that div * a[j] < 0. So the maximum possible div is (0-1)/a[j] = -1 / a[j].",

So the value for j=i-1 is -1 * a[j]. Which is less than 0. Then sum adds Math.abs(div) = 1. Then, pre becomes -a[j]. Then for j=i-2, the next element (j+1) is i-1, which has value pre = -a[i-1]. So we need to compute div for j=i-2 such that div * a[j] < pre (which is -a[i-1]). So for example, if a[j] is 3, pre is -5. Then (pre-1) is -6. Math.floorDiv(-6, 3) is -2. So div is -2. 3*(-2) =-6 < -5. Correct. So in the left loop, for each j, we compute div as the maximum possible k_j such that k_j *a[j] < pre. Then sum adds the absolute value of div. Then pre is updated to div * a[j], so the next j (to the left) can use this as the next element's value.

Then right loop is j=1 to 4. pre is 0. j=1: a[j]=2. div = 0/2 +1 =0+1=1. pre=1*2=2. sum +=1.\n\nj=2: a[j]=1. div=2/1 +1=2+1=3. pre=3*1=3. sum +=3. sum now 4.\n\nj=3: a[j]=2. div=3/2 +1=1+1=2. pre=2*2=4. sum +=2. sum now 6.\n\nj=4: a[j]=1. div=4/1 +1=4+1=5. pre=5*1=5. sum +=5. sum now 11. So the total sum is 11 for i=0. But in example 1, the correct sum is 4. So this approach can't be correct. Wait, but the code's approach is to try all i's and select the minimal sum. So perhaps when i=2 (third element, 0-based index 2), the code computes a sum that matches the example. But according to the example, the optimal solution is to subtract a_1 (steps 1), and add a_3, a_4, a_5 (steps 1+1+1=3). But also, the second element (index 1) remains 0. So the code's approach may not capture that. So perhaps the code's approach is wrong. But according to the code structure, the code is trying to process each i as the center and compute the sum for left and right, then take the minimum. But how?",

For example, if i is 1 (second element), then in the left loop j=0 (i-1=0). pre is initially 0. For j=0, a[j] is 1. pre is 0. So (pre-1) is -1. Math.floorDiv(-1, 1) is -1. sum +=1. pre is -1*1=-1. Then for the right loop, j starts at i+1=2. pre is 0. Then j=2, a[j]=1. div=0/1 +1=1. sum +=1. pre=1*1=1. j=3, a[j]=2. div=1/2 +1=0+1=1. sum +=1. pre=2.\n\nj=4, a[j]=1. div=2/1 +1=3. sum +=3. pre=3.

So it's possible that the code is not considering scenarios where the ith element's value is non-zero. Hence, the code's approach may be incorrect. But according to the problem's note, example 1's solution has b_1 = -1 (i=0?), and other elements added. So the code's approach may not find this solution because it's considering the ith element's value as zero. So perhaps the code's approach is wrong. But given that the code is provided and the user expects us to fill in the missing code, we have to proceed. The code's right loop seems to handle the right part correctly. The left loop needs to compute the left part. The missing code is the processing for the left loop.",

So the code's approach would not find the correct answer. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but the user's code is structured as such, and the missing code is the left loop code as described. But according to the problem's example, the correct answer is obtained when the ith element is chosen as the second element (index 1). Let's see: For example, in example 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,1,2,1]. Let's try i=1 (second element). The code's sum will be the sum of left (j=0) and right (j=2,3,4). Left loop:\n\npre=0.\n\nj=0. a[j] =1.\n\ndiv = Math.floorDiv(0-1, 1) = Math.floorDiv(-1, 1) =-1.\n\nsum +=1. pre becomes -1*1= -1. So left sum is 1. Right loop:\n\npre=0.\n\nj=2. a[j]=1. div =0/1+1=1. sum +=1. pre=1. j=3. a[j]=2. div=1/2 +1=0+1=1. sum +=1. pre=2.\n\nj=4. a[j]=1. div=2/1+1=3. sum +=3. pre=3. Right sum is 1+1+3=5. Total sum is 1+5=6. But the correct answer is 4. Hmm, not matching. So the code's approach is not finding the correct answer. So there's a problem. But according to the problem's example, the solution can be achieved by fixing i=2 (third element). Let's see:\n\ni=2. a[i] =1. Left loop j=1,0. pre=0. j=1: a[j]=2. div= (0-1)/2 = Math.floorDiv(-1, 2) = -1. sum +=1. pre= -2. j=0: a[j]=1. div= (-2-1)/1 = -3. sum +=3. pre=-3. Left sum 4. Right loop j=3,4. pre=0. j=3: a=2. div=0/2+1=1. sum +=1. pre=2.\n\nj=4: a=1. div=2/1+1=3. sum +=3. pre=3. Right sum 4. Total sum 4+4=8. Still not correct. So the code's approach is not working for example 1, which suggests that the code is incorrect. But according to the problem, the code is correct except for the missing left loop code. So perhaps the code's approach is not correct, but the user's code is structured that way, and the solution requires filling in the left loop code. In the absence of any other ideas, I think the correct code for the left loop is as described:\n\nfor each j in i-1 downto 0:\n\ncompute div as Math.floorDiv(pre -1, arr[j]);\n\nsum += Math.abs(div);\n\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nThus, the code to be filled in is:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nBut how to write this in Java, considering that the variables are declared. So the code inside the left loop is:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j]; So the missing code is these three lines. But in the code, the loop is written as:\n\nfor(int j=i-1;j>=0;j--){ \n    /* TODO: Your code here */ \n} So the missing code is:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nBut in Java, the variables must be declared. Since pre is declared as long, and arr[j] is long, the code would be:\n\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j]; Wait, the order is: first compute div, then add to sum, then update pre. Yes. So the three lines are:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\n\nsum += Math.abs(div);\n\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nThis code would process the left elements correctly. But in example 1, this code doesn't find the correct answer. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but according to the problem's submission, this is the correct code to fill in. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the examples are not handled properly.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. Initially, all b_i are zero.\n\nHmm. So for each element in the array a, we can adjust b_i by multiples of a_i. The goal is to have b strictly increasing. That means for every i < j, b_i < b_j.\n\nWait, but how do the moves translate into the b values? Each move is either adding or subtracting a_i once. For example, if we choose to add a_i once, then b_i becomes +a_i. Subtract once, it's -a_i. So each element's value in b is a multiple of a_i, because each move contributes a_i. So each b_i can be written as k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (could be positive, negative, or zero).\n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing k_i's such that the sequence k_1*a_1, k_2*a_2, ..., k_n*a_n is strictly increasing. And we want to minimize the sum of the absolute values of the k_i's (since each k_i represents the number of moves, either adding or subtracting). Because each move is one step. For example, k_i = 3 means adding three times, so three moves. k_i = -2 would mean subtracting two times, two moves. So the total moves is the sum of |k_i| for all i.\n\nSo the problem is to find a sequence of k_i's such that for all i < j, k_i * a_i < k_j * a_j, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nThe challenge is to find such a sequence with minimal total moves.\n\nThe code provided seems to have a loop where for each i (from 0 to n-1), it's considering that the ith element is fixed in some way, and then calculating the sum for the left and right parts. Then taking the minimum of all those sums.\n\nWait, let's look at the code structure. The main loop is for each i from 0 to n-1. For each i, there's a sum variable. Then, for j from i-1 down to 0, they are processing the left elements, then for j from i+1 to n-1, processing the right elements. Then the sum is the total moves for this configuration, and ans is the minimum of all such sums.\n\nSo the idea is that for each possible position i, they are considering that the element at i is part of the sequence, and then adjusting the left and right elements accordingly. Then, the minimal sum among all i's is the answer.\n\nBut how to process the left and right parts?\n\nLooking at the code: in the right part (j starts from i+1), they are calculating div as pre / arr[j] +1. Then pre becomes div * arr[j]. So sum adds div. So for the right part, the code is ensuring that each subsequent element is larger than the previous. For example, for j=i+1, the next element (j) must be larger than pre (which is initialized to 0). Then for j=i+1, pre is 0. So the div is (0 / a_j) +1 = 0 +1 =1. So pre becomes 1*a_j, sum adds 1. Then for the next j, pre is the previous pre (from the j-1 step), and they compute how many times a_j is needed to be larger than the previous.\n\nWait, that's for the right part. So for elements to the right of i, each must be greater than the previous. The code computes how many steps (div) are needed for each a_j to be at least one multiple larger than the previous. For example, if the previous pre is x, then the next element (a_j's multiple) must be >x. So the minimal k_j is such that k_j * a_j >x. The minimal k_j is the ceiling of (x / a_j) + 1? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf x is the previous value (k_{j-1}*a_{j-1}), then the next value (k_j *a_j) must be >x. So k_j must be at least (x // a_j) +1. Because if x divided by a_j is q with remainder, then (q+1)*a_j is the smallest multiple of a_j larger than x. So yes, k_j is (x//a_j) +1, but if a_j divides x, then x//a_j is exact, so adding 1 gives q+1, which is correct. So that's what the code does for the right side.\n\nBut what about the left side? The code currently has a loop for j from i-1 downto 0. The code there is missing and needs to be filled. So the left part is not handled yet. So the user's code has a loop for the left part, but the code inside is missing.\n\nSo for the left part, we need to process elements from i-1 down to 0, ensuring that each previous element (j) is less than the next (j+1). Because the array must be strictly increasing. So for example, if we have elements j and j+1 (where j is to the left of j+1), then the value for j must be less than the value for j+1.\n\nBut in the left loop, since we're processing from i-1 down to 0, perhaps we are starting from i and moving left, ensuring that each element to the left is less than the next one (which is to the right). So for j in i-1 downto 0:\n\nThe current element j must have a value that is less than the next element (j+1). So for j, after processing j+1 (since we are going from right to left), the value of j must be less than the value of j+1.\n\nSo in the left loop, for each j (starting from i-1 down to 0), we need to compute the maximum possible value for j (so that it's as large as possible but still less than the next element's value) in order to minimize the number of steps. Because the larger j's value is (without exceeding the next element), the less constraints we have on the elements further to the left.\n\nFor example, suppose the next element (j+1) has a value of 5. Then j's value must be less than 5. To minimize the number of steps, we want j's value to be as large as possible (so that the previous elements can also be as large as possible, reducing the required steps for them). So for j's value, we need the maximum possible k_j * a_j that is less than the next element's value (pre).\n\nSo for each j in the left loop:\n\npre is initially 0 (for the first iteration when j is i-1). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, in the code, for the left part:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\npre is initialized to 0.\n\nThen for j from i-1 down to 0:\n\nThe code (missing) needs to compute the required k_j such that k_j * a_j < pre (the next element's value, which is j+1's value). So in the left loop, pre represents the next element's value (j+1). So for each j, we need to compute the maximum possible k_j such that k_j * a_j < pre. Then, the sum increases by |k_j| (since each step is a move). But how to compute k_j?\n\nWait, but pre is initially 0. For example, when j is i-1 (the first iteration in the left loop), the next element is j+1 = i. But in the code's initial setup, what is the value of the ith element?\n\nLooking at the code's structure: when we fix i, the code first processes the left elements (j < i) and then the right elements (j > i). For the right elements, the code starts with pre=0, but then for each j in i+1 to n-1, pre is set to div*arr[j]. So in the right loop, the code is building the sequence starting from 0 (the ith element's value is 0?), but that can't be right. Wait, maybe the code's approach is to consider that for the current i, the ith element's value is 0 (since initially all are zero), and then adjust the left and right parts accordingly. But that's not possible because the initial b is all zeros, which is not strictly increasing. So perhaps the code's approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is to fix the ith element as part of the optimal sequence. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem by considering that the ith element is the \"pivot\" around which we build the left and right sequences. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.\n\nThe code has for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n- process the left elements (j from i-1 downto 0) to compute the sum for the left part.\n\n- process the right elements (j from i+1 to n-1) to compute sum for the right part.\n\nThen, ans is the minimal sum across all i.\n\nBut the code for the left part is missing. So the problem is to fill in that code.\n\nThe right part code is:\n\npre=0;\n\nfor j from i+1 to n-1:\n\ndiv = pre / arr[j] +1;\n\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nsum += div;\n\nSo this code is ensuring that each j in the right part is strictly larger than the previous one. The initial pre is 0 (the value of i's element?), then each next element is the smallest multiple of a[j] that's larger than pre. So the j-th element's value is div * a[j], and the sum adds the number of steps (div). But div can be positive or negative? Wait, no. Because a[j] is a positive integer. So pre is 0, then div is 0 + 1 =1. So pre becomes a[j] * 1, sum adds 1. Then next j, pre is a[j], so div is (a[j] / next_a) +1. Wait, but next_a is the a[j+1]. So for example, if the next a[j] is 3, and previous pre is 5, then 5 /3 is 1, so div=2. Then pre becomes 3*2=6, which is larger than 5.\n\nSo this code for the right part is building a sequence where each element is the minimal possible to be strictly larger than the previous, which would minimize the sum of steps (since each step is div, which is the minimal possible to get the required value).\n\nBut for the left part, which is j from i-1 downto 0, we need to compute the sum for the left elements. The left elements must form a strictly increasing sequence up to the ith element. Wait, but in the code's current setup, when processing the left elements, what's the starting point?\n\nWait, after processing the left elements, the code sets pre=0 and processes the right elements. So perhaps the left part is handled first, and then the right part. Wait, no. The code first runs the left loop (from j=i-1 downto 0), then sets pre=0 and processes the right loop (j=i+1). So the left loop's processing is before the right loop.\n\nBut how is the left loop connected to the right part?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that the ith element is set to some value, and the left and right sequences are built around it. For example, the ith element's value is determined, then left elements are built going backward (from i-1 to 0) ensuring that each left element is less than the next (so j+1's value is larger than j's), and the right elements are built going forward (from i+1 to n-1), each larger than the previous.\n\nBut how is the ith element's value determined in this case?\n\nIn the code's current setup, for the left part, the code's loop starts with sum=0 and pre=0. Then processes j from i-1 downto 0. Then, after processing the left part, pre is set to 0 again for the right loop.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the left part and right part would both start with pre=0. So perhaps the code's approach is that the ith element is treated as zero, but that's impossible since all elements must be strictly increasing. For example, if i=0 (the first element), then all elements to the right must be larger than it. But if the first element is zero, the next must be at least 1 (assuming a[j] is 1). But the code may not be correct. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but the user expects us to fill in the left part code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to model the ith element as being zero (even though that's not allowed), but then when considering the left and right parts, the code ensures that the left elements are less than zero and the right elements are greater than zero. But that's not possible because the initial b array is zero, so the ith element would have to be non-zero to form a strictly increasing array.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering that the ith element is zero, but the code is wrong. Let's think about the example given. For example, in example 1:\n\nInput:\n5\n1 2 1 2 1\n\nThe solution is to subtract a_1 (so b_1 becomes -1), and add a_3, a_4, a_5 (so their b values are 1, 2, 1, but wait, the example's final array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. Wait, how? Because in that case, the code's approach would consider each possible i. For instance, perhaps the code is trying all possible i's and finding the minimal sum.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is to model the ith element as being set to zero, and then building the left and right parts. However, that would require the left elements to be negative and the right elements to be positive, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is not considering the ith element at all. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code's sum starts at 0. For each i, it processes the left part (j < i) and the right part (j > i), and the sum is the total moves for those parts. But what about the ith element's moves? Because the code's sum does not include any moves for the ith element. That's a problem. Because the ith element's b_i is zero initially. So to make the array strictly increasing, the ith element's value must be adjusted. For example, if the left part ends with a value less than zero and the right starts with a value greater than zero, then the ith element (zero) is in between, but that's not possible. So this approach may be incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is wrong, but according to the problem's solution, the correct approach is to model the problem by dynamic programming, where for each position i, you track the minimal steps required up to i, ensuring that the value is adjusted to some optimal value. But given that the code is structured as it is, perhaps the solution is to process the left elements in reverse order, ensuring that each element is less than the previous (i.e., j's element is less than j+1's).\n\nWait, but the code processes j from i-1 downto 0. So j starts at i-1, then i-2, etc. For each j in the left part, j is to the left of j+1. So the element j must be less than j+1's element.\n\nSo for each j in the left loop:\n\nThe next element (j+1) has a value of pre. So j's element must be less than pre. And we want to choose the maximum possible value for j's element (so that it's as close to pre as possible, but less than it), which minimizes the number of steps required (since larger absolute values can require more steps, but perhaps in the left part, the code is trying to make j's element as close to pre as possible to minimize steps).\n\nWait, but j's element is a[j] * k_j. So to maximize k_j * a[j] (which must be less than pre), the maximum possible k_j is floor((pre -1)/a[j]). Because then k_j * a[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than pre.\n\nBut then the number of steps is |k_j|. So if k_j is positive, then steps are k_j (since adding a[j] k_j times). If k_j is negative, then steps are |k_j| (subtracting).\n\nWait, but in the left part, the elements must be strictly increasing. So for j < j+1, b[j] < b[j+1].\n\nBut in the code's left loop, processing j from i-1 downto 0. So j+1 is processed before j (since we are going backward). So when handling j, j+1's value is already known (pre). So for j, we need to choose k_j such that k_j * a[j] < pre.\n\nBut pre is the value of j+1's element.\n\nSo the maximum possible k_j is floor( (pre -1)/a[j] ), which would be the largest k_j such that k_j * a[j] < pre.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Let's see:\n\nFor example, if pre is 5 and a[j] is 2. Then the maximum k_j is 2, since 2*2=4 <5. So k_j is 2, steps is 2. If pre is 4 and a[j] is 2: max k_j is 1 (2*1=2 <4). So steps is 1.\n\nSo the formula for k_j is (pre -1) // a[j]. Because (pre-1) divided by a[j], using integer division, gives the largest integer q where q*a[j] <= pre-1. So q*a[j] <= pre-1 < pre, so q is the maximum k_j possible.\n\nBut wait, pre can be negative. For example, if pre is -3, and a[j] is 2. Then the maximum k_j is (-3-1)/2 = -4/2 = -2. So k_j * a[j] = -2 *2 = -4 < pre (-3). But that's not possible. Wait, no. -4 is less than -3, but we want j's element to be less than j+1's element (pre is j+1's element, which is -3). So j's element must be less than -3. So the maximum possible is -4 (when a[j] is 2). So k_j is -2. Steps is 2.\n\nSo the formula (pre-1) // a[j] would give the correct k_j.\n\nBut we need to handle negative pre values as well.\n\nSo for the left loop, for each j, we need to compute k_j as (pre -1) divided by a[j], using integer division. But in Java, integer division truncates towards zero, which may not be correct in all cases.\n\nWait, for example, if pre is 5 and a[j] is 3. (pre-1) is 4. 4//3 is 1. So k_j is 1. 3*1=3 <5. Correct.\n\nIf pre is 4, a[j] is 3: (4-1) is 3. 3//3=1. 3*1=3 <4. Correct.\n\nIf pre is -3, a[j] is 2. (pre-1) is -4. -4 divided by 2 is -2. So k_j is -2. 2*(-2) = -4 < -3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: pre is -4, a[j] is 3. (pre-1) is -5. -5 divided by 3 is -2 (since 3*(-2) =-6 is less than -5. So -5//3 is -1 in Java because integer division rounds towards zero. Wait, Java's integer division for (-5)/3 would be -1, because 3*(-1) is -3, which is larger than -5. So the division truncates towards zero. So (-5)/3 is -1.\n\nBut in our case, (pre-1) is -5, a[j] is 3. So (pre-1)/a[j] is (-5)/3 = -1. But we need the largest k_j such that k_j *3 < pre (which is -4). So k_j *3 must be < -4. The maximum k_j is -2 (since -2*3 = -6 < -4). But (-5)/3 is -1, which is not correct. So using (pre-1)/a[j] would not work here.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the formula (pre-1) // a[j] is not correct when pre is negative. So we need a way to compute the correct k_j for both positive and negative pre.\n\nSo how can we compute the correct k_j?\n\nThe correct formula is: k_j = floor( (pre -1)/a[j] )\n\nIn Java, how can we compute floor division?\n\nIn Java, when dividing two integers, the division truncates towards zero. So for positive numbers, it's correct, but for negative numbers, it's not. For example, (-5)/3 in Java is -1, but floor(-5/3) is -2.\n\nSo to compute floor((pre-1)/a[j]), we need to adjust for this.\n\nOne way to compute floor division in Java is to check if there's a remainder. For example:\n\nIf (pre-1) and a[j] are both positive, then (pre-1)/a[j] is correct.\n\nIf (pre-1) is negative and a[j] is positive, then (pre-1)/a[j] gives a result that is rounded up (towards zero), but we need to round down.\n\nSo for example, (pre-1) = -5, a[j] = 3. (pre-1)/a[j] = -5/3 = -1. But the correct floor is -2.\n\nSo in this case, the formula (pre-1 - (a[j] -1 )) / a[j] ?\n\nAlternatively, you can compute it as:\n\nlong q = (pre -1) / a[j];\n\nif ((pre -1) % a[j] != 0 && (pre-1) <0) {\n    q--;\n}\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, but how to compute floor division in Java. Let's think.\n\nFor any integers x and y (y>0), floor(x/y) can be computed as (x - y +1) / y when x is negative.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nlong q = (pre-1) / a[j];\nlong r = (pre-1) % a[j];\nif (r !=0 && ((pre-1) <0 || a[j] <0)) {\n    q--;\n}\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can use:\n\nq = Math.floorDiv(pre-1, a[j]);\n\nBut Java's Math.floorDiv is available since Java 8. So for example, Math.floorDiv(x, y) returns the largest (closest to positive infinity) long value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient. So for x = -5, y=3, Math.floorDiv(-5,3) is -2, which is correct.\n\nSo using Math.floorDiv(pre-1, a[j]) would give the correct k_j.\n\nBut in Java, how to handle this? For the code to be filled in, perhaps we can write:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\n\nBut then, the code must compute div and sum += Math.abs(div), and set pre to div * arr[j].\n\nWait, but the code's sum for the left loop is sum += ... ?\n\nSo the code for the left loop would be:\n\nfor (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n    long currentPre = pre; // this is the next element (j+1's value)\n    long div = Math.floorDiv(currentPre - 1, arr[j]);\n    sum += Math.abs(div);\n    pre = div * arr[j];\n}\n\nBut wait, pre starts as 0 in the left loop. Wait, no. Let's look at the code:\n\nIn the code:\n\nsum=0;\n\npre=0;\n\nThen for j in left loop (i-1 downto 0):\n\nSo the first j is i-1. The next element is j+1 = i. So the value of the next element (i) is pre, which is 0. So for j=i-1, we need to compute div such that div * a[j] < 0. So the maximum possible div is (0-1)/a[j] = -1 / a[j]. Since a[j] is positive, -1/a[j] is -0. So integer division gives 0-1 (since a[j] is positive, but -1 divided by a[j] (positive) is -0. So floor division would be -1 / a[j], but if a[j] is 2, then (0-1) is -1, divided by 2 is -0.5, floor is -1.\n\nSo div is Math.floorDiv(-1, 2) which is -1.\n\nSo div is -1. So the value for j=i-1 is -1 * a[j]. Which is less than 0. Then sum adds Math.abs(div) = 1.\n\nThen, pre becomes -a[j]. Then for j=i-2, the next element (j+1) is i-1, which has value pre = -a[i-1]. So we need to compute div for j=i-2 such that div * a[j] < pre (which is -a[i-1]).\n\nSo for example, if a[j] is 3, pre is -5. Then (pre-1) is -6. Math.floorDiv(-6, 3) is -2. So div is -2. 3*(-2) =-6 < -5. Correct.\n\nSo in the left loop, for each j, we compute div as the maximum possible k_j such that k_j *a[j] < pre. Then sum adds the absolute value of div. Then pre is updated to div * a[j], so the next j (to the left) can use this as the next element's value.\n\nSo the code for the left loop would be:\n\nfor (int j = i-1; j >= 0; j--) {\n    long div = (pre - 1) / arr[j];  // but this is using integer division which truncates towards zero. So this may not work.\n\nWait, but when pre is 0 (initially), then pre-1 is -1. So for j = i-1, a[j] is a positive number. So (pre-1) / a[j] is (-1) / a[j], which would be 0 if a[j] is >=1. Because, for example, (-1)/2 is 0 in Java.\n\nBut wait, a[j] is a positive integer. So (pre-1) is -1. Then (pre-1)/a[j] is 0 (since -1 divided by 2 is 0.5, which truncates to 0). But this gives div=0. So k_j is 0. So 0 *a[j] =0, which is not less than pre (which is 0). So this is invalid.\n\nSo this suggests that using integer division is not correct and that we must use Math.floorDiv to compute the correct div.\n\nTherefore, the correct code for the left loop is:\n\nfor (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n    long div = Math.floorDiv(pre -1, arr[j]);\n    sum += Math.abs(div);\n    pre = div * arr[j];\n}\n\nYes. Because Math.floorDiv correctly computes the floor of the division.\n\nSo for the first iteration, pre is 0. pre-1 is -1. a[j] is positive. So Math.floorDiv(-1, a[j]) is -1, since -1 divided by any positive a[j] is -1/a[j], which is between 0 and -1 (if a[j] is 2, it's -0.5), floor is -1. So div is -1. So the value for j is -a[j], which is less than pre (0). Sum adds 1. Then pre becomes -a[j].\n\nSo for example, in example 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,1,2,1]\n\nFor i=0 (the first element), the code processes left loop (no elements, since j from -1 downto 0 is not executed). Then sum is 0. Then right loop is j=1 to 4.\n\npre is 0.\n\nj=1: a[j]=2.\n\ndiv = 0/2 +1 =0+1=1. pre=1*2=2. sum +=1.\n\nj=2: a[j]=1. div=2/1 +1=2+1=3. pre=3*1=3. sum +=3. sum now 4.\n\nj=3: a[j]=2. div=3/2 +1=1+1=2. pre=2*2=4. sum +=2. sum now 6.\n\nj=4: a[j]=1. div=4/1 +1=4+1=5. pre=5*1=5. sum +=5. sum now 11.\n\nSo the total sum is 11 for i=0. But in example 1, the correct sum is 4. So this approach can't be correct.\n\nWait, but the code's approach is to try all i's and select the minimal sum. So perhaps when i=2 (third element, 0-based index 2), the code computes a sum that matches the example.\n\nBut according to the example, the optimal solution is to subtract a_1 (steps 1), and add a_3, a_4, a_5 (steps 1+1+1=3). But also, the second element (index 1) remains 0. So the code's approach may not capture that.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is wrong. But according to the code structure, the code is trying to process each i as the center and compute the sum for left and right, then take the minimum. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to model the ith element as being zero, but then allowing the left elements to be negative and the right to be positive. But this would require the left elements to be strictly increasing up to zero and the right elements to be strictly increasing after zero. But the code's approach may not capture this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the left and right processing is different. Let's see in example 1:\n\nThe code loops through all i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the correct solution has b as [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. So the first element is -1 (k_0 = -1), second is 0 (k_1=0), third is 3 (k_2=3), fourth is 4 (k_3=2), fifth is 5 (k_4=5). The sum is 1 (for i=0) +0 (i=1) +3 (i=2) +2 (i=3) +5 (i=4) = 11. But the example says 4 steps. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, the example says: subtract a_1 (steps 1), add a_3 (steps 1), add a_4 (steps 1), add a_5 (steps 1). Total steps 4. So the solution has:\n\nb_1 (index 0) is -1 (steps 1).\n\nb_3 (index 2) is +1 (steps 1).\n\nb_4 (index 3) is +2 (steps 1).\n\nb_5 (index 4) is +1 (steps 1? Wait, no. Because a_3 is 1. So adding a_3 once gives 1. a_4 is 2: adding once gives 2. a_5 is 1: adding once gives 1. So the sum is 1 (for index 0) +1 (index 2) +1 (index 3) +1 (index4) = 4 steps.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the code is trying to fix i as the pivot and process left and right. For example, if i is 1 (second element), then in the left loop j=0 (i-1=0). pre is initially 0. For j=0, a[j] is 1. pre is 0. So (pre-1) is -1. Math.floorDiv(-1, 1) is -1. sum +=1. pre is -1*1=-1.\n\nThen for the right loop, j starts at i+1=2. pre is 0. Then j=2, a[j]=1. div=0/1 +1=1. sum +=1. pre=1*1=1.\n\nj=3, a[j]=2. div=1/2 +1=0+1=1. sum +=1. pre=2.\n\nj=4, a[j]=1. div=2/1 +1=3. sum +=3. pre=3.\n\nSo sum for i=1 is 1 (left) +1+1+3=6. total sum 1+5=6. Which is better than 11 for i=0. But the correct answer is 4.\n\nSo how does the code find the correct answer?\n\nAh, perhaps the code's approach is to allow the ith element to have a non-zero value. But in the code's current structure, the ith element's value is not accounted for. The code's sum is the sum of the left and right parts, but the ith element's steps are not considered. This suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the code's current structure, it's possible that the ith element's steps are zero (so the code's sum is the sum of left and right parts). But how can this lead to a valid solution?\n\nFor example, in the example, the ith element is 1 (index 1). The left part sum is 1 (for j=0, steps 1). The right part sum is 1 (j=2) +1 (j=3) +3 (j=4). Total sum 1+1+1+3=6. But the correct sum is 4.\n\nSo the code's approach is not capturing the correct scenario. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect. But according to the problem statement, the code is missing the left loop code and the rest is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is correct, and the left loop code is missing. So the code's left loop for j from i-1 downto 0 needs to compute the correct sum. Let's think again.\n\nIn the example 1, the code's approach must find for some i the correct sum. Let's see, perhaps when i=0 is not the correct pivot.\n\nThe correct solution has b as [-1, 0,3,4,5]. The array is strictly increasing. Let's see for i=1 (b_1=0):\n\nThe left part is j=0. Need to compute j=0's value. pre is 0 (for j+1=1). So j=0's value must be less than 0. So k_j is (0-1)/a[0] = -1/1 = -1. So steps +=1. pre becomes -1*1=-1. So the left sum is 1.\n\nThe right part starts at j=2, with pre=0. j=2: a=1. div=0/1+1=1. pre=1. sum +=1.\n\nj=3: a=2. div=1/2 +1=0+1=1. pre=2. sum +=1.\n\nj=4: a=1. div=2/1 +1=3. pre=3. sum +=3. Total sum for right is 5. So total sum is 1+5=6.\n\nBut the correct sum is 4. So this suggests that the code's approach isn't capturing the correct scenario.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is wrong. But according to the problem statement, the code is correct except for the missing left loop code. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the left loop code is missing.\n\nSo what's the correct code for the left loop?\n\nAnother example: in example 2, the input is:\n\n7\n\n3 1 1 1 1 1 3\n\nThe output is 10.\n\nThe correct solution is to have the array [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]. So each element is increased by one step (except the first and last). For example:\n\nk_0 = -1 (3 steps: 3 * (-1) = -3). Wait, wait, no. Wait, a[0] is 3. So k_0 is -1. That's one step (subtract once). Then a[1] is 1: k_1 is -2 (steps 2). a[2] is 1: k_2 is -1 (steps 1). Wait, no. The example's steps sum to 10. So perhaps each element from 0 to 6 has k_i such that their steps sum to 10.\n\nBut regardless, the code's approach must handle this.\n\nAssuming that the code's approach is correct and the left loop code is missing, let's proceed to fill in the left loop code.\n\nThe correct code for the left loop would be:\n\nfor (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n    long div = Math.floorDiv(pre -1, arr[j]);\n    sum += Math.abs(div);\n    pre = div * arr[j];\n}\n\nThis code computes for each j in the left loop the maximum possible k_j such that k_j*a[j] < pre (which is j+1's value). The sum adds the absolute value of k_j (number of steps), and pre is updated to this value, so the next j can process the previous element.\n\nIn example 1, when i=2 (third element, 0-based), let's see what happens.\n\ni=2. left loop j=1,0.\n\npre starts at 0.\n\nj=1 (i-1=1). a[j]=2.\n\ndiv = (0-1)/2 = Math.floorDiv(-1, 2) = -1. sum +=1. pre = -2.\n\nj=0. a[j]=1. div = (-2-1)/1 = Math.floorDiv(-3,1) =-3. sum +=3. pre=-3.\n\nLeft sum is 1+3=4.\n\nThen right loop j=3,4.\n\npre=0.\n\nj=3: a=2. div=0/2+1=1. pre=2. sum +=1.\n\nj=4: a=1. div=2/1+1=3. sum +=3. pre=3.\n\nRight sum is 1+3=4. Total sum 4+4=8. But the correct answer is 4. So this is not matching.\n\nHmm, but the correct solution for example 1 is achieved by setting i=0's left sum to 0, and the right sum to 4. Or perhaps the code is not considering all possible i's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to consider that the ith element is part of the solution, but in the code's current structure, the ith element's value is zero. So it's possible that the code is not considering scenarios where the ith element's value is non-zero. Hence, the code's approach may be incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, example 1's solution has b_1 = -1 (i=0?), and other elements added. So the code's approach may not find this solution because it's considering the ith element's value as zero. So perhaps the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut given that the code is provided and the user expects us to fill in the missing code, we have to proceed.\n\nThe code's right loop seems to handle the right part correctly. The left loop needs to compute the left part.\n\nThe missing code is the processing for the left loop. The code for the left loop should compute, for each j from i-1 downto 0, the number of steps required to make each element j less than the next (j+1).\n\nThe code for the left loop should be:\n\nlong div = (pre -1) / arr[j];\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nBut this will not work correctly with negative numbers, due to Java's integer division truncating towards zero.\n\nSo the correct code is to use Math.floorDiv.\n\nSo the code for the left loop would be:\n\nfor (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n    long div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\n    sum += Math.abs(div);\n    pre = div * arr[j];\n}\n\nThis should compute the correct number of steps for the left part.\n\nBut in example 1, when i=0 (first element), the left loop does not run (j from -1 downto 0 is not executed). The right loop runs for j=1 to4.\n\npre=0:\n\nj=1: a=2. div=0/2+1=1. sum +=1. pre=2.\n\nj=2: a=1. div=2/1 +1=3. sum +=3. pre=3.\n\nj=3: a=2. div=3/2 +1=1+1=2. sum +=2. pre=4.\n\nj=4: a=1. div=4/1 +1=5. sum +=5. sum=1+3+2+5=11.\n\nBut the correct sum is 4. So this approach is not working.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is wrong, but the user's code is structured that way. However, the correct solution must be to fill in the left loop code as described.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the initial sum is wrong.\n\nWait, the code's sum starts at 0. For each i, it's the sum of left and right parts. But what about the ith element's steps? Because the code's sum doesn't account for the ith element. For example, in the code's approach, the ith element's value is zero, but that's not allowed unless all previous elements are negative and the next are positive. But in the code's processing, the left elements are processed to be less than zero (if i is considered as zero), and the right elements are processed to be positive.\n\nBut in example 1, the ith element's value is zero. The left loop (for i=0) is not processed. The right loop is processed, but the sum is 11. So the code's approach would not find the correct answer.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but the user's code is structured as such, and the missing code is the left loop code as described.\n\nBut according to the problem's example, the correct answer is obtained when the ith element is chosen as the second element (index 1). Let's see:\n\nFor example, in example 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,1,2,1].\n\nLet's try i=1 (second element). The code's sum will be the sum of left (j=0) and right (j=2,3,4).\n\nLeft loop:\n\npre=0.\n\nj=0. a[j] =1.\n\ndiv = Math.floorDiv(0-1, 1) = Math.floorDiv(-1, 1) =-1.\n\nsum +=1. pre becomes -1*1= -1.\n\nSo left sum is 1.\n\nRight loop:\n\npre=0.\n\nj=2. a[j]=1.\n\ndiv =0/1+1=1. sum +=1. pre=1.\n\nj=3. a[j]=2. div=1/2 +1=0+1=1. sum +=1. pre=2.\n\nj=4. a[j]=1. div=2/1+1=3. sum +=3. pre=3.\n\nRight sum is 1+1+3=5.\n\nTotal sum is 1+5=6. But the correct answer is 4.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nSo the code's approach is not finding the correct answer. So there's a problem.\n\nBut according to the problem's example, the solution can be achieved by fixing i=2 (third element). Let's see:\n\ni=2. a[i] =1.\n\nLeft loop j=1,0.\n\npre=0.\n\nj=1: a[j]=2.\n\ndiv= (0-1)/2 = Math.floorDiv(-1, 2) = -1. sum +=1. pre= -2.\n\nj=0: a[j]=1. div= (-2-1)/1 = -3. sum +=3. pre=-3.\n\nLeft sum 4.\n\nRight loop j=3,4.\n\npre=0.\n\nj=3: a=2. div=0/2+1=1. sum +=1. pre=2.\n\nj=4: a=1. div=2/1+1=3. sum +=3. pre=3.\n\nRight sum 4.\n\nTotal sum 4+4=8.\n\nStill not correct.\n\nSo the code's approach is not working for example 1, which suggests that the code is incorrect. But according to the problem, the code is correct except for the missing left loop code.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is not correct, but the user's code is structured that way, and the solution requires filling in the left loop code.\n\nIn the absence of any other ideas, I think the correct code for the left loop is as described:\n\nfor each j in i-1 downto 0:\n\ncompute div as Math.floorDiv(pre -1, arr[j]);\n\nsum += Math.abs(div);\n\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nThus, the code to be filled in is:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nBut how to write this in Java, considering that the variables are declared.\n\nSo the code inside the left loop is:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nSo the missing code is these three lines.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is written as:\n\nfor(int j=i-1;j>=0;j--){ \n    /* TODO: Your code here */ \n}\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nBut in Java, the variables must be declared. Since pre is declared as long, and arr[j] is long, the code would be:\n\nsum += Math.abs(div);\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nWait, the order is: first compute div, then add to sum, then update pre.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the three lines are:\n\nlong div = Math.floorDiv(pre - 1, arr[j]);\n\nsum += Math.abs(div);\n\npre = div * arr[j];\n\nThis code would process the left elements correctly.\n\nBut in example 1, this code doesn't find the correct answer. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but according to the problem's submission, this is the correct code to fill in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the examples are not handled properly. For example, maybe the code considers all possible i's and selects the minimal sum, but in example 1, the minimal sum is achieved for some i that we are not considering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct and the example is handled correctly when i=4 (last element). Let's see:\n\ni=4 (last element, a[j]=1).\n\nLeft loop j=3,2,1,0.\n\npre=0.\n\nj=3: a=2. div=Math.floorDiv(0-1,2)=Math.floorDiv(-1,2)=-1. sum +=1. pre=-2.\n\nj=2: a=1. div=(-2-1)/1= -3. sum +=3. pre=-3.\n\nj=1: a=2. div=(-3-1)/2 = (-4)/2= -2. sum +=2. pre=-4.\n\nj=0: a=1. div=(-4-1)/1= -5. sum +=5. pre=-5.\n\nLeft sum is 1+3+2+5=11.\n\nRight loop is j=5, which is out of bounds (n=5, j starts at i+1=5). So sum is 11. The code's ans is the minimal of all i's.\n\nBut the correct answer is 4, which is not captured by any i's processing.\n\nSo this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect, but according to the problem's instructions, this is the code to be completed. Hence, the correct code to fill in is as described."
