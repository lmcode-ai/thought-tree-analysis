So the color of i must be B if the stamp is BR, or R if the stamp is RB. So for each cell i (non-W), the possible color depends on which of the two possible stamps was applied last, and the orientation of that stamp. But the stamps are pairs; applying a stamp (i, i+1) affects both i and i+1. So if we choose to have the last stamp on i as (i, i+1), then that same stamp is the last one for i+1 as well (since (i, i+1) is the left pair for i+1? No, for i+1, the left pair is (i, i+1), and the right pair is (i+1, i+2). So if the last stamp for i is (i, i+1), then for i+1, the last stamp could be (i, i+1) or (i+1, i+2). This is getting complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's think of the problem in terms of transitions between cells.",

Wait, but in the fifth test case, the segment is of length 3, which is possible. So the length can be any \u22651? No, no. Because for a single cell, you can't apply a stamp.

But the first pair (0,1) RB sets s[1] to B as well. So perhaps the pair (1,2) is not needed. But in this case, the pairs must be applied in such a way that each cell's last stamp is considered. This is getting complex. Let's think of another approach.",

So s[1] would be R (first character of the pair's orientation). But this would require that the last pair applied to cell 1 is (1,2) as RB. But in this case, the previous pair (0,1) was applied, but if the pair (1,2) is applied after, then cell 1's color is set to R by the pair (1,2) as RB.

But how to model this. This seems like a chain of possibilities. Let's try to model this for the fifth test case:\n\nSegment 'BRB' (indices 0, 1, 2). - Pair (0,1) must start with B. So orientation is BR (B R) or RB (R B) -> but first character must be B. So only BR is possible.\n\n- Pair (0,1) is BR, so s[0] is B and s[1] is R.\n\n- Now, for cell 1, the last stamp can be pair (0,1) or (1,2). If the last stamp for cell 1 is (0,1), then s[1] must be R (the second character of BR), which matches.",

Since the segment is non-W, this is impossible.\n\n3. For the first pair (0,1), there are two possible orientations (BR or RB), but it must match the first character. So:\n\n   a.

Thus, the code in Python would be:\n\nfor s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for part in s.split('W'):\n\n        if not part:\n\n            continue\n\n        if len(part) == 1:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n        for i in range(len(part)-1):\n\n            if part[i:i+2] not in ('BR', 'RB'):\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\") But this code has a potential issue: when the entire string is made of W's (like 'WWW'), then all parts are empty, so valid remains True, but the answer should be YES (since zero stamps are applied).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given string can be formed using the stamp operations described. Let's think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the stamp operation. The stamp covers two adjacent cells and changes their colors. Each application can be either RB or BR. Also, each stamp application can overlap previous ones. But every time you apply the stamp, both cells under it are recolored. So each stamp affects exactly two cells, flipping their colors in some way based on the stamp's current orientation.\n\nThe key here is to figure out the conditions that the target string must satisfy for it to be possible. Let's consider some examples and see patterns.\n\nFor instance, if the target string has a single cell (n=1), then it's impossible unless it's white. Because the stamp requires two cells. So for any n=1 and the cell is not white, output is NO.\n\nWait, the note mentions that for the second, third, and fourth test cases (probably n=1), the answer is no. So the first check is: if n is 1, then the only possible valid string is \"W\". Otherwise, if the string has any non-white, it's impossible.\n\nSo first condition: if n is 1, check if the string is \"W\". If not, return NO.\n\nNow for n \u2265 2.\n\nLet's think about the parity of colors. Each stamp application changes two cells. But how do the colors work?\n\nEach stamp application adds either RB or BR to two consecutive cells. But since each application can overlap previous ones, the effect can be cumulative. However, since each application is a flip (applying the same stamp again would revert the colors?), but perhaps the order matters. Wait, no. Because each stamp operation applies the colors, not toggle. So if you apply BR on two white cells, they become B and R. If you apply BR again on the same two cells, they become B again and R again? Wait, no. Because each application sets the colors as per the stamp. So the stamp's effect is not additive. For example, applying BR once makes the two cells B and R. Applying BR again would leave them B and R again. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says \"recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So each stamp application sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. So the order of operations matters, and each operation overwrites the previous colors of those two cells.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" So each time you stamp a pair of cells, their colors are set to either BR or RB, depending on how you apply the stamp.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. So when you apply the stamp, you choose the orientation (BR or RB), and then you set the two cells to that pair. So each stamp operation can overwrite previous colors.\n\nFor example, if you have cells that are BR and you apply the same stamp again, nothing changes. But if you apply the opposite orientation (RB), then they become RB.\n\nBut the problem is that each operation can be applied any number of times, possibly overwriting previous changes. The question is, given a target string, can we find a sequence of stamp applications that results in the target.\n\nBut how can we model this? It's challenging because each stamp application affects two cells. Let's think of the target string and see what constraints must be satisfied.\n\nLet me consider the parity of each position. For example, each position (except the first and last) can be covered by two different stamps: one that includes it as the left cell, and one as the right cell. But maybe the parity (whether the cell is covered an odd or even number of times by each possible stamp) affects the possible color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the target string cannot have any W's, except possibly in some specific cases. Wait, no. Because the example in the problem statement includes a W at the end. Wait, in the first example, the final picture is BRB B W. So that's possible. So W's can be present.\n\nWait, but how can a W appear? Because each stamp operation sets two cells to R and B (or B and R). So if a cell is white in the target, that implies that it was never stamped, or was stamped an even number of times in a way that cancels out to white.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Because each stamp application sets the color of the cell. For example, if you stamp a cell once as B, then stamp it again as R (if it's part of a different pair), the cell would be R. So the only way for a cell to be white is if it was never covered by any stamp. Because once a stamp is applied to a cell, it's either B or R. So if a cell is white in the target, that means it was never stamped. So any W in the target must not be covered by any stamp operation.\n\nBut that's a problem because a stamp operation can only be applied if it's completely within the n cells. So for example, if a cell is W, then all stamp operations that could have covered it must not have been applied. But how can that be possible if adjacent cells are stamped?\n\nWait, perhaps that's impossible. For example, if a cell is W in the target, then none of the stamp operations that include it can have been applied. So for a cell i to be W, none of the stamps that cover i (positions i and i+1, or i-1 and i) can have been applied. But then, for the cells adjacent to it, if they are not W, they must be covered by stamps that don't include the W cell. This seems restrictive.\n\nWait, maybe the presence of a W in the target string implies that the entire string must consist of separate segments separated by W's, and each of those segments must be possible to form with stamps. And also, each such segment must have even length? Or some other condition.\n\nWait, for example, the sample input where the output is BRB B W (the first example). The last cell is W, but the fourth cell is B and the fifth is W. So in this case, the fourth cell must have been stamped. But how? Because the fifth cell is W, so it can't be part of any stamp. So the only stamps that could have covered the fourth cell are the stamp covering positions 3 and 4. But then, after that, the fourth cell is B. So the fifth cell remains W. That's possible.\n\nWait, but this suggests that the presence of a W in the target string creates a separation between regions. So each contiguous non-W segment must be a valid segment that can be formed by the stamps, and those segments must be even in length? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, any W in the target string must be part of a group of W's that cannot be covered by any stamp. So for example, if there's a W in the middle of the string, then all stamps must be applied in regions not overlapping that W. But that's only possible if the W is not part of any stamp. But how can that be if there are stamps applied on either side of the W?\n\nWait, no. Because if there's a W in position i, then for that cell to remain W, none of the stamps that include i can be applied. So stamp positions (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) must not be applied. Therefore, the regions left of i and right of i must be handled as separate segments.\n\nSo the entire string must be split into segments separated by W's, and each such segment must be valid. Also, each valid segment must be of even length? Because the stamps are applied in pairs. Wait, no. For example, in the fifth test case example, the input is BRB for n=3, which is 3 characters. The solution uses stamps in positions 2-3 (RB) and then 1-2 (BR), resulting in BRB. So the length of the non-W segment is 3, which is odd, but it's possible.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Wait, in the fifth test case example: the input is BRB. How is that possible? Let's think:\n\nOriginal: WWW.\n\nApply stamp on positions 2-3 as RB: W RB \u2192 W R B.\n\nThen apply stamp on 1-2 as BR: BR followed by B \u2192 B R B.\n\nSo the resulting string is BRB. So the non-W segment is length 3, which is odd. So this contradicts the idea that segments must be even.\n\nHmm. So the length can be even or odd. So that's not a constraint.\n\nSo what's the pattern here?\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem. Let's consider that each stamp application is a choice of which two consecutive cells to stamp and which orientation (BR or RB). The order of applying the stamps matters because each application overwrites the previous state.\n\nBut the problem is to determine if there exists any sequence of stamp applications that results in the target string.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a graph of possible states and transitions, but that's not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nWe need to find some invariant or property that the target must satisfy.\n\nLet's think about the parity of the colors. For example, each stamp application affects two cells. Suppose that each application can change the colors of those two cells in some way. But since each stamp is either BR or RB, perhaps the parity of R and B counts is important.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each cell's color as being determined by the last stamp that covers it. Because each application of a stamp to a pair of cells sets their colors. So the last stamp applied to a cell determines its color.\n\nSo for example, a cell can be part of multiple stamps, but the last stamp that covers it determines its color.\n\nThis is a key insight. Because each time a cell is part of a stamp, its color is set to either R or B. So the last stamp that includes that cell determines its final color.\n\nSo, for each cell i:\n\nIf the cell i is not W, then there must be at least one stamp that covers i (either as part of (i-1, i) or (i, i+1)).\n\nBut cell i is part of two possible stamps: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). The last stamp that covers i could be either of these two.\n\nSo the problem reduces to determining if there exists a way to select a set of stamps such that for each non-W cell, the last stamp covering it is applied in a direction that results in the desired color.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nEach cell (except the first and last) can be covered by two possible stamps: left (i-1, i) and right (i, i+1). The first cell can only be covered by (0,1), and the last cell by (n-2, n-1) if 0-based.\n\nBut each stamp covers two cells, so the stamps are pairs (i, i+1) for i from 0 to n-2.\n\nNow, each stamp (i, i+1) can be applied in either orientation: BR or RB.\n\nBut each application of a stamp (i, i+1) sets the colors of cells i and i+1 to the orientation's colors.\n\nThe order of applying stamps matters because later stamps overwrite previous ones.\n\nSo the problem is to find a sequence of stamps such that after all are applied, the target is achieved.\n\nBut how to model this for large n?\n\nAlternative approach: For the target string s, check for each non-W cell whether it's possible to have a sequence of stamps that leaves it with the correct color, considering the stamps that affect it.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's model the direction of the last stamp applied to each pair of cells. For example, for each pair (i, i+1), if it was the last stamp applied, then the colors of i and i+1 are determined by the orientation of that stamp.\n\nBut this is tricky because overlapping pairs affect each other.\n\nWait, but the last stamp that affects a cell determines its color. So for cell i, the last stamp that covers i is either (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). The orientation of that stamp will determine the color of cell i.\n\nSo for example, if cell i's last stamp is (i-1, i) as BR, then cell i is R. If it's (i, i+1) as RB, then cell i is R. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf the last stamp covering cell i is (i-1, i), then that stamp's orientation could be BR (so i is R) or RB (so i is B). Or if the last stamp is (i, i+1), then the orientation could be BR (i is B) or RB (i is R).\n\nSo for each cell i, the possible colors are determined by which of the two possible stamps was last applied to it, and the orientation of that stamp.\n\nBut since the same stamp (pair) can be applied multiple times, the last application of that stamp is the one that determines the colors for the pair.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nLet's consider that each stamp (i, i+1) can be applied multiple times, but the last application's orientation determines the current colors of i and i+1.\n\nSo for the target string, each cell's color must be compatible with the orientation of the last stamp applied to it.\n\nFor example, for cell i, if the last stamp applied to it is (i-1, i), then the color of i is determined by the orientation of that stamp. If the last stamp is (i, i+1), then the color is determined by the orientation of that stamp.\n\nSo for each cell i (non-W), we need to determine which stamp (left or right) was the last to cover it, and what orientation that stamp was in.\n\nBut how can we model this across the entire string?\n\nLet's try to model this as a graph problem. For each position, the possible options are:\n\n- The last stamp covering it is the left pair (i-1, i) with either BR or RB.\n\n- The last stamp covering it is the right pair (i, i+1) with either BR or RB.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each stamp (i, i+1) can be the last one applied to both i and i+1. So, for the target colors, if we can find a sequence of stamps where for each pair (i, i+1) that is used last for both i and i+1, their orientation must set both colors correctly.\n\nSo the idea is to find a way to split the target into consecutive pairs, each of which is either BR or RB, such that each cell is part of exactly one pair (the last stamp applied to it). But since overlapping pairs are allowed, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a way to partition the string into non-overlapping segments, each of which can be covered by stamps applied in a certain way. But given that the stamps can be applied in any order, perhaps the problem can be transformed into checking for the possibility of the target string's colors under the constraints of the stamp orientations.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach cell must be covered by at least one stamp if it's not white. So any non-W cell must be part of at least one pair.\n\nBut even that's not necessarily true. For example, a cell could be part of two stamps, but the last stamp applied could be from one of the pairs.\n\nBut for a cell to be non-W, it must have at least one stamp applied to it (either left or right pair).\n\nNow, considering that the stamps can be applied in any order, but the last one applied to a pair determines the color.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to checking if the target can be formed by a set of non-overlapping stamps, but that's not the case. The example shows overlapping stamps can be used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a chain of dependencies.\n\nLet's think of the target string as being built from right to left or left to right, applying the necessary stamps.\n\nFor example, starting from the end, each pair of cells must have a certain orientation.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nLet's think of the problem in terms of the parity of the colors. For example, since each stamp can be applied multiple times, but each application sets the colors, the parity of the number of times a cell is stamped may not matter. Only the last application to each cell determines its color.\n\nSo for each cell, there are two possibilities for the last stamp that covers it: left (i-1, i) or right (i, i+1). Each possibility imposes a constraint on the color of the cell.\n\nLet me model this.\n\nFor cell i:\n\n- If the last stamp covering it is (i-1, i), then:\n\n   The stamp's orientation is either BR (so i is R) or RB (so i is B).\n\n   So the color of i must be R if the stamp was BR, or B if the stamp was RB.\n\n- If the last stamp covering it is (i, i+1), then:\n\n   The stamp's orientation is either BR (so i is B) or RB (so i is R).\n\nSo the color of i must be B if the stamp is BR, or R if the stamp is RB.\n\nSo for each cell i (non-W), the possible color depends on which of the two possible stamps was applied last, and the orientation of that stamp.\n\nBut the stamps are pairs; applying a stamp (i, i+1) affects both i and i+1. So if we choose to have the last stamp on i as (i, i+1), then that same stamp is the last one for i+1 as well (since (i, i+1) is the left pair for i+1? No, for i+1, the left pair is (i, i+1), and the right pair is (i+1, i+2). So if the last stamp for i is (i, i+1), then for i+1, the last stamp could be (i, i+1) or (i+1, i+2).\n\nThis is getting complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nLet's think of the problem in terms of transitions between cells. For each cell i, we can track the possible colors based on the last stamp applied.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nAlternative idea: For the entire string, split it into segments separated by W. For each such segment, check if it can be formed by a sequence of stamps. Also, each such segment must be of length \u2265 2, but that's not the case as the fifth test case example has a segment of length 3. Wait, but in that example, the entire string is BRB (no W), which is of length 3. So the length can be odd.\n\nSo the segments between W's can be of any length, but must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Split the target string into segments separated by W's. Each segment is a contiguous sequence of non-W characters.\n\n2. For each such segment, check if it is possible to form using the stamps.\n\n3. If all segments are possible and the W's are correctly placed (i.e., between segments, the W's are not covered by any stamps), then the answer is YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking each non-W segment.\n\nNow, the next step is to determine for a single non-W segment (like 'BRB', 'RBRB', etc.) whether it can be formed.\n\nSo let's focus on a single segment. For example, consider the segment 'BRB'.\n\nHow can this be formed?\n\nLooking at the fifth test case example: the process is to apply stamps in positions 2-3 (RB), then in positions 1-2 (BR). So the sequence is:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 BR B.\n\nSo the last stamps are for positions 1-2 (BR) and 2-3 (RB). But the colors are B R B.\n\nWait, after applying stamp 1-2 (BR), cells 1 and 2 become B and R. Then applying stamp 2-3 (RB), cells 2 and 3 become R and B. So the final string is B R B. But the problem is that cell 2 was part of two stamps. The last stamp applied to it is the stamp at 2-3 (RB), which sets it to R. So in this case, the segment 'BRB' is possible.\n\nBut how to model this for any segment.\n\nLet's consider that for a segment from position a to position b (inclusive), we need to cover all positions in a..b with stamps. Each stamp is applied to consecutive positions. Each application of a stamp sets the two cells to BR or RB.\n\nThe key observation is that for each position in the segment (except the first and last in the segment), there are two possible ways it can be covered: by the stamp to its left or the stamp to its right. For the first position in the segment, it must be covered by a stamp to the right (since there's nothing to the left in the segment). For the last position in the segment, it must be covered by a stamp to the left (since there's nothing to the right in the segment).\n\nWait, but the segment is part of the larger string. So the first position in the segment could be covered by a stamp from the left (if there is a previous cell in the string, but that cell is W, so the segment starts after a W). But in that case, the previous cell is W, which can't be part of any stamp. So in the segment, the first position must be covered by a stamp to the right (i.e., the stamp that covers the first and second positions of the segment). Similarly for the last position in the segment.\n\nSo within a segment, each cell (except possibly the first and last) can be covered by either the stamp to the left or the right. The first must be covered by the stamp to the right, the last by the stamp to the left.\n\nWait, but how can this be? Let's think of a segment of length 3: positions 1,2,3 (assuming 1-based). The stamps covering this segment could be (1-2), (2-3), etc. So the first cell (1) is covered by (1-2) stamp. The last cell (3) is covered by (2-3) stamp. The middle cell (2) is covered by both (1-2) and (2-3) stamps. So the last stamp applied to cell 2 would be either (1-2) or (2-3), depending on the order.\n\nBut for the entire segment to be covered, each cell must have at least one stamp applied to it. So the stamps must cover all cells in the segment.\n\nBut how to model the required patterns.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor a contiguous segment of non-W cells of length m, each cell must be covered by at least one stamp. So m must be \u2265 2 (since a single cell cannot be covered, but wait in the case of the fifth test case, m is 3, which is okay).\n\nWait, but in the fifth test case, the segment is of length 3, which is possible. So the length can be any \u22651? No, no. Because for a single cell, you can't apply a stamp. So in the problem statement, the second test case (probably n=1) returns NO. So the segments must be of length \u2265 2. Wait, but the fifth test case's segment is 3 cells. How?\n\nWait, the fifth test case's input is a string of length 3 with no W's. So the entire string is the segment. But the length is 3. How is that possible?\n\nBecause the stamps are applied to overlapping pairs. So the entire segment is covered by multiple stamps. But each cell must be covered by at least one stamp. For example, in a segment of length 3, you can apply stamps (1-2) and (2-3). But then the middle cell (2) is covered by both stamps. The last stamp applied to it determines its color.\n\nSo the problem for a segment of any length \u2265 2 is possible. But how to determine if the colors are possible.\n\nWait, but how do the colors of the segment relate to the possible stamps applied?\n\nLet's consider that the stamps can be applied in any order. The last stamp applied to each pair determines the colors of the cells in that pair.\n\nSo for a segment of length m \u2265 2:\n\nEach consecutive pair (i, i+1) can be stamped any number of times, but the last stamp applied to that pair determines the colors of i and i+1.\n\nThe stamps can overlap, so a single cell can be part of multiple pairs, but the last stamp that covers it (either from the left or right pair) determines its color.\n\nSo the problem for the segment is to find a way to assign to each pair (i, i+1) a possible orientation (BR or RB) such that for each cell in the segment, the last stamp that covers it (either from the left pair or right pair) results in the desired color.\n\nBut how can this be done?\n\nLet's model this. For each cell in the segment, the last stamp that covers it can be either:\n\n- The pair (i-1, i), which determines its color based on the orientation of that stamp.\n\nOR\n\n- The pair (i, i+1), which determines its color based on the orientation of that stamp.\n\nBut for the first cell of the segment, the last stamp must be (i, i+1), as there's no (i-1, i) pair in the segment (since the segment starts at i).\n\nFor the last cell of the segment, the last stamp must be (i-1, i), as there's no (i, i+1) pair in the segment.\n\nFor the middle cells, the last stamp can be either.\n\nSo the problem is to assign to each pair in the segment a orientation (BR or RB) such that:\n\nFor the first cell i: the pair (i, i+1) must be set such that the first cell's color matches the desired color.\n\nFor the last cell j: the pair (j-1, j) must be set such that the last cell's color matches the desired color.\n\nFor each middle cell k: either the pair (k-1, k) or (k, k+1) must be the last stamp, and their orientation must set the color of k to the desired value.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nLet's consider that the entire segment must be covered by a series of overlapping pairs, each with their orientations set such that the colors match.\n\nLet's take the example of 'BRB' (fifth test case). The segment is of length 3.\n\nThe first cell (B) is covered by pair (0,1) (assuming 0-based). The orientation of this pair is BR (so first cell is B, second R).\n\nThe second cell (R) is covered by pair (1,2). The orientation of this pair is RB (so first R, second B).\n\nSo the final colors are B (from the first pair's BR), R (from the second pair's RB) because the last stamp for the second cell is the second pair. So the first pair's BR makes the second cell R, but then the second pair's RB sets it to R again. Wait, no. The second pair's RB would set the second cell to B? Wait, the orientation RB is R and B. So the first cell in the pair (1,2) is R, the second is B. So after applying this stamp, the second cell becomes B. But in the example, the second cell is R.\n\nHmm, perhaps my model is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nIn the fifth test case example:\n\nOriginal: WWW.\n\nApply stamp on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters in 1-based) as RB \u2192 W RB \u2192 W R B.\n\nThen apply stamp on positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 BR B \u2192 B R B.\n\nSo the first stamp (positions 2-3) sets cells 2 and 3 to R and B. Then the second stamp (positions 1-2) sets cells 1 and 2 to B and R.\n\nSo the final colors are B, R, B.\n\nSo for cell 1: the last stamp is (1,2), orientation BR \u2192 cell1 is B.\n\nFor cell 2: the last stamp is (1,2), orientation BR \u2192 cell2 is R.\n\nFor cell3: the last stamp is (2,3), orientation RB \u2192 cell3 is B.\n\nSo each cell's last stamp is either their left or right pair.\n\nSo for the segment 'BRB', it's possible.\n\nSo how can we model this for any segment?\n\nAnother example: segment 'RBRB' of length 4.\n\nPossible stamps:\n\nApply stamp (0,1) as RB \u2192 R B, then (1,2) as BR \u2192 B R, then (2,3) as RB \u2192 R B. So the result is R B R B. But the desired is R B R B. So possible.\n\nAlternatively, other orders may also work.\n\nThe key is that for each pair (i, i+1), we can choose their orientation to set the colors.\n\nBut how to check this for a given segment.\n\nLet's think of the segment as a sequence of pairs and their orientations.\n\nBut how to determine if the colors can be achieved.\n\nAnother approach: For each position in the segment, the color depends on the last pair that covers it. So the first and last positions are fixed by their respective pairs, and the middle positions can be covered by either pair.\n\nSo for the first cell (i) of the segment, the last pair is (i, i+1), so its color is determined by the orientation of that pair. For example, if the orientation is BR, the first cell is B. If it's RB, the first cell is R.\n\nSimilarly, the last cell (j) of the segment is determined by the orientation of the pair (j-1, j). For example, if the orientation is BR, the last cell is R. If RB, then B.\n\nFor the middle cells, their color is determined by either the pair to the left or the pair to the right. For example, cell k can be covered by pair (k-1, k) or (k, k+1). So the color can be determined by either of those pairs, but they have to be compatible.\n\nSo, for the entire segment, the constraints are:\n\n1. The first pair's orientation must set the first cell's color correctly.\n\n2. The last pair's orientation must set the last cell's color correctly.\n\n3. For each middle cell, there exists a way to choose between the left or right pair's orientation such that the cell's color is correct.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's try to model this for a segment of length m:\n\npositions 0 to m-1 (0-based).\n\nFor position 0:\n\nmust be covered by pair (0, 1). The orientation of this pair is either BR or RB. So:\n\ns[0] must be equal to the first character of the pair's orientation.\n\nFor position m-1:\n\nmust be covered by pair (m-2, m-1). The orientation of this pair is either BR or RB. So s[m-1] must be equal to the second character of the pair's orientation.\n\nFor positions 1 to m-2:\n\nthe color s[i] can be set by either pair (i-1, i) or pair (i, i+1). So for each i from 1 to m-2:\n\nif the last pair covering i is (i-1, i), then s[i] must be the second character of that pair's orientation.\n\nif the last pair covering i is (i, i+1), then s[i] must be the first character of that pair's orientation.\n\nBut the pair's orientations are interdependent. For example, pair (i-1, i)'s orientation affects the color of i-1 and i. But pair (i, i+1) affects i and i+1.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem where we track possible orientations for each pair and see if the colors can be satisfied.\n\nBut for large m, this needs to be efficient.\n\nAlternative idea: For a segment to be possible, the first and last pairs must be compatible, and the colors in between must alternate in a way that allows adjacent pairs to have compatible orientations.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must start with a color that matches one of the possible orientations for the first pair, end with a color that matches one of the possible orientations for the last pair, and the middle pairs must alternate in a way that each successive pair's orientation is compatible.\n\nFor example, consider a segment 'BRB' (positions 0, 1, 2):\n\n- The first pair (0,1) can be BR (so 0 is B) or RB (so 0 is R). The desired first character is B, so the first pair must be BR.\n\n- The last pair (1,2) can be BR (so 2 is R) or RB (so 2 is B). The desired last character is B, so the last pair must be RB.\n\nSo the first pair is BR (0:B, 1:R), the last pair is RB (1:R, 2:B).\n\nNow, for position 1, which is covered by both pairs. The last stamp applied to position 1 is the last pair (1,2) (RB), which sets position 1 to R. This matches the desired color.\n\nSo in this case, the two pairs are BR and RB. The middle cell is covered by the last pair.\n\nThis works.\n\nAnother example: 'RBRB'.\n\nFirst pair (0,1) must be RB (R) or BR (B). Desired first is R, so pair must be RB.\n\nLast pair (3,4) (assuming length 4) must be BR (R) or RB (B). Desired last is B, so pair must be RB.\n\nNow, the middle pairs (1,2) and (2,3):\n\nFor position 1: covered by pairs (0,1) and (1,2). If the last is (1,2), then the orientation must have first character B (since desired s[1] is B). So pair (1,2) must be BR (B and R), but desired s[1] is B. Wait, the first character of (1,2) is B. So if the last stamp for position 1 is (1,2) as BR, then s[1] is B. But the first pair (0,1) RB sets s[1] to B as well. So perhaps the pair (1,2) is not needed. But in this case, the pairs must be applied in such a way that each cell's last stamp is considered.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let's think of another approach.\n\nSuppose we model the segment as follows:\n\nWe can choose the orientation of each pair (i, i+1) in the segment, but the last occurrence of each pair determines the color. However, this seems impossible to model for large m.\n\nAlternatively, we can think that each pair (i, i+1) must be set to an orientation that, when processed in some order, leaves the colors as desired. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the colors of the segment must alternate between B and R. For example, in a valid segment, the colors must alternate. But the fifth test case's segment is B R B, which does alternate. Another example is R B R B. But what about a segment like B B R? Can it be possible?\n\nWait, let's see. How can B B R be formed.\n\nAssuming the segment is of length 3: B B R.\n\nFirst pair (0,1) must be BR (B R) or RB (R B). But desired first two characters are B B. So if first pair is BR, then after applying, (0,1) is B R. Then, apply pair (0,1) again as BR: no change. Alternatively, apply pair (1,2) as BR, which would set 1 to B and 2 to R. So after first pair (0,1) as BR, the first two are B R. Then apply pair (1,2) as BR: cells 1 and 2 become B and R. So the final string is B B R. Yes. So this is possible.\n\nSo the colors don't need to alternate. So that idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. So what's the pattern here.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor a segment to be possible:\n\n1. The entire segment cannot contain any W's.\n\n2. The first and last characters must be compatible with some pair's orientation.\n\n3. For each pair of consecutive characters in the segment, there must exist at least one orientation of the pair that can produce them.\n\nWait, but consecutive pairs are interdependent. For example, for positions i and i+1:\n\nThe pair (i, i+1) can be BR or RB. So the two characters s[i] and s[i+1] must be either BR or RB.\n\nSo for any two consecutive characters in the segment, they must be either BR or RB.\n\nIf this is not the case, then the segment is impossible.\n\nWait, but in the fifth test case's segment 'BRB', the pairs are:\n\nB and R (BR), R and B (RB). So each consecutive pair is valid.\n\nIn the example of 'BBR', the pairs are BB (invalid), BR (valid). But in the way I thought earlier, this was possible.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, in the example where the segment is 'BBR' (B B R), the consecutive pairs are BB and BR. The BB pair is not BR or RB, so according to this approach, the segment is invalid. But earlier analysis suggests that it is possible.\n\nBut wait, according to the previous example:\n\nFirst pair (0,1) is BR (B R), so after stamp, cells 0 and 1 are B and R.\n\nThen pair (1,2) is BR (B R), which sets cells 1 and 2 to B and R.\n\nSo the final string is B B R.\n\nSo the consecutive pairs in the segment are B B and B R. But according to the proposed approach, the consecutive pairs must be BR or RB. But in this case, the first pair is BR (B R), then the pair (1,2) is BR (B R), which overwrites cells 1 and 2. So the final string is B B R.\n\nBut the consecutive characters B and B are not part of a stamp, but they are the result of overlapping stamps.\n\nSo the consecutive pairs in the target string are allowed to have any combination as long as they can be achieved by the stamps applied.\n\nThus, the initial idea that consecutive pairs in the target must be BR or RB is incorrect.\n\nSo this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. So I'm back to square one.\n\nAlternative idea: the stamps can be applied in any order, and each application overwrites the colors. So the final colors depend only on the last stamp applied to each pair.\n\nThus, the target string must be such that for each consecutive pair (i, i+1) in the target, either s[i] and s[i+1] match the orientation of some stamp applied to (i, i+1), or they are overwritten by a later stamp applied to (i-1, i) or (i+1, i+2), etc.\n\nBut this seems hard to model.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the target string by considering that each pair (i, i+1) can be either BR or RB, and these pairs must be chosen such that overlapping pairs agree on the colors of the overlapping cell.\n\nWait, this is similar to the problem of tiling dominoes with certain constraints.\n\nFor example, each pair (i, i+1) is assigned a direction (BR or RB). The color of cell i is determined by the pair (i, i+1) if it's the last stamp applied to i, or by pair (i-1, i) if that's the last stamp.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps each cell i's color is determined by exactly one pair: either (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). But for the first cell, it can only be (0, 1). For the last cell, it can only be (m-2, m-1) where m is the segment length.\n\nSo, for a segment of length m, we can model the possible pairs as follows:\n\nThe segment is valid if there exists a way to assign each cell i (except the last) to a pair (i, i+1) or (i-1, i) such that:\n\n- For the first cell, the pair is (0, 1), and its first character is s[0].\n\n- For the last cell, the pair is (m-2, m-1), and its second character is s[m-1].\n\n- For each middle cell i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m-2), either:\n\n   a) It is covered by pair (i-1, i), and its second character is s[i].\n\n   OR\n\n   b) It is covered by pair (i, i+1), and its first character is s[i].\n\nMoreover, the pairs must be consecutive and cover all cells.\n\nThis is similar to a domino tiling problem where each domino (pair) can be oriented in two ways, and each cell (except the first and last) must be covered by exactly one domino.\n\nBut since each pair (i, i+1) can be used multiple times, but the last application determines the colors, it's possible to model this as a tiling where each cell is covered by exactly one pair (the last pair that covers it).\n\nSo for the segment to be valid, there must exist a way to select pairs such that:\n\n- Each cell is covered by exactly one pair (the last one applied to it).\n\n- The first pair is (0, 1) and has s[0] as its first character.\n\n- The last pair is (m-2, m-1) and has s[m-1] as its second character.\n\n- For each pair (i, i+1) selected, the first character is s[i], and the second is s[i+1] according to the chosen orientation.\n\nWait, no. Because the pair (i, i+1) can be either BR or RB. So for the pair (i, i+1), if it's selected as the last pair covering i and i+1, then the colors of i and i+1 must be the first and second characters of the pair's orientation, respectively.\n\nSo, for each pair (i, i+1) in the selected set, the orientation must be such that:\n\ns[i] == orientation[0]\n\ns[i+1] == orientation[1]\n\nBut how can we ensure that all pairs in the selected set agree on their overlapping cells?\n\nFor example, if pair (0,1) is chosen as BR, then s[0] is B and s[1] is R. Then pair (1,2) must be chosen such that s[1] is R, which could be RB (R and B) or BR (B and R). But wait, if pair (1,2) is chosen as RB, then the orientation is R and B. So s[1] would be R (first character of the pair's orientation). But this would require that the last pair applied to cell 1 is (1,2) as RB.\n\nBut in this case, the previous pair (0,1) was applied, but if the pair (1,2) is applied after, then cell 1's color is set to R by the pair (1,2) as RB.\n\nSo the overlapping is allowed as long as each cell is covered by exactly one pair in the selected set.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a set of pairs that cover all cells in the segment, each pair's orientation matches the desired characters, and each cell is covered by exactly one pair (except for the last pair's second cell).\n\nWait, but each pair covers two cells. So the selected pairs must form a partition of the segment into non-overlapping pairs. But this can't be, because in the fifth test case example, the pairs are (0,1) and (1,2), which overlap. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, the selected pairs can be overlapping, but each cell is covered by exactly one pair in the selected set. This is impossible because if two pairs overlap, they share a cell which would be covered by two pairs.\n\nThus, this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Each cell must be covered by exactly one pair, but pairs can overlap. So for example, in the fifth test case, the pairs (0,1) and (1,2) are chosen. But cell 1 is covered by both pairs. So this approach is invalid.\n\nThus, I'm stuck.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe key observation is that the parity of the number of times a cell is stamped does not matter, but the last stamp applied to it determines its color.\n\nBut since each stamp is applied to two cells, the stamps must form a way to cover the cells such that each non-W cell is covered by at least one stamp, and the last stamp applied to it gives the correct color.\n\nSo for a segment of non-W cells, the following must hold:\n\n1. The length is at least 1. Wait, no. If the length is 1, then it's impossible. So any segment of length 1 is invalid.\n\nSo first step: Check that all segments have length \u2265 2. If any segment has length 1, return NO.\n\nSo for the problem:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Split the string into segments separated by W's.\n\n- For each segment:\n\n   - If the segment's length is 1: return NO.\n\n   - Else: Check if the segment can be formed.\n\n- Also, check that the entire string's W's are not covered by any stamp. (But since the segments are separated by W's, that's already handled.)\n\nSo the main problem is to check each segment.\n\nNow, how to check a segment of length \u2265 2.\n\nThe key insight from the problem examples and the earlier analysis is that for a segment to be possible, the first and last characters must be compatible with being the endpoints of their respective pairs. For example, the first character must be the first character of the first pair (i, i+1), and the last character must be the second character of the last pair (j-1, j).\n\nBut how to ensure that the entire segment can be covered by a sequence of overlapping pairs such that each pair's orientation matches the desired colors.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe segment can be valid if and only if the first two characters are either BR or RB, and the last two characters are either BR or RB, and for the entire segment, each pair of consecutive characters must be either BR or RB.\n\nBut this is not true. For example, the fifth test case's segment is BRB. The consecutive pairs are BR, RB. Both are valid. So this segment is possible. But if there's a segment where consecutive pairs are not BR or RB, such as BB, it's possible by overlapping stamps.\n\nBut in the case of BB:\n\nFirst apply stamp (0,1) as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThen apply stamp (0,1) again as BR \u2192 B R. No change.\n\nAlternatively, apply stamp (0,1) as BR and then stamp (0,1) as RB \u2192 R B. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but to get BB, perhaps you can apply stamp (0,1) as BR (B R), then apply stamp (1,2) as BR (B R). But in that case, the final string would be B B R.\n\nNo. Unless there's a way to apply stamps in a way that overwrites previous colors.\n\nWait, let's take BB as a segment of length 2.\n\nTo get BB, the pairs must be:\n\nThe only possible pair is (0,1). But the pair can be BR or RB. So the possible pairs are BR (B R) or RB (R B). Neither of which gives BB. So it's impossible. So any segment of length 2 with two B's or two R's is impossible.\n\nThus, the consecutive characters in the segment must form either BR or RB for each pair. So for a segment to be possible, every consecutive pair of characters must be either BR or RB. And also, the first and last pairs must be compatible.\n\nBut this is only possible if the entire segment has alternating colors. For example, BRB is BR followed by RB, which are both valid pairs.\n\nBut in this case, the segment length is 3, which is odd. But it's possible.\n\nSo the conditions for a segment are:\n\n- The segment must have a length of at least 2.\n\n- Every consecutive pair of characters in the segment must be either BR or RB.\n\n- The first pair must have a first character matching the first character of the segment.\n\n- The last pair must have a second character matching the last character of the segment.\n\nWait, this is redundant because the first pair's first character is the first character of the segment, and the last pair's second character is the last character of the segment.\n\nSo the main condition is that every consecutive pair in the segment is either BR or RB.\n\nSo for example, the segment BRB has consecutive pairs BR and RB, which are valid. So it is possible.\n\nThe segment BBR has pairs BB and BR. The BB pair is invalid. So the segment is impossible.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example where the segment was BBR, it was possible by applying stamps in a way that overwrites the middle cell.\n\nBut according to this condition, it's impossible. So there's a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the earlier example's analysis was incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the BBR case.\n\nSegment is B B R.\n\nIf consecutive pairs must be BR or RB, then BB is invalid. So the segment is impossible.\n\nBut earlier thinking suggested that it's possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in that analysis.\n\nLet's re-examine:\n\nOriginal: WWW.\n\nApply stamp on (0,1) as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nThen apply stamp on (1,2) as BR \u2192 B becomes B R \u2192 then the stamp on (1,2) as BR sets 1 to B and 2 to R.\n\nSo the final string is B B R.\n\nSo the consecutive pairs are BB and BR. The BB pair is invalid. So according to the condition, the segment is impossible, but according to the stamp applications, it's possible.\n\nThus, the condition is incorrect.\n\nSo this indicates that the consecutive pair condition is not a valid one.\n\nHmm. So there's a flaw in the earlier reasoning.\n\nIn the example, the segment is B B R, which has consecutive pairs BB and BR. According to the condition, the segment is invalid, but according to the stamp applications, it's possible.\n\nSo the condition is incorrect.\n\nThus, the consecutive pair condition is not the correct approach.\n\nSo I'm back to square one.\n\nAnother Idea: Since each stamp application sets the two cells to their orientation's colors, the final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp applied to that cell. So for the entire segment, we need to model the last stamp applied to each cell.\n\nFor each cell i in the segment:\n\n- If i is the first cell: it's only covered by the stamp (0,1). The orientation of this stamp must have the first character as s[0].\n\n- If i is the last cell: it's only covered by the stamp (m-2, m-1). The orientation of this stamp must have the second character as s[m-1].\n\n- For other cells (0 < i < m-1):\n\n   The cell can be covered by either the stamp (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). The last of these two stamps determines the cell's color.\n\nSo for cell i, if the last stamp covering it is (i-1, i), then the orientation of that stamp must have the second character as s[i]. \n\nIf the last stamp is (i, i+1), then the orientation must have the first character as s[i].\n\nSo for the entire segment, we need to select for each cell (except the first and last) which stamp (left or right) is the last, and ensure that the orientations of those stamps are compatible.\n\nThis can be modeled as follows:\n\nWe can represent the choices for each cell as a graph, where for each cell i, we have two possible options (left or right), and the orientations of the stamps must be compatible with the neighboring cells.\n\nBut for large m, this is not feasible. So there's a need for an efficient way to check this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can greedily determine the orientations of the stamps.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart from the left, and for each pair (i, i+1), determine the orientation based on the current cell's color and the next cell's color.\n\nBut this might not work if later choices affect earlier ones.\n\nAlternatively, we can use dynamic programming to track the possible orientations of the last stamp applied to each cell.\n\nLet's consider dynamic programming for the segment.\n\nWe can define dp[i][o], where o is the orientation of the pair (i-1, i) (if o is 'left') or (i, i+1) (if o is 'right'). The value is True if it's possible to reach cell i with the given orientation.\n\nBut this may not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell i, track the possible orientations of the stamps that could have been applied to it.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe entire segment must be such that the first character is B or R, and the last character is B or R. But how to connect them.\n\nPerhaps the segment must start and end with the same color. For example, the fifth test case starts with B and ends with B. Another example, 'RBRB' starts and ends with R and B. So this is not a requirement.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe key is that the first and last pairs must be compatible, and the middle pairs must allow for a chain of compatible orientations.\n\nFor example, the first pair's orientation is determined by the first cell's color. The next pair's orientation must be compatible with the previous pair's orientation.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think of the first pair (0,1) must have orientation such that s[0] is the first character. So the first pair is either BR or RB, depending on s[0].\n\nThen, the second pair (1,2) must have orientation such that if the last stamp applied to cell 1 is (1,2), then the first character of this pair's orientation must be s[1]. Alternatively, if the last stamp applied to cell 1 is (0,1), then the second character of this pair's orientation must be s[1].\n\nBut this is interdependent.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the possible orientations for each pair in sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart with pair (0,1), which must be oriented as s[0] followed by either R or B (depending on s[1]).\n\nThen, for pair (1,2), the orientation must be such that the first character is s[1], if the last stamp for cell 1 is (1,2), or the second character of pair (0,1) is s[1], if the last stamp for cell 1 is (0,1).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nThis seems like a chain of possibilities.\n\nLet's try to model this for the fifth test case:\n\nSegment 'BRB' (indices 0, 1, 2).\n\n- Pair (0,1) must start with B. So orientation is BR (B R) or RB (R B) -> but first character must be B. So only BR is possible.\n\n- Pair (0,1) is BR, so s[0] is B and s[1] is R.\n\n- Now, for cell 1, the last stamp can be pair (0,1) or (1,2).\n\nIf the last stamp for cell 1 is (0,1), then s[1] must be R (the second character of BR), which matches.\n\nIf the last stamp for cell 1 is (1,2), then the first character of the pair's orientation must be R.\n\nSo pair (1,2) can be RB (R B) or BR (B R). But to have s[1] = R, the pair must be RB.\n\nIf pair (1,2) is RB, then s[2] is B.\n\nWhich matches the desired B.\n\nSo this works.\n\nSo the pairs are (0,1) as BR and (1,2) as RB.\n\nThus, the entire segment is valid.\n\nAnother example: 'BBR' (indices 0, 1, 2).\n\n- Pair (0,1) must start with B. So orientation is BR (B R) or RB (R B) -> only BR possible.\n\n- Pair (0,1) is BR, so s[0] = B, s[1] = R.\n\n- For cell 1, last stamp can be (0,1) or (1,2).\n\nIf last stamp is (0,1), then s[1] is R. But desired is B. So this is invalid.\n\nThus, the last stamp for cell 1 must be (1,2).\n\n- So pair (1,2) must have first character B (s[1] = B).\n\nSo pair (1,2) can be BR (B R) or RB (R B). But first character must be B. So orientation is BR.\n\n- Thus, pair (1,2) is BR, so s[2] = R.\n\nBut desired is R. So this works.\n\nThus, the final colors are B (from pair 0,1) and R (from pair 1,2). But the desired segment is B B R. So the second cell is R, but desired is B. So this is invalid.\n\nThus, the segment BBR is impossible.\n\nThis aligns with the consecutive pairs condition, but contradicts the previous example.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to model the segment as follows:\n\nFor each possible orientation of the first pair, check if the rest of the segment can be formed by choosing orientations of subsequent pairs such that each cell's color is determined by the last pair covering it.\n\nThis can be done greedily.\n\nSo, the algorithm for a segment is:\n\n1. Check if the segment length is 1. If yes, return NO.\n\n2. Check if the first character is W or the last is W. Since the segment is non-W, this is impossible.\n\n3. For the first pair (0,1), there are two possible orientations (BR or RB), but it must match the first character. So:\n\n   a. If s[0] is B, the first pair must be BR.\n\n   b. If s[0] is R, the first pair must be RB.\n\n   So only one possible orientation for the first pair.\n\n4. Proceed through the segment, greedily determining the possible orientations of the next pairs based on the current cell's desired color.\n\n5. For each subsequent pair (i, i+1), determine the orientation based on the desired color of cell i and i+1.\n\nBut this may not work, as overlapping pairs can affect previous cells.\n\nAlternatively, the following algorithm:\n\nFor the segment, simulate the application of stamps from left to right, choosing the orientation of each pair to match the desired colors.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, iterate through the segment from left to right, determining for each pair (i, i+1) its orientation based on the desired colors.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The first pair (0,1) must have orientation s[0] followed by s[1], but only if s[0] and s[1] form BR or RB.\n\n- If not, then it's impossible.\n\nBut this is similar to the consecutive pairs approach, which we saw earlier is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, in the fifth test case, the consecutive pairs are BR and RB, which are valid. So this approach would return YES.\n\nIn the example of 'BBR', the consecutive pairs are BB and BR. BB is invalid, so returns NO.\n\nBut earlier example where 'BBR' is possible, but according to this approach, it's impossible. But according to the analysis, 'BBR' is impossible.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping stamps.\n\nSo, for a segment to be valid, the consecutive pairs must be BR or RB. Because each pair (i, i+1) must be stamped once in the correct orientation to set s[i] and s[i+1].\n\nThis approach would require that every consecutive pair in the segment is either BR or RB.\n\nBut the fifth test case's segment 'BRB' has consecutive pairs BR and RB, which are valid. So returns YES.\n\nThe example 'BBR' has consecutive pairs BB (invalid) and BR (valid). So returns NO.\n\nThus, this approach may be correct.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nBecause each pair (i, i+1) must be stamped in the correct orientation to set s[i] and s[i+1]. If this is not possible for any pair, the segment is invalid.\n\nBut in the case where overlapping stamps are used, the consecutive pairs may not match the stamp orientations. But according to this approach, it's required that the consecutive pairs are valid.\n\nThus, this approach may be correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each segment:\n\n- If the segment's length is 1: return NO.\n\n- Check that every consecutive pair of characters in the segment is either BR or RB.\n\n- Also, check that the first and last characters of the segment are not W.\n\nIf all conditions are met, return YES for the segment. Else, NO.\n\nThus, this is the approach.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nTest case fifth example: 'BRB' has consecutive pairs BR and RB \u2192 valid. So returns YES.\n\nTest case 'BBR': consecutive pairs BB (invalid) \u2192 returns NO.\n\nTest case 'B R B' \u2192 consecutive pairs BR, RB \u2192 valid. Returns YES.\n\nTest case 'BRRB' \u2192 consecutive pairs BR, RR, RB \u2192 RR is invalid. Returns NO.\n\nThus, this approach seems correct.\n\nBut what about a segment like 'RBRB'? Consecutive pairs are RB, BR, RB \u2192 all valid. So returns YES.\n\nThus, the algorithm would return YES for such cases.\n\nBut what about a segment where the consecutive pairs are all valid but the first and last pairs' orientations are not compatible.\n\nFor example, segment 'RBR' (R B R):\n\nConsecutive pairs RB, BR, R (invalid, but the length is 3. Wait, the consecutive pairs are RB, BR. So for a segment of length 3, consecutive pairs are 0-1 and 1-2.\n\nRB and BR are both valid. So returns YES.\n\nThe first pair must be RB (since s[0] is R). The second pair (1-2) must be BR (B R). But s[2] is R. So the second pair's orientation is BR, which sets s[2] to R. So yes.\n\nSo the segment is valid.\n\nThus, this approach works.\n\nThus, the algorithm for the segment is:\n\n1. Check if the segment has length 1 \u2192 NO.\n\n2. Check if any consecutive pair of characters is not BR or RB \u2192 NO.\n\n3. Else, YES.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nThe steps for the entire problem are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Split the string into segments separated by W's.\n\n- For each segment:\n\n   - If length is 1 \u2192 answer is NO.\n\n   - Else, check all consecutive pairs in the segment. If any pair is not BR or RB \u2192 answer is NO.\n\n- If all segments pass the checks \u2192 answer is YES.\n\n- Also, the entire string's W's must not be covered by any stamp (but since they are in their own segments, this is handled automatically).\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n and s.\n\n   Split s into segments separated by 'W's.\n\n   For each segment:\n\n      if len(segment) == 0:\n\n          continue\n\n      if len(segment) == 1:\n\n          return NO.\n\n      for i in range(len(segment)-1):\n\n          pair = segment[i] + segment[i+1]\n\n          if pair not in ['BR', 'RB']:\n\n              return NO.\n\n   return YES.\n\nBut wait, the code should return YES if all segments are valid.\n\nSo the code in Python would look something like:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   n = int(input())\n\n   s = input().strip()\n\n   valid = True\n\n   segments = s.split('W')\n\n   for seg in segments:\n\n      if not seg:\n\n          continue\n\n      if len(seg) == 1:\n\n          valid = False\n\n          break\n\n      for i in range(len(seg)-1):\n\n          pair = seg[i] + seg[i+1]\n\n          if pair not in ('BR', 'RB'):\n\n              valid = False\n\n              break\n\n      if not valid:\n\n          break\n\n   print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut wait, this approach may have a mistake.\n\nBecause the segments are created by splitting on 'W's. For example, if the string is 'RBWBR', the segments are ['RB', 'BR'].\n\nEach of these segments must be checked.\n\nBut what about the case where the segment is 'RWB'? Then the segments are ['R', 'B'], each of length 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly returns NO.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'RWWB'? Then segments are ['R', 'B'], which are invalid.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nBut what about the fifth test case example: 'BRB' \u2192 segments is ['BRB'] \u2192 len 3.\n\nCheck each consecutive pair: 'BR', 'RB' \u2192 both valid. So returns YES.\n\nAnother example: 'BBR' \u2192 segments ['BBR'] \u2192 len 3. Pairs 'BB' and 'BR' \u2192 'BB' is invalid \u2192 returns NO.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut what about the example where a segment is 'RBRB'? The consecutive pairs are 'RB', 'BR', 'RB' \u2192 all valid. So returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: 'BRBR' \u2192 pairs 'BR', 'RB', 'BR' \u2192 valid.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nSo the missing code in the provided code snippet is to implement this logic.\n\nThe given code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code reads the input lines, skips the first line (t), and then takes every other line starting from the second line (test cases), which are the n and s lines.\n\nWait, the code for reading input is a bit tricky. Let me see.\n\nThe input format is:\n\nt\n\nn\n\ns\n\nn\n\ns\n\n...\n\nSo for each test case, there are two lines: n and s.\n\nThe code [*open(0)][2::2] selects all the lines starting from index 2 (after the first two lines) and takes every second line. But the first line after the first two is the third line (index 2 in 0-based), which is the first test case's s. Then the fifth line (index 4), which is the second test case's s, etc.\n\nSo the code is reading all the s lines of the test cases. Then, for each s, it's supposed to process it.\n\nThus, the code needs to read each s and determine whether it's possible.\n\nSo the code would process each s in the test cases and for each, split into segments, check as above.\n\nThus, the missing code would be:\n\nFor each s:\n\n   valid = True\n\n   for each segment in s.split('W'):\n\n      if len(segment) == 1:\n\n          valid = False\n\n          break\n\n      for i in range(len(segment)-1):\n\n          if segment[i:i+2] not in {'BR', 'RB'}:\n\n              valid = False\n\n              break\n\n      if not valid:\n\n          break\n\n   print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut this needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut also, note that a segment can be empty (if the string starts or ends with W, or has consecutive W's), but in s.split('W'), empty strings are included. So we need to skip them.\n\nThus, the code in Python would be:\n\nfor s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for part in s.split('W'):\n\n        if not part:\n\n            continue\n\n        if len(part) == 1:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n        for i in range(len(part)-1):\n\n            if part[i:i+2] not in ('BR', 'RB'):\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut this code has a potential issue: when the entire string is made of W's (like 'WWW'), then all parts are empty, so valid remains True, but the answer should be YES (since zero stamps are applied).\n\nYes, because zero stamps are allowed. So if the string is all W's, then it's possible (output YES).\n\nBut according to the code, when all parts are empty, the code proceeds to print YES.\n\nSo the code handles that case.\n\nAnother case: n=1. For example, s is 'R' \u2192 split into ['', 'R', ''] \u2192 part 'R' \u2192 len is 1 \u2192 valid is False \u2192 output NO.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is the code inside the loop that checks each segment."
