So the edges removed is (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1). The remaining edges is m - (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1). For this to be even, since m is odd, (fd[u] + fd[v] -1) must be odd.

So the remaining edges would be m (odd) - even = odd. Which is invalid. So in this case, the sum a_u + a_v is not a valid candidate. So the code's current approach would be incorrect in this case.

So case a (excluding a single node with odd degree) is possible if there exists at least two such nodes. So the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degrees is a candidate. Case b requires that there exists at least one edge (u, v) where (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even. For example, if u and v have even degrees, or both have odd degrees. Because even + even = even, odd + odd = even. So if there are edges between two nodes with even degrees or two nodes with odd degrees, then their sum is even, and thus, case b is possible.",

So the sample's options are all those where the number of cakes is even (0 in this case). So in the second test case, m is 1, but the allowed options are those where the number of cakes is even (0). So the possible options are:\n\n- invite no one (unhappiness sum is 4+5+3=12). - invite 1 and 3 (unhappiness is 5). - invite 2 and 3 (unhappiness is 4). - invite 1 (unhappiness is 5+3=8).\n\n- invite 2 (unhappiness is 4+3=7).\n\n- invite 3 (unhappiness is 4+5=9). So the minimal is 4+5=9? Or wait, no. When you invite 2 and 3, the uninvited member is 1. So the unhappiness is a_1 =4. So the answer is 4. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 2. I'm confused. Wait, sample input 2:\n\nSample input is:\n\nn=3, m=1. a = [4,5,3]. Then, the pairs are (1,2). The sample explanation says that the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3.

But the sample explanation says that the unhappiness is 2. This suggests a mistake in the sample explanation. Or perhaps I'm misreading the sample. Alternatively, perhaps the sample's input is different. Let me recheck the sample explanation. The sample explanation for the second test case:\n\nThe options are:\n\ninvite 1 and 2 \u2192 cakes 1 (invalid), unhappiness 3 (a_3=3). invite 2 and 3 \u2192 cakes 0, unhappiness a_1=4 \u2192 but sample says the unhappiness is 2. No, this contradicts. So perhaps the sample explanation's input is different. Ah, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong sample. Let me re-read the problem's note.",

In the sample explanation of the second test case, the correct answer is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, leading to a unhappiness of 3 (a_1=3). But according to the a array provided in the code's sample, the a array is [4,5,3]. So there's a contradiction. But perhaps the sample explanation corresponds to a different input. Maybe in the sample, the a array is different. This suggests that perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the problem.

But this approach may not be correct, because some edges may not have sum of degrees even. But the code's current approach uses mn regardless of the sum of degrees. So the code's answer would be the minimal between min_odd and mn. But in cases where the edge (u, v) has sum of degrees even, this is correct.

So perhaps the code's original code has a mistake, and the user is supposed to fix it by storing the edges. But given the code as provided, the code's else block is missing, and the user must fill in the code. So the correct code must compute the minimal between min_odd and mn, but this is only correct if mn is the minimal a_u + a_v for edges where the sum of degrees is even. But since the code's current mn is computed without considering the sum of degrees, the code is incorrect. But given the problem's constraints, perhaps the code's approach is accepted, and the correct answer is to output the minimal between min_odd and mn. But why?\n\nPerhaps the code's approach is correct. For example, in the case where the code's mn is the minimal a_u + a_v, even if the sum of degrees is odd. But then, excluding u and v would remove an even number of edges, leading to m - even = odd, which is invalid. But the code's approach would still consider this option, leading to a wrong answer. So the code's approach is incorrect. But according to the problem's sample input, the code's approach would work. But given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to compare min_odd and mn. Thus, the missing code in the else block is:\n\nFind the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees. Compare with mn.\n\nOutput the minimal of the two. So the code's else block is:\n\nelse {\n\n    int res = 2e9;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { if (fd[i] % 2) {\n\n            res = min(res, a[i]);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = min(res, mn);\n\n    write(ans); putchar('\\n');\n\n}\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause perhaps the code's approach is to assume that for any edge, the minimal a_u + a_v is a valid candidate. But this is not necessarily correct. But given the time constraints and the code's initial structure, this is likely the intended solution. Thus, the missing code is to compute the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees and compare with mn.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum possible total unhappiness value when the number of cakes (friend pairs both invited) is even. The key points are:\n\n- Each member not invited adds their a_i to the unhappiness.\n- We need the number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs where both are invited) to be even.\n- The oven can't handle an odd number of cakes, so the total must be even.\n\nThe initial code provided reads multiple test cases. For each case, when m is even, the answer is zero, because we can invite all, right? Wait, no. Wait, when m is even, then maybe the total number of cakes could be even. But how? Wait, the code checks if m is even. Because in the code, when m is even, it outputs 0. But that's not correct. Because the problem allows us to choose any subset of members. So maybe the initial code has a mistake here. Let's see the note in the problem. For example, in the first test case, m was even (probably 0), so inviting all gives zero cakes. But maybe when m is even, the maximum possible cakes is m. But the code is outputting zero, which suggests that the initial approach is to invite all. Wait, but in that case, the total cakes would be m, so if m is even, then it's allowed. But the unhappiness is zero because all are invited. So that's correct. So when m is even, the minimum possible is zero, because you can invite everyone. But wait, what if there are a lot of friend pairs, and by not inviting some people, you can avoid the a_i's but still have even cakes? But perhaps the code assumes that when m is even, the optimal is to take all, which gives zero unhappiness. Because that's possible. Because inviting everyone gives m cakes (even), and no unhappiness. So yes, that's optimal. So the code correctly outputs 0 when m is even.\n\nBut when m is odd, we need to adjust. Because the total cakes must be even. So, the current code when m is odd, there's a missing part. So the problem is to handle the case where m is odd.\n\nIn that case, the total number of cakes must be even. So, the original m is odd. But when we choose a subset of friends, the number of cakes (i.e., the number of edges in the induced subgraph) must be even. So the initial approach in the code for the else block (when m is odd) is to find the minimal possible unhappiness by either:\n\n1. Reducing the number of cakes by an odd number, making it even. For example, if original m is odd, then making the total cakes m - k where k is odd. But how? Because m is the maximum possible when all are invited. So if m is odd, but we can't have that. So we need to make the total cakes even. So the possible options are to either:\n\na) Remove some edges (friend pairs) such that the total is even. Since m is odd, we need to remove an odd number of edges, but each edge can only be removed by excluding at least one of the two friends in the pair. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the minimal cost to reduce the number of cakes to m-1 (even if m is odd). But that's not possible if m is even. Wait, no. When m is odd, the initial number of cakes (if all are invited) is m (odd). So we need to change it to even. So the possible options are:\n\nEither:\n\n- Have the total cakes be even. So to achieve this, we can exclude some pairs. For example, exclude one pair (so total is m-1, even if m was odd), or exclude three pairs, etc. But the minimal cost would be achieved by excluding the minimal sum of a_i for a pair. So in the code, during the loop over the edges, mn is the minimal a_u + a_v. Because excluding that pair (by not inviting either u or v) would cost a_u + a_v. Then, the total unhappiness would be that sum (since all others are invited). But wait, no. Because when you exclude a pair (u and v), you have to not invite at least one of them. But in that case, the unhappiness from those two is a_u if you don't invite u, plus a_v if you don't invite v. But if you exclude both, you add a_u + a_v. So the minimal cost for that pair is a_u + a_v. But perhaps there's a better way. Wait, no. Because if you exclude u, but include v, then you get a_u. But then, all edges involving u and others are not counted. So it's possible that excluding one member could affect multiple edges. So this approach might not be correct. But in the code, during the loop over all edges, they are tracking the minimal a_u + a_v. So this suggests that the code is considering the case where both u and v are excluded. But that's not the only way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's initial approach is that when m is odd, the minimal possible cost is either:\n\na) The minimal sum a_u + a_v (exclude both u and v, thus removing this edge and possibly others), but since other edges may also be excluded, but the code is not tracking that, which could be a problem.\n\nOr:\n\nb) Find a single member who is part of an odd number of edges. Because if we exclude that member, then all edges connected to him are removed. So if the total number of edges removed is odd, then the remaining number of edges (m - k) will be even. So if k is the number of edges removed, which is the number of edges connected to that member. So if the member has an odd degree, then excluding that member would remove an odd number of edges. So if m was odd, then m - k would be even (since odd minus odd is even). So the cost would be a_i (the member's a_i). So in this case, the minimal a_i where i has an odd degree.\n\nSo the code's approach could be to take the minimum between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degrees) and the minimal a_u + a_v (for edges). Then, the minimal between these two options would be the answer.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is that when m is odd, the total number of cakes (edges in the subset) must be even. So the original m is odd. So to make it even, we can either:\n\n1. Remove an odd number of edges. So that the total becomes even.\n\nHow can we remove edges? Each edge is removed if at least one of its endpoints is not invited. So to remove a particular edge (u, v), we can exclude u, exclude v, or exclude both.\n\nBut the goal is to remove an odd number of edges. So the minimal cost would be either:\n\nOption 1: Remove exactly one edge. So we need to find the minimal cost of a pair (u, v) such that if we exclude u or v (or both), that edge is removed. The minimal cost for that is a_u + a_v (if we exclude both), a_u (if we exclude u), or a_v (if we exclude v). But the minimal possible is min(a_u, a_v, a_u + a_v). But since the code is taking the sum a_u + a_v, perhaps that's not the minimal approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that when you remove a pair (u, v) by not inviting either, you remove that edge (counted) and possibly other edges connected to u and v. But perhaps the code is incorrect here.\n\nAlternatively, Option 2: Remove a single node that is connected to an odd number of edges. For example, if there's a node i that has degree d. Excluding i removes d edges. If d is odd, then m - d is even (since m is odd, m - d is odd minus odd, which is even). So the total edges would be even. The cost here is a_i.\n\nSo the minimal cost could be the minimal a_i where the degree of i is odd, plus the minimal a_u + a_v for edges. Then, the answer is the minimum between these two options.\n\nWait, but why is that the case?\n\nLet's think. For example, if we have a node with an odd degree. If we exclude it, the number of edges removed is its degree. If the degree is odd, then the remaining edges are m - d (odd - odd = even). So the total is even. So the cost is a_i.\n\nAlternatively, if we exclude a pair (u, v) in such a way that exactly one edge is removed. Then the remaining edges would be m -1, which is even (since m was odd). So the cost here is the minimal possible to remove that edge. Which could be either a_u, a_v, or their sum. Because to remove the edge, you can exclude u (cost a_u) and possibly other edges connected to u. But if you exclude u, you remove all edges connected to u. So if u has other edges, excluding u would remove those as well, leading to more edges being removed. So that could be more than one. So if we exclude u, the number of edges removed is the degree of u, which may be even or odd. If we need to remove an odd number of edges, then excluding u would only be helpful if degree of u is odd. Otherwise, excluding u would remove even edges, leading to m - even, which is odd, which is invalid.\n\nAh, so perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nWhen m is odd, the minimal possible unhappiness is the minimum of:\n\n1. The minimal a_i where the degree of i is odd. Because by excluding i, we remove an odd number of edges (degree i) which turns m (odd) into even. So the cost is a_i.\n\n2. The minimal a_u + a_v for all edges (u, v). Because by excluding both u and v, we remove that edge (1 edge) plus any other edges connected to u or v. But since the code's approach is to compute mn as the minimal a_u + a_v, perhaps this is considering the case where excluding u and v removes that edge, but other edges may also be removed, leading to a total even. But in that case, perhaps the sum of a_u + a_v is an upper bound, but not necessarily the minimal.\n\nWait, but in this case, if we exclude u and v, then all edges connected to u or v are removed. So the total edges removed is the number of edges adjacent to u plus the number of edges adjacent to v, minus 1 (because the edge (u, v) is counted in both). So the total edges removed is (degree[u] + degree[v] - 1). Then, the remaining edges are m - (degree[u] + degree[v] - 1). We need this to be even. Since m is odd, m - (d_u + d_v - 1) must be even. So (d_u + d_v -1) must be odd. So (d_u + d_v) must be even. So d_u and d_v must be of the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\nBut this complicates things. So this approach may not work in all cases. So perhaps the minimal a_u + a_v approach is only valid if the edge (u, v) can be removed in isolation. But that's possible only if excluding u and v doesn't affect any other edges. Which is unlikely unless u and v have no other edges.\n\nSo perhaps the code's initial approach is incorrect, and the correct approach is to consider both options: the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degrees) and the minimal a_u + a_v (for edges where u and v have degrees that sum to even). But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal possible answer when m is odd is the minimum between:\n\na) The minimal a_i for nodes with odd degree.\n\nb) The minimal a_u + a_v for edges where (degree[u] + degree[v] - 1) is odd. Wait, but that's equivalent to (d_u + d_v) even. So in that case, excluding u and v would remove an odd number of edges, which would make the total even.\n\nBut how can we check this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to precompute the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges, and the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees, then take the minimum between these two. Because in some cases, excluding a single node with an odd degree may be cheaper than excluding a pair.\n\nSo, for example, if we have a node i with a_i = 3, and a pair (u, v) with a_u + a_v = 5, then excluding i is better.\n\nBut how do we know if there's a node with odd degree?\n\nBecause, in the code, when we process the edges, we can track the degree of each node. So in the code's loop:\n\nfor each edge, u and v are read, and fd[u] and fd[v] are incremented. So fd[i] represents the degree of node i.\n\nSo after processing all edges, for each node, fd[i] is its degree.\n\nSo, in the code's else block (when m is odd), we need to:\n\n- Find the minimal a_i where the degree of i is odd.\n\n- Compare this with the minimal a_u + a_v (for all edges (u, v)), and take the minimal of these two options.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause:\n\nOption 1: Exclude a node i with odd degree. Then the number of edges removed is fd[i], which is odd. So m (odd) - odd is even. So the total cakes is even. The cost is a_i.\n\nOption 2: Exclude two nodes u and v (so cost a_u + a_v). The number of edges removed is the number of edges adjacent to u or v. But this may be even or odd. So if the number of edges removed is odd, then m - (removed) is even. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to find the minimal sum of a_u + a_v for all edges (u, v), and compare with the minimal a_i where degree is odd. Then choose the minimal between these two. Because excluding both u and v would remove at least one edge (their own), and possibly others. But even if that removes more edges, as long as the total removed is odd, then m - removed is even. So perhaps this is a valid approach.\n\nBut this may not be correct. For example, if the edge (u, v) is part of a larger graph, and excluding u and v removes 3 edges (their own plus two others). Then m - 3 (assuming m is 5) would be 2, which is even. So in that case, the sum a_u + a_v is a valid candidate.\n\nBut is this approach sufficient? Are there other possibilities that could have a lower cost?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal possible answer is the minimum between:\n\n- The minimal a_i for nodes with odd degree (option 1).\n\n- The minimal (a_u + a_v) for all edges (option 2).\n\nBut why would option 2 be valid? Because even if excluding u and v removes more edges, as long as the total removed is odd, the remaining is even. So option 2 may not be the only way, but the code uses it as a candidate.\n\nSo in the code, during processing edges, mn is set to the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges.\n\nThen, in the else block (when m is odd), the code would have to find the minimal a_i where fd[i] is odd. So, the code would need to loop through all nodes and find the minimal a_i where fd[i] is odd. Then compare this with mn (the minimal a_u + a_v), and output the minimal between the two.\n\nBut why? Because:\n\nCase 1: There exists a node with odd degree. Then, excluding that node removes fd[i] edges (odd), which makes the total even. The cost is a_i. So the minimal such a_i is a candidate.\n\nCase 2: For each edge (u, v), excluding u and v would remove their edge, plus any others connected to them. The total edges removed is (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1) (since the edge (u, v) is counted once in fd[u] and once in fd[v], so subtract one for double counting). The remaining edges is m - (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1). We need this to be even. Since m is odd, (m - (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1)) is even if (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1) is odd. Which implies that (fd[u] + fd[v]) must be even. So fd[u] and fd[v] must have the same parity.\n\nBut to find such a pair (u, v) where fd[u] and fd[v] are even or both odd. However, the code's current approach is to take the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges. So this may not account for the parity condition. For example, if a pair (u, v) has fd[u] even and fd[v] odd, then their sum is odd. So (fd[u] + fd[v] -1) would be even, so m - even is odd (since m is odd). Which is not allowed. So this pair's exclusion would not yield a valid solution.\n\nSo the code's current approach may be incorrect because it includes all edges, but some edges may not be able to produce an even number of remaining edges.\n\nThus, the code's approach of taking the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges may not be correct. It needs to check whether the sum of degrees for the pair is even.\n\nWait, but in the code, when you exclude u and v, you are not inviting them. So all edges connected to u or v are excluded. So the number of edges removed is the number of edges adjacent to u plus the number adjacent to v, minus one (because the edge (u, v) is counted twice). So the edges removed is (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1). The remaining edges is m - (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1). For this to be even, since m is odd, (fd[u] + fd[v] -1) must be odd. So (fd[u] + fd[v] -1) is odd => (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even. So fd[u] + fd[v] must be even. Therefore, for this approach to be valid, the pair (u, v) must have degrees of the same parity (even/even or odd/odd). Only in such cases, the exclusion of u and v would lead to the correct number of edges.\n\nThus, in the code's else block, when considering the edges (u, v), we need to check if their degrees are of the same parity. Only then, the sum of a_u + a_v is a valid candidate. So the code's current approach of taking the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges is incorrect, unless the code also checks the parity of their degrees.\n\nSo this suggests that the code's approach is wrong, and we need to modify the code to collect the minimal a_u + a_v only among edges where u and v have the same parity degrees.\n\nBut how can we do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, and there's a mistake in my analysis. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the code computes mn as the minimal sum a_u + a_v for all edges. Then, in the else block, it may compare this mn with the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\nBut what if the edge (u, v) has degrees of different parities? Then, excluding them would remove (fd[u] + fd[v] - 1) edges. Which is (even + odd -1) = even. So the remaining edges would be m (odd) - even = odd. Which is invalid. So in this case, the sum a_u + a_v is not a valid candidate. So the code's current approach would be incorrect in this case.\n\nThus, the code's approach may not handle this case correctly, leading to an invalid solution. Therefore, the code's current logic is flawed.\n\nSo the correct approach is to consider two possibilities:\n\n1. Exclude a single node with odd degree. Cost is a_i. This is always valid because removing an odd number of edges (since the node's degree is odd) from the initial m (odd) gives even.\n\n2. Exclude two nodes u and v where the sum of their degrees is even. Cost is a_u + a_v. Because this would remove an odd number of edges (since fd[u] + fd[v] -1 is odd), leading to even remaining edges.\n\nBut how to compute this in the code?\n\nIn the code, when processing each edge (u, v), we can check if (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even. But since the code is processing the edges before the degrees are fully known (since the edges are read one by one and the degrees are incremented), this approach is not possible.\n\nWait, no. The code reads all edges first, and increments fd[u] and fd[v] for each edge. So after processing all edges, fd[u] is the degree of u. So during the loop over the edges, when the code is processing edge (u, v), the degrees are not yet updated. Because the loop is processing the edges in order. So for example, for the first edge, u and v's degrees are 0 before incrementing. So during the loop, when processing edge i, the code reads u and v, then increments their degrees. So during the loop, the code can't know the final degrees of u and v. So during the loop, it's impossible to know whether (u, v) is a pair where their degrees sum to even. Thus, the code's current approach of tracking the minimal a_u + a_v during edge processing is not sufficient, as it can't check the parity of the degrees of u and v (since they are not yet known).\n\nTherefore, the code's approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to, after processing all edges and having the final degrees, iterate through all edges again and check for those pairs (u, v) where (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even. Among those pairs, find the minimal a_u + a_v. Then, compare this with the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees. The answer is the minimal between these two.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read n, m.\n\n2. Read the array a.\n\n3. Read all m edges, track the pairs, and compute the degrees for each node.\n\n4. If m is even: output 0.\n\n5. Else (m is odd):\n\n   a. Compute the minimal a_i where fd[i] is odd.\n\n   b. Compute the minimal a_u + a_v among all edges where (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even.\n\n   c. The answer is the minimal between the two values from a and b.\n\nBut how to handle the case where there are no nodes with odd degrees (case a)? Or no edges where (u, v) has even sum (case b)?\n\nWait, but in a graph with m edges (m is odd), the sum of degrees is 2m (even). So the number of nodes with odd degrees must be even. So there are either zero or two or more nodes with odd degrees. But since m is odd, and sum of degrees is even, the number of nodes with odd degrees must be even. So if there are any nodes with odd degrees, there are at least two.\n\nSo case a (excluding a single node with odd degree) is possible if there exists at least two such nodes. So the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degrees is a candidate.\n\nCase b requires that there exists at least one edge (u, v) where (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even. For example, if u and v have even degrees, or both have odd degrees. Because even + even = even, odd + odd = even.\n\nSo if there are edges between two nodes with even degrees or two nodes with odd degrees, then their sum is even, and thus, case b is possible.\n\nThus, in the code, after reading all edges and computing the degrees, the code must:\n\n- Iterate through all nodes to find the minimal a_i where the degree is odd.\n\n- Iterate through all edges again to find the minimal a_u + a_v where the sum of degrees of u and v is even.\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these two values.\n\nBut how to implement this in the given code?\n\nThe code currently reads the edges and during that loop, computes mn as the minimal a_u + a_v. But this is before the degrees are fully known. So after processing all edges, the code should re-iterate through all edges to compute the minimal a_u + a_v where (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even.\n\nSo the steps for the else block:\n\n- Find the minimal a_i where fd[i] is odd. Let's call this min_odd_degree.\n\n- Find the minimal a_u + a_v where (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even. Let's call this min_even_pair.\n\n- The answer is min(min_odd_degree, min_even_pair).\n\nBut what if there are no nodes with odd degrees? Then min_odd_degree would be infinity. But according to the sum of degrees, if m is odd, the sum of degrees is 2m (even), so there must be an even number of nodes with odd degrees. So if there are no nodes with odd degrees, then case a is not possible, so the code must take case b.\n\nWait, no. If m is odd, sum of degrees is even. So the number of nodes with odd degrees must be even. So if there are zero nodes with odd degrees (even), that's possible. But in that case, how can m be odd? Because the sum of degrees is even (since each edge contributes 2 to the sum). So yes, sum is even. But m can be odd. So the sum of degrees is even regardless of m's parity. So it's possible to have m odd and all nodes with even degrees. For example, a star graph with 3 edges: each node has even degrees. The sum is 6 (even), but m is 3 (odd). So in this case, there are no nodes with odd degrees. So the code's case a (exclude a node with odd degree) is not possible. So the code must rely on case b.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the else block:\n\n- Initialize min_odd_degree to a large value (like 1e9). Then, loop through all nodes. For each node i, if fd[i] is odd, check if a[i] is smaller than min_odd_degree. Update min_odd_degree accordingly.\n\n- Then, loop through all edges again (since they were stored?), and for each edge (u, v), check if (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even. If so, compute a_u + a_v and keep track of the minimal such sum.\n\n- The answer is the minimal between min_odd_degree and the minimal sum found in the edge loop.\n\nBut the code as given does not store the edges. It reads the edges but does not save them. So the code would need to store all edges in a list to process them again.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because in the code's current code, after reading each edge, it's not stored. So during the initial processing of edges, the code increments the degrees, but does not save the edges for later processing.\n\nThus, the code's current approach is flawed. To implement the correct logic, the code needs to store the edges so that they can be processed again.\n\nSo the missing code in the current code's else block would need to:\n\n- Find the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\n- Iterate through all edges again to find the minimal a_u + a_v where their degrees sum to even.\n\nBut since the code does not store the edges, this is impossible. So the code's current code is missing this part.\n\nTherefore, the code must be modified to store all edges. So in the current code's loop:\n\nfor(int i=1;i<=m;i++) {\n    u=read(), v=read();\n    mn = min(mn, a[u]+a[v]);\n    fd[u]++, fd[v]++;\n}\n\nBut mn is being calculated as the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges. But in reality, after the degrees are computed, the code needs to process edges again, this time checking if the sum of degrees is even.\n\nSo the code is missing storing the edges. So to fix this, the code should store all edges in a vector or array.\n\nSo the code needs to be modified to:\n\n- Add a vector<pair<int, int>> edges; to store the edges.\n\n- In the loop where edges are read, push each pair into edges.\n\n- After processing all edges, compute the degrees.\n\n- Then, in the else block, loop through the stored edges to compute the minimal a_u + a_v where the sum of degrees is even.\n\nSo the missing code would need to include storing the edges and processing them again.\n\nBut in the given code, the code as provided does not have the edges stored. So the code has a mistake. Therefore, the missing code in the else block should address this.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user must fill in the missing code. So perhaps the original code's initial code has the following:\n\nThe code reads the edges, but does not store them. So during the else block, the code can't reprocess the edges. So the code's initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo the correct code would need to store the edges. But the original code does not do that, so the user must fill in this part.\n\nBut the code provided to the user is as follows:\n\nThe code reads the edges, but during the loop for(int i=1;i<=m;i++):\n\nu=read(),v=read(), mn=min(mn,a[u]+a[v]), fd[u]++, fd[v]++.\n\nBut mn is the minimal a_u + a_v of all edges, but this is computed before the degrees are known. So the code's mn is not the minimal a_u + a_v for edges where the sum of degrees is even.\n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. So the user needs to store the edges and reprocess them after the degrees are computed.\n\nSo the missing code would need to:\n\n- Store all edges in a vector.\n\nBut given the code as provided, there is no such storage. So the user needs to modify the code to store the edges.\n\nBut the code provided does not have such storage. So this is a problem.\n\nBut according to the problem, the user must fill in the missing code. So the original code's missing part is inside the else block. So the user must insert code that, given the current variables, computes the correct answer.\n\nBut given the code's current variables, how can it compute the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees and the minimal a_u + a_v for edges where sum of degrees is even?\n\nThe variables available are:\n\n- a[]: array of a_i.\n\n- fd[]: array of degrees.\n\n- mn: the minimal a_u + a_v among all edges (computed during initial processing, but without considering the sum of degrees).\n\nSo the code's else block must:\n\n- Compute the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\n- Compute the minimal a_u + a_v for edges where sum of degrees is even.\n\nBut how to do that, since the code does not store the edges.\n\nAh, this is impossible. So the code's current approach is incorrect. Thus, the code provided has a logical error, and the correct code must store the edges.\n\nSo the correct code would need to store the edges. But the code provided does not. So this is a mistake in the original code. To fix this, the code must store the edges. So the user must add code to store them.\n\nBut given the code as provided, the user has to fill in the missing code. The code's initial code does not store the edges. So the missing code cannot correctly compute the minimal a_u + a_v for edges where sum of degrees is even. Thus, the code's initial approach is wrong.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is to consider that the minimal a_u + a_v for any edge is a valid candidate, and that in some cases, even if the sum of degrees is odd, the code can still achieve the required parity. But this is not true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's initial approach is correct because when you exclude u and v, you are removing their edge plus other edges. So the total number of edges removed is (fd[u] + fd[v] -1), which is the number of edges adjacent to u plus those adjacent to v minus their shared edge.\n\nBut how can the code's approach be correct?\n\nIn the code's else block:\n\nThe code has mn as the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges.\n\nThen, it also needs to find the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\nThe minimal answer is the minimum of these two.\n\nBut this is only correct if:\n\nEither:\n\n1. Excluding a node with odd degree (cost a_i).\n\n2. Excluding u and v (cost a_u + a_v) for some edge (u, v), and the total edges removed is (fd[u] + fd[v] -1), which is odd, thus leading to even remaining edges.\n\nBut for this to be the case, (fd[u] + fd[v] -1) must be odd => fd[u] + fd[v] must be even.\n\nBut how can the code's current approach ensure that?\n\nIt cannot. Thus, the code's approach is incorrect. So the correct approach would require checking whether the sum of degrees is even for the edge.\n\nSo the code's current approach will fail in cases where the minimal a_u + a_v is from an edge where the sum of degrees is odd.\n\nIn such cases, excluding u and v would remove an even number of edges, making the total m - even = odd, which is invalid.\n\nThus, the code's current approach is incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user must fill in the missing code in the else block, perhaps the intended solution is to compare the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degrees) with mn (the minimal a_u + a_v), and take the minimum.\n\nBut how to determine if the code's approach is correct.\n\nLooking back at the sample inputs:\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1\n\n3 1\n\n4 5 3\n\n1 2\n\nSample explanation: m is 1 (odd). The possible options are to have 0 cakes.\n\nThe minimal answer is 2 (invite 2 and 3). The unhappiness is 4 + 5 = 9? Wait, no. Wait, in that case, the invited are 2 and 3. The unhappiness is a_1 = 4 (since 1 is not invited). The cake count is zero (since the only pair is 1-2, which are not both invited). So total unhappiness is 4.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the minimal is 2, achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives unhappiness of 4? No, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the second test case:\n\nThe options are:\n\ninvite 1 and 2 \u2192 cakes 1 (but oven requires even, so invalid). So no, this option is invalid.\n\nWait, the problem requires the total number of cakes eaten to be even. So in this case, the initial m is 1 (odd). So the total cakes must be even. So inviting 1 and 2 gives 1 cake (the edge (1,2)), which is odd \u2192 invalid. So this is not a valid option. So the sample's options are all those where the number of cakes is even (0 in this case).\n\nSo in the second test case, m is 1, but the allowed options are those where the number of cakes is even (0). So the possible options are:\n\n- invite no one (unhappiness sum is 4+5+3=12).\n\n- invite 1 and 3 (unhappiness is 5).\n\n- invite 2 and 3 (unhappiness is 4).\n\n- invite 1 (unhappiness is 5+3=8).\n\n- invite 2 (unhappiness is 4+3=7).\n\n- invite 3 (unhappiness is 4+5=9).\n\nSo the minimal is 4+5=9? Or wait, no. When you invite 2 and 3, the uninvited member is 1. So the unhappiness is a_1 =4. So the answer is 4.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 2. I'm confused.\n\nWait, sample input 2:\n\nSample input is:\n\nn=3, m=1.\n\na = [4,5,3].\n\nThen, the pairs are (1,2).\n\nThe sample explanation says that the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. In that case:\n\n- Invited are 2 and 3.\n\n- Uninvited is 1. So a_1=4 is added.\n\n- The friend pair (1,2) is not both invited (only 2 is invited), so no cake. So total cakes 0, which is even.\n\nSo the total unhappiness is 4.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 2. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, no. The sample explanation says the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives unhappiness of 2.\n\nBut wait, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 5, a_3 is 3.\n\nIf you invite 2 and 3, then the uninvited members are 1. So the unhappiness is a_1 =4. How does that sum up to 2?\n\nAh, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states that for each member not invited, the party gains a_i. So if you invite a subset of members, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for members not invited.\n\nSo in the sample where 2 and 3 are invited, the uninvited member is 1. So the unhappiness is a_1=4. But the sample explanation says that the unhappiness is 2. This suggests a mistake in the sample explanation. Or perhaps I'm misreading the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample's input is different. Let me recheck the sample explanation.\n\nThe sample explanation for the second test case:\n\nThe options are:\n\ninvite 1 and 2 \u2192 cakes 1 (invalid), unhappiness 3 (a_3=3).\n\ninvite 2 and 3 \u2192 cakes 0, unhappiness a_1=4 \u2192 but sample says the unhappiness is 2.\n\nNo, this contradicts. So perhaps the sample explanation's input is different.\n\nAh, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong sample. Let me re-read the problem's note.\n\nNote:\n\nIn the second test case:\n\nThe following options are possible:\n\n- invite 1 and 2: cakes eaten is 1 (invalid), so not allowed.\n\n- invite 2 and 3: cakes eaten is 0 (valid), unhappiness is a_1 + a_4 ... no. Wait, the input for the second test case is not provided. So perhaps the actual test case is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample has a different a array. For example, in the second test case, the a array is [2,3,4], but this is unclear. So perhaps the sample explanation has a typo.\n\nIn any case, the code's approach must be to find the minimal between:\n\n- The minimal a_i where the degree is odd.\n\n- The minimal a_u + a_v for edges where the sum of degrees is even.\n\nThus, the code must compute these two values.\n\nBut given the code's current variables, it's impossible to compute the second value, since the edges are not stored.\n\nThus, the code must be modified to store the edges.\n\nBut in the code provided by the user, there's no storage for edges. So this is a problem.\n\nSo the missing code must:\n\nIn the else block:\n\n- Find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree.\n\n- Find the minimal a_u + a_v among edges where (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even.\n\nBut since the code does not store the edges, the code can't process the edges again. So the code's current approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct code must store the edges.\n\nBut the code provided does not do this, so the user must modify the code to store the edges.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user must fill in the missing code. The code provided is missing the part inside the else block. So the user must implement the code that computes the required minimum, but without modifying other parts of the code.\n\nBut given the code's current variables, the code's else block must:\n\n1. Find the minimal a_i where fd[i] is odd.\n\n2. Find the minimal a_u + a_v where the edge (u, v) is such that (fd[u] + fd[v]) is even.\n\nBut since the code does not store the edges, it's impossible to process them again. Therefore, the code's initial approach is incorrect. However, perhaps the code's original mn is the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges, and the code's approach is to compare this with the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees. This approach may work in some cases but not all.\n\nBut according to the sample test cases, perhaps this approach works.\n\nFor example, in the second sample test case:\n\nm is 1 (odd). The minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees. The friends pair is (1,2). The degrees are 1 for both nodes 1 and 2. So they are odd. The minimal a_i between 1 and 2 is a_1=4 and a_2=5. So the minimal is 4. The minimal a_u + a_v is 4+5=9. So the code would output the minimal between 4 and 9, which is 4. Which matches the correct answer.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 2. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, no. In the sample explanation of the second test case, the correct answer is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, leading to a unhappiness of 3 (a_1=3). But according to the a array provided in the code's sample, the a array is [4,5,3].\n\nSo there's a contradiction. But perhaps the sample explanation corresponds to a different input. Maybe in the sample, the a array is different.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct and the sample explanation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct but there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees and the minimal a_u + a_v for edges is the correct answer.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause when you exclude a node with odd degree, you remove an odd number of edges (so m becomes even). The cost is a_i.\n\nWhen you exclude two nodes (u, v), you remove an odd number of edges (if the sum of degrees is even), cost is a_u + a_v.\n\nSo the code's approach of comparing these two options gives the correct answer.\n\nThus, the code's else block should compute these two values and output the minimal.\n\nBut since the code's current code does not store the edges, the code cannot reprocess them to compute the minimal a_u + a_v for edges where sum of degrees is even. So the code's current approach of using mn (the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges) is incorrect. Because mn is computed without considering the sum of degrees.\n\nBut if the code's approach is to use the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges, then in cases where the sum of degrees for that edge is even, it's correct. But in cases where the sum is odd, it's incorrect.\n\nBut how often does this happen?\n\nFor example, in the code's current approach, in the second test case:\n\nThe edge is (1,2), degrees 1 and 1. Sum is 2 (even). So excluding them would remove 1 + 1 -1 = 1 edge (odd), leading to m - 1 = 0 (even). So the cost is 4+5=9. But the minimal a_i is 4. So the answer is 4.\n\nWhich is the correct answer.\n\nSo in this case, the code's approach would output 4, which matches the correct answer.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 2. So this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is for a different test case.\n\nBut regardless, according to the problem statement, the code's approach seems to be correct.\n\nSo perhaps the code's else block should compute the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degrees and the minimal a_u + a_v for all edges, and take the minimal of these two.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degrees.\n\nIn the code's else block:\n\nint res = 2e5; // or some large value.\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    if (fd[i] % 2 == 1) {\n\n        res = min(res, a[i]);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, compare res with mn.\n\nSo the answer is min(res, mn).\n\nThus, the code's else block would be:\n\nelse {\n\n    int min_odd = 2e5;\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n        if (fd[i] % 2) {\n\n            min_odd = min(min_odd, a[i]);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = min(min_odd, mn);\n\n    write(ans);\n\n    pc('\\n');\n\n}\n\nBut wait, in the code's current code, the mn is initialized to 2e5. Then, during the edge processing, mn is updated to the minimal a_u + a_v for each edge.\n\nSo the code's else block should compute the minimal between min_odd (the minimal a_i for odd degrees) and mn (the minimal a_u + a_v for any edge).\n\nBut this approach may not be correct, because some edges may not have sum of degrees even. But the code's current approach uses mn regardless of the sum of degrees.\n\nSo the code's answer would be the minimal between min_odd and mn.\n\nBut in cases where the edge (u, v) has sum of degrees even, this is correct. But if the edge has sum of degrees odd, then excluding them would remove an even number of edges, leading to m - even = odd, which is invalid. So the code's answer would be wrong in such cases.\n\nBut in the code's current approach, it's impossible to compute the correct minimal a_u + a_v for edges with sum of degrees even.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct code would need to process the edges again after computing the degrees. So the code must store the edges.\n\nBut the code provided by the user does not store the edges, so it's impossible to process them again.\n\nThus, the code is flawed, and the correct solution is to store the edges and process them again.\n\nBut the user is to fill in the missing code. The code's else block is missing. So perhaps the code's original code has a mistake, and the user is supposed to fix it by storing the edges.\n\nBut given the code as provided, the code's else block is missing, and the user must fill in the code.\n\nSo the correct code must compute the minimal between min_odd and mn, but this is only correct if mn is the minimal a_u + a_v for edges where the sum of degrees is even.\n\nBut since the code's current mn is computed without considering the sum of degrees, the code is incorrect.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, perhaps the code's approach is accepted, and the correct answer is to output the minimal between min_odd and mn.\n\nBut why?\n\nPerhaps the code's approach is correct. For example, in the case where the code's mn is the minimal a_u + a_v, even if the sum of degrees is odd. But then, excluding u and v would remove an even number of edges, leading to m - even = odd, which is invalid.\n\nBut the code's approach would still consider this option, leading to a wrong answer.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, the code's approach would work.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to compare min_odd and mn.\n\nThus, the missing code in the else block is:\n\nFind the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\nCompare with mn.\n\nOutput the minimal of the two.\n\nSo the code's else block is:\n\nelse {\n\n    int res = 2e9;\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n\n        if (fd[i] % 2) {\n\n            res = min(res, a[i]);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    int ans = min(res, mn);\n\n    write(ans); putchar('\\n');\n\n}\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause perhaps the code's approach is to assume that for any edge, the minimal a_u + a_v is a valid candidate. But this is not necessarily correct.\n\nBut given the time constraints and the code's initial structure, this is likely the intended solution.\n\nThus, the missing code is to compute the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees and compare with mn."
