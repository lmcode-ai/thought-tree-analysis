The problem is about finding the maximum possible side length of a square that can be created using n wooden blocks. Each block has a height of 1 unit, and the length of the i-th block is the ceiling of i divided by 2. So for i from 1 to n, the lengths are ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, ceil(5/2)=3, etc. The example given for n=5 shows that blocks 1-5 have lengths 1,1,2,2,3, and the maximum square possible is 3x3. The task is, given n, compute the maximum square side length possible using any subset of the blocks.",

For example, if you make an s x s square, each block in a row contributes length to that row. So the sum of the areas of all blocks used must be >= s\u00b2.

So the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of the lengths of the first k blocks, for some k <= n. But we need to choose the maximum s possible. So the approach is to compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks, and find the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= sum. But how to compute the sum of the lengths for the first n blocks? Let's model the sum S(n) of the first n blocks. Each block i has length ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for S(n). Let's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor even i: i=2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2)=k. For odd i: i=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2)=k. So for each pair (2k-1, 2k), the sum is k + k = 2k. So for even n=2m, the sum S(n) is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) ) = m(m+1). For odd n=2m+1, the sum is S(2m) + (m+1) \u2192 m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Wait, let's test:\n\nn=1: sum is ceil(1/2)=1 \u2192 S(1) =1.\n\nn=2: 1+1=2 \u2192 S(2)=2.\n\nn=3: 1+1+2=4 \u2192 S(3)=4. n=4: 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 S(4)=6. n=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9 \u2192 S(5)=9. n=6: 9 +3=12 \u2192 S(6)=12. So for even n=2m:\n\nsum is m*(m+1). For example, n=2: m=1 \u2192 1*2=2. Correct. n=4: m=2 \u21922*3=6. Correct. For odd n=2m+1: sum is (m+1)^2. For example, n=1: m=0 \u2192 (0+1)^2=1. Correct. n=3: m=1 \u2192 (2)^2=4. Correct. n=5: m=2 \u21923^2=9. Correct. So sum(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=5 (odd) \u2192 (5+1)/2=3 \u21923\u00b2=9. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2 \u21922\u00b2=4. Correct.\n\nn=1: (1+1)/2=1 \u21921\u00b2=1. Correct. So, sum(n) can be represented as:\n\nsum = ( (m) * (m +1) ) if n is even, where m = n/2. sum = ( (m)^2 ) if n is odd, where m = (n+1)/2. Wait, no. For odd n, sum is (m)^2 where m is (n+1)/2. Because for n=5, (5+1)/2=3, sum is 9=3\u00b2. Yes. Alternatively, we can write sum as floor( (n+1)^2 / 4 ). Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2m: (2m +1)^2 /4 = (4m\u00b2 +4m +1)/4 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m + 0.25. Floor is m\u00b2 +m = m(m+1), which matches the even case. For odd n=2m+1: (2m+2)^2 /4 = (4m\u00b2 +8m +4)/4 = m\u00b2 +2m +1 = (m+1)^2. Which matches the sum for odd n.\n\nSo sum(n) = floor( ( (n +1) )\u00b2 / 4 ) Wait, testing:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)^2 /4 =36/4=9 \u2192 floor is 9. Correct.\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)^2=25 \u2192 25/4=6.25 \u2192 floor is6. Correct.\n\nn=2 \u2192 (3)^2/4=9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor 2. Correct. Yes, this formula works. So sum(n) = floor( ( (n+1)^2 ) / 4 ) So the sum of the lengths of all n blocks is equal to floor( (n+1)^2 / 4 ). So the problem reduces to finding the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ). Wait, but sum(n) is exactly (n+1)^2 //4 (integer division). Because (n+1)^2 divided by 4, rounded down. So sum(n) is the maximum possible area (sum of lengths) available. Then, the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= sum(n). So s is the floor of sqrt(sum(n)). Wait, but sum(n) can be a perfect square, so s is exactly sqrt(sum(n)), otherwise floor of that. But the problem says that you can use any subset of the blocks, but the sum of their lengths must be >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= sum(n). So the problem is to compute s = floor( sqrt( sum(n) ) ) But sum(n) is (n+1)^2//4. So sum(n) = (n+1)^2 //4. So s is the integer part of sqrt( (n+1)^2 /4 ), but wait, let's compute that. (n+1)^2 /4 is ( (n+1)/2 )^2. So the square root is exactly (n+1)/2. So the integer part is floor( (n+1)/2 ), since sqrt( (n+1)^2 /4 ) = (n+1)/2.",

Then sqrt(sum(n)) is <= (n+1)/2, since sum(n) <= (n+1)^2/4. Wait, for example, when n is even:\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)^2 /4 =25/4=6.25. sum(n) is 6. So sqrt(6) is about 2.449, but (4+1)/2=2.5. So floor(sqrt(6))=2. But (4+1)/2=2.5, which is larger. So the maximum s would be 2, but (n+1)/2 is 2.5. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Wait, but according to the formula sum(n) = (n+1)^2//4. For n=5: sum(n) is 9. s=3. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. But for even n=4: sum(n)=6. s=2, since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, but 3\u00b2=9>6. So s=2. So sqrt(6)=~2.449, so s=2. So s is the integer part of sqrt(sum(n)). So the approach is to compute sum(n) = (n+1)^2 //4, then compute s as the floor of the square root of sum(n). But how does this compare to (n+1)/2? In the case where sum(n) is a perfect square, like n=5, sum(n)=9, s=3, which is (5+1)/2=3. So in this case, s=(n+1)/2. But when sum(n) is not a perfect square, like n=4, sum(n)=6, sqrt(6)=~2.449, s=2. Which is less than (4+1)/2=2.5. So the maximum possible s is the integer part of sqrt( sum(n) ), which is floor( sqrt( (n+1)^2 //4 ) ) But how can we compute this efficiently for large n (up to 1e9)? Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's see for sum(n):\n\nsum(n) is (n+1)^2//4. So sum(n) is ( (n+1)/2 )^2 when n is odd, and (n/2)( (n/2) +1 ) when even. But when n is even: sum(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) = (n/2 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25. For example, n=4 \u2192 2*3=6. (2.5)^2=6.25 \u2192 6.25-0.25=6. So sum(n) is ( (n/2 +0.5)^2 ) -0.25. So sqrt(sum(n)) is sqrt( (n/2 +0.5)^2 -0.25 ). So this is less than (n/2 +0.5), but how much less? Alternatively, perhaps we can find s by considering the cases for even and odd n.\n\nLet's think of sum(n) as follows: If n is even, sum(n) = m*(m+1), where m = n/2. If n is odd, sum(n) = m\u00b2, where m = (n+1)/2. So when n is even, sum(n) = m^2 + m. So s is the maximum integer where s\u00b2 \u2264 m^2 + m.\n\nWe can solve s\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m \u2192 s <= m + 0.5 (since m^2 +m = (m +0.5)^2 -0.25). So sqrt(m^2 +m) is m +0.5 - some epsilon. So the floor is m.\n\nWait, for example, m=2 (n=4), sum=6. sqrt(6)\u22482.449. So floor is 2. But m=2, so m=2. So s=2. Another example: m=3 (n=6), sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)\u22483.464. Floor is 3. Which is equal to m. So when n is even, s is m. When n is even, sum(n) is m*(m+1). Then s is the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)). But m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. The square of (m +0.5) is m\u00b2 +m +0.25. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) = m +0.5 - delta, where delta is (0.25)/(2*(m+0.5)) approximately. So the floor is m. So s = m when n is even. But for m=1, sum=1*2=2. s=1 (sqrt(2)=1.414). So yes. So for even n, s is m = n/2. Wait, but let's check n=6 (m=3). sum=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes, s=3. So when n is even, s = m = n/2. When n is odd, sum(n) = m\u00b2 where m=(n+1)/2. Then s is sqrt(m\u00b2) = m. So for example, n=5 (m=3), sum=9. s=3. So for odd n, s=m=(n+1)/2. So the conclusion is:\n\nIf n is even: s = n/2. If n is odd: s = (n+1)/2. Wait, but this can't be right. Because when n is even, sum(n) is m*(m+1), where m is n/2. Then s^2 <= m*(m+1). The maximum possible s is floor( sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Let's see for m=1: sqrt(2) ~1.414, floor is 1. So s=1. For m=2: sqrt(6)~2.449 \u2192 s=2. For m=3: sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 s=3. So yes, for even n, s= m.\n\nWhich is equal to n/2. So when n is even, s= n/2. When n is odd, sum(n) is m\u00b2, so s= m= (n+1)/2. So this gives a direct formula for s, without having to compute sum(n) and take square roots.",

Which is correct. Yes. So for all n, the maximum s is (n+1) / 2 using integer division. This is a very simple formula. So the code can be written as:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read n.\n\n   compute s = (n+1)/2. output s. But wait, let's test some examples. Sample Input 1:\n\nn=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 output 1. Correct. Sample Input 2:\n\nn=5 \u2192 6/2=3 \u2192 output3. Correct. Another example:\n\nn=3 \u2192 (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 sum(n)=4. 2\u00b2=4. Correct.\n\nn=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3 \u2192 sum=12. 3\u00b2=9<=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3. Correct.\n\nn=7 \u2192 (7+1)/2=4. sum=16. 4\u00b2=16 \u2192 correct. n=8 \u2192 (8+1)/2=4 (since 9/2=4.5 \u2192 integer division is 4). sum(n)= (9^2)/4=81/4=20.25 \u2192 floor 20. s=4\u00b2=16<=20. 5\u00b2=25>20. Correct. So all examples check out. So the code is simply to output (n+1)/2 for each test case. But wait, how can this be? Because according to the problem statement, the sum of the lengths is sum(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ), and s is floor( sqrt(sum(n)) ). But according to the examples and the formula, s is (n+1)/2. But sum(n) can be as high as m\u00b2, where m=(n+1)/2 when n is odd, so s is m. For even n, sum(n)=m(m+1), and s is m. So the formula holds. Thus, the code is straightforward: read n, output (n+1)/2 using integer division. So the missing code is: For each test case:\n\nn is input. Compute (n +1) / 2.\n\nOutput that. So the code inside the while loop would be:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( (n + 1) / 2 ); Wait, but in Java, when you divide two longs, it's integer division. So for example, if n is 5, (5+1)/2 is 3. For n=4, (4+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 but in Java, 5/2 is 2. So the code is correct. Thus, the missing code is to read n, compute (n+1)/2, and print that. So in the given code, the while loop is:\n\nwhile(t>0){\n\n   // code here\n\n} So inside the loop, the code should read n, compute (n+1)/2, and print. So the code to add is:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n + 1) / 2 );\n\nt--;\n\nBecause the loop is while(t>0), so after processing each test case, t is decremented. Putting it all together, the code inside the loop is:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n + 1) / 2 );\n\nt--;\n\nSo the missing code is those three lines. But looking at the given code:\n\nIn the original code, the while loop is:\n\nwhile(t>0){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n} So we need to read n, compute (n+1)/2, output, decrement t. So the code to add is:\n\nlong n = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nt--;\n\nBut in Java, variables should be declared. However, since n is declared as a long variable outside (in the code, 'long t,i,j,k,n;'), so it's already declared. So the code can be:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nt--;\n\nBut in the code, after the while loop, the variables are already declared. So the missing code is:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n +1) /2 );\n\nt--; So that's the code to insert into the loop.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible side length of a square that can be created using n wooden blocks. Each block has a height of 1 unit, and the length of the i-th block is the ceiling of i divided by 2. So for i from 1 to n, the lengths are ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, ceil(5/2)=3, etc. The example given for n=5 shows that blocks 1-5 have lengths 1,1,2,2,3, and the maximum square possible is 3x3.\n\nThe task is, given n, compute the maximum square side length possible using any subset of the blocks. The key is to determine how many blocks are needed for a given side length s, then find the largest s where the total required blocks are \u2264 n.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Each square of side length s requires s rows, each of length s. Since each block has height 1, each row is built using blocks placed horizontally. So for each row, the sum of the lengths of the blocks in that row must be at least s. Wait, no. Each block contributes to the row's length. So for each row, the sum of the lengths of the blocks used in that row should equal s. Because each block is 1 unit high, each row is made by arranging some blocks next to each other. So for each row, the total length of the blocks in that row must be exactly s. Since each row is 1 unit high, the square's height is s units (since there are s rows). So the total number of blocks needed is s * (sum of the lengths of each row's blocks). Wait, no. Wait, each row in the square is a single row of blocks arranged horizontally. For example, if a row is length s, then the sum of the lengths of the blocks in that row must be s. So for each row, the number of blocks used depends on how the lengths are arranged. But the problem allows us to use any subset of the blocks, as long as the sum per row is s for each of s rows.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, the blocks are provided in a certain way. Each block i has a certain length. So perhaps the problem is to select a subset of the blocks such that the sum of the lengths of the blocks is at least s*s (since the area of the square is s\u00b2, but each block contributes 1*length to the area. Wait, each block's area is 1 * length. So the total area of all used blocks must be at least s\u00b2. Because each block contributes its area to the total. For example, if you make an s x s square, each block in a row contributes length to that row. So the sum of the areas of all blocks used must be >= s\u00b2. Because each row's blocks contribute length, and there are s rows. So sum of all blocks' lengths (each used once) must be >= s * s. Because each row contributes s units of length (for s rows), so total area is s\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of the lengths of the first m blocks (for some m <= n) is >= s\u00b2, and m <= n. Because the sum of the lengths of the blocks used is the total area, which must be at least s\u00b2, but you can't use more than n blocks.\n\nWait, but each block can be used once. So the total sum of the lengths of the blocks used is exactly the sum of their individual lengths. So the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of the lengths of the first k blocks, for some k <= n. But we need to choose the maximum s possible.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks, and find the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= sum. But how to compute the sum of the lengths for the first n blocks?\n\nLet's model the sum S(n) of the first n blocks.\n\nEach block i has length ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for S(n).\n\nLet's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor even i: i=2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2)=k.\n\nFor odd i: i=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2)=k.\n\nSo for each pair (2k-1, 2k), the sum is k + k = 2k.\n\nSo for even n=2m, the sum S(n) is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) )= m(m+1).\n\nFor odd n=2m+1, the sum is S(2m) + (m+1) \u2192 m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nn=1: sum is ceil(1/2)=1 \u2192 S(1) =1.\n\nn=2: 1+1=2 \u2192 S(2)=2.\n\nn=3: 1+1+2=4 \u2192 S(3)=4.\n\nn=4: 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 S(4)=6.\n\nn=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9 \u2192 S(5)=9.\n\nn=6: 9 +3=12 \u2192 S(6)=12.\n\nSo for even n=2m:\n\nsum is m*(m+1). For example, n=2: m=1 \u2192 1*2=2. Correct. n=4: m=2 \u21922*3=6. Correct.\n\nFor odd n=2m+1: sum is (m+1)^2. For example, n=1: m=0 \u2192 (0+1)^2=1. Correct. n=3: m=1 \u2192 (2)^2=4. Correct. n=5: m=2 \u21923^2=9. Correct.\n\nSo sum(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=5 (odd) \u2192 (5+1)/2=3 \u21923\u00b2=9. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2 \u21922\u00b2=4. Correct.\n\nn=1: (1+1)/2=1 \u21921\u00b2=1. Correct.\n\nSo, sum(n) can be represented as:\n\nsum = ( (m) * (m +1) ) if n is even, where m = n/2.\n\nsum = ( (m)^2 ) if n is odd, where m = (n+1)/2. Wait, no. For odd n, sum is (m)^2 where m is (n+1)/2. Because for n=5, (5+1)/2=3, sum is 9=3\u00b2.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, we can write sum as floor( (n+1)^2 / 4 ). Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2m: (2m +1)^2 /4 = (4m\u00b2 +4m +1)/4 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m + 0.25. Floor is m\u00b2 +m = m(m+1), which matches the even case.\n\nFor odd n=2m+1: (2m+2)^2 /4 = (4m\u00b2 +8m +4)/4 = m\u00b2 +2m +1 = (m+1)^2. Which matches the sum for odd n.\n\nSo sum(n) = floor( ( (n +1) )\u00b2 / 4 )\n\nWait, testing:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)^2 /4 =36/4=9 \u2192 floor is 9. Correct.\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)^2=25 \u2192 25/4=6.25 \u2192 floor is6. Correct.\n\nn=2 \u2192 (3)^2/4=9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor 2. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So sum(n) = floor( ( (n+1)^2 ) / 4 )\n\nSo the sum of the lengths of all n blocks is equal to floor( (n+1)^2 / 4 ).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ).\n\nWait, but sum(n) is exactly (n+1)^2 //4 (integer division). Because (n+1)^2 divided by 4, rounded down.\n\nSo sum(n) is the maximum possible area (sum of lengths) available. Then, the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= sum(n). So s is the floor of sqrt(sum(n)).\n\nWait, but sum(n) can be a perfect square, so s is exactly sqrt(sum(n)), otherwise floor of that.\n\nBut the problem says that you can use any subset of the blocks, but the sum of their lengths must be >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= sum(n).\n\nSo the problem is to compute s = floor( sqrt( sum(n) ) )\n\nBut sum(n) is (n+1)^2//4.\n\nSo sum(n) = (n+1)^2 //4.\n\nSo s is the integer part of sqrt( (n+1)^2 /4 ), but wait, let's compute that.\n\n(n+1)^2 /4 is ( (n+1)/2 )^2. So the square root is exactly (n+1)/2. So the integer part is floor( (n+1)/2 ), since sqrt( (n+1)^2 /4 ) = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but sum(n) is exactly ( (n+1)^2 //4 ), which is equal to floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ). So sum(n) can be written as floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ). Then sqrt(sum(n)) is <= (n+1)/2, since sum(n) <= (n+1)^2/4.\n\nWait, for example, when n is even:\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)^2 /4 =25/4=6.25. sum(n) is 6. So sqrt(6) is about 2.449, but (4+1)/2=2.5. So floor(sqrt(6))=2. But (4+1)/2=2.5, which is larger. So the maximum s would be 2, but (n+1)/2 is 2.5. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, but according to the formula sum(n) = (n+1)^2//4.\n\nFor n=5: sum(n) is 9. s=3. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3.\n\nBut for even n=4: sum(n)=6. s=2, since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, but 3\u00b2=9>6. So s=2. So sqrt(6)=~2.449, so s=2.\n\nSo s is the integer part of sqrt(sum(n)).\n\nSo the approach is to compute sum(n) = (n+1)^2 //4, then compute s as the floor of the square root of sum(n).\n\nBut how does this compare to (n+1)/2?\n\nIn the case where sum(n) is a perfect square, like n=5, sum(n)=9, s=3, which is (5+1)/2=3. So in this case, s=(n+1)/2.\n\nBut when sum(n) is not a perfect square, like n=4, sum(n)=6, sqrt(6)=~2.449, s=2. Which is less than (4+1)/2=2.5.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is the integer part of sqrt( sum(n) ), which is floor( sqrt( (n+1)^2 //4 ) )\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently for large n (up to 1e9)?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's see for sum(n):\n\nsum(n) is (n+1)^2//4. So sum(n) is ( (n+1)/2 )^2 when n is odd, and (n/2)( (n/2) +1 ) when even.\n\nBut when n is even: sum(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) = (n/2 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25. For example, n=4 \u2192 2*3=6. (2.5)^2=6.25 \u2192 6.25-0.25=6. So sum(n) is ( (n/2 +0.5)^2 ) -0.25. So sqrt(sum(n)) is sqrt( (n/2 +0.5)^2 -0.25 ). So this is less than (n/2 +0.5), but how much less?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find s by considering the cases for even and odd n.\n\nLet's think of sum(n) as follows:\n\nIf n is even, sum(n) = m*(m+1), where m = n/2.\n\nIf n is odd, sum(n) = m\u00b2, where m = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo when n is even, sum(n) = m^2 + m.\n\nSo s is the maximum integer where s\u00b2 \u2264 m^2 + m.\n\nWe can solve s\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m \u2192 s <= m + 0.5 (since m^2 +m = (m +0.5)^2 -0.25). So sqrt(m^2 +m) is m +0.5 - some epsilon. So the floor is m.\n\nWait, for example, m=2 (n=4), sum=6. sqrt(6)\u22482.449. So floor is 2. But m=2, so m=2. So s=2.\n\nAnother example: m=3 (n=6), sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)\u22483.464. Floor is 3. Which is equal to m.\n\nSo when n is even, s is m.\n\nWhen n is even, sum(n) is m*(m+1). Then s is the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nBut m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. The square of (m +0.5) is m\u00b2 +m +0.25. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) = m +0.5 - delta, where delta is (0.25)/(2*(m+0.5)) approximately. So the floor is m.\n\nSo s = m when n is even.\n\nBut for m=1, sum=1*2=2. s=1 (sqrt(2)=1.414). So yes.\n\nSo for even n, s is m = n/2.\n\nWait, but let's check n=6 (m=3). sum=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes, s=3.\n\nSo when n is even, s = m = n/2.\n\nWhen n is odd, sum(n) = m\u00b2 where m=(n+1)/2. Then s is sqrt(m\u00b2) = m.\n\nSo for example, n=5 (m=3), sum=9. s=3.\n\nSo for odd n, s=m=(n+1)/2.\n\nSo the conclusion is:\n\nIf n is even: s = n/2.\n\nIf n is odd: s = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but this can't be right. Because when n is even, sum(n) is m*(m+1), where m is n/2. Then s^2 <= m*(m+1). The maximum possible s is floor( sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Let's see for m=1: sqrt(2) ~1.414, floor is 1. So s=1. For m=2: sqrt(6)~2.449 \u2192 s=2. For m=3: sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 s=3. So yes, for even n, s= m.\n\nWhich is equal to n/2.\n\nSo when n is even, s= n/2.\n\nWhen n is odd, sum(n) is m\u00b2, so s= m= (n+1)/2.\n\nSo this gives a direct formula for s, without having to compute sum(n) and take square roots.\n\nWait, this would mean that for any n, the maximum s is floor( (n+1)/2 ), but that's not correct. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nIn the first test case, n=1. According to the formula, since n is odd, s=(1+1)/2=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond test case, n=5 (odd), s=(5+1)/2=3. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=4 (even), s=4/2=2. sum(n)=6, 2\u00b2=4 <=6. 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes.\n\nn=6 (even): sum=3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12, 4\u00b2=16>12. Correct.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, when n is even, s is m = n/2. sum is m(m+1). Then s\u00b2 = m\u00b2. Which is <= m(m+1). So yes.\n\nSo for even n, s is m = n/2.\n\nFor odd n, sum(n)=m\u00b2 where m=(n+1)/2, so s = m.\n\nSo overall, the maximum s is floor( (n +1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, when n is even, (n+1)/2 is n/2 + 0.5. So floor( (n+1)/2 ) is n/2. So yes.\n\nWhen n is odd, (n+1)/2 is an integer. So the formula s = floor( (n+1)/2 ) is correct.\n\nSo the formula for s is s = floor( (n+1)/2 ).\n\nBut wait, for n=6 (even), (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 floor is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is s = floor( (n+1)/2 ).\n\nWait, that's a very straightforward formula. So for any n, s is floor( (n+1)/2 ). But how does that hold with the sum?\n\nFor example, n=5: sum is 9. s=3. 3\u00b2=9. Correct.\n\nn=6: sum is 12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. Next possible is 4: 16>12. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum is 4. s=2. 2\u00b2=4<=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: sum is 2. s=1.5 floor is 1. Correct.\n\nWait, but according to the formula floor( (n+1)/2 ), for n=2:\n\n(2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor is 1. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the maximum possible s is floor( (n+1)/2 ), which is equivalent to (n+1)//2 in integer division.\n\nWait, let me check another example. Let's say n=7 (odd). Then sum(n) is (7+1)^2//4 = 64/4=16. So sum=16. s=4. Which is indeed (7+1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=8 (even): sum is (9^2)/4=81/4=20.25 \u2192 floor is 20. sum=20. s=4.5 \u2192 floor is4. (8+1)/2=4.5, floor is4. But according to the formula s= floor( (n+1)/2 )=4. Which is correct because 4\u00b2=16 \u226420. The next possible is 5, 25>20.\n\nSo yes, the formula works.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the maximum possible s is the floor of (n+1)/2, which is (n+1)//2 using integer division.\n\nWait, but wait! Let's check for n=5: sum is9. s=3. (5+1)/2=3. So s=3.\n\nn=4: sum is6. s=2. (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor is2. Correct.\n\nSo the formula s= floor( (n+1)/2 ) gives the correct answer.\n\nBut why? Because sum(n) is (n+1)^2//4, and the maximum s is floor( sqrt(sum(n)) ), which equals floor( (n+1)/2 ).\n\nBecause sum(n) is (n+1)^2//4. Let's see:\n\nFor even n, (n+1)^2//4 is (2m+1)^2//4 where n=2m. For example, n=4=2*2 \u2192 (5)^2//4=25//4=6. Then sqrt(6) ~2.449 \u2192 floor is2. Which is (4+1)/2=2.5, floor is2.\n\nFor odd n=2m-1, (n+1) is 2m. So sum is (2m)^2//4=4m\u00b2//4=m\u00b2. sqrt(m\u00b2)=m, which is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo indeed, s is the floor of (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but (n+1)/2 can be written as:\n\ns = (n+1) // 2.\n\nYes, because for even n, (n+1) is odd, divided by 2, integer division would give (n+1)/2 - 0.5 \u2192 integer division truncates towards zero, so (n+1)/2 for even n is n/2 + 0.5, which is 2.5 for n=4. (4+1)/2=2.5. Integer division (in Java) is 2.\n\nWait, Java does integer division as truncating towards zero. So (n+1)/2 when n is even (n=4) is (5)/2=2.5 \u2192 when stored as integer (long) division, 5/2=2.\n\nSo in Java, (n+1)/2 is (n+1) divided by 2 using integer division.\n\nSo the formula for s is (n+1)/2, but using integer division. Which is the same as (n+1) // 2.\n\nSo for any n, the maximum s is (n+1) divided by 2 using integer division.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (6+1)/2=3 (since 7/2 is 3.5, integer division is 3). Which is correct.\n\nn=2: (2+1)/2=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes. So the answer is simply (n+1)/2 when using integer division, which is written in Java as (n + 1) / 2.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is even?\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So for all n, the maximum s is (n+1) / 2 using integer division.\n\nThis is a very simple formula. So the code can be written as:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read n.\n\n   compute s = (n+1)/2.\n\n   output s.\n\nBut wait, let's test some examples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 output 1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=5 \u2192 6/2=3 \u2192 output3. Correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3 \u2192 (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 sum(n)=4. 2\u00b2=4. Correct.\n\nn=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3 \u2192 sum=12. 3\u00b2=9<=12. 4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3. Correct.\n\nn=7 \u2192 (7+1)/2=4. sum=16. 4\u00b2=16 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8 \u2192 (8+1)/2=4 (since 9/2=4.5 \u2192 integer division is 4). sum(n)= (9^2)/4=81/4=20.25 \u2192 floor 20. s=4\u00b2=16<=20. 5\u00b2=25>20. Correct.\n\nSo all examples check out.\n\nSo the code is simply to output (n+1)/2 for each test case.\n\nBut wait, how can this be? Because according to the problem statement, the sum of the lengths is sum(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ), and s is floor( sqrt(sum(n)) ). But according to the examples and the formula, s is (n+1)/2.\n\nBut sum(n) can be as high as m\u00b2, where m=(n+1)/2 when n is odd, so s is m. For even n, sum(n)=m(m+1), and s is m. So the formula holds.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward: read n, output (n+1)/2 using integer division.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn is input.\n\nCompute (n +1) / 2.\n\nOutput that.\n\nSo the code inside the while loop would be:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( (n + 1) / 2 );\n\nWait, but in Java, when you divide two longs, it's integer division. So for example, if n is 5, (5+1)/2 is 3. For n=4, (4+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 but in Java, 5/2 is 2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is to read n, compute (n+1)/2, and print that.\n\nSo in the given code, the while loop is:\n\nwhile(t>0){\n\n   // code here\n\n}\n\nSo inside the loop, the code should read n, compute (n+1)/2, and print.\n\nSo the code to add is:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n + 1) / 2 );\n\nt--;\n\nBecause the loop is while(t>0), so after processing each test case, t is decremented.\n\nPutting it all together, the code inside the loop is:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n + 1) / 2 );\n\nt--;\n\nSo the missing code is those three lines.\n\nBut looking at the given code:\n\nIn the original code, the while loop is:\n\nwhile(t>0){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nSo we need to read n, compute (n+1)/2, output, decrement t.\n\nSo the code to add is:\n\nlong n = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nt--;\n\nBut in Java, variables should be declared. However, since n is declared as a long variable outside (in the code, 'long t,i,j,k,n;'), so it's already declared. So the code can be:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nt--;\n\nBut in the code, after the while loop, the variables are already declared. So the missing code is:\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\nSystem.out.println( (n +1) /2 );\n\nt--;\n\nSo that's the code to insert into the loop."
