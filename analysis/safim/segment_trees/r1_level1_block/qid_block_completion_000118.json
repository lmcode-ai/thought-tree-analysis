So during the move left, it must not be in column 0, otherwise moving left would take it out. So if during any left move, a robot is in column 0, it would explode. Similarly for up moves. So the problem reduces to checking if there exists a robot R such that all other robots are in positions (x, y) where x \u2265 R's x and y \u2265 R's y. Because then, when moving left and up as needed for R to reach (0,0), the other robots will have x >= R's x (so when moving up, their x is >= R's x, so after moving up, they are still in the grid) and y >= R's y (so moving left, they are in columns >= R's y, which after moving left, stay in the grid). Wait, but R's initial position is (i,j). For R to reach (0,0), we need to move up i times and left j times. Let's say we first move left j times and then up i times. Then, during each left move, other robots must not be in column 0. Similarly, during each up move, other robots must not be in row 0. But if another robot is at (x,y) where x >= i and y >= j, then moving left j times would make its y decrease by j. Since initial y >= j, after moving left j times, y >= 0. Similarly, moving up i times would make x decrease by i. Since x >= i, x-i >=0. So the other robot would not explode. So the key is that the selected robot (i,j) must have all other robots (x,y) such that x >= i and y >= j. Then, when we move left j times and then up i times, all other robots are safe. Alternatively, if the order of moves is up first and then left, then other robots must have x >= i and y >= j. So regardless of the order, if all other robots are in positions (x,y) with x >= i and y >= j, then moving left j times and up i times would work. So the problem reduces to finding if there exists a robot such that all other robots are in positions that are to the right (y >= j) and below (x >= i) of it. Thus, the solution is to find the robot with the leftmost (smallest) y-coordinate and topmost (smallest x-coordinate). If such a robot exists and all other robots are in positions where their x and y are >= this robot's x and y, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO. \n\nWait, but how do we determine the coordinates? Let's see. The input is given in n rows. Let's assume that the first row is the top row (row 0?), or maybe the first row is the top. For example, in the first test case of the example, the robot is in (0,1), and moving left takes it to (0,0).",

The code starts with a= n, and then processes each row, decrementing a. So the first row processed in the code is the nth row (assuming the input is given as row 1 to row n). But wait, maybe the code is reading the rows in reverse order. So, for example, in the input, the first row after n and m is row 0 of the grid, or the top row? Let's think.

So no action is taken. But those robots are in columns to the left of the rightmost robot in the top row, which would violate the condition that all robots must be to the right and below.

So in this case, minx would be 4, and the robot at (0,3) would have b1=3 < minx=4, so the code would set check=0. But that's incorrect because the robot at (0,3) is to the left of the candidate (0,4). So according to the code's logic, the presence of a robot to the left of the candidate would invalidate the solution. But that's the opposite of what's needed. Because the candidate should be the leftmost robot. So the code's approach is incorrect. So, what's wrong with the code's approach?",

So, given the existing code structure, how can we adjust it to correctly solve the problem? The code's current logic sets minx to the first robot's column. Then, for any subsequent robot, if its column is larger than minx, then check is set to 0. But according to the problem's requirements, the correct condition is that all robots are in rows >= the candidate's row and columns >= the candidate's column. So, the candidate must be the leftmost and topmost robot. In the code's current approach, minx is the column of the first robot encountered.",

But the code's existing code in the loop for each cell is:\n\nif (c == 'R') {\n    if (minx ==0) {\n        minx = b1;\n    } else {\n        if (minx < b1) {\n            // TODO: Your code here\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBut in the case where minx is not zero and the current b1 is smaller than minx (i.e., a robot is found to the left of the current minx), the code's condition (minx < b1) is false, so no action is taken. Thus, the code's minx is not updated. This is the core issue. So, the code's minx is tracking the first robot encountered in the grid (rightmost in the top row).

But how does the code track whether it's processing the top row? The code's a variable starts at the input n and decreases. So, for example, if the input has 3 rows, a starts at 3 and decreases to 1. So, the first row processed (a=3) is the top row. But no. The code's a loop is for a from input n down to 1. So, the first row processed is a= n, then a= n-1, etc. But the input's rows are given as the first row being the top row. So, the code's a loop processes the rows in the same order as given. So, a=3 corresponds to the first row of the input (top row), a=2 to the second row, etc. Thus, during the processing of the first row (a=3), the code is processing the top row. But for subsequent rows (a=2, 1), the code is processing lower rows. Thus, the code's minx is set during the processing of the first row (a=3).",

But given the code's structure, perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal column in the first row with a robot. Thus, for each row processed after the first row that has a robot, any robot found in that row must be in a column >= minx. Additionally, any robot found in the same row as the candidate must be in a column >= minx. But how to track that. Alternatively, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first robot encountered is in the top row and rightmost. For all other robots, if they are in the same row and to the right of the first robot, then check=0. If they are in a lower row, their column must be >= the first robot's column. But this is not correct. The correct approach is that all robots must be in columns >= the minimal column (leftmost) in the first row. Thus, the code's logic should:\n\n1. Find the first row (top row) that has a robot. 2. In that row, find the leftmost column (minimal b1). 3. For all other robots, check if they are in rows >= this row and columns >= this column. But the code's current code does not track this. But given that the code's existing code has the following variables:\n\n- a: the current row being processed (from input n down to 1).\n\n- b1: the current column being processed (from m down to 1).\n\n- minx: initially zero, set to the first robot's column.\n\n- check: initialized to 1. The code's current code is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    check=1; minx=0;\n\n    read n and m.\n\n    for each row a from n down to 1:\n\n        for each column b1 from m down to 1:\n\n            read character. if character is 'R':\n\n                if minx is 0:\n\n                    minx = b1.\n\n                else:\n\n                    if minx < b1:\n\n                        // TODO: Your code here.\n\n                    else:\n\n                        // do nothing.

But according to the problem's note, the sixth test case is NO because moving any robot to the upper left would cause others to explode. But in this case, there's already a robot at (0,0). So the code's answer should be YES. But the sample input 6's explanation says that the answer is NO. So I'm a bit confused. But perhaps the code's approach is correct for some of the cases but not all. But given the time constraints, I think that the correct code for the TODO part is to set check=0. But why?",

But as long as steps <= minx, this robot's new column is (b1 - steps), which is >= 0. But if steps is minx steps (to take the candidate to column 0), then this robot's column would be (b1 - minx).

The code's current code sets check=0 when a robot is found to the right of the candidate's column. But this is wrong. Thus, the code's TODO part should set check=0 when a robot is found in a row that is processed after the candidate's row (i.e., lower rows) and its column is less than the candidate's column.

Then, in the lower row (row 1), processing column 1 (rightmost) \u2192 'E', then column 0 \u2192 'R'. So, this robot is at column 0. The code's minx is 1. Thus, in the else clause, since minx (1) > b1 (0), the code would execute the TODO part. If the TODO part is to set check=0, then this triggers, and the output is NO. Which matches the sample input 6's expected output. Thus, the code's TODO part should set check=0 in this case.

But the robot at (0,2) can be moved left twice to reach (0,0). The robot at (1,1) would move left twice, ending at (1,-1), which is out of bounds. Thus, the code correctly sets check=0.

But the code's code does not track the candidate row. Thus, perhaps the correct code for the TODO part is to set check=0. But why?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether we can move robots such that at least one reaches the upper left corner without any robot exploding. The code provided has a TODO section that I need to fill in. \n\nHmm, the main idea here is that all robots must be able to move in such a way that their paths don't require moving out of the grid. For a robot to reach (0,0) (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed), the required steps would involve moving left and up. But since all robots move the same direction each step, we need to find a sequence of directions that allows at least one robot to reach (0,0) without any other robot going out of bounds during any of those moves.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe the key is to check for each robot whether there's a path to (0,0) such that all other robots are not in a position where any step would cause them to go out of bounds. Because when you send commands, all robots move each time. So for the target robot, the directions must be such that the sequence of moves (left and up) gets it to (0,0), and during each of those moves, none of the other robots are in positions that would make them go out of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is to find the robot that's closest to (0,0) in some way, and check if all other robots are not blocking its path. Wait, maybe the correct approach is that for a robot R at position (x, y), the minimal steps required are x + y (since you need to move up x times and left y times). But all the other robots must be positioned such that for every step in the sequence of moves (like moving left then up, etc.), none of them step out of the grid. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the robot that can reach (0,0) must be the \"leftmost and topmost\" robot. Because any robot that is to the right or below another robot might not be possible to move without others going out. \n\nFor example, if there's a robot in (i,j) and another in (k,l) where i < k (assuming rows are 0-based starting from top), then moving up would require the lower robot to move up, but if there's a robot below it, that's impossible. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again. \n\nEach time a direction is chosen, all robots move once. So for a robot to reach (0,0), the sum of the steps up and left must be exactly the number of steps taken. But the problem requires that during each step, no robot goes out of bounds. So any robot that is in a position where, to reach (0,0), during the sequence of moves, they would have to move beyond the grid in any step is a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal required steps for each robot and check if there's a robot such that all other robots are either in the same row or column and not \"blocking\" the path. Or maybe, the robots must all be in positions that are to the right and/or below the target robot. Because then, when moving left and up, the target robot can reach (0,0), and the other robots are moving in those directions but not exiting the grid. \n\nWait, let's think of the example where there's a robot at (i,j). To reach (0,0), we need to move up i times and left j times. The order of moves can vary, but any sequence of i up moves and j left moves. But during each move, all robots move in that direction. So other robots must not be in positions where during any of these moves, they would be forced to exit the grid. \n\nFor example, suppose there's another robot at (x,y). When we move left, all robots move left. So for that robot, after this move, its y coordinate is y-1. So during the move left, it must not be in column 0, otherwise moving left would take it out. So if during any left move, a robot is in column 0, it would explode. Similarly for up moves. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists a robot R such that all other robots are in positions (x, y) where x \u2265 R's x and y \u2265 R's y. Because then, when moving left and up as needed for R to reach (0,0), the other robots will have x >= R's x (so when moving up, their x is >= R's x, so after moving up, they are still in the grid) and y >= R's y (so moving left, they are in columns >= R's y, which after moving left, stay in the grid). \n\nWait, but R's initial position is (i,j). For R to reach (0,0), we need to move up i times and left j times. Let's say we first move left j times and then up i times. Then, during each left move, other robots must not be in column 0. Similarly, during each up move, other robots must not be in row 0. \n\nBut if another robot is at (x,y) where x >= i and y >= j, then moving left j times would make its y decrease by j. Since initial y >= j, after moving left j times, y >= 0. Similarly, moving up i times would make x decrease by i. Since x >= i, x-i >=0. So the other robot would not explode. \n\nSo the key is that the selected robot (i,j) must have all other robots (x,y) such that x >= i and y >= j. Then, when we move left j times and then up i times, all other robots are safe. \n\nAlternatively, if the order of moves is up first and then left, then other robots must have x >= i and y >= j. So regardless of the order, if all other robots are in positions (x,y) with x >= i and y >= j, then moving left j times and up i times would work. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding if there exists a robot such that all other robots are in positions that are to the right (y >= j) and below (x >= i) of it. \n\nThus, the solution is to find the robot with the leftmost (smallest) y-coordinate and topmost (smallest x-coordinate). If such a robot exists and all other robots are in positions where their x and y are >= this robot's x and y, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO. \n\nWait, but how do we determine the coordinates? Let's see. The input is given in n rows. Let's assume that the first row is the top row (row 0?), or maybe the first row is the top. For example, in the first test case of the example, the robot is in (0,1), and moving left takes it to (0,0). \n\nWait, the code reads the input as n rows, with a loop for a from input down to 0. So in the code, the loop is for a rows, and a is read as the first input. The code is processing the rows in reverse order? Because the code has for(a ... ;a>0; --a). Let's see. The code starts with a= n, and then processes each row, decrementing a. So the first row processed in the code is the nth row (assuming the input is given as row 1 to row n). But wait, maybe the code is reading the rows in reverse order. So, for example, in the input, the first row after n and m is row 0 of the grid, or the top row? Let's think. \n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor(scanf(\"%d%d\",&a,&b); a>0; --a) { ... }\n\nSo the code reads a as the number of rows, then processes a rows. But each iteration decrements a, starting from the input a down to 1. So the first row processed is the original first row of the input (since a starts as the value of n, then for each row, we process from a = n down to 1). Wait, no. For example, if a is 3 (n=3), the loop runs for a=3, then 2, then 1. So for each of these iterations, it reads a row. So the code's first processed row is the first row of the input, which would be the top row of the field. Because the problem's first test case input is:\n\n1\n\n3 3\n\nE E E\n\nE R E\n\nE E E \n\nWait, but according to the example explanation, in the first test case, the robot is in the middle. But according to the code, perhaps the code's rows are processed in reverse order. Let me see. \n\nBut the code's loop is for a=3 (assuming n=3), then a=2, then a=1. So for each a, it reads a row. So the first row processed (a=3) would be the first row of the input. Wait, but in the first test case example, after n and m (3 3), the three rows are:\n\nE E E \n\nE R E \n\nE E E \n\nSo the code's a loop would start with a=3, but in the code, the row processing is for a=3, then 2, then 1. But the input has three rows, so perhaps the code is reading the rows in the order of a=3, which is the first row (top row), then a=2 (second row), then a=1 (third row). But in the code's data structure, perhaps the rows are being stored in reverse order. \n\nWait, the code's variables are not storing the grid, but during processing, for each row, the code processes each cell. For each row (a from input a down to 1), for each cell (b1 from b down to 1). So the code is reading the rows in the order they are given, but within each row, processing the characters from left to right. Wait, no. For each row, the code loops from b1 = b down to 1. So for each row, the first cell processed is the m-th column (rightmost) and then moving left. So the code's processing of each row is from right to left. \n\nWait, the code has for each row (a from input value down to 1), and for each row, the code processes b1 from b (m) down to 1. So for a row in the input, which is a string of m characters, the code is processing each character from right to left. So the first character processed in the row is the m-th character (rightmost), then m-1, etc. \n\nSo the code's variables minx and check are being updated based on the positions of the robots. The code's minx is initialized to 0. When a robot is found (c is 'R'), the code checks if minx is 0. If so, sets minx to b1. Otherwise, if the current b1 is greater than minx, then ... set check to 0. Wait, wait. Let me see the code:\n\nIn the code:\n\nif(c==82) { // 82 is 'R' in ASCII\n    if (minx ==0) {\n        minx = b1;\n    } else {\n        if (minx < b1) {\n            // TODO: Your code here\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the code is processing the columns from right to left. Because for each row, the loop is b1 from b (original m) down to 1. So for a row, the first cell processed is the rightmost column (m), then m-1, etc. So for a given row, the code is processing the columns in reverse order. \n\nSo when the code checks minx (which is the column index of the leftmost robot encountered so far in the current row?), but since the code is processing right to left, when a robot is found (c is 'R'), and minx is 0 (initially), then minx is set to b1, which is the current column. But since we're processing right to left, the first robot in a row would be the rightmost column. Then, any subsequent robot in a column to the left (since we're moving left in the loop) would have a smaller b1. So in this code, minx is being tracked as the leftmost robot in the current row (since processing right to left, the first 'R' is the rightmost, then if another 'R' is found to the left, minx is updated to that smaller b1. But wait, in the code's current setup, when minx is set, then for any other robot in the same row, if minx < current b1, which is to the left (since b1 is decreasing as we process), then that would mean the current robot is to the right of the minx. So in the code, for each row, the code is tracking the leftmost robot (smallest column index) in that row, and comparing with previous rows? \n\nWait, perhaps the code is tracking the minimal column (leftmost) of all robots. The code's minx starts as 0. For each robot found, if minx is 0 (initial state), then set minx to current column. Otherwise, if the current column (b1) is larger than minx (meaning this robot is to the right of the previous leftmost), then ... perhaps set check to 0? Because if there's a robot to the right of the leftmost found so far, then it can't be part of the solution. \n\nBut the code's comment says that minx is actually the max as we read the array in reverse. Wait, perhaps the code is tracking the maximum column index of all the robots. Because when processing rows from top to bottom (since a is processed from input a down to 1, but the rows are read in the order of the input's first row, then second, etc.), and for each row, the columns are processed right to left. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost column in the topmost row. Because, for the robots in higher rows (closer to the top) to be candidates. For example, if there's a robot in row 0 (the top row) and column 1, then any robot in a lower row (higher a) or to the right (higher column) would need to be to the right or below it. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables are being used to track the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Let's think: \n\nThe code's minx is initialized to 0. For each row (processed in the order of input rows, which are from top to bottom?), then for each column (right to left). \n\nWait, the code's a loop starts with the initial a being the number of rows (n). Then, for each iteration, a decreases by 1. So for example, if n is 3, the a loop runs for a=3, 2, 1. So the first row processed is the first row of the input (assuming the first row is the top row), then the second, then third. But in terms of the grid's rows, perhaps the code is considering the first row as the top row. \n\nIn that case, for each row (top to bottom), and for each column (right to left), the code checks for robots. The minx is tracking the leftmost column in the earliest (topmost) row where a robot is found. \n\nSo, for example, the first robot found in the topmost row would set minx to its column. Then, any subsequent robot in the same row that is to the left (smaller column) would update minx. For any robot in a lower row (a > the topmost row), if its column is not >= minx, then check is set to 0. \n\nWait, but the code's logic in the else part is: if minx is not 0 (so some robot has been found before), and the current robot's column (b1) is greater than minx (so to the right of the leftmost robot), then the code would set check=0. Because if there's a robot to the right of the leftmost, then when we try to move left, the leftmost robot would reach 0, but the other robot to the right would be required to move left as well, but if their column is higher than minx, that's okay as long as they are in the same row. Wait, perhaps the code is checking whether all other robots are in positions that are to the right and below the leftmost robot. \n\nSo the code's logic is: find the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Then, any other robot must be in a row that is below or same as this row, and in a column that is right or same as this column. Otherwise, it's impossible. \n\nSo for example, if there's a robot in row i, column j (leftmost in the top row), then any other robot must be in row >= i and column >= j. \n\nBut how is the code tracking this? \n\nThe code's minx starts at 0. For each row (processed top to bottom), for each column (processed right to left). When a robot is found, if minx is 0 (first robot), then minx is set to the current column. For subsequent robots in the same row, if their column is less than minx (since columns are processed right to left, so the first robot encountered in a row is the rightmost, then left ones would have lower b1), then minx is updated. Wait, but in the code's code, for the same row, when a robot is found, and minx is not zero (so some robot has been found before), the code checks if minx < current b1. \n\nBut in that case, since we're processing right to left, for a row, the first robot encountered (rightmost) would set minx to that column. Then, any robot to the left (smaller b1) would have b1 less than minx, so the code's condition (minx < b1) would be false, and nothing happens. But if a robot is to the right (b1 larger than minx), which is impossible in this scenario because the code is processing from right to left. \n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let's take an example. Suppose in a row, the columns are 3, 2, 1. So for a row of E R R E (assuming m=4, columns 1-4?), but processing right to left. \n\nWait, for example, a row with m=3 (columns 1, 2, 3). The code processes b1 from 3 down to 1. So first column 3 (rightmost), then 2, then 1. \n\nIf the row is E R R (columns 1 is left, 3 is right), then processing right to left:\n\nb1=3: E \u2192 no action.\n\nb1=2: R \u2192 if minx is 0, set to 2.\n\nb1=1: R \u2192 minx is now 2. So minx < 1 is false, so code doesn't execute the else part. So no change. \n\nWait, so the code's minx for this row would be 2. But the leftmost robot in the row is column 1, but the code's minx is 2. So this approach is not correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is flawed. Because processing right to left, the first R encountered in a row is the rightmost, but the code's minx is set to that. Then, any R to the left (lower b1) would have b1 < minx. So the code's condition (minx < current b1) would be false, so the code does nothing. So minx remains as the rightmost column in that row. Which is the opposite of what we want. \n\nSo perhaps the code's variable names are misleading. The code's comment says that minx is actually max as we read the array in reverse. So minx is tracking the maximum column index (rightmost) in the earliest row (topmost) where a robot is found. \n\nWait, that's possible. So, the code is tracking the rightmost robot in the topmost row. Then, any other robot must be in a column >= that rightmost column and in a row >= that row. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to find the robot that is in the topmost row. Among all robots in the topmost row, select the rightmost one. Then, all other robots must be in columns >= this rightmost column and rows >= this row. \n\nBecause then, when you move left (for the rightmost robot in the top row), all other robots are to the left of it (so they can't move left enough to go out of the grid). Wait, no. For example, if there's a robot in the top row, column 3 (rightmost), and another in column 2 (same row). Then moving left would require the robot in column 3 to move to 2, then 1, etc. But the robot in column 2 would be moving left each time as well. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, if there's a robot in the top row's column 3 (rightmost), then any other robot in the same row (columns 1 or 2) would be to the left of it. So minx would be 3 (for the first robot), and when processing the other robots in the same row, their b1 is less than minx (3), so the code's else condition (minx < b1) would be false. So no action is taken. But those robots are in columns to the left of the rightmost robot in the top row, which would violate the condition that all robots must be to the right and below. \n\nSo this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code is supposed to output YES or NO based on whether it's possible to move robots such that at least one reaches (0,0) without any explosions. \n\nSo what's the correct approach here? \n\nThe correct approach is to find a robot such that all other robots are in positions (i, j) where i >= x and j >= y, where (x, y) is the position of the candidate robot. Because when you move left and up as needed for the candidate robot to reach (0,0), all other robots will have to move left and up as well, but since their starting positions are to the right and below, after the required moves, they won't go out of bounds. \n\nSo the candidate robot must be the leftmost and topmost robot. Because if there's any robot to the left or above, then that robot would be a better candidate. So the correct candidate is the robot with minimal x (row) and minimal y (column) in the grid. \n\nBut the code's current logic is tracking minx, which seems to be the column of the rightmost robot in the top row. So the code may be flawed. \n\nBut the code's TODO part is in the else block: when minx is not zero, and the current b1 is larger than minx (so the current robot is in a column to the right of the current minx), then something must be done. \n\nWait, but in the code's current logic, minx is initialized to zero. Then, for the first robot found (any row, any column), minx is set to its column. Then, for any subsequent robot, if it's in a column to the right of minx (b1 > minx), then check is set to 0, which would make the overall answer NO. \n\nBut how does that align with the problem's requirements? \n\nSuppose the code is trying to find the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Then, any robot that is to the left of this would invalidate the condition. Wait, no. If there's a robot in the topmost row but to the left of the current minx, then that robot would be a better candidate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's minx is tracking the minimal possible column in the earliest possible row. \n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think of the code as follows: \n\nThe code is iterating through each cell in the grid, row by row, starting from the top row (since the code processes the rows in the order they are given, which is the top row first). For each row, the code processes the cells from right to left (columns from m to 1). \n\nFor each robot found, the code checks if it's the first robot (minx is 0). If so, sets minx to its column. Then, for any subsequent robots, if they are in a column to the right of the current minx (i.e., b1 > minx), then check is set to 0. \n\nSo the code's logic is that the first robot found (the rightmost robot in the top row) is the candidate. Any other robot that is to the right of it (i.e., in a higher column) would make the answer NO. \n\nBut why is that the case? \n\nFor example, consider two robots: one in (0, 3) and one in (0,4). The first robot (0,3) is processed first (since code processes columns right to left). Then, the robot at (0,4) is processed later (since columns are processed right to left, but wait, no. If the row is processed from right to left, then in the row 0, the code would process column m (say, 5) first, then 4, then 3, etc. So if the robot is in (0,4), it would be processed first. So in this case, minx would be 4, and the robot at (0,3) would have b1=3 < minx=4, so the code would set check=0. But that's incorrect because the robot at (0,3) is to the left of the candidate (0,4). So according to the code's logic, the presence of a robot to the left of the candidate would invalidate the solution. \n\nBut that's the opposite of what's needed. Because the candidate should be the leftmost robot. So the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nSo, what's wrong with the code's approach? It seems to track the first robot encountered (rightmost in the top row) and then check if any other robot is to the right of it. But that's not correct. \n\nAh! Wait, maybe the code is processing the rows from bottom to top. For example, the a loop starts with a=n, then a-1, etc. So if the input has rows top to bottom, then the code's a loop would process the first row (given in input) as a=n, then a-1 as the next row, etc. So the first row processed in the code is actually the last row of the input, which is the bottom row of the grid. \n\nOh! That's a critical point. Let's clarify:\n\nSuppose the input for a test case is:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\nRow 0: E E E \n\nRow 1: E R E \n\nRow 2: E E E \n\nThe code reads n=3 and m=3. Then, the a loop starts with a=3. The first iteration of the a loop is a=3. Then, the code reads the first row of the input (assuming that the input is given as three rows after n and m). But according to the code's a loop, a starts at 3 and decreases to 1. So for a=3, the code reads the first row of the input (which is the top row), but perhaps the code is considering it as the third row (since a=3). \n\nWait, no. The code's a loop is for the number of rows. So the code reads n rows. So for example, if the input has n=3, then the code will read 3 rows. The a loop runs a times, starting from the input a (3) down to 1. So the first row read is considered as the first row of the input. But in the code, the rows are processed in the order a=3, 2, 1, which is the same as the input's order. So the first row of the code's processing is the first row of the input (which is the top row), then the second row, etc. \n\nBut if the code's a variable is used to represent the current row number, but the code is processing the input's rows in the same order as given. So row a=3 is the first row of the input, which is the top row. \n\nBut in any case, the code is processing the rows in the order they are given. So the first row processed is the first row after n and m in the input, which is the top row. Then, the second row, etc. \n\nBut during processing each row, the code processes the columns from right to left. \n\nSo for example, in the first row (top row), the code processes the columns from right to left. So the rightmost column is processed first, then the next to the left, etc. \n\nSo the code's first robot encountered would be the rightmost robot in the top row. Then, any other robot in the same row (to the left of the first) would have a smaller column number, so b1 < minx. The code's else condition checks if minx < b1. So in this case, it would be false, so no action. \n\nBut if there's a robot in a lower row (a < current a value?), no. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the earliest row (topmost) that has a robot, and within that row, the leftmost column. But the code's processing order is row by row (top to bottom), and within each row, right to left. So the first robot encountered would be the rightmost robot in the top row. Then, any other robot in the same row to the left would have a smaller column, but the code would not update minx. So minx remains the rightmost column of the top row. \n\nBut this is incorrect, because the leftmost robot in the top row is the desired candidate. \n\nSo the code's logic is wrong. The code is setting minx to the first robot's column (rightmost in top row), and then any robot to the left of it (in the same row) is ignored, but any robot in a lower row (same or higher column) is not checked. \n\nBut according to the code's current structure, the TODO part is where we need to add code when minx is not zero and current robot's column is larger than minx. So in that case, perhaps the code should set check=0, because this robot is to the right of the candidate's column. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nIf the candidate is the rightmost robot in the top row, then any robot to the right (same row) or in a higher column (other rows) would be invalid. \n\nWait, no. If the candidate is the rightmost in the top row, then for other robots to be in columns >= its column and rows >= its row (which is row 0). But other robots can be in the same row but to the left of the candidate. Which is not allowed, because when you move left to get the candidate to (0,0), those robots would have to move left as well, but they are already in a column to the left of the candidate. So when the candidate moves left j times (j being the candidate's original column), those robots would have to move left j times as well. But their original column is less than j, so moving left j times would take them to column - (j - original column), which is negative, hence exploding. \n\nSo, if there's any robot in the same row as the candidate but to the left (smaller column), then when the candidate moves left to (0,0), those robots would have to move left as well, but they would explode. \n\nThus, the candidate must be the leftmost robot in the top row. \n\nSo the code's logic is flawed because it is selecting the rightmost robot in the top row. \n\nTherefore, the code is incorrect. The code's current approach sets minx to the first robot encountered, which is the rightmost in the top row. Any other robot in the same row but to the left would not trigger the code's else condition. \n\nBut these left robots are invalid. So the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's approach is wrong, and the TODO part should be to set check=0 if any robot is to the left of the candidate (i.e., if the current column is less than minx). \n\nBut according to the code's current logic, when processing a row, the code is checking for robots in that row. If the robot is in a row that is higher than the candidate's row (i.e., above), then it's invalid. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing the rows from top to bottom, but for the candidate row (the first row with a robot), any other robot in a row above (which would be impossible) would be invalid. But the code's variables do not track the row of the candidate. \n\nSo, the code's current approach is incomplete. \n\nThus, the code's current logic is to find the rightmost robot in the top row. Then, any robot that is to the right of that would be invalid. But that's not the correct condition. \n\nThe correct approach is to find the leftmost robot in the top row. Then, any robot that is to the left of that would be invalid. \n\nSo how to correct the code? \n\nThe code's TODO is in the else block, when minx is not zero, and the current robot's column is larger than minx (b1 > minx). But according to the code's current processing order (right to left), the first robot encountered in the row is the rightmost. So, when a robot is found in the same row, to the left of the current minx, the code's minx would be updated. \n\nWait, no. For example, in a row where the first robot is at column 3 (rightmost), then minx is 3. Then, processing the next column (2), if there's a robot there, the code's else condition checks if minx < b1 (3 < 2 \u2192 false), so no action. So minx remains 3, but there's a robot to the left of the current minx. \n\nThus, the code's current logic is incorrect. \n\nSo, the code's logic needs to track the leftmost robot in the top row. How to do that? \n\nThe code's current processing order (right to left) for columns. So, in a row, processing from right to left. So, the first robot encountered in a row is the rightmost, but any subsequent robot to the left will have a smaller b1. So, for each row, the code should track the minimal b1 (leftmost column). \n\nBut the code's current logic sets minx to the first robot's column (rightmost), and then doesn't update it when a robot to the left is found. \n\nThus, the code's logic for updating minx is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is, for each row, if there's a robot, track the minimal column (leftmost) in that row. Then, among all rows, find the earliest (topmost) row that has a robot. In that row, find the leftmost column. \n\nThen, check that all other robots are in rows >= that row and columns >= that column. \n\nSo, the code should:\n\n1. Find the earliest (topmost) row with any robots.\n\n2. In that row, find the leftmost column.\n\n3. Check that all other robots are in rows >= that row and columns >= that column.\n\nBut how to implement this in the code's current structure? \n\nThe code's current approach is to read each row from top to bottom (based on input order), and for each row, process the columns from right to left. \n\nSo, for each row, the code can track the leftmost column (smallest b1) where a robot is present. \n\nThe code's minx variable is initialized to zero. For each row, the code should track the leftmost column. But since the code processes columns right to left, the first robot encountered in the row is the rightmost. So, the code's minx for that row should be updated to the smallest b1 (leftmost) encountered in the row. \n\nBut in the code's current code, minx is set to the first robot's column (rightmost) and not updated. \n\nSo, the code's current code is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part needs to handle when a robot is found in a row that is earlier (higher) than the current candidate row, or in the same row but to the left of the current candidate column. \n\nBut the code's variables are not tracking the candidate row. \n\nSo, the code's current approach is incomplete. \n\nTo correct this, the code needs to track both the row and column of the candidate robot (the topmost and leftmost). \n\nBut the code's variables are only tracking minx (column) and not the row. \n\nThus, the code's logic is insufficient. \n\nBut the code provided is incomplete, and we need to fill in the TODO part. \n\nSo, given the existing code structure, how can we adjust it to correctly solve the problem? \n\nThe code's current logic sets minx to the first robot's column. Then, for any subsequent robot, if its column is larger than minx, then check is set to 0. \n\nBut according to the problem's requirements, the correct condition is that all robots are in rows >= the candidate's row and columns >= the candidate's column. \n\nSo, the candidate must be the leftmost and topmost robot. \n\nIn the code's current approach, minx is the column of the first robot encountered. Since the code processes rows from top to bottom (assuming the code's a loop processes the input's rows in order), the first robot encountered is in the top row. \n\nBut within the top row, the code processes columns from right to left, so the first robot in the top row is the rightmost. Thus, minx is set to the rightmost column. Any other robot in the top row to the left of it (smaller column) will have a smaller b1, but the code doesn't update minx. \n\nThus, the code's current logic is incorrect. \n\nSo, to fix this, the code needs to track the leftmost column in the top row. \n\nBut given that the code is processing the columns from right to left, the leftmost column in the top row would be the last robot encountered in that row. \n\nThus, in the top row, after processing all columns, the code's minx should be the leftmost column. \n\nSo, for the top row, the code's minx is initially zero. For each robot encountered in that row, the code should set minx to the minimum of the current minx and the current column. \n\nBut since the code processes the columns from right to left (b1 starts at m and decreases), the first robot encountered in the row has the largest column. Subsequent robots have smaller columns. So, for the top row, after processing all columns, minx will be the smallest column (leftmost) where a robot exists. \n\nBut the code's current code only sets minx to the first robot's column and doesn't update it when a more left robot is found. \n\nThus, the code's current logic is incorrect. \n\nBut the code's existing code in the loop for each cell is:\n\nif (c == 'R') {\n    if (minx ==0) {\n        minx = b1;\n    } else {\n        if (minx < b1) {\n            // TODO: Your code here\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBut in the case where minx is not zero and the current b1 is smaller than minx (i.e., a robot is found to the left of the current minx), the code's condition (minx < b1) is false, so no action is taken. Thus, the code's minx is not updated. \n\nThis is the core issue. \n\nSo, the code's minx is tracking the first robot encountered in the grid (rightmost in the top row). Any other robot in the top row to the left of it would not update minx, leading to incorrect logic. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part should handle cases where a robot is found in the top row but to the left of the current minx. \n\nBut how? \n\nThe code's current structure is processing the rows in order. For each row, the code processes columns from right to left. \n\nThe code's minx is initially zero. \n\nFor the first row (top row), when a robot is encountered, if minx is zero, it sets minx to b1 (the rightmost column in that row). Then, for any subsequent robots in the same row (processed leftwards), if their column is smaller than minx (since b1 is decreasing), the code's else clause is triggered, but minx < b1 is false. \n\nThus, minx remains as the rightmost column. \n\nSo, the code's minx for the top row is set to the rightmost robot's column, not the leftmost. \n\nThis is wrong. \n\nTo correct this, in the else clause, when a robot is found in the same row (since the code is processing rows in order), but has a smaller column (b1 < minx), the code should update minx to b1. \n\nBut the code's current code does not do that. \n\nThus, the code's logic is wrong. \n\nSo, the code's TODO part should handle updating minx to the smaller b1. \n\nBut in the code's current code, the else clause is triggered for any robot after the first. So, the code's current code is:\n\nif (c == 'R') {\n    if (minx ==0) {\n        minx = b1;\n    } else {\n        if (minx < b1) {\n            // TODO: Your code here\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this case, when a robot is found in the same row (but to the left), b1 is smaller than minx. So the code's condition (minx < b1) is false, so the code does nothing. \n\nThus, the code's minx is not updated to the smaller b1. \n\nThus, the code's logic is wrong and needs to be corrected. \n\nThe correct approach is to track the leftmost robot in the top row. So, for the top row, minx should be the smallest column of any robot in that row. \n\nThus, for the code, when processing the top row, every time a robot is found, if it's in the top row, the code should update minx to the minimum of the current minx and b1. \n\nBut how does the code track whether it's processing the top row? \n\nThe code's a variable starts at the input n and decreases. So, for example, if the input has 3 rows, a starts at 3 and decreases to 1. So, the first row processed (a=3) is the top row. \n\nBut no. The code's a loop is for a from input n down to 1. So, the first row processed is a= n, then a= n-1, etc. \n\nBut the input's rows are given as the first row being the top row. So, the code's a loop processes the rows in the same order as given. So, a=3 corresponds to the first row of the input (top row), a=2 to the second row, etc. \n\nThus, during the processing of the first row (a=3), the code is processing the top row. \n\nBut for subsequent rows (a=2, 1), the code is processing lower rows. \n\nThus, the code's minx is set during the processing of the first row (a=3). For any subsequent rows (a < 3), the code should check if any robot in those rows has a column less than minx, or if the row is above the current candidate row (which is not tracked). \n\nBut the code's variables don't track the row of the candidate. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is insufficient. \n\nBut given that the code is incomplete and we have to fill in the TODO part, what can we do? \n\nThe code's current approach seems to check whether all robots are to the right of the first robot encountered (rightmost in the top row). But this is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is that all robots must be to the right and below the candidate robot (leftmost in the top row). \n\nThus, the code's TODO part should check whether the current robot is in a row higher than the candidate row (which is the first row), or in the same row and to the left of the candidate column. \n\nBut since the code's current code does not track the candidate row, this is not possible. \n\nSo, the code's current approach is flawed. \n\nBut given the code's existing structure, perhaps the code's check is only for the column, assuming that all robots are in the same row (the top row). \n\nBut this is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct for the case where all robots are in the top row. \n\nBut according to the problem statement's first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n3 3\n\nEEE\n\nERE\n\nEEE\n\nThe grid has a robot in the middle row (second row, perhaps) and middle column. \n\nThe code processes the first row (a=3) and finds no robots. Then processes the second row (a=2), processes columns from right to left. The middle column is 2. So when the robot is found (assuming column 2), minx is set to 2. Then, no other robots are found. So the code's check is 1, and the answer is YES. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, moving left once is enough. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, the candidate is in row 2 (the second row of the input), which is the middle row of the grid. Thus, any robots in lower rows (third row) must be in columns >= 2. But this is not checked. \n\nSo the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to check for each robot whether all other robots are to the right and below it. \n\nBut how to implement that in the code's current structure. \n\nThe code's current code is tracking minx as the rightmost robot in the first row that contains a robot. \n\nBut the correct code should track the leftmost robot in the first row that contains a robot. \n\nThus, in the code's current code, for the top row (first processed row), the code needs to track the leftmost robot. \n\nBut since the code processes the columns from right to left, the leftmost robot will be the last one encountered in the row. \n\nSo, during processing the row, for each robot encountered, the code should update minx to the minimum between the current minx and b1. \n\nBut in the code's current structure, when processing a row, minx is initialized to zero. So, for the first robot in the row, minx is set to b1 (the rightmost column). Then, for any subsequent robot in the same row (leftwards), minx is compared to b1. \n\nBut the code's current code doesn't update minx in this case. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part should be to set minx to b1 if b1 is smaller than the current minx. \n\nBut how? \n\nIn the code's else block, when a robot is found, and minx is not zero, and minx < b1 (current column is to the right of minx), then the code should set check=0. \n\nBut if the current column is to the left of minx (b1 < minx), then the code should update minx to b1. \n\nBut in the code's current code, this is not handled. \n\nSo, perhaps the code's TODO part is to handle the case where the current robot is in the same row as the candidate (top row), and update minx to the minimum. \n\nBut the code's code is structured such that for each cell, after the first robot, the code checks if minx < b1 (current column is to the right of minx), and if so, does something. \n\nBut the case where b1 < minx (current column is to the left of minx) requires updating minx. \n\nBut the code's current code does not handle this. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part should include code to handle both cases. \n\nBut given the code's structure, perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal column in the first row with a robot. \n\nThus, for each row processed after the first row that has a robot, any robot found in that row must be in a column >= minx. \n\nAdditionally, any robot found in the same row as the candidate must be in a column >= minx. \n\nBut how to track that. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first robot encountered is in the top row and rightmost. For all other robots, if they are in the same row and to the right of the first robot, then check=0. If they are in a lower row, their column must be >= the first robot's column. \n\nBut this is not correct. \n\nThe correct approach is that all robots must be in columns >= the minimal column (leftmost) in the first row. \n\nThus, the code's logic should:\n\n1. Find the first row (top row) that has a robot.\n\n2. In that row, find the leftmost column (minimal b1).\n\n3. For all other robots, check if they are in rows >= this row and columns >= this column.\n\nBut the code's current code does not track this. \n\nBut given that the code's existing code has the following variables:\n\n- a: the current row being processed (from input n down to 1).\n\n- b1: the current column being processed (from m down to 1).\n\n- minx: initially zero, set to the first robot's column.\n\n- check: initialized to 1.\n\nThe code's current code is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    check=1; minx=0;\n\n    read n and m.\n\n    for each row a from n down to 1:\n\n        for each column b1 from m down to 1:\n\n            read character.\n\n            if character is 'R':\n\n                if minx is 0:\n\n                    minx = b1.\n\n                else:\n\n                    if minx < b1:\n\n                        // TODO: Your code here.\n\n                    else:\n\n                        // do nothing.\n\nThus, the code's logic is:\n\n- The first robot encountered sets minx to its column.\n\n- For any subsequent robots, if their column is to the right of minx (b1 > minx), then do something.\n\nBut this is incorrect, because:\n\n- If the first robot is in a lower row (not the top row), then any robots in higher rows (processed later) would be in rows above the candidate, which is invalid.\n\n- If the first robot is in the top row but rightmost, any robots to the left of it in the same row are invalid, but the code does not detect this.\n\nThus, the code's logic is flawed. \n\nTo correct this, the code should:\n\n- Track the candidate row (the earliest row where a robot is found).\n\n- Track the leftmost column in that row.\n\n- For any robot in a row earlier than the candidate row \u2192 invalid.\n\n- For any robot in the same row but column to the left of the candidate column \u2192 invalid.\n\n- For any robot in a row later than the candidate row but column to the left of the candidate column \u2192 invalid.\n\nBut the code's current code does not track the candidate row. \n\nThus, the code is incomplete. \n\nBut given the code's existing structure, perhaps the TODO part should check if the current row is the same as the candidate row and the current column is left of minx, or if the current row is earlier than the candidate row. \n\nBut since the code's current code does not track the candidate row, this is impossible. \n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nBut according to the problem's sample input 6:\n\nSample Input 6:\n\n1\n\n2 2\n\nRR\n\nRE\n\nThe output is NO. \n\nIn this case, the candidate would be the robot at (0,0), but there's another robot at (0,1) and (1,0). When moving left and up to get the (0,0) robot to (0,0), the (0,1) robot would move left to (0,0) and then explode if any further moves are needed. \n\nWait, no. Because the robot is already at (0,0). \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the sixth test case is NO because moving any robot to the upper left would cause others to explode. \n\nBut in this case, there's already a robot at (0,0). So the code's answer should be YES. \n\nBut the sample input 6's explanation says that the answer is NO. \n\nSo I'm a bit confused. \n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is correct for some of the cases but not all. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I think that the correct code for the TODO part is to set check=0. \n\nBut why? \n\nLooking at the code's current logic:\n\nThe code's minx is the column of the first robot encountered (rightmost in the top row). Any subsequent robot that is to the right of minx (b1>minx) would trigger the TODO code. \n\nIn that case, perhaps the TODO code is to set check=0. \n\nBecause if there's a robot to the right of the candidate, then when moving left, those robots would be moving left but would not explode. \n\nWait, no. If the candidate is the rightmost in the top row, then any robot in the same row to the right would be impossible (since the code processes columns right to left, the first robot in the row is rightmost). \n\nThus, the code's current logic is that after the first robot (rightmost in the top row), any other robot in the same row to the right (which can't happen) or any robot in lower rows with columns to the right of minx would set check=0. \n\nBut this doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is that the candidate robot is the leftmost in the top row. Any other robot to the left of it is invalid, but since the code processes columns right to left, the first robot in the top row is the rightmost, and any subsequent robot in the same row is to the left. \n\nThus, the code's minx is set to the rightmost column in the top row. Then, any robot in a lower row (processed in subsequent a iterations) with column less than minx would be to the left of the candidate's column, which is invalid. \n\nBut the code's current code does not check for this. \n\nThus, the code's current code is missing a check for robots in lower rows with columns less than minx. \n\nBut the code's existing code only checks for robots in the same row and to the right of minx. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incomplete. \n\nBut given that the code's existing structure is difficult to modify, perhaps the intended solution is to track the leftmost robot in the earliest row. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part should set check=0 when a robot is found in a row that is processed after the candidate row (i.e., lower rows) and its column is less than minx. \n\nBut how to track that. \n\nBut the code's code does not track the candidate row. \n\nThus, perhaps the correct code for the TODO part is to set check=0. \n\nBut why? \n\nIf the current robot is in a column to the right of the candidate's column (b1> minx), then when moving left, the candidate moves left, and this robot also moves left. But since the candidate's column is minx, moving left enough steps would take the candidate to column 0, and this robot would be in column (b1 - steps). But as long as steps <= minx, this robot's new column is (b1 - steps), which is >= 0. \n\nBut if steps is minx steps (to take the candidate to column 0), then this robot's column would be (b1 - minx). Since b1 > minx, this is (b1 - minx) >= 0. \n\nThus, the robot would not explode. \n\nSo, having a robot to the right of the candidate's column is allowed. \n\nBut the code's current logic sets check=0 in such cases. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut according to the problem's sample input 5, where the answer is YES, the code's logic would output YES. \n\nBut given the code's existing structure, the correct solution is to set check=0 when a robot is found to the left of the candidate's column. \n\nBut how to track that. \n\nThe code's current code sets check=0 when a robot is found to the right of the candidate's column. \n\nBut this is wrong. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part should set check=0 when a robot is found in a row that is processed after the candidate's row (i.e., lower rows) and its column is less than the candidate's column. \n\nBut how to track this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's minx is the leftmost column in the earliest row, and any robot in a column less than minx is invalid. \n\nBut given that the code's minx is not the leftmost column, this approach is incorrect. \n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO part is to set check=0. \n\nBut why? \n\nLooking at the sample input 6, which is supposed to output NO. \n\nSample input 6's code would have robots at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). \n\nThe code's first robot is (0,1) (rightmost in the top row). minx is set to 1. \n\nThen, processing the next column in the same row (0,0) which is a robot. minx is now 0. \n\nBut according to the code's current code, when the robot at (0,0) is processed, minx is 1. Since b1=0 < minx, the else condition (minx < b1) is 1 < 0 \u2192 false. So no action. \n\nThus, minx remains 1. \n\nThen, in the lower row (row 1), processing column 1 (rightmost) \u2192 'E', then column 0 \u2192 'R'. \n\nSo, this robot is at column 0. \n\nThe code's minx is 1. \n\nThus, in the else clause, since minx (1) > b1 (0), the code would execute the TODO part. \n\nIf the TODO part is to set check=0, then this triggers, and the output is NO. \n\nWhich matches the sample input 6's expected output. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part should set check=0 in this case. \n\nSo, the correct code for the TODO part is:\n\ncheck = 0;\n\nThus, whenever a robot is found to the left of the current minx, the code sets check to 0, which makes the output NO. \n\nBut why? \n\nBecause the current minx is the rightmost robot in the top row, and any robot to the left of it (in any row) would require movements that would make it explode. \n\nBut this is not correct in all cases. \n\nFor example, consider a robot at (0,2) and another at (1,1). \n\nThe code's minx is set to 2. The robot at (1,1) has b1=1 < minx=2. So the code sets check=0. \n\nBut the robot at (0,2) can be moved left twice to reach (0,0). The robot at (1,1) would move left twice, ending at (1,-1), which is out of bounds. \n\nThus, the code correctly sets check=0. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO part is to set check=0. \n\nSo, the answer is to replace the TODO part with \"check=0;\"."
