Wait, let's compute T[j+1] mod a[j]. Suppose T[j+1] mod a[j] is r. Then, T[j+1] = q * a[j] + r. So, r is between 0 and a[j)-1. Then, T[j] = T[j+1] + a[j] - r.

So j starts at i-1 and goes down to 1. For each j, T[j] is computed based on T[j+1]. So the next element after j is j+1, which is to the right. Since the array must be increasing, T[j] must be less than T[j+1]. Wait, but in the code, the calculation is T[j] = T[j+1] + a[j] - (T[j+1] mod a[j]). Let's see:\n\nSuppose T[j+1] mod a[j] is r.

But T[j] would then be (k+1)*a[j], which is larger than T[j+1] (since T[j+1] is k*a[j] + r, where r < a[j]). So this makes T[j] larger than T[j+1], which violates the strictly increasing condition. Wait, that's not possible. So this suggests that the code's left processing is incorrect. But that's part of the code provided, which probably works for some examples. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the direction. Wait, wait. Let's re-examine the code. The per loop is for j from i-1 down to 1. So for j = i-1, j+1 = i. Then j = i-2, j+1 = i-1, etc. Wait, the left part is for j < i. So the code is processing j in reverse order, from i-1 down to 1.",

So k can be any integer greater than x / a[j]. The minimal |k| is the integer closest to x/a[j], but greater than it. But how to compute that. If x is positive, then x/a[j] could be positive, and the minimal k is floor(x/a[j]) + 1. For example, x=5, a[j]=3. x/a[j] = 1.666..., floor is 1, so k=2. If x is negative, for example, x=-5, a[j]=3. Then x/a[j] is -1.666..., so k must be greater than -1.666. So possible k's are -1, 0, 1, etc. The minimal |k| is -1 (since -1*3= -3, which is greater than -5). So |k| is 1, which is better than k=0 (0*3=0, which is also greater than -5). But 0 would be allowed, but 0 is not greater than x/a[j], which is -1.666. So k=0 is allowed because 0 > -1.666. So in that case, k=0 is allowed, but then the value is 0. Then, 0 is greater than x=-5, which satisfies the condition. So why choose k=-1? Wait, wait. For x = -5, a[j] =3. We need k*3 > -5. So 3k >-5 => k> -5/3 \u2248 -1.666. So possible k can be -1 (since -1.666 < -1), which gives -3, which is >-5. So k=-1, which gives |k|=1. Or k=0, which gives 0, which is also >-5. So k=0 is allowed, which requires 0 moves (since |0|=0). But how? Because the initial b[j] is 0, and if we choose k=0, then no moves are needed. But wait, in the problem statement, the initial value of b[j] is 0. So if the required value is 0, and that is allowed (as long as it's larger than the previous element), but in the example 1, the second element is 0. So this suggests that the code is allowing k=0 for some elements. But wait, in example 1, the array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. The second element is 0. So that's allowed because -1 <0 <3 <4 <5. So the code must allow for some elements to have k=0. But in that case, for j=2, a[j] is 1. So 0 is 0*1. So k=0, which requires 0 moves. But according to the code's left processing, when j=2 (i=3 in the example), how is T[j] computed? Let's see:\n\nIn the code's left processing, for j=2, T[j] is computed as T[j+1] (which is T[3] =3) plus a[j] (1) minus (T[j+1] mod a[j]). T[j+1] mod a[j] is 3 mod 1 =0. So T[j] =3 +1 -0=4. Which is 4. Then, the number of moves is T[j]/a[j] =4/1=4. But in the example, the second element is 0. So this suggests that the code's approach is not correct. Which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the code is not using the T array to represent the actual b values. Perhaps T[j] represents something else. Maybe it's the cumulative sum of the moves multiplied by a[j], but that's unclear.",

For the right elements, j=4 and 5: in the example, the code would compute their required values. But in the code's current structure, the right part is missing. So the problem is to fill in the code for the right part. So, the code for j from i+1 to N is missing. The code currently has a loop over j from i+1 to N, but the code inside is missing. The user has to fill that in.

So for the left part, the code should compute T[j] as the largest multiple of A[j] that is less than T[j+1]. So the formula for T[j] is floor( (T[j+1]-1) / A[j] ) * A[j]. But how does that relate to the code's current formula? The code's formula is T[j] = T[j+1] + A[j] - (T[j+1] mod A[j]). Wait, let's compute that:\n\nT[j+1] mod A[j] is r. So T[j+1] = q * A[j] + r, where 0 <= r <A[j]. Then, T[j] = (q*A[j] + r) + A[j] - r = q*A[j] + r + A[j] - r = (q+1)*A[j]. But (q+1)*A[j] is greater than T[j+1], which can't be. So the code's formula for T[j] is incorrect. This suggests that the code's left processing is incorrect. But how then does the sample input work? In the sample input 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,1,3,4,5]. The code for i=3 (third element, a=3) would process j=4 and j=5. But according to the sample explanation, the third element is 3, which is 1*3 (so 1 move). But according to the code's left processing, when j=2 (i=3), T[j] would be T[3] (0) + 1 - (0 mod 1) =0+1-0=1. Then tmoves adds 1/1=1. Then for j=1, T[j] = T[2] (1) +1 - (1 mod 1) =1 +1 -0=2, tmoves adds 2/1=2. So total left moves would be 1+2=3. But the sample's left elements (j=1) is -1, which is -1 *1. So moves for j=1 is 1 (subtracting once). But according to the code, it's adding 2 moves. So the code's left processing is incorrect. This suggests that the code is not correct. So how to proceed?",

Wait, but k could be positive or negative. For example, if T[j-1] is -5, and A[j] is 3. Then T[j] could be -4 (k=-2) which is greater than -5, but requires |k|=2 steps. Or, k=0 (0 steps) gives T[j]=0, which is also greater than -5. So in this case, k=0 is better. So the minimal steps is 0. But how?\n\nAh, but in the code's approach, the initial T[i] is zero. So when processing the right elements, j starts at i+1, and T[j-1] is T[i] which is zero. Then, for j=i+1, T[j] must be a multiple of A[j], greater than zero. The minimal k is 1, so T[j] = A[j], which requires 1 move. But in the sample input 1, for i=3 (A[3] =3), the code's T[i] is zero. Then processing j=4 (A[j]=4). The required T[j] must be >0, so minimal k is 1. T[j] =4, moves 1. Then j=5, A[j]=5. T[j-1] is 4. So minimal k is 1, T[j]=5, moves 1. So total moves for right part is 1+1=2. For the left part, j=2 and j=1. But according to the sample explanation, the third element's value is 3 (1 move), but according to the code's approach, T[i] is zero. So that's conflicting. This suggests that the code's approach is not correct. But why is it structured that way?",

So the code is likely incorrect. But given that the code is provided with the left part processing, perhaps the code's approach is to allow the i-th element to be zero (but why?), and then compute the required moves for left and right parts. Then, the minimal moves across all i is taken. But according to the sample, the third element is 3 (k=1), which requires 1 move. But according to the code's processing for i=3, the i-th element is zero (so k=0, requiring 0 moves), which would not contribute to the moves. But that would not match the sample. So the code's approach seems to be flawed. But perhaps the code is correct, and the user is supposed to fill in the missing part for the right elements.",

So the code for the right part would be:\n\nFor j from i+1 to N:\n\n   if (T[j-1] <0) {\n\n       k =0;\n\n       steps =0;\n\n   } else {\n\n       k = (T[j-1] + A[j] -1) / A[j]; // ceiling division\n\n       steps =k;\n\n   }\n\n   T[j] =k * A[j];\n\n   tmoves += steps;\n\n} But wait, how to compute ceil(T[j-1]/A[j]) in code. In C++, for positive numbers, ceil can be computed as (x + y -1) / y.\n\nFor example, ceil(5/3) =2. (5+3-1)/3=7/3=2. But if T[j-1] is positive, and A[j] is positive, then (T[j-1] + A[j] -1)/A[j] gives the ceiling. But if T[j-1] is zero, then (0 +3 -1)/3 =2/3=0, but we need k=1. So this formula would not work. So the code must handle T[j-1] =0 separately. Wait, when T[j-1] is zero, then j must have T[j] >0. So k must be 1. So steps is 1. So the code for the right part should be:\n\nfor j from i+1 to N:\n\n    prev = T[j-1]\n\n    if prev <0:\n\n        k =0\n\n        steps =0\n\n    else:\n\n        if prev ==0:\n\n            k=1\n\n        else:\n\n            k = (prev + A[j] -1) // A[j]\n\n        steps =k\n\n    T[j] = k * A[j]\n\n    tmoves += steps So this handles all cases. So, in code:\n\nrep(j, i+1, N) {\n\n    ll prev = T[j-1];\n\n    ll k;\n\n    if (prev < 0) {\n\n        k = 0;\n\n    } else if (prev == 0) {\n\n        k = 1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        k = (prev + A[j] -1) / A[j];\n\n    }\n\n    T[j] = k * A[j];\n\n    tmoves += k;\n\n} But wait, if prev is zero, then k is 1, which requires 1 move (since steps is k). So T[j] is A[j], which is >0. Yes. Let's test this code with some examples. Example 1: T[j-1] is 5, A[j] is3. prev is positive. k=(5+3-1)/3 =7/3=2. steps=2. T[j]=6. Correct. Example 2: T[j-1] is 0. k=1. T[j] =3, steps 1. Example 3: T[j-1] is -5. k=0. T[j]=0. steps 0. Example4: T[j-1] is 4, A[j] is5. k=(4+5-1)/5=8/5=1. steps 1. T[j]=5>4. Correct. Example5: T[j-1] is 5, A[j] is6. k=(5+6-1)/6=10/6=1. steps 1. T[j]=6>5. Correct.\n\nExample6: T[j-1] is 3, A[j]=3. k=(3+3-1)/3=5/3=1. So steps=1. T[j]=3*1=3, which is not greater than 3. So this is invalid. Ah, here's a problem. If T[j-1] is 3, A[j]=3. Then k must be 2. Because 3*A[j] is 3*3=9 >3? No. Wait, wait, T[j-1] is3, A[j] is3. So k must be >3/3=1. So k=2. But the code computes k=(3+3-1)/3=5/3=1 (integer division in C++ truncates, so 5/3=1). So this would give k=1, steps=1, T[j]=3*1=3, which is not greater than T[j-1]=3. So this is incorrect. So the code's formula for k is incorrect in this case.",

In the case where prev is a multiple of A[j], the formula gives (k*A[j] + A[j]-1)/A[j] = k + (A[j]-1)/A[j], which truncates to k. So k= (k*A[j] +A[j]-1)/A[j] =k + (A[j]-1)/A[j] \u2192 which in integer division would be k. So then k is not sufficient, because k*A[j] is equal to prev. So the code's formula is incorrect for this case. So how to compute k correctly when prev is positive. The correct formula for k is the smallest integer greater than prev/A[j]. Which is equivalent to ceil(prev / A[j]). But in C++, how to compute ceil for positive integers. prev and A[j] are positive.\n\nceil(prev / A[j]) can be computed as (prev + A[j] -1) / A[j]. But in the case where prev is exactly divisible by A[j], this formula adds A[j]-1, so for example, prev=3, A[j]=3. (3+3-1)/3=5/3=1 (integer division). So k=1, but 1*3=3 is not greater than 3. So this is incorrect. Ah, right. So the formula is wrong. So the correct way to compute k is: If prev mod A[j] ==0, then k= (prev / A[j]) +1. Else, k=ceil(prev / A[j]). So, in code, for prev >=0:\n\nif (prev % A[j] ==0) {\n\n    k= (prev / A[j]) + 1;\n\n} else {\n\n    k= (prev + A[j] -1)/A[j];\n\n}\n\nSo for prev=3, A[j]=3: k=3/3 +1 =1+1=2. T[j]=6>3. For prev=4, A[j]=3: 4 mod 3=1 ! =0 \u2192 k=(4+3-1)/3=6/3=2. T[j]=6>4. For prev=5, A[j]=3:5 mod3=2 \u2192 k=(5+3-1)/3=7/3=2 \u2192 T[j]=6>5. So this would work. So, the code for the right part would need to handle this case. So, in code:\n\nfor j from i+1 to N:\n\n    ll prev = T[j-1];\n\n    ll k;\n\n    if (prev <0) {\n\n        k=0;\n\n    } else if (prev ==0) {\n\n        k=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (prev % A[j] ==0) {\n\n            k = (prev / A[j]) +1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            k = (prev + A[j] -1)/A[j];\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    T[j] =k * A[j];\n\n    tmoves +=k;\n\n}\n\nThis would handle all cases. So now, the code for the right part should be filled in with this logic. But how to write this in C++.",

So the answer is to output the code inside the rep loop for j from i+1 to N, which handles the right part. So, the missing code is:\n\n            ll prev = T[j-1];\n            ll k;\n            if (prev < 0) {\n                k = 0;\n            } else if (prev == 0) {\n                k = 1;\n            } else {\n                if (prev % A[j] == 0) {\n                    k = prev / A[j] + 1;\n                } else {\n                    k = (prev + A[j] - 1) / A[j];\n                }\n            }\n            T[j] = k * A[j];\n            tmoves += k;",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about two arrays a and b. Initially, all elements in b are zero. Each move allows us to add or subtract a[i] to b[i]. We need to find the minimum number of moves to make b strictly increasing. So, the goal is to have b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n after some operations, with the least number of steps.\n\nHmm, the approach given in the code seems to use dynamic programming or some greedy strategy. Let's look at the existing code structure.\n\nIn the main function, after reading the array A (which is a_1 to a_N), the code iterates over each possible i from 1 to N. For each i, it calculates tmoves by processing elements to the right and left of i. Then, it takes the minimum moves across all possible i.\n\nWait, the code has a loop where for each i, it's considering maybe that the i-th element is part of the solution, and processing the elements to the left and right. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the per loop (reverse loop) for j from i-1 down to 1. For each j, T[j] is set to T[j+1] + A[j] - T[j+1] % A[j]. Then tmoves is incremented by T[j]/A[j]. So that's for the left part.\n\nThe part that's missing is the loop for j from i+1 to N. The code has a TODO here. So I need to fill in that part.\n\nWhat's the logic here? Let's think.\n\nThe idea is to fix the ith element and then process the elements to the left and right such that each element j is adjusted to satisfy the strictly increasing condition relative to its neighbors.\n\nLet's think for the right part (j > i). For each j in i+1 to N, we need to compute the required T[j] such that T[j] > T[j-1]. Since T is the array for b values after the moves.\n\nWait, the initial code uses T[N+1] array. Let me think: For each i, the code starts with T[i] as the initial value (maybe 0?), and then processes elements to the right and left to compute the necessary steps.\n\nWait, for the right part (j > i), the code starts at j = i+1 and moves up to N. The current code has T[j] being computed somehow. The left part (j < i) is computed in reverse, building T[j] based on T[j+1].\n\nThe problem is, how to compute T[j] for j > i. Let's see what the left part does.\n\nIn the left loop (per j,i-1,1), T[j] is set to T[j+1] + A[j] - (T[j+1] mod A[j]). Then tmoves adds T[j]/A[j].\n\nWait, that formula for T[j] is a bit unclear. Let's think: T[j+1] is the value after j+1. Since j is to the left of j+1 (i is the current position, and j is moving left from i-1 down to 1). So for j, we need T[j] < T[j+1]. Because the array must be strictly increasing.\n\nBut how to compute T[j] such that T[j] < T[j+1], and T[j] is adjusted in multiples of a[j] (since each move adds or subtracts a[j], so the value must be a multiple of a[j]).\n\nWait, no. Wait, each move can add or subtract a[j], so each operation changes b[j] by a[j]. So the possible values of b[j] after k moves are \u00b1k * a[j], right? Wait no: because each move can be either adding or subtracting. Wait, no. For example, if you do two adds: then b[j] is +2*a[j]. If you do one add and one subtract, it's 0. So possible values are all integers multiples of a[j], but with any sign. So the possible values are of the form k * a[j], where k is any integer (positive, negative, or zero). But the number of moves is the absolute value of k. Because each move contributes a[j] or subtracts it. So to reach k*a[j], you need |k| moves.\n\nSo for each j, the value of b[j] is some multiple of a[j], and the number of moves for j is |k|, where k is the coefficient (could be positive or negative). But the total moves for the array is the sum of |k_j| for all j.\n\nThe problem is to choose these k_j such that the sequence b_j = k_j * a_j is strictly increasing, and the sum of |k_j| is minimized.\n\nSo the goal is to find the minimal sum of |k_j| such that k_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 < ... < k_n * a_n.\n\nThe code's approach seems to be dynamic programming. Let's look at how it's structured.\n\nIn the code, for each possible i (from 1 to N), it's considering the scenario where the i-th element is part of the solution, and computes the minimal moves required by adjusting the elements to the left and right of i. Then, it takes the minimum over all possible i.\n\nSo, for each i, the code first processes elements to the right (j from i+1 to N), then processes elements to the left (j from i-1 down to 1). The sum of moves for this i is stored in tmoves, and the overall minimum is tracked.\n\nSo, the left part is handled by the per loop. For each j in the left of i, starting from i-1 down to 1:\n\nT[j] is calculated as T[j+1] + a[j] - (T[j+1] mod a[j]).\n\nWait, T[j+1] is the current value of the next element, and we need to compute T[j] such that T[j] < T[j+1], and T[j] is a multiple of a[j]. But since T[j] must be as large as possible (to minimize the moves needed for the previous elements), perhaps? Because if T[j] is as large as possible (but still less than T[j+1]), then when we move to the left (j-1), the required T[j-1] can be as large as possible, which may require fewer moves (since larger T[j-1] would require a higher multiple, but maybe not. Hmm, perhaps this is a way to compute the minimal moves for the left part.\n\nWait, for the left part:\n\nWe need T[j] < T[j+1].\n\nEach T[j] is a multiple of a[j]. Let's denote T[j] = k_j * a[j]. Then, k_j * a[j] < T[j+1].\n\nThe maximum possible k_j is floor( (T[j+1] - 1) / a[j] ), because k_j * a[j] must be less than T[j+1].\n\nBut since T[j] must be as large as possible (to minimize the required moves for the elements to the left), we choose the largest possible T[j] that is a multiple of a[j] and less than T[j+1].\n\nSo, the maximum possible T[j] is (floor( (T[j+1] - 1) / a[j] )) * a[j]. \n\nBut how is that computed here?\n\nIn the code, T[j] is set to T[j+1] + a[j] - (T[j+1] mod a[j])?\n\nWait, let's compute T[j+1] mod a[j]. Suppose T[j+1] mod a[j] is r. Then, T[j+1] = q * a[j] + r. So, r is between 0 and a[j)-1.\n\nThen, T[j] = T[j+1] + a[j] - r. So that's (q+1)*a[j], but T[j] would be larger than T[j+1], which is not allowed.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because we need T[j] < T[j+1], but this calculation would make T[j] = T[j+1] + (a[j] - r), which is T[j+1] + (a[j] - r) = (q*a[j] + r) + (a[j] - r) = (q+1)*a[j]. So T[j] would be (q+1)*a[j], which is larger than T[j+1], which is q*a[j] + r (since r is less than a[j]).\n\nSo that can't be correct. That suggests that perhaps the code is incorrect, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the direction.\n\nWait, maybe the code is processing the left elements (j < i) in reverse order. So j starts at i-1 and goes down to 1. For each j, T[j] is computed based on T[j+1]. So the next element after j is j+1, which is to the right. Since the array must be increasing, T[j] must be less than T[j+1].\n\nWait, but in the code, the calculation is T[j] = T[j+1] + a[j] - (T[j+1] mod a[j]). Let's see:\n\nSuppose T[j+1] mod a[j] is r. Then, T[j+1] = k * a[j] + r. Then, T[j] is T[j+1] + (a[j] - r) = (k*a[j] + r) + (a[j] - r) = (k + 1)*a[j]. But T[j] would then be (k+1)*a[j], which is larger than T[j+1] (since T[j+1] is k*a[j] + r, where r < a[j]). So this makes T[j] larger than T[j+1], which violates the strictly increasing condition. Wait, that's not possible. So this suggests that the code's left processing is incorrect. But that's part of the code provided, which probably works for some examples. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the direction.\n\nWait, wait. Let's re-examine the code. The per loop is for j from i-1 down to 1. So for j = i-1, j+1 = i. Then j = i-2, j+1 = i-1, etc.\n\nWait, the left part is for j < i. So the code is processing j in reverse order, from i-1 down to 1. For each j, T[j] is set based on T[j+1], which is the next element to the right. So T[j] must be less than T[j+1].\n\nBut according to the code's calculation, T[j] is T[j+1] + a[j] - (T[j+1] mod a[j]). Let's see with an example.\n\nSuppose T[j+1] is 5, and a[j] is 3. Then T[j+1] mod a[j] is 5 % 3 = 2. So a[j] - r = 1. Then T[j] = 5 + 1 = 6. But 6 is larger than 5. That's not possible. So this suggests that the code is wrong, but perhaps the example given in the problem works.\n\nWait the example 1 says:\n\nIn example 1, the final array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. The a array is [1,1,3,4,5].\n\nWait, but in the code's calculation for the left part:\n\nFor example, when i=3 (the third element), j=2 (i-1=2). Suppose T[j+1] = 3 (the third element's value). Then a[j] =1.\n\nT[j] = 3 + 1 - (3 mod 1) = 3 +1 -0=4. Which is 4, which is greater than 3. So that's impossible. But in the example, the second element's value is 0, which is 0. So maybe the code is not correctly handling the left part? Or perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not using the T array as the b array, but instead as some other value. Maybe the code is tracking the required previous value for the left part. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's T array is not the actual b values but some other representation. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the code's initial T array is set to zero. Then for each i, it's processing the left and right parts. Let's think for the right part (j from i+1 to N). The code's missing part is the processing of the right elements.\n\nSo for the right elements (j > i), how should they be processed? Let's see.\n\nWe need to ensure that b[j] > b[j-1] for all j. So for the right elements, starting from j=i+1, each j must be adjusted such that T[j] > T[j-1], and each T[j] is a multiple of a[j], and the sum of |k_j| is minimized.\n\nSo for j=i+1, we need T[j] > T[i]. Then, for j+1, T[j+1] > T[j], and so on.\n\nSo for the right part, processing j from i+1 to N, each j's T[j] must be the minimal possible multiple of a[j] that is greater than T[j-1]. Because this would minimize the number of moves (since the minimal possible multiple is the smallest possible, which requires the least steps (either +1 or -1 steps, depending on which gives a valid value)).\n\nWait, but each move is adding or subtracting a[j], so the steps count as the absolute value of k_j. So to minimize the sum, for each j, we want the minimal |k_j| such that k_j * a[j] is greater than the previous element.\n\nWait, for j in the right part:\n\nWe need T[j] = k_j * a[j], and T[j] > T[j-1].\n\nThe minimal possible |k_j| is the smallest (in absolute value) integer k such that k*a[j] > T[j-1].\n\nSo, for example, if a[j] is 3, and T[j-1] is 5, then the smallest possible multiple is 6 (k=2), which requires 2 moves (adding twice). Alternatively, could k be 3, but that gives 9, which would require 3 moves. So 2 is better.\n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest possible (positive) integer such that k * a[j] > T[j-1]. Because if a[j] is positive (as per input constraints), then the minimal k is ceil( (T[j-1] + 1) / a[j] ). Because (T[j-1] +1) / a[j] rounded up gives the smallest k where k*a[j] > T[j-1].\n\nBut since a[j] is positive, and T[j-1] can be anything (positive or negative), we need to find the smallest k (in absolute terms) such that k*a[j] > T[j-1].\n\nWait, but k can be positive or negative. For example, if T[j-1] is 5, a[j] is 3. Then possible k can be 2 (6, 2 moves), or any higher positive k. But negative k would give even lower values, which would not be greater than 5. So in this case, the minimal k is 2.\n\nIf T[j-1] is -5, then a[j] is 3. Then possible k could be -1 (k*a[j] = -3) which is greater than -5. But then, how? Because the next elements would have to be larger than that. But maybe in some cases, a negative k is better.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the optimal way is to choose the minimal possible |k_j| such that k_j*a[j] > T[j-1]. But how?\n\nLet me think. For each j, given T[j-1], the minimal possible |k_j| is the minimal possible integer k (positive or negative) such that k*a[j] > T[j-1]. Then, the k that gives the minimal |k|.\n\nFor example, if T[j-1] is 5, a[j] is 3. Then possible k is 2 (6), which is 2 moves. Alternatively, 3 is 3 steps, etc. So 2 is better.\n\nAnother example: T[j-1] is 4, a[j] is 5. Then k can be 1 (5), which is 1 move. So that's optimal.\n\nAnother example: T[j-1] is 5, a[j] is 6. Then k=1 (6) which is 1 move.\n\nAnother example: T[j-1] is 5, a[j] is 4. The minimal k is 2 (8) which is 2 steps. But wait, 4*2=8>5, but 4*1=4<=5, so yes. So 2 is needed.\n\nWait, but what if T[j-1] is 0. Then for a[j] = 1, we need k=1 (1 move) to get 1. If we choose k=-1, then the value is -1, but then the next elements would need to be larger than that. But perhaps that's possible. But the minimal |k| in this case would be 1.\n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest possible k (positive or negative) in terms of absolute value, such that k*a[j] > T[j-1]. So how do we compute this?\n\nWe need to find the minimal k (in absolute value) where k*a[j] > T[j-1].\n\nLet's denote x = T[j-1].\n\nWe need to find k such that k*a[j] > x.\n\nSince a[j] is positive, divide both sides by a[j]:\n\nk > x / a[j].\n\nSo k can be any integer greater than x / a[j].\n\nThe minimal |k| is the integer closest to x/a[j], but greater than it.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nIf x is positive, then x/a[j] could be positive, and the minimal k is floor(x/a[j]) + 1.\n\nFor example, x=5, a[j]=3. x/a[j] = 1.666..., floor is 1, so k=2.\n\nIf x is negative, for example, x=-5, a[j]=3. Then x/a[j] is -1.666..., so k must be greater than -1.666. So possible k's are -1, 0, 1, etc. The minimal |k| is -1 (since -1*3= -3, which is greater than -5). So |k| is 1, which is better than k=0 (0*3=0, which is also greater than -5). But 0 would be allowed, but 0 is not greater than x/a[j], which is -1.666. So k=0 is allowed because 0 > -1.666. So in that case, k=0 is allowed, but then the value is 0. Then, 0 is greater than x=-5, which satisfies the condition. So why choose k=-1?\n\nWait, wait. For x = -5, a[j] =3.\n\nWe need k*3 > -5. So 3k >-5 => k> -5/3 \u2248 -1.666.\n\nSo possible k can be -1 (since -1.666 < -1), which gives -3, which is >-5. So k=-1, which gives |k|=1. Or k=0, which gives 0, which is also >-5. So k=0 is allowed, which requires 0 moves (since |0|=0). But how? Because the initial b[j] is 0, and if we choose k=0, then no moves are needed. But wait, in the problem statement, the initial value of b[j] is 0. So if the required value is 0, and that is allowed (as long as it's larger than the previous element), but in the example 1, the second element is 0. So this suggests that the code is allowing k=0 for some elements.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. The second element is 0. So that's allowed because -1 <0 <3 <4 <5. So the code must allow for some elements to have k=0. But in that case, for j=2, a[j] is 1. So 0 is 0*1. So k=0, which requires 0 moves.\n\nBut according to the code's left processing, when j=2 (i=3 in the example), how is T[j] computed? Let's see:\n\nIn the code's left processing, for j=2, T[j] is computed as T[j+1] (which is T[3] =3) plus a[j] (1) minus (T[j+1] mod a[j]).\n\nT[j+1] mod a[j] is 3 mod 1 =0. So T[j] =3 +1 -0=4. Which is 4. Then, the number of moves is T[j]/a[j] =4/1=4. But in the example, the second element is 0. So this suggests that the code's approach is not correct. Which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not using the T array to represent the actual b values. Perhaps T[j] represents something else. Maybe it's the cumulative sum of the moves multiplied by a[j], but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code has a mistake, and the problem is to fill in the right part correctly, but the left part is already handled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let's think again: the code's T array is being used to compute the required moves for the left and right parts, but perhaps the T[j] is not the actual b[j], but the required value that must be achieved for j to ensure that the sequence is increasing.\n\nWait, the code starts with T[i] =0? Because in the initial T array, all elements are set to zero. Then, for each i, the code processes the right and left parts. But in the example, when i=3 (third element), the code's T[i] is 0. Then, when processing the left part (j=2), the code calculates T[j] as 4 (as before). Then, tmoves adds 4. So for j=2, the moves are 4, which would be 4 additions (since T[j] is 4 =4*1). But in the example, the second element is 0. So that's conflicting. So perhaps the code is not correct, but the sample input works because of some other reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's T array is not the actual b array, but represents the accumulated changes. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that the i-th element is kept at 0, and the left and right elements are adjusted accordingly. But in the example, the third element is 3 (so k=1, requiring 1 move). But according to the code's processing, when i=3, the code processes the right elements (j=4,5) and left elements (j=1,2). For the right elements, j=4 and 5: in the example, the code would compute their required values.\n\nBut in the code's current structure, the right part is missing. So the problem is to fill in the code for the right part.\n\nSo, the code for j from i+1 to N is missing. The code currently has a loop over j from i+1 to N, but the code inside is missing. The user has to fill that in.\n\nThe existing code for the left part is:\n\nper(j, i-1,1) {\n    T[j] = T[j+1] + A[j] - (T[j+1] % A[j]);\n    tmoves += (T[j]/A[j]);\n}\n\nWhich computes T[j] as T[j+1] + A[j] - (T[j+1] mod A[j]). Then, tmoves increases by T[j]/A[j].\n\nBut according to the example, for j=2 (i=3), T[j] would be 4, and tmoves adds 4. But in the example, the second element is 0, which is achieved with 0 moves. So this suggests that the code's left part is incorrect, but perhaps this isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's T array is storing the required value for each j, but in reverse order for the left part. Let's see: for j from i-1 down to 1. For each j, T[j] is computed based on T[j+1].\n\nSo for the left part, each j must be less than j+1. So T[j] < T[j+1].\n\nBut the way T[j] is computed is as T[j+1] + A[j] - (T[j+1] mod A[j]). Let's see:\n\nLet's compute T[j] for j in the left part. For example, if T[j+1] is 3, and A[j] is 1. Then T[j] =3 +1 -0=4. Which is larger than 3, which violates T[j] < T[j+1]. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the code. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is adding a negative value. Wait, no. A[j] is a positive integer. So T[j+1] + A[j] - r, where r is T[j+1] mod A[j]. Since r is between 0 and A[j]-1, A[j] - r is positive. So T[j] is T[j+1] + (A[j] - r) = T[j+1] + (A[j] - (T[j+1] mod A[j])).\n\nWhich makes T[j] larger than T[j+1], which is not allowed.\n\nBut this can't be right. So there's a contradiction here. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but the sample input somehow works. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's T array represents the required previous value. For example, when processing the left part, j is processed in reverse order, so j+1 is to the right. So the code is trying to compute the minimal required value for j such that T[j] < T[j+1], and that T[j] is a multiple of A[j], and the moves are minimized.\n\nWait, for j in the left part (j < i), the code is trying to compute T[j] as the largest possible multiple of A[j] that is less than T[j+1]. Because that way, the moves needed for j would be as small as possible. Because the largest possible multiple less than T[j+1] would require the least steps (the minimal possible |k_j|, since k_j is the largest possible such that k_j * A[j] < T[j+1], which would be floor( (T[j+1] -1)/A[j] ), and the number of moves is |k_j|. Since T[j] is a positive multiple, perhaps k_j is positive here.\n\nWait, but if T[j+1] is 5, and A[j] is 3. Then the largest possible multiple less than 5 is 3 (1*3). So k_j is 1, moves is 1. So T[j] =3. Which is less than T[j+1] =5. Then, for j-1, T[j-1] would need to be less than 3.\n\nSo for the left part, the code should compute T[j] as the largest multiple of A[j] that is less than T[j+1]. So the formula for T[j] is floor( (T[j+1]-1) / A[j] ) * A[j].\n\nBut how does that relate to the code's current formula?\n\nThe code's formula is T[j] = T[j+1] + A[j] - (T[j+1] mod A[j]).\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nT[j+1] mod A[j] is r. So T[j+1] = q * A[j] + r, where 0 <= r <A[j].\n\nThen, T[j] = (q*A[j] + r) + A[j] - r = q*A[j] + r + A[j] - r = (q+1)*A[j].\n\nBut (q+1)*A[j] is greater than T[j+1], which can't be. So the code's formula for T[j] is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the code's left processing is incorrect. But how then does the sample input work?\n\nIn the sample input 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,1,3,4,5]. The code for i=3 (third element, a=3) would process j=4 and j=5.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the third element is 3, which is 1*3 (so 1 move). But according to the code's left processing, when j=2 (i=3), T[j] would be T[3] (0) + 1 - (0 mod 1) =0+1-0=1. Then tmoves adds 1/1=1. Then for j=1, T[j] = T[2] (1) +1 - (1 mod 1) =1 +1 -0=2, tmoves adds 2/1=2. So total left moves would be 1+2=3. But the sample's left elements (j=1) is -1, which is -1 *1. So moves for j=1 is 1 (subtracting once). But according to the code, it's adding 2 moves. So the code's left processing is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. So how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to set T[j] to the minimal possible value for the left elements, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process the right elements in a way that ensures T[j] is the minimal possible required to make the sequence increasing. Let's focus on the missing part for the right elements.\n\nFor the right elements (j from i+1 to N), we need to compute T[j] such that T[j] > T[j-1], and T[j] is a multiple of A[j]. The code's current approach for the right elements is missing.\n\nSo, for each j in i+1 to N:\n\nWe need T[j] to be the smallest possible multiple of A[j] that is greater than T[j-1]. Because this would minimize the number of moves (since the minimal required steps would be ceil( (T[j-1] +1)/A[j] ), which gives the smallest possible k where k*A[j] > T[j-1}.\n\nSo, the formula for T[j] would be:\n\nk = ceil( (T[j-1] + 1) / A[j] )\n\nthen T[j] = k * A[j]\n\nthe number of moves is |k|. Since A[j] is positive, and T[j] must be greater than T[j-1], which is a multiple of A[j-1], which may be positive or negative.\n\nWait, but k could be positive or negative. For example, if T[j-1] is -5, and A[j] is 3. Then T[j] could be -4 (k=-2) which is greater than -5, but requires |k|=2 steps. Or, k=0 (0 steps) gives T[j]=0, which is also greater than -5. So in this case, k=0 is better. So the minimal steps is 0. But how?\n\nAh, but in the code's approach, the initial T[i] is zero. So when processing the right elements, j starts at i+1, and T[j-1] is T[i] which is zero. Then, for j=i+1, T[j] must be a multiple of A[j], greater than zero. The minimal k is 1, so T[j] = A[j], which requires 1 move.\n\nBut in the sample input 1, for i=3 (A[3] =3), the code's T[i] is zero. Then processing j=4 (A[j]=4). The required T[j] must be >0, so minimal k is 1. T[j] =4, moves 1. Then j=5, A[j]=5. T[j-1] is 4. So minimal k is 1, T[j]=5, moves 1. So total moves for right part is 1+1=2. For the left part, j=2 and j=1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the third element's value is 3 (1 move), but according to the code's approach, T[i] is zero. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is not correct. But why is it structured that way? Or perhaps the code's initial approach is incorrect, and the correct approach is to iterate over possible starting points and compute the minimal moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the T[j] represents the required value for j to the right of i, but not including i. Wait, the code's i-th element's T is zero. But in the sample, the third element is 3. So this suggests that the code's approach is not considering the i-th element's contribution. So the code is likely incorrect.\n\nBut given that the code is provided with the left part processing, perhaps the code's approach is to allow the i-th element to be zero (but why?), and then compute the required moves for left and right parts. Then, the minimal moves across all i is taken.\n\nBut according to the sample, the third element is 3 (k=1), which requires 1 move. But according to the code's processing for i=3, the i-th element is zero (so k=0, requiring 0 moves), which would not contribute to the moves. But that would not match the sample.\n\nSo the code's approach seems to be flawed. But perhaps the code is correct, and the user is supposed to fill in the missing part for the right elements.\n\nGiven that, the missing part is the code for j from i+1 to N. So the code needs to compute T[j] and add the required moves to tmoves.\n\nFor each j in i+1 to N:\n\nT[j] must be the minimal possible multiple of A[j] such that T[j] > T[j-1]. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the minimal k such that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\n2. T[j] = k*A[j].\n\n3. Add |k| to tmoves.\n\nSo, to compute k:\n\nk is the smallest integer (in terms of absolute value) such that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nBut since A[j] is positive, k must be the smallest integer such that k > T[j-1]/A[j].\n\nThe minimal possible k is the smallest integer greater than T[j-1]/A[j]. That is, k = floor(T[j-1]/A[j]) +1. But if T[j-1] is negative, then k can be negative or zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, T[j-1] is -5, A[j] is 3. Then T[j-1]/A[j] is -5/3 \u2248 -1.666. The smallest integer greater than -1.666 is -1. So k=-1. Then, k*A[j] =-3, which is greater than -5. But 0 is also greater than -5. So in this case, k=0 is better, requiring 0 moves.\n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest possible integer (in absolute value) such that k*A[j] > T[j-1]. But how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of k as the minimal integer such that k >= floor((T[j-1] + 1)/A[j]) +1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to compute k is:\n\nk = ceil( (T[j-1] + 1) / A[j] )\n\nThis ensures that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nFor example:\n\nIf T[j-1] = 5, A[j] =3. (5+1)/3 =2. So ceil(2) is 2. So k=2, 2*3=6>5.\n\nIf T[j-1] =-5, A[j] =3. (-5+1)/3 = (-4)/3 = -1.333. Ceil(-1.333) is -1. So k=-1. Which gives -3> -5. But 0 is also possible, which is better (0 steps). So this approach would not give the optimal solution.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so the problem is to find the minimal |k| such that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nLet's model this mathematically.\n\nWe need k*A[j] > T[j-1]\n\nWe can rearrange this to k > T[j-1]/A[j].\n\nSince A[j] is positive.\n\nSo k must be the smallest integer greater than T[j-1]/A[j].\n\nBut since k can be any integer, positive or negative, the minimal |k| is the closest integer to T[j-1]/A[j] that is greater than it.\n\nSo for example:\n\nIf T[j-1] is 5, A[j] is3: 5/3=1.666. So the smallest integer greater than 1.666 is 2. |k|=2.\n\nIf T[j-1] is -5, A[j] is3: -5/3 \u2248-1.666. The smallest integer greater than -1.666 is -1. So k=-1, |k|=1. But if we choose k=0, which is also greater than -1.666, then |k|=0, which is better. But k=0 is allowed.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=0, 0*A[j]=0 > T[j-1]=-5. So this is allowed, and requires 0 moves. So why choose k=-1 when k=0 is better?\n\nAh, so there's a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Because in the case where T[j-1] is -5, A[j] is3, the minimal k is 0, which gives 0> -5 and requires 0 moves.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find the smallest possible k (in absolute value) such that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nSo for each j, we need to find the k with minimal |k| such that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nThis can be done by finding the k that is the ceiling of (T[j-1] +1)/A[j] when T[j-1] is positive, but when T[j-1] is negative, there may be a k closer to zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute k as follows:\n\nk = floor( (T[j-1] + A[j] -1) / A[j] )\n\nBut this is for positive T[j-1].\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the correct formula to compute k is:\n\nk = ceil( (T[j-1] + 1) / A[j] )\n\nBut this does not account for the cases where T[j-1] is negative.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute k as follows:\n\nIf T[j-1] >=0:\n\nk must be the smallest integer greater than T[j-1]/A[j], which is ceil(T[j-1]/A[j]).\n\nIf T[j-1] <0:\n\nk can be any integer where k*A[j] > T[j-1], which includes k=0 (if T[j-1] <0) and positive k's, and negative k's.\n\nFor example, T[j-1] = -5, A[j]=3.\n\nPossible k:\n\nk=-1 \u2192 -3 >-5 \u2192 yes. Steps 1.\n\nk=0 \u21920> -5 \u2192 yes. Steps 0.\n\nk=1 \u21923> -5 \u2192 yes. Steps 1.\n\nSo the minimal steps are 0.\n\nSo k=0 is optimal.\n\nSo how to compute k in this case.\n\nThe formula should be: k is the minimal integer (in absolute value) such that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nSo for T[j-1] negative, the minimal |k| is max(0, ceil( (T[j-1] +1)/A[j] )).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nk is the minimal integer such that k >= floor( (T[j-1] + 1) / A[j] )\n\nBut this may not capture all cases.\n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to find the minimal k (in absolute value) such that k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nLet's think of this as finding all possible k and choosing the one with minimal |k|.\n\nLet's consider various cases.\n\nCase 1: T[j-1] is positive.\n\nWe need k*A[j] > T[j-1] \u2192 k > T[j-1]/A[j].\n\nThe minimal positive k is ceil(T[j-1]/A[j]).\n\nThe minimal negative k is floor(T[j-1]/A[j]) -1, but this would result in a negative product which is less than T[j-1], so not allowed. So minimal k is ceil(T[j-1]/A[j]).\n\nSteps is k.\n\nCase 2: T[j-1] is zero.\n\nWe need k*A[j] >0 \u2192 k>0. So minimal k is 1. Steps is 1.\n\nCase 3: T[j-1] is negative.\n\nWe need k*A[j] > T[j-1].\n\nSince A[j] is positive, this is equivalent to k > T[j-1]/A[j].\n\nT[j-1] is negative. T[j-1]/A[j] is also negative.\n\nPossible k's are integers greater than T[j-1]/A[j].\n\nThe minimal |k| is achieved by k=0 if 0 > T[j-1]/A[j]. Because 0*A[j] =0 > T[j-1] (since T[j-1] is negative).\n\nFor example, T[j-1] is -5, A[j] is3. Then, T[j-1]/A[j] is -5/3 \u2248-1.666. So k must be >-1.666. So possible k's are -1, 0, 1, etc. 0 is allowed, and requires 0 steps. So k=0 is optimal.\n\nAnother example: T[j-1] is -3, A[j] is3. T[j-1]/A[j] is -1. So k must be >-1. So possible k's are 0,1, etc. k=0 gives 0> -3 \u2192 yes. Steps 0.\n\nAnother example: T[j-1] is -1, A[j] is3. Then k=0 gives 0> -1 \u2192 yes. Steps 0.\n\nAnother example: T[j-1] is -4, A[j] is3. Then k=0 is allowed (0> -4). So steps 0.\n\nSo in all cases where T[j-1] is negative, k=0 is allowed and gives the minimal steps of 0.\n\nOnly when T[j-1] is negative and A[j] is such that 0 is not allowed would we need to choose a different k. But 0 is allowed if T[j-1] is negative.\n\nSo in code:\n\nFor each j in i+1 to N:\n\nIf T[j-1] <0:\n\n   k=0 \u2192 steps 0. So T[j] =0.\n\nElse:\n\n   k = ceil( T[j-1] / A[j] )\n\n   steps =k.\n\nSo the code for the right part would be:\n\nFor j from i+1 to N:\n\n   if (T[j-1] <0) {\n\n       k =0;\n\n       steps =0;\n\n   } else {\n\n       k = (T[j-1] + A[j] -1) / A[j]; // ceiling division\n\n       steps =k;\n\n   }\n\n   T[j] =k * A[j];\n\n   tmoves += steps;\n\n}\n\nBut wait, how to compute ceil(T[j-1]/A[j]) in code.\n\nIn C++, for positive numbers, ceil can be computed as (x + y -1) / y.\n\nFor example, ceil(5/3) =2. (5+3-1)/3=7/3=2.\n\nBut if T[j-1] is positive, and A[j] is positive, then (T[j-1] + A[j] -1)/A[j] gives the ceiling.\n\nBut if T[j-1] is zero, then (0 +3 -1)/3 =2/3=0, but we need k=1. So this formula would not work.\n\nSo the code must handle T[j-1] =0 separately.\n\nWait, when T[j-1] is zero, then j must have T[j] >0. So k must be 1. So steps is 1.\n\nSo the code for the right part should be:\n\nfor j from i+1 to N:\n\n    prev = T[j-1]\n\n    if prev <0:\n\n        k =0\n\n        steps =0\n\n    else:\n\n        if prev ==0:\n\n            k=1\n\n        else:\n\n            k = (prev + A[j] -1) // A[j]\n\n        steps =k\n\n    T[j] = k * A[j]\n\n    tmoves += steps\n\nSo this handles all cases.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nrep(j, i+1, N) {\n\n    ll prev = T[j-1];\n\n    ll k;\n\n    if (prev < 0) {\n\n        k = 0;\n\n    } else if (prev == 0) {\n\n        k = 1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        k = (prev + A[j] -1) / A[j];\n\n    }\n\n    T[j] = k * A[j];\n\n    tmoves += k;\n\n}\n\nBut wait, if prev is zero, then k is 1, which requires 1 move (since steps is k). So T[j] is A[j], which is >0.\n\nYes.\n\nLet's test this code with some examples.\n\nExample 1: T[j-1] is 5, A[j] is3. prev is positive. k=(5+3-1)/3 =7/3=2. steps=2. T[j]=6. Correct.\n\nExample 2: T[j-1] is 0. k=1. T[j] =3, steps 1.\n\nExample 3: T[j-1] is -5. k=0. T[j]=0. steps 0.\n\nExample4: T[j-1] is 4, A[j] is5. k=(4+5-1)/5=8/5=1. steps 1. T[j]=5>4. Correct.\n\nExample5: T[j-1] is 5, A[j] is6. k=(5+6-1)/6=10/6=1. steps 1. T[j]=6>5. Correct.\n\nExample6: T[j-1] is 3, A[j]=3. k=(3+3-1)/3=5/3=1. So steps=1. T[j]=3*1=3, which is not greater than 3. So this is invalid.\n\nAh, here's a problem. If T[j-1] is 3, A[j]=3. Then k must be 2. Because 3*A[j] is 3*3=9 >3? No. Wait, wait, T[j-1] is3, A[j] is3. So k must be >3/3=1. So k=2. But the code computes k=(3+3-1)/3=5/3=1 (integer division in C++ truncates, so 5/3=1). So this would give k=1, steps=1, T[j]=3*1=3, which is not greater than T[j-1]=3. So this is incorrect.\n\nSo the code's formula for k is incorrect in this case.\n\nAh, so the problem is that the formula (prev + A[j] -1) / A[j] works only when prev >0 and prev is not a multiple of A[j].\n\nIn the case where prev is a multiple of A[j], the formula gives (k*A[j] + A[j]-1)/A[j] = k + (A[j]-1)/A[j], which truncates to k. So k= (k*A[j] +A[j]-1)/A[j] =k + (A[j]-1)/A[j] \u2192 which in integer division would be k. So then k is not sufficient, because k*A[j] is equal to prev. So the code's formula is incorrect for this case.\n\nSo how to compute k correctly when prev is positive.\n\nThe correct formula for k is the smallest integer greater than prev/A[j]. Which is equivalent to ceil(prev / A[j]). \n\nBut in C++, how to compute ceil for positive integers.\n\nprev and A[j] are positive.\n\nceil(prev / A[j]) can be computed as (prev + A[j] -1) / A[j].\n\nBut in the case where prev is exactly divisible by A[j], this formula adds A[j]-1, so for example, prev=3, A[j]=3. (3+3-1)/3=5/3=1 (integer division). So k=1, but 1*3=3 is not greater than 3. So this is incorrect.\n\nAh, right. So the formula is wrong. So the correct way to compute k is:\n\nIf prev mod A[j] ==0, then k= (prev / A[j]) +1.\n\nElse, k=ceil(prev / A[j]).\n\nSo, in code, for prev >=0:\n\nif (prev % A[j] ==0) {\n\n    k= (prev / A[j]) + 1;\n\n} else {\n\n    k= (prev + A[j] -1)/A[j];\n\n}\n\nSo for prev=3, A[j]=3: k=3/3 +1 =1+1=2. T[j]=6>3.\n\nFor prev=4, A[j]=3: 4 mod 3=1 !=0 \u2192 k=(4+3-1)/3=6/3=2. T[j]=6>4.\n\nFor prev=5, A[j]=3:5 mod3=2 \u2192 k=(5+3-1)/3=7/3=2 \u2192 T[j]=6>5.\n\nSo this would work.\n\nSo, the code for the right part would need to handle this case.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor j from i+1 to N:\n\n    ll prev = T[j-1];\n\n    ll k;\n\n    if (prev <0) {\n\n        k=0;\n\n    } else if (prev ==0) {\n\n        k=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (prev % A[j] ==0) {\n\n            k = (prev / A[j]) +1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            k = (prev + A[j] -1)/A[j];\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    T[j] =k * A[j];\n\n    tmoves +=k;\n\n}\n\nThis would handle all cases.\n\nSo now, the code for the right part should be filled in with this logic.\n\nBut how to write this in C++.\n\nIn the given code, the missing part is the loop for j from i+1 to N. The code inside the loop should compute k and update T[j] and tmoves.\n\nSo, the missing code would be:\n\nrep(j, i+1, N) {\n\n    ll prev = T[j-1];\n\n    ll k;\n\n    if (prev < 0) {\n\n        k = 0;\n\n    } else if (prev == 0) {\n\n        k = 1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (prev % A[j] == 0) {\n\n            k = prev / A[j] + 1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            k = (prev + A[j] - 1) / A[j];\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    T[j] = k * A[j];\n\n    tmoves += k;\n\n}\n\nThis code would compute the correct k for each j in the right part.\n\nNow, the code's left part processing has an issue, but according to the problem statement, the code given already has the left part, and the user is to fill in the right part. So the code provided by the user has the left part code, and the right part is missing. So the correct answer is to fill in the right part with the above code.\n\nSo the missing code for the right loop is:\n\n            ll prev = T[j-1];\n            ll k;\n            if (prev < 0) {\n                k = 0;\n            } else if (prev == 0) {\n                k = 1;\n            } else {\n                if (prev % A[j] == 0) {\n                    k = prev / A[j] + 1;\n                } else {\n                    k = (prev + A[j] - 1) / A[j];\n                }\n            }\n            T[j] = k * A[j];\n            tmoves += k;\n\nThis should be inserted into the rep(j,i+1,N) loop.\n\nBut the code in the problem has the loop:\n\nrep(j,i+1,N) {\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the code that fills in the TODO is the above.\n\nSo the answer is to output the code inside the rep loop for j from i+1 to N, which handles the right part.\n\nSo, the missing code is:\n\n            ll prev = T[j-1];\n            ll k;\n            if (prev < 0) {\n                k = 0;\n            } else if (prev == 0) {\n                k = 1;\n            } else {\n                if (prev % A[j] == 0) {\n                    k = prev / A[j] + 1;\n                } else {\n                    k = (prev + A[j] - 1) / A[j];\n                }\n            }\n            T[j] = k * A[j];\n            tmoves += k;"
