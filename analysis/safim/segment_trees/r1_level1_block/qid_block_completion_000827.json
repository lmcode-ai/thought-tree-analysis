But in the current setup, since we are processing i from n-2 down to 0, when a stone is moved to i+1, the next check for that j would be in the same column but lower i's. So perhaps the code is processing each stone once per pass, allowing stones to move down one step per pass. For example, a stone in row 0 would take n-1 passes to reach the bottom. But that's inefficient. For example, in a grid with a single stone in row 0 and all '.' below, the code would require n-1 passes, each moving the stone down by one. Each pass would process all cells. So time complexity could be O(n^2 m) per test case. But since n is up to 50, that's 50*50*50 = 125,000 per test case, which is acceptable. But there's a better way.",

So this approach is correct. But then, when a stone is moved down, during the same pass, the code may have already processed the cell (i+1,j) in previous iterations. Because the loop for i is from n-2 downto 0. For example, if we are processing i=3, j=0, and move the stone down to i=4, then when the code proceeds to i=2, j=0, and then the stone at i=4 (now) can't be processed in this pass because i=4 is n-1 (assuming n is 5), which is the bottom row, and the loop starts from i=n-2 (3 in this case). So in the next iteration of the do-while loop, the stone at i=4 (now) will not be processed, because the next pass starts again from i=n-2 (3), so the stone is in row 4, which can't be checked. So in the first case, moving a stone down to row i+1 (now in row i+1), but since in this pass, the code has already processed row i+1 (as part of the for loop? Let me think. Wait, the loop for i starts from n-2 downto 0. So for example, in a grid with n=5 rows (0 to 4), the loop for i is from 3 downto 0. So during a pass, the code checks rows 3, 2, 1, 0. If a stone is in row 3, j=0, and is moved down to row 4, then during the same pass, the code has already processed rows 3 and below. So in the same pass, after moving the stone to row 4, the code will continue processing i=2, 1, 0. So the stone in row 4 is now in the bottom row, and will not be processed in subsequent passes, but in the next do-while iteration, the code will check all rows from n-2 downto 0 again. Wait, but the code's loop is for (int i{n-2}; i >=0; --i). So for each pass (each iteration of the do-while loop), the code checks all cells from row n-2 downto 0. So during a pass, if a stone is moved down to row i+1, which is n-1 (the bottom row), then in the next pass, the code will process rows n-2 (i=3 in the example) downto 0 again. But the stone in row 4 (n-1) is now in the bottom row, so the code will not check it again, since the loop starts at n-2. So that's correct. But if during the same pass, a stone is moved down to i+1, which is in a row higher than i (since i is processed in the loop), then in the same pass, the code has already processed that row (i+1) in the previous iteration of i.\n\nWait, no. Because the loop is for i from n-2 downto 0. For each i, the code checks row i. So for example, in the same column j, suppose during processing i=3, a stone is moved to i=4. Then, during the same pass, when i=2 is processed, the code checks row 2. But the stone in i=4 is not checked in this pass. So the code's approach allows stones to move down one row per pass, requiring multiple passes until all stones are settled. So the code's approach is correct, but it's O(n * m * n) time per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints. So the missing code is to swap the current stone down, which can be done by setting a[i][j] to '.' and a[i+1][j] to '*'. Then set falling to true. So the code inside the if block is:\n\na[i][j] = '.'; \n\na[i+1][j] = '*'; \n\nfalling = true;\n\nBecause when you swap, the stone moves down one cell, and the falling flag is set, which causes the loop to repeat. So that's the code to add. Let me test this with an example. Example input:\n\n1\n\n3 3\n\n*.*\n...\n.. o\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: * . *\n\nRow 1: . . . Row 2: . . o\n\nAfter processing:\n\nStones in row 0 and 0 and 2 (columns 0 and 2). The obstacles are in row 2, column 2. So during the first pass:\n\nProcessing i=1 (n-2 is 1 since n=3), j from 0 to 2. Check row 1, j=0: a[1][0] is '.', no action. Row 1, j=1: '.', no action. Row 1, j=2: '.', no action. Then i=0: For j=0: a[0][0] is '*', a[1][0] is '.', so swap. So a[0][0] becomes '.', a[1][0] becomes '*', falling is true. For j=1: a[0][1] is '.', no action.\n\nj=2: a[0][2] is '*', a[1][2] is '.', so swap. a[0][2] becomes '.', a[1][2] becomes '*', falling is true. Now, after the first pass, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: . . . Row 1: * . *\n\nRow 2: . . o\n\nThe falling flag is true, so another pass is done. In the next pass:\n\nCheck row i=1 (n-2 = 1) again. For j=0: a[1][0] is '*', a[2][0] is '.', so swap. a[1][0] becomes '.', a[2][0] becomes '*', falling is true. j=1: a[1][1] is '.', no action.\n\nj=2: a[1][2] is '*', a[2][2] is 'o', so can't move. Then i=0, all j's are '.'. So after this pass, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: . . . Row 1: . . *\n\nRow 2: * . o\n\nFalling is true, another pass. Next pass:\n\ni=1, j=2: a[1][2] is '*', a[2][2] is 'o', can't move.\n\ni=1, j=0: '.'. i=0: nothing. Then i=1, j=2: check if a[1][2] can move. The cell below is 'o', so no.\n\nFalling remains false. So loop ends. Wait, but in the second pass, after moving the stone from row 1, j=0 to row 2, j=0, the falling flag is set to true. So in the third pass:\n\nCheck i=1 (n-2=1), j=0: a[1][0] is '.', no action. j=1: '.'. j=2: a[1][2] is '*', a[2][2] is 'o' \u2192 can't move.\n\ni=0: nothing. So during the third pass, after processing all cells, no swaps occur. So falling remains false, and the loop ends. So the resulting grid is:\n\nRow 0: all '.'. Row 1: '.' '.' '*'\n\nRow 2: '*' '.' 'o'\n\nWhich is correct. The stones in column 0 fell to the bottom. The stone in column 2 (row 0) fell to row 1, but couldn't go further due to the obstacle in row 2, column 2. Thus, the code seems to handle this case correctly. Another test case: a single column with all stones. The code would process, but no swaps, as each stone is blocked by the one below. So the code leaves them as is. Thus, the correct code to insert is:\n\na[i][j] = '.';\na[i+1][j] = '*';\nfalling = true;",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to simulate stones falling down in a grid. The stones (marked '*') fall until they hit an obstacle ('o'), another stone that's already settled, or the bottom of the grid. So, the code provided has a loop that keeps checking for stones that can fall. The main part to fill is the TODO section where, when a stone is found that can move down (current cell is '*' and the one below is '.'), we need to swap them, right?\n\nWait, but how do we simulate the falling? The current code is using a do-while loop that continues as long as any stone is falling. For each iteration, it starts from the bottom up (since i starts at n-2, which is the second to last row, because the bottom row can't have stones that can fall further). For each cell in the grid, if it's a stone and the cell below is empty, we need to move it down.\n\nBut in the code structure, when such a case is found, we have to swap the '*' and '.' so the stone moves down. But wait, doing this for each stone one by one might not be efficient. Because when we process from the bottom up, maybe moving stones down step by step.\n\nWait, for example, if a stone is in row i, column j, and the cell below is '.', swapping them would move the stone down by one. But during the same iteration, if we check higher rows first (since the loop is for i from n-2 down to 0), then after moving a stone down to i+1, when processing the next i (i-1), maybe there's another stone that can now move into the cell i+1. But in the code's current setup, each stone is checked once per iteration. So the loop (do-while) continues until no more stones can fall in an entire pass.\n\nSo the approach is: for each pass, check all stones from the bottom up. When a stone can move down, swap it with the cell below, mark falling as true (so another pass is done). This way, each pass allows the stones to fall one step. But since stones can move multiple steps in one iteration, this might take multiple passes. For example, a stone at row 0 in a grid with all '.' below would need to be processed in each pass, moving down one row each time until it hits the bottom.\n\nBut this approach might be inefficient for grids where stones have to fall many times, but given the constraints (n and m up to 50, and t up to 100), this approach is acceptable because even in the worst case, each stone would take O(n) steps, and each pass is O(nm), leading to O(n^2 m) per test case. For n=50, that's 50*50*50 = 125000 per test case, multiplied by t=100 gives 12,500,000 operations, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code's loop is correct. Now, the TODO part is where we need to handle the swap. So when a[i][j] is '*' and a[i+1][j] is '.', we need to swap them. Also, since this movement happened, we should set falling to true, so the loop continues. Additionally, after swapping, perhaps we can skip checking the same cell again in this pass? Or maybe not, because the code is designed to process all cells each pass.\n\nWait, in the code's structure, during a single pass (each iteration of the do-while loop), the inner loops check every cell from the bottom up (i starts at n-2, so the highest possible i is 0). For each cell, if the current cell is a stone and the cell below is empty, swap them. But once you swap, the stone moves to i+1. However, in the next iteration of the loop (i starts at n-2 again), maybe that stone can move further down.\n\nWait, no. Because during this current pass, after swapping a stone at (i,j) to (i+1,j), when the loop proceeds to the next j (same i), or lower i's, perhaps another stone in i-1, j can now move down. But in the current setup, since we are processing i from n-2 down to 0, when a stone is moved to i+1, the next check for that j would be in the same column but lower i's. So perhaps the code is processing each stone once per pass, allowing stones to move down one step per pass. For example, a stone in row 0 would take n-1 passes to reach the bottom.\n\nBut that's inefficient. For example, in a grid with a single stone in row 0 and all '.' below, the code would require n-1 passes, each moving the stone down by one. Each pass would process all cells. So time complexity could be O(n^2 m) per test case. But since n is up to 50, that's 50*50*50 = 125,000 per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nBut there's a better way. Instead of moving each stone down one step per pass, perhaps process each column and determine where each stone will land. Because for each column, the stones will stack from the bottom up, with obstacles acting as barriers.\n\nSo another approach is to process each column independently. For each column, iterate from the bottom up, keep track of the next position where a stone can land. For example:\n\nFor column j:\nStart from the bottom (row n-1) upwards. Keep track of the next available position. When you encounter a stone, place it at the next available position and decrement the available position. If you encounter an obstacle, the next available position is set to just above the obstacle. If you encounter a '.', do nothing but if the available position is higher than the current row, then when a stone is found, it can fall into the available spot.\n\nBut how to do this in code? Let's see.\n\nFor each column j:\n\nInitialize the lowest available position as the bottom row (n-1).\n\nThen, iterate from bottom to top (i from n-1 downto 0):\n\nIf current cell is an obstacle ('o'), then the next available position is i-1 (since stones can't go through obstacles; any stones above will land just above this obstacle).\n\nIf current cell is a stone ('*'), then we move it to the current available position. So swap the current cell with the available position cell (but since we're processing from bottom up, maybe we need to collect the stones and then place them in the correct order). Wait, perhaps for a column, collect all the stones and obstacles, then build the column from bottom up:\n\n- Start from the bottom. The stones will be placed as low as possible, but above obstacles.\n\nAlternative approach for each column:\n\nCollect all the characters in the column, then process them to build the new column.\n\nFor example, in a column, the stones will fall, so the new column will have, from bottom to top:\n\n- Obstacles remain in their positions.\n\n- Stones fill the positions below the obstacles, stacking up.\n\nSo processing each column from bottom to top:\n\nWe can track the position where the next stone would land.\n\nStart from the bottom (i = n-1) and move upward.\n\nWe can create a new column as follows:\n\n- Initialize a list for the new column.\n\n- The current position starts at the bottom (n-1).\n\n- Iterate i from n-1 downto 0:\n\nIf the original cell is 'o', then in the new column, this position is 'o', and the next available position is i-1 (since stones can't go below the obstacle).\n\nIf the original cell is '*', we place it in the current available position, then decrement the available position.\n\nIf it's '.', do nothing (but the available position remains until we hit a stone or obstacle).\n\nWait, but this approach needs to collect the stones and then place them in the available positions from the bottom up, considering obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, for each column j:\n\n- Create a list of characters in the column, from bottom to top. Wait no, perhaps process the column from bottom to top, but track where the next stone should fall.\n\nWait, here's a possible algorithm for a single column:\n\nInitialize the next_available_row to the bottom row (n-1).\n\nCreate a new column, initializing all to '.'.\n\nThen, iterate over each cell in the column from bottom to top (i from n-1 downto 0):\n\nIf the original cell is 'o':\n\n- Place 'o' in the new column at position i.\n\n- Update next_available_row to i-1 (since stones can't go below this obstacle).\n\nIf the original cell is '*':\n\n- If next_available_row >= 0:\n\n   Place '*' at next_available_row in the new column.\n\n   Decrement next_available_row by 1.\n\n(So stones are placed as low as possible)\n\nIf the original cell is '.', do nothing (since '.' doesn't affect the stones).\n\nWait, but the '.' in the original cell might be filled by a stone from above. So perhaps this approach is to collect all the stones in the column, then place them starting from the bottom, but considering obstacles.\n\nWait, another way: for each column, collect all the obstacles and stones. Then, build the new column by placing obstacles in their original positions and filling the stones between the obstacles and the bottom.\n\nBut how to handle the order?\n\nAlternatively:\n\nProcess the column from the bottom up, keeping track of where the next stone can be placed.\n\nStart with next_pos = n-1.\n\nThen for i from n-1 downto 0:\n\nIf the current cell is an obstacle, then in the new column, place 'o' at i. Then, next_pos is set to i-1.\n\nIf the current cell is a stone, then we can place it at next_pos (if possible). So in the new column, set next_pos to next_pos-1 (since after placing, the next stone will go above).\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nWait, perhaps for each column j:\n\nInitialize next_pos as the bottom index (n-1).\n\nCreate a new column array, filled with '.'.\n\nThen iterate from bottom to top (i from n-1 downto 0):\n\nIf the original cell is 'o', then in the new column, set new_col[i] = 'o', and set next_pos to i-1.\n\nIf the original cell is '*', then check if next_pos is >=0. If so, set new_col[next_pos] = '*', and decrement next_pos by 1.\n\nIgnore '.'.\n\nWait, but in this case, the stones in the original column (from bottom to top) are being placed as low as possible. But when processing from bottom to top, the original stone may have been higher up. For example, suppose in the original column, there's a stone at row 0 (top), and all '.' below. Then, processing from bottom to top, the stone is found at i=0. next_pos is initially n-1. Since it's a stone, we place it at next_pos (n-1), decrement next_pos to n-2. So the new column will have a '*' at the bottom. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: original column has 'o' at i=2 (0-based, n=4 rows). Then, next_pos is initially 3. When processing i=3 (bottom), it's '.', so nothing. Then i=2: it's 'o', so new_col[2] = 'o', next_pos is 1. Then i=1: perhaps a stone. So place at next_pos=1, decrement to 0. i=0: if it's a stone, place at 0, decrement to -1. So the new column has stones at 1 and 0 (assuming original had 'o' at 2 and stones at 1 and 0? Or wait, maybe the original column has 'o' at 2, and stones at 3 and 1 and 0. Wait, no. Because when processing from bottom to top, the first cell is i=3 (original column's bottom). Suppose the original column has stones in rows 3, 2, 1, 0. Then processing:\n\ni=3: original cell is '*'. next_pos is 3. So new_col[3] = '*', next_pos=2.\n\ni=2: original cell is '*'. new_col[2] = '*', next_pos=1.\n\ni=1: original cell is '*'. new_col[1] = '*', next_pos=0.\n\ni=0: original cell is '*'. new_col[0] = '*', next_pos=-1.\n\nBut that's correct. The new column is filled with stones from the bottom up. But this is not the desired behavior. Because in the original problem, stones fall down. So the stones in the original column should be moved as low as possible. So for example, in a column where all are stones and no obstacles, the new column is the same as the original.\n\nWait, but the problem says that stones fall down. So if all are stones, they can't move. But in the example where the original column has stones in all positions, the code would place all stones in the new column's positions, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: original column has '.' in all positions except a stone at row 0. Then, processing:\n\ni=3: '.' -> nothing.\n\ni=2: '.' -> nothing.\n\ni=1: '.' -> nothing.\n\ni=0: '*', next_pos=3. So new_col[3] = '*', next_pos=2.\n\nThus, the stone moves to the bottom. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach for each column would correctly simulate the stones falling. So the algorithm is to process each column independently, building the new column by placing obstacles and stones in their correct positions.\n\nThis approach is O(nm) per test case, which is much more efficient than the initial code's approach of simulating each step. But the initial code given uses the iterative approach of checking each cell and moving stones down step by step. However, the user's code is structured with a do-while loop that continues until no stones fall in a pass.\n\nBut the code is incomplete. The code's TODO section is where, when a stone can move down, we need to swap it with the cell below. But perhaps the code's approach is correct, but just needs to swap and set falling to true.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nWhen a stone is found at (i,j) and a[i+1][j] is '.', we need to swap a[i][j] and a[i+1][j], and set falling to true.\n\nWait, but swapping them would move the stone down by one. Then, in the same pass, if i was higher up, the next stone in (i-1, j) would check if (i, j) is '.' (since it was swapped). But since the loop is processing i from n-2 downto 0, after swapping (i,j) and (i+1,j), the next i is i-1. So, during the same pass, for a stone in (i-1, j), the cell below (i, j) is now the stone, so it can't move. Thus, each stone can move down at most once per pass. So the code's approach is to simulate each step of the stones, but with the do-while loop running until no movement occurs.\n\nBut this is correct. For example, a stone in row 0 would move down by one in each pass. So after n-1 passes, it would reach the bottom.\n\nBut the code is written to check all rows from n-2 downto 0. So for each pass, the stones are checked from bottom up. When a stone can move down (i+1 is '.'), it swaps and sets falling to true, which triggers another iteration of the do-while loop.\n\nBut the code's TODO section is missing the code to swap the stones and set falling to true.\n\nSo the missing code is: swap a[i][j] and a[i+1][j], and set falling to true.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (a[i][j] == '*' && a[i+1][j] == '.') {\n\n   swap(a[i][j], a[i+1][j]);\n\n   falling = true;\n\n}\n\nBut wait, in C++, to swap two characters, we can do:\n\nstd::swap(a[i][j], a[i+1][j]);\n\nBut since the strings are mutable (since a is a vector of strings, and we are modifying them), perhaps the code can be written as:\n\na[i][j] = '.';\n\na[i+1][j] = '*';\n\nBecause swapping is equivalent to moving the stone down and replacing the current cell with '.'.\n\nBecause when you find a stone at (i,j) and '.' at (i+1,j), you can set (i,j) to '.' and (i+1,j) to '*'.\n\nThis is perhaps more efficient than swapping, but the end result is the same.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nif (a[i][j] == '*' && a[i+1][j] == '.') {\n\n   a[i][j] = '.'; \n\n   a[i+1][j] = '*'; \n\n   falling = true;\n\n}\n\nThis will move the stone down one cell. And since during the same pass, other stones in the same column may now be able to move, but the code's approach is to process each cell once per pass, and the do-while loop will repeat until no stones move in a pass.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nBut then, when a stone is moved down, during the same pass, the code may have already processed the cell (i+1,j) in previous iterations. Because the loop for i is from n-2 downto 0. For example, if we are processing i=3, j=0, and move the stone down to i=4, then when the code proceeds to i=2, j=0, and then the stone at i=4 (now) can't be processed in this pass because i=4 is n-1 (assuming n is 5), which is the bottom row, and the loop starts from i=n-2 (3 in this case). So in the next iteration of the do-while loop, the stone at i=4 (now) will not be processed, because the next pass starts again from i=n-2 (3), so the stone is in row 4, which can't be checked. So in the first case, moving a stone down to row i+1 (now in row i+1), but since in this pass, the code has already processed row i+1 (as part of the for loop? Let me think.\n\nWait, the loop for i starts from n-2 downto 0. So for example, in a grid with n=5 rows (0 to 4), the loop for i is from 3 downto 0. So during a pass, the code checks rows 3, 2, 1, 0. If a stone is in row 3, j=0, and is moved down to row 4, then during the same pass, the code has already processed rows 3 and below. So in the same pass, after moving the stone to row 4, the code will continue processing i=2, 1, 0. So the stone in row 4 is now in the bottom row, and will not be processed in subsequent passes, but in the next do-while iteration, the code will check all rows from n-2 downto 0 again.\n\nWait, but the code's loop is for (int i{n-2}; i >=0; --i). So for each pass (each iteration of the do-while loop), the code checks all cells from row n-2 downto 0. So during a pass, if a stone is moved down to row i+1, which is n-1 (the bottom row), then in the next pass, the code will process rows n-2 (i=3 in the example) downto 0 again. But the stone in row 4 (n-1) is now in the bottom row, so the code will not check it again, since the loop starts at n-2. So that's correct.\n\nBut if during the same pass, a stone is moved down to i+1, which is in a row higher than i (since i is processed in the loop), then in the same pass, the code has already processed that row (i+1) in the previous iteration of i.\n\nWait, no. Because the loop is for i from n-2 downto 0. For each i, the code checks row i. So for example, in the same column j, suppose during processing i=3, a stone is moved to i=4. Then, during the same pass, when i=2 is processed, the code checks row 2. But the stone in i=4 is not checked in this pass. So the code's approach allows stones to move down one row per pass, requiring multiple passes until all stones are settled.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct, but it's O(n * m * n) time per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.\n\nSo the missing code is to swap the current stone down, which can be done by setting a[i][j] to '.' and a[i+1][j] to '*'. Then set falling to true.\n\nSo the code inside the if block is:\n\na[i][j] = '.'; \n\na[i+1][j] = '*'; \n\nfalling = true;\n\nBecause when you swap, the stone moves down one cell, and the falling flag is set, which causes the loop to repeat.\n\nSo that's the code to add. Let me test this with an example.\n\nExample input:\n\n1\n\n3 3\n\n*.*\n...\n..o\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: * . *\n\nRow 1: . . .\n\nRow 2: . . o\n\nAfter processing:\n\nStones in row 0 and 0 and 2 (columns 0 and 2). The obstacles are in row 2, column 2.\n\nSo during the first pass:\n\nProcessing i=1 (n-2 is 1 since n=3), j from 0 to 2.\n\nCheck row 1, j=0: a[1][0] is '.', no action.\n\nRow 1, j=1: '.', no action.\n\nRow 1, j=2: '.', no action.\n\nThen i=0:\n\nFor j=0: a[0][0] is '*', a[1][0] is '.', so swap. So a[0][0] becomes '.', a[1][0] becomes '*', falling is true.\n\nFor j=1: a[0][1] is '.', no action.\n\nj=2: a[0][2] is '*', a[1][2] is '.', so swap. a[0][2] becomes '.', a[1][2] becomes '*', falling is true.\n\nNow, after the first pass, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: . . .\n\nRow 1: * . *\n\nRow 2: . . o\n\nThe falling flag is true, so another pass is done.\n\nIn the next pass:\n\nCheck row i=1 (n-2 = 1) again.\n\nFor j=0: a[1][0] is '*', a[2][0] is '.', so swap. a[1][0] becomes '.', a[2][0] becomes '*', falling is true.\n\nj=1: a[1][1] is '.', no action.\n\nj=2: a[1][2] is '*', a[2][2] is 'o', so can't move.\n\nThen i=0, all j's are '.'.\n\nSo after this pass, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: . . .\n\nRow 1: . . *\n\nRow 2: * . o\n\nFalling is true, another pass.\n\nNext pass:\n\ni=1, j=2: a[1][2] is '*', a[2][2] is 'o', can't move.\n\ni=1, j=0: '.'.\n\ni=0: nothing.\n\nThen i=1, j=2: check if a[1][2] can move. The cell below is 'o', so no.\n\nFalling remains false. So loop ends.\n\nWait, but in the second pass, after moving the stone from row 1, j=0 to row 2, j=0, the falling flag is set to true. So in the third pass:\n\nCheck i=1 (n-2=1), j=0: a[1][0] is '.', no action.\n\nj=1: '.'.\n\nj=2: a[1][2] is '*', a[2][2] is 'o' \u2192 can't move.\n\ni=0: nothing.\n\nSo during the third pass, after processing all cells, no swaps occur. So falling remains false, and the loop ends.\n\nSo the resulting grid is:\n\nRow 0: all '.'.\n\nRow 1: '.' '.' '*'\n\nRow 2: '*' '.' 'o'\n\nWhich is correct. The stones in column 0 fell to the bottom. The stone in column 2 (row 0) fell to row 1, but couldn't go further due to the obstacle in row 2, column 2.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle this case correctly.\n\nAnother test case: a single column with all stones. The code would process, but no swaps, as each stone is blocked by the one below. So the code leaves them as is.\n\nThus, the correct code to insert is:\n\na[i][j] = '.';\na[i+1][j] = '*';\nfalling = true;"
