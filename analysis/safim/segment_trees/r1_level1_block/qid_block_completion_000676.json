But how?\n\nWait, in the TODO part, the code is inside the if (sk_b.top().c == segr[i].c) block. So the code has to handle the case where the top is same color.

Which could be a problem because those elements could have a l <= segr[j].r and would have been added again. But in reality, once pos has passed those segments, they are not added again. Wait, the 'pos' variable starts at 1 and increments until segl[pos].l <= segr[i].r. So for each i, 'pos' starts from where it left off in the previous i.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to fill in the missing code in the work() function where the comment says TODO. The problem is about finding the minimum distance for each segment to the nearest differently colored segment. The existing code seems to handle some parts, but there's a gap here.\n\nSo, the work function is part of the solution. The code is using a priority queue, maybe a max-heap based on position. Let me try to understand what's happening here. \n\nThe segments are sorted by their right end (cmp_r_s) and stored in segr. Then they are sorted by left end (cmp_l_s) and stored in segl. Then, for each segment in segr (sorted by right), the code is processing them. The loop with 'pos' is adding segments to sk_b where segl[pos].l <= segr[i].r. So sk_b contains all segments that start (left) before or at the current segr[i].r. \n\nThe sk_b is a priority queue that's ordered by pos (which I think is the right end of the segments from segl), so the top element has the maximum pos (right end) because the comparator uses a.pos < b.pos, but wait, the priority_queue's default is a max-heap, so the top is the largest. Wait, the cmp_b struct has operator()(a, b) returning a.pos < b.pos. So the priority_queue orders elements such that the largest pos is at the top. Because in a priority_queue, the comparator returns true if a should come before b, but in the standard setup, the elements are ordered with the \"highest\" priority at the top. So if the comparator says a.pos < b.pos, then when inserting, the queue will place elements in a way that the top is the largest pos. So sk_b.top().pos is the maximum right end among the segments in the queue.\n\nFor each segr[i], which is a segment sorted by their right end, the code is checking the top element of sk_b. If the color of the top element is the same as segr[i], then we need to look for the next element in the priority queue that has a different color. Because the current top is same color, so we can't use it, so we need to pop it and check the next ones until we find one with different color. But how do we handle that efficiently?\n\nIn the code, when the top's color is same as segr[i].c, the current code leaves that part to be filled. The existing code after the else clause updates ans[segr[i].id] with the minimum between its current value and the max(0, segr[i].l - sk_b.top().pos). So that's the case when the top is a different color. But if the top is same color, we need to look for the next one.\n\nBut how to do that? Because we can't just pop elements from the priority_queue here since they might be needed for other segments. So perhaps we need to temporarily pop elements until we find one with a different color, then calculate the distance, and then push them back. But that's not efficient for large n. Alternatively, maybe the code is designed to process all possible candidates in the queue, but in the current approach, it's only considering the top element. However, the correct approach would require checking all possible candidates in the queue for the closest one with different color.\n\nWait, but this might not be feasible given the time constraints. So perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about what's the minimal possible distance here. The code is processing each segr[i], which is sorted by their right end. For each such segment, the code is considering all segments in segl (sorted by left) that have left <= segr[i].r. These are the segments that start before or at the right end of segr[i]. Since sk_b is a priority queue sorted by their right end (pos is segl[pos].r), the top has the maximum right end. So the maximum possible overlap is with the top element. Wait, no. The segments in sk_b are the ones whose left is <= current segr[i].r. The segr[i] is sorted by their right end. So when we process segr[i], which has a right end at some value, the sk_b contains all segments that have left <= segr[i].r. The code is trying to find the closest segment (from the left side?) to segr[i]. \n\nWait, the current code's line in the else clause calculates the distance as max(0, segr[i].l - sk_b.top().pos). So segr[i].l is the left end of the current segment (since segr is sorted by right, but the original l and r are preserved). The sk_b.top().pos is the right end of some other segment. So if the current segr[i].l is greater than that pos, the distance is the difference. Otherwise, they overlap (since the other segment's left is <= segr[i].r and its right is >= current segr[i].l). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose segr[i] has l1 and r1. The other segment has l2 and r2. The code is considering the case where l2 <= r1 (since it's in sk_b). Now, if r2 (sk_b.top().pos) >= l1, then the segments overlap, so distance is 0. Otherwise, the distance is l1 - r2.\n\nSo the current code is checking the top of the priority queue (the one with the largest r2) and sees if it's a different color. If yes, then the distance is max(0, l1 - r2). But if the top is same color, then we need to find the next largest r2 in the queue that has a different color. But how? Because the next elements in the queue may have smaller r2, but perhaps have different color.\n\nBut the code as written only checks the top. So when the top is same color, the code needs to check the next elements. But since the priority_queue is a max-heap, popping the top and checking the next would give the next largest. But the problem is that once we pop them, they can't be reused for other segments. So this approach isn't feasible because those popped elements might be needed when processing other segr[i] elements. So how can we handle this?\n\nWait, perhaps the work() function is being called twice, once with the original segments and once with mirrored coordinates (the code swaps l and r after flipping them around 1e9). So maybe the work function is handling the left and right passes. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThe main idea in the code is to process the segments in two passes: once normally, and once mirrored, to cover all possible directions. But the work function's logic is to process for each segment the closest segment that comes before (in some order) and then after. But the exact approach is a bit unclear.\n\nBack to the problem: when the top of the priority queue (sk_b) is the same color as the current segment (segr[i].c), we need to look for the next element in the queue with a different color. But how to do that without modifying the queue (since other segments may need to process those elements).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is maintaining the sk_b as a data structure that allows quickly finding the closest segment with different color. But the current approach uses a priority queue, which is not ideal for this. So perhaps the code is incomplete in handling the case where the top element is the same color.\n\nSo in the TODO part, the code must find the next element in the priority queue that has a different color. But how can we do that?\n\nWait, the code is written in such a way that the 'work()' function is called twice. The first time with the original segments, and the second time with mirrored segments. So perhaps the code is trying to handle both left and right possibilities. But the main problem is handling the case where the top of the queue is same color.\n\nThe code for the else case handles when the color is different, and then updates ans. But if the top is same color, then the code inside the TODO block must find the next best candidate. However, since the priority queue is a max-heap, the next candidate would be the next element in the queue. But how to access those elements? Because the priority_queue doesn't allow iteration. So perhaps the code is supposed to pop elements until a different color is found, but then those popped elements are no longer in the queue for other segments, which would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using the priority_queue to track the maximum r (sk_b.top().pos), and if that's same color, then the next maximum could be considered, but we can't do that because the priority_queue only allows access to the top.\n\nSo this suggests that the current approach is incomplete. To handle the case where the top element is same color, perhaps the code needs to look for other elements in the queue with the same maximum r but different color, or else look for the next possible candidate. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the code should not just take the top element but consider all elements in the queue and find the one with the largest pos that has a different color. But that's not feasible with a priority_queue since we can't iterate.\n\nHmm. Maybe the approach is flawed, and the code needs a different data structure. But given that this is a code completion problem, I have to work within the existing code structure.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the code is designed to push all possible candidates into the queue, and for the current segment, if the top is same color, we have to check if there are any other elements in the queue. If there are none, then perhaps we can't find a candidate here, but since the problem states that there are at least two colors, there must be some other element.\n\nWait, but in the code's work function, after the while loop, sk_b may have multiple elements. So when the top is same color, we need to find the next best element (the next largest r) that has a different color. So the code in the TODO part should pop the top element (same color), check if the next top has a different color, and so on, until it finds one. But once popped, these elements are no longer in the queue for other segments. That's a problem. Because other segments may need to consider those popped elements. So this approach would be incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but the problem is that we have to fill in the missing part. Let's think about what the code is trying to do here.\n\nLooking at the existing code in the else clause: it's taking the top element (different color) and computes the distance. If the color is same, then the code needs to do something else. The missing code is supposed to handle that scenario.\n\nBut how? The code can't just pop elements from the queue because those elements are needed for processing other segments. So perhaps, the code is supposed to look for another element in the queue with different color, but that's not possible with the current setup because the priority_queue doesn't allow that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is designed to consider the top element and the second top, but that's not feasible with the given data structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the sk_b as a max-heap of the right ends, and when the top is same color, then the next step is to check if there's another element in the sk_b that is different. But the code can't do that unless it pops the same color elements.\n\nSo here's the plan: in the TODO part, the code should pop the top element (same color) and check the next elements until it finds a different color. Then compute the distance if any, and then push back the popped elements (if necessary). But how can we do that? Because once we pop an element, it's removed from the queue. So if we pop some elements and then push them back, but other segments may have already passed the 'pos' loop and not added them again.\n\nWait, but the 'pos' loop adds all segl[pos] with l <= segr[i].r. Once 'pos' is incremented, those elements are added to sk_b. So for subsequent segr[i], the sk_b contains all elements that have l <= segr[i].r. But if we pop elements here, and then in future iterations, those elements might be needed again. So popping them would be a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the approach of popping elements here is not feasible. So this suggests that the current code's approach is incorrect, but the problem is to fill in the missing part. So perhaps the code is designed to have the sk_b store all elements that are possible, and in the case when the top is same color, the code should look for the next possible in the queue. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed to track the best candidate of each color. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: For each segment, find the closest segment (in terms of the minimal distance) of a different color, either to the left or right.\n\nThe current code's work function is handling one direction. For example, when the code is processing segments sorted by their right end, and for each such segment, they are looking for the closest segment that ends after the current segment's left. Wait, perhaps the code is considering segments that start before or at the current segment's right end. So the sk_b contains all segments that start (l) <= current's r. Among those, the one with the maximum r (right end) is the top. The distance between the current segment (l1, r1) and the top (r2) is l1 - r2 if r2 < l1, else 0. But the top's color might be same. So in that case, we need to look for the next best in the queue.\n\nBut again, since the queue is a max-heap, the next elements are in order of decreasing r. So the code needs to check all possible elements in the queue (with same or lower r) to find the first one with different color.\n\nBut how to do that without popping elements. Since the priority queue doesn't allow iteration, this is impossible. Therefore, the code's approach is flawed here, unless there's a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is not handling all possible candidates but is instead using two passes (original and mirrored) to cover left and right. So for each segment, the code looks for the closest segment to the left and to the right. But the current work function handles one direction, and the mirrored code handles the other.\n\nBut even so, the missing code for when the top is same color needs to be filled. So what's the correct approach here?\n\nAlternative idea: When the top of the queue is same color, the code should find the next best candidate in the queue. But since the queue can't be iterated, perhaps the code should find the maximum r in the queue with a different color. To do that, maybe we need to track the maximum r for each color. But that's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using the sk_b to track the maximum r for each color. But that's not the case here.\n\nAnother approach: since the code is called twice (once with original and once mirrored), maybe the work function is designed to find the closest segment to the left and to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when the top is same color, the code can just ignore it and proceed, because there might be other segments in the queue that have different colors but smaller r. But the code is designed to find the maximum r, which would give the closest possible. So perhaps the code is incorrect if the top is same color and the next elements have different colors but smaller r.\n\nSo for example, suppose there are three segments in sk_b:\n\nSegment A: r=10, color=1\n\nSegment B: r=8, color=2\n\nSegment C: r=5, color=3\n\nCurrent segment is color 1. The top is A (color 1, same), then B (color 2, different). So the distance would be max(0, current.l - 8). But the code currently doesn't process this.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to look beyond the top when the top is same color. But how?\n\nAh! The problem is that the code's current logic only checks the top element. So in the TODO part, the code needs to find the next elements in the priority queue (after popping the top) that have a different color, compute the distance, and then push back the popped elements. But since the priority queue is a max-heap, once we pop elements, they are not available for future processing. So this approach would not be correct because other segments may need to process those elements. \n\nBut in this code's structure, the sk_b is being built incrementally. For each i in 1..n (sorted by r), the code is adding segments from segl (sorted by l) up to segr[i].r. So for each i, sk_b contains all segl[pos] where l <= segr[i].r. Then, for each i, the code processes the sk_b. \n\nBut once we pop elements for one i, they are not present for other i's. So this is a problem. Therefore, the code's approach of using a priority queue here may be incorrect for handling same color cases. \n\nSo what's the alternative? How can we handle this scenario efficiently?\n\nAlternative idea: instead of using a priority_queue, we can use a multiset or a structure that allows us to find the maximum r with a different color. But the code uses a priority_queue, so perhaps the code is missing some logic here.\n\nBut given that this is a code completion problem, and the missing code is only a few lines, perhaps the solution is to pop the top element if it's same color, check if there are other elements, and then compute the distance using those elements. But how?\n\nWait, in the TODO part, the code is inside the if (sk_b.top().c == segr[i].c) block. So the code has to handle the case where the top is same color. So in this case, the code can pop the top, check if there are any elements left in the sk_b. If there are, then the new top is the next candidate. But once popped, those elements won't be available for other segments. But perhaps in the code's structure, each segr[i] is processed in a way that once the 'pos' loop has added all segl elements with l <= segr[i].r, the sk_b is built for that particular i. Or maybe not. It's possible that the 'pos' loop is adding all segl elements up to the current segr[i].r, and the sk_b is a priority queue that is built incrementally. For example, segr is sorted by their r in increasing order. So for the first segr[i] (smallest r), the pos loop adds all segl segments with l <= that r. Then, for the next segr[i], which has a larger r, the pos loop adds more segl segments. So the sk_b accumulates more elements as i increases. \n\nBut if during processing of segr[i], we pop elements from sk_b (because they are same color), those elements are not available for processing in subsequent segr[j] where j > i. Which could be a problem because those elements could have a l <= segr[j].r and would have been added again. But in reality, once pos has passed those segments, they are not added again. Wait, the 'pos' variable starts at 1 and increments until segl[pos].l <= segr[i].r. So for each i, 'pos' starts from where it left off in the previous i. So for the first i=1, pos starts at 1 and adds all segl[pos] with l <= segr[1].r. Then for i=2, which has a larger r, pos continues from where it left off, adding more segl elements until l <= segr[i].r. So the sk_b is a cumulative structure. So once a segl segment is added to sk_b for some i, it remains in sk_b for all subsequent i's. Because once added, the sk_b is never cleared. So the sk_b contains all segl segments that have l <= segr[i].r for any i up to the current one. \n\nWait, but when segr[i] is sorted by their r in increasing order (since segr is the sorted version of seg by r), then segr[1].r is the smallest, segr[2].r is larger, etc. So for each i, segr[i].r is larger than or equal to previous ones. So the pos variable in the loop will increment until segl[pos].l <= segr[i].r. Since segr[i].r is increasing, the pos will not decrease. So the sk_b accumulates all segl elements that have l <= any segr[i].r up to the current i. So once a segl element is added to sk_b, it's present in the queue for all subsequent i's. \n\nSo, for example, if segr[i] has r=5, then segr[i+1] has r=6. So the pos loop for i+1 will add any segl elements with l <=6. So the sk_b is a cumulative collection of all segl elements with l <= current segr[i].r. \n\nNow, when processing segr[i], if we pop elements from sk_b, those elements are removed from the queue and are not available for future processing. Which is a problem, because those elements may have l <= segr[j].r for j > i. So they should remain in the queue for those j's. \n\nTherefore, popping elements in the current code's TODO section is incorrect. So how can we check for elements with different colors without modifying the queue? \n\nAn alternative approach is to track two maximum r's for each color. But that's not feasible. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is intended to process the sk_b as a max-heap and, for each segr[i], check if the top is same color. If so, then the code must find the next element in the heap with different color. But since the heap is a max-heap, the next elements are in order of decreasing r. So the code can pop the top (same color) and check the next top. If that's different color, compute the distance and push the popped element back into the queue. \n\nBut pushing back would allow other segments to process it again. But would this work? Let's see. For example:\n\nCurrent sk_b has elements [A (r=10, color 1), B (r=8, color 2), C (r=5, color 3)]. The current segr[i] has color 1. The code pops A (same color), checks the next top B (color 2). The distance is computed. Then, after processing, the code pushes A back into the queue. But since the priority_queue is a max-heap, pushing A back would place it at the top again. So for the next segr[i+1], the code would process A again, which may be correct. \n\nBut this approach could lead to an infinite loop if all elements are of the same color. However, the problem states that there are at least two colors. So in the TODO section, the code can do the following:\n\n- Pop elements from sk_b as long as they have the same color as segr[i].c. \n- For each popped element, keep track of them in a temporary stack.\n- Once a different color element is found, compute the distance and update ans[segr[i].id].\n- Then, push back all the popped elements into sk_b, so they are available for other segments.\n\nThis way, the queue is modified temporarily for this segr[i], but the elements are restored afterward.\n\nSo the steps in the TODO would be:\n\n1. Create a temporary stack to hold popped elements.\n2. While the queue is not empty and the top element's color is same as segr[i].c:\n   a. Pop the top element and push it to the temporary stack.\n3. If the queue is not empty (found a different color), compute the distance.\n4. Push all elements from the temporary stack back into the queue.\n5. If no elements are left, maybe do nothing (but the problem states there are at least two colors, so there must be one).\n\nSo implementing this in code:\n\nInside the if block (when sk_b.top().c == segr[i].c):\n\nvector<Node> tmp;\nwhile (!sk_b.empty() && sk_b.top().c == segr[i].c) {\n    tmp.push_back(sk_b.top());\n    sk_b.pop();\n}\n\nif (!sk_b.empty()) {\n    ans[segr[i].id] = min(ans[segr[i].id], max(0LL, segr[i].l - sk_b.top().pos));\n}\n\n// push back the popped elements\nfor (auto it = tmp.rbegin(); it != tmp.rend(); ++it) {\n    sk_b.push(*it);\n}\n\nBut wait, when you push back the elements, the order may not be correct. For example, the original elements are popped in order A (r=10), B (r=8), etc. When pushing back, the code should push them in reverse order. Wait, no. Because the priority_queue uses a max-heap. When you push elements, they are inserted into the heap structure. So the order in which you push them back may not matter. The heap will reorder them. So perhaps pushing back in any order is acceptable. For example, after popping A and B, pushing them back in any order will result in the heap structure being correct.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- Pop all same color elements from the queue and store them in tmp.\n- Check if the queue is not empty (different color exists).\n- Update the ans if possible.\n- Push all elements from tmp back into the queue.\n\nThis way, the queue's state is restored after processing this segr[i], and other segr[j] can process those elements as needed.\n\nBut this approach may be time-consuming for large n, as for each segr[i] that has the same color as the top, we could pop and push O(k) elements, where k is the number of same color elements. However, given the problem constraints (n up to 2e5 per test case), this could be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is too slow. \n\nBut perhaps the code is designed this way, and given that it's a code completion problem, this is the intended solution.\n\nSo the missing code would be:\n\n        vector<Node> tmp;\n        while (!sk_b.empty() && sk_b.top().c == segr[i].c) {\n            tmp.push_back(sk_b.top());\n            sk_b.pop();\n        }\n        if (!sk_b.empty()) {\n            ans[segr[i].id] = min(ans[segr[i].id], max(0LL, segr[i].l - sk_b.top().pos));\n        }\n        for (auto &x : tmp) {\n            sk_b.push(x);\n        }\n\nBut since the code uses C++ and the priority_queue is a max-heap, this should work. However, when pushing back, the order doesn't matter because the priority_queue will reorder them. So the tmp vector can be pushed back in any order.\n\nWait, no. When you pop elements from the priority_queue, you get them in order of largest to smallest. So when you store them in tmp, the first element is the largest. Then you push them back, but since the priority_queue's order is maintained by the comparator, they will be reinserted into their correct positions. So even if you push them in reverse order, the queue's structure is correct. Therefore, pushing them back in any order is acceptable.\n\nSo the code inside the TODO section should pop all same-colored elements from the queue, check if there's a different color, update the answer, then push back the popped elements.\n\nThis way, the queue is left in the same state as before, except for the case where elements were popped and pushed back. But the elements are pushed back, so the queue's state is restored.\n\nThus, the missing code is as follows."
