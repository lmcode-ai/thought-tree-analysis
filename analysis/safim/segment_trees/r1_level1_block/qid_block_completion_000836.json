But in this approach, each count iteration is supposed to allow the stones to fall one step at a time, and after height iterations, all stones would have settled. But perhaps the code is correct in that approach. Let's test with a simple example. Suppose a grid with two rows:\n\nRow 0: * . Row 1: . . The code would process i=1 (second row, index 1?), wait the code's height is the number of rows, and data is stored as data[0], data[1], etc. So for a 2-row grid, the first count iteration (count=0) would process i from 1 down to 1. Then j=0. data[1][0] is '.', data[0][0] is '*', so swap. Then the * moves to row 1. Then for j=1, same if applicable. So in the first count iteration, the * moves down one row. Then in subsequent count iterations, the same process happens. For each count, the stones can move down one step. After height (2) iterations, all stones would have fallen. But in this case, height is 2. So two count loops. Let's see:\n\nIn the first count=0:\n\nProcess i=1 (second row) for j=0 and 1. So the * from row 0, j=0 moves to row 1. Then in the second count=1:\n\nProcess i=1 again. Now data[1][0] is *, so no swap. So the code works. But perhaps the code is correct in processing each possible cell, and after height iterations, all stones are settled. But then, the code after processing, outputs data[count] in the same loop.",

So after all iterations, the code would have output all the rows. But the data would have been processed height times, and during each iteration, the code processes the stones once. So the code's processing is correct. But the output is printed after each processing step, but the order is such that after all processing steps, the data array would have the final state, and the code outputs each row in order. Wait, no. Because the processing is done inside the count loop. Let's take an example where height is 3. Then count will run 0,1,2. For each count:\n\n1. For count=0:\n\n   a. Process the stones once (each possible swap). b. Output data[0]. 2. For count=1:\n\n   a. Process again (second time). b. Output data[1]. 3. For count=2:\n\n   a. Process third time. b. Output data[2]. So after three processing steps, each row is output. But the data array is modified during each processing step, so after the third processing step, the data is in its final state. However, the rows are output during each count. So the first row (data[0]) is output after the first processing step. The second row (data[1]) is output after the second processing step.",

So when the code outputs data[count] during each count iteration, after processing 'count + 1' times. But after all count iterations (height times), the data array is in the final state. But during each count iteration, the code outputs data[count] which is the row after 'count + 1' processing steps. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nFor count=0:\n\nProcess the stones once. Output data[0]. For count=1:\n\nProcess the stones again (second time). Output data[1]. For count=2:\n\nProcess the stones third time. Output data[2]. So after three processing steps, data[0] was modified in the first processing step, then possibly in later steps. But data[0] is only output after the first processing step. But in the second and third processing steps, data[0] may change again if there are stones above. For example, suppose the initial grid has a stone in row 0, and the rows below are all empty. Then after first processing step (count=0), the stone moves to row 1. So data[0] becomes '.'. In the next processing step (count=1), the stone moves to row 2. data[1] becomes '.'. In the third processing step (count=2), the stone is in row 2, so no movement. So the code's output would be:\n\ndata[0] after step 1: '.'. data[1] after step 2: '.'.\n\ndata[2] after step 3: '*'.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in the given C++ code to solve the problem. Let's read the problem statement again. The task is to simulate stones falling down in a grid. The stones (marked *) should fall down until they hit an obstacle (o), another stone, or the bottom. The obstacles and other stones are immovable. The input is multiple test cases, each with a grid, and we have to output the grid after all stones have settled.\n\nLooking at the code provided. The main part reads the number of test cases, then for each case, reads n (height) and m (length). Then there's a loop to read the data into the 'data' array. But the TODO comment is there, so maybe the input reading part is incomplete. Let me check.\n\nIn the code, after reading height and length, there's a for loop from 0 to height. Inside, the comment says to fill in. Oh right, because each row of the grid is a string that needs to be read from the input. So the missing part here is reading each row. So the code inside that loop should probably read the string for each row and store it in data[i]. So like, cin >> data[i], but wait, in C++, strings can be read directly. So yes, inside the for loop, the line should be cin >> data[i].\n\nWait, but wait, in the code, the data is declared as string data[height], which is a variable-length array. But in C++, standard doesn't support VLAs unless using a compiler extension. But maybe the problem's test cases assume that this is acceptable. Anyway, the code uses that, so the user probably expects that. So the missing code is reading each row into data[i]. So that part is to read the input for each row. So the code inside the loop is cin >> data[i];.\n\nThen, the processing part. The code has a loop for count from 0 to height-1. Then, inside, for i from height-1 down to 1, and j from 0 to length-1. Then, if data[i][j] is '.' and data[i-1][j] is '*', swap them. But this approach might not be correct. Because in each iteration of the count loop, it's processing the grid from the bottom up. But how many times do we need to loop to make sure all stones have fallen? The original code runs this process 'height' times. Because for each count in 0 to height-1, the inner loops process each cell. Since the maximum distance a stone can fall is height-1 (from the top to the bottom), doing this height times should be sufficient. But maybe the way they process it is incorrect.\n\nWait, the current code has for i from height-1 down to 1. So for each j, it checks if the current cell (i) is '.' and the cell above (i-1) is '*'. If so, swap them. So this is moving the * down one cell. But by doing this in a loop that runs from the bottom up, perhaps it's not handling all possible movements. Because if you process from bottom up, when you swap a stone down to i, then the next i (i-1) might have another stone that needs to fall further. But in this approach, each count iteration is supposed to allow the stones to fall one step at a time, and after height iterations, all stones would have settled.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct in that approach. Let's test with a simple example. Suppose a grid with two rows:\n\nRow 0: * . \n\nRow 1: . . \n\nThe code would process i=1 (second row, index 1?), wait the code's height is the number of rows, and data is stored as data[0], data[1], etc. So for a 2-row grid, the first count iteration (count=0) would process i from 1 down to 1. Then j=0. data[1][0] is '.', data[0][0] is '*', so swap. Then the * moves to row 1. Then for j=1, same if applicable. So in the first count iteration, the * moves down one row. Then in subsequent count iterations, the same process happens. For each count, the stones can move down one step. After height (2) iterations, all stones would have fallen. But in this case, height is 2. So two count loops. Let's see:\n\nIn the first count=0:\n\nProcess i=1 (second row) for j=0 and 1. So the * from row 0, j=0 moves to row 1.\n\nThen in the second count=1:\n\nProcess i=1 again. Now data[1][0] is *, so no swap. So the code works.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct in processing each possible cell, and after height iterations, all stones are settled.\n\nBut then, the code after processing, outputs data[count] in the same loop. Wait, during the count loop, after processing, it outputs data[count]. So during each count iteration, after processing the stones once, it outputs the row. That's probably not correct. Because the output is supposed to be the final grid, but the code is outputting data[count] after each count iteration. Let me look again.\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor( int count = 0; count < height; ++count)\n{\n    for(int i = height-1; i > 0; --i)\n        for(int j = 0; j < lenght; ++j)\n            if( (data[i][j] == '.') && (data[i-1][j] == '*') )\n                swap(data[i][j] ,data[i-1][j]);\n    cout << data[count] << endl;\n}\n\nWait, the loop variable is count, which runs from 0 to height-1. For each count, it processes the grid (moving stones down once), and then outputs data[count]. So after processing each count, it's outputting a row. But this would output all the rows after each processing step, which is not correct. Because the correct approach is to process all the stones until they settle, then output the entire grid once.\n\nAh, this is a mistake. So the original code's processing loop is flawed. Because during the count loop, after each iteration, it outputs data[count], which would print each row once for each count. So the output would have height lines for each test case, but the first line is printed after the first processing step, etc. But the problem requires that the entire grid be output after processing. So the code's current approach for output is wrong.\n\nWait, the code's comment in the end has a loop that's commented out, which correctly outputs all rows. But the original code, in the processing loop, outputs data[count] during each count step, leading to height lines per test case. But that's incorrect. So the code is wrong here.\n\nSo the code's main issue is in the output part. But the user's problem is to fill in the missing code, which is indicated by the TODO comment. So the missing code is the input part. Because the TODO is inside the for loop that reads the data. So the code currently has a loop to read each row into data[i], but that part is missing. So the user needs to fill in the code to read each row.\n\nSo the missing code is simply:\n\ncin >> data[i];\n\nThat's the line needed inside the for loop to read each row of the grid.\n\nThen, the processing part is possibly correct. Wait, but the code's output is wrong. Because after processing, it's supposed to output all the rows. But in the current code, during the count loop, after each iteration (count times), it outputs data[count]. For example, if height is 3, then count runs from 0 to 2. So during count=0, the code processes the stones once, then outputs data[0]. Then during count=1, processes again, outputs data[1]. Then count=2, processes again, outputs data[2]. So after three processing steps (each allowing stones to fall one step), the code outputs each row in order. But this is incorrect. Because the correct output is the final grid after all processing. The code's current approach would print the rows as they are being processed, which is wrong.\n\nBut according to the problem's code, the original code has the output loop commented out. The code that's uncommented is the loop where during processing, it outputs each row. So the code is incorrect here. But the user is supposed to fill in the missing code, which is only the part where the TODO is. So the code's other parts are given, but the code for reading the grid is missing.\n\nSo the problem is that the code for reading the grid's rows is missing. The user must fill in that part. So the missing code is to read each row into data[i].\n\nSo the correct code inside that for loop is:\n\ncin >> data[i];\n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in that line. The rest of the code may have issues (like the output part), but according to the problem statement, we are to only fill in the missing code. The code's other parts are already present, even if incorrect. But wait, the problem's code is supposed to be completed so that it runs correctly. So perhaps the original code is missing the code to read the grid, but the processing and output parts are correct? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, the code's processing loop may be correct. Let me think again. For each column, the stones are processed in such a way that for each count (from 0 to height-1), all possible stones that can fall one step are moved. So after height iterations, all stones would have fallen to their maximum possible positions. Because the maximum number of steps a stone needs is height-1 (from the top row to the bottom). So processing height times ensures that even the stones at the top can fall all the way down. Then, during each count, the code processes each cell from bottom up. Wait, the inner loop for i starts at height-1 and goes down to 1. For each cell (i,j), if the cell is '.' and the cell above (i-1,j) is a stone, swap them. So this moves the stone down one cell. By doing this for each i from bottom up, during each count iteration, this would process each cell once, allowing stones to fall down. But perhaps the order is correct. For example, when moving stones, you process from the bottom up. So for a stone in row i-1, you check if the current row i is empty. If so, swap. So during each count iteration, each stone can move down one step. So after height iterations, all stones have settled.\n\nSo the processing part is correct.\n\nBut the output part is wrong. Because after all processing, the code should output each row. But the code currently outputs during each count iteration, which is wrong. However, in the code's current setup, after processing the stones (height times), the code has:\n\nfor( int count = 0; count < height; ++count)\n{\n    // processing steps\n    cout << data[count] << endl;\n}\n\nSo during each iteration of count, the code processes the stones once (allowing them to fall one step) and then outputs the count-th row. So after all processing steps, the data array is the final grid, and the loop outputs all the rows. Wait, no. Because the processing steps are inside the count loop. Wait, the code for the count loop is:\n\nfor( int count = 0; count < height; ++count)\n{\n    for(int i = height-1; i > 0; --i)\n        for(int j = 0; j < lenght; ++j)\n            if( (data[i][j] == '.') && (data[i-1][j] == '*') )\n                swap(data[i][j] ,data[i-1][j]);\n    cout << data[count] << endl;\n}\n\nSo during each count iteration, the code runs the processing steps once (for each i from height-1 down to 1), and then outputs data[count]. For example, when count is 0, after processing once, output data[0]. When count is 1, process again (second time), output data[1], etc. But this would not output the entire grid after all processing steps. Instead, the first row is output after processing once, the second row after processing twice, etc. Which would result in the rows being output at different stages of processing, leading to incorrect output.\n\nAh, this is a big mistake. So the code's output is incorrect because it's outputting each row after processing it once, but the correct approach is to process all stones and then output all rows. So the code's current approach is wrong.\n\nBut according to the problem, the user is supposed to fill in the missing code, which is the input part. So the code's output processing is incorrect, but the problem's code is provided, and we need to fill in the missing code (the input part). The code that's given (the processing and output) is part of the problem's code, but perhaps it's incorrect. So the user's task is to complete the code so that it works correctly, but they can only change the part with the TODO.\n\nWait, but the code's processing and output parts are already written. The user is supposed to fill in the input part. So perhaps the code's processing and output are correct, and the only missing part is reading the input. But in that case, the code's output is being generated during the processing steps, which is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. After the code processes the stones for height times (the loop count runs from 0 to height-1, so height times), during each iteration, it processes the stones once and outputs the count-th row. So after all iterations, the code would have output all the rows. But the data would have been processed height times, and during each iteration, the code processes the stones once. So the code's processing is correct. But the output is printed after each processing step, but the order is such that after all processing steps, the data array would have the final state, and the code outputs each row in order.\n\nWait, no. Because the processing is done inside the count loop. Let's take an example where height is 3. Then count will run 0,1,2. For each count:\n\n1. For count=0:\n\n   a. Process the stones once (each possible swap).\n\n   b. Output data[0].\n\n2. For count=1:\n\n   a. Process again (second time).\n\n   b. Output data[1].\n\n3. For count=2:\n\n   a. Process third time.\n\n   b. Output data[2].\n\nSo after three processing steps, each row is output. But the data array is modified during each processing step, so after the third processing step, the data is in its final state. However, the rows are output during each count. So the first row (data[0]) is output after the first processing step. The second row (data[1]) is output after the second processing step. The third row (data[2]) after the third step. But during the third processing step, the first and second rows may have been modified again, but they were output earlier. So this approach is incorrect. The output will not reflect the final state of the grid. For example:\n\nSuppose the initial grid is:\n\nrow 0: * . \n\nrow 1: . * \n\nrow 2: . . \n\nAfter the first processing step (count=0), stones fall once. So row 0 becomes . *, row 1 becomes * ., row 2 is unchanged (assuming some swaps). Then data[0] is output. Then count=1, process again. Stones fall once more. Row 0 is . ., row 1 is . *, row 2 becomes * .. Then output data[1]. Then count=2, process again. Stones fall once. Row 2 becomes * *, row 0 and 1 are empty. Output data[2]. So the output would be:\n\n. *\n\n* .\n\n* *\n\nBut the correct final grid after three processing steps would have all stones at the bottom. But the output in this code would print the rows after different processing steps. The first line is after one step, the second after two steps, third after three steps. So the output is the rows in their state after varying numbers of processing steps, leading to incorrect results.\n\nThus, the code's output is incorrect. The correct approach is to process the entire grid until all stones have fallen, then output all rows in order.\n\nBut the problem's code is given with the processing and output loops as above, and the user's task is to fill in the input part. However, the code as given will not work correctly. So perhaps the code is wrong, and the user needs to find the missing code (the input part) plus fix the output part. But according to the problem statement, the user must only fill in the missing lines or blocks. The output part is commented out, but the code's current output is in the loop.\n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\nThe code that is commented out is:\n\n// for (int i = 0; i < height; ++i)\n// {\n//     cout << data[i] << endl;\n// }\n\nAnd the code that's uncommented is inside the count loop. So perhaps the original code's mistake is that it's printing during processing instead of after. But the user is supposed to fix this. However, the problem's instructions say that the code has missing lines or blocks, and we need to output only the missing parts. So the code's processing and output parts are part of the existing code, but they may be incorrect. However, according to the problem statement, the code to be completed is such that when the missing parts are filled in, the program runs correctly.\n\nSo the given code's processing and output logic is flawed. Therefore, the code will not work even if the input part is filled in. But according to the problem statement, the code's missing parts must be filled in such that the program runs correctly. So perhaps the code's processing is correct, and the output is correct, but it's not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's processing loop is correct. Let's think again. For each count from 0 to height-1, the code processes each column, moving stones down. By processing height times, all stones fall to their positions. Then, after all processing, the code outputs the data array. But wait, the code's current code outputs during the processing steps. So perhaps the code is incorrect, but the user is supposed to fill in the input part, and the other parts are correct. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's processing is correct. Let's think of a test case.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n3 3\n\n* * .\n\n.*.\n\n..*\n\nAfter processing, the stones should fall to the bottom.\n\nBut the code's approach of processing each count (3 times) and moving stones each time may work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's output is correct because during the processing steps, all the stones are moved down, and after all processing steps, the code outputs each row in order. Wait, no. The code's loop for count outputs data[count] during each count iteration. So for count=0, data[0] is output after processing once. For count=1, data[1] is output after processing twice. For count=2, data[2] is output after processing three times. But after three processing steps, the data array would be in the final state, but the first row was output after one processing step. So the code's output would be the first row after one processing step, which may not be the final state.\n\nSo the code's output is incorrect. Therefore, the code's output logic is flawed, and the code as given will not work even if the input part is filled in.\n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, the code is to be completed by filling in the missing parts. So the code's existing parts may have errors, but the user is supposed to complete the missing parts (the input part) and leave the rest as-is, and the code will work.\n\nBut how can that be? The code's output is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's processing is correct, but the output is also correct. Let's think of a test case:\n\nTest case 1:\n\n1\n\n2 2\n\n*.\n\n..\n\nThe initial grid is row 0: * ., row 1: . .\n\nProcessing steps:\n\ncount=0:\n\nprocess i=1 (since height is 2, i starts at 1 (height-1) and goes down to 1).\n\nFor j=0: data[1][0] is '.', data[0][0] is '*', swap. So row 0 becomes '. .', row 1 becomes '* .'.\n\nThen output data[0] which is '. .'.\n\ncount=1:\n\nprocess again.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=0: data[1][0] is '*', data[0][0] is '.' \u2192 no swap.\n\nSo after processing, the grid is:\n\nrow 0: . . \n\nrow 1: * . \n\nThen output data[1] \u2192 '* .'.\n\nSo the code's output would be:\n\n. .\n\n* . \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the final grid after two processing steps would be the stones in row 1, so the correct output is:\n\n. . \n\n* . \n\nSo the code's output is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nTest case 2:\n\n1\n\n3 1\n\n*\n\n.\n\n.\n\nProcessing steps (height=3, loop runs 3 times).\n\ncount=0:\n\nprocess i=2 (height-1=2) down to 1.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nj=0: data[2][0] is '.', data[1][0] is '.' \u2192 no swap.\n\ni=1: data[1][0] is '.' and data[0][0] is '*' \u2192 swap. Now data[0][0] is '.' and data[1][0] is '*' \u2192 so the stone moves down one row.\n\nThen output data[0] \u2192 '.'.\n\ncount=1:\n\nprocess i=2 down to 1.\n\ni=2: data[2][0] is '.', data[1][0] is '*' \u2192 swap. Now data[1][0] is '.', data[2][0] is '*'.\n\ni=1: data[1][0] is '.', data[0][0] is '.' \u2192 no swap.\n\nOutput data[1] \u2192 '.'.\n\ncount=2:\n\nprocess i=2 down to 1.\n\ni=2: data[2][0] is '*' \u2192 no swap.\n\ni=1: data[1][0] is '.' and data[0][0] is '.' \u2192 no swap.\n\nOutput data[2] \u2192 '*'.\n\nSo the code outputs:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n*\n\nWhich is the correct final grid.\n\nHmm, so even though the code outputs each row during different processing steps, the final output after all count iterations is the processed data. Because after count=0, data[0] is output ('.'), but after count=1, data[1] is output ('.'), and after count=2, data[2] is output ('*'). So the code's output is three lines: '.', '.', '*' \u2192 which is the correct grid. Because the data array is being modified during each count iteration, but when count=0, data[0] is output after one processing step. Then, in subsequent iterations, the data array is further modified, but the code is outputting data[count] during each step.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is for count from 0 to height-1, and during each iteration, the code processes the stones once, and then outputs data[count]. So for a grid of height 3, the code will output data[0], data[1], data[2] in order, but each after a different number of processing steps. For example:\n\nAfter count=0: data[0] is output after one processing step.\n\nAfter count=1: data[1] is output after two processing steps.\n\nAfter count=2: data[2] is output after three processing steps.\n\nBut the data array is modified during each processing step. So data[0] after count=0 is the state after one processing step. Then, during count=1, two processing steps have been done, so data[1] is the state after two steps. data[2] is the state after three steps.\n\nBut the final state of the grid after three steps is what we need. So for each row, the data is output after 'count + 1' processing steps. So in the case where the code's processing steps correctly simulate all stones falling, the code's output would be the correct final state for each row. Because after 'height' processing steps (count runs from 0 to height-1, which is height times), each row has been processed enough times.\n\nBut wait, during each count iteration, the code processes the stones once. So after height iterations, the stones have been processed height times. But for a grid of height n, a stone needs at most n-1 steps to fall to the bottom. So after height iterations, all stones have fallen.\n\nSo when the code outputs data[count] during each count iteration, after processing 'count + 1' times. But after all count iterations (height times), the data array is in the final state. But during each count iteration, the code outputs data[count] which is the row after 'count + 1' processing steps. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nFor count=0:\n\nProcess the stones once.\n\nOutput data[0].\n\nFor count=1:\n\nProcess the stones again (second time).\n\nOutput data[1].\n\nFor count=2:\n\nProcess the stones third time.\n\nOutput data[2].\n\nSo after three processing steps, data[0] was modified in the first processing step, then possibly in later steps. But data[0] is only output after the first processing step. But in the second and third processing steps, data[0] may change again if there are stones above.\n\nFor example, suppose the initial grid has a stone in row 0, and the rows below are all empty. Then after first processing step (count=0), the stone moves to row 1. So data[0] becomes '.'.\n\nIn the next processing step (count=1), the stone moves to row 2. data[1] becomes '.'.\n\nIn the third processing step (count=2), the stone is in row 2, so no movement.\n\nSo the code's output would be:\n\ndata[0] after step 1: '.'.\n\ndata[1] after step 2: '.'.\n\ndata[2] after step 3: '*'.\n\nWhich is the correct final grid.\n\nBut data[0] and data[1] are output after step 1 and 2, but by step 3, they are already correct. However, during step 1 and 2, they were modified, but their output is captured at that time. So how does this work?\n\nBecause during each count iteration, the code processes all possible stones moving once. Then, the code outputs data[count], which is the row at index 'count' after 'count + 1' processing steps. But after all count iterations, the code has processed the stones 'height' times, which is sufficient for all stones to settle. But the rows are output in order, with each row being output after 'count + 1' steps. So, for example, the first row (count=0) is output after 1 step. But during subsequent steps, the first row may change again. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut in the example above, the code works correctly. How is that possible?\n\nBecause once a stone leaves a row, it's no longer there. So once a stone in row 0 is moved to row 1 in the first step, in subsequent steps, row 0 has no stones. So the code's output of row 0 after the first step is correct, and subsequent steps do not modify row 0 again. So in this case, the code's output is correct.\n\nBut what if there are obstacles in the way?\n\nFor example:\n\nTest case 3:\n\n1\n\n3 1\n\n*\n\no\n\n.\n\nInitial grid:\n\nrow 0: *\n\nrow 1: o\n\nrow 2: .\n\nProcessing steps:\n\ncount=0:\n\nprocess stones once. i=2 (height-1=2) down to 1.\n\nj=0.\n\ni=2: data[2][0] is '.', data[1][0] is 'o' \u2192 no swap.\n\ni=1: data[1][0] is 'o', data[0][0] is '*' \u2192 no swap.\n\nSo no swaps. Output data[0] \u2192 '*'.\n\ncount=1:\n\nprocess again.\n\ni=2: data[2][0] is '.', data[1][0] is 'o' \u2192 no swap.\n\ni=1: data[1][0] is 'o', data[0][0] is '*' \u2192 no swap.\n\nOutput data[1] \u2192 'o'.\n\ncount=2:\n\nprocess again. No swaps. Output data[2] \u2192 '.'.\n\nSo the code's output is:\n\n*\n\no\n\n.\n\nWhich is incorrect. The correct final state should be:\n\n. \n\no \n\n* \n\nBecause the stone in row 0 should fall down until it hits the obstacle in row 1. So it should stay in row 0. Or wait, no. Obstacles are in row 1, so the stone in row 0 is above the obstacle. So when the stones fall, the stone in row 0 would fall down until it hits the obstacle. But since the obstacle is in row 1, the stone would stop at row 0's cell. No. Wait, no. The stone is in row 0. Below it is row 1 (obstacle). So the stone cannot fall further. So the final grid should have row 0 as *, row 1 as o, row 2 as '.'.\n\nSo the code's output is correct in this case.\n\nAnother example:\n\nTest case 4:\n\n1\n\n5 1\n\n*\n\n.\n\n*\n\no\n\n.\n\nThe initial grid is:\n\nrow 0: *\n\nrow 1: .\n\nrow 2: *\n\nrow 3: o\n\nrow 4: .\n\nAfter processing, the stones should fall to the lowest possible positions.\n\nSo the first stone in row 0 will fall until it hits the stone in row 2. The stone in row 2 will fall until it hits the obstacle in row 3.\n\nSo after processing, row 4 becomes * (from row 2's stone), row 3 is o, row 2 is *, row 1 is ., row 0 is ..\n\nWait, no. Let's think:\n\nThe stone in row 2 will fall down past row 3 (obstacle) only if there's space. But row 3 is an obstacle. So the stone in row 2 cannot fall further. So row 2's stone is blocked by the obstacle. The stone in row 0 falls down through row 1, but is blocked by the stone in row 2. So row 1 becomes *, row 0 becomes ., row 2 is *, row 3 o, row 4 . \u2192 but this is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. All stones fall down. For each column, stones fall as far as possible. So let's process each column.\n\nOriginal column:\n\nRow 0: *\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 2: *\n\nRow 3: o\n\nRow 4: .\n\nAfter processing:\n\nThe two stones (row 0 and row 2) fall down.\n\nThe stone from row 0 will fall to row 1 (since there's a stone at row 2). The stone from row 2 will fall down to row 4, because there's an obstacle in row 3, but wait, the obstacle is in row 3. So below the stone in row 2 is row 3 (obstacle) and row 4 (empty). So the stone in row 2 can't fall past the obstacle. So the final positions are:\n\nRow 4: .\n\nRow 3: o\n\nRow 2: *\n\nRow 1: *\n\nRow 0: .\n\nSo the code's processing would need to move the stones in the correct way.\n\nBut according to the code's processing:\n\nThe code processes height times (5 times).\n\nAfter each processing step:\n\nStep 1: stones move down as much as possible once.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach of processing from the bottom up is correct.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach of checking from the bottom up for each cell and swapping may allow stones to fall correctly.\n\nBut given the code's current approach, it's possible that the code will correctly simulate the process.\n\nBut the output of the code in this case would be:\n\nDuring count=0:\n\nAfter processing once, output row 0.\n\nBut the code's output is:\n\nThe code outputs each row in order, after varying processing steps. So for this example, the code's output would be the rows after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 processing steps. But each row is output after 'count+1' processing steps. So the first row (row 0) is output after 1 processing step, which may not be its final state. However, the code's output is generated after all processing steps, so the final data array is correct.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The loop for count runs from 0 to height-1 (5 times). For each count:\n\n1. Process the stones once (i from bottom up).\n\n2. Output data[count].\n\nSo after count=0, the code has processed the stones once and outputs data[0].\n\nThen, after count=1, processed twice and outputs data[1].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut after all 5 iterations, the code would have processed the stones 5 times. The data array after 5 steps would be in the final state. But during each count iteration, the code outputs data[count], which is the row after 'count + 1' steps.\n\nFor example, data[0] is output after 1 processing step. data[1] after 2 steps, etc. But after all 5 steps, the data array is in the final state, but the code outputs data[count] during each iteration, which may not reflect the final state.\n\nBut in reality, during each count iteration, the code processes the stones once. So during count=0, data is modified once. Then during count=1, data is modified again. So after count=4 (5 steps), the data is modified 5 times, which is the final state.\n\nBut the code outputs data[count] during each iteration. So for count=0, data[0] is output after 1 step. For count=1, data[1] is output after 2 steps, etc. But after all processing, the data array is in the final state. However, the code outputs the rows during each step. But in the final data array, all rows are in the final state. So why is the code outputting the rows during processing steps?\n\nNo, the code's loop for count is running for each row. For each count from 0 to 4 (assuming height=5), the code processes the stones once, then outputs data[count]. So after 5 iterations, the code has processed the stones 5 times, and outputs all rows. But each row is output after a different number of processing steps. For example, data[0] is output after 1 processing step, data[1] after 2 steps, etc. But the data array is being modified during each processing step, so the rows may change multiple times.\n\nBut in reality, after 5 processing steps, the data array is in the final state. The code outputs data[count] for each count from 0 to 4, but since after 5 processing steps, the data array is in the final state, then all the rows are output in their final state. Is this possible?\n\nWait, no. Because during each count iteration, after processing the stones once, the code outputs data[count]. For example, during count=0, after processing once, data[0] is output. During count=1, after processing twice, data[1] is output. But during the processing steps, data[0] might have been modified again. For example, during count=1's processing step, some stones in higher rows might have moved, affecting data[0]. But no, because the stones move down, and data[0] is the top row. Once the stones in data[0] have fallen down, they won't be there anymore. So data[0] is only modified during the first processing step, and in later steps, data[0] remains as '.'.\n\nSo, for example, after count=0, data[0] is output. Then, during subsequent processing steps, data[0] is not modified again. So the code's output for data[0] after count=0 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, data[1] is output after count=1 (two processing steps). By that time, data[1] may have been modified during the first and second processing steps, but after two steps, it's in its final state.\n\nSo the code's output is correct. Because after all processing steps (height times), the data array is in the final state. However, the code outputs each row during the corresponding count iteration. But in reality, the code's output is the data array after all processing steps. Because during the count loop, after processing each time, the code outputs data[count], which for count=0 to height-1, would output all rows. But the data array is modified in each iteration. So after the last iteration (count=height-1), all rows have been processed height times. So the data array is in the final state, and the code outputs each row once, in order.\n\nWait, no. Because during count=0, after processing once, data[0] is output. Then, during count=1, after processing again (twice total), data[1] is output. During count=2, after three times, data[2] is output. So for a grid of height 5, after 5 processing steps, all rows are output. But data[0] was output after 1 processing step. However, the data array after 5 processing steps has data[0] as modified during all steps. But during the first processing step, data[0] may have had changes, but subsequent steps may not change it again. For example, if data[0] has a stone that falls down to data[1] during the first step, then in subsequent steps, data[0] is '.' and no longer changes. So when the code outputs data[0] during count=0 (after 1 step), it's correct. But data[1] is output during count=1 (after 2 steps), which is also correct. So the code's output is correct.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct. By processing the stones height times, each stone falls as much as possible, and the output of each row during the corresponding count iteration is correct.\n\nSo the code's output logic is correct. Therefore, the only missing part is reading the input.\n\nSo the missing code is to read each row into data[i] via cin >> data[i].\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the line:\n\ncin >> data[i];\n\nThat's the missing code."
