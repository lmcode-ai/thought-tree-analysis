Because delta for x=prev_e would be (curr_s - prev_e) (since x + delta >= curr_s, but x=prev_e is the maximum x, so delta could be as low as curr_s - prev_e). Similarly, for x=prev_s, delta could be as high as curr_e - prev_s. So the movement during step j could cover a range from (prev_s + (curr_s - x)) for x varying to (prev_e + (curr_e - x)) for x varying. Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, the minimal possible start of the movement's covered interval is prev_s + (curr_s - prev_e) = curr_s - (prev_e - prev_s). But that's not necessarily correct. Let's think.",

But delta_min for x=prev_e is curr_s - prev_e, so the start of the covered interval would be prev_e + (curr_s - prev_e) = curr_s. The delta_max for x=prev_s is curr_e - prev_s, so the end of the interval would be prev_s + (curr_e - prev_s) = curr_e. So the covered interval during step j is [curr_s, curr_e], but this is only if delta can be chosen such that for all x in [prev_s, prev_e], there exists a delta such that x + delta is in [curr_s, curr_e].

But how to initialize this. Initially, for j = i, the coverage is from step i to step i. Wait, step i+1 is the first step after i.\n\nWait, in the code's loops, i ranges from 0 to n-1. For each i, the code starts with u = fw.get(i), which is the interval after i steps. Then, for j from i to n-1, the code processes step j (the j-th element of a), which is step j+1 in fw. So, when j = i, the step is j = i (element a[i], which is step i+1 in fw). The movement during this step is from the interval u (fw.get(i)) to fw.get(i+1). So, the covered interval during this step is [min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start), max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end)]. The number of points is (max - min +1). Then, for j = i+1, the movement during step j (a[j], which is step j+1 in fw) is from fw.get(j) to fw.get(j+1). But the code's loops are nested, so for each j starting from i, the code needs to accumulate the coverage from step i to j.\n\nBut perhaps the code is tracking the running min and max for the current segment. So, for each j, the code computes the cumulative min and max from step i to j.\n\nFor example, when j = i:\n\ncurrentMin = Math.min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start);\ncurrentMax = Math.max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end);\npoints = currentMax - currentMin + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, points); Then, for j = i+1:\n\ncurrentMin = Math.min(currentMin, fw.get(j+1).start);\ncurrentMax = Math.max(currentMax, fw.get(j+1).end);\npoints = currentMax - currentMin + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, points);\n\nBut this is incorrect because it doesn't account for the movement between steps.

So for each step j, the covered points are the interval from prev_start to curr_end, assuming that the previous positions are all prev_start and the current positions are all curr_end. But this isn't necessarily the case. This is getting very complicated. Perhaps the code's intended approach is to track for each possible segment [i, j] the cumulative global min and max of the positions after each step and during the steps. Then, the coverage is the difference between the max and min plus 1. But how to compute this. Looking back at the code:\n\nInside the loop for i, the code initializes distR and distL as u.start and u.end. Then, for each j, the code loops from i to n-1. Perhaps these variables distR and distL are tracking the current cumulative min and max. For example, for j=i:\n\nAfter processing step j, the movement is from u.start and u.end to fw.get(j+1).start and end. So, the covered interval during this step is min(u.start, fw.get(j+1).start) to max(u.end, fw.get(j+1).end). The cumulative min and max are these values. Then, for j=i+1:\n\nThe movement is from fw.get(j) to fw.get(j+1).",

So:\n\nInterval current_prev = fw.get(j);\nInterval current_curr = fw.get(j+1);\nlong step_min = Math.min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start);\nlong step_max = Math.max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end);\n// Now, compute the cumulative min and max for this segment\nif (j == i) {\n    // first step in the segment\n    distR = step_min;\n    distL = step_max;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, step_min);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, step_max);\n}\nlong coverage = distL - distR + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, coverage); Wait, the variables distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end (the interval after i steps). But u.start and u.end are the positions after i steps. But for the first step in the segment (j=i), the movement is from i to i+1. So, the code would need to track the cumulative min and max for the steps j =i to j.\n\nSo, for j=i:\n\nprevious interval is fw.get(i) (u), current interval is fw.get(i+1). step_min = min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start)\n\nstep_max = max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end)\n\ndistR and distL are initialized to step_min and step_max. Then, for j=i+1:\n\nprevious interval is fw.get(i+1), current interval is fw.get(i+2). step_min = min(fw.get(i+1).start, fw.get(i+2).start)\n\nstep_max = max(fw.get(i+1).end, fw.get(i+2).end)\n\ndistR is updated to min(distR, step_min)\n\ndistL is updated to max(distL, step_max)\n\nThis way, distR tracks the cumulative min over all steps' step_min, and distL tracks the cumulative max over all steps' step_max. Thus, the coverage for the segment [i, j] is (distL - distR +1), which is the maximum possible coverage. So, the missing code inside the j loop should be: Interval current_prev = fw.get(j);\nInterval current_curr = fw.get(j+1);\nlong step_min = Math.min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start);\nlong step_max = Math.max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    // First step in this segment\n    distR = step_min;\n    distL = step_max;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, step_min);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, step_max);\n}\nlong coverage = distL - distR + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, coverage);\n\nThis code would update the distR and distL for each j, tracking the cumulative min and max of the steps' step_min and step_max, and then compute the coverage. This seems to fit into the existing code structure, where distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end for each i.\n\nBut wait, initializing distR and distL to u.start and u.end is not correct for the first step (j=i), because the first step's movement is from u to fw.get(i+1). So, the correct initial values for distR and distL when j=i are the min between u.start and fw.get(i+1).start, and the max between u.end and fw.get(i+1).end. But in the existing code, distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end. Then, inside the j loop, when j=i, the code would process the first step (i), and compute step_min and step_max as the min and max between u.start and fw.get(i+1).start/end. So, in the code: For j = i:\n\ncurrent_prev = fw.get(j) = fw.get(i) = u.\n\ncurrent_curr = fw.get(j+1) = fw.get(i+1). step_min = Math.min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start). step_max = Math.max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end). Since j ==i, distR and distL are set to step_min and step_max. Then, for j >i, these variables are updated with the min and max of the current step's step_min and step_max. This correctly tracks the cumulative min and max of all step's step_min and step_max. Thus, the missing code should be:\n\ncurrent_prev = fw.get(j);\ncurrent_curr = fw.get(j+1);\nstep_min = Math.min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start);\nstep_max = Math.max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = step_min;\n    distL = step_max;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, step_min);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, step_max);\n}\nans = Math.max(ans, distL - distR + 1); Thus, in the code's inner loop, for each j from i to n-1, the code processes step j, computes the step's covered interval, updates the cumulative distR and distL, and updates the answer. So the missing code is:\n\nInterval curr = fw.get(j + 1);\nlong currentStepMin = Math.min(curr.start, curr.end);\nlong currentStepMax = Math.max(curr.start, curr.end); Wait, no.",

So the movement is from current_prev to current_curr. The step's covered interval is [min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start), max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end)]. So, the step_min is the minimum between current_prev.start and current_curr.start. step_max is the maximum between current_prev.end and current_curr.end. Thus, the code inside the j loop is:\n\nInterval prevInterval = fw.get(j);\nInterval currInterval = fw.get(j + 1);\nlong stepMin = Math.min(prevInterval.start, currInterval.start);\nlong stepMax = Math.max(prevInterval.end, currInterval.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = stepMin;\n    distL = stepMax;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, stepMin);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, stepMax);\n}\nlong coverage = distL - distR + 1;\nif (coverage > ans) {\n    ans = coverage;\n} So, the code would update distR and distL for each j and compute the coverage.

But when j=i, the code processes step j (the i-th index in a), which is the (i+1)-th step in fw. But the code for j=i is:\n\nprev = fw.get(j) -> which is fw.get(i), which is the interval after i steps. curr = fw.get(j+1) -> which is fw.get(i+1), the interval after i+1 steps. So, stepMin is Math.min(fw.get(i).start, fw.get(i+1).start)\n\nstepMax is Math.max(fw.get(i).end, fw.get(i+1).end) Then, distR and distL are set to these values.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to fill in the missing code here. The problem is about calculating the maximum number of distinct integer points a dog can visit, given some movement steps where some are unknown (zeros) that can be replaced with values between -k and k. The key is that after all steps, the dog must return to 0. If it's impossible, output -1, else find the maximum points.\n\nLooking at the code structure, there's a loop over i from 0 to n-1, and then a nested loop over j from i to n-1. The part that's missing is inside this nested loop. Let's think about what's being calculated here.\n\nThe code first builds a list of intervals (start and end) forward, which probably represents the possible ranges of positions after each step. Then, there's a backward pass where they adjust the intervals to ensure that the final position is 0. Then, they're trying to calculate the answer by considering each possible interval [i, j]?\n\nWait, the outer loop is for i from 0 to n-1, and inner j from i to n-1. So for each i, j pair, they are processing some interval. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\". What's supposed to be there?\n\nThe answer variable is initially 1 (since 0 is always counted), and the goal is to accumulate the maximum possible points. So for each step, maybe the code is calculating how many new points are added when considering the path from step i to step j.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is tracking the range of positions after each step and using that to compute the total distinct points.\n\nHmm. The problem requires that we count all the integer points the dog passes through during each minute. For example, if the dog moves from 0 to 3 in a minute, she visits 0,1,2,3. So for each step, the number of new points is the absolute difference between the start and end positions plus 1 (since inclusive). But wait, that's only if the movement is in a single direction. If the movement is back and forth, like from 2 to -3, then the path would cover all points between 2 and -3. So the total points covered in a step (i-th) is the number of integers in the interval from the previous position to the new position.\n\nBut considering that the steps are processed as a series of movements, each step's movement adds some points. The challenge is that the exact path depends on the choices made for the 0s, which can be adjusted to maximize the total points, while ensuring the final position is 0.\n\nThe code's approach seems to precompute possible ranges of positions after each step, both forward and then backward (to ensure that the final is 0). Then, for each possible interval [i, j], maybe they compute the union of the ranges and the points covered.\n\nWait, in the code after adjusting the intervals (the backward loop), there's a loop where for each i, they process the current interval u, and then loop j from i to n-1. So for each i and j, perhaps they're considering the movement from i to j steps and determining the maximum possible points added during those steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each i represents a starting step, and j the ending step, and we need to compute the contribution of the path from i to j. But how?\n\nThe code's current structure for the loops:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    Interval u = fw.get(i);\n    long distR = u.start;\n    long distL = u.end;\n    for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {\n        // TODO\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, after getting u = fw.get(i), which is the interval after i steps. Then, for each j from i to n-1, perhaps they are processing the steps from i to j. So for each j, they take the movement from step i to step j (inclusive), and calculate the possible positions after each of those steps.\n\nBut how does this contribute to the answer? The answer is supposed to be the maximum number of distinct points. Each step's movement contributes points based on the path taken. So the total is the union of all points visited in all steps.\n\nBut calculating this union is tricky. The approach must be to model for each step, the possible range of positions (start and end) that the dog is at after each minute, and then compute the union of all intervals from step 0 to step n.\n\nWait, but the code's approach seems to model the possible position ranges after each step. Then, during the backward pass, they adjust the intervals to ensure that the final position is 0. Then, for each step i, the interval represents the possible positions the dog could be in after i steps, given the constraints that the final position after n steps is 0.\n\nOnce these intervals are computed (both forward and backward adjusted), the code then calculates the maximum possible points by considering the union of all the intervals (the positions after each step) and their coverage.\n\nBut how to compute the union of all possible intervals along the way. Because each step's position is a range, and the path between steps could cover all points between the previous position and the new position.\n\nSo for example, if after step i-1, the position is in [s_prev, e_prev], and during step i, the dog moves from x (in [s_prev, e_prev]) to x + a_i (where a_i is possibly replaced if zero). So the path during step i is the line from x to x + a_i. The points visited during this step are all the integers along that path.\n\nThe problem is to choose the a_i's (for the zeros) such that the final position is 0, and the total number of unique integer points covered in all steps is maximized.\n\nSo the code needs to model the ranges of possible positions after each step, and also track the union of all the intervals covered during each step's movement.\n\nBut since the possible choices for a_i's (the zeros) are variables, how to model this to find the maximum possible coverage.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the code is using dynamic programming or interval merging to track the possible ranges and the maximum coverage.\n\nLooking back at the existing code:\n\nAfter adjusting the intervals in the backward pass (so that each interval [i] represents the possible positions after step i that can still reach 0 at step n), the code then tries to calculate the maximum points.\n\nIn the loops for i and j, the code is perhaps considering each possible segment of steps from i to j and calculating the points covered during those steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the variables distR and distL are set to u.start and u.end. Then for each j in i to n-1, perhaps they are processing the j-th step and updating the current range of possible positions.\n\nLet me think. For each i (starting step), and j (current step up to n-1), the code might be building the path from i to j, step by step, tracking the current possible position ranges and the points covered.\n\nBut how to model that. For each j, we can track the possible movement from the previous step (i) to the current step (j). The path during step j is from the previous position to the new position. The points covered in step j's movement are the integers along that path.\n\nSo, for each step, the code needs to compute the maximum possible coverage of points given the possible ranges of positions before and after the step.\n\nBut given the code's current structure, maybe the inner loop (j) is building up the movement from i to j steps, and for each j, compute the sum of all the points covered in those steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is calculating the sum of the lengths of the intervals covered in each movement between steps, but considering overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.\n\nBut this is a challenging part. The code needs to compute the union of all intervals from each movement. But since the movement can vary depending on the choices of a_i's, how to find the maximum possible union.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the possible ranges of positions at each step and the possible ranges of movement between steps, then compute the maximum possible union.\n\nBut perhaps a smarter approach is needed. Let's look at the code's existing variables.\n\nThe intervals in fw have been adjusted in the backward pass. For each i, fw.get(i) gives the possible position ranges after step i, given that the final position is 0. So the possible positions at step i are between start and end.\n\nNow, when processing step j (from i to n-1), the code might be tracking the possible movement from the position at i to the position at j+1. For example, during step j+1, the movement is from position s (after j steps) to s + a_j (or some value in -k to k if a_j is zero). The points covered during this movement are the integers between s and s + a_j.\n\nBut how to track all these ranges and find the maximum possible union.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible i and j, the code is calculating the maximum possible coverage of points from step i to step j, and then accumulating that into the answer.\n\nBut the answer is the maximum over all possible intervals. No, that's not likely. Because the answer needs to be the sum of all points covered in all steps. So the code needs to consider all steps and their movement paths, and calculate the total unique points.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a greedy approach. For each step where a_i is zero, choose the direction that maximizes the coverage. For example, when a_i is zero, we can choose to move to the left or right as much as possible to cover new points.\n\nBut this may not be possible if the final position must be zero.\n\nWait, the code's approach after the backward pass has intervals for each step that are compatible with the final position being zero. So the possible positions at each step are constrained to allow a path leading to zero at the end.\n\nSo for each step, the possible positions are [start, end]. Then, during each step, the movement from the previous position to the current position can be determined by the possible a_i's.\n\nBut how to model the path coverage.\n\nThe key insight here is that the maximum number of points is achieved by maximizing the coverage of each step's movement. For steps where a_i is zero, we can choose the movement (within -k to k) to cover the maximum possible new points, but ensuring that the final position is zero.\n\nSo, for each step i, after processing the backward intervals, the possible positions are in [u.start, u.end]. Then, the movement during step i+1 is determined by the a_i's (or the chosen value if a_i is zero). The movement is from the previous position (u) to the next position (v), and the path is the line from u to u + delta (delta is the chosen value for that step).\n\nThe points covered in this movement are the integers between u and u + delta, inclusive. The total points are the union of all these intervals over all steps.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible union.\n\nAn efficient way to calculate the maximum possible coverage is to track the union of all intervals covered by the movement between steps. Since the steps are processed in order, perhaps we can model the intervals as ranges and merge overlapping ones.\n\nBut since the ranges can be very large (k up to 1e9), we can't track each point. So instead, we need to find a way to calculate the total length of the union of all intervals, given the possible movement ranges for each step.\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps the code is using dynamic programming. For each step, track the possible ranges of movement and the maximum coverage so far.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the fact that the maximum coverage is achieved by choosing the largest possible spread in each step. For example, in each zero step (a_i = 0), choose to move as far left or right as possible, but subject to the constraints that the final position is zero.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nLooking at the existing code structure, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each possible interval [i, j] the maximum possible coverage during those steps. For example, when i is the starting step and j is the ending step, the code is trying to find the maximum coverage that can be achieved in those steps, given the constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe variables distR and distL are initially set to u.start and u.end (the possible positions after step i). Then, for each j in i to n-1, perhaps the code is updating distR and distL based on the movement in step j. Then, for each step j, the movement would be from the previous position (distR or distL?) to the new position.\n\nWait, but in the loop for j from i to n-1, perhaps each j represents the current step being processed. For example, starting from step i, the code processes steps i, i+1, ..., j, and tracks the possible movement ranges. For each such j, the code calculates the coverage from i to j steps.\n\nBut the code is missing the part where they compute the coverage. Let me think about the variables:\n\nInitially, for i=0, the position after step 0 is 0 (since the initial position is 0). Then, step 0 is the first step (a[0]). But in the code, fw is built as a list of n+1 elements, where fw.get(0) is the initial position (0), and fw.get(1) is after step 1, etc.\n\nSo for each i, the code is starting at the position after i steps (u = fw.get(i)), and then processing steps j from i to n-1. Each j represents the step being processed (i to j), so during the j-th step, the movement is from the position after j steps to the position after j+1 steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's reindex. The list fw has intervals for each step, including step 0 (initial position). So fw.get(i) is the interval after i steps. So when processing step j (0-based in the array a), which is the (j+1)-th step in fw.\n\nSo, in the loop for j from i to n-1, j is the index in the array a (0-based). So step j+1 in fw is the position after processing a[j].\n\nSo, for example, in the code:\n\nWhen i is 0, u is fw.get(0) (initial position 0). Then j runs from 0 to n-1. For each j, processing step j (a[j]), which is the (j+1)-th step in fw.\n\nBut how does this help in calculating the coverage?\n\nThe idea could be that for each i (starting step), we track the possible range of positions after step i. Then, for each j >= i, we process the steps from i to j, accumulating the coverage from each movement.\n\nBut the coverage for the movement from step i to step i+1 is the path from position after i steps to position after i+1 steps. So for each movement, the points covered are the integers between the previous position and the new position.\n\nBut since the previous and new positions are ranges (intervals), the possible movement during each step can vary. However, since the code has already adjusted the intervals during the backward pass, perhaps the ranges are now such that any choice within those ranges will lead to a valid path ending at 0.\n\nSo, the maximum coverage is achieved by choosing, for each step, the direction that covers the most new points, given the possible ranges.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach is to consider that for each step j (0-based), the movement from the previous position (prev) to the current position (curr) is determined by the a[j] (possibly replaced with a value in [-k, k] if a[j] is zero).\n\nThe points covered are the integers in the interval [prev, curr] or [curr, prev], depending on the direction.\n\nThe total coverage is the union of all these intervals for all steps.\n\nTo maximize this, for each step where a[j] is zero, we can choose the direction (left or right) that adds the maximum number of new points. However, this choice must be made in a way that ensures the final position is 0.\n\nBut given that the code's backward pass has already adjusted the intervals to ensure that the final position is 0, the possible ranges for each step are compatible with that. So, the code can choose any path within these ranges to maximize the coverage.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each step, given the possible previous position (prev in [start_prev, end_prev]) and possible current position (curr in [start_curr, end_curr]), what is the maximum possible union of intervals [prev, curr] (or [curr, prev] if direction is reversed) across all steps.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the code is trying to track the minimal and maximal positions encountered so far. For example, the maximum coverage is the difference between the maximum position and the minimum position plus 1 (if all positions in between are covered). But this is only possible if every step's movement fills in all the gaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each interval [i, j], the code computes the minimal and maximal positions that can be achieved during steps i to j, and then the total coverage is (max - min +1). Then, the answer is the sum of these over all intervals, but this seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the code could track the current coverage as the union of all intervals from previous steps. For each step j, it can expand the current coverage by the interval of movement during step j.\n\nBut since the code's loops are nested, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each possible starting step i and ending step j, the maximum coverage that can be achieved in that segment, and then sum all such maximums. But this approach would be O(n^2), which is acceptable since n is up to 3000.\n\nBut how to compute the coverage for each segment [i, j].\n\nLet's think again. The code's missing part is inside the j loop. Let's see:\n\nInitially, for i=0, j starts at 0. For each j, during the first iteration, we are processing step j (the j-th index in a, which is the (j+1)-th step in fw). The current position after j+1 steps is in the interval fw.get(j+1).\n\nThe movement during step j is from the position after j steps (fw.get(j)) to the position after j+1 steps (fw.get(j+1)). The points covered during this step are the integers between the previous position and the current position.\n\nSo, for step j, the movement is from a point in [fw.get(j).start, fw.get(j).end] to a point in [fw.get(j+1).start, fw.get(j+1).end]. The choice of how the movement occurs (the delta) depends on the possible ranges.\n\nTo maximize the coverage, we want the movement during step j to cover as many new points as possible. So, if possible, we choose the direction (left or right) that extends the coverage the most.\n\nBut how to compute this given the intervals.\n\nFor example, the previous position is in [prev_s, prev_e], and the current position is in [curr_s, curr_e]. The movement from prev to curr can be such that the path covers the maximum possible points. The maximum possible interval covered in this step would be from the minimal possible previous position to the maximal possible current position, or vice versa, depending on the direction.\n\nWait, but the movement during step j is from a position x (prev) to x + delta (current), where delta is determined by a[j]. If a[j] is non-zero, delta is fixed. If a[j] is zero, delta can be any value between -k and k, but subject to x + delta being in the current interval.\n\nBut given that the backward pass has already adjusted the intervals, the possible delta for step j is such that x + delta must be in the current interval (fw.get(j+1).start to fw.get(j+1).end). So delta is constrained by the previous x and the current interval.\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe the code is calculating, for each step j, the possible minimal and maximal positions that can be covered during that step's movement, given the previous interval and current interval.\n\nSo, for step j, the minimal previous position is prev_s, the maximal previous position is prev_e. The current position after the step is curr_s to curr_e.\n\nThe movement delta can be from (curr_s - prev_e) to (curr_e - prev_s). Because delta must be such that x (prev) + delta is in [curr_s, curr_e]. So for x in [prev_s, prev_e], delta is between curr_s - x and curr_e - x. Since x can vary, the possible delta ranges.\n\nBut how to find the maximal possible interval covered during this movement.\n\nThe maximal coverage for step j's movement is the union of all possible intervals from x to x + delta, for x in [prev_s, prev_e], and delta such that x + delta is in [curr_s, curr_e].\n\nThe maximal possible interval covered during this movement is the minimal of (prev_s + delta_min) to the maximal (prev_e + delta_max), where delta_min and delta_max are the possible delta values.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible start of the movement interval is prev_s + delta_min, and the maximal possible end is prev_e + delta_max. But delta depends on x.\n\nAlternatively, the possible movement during step j can cover from prev_s + (curr_s - prev_e) to prev_e + (curr_e - prev_s). Because delta for x=prev_e would be (curr_s - prev_e) (since x + delta >= curr_s, but x=prev_e is the maximum x, so delta could be as low as curr_s - prev_e). Similarly, for x=prev_s, delta could be as high as curr_e - prev_s.\n\nSo the movement during step j could cover a range from (prev_s + (curr_s - x)) for x varying to (prev_e + (curr_e - x)) for x varying. Wait, this seems a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible start of the movement's covered interval is prev_s + (curr_s - prev_e) = curr_s - (prev_e - prev_s). But that's not necessarily correct. Let's think.\n\nIf the previous position is x (in [prev_s, prev_e]), and delta is such that x + delta is in [curr_s, curr_e], then delta can range from (curr_s - x) to (curr_e - x). The movement during step j is from x to x + delta. The covered points are the integers between x and x+delta (inclusive).\n\nSo the minimal possible start of the covered interval during step j is x's minimal possible value (prev_s) plus delta's minimal possible value (curr_s - x). But delta's minimal possible value depends on x. For example, delta_min for x=prev_e is curr_s - prev_e. For x=prev_s, delta_min is curr_s - prev_s. So the minimal possible covered start is when x is prev_e and delta is delta_min (curr_s - prev_e). So the start of the covered interval is prev_e + (curr_s - prev_e) = curr_s. The maximal possible end is when x is prev_s and delta is delta_max (curr_e - prev_s). So the end is prev_s + (curr_e - prev_s) = curr_e.\n\nAlternatively, the movement during step j can cover a range from the minimal possible start to the maximal possible end. For example, if the previous position is x and the next position is y (x + delta), then the covered interval is from x to y. The minimal start of this interval is the minimal x (prev_s) plus the minimal delta (curr_s - x). The maximal end is the maximal x (prev_e) plus the maximal delta (curr_e - x).\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe there's a pattern here. For example, the movement during step j can cover all points between prev_s + delta_min (for x=prev_e) to prev_e + delta_max (for x=prev_s).\n\nBut delta_min for x=prev_e is curr_s - prev_e, so the start of the covered interval would be prev_e + (curr_s - prev_e) = curr_s. The delta_max for x=prev_s is curr_e - prev_s, so the end of the interval would be prev_s + (curr_e - prev_s) = curr_e. So the covered interval during step j is [curr_s, curr_e], but this is only if delta can be chosen such that for all x in [prev_s, prev_e], there exists a delta such that x + delta is in [curr_s, curr_e]. But perhaps this is not the case.\n\nWait, the movement during step j is from x to y, where x is in [prev_s, prev_e] and y is in [curr_s, curr_e]. So the covered interval is the union of all intervals from x to y, for all possible x and y in these ranges.\n\nThe union of all such intervals would be from the minimal possible x and y to the maximal possible x and y. But how to find that.\n\nThe minimal point covered is the minimal x (prev_s) or the minimal y (curr_s), whichever is smaller. Similarly, the maximal point covered is the maximal x (prev_e) or the maximal y (curr_e), whichever is larger. But since x and y are related by y = x + delta (delta depends on a[j] and the constraints), the minimal and maximal points covered can be calculated.\n\nAlternatively, the covered interval during step j is the interval from the minimal of prev_s and curr_s to the maximal of prev_e and curr_e. Because during the movement from x to y, all points between x and y are covered. So the union of all possible x to y ranges would be from the minimal x (prev_s) and minimal y (curr_s) to the maximal x (prev_e) and maximal y (curr_e). But this is only true if the movement can be arranged to cover all points between those extremes.\n\nBut perhaps the code is using this approach. For each step j, the covered interval is the union of all possible x to y intervals. The minimal start of this union is min(prev_s, curr_s), and the maximal end is max(prev_e, curr_e). Wait, no. Because if prev_s is 0 and curr_s is 5, then the covered interval during this step would be from 0 (prev_s) to y (which can be up to 5 + something?), but this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is calculating the total coverage as the sum of the lengths of each movement's interval, minus overlaps. But with the constraints of the intervals, the total coverage can be calculated as the maximum and minimum positions encountered so far.\n\nThis brings us to the idea of tracking the current minimal and maximal positions. For example, for each step, the movement could expand the current coverage to include new points. The total coverage would be the difference between the global maximum and minimum positions plus 1.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nIn the code's loops, for each i and j, perhaps they are tracking the current minimal and maximal positions. For example, during steps i to j, the code calculates the possible minimal and maximal positions based on the intervals in fw. Then, the coverage for these steps is (max - min +1), and this is added to the answer if it's larger than the current maximum.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet's think: for each j in the inner loop, after step j, the current minimal and maximal positions are tracked. The code would start with i=0, and j loops from i to n-1. For each j, during the step j, the movement is from the previous position (fw.get(j)) to the current position (fw.get(j+1)). The covered interval during this movement is the union of all possible paths from fw.get(j) to fw.get(j+1).\n\nThe minimal possible start is fw.get(j).start (previous position) and the minimal possible current position is fw.get(j+1).start. The maximal possible end is fw.get(j).end (previous position) and fw.get(j+1).end.\n\nBut during the movement, the actual covered points would be from the previous position to the current position. So the covered interval during step j is the minimal of previous positions and current positions, to the maximal of previous and current.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the previous position is in [1, 3], and the current position is in [5, 7], then during step j, the movement could be from 1 to 5 (covering 1-5), or from 3 to 7 (covering 3-7), etc. The union of all possible movements would be from 1 (the minimal previous) to 7 (the maximal current). So the covered interval during step j is [1,7], which includes all points between 1 and 7. The points covered would be 7-1 +1 =7 points.\n\nBut if the previous positions are [1,3] and current [5,7], then the movement from 1 to 5 covers 1-5 (5 points), movement from 3 to7 covers 3-7 (5 points), but the union is 1-7 (7 points). So the code would assume that during this step, all points from 1 to7 are covered.\n\nBut how can this be possible? If the movement is from 1 to5, then 1-5 is covered. If the movement is from 3 to7, then 3-7 is covered. But what about points between 5 and3? No, in this case, the movement is always to the right. So the previous positions are 1-3, and the current positions are 5-7. So all movements are to the right, meaning each step's movement is from x to y, where x <= y. So the covered points are x to y. The union of all possible x to y is from the minimal x (1) to the maximal y (7), which covers 1-7 (7 points).\n\nSo in this case, the code would consider the covered points as 1-7.\n\nBut if the previous positions are [3,5] and current positions are [1,2], then the movement is from x (3-5) to y (1-2). So x is larger than y. The covered points are y to x. So the union of all possible ranges would be from 1 (min of y) to5 (max of x). So the covered interval is 1-5, which has 5 points.\n\nThus, for each step, the covered interval is [min_prev, max_prev] union [min_curr, max_curr], and then the union of all movement ranges would be [min(min_prev, min_curr), max(max_prev, max_curr)].\n\nBut wait, the movement during the step is from x to y. So the interval covered during the step is x to y (if x <= y) or y to x (if y <x). So the covered interval is [min(x, y), max(x, y)].\n\nSo for all possible x in [prev_s, prev_e] and y in [curr_s, curr_e], the covered interval during this step is [min(x, y), max(x, y)].\n\nThe union of all such intervals would be [min_prev_curr, max_prev_curr], where min_prev_curr is the minimum between prev_s and curr_s, and max_prev_curr is the maximum between prev_e and curr_e.\n\nSo the covered interval during step j is from min_prev_curr to max_prev_curr.\n\nThe number of points covered during this step is max_prev_curr - min_prev_curr + 1.\n\nBut this is an overapproximation. Because if prev_s is 1, prev_e is 3, curr_s is 5, curr_e is7, then the covered interval is 1-7 (7 points). But any movement during this step would be from x in 1-3 to y in5-7. Each movement's interval is x to y (since x <y). The union of all possible x to y is 1-7.\n\nSo the code can model this step's coverage as the interval from min(prev_s, curr_s) to max(prev_e, curr_e), and the number of points is max - min +1.\n\nBut this is the maximum possible coverage for this step, assuming that the steps can be chosen to cover all points in that interval.\n\nSo the code's approach is to track the current coverage as a cumulative interval. For each i, j pair, the code tracks the current coverage interval (min and max) and adds the new coverage from step j.\n\nBut how does this fit into the existing code.\n\nThe code's missing part is inside the j loop. The variables distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end (the interval after i steps). For each j starting from i, they are processing step j.\n\nSo for j=i, step j is the first step in the current segment. The code needs to compute the coverage from step i to j.\n\nIn each iteration of j, the code processes step j and updates the current coverage.\n\nSo perhaps the code is tracking the current min and max positions. For each j, the current coverage is extended by the movement during step j.\n\nSo the code would have variables like currentMin and currentMax, which track the minimal and maximal positions covered from step i to j.\n\nInitially, for j=i, the movement is from u.start to fw.get(i+1).start and end. So the covered interval is [min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start), max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end)].\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, the code could compute the new min and max positions by considering the previous step's min and max, and the current step's interval.\n\nFor example, during step j (the j-th step in the array a, which is step j+1 in fw), the previous positions are in [prev_s, prev_e], and the current positions are in [curr_s, curr_e]. The movement during this step can cover points from the minimal of prev_s and curr_s to the maximal of prev_e and curr_e. So the new coverage interval is [min_prev_curr, max_prev_curr], where min_prev_curr is the minimum of prev_s and curr_s, and max_prev_curr is the maximum of prev_e and curr_e.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because the movement during this step is from x (prev) to y (current), which covers the interval [x, y] if x <=y, or [y, x] otherwise. The union of all possible [x, y] intervals for x in [prev_s, prev_e] and y in [curr_s, curr_e] is [min(prev_s, curr_s), max(prev_e, curr_e)].\n\nSo the code can model the coverage of this step as this interval, and the number of new points added is (max_prev_curr - min_prev_curr +1).\n\nBut how to accumulate this into the answer.\n\nThe answer starts at 1 (point 0). For each segment of steps from i to j, the code needs to compute the total coverage and update the answer if it's larger.\n\nBut in the code's current structure, the answer is calculated by looping through all possible i and j, and accumulating the coverage for each segment.\n\nBut this approach would be O(n^2), which is feasible for n=3000.\n\nSo, the missing code inside the j loop should compute the coverage for the current segment [i, j], and update the answer.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nHere's the idea: For each i and j, the code tracks the current coverage interval (min and max) from step i to j. The coverage for this segment is (current_max - current_min +1). The code's ans variable is the maximum between ans and this coverage.\n\nBut in the code's loops, for each i, the code starts with u = fw.get(i), which is the position after i steps. Then, for j from i to n-1, the code processes step j (the j-th element in a, which corresponds to step j+1 in fw).\n\nSo, for each j, the current step's interval is fw.get(j+1).\n\nThe code needs to track the cumulative min and max positions covered from step i to j.\n\nSo, in the missing code, for each j, the code would calculate the new min and max based on the previous step's min and max, and the current step's interval.\n\nBut how to initialize this.\n\nInitially, for j = i, the coverage is from step i to step i. Wait, step i+1 is the first step after i.\n\nWait, in the code's loops, i ranges from 0 to n-1. For each i, the code starts with u = fw.get(i), which is the interval after i steps. Then, for j from i to n-1, the code processes step j (the j-th element of a), which is step j+1 in fw.\n\nSo, when j = i, the step is j = i (element a[i], which is step i+1 in fw).\n\nThe movement during this step is from the interval u (fw.get(i)) to fw.get(i+1).\n\nSo, the covered interval during this step is [min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start), max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end)].\n\nThe number of points is (max - min +1).\n\nThen, for j = i+1, the movement during step j (a[j], which is step j+1 in fw) is from fw.get(j) to fw.get(j+1).\n\nBut the code's loops are nested, so for each j starting from i, the code needs to accumulate the coverage from step i to j.\n\nBut perhaps the code is tracking the running min and max for the current segment. So, for each j, the code computes the cumulative min and max from step i to j.\n\nFor example, when j = i:\n\ncurrentMin = Math.min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start);\ncurrentMax = Math.max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end);\npoints = currentMax - currentMin + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, points);\n\nThen, for j = i+1:\n\ncurrentMin = Math.min(currentMin, fw.get(j+1).start);\ncurrentMax = Math.max(currentMax, fw.get(j+1).end);\npoints = currentMax - currentMin + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, points);\n\nBut this is incorrect because it doesn't account for the movement between steps.\n\nBecause each step's movement covers the path from the previous position to the current position. The code's approach would only consider the union of the previous positions and current positions, but not the path between them.\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning, the covered interval during each step is the union of all possible paths, which is from the minimal of previous and current positions to the maximal of previous and current positions.\n\nThus, the code's approach is to track the cumulative min and max from step i to j, which is the min of all previous steps' mins and current step's min, and the max of all previous steps' maxes and current step's max.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because each step's coverage depends on the previous step's coverage.\n\nWait, no. Because each step's coverage is the path from the previous position to the current position. The union of all paths from step i to j is the interval from the minimal position in any step to the maximal position in any step. Because each movement covers all points between the previous and current positions.\n\nSo, for example, if the first step covers 0-5, the next step covers 5-3 (so the covered interval is 0-5 and 3-5, union is 0-5). The next step covers 3-7, so the union is 0-7. Thus, the maximum coverage is the maximum between the previous max and the current step's max, and the minimum is the minimum between previous min and current step's min.\n\nThus, the total coverage is (global_max - global_min + 1).\n\nSo, for each segment [i, j], the code can track the global min and max positions encountered in any of the steps from i to j. The coverage is then (global_max - global_min +1).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nFor each i and j, the code can track the cumulative global min and max.\n\nThe code would need to initialize currentMin and currentMax for the segment [i, j] starting at j=i, and then update them as j increases.\n\nBut how.\n\nLet's see. For j=i:\n\n- The previous positions after i steps are in [u.start, u.end].\n\n- The current positions after i+1 steps are in [fw.get(i+1).start, fw.get(i+1).end].\n\nThe movement during step j=i is from [u.start, u.end] to [fw.get(i+1).start, fw.get(i+1).end].\n\nThe covered interval during this step is from min_prev_curr to max_prev_curr.\n\nWhere min_prev_curr is the minimum of u.start and fw.get(i+1).start.\n\nAnd max_prev_curr is the maximum of u.end and fw.get(i+1).end.\n\nSo the coverage for this step is (max_prev_curr - min_prev_curr +1).\n\nThe cumulative min and max for segment [i, i] is min_prev_curr and max_prev_curr.\n\nFor j=i+1:\n\nThe current positions after j+1 steps are in [fw.get(j+1).start, fw.get(j+1).end].\n\nThe movement during step j=i+1 is from [fw.get(j).start, fw.get(j).end] to [fw.get(j+1).start, fw.get(j+1).end].\n\nThe covered interval during this step is from min(fw.get(j).start, fw.get(j+1).start) to max(fw.get(j).end, fw.get(j+1).end).\n\nThe cumulative coverage is from the min between previous cumulative min and the new step's min, and the max between previous cumulative max and the new step's max.\n\nSo for each j, the code should track the cumulative min and max as follows:\n\ncurrentMin = Math.min(currentMin, min_prev_curr);\n\ncurrentMax = Math.max(currentMax, max_prev_curr);\n\nWhere min_prev_curr is the min of the previous step's position and the current step's position (for the movement).\n\nWait, but the previous step's position is the cumulative min and max? No. The movement during step j is from the previous step's position (fw.get(j)) to the current step's position (fw.get(j+1)).\n\nSo, the covered interval during step j is from min(fw.get(j).start, fw.get(j+1).start) to max(fw.get(j).end, fw.get(j+1).end).\n\nThe cumulative coverage up to j would be the union of all such intervals from i to j.\n\nWhich is from the minimum of all min_prev_curr for steps i to j, and the maximum of all max_prev_curr for steps i to j.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, the cumulative min is the minimum of all the min_prev_curr for each step from i to j. The cumulative max is the maximum of all the max_prev_curr for each step from i to j.\n\nSo, for each step j, the code would compute the min_prev_curr and max_prev_curr for that step, and then update the cumulative min and max accordingly.\n\nBut this approach would be incorrect because the cumulative min and max are the overall min and max of all steps' min_prev_curr and max_prev_curr. But this is not correct, because the steps are connected. For example, step i to i+1's movement may cover a range that overlaps with previous steps.\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning, the total coverage is simply the global min and max of all positions encountered in any step. Because each movement covers all points between previous and current positions, the union of all these intervals is the interval from the global min to global max.\n\nSo, the code can track for each segment [i, j], the global min and max of all positions after each step, and also the positions during the steps.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the code can track the cumulative global min and max for the segment [i, j] as the min and max of the positions after each step and the positions during the steps.\n\nBut the positions during the steps are between the previous and current positions. However, the code's intervals after each step already account for all possible positions, so the global min and max would be the minimum of all the intervals' start and end, and the maximum of all intervals' start and end.\n\nWait, no. The code's intervals after each step (fw) are the possible positions after each step. But the movement during a step can be from a previous position (in fw.get(j)) to a current position (in fw.get(j+1)).\n\nThe covered points during step j are the path from the previous position to the current position. So for each step j, the covered points are the interval from prev_start to curr_end, assuming that the previous positions are all prev_start and the current positions are all curr_end. But this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Perhaps the code's intended approach is to track for each possible segment [i, j] the cumulative global min and max of the positions after each step and during the steps. Then, the coverage is the difference between the max and min plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nInside the loop for i, the code initializes distR and distL as u.start and u.end. Then, for each j, the code loops from i to n-1. Perhaps these variables distR and distL are tracking the current cumulative min and max.\n\nFor example, for j=i:\n\nAfter processing step j, the movement is from u.start and u.end to fw.get(j+1).start and end.\n\nSo, the covered interval during this step is min(u.start, fw.get(j+1).start) to max(u.end, fw.get(j+1).end).\n\nThe cumulative min and max are these values.\n\nThen, for j=i+1:\n\nThe movement is from fw.get(j) to fw.get(j+1).\n\nThe covered interval during this step is min(fw.get(j).start, fw.get(j+1).start) to max(fw.get(j).end, fw.get(j+1).end).\n\nThe cumulative min and max are the min between previous cumulative min and current step's min, and the max between previous cumulative max and current step's max.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each j in i to n-1:\n\nprev_step = j\n\ncurrent_step = j+1\n\nstep_min = Math.min(fw.get(prev_step).start, fw.get(current_step).start)\n\nstep_max = Math.max(fw.get(prev_step).end, fw.get(current_step).end)\n\ncumulative_min = Math.min(cumulative_min, step_min)\n\ncumulative_max = Math.max(cumulative_max, step_max)\n\ncoverage = cumulative_max - cumulative_min + 1\n\nans = Math.max(ans, coverage)\n\nBut how to initialize cumulative_min and cumulative_max for each i and j loop.\n\nFor each i, when j=i:\n\nprev_step = i\n\ncurrent_step = i+1\n\nstep_min = Math.min(fw.get(i).start, fw.get(i+1).start)\n\nstep_max = Math.max(fw.get(i).end, fw.get(i+1).end)\n\ncumulative_min = step_min\n\ncumulative_max = step_max\n\ncoverage = step_max - step_min +1\n\nans is updated.\n\nThen, for j=i+1:\n\nprev_step = i+1\n\ncurrent_step = i+2\n\nstep_min = Math.min(fw.get(i+1).start, fw.get(i+2).start)\n\nstep_max = Math.max(fw.get(i+1).end, fw.get(i+2).end)\n\ncumulative_min = Math.min(cumulative_min, step_min)\n\ncumulative_max = Math.max(cumulative_max, step_max)\n\ncoverage = cumulative_max - cumulative_min +1\n\nans is updated.\n\nBut this approach would capture the cumulative min and max over all steps from i to j.\n\nBut this approach might not be correct. For example, suppose during step i to j, the steps have varying min and max. But the code's approach would track the overall min and max of all steps' min and max.\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning, the total coverage is the interval from the global min to global max of all positions encountered in any step. So this approach should work.\n\nThus, the missing code should initialize cumulative_min and cumulative_max for each i, and then for each j from i to n-1, update them based on the current step's min and max.\n\nIn the code's current structure, the variables distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end (the interval after i steps). Then, for each j in i to n-1, the code must process step j.\n\nBut step j's movement is from the previous interval (fw.get(j)) to the current interval (fw.get(j+1)).\n\nSo, for each j in i to n-1:\n\n- The previous interval is fw.get(j).\n\n- The current interval is fw.get(j+1).\n\n- The movement during step j is from a position in the previous interval to a position in the current interval.\n\n- The covered interval during step j is [min_prev_curr, max_prev_curr], where min_prev_curr is the minimum of previous.start and current.start, and max_prev_curr is the maximum of previous.end and current.end.\n\nSo, for each j in i to n-1:\n\nFor each step j in the current segment [i, j], the code needs to compute the cumulative min and max.\n\nBut how to track this for each i and j.\n\nThe code's current loop structure is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    Interval u = fw.get(i);\n    long distR = u.start;\n    long distL = u.end;\n    for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {\n        // TODO\n    }\n}\n\nInside the j loop, the code should track the cumulative min and max for the segment [i, j], and update the answer accordingly.\n\nSo, for each i, j, we need to compute:\n\ncumulative_min = min of (min_prev_curr for steps i to j)\n\ncumulative_max = max of (max_prev_curr for steps i to j)\n\ncoverage = cumulative_max - cumulative_min +1\n\nans = max(ans, coverage)\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe code can track for each j:\n\ncurrent_min = min between previous current_min and the current step's min_prev_curr.\n\ncurrent_max = max between previous current_max and the current step's max_prev_curr.\n\nThus, inside the j loop:\n\nFor each j, step j is processed (the j-th element in a array, corresponding to step j+1 in fw.\n\nSo:\n\nInterval current_prev = fw.get(j);\nInterval current_curr = fw.get(j+1);\nlong step_min = Math.min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start);\nlong step_max = Math.max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end);\n// Now, compute the cumulative min and max for this segment\nif (j == i) {\n    // first step in the segment\n    distR = step_min;\n    distL = step_max;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, step_min);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, step_max);\n}\nlong coverage = distL - distR + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, coverage);\n\nWait, the variables distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end (the interval after i steps). But u.start and u.end are the positions after i steps. But for the first step in the segment (j=i), the movement is from i to i+1.\n\nSo, the code would need to track the cumulative min and max for the steps j=i to j.\n\nSo, for j=i:\n\nprevious interval is fw.get(i) (u), current interval is fw.get(i+1).\n\nstep_min = min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start)\n\nstep_max = max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end)\n\ndistR and distL are initialized to step_min and step_max.\n\nThen, for j=i+1:\n\nprevious interval is fw.get(i+1), current interval is fw.get(i+2).\n\nstep_min = min(fw.get(i+1).start, fw.get(i+2).start)\n\nstep_max = max(fw.get(i+1).end, fw.get(i+2).end)\n\ndistR is updated to min(distR, step_min)\n\ndistL is updated to max(distL, step_max)\n\nThis way, distR tracks the cumulative min over all steps' step_min, and distL tracks the cumulative max over all steps' step_max.\n\nThus, the coverage for the segment [i, j] is (distL - distR +1), which is the maximum possible coverage.\n\nSo, the missing code inside the j loop should be:\n\nInterval current_prev = fw.get(j);\nInterval current_curr = fw.get(j+1);\nlong step_min = Math.min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start);\nlong step_max = Math.max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    // First step in this segment\n    distR = step_min;\n    distL = step_max;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, step_min);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, step_max);\n}\nlong coverage = distL - distR + 1;\nans = Math.max(ans, coverage);\n\nThis code would update the distR and distL for each j, tracking the cumulative min and max of the steps' step_min and step_max, and then compute the coverage.\n\nThis seems to fit into the existing code structure, where distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end for each i.\n\nBut wait, initializing distR and distL to u.start and u.end is not correct for the first step (j=i), because the first step's movement is from u to fw.get(i+1).\n\nSo, the correct initial values for distR and distL when j=i are the min between u.start and fw.get(i+1).start, and the max between u.end and fw.get(i+1).end.\n\nBut in the existing code, distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end. Then, inside the j loop, when j=i, the code would process the first step (i), and compute step_min and step_max as the min and max between u.start and fw.get(i+1).start/end.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nFor j = i:\n\ncurrent_prev = fw.get(j) = fw.get(i) = u.\n\ncurrent_curr = fw.get(j+1) = fw.get(i+1).\n\nstep_min = Math.min(u.start, fw.get(i+1).start).\n\nstep_max = Math.max(u.end, fw.get(i+1).end).\n\nSince j ==i, distR and distL are set to step_min and step_max.\n\nThen, for j >i, these variables are updated with the min and max of the current step's step_min and step_max.\n\nThis correctly tracks the cumulative min and max of all step's step_min and step_max.\n\nThus, the missing code should be:\n\ncurrent_prev = fw.get(j);\ncurrent_curr = fw.get(j+1);\nstep_min = Math.min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start);\nstep_max = Math.max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = step_min;\n    distL = step_max;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, step_min);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, step_max);\n}\nans = Math.max(ans, distL - distR + 1);\n\nThus, in the code's inner loop, for each j from i to n-1, the code processes step j, computes the step's covered interval, updates the cumulative distR and distL, and updates the answer.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nInterval curr = fw.get(j + 1);\nlong currentStepMin = Math.min(curr.start, curr.end);\nlong currentStepMax = Math.max(curr.start, curr.end);\n\nWait, no. Because current_prev is fw.get(j), and current_curr is fw.get(j+1). So the movement is from current_prev to current_curr.\n\nThe step's covered interval is [min(current_prev.start, current_curr.start), max(current_prev.end, current_curr.end)].\n\nSo, the step_min is the minimum between current_prev.start and current_curr.start.\n\nstep_max is the maximum between current_prev.end and current_curr.end.\n\nThus, the code inside the j loop is:\n\nInterval prevInterval = fw.get(j);\nInterval currInterval = fw.get(j + 1);\nlong stepMin = Math.min(prevInterval.start, currInterval.start);\nlong stepMax = Math.max(prevInterval.end, currInterval.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = stepMin;\n    distL = stepMax;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, stepMin);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, stepMax);\n}\nlong coverage = distL - distR + 1;\nif (coverage > ans) {\n    ans = coverage;\n}\n\nSo, the code would update distR and distL for each j and compute the coverage.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the j loop is:\n\nInterval prev = fw.get(j);\nInterval curr = fw.get(j + 1);\nlong stepMin = Math.min(prev.start, curr.start);\nlong stepMax = Math.max(prev.end, curr.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = stepMin;\n    distL = stepMax;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, stepMin);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, stepMax);\n}\nans = Math.max(ans, distL - distR + 1);\n\nSo, the code for the missing part would be:\n\nInterval prev = fw.get(j);\nInterval curr = fw.get(j + 1);\nlong stepMin = Math.min(prev.start, curr.start);\nlong stepMax = Math.max(prev.end, curr.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = stepMin;\n    distL = stepMax;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, stepMin);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, stepMax);\n}\nans = Math.max(ans, distL - distR + 1);\n\nThis should correctly compute the maximum coverage for each segment [i, j] and update the answer accordingly.\n\nSo, the missing code is:\n\nInterval prevInterval = fw.get(j);\nInterval currInterval = fw.get(j + 1);\nlong stepMin = Math.min(prevInterval.start, currInterval.start);\nlong stepMax = Math.max(prevInterval.end, currInterval.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = stepMin;\n    distL = stepMax;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, stepMin);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, stepMax);\n}\nans = Math.max(ans, distL - distR + 1);\n\nBut how to translate this into Java code inside the loop.\n\nThe code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n; j++) {\n    Interval prev = fw.get(j);\n    Interval curr = fw.get(j+1);\n    long stepMin = Math.min(prev.start, curr.start);\n    long stepMax = Math.max(prev.end, curr.end);\n    if (j == i) {\n        distR = stepMin;\n        distL = stepMax;\n    } else {\n        distR = Math.min(distR, stepMin);\n        distL = Math.max(distL, stepMax);\n    }\n    ans = Math.max(ans, distL - distR + 1);\n}\n\nBut wait, in the code's current structure, the variables distR and distL are initialized to u.start and u.end, which are the start and end of the interval after i steps. But when j=i, the code processes step j (the i-th index in a), which is the (i+1)-th step in fw.\n\nBut the code for j=i is:\n\nprev = fw.get(j) -> which is fw.get(i), which is the interval after i steps.\n\ncurr = fw.get(j+1) -> which is fw.get(i+1), the interval after i+1 steps.\n\nSo, stepMin is Math.min(fw.get(i).start, fw.get(i+1).start)\n\nstepMax is Math.max(fw.get(i).end, fw.get(i+1).end)\n\nThen, distR and distL are set to these values.\n\nFor j=i+1:\n\nprev = fw.get(i+1), curr = fw.get(i+2).\n\nstepMin is Math.min(fw.get(i+1).start, fw.get(i+2).start)\n\nstepMax is Math.max(fw.get(i+1).end, fw.get(i+2).end)\n\ndistR is the min between previous distR (stepMin from j=i) and current stepMin.\n\ndistL is the max between previous distL (stepMax from j=i) and current stepMax.\n\nThis accumulates the global min and max across all steps from i to j.\n\nThus, the code correctly computes the maximum coverage.\n\nSo, the missing code is the code above. This would replace the /* TODO: Your code here */ part.\n\nSo, the final code to fill in is:\n\nInterval prev = fw.get(j);\nInterval curr = fw.get(j+1);\nlong stepMin = Math.min(prev.start, curr.start);\nlong stepMax = Math.max(prev.end, curr.end);\nif (j == i) {\n    distR = stepMin;\n    distL = stepMax;\n} else {\n    distR = Math.min(distR, stepMin);\n    distL = Math.max(distL, stepMax);\n}\nans = Math.max(ans, distL - distR + 1);"
