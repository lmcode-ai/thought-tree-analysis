The existing code handles division 1, 2, and 4. The missing part is for division 3. The comment says # TODO: Your code here, so that's where I need to fill in. The conditions for division 3 are when the rating is between 1400 and 1599, inclusive. Wait, looking at the original description: Division 3 is 1400 \u2264 rating \u2264 1599. The current condition in the elif is n >= 1400 and n <1600. Oh right, because the code uses elif statements in order. So if the first condition (n >=1900) is false, then check if it's >=1600 and <1900 (division 2). Then the next condition is >=1400 and <1600. Wait, but the code currently has \"elif n >= 1400 and n <1600: ...\" So for that case, the correct division is 3. So in the missing code, the print statement should be \"Division 3\". So the code under that elif should just print(\"Division 3\"). But wait, looking at the existing code, the other conditions print the division number.",

So adding print(\"Division\", 3) there would fix the code. Let me double-check the note in the problem statement. For example, when the rating is 1400, it's division 3. The code's condition for division 3 is n >=1400 and <1600. So 1400 is included here, which is correct. Similarly, 1599 is included. So yes, that condition is correct.
