So the code's data structures need to be adjusted. The current code has:\n\nvector<int> vecc(m);\n\nBut vecc is being filled with a_x + a_y. However, the code doesn't store the x and y for each pair. So we need to modify this. For example, store a vector of pairs (x, y) in addition to vecc. But in the code provided, the code reads x and y, and then does:\n\nvecc[i] = vec[x-1] + vec[y-1];\nmass[x-1] += 1, mass[y-1] += 1; So during this loop, the code could also save x and y in another vector, say, 'pairs', which is a vector of pairs (or two separate vectors for x and y). Then, during the else block, when m is odd, the code can loop through the pairs and check for each (x, y) whether (mass[x-1] + mass[y-1]) % 2 == 0. So the code needs to store the x and y of each pair. But in the current code, this is not done. So the code has a bug here. But the code provided in the problem is missing some parts, and the user is to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code is structured in such a way that even with this mistake, the user can fill in the missing parts to make it work. Wait, let's look at the code again. The code in the else block:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n{\n    if (mass[i] % 2 == 1)\n    {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\nfor (i = 0; i < m; ++i)\n{\n    st = min(st, vecc[i]);\n} So the code's first loop is checking for nodes with odd degrees. The missing code here is to track the minimal a_i (vec[i]) for such nodes.",

But since the code doesn't have access to x and y for each pair, this is not possible. So perhaps the code has a mistake here, and the correct solution requires storing x and y for each pair.

No, wait, no. If you invite 2 and 3, then the uninvited members are 1. So their sum is 3. But the sample says the answer is 2. Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck the sample description. In the note for the second test case:\n\nThe minimum unhappiness is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The unhappiness is a_1=3 + a_2 and 3 are invited. Wait, no. The uninvited members are those not invited. So if 2 and 3 are invited, the uninvited members are 1, so the sum is a_1=3. But the sample says the answer is 2. So there's a contradiction here.

So the m is 1, which is odd. So the code would not output zero. So the correct answer is to have cakes even. So when m is 1, you need to adjust. So in the sample, the correct answer is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, leading to no cakes (since the pair (1,2) is not invited). So uninvited members are 1, so sum is 3. But sample says the answer is 2, which is not matching. So perhaps the sample input is different. Let me recheck the problem statement. Ah, the problem statement's note says:\n\nIn the second test case, the options include invite 2 and 3. The cakes eaten are zero, so the sum of uninvited a_i is 1 (a_1=3) plus 0 if others are invited. Wait, no. If they are invited, the uninvited members are 1. So sum is 3. But the sample says the answer is 2. Hmm, this suggests that the sample input is different. Perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the second test case's input is:\n\nn=3, m=1\n\na = [3, 5, 2]\n\npairs (1,2). Then the correct answer would be 2, by inviting 3, which sum is 3+5=8 uninvited, but that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me refer back to the sample note. The sample note for the second test case says: The minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. This gives 0 cakes (because the pair (1,2) is not invited (since 1 is not invited). So the number of cakes is 0 (even). The uninvited members are 1, so the sum is a_1=3. But the sample says the answer is 2. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, perhaps the sample input for the second test case is different. For example:\n\nMaybe the a array is [2,5,3], and the pair is (1,3). Then, inviting 2 and 3 would not include the pair (1,3), so cakes=0. Uninvited members are 1, sum is 2.",

But this suggests that the code's current approach is incorrect for that case. So the code's approach when m is odd is to take the minimal between the minimal a_i (among nodes with odd degrees) and the minimal a_x + a_y (among all pairs). But in the sample where the correct answer is 2, this suggests that there's a pair (x,y) where a_x + a_y is 2, and their degrees' sum is even. But according to the code's current approach, the code would check all pairs. So in the sample case where the pair's sum is 2, the code would take that as the minimal and output 2. But how does that happen if the code's current approach doesn't check the parity of the degrees for the pair? So the code's current approach is incorrect. But the sample's answer is achieved by including a pair where their sum is 2, and their degrees sum to even. So the code's current approach would have to include such a pair, but the code's current loop over pairs doesn't check the degrees' parity, leading to an incorrect result.",

Then, in the loop over pairs, the code considers all pairs. But this is incorrect. However, perhaps in some cases, the minimal a_x + a_y pair happens to have even sum of degrees. So in the sample test case 2, perhaps the minimal a_x + a_y is not 3+5=8, but the code's second loop would not find a better option. So why is the sample's answer 2?\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the code's approach. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, and the correct solution requires considering another scenario. Another approach to the problem is as follows:\n\nWhen m is odd, the optimal solution is to either:\n\n1. Exclude a single node with odd degree (cost a_i), leading to even C.\n\nOR\n\n2.",

In this case, the code would process as follows:\n\nm is 1 (odd). Nodes 0 and 1 have degrees 1 each (mass[i] is 1). Loop over nodes with odd degrees: minimal a_i is 2 (node 0's a_i is 2). Then, loop over pairs (1,2) in the pair, a_x + a_y is 2+5=7. So st is min(2,7) =2. So the code's answer is 2, which matches the sample's output. Ah! So the code's approach would work if the a array is such that the minimal a_i for a node with odd degree is the correct answer.

But in some cases, the minimal a_x + a_y happens to be from a pair with even sum of degrees, so the code would work. So the code's approach is incorrect, but the problem requires that the user fills in the missing code. So perhaps the code's missing part is to track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees, and the code's loop over pairs is incorrect, but the user is to fill in the correct code. But given the code's structure, the user can only fill in the missing code in the first loop (the TODO part).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum possible total unhappiness value for a party, given certain constraints. The main constraint is that the number of cakes (which corresponds to the number of friend pairs where both are invited) must be even. \n\nLet me break down the problem:\n\nEach member has an unhappiness value if they are not invited. So, the goal is to invite a subset of members such that the sum of a_i for uninvited members is minimized. But, the number of friend pairs (both invited) must be even.\n\nSo the key is to find the subset where the number of such pairs is even, and the sum of a_i for those not invited is as small as possible. Alternatively, since the sum of a_i not invited is equivalent to the total sum of a_i minus the sum of invited a_i. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of selecting which members to invite to maximize the sum of their a_i (since minimizing the uninvited sum is the same as maximizing the sum of invited a_i, given that the total a_i is fixed). Hmm, but perhaps the problem can be approached by considering when all possible selections are allowed except for the even number of cakes.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is structured, the answer might have to consider two scenarios: when the total number of friend pairs (m) is even, then maybe the best solution is to invite everyone, leading to m cakes, which is even. But when m is odd, then we need to adjust the selection so that the number of cakes is even (i.e., reduce it by an odd number, making it even). So perhaps the problem can be split into two cases based on the parity of m.\n\nLet me look at the code provided. The existing code checks if m is even. If it is, then it prints 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when m is even, inviting all members would result in m cakes, which is even. So the uninvited sum is zero. But if that's the case, then the code would output zero. But wait, in the first example given, when all are invited, the unhappiness is zero. So that's correct. So when m is even, the optimal solution is to invite everyone, and the unhappiness is zero.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So if everyone is invited, the sum is zero. That's correct. So for m even, the answer is zero. But what if m is even, but there's a better way to not invite some people to get a higher a_i sum? Wait, no. Because the problem is to minimize the sum of uninvited a_i. So the minimal possible is zero if everyone is invited. Which is allowed only if m is even. Because when m is even, the number of cakes (m) is even, so the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo the code's first part checks if m is even, then outputs zero. That's correct.\n\nBut when m is odd, we need to adjust. So in the code's else block, there's a loop over all members and then a loop over all friend pairs.\n\nWait, let me see. The code, when m is odd, does the following:\n\n- For each member i, checks if mass[i] (which is the degree of the node in the friend graph) is odd. If so, then there's some code missing here. Then, it loops over all the friend pairs and finds the minimum sum of a_i + a_j (vecc[i] is the sum for pair i). Then, st is the minimum between the existing st and those sums.\n\nFinally, it prints st.\n\nSo the code is trying to find the minimum between two possible options: removing a single member (with odd degree?) or removing a pair of friends (so that the number of cakes is reduced by an odd number, making the total even).\n\nWait, when m is odd, the total number of cakes is the number of friend pairs where both are invited. To make this even, we need to have the number of such pairs be even. So the original m is odd. We can either reduce it by an odd number (so m - x is even, where x is odd) or increase it by an odd number (but that's impossible since you can't have more pairs than existing). Wait, no. The total number of cakes is the number of pairs (x,y) that are friends and both are invited. So when you don't invite some people, the number of cakes is the number of such pairs where both are in the invited set.\n\nSo if m is odd, the initial total (if all are invited) is m, which is odd. We need to make this even. So we need to exclude some pairs so that the number of pairs in the invited set is even.\n\nTo achieve this, we can either:\n\n1. Exclude a single friend pair, but that would reduce the count by 1, making it even. But how do we exclude a pair? Because if we exclude either x or y in the pair, then that pair is not counted. So if a pair is currently in the invited set (because both are invited), to remove it from the count, we need to exclude either x or y. Excluding either would remove all pairs that involve x or y. So perhaps the optimal way is to find a pair (x,y) where a_x + a_y is minimal. Excluding both would not be necessary; excluding either x or y would remove this pair. But if we exclude just one of them, the sum of uninvited a_i would be a_x (if we exclude x) or a_y (if we exclude y). But this would also affect other pairs that include x or y.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nThe initial approach in the code when m is odd is to consider two possibilities:\n\na) Remove exactly one pair (so that the total becomes m-1, which is even). But how to remove exactly one pair? Because removing a pair (x,y) can be done by excluding x or y. But excluding x would remove all pairs involving x, not just (x,y). So this approach may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal a_i where i has an odd degree. Because flipping the inclusion of such a node could change the parity of the total number of pairs. Wait, perhaps this is related to the graph's degrees.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is needed. Let's think about the problem in terms of parity.\n\nThe problem requires that the number of cakes (pairs where both are invited) is even. Let's denote this number as C. Initially, if all are invited, C = m. If m is even, then we can take that (so answer 0). If m is odd, then we need to adjust C to be even. To do that, we need to change the parity of C by 1 (from odd to even). So we need to find the minimal cost to reduce the total by 1 (mod 2).\n\nBut how can we achieve this?\n\nEach possible way to adjust the set of invited members changes C. For example, excluding a member x would remove all pairs that include x. So the number of pairs removed is equal to the number of friends x has (mass[x] is the degree of x). So if x's degree is d, then excluding x would remove d pairs from C. So the parity of C would change by d mod 2. So if d is odd, then excluding x changes the parity of C. If d is even, excluding x doesn't change the parity.\n\nSo, for example, if m is odd, and we exclude a member x with an odd degree, then the number of pairs removed is d, which is odd, so the new C is m - d. Since m is odd and d is odd, m-d is even. So that's acceptable. So excluding x (which has an odd degree) would result in C being even.\n\nAlternatively, if x's degree is even, then m - d is odd, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo in the case when m is odd, the possible options are:\n\n1. Find a member x with an odd degree. Excluding x. The cost is a_x. The new C is m - d_x. Since d_x is odd, m - d_x is even (since m is odd, odd minus odd is even). So this gives a valid solution. The cost is a_x. So we need to find the minimal a_x among all nodes with odd degree.\n\n2. Find a pair of friends (x,y). Exclude both x and y. Then the number of pairs removed is all pairs involving x or y. But this approach might be more complicated. Alternatively, if we exclude either x or y, the pair (x,y) is removed. But also other pairs. But perhaps the minimal cost is to find a pair (x,y) where a_x + a_y is minimized. Excluding x would cost a_x and remove d_x pairs. Excluding y would cost a_y and remove d_y pairs. But perhaps excluding both is better? Or perhaps the minimal sum of a_x and a_y for any pair is another option.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when we exclude x, we remove all pairs involving x. So the change in C is the number of pairs that were previously included (both x and the friend were invited). So if x is excluded, then all pairs (x, friend) are excluded. So the initial C is m, which is odd. If we exclude x, then the new C is m - (number of friends of x that were included, which is the degree of x if all friends are included). But this assumes that all friends are included. Wait, but if we exclude x, then the friends may or may not be included. So this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to consider two possibilities:\n\n- Either exclude a single node with odd degree, leading to C being even. The cost is a_x.\n\n- Or exclude a pair of friends (x,y), which would remove at least the pair (x,y), but if we exclude x, that's a cost of a_x and removes all pairs involving x. Alternatively, exclude y (cost a_y). But how does that affect the parity?\n\nWait, let's think again. When m is odd, the initial C is m. We need to reduce it by an odd number of pairs so that it becomes even. So the total reduction must be odd.\n\nSo how can we achieve that?\n\nOption 1: Exclude a node x whose degree is odd. Because then, the number of pairs removed is equal to x's degree (since all friends are invited initially). So m - d_x is even. But d_x is odd, so m (odd) minus d_x (odd) is even. The reduction is d_x (odd), which changes the parity from odd to even. The cost is a_x.\n\nOption 2: Exclude two nodes x and y such that the number of pairs removed (from their friends) is odd. For example, if x and y form a pair (i.e., they are friends), then excluding both x and y would remove all pairs involving x or y. Let's say x has degree dx and y has degree dy, and they share k pairs (including the pair (x,y)). So the total pairs removed would be (dx + dy - k) (since the pair (x,y) is counted in both dx and dy, so subtracting 1 for the overlap). But I'm not sure how to compute this. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal way to achieve a reduction by 1 pair (so the total becomes even) is to exclude exactly one pair. But how?\n\nBut how can you reduce the count by exactly one? For example, if you have a pair (x,y) and you exclude either x or y. Then the pair (x,y) is excluded. But also, any other pairs that include x (if x is excluded) or y (if y is excluded). So the total reduction is dx (if x is excluded) or dy (if y is excluded). So if dx is even, then excluding x would reduce the count by even number of pairs. So that would not help. But if dx is odd, then excluding x would reduce by an odd number, which would make the parity even. But this is similar to option 1.\n\nWait, but in option 1, if you exclude x (with dx odd), then the total reduction is dx. So the new C is m - dx, which is even. The cost is a_x.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there's a pair (x,y) where dx is even and dy is even. If you exclude x, the reduction is dx (even), so the new C is m - dx. Since m is odd, and dx is even, m - dx is odd. Not acceptable. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if you exclude both x and y. Then, the pairs removed are dx + dy - 1 (since the pair (x,y) is counted once in dx and once in dy, so subtract 1). So the total pairs removed is (dx + dy - 1). The parity of this is (dx + dy -1) mod 2. So if dx and dy are both even, then (even + even -1) = odd. So the total reduction is odd. So m (odd) - (odd) = even. So that works. The cost in this case is a_x + a_y. So in this scenario, the total cost is a_x + a_y, and the total reduction is odd. So this is another possible option.\n\nSo when m is odd, the minimal cost could be the minimum between:\n\n- The minimal a_x among all nodes with odd degree.\n\n- The minimal a_x + a_y among all pairs (x,y) where dx and dy are both even, and (x,y) is a pair. Because in that case, excluding both x and y would reduce the count by (dx + dy -1). If dx and dy are even, then dx + dy -1 is even + even -1 = odd. So this reduction makes the total even. So the cost is a_x + a_y.\n\nWait, but why would dx and dy have to be even? Because when you exclude x and y, the pairs removed include all pairs that x is part of and all pairs that y is part of. But since x and y are friends, the pair (x,y) is counted once. So the total removed pairs is (number of pairs involving x) + (number of pairs involving y) - 1 (because (x,y) is counted twice). So that's dx + dy - 1. For this sum to be odd, dx + dy must be even. Because (dx + dy -1) mod 2 is ( (dx mod 2) + (dy mod 2) -1 ) mod 2. So if dx and dy are both even, then dx mod 2 is 0, dy mod 2 is 0. So 0+0-1 mod 2 is 1. So the sum is odd. So the reduction is odd. So m (odd) - odd = even. Which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if dx and dy are both odd, then (1+1-1)=1 mod 2, which is 1. So the sum is odd. So the reduction is 1. Which would make m (odd) - 1 = even. So that also works. So the condition is that (dx + dy) must be even. So dx and dy have the same parity. Because dx + dy is even iff dx and dy are both even or both odd.\n\nSo in that case, excluding both x and y would reduce the count by (dx + dy -1) pairs, which is even + even -1 (if both even) gives odd, or odd + odd -1 (which is even, but 1 mod 2). Wait, dx and dy are both odd: (1+1 -1) =1 mod 2. So the reduction is 1. So the total C is m-1, which is even.\n\nSo in that case, the cost is a_x + a_y, and the reduction is 1. But how does that compare to other options?\n\nSo the possible options when m is odd are:\n\n1. Exclude a single node x with an odd degree. The cost is a_x. The reduction is dx (odd), leading to even C.\n\n2. Exclude a pair (x,y) such that (dx and dy) have the same parity. The cost is a_x + a_y. The reduction is (dx + dy -1) pairs. The sum's parity is (dx + dy -1) mod 2. For the reduction to be odd, (dx + dy -1) must be odd. So dx + dy must be even. So dx and dy have the same parity. Then, the reduction is odd, which is needed. So this option is valid.\n\nSo the minimal possible cost is the minimum between the two options.\n\nSo the code's approach when m is odd is to first loop through all nodes to find those with odd degrees and track the minimal a_i among them, and then loop through all pairs to find the minimal a_x + a_y among pairs where x and y have the same parity in their degrees. Then, the answer is the minimal between these two options.\n\nWait, but the code provided in the problem currently does not handle this. Let's look at the code again.\n\nIn the code's else block (when m is odd):\n\nThe code loops through all nodes i. For those with mass[i] (degree) % 2 == 1, the code has a missing part (TODO). Then, after that loop, it loops through all pairs and computes the minimum of vecc[i] (which is a_x + a_y for each pair). Then, st is printed.\n\nSo the code currently only considers the minimal sum of a_x + a_y for all pairs as one possible option, and the other option is considering nodes with odd degrees.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the code is missing two things:\n\n- The first loop (over nodes) should track the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degrees.\n\n- The second loop (over pairs) should track the minimal a_x + a_y among pairs where x and y have degrees of the same parity (so that their sum is even, leading to an odd reduction when both are excluded).\n\nBut in the current code, the loop over pairs just takes all pairs into account, regardless of their degrees' parity. So that's incorrect.\n\nSo the code's approach in the else block is:\n\nFind the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees (missing code in the first loop), and find the minimal a_x + a_y for any pair. Then, take the minimum between these two options. But this is incorrect, because the pair option is only valid for pairs where x and y have degrees of the same parity. Otherwise, excluding them would not give the required parity.\n\nSo the code's current approach for the else case is incomplete.\n\nSo the missing code in the first loop (when mass[i] is odd) should be adding code to track the minimal a_i among those nodes. Then, in the second loop, for each pair, check if the sum of their degrees is even (i.e., same parity), and if so, track the minimal a_x + a_y.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nThe variable st is initialized to a very large value (99999999999). Then, in the first loop (over nodes with odd degrees), the code should compare st with vec[i] (a_i) and take the minimum.\n\nThen, in the second loop (over pairs), for each pair, check if the sum of their degrees is even. If yes, then compare st with the sum of their a_i's and take the minimum.\n\nSo the code's missing part in the first loop is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nBecause vec[i] is a_i. For each node i with odd degree, the cost of excluding it is a_i. So track the minimal such a_i.\n\nThen, in the loop over pairs, for each pair (x,y), check if (mass[x-1] + mass[y-1]) % 2 == 0. If yes, then this pair's a_x + a_y is a candidate for the second option. So the code should compute vecc[i] (sum of a_x and a_y) and compare it to st.\n\nWait, but in the code, the vecc[i] is initialized as vec[x-1] + vec[y-1] when the pair is read. So each vecc[i] holds the sum of the a values for the pair (x,y).\n\nSo in the code's else block, after handling the nodes with odd degrees, the loop over pairs should check if (mass[x-1] + mass[y-1]) is even.\n\nBut how to get x and y in the loop? Because in the code, when the pairs are read, they are stored as x and y, but the vecc[i] is the sum of their a values. However, in the code's loop over the pairs (for i in 0 to m-1), the code does not have the x and y values stored. So how to check their degrees?\n\nWait, the code's data structures:\n\nvecc is a vector of size m, where vecc[i] is a_x + a_y for the i-th pair. However, the original x and y for each pair are not stored. So in the code's else block, the loop over m pairs only has access to vecc[i], which is the sum of a_x + a_y. But to check the parity of the degrees of x and y in the pair, the code needs to know their degrees. But in the code's current setup, when processing each pair, it's stored vecc[i] and added to the mass array (the degrees of x and y are incremented by 1). So the mass array holds the degrees of the nodes. But for each pair in the loop over m pairs, the code doesn't have x and y stored. So how can we check the degrees of x and y for each pair?\n\nAh, here's a problem. Because in the code's current setup, during the processing of the pairs (in the for loop for i < m), x and y are read, and vecc[i] is set to a_x + a_y. Also, the mass array is updated for x-1 and y-1. But after that, the code does not store x and y for each pair. So during the else block, when m is odd, the code loops through all pairs again (i from 0 to m-1), but it doesn't have x and y for each pair. Therefore, the code cannot check the degrees of x and y in each pair. Thus, the code in its current form cannot properly check whether a pair has degrees of the same parity.\n\nThis is a problem. Because in the code's current setup, the loop over the pairs cannot check the parity of their degrees.\n\nSo this implies that the code is incorrect. The missing code in the first loop is tracking the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees. Then, the code's current loop over pairs is considering all pairs, which is wrong. Because some pairs may not have the same parity in degrees, leading to invalid options.\n\nTherefore, the code's approach is flawed. The solution requires that during processing of each pair, in addition to storing the sum a_x + a_y, we also need to store the x and y indices (or their degrees' parity) so that during the else block, we can check if their degrees have the same parity.\n\nBut the current code does not store x and y for the pairs. So how to fix this?\n\nIn the code, when reading the pairs, we need to store x and y, not just their sum. But in the existing code, for each pair, the code reads x and y, adds their sum to vecc[i], and increments the mass for x-1 and y-1. However, the code doesn't save x and y for each pair. So to fix this, we need to store the pairs.\n\nSo the code should, for each pair, store x and y (the original indices), in addition to vecc[i]. Then, during the else block, when processing the pairs, we can retrieve x and y, check their degrees (mass[x-1] and mass[y-1]), and see if the sum is even.\n\nSo the code's data structures need to be adjusted. The current code has:\n\nvector<int> vecc(m);\n\nBut vecc is being filled with a_x + a_y. However, the code doesn't store the x and y for each pair. So we need to modify this. For example, store a vector of pairs (x, y) in addition to vecc.\n\nBut in the code provided, the code reads x and y, and then does:\n\nvecc[i] = vec[x-1] + vec[y-1];\nmass[x-1] += 1, mass[y-1] += 1;\n\nSo during this loop, the code could also save x and y in another vector, say, 'pairs', which is a vector of pairs (or two separate vectors for x and y). Then, during the else block, when m is odd, the code can loop through the pairs and check for each (x, y) whether (mass[x-1] + mass[y-1]) % 2 == 0.\n\nSo the code needs to store the x and y of each pair. But in the current code, this is not done. So the code has a bug here.\n\nBut the code provided in the problem is missing some parts, and the user is to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code is structured in such a way that even with this mistake, the user can fill in the missing parts to make it work.\n\nWait, let's look at the code again. The code in the else block:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n{\n    if (mass[i] % 2 == 1)\n    {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\nfor (i = 0; i < m; ++i)\n{\n    st = min(st, vecc[i]);\n}\n\nSo the code's first loop is checking for nodes with odd degrees. The missing code here is to track the minimal a_i (vec[i]) for such nodes.\n\nThen, in the loop over m pairs, it's comparing st with vecc[i], which is a_x + a_y for each pair, regardless of their degrees' parity. This is incorrect. So the code's current approach is to consider all pairs as possible candidates for the second option (excluding both x and y, which would cost a_x + a_y), but this is only valid if their degrees have the same parity.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect. But how can this be fixed?\n\nThe problem is that the code's current structure doesn't store x and y for each pair, so during the else block, when checking pairs, it can't check their degrees' parity.\n\nBut given that the code provided is incomplete and the user has to fill in the missing code, perhaps the code is intended to be modified such that during the first loop (over nodes with odd degrees), the minimal a_i is tracked, and during the second loop (over pairs), the minimal a_x + a_y is tracked, but only for pairs where the sum of their degrees is even.\n\nBut since the code doesn't have access to x and y for each pair, this is not possible.\n\nSo perhaps the code has a mistake here, and the correct solution requires storing x and y for each pair. But the code provided doesn't do that, so the user must find a way to adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is different. Let's think again.\n\nWait, in the code, during the processing of the pairs (when m is odd), the code has a loop over all pairs, and for each pair, it adds to vecc[i] the sum of a_x + a_y. Then, in the else block, when m is odd, the code's second loop is over all pairs, and for each, compares st to vecc[i]. So the code is considering the sum a_x + a_y for all pairs, which would imply that the code is assuming that excluding both x and y would reduce the number of cakes by an odd number. But this is only true if the sum of their degrees (dx + dy) is even, which is not guaranteed.\n\nSo the code's current approach in the else block is incorrect. But the user is to fill in the missing code in the first loop (nodes with odd degrees).\n\nThe code's first loop (nodes with odd degrees) is supposed to track the minimal a_i. So in the missing code, we should do something like:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nBecause for each node i with odd degree, excluding it would cost a_i. Then, the code's second loop loops over all pairs and finds the minimal a_x + a_y. But the code's current approach is to take the minimum between the two options (the minimal a_i and the minimal a_x + a_y for any pair). However, the pair option is only valid if their degrees' sum is even. So the code's current approach is incorrect.\n\nBut the code passes some test cases. For example, in the second test case:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n3 1\n\n3 5 4\n\n1 2\n\nSample Output: 2.\n\nWait, the code for this case would have m = 1 (odd). So the code would process nodes with odd degrees. Let's see:\n\nmass[x-1] and mass[y-1] are incremented for each pair. So in this case, the pair is (1,2). So mass[0] becomes 1, mass[1] becomes 1.\n\nSo during the loop over nodes, for i=0 (mass[0] =1, odd), code would check. The missing code should track the minimal a_i. So vec[0] is 3, vec[1] is 5, vec[2] is4.\n\nSo the nodes with odd degrees are 0 and 1. Their a_i are 3 and 5. So the minimal is 3.\n\nThen, the code's second loop iterates through the one pair, with vecc[i] = 3+5=8. So st is min(3, 8) =3. But the sample's correct answer is 2. So the code would output 3, which is wrong.\n\nBut sample's correct answer is obtained by inviting members 2 and 3, leading to uninvited member 1 (a_i=3) and 0 cakes (even). So the sum is 3. But the sample says the correct answer is 2. Wait, perhaps I'm confused.\n\nWait the sample input 2's second test case:\n\nInput:\n\n3 1\n\n3 5 4\n\n1 2.\n\nSo m=1. So when m is odd, the code computes the minimal between a_i's for nodes with odd degrees and the sum of pairs.\n\nIn this case, the nodes 1 and 2 (original numbers) are friends. So their degrees are 1 each (since there's only one pair). So nodes 0 (a=3) and 1 (a=5) have odd degrees. The code's first loop would track the minimal a_i between 3 and 5, which is 3. Then, the code's second loop looks at the pair (1,2) which has a sum of 3+5=8. So st is min(3,8) =3. But according to the sample, the correct answer is 2.\n\nWait, this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. Because the correct answer is obtained by excluding member 1 and 2. But how?\n\nWait, no. The sample says that inviting 2 and 3 gives uninvited member 1 (a=5), but according to the input, a_1 is 3, a_2 is5, a_3 is4. So uninvited member 1 has a_i=3, and uninvited member 3 is invited? No, wait, no. If you invite 2 and 3, then the uninvited members are 1. So their sum is 3. But the sample says the answer is 2.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck the sample description.\n\nIn the note for the second test case:\n\nThe minimum unhappiness is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The unhappiness is a_1=3 + a_2 and 3 are invited. Wait, no. The uninvited members are those not invited. So if 2 and 3 are invited, the uninvited members are 1, so the sum is a_1=3. But the sample says the answer is 2. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input. Let me recheck:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n3 1\n\n3 5 4\n\n1 2.\n\nSo the first test case is probably another case, and the second test case is this one.\n\nWait, the sample note says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible:\n\ninvite 1 and 2: 0 cakes (since the pair is invited, but the code says m=1, so if both are invited, then cakes=1, which is odd. So why is the cake count zero? Ah, perhaps the sample's input is different. Wait, the sample note says that in the second test case, the club's oven requires even cakes. So the m is 1, which is odd. So the code would not output zero. So the correct answer is to have cakes even. So when m is 1, you need to adjust. So in the sample, the correct answer is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, leading to no cakes (since the pair (1,2) is not invited). So uninvited members are 1, so sum is 3.\n\nBut sample says the answer is 2, which is not matching. So perhaps the sample input is different. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nAh, the problem statement's note says:\n\nIn the second test case, the options include invite 2 and 3. The cakes eaten are zero, so the sum of uninvited a_i is 1 (a_1=3) plus 0 if others are invited. Wait, no. If they are invited, the uninvited members are 1. So sum is 3. But the sample says the answer is 2. Hmm, this suggests that the sample input is different. Perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case's input is:\n\nn=3, m=1\n\na = [3, 5, 2]\n\npairs (1,2). Then the correct answer would be 2, by inviting 3, which sum is 3+5=8 uninvited, but that's not right. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me refer back to the sample note.\n\nThe sample note for the second test case says: The minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. This gives 0 cakes (because the pair (1,2) is not invited (since 1 is not invited). So the number of cakes is 0 (even). The uninvited members are 1, so the sum is a_1=3. But the sample says the answer is 2. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, perhaps the sample input for the second test case is different. For example:\n\nMaybe the a array is [2,5,3], and the pair is (1,3). Then, inviting 2 and 3 would not include the pair (1,3), so cakes=0. Uninvited members are 1, sum is 2. Which would explain the sample output of 2.\n\nBut this suggests that the code's current approach is incorrect for that case.\n\nSo the code's approach when m is odd is to take the minimal between the minimal a_i (among nodes with odd degrees) and the minimal a_x + a_y (among all pairs). But in the sample where the correct answer is 2, this suggests that there's a pair (x,y) where a_x + a_y is 2, and their degrees' sum is even.\n\nBut according to the code's current approach, the code would check all pairs. So in the sample case where the pair's sum is 2, the code would take that as the minimal and output 2.\n\nBut how does that happen if the code's current approach doesn't check the parity of the degrees for the pair?\n\nSo the code's current approach is incorrect. But the sample's answer is achieved by including a pair where their sum is 2, and their degrees sum to even.\n\nSo the code's current approach would have to include such a pair, but the code's current loop over pairs doesn't check the degrees' parity, leading to an incorrect result.\n\nSo, the code is missing the check for the degrees' parity when processing the pairs.\n\nBut how to fix this given the current code structure?\n\nThe problem is that the code does not have access to the x and y of each pair during the else block. So the code's current approach is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct code should:\n\n1. For each node with odd degree, track the minimal a_i.\n\n2. For each pair (x,y), track the minimal a_x + a_y where (mass[x] + mass[y]) is even.\n\nBut the code's current setup does not allow for this, since x and y are not stored.\n\nSo the code needs to be modified to store the pairs' x and y.\n\nBut in the code provided, there's no storage of x and y for the pairs. So the code's current setup is flawed.\n\nThus, the code provided is incorrect, and the user must fix it.\n\nBut since the user is to fill in the missing code, perhaps the code's missing part is the first loop (nodes with odd degrees) and the code's second loop is intended to process pairs where the sum of degrees is even.\n\nBut without knowing x and y for each pair, the code can't do this.\n\nSo the code's current approach is incorrect, and the missing code is to process the pairs correctly.\n\nBut given that the code provided has a mistake, but the user is to fill in the missing code (the TODO part), perhaps the code's original author intended to track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees and the minimal a_x + a_y for pairs where the sum of degrees is even, but the code's current structure doesn't allow for this.\n\nBut given that the code provided is missing the part where nodes with odd degrees are considered, perhaps the correct code is to first track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees, and then track the minimal a_x + a_y for pairs where x and y have degrees of the same parity.\n\nBut since the code can't check the parity of x and y's degrees for each pair (because x and y are not stored), this is impossible.\n\nThus, the code provided has a flaw. Therefore, the user must adjust the code.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's author made a mistake and the correct approach is to consider pairs where x and y are friends, and their sum of a_i's is the minimal. And the code's current approach is to consider all pairs, but that's incorrect.\n\nBut given that the code's code is to be filled in, perhaps the correct answer is to fill in the TODO part with:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThis would track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\nThen, in the loop over pairs, the code considers all pairs. But this is incorrect. However, perhaps in some cases, the minimal a_x + a_y pair happens to have even sum of degrees. So in the sample test case 2, perhaps the minimal a_x + a_y is not 3+5=8, but the code's second loop would not find a better option. So why is the sample's answer 2?\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, and the correct solution requires considering another scenario.\n\nAnother approach to the problem is as follows:\n\nWhen m is odd, the optimal solution is to either:\n\n1. Exclude a single node with odd degree (cost a_i), leading to even C.\n\nOR\n\n2. Exclude two nodes x and y that are friends (cost a_x + a_y), leading to the number of cakes being reduced by an odd number (so even).\n\nThe second option is valid only if the pair (x,y) is present. So in this case, the code needs to find the minimal a_x + a_y among all pairs of friends.\n\nSo the minimal between option 1 and option 2 is the answer.\n\nAh! This would explain the sample input 2. Let's re-examine it.\n\nIn sample input 2:\n\nm=1 (odd).\n\nThe code's first option is to find a node with odd degree. The nodes are 1 and 2 (original indices 1 and 2). Their a_i are 5 and 4. So the minimal a_i is 4 (node 3's a_i is 4, but wait, original indices are 1-based? Or is it 0-based? Let's clarify.\n\nThe code's code reads a_1, a_2, a_3 as per the input. For the second test case, the a array is 3,5,4. So members 1, 2, 3 have a_i 3,5,4 respectively. The pair is (1,2). So in the code:\n\nmass[0] and mass[1] are incremented by 1. So nodes 0 and 1 (original members 1 and 2) have degrees 1 each. So in the loop over nodes, i=0 and i=1 are considered (mass[i] is odd). Their a_i are 3 and 5. So the minimal is 3. Then, the loop over pairs (there's one pair) has a sum of 3+5=8. So the code's answer is min(3,8) =3. But according to the sample's note, the correct answer is 2. This suggests that the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut according to the sample's note, the correct answer is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which leaves out 1. The uninvited sum is 3. But the sample says the answer is 2. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the sample note says that in the second test case, the answer is 2. But according to the input provided in the note, the a array must be different. For example, perhaps the a array is [4,5,3], leading to sum 4 (uninvited) when inviting 2 and 3. But then, the code's approach would still not work.\n\nSo I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the unhappiness value is the sum of a_i for members not invited. So the minimal possible sum.\n\nIn the sample's second test case, the answer is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, leaving 1 uninvited (a_i=3). But that's sum 3. So why is the answer 2?\n\nThis suggests that I must have misunderstood the sample input. Let me recheck the problem's sample note:\n\nThe sample note for the second test case says:\n\nThe following options are possible:\n\n- invite 2 and 3 (uninvited 1), cakes 0. Unhappiness is 3.\n\nBut the note says that the minimum is achieved by this option. So the sample output is 2. This suggests that the a_i for 3 is 2. So the a array must be different.\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nn=3, m=1\n\na = [3,5,2]\n\npair (1,2)\n\nThen, inviting 2 and 3 would have uninvited member 1 (a=3), but also member 3 is invited. So uninvited sum is 3. But if the a array is [2,5,3], then the sum would be 2.\n\nBut the sample note says the answer is 2. So the a array must have a_3=2.\n\nSo perhaps the input for the second test case is:\n\na = [2,5,3].\n\nIn this case, the code would process as follows:\n\nm is 1 (odd).\n\nNodes 0 and 1 have degrees 1 each (mass[i] is 1).\n\nLoop over nodes with odd degrees: minimal a_i is 2 (node 0's a_i is 2). Then, loop over pairs (1,2) in the pair, a_x + a_y is 2+5=7. So st is min(2,7) =2. So the code's answer is 2, which matches the sample's output.\n\nAh! So the code's approach would work if the a array is such that the minimal a_i for a node with odd degree is the correct answer.\n\nBut why would the code's current approach (considering all pairs, even those with sum of degrees of different parity) work in some cases?\n\nBecause in the code's current approach, when processing all pairs, it's possible that some pairs have x and y with degrees of the same parity, thus being valid options. But the code doesn't check for this, leading to incorrect results in some cases.\n\nBut in the sample where the minimal a_i is the answer, the code would output the correct value.\n\nSo, the code's current approach is to take the minimal between the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees and the minimal a_x + a_y for all pairs. But this is incorrect because some pairs are invalid (their exclusion doesn't change the parity correctly).\n\nBut in some cases, the minimal a_x + a_y happens to be from a pair with even sum of degrees, so the code would work.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect, but the problem requires that the user fills in the missing code. So perhaps the code's missing part is to track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees, and the code's loop over pairs is incorrect, but the user is to fill in the correct code.\n\nBut given the code's structure, the user can only fill in the missing code in the first loop (the TODO part).\n\nSo the correct code for the first loop is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThis would track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\nThen, in the second loop, the code should check for pairs where x and y have degrees of the same parity and track the minimal a_x + a_y. But the code's current code does not do this. So the code would have to be modified to do so.\n\nBut the code provided has the second loop as:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < m; ++i)\n{\n    st = min(st, vecc[i]);\n}\n\nWhich adds the pair's a_x + a_y to the possible options, but without checking the degrees' parity.\n\nThis is incorrect, but given that the code is to be filled in by the user, and the user can only modify the TODO part, perhaps the code's second loop is intended to have a different condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to consider both possibilities (excluding a node with odd degree or excluding a pair of friends), but in reality, the second option is only valid if the pair's degrees are even. But the code's current approach is to assume that all pairs are valid, which is not correct.\n\nSo the code's answer would be the minimum between the two options, but this is incorrect. However, in some test cases, this approach might give the correct answer.\n\nBut the sample case where the pair's sum is minimal but has invalid degrees would lead to the code outputting an incorrect value.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect. But the user is to fill in the missing code.\n\nThe missing code is in the first loop, where the code should track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\nSo the code's TODO part is to write:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThis would track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees.\n\nThen, the code's second loop considers all pairs, adding their a_x + a_y to st. But since this may include invalid pairs, the code's answer could be wrong.\n\nBut given the code's structure, this is what the author intended.\n\nSo the correct answer to the programming problem requires considering two options:\n\n1. Exclude a node with odd degree (cost a_i).\n\n2. Exclude a pair of friends (cost a_x + a_y), which must have their degrees' sum even.\n\nBut the code's current approach does not check for the second condition. So the code is incorrect.\n\nBut since the user can only fill in the missing code, the code's answer would be:\n\nIn the first loop, track the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees. Then, in the second loop, track the minimal a_x + a_y for all pairs (even if invalid). The code's answer is the minimal of these two values.\n\nBut this approach would not work for all cases, but it's what the code's structure requires.\n\nBut according to the sample note's second test case, the code's approach would output 2 if the a array is [2,5,3], and the pair's a_x + a_y is 7, but the minimal a_i is 2. So the code's answer would be 2.\n\nBut in other cases, it may fail.\n\nBut given the code provided, the missing code is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nSo the user should fill this in.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);"
