The divisions are divided as follows:\n- Division 1: rating >= 1900\n- Division 2: between 1600 and 1899 inclusive\n- Division 3: between 1400 and 1599 inclusive\n- Division 4: <= 1399 So for each test case, I need to check the rating and print the corresponding division. The input is t test cases, each with a rating. The output is \"Division X\" for each. Let me think about how to structure the conditions. Since the divisions are ordered from highest to lowest, I should check the highest conditions first. Because if the rating is 1900 or above, it's division 1. Otherwise, check if it's in division 2, etc. Wait, the order is important here. Let's see:\n\nIf I check division 1 first, then division 2, etc. That makes sense.",

            "text": "Because once a condition is met, we can output and break. So the logic inside each test case would be:\n\nRead the rating. If rating >= 1900: division 1.\n\nElse if rating >=1600 and <=1899: division 2. Wait, but since we already checked that it's not >=1900, the else if can just check if it's >=1600, because anything above 1600 but not >=1900 is division 2. Wait no. Because if the rating is 1600 to 1899 inclusive, that's division 2. So for example, if the rating is 1600, then after the first condition (>=1900) is false, we check if it's >=1600. But that's true, but what's the upper limit? Because the first condition already excluded ratings >=1900, so the else if can just check if the rating is >=1600. Because any rating that's >=1600 here would automatically be <=1899, since if it was >=1900, the first condition would have been hit. Wait, yes. Because in the first condition, we check if the rating is >=1900. So the else if is only entered when the rating is <1900. So in that case, if the rating is >=1600, then it's division 2. Because 1600 <= rating <= 1899 is covered by that. Similarly for division 3: after checking the first two conditions, if the rating is >=1400, then division 3. Because if it's >=1400 and not in division 1 or 2, then it's division 3. Otherwise, division 4. So the conditions can be structured as:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) \u2192 division 1\n\nelse if (rating >= 1600) \u2192 division 2\n\nelse if (rating >= 1400) \u2192 division 3\n\nelse \u2192 division 4 Yes, that should work. Because the order of checking ensures that higher divisions are checked first. So for example, if someone is in division 2 (1600-1899), the first condition is false, then the else if (>=1600) is true, so division 2 is output. So how to code this in C++. Inside the while loop for each test case:\n\nRead the rating as a long long (since the code uses ll for that variable). Wait, the problem says the rating can be as low as -5000. But since the divisions are based on ranges that start at 1400 and lower, but division 4 is all ratings <=1399. So even negative ratings are division 4. So the code would be:\n\nRead the rating (as ll, since the code uses ll for variables). Then:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n}\nelse if (rating >= 1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n}\nelse if (rating >=1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n}\nelse {\n    cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n} Yes, that should handle all cases. Now, in the code given, the main function reads t, then loops t times. The missing code is inside the while(t--) loop. So the missing part is reading the rating and the if-else chain. So the code to insert is:\n\nll rating;\ncin >> rating;\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n}\nelse if (rating >= 1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n}\nelse if (rating >= 1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n}\nelse {\n    cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n} Yes. Now, the variables are declared as ll, so that's okay. Testing the sample inputs:\n\nTest case 1-4: -789, 1299, 1300, 1399: all <=1399 \u2192 division 4.\n\nTest 5: 1400 \u2192 division 3.\n\nTest 6: 1679 \u2192 division 2.\n\nTest7: 2300 \u2192 division 1. Which matches the notes. So this code should work.",
