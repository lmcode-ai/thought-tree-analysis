So the sum of all the blocks' lengths must be exactly s\u00b2, but also, each row can be formed by some combination of blocks whose lengths add up to s. But maybe this is complicating things. Because the problem allows not using all blocks, so maybe the maximum s is the largest integer where the total sum of all block lengths is >= s\u00b2. Because even if the sum is more than s\u00b2, perhaps you can select a subset that sums to exactly s\u00b2. For example, if sum is 10, maybe the maximum s is 3 since 3\u00b2=9 <=10. But then you have to check whether the sum is >= s squared. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that sum of lengths >= s\u00b2. But then the answer is floor(sqrt(sum)) where sum is the total sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n. Wait, but we can choose any subset of the blocks. So the sum of the subset is the sum of the lengths, and we need that sum >= s\u00b2. The maximum s is the largest integer s where sum >= s\u00b2, but sum here is the sum of the subset.

Because if the sum is sufficient, then there's a way to arrange the blocks into s rows of s each. Wait, but how? For example, suppose sum is s\u00b2. Then each row needs to sum to s. So the problem is similar to partitioning the blocks into s groups (each group is a row), each group's sum is >= s. But since the total sum is s\u00b2, each group must sum exactly s. So the question is: can the sum of the blocks' lengths be arranged into s groups each of sum exactly s? But this depends on the individual block lengths.",

So the problem now is to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nLet's find a formula for this sum. For i from 1 to n, ceil(i/2) can be written as (i +1 )//2. So let's compute sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's split into even and odd terms. If n is even, say n=2k. Then:\n\ni=1: (1+1)/2 =1\n\ni=2: (2)/2=1\n\ni=3: (3+1)/2=2\n\ni=4:4/2=2\n\n... and so on. So for each pair (2m-1, 2m), their sum is m + m = 2m. So for even n=2k, the sum is sum_{m=1 to k} 2m = 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) =k(k+1). But wait, for n=2k, the sum is 1+1 + 2+2 + ... +k +k? Wait no. Let's see:\n\nWhen i is odd (1,3,5,...), ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. When i is even, ceil(i/2)=i/2. So for i=1 and 2: sum is 1+1=2.\n\ni=3 and 4: sum is 2+2=4.\n\ni=5 and 6: sum is 3+3=6. So for each pair (2m-1, 2m), the sum is m + m = 2m. The number of pairs is k for n=2k. So sum for even n=2k is sum_{m=1 to k} 2m = 2*(k*(k+1)/2) ) =k*(k+1). For example, n=2 (k=1): sum is 1+1=2=1*2.\n\nn=4 (k=2): 1+1+2+2=6=2*3. Yes. If n is odd, say n=2k+1. Then for the first 2k terms, the sum is k*(k+1), as above. Then add the (2k+1)th term, which is (2k+1 +1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 = k+1. So total sum is k*(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) ) = (k+1)^2. For example, n=3 (k=1): sum is 1+1+2=4= (1+1)^2. n=5 (k=2): sum of first 4 terms is 2*3=6, then add 3: total 9=3\u00b2. Which matches the sample. So the formula for sum is:\n\nif n is even (n=2k), sum = k*(k+1)\n\nif n is odd (n=2k+1), sum = (k+1)^2\n\nSo now we can compute the sum quickly for any n.\n\nThen, the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of sum. But wait, the sum is S. So the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= S. So s = floor(sqrt(S)). But how to compute this efficiently. For example, in the sample input where n=5, sum is 9, sqrt(9)=3, so s=3. Another sample: n=2, sum is 2, sqrt is ~1.414, so s=1. But according to the first sample in the problem statement, when n=1, sum is 1. s=1. Correct. So the steps are: For each test case:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\n2. Compute s = floor(sqrt(S)). Output s. So the problem now is to compute S for given n quickly, even when n is up to 1e9. Let's code this. The formula for S can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nk = n / 2\n\nsum = k * (k + 1)\n\nelse: k = (n - 1)/2\n\nsum = (k + 1) * (k + 1) So sum can be computed in O(1) time. Then compute s as the integer square root of sum. But how to compute integer square root in C++?\n\nWe can use sqrt(sum), but for very large numbers (sum can be up to (5e8 +1)^2 when n is 1e9), which is 1e17, so using sqrt might have precision issues. So better to compute using binary search. Alternatively, in C++, using sqrtl and checking. But for the purposes of code submission, perhaps using the formula. Let's think: when sum is up to ( (1e9 +1)/2 )^2 when n is odd. For n=1e9, if it's even, sum is (5e8) * (5e8 +1) = 5e8 * 5e8 + 5e8 = 2.5e17 +5e8. The square root of this sum would be sqrt(5e8*(5e8 +1)) \u2248 5e8 + 0.5, but since we need the floor, it's 5e8. But perhaps for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). So the square root of that sum is sqrt(k^2 +k) \u2248 k + 0.5*(1/(k)) etc. So the integer part is k.\n\nWait, let's see. For even n=2k, sum is k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. The square of (k+0.5) is k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So sum is k\u00b2 +k. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is less than (k+0.5). Therefore, the integer part is k.\n\nWait, let's take an example. k=1: sum=1*2=2. sqrt(2)=1.414 \u2192 floor is 1. Which is k.\n\nk=2: sum=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is k.\n\nk=3: sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3. So for even n, s =k. But sum is k*(k+1). So s = floor(sqrt(k*(k+1))). But k*(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k*(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor is k. So for even n, sum is k*(k+1), s=k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. Then sqrt is exactly k+1. So s =k+1. So in this case, the maximum s is:\n\nif n is even: s = k (where k =n/2), but wait wait, sum is k*(k+1). So the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) is k. Because k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k < (k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So sqrt(k*(k+1)) < k+0.5, so floor is k. But when n is odd, sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1. Wait, but when n is even, sum is k(k+1). So s= floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ) =k. But the sample input when n=5 is odd. Then sum is 3\u00b2=9, s=3. So for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ), which is k. For example, when k=3, sum=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so floor is 3. Which is equal to k. So for even n, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k*(k+1)) ) which is k.\n\nBut wait, in that case, for even n, s= k. Because sum is k*(k+1) which is s\u00b2 =k\u00b2 +k. So the maximum s is k. But wait, if s is k, then s\u00b2= k\u00b2. But sum is k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k >=k\u00b2. So s can be k. But what if sum is larger than k\u00b2, but the next integer is k+1, whose square is (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. But sum is k\u00b2 +k, which is less than (k+1)^2. So s can't be k+1. So for even n, the maximum s is k. For example, n=4 (even, k=2). sum=2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.449. floor is 2. So s=2. But the sum is 6, which is 2.449^2, but s=2. So 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes, maximum is 2. But wait, sum is 6. So 6 >= 2\u00b2, 6 >=3\u00b2 is false. So s=2. But according to the problem's sample where n=5 (sum 9), s=3. So that's correct. So the conclusion is:\n\nThe maximum s can be computed as:\n\nif n is even, s = k (n=2k)\n\nif n is odd, s =k+1 (n=2k+1) Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\nsum is k(k+1). Then s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)). But when is k(k+1) >= s\u00b2? Wait, let's take n=2k=4, k=2. sum=6. s=2. 6 >=2\u00b2=4, but 6 <3\u00b2=9. So yes. But wait, for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1), which is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So floor of sqrt(k(k+1)) is k. So in this case, s is k. So for even n, s= k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. So s=k+1. But wait, what about when n is even, but the sum is k(k+1), which is larger than k\u00b2. So s is k. So the formula for s is:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( (n/2) * (n/2 +1) ) ) But as we saw, this is equal to n/2. Wait, let's test with n=4. n/2=2. sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.45, floor is 2. Which is n/2=2.\n\nn=6: sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. Which is 3=6/2=3. So for even n, s is n/2. But wait, let's check for n=2k even, sum is k(k+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ). But is that equal to k?\n\nYes. Because sqrt(k(k+1)) = sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) < sqrt(k\u00b2 +k + 0.25) =k+0.5. So floor is k. So for even n, s is k, which is n/2. For odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. So s is k+1. So combining these two cases:\n\ns = (k+1) when n is odd (n=2k+1)\n\ns =k when n is even (n=2k)\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nn=1 (odd, k=0): sum is (0+1)^2=1. s=1. n=3 (k=1): sum is (1+1)^2=4 \u2192 s=2. n=5 (k=2): sum=3\u00b2=9 \u2192 s=3. Yes. So s for even n is k =n/2. s for odd n is k+1 = (n+1)/2. So the formula for s is:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = n/2 \u2192 but wait, that can't be right. For example, n=4 (even), sum=6, s=2. But sqrt(6) is ~2.45, but the maximum s is 2. But according to this formula, s=4/2=2. Which is correct. Another example: n=6 even. sum=3*4=12. s=3. sqrt(12) is 3.464, so s=3. Which is 6/2=3. So yes. So for even n, s= n/2. Wait wait, wait. Wait for n=2k even:\n\nsum =k(k+1). s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)). Which is k.\n\nBut k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is less than k+0.5. So the floor is k. So yes, s= k.\n\nBut k is n/2. So for even n, s =n/2. For odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2. s= k+1 = (n+1)/2. So the formula for s is:\n\ns = (n +1)/2 when n is odd.\n\ns = n/2 when n is even. Wait, but wait. Let's take n=5 (odd). (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=3 \u2192 (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1. Correct. So the formula for s is:\n\nif n is even: s = n/2. if n is odd: s = (n+1)/2. Wait, but what about sum?\n\nWait for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). Then s= k. But according to the formula s= k, which is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)). But for example, when k=3, sum is 3*4=12. s=3. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor is 3. So correct. But according to the formula, when n is even, s is n/2 =k. So yes. But for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1) which is equal to k^2 +k. The maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= sum. s squared is k^2 +k >= s^2. For s=k, s\u00b2= k\u00b2 <= sum (k\u00b2 +k) \u2192 yes. For s=k+1, s\u00b2= (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. Which is larger than sum (k\u00b2 +k). So no. So yes, s=k. So the formula holds. So the problem can be solved by: For a given n:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = n/2. if n is odd:\n\ns = (n+1)/2. But wait, this can't be right. Because in the case when sum is (k+1)^2 (for n odd), the s is (k+1). For example, n=5 (k=2), sum=9, s=3. But according to the formula, (n+1)/2= (5+1)/2=3. Correct. But wait, what about sum for even n? For example, n=4 even. sum=2*3=6. s=2. Which is floor(sqrt(6))=2. But according to the formula, s=4/2=2. Correct. But wait, this seems to work. So the formula for s is:\n\ns = floor( (n+1)/2 ) ? Wait, for n even: (n+1)/2 is (2k +1)/2= k + 0.5 \u2192 floor is k. Which is equal to n/2. For even n, yes. For odd n: (n+1)/2= (2k+1 +1)/2= k+1. So the formula can be written as s = (n+1) // 2. Wait, but (n+1) divided by 2. For example, n=4 even: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor is 2. Which is 4//2=2. n=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 3. So yes. Wait, but (n+1)//2 is equal to (n//2) + (n mod 2). So for even n, n//2 =k, mod 0. So (n+1)//2 =k +0. So for even n, (n+1)//2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 2k+1 is 2k+1, divided by 2. For example, n=4 (even), (4+1)//2=5//2=2. Which is the same as 4//2=2. n=5 (odd) \u2192 (5+1)//2=6//2=3. So the formula for s is (n+1) // 2. Wait, but this would imply that s is (n+1)/2 rounded down. Which for even n is n/2, for odd n is (n+1)/2. So according to this formula, s is (n+1)//2. But wait, let's test this. Sample input 1: n=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1. Correct. Sample input 2: n=5 \u21923. Correct. Another test case: n=4 \u2192 s=2. Which is correct. But wait, what about when n=2. sum is 2. s=1. (n+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor is 1. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 sum=4 \u2192 s=2. Correct. So this formula holds. But wait, why? Because for even n=2k:\n\nsum is k(k+1). s =k.\n\nWhich is (n+1)/2= (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5 \u2192 floor is k.\n\nWhich is equal to k= n/2. For odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2. s= k+1 = (n+1)/2. So the formula s= (n+1)//2 gives the correct answer. But this seems to ignore the sum. How can this be?",

But according to the formula, s is (n+1)//2, which is k.\n\nWait, so the conclusion is that the maximum s is (n+1)//2. But how? For example, n=6 even. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor 3. Which is (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3. Correct. Yes, but according to the formula, (n+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3, which is correct. But for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). s= k.\n\nBut according to the formula, s is (2k+1)//2= k. So yes. But how can this be? Because the sum is k(k+1), which is k\u00b2 +k. The maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <=k(k+1). But k\u00b2 +k is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So the floor of sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is k.\n\nWhich is exactly (n+1)//2, since n=2k, (2k+1)//2= k. So this formula works. So the answer for each test case is (n+1)//2. But wait, that can't be right. Because there's a problem here. Let's take n=7 (odd). n=7: sum is (7+1)/2=4 \u2192 (k+1)^2 where k=3. sum=4\u00b2=16. So s=4. Which is correct. Another example: n=6 even. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is (6+1)//2=3.5 \u21923. But sqrt(12) is 3.464, floor is 3. So correct. Another example: n=8 even. sum is4*5=20. s=4. sqrt(20)=4.472, floor is4. Which is (8+1)//2=4.5 \u21924. Correct. n=9 odd: sum is (4+1)^2=25. s=5. Correct. So the formula s= (n+1)//2 gives the correct answer. But why? Because for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1), and the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)) is k. So s=k= (n)/2. But (n+1)//2 is (2k+1)//2 =k. Yes, for example, (2k+1) divided by 2 is k with remainder 1. So integer division gives k. So (n+1)//2= k.\n\nWhich is the same as (n//2) + (n mod 2) ? Let's see. For even n: n mod 2 is 0. So (n//2) +0 =k.\n\nFor odd n: n//2 =k, mod 1. So (k) +1= k+1. So the formula (n+1)//2 is equivalent to (n//2) + (n mod 2). But how does this formula for s= (n+1)//2 come from? Because for even n=2k:\n\nsum is k(k+1). So s is floor(sqrt(k(k+1))) =k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2. So s= k+1.\n\nWhich is exactly (2k+1 +1)/2= k+1. So the formula works. So the code can be written as: for each n, output (n+1)//2. But wait, let's test this. Sample input 1: n=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 correct. Sample input 2: n=5 \u21923 \u2192 correct. Another example: n=4 \u21922 \u2192 correct. n=7\u21924. sum is 16. sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 correct. So this formula seems to work. But why is this possible? Because the sum for even n is k(k+1), which is sufficient to get s=k. For odd n, sum is (k+1)^2, which allows s=k+1. So the code is simply:\n\nfor each test case, read n, output (n+1)//2. But why does this work? Because the sum is k(k+1) for even n, which allows s=k. But why is k(k+1) > =k\u00b2 ? Yes, k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k >=k\u00b2. So s can be at least k. But (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. sum=k(k+1) is less than (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k. But how?\n\nBecause sum is k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. We need s\u00b2 <= sum. So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) ), which is k. So the formula holds. So the code is simply to compute (n+1)//2. But wait, why does the sum matter? Because if the sum is k(k+1), the maximum s is floor(sqrt(k(k+1))) =k. But according to the formula, s is (n+1)//2 =k. Which matches. Thus, the code can be written as: For each test case, read n, compute (n+1)/2 (integer division), and output that. But wait, let me check the sample input where n=5:\n\n(n+1)//2=3, which is correct. Another test case: n=2. sum is 2. s=1. (2+1)//2=1.5 \u21921. Yes. n=3: (3+1)//2=2. sum is4 \u2192 s=2. Correct. n=6:3. sum 12. s=3. Correct. But wait, what about n=7. sum is (7+1)/2=4 \u21924^2=16. So s=4. Correct. But if n=1e9, which is even. (1e9+1)//2 =5e8 + 0.5? No. Wait, n=1e9 is even. (1e9+1) is 1e9+1. Divided by 2 is 5e8 + 0.5. But integer division in C++ truncates towards zero. So 1e9+1 is 1000000001. Divided by 2 is 500,000,000.5. So integer division gives 500,000,000. But n=1e9 is even. So (n+1)//2 is 500,000,000.5 \u2192 integer division gives 500,000,000. Which is correct because sum is 5e8*(5e8+1) \u2192 s=5e8. Yes. So the code can be written as follows:\n\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        long long n;\n        cin >> n;\n        cout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl;\n    }\n} Wait, but the original code was written in C++, and the variables should handle n up to 1e9, which is within the range of 32-bit integers. But when computing (n+1) /2, for n=1e9, (n+1) is 1e9+1, which is 1,000,000,001. But if n is stored as a 32-bit int, this could overflow. So better to use long long. In the code provided by the user, the input is read into a variable. So in the code:\n\nint main() {\nint t; std::cin>>t;\nwhile(t--) {\n/* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n} So in the code, the variable for n must be a long long to prevent overflow when n is up to 1e9. But wait, 1e9 is within the range of a 32-bit integer (up to ~2e9). But when n is 1e9, (n+1) is 1e9 +1, which is 1000000001, which is also within 32-bit integer. So perhaps using int is okay, but for safety, better to use long long. So the correct code is: Read n as a long long. Compute (n +1)/2, using integer division. Output that. So the code would be:\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        long long n;\n        cin >> n;\n        cout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl;\n    }\n} Wait, but the sample input where n=5 gives (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Another sample where n=1 gives (1+1)/2=1. Another sample where n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 \u21921. Yes. So this code will solve the problem. But why does this formula work? Because the maximum s is (n+1)//2. But how does this relate to the sum?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n wooden blocks. Each block has a height of 1 unit and a length of ceil(i/2), where i is the block's number from 1 to n. We can use any subset of the blocks, and we can't rotate them, so they have to be placed with their original dimensions.\n\nHmm. The square's side length is determined by both the total area and the arrangement. But since all blocks are 1 unit high, the key is that the sum of the lengths of the blocks (since each contributes 1xL_i area) must be at least s^2, where s is the side length we want. Because the total area of the blocks used has to be at least s^2, and arranged in a way that forms an s x s square. But the blocks are 1 unit tall, so arranging them would require stacking them vertically. Wait, no. Because each block is 1 unit high, but length varies. So to form a square, the total area of the blocks used must be exactly s\u00b2, and they have to be arranged into s rows (since each row is s units long and 1 unit high). So each row contributes s units of area, so total s rows gives s\u00b2. So the sum of all the block lengths must be >= s\u00b2. But each row in the square must have exactly s units of length. So the sum of the blocks' lengths must be at least s\u00b2, but also the way to arrange them into s rows each of s length. Because each block is 1 unit high, each block can contribute to exactly one row. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where the sum of the blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2, and also, the sum can be divided into s rows (each row's sum of block lengths is >= s). Wait, maybe not. Because the sum of all block lengths is the total area. So the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that the sum of all the blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2. Because even if the sum is s\u00b2, you can arrange the blocks into s rows each of s length. But wait, maybe that's not possible. For example, if the sum is s\u00b2, but all the blocks are of length 1. Then to form s rows of s each, you need s rows each with s blocks. So sum of all blocks is s\u00b2. But if each row is s, then each row contributes s * 1 (since each block is 1 unit high, so each row is 1 unit high). Wait, no. Each row is made up of some blocks placed horizontally. Since each block is 1 unit high, a row is made by placing blocks side by side. The total length of the row is the sum of the lengths of the blocks in that row. So each row's total length needs to be at least s, but since we're forming a square of s x s, each row must exactly sum to s. So the sum of all the blocks' lengths must be exactly s\u00b2, but also, each row can be formed by some combination of blocks whose lengths add up to s. But maybe this is complicating things. Because the problem allows not using all blocks, so maybe the maximum s is the largest integer where the total sum of all block lengths is >= s\u00b2. Because even if the sum is more than s\u00b2, perhaps you can select a subset that sums to exactly s\u00b2. For example, if sum is 10, maybe the maximum s is 3 since 3\u00b2=9 <=10. But then you have to check whether the sum is >= s squared. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that sum of lengths >= s\u00b2. But then the answer is floor(sqrt(sum)) where sum is the total sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n. Wait, but we can choose any subset of the blocks. So the sum of the subset is the sum of the lengths, and we need that sum >= s\u00b2. The maximum s is the largest integer s where sum >= s\u00b2, but sum here is the sum of the subset. So the best possible is to take the sum of all blocks' lengths, and compute the maximum s where that total sum >= s\u00b2. Because if the sum is sufficient, then there's a way to arrange the blocks into s rows of s each.\n\nWait, but how? For example, suppose sum is s\u00b2. Then each row needs to sum to s. So the problem is similar to partitioning the blocks into s groups (each group is a row), each group's sum is >= s. But since the total sum is s\u00b2, each group must sum exactly s. So the question is: can the sum of the blocks' lengths be arranged into s groups each of sum exactly s?\n\nBut this depends on the individual block lengths. For example, if all blocks are of length 1, sum is s\u00b2. Then you need exactly s\u00b2 blocks, each in a row of s. So each row is s blocks of 1, which sum to s. So that's possible.\n\nBut if the sum is s\u00b2 and the blocks vary in lengths, maybe it's possible or not. However, the problem states that we can choose any subset of the blocks. So even if the sum of all blocks is S, the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S)), but maybe in some cases, even though S >= s\u00b2, but you can't arrange the blocks into s rows each of s. But the problem says to find the maximum possible s. So perhaps the answer is simply the maximum s such that the sum of all possible blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2. Because even if the sum is larger than s\u00b2, maybe there's a subset of the blocks that sums exactly to s\u00b2 and can be arranged into s rows. Or perhaps even if the sum is larger, but you can't find such a subset, the maximum s would be the floor of sqrt(S). But according to the problem statement's note, in the sample input with n=5, the sum of the lengths is 1+1+2+2+3=9. So sum is 9, s=3, which is possible. So that works.\n\nSo the key is to compute the sum of all the blocks' lengths, then find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n, then compute the floor of the square root of that sum.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows us to use a subset. So even if the total sum is S, maybe a subset sum S' >= s\u00b2. But using the entire sum gives the maximum possible S, so the maximum possible s would be floor(sqrt(S)). Because any subset sum can't be larger than S, so the maximum possible s is determined by the total sum.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute the sum of the lengths of all blocks (since using all gives the maximum sum), then take the integer square root of that sum.\n\nSo the problem now is to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nLet's find a formula for this sum.\n\nFor i from 1 to n, ceil(i/2) can be written as (i +1 )//2.\n\nSo let's compute sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet's split into even and odd terms.\n\nIf n is even, say n=2k. Then:\n\ni=1: (1+1)/2 =1\n\ni=2: (2)/2=1\n\ni=3: (3+1)/2=2\n\ni=4:4/2=2\n\n... and so on.\n\nSo for each pair (2m-1, 2m), their sum is m + m = 2m.\n\nSo for even n=2k, the sum is sum_{m=1 to k} 2m = 2*(k(k+1)/2) )=k(k+1).\n\nBut wait, for n=2k, the sum is 1+1 + 2+2 + ... +k +k? Wait no. Let's see:\n\nWhen i is odd (1,3,5,...), ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2.\n\nWhen i is even, ceil(i/2)=i/2.\n\nSo for i=1 and 2: sum is 1+1=2.\n\ni=3 and 4: sum is 2+2=4.\n\ni=5 and 6: sum is 3+3=6.\n\nSo for each pair (2m-1, 2m), the sum is m + m = 2m. The number of pairs is k for n=2k.\n\nSo sum for even n=2k is sum_{m=1 to k} 2m = 2*(k*(k+1)/2) )=k*(k+1).\n\nFor example, n=2 (k=1): sum is 1+1=2=1*2.\n\nn=4 (k=2): 1+1+2+2=6=2*3.\n\nYes.\n\nIf n is odd, say n=2k+1. Then for the first 2k terms, the sum is k*(k+1), as above. Then add the (2k+1)th term, which is (2k+1 +1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 = k+1.\n\nSo total sum is k*(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) )= (k+1)^2.\n\nFor example, n=3 (k=1): sum is 1+1+2=4= (1+1)^2.\n\nn=5 (k=2): sum of first 4 terms is 2*3=6, then add 3: total 9=3\u00b2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the formula for sum is:\n\nif n is even (n=2k), sum = k*(k+1)\n\nif n is odd (n=2k+1), sum = (k+1)^2\n\nSo now we can compute the sum quickly for any n.\n\nThen, the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of sum.\n\nBut wait, the sum is S. So the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= S. So s = floor(sqrt(S)).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFor example, in the sample input where n=5, sum is 9, sqrt(9)=3, so s=3.\n\nAnother sample: n=2, sum is 2, sqrt is ~1.414, so s=1.\n\nBut according to the first sample in the problem statement, when n=1, sum is 1. s=1. Correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\n2. Compute s = floor(sqrt(S)).\n\nOutput s.\n\nSo the problem now is to compute S for given n quickly, even when n is up to 1e9.\n\nLet's code this.\n\nThe formula for S can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nk = n / 2\n\nsum = k * (k + 1)\n\nelse:\n\nk = (n - 1)/2\n\nsum = (k + 1) * (k + 1)\n\nSo sum can be computed in O(1) time.\n\nThen compute s as the integer square root of sum.\n\nBut how to compute integer square root in C++?\n\nWe can use sqrt(sum), but for very large numbers (sum can be up to (5e8 +1)^2 when n is 1e9), which is 1e17, so using sqrt might have precision issues. So better to compute using binary search.\n\nAlternatively, in C++, using sqrtl and checking.\n\nBut for the purposes of code submission, perhaps using the formula.\n\nLet's think: when sum is up to ( (1e9 +1)/2 )^2 when n is odd. For n=1e9, if it's even, sum is (5e8) * (5e8 +1) = 5e8 * 5e8 + 5e8 = 2.5e17 +5e8. The square root of this sum would be sqrt(5e8*(5e8 +1)) \u2248 5e8 + 0.5, but since we need the floor, it's 5e8.\n\nBut perhaps for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). So the square root of that sum is sqrt(k^2 +k) \u2248 k + 0.5*(1/(k)) etc. So the integer part is k.\n\nWait, let's see. For even n=2k, sum is k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. The square of (k+0.5) is k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So sum is k\u00b2 +k. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is less than (k+0.5). Therefore, the integer part is k.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nk=1: sum=1*2=2. sqrt(2)=1.414 \u2192 floor is 1. Which is k.\n\nk=2: sum=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is k.\n\nk=3: sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3.\n\nSo for even n, s =k.\n\nBut sum is k*(k+1). So s = floor(sqrt(k*(k+1))).\n\nBut k*(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k*(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor is k.\n\nSo for even n, sum is k*(k+1), s=k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. Then sqrt is exactly k+1. So s =k+1.\n\nSo in this case, the maximum s is:\n\nif n is even: s = k (where k =n/2), but wait wait, sum is k*(k+1). So the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) is k. Because k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k < (k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So sqrt(k*(k+1)) < k+0.5, so floor is k.\n\nBut when n is odd, sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1.\n\nWait, but when n is even, sum is k(k+1). So s= floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ) =k.\n\nBut the sample input when n=5 is odd. Then sum is 3\u00b2=9, s=3.\n\nSo for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ), which is k. For example, when k=3, sum=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so floor is 3. Which is equal to k.\n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k*(k+1)) ) which is k.\n\nBut wait, in that case, for even n, s= k. Because sum is k*(k+1) which is s\u00b2 =k\u00b2 +k. So the maximum s is k. But wait, if s is k, then s\u00b2= k\u00b2. But sum is k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k >=k\u00b2. So s can be k. But what if sum is larger than k\u00b2, but the next integer is k+1, whose square is (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. But sum is k\u00b2 +k, which is less than (k+1)^2. So s can't be k+1.\n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is k.\n\nFor example, n=4 (even, k=2). sum=2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.449. floor is 2. So s=2. But the sum is 6, which is 2.449^2, but s=2. So 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes, maximum is 2.\n\nBut wait, sum is 6. So 6 >= 2\u00b2, 6 >=3\u00b2 is false. So s=2.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample where n=5 (sum 9), s=3. So that's correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is:\n\nThe maximum s can be computed as:\n\nif n is even, s = k (n=2k)\n\nif n is odd, s =k+1 (n=2k+1)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\nsum is k(k+1). Then s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nBut when is k(k+1) >= s\u00b2?\n\nWait, let's take n=2k=4, k=2. sum=6. s=2. 6 >=2\u00b2=4, but 6 <3\u00b2=9. So yes.\n\nBut wait, for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1), which is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So floor of sqrt(k(k+1)) is k.\n\nSo in this case, s is k.\n\nSo for even n, s= k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. So s=k+1.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is even, but the sum is k(k+1), which is larger than k\u00b2. So s is k.\n\nSo the formula for s is:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( (n/2) * (n/2 +1) ) )\n\nBut as we saw, this is equal to n/2.\n\nWait, let's test with n=4. n/2=2. sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.45, floor is 2. Which is n/2=2.\n\nn=6: sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. Which is 3=6/2=3.\n\nSo for even n, s is n/2.\n\nBut wait, let's check for n=2k even, sum is k(k+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ). But is that equal to k?\n\nYes.\n\nBecause sqrt(k(k+1)) = sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) < sqrt(k\u00b2 +k + 0.25) =k+0.5.\n\nSo floor is k.\n\nSo for even n, s is k, which is n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. So s is k+1.\n\nSo combining these two cases:\n\ns = (k+1) when n is odd (n=2k+1)\n\ns =k when n is even (n=2k)\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nn=1 (odd, k=0): sum is (0+1)^2=1. s=1.\n\nn=3 (k=1): sum is (1+1)^2=4 \u2192 s=2.\n\nn=5 (k=2): sum=3\u00b2=9 \u2192 s=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo s for even n is k =n/2.\n\ns for odd n is k+1 = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the formula for s is:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = n/2 \u2192 but wait, that can't be right. For example, n=4 (even), sum=6, s=2. But sqrt(6) is ~2.45, but the maximum s is 2. But according to this formula, s=4/2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6 even. sum=3*4=12. s=3. sqrt(12) is 3.464, so s=3. Which is 6/2=3.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo for even n, s= n/2.\n\nWait wait, wait. Wait for n=2k even:\n\nsum =k(k+1). s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)). Which is k.\n\nBut k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is less than k+0.5. So the floor is k.\n\nSo yes, s= k.\n\nBut k is n/2.\n\nSo for even n, s =n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2. s= k+1 = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the formula for s is:\n\ns = (n +1)/2 when n is odd.\n\ns = n/2 when n is even.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's take n=5 (odd). (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=3 \u2192 (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for s is:\n\nif n is even: s = n/2.\n\nif n is odd: s = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but what about sum?\n\nWait for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). Then s= k. But according to the formula s= k, which is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nBut for example, when k=3, sum is 3*4=12. s=3. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor is 3. So correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, when n is even, s is n/2 =k. So yes.\n\nBut for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1) which is equal to k^2 +k. The maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\ns squared is k^2 +k >= s^2.\n\nFor s=k, s\u00b2= k\u00b2 <= sum (k\u00b2 +k) \u2192 yes.\n\nFor s=k+1, s\u00b2= (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. Which is larger than sum (k\u00b2 +k). So no.\n\nSo yes, s=k.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo the problem can be solved by:\n\nFor a given n:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = n/2.\n\nif n is odd:\n\ns = (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, this can't be right. Because in the case when sum is (k+1)^2 (for n odd), the s is (k+1). For example, n=5 (k=2), sum=9, s=3.\n\nBut according to the formula, (n+1)/2= (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what about sum for even n?\n\nFor example, n=4 even. sum=2*3=6. s=2. Which is floor(sqrt(6))=2.\n\nBut according to the formula, s=4/2=2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, this seems to work. So the formula for s is:\n\ns = floor( (n+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, for n even: (n+1)/2 is (2k +1)/2= k + 0.5 \u2192 floor is k. Which is equal to n/2. For even n, yes.\n\nFor odd n: (n+1)/2= (2k+1 +1)/2= k+1.\n\nSo the formula can be written as s = (n+1) // 2.\n\nWait, but (n+1) divided by 2. For example, n=4 even: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor is 2. Which is 4//2=2.\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 3. So yes.\n\nWait, but (n+1)//2 is equal to (n//2) + (n mod 2). So for even n, n//2 =k, mod 0. So (n+1)//2 =k +0. So for even n, (n+1)//2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 2k+1 is 2k+1, divided by 2. For example, n=4 (even), (4+1)//2=5//2=2. Which is the same as 4//2=2.\n\nn=5 (odd) \u2192 (5+1)//2=6//2=3.\n\nSo the formula for s is (n+1) // 2.\n\nWait, but this would imply that s is (n+1)/2 rounded down. Which for even n is n/2, for odd n is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo according to this formula, s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, let's test this.\n\nSample input 1: n=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: n=5 \u21923. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4 \u2192 s=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when n=2. sum is 2. s=1.\n\n(n+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor is 1. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 sum=4 \u2192 s=2. Correct.\n\nSo this formula holds.\n\nBut wait, why?\n\nBecause for even n=2k:\n\nsum is k(k+1). s =k.\n\nWhich is (n+1)/2= (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5 \u2192 floor is k.\n\nWhich is equal to k= n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2. s= k+1 = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the formula s= (n+1)//2 gives the correct answer.\n\nBut this seems to ignore the sum. How can this be? Because for even n, the sum is k(k+1), and the s is k. But according to the formula, s is (n+1)//2, which is k.\n\nWait, so the conclusion is that the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, n=6 even. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor 3. Which is (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3. Correct.\n\nYes, but according to the formula, (n+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3, which is correct.\n\nBut for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1). s= k.\n\nBut according to the formula, s is (2k+1)//2= k. So yes.\n\nBut how can this be? Because the sum is k(k+1), which is k\u00b2 +k. The maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <=k(k+1).\n\nBut k\u00b2 +k is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So the floor of sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is k.\n\nWhich is exactly (n+1)//2, since n=2k, (2k+1)//2= k.\n\nSo this formula works.\n\nSo the answer for each test case is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Because there's a problem here. Let's take n=7 (odd).\n\nn=7: sum is (7+1)/2=4 \u2192 (k+1)^2 where k=3. sum=4\u00b2=16. So s=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6 even. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is (6+1)//2=3.5 \u21923.\n\nBut sqrt(12) is 3.464, floor is 3. So correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8 even. sum is4*5=20. s=4. sqrt(20)=4.472, floor is4. Which is (8+1)//2=4.5 \u21924. Correct.\n\nn=9 odd: sum is (4+1)^2=25. s=5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula s= (n+1)//2 gives the correct answer.\n\nBut why? Because for even n=2k, sum is k(k+1), and the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)) is k. So s=k= (n)/2.\n\nBut (n+1)//2 is (2k+1)//2 =k.\n\nYes, for example, (2k+1) divided by 2 is k with remainder 1. So integer division gives k.\n\nSo (n+1)//2= k.\n\nWhich is the same as (n//2) + (n mod 2) ? Let's see.\n\nFor even n: n mod 2 is 0. So (n//2) +0 =k.\n\nFor odd n: n//2 =k, mod 1. So (k) +1= k+1.\n\nSo the formula (n+1)//2 is equivalent to (n//2) + (n mod 2).\n\nBut how does this formula for s= (n+1)//2 come from?\n\nBecause for even n=2k:\n\nsum is k(k+1). So s is floor(sqrt(k(k+1))) =k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2. So s= k+1.\n\nWhich is exactly (2k+1 +1)/2= k+1.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code can be written as: for each n, output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, let's test this.\n\nSample input 1: n=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nSample input 2: n=5 \u21923 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4 \u21922 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7\u21924.\n\nsum is 16. sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nBut why is this possible? Because the sum for even n is k(k+1), which is sufficient to get s=k. For odd n, sum is (k+1)^2, which allows s=k+1.\n\nSo the code is simply:\n\nfor each test case, read n, output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut why does this work?\n\nBecause the sum is k(k+1) for even n, which allows s=k. But why is k(k+1) >=k\u00b2 ?\n\nYes, k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k >=k\u00b2. So s can be at least k. But (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. sum=k(k+1) is less than (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause sum is k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. We need s\u00b2 <= sum. So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) ), which is k.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo the code is simply to compute (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, why does the sum matter?\n\nBecause if the sum is k(k+1), the maximum s is floor(sqrt(k(k+1))) =k. But according to the formula, s is (n+1)//2 =k. Which matches.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nFor each test case, read n, compute (n+1)/2 (integer division), and output that.\n\nBut wait, let me check the sample input where n=5:\n\n(n+1)//2=3, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2. sum is 2. s=1. (2+1)//2=1.5 \u21921.\n\nYes.\n\nn=3: (3+1)//2=2. sum is4 \u2192 s=2. Correct.\n\nn=6:3. sum 12. s=3. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=7. sum is (7+1)/2=4 \u21924^2=16. So s=4. Correct.\n\nBut if n=1e9, which is even. (1e9+1)//2 =5e8 + 0.5? No. Wait, n=1e9 is even. (1e9+1) is 1e9+1. Divided by 2 is 5e8 + 0.5. But integer division in C++ truncates towards zero. So 1e9+1 is 1000000001. Divided by 2 is 500,000,000.5. So integer division gives 500,000,000.\n\nBut n=1e9 is even. So (n+1)//2 is 500,000,000.5 \u2192 integer division gives 500,000,000.\n\nWhich is correct because sum is 5e8*(5e8+1) \u2192 s=5e8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        long long n;\n        cin >> n;\n        cout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the original code was written in C++, and the variables should handle n up to 1e9, which is within the range of 32-bit integers. But when computing (n+1) /2, for n=1e9, (n+1) is 1e9+1, which is 1,000,000,001. But if n is stored as a 32-bit int, this could overflow. So better to use long long.\n\nIn the code provided by the user, the input is read into a variable. So in the code:\n\nint main() {\nint t; std::cin>>t;\nwhile(t--) {\n/* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n}\n\nSo in the code, the variable for n must be a long long to prevent overflow when n is up to 1e9. But wait, 1e9 is within the range of a 32-bit integer (up to ~2e9). But when n is 1e9, (n+1) is 1e9 +1, which is 1000000001, which is also within 32-bit integer. So perhaps using int is okay, but for safety, better to use long long.\n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nRead n as a long long.\n\nCompute (n +1)/2, using integer division.\n\nOutput that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        long long n;\n        cin >> n;\n        cout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the sample input where n=5 gives (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother sample where n=1 gives (1+1)/2=1.\n\nAnother sample where n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 \u21921.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code will solve the problem.\n\nBut why does this formula work? Because the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the sum? Because the sum for even n is k(k+1), and the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)) is k. For odd n, the sum is (k+1)^2, and sqrt is exactly k+1.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nThus, the missing code is reading n, and outputting (n+1)/2 using integer division.\n\nSo the answer is to fill the missing code with:\n\nlong long n; std::cin >> n; std::cout << (n + 1)/2 << \"\\n\";"
