So the minimal cost is zero. Hmm, this suggests that the x=0 case can have different possibilities. Wait, maybe the approach needs to consider all possible x values, including x=0. But for x=0, the minimal window length is the minimal length of a substring with zero 1s. Which could be any length of 0s. The minimal possible is zero (if the substring is empty).

But between a and b, there are 0s. So the total length is b - a +1. Wait, no. The window must contain exactly x 1s. The minimal window is the smallest possible window that contains exactly x 1s. For example, if the 1s are at positions 0, 2, 3, then the window for x=2 is from 0 to 2 (positions 0, 1, 2), which includes 0 and 2, which are 1s. So the window length is 3 (0-2 inclusive). But another window could be from 2 to 3 (positions 2,3), which has two 1s, and length 2. So the minimal is 2. So the minimal window for x is the minimal (ones[i + x -1] - ones[i] + 1) for all i from 0 to (total_ones - x). So for each x, the minimal window length is the minimal of the above values. So for each x from 1 to total_ones, compute the minimal window length as the minimal (ones[i +x -1] - ones[i] +1) for i from 0 to (total_ones -x). Once we have that, for each x, compute the cost as max( (window_len -x), (total_ones -x) ), then take the minimum over all x and x=0. But also, for x=0, the cost is max(0, total_ones) = total_ones. So the algorithm steps:\n\nCompute the minimal window for each x from 1 to total_ones. For each x, compute cost as max( (window_len -x), (total_ones -x) ) The minimal cost is the minimum between all these costs and the x=0 case. But how to handle x=0. Wait, the x=0 case can be considered by allowing the substring to be empty, which has x=0 and window_len=0. But in that case, the cost is max(0, total_ones) \u2192 total_ones. But perhaps there's a better x=0 substring. For example, if there's a substring of all 0s (with length l), then x=0 and window_len = l. The cost is max(l, total_ones). So the minimal cost for x=0 would be the minimal possible l where l is the length of a substring with x=0 (all 0s), but this l can be anything from 0 (empty) up to the maximum possible 0s substring. But the minimal cost here would be the minimal possible max(l, total_ones), which is when l is as small as possible. So the minimal is max(0, total_ones) = total_ones. Or perhaps not. For example, if the entire string is 0s, then x=0 and window_len can be n. But then the cost is max(n, 0) = n. But if you choose the empty substring, the cost is max(0,0) =0. So in this case, the x=0 case with window_len 0 gives a better cost. Wait, this suggests that the x=0 case should be considered as a possible candidate. But how? Alternatively, perhaps the x=0 case can be handled by allowing the empty substring, which gives cost max(0, total_ones). But in cases where the entire string is 0s, then the optimal solution is to remove all characters (cost 0). So how does that fit into this model? Ah, because when the entire string is 0s, total_ones is zero. So for x=0, the minimal window length is zero (empty substring), so the cost is max(0, 0) =0. But if we have a substring of 0s (like part of the string), then the cost could be higher. So the minimal is the empty substring. But for the code, when the total_ones is zero, the answer is zero. So perhaps the code needs to handle that case separately. So let's outline the steps again: For each test case:\n\n- Compute the list of 1s positions (ones array).\n\n- total_ones = ones.size().\n\n- If total_ones is zero:\n\n   - The minimal cost is zero (since you can remove all, which gives cost zero).\n\n   - So output 0.\n\n- Else if total_ones is equal to the length of the string (all 1s):\n\n   - The minimal cost is zero (since the entire string has x=total_ones, so cost is max( (len -x), (total_ones -x ) \u2192 len is total_ones, x is total_ones \u2192 (total_ones - total_ones) =0, and (total_ones - total_ones)=0 \u2192 max 0. So cost is 0.\n\n   - So output 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Precompute the minimal window length for each x from 1 to total_ones.\n\n   - For each x, compute the minimal window length.\n\n   - For each x, compute cost as max( (window_len -x), (total_ones -x) )\n\n   - Also, consider x=0 (cost is total_ones) and the case where x=total_ones (cost is (window_len - total_ones)).\n\n   - Find the minimal cost among all these. So how to handle these cases. But now, looking at the code provided, the code is using an array arr, which is filled for each i from 0 to n-1. The code then uses arr[n], which is likely the total_ones.",

But why is the code considering substrings of length arr[n]? Because arr[n] is the total_ones. So the code is looking for substrings of length equal to the total number of 1s. Because in such a substring, the maximum between (len -x) and (total_ones -x) would be (len -x), since len is equal to total_ones, so len -x = total_ones -x. So max(total_ones -x, total_ones -x) is total_ones -x. So the code is trying to find the minimal possible (total_ones -x) among all substrings of length total_ones. But x is the number of 1s in that substring. So total_ones -x is the number of 1s removed (if you take the substring, then the 1s removed is total_ones -x). The number of 0s left is (len -x) = (total_ones -x). So the cost is max (total_ones -x, total_ones -x) = total_ones -x. So the code is trying to find the minimal value of (total_ones -x) in these substrings of length total_ones. So the code's approach is to minimize (total_ones -x), which is equivalent to maximizing x (the number of 1s in the substring). Because x can't exceed the total_ones. So the maximal x is total_ones, which would give (total_ones -x) =0, but in that case, the substring must consist of all 1s, which implies the len is total_ones, which is possible only if the entire string has all 1s. So in this case, the code's approach would find the minimal cost as zero. But this approach is only considering substrings of length equal to total_ones. But according to the problem statement, the optimal solution may come from a substring of any length, not just total_ones. But in the sample input 1:\n\nInput: 101110\n\nSample Output: 1. The code's approach may not work. Let's see. The sample input is \"101110\". So total_ones is 4. The code would look for substrings of length 4. Let's see what's the maximal x (number of 1s) in any substring of length 4. For example, the substring could be \"1011\" (positions 0-3), which has 3 ones. Or \"0111\" (positions 1-4), which has 3 ones. Or \"1110\" (positions 3-6), which has 3 ones. So the maximal x in any substring of length 4 is 3. So the minimal (total_ones -x) is 4 -3 =1. So the code would output 1, which matches the sample. But how does this code handle other possible substrings? For example, the optimal solution in this sample is to have a substring of length 3, with x=3 ones.",

So the code would output 3, which matches the sample. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but why?\n\nWait, maybe the code is missing some parts, but the problem is that the code's missing part is the filling of the arr array, which is a prefix sum array. So the code in the loop for i from 0 to n-1 is supposed to fill arr with the prefix sum of 1s. Yes. So arr[i] is the number of 1s in the first i characters (assuming 1-based or 0-based? Probably 0-based, since i starts at 0. So arr[0] =0, arr[1] is the count of 1s in the first character (s[0]), etc. For example, for s = \"101110\", the arr array would be:\n\narr[0] =0\n\narr[1] =1 (s[0] is '1')\n\narr[2] =1 (s[1] is '0')\n\narr[3] =2 (s[2] is '1')\n\narr[4] =3 (s[3] is '1')\n\narr[5] =4 (s[4] is '1')\n\narr[6] =4 (s[5] is '0')\n\nSo arr[6] =4 (total_ones).

So the code's approach, which is only considering substrings of length 4, finds the correct answer. But why?\n\nBecause in this case, the minimal cost is achieved by a substring of length 3. But the code's approach of checking substrings of length 4 still gives the correct answer. How? Ah, because when the code is checking the substrings of length 4, the maximal x in those is 3. So the code's ans is 4-3=1. But there exists another substring (length 3) where the cost is also 1. But the code's approach doesn't directly consider that, but it still finds the correct answer. So perhaps the code's approach is sufficient because the minimal cost is achieved when the two terms (number of 0s and 1s removed) are equal or when one of them is minimal. But why is this the case? Let me think of the general case. Suppose the minimal cost is achieved by a substring of length l, with x 1s. Then the cost is max(l -x, total_ones -x). We need to find the minimal possible max of these two values. But when l >= (total_ones -x), then the cost is l -x. To minimize this, we can make l as small as possible for a given x. But when l is exactly (total_ones -x), then the cost is l -x = (total_ones -x) -x = total_ones - 2x. Wait, no. Wait, l is (total_ones -x).",

So the missing code in the loop is:\n\narr[i+1] = arr[i] + (s.charAt(i) == '1' ? 1 : 0); So for each i in 0 to n-1, we set the next element in the prefix sum array. Thus, the correct code to fill the array is as above.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem statement says that after removing some characters from the beginning and end of the binary string, the cost is the maximum between the number of 0s left and the number of 1s removed. We need to find the minimum possible cost.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to model the problem in a way that allows us to compute the required values efficiently. Let's think about what variables are involved here.\n\nThe cost is max(number of 0s remaining, number of 1s removed). So, for any possible substring (after trimming from both ends), we need to calculate these two values and find the minimum of their maximum.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute these for all possible substrings? Because considering all possible substrings directly would be O(n^2), which isn't feasible for n up to 2e5.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, there's an array arr of size 200005. The code processes each test case by filling this arr array. Then, after that, there's a loop where it's doing something with arr[n], and iterating over i to compute ans.\n\nSo maybe the arr array is a prefix sum array. Like, arr[i] could store the number of 1s up to index i. Or maybe the number of 0s. Let's see.\n\nIn the example code, after filling arr, they use arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i]. Wait, arr[n] would be the total number of 1s in the entire string, perhaps? Because the code says ans is initialized to arr[n], which is then used in the loop.\n\nWait, let's look at the code structure again. For each test case, the code initializes arr, then fills it in a loop from 0 to n-1. Then ans is arr[n], which suggests that arr is a 1-based array, perhaps. So arr[0] is 0, arr[1] is the count up to the first character, etc. So for i from 0 to n-1, the code is building the prefix sum.\n\nWait, the original code has a for loop over i from 0 to n-1. The code inside the loop is missing. Let's think: what's the purpose of this array?\n\nIn the code after filling arr, they compute ans as arr[n]. Then for i from 0 to i + arr[n] <=n, they compute arr[n] - (arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i]). Hmm.\n\nLet me try to understand this. Suppose arr is a prefix sum of 1s. So arr[i] is the number of 1s in the first i characters (assuming 0-based). Then arr[n] is the total number of 1s in the entire string.\n\nBut in the loop, when i is varying, the code is looking at i + arr[n], which would be the total number of 1s plus i. Wait, but arr[n] is the total 1s. So if arr[n] is the total 1s, then the code is trying to iterate over possible substrings where the number of 1s in the substring is equal to the total 1s minus the ones that are removed. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arr is the prefix sum of 0s. Let's think again. The cost is the max of the number of 0s left in the string (the substring after trimming) and the number of 1s removed. The number of 1s removed would be the total 1s in the original string minus the 1s in the substring (since when you remove characters from the ends, the 1s removed are the ones not in the substring). So for a substring, the 1s removed is total_ones - current_ones_in_substring.\n\nThe cost is max(number_of_0s_in_substring, total_ones - number_of_1s_in_substring).\n\nWe need to find the substring (after trimming from both ends) where this maximum is minimized.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the substring s' where max(zeros_in_s', total_ones - ones_in_s') is as small as possible.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet's consider that total_ones is fixed for a test case. For each possible substring s', the number of 0s in s' can be computed as the length of s' minus the number of 1s in s' (since the substring is binary). So:\n\nzeros_in_s' = (end - start + 1) - ones_in_s'.\n\nSo the cost can be written as max( (end - start + 1 - ones_in_s') , (total_ones - ones_in_s') )\n\nWe need to minimize this maximum.\n\nHmm. Let's denote x as the number of ones in the substring s'. Then the cost is max( (len(s') - x), (total_ones - x) ). Since len(s') is (end - start + 1).\n\nBut how to find x and len(s') that minimize this maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for a given x, the cost depends on the len(s'). Let's see. Suppose x is fixed. Then the cost is max( (len(s') - x), (total_ones - x) ). So to minimize this, the len(s') must be as small as possible, but not less than (total_ones - x). Because:\n\nIf (len(s') -x) >= (total_ones -x), then the cost is len(s') -x. So to minimize, we can set len(s') as small as possible, but len(s') must be at least (total_ones -x) + x = total_ones. Wait, no. Wait, if len(s') -x is larger, then the cost is len(s') -x. So to minimize that, for fixed x, the len(s') should be as small as possible. But x is the number of 1s in the substring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this problem as for each possible x (number of 1s in the substring), find the minimal possible maximum between (len(s') - x) and (total_ones - x). Then among all possible x, select the minimal maximum.\n\nBut how to find x? The x can vary from 0 to total_ones, since the substring can have up to all 1s, but also some 0s.\n\nWait, but the number of 1s in the substring can't exceed the total_ones. So x can range between 0 and total_ones. But the substring can have any number of 0s plus x 1s.\n\nBut this approach might not be feasible for large n. So perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal maximum occurs when the two terms are balanced. So when (len(s') -x) = (total_ones -x). Which would imply len(s') = total_ones. So len(s') is exactly total_ones, and the cost would be len(s') -x = total_ones -x. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost is the minimum between the minimal possible of the maximum of these two values. Let's think of the two terms as a and b. We want the minimal max(a, b).\n\nIf we can find a substring where a and b are as close as possible, then their max would be minimized. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible substring, the cost is the maximum of the two terms. Let's denote:\n\na = number of 0s in substring (len - x)\nb = number of 1s removed (total_ones - x)\n\nSo cost = max(a, b)\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible cost.\n\nWe can rewrite this as cost = max( len -x, total_ones -x )\n\nBut len is the length of the substring. So len = end - start + 1.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, len - x is the number of 0s in the substring, which is (number of 0s) = len - x.\n\nSo, the cost is max( len - x, (total_ones - x) )\n\nSo for a substring, the cost depends on x (number of 1s in it) and len (the length of the substring).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, for a substring with x 1s, the cost is max( (len -x), (total_ones -x) )\n\nBut len is at least x (since the substring has x 1s and the rest are 0s). So len -x is non-negative.\n\nSo the cost is the maximum of these two terms.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the minimal possible maximum over all possible substrings.\n\nWe can think of this as for each possible x (number of 1s in the substring), find the minimal possible maximum between (len -x) and (total_ones -x), and then take the minimal among all x.\n\nSo for each x (from 0 to total_ones), find the minimal possible (max(len -x, total_ones -x)), where x is the number of 1s in some substring, and len is the length of that substring.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet's think for each x, what's the minimal possible value of max(len -x, total_ones -x).\n\nThe term total_ones -x is fixed once x is chosen. The term len -x depends on the length of the substring. To minimize the maximum of these two, we can try to minimize len -x while ensuring that total_ones -x <= len -x (so that the max is len -x) or the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, for a given x, the minimal possible maximum is the maximum between (total_ones -x) and (minimal possible (len -x) for that x).\n\nBut how to find the minimal len for a given x. The minimal len is the minimal possible length of a substring containing exactly x 1s. Wait, no. Because the substring can have at least x 1s. Wait, no. The substring must have exactly x 1s. Because x is the number of 1s in the substring. So len is the length of a substring with exactly x 1s. But the minimal possible len for a substring with x 1s would be the minimal window length that contains exactly x 1s.\n\nSo for each x, the minimal len is the length of the smallest window (contiguous substring) that contains exactly x 1s.\n\nIf we can precompute for each x the minimal window length, then for each x, we can compute the max between (minimal_len -x) and (total_ones -x), then choose the minimal among all x.\n\nAh! This seems promising.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Precompute the prefix sum of the positions of 1s. Then for each x, compute the minimal window length that contains exactly x 1s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each x, the minimal window is the minimal distance between two indices i and j where the number of 1s between i and j is exactly x, and j -i +1 is as small as possible.\n\nOnce we have that, then for each x, compute the maximum between (window_len -x) and (total_ones -x). Then the answer is the minimal of these maximum values over all possible x.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Compute the total_ones (the total number of 1s in the string).\n- If total_ones is zero, then the cost is zero (since all are 0s, so removing all gives cost 0).\n- Similarly, if all are 1s, then the cost is zero (since removing all 1s, but then 0s left is zero, and 1s removed is total_ones, but wait, in that case, the cost would be max(0, total_ones) = total_ones. Wait, no. Wait, if all are 1s, then if you remove all of them, the substring is empty. Then the number of 0s left is zero. The number of 1s removed is total_ones. So the cost is max(0, total_ones) = total_ones. But if you leave the entire string as is, the substring is all 1s, so the number of 0s is zero. The number of 1s removed is (total_ones - x), where x is the 1s in the substring. So x is total_ones. So the 1s removed is total_ones - x = 0. So the cost is max(0, 0) =0. So in this case, the cost is zero. So when the string is all 1s, the minimal cost is zero. Wait, but according to the problem's sample input 4, where the input is '1111', the output is 0. Because you can remove the entire string. So the cost is max(0 (0s left), 4 (1s removed)) \u2192 4. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says that when you remove from the beginning and end, the cost is the maximum of the 0s left in the string and the 1s removed. So if you remove all characters, the substring is empty. So 0s left is 0. The 1s removed is the total 1s (4). So the cost is 4. But according to the sample input 4, the answer is 0. Wait, sample input 4 is '0000', the output is 0. So perhaps when the string is all 0s, removing all gives 0 0s left and 0 1s removed, so max is 0. But for all 1s, you can leave the entire string. Then the 0s left is 0, and 1s removed is 0. So cost is 0. So in that case, yes, the answer is zero.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, for the case where the string is all 1s, the minimal cost is zero, because you can leave the entire string.\n\nSo back to the approach.\n\nFor each x (number of 1s in the substring), compute the minimal possible window length of a substring with exactly x 1s.\n\nThen for each x, compute the cost as max( (window_length - x), (total_ones - x) ), and find the minimal among all such costs.\n\nSo the minimal cost is the minimum over all x in 0 <= x <= total_ones of max( (window_length for x 1s) - x, total_ones -x )\n\nBut how to compute the minimal window length for each x.\n\nThis seems like a sliding window problem. For each x, find the minimal window length that contains exactly x 1s.\n\nBut x can range from 0 to total_ones. However, the minimal window for x=0 would be zero (if possible). Wait, x is the number of 1s in the substring. So x can't be more than the total_ones. Also, x can't be less than zero.\n\nSo for x=0: the substring can't have any 1s. So the minimal window is the minimal possible length (which is zero, if possible). Wait, but in that case, the substring is empty. So the 0s left is zero, the 1s removed is total_ones. So cost is max(0, total_ones). Which is total_ones. But perhaps if there is a substring with x=0 (i.e., all 0s) then the cost can be (len -0) (number of 0s) and (total_ones -0) (number of 1s removed). So the cost is max(len, total_ones). For example, if the entire string is 0s, then x=0 and len is n. So cost is max(n, total_ones). Since total_ones is zero, the cost is n. But if you remove all, the cost is max(0,0) =0. So the minimal cost is zero. Hmm, this suggests that the x=0 case can have different possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe the approach needs to consider all possible x values, including x=0.\n\nBut for x=0, the minimal window length is the minimal length of a substring with zero 1s. Which could be any length of 0s. The minimal possible is zero (if the substring is empty). But that's allowed. Because you can remove all characters from the string. So the substring is empty. So x=0, window length is zero. Then the cost is max(0-0, total_ones -0) \u2192 max(0, total_ones). Which would be total_ones. But perhaps there's a better way. For example, if you leave an empty substring, then the cost is max(0, total_ones). But maybe there's a better x value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the x can't be zero. Because the substring must have exactly x 1s. So for x=0, the substring can't have any 1s. But the minimal window length is zero (the empty substring), which is allowed. But in that case, the cost is max(0, total_ones) = total_ones. Which may be higher than other x's.\n\nBut perhaps for some test cases, x=0 could be the minimal. For example, if the entire string is 1s, then x can be total_ones. Then the cost would be max( len - x, 0 ), where len is the window length (the entire string). len is total_ones. So len -x is zero. So cost is zero. Which is better than x=0's cost of total_ones.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal cost is when x is as large as possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut back to the approach of finding the minimal window length for each x.\n\nThe way to compute the minimal window length for exactly x 1s can be done with a sliding window approach.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Precompute a list of the indices where 1s occur. Let's call this ones array. For example, for s = \"01011\", the ones array would be [0, 2, 3].\n\n2. The total_ones is the size of this array. If total_ones is zero, the minimal cost is zero (since you can remove all, giving cost zero). So handle this case first.\n\n3. For each x in 0 to total_ones:\n\n   a. For x=0: the minimal window length is zero (empty substring). The cost is max(0, total_ones) \u2192 total_ones. But this may not be the minimal.\n\n   b. For x>0: find the minimal window length that contains exactly x 1s. This can be found by looking at the ones array. For example, for x=2, the window would start at ones[i] and end at ones[i+x-1], and the window length is ones[i+x-1] - ones[i] +1. Then, the minimal window length is the minimal such value over all possible i.\n\n   Wait, the window needs to include exactly x 1s. The minimal window would be the earliest possible x consecutive 1s. For example, if the ones array is [a, b, c, d], then for x=2, the possible windows are a-b (window from a to b), b-c, c-d. The window length is (b -a +1) (the first 1 is at a, the second at b. The window starts at a, ends at b. The length is b - a +1. But between a and b, there are 0s. So the total length is b - a +1.\n\nWait, no. The window must contain exactly x 1s. The minimal window is the smallest possible window that contains exactly x 1s. For example, if the 1s are at positions 0, 2, 3, then the window for x=2 is from 0 to 2 (positions 0, 1, 2), which includes 0 and 2, which are 1s. So the window length is 3 (0-2 inclusive). But another window could be from 2 to 3 (positions 2,3), which has two 1s, and length 2. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the minimal window for x is the minimal (ones[i + x -1] - ones[i] + 1) for all i from 0 to (total_ones - x).\n\nSo for each x, the minimal window length is the minimal of the above values.\n\nSo for each x from 1 to total_ones, compute the minimal window length as the minimal (ones[i +x -1] - ones[i] +1) for i from 0 to (total_ones -x).\n\nOnce we have that, for each x, compute the cost as max( (window_len -x), (total_ones -x) ), then take the minimum over all x and x=0.\n\nBut also, for x=0, the cost is max(0, total_ones) = total_ones.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nCompute the minimal window for each x from 1 to total_ones.\n\nFor each x, compute cost as max( (window_len -x), (total_ones -x) )\n\nThe minimal cost is the minimum between all these costs and the x=0 case.\n\nBut how to handle x=0.\n\nWait, the x=0 case can be considered by allowing the substring to be empty, which has x=0 and window_len=0.\n\nBut in that case, the cost is max(0, total_ones) \u2192 total_ones.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better x=0 substring. For example, if there's a substring of all 0s (with length l), then x=0 and window_len = l. The cost is max(l, total_ones).\n\nSo the minimal cost for x=0 would be the minimal possible l where l is the length of a substring with x=0 (all 0s), but this l can be anything from 0 (empty) up to the maximum possible 0s substring. But the minimal cost here would be the minimal possible max(l, total_ones), which is when l is as small as possible. So the minimal is max(0, total_ones) = total_ones. Or perhaps not. For example, if the entire string is 0s, then x=0 and window_len can be n. But then the cost is max(n, 0) = n. But if you choose the empty substring, the cost is max(0,0) =0. So in this case, the x=0 case with window_len 0 gives a better cost.\n\nWait, this suggests that the x=0 case should be considered as a possible candidate. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the x=0 case can be handled by allowing the empty substring, which gives cost max(0, total_ones). But in cases where the entire string is 0s, then the optimal solution is to remove all characters (cost 0). So how does that fit into this model?\n\nAh, because when the entire string is 0s, total_ones is zero. So for x=0, the minimal window length is zero (empty substring), so the cost is max(0, 0) =0.\n\nBut if we have a substring of 0s (like part of the string), then the cost could be higher. So the minimal is the empty substring.\n\nBut for the code, when the total_ones is zero, the answer is zero. So perhaps the code needs to handle that case separately.\n\nSo let's outline the steps again:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Compute the list of 1s positions (ones array).\n\n- total_ones = ones.size().\n\n- If total_ones is zero:\n\n   - The minimal cost is zero (since you can remove all, which gives cost zero).\n\n   - So output 0.\n\n- Else if total_ones is equal to the length of the string (all 1s):\n\n   - The minimal cost is zero (since the entire string has x=total_ones, so cost is max( (len -x), (total_ones -x ) \u2192 len is total_ones, x is total_ones \u2192 (total_ones - total_ones) =0, and (total_ones - total_ones)=0 \u2192 max 0. So cost is 0.\n\n   - So output 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Precompute the minimal window length for each x from 1 to total_ones.\n\n   - For each x, compute the minimal window length.\n\n   - For each x, compute cost as max( (window_len -x), (total_ones -x) )\n\n   - Also, consider x=0 (cost is total_ones) and the case where x=total_ones (cost is (window_len - total_ones)).\n\n   - Find the minimal cost among all these.\n\nSo how to handle these cases.\n\nBut now, looking at the code provided, the code is using an array arr, which is filled for each i from 0 to n-1. The code then uses arr[n], which is likely the total_ones. Then, for i in a loop, it's trying to compute arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i]. So perhaps arr is a prefix sum of 1s.\n\nSo for each position i in the string, arr[i] is the number of 1s up to index i (exclusive?), depending on the setup. Let's suppose it's a prefix sum array where arr[i] is the number of 1s in the first i characters.\n\nWait, in the code, after the loop, the code initializes ans as arr[n], which would be the total number of 1s.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i + arr[n] <= n; i++) {\n    ans = Math.min(ans, arr[n] - (arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i]));\n}\n\nWait, arr[n] is the total_ones.\n\nSo i is the starting index, and i + arr[n] is the ending index. So the substring is from i to (i + arr[n] -1), perhaps. Because the length is arr[n] (total_ones). So the code is considering substrings of length arr[n], and counting the number of 1s in that substring (arr[i+arr[n]] - arr[i]).\n\nThen, the code computes arr[n] - (this difference), which is total_ones - (number of 1s in the substring). But if the substring has x 1s, then this is (total_ones -x). So for the substring from i to i+arr[n]-1, the code is calculating (total_ones -x). Then, the code is trying to find the minimal ans, which is initialized to arr[n], and then for each such substring, ans is the minimum between the current ans and (arr[n] - x).\n\nBut why is the code considering substrings of length arr[n]?\n\nBecause arr[n] is the total_ones. So the code is looking for substrings of length equal to the total number of 1s. Because in such a substring, the maximum between (len -x) and (total_ones -x) would be (len -x), since len is equal to total_ones, so len -x = total_ones -x. So max(total_ones -x, total_ones -x) is total_ones -x. So the code is trying to find the minimal possible (total_ones -x) among all substrings of length total_ones. But x is the number of 1s in that substring. So total_ones -x is the number of 1s removed (if you take the substring, then the 1s removed is total_ones -x). The number of 0s left is (len -x) = (total_ones -x). So the cost is max (total_ones -x, total_ones -x) = total_ones -x.\n\nSo the code is trying to find the minimal value of (total_ones -x) in these substrings of length total_ones. So the code's approach is to minimize (total_ones -x), which is equivalent to maximizing x (the number of 1s in the substring). Because x can't exceed the total_ones. So the maximal x is total_ones, which would give (total_ones -x) =0, but in that case, the substring must consist of all 1s, which implies the len is total_ones, which is possible only if the entire string has all 1s. So in this case, the code's approach would find the minimal cost as zero.\n\nBut this approach is only considering substrings of length equal to total_ones. But according to the problem statement, the optimal solution may come from a substring of any length, not just total_ones.\n\nBut in the sample input 1:\n\nInput: 101110\n\nSample Output: 1.\n\nThe code's approach may not work. Let's see.\n\nThe sample input is \"101110\". So total_ones is 4. The code would look for substrings of length 4. Let's see what's the maximal x (number of 1s) in any substring of length 4.\n\nFor example, the substring could be \"1011\" (positions 0-3), which has 3 ones. Or \"0111\" (positions 1-4), which has 3 ones. Or \"1110\" (positions 3-6), which has 3 ones. So the maximal x in any substring of length 4 is 3. So the minimal (total_ones -x) is 4 -3 =1. So the code would output 1, which matches the sample.\n\nBut how does this code handle other possible substrings? For example, the optimal solution in this sample is to have a substring of length 3, with x=3 ones. Because then len -x is 0, and total_ones -x is 1. So the cost is 1. But the code's loop is not considering substrings of length 3, but only length 4.\n\nWait, but in this case, the code's approach seems to work. So perhaps the code is correct, but why?\n\nBecause the code is considering that the optimal cost is when the two terms (number of 0s left and number of 1s removed) are equal. Because when the substring's length is equal to the number of 1s in the substring plus the number of 0s, the cost is the maximum of those two. But in some cases, it's possible to have a substring where the two terms are equal.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is based on the observation that the minimal cost occurs when the two terms are balanced, i.e., when the substring's length is equal to the total_ones. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the minimal (total_ones -x) over all possible substrings of length total_ones. And then compare this with the case where the substring is empty (ans is initialized to arr[n], which is total_ones). So the code's ans is the minimum between total_ones and the minimal (total_ones -x) for substrings of length total_ones.\n\nBut this seems incomplete. Because the optimal solution might come from a substring of a different length.\n\nBut according to the sample input 2:\n\nSample Input 2: 01101110110111011110\n\nSample Output: 3.\n\nThe total_ones is 14. The code would consider substrings of length 14. The code would look for the maximum x in these substrings. The minimal (14 -x) would be 3. So the code would output 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is correct, but why?\n\nWait, maybe the code is missing some parts, but the problem is that the code's missing part is the filling of the arr array, which is a prefix sum array.\n\nSo the code in the loop for i from 0 to n-1 is supposed to fill arr with the prefix sum of 1s.\n\nYes. So arr[i] is the number of 1s in the first i characters (assuming 1-based or 0-based? Probably 0-based, since i starts at 0. So arr[0] =0, arr[1] is the count of 1s in the first character (s[0]), etc.\n\nFor example, for s = \"101110\", the arr array would be:\n\narr[0] =0\n\narr[1] =1 (s[0] is '1')\n\narr[2] =1 (s[1] is '0')\n\narr[3] =2 (s[2] is '1')\n\narr[4] =3 (s[3] is '1')\n\narr[5] =4 (s[4] is '1')\n\narr[6] =4 (s[5] is '0')\n\nSo arr[6] =4 (total_ones).\n\nThen the code initializes ans to arr[n] (4).\n\nThen, in the loop for i from 0 to i + arr[n] <=n (i+4 <=6 \u2192 i can be 0,1,2):\n\nFor each i, compute arr[i+4] - arr[i], which is the number of 1s in the substring s[i..i+3] (since arr[i+4] - arr[i] is the count from index i to i+3, which is 4 characters).\n\nSo for i=0: arr[4] - arr[0] =3. So 4-3=1. So ans is min(4, 1) \u2192 1.\n\nFor i=1: arr[5] - arr[1] =4-1=3. So 4-3=1. ans remains 1.\n\nFor i=2: arr[6] - arr[2] =4-1=3. 4-3=1. ans remains 1.\n\nSo the code's ans is 1, which is correct.\n\nBut how does this handle other possible substrings? Like, for example, the substring \"111\" which has x=3 and len=3. So cost is max(0,1) \u21921. So the code's approach, which is only considering substrings of length 4, finds the correct answer. But why?\n\nBecause in this case, the minimal cost is achieved by a substring of length 3. But the code's approach of checking substrings of length 4 still gives the correct answer. How?\n\nAh, because when the code is checking the substrings of length 4, the maximal x in those is 3. So the code's ans is 4-3=1. But there exists another substring (length 3) where the cost is also 1. But the code's approach doesn't directly consider that, but it still finds the correct answer.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is sufficient because the minimal cost is achieved when the two terms (number of 0s and 1s removed) are equal or when one of them is minimal.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nLet me think of the general case. Suppose the minimal cost is achieved by a substring of length l, with x 1s. Then the cost is max(l -x, total_ones -x).\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible max of these two values.\n\nBut when l >= (total_ones -x), then the cost is l -x. To minimize this, we can make l as small as possible for a given x. But when l is exactly (total_ones -x), then the cost is l -x = (total_ones -x) -x = total_ones - 2x. Wait, no. Wait, l is (total_ones -x). Then, the cost is max( (total_ones -x) -x, total_ones -x ) \u2192 max( total_ones - 2x, total_ones -x ). Which is total_ones -x. So it's the same as the other term.\n\nAlternatively, if we have a substring where l -x = total_ones -x \u2192 l = total_ones. So in this case, the cost is l -x = total_ones -x. Which is the same as the other term. So the cost is total_ones -x.\n\nSo for any substring of length total_ones, the cost is total_ones -x, where x is the number of 1s in the substring. So maximizing x in such a substring gives the minimal cost (total_ones -x).\n\nBut in the code, the code is looking for substrings of length total_ones, and computes the minimal cost as the minimal (total_ones -x) over those substrings. But why is this sufficient to find the overall minimal cost?\n\nBecause for any other substring of length l not equal to total_ones, the cost is the maximum between (l -x) and (total_ones -x). So if l is greater than total_ones -x, then the cost is l -x. Which is greater than or equal to (total_ones -x). So the minimal cost for such substrings would be >= (total_ones -x), which is the same as the cost for substrings of length total_ones. Therefore, considering only substrings of length total_ones is sufficient to find the minimal possible cost.\n\nAh! Because in other cases, the cost would be at least as big as the cost for the substring of length total_ones. So the minimal cost must be found among the substrings of length total_ones or the case where the substring is empty (x=0).\n\nWait, but there's also the case where the substring is empty. For example, if you remove all characters, then the cost is max(0, total_ones). So the code's approach must also consider this case.\n\nIn the code, ans is initialized to arr[n] (total_ones), which is the cost for the empty substring. Then, the code tries to find a better cost among substrings of length total_ones.\n\nSo combining these, the code's approach is:\n\nThe minimal cost is the minimum between the empty substring's cost (total_ones) and the minimal (total_ones -x) among all substrings of length total_ones.\n\nBut why is this sufficient?\n\nBecause for any other substring (non-empty and not of length total_ones), the cost is the maximum between (l -x) and (total_ones -x). If l < total_ones -x, then the cost is total_ones -x. Which is the same as if the substring was of length total_ones and x is the same. But since the code is maximizing x in substrings of length total_ones, then the minimal (total_ones -x) would be better.\n\nIf l >= total_ones -x, then the cost is l -x. Which is >= (total_ones -x), since l >= (total_ones -x). So in this case, the cost is larger than the cost of a substring of length total_ones with the same x.\n\nTherefore, the minimal cost must be either:\n\n1. The cost of the empty substring (max(0, total_ones) = total_ones).\n\n2. The minimal (total_ones -x) among all substrings of length total_ones.\n\n3. The cost of a substring where l < total_ones -x, which would have a cost of total_ones -x. But this is the same as case 2.\n\nSo the code's approach of considering case 1 and case 2 is sufficient.\n\nSo the code is correct, and the missing part is filling the arr array as a prefix sum of 1s.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\narr[i+1] = arr[i] + (s.charAt(i) == '1' ? 1 : 0);\n\nBecause for each character in the string, if it's '1', add 1 to the previous sum, else add 0.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++). So arr is of size 200005, which is larger than the maximum possible n (2e5+5). So for i from 0 to n-1, the code must fill arr[i+1] based on the previous value plus the current character.\n\nFor example, the first character (s[0]) is processed, and arr[1] is set to arr[0] + (if the character is '1').\n\nSo the prefix sum array is 1-based. arr[0] =0, arr[1] = number of 1s in s[0], arr[2] = arr[1] + s[1], etc.\n\nSo in the loop, the code would be:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n    arr[i+1] = arr[i] + (s.charAt(i) == '1' ? 1 : 0);\n}\n\nThis way, arr[i+1] is the number of 1s in the first i+1 characters (from 0 to i).\n\nThen, arr[n] is the total number of 1s in the entire string.\n\nIn the loop that follows, for each i, the code checks if i + arr[n] <=n. Then, computes the number of 1s in the substring from i to i+arr[n]-1 (since arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i] is the sum from i to i+arr[n] -1).\n\nSo this code correctly calculates the number of 1s in a substring of length arr[n] starting at i. The minimal (total_ones -x) is the maximal x in such substrings.\n\nSo the missing code is filling the prefix sum array.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill the arr array with the prefix sums of 1s.\n\nSo the missing code in the loop is:\n\narr[i+1] = arr[i] + (s.charAt(i) == '1' ? 1 : 0);\n\nSo for each i in 0 to n-1, we set the next element in the prefix sum array.\n\nThus, the correct code to fill the array is as above."
