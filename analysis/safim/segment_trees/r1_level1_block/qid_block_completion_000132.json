Then, after collecting all robots, check if all other robots are in rows >= topMostRobot and columns >= leftMostRobot. If yes, then output YES, else NO. So the code needs to find the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Then check if all other robots are to the right (j >= leftMostRobot) and/or in lower rows (i >= topMostRobot). So in the code:\n\nInitially, topMostRobot is set to 5 (a value larger than possible). For each robot (i,j), if i is less than the current topMostRobot, then this is a new topmost row. So we need to set topMostRobot to i, and reset the leftMostRobot to j. Then, within this row, check other robots and see if any have a smaller j.\n\nBut in the code, the current code for handling leftMostRobot is:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n} But topMostRobotCol is initialized to 5. Wait, perhaps the variable names are mixed. Maybe leftMostRobot should track the minimal j in the topMost row. So when a robot is in the topmost row (i == topMostRobot), then check if j is less than leftMostRobot. So perhaps the code should have: When i == topMostRobot, compare j with leftMostRobot and update it if j is smaller. But in the current code, after the initial check for i < topMostRobot, the code then checks j < topMostRobotCol (which is initialized to 5). So when a robot is in a higher row (i < topMostRobot), the code inside the if block (which is missing) should update topMostRobot to i, and set leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol to j. Then, for other robots in that same row, we check j against topMostRobotCol and update leftMostRobot. Wait, maybe topMostRobotCol is supposed to track the leftmost column in the topmost row. So when a new topmost row is found (i < topMostRobot), then topMostRobot is set to i, and leftMostRobot (the leftmost in that row) is set to j. Then, for subsequent robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), if j is less than leftMostRobot, then update leftMostRobot. But in the code, the code inside the first if (i < topMostRobot) is empty. So that's where the code is missing. The code needs to handle when a new topmost row is found, and update the leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol variables. Wait, the code has:\n\nif (i < topMostRobot) {\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n} So perhaps the variables are a bit mixed up. Let's re-express:\n\ntopMostRobot is the minimal row (i) of any robot. topMostRobotCol is the minimal column (j) of any robot in the topMostRobot row. leftMostRobot is perhaps a misnamed variable.",

The other robot in (1,0) has j=0 < leftMostRobot (1). So this would imply that when moving left 1 times, the topmost robot reaches column 0, but the other robot would have to move left once, going from 0 to -1, which is invalid. So in this case, the answer should be NO. But according to the code's current logic, the topMostRobotCol is 5 (since it's not updated), and for the robot (0,1), the code checks j=1 < 5 (yes), so leftMostRobot=1. For robot (1,0), j=0 <5 (yes), leftMostRobot=0. Then the code compares topMostRobotCol (5) > leftMostRobot (0) \u2192 5>0 \u2192 YES. So code outputs YES, which is wrong. So the code's logic is incorrect.",

Set topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nBut then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), check if j < topMostRobotCol (the leftmost j in the top row) and update leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol accordingly. Wait, in the code, after the initial check for i < topMostRobot, for the same row, the code checks j < topMostRobotCol. So perhaps:\n\nIn the if (i < topMostRobot) block:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThen, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol (current leftmost j in the top row). If yes, update leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nBut in the code, the code has:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n} But topMostRobotCol is set in the first block. So for example, when a new top row is found (i < current topMostRobot), topMostRobotCol is set to j. Then, for other robots in that row, if j is smaller than topMostRobotCol, then leftMostRobot is updated. Wait, that would work. Because topMostRobotCol tracks the minimal j in the top row. So when processing a robot in the top row (i == topMostRobot), if j is less than the current topMostRobotCol (which is the minimal j so far), then update leftMostRobot to j and set topMostRobotCol to j. But in the code's current code, topMostRobotCol is not being updated. So the code is missing that part. So the code's missing lines are in the if (i < topMostRobot) block: set topMostRobot to i, and set leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nThen, for the other robots in the same row, the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol (which is the current minimal j in the top row), and updates leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol accordingly. But in the code, the code is only setting leftMostRobot to j when j < topMostRobotCol. So the code needs to also update topMostRobotCol in that case. But the code as written doesn't do that. So there's a bug here. So the code should have: When a robot is found in the topmost row (i == topMostRobot):\n\n   if (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n       leftMostRobot = j;\n\n       topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n   }\n\nBut in the current code, the code only sets leftMostRobot to j, but doesn't update topMostRobotCol.

Then, for other robots in that row, the code will check if j is smaller than topMostRobotCol (now j), and update leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol accordingly. So the missing code is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nBut in the code, leftMostRobot is being set in the second if block (j < topMostRobotCol), so after setting topMostRobotCol to j in this block, the second if block may also set leftMostRobot to j again. But in this case, when processing the first robot in the new top row, j will be less than topMostRobotCol (which was previously set to 5), so leftMostRobot will be set to j again. But perhaps this is redundant, but it's acceptable. So the missing code inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nSo adding those three lines. After adding these lines, when a new top row is found, topMostRobot is set to i, leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol are set to j. Then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol (current minimal j in the row).",

But in the current code, the code only updates leftMostRobot, not topMostRobotCol. So that's a problem. Wait, no. Because after the missing code is added, the code inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block sets topMostRobotCol to j. Then, when processing a robot in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code will check if j < topMostRobotCol (current minimal j in the row). If yes, then leftMostRobot is set to j. But topMostRobotCol is not being updated here. So for example, if the first robot in the top row is j=2, then topMostRobotCol is 2. Then, a robot in j=1 of the same row will trigger j < topMostRobotCol (1 <2), so leftMostRobot is set to 1. But topMostRobotCol remains 2. So the code's variables are incorrect. So the code is missing an update to topMostRobotCol in the second if block. Thus, the code's current logic has two mistakes:\n\n1. In the if (i < topMostRobot) block, the code must set topMostRobot, leftMostRobot, and topMostRobotCol.\n\n2.",

But given that the code's current code is missing the lines in the if (i < topMostRobot) block, perhaps adding those lines will make the code work. So, the missing code inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nleftMostRobot = j; Wait, but then, leftMostRobot is being set to j, which is the column of the first robot in the top row. But in the code's second if block, leftMostRobot is updated for any robot with j < topMostRobotCol (which is j of the first robot in the top row). But in the code's second if block, j < topMostRobotCol (which is 5 initially), so for the first robot in the top row, j is compared to 5. Assuming i < topMostRobot (which is initially 5), the code enters the first block and sets topMostRobot to i, topMostRobotCol to j, and leftMostRobot to j. Then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code checks j < topMostRobotCol (which is now j of the first robot).",

But this is incorrect, because the code's leftMostRobot is the minimal j among all robots, and topMostRobotCol is the j of the first robot in the top row. So if the top row has a robot at j=2, and another robot at j=1 in a lower row, then leftMostRobot is 1, and topMostRobotCol is 2. Thus, code outputs NO, which is correct. But if the top row has a robot at j=1 and a robot at j=2 in a lower row, leftMostRobot is 1, topMostRobotCol is 1 \u2192 code outputs YES, which is correct. But if the top row has a robot at j=3 and a robot in the same row at j=2, the code's topMostRobotCol is 3, and leftMostRobot is 2 (due to the code's second if block). So code outputs YES. But the top row's robot at j=3 requires moving left 3 steps, but the robot in the same row at j=2 would require moving left 3 steps, ending at j= -1 \u2192 explosion. So the answer should be NO. But the code's logic would output YES, which is wrong. So the code's logic is incorrect. But given the code provided, perhaps the correct way to fill in the missing code is to update topMostRobot, leftMostRobot, and topMostRobotCol in the first if block. Thus, the missing code is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j; So the answer is to add these three lines inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block.",

Also, for any robot in the same row (i == topMostRobot), if j is less than leftMostRobot, update leftMostRobot.

Wait, maybe the code's variables are confused. Let's think again. The code has:\n\nint leftMostRobot =5;\n\nint topMostRobot=5;\n\nint topMostRobotCol=5;\n\nThen, for each robot (i,j):\n\nif (i < topMostRobot) {\n\n   // TODO: set topMostRobot, topMostRobotCol, and leftMostRobot?\n\n} if (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot =j;\n\n}\n\nBut the code is trying to track the leftmost robot in the topmost row. So when a robot is found in a higher row (i < current topMostRobot), the code should:\n\n- Set topMostRobot to i.\n\n- Set leftMostRobot to j (since this is the first robot in this new top row).\n\n- Set topMostRobotCol to j?

So when a new top row is found, leftMostRobot is reset to j, and topMostRobotCol is set to j. Then, for other robots in that row, j is compared to leftMostRobot (or topMostRobotCol?), and if j is smaller, leftMostRobot is updated. But in the code, after the first if block, the code checks if j is less than topMostRobotCol, which is initialized to 5. So for the first robot in the new top row (i=0), j=0. Then topMostRobotCol is 5, so 0 <5 is true. So leftMostRobot is set to 0. But then, when another robot in the same row (i=0, j=1) is processed, j is 1, which is not less than topMostRobotCol (still 5?), so leftMostRobot remains 0. But topMostRobotCol is not being updated here. So perhaps the code's logic is incorrect. The code is supposed to track the leftmost robot in the topmost row. So whenever a robot is in the topmost row (i == topMostRobot), and j is less than the current leftMostRobot, then leftMostRobot is updated to j. But in the code, after the first if block (i < topMostRobot), the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol. But topMostRobotCol is not updated in the code. So perhaps the code has a mistake here.

So any robot with a column j < leftMostRobot would violate this condition, leading to NO. But how does the code track this?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this Java code. Let's read the problem statement again. The goal is to determine if there's a way to move the robots such that at least one reaches the upper-left corner (0,0) without any robot exploding. \n\nLooking at the code, there's a loop that processes each test case. For each row and column, they check if the cell is 'R'. Then, they track the topMostRobot and leftMostRobot. Wait, the variables are named a bit confusingly. Let's see:\n\nThe code initializes leftMostRobot and topMostRobot to 5. Since the maximum possible rows and columns are 5 (since n and m are up to 5), maybe 5 is a placeholder for a high value. \n\nIn the for loop, for each 'R' found, they check if i (the row index) is less than topMostRobot. Then, there's a TODO here. Also, they check if j (the column index) is less than topMostRobotCol, which I think is a typo. Because topMostRobotCol should probably track the leftmost column. Wait, the variable leftMostRobot is being set when j is less than topMostRobotCol. That seems like a mistake. Because topMostRobotCol is supposed to track the column of the topmost robot. Or maybe the variable names are swapped here.\n\nWait, the variables might be tracking two things: the topmost robot's row and column, and the leftmost robot's column. Let me think. \n\nThe original idea here is that for a robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must not require moving more steps in the required directions than the chosen robot. Because when we send a command, all robots move. So the key is that there's at least one robot that is in a position such that all other robots are not in positions that would require moving more steps than this robot in any direction. Otherwise, when moving towards (0,0), other robots might go out of bounds.\n\nFor example, to reach (0,0), a robot would need to move up some times and left some times. Suppose the robot is at (a, b). Then, the number of up moves needed is a, and left moves is b. All other robots must not be to the left of (their required left moves) or above (their required up moves) compared to this robot. Otherwise, when moving left or up, those robots would be forced to step out of the grid.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find the robot with the smallest row index (topmost) and the smallest column index (leftmost). Wait, perhaps the earliest robot in the top-left that can be the candidate. Because the earliest such robot would require that all other robots are to the right and/or below it. That way, when you move left and up enough times to get this robot to (0,0), all other robots can move left and up as well without stepping out.\n\nSo the minimal required robot is the one that has the minimal row and column. Because if there's a robot at (x,y) such that x is the minimal row (i.e., the highest possible) and y is the minimal column (leftmost), then for any other robot (a,b), a >= x and b >= y. Then, moving up (x times) and left (y times) will bring this robot to (0,0), and all other robots will have to move up (x times) and left (y times). Since a >= x, moving up x times leaves them at (a - x, ...), which can't be negative. Similarly for columns. So their new positions would be (a-x, b - y). But since a >=x and b >=y, their positions after moving are non-negative. But also, during each step, they don't move out. Because each movement is done step by step. So if during each step (each command), all robots can move in that direction without stepping out, then it's possible.\n\nWait, but how do the commands work? Each command is a single direction, like move up, and all robots move once. So to get a robot from (x,y) to (0,0), we need x up commands and y left commands, in some order. But when executing these commands, after each step, all robots must not have gone out of bounds.\n\nSo for the chosen robot (x,y), any other robot (a,b) must satisfy a >= x (so that when you issue x up commands, the robot can move up x times without going out), and b >= y (so that y left commands can be done). Because if there's a robot at (a, b) where a < x, then when we issue up commands, that robot will have to move up more times than possible (since a is already less than x, and the first x up commands would make that robot move up a steps and then (x - a) steps, but that would take it beyond the grid, causing explosion).\n\nWait, this suggests that the candidate robot must be the one with the smallest row and column indices. Because any other robot must be in a row >= that robot's row, and column >= that robot's column. Otherwise, moving up and left enough times would cause some other robot to explode.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find the robot with the minimal row and among those, the minimal column. Then check if all other robots have row >= that robot's row and column >= that robot's column. Because when you move up exactly the robot's row times and left exactly the robot's column times, all other robots will have row coordinates >= 0 (since their original rows were >= the robot's row, subtract the robot's row steps, which is <= their rows). Similarly for columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Let's look at the code variables. \n\nIn the code:\n\nleftMostRobot is initialized to 5, which is the max possible m (since m can be up to 5). Then, for each 'R' found, if j (column index) is less than topMostRobotCol (which is probably a typo?), then set leftMostRobot to j. Hmm, maybe the variables are mixed up. \n\nWait, in the code:\n\nThey have:\n\nint leftMostRobot = 5;\nint topMostRobot = 5;\nint topMostRobotCol = 5;\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j) where it's 'R':\n\nif(i < topMostRobot){\n   // TODO\n}\n\nSo this part is checking if the current row is higher (smaller index) than the current topMostRobot. So if the current robot is higher (closer to top), then we need to update topMostRobot. But inside this if block, there's a TODO. So perhaps here, they need to set topMostRobot to i, and also track the column of this topmost robot. Because among all robots in the topmost row, we need the leftmost one. \n\nWait, maybe the logic is that the topmost robot (smallest i) is the candidate. Among all such topmost robots, the leftmost one (smallest j) is the candidate. Then, check if all other robots are to the right and/or below. Because if that's the case, then moving up (i times) and left (j times) will get the candidate to (0,0), and others are in rows >=i and columns >=j, so their movements are possible.\n\nSo the correct variables would be:\n\n- Find the topmost row (smallest i) where there's a robot. Among those robots in that row, find the leftmost column (smallest j). Then check that all other robots are in rows >= i and columns >= j.\n\nIf that's the case, then the code needs to track the topmost row (smallest i), and within that row, the leftmost column. Then check if all other robots have i >= topMostRobot and j >= leftMostRobotInTopRow.\n\nSo in the code, the variables are:\n\nleftMostRobot: perhaps the leftmost column among all robots in the topmost row.\n\ntopMostRobot: the row index of the topmost robot.\n\ntopMostRobotCol: perhaps a typo, maybe intended to track the column of the topmost robot. But the code has:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n}\n\nWait, that line is inside the loop for each 'R' cell. So if a robot is found at (i,j), then:\n\nif (i < topMostRobot) { ... }\n\nSo when i is smaller than the current topMostRobot, that means this robot is in a higher row. So we need to update topMostRobot to i, and then set topMostRobotCol to j (since this is the first robot in this new topmost row). But then, within the same row, if there's another robot with a smaller j (leftmost in that row), we need to track that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the topmost robot's row (topMostRobot) and the leftmost column in that topmost row (leftMostRobot). Then, the topMostRobotCol is a typo and should be leftMostRobot. Let me think.\n\nIn the code, the variables are:\n\nleftMostRobot initialized to 5.\n\nThen, for each robot (i,j):\n\nIf i is less than the current topMostRobot (so this is a higher row), then update the topMostRobot and the leftMostRobot (since this is the first robot in this higher row, so its column is the leftmost in that row). Then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), check if j is smaller than the current leftMostRobot, and update leftMostRobot accordingly.\n\nBut in the code, the current code inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block is empty. That's the missing code. So the first thing to do is, when a robot is found in a higher row (smaller i), we need to update topMostRobot to i, and set leftMostRobot to j (since this is the first robot in this row, but perhaps there could be a robot with a smaller j in the same row).\n\nWait, no. When a robot is found in a higher row (i < current topMostRobot), then the topMostRobot is updated to i. Then, for the leftMostRobot, which is the leftmost in this new top row, we need to track the minimal j in that row.\n\nBut the code, as it stands, has:\n\nfor each row i:\n\n   for each j in currentRow:\n\n      if (currentRow char is R):\n\n          if (i < topMostRobot):\n\n              // missing code here\n\n          if (j < topMostRobotCol):\n\n              leftMostRobot = j;\n\nBut the variables are named a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to track:\n\n- topMostRobot: the minimal row index (smallest i) where there's a robot.\n\n- leftMostRobot: the minimal column index (smallest j) among all robots in the topMostRobot row.\n\nThen, after collecting all robots, check if all other robots are in rows >= topMostRobot and columns >= leftMostRobot. If yes, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo the code needs to find the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Then check if all other robots are to the right (j >= leftMostRobot) and/or in lower rows (i >= topMostRobot).\n\nSo in the code:\n\nInitially, topMostRobot is set to 5 (a value larger than possible). For each robot (i,j), if i is less than the current topMostRobot, then this is a new topmost row. So we need to set topMostRobot to i, and reset the leftMostRobot to j. Then, within this row, check other robots and see if any have a smaller j.\n\nBut in the code, the current code for handling leftMostRobot is:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n}\n\nBut topMostRobotCol is initialized to 5. Wait, perhaps the variable names are mixed. Maybe leftMostRobot should track the minimal j in the topMost row. So when a robot is in the topmost row (i == topMostRobot), then check if j is less than leftMostRobot. So perhaps the code should have:\n\nWhen i == topMostRobot, compare j with leftMostRobot and update it if j is smaller.\n\nBut in the current code, after the initial check for i < topMostRobot, the code then checks j < topMostRobotCol (which is initialized to 5). So when a robot is in a higher row (i < topMostRobot), the code inside the if block (which is missing) should update topMostRobot to i, and set leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol to j. Then, for other robots in that same row, we check j against topMostRobotCol and update leftMostRobot. Wait, maybe topMostRobotCol is supposed to track the leftmost column in the topmost row. So when a new topmost row is found (i < topMostRobot), then topMostRobot is set to i, and leftMostRobot (the leftmost in that row) is set to j. Then, for subsequent robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), if j is less than leftMostRobot, then update leftMostRobot.\n\nBut in the code, the code inside the first if (i < topMostRobot) is empty. So that's where the code is missing. The code needs to handle when a new topmost row is found, and update the leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol variables.\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nif (i < topMostRobot) {\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n}\n\nSo perhaps the variables are a bit mixed up. Let's re-express:\n\ntopMostRobot is the minimal row (i) of any robot.\n\ntopMostRobotCol is the minimal column (j) of any robot in the topMostRobot row.\n\nleftMostRobot is perhaps a misnamed variable. Because in the code, when j is less than topMostRobotCol, leftMostRobot is set to j. So perhaps topMostRobotCol is the current minimal j in the topmost row, and leftMostRobot is supposed to track that. So the code is using leftMostRobot to track the minimal j in the topmost row. Then, after processing all robots, if topMostRobotCol (the minimal j in the topmost row) is greater than leftMostRobot, which doesn't make sense. Wait, in the code's output decision:\n\nif (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) {\n\n   System.out.println(\"NO\");\n\n} else {\n\n   System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n}\n\nBut this logic is unclear. Wait, perhaps the code is comparing the leftmost column in the topmost row (which is stored in leftMostRobot) to some other variable. But the code has a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to track two variables: the leftmost column of all robots (leftMostRobot) and the topmost row (topMostRobot). But that's not correct. The correct approach is to find the topmost robot, and among those, the leftmost, then check all other robots are in the same or lower rows and same or right columns.\n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect as written. Let's see. For example, in the first sample input of the problem:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6\n1 3\nRRE\n3 3\nEEE\nEEE\nERR\n2 2\nER\nRE\n1 1\nR\n3 4\nEERE\nEREE\nREEE\n2 2\nRE\nER\n\nSample Output:\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nFor the first test case, the input is 1 row and 3 columns: RRE. The robots are in columns 0 and 1 (assuming 0-based) but wait, the input is \"RRE\" so indexes 0,1,2. The first cell is R (0), second R (1), third E (2). The topmost row is 0. The leftmost in that row is 0. So all robots are in rows >=0 and columns >=0, which is true. So output YES.\n\nBut according to the code's current logic, after processing all robots, they check if topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot. But in this case, the leftMostRobot would be 0 (the minimal j in the topmost row). So topMostRobotCol (what is this variable?) If in the code, when a new topmost row is found, they set topMostRobot to i, and then track the leftmost j in that row. So in the first test case, the leftMostRobot would be 0, and topMostRobotCol is 0. So the condition topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot is 0>0, which is false. So code would output YES. Which is correct.\n\nBut how is the code setting these variables?\n\nIn the code:\n\nInitially, leftMostRobot=5, topMostRobot=5, topMostRobotCol=5.\n\nProcessing the first R in (0,0):\n\ni=0 is less than topMostRobot (5). So enter the if block. The missing code here is supposed to update topMostRobot and other variables.\n\nIn the TODO section, the code needs to set topMostRobot to i (0), and set the leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol to j (0). Then, for the next R in (0,1):\n\ni=0 is equal to topMostRobot (0). So the first if is not entered. Then, check if j (1) < topMostRobotCol (0) (since topMostRobotCol is set to 5 initially?), no. So leftMostRobot remains 0.\n\nWait, but topMostRobotCol is 5 initially. So for the first R (0,0), after the if (i < topMostRobot) block (which is executed), the code would then check if j (0) < topMostRobotCol (5). Yes, so set leftMostRobot to 0. Then, topMostRobotCol would be 5, but the code isn't updating it. So the code's variables are not being set correctly.\n\nThis indicates that the code has a bug here. The variables leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol are not being tracked correctly.\n\nThe problem is that the code is using topMostRobotCol to track the minimal j in the topmost row. But when a new topmost row is found (i < current topMostRobot), then the code needs to reset the leftMostRobot (the minimal j in that row) to j, and track the column. Then, for other robots in that same row, j's are compared to the current leftMostRobot (minimal j) and updated if smaller.\n\nSo, in the code, the variables should be:\n\ntopMostRobot: the minimal row i.\n\nleftMostRobot: the minimal j in the topMost row.\n\nSo when a robot is found in a row i < topMostRobot, then set topMostRobot to i, and leftMostRobot to j. Also, for any robot in the same row (i == topMostRobot), if j is less than leftMostRobot, update leftMostRobot.\n\nBut in the code, the code after checking i < topMostRobot, checks j against topMostRobotCol. Which is probably a mistake, since topMostRobotCol is not tracking anything useful.\n\nWait, maybe the code's variables are confused. Let's think again. The code has:\n\nint leftMostRobot =5;\n\nint topMostRobot=5;\n\nint topMostRobotCol=5;\n\nThen, for each robot (i,j):\n\nif (i < topMostRobot) {\n\n   // TODO: set topMostRobot, topMostRobotCol, and leftMostRobot?\n\n}\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot =j;\n\n}\n\nBut the code is trying to track the leftmost robot in the topmost row. So when a robot is found in a higher row (i < current topMostRobot), the code should:\n\n- Set topMostRobot to i.\n\n- Set leftMostRobot to j (since this is the first robot in this new top row).\n\n- Set topMostRobotCol to j? Not sure. Or perhaps topMostRobotCol is intended to track the leftmost j in the top row. So when a new top row is found, leftMostRobot is reset to j, and topMostRobotCol is set to j. Then, for other robots in that row, j is compared to leftMostRobot (or topMostRobotCol?), and if j is smaller, leftMostRobot is updated.\n\nBut in the code, after the first if block, the code checks if j is less than topMostRobotCol, which is initialized to 5. So for the first robot in the new top row (i=0), j=0. Then topMostRobotCol is 5, so 0 <5 is true. So leftMostRobot is set to 0. But then, when another robot in the same row (i=0, j=1) is processed, j is 1, which is not less than topMostRobotCol (still 5?), so leftMostRobot remains 0.\n\nBut topMostRobotCol is not being updated here. So perhaps the code's logic is incorrect. The code is supposed to track the leftmost robot in the topmost row. So whenever a robot is in the topmost row (i == topMostRobot), and j is less than the current leftMostRobot, then leftMostRobot is updated to j. But in the code, after the first if block (i < topMostRobot), the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol. But topMostRobotCol is not updated in the code. So perhaps the code has a mistake here. The variable topMostRobotCol is not being set to the leftmost j of the topmost row.\n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is incorrect, and the missing code is to update the variables correctly when a new topmost row is found.\n\nSo, the code's missing part is when i < topMostRobot:\n\nInside that if block, the code should set:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nWait, but why set topMostRobotCol to j? Maybe because the code is using topMostRobotCol as a temporary variable. Alternatively, perhaps the code's variables are named incorrectly, and the code should track the leftMostRobot (the minimal j in the topmost row) and the topMostRobot (the minimal i). Then, the code's final check is whether the leftMostRobot is <= all other j's in their respective rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are:\n\ntopMostRobot: the minimal i (highest row) of any robot.\n\nleftMostRobot: the minimal j in the topmost row.\n\nThen, after processing all robots, check if all robots have j >= leftMostRobot and i >= topMostRobot.\n\nIf this is the case, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo the code's current logic is:\n\nIf the leftmost robot in the topmost row is the leftmost overall, then all other robots must have j >= leftMostRobot and i >= topMostRobot.\n\nBut how is the code tracking this?\n\nIn the code, after processing all robots, the code checks if topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot. If yes, output NO. Otherwise YES.\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense. Because topMostRobotCol is being compared to leftMostRobot. But what do these variables represent?\n\nPerhaps the code has a mistake here, and the final check should be whether all robots are to the right or in the same column as the leftMostRobot in the top row, and in rows equal to or below the topmost row.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's final condition is correct if the leftMostRobot is the minimal j in the topmost row, and the topMostRobotCol is tracking the minimal j of any robot. Then, if the minimal j of any robot is to the left of the leftmost in the top row (i.e., there exists a robot in a lower row but with a smaller j), then the answer is NO. But that's not the correct logic.\n\nWait, the correct logic is that all robots must be in rows >= topMostRobot and columns >= leftMostRobot (the minimal j in the topmost row). So any robot with a column j < leftMostRobot would violate this condition, leading to NO.\n\nBut how does the code track this? The code's current check is whether topMostRobotCol (which is initialized to 5) is greater than leftMostRobot. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are named incorrectly, and the correct code should compare whether the minimal j in the top row (leftMostRobot) is such that all other robots have j >= leftMostRobot and i >= topMostRobot.\n\nBut the code in its current state is not checking that. It's only checking if topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot.\n\nSo the code's logic is flawed, but the missing code is in the if (i < topMostRobot) block.\n\nSo back to the original code. The code has:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   initialize leftMostRobot=5, topMostRobot=5, topMostRobotCol=5.\n\n   for each row i:\n\n      read the row.\n\n      for each j in the row:\n\n          if cell is 'R':\n\n              if (i < topMostRobot):\n\n                  // missing code here.\n\n              if (j < topMostRobotCol):\n\n                  leftMostRobot = j;\n\n   then, check if topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot. If yes, output NO, else YES.\n\nBut this logic is incorrect. For example, the code's topMostRobotCol is initialized to 5, and for each 'R' found, if j is less than topMostRobotCol, set leftMostRobot to j. But topMostRobotCol is not being updated. So this condition will check all robots, not just those in the topmost row.\n\nSo for example, if there's a robot in a lower row (i=1, j=0) and the topmost row is i=0, j=1. Then, the leftMostRobot would be 0 (since j=0 is less than topMostRobotCol which is 5). But the robot in i=1, j=0 has j < leftMostRobot of the topmost row (1), but since it's in a lower row, that's allowed. Wait no. Because for the robot in the topmost row (0,1), the leftMostRobot is 1. The other robot in (1,0) has j=0 < leftMostRobot (1). So this would imply that when moving left 1 times, the topmost robot reaches column 0, but the other robot would have to move left once, going from 0 to -1, which is invalid. So in this case, the answer should be NO.\n\nBut according to the code's current logic, the topMostRobotCol is 5 (since it's not updated), and for the robot (0,1), the code checks j=1 < 5 (yes), so leftMostRobot=1. For robot (1,0), j=0 <5 (yes), leftMostRobot=0. Then the code compares topMostRobotCol (5) > leftMostRobot (0) \u2192 5>0 \u2192 YES. So code outputs YES, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect. The problem is that the code is checking all robots, not just those in the topmost row.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Then check that all other robots are in rows >= topmost row and columns >= leftmost column of the topmost row.\n\nThus, in the code, the variables should track:\n\ntopMostRobot: the minimal i.\n\nleftMostRobot: minimal j in the topMost row.\n\nThen, for all robots (i,j), we need to ensure that i >= topMostRobot and j >= leftMostRobot.\n\nIf that's true, then answer YES.\n\nSo the code's variables are set correctly if:\n\nIn the code, when a robot is found in a row less than the current topMostRobot (i < topMostRobot), then we update topMostRobot to i, and set leftMostRobot to j (since this is the first robot in this new top row). Then, for other robots in this same row, we check if their j is smaller than leftMostRobot, and update leftMostRobot accordingly.\n\nSo in the code, inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block, we need to set topMostRobot to i, and set leftMostRobot to j (since this is the first robot in this row). Also, perhaps reset some other variable. Then, for other robots in the same row, check if j < leftMostRobot and update.\n\nBut in the code, the code after the first if block has:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n}\n\nBut what is topMostRobotCol here? Perhaps the code intended to track the leftMostRobot in the top row. So when a robot is in the top row, compare j with leftMostRobot, and update if smaller.\n\nBut the code's variables are not being managed correctly.\n\nSo the missing code in the if (i < topMostRobot) block is:\n\nSet topMostRobot to i.\n\nSet leftMostRobot to j.\n\nAlso, perhaps set topMostRobotCol to j (but that's not necessary if we are using leftMostRobot as the minimal j in the top row).\n\nBut then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), we need to check if j is less than leftMostRobot (the current minimal j in the top row), and update leftMostRobot.\n\nBut in the current code, after the if (i < topMostRobot) block, the code checks j < topMostRobotCol, which is not tracking the leftmost j in the top row.\n\nSo this suggests that the code's variables are not named correctly, leading to incorrect comparisons.\n\nThe correct code would need to:\n\nInitialize topMostRobot to a high value (like 5).\n\nInitialize leftMostRobot to a high value (like 5).\n\nFor each robot (i,j):\n\n   if i < topMostRobot:\n\n       topMostRobot = i;\n\n       leftMostRobot = j;\n\n   else if i == topMostRobot:\n\n       if j < leftMostRobot:\n\n           leftMostRobot = j;\n\nSo this way, after processing all robots, leftMostRobot is the minimal j in the topmost row (minimal i).\n\nThen, we need to check all robots to see if their i >= topMostRobot and j >= leftMostRobot.\n\nBut how to do this in the code? The code as written doesn't track all robots. It just tracks the minimal i and j in the top row.\n\nBut the code's current approach is to compute these variables and then check if topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot, which seems incorrect.\n\nAh, perhaps the code has a mistake in the variable names and logic. For example, the code's leftMostRobot variable is actually tracking the leftmost j across all robots, not just those in the top row. But that would not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is:\n\nIf the leftmost robot in the top row (leftMostRobot) is such that there is another robot to the left of it (but in a lower row), then this robot would have j < leftMostRobot. But since the robot is in a lower row, moving up won't affect it. However, when moving left, the robot in the lower row could end up moving left past the required steps. Wait, no. For example, if the top robot is at (0,1) and another robot is at (1,0). The leftMostRobot is 1. When moving left once to get the top robot to (0,0), the robot at (1,0) would move left once to (1,-1), which is invalid, causing an explosion. So the answer would be NO.\n\nBut according to the code's current logic, the leftMostRobot is 0 (because the code's code is checking j < topMostRobotCol (which is 5) for all robots). Then, the code would check if topMostRobotCol (5) is > leftMostRobot (0), which is true. So code outputs NO. Which is correct in this case.\n\nBut how is this possible?\n\nWait, the code's logic seems to be:\n\nFor all robots, track the leftmost j (leftMostRobot) and the topmost row (topMostRobot). Then, check if there exists a robot in the topmost row (i == topMostRobot) with j < leftMostRobot. Because if such a robot exists, then that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Maybe the code's logic is that the leftmost robot in the topmost row must be the leftmost overall. Because if there's a robot in a lower row with j < leftMostRobot, then when moving left, that robot would have to move j steps, which might not be possible.\n\nBut this is not correct. For example, the robot in lower row can have j >= leftMostRobot of the top row. So the code's current logic is incorrect.\n\nBut given that the code's output decision is:\n\nif (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) \u2192 output NO.\n\nBut how is topMostRobotCol determined?\n\nThe code's current code for setting leftMostRobot is:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) \u2192 set leftMostRobot to j.\n\nBut topMostRobotCol is initialized to 5 and never updated. So this condition is checking for j < 5, which is always true. So leftMostRobot is set to the minimal j of all robots.\n\nThen, the code checks if topMostRobotCol (5) > leftMostRobot (minimal j of all robots). Which is true, so output NO. But that's not correct.\n\nBut in the first sample input case, the minimal j is 0. So 5>0 is true, code outputs NO. But the correct answer is YES.\n\nSo this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect, but perhaps the code is missing the part where topMostRobotCol is set to the j of the topmost row's leftmost robot.\n\nSo, the code's missing part is in the if (i < topMostRobot) block. There, we need to:\n\n1. Update topMostRobot to i.\n\n2. Set leftMostRobot to j.\n\n3. Set topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nBut then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), check if j < topMostRobotCol (the leftmost j in the top row) and update leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol accordingly.\n\nWait, in the code, after the initial check for i < topMostRobot, for the same row, the code checks j < topMostRobotCol. So perhaps:\n\nIn the if (i < topMostRobot) block:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThen, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol (current leftmost j in the top row). If yes, update leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nBut in the code, the code has:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n}\n\nBut topMostRobotCol is set in the first block. So for example, when a new top row is found (i < current topMostRobot), topMostRobotCol is set to j. Then, for other robots in that row, if j is smaller than topMostRobotCol, then leftMostRobot is updated.\n\nWait, that would work. Because topMostRobotCol tracks the minimal j in the top row. So when processing a robot in the top row (i == topMostRobot), if j is less than the current topMostRobotCol (which is the minimal j so far), then update leftMostRobot to j and set topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nBut in the code's current code, topMostRobotCol is not being updated. So the code is missing that part.\n\nSo the code's missing lines are in the if (i < topMostRobot) block: set topMostRobot to i, and set leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nThen, for the other robots in the same row, the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol (which is the current minimal j in the top row), and updates leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol accordingly.\n\nBut in the code, the code is only setting leftMostRobot to j when j < topMostRobotCol. So the code needs to also update topMostRobotCol in that case.\n\nBut the code as written doesn't do that. So there's a bug here.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nWhen a robot is found in the topmost row (i == topMostRobot):\n\n   if (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n       leftMostRobot = j;\n\n       topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n   }\n\nBut in the current code, the code only sets leftMostRobot to j, but doesn't update topMostRobotCol. So topMostRobotCol remains at 5, leading to incorrect comparisons.\n\nThus, the code's variables are not being managed correctly.\n\nBut given that the code is provided and the problem is to fill in the missing code in the TODO section, let's focus on the missing part.\n\nThe missing code is inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block. So when a robot is found in a higher row (i < current topMostRobot), the code needs to:\n\n- Update topMostRobot to i.\n\n- Update leftMostRobot to j.\n\n- Also, update topMostRobotCol to j.\n\nBecause when a new top row is found, the minimal j in that row is j. Then, for other robots in that row, the code will check if j is smaller than topMostRobotCol (now j), and update leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol accordingly.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nBut in the code, leftMostRobot is being set in the second if block (j < topMostRobotCol), so after setting topMostRobotCol to j in this block, the second if block may also set leftMostRobot to j again. But in this case, when processing the first robot in the new top row, j will be less than topMostRobotCol (which was previously set to 5), so leftMostRobot will be set to j again. But perhaps this is redundant, but it's acceptable.\n\nSo the missing code inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nSo adding those three lines.\n\nAfter adding these lines, when a new top row is found, topMostRobot is set to i, leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol are set to j. Then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol (current minimal j in the row). If yes, leftMostRobot is updated to j and topMostRobotCol is updated as well. But in the current code, the code only updates leftMostRobot, not topMostRobotCol. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Because after the missing code is added, the code inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block sets topMostRobotCol to j. Then, when processing a robot in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code will check if j < topMostRobotCol (current minimal j in the row). If yes, then leftMostRobot is set to j. But topMostRobotCol is not being updated here. So for example, if the first robot in the top row is j=2, then topMostRobotCol is 2. Then, a robot in j=1 of the same row will trigger j < topMostRobotCol (1 <2), so leftMostRobot is set to 1. But topMostRobotCol remains 2. So the code's variables are incorrect.\n\nSo the code is missing an update to topMostRobotCol in the second if block.\n\nThus, the code's current logic has two mistakes:\n\n1. In the if (i < topMostRobot) block, the code must set topMostRobot, leftMostRobot, and topMostRobotCol.\n\n2. In the second if block (j < topMostRobotCol), the code must update both leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol.\n\nBut the code provided only updates leftMostRobot in the second if block.\n\nThis is a problem. So the code's variables are not being tracked correctly. But the code provided has the second if block:\n\nif (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   leftMostRobot = j;\n\n}\n\nBut to correctly track topMostRobotCol, the code should also set topMostRobotCol to j in this case.\n\nBut the code provided doesn't have that.\n\nSo the code has a bug here, but the user's task is to fill in the missing code in the TODO block.\n\nAssuming that the rest of the code is correct except for the missing lines, perhaps the code's logic is to track the leftMostRobot as the leftmost in the top row, and topMostRobotCol as the same as leftMostRobot. Then, the final check is whether the leftMostRobot is the leftmost possible (i.e., there's no robot in the top row to the left of it). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's final check is comparing the leftMostRobot (leftmost in top row) with the leftmost robot in the entire grid. If the leftmost robot in the entire grid is to the left of the leftmost in the top row, then output NO. Because this implies that there's a robot in a lower row but to the left of the leftmost in the top row. So when moving left to get the top row's robot to 0, this other robot would have to move left more times than possible.\n\nYes! For example, if the top row's leftmost is at column 2, but there's a robot in a lower row at column 1. Then, when moving left 2 times to get the top robot to 0, the lower robot would move left 2 times, which would take it from 1 to -1 (exploding). So this is invalid. So the code's final check is whether the leftmost robot in the entire grid is to the left of the leftmost in the top row. If yes, output NO. Else, YES.\n\nBut how is the code tracking the leftmost robot in the entire grid? The code's current leftMostRobot variable is being set to the minimal j in the top row, but the code's code has a mistake in the second if block.\n\nWait, no. Because in the current code's second if block, for every robot, if j is less than topMostRobotCol (which is initialized to 5), then leftMostRobot is set to j. So after processing all robots, leftMostRobot is the minimal j of all robots. Because topMostRobotCol remains at 5, so all robots' j are compared to 5, and leftMostRobot is set to the minimal j in all robots.\n\nThen, topMostRobotCol is the minimal j in the top row. Because in the if (i < topMostRobot) block, topMostRobotCol is set to j (the j of the first robot in the new top row). Then, for other robots in that row, the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol (which is the current minimal j in that row). If so, leftMostRobot is set to j (but topMostRobotCol is not updated). So topMostRobotCol is not tracking the minimal j in the top row. This is a bug.\n\nBut given that the code's final check is if (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) \u2192 NO. If leftMostRobot is the minimal j of all robots, and topMostRobotCol is the minimal j in the top row, then topMostRobotCol is >= leftMostRobot. Because the minimal j overall could be in a lower row, but left than the minimal j in the top row.\n\nIn that case, topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot would be true, and the code would output NO, which is correct. Because there's a robot in a lower row with j < topMostRobotCol (the minimal j in the top row), which would explode when moving left enough times to bring the top row's robot to column 0.\n\nSo the code's final check is correct. It checks whether the leftmost robot in the top row (topMostRobotCol) is greater than the overall leftmost robot (leftMostRobot). If so, then there exists a robot in a lower row to the left of the top row's leftmost robot, which would cause explosions when moving left. So the answer is NO.\n\nOtherwise, if the top row's leftmost robot is the overall leftmost (topMostRobotCol == leftMostRobot), or if the leftmost robot is in the top row (topMostRobotCol is the leftmost), then answer is YES.\n\nBut how does the code track topMostRobotCol?\n\nIn the code's current code, topMostRobotCol is initialized to 5. Then, when a new top row is found (i < topMostRobot), the code's missing lines need to set topMostRobotCol to j. Then, for other robots in the same row, the code checks if j < topMostRobotCol. If yes, then leftMostRobot is set to j (but topMostRobotCol is not updated). So topMostRobotCol remains as the j of the first robot in the top row. So this would be incorrect.\n\nFor example, if the top row has robots at j=2 and j=1. The first robot in the top row is j=2. Then, topMostRobotCol is 2. The second robot in the same row is j=1. Since 1 < topMostRobotCol (2), the code sets leftMostRobot to 1. But topMostRobotCol remains 2. So the code's final check is topMostRobotCol (2) > leftMostRobot (1) \u2192 true \u2192 output NO. But this is incorrect, because the top row's leftmost robot is 1. So the correct answer is YES.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, it would output NO, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect, but the user's task is to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code is correct, but the variables are named incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are intended to track:\n\n- topMostRobot: the row of the topmost robot.\n\n- leftMostRobot: the leftmost column among all robots.\n\n- topMostRobotCol: the leftmost column in the topmost row.\n\nThen, the code's final check is whether the leftmost column in the top row (topMostRobotCol) is greater than the overall leftmost robot (leftMostRobot). If so, output NO, else YES.\n\nBut the code's variables are not being managed correctly.\n\nBut given that the code's current code is missing the lines in the if (i < topMostRobot) block, perhaps adding those lines will make the code work.\n\nSo, the missing code inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\nWait, but then, leftMostRobot is being set to j, which is the column of the first robot in the top row. But in the code's second if block, leftMostRobot is updated for any robot with j < topMostRobotCol (which is j of the first robot in the top row).\n\nBut in the code's second if block, j < topMostRobotCol (which is 5 initially), so for the first robot in the top row, j is compared to 5. Assuming i < topMostRobot (which is initially 5), the code enters the first block and sets topMostRobot to i, topMostRobotCol to j, and leftMostRobot to j. Then, for other robots in the same row (i == topMostRobot), the code checks j < topMostRobotCol (which is now j of the first robot). If yes, leftMostRobot is set to j (but topMostRobotCol is not updated). So the code's topMostRobotCol remains as the j of the first robot in the top row, which may not be the leftmost in that row.\n\nSo this approach would fail to correctly track the leftmost robot in the top row.\n\nThus, the code's logic is flawed. However, given that the code's final check is comparing topMostRobotCol to leftMostRobot, and the missing code is to set these variables correctly, perhaps the correct code is:\n\nInside the if (i < topMostRobot) block:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\nThen, for other robots in the same row, the code's second if block (j < topMostRobotCol) will update leftMostRobot to j if j is smaller. But topMostRobotCol is not updated, so it's possible that topMostRobotCol remains higher than the actual leftmost in the top row.\n\nThus, the code's final check would compare the initial j of the first robot in the top row (topMostRobotCol) with the overall leftmost robot (leftMostRobot). If leftMostRobot is smaller than topMostRobotCol (meaning there's a robot to the left of the first robot in the top row), then output NO.\n\nBut this is incorrect. For example, if the top row has robots at j=2 and j=1. The first robot is at j=2 (topMostRobotCol=2). The second robot is j=1, so j < topMostRobotCol (2), so leftMostRobot is set to 1. Then, the code's final check is topMostRobotCol (2) > leftMostRobot (1) \u2192 true \u2192 output NO, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect. The correct final check should be whether the leftmost robot in the top row (topMostRobotCol) is greater than the leftmost robot in the entire grid (leftMostRobot). If yes, then there exists a robot in a lower row to the left of the top row's leftmost, which would explode. So output NO.\n\nBut the code's topMostRobotCol is not tracking the leftmost in the top row. It's tracking the j of the first robot in the top row.\n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect, but the user's task is to fill in the missing code. Given that, perhaps the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the if (i < topMostRobot) block:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThen, the code's second if block (j < topMostRobotCol) will update leftMostRobot to j for any robot in the same row that is more to the left than the initial j. But since topMostRobotCol is not updated, subsequent robots in the same row will compare against the initial j, not the updated j.\n\nThis leads to incorrect behavior. So the code's logic is incorrect, but perhaps the intended approach was to track the leftmost robot in the top row as topMostRobotCol and the leftmost robot overall as leftMostRobot. Then, if topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot, there's a robot to the left of the top row's leftmost, so output NO.\n\nBut this is correct, because moving left enough to bring the top row's leftmost robot to 0 would require moving left topMostRobotCol steps. If there's a robot in a lower row with j < topMostRobotCol, then after moving left topMostRobotCol steps, that robot's new column is j - topMostRobotCol < 0, which is invalid.\n\nSo the code's final check is correct. Thus, the code's variables are:\n\nleftMostRobot: the minimal j among all robots.\n\ntopMostRobotCol: the j of the first robot in the top row.\n\nBut this is incorrect, because the code's leftMostRobot is the minimal j among all robots, and topMostRobotCol is the j of the first robot in the top row. So if the top row has a robot at j=2, and another robot at j=1 in a lower row, then leftMostRobot is 1, and topMostRobotCol is 2. Thus, code outputs NO, which is correct.\n\nBut if the top row has a robot at j=1 and a robot at j=2 in a lower row, leftMostRobot is 1, topMostRobotCol is 1 \u2192 code outputs YES, which is correct.\n\nBut if the top row has a robot at j=3 and a robot in the same row at j=2, the code's topMostRobotCol is 3, and leftMostRobot is 2 (due to the code's second if block). So code outputs YES. But the top row's robot at j=3 requires moving left 3 steps, but the robot in the same row at j=2 would require moving left 3 steps, ending at j= -1 \u2192 explosion. So the answer should be NO. But the code's logic would output YES, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nBut given the code provided, perhaps the correct way to fill in the missing code is to update topMostRobot, leftMostRobot, and topMostRobotCol in the first if block.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\nleftMostRobot = j;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nSo the answer is to add these three lines inside the if (i < topMostRobot) block."
