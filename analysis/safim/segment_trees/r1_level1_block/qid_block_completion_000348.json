For i=3: ceil(3/2)=2. i=4: 2. i=5:3, etc. So for even i: i/2. For odd i: (i+1)/2. So let's split into even and odd terms. Let me see.",

Wait, for example, n=4: 1,2,3,4. Two even (2,4) and two odd (1,3). So for n even, the number of even and odd terms is equal to n/2 each. If n is odd, then there are (n+1)/2 terms. For example, n=5: 1,2,3,4,5. Three odd terms (1,3,5) and two even terms (2,4). So the sum can be calculated as:\n\nsum = (sum of odd terms) + (sum of even terms). For even terms (i even): ceil(i/2) = i/2. So for even i, it's exactly i/2. For odd terms (i odd): ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. So for i=2k-1, ceil(i/2) = k.\n\nLet's compute the sum for even and odd terms separately. Let's say the number of odd terms up to n is m. For example, when n is even, m = n/2. Wait no. Let's compute m:\n\nThe number of odd numbers from 1 to n is (n +1 )// 2. Because:\n\nIf n is even: numbers 1,3,...,n-1. Total n/2 terms. (n+1)//2 is (even+1)/2 = (n/2) + 0.5 \u2192 but integer division would be n/2. Wait, for n even, (n+1)/2 is (even +1)/2, which is 0.5 more than n/2. But integer division would truncate. Wait, for example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Which is correct for the number of odd terms (1,3 \u2192 2 terms). Wait, perhaps m = (n + 1) // 2. Let's check:\n\nn even: (even +1)//2 = (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 floor is 2. Correct for n=4. n odd: say n=5. (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct (1,3,5 \u2192 3 terms). So the number of odd terms is m = (n +1)//2. Each odd term contributes (i+1)/2. Let's find the sum of those terms. For i being 1,3,5,..., up to n if n is odd, or n-1 if even. Wait, when i is odd, i can be written as 2k-1, where k ranges from 1 to m. So for each k, the term is (2k-1 +1)/2 = 2k/2 = k. So the sum of all odd terms is sum_{k=1 to m} k = m(m+1)/2. Wait, that's a key insight! Because each odd i (like 1,3,5) contributes k where k is 1,2,3, etc. So for m odd terms, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m = m(m+1)/2. What about even terms? For even i, ceil(i/2) is i/2. The even terms are 2,4,6,... up to n if even, or n-1 if odd. So for even i, the sum is sum_{i=2,4,...,2p} (i/2) where p is the number of even terms. Let p be the number of even terms. The even terms are 2,4,6,...,2p. Because 2p <= n. So p = n//2. For example, n=5: even terms are 2 and 4 \u2192 p=2. The sum for even terms is sum_{k=1 to p} (2k)/2 = sum_{k=1 to p} k = p(p+1)/2. So total sum is:\n\nsum = (m(m+1)/2) + (p(p+1)/2), where m = (n+1)//2, p = n//2. But m and p are related. Let's see:\n\nFor n even:\n\nn = 2k. Then m = (2k +1)/2 \u2192 integer division gives k. Because (2k+1)//2 is k.0.5, but integer division truncates. Wait, 2k is even, (2k +1) is 2k+1. Divided by 2 gives k + 0.5. But integer division would truncate to k. So m = k.\n\np is n//2 = k. So m = k, p =k.\n\nsum for even n is [k(k+1)/2] + [k(k+1)/2] = k(k+1) = (k^2 +k). Which is equal to (n/2)*(n/2 +1). But for n even, n=2k, sum is k*(k+1) = (2k/2)*(2k/2 +1) = k*(k+1). For n odd: n=2k+1. Then m = (2k+2)/2 \u2192 (k+1). p = (2k+1)//2 = k. So sum is [(k+1)(k+2)/2] + [k(k+1)/2] = [ (k+1)(k+2 +k) ) ] /2 \u2192 (k+1)(2k+2)/2 \u2192 (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. But k can be expressed as (n-1)/2. So sum is (( (n-1)/2 +1 ))^2 \u2192 ( (n+1)/2 )^2. Wait, for n=5 (odd), m=(5+1)/2=3, p=5//2=2. Sum for odd terms: 3*4/2 =6. Even terms: 2*3/2=3. Total sum 9 \u2192 3\u00b2. Which matches ( (5+1)/2 )\u00b2 \u2192 3\u00b2=9. Yes. So putting it all together, the sum S(n) is: If n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 +1) \u2192 [k*(k+1) where k = n/2]\n\nIf n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2. So the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n//2) * ( (n//2) +1 ) ) + ( ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+1)//2 +1 ) ) ) / 2 ? Wait, no. Wait, earlier analysis shows that for even n, sum is k*(k+1) where k =n/2. For odd n, sum is (k+1)^2 where k = (n-1)/2 \u2192 which is ( (n+1)/2 )^2. But how to express this in terms of m and p. Wait, m is (n+1)//2, p is n//2. So for even n, m = p. Because n even: (n+1)//2 = n/2 if n is even? Wait, n=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. So m=2, p=4//2=2. So m=p for even n.\n\nSo sum for even n is m*(m+1) \u2192 since m =p =n/2. For odd n, m = (n+1)/2. Then sum is m\u00b2. So overall, sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nS(n) = m^2 if n is odd, else m*(m+1), where m = (n+1)//2.",

Sum is either m\u00b2 (if n is odd) or m*(m+1) (if even), where m = (n+1)//2. Wait, but when n is even, m = (n+1)//2 = n/2 + 0.5? For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor to 2. So m=2. So sum is 2*3=6. Then s^2 \u22646 \u2192 s=2, since 2^2=4 \u22646, 3^2=9>6. But what if sum is m*(m+1), then the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(m*(m+1)). Alternatively, let's think about the sum S(n) and compute s as the floor of sqrt(S(n)). But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, for even n:\n\nsum = m*(m+1). So s is the integer part of sqrt(m*(m+1)). For example, m=2 \u2192 sum=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)=~2.449, s=2. For m=3: sum=12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=~3.464 \u2192 s=3. But sqrt(m*(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So the floor is m.\n\nWait, sqrt(m*(m+1)) is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) which is less than m+1, since m\u00b2 +m < m\u00b2 + 2m +1 = (m+1)^2. So the floor of sqrt(m*(m+1)) is m. So for even n, sum is m*(m+1), and s = floor(sqrt(sum)) = m.\n\nWait, let's see: m=2: sum=6, sqrt(6)=~2.45 \u2192 floor is 2. Which is m.\n\nm=3: sum=12, sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3, which is m. Yes. So for even n, s = m.\n\nFor odd n, sum is m\u00b2. So s = m. So in both cases, s is equal to m.\n\nWait, that's a critical insight. Let me check. When n is even, sum is m*(m+1). So the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum is m, because m\u00b2 \u2264 m(m+1) < (m+1)^2. For example, m=2: 2\u00b2=4 \u2264 2*3=6 <3\u00b2=9. So s=2. For sum= m\u00b2 (when n is odd), s is m. So regardless of whether n is even or odd, s is equal to m, where m is (n+1)//2. Wait, that can't be right. Let's take some examples. Sample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1: n=1. Then m=(1+1)//2=1. sum is 1^2=1. s=1. Correct. Sample Input 2: n=5. m=(5+1)//2=3. sum is 3\u00b2=9. s=3. Correct. Another example: n=4. m=(4+1)//2=2. sum=2*3=6. s=2, since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, but 3\u00b2=9>6. So s=2. But according to the previous conclusion, s would be m=2, which is correct. Another example: n=6. m=(6+1)//2=3.5? Wait, integer division. (7//2=3). So m=3. sum is 3*4=12. s=3, since 3\u00b2=9 <=12, and 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes. Another example: n=3. m=(3+1)//2=2. sum is 2\u00b2=4. s=2. Correct. So in all cases, s is equal to m. So the maximum possible side length s is equal to (n+1)//2. Wait, no. Because when sum is m*(m+1) (even case), the s is m. But sum is m*(m+1) >= m\u00b2, so the floor of sqrt(sum) is m. For example, m=2, sum=6. sqrt(6)=2.449. s=2. Which is m. So yes. So the conclusion is that s = m = (n+1)//2. But wait, let's test another example. Let's say n=2. m=(2+1)//2=1.5 \u2192 integer division is 1. So m=1. sum is 1*2=2. s=1, since 1\u00b2=1 <=2. So that's correct. For n=2, maximum square is 1x1. Wait, but wait, the sum is 2. So the maximum s is sqrt(2) ~1.414. So floor is 1. But according to the conclusion, s= m=1. Which is correct. Wait, but according to the sample input 2, when n=5, the answer is 3. Which matches (5+1)/2=3. Sample Input 2: n=5 \u2192 3. Correct. Sample Input 2 in the problem statement: output is 3. Which matches. Another example: n=6. sum is m*(m+1) where m= (6+1)//2=3. sum=3*4=12. s=3, since 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So the maximum square is 3x3=9 <=12. But can you form a 3x3 square? Because 3x3=9, sum is 12. So you have enough blocks. But how? But the problem says you don't have to use all blocks. So as long as sum >= s\u00b2, it's possible. Because the total area is sum. So if sum >=s\u00b2, then you can choose some blocks whose total area is at least s\u00b2, but how to arrange them into a square. Wait, but the sum is the total area. So if sum >=s\u00b2, then you can select a subset of blocks whose total area is exactly s\u00b2. Because the blocks can be arranged in a way that fills the square. But perhaps this is a mathematical problem. The problem requires that the sum of the blocks is >= s\u00b2. Because each block contributes to the total area. So the maximum possible s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of all blocks. So the answer is s = floor( sqrt( sum ) ), where sum is computed as m*(m+1) for even n, m^2 for odd n. But according to our analysis, for even n, sum is m*(m+1) and s is m. For odd n, sum is m\u00b2, s is m. So in all cases, s is m. So the answer is m.\n\nWait, but when n is even, sum is m*(m+1), which is m\u00b2 +m. So the square of m is m\u00b2. sum is m\u00b2 +m >=m\u00b2, so s can be m. Because m\u00b2 <= sum < (m+1)^2. So s is m. For example, when n=4, sum=6, s=2. Which is m=2. So yes. So the maximum possible s is equal to m, where m is (n+1)//2. Wait, but (n+1)//2 is the same as ceil(n/2). Let me check:\n\nceil(5/2) =3. (5+1)//2=3. ceil(4/2)=2. (4+1)//2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. So yes. So m is ceil(n/2). So the answer is ceil(n/2) ? But let's see: Wait, let's take n=6. ceil(6/2)=3. So s=3. Sum is 3*4=12. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. Correct.\n\nn=2: ceil(2/2)=1. Correct. n=5: ceil(5/2)=3. Correct. So yes, the answer is ceil(n/2). But wait, in code, (n+1)//2 is the same as ceil(n/2). So the code can compute m as (n+1)/2 using integer division. Wait, for example:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3.\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division in C++ (using 4+1 is 5, divided by 2 as integers gives 2. Which is indeed ceil(4/2)=2. So the answer is (n+1)/2, using integer division. But wait, according to our previous examples, when n=6, (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3 (integer division), which is ceil(6/2)=3. Correct. Yes. So the maximum possible s is (n+1)//2. But wait, the problem says that in the second sample input (n=5), the answer is 3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. So the code is simply, for each test case, compute (n+1)//2. Wait, but that's not possible. Because for example, when n=3, sum is m\u00b2=2\u00b2=4. s=2. Which is correct. But wait, let's take n=3. The blocks are 1x1, 1x1, 1x2. Sum is 1+1+2=4. So s=2. Which is correct. Another example: n=4. Sum is 1+1+2+2=6. s=2. Correct. But wait, the sum for n=4 is 6, which is 2*3=6. s=2, which is m=2. So the answer is indeed m. So the code for each test case is simply output (n+1)//2. But wait, the sample input 2 is n=5, and the answer is 3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Another test case: n=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is correct. Wait, but that can't be. Because sum is 12, s^2 is 9. But the square can be 3x3, which uses 9 units. But how do you arrange the blocks? But the problem allows using any subset. So as long as the sum of the blocks is >= s\u00b2, you can form a square of size s. Because the sum of the selected blocks must be at least s\u00b2. But since you can choose any subset, the maximum possible s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of all blocks. Because the sum of all blocks is the maximum possible sum. So if you can find s such that s\u00b2 <= sum, then you can select the necessary blocks to reach at least s\u00b2. But how? But perhaps the sum of the blocks is exactly equal to s squared. But in some cases, sum is larger than s squared. For example, when n=4, sum=6. So s is 2. Sum is 6>4. So the blocks must have enough length to fill 4 units. The sum is 6, which is more than 4. So you can take some blocks whose sum is exactly 4, like 1,1,2 (sum 4). Or 2+2=4. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where s\u00b2 is less than or equal to the sum of all blocks. And according to our analysis, that's equal to m=(n+1)//2. But wait, why is that? Because sum for even n is m*(m+1). For example, m=3, sum=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9<=12. So yes. So in all cases, the sum is >= m\u00b2 (for even n: sum=m\u00b2 +m >=m\u00b2). So s is m. So the answer is m=(n+1)//2. Thus, the code is straightforward: for each test case, output (n+1)//2. But wait, that seems too easy. Let's check the sample input 2:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Another example: n=3. Sum is 4. So s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Sum is 12. s=3. Correct. But let's check a case where sum is m*(m+1). For example, n=4. m=2. sum=6. s=2. So 2\u00b2=4 <=6. Correct. But what about n=7. m=(7+1)//2=4. sum=4\u00b2=16. s=4. Correct. So according to this analysis, the code is simply outputting (n+1)//2. But why would the problem description be so complicated if the solution is so simple? There must be a catch here. Wait, perhaps there's an error in the analysis. Let's re-express sum in terms of m.\n\nFor any n, sum is:\n\nIf n is even \u2192 sum = m*(m+1), where m = (n+1)//2. Wait, for n even:\n\nn=4 \u2192 m= (4+1)//2=2. sum=2*3=6. But according to the formula earlier, for even n=2k, sum is k*(k+1), which is m*(m+1) only when m=k. For n=4, k=2. m=2. sum=2*3=6. Yes. For odd n=5 \u2192 m=3. sum=3\u00b2=9. So for all n, sum is m\u00b2 if n is odd, m*(m+1) if even. But the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(sum). Which for even n is m, and for odd n is m. So yes, s is m. But why does this hold? Because when sum is m*(m+1), then s = floor( sqrt( m*(m+1) ) ) = m, since m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. So the floor is m. Thus, the code is indeed to compute m = (n+1)//2 and output that. But why does the sample input 2's output is 3 when sum is 9 (3\u00b2)? Because s=3. Which is correct. So the code should read each n, compute (n+1)//2, and output that. Thus, the code can be written as: For each test case, read n, compute m = (n + 1) / 2 (using integer division), output m.\n\nWait, but in C++, when n is a long long, (n+1)/2 when n is even and 1e9, there's no problem. For example, n=1e9: (1e9 +1)/2 =500,000,000.5 \u2192 integer division truncates to 500,000,000. But wait, (n +1) is even when n is odd, and odd when n is even. So (n+1)/2 in C++ with integer division gives the correct m. So the code for each test case is simply:\n\nll n; cin >>n; cout << (n+1)/2 << endl;\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Let me check with some examples. Test case 1: n=1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct. Test case 2: n=5. (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Sample Input 2's answer is 3. Correct. Another test case: n=6. (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Correct. Another test case: n=7. (7+1)/2=4. sum=4\u00b2=16. s=4. Correct. So this code would output the correct answer. But wait, the sample input 2's sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So s=3. Which is correct. But why is the code working when the sum for even n is m*(m+1), but the code returns m as the answer. Because m*(m+1) is >= m\u00b2. So s\u00b2 can be m\u00b2. But the code returns m as the answer, which is indeed correct. So the conclusion is that the answer is (n+1)//2. So the code is very simple. The missing part is reading n, compute (n+1)/2 and output. So the code inside the while loop is:\n\nll n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1)/2 << '\\n'; Wait, but wait. Let's think again. Let's take n=1:\n\nsum is 1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: sum is 1+1=2. (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 1. So s=1. Which is correct. n=3: sum is 4. (3+1)/2=2. s=2. Correct. n=4: sum is 6. (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. s=2. Correct. Yes. So the code is correct. So the code for each test case is reading n, output (n+1)//2. So the missing code is:\n\nll n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl; But wait, what about the data type? Since n can be up to 1e9, (n+1) can be up to 1e9+1, but dividing by 2 is manageable as a long long. Yes. So the code inside the while loop is:\n\nll n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1)/2 << \"\\n\"; But in C++, integer division of (n+1)/2 when n is even would be correct. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=5/2=2 (integer division). So yes. So that's the solution.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. We need to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n blocks. Each block is 1 unit high, and their lengths are ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. So the sum of all the block lengths multiplied by 1 (since height is 1) gives the total area. The square's area is s^2, so we need the largest s where s^2 \u2264 total_sum.\n\nWait, right. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that s\u00b2 is less than or equal to the sum of all the ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Then, we need to compute that sum and find s.\n\nFirst, let's find a formula for the sum of ceil(i/2) from i=1 to n.\n\nLet's break it down. For i=1: ceil(1/2) = 1. For i=2: ceil(2/2)=1. For i=3: ceil(3/2)=2. i=4: 2. i=5:3, etc.\n\nSo for even i: i/2. For odd i: (i+1)/2. So let's split into even and odd terms.\n\nLet me see. The sum up to n can be split into even and odd numbers up to n. Let's see:\n\nIf n is even, then there are n/2 even terms and n/2 odd terms. Wait, no. Wait, for example, n=4: 1,2,3,4. Two even (2,4) and two odd (1,3). So for n even, the number of even and odd terms is equal to n/2 each.\n\nIf n is odd, then there are (n+1)/2 terms. For example, n=5: 1,2,3,4,5. Three odd terms (1,3,5) and two even terms (2,4).\n\nSo the sum can be calculated as:\n\nsum = (sum of odd terms) + (sum of even terms).\n\nFor even terms (i even): ceil(i/2) = i/2. So for even i, it's exactly i/2.\n\nFor odd terms (i odd): ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. So for i=2k-1, ceil(i/2) = k.\n\nLet's compute the sum for even and odd terms separately.\n\nLet's say the number of odd terms up to n is m. For example, when n is even, m = n/2. Wait no. Let's compute m:\n\nThe number of odd numbers from 1 to n is (n +1 )// 2. Because:\n\nIf n is even: numbers 1,3,...,n-1. Total n/2 terms. (n+1)//2 is (even+1)/2 = (n/2) + 0.5 \u2192 but integer division would be n/2. Wait, for n even, (n+1)/2 is (even +1)/2, which is 0.5 more than n/2. But integer division would truncate. Wait, for example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Which is correct for the number of odd terms (1,3 \u2192 2 terms).\n\nWait, perhaps m = (n + 1) // 2. Let's check:\n\nn even: (even +1)//2 = (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 floor is 2. Correct for n=4.\n\nn odd: say n=5. (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct (1,3,5 \u2192 3 terms).\n\nSo the number of odd terms is m = (n +1)//2.\n\nEach odd term contributes (i+1)/2. Let's find the sum of those terms. For i being 1,3,5,..., up to n if n is odd, or n-1 if even.\n\nWait, when i is odd, i can be written as 2k-1, where k ranges from 1 to m. So for each k, the term is (2k-1 +1)/2 = 2k/2 = k. So the sum of all odd terms is sum_{k=1 to m} k = m(m+1)/2.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because each odd i (like 1,3,5) contributes k where k is 1,2,3, etc. So for m odd terms, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m = m(m+1)/2.\n\nWhat about even terms? For even i, ceil(i/2) is i/2. The even terms are 2,4,6,... up to n if even, or n-1 if odd. So for even i, the sum is sum_{i=2,4,...,2p} (i/2) where p is the number of even terms.\n\nLet p be the number of even terms. The even terms are 2,4,6,...,2p. Because 2p <= n. So p = n//2. For example, n=5: even terms are 2 and 4 \u2192 p=2.\n\nThe sum for even terms is sum_{k=1 to p} (2k)/2 = sum_{k=1 to p} k = p(p+1)/2.\n\nSo total sum is:\n\nsum = (m(m+1)/2) + (p(p+1)/2), where m = (n+1)//2, p = n//2.\n\nBut m and p are related. Let's see:\n\nFor n even:\n\nn = 2k. Then m = (2k +1)/2 \u2192 integer division gives k. Because (2k+1)//2 is k.0.5, but integer division truncates. Wait, 2k is even, (2k +1) is 2k+1. Divided by 2 gives k + 0.5. But integer division would truncate to k. So m = k.\n\np is n//2 = k.\n\nSo m = k, p =k.\n\nsum for even n is [k(k+1)/2] + [k(k+1)/2] = k(k+1) = (k^2 +k).\n\nWhich is equal to (n/2)*(n/2 +1).\n\nBut for n even, n=2k, sum is k*(k+1) = (2k/2)*(2k/2 +1) = k*(k+1).\n\nFor n odd: n=2k+1. Then m = (2k+2)/2 \u2192 (k+1). p = (2k+1)//2 = k.\n\nSo sum is [(k+1)(k+2)/2] + [k(k+1)/2] = [ (k+1)(k+2 +k) ) ] /2 \u2192 (k+1)(2k+2)/2 \u2192 (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2.\n\nBut k can be expressed as (n-1)/2. So sum is (( (n-1)/2 +1 ))^2 \u2192 ( (n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nWait, for n=5 (odd), m=(5+1)/2=3, p=5//2=2.\n\nSum for odd terms: 3*4/2 =6. Even terms: 2*3/2=3. Total sum 9 \u2192 3\u00b2. Which matches ( (5+1)/2 )\u00b2 \u2192 3\u00b2=9. Yes.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sum S(n) is:\n\nIf n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 +1) \u2192 [k*(k+1) where k = n/2]\n\nIf n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n//2) * ( (n//2) +1 ) ) + ( ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+1)//2 +1 ) ) ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier analysis shows that for even n, sum is k*(k+1) where k =n/2.\n\nFor odd n, sum is (k+1)^2 where k = (n-1)/2 \u2192 which is ( (n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nBut how to express this in terms of m and p. Wait, m is (n+1)//2, p is n//2.\n\nSo for even n, m = p. Because n even: (n+1)//2 = n/2 if n is even? Wait, n=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. So m=2, p=4//2=2. So m=p for even n.\n\nSo sum for even n is m*(m+1) \u2192 since m =p =n/2.\n\nFor odd n, m = (n+1)/2. Then sum is m\u00b2.\n\nSo overall, sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nS(n) = m^2 if n is odd, else m*(m+1), where m = (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, because for even n, m is n/2. Then m*(m+1) is (n/2)(n/2 +1).\n\nYes. So combining both cases, S(n) can be written as m\u00b2 when n is odd, and m*(m+1) when n is even. But wait, for even n, m = (n+1)//2. Let's see for n=4, m=(4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. So m=2. Then m*(m+1) = 2*3=6. Which is correct for n=4: sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1-4 is 1+1+2+2 =6. So yes.\n\nSo for any n, S(n) is equal to m*(m+1) when n is even, and m\u00b2 when n is odd, where m = (n+1)/2 for even and odd n. Wait no, for even n, m is (n+1)/2, but that would be a fraction. Wait no, m is (n+1)//2. Let's take n=4: (4+1)//2 is 5//2=2. So m=2. For even n, m is (n//2) because (n+1)//2 is the same as (n//2) + 0.5, but integer division truncates. Wait, let me rephrase.\n\nActually, m is (n+1)//2. For even n=2k: (2k+1)//2= k. So m= k. For n even, S(n)=k*(k+1). For n=2k+1 (odd), m = (2k+2)//2 =k+1. So S(n)= (k+1)^2.\n\nSo regardless of even or odd, m is (n+1)//2. So the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even \u2192 m*(m+1)\n\nif n is odd \u2192 m\u00b2.\n\nBut how can we express this in code without checking for even and odd? Because n can be up to 1e9, and for t=1e4 test cases, we need an O(1) solution.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's see:\n\nWe need to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. Sum is either m\u00b2 (if n is odd) or m*(m+1) (if even), where m = (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but when n is even, m = (n+1)//2 = n/2 + 0.5? For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor to 2. So m=2. So sum is 2*3=6. Then s^2 \u22646 \u2192 s=2, since 2^2=4 \u22646, 3^2=9>6.\n\nBut what if sum is m*(m+1), then the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(m*(m+1)).\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the sum S(n) and compute s as the floor of sqrt(S(n)). But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, for even n:\n\nsum = m*(m+1). So s is the integer part of sqrt(m*(m+1)). For example, m=2 \u2192 sum=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)=~2.449, s=2.\n\nFor m=3: sum=12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=~3.464 \u2192 s=3.\n\nBut sqrt(m*(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So the floor is m.\n\nWait, sqrt(m*(m+1)) is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) which is less than m+1, since m\u00b2 +m < m\u00b2 + 2m +1 = (m+1)^2.\n\nSo the floor of sqrt(m*(m+1)) is m.\n\nSo for even n, sum is m*(m+1), and s = floor(sqrt(sum)) = m.\n\nWait, let's see: m=2: sum=6, sqrt(6)=~2.45 \u2192 floor is 2. Which is m.\n\nm=3: sum=12, sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3, which is m.\n\nYes. So for even n, s = m.\n\nFor odd n, sum is m\u00b2. So s = m.\n\nSo in both cases, s is equal to m.\n\nWait, that's a critical insight. Let me check.\n\nWhen n is even, sum is m*(m+1). So the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum is m, because m\u00b2 \u2264 m(m+1) < (m+1)^2. For example, m=2: 2\u00b2=4 \u2264 2*3=6 <3\u00b2=9. So s=2.\n\nFor sum= m\u00b2 (when n is odd), s is m.\n\nSo regardless of whether n is even or odd, s is equal to m, where m is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's take some examples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1: n=1. Then m=(1+1)//2=1. sum is 1^2=1. s=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: n=5. m=(5+1)//2=3. sum is 3\u00b2=9. s=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. m=(4+1)//2=2. sum=2*3=6. s=2, since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, but 3\u00b2=9>6. So s=2. But according to the previous conclusion, s would be m=2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. m=(6+1)//2=3.5? Wait, integer division. (7//2=3). So m=3. sum is 3*4=12. s=3, since 3\u00b2=9 <=12, and 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes.\n\nAnother example: n=3. m=(3+1)//2=2. sum is 2\u00b2=4. s=2. Correct.\n\nSo in all cases, s is equal to m.\n\nSo the maximum possible side length s is equal to (n+1)//2. Wait, no. Because when sum is m*(m+1) (even case), the s is m. But sum is m*(m+1) >= m\u00b2, so the floor of sqrt(sum) is m. For example, m=2, sum=6. sqrt(6)=2.449. s=2. Which is m. So yes.\n\nSo the conclusion is that s = m = (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, let's test another example. Let's say n=2. m=(2+1)//2=1.5 \u2192 integer division is 1. So m=1. sum is 1*2=2. s=1, since 1\u00b2=1 <=2. So that's correct. For n=2, maximum square is 1x1. Wait, but wait, the sum is 2. So the maximum s is sqrt(2) ~1.414. So floor is 1.\n\nBut according to the conclusion, s= m=1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input 2, when n=5, the answer is 3. Which matches (5+1)/2=3.\n\nSample Input 2: n=5 \u2192 3. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2 in the problem statement: output is 3. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: n=6.\n\nsum is m*(m+1) where m= (6+1)//2=3. sum=3*4=12. s=3, since 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So the maximum square is 3x3=9 <=12. But can you form a 3x3 square? Because 3x3=9, sum is 12. So you have enough blocks. But how?\n\nBut the problem says you don't have to use all blocks. So as long as sum >= s\u00b2, it's possible. Because the total area is sum. So if sum >=s\u00b2, then you can choose some blocks whose total area is at least s\u00b2, but how to arrange them into a square. Wait, but the sum is the total area. So if sum >=s\u00b2, then you can select a subset of blocks whose total area is exactly s\u00b2. Because the blocks can be arranged in a way that fills the square. But perhaps this is a mathematical problem. The problem requires that the sum of the blocks is >= s\u00b2. Because each block contributes to the total area. So the maximum possible s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of all blocks.\n\nSo the answer is s = floor( sqrt( sum ) ), where sum is computed as m*(m+1) for even n, m^2 for odd n. But according to our analysis, for even n, sum is m*(m+1) and s is m. For odd n, sum is m\u00b2, s is m. So in all cases, s is m. So the answer is m.\n\nWait, but when n is even, sum is m*(m+1), which is m\u00b2 +m. So the square of m is m\u00b2. sum is m\u00b2 +m >=m\u00b2, so s can be m. Because m\u00b2 <= sum < (m+1)^2. So s is m. For example, when n=4, sum=6, s=2. Which is m=2. So yes.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is equal to m, where m is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but (n+1)//2 is the same as ceil(n/2). Let me check:\n\nceil(5/2) =3. (5+1)//2=3.\n\nceil(4/2)=2. (4+1)//2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2.\n\nSo yes. So m is ceil(n/2).\n\nSo the answer is ceil(n/2) ?\n\nBut let's see:\n\nWait, let's take n=6. ceil(6/2)=3. So s=3. Sum is 3*4=12. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. Correct.\n\nn=2: ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\nn=5: ceil(5/2)=3. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the answer is ceil(n/2). But wait, in code, (n+1)//2 is the same as ceil(n/2). So the code can compute m as (n+1)/2 using integer division.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3.\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division in C++ (using 4+1 is 5, divided by 2 as integers gives 2.\n\nWhich is indeed ceil(4/2)=2.\n\nSo the answer is (n+1)/2, using integer division.\n\nBut wait, according to our previous examples, when n=6, (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3 (integer division), which is ceil(6/2)=3. Correct.\n\nYes. So the maximum possible s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that in the second sample input (n=5), the answer is 3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nSo the code is simply, for each test case, compute (n+1)//2. Wait, but that's not possible. Because for example, when n=3, sum is m\u00b2=2\u00b2=4. s=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's take n=3. The blocks are 1x1, 1x1, 1x2. Sum is 1+1+2=4. So s=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. Sum is 1+1+2+2=6. s=2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, the sum for n=4 is 6, which is 2*3=6. s=2, which is m=2.\n\nSo the answer is indeed m.\n\nSo the code for each test case is simply output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, the sample input 2 is n=5, and the answer is 3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because sum is 12, s^2 is 9. But the square can be 3x3, which uses 9 units. But how do you arrange the blocks?\n\nBut the problem allows using any subset. So as long as the sum of the blocks is >= s\u00b2, you can form a square of size s. Because the sum of the selected blocks must be at least s\u00b2. But since you can choose any subset, the maximum possible s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of all blocks. Because the sum of all blocks is the maximum possible sum. So if you can find s such that s\u00b2 <= sum, then you can select the necessary blocks to reach at least s\u00b2. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the sum of the blocks is exactly equal to s squared. But in some cases, sum is larger than s squared. For example, when n=4, sum=6. So s is 2. Sum is 6>4. So the blocks must have enough length to fill 4 units. The sum is 6, which is more than 4. So you can take some blocks whose sum is exactly 4, like 1,1,2 (sum 4). Or 2+2=4.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where s\u00b2 is less than or equal to the sum of all blocks. And according to our analysis, that's equal to m=(n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, why is that?\n\nBecause sum for even n is m*(m+1). For example, m=3, sum=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9<=12. So yes.\n\nSo in all cases, the sum is >= m\u00b2 (for even n: sum=m\u00b2 +m >=m\u00b2). So s is m.\n\nSo the answer is m=(n+1)//2.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward: for each test case, output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, that seems too easy. Let's check the sample input 2:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. Sum is 4. So s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Sum is 12. s=3. Correct.\n\nBut let's check a case where sum is m*(m+1). For example, n=4. m=2. sum=6. s=2. So 2\u00b2=4 <=6. Correct.\n\nBut what about n=7. m=(7+1)//2=4. sum=4\u00b2=16. s=4. Correct.\n\nSo according to this analysis, the code is simply outputting (n+1)//2.\n\nBut why would the problem description be so complicated if the solution is so simple? There must be a catch here.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an error in the analysis. Let's re-express sum in terms of m.\n\nFor any n, sum is:\n\nIf n is even \u2192 sum = m*(m+1), where m = (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, for n even:\n\nn=4 \u2192 m= (4+1)//2=2. sum=2*3=6.\n\nBut according to the formula earlier, for even n=2k, sum is k*(k+1), which is m*(m+1) only when m=k. For n=4, k=2. m=2. sum=2*3=6. Yes.\n\nFor odd n=5 \u2192 m=3. sum=3\u00b2=9.\n\nSo for all n, sum is m\u00b2 if n is odd, m*(m+1) if even.\n\nBut the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(sum). Which for even n is m, and for odd n is m.\n\nSo yes, s is m.\n\nBut why does this hold?\n\nBecause when sum is m*(m+1), then s = floor( sqrt( m*(m+1) ) ) = m, since m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. So the floor is m.\n\nThus, the code is indeed to compute m = (n+1)//2 and output that.\n\nBut why does the sample input 2's output is 3 when sum is 9 (3\u00b2)? Because s=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should read each n, compute (n+1)//2, and output that.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nFor each test case, read n, compute m = (n + 1) / 2 (using integer division), output m.\n\nWait, but in C++, when n is a long long, (n+1)/2 when n is even and 1e9, there's no problem. For example, n=1e9: (1e9 +1)/2 =500,000,000.5 \u2192 integer division truncates to 500,000,000.\n\nBut wait, (n +1) is even when n is odd, and odd when n is even.\n\nSo (n+1)/2 in C++ with integer division gives the correct m.\n\nSo the code for each test case is simply:\n\nll n; cin >>n; cout << (n+1)/2 << endl;\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Let me check with some examples.\n\nTest case 1: n=1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: n=5. (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2's answer is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6. (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7. (7+1)/2=4. sum=4\u00b2=16. s=4. Correct.\n\nSo this code would output the correct answer. But wait, the sample input 2's sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So s=3. Which is correct.\n\nBut why is the code working when the sum for even n is m*(m+1), but the code returns m as the answer. Because m*(m+1) is >= m\u00b2. So s\u00b2 can be m\u00b2. But the code returns m as the answer, which is indeed correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the answer is (n+1)//2.\n\nSo the code is very simple. The missing part is reading n, compute (n+1)/2 and output.\n\nSo the code inside the while loop is:\n\nll n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1)/2 << '\\n';\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think again. Let's take n=1:\n\nsum is 1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: sum is 1+1=2. (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 1. So s=1. Which is correct.\n\nn=3: sum is 4. (3+1)/2=2. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: sum is 6. (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. s=2. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code for each test case is reading n, output (n+1)//2.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nll n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl;\n\nBut wait, what about the data type? Since n can be up to 1e9, (n+1) can be up to 1e9+1, but dividing by 2 is manageable as a long long.\n\nYes. So the code inside the while loop is:\n\nll n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n\nBut in C++, integer division of (n+1)/2 when n is even would be correct. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=5/2=2 (integer division). So yes.\n\nSo that's the solution."
