So for example, any cell in the rectangle from (n,1) to (1,m) would have portals if Megan passes through them. But perhaps the optimal for Stanley is to find a portal cell that is on the path from (1,1) to (n,m), which is the diagonal.

Walk to (x,y), then teleport to another portal cell (a,b), then walk to destination. The total cost would be (distance from (1,1) to (x,y)) + 1 + (distance from (a,b) to (n,m)). We need to choose (x,y) and (a,b) such that this sum is minimal. But (x,y) and (a,b) must be in Megan's path. Alternatively, maybe the best is to teleport from (x,y) to (n,1) or (1,m), which are the start and end of Megan's path. For example, Stanley walks to (n,1), teleports to (1,m), then walks down (n-1) steps. Total cost (n-1) +1 + (n-1) = 2n-1.

But how to find this in code. Another example: n=2, m=2. Megan's steps: 2+2-2=2. Stanley's steps: 2+2-2=2. Sum 4.

So in this case, the direct path is better. Hmm. So the optimal approach depends on the grid dimensions. So what's the pattern here. In the first sample case (7,5), the sum is 15. Which is (7+5-2) for Megan (10) plus 5 for Stanley \u2192 15. But how to compute 5. In the sample, Stanley's steps are 2 (right to (1,3)) +1 (teleport) +2 (right to (7,5)) \u21925.

So this formula suggests that Stanley's steps are m when he uses this particular strategy. But in the first example (n=3, m=3), using this strategy would give Stanley's steps as 3. But earlier example with n=3, m=3, he can do it in 3 steps (walk to (1,3) for 2 steps, teleport to (3,3), but then steps to destination is 0. So total 2+1+0=3. Which is 3 steps, which equals m steps.

So the order of steps can vary, but the minimal path is (n-1) + (m-1) steps. But regardless of the order, she must pass through row 1 and column m. So for any y in 1..m, there's a cell (1, y) in her path, as long as she moves right first then up. But if she moves up first then right, then she would reach (1,1) first (assuming n>1), then move right. But (1,1) is Stanley's starting point, which is not part of Megan's path unless n=1. So for n>1, Megan's path must move up (n-1) steps and right (m-1) steps. So she can pass through (1, y) if she moves up first, then right. For example, for n=7, m=5: Megan starts at (7,1), moves up to (1,1), then right to (1,5). So in this case, her path includes (1, y) for all y from 1 to 5.",

So the key is that Megan's path must include cells that allow Stanley to teleport between rows.

Total steps (y-1) + (n-1) + (m - y) = n + m -2. Same as before. So this path is allowed, and the portals are in (n,y) and (1,y). So Stanley can use these portals. Thus, the minimal steps for Stanley is m steps. But in the sample case, using this strategy would give Stanley's steps as 5, which matches m=5. But the sample case's actual steps are 5, which also matches this. So perhaps the minimal sum is Megan's steps (n+m-2) plus Stanley's steps (m), provided that Megan's path includes a column y where she moves from (n,y) to (1,y). But how to ensure that this is the case. Alternatively, regardless of the actual path Megan takes, the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(m, n, (n+m-2)). Wait, but earlier examples suggest that Stanley's steps can be as low as m. So the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(n + m -2, 2n-1, 2m-1, m, n). Wait, in the first sample case, m=5. So 5 is the minimal for Stanley's steps (5), which is added to Megan's 10 steps to make 15. So the formula would be (n+m-2) + m, but only if m is the minimal option. But why? Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(m, n, (n + m - 2)). But how to verify this. Let's see:\n\nFor n=7, m=5:\n\nmin(5,7, 10) \u21925. So sum 10+5=15. Which matches the sample. For n=3, m=3:\n\nmin(3,3,4) \u21923. Sum 4+3=7. Which matches the earlier example. For n=2, m=2:\n\nmin(2,2,2) \u21922. Sum 2+2=4. Which is correct. For n=3, m=5:\n\nsum would be (3+5-2)=6 + min(5,3,6)=3 \u2192 total 9. But what's the actual minimal sum. In this case, Megan's steps are 6. Stanley's options:\n\n- Walk directly: 3+5-2=6 steps. Total sum 12.\n\n- Use teleport to (1,3) then (3,3) to destination. Steps: (3-1) steps to (1,3) \u21922 steps. Teleport to (3,3) (1 step). Then steps to (3,5): 2 steps. Total 2+1+2=5. Sum 6+5=11.\n\n- Using the m=5 strategy: steps 5. Sum 6+5=11. But wait, 5 steps is the same as using m. But m=5. So yes. So sum is 11. But according to the formula (n+m-2) + m, it would be 6 +5=11. Which is correct. So this seems to work. Another example: n=5, m=2. Megan's steps:5+2-2=5. Stanley's options:\n\n- Walk directly:5+2-2=5 steps. Sum 5+5=10.\n\n- Use teleport via m=2 steps. So steps for Stanley would be 2. Sum 5+2=7. But how?\n\nStanley's steps would be: (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) (1 step), teleport to (5,2) (1 step), then steps to (5,2) \u2192 no steps. Total 1+1+0=2. Sum 5+2=7. Which is better. So according to the formula, sum is 5+2=7. Which is correct. So it seems that the minimal sum is (n + m - 2) + min(m, n, (n + m -2)). But wait, what if n is smaller than m? For example, n=2, m=5. Megan's steps:2+5-2=5. Stanley's steps:\n\nOption 1: m=5 steps (5 steps). Sum 5+5=10. Option 2: Use teleport via m=5. So steps: (1,1) \u2192 (1,5) (4 steps) \u2192 teleport to (2,5) (1 step) \u2192 then steps to (2,5) already there. Total 4+1=5. Sum 5+5=10. But another option: Use n=2 steps. So Stanley's steps would be 2 steps. How?\n\nWalk to (2,1) (n-1 steps =1), teleport to (1,1) (1 step), then walk to (2,5): 4 steps. Total 1+1+4=6. Which is worse than 5. So the minimal is 5 steps. So the formula (n + m -2) + min(m, n) gives 5 + 2=7, which is incorrect. So this suggests that the formula is incorrect. Wait, no. In this case, n=2, m=5. min(m, n) is 2. But according to the previous example, Stanley's steps are 5 steps if he uses the m=5 strategy. But according to the formula, it would be 2 steps. So there's a contradiction. Wait, wait, in this case, min(m, n) is 2. But according to the formula, the sum would be 5+2=7. But earlier calculation showed that the sum is 10. So the formula must be wrong. So this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed. This indicates that the minimal sum is not simply (n+m-2) + min(m, n). So what's the correct approach? Let me re-express the problem. The minimal total energy is Megan's steps plus Stanley's steps. Megan's steps are (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2. Stanley's steps can be minimized by using a teleport. Stanley's steps can be:\n\nOption 1: Walk directly: (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2. Option 2: Walk to (1, y), then teleport to (n, y), then walk to (n,m). Steps: (y-1) + 1 + (m - y) = m.\n\nOption 3: Walk to (x, 1), teleport to (x, m), then walk to (n,m). Steps: (x-1) +1 + (n -x) = n. So the minimal steps for Stanley is the minimum of (n+m-2, m, n). So the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(n, m, n+m-2). Which simplifies to (n+m-2) + min(n, m). Because min(n, m, n+m-2) is equal to min(n, m) when n and m are at least 1. Because for example, if n=2 and m=5:\n\nmin(n, m) =2. n+m-2=5. So min(2,5,5) is 2. So the minimal sum is 5+2=7. But in the previous example, when n=2, m=5, Stanley's steps would be min(5,2,5) =2. But how can he achieve that? Stanley can walk to (2,1) (1 step), teleport to (2,5) (1 step). Steps:1+1=2. But how?\n\nMegan's path must include (2,1) and (2,5). (2,1) is her starting point, and (2,5) is part of her path if she moves right first.",

So this shows that the formula is correct. So in this case, the minimal steps for Stanley are 2 steps (min(n, m)), which is correct. So the formula seems to be correct. So the minimal sum is (n + m -2) + min(n, m). This explains the sample cases:\n\nSample case 1: n=7, m=5. Sum is 7+5-2 +5=10+5=15. Another example: n=3, m=3. Sum is 3+3-2 +3=4+3=7.

Thus, the correct code is for each test case, read n and m, compute (n + m -2) + min(n, m), and output that. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nlong n, m; scanf(\"%ld %ld\", &n, &m);\nprintf(\"%ld\\n\", (n + m - 2) + (n < m ? n : m));\n\nBecause min(n,m) is added to (n+m-2).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, Stanley and Megan are in a grid. They both need to move from their respective starting points to their destinations. The goal is to find the minimum total energy they need. The key here is that Megan leaves portals everywhere she visits. So when either of them is on a portal cell, they can teleport to any other portal cell for 1 energy. The challenge is to figure out the optimal paths that minimize the sum of their energy usage.\n\nHmm. Let's break down their movements. Since Megan is moving from (n,1) to (1,m), she's leaving portals along her path. Stanley starts at (1,1) to (n,m). They can use any of Megan's portals along the way. The portals are placed in all cells Megan visits, which includes her starting point and the path she takes.\n\nSo the optimal strategy probably involves choosing a meeting point where they can use the portals to minimize their steps. Since using a portal costs 1 energy, regardless of distance, maybe they can teleport once to save steps.\n\nWait, the problem says that the portals are placed in every cell Megan visits. So Megan's path determines all possible portal locations. So perhaps the best approach is to find a cell where both Stanley and Megan can reach, and use that as a teleportation point to save steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal energy is determined by overlapping paths or finding the best portal positions that allow both of them to teleport effectively.\n\nLet me think of possible scenarios. Let's consider the sample input mentioned. In the first test case, the example was n=7, m=5, and the answer was 15. The plan involved Megan moving to (7,3), then to (1,3), Stanley uses the portal there to teleport to (7,3), then moves to his destination. But how does that relate to the formula?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal energy can be calculated by considering different possible paths and choosing the one that gives the minimal sum.\n\nAnother approach: The minimal total energy is the sum of their individual energies, but optimized by using portals in the best possible way.\n\nLet's think of the simplest case. Suppose they don't use any portals. Then Stanley's path is (1,1) to (n,m). The minimal steps he can take is (n-1 + m-1) steps. Similarly for Megan, moving from (n,1) to (1,m) would take (n-1) steps up and (m-1) steps right, totaling (n-1 + m-1) steps. So total is 2*(n+m-2) * 1 (since each step is 1). But using portals can reduce this.\n\nIf they can teleport once each, perhaps that's better. For example, if they can find a portal cell that allows them to teleport once. Let's say Stanley walks to a portal cell, teleports to another portal cell, then walks to his destination. Similarly for Megan.\n\nBut how do their paths overlap? Because Megan's path is her own path, so the portals are along her path. So the optimal way would involve Megan's path including some cells that are convenient for both Stanley and Megan to teleport to.\n\nWait, but Megan's path is variable. The problem says that Megan can choose her path. So she can choose any path from (n,1) to (1,m), and along that path, she leaves portals. So the optimal solution would involve choosing Megan's path such that the portals are placed in positions that allow Stanley and herself to minimize their total energy.\n\nWait, but how do we model Megan's path choice? Since the problem requires the minimal total energy, perhaps the best approach is to find the optimal meeting points for their paths, given that Megan's path is optimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal path for Megan is a straight line, but that might not be the case. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal energy is determined by considering certain key points where teleportation would save the most steps.\n\nLet's try to model the problem.\n\nStanley's path:\n\nHe starts at (1,1), needs to go to (n,m). His path can be any path, but if he can use portals, he can teleport from any portal cell to another. So maybe he walks to a portal cell A, uses 1 energy to teleport to portal cell B, then walks to his destination.\n\nSimilarly for Megan. But since Megan leaves portals along her own path, perhaps the optimal strategy is for both to meet at some portal cell, teleport, etc.\n\nWait, but Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). So perhaps the best portal cell is somewhere along the line where their paths cross. Let's think of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy can be found by considering the best possible portal cell (x,y) that Megan will visit, which Stanley can reach with minimal steps. Then, Stanley can walk to (x,y), teleport to another portal cell (maybe Megan's starting or ending point), then proceed.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when Megan's path and Stanley's path share a common portal cell that allows both to teleport optimally.\n\nWait, another idea: Since Megan can choose her path, perhaps the optimal strategy is for her to visit a certain cell that allows both her and Stanley to teleport once, thus saving steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: No teleportation used. Then total energy is (n+m-2)*2, as each has to walk (n+m-2) steps.\n\nCase 2: Using teleportation once for Stanley, once for Megan. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a scenario where both can teleport once each, leading to a lower total.\n\nLet's try to find the minimal possible sum.\n\nAnother approach: The problem is similar to finding two paths (for Stanley and Megan) such that the sum of their steps (with possible teleportation) is minimized.\n\nBut the portals are all the cells Megan visits. So the key is that any cell Megan is on her path can be a portal.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy might be that Megan's path includes a cell that is optimal for Stanley to teleport to.\n\nFor example, Megan's path could pass through some cell (a,b), and Stanley walks to that cell, uses 1 energy to teleport to another cell (like Megan's starting or ending cell), then proceeds.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum can be found by considering the best possible portal (from Megan's path) that Stanley can use, and vice versa.\n\nLet's think of the possible options.\n\nStanley's path: He can either take the direct path (without teleport) or use a portal once. Using a portal once would cost 1 energy, but might save steps.\n\nSimilarly for Megan: she can use a portal once (but since she's leaving portals along her path, perhaps she can teleport to a portal she placed earlier in her path, but that might not save steps for her.\n\nWait, Megan's own movement can't use portals she hasn't placed yet. Because she leaves portals in cells as she visits them. So during her movement, she can't teleport to cells she hasn't visited yet. But since time is not a factor, perhaps the order of their movements can be arranged such that Megan's portals are available when needed.\n\nBut according to the problem note, time does not affect energy. So they can choose the order of their moves. For example, Megan can go first, place all her portals, then Stanley can use them. So in that case, all of Megan's path's cells are portals available for Stanley to use.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is that Megan moves first, leaves portals along her path, and then Stanley moves, using those portals.\n\nBut Megan's own path is from (n,1) to (1,m), and she can choose any path. So the minimal total energy would involve Megan choosing the best possible path that allows both her and Stanley to use the portals optimally.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows.\n\nMegan's path can be any path from (n,1) to (1,m). The portals are all the cells she visits.\n\nStanley's path is from (1,1) to (n,m). He can use any of Megan's portals (including her starting and ending points) to teleport.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the steps both take, plus the teleportation costs (if any).\n\nSo for each possible cell (x,y) in Megan's path, Stanley can decide to teleport to it, or from it. But since Megan's path can be chosen optimally, perhaps the best is to choose the path such that there's a cell (x,y) that is as close as possible to both their paths.\n\nBut this seems abstract. Let's think of possible scenarios.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal sum could be achieved by finding the minimal sum of their individual paths, where their paths can be optimized by teleporting once each.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the steps Stanley can take. Suppose Stanley uses a portal once. For example, he walks from (1,1) to a portal cell A (cost: steps from (1,1) to A), teleports to portal cell B (cost: 1), then walks from B to (n,m) (steps from B to (n,m)). The total cost for Stanley is (steps A) + 1 + (steps B). Similarly for Megan, but she can teleport using her own portals.\n\nBut how to find the optimal A and B?\n\nAlternatively, the best portal cell for Stanley might be Megan's starting cell (n,1) or her ending cell (1,m). Let's see.\n\nFor example, if Stanley walks to (n,1) (Megan's starting cell), then teleports to (1,m) (Megan's ending cell). The cost would be (distance from (1,1) to (n,1)) + 1 + (distance from (1,m) to (n,m)). The distance from (1,1) to (n,1) is (n-1) steps. From (1,m) to (n,m) is (n-1) steps. So total for Stanley is (n-1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n -1. But that's if he uses the teleport. But if he just walks directly, his steps are (n-1)+(m-1) steps. So comparing 2n-1 versus (n+m-2). So when is 2n-1 better? When 2n-1 < n + m -2 \u2192 n < m-1. So for example, if m is larger than n+1, then this could be better. But what if he uses a different portal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal portal is the one that allows Stanley to minimize his steps. Maybe the best is to have a portal cell that is as close as possible to both his start and end points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is determined by the minimal of several possible scenarios:\n\n1. No teleportation: sum is (Stanley's steps) + (Megan's steps) = 2*(n+m-2).\n\n2. Both use a teleport once each. For example, Stanley uses a teleport, Megan uses a teleport.\n\n3. Only one uses a teleport.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider possible scenarios where they use teleportation optimally.\n\nLet me think of Megan's path. She starts at (n,1) and ends at (1,m). The minimal steps she can take is (n-1 + m-1) steps. But perhaps she can take a path that includes some cell that allows her to teleport to another cell, saving steps. But since she's the one placing the portals, she can teleport to any cell she has already visited. So, for example, she could walk to a certain cell, then teleport back to a previous cell, but that would cost 1 energy but save steps. But is that helpful?\n\nWait, no. Because teleporting to a previous cell would cost 1 energy, but she would have already spent steps to reach that cell. So it's unclear if that would help. For example, Megan's path could be: (n,1) \u2192 ... \u2192 (x,y) \u2192 ... \u2192 (1,m). If she uses a teleport from (x,y) to (n,1), then her steps would be (steps to (x,y)) + 1 (teleport) + steps from (n,1) to (1,m). But that's only helpful if (x,y) is far enough from (1,m) that teleporting saves steps.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think differently. Since Megan's path can be any path, perhaps the optimal path is such that she uses teleportation once. For example, she walks to a cell (a,b), then teleports to another cell (c,d) that's along her path, then walks to (1,m). The total steps would be (distance from (n,1) to (a,b)) + 1 + (distance from (c,d) to (1,m)). But how to choose (a,b) and (c,d) such that (c,d) is along the path from (a,b) to (1,m), but this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is the sum of the minimal possible steps for each, considering that they can use teleport once each. Let's model that.\n\nFor Stanley's minimal steps:\n\nOption 1: Walk directly. Steps: (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2.\n\nOption 2: Find a portal cell (x,y) that he can walk to, teleport to another portal cell (a,b), then walk to destination. The cost would be (steps to (x,y)) + 1 + (steps from (a,b) to (n,m)). The best scenario is when (x,y) is as close as possible to his start, and (a,b) is as close as possible to his destination.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible for this option?\n\nFor example, if he can walk to (1,1) (which is his starting point, so no steps), teleport to (1,m) (Megan's ending point), then walk to (n,m). Steps: 0 (already there) +1 + (n-1) steps down. So total is 1 + (n-1) = n. Compare to direct path steps (n+m-2). So when n < n + m -2 \u2192 which is always true if m>1. So for m>1, this option is better. Wait, but is (1,1) a portal cell? Only if Megan has visited it. But Megan's path starts at (n,1) and ends at (1,m). So unless she visits (1,1), which is possible only if she takes a path that goes through that cell. But (n,1) to (1,m) may not pass through (1,1) unless n=1 and m=1, which is impossible since the starting and ending points are different.\n\nWait, so (1,1) is Stanley's starting point. Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). So unless n=1, she can't reach (1,1). For example, if n=1, Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,m), which includes (1,1). So in that case, Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to another portal.\n\nBut for n>1, Megan's path doesn't pass through (1,1). So Stanley cannot teleport from (1,1) unless he walks to a portal cell.\n\nSo maybe the optimal way is for Stanley to walk to a portal cell that is as close as possible.\n\nSimilarly for Megan: her optimal path may involve teleporting once.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal total energy is the sum of the minimal steps for each, considering the best use of portals.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think of the possible optimal scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Both use teleport once.\n\nStanley's minimal steps: walk to a portal cell, teleport, then walk to destination.\n\nMegan's minimal steps: walk to a portal cell, teleport, then walk.\n\nBut which cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best way is for Megan to create a portal in a cell that is optimal for Stanley, and vice versa.\n\nWait, since Megan's portals are all along her path, perhaps the optimal portal for Stanley is one of the cells in her path. So, perhaps the best way is to find the minimal sum of (Stanley's path) + (Megan's path), where each can use teleport once.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is min of several possible scenarios. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Stanley uses Megan's starting cell (n,1) as a teleport. So he walks to (n,1), which takes (n-1) steps (since he starts at (1,1)), then teleports to Megan's ending cell (1,m), which costs 1, then walks from (1,m) to (n,m) which takes (n-1) steps. Total for Stanley: (n-1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n-1.\n\nMegan's path: she can walk from (n,1) to (1,m), which takes (n-1) + (m-1) steps. But she can also use teleport. For example, she walks to (n,1), teleport to (1,m), which would cost 1, but then she's already at (1,m). So her cost is 0 steps (since she starts at (n,1)) +1. But that's only possible if she starts and uses the portal immediately. So Megan's minimal steps would be 1 (teleport) if she can teleport from her starting cell to her ending cell. But how?\n\nWait, Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). She can't teleport unless she has already placed portals. But she leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So she starts at (n,1), which has a portal. Then she can choose to teleport immediately to (1,m) if she has already placed a portal there. But she hasn't, because she hasn't visited it yet.\n\nSo Megan's own teleportation can only be to cells she has already visited. So during her path, she can't teleport to (1,m) until she has visited it. So she can't teleport to her destination until she arrives there.\n\nSo Megan's own path can't use teleport to skip steps unless she loops back. Which is unlikely to be optimal.\n\nThus, perhaps Megan's minimal steps are (n-1)+(m-1) steps, and she can't teleport. So for Megan, the minimal steps are fixed as (n+m-2), unless she can find a way to use teleportation along her path.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, Megan's path could be (n,1) \u2192 (x,y) \u2192 teleport to (n,1), then proceed. But that would cost steps to (x,y) +1 + steps from (n,1) to (1,m). Which might be worse than just taking the direct path.\n\nSo perhaps Megan's path is better without teleportation. So her minimal steps are (n + m -2).\n\nBut then, Stanley's steps can be optimized using portals in Megan's path.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding Stanley's minimal steps given that he can use portals placed along Megan's path.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). Let's say she takes the shortest path, which is moving up (n-1) steps and right (m-1) steps. So her path includes all cells along the way, for example, moving right and up in any order.\n\nBut in this case, the portals are along the path. So for example, any cell in the rectangle from (n,1) to (1,m) would have portals if Megan passes through them.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal for Stanley is to find a portal cell that is on the path from (1,1) to (n,m), which is the diagonal. Or perhaps a cell that is in the intersection of Megan's path and Stanley's optimal path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal for Stanley is to walk to a cell in Megan's path, then teleport to another cell in Megan's path, thus saving steps.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of possible options for Stanley.\n\nStanley's options:\n\n1. Walk directly: cost (n + m -2).\n\n2. Find a portal cell (x,y) in Megan's path. Walk to (x,y), then teleport to another portal cell (a,b), then walk to destination.\n\nThe total cost would be (distance from (1,1) to (x,y)) + 1 + (distance from (a,b) to (n,m)).\n\nWe need to choose (x,y) and (a,b) such that this sum is minimal.\n\nBut (x,y) and (a,b) must be in Megan's path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best is to teleport from (x,y) to (n,1) or (1,m), which are the start and end of Megan's path.\n\nFor example, Stanley walks to (n,1), teleports to (1,m), then walks down (n-1) steps. Total cost (n-1) +1 + (n-1) = 2n-1. Which is better than direct path when 2n-1 < (n + m -2) \u2192 when m > n+1 - 2 \u2192 m >n-1 \u2192 which is possible if m is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another option: Stanley walks to (1,m), which is the end of Megan's path. Then teleports to (n,1), which is the start. Then walks to (n,m). The cost would be (distance from (1,1) to (1,m)) +1 + (distance from (n,1) to (n,m)).\n\nWhich is (m-1) steps to (1,m) \u2192 +1 \u2192 then (m-1) steps from (n,1) to (n,m). Total cost is (m-1 +1 + m-1) = 2m -1. Compare to direct path (n+m-2). So when 2m-1 < n +m-2 \u2192 m < n-1. So if m is smaller than n-1, this is better.\n\nSo for Stanley, the minimal steps could be min(n + m -2, 2n-1, 2m-1).\n\nBut when? Let's see:\n\nThe minimal steps for Stanley would be the minimum of (n+m-2), 2n-1, 2m-1).\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but for Stanley to use the teleport option (n,1) to (1,m), he must first reach (n,1) or (1,m). But (n,1) is Megan's starting point. So in order for Stanley to reach (n,1), he has to walk (n-1) steps down. Then teleport to (1,m) (which is Megan's ending cell), which costs 1, then walk (n-1) steps down again. So total cost 2n-1.\n\nAlternatively, if he walks to (1,m), which is Megan's ending cell, that would require (m-1) steps right. Then teleport to (n,1) (Megan's starting cell), then walk (m-1) steps right. Total cost 2m-1.\n\nBut whether these options are better than the direct path depends on n and m.\n\nSo the minimal steps for Stanley is min(n+m-2, 2n-1, 2m-1).\n\nBut since we need the sum for both Stanley and Megan, we have to consider their combined minimal steps.\n\nWait, but Megan's steps are (n+m-2) if she walks directly, right? Unless she can use a teleport in her own path. But how?\n\nMegan's path is (n,1) to (1,m). She can use portals she has already visited. So perhaps she can take a path that allows her to teleport once. For example, she walks to some cell A, teleport to cell B which is on her path (earlier in the sequence), then proceed. But how would that help?\n\nWait, if she walks from (n,1) to cell A, then teleport to cell B (which she has already visited), then walk from B to (1,m). The cost would be steps from (n,1) to A + 1 + steps from B to (1,m). So to minimize this, she wants to find a way where steps from (n,1) to A + steps from B to (1,m) + 1 is minimized, with B being any cell before A in her path.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal path for Megan is to take a straight path, and her steps are (n-1)+(m-1), and she can't teleport. So her cost is fixed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Megan can use a teleport once. For example, she walks to cell (1,1), which is Stanley's starting point, then teleport to (1,m), her destination. But she can't reach (1,1) from (n,1) unless n=1. So this is only possible for n=1.\n\nIn that case, her steps would be (0 steps if n=1, then steps from (1,1) to (1,m) is m-1. Then teleport to (1,m), cost 1. So total steps (m-1) +1 = m. But walking directly would also be (m-1) steps (since she starts at (1,1) and ends at (1,m)). So no gain.\n\nThus, perhaps Megan can't reduce her steps by teleporting. So her minimal steps are (n+m-2), and Stanley's steps are the minimal between (n+m-2), 2n-1, 2m-1, etc.\n\nBut then the total sum is Megan's steps (n+m-2) plus Stanley's minimal steps.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding Stanley's minimal steps given that he can use any portals in Megan's path, and adding that to Megan's steps (n+m-2).\n\nBut how to compute Stanley's minimal steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total sum is the minimal of:\n\nsum1 = (n+m-2) * 2 (both walk directly)\n\nsum2 = (n+m-2) + (2n-1) (Megan walks, Stanley uses the teleport via (n,1) and (1,m))\n\nsum3 = (n+m-2) + (2m-1) (Megan walks, Stanley uses teleport via (1,m) and (n,1))\n\nsum4 = other possibilities where both use teleport once.\n\nWait, but if Megan's steps are fixed as (n+m-2), then the total sum is (n+m-2) + min( (n+m-2), 2n-1, 2m-1 )\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that both can use portals. So perhaps Megan's steps can be optimized using portals as well.\n\nAlternatively, Megan can also use teleportation. For example, she could walk to (1,1) (Stanley's starting point) if possible, then teleport to (n,1), but that would not save steps. So perhaps this isn't useful.\n\nBut maybe there's a scenario where both can teleport once each.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is the minimal of:\n\na) sum when both walk directly: 2*(n+m-2)\n\nb) sum when Stanley uses teleport once, Megan walks directly: (n+m-2) + (2n-1)\n\nc) sum when Stanley uses teleport once, Megan walks: (n+m-2) + (2m-1)\n\nd) sum when Megan uses teleport once, Stanley walks: (n+m-2) + (steps for Megan using teleport)\n\ne) sum when both use teleport once.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to find an expression based on the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nIn the first test case, n=7 and m=5. The answer is 15.\n\nLet's compute the sum according to different options.\n\nOption a: 2*(7+5-2) = 2*10=20. The sample answer is 15, so this isn't the case.\n\nOption b: Megan's steps 7+5-2=10. Stanley's steps 2*7-1=13. Total 23. Not correct.\n\nOption c: Stanley's steps 2*5-1=9. Total 10+9=19. Still not 15.\n\nSo this suggests that there's another scenario.\n\nWait, according to the note in the problem statement, the total energy is 15. Let's see:\n\nThe example says:\n\nMegan moves to (7,3) (from (7,1) \u2192 steps: 2 right (7,1) \u21927,2 \u21927,3. So steps 2. Then she goes to (1,3) (steps 6 up). Then Stanley uses the portal in (1,3) to teleport to (7,3) (cost 1). Then he moves to (7,5) (steps 2). So Stanley's path is:\n\n(1,1) \u2192 (1,3) (steps 2). Teleport to (7,3) (cost 1). Then to (7,5) (steps 2). Total cost 2+1+2=5.\n\nMegan's path:\n\n(7,1) \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,5). Her steps: 2 (right) +6 (up) + 2 (right) = 10. Then she uses the portal at (1,3) to teleport? No, in the example note, she didn't teleport. So total steps for Megan: 2+6+2=10. Then Stanley's steps are 5. Wait, but the total sum is 10+5=15.\n\nWait, but how does that fit into the possible options?\n\nIn this scenario, Stanley's steps are 2 (to reach (1,3)), teleport (cost 1) to (7,3), then steps 2. Total 5. Megan's steps are 2 (to 7,3) +6 (to 1,3) +2 (to 1,5) \u2192 10. Total sum 15.\n\nBut how is that better than other options?\n\nSo here's what happened: Megan creates a portal at (7,3), then at (1,3). Stanley uses (1,3) to teleport to (7,3), saving steps.\n\nSo the key is that Stanley can walk to a portal cell (1,3), which is on Megan's path. Then teleport to (7,3), which is also on her path, thus reducing his steps.\n\nSo in this case, the sum is (Megan's steps) + (Stanley's steps) = 10 +5=15.\n\nSo how to model this.\n\nIn this scenario, Stanley's steps are (steps from (1,1) to (1,3)) \u2192 2 \u2192 +1 (teleport) \u2192 steps from (7,3) to (7,5) \u2192 2. Total 5.\n\nSo this is better than other options.\n\nSo this suggests that the minimal sum can be found by finding a common portal cell that allows both to save steps.\n\nBut how to find this cell.\n\nPerhaps the optimal portal cell is the one that is in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal portal cell for Stanley is the cell that allows him to split his journey into two parts: (1,1) to (x,y), then teleport to (x', y'), then to (n,m). The total cost is (distance from (1,1) to (x,y)) +1 + (distance from (x', y') to (n,m)).\n\nBut (x,y) and (x', y') must be portal cells (i.e., in Megan's path).\n\nMegan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). So the portal cells include her entire path. So the optimal portal cells for Stanley are likely to be along the vertical and horizontal lines of Megan's path.\n\nIn the sample, Megan's path is (7,1) \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,5). So the portals are in (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), ..., (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nStanley uses (1,3) as a portal cell. He walks from (1,1) to (1,3) (2 steps), teleports to (7,3) (1 step), then walks to (7,5) (2 steps). Total 5.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal portal cell for Stanley is (1,3), which is on Megan's path.\n\nSo how to find this cell in general.\n\nPerhaps the optimal strategy is to find a cell (x, y) that is in Megan's path and allows Stanley to minimize the sum of his steps.\n\nBut what's the pattern here.\n\nMegan's path can be any path. But perhaps the optimal path for her is to go straight up to row 1, then right to column m, or right first then up. But this depends on the grid dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal portal cells are along the line between (n,1) and (1,m). So the minimal distance between Stanley's path and Megan's path.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a rectangle. Stanley's path is from top-left to bottom-right. Megan's path is from bottom-left to top-right. Their paths cross somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe optimal portal cell is where their paths cross. For example, in the sample, the cross is at (1,3) and (7,3).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when Megan's path includes a row and column that allows Stanley to split his path into two parts, each with minimal steps.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the minimal sum is achieved when Megan's path creates a portal in (1, m) and (n, 1), and Stanley uses one of those.\n\nBut the sample case shows that using intermediate portal cells is better.\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose n=3, m=3.\n\nMegan's path is from (3,1) to (1,3). The shortest path is up 2 steps and right 2 steps. Suppose she moves up first then right.\n\nSo her path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). Portals are in these cells.\n\nStanley's path is (1,1) to (3,3). He can walk directly (2+2=4 steps). Or use portals.\n\nFor example, he could walk to (1,1) (already there), teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then walk down to (3,3) (2 steps). Total cost 0+1+2=3. So sum of Megan's steps (4) plus Stanley's steps (3) is 7. Which is better than 4+4=8.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal sum is 7.\n\nSo how to compute this.\n\nIn this scenario, Megan's steps are 4 (up 2, right 2). Stanley's steps are 3.\n\nSo the sum is 4 +3 =7.\n\nSo the formula here is Megan's steps (n+m-2) \u2192 3+3-2=4. Stanley's steps are (distance to (1,3) is 0 steps (since he's already at (1,1) if he uses the portal in (1,1)) then teleport to (1,3) cost 1, then steps to (3,3) is 2.\n\nBut how to find this in code.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2.\n\nMegan's steps: 2+2-2=2. Stanley's steps: 2+2-2=2. Sum 4.\n\nBut using teleport: Stanley can walk from (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) (1 step), teleport to (2,1) (cost 1), then walk to (2,2) (1 step). Total 1+1+1=3. Sum 2+3=5. Which is worse than 4. So no gain here.\n\nSo in this case, the direct path is better.\n\nHmm. So the optimal approach depends on the grid dimensions.\n\nSo what's the pattern here.\n\nIn the first sample case (7,5), the sum is 15. Which is (7+5-2) for Megan (10) plus 5 for Stanley \u2192 15.\n\nBut how to compute 5.\n\nIn the sample, Stanley's steps are 2 (right to (1,3)) +1 (teleport) +2 (right to (7,5)) \u21925.\n\nSo how to model this.\n\nIt seems that Stanley's steps are (steps to a certain row or column) + teleport + steps to destination.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal scenario is that Stanley uses a portal cell in row 1 or column 1, then teleports to another portal cell in row n or column m.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal portal cell for Stanley is the one that allows him to minimize the sum of his steps to the portal cell plus steps from the teleported cell.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps for Stanley is the minimal between:\n\na) steps to row 1, then teleport to row n, then steps to destination.\n\nb) steps to column m, then teleport to column 1, then steps.\n\nc) steps to row n, then teleport to row 1, then steps.\n\nd) steps to column 1, then teleport to column m, then steps.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for Stanley is the minimal of:\n\n- (a) steps to reach a certain row in Megan's path, then teleport to a certain column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think of the formula for the sample case.\n\nIn the sample case, Stanley's steps are 2 (right to (1,3)) \u2192 teleport to (7,3) \u2192 2 steps right.\n\nThe total steps are 2 +1 +2=5. The direct path is 7+5-2=10 steps.\n\nSo this is a big saving.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal portal cells are (1,3) and (7,3).\n\nThese cells are along Megan's path. So how to model this.\n\nIn this case, the portal cells are in column 3.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal portal cell is in a column that is the minimal of (m+1)/2.\n\nBut for n=7, m=5, the middle column is 3. So yes.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal portal column is (m+1)/2 when m is odd, or something similar.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps for Stanley can be computed as:\n\nThe minimal steps for Stanley is min( (x steps to reach a column y) +1 + (steps from column y in row n) to destination).\n\nBut what's the best y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for Stanley is (distance from his start to (1, y)) +1 + (distance from (n, y) to (n,m)).\n\nWhich is (y-1) +1 + (m - y) = m.\n\nSimilarly, if he uses row x, then steps from (x,1) to destination (n,m).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nBut in the sample case, Stanley's steps are (1,1) \u2192 (1,3) (2 steps), teleport to (7,3) (1 step), then \u2192 (7,5) (2 steps). So total steps 2+1+2=5. Which is equal to (3-1) +1 + (5-3) = 2+1+2=5.\n\nSo the sum is (y-1) +1 + (m - y) = m.\n\nBut in this case, m=5. So 5 steps, which matches. But in the sample case, the answer for Stanley was 5 steps. But according to this formula, it's m steps.\n\nWait, no. Because 5 steps is indeed equal to m steps (5) in this case. So this formula suggests that Stanley's steps are m when he uses this particular strategy.\n\nBut in the first example (n=3, m=3), using this strategy would give Stanley's steps as 3.\n\nBut earlier example with n=3, m=3, he can do it in 3 steps (walk to (1,3) for 2 steps, teleport to (3,3), but then steps to destination is 0. So total 2+1+0=3. Which is 3 steps, which equals m steps. So yes.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nBecause when Stanley uses the portal in (1, y) to teleport to (n, y), his steps are (y-1) steps to reach (1,y), then 1 for teleport, then (m - y) steps to reach (n,m). So total steps is (y-1) +1 + (m - y) = m.\n\nSo no matter which y he chooses in this strategy, the steps are m. But how is this possible?\n\nBecause the sum (y-1) + (m-y) is (m-1), plus 1 gives m.\n\nSo this strategy gives Stanley's steps as m, regardless of y.\n\nSo this suggests that this strategy is better than the direct path when m < (n+m-2).\n\nBut when is m < (n + m-2)? This is always true when n>2.\n\nSo for n>2, this strategy is better. But how.\n\nWait, n=7, m=5 \u2192 m=5 steps, which is better than the direct path (7+5-2=10).\n\nSo this is a huge improvement.\n\nSo the formula for Stanley's steps using this strategy is m steps.\n\nBut wait, this seems to be the case when he uses a particular portal in column y. But how can he find such a column y?\n\nBecause Megan's path includes all cells from (n,1) to (1,m). So in particular, for any y between 1 and m, there is a cell (1, y) in Megan's path if she moves up first then right. Or if she moves right first then up.\n\nBut in any case, Megan's path will pass through some cells in row 1 and column m.\n\nWait, Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). So she must move up (n-1) steps and right (m-1) steps. So the order of steps can vary, but the minimal path is (n-1) + (m-1) steps.\n\nBut regardless of the order, she must pass through row 1 and column m.\n\nSo for any y in 1..m, there's a cell (1, y) in her path, as long as she moves right first then up. But if she moves up first then right, then she would reach (1,1) first (assuming n>1), then move right. But (1,1) is Stanley's starting point, which is not part of Megan's path unless n=1.\n\nSo for n>1, Megan's path must move up (n-1) steps and right (m-1) steps. So she can pass through (1, y) if she moves up first, then right.\n\nFor example, for n=7, m=5: Megan starts at (7,1), moves up to (1,1), then right to (1,5). So in this case, her path includes (1, y) for all y from 1 to 5.\n\nIn this case, Stanley can use (1,3) as a portal cell. Then teleport to (7,3) (if that's a portal cell). But (7,3) is not part of Megan's path in this scenario. Wait, this seems like a problem.\n\nWait, no. In this example, Megan's path is (7,1) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 ... \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 ... \u2192 (1,5). So (7,3) is not part of her path. So the portal cells are in row 1, columns 1 to 5.\n\nSo in this case, Stanley can walk to (1,3) (steps 2), teleport to (1,5) (cost 1), then walk down to (7,5) (steps 6). So total steps 2+1+6=9. Which is worse than the sample case's 5.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the strategy depends on how Megan's path is structured.\n\nSo the key is that Megan's path must include cells that allow Stanley to teleport between rows.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy involves Megan's path passing through cells that are in both row 1 and row n, which would allow Stanley to teleport between the rows.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Megan's path is such that she passes through a column y, where she moves from (n,1) to (n,y), then up to (1,y), then to (1,m). This way, her path includes (n,y) and (1,y). So Stanley can walk to (1,y), teleport to (n,y), then proceed to (n,m).\n\nIn this case, Stanley's steps would be:\n\n(y-1) steps to move right from (1,1) to (1,y).\n\n1 step to teleport to (n,y).\n\n(m - y) steps to move right to (n,m).\n\nTotal steps: (y-1) +1 + (m - y) = m.\n\nBut Megan's steps would be:\n\n(n-1) steps down from (n,1) to (1,1).\n\n(m-1) steps right to (1,m).\n\nWait, no. In this case, if Megan's path is (n,1) \u2192 (n, y) \u2192 (1,y) \u2192 (1,m), then her steps are (y-1) steps right \u2192 (n-1) steps up \u2192 (m -y) steps right. Total steps (y-1) + (n-1) + (m - y) = n + m -2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo this path is allowed, and the portals are in (n,y) and (1,y).\n\nSo Stanley can use these portals.\n\nThus, the minimal steps for Stanley is m steps.\n\nBut in the sample case, using this strategy would give Stanley's steps as 5, which matches m=5. But the sample case's actual steps are 5, which also matches this.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal sum is Megan's steps (n+m-2) plus Stanley's steps (m), provided that Megan's path includes a column y where she moves from (n,y) to (1,y).\n\nBut how to ensure that this is the case.\n\nAlternatively, regardless of the actual path Megan takes, the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(m, n, (n+m-2)).\n\nWait, but earlier examples suggest that Stanley's steps can be as low as m.\n\nSo the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(n + m -2, 2n-1, 2m-1, m, n).\n\nWait, in the first sample case, m=5. So 5 is the minimal for Stanley's steps (5), which is added to Megan's 10 steps to make 15.\n\nSo the formula would be (n+m-2) + m, but only if m is the minimal option.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(m, n, (n + m - 2)).\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor n=7, m=5:\n\nmin(5,7, 10) \u21925. So sum 10+5=15. Which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=3, m=3:\n\nmin(3,3,4) \u21923. Sum 4+3=7. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nFor n=2, m=2:\n\nmin(2,2,2) \u21922. Sum 2+2=4. Which is correct.\n\nFor n=3, m=5:\n\nsum would be (3+5-2)=6 + min(5,3,6)=3 \u2192 total 9. But what's the actual minimal sum.\n\nIn this case, Megan's steps are 6. Stanley's options:\n\n- Walk directly: 3+5-2=6 steps. Total sum 12.\n\n- Use teleport to (1,3) then (3,3) to destination. Steps: (3-1) steps to (1,3) \u21922 steps. Teleport to (3,3) (1 step). Then steps to (3,5): 2 steps. Total 2+1+2=5. Sum 6+5=11.\n\n- Using the m=5 strategy: steps 5. Sum 6+5=11.\n\nBut wait, 5 steps is the same as using m. But m=5. So yes.\n\nSo sum is 11.\n\nBut according to the formula (n+m-2) + m, it would be 6 +5=11. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=2.\n\nMegan's steps:5+2-2=5.\n\nStanley's options:\n\n- Walk directly:5+2-2=5 steps. Sum 5+5=10.\n\n- Use teleport via m=2 steps. So steps for Stanley would be 2. Sum 5+2=7.\n\nBut how?\n\nStanley's steps would be: (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) (1 step), teleport to (5,2) (1 step), then steps to (5,2) \u2192 no steps. Total 1+1+0=2. Sum 5+2=7. Which is better.\n\nSo according to the formula, sum is 5+2=7. Which is correct.\n\nSo it seems that the minimal sum is (n + m - 2) + min(m, n, (n + m -2)).\n\nBut wait, what if n is smaller than m?\n\nFor example, n=2, m=5.\n\nMegan's steps:2+5-2=5.\n\nStanley's steps:\n\nOption 1: m=5 steps (5 steps). Sum 5+5=10.\n\nOption 2: Use teleport via m=5. So steps: (1,1) \u2192 (1,5) (4 steps) \u2192 teleport to (2,5) (1 step) \u2192 then steps to (2,5) already there. Total 4+1=5. Sum 5+5=10.\n\nBut another option: Use n=2 steps. So Stanley's steps would be 2 steps.\n\nHow?\n\nWalk to (2,1) (n-1 steps =1), teleport to (1,1) (1 step), then walk to (2,5): 4 steps. Total 1+1+4=6. Which is worse than 5.\n\nSo the minimal is 5 steps.\n\nSo the formula (n + m -2) + min(m, n) gives 5 + 2=7, which is incorrect. So this suggests that the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. In this case, n=2, m=5. min(m, n) is 2. But according to the previous example, Stanley's steps are 5 steps if he uses the m=5 strategy. But according to the formula, it would be 2 steps. So there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, wait, in this case, min(m, n) is 2. But according to the formula, the sum would be 5+2=7. But earlier calculation showed that the sum is 10.\n\nSo the formula must be wrong.\n\nSo this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed.\n\nThis indicates that the minimal sum is not simply (n+m-2) + min(m, n).\n\nSo what's the correct approach?\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nThe minimal total energy is Megan's steps plus Stanley's steps.\n\nMegan's steps are (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2.\n\nStanley's steps can be minimized by using a teleport.\n\nStanley's steps can be:\n\nOption 1: Walk directly: (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2.\n\nOption 2: Walk to (1, y), then teleport to (n, y), then walk to (n,m).\n\nSteps: (y-1) + 1 + (m - y) = m.\n\nOption 3: Walk to (x, 1), teleport to (x, m), then walk to (n,m).\n\nSteps: (x-1) +1 + (n -x) = n.\n\nSo the minimal steps for Stanley is the minimum of (n+m-2, m, n).\n\nSo the minimal sum is (n+m-2) + min(n, m, n+m-2).\n\nWhich simplifies to (n+m-2) + min(n, m).\n\nBecause min(n, m, n+m-2) is equal to min(n, m) when n and m are at least 1.\n\nBecause for example, if n=2 and m=5:\n\nmin(n, m) =2. n+m-2=5. So min(2,5,5) is 2. So the minimal sum is 5+2=7.\n\nBut in the previous example, when n=2, m=5, Stanley's steps would be min(5,2,5) =2. But how can he achieve that?\n\nStanley can walk to (2,1) (1 step), teleport to (2,5) (1 step). Steps:1+1=2.\n\nBut how?\n\nMegan's path must include (2,1) and (2,5). (2,1) is her starting point, and (2,5) is part of her path if she moves right first. For example, she starts at (2,1), moves right to (2,5), then up to (1,5). So her path includes (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (1,5).\n\nSo in this case, (2,5) is a portal cell.\n\nStanley's steps:\n\nFrom (1,1) to (2,1): 1 step. Then teleport to (2,5): 1 step. Then from (2,5) to (2,5) (no steps). Total steps 2. So sum would be (2+5-2) + 2 =5+2=7.\n\nBut earlier calculation suggested that Stanley's steps were 5 steps. So this shows that the formula is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal steps for Stanley are 2 steps (min(n, m)), which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to be correct.\n\nSo the minimal sum is (n + m -2) + min(n, m).\n\nThis explains the sample cases:\n\nSample case 1: n=7, m=5. Sum is 7+5-2 +5=10+5=15.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=3. Sum is 3+3-2 +3=4+3=7.\n\nExample n=2, m=5: sum is 2+5-2 +2=5+2=7.\n\nExample n=5, m=2: sum is5+2-2 +2=5+2=7.\n\nExample n=2, m=2: sum is 2+2-2 +2=2+2=4.\n\nAnother example: n=1, m=1. But according to the problem statement, the starting and ending points must be different. So this case is not possible.\n\nThus, the correct formula for the minimal total energy is (n + m -2) + min(n, m).\n\nSo the code would read each test case, compute this formula, and output the result.\n\nThus, the code to be filled in would be:\n\nFor each test case, read n and m, then compute and print (n + m -2) + min(n, m).\n\nBut wait, let's check the case where n=1 and m=4.\n\nMegan's path is from (1,1) to (1,4). Her steps are 3 (right).\n\nStanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,4). He can teleport, but since he is already at the destination, steps are 0. But according to the formula, sum is (1+4-2) + min(1,4) \u21923+1=4.\n\nWhich is correct. But Megan's steps are 3, Stanley's steps are 0 (he's already at destination). Sum 3.\n\nBut according to the formula, the sum is 3+1=4. Which is incorrect.\n\nAh, there's a problem here.\n\nSo what's the issue.\n\nIn the case where n=1 and m=4.\n\nMegan's path is (1,1) to (1,4). She must walk 3 steps.\n\nStanley's path is (1,1) to (1,4). His steps can be:\n\nOption 1: walk directly:3 steps.\n\nOption 2: use teleport. He can walk to (1,1) (0 steps), teleport to any portal cell. But since he is at (1,1), which is the start of Megan's path. He can teleport to (1,4) (which is the end of Megan's path), cost 1. Then no steps needed. Total steps 0+1+0=1.\n\nSo sum is 3 (Megan's steps) +1 (Stanley's steps) =4. Which matches the formula.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo for n=1, m=4, the formula gives 3+1=4. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, Stanley's steps are 1. The formula says min(1,4) =1. So sum is (1+4-2) +1=3+1=4. Correct.\n\nThus, the formula seems to hold.\n\nThus, the correct code is for each test case, read n and m, compute (n + m -2) + min(n, m), and output that.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nlong n, m; scanf(\"%ld %ld\", &n, &m);\nprintf(\"%ld\\n\", (n + m - 2) + (n < m ? n : m));\n\nBecause min(n,m) is added to (n+m-2).\n\nSo the code inside the while loop would read n and m, compute the sum, and print it."
