Wait, let's think: in the code, when x <= y, Alice takes from the front (left) and Bob takes from the back (right). So the deque's front is the leftmost candy, and the back is the rightmost. So when reading the input, each weight w_i is added to the deque in order. So the loop should read each w_i and add to the deque. For example, the code inside the loop is:\n\ncin >> u;\nd.push_back(u); Wait, but if the first element is the leftmost, then when we process the deque, the front is the left, which is correct. So yes, the input order is left to right, so each subsequent element is added to the back. So the deque will have elements in order left to right. So for each i in 0..n-1, read the u and push into the deque. So the missing code is reading each u and pushing it into the deque.

So for each test case, the deque is filled with n elements. The loop for(i=0; i<n; i++) is the correct way. So inside that loop, each element is read into u and then added to the deque.
