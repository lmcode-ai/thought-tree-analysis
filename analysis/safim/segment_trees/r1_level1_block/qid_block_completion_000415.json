Each time you move right from i to i+1 (R_i increases by 1), you enter i+1. Then, to leave i+1, you can either move right (if possible) or move left. If you move left from i+1 to i, that's an L_{i+1} move. So the path can be considered as a series of steps that must form a loop, returning to 0. But modeling all possible R_i and L_i for all positions seems complicated, especially with large n.\n\nWe need a way to determine if the array a can be represented as R_i - L_i for all i, under the constraints of the movement path.",

Because each R move increases the position by 1, each L move decreases it by 1. To return to 0, the total number of R moves must equal L moves. So sum(R_i) = sum(L_i). But how does that help us? Let's see:\n\nEach a[i] = R_i - L_i. Sum over all a[i] = sum(R_i - L_i) = sum(R_i) - sum(L_i) = (sum R_i - sum L_i) = 0. So the sum of all elements in a must be zero. That's a necessary condition.

Wait, that's an important point. Because R_0 is the number of times you moved right from 0. Each such move contributes +1 to a[0]. Since L_0 is zero (can't leave 0 via left), then a[0] = R_0. So a[0] must be >=0. If a[0] is negative, it's impossible. So the first condition is a[0] >=0. But wait, even if a[0] is positive, but after some moves, you come back and leave again.

Then the cumulative sum up to 0 is 2, up to 1 is 1, up to 2 is 0. All non-negative. But the array in the sample is [2, -1, -1, 0], sum is 0. Wait, the cumulative sums would be 2, 1, 0, 0.

Wait, maybe the cumulative sum condition is that for all i <n-1, the cumulative sum up to i must be >0, and for i =n-1, the cumulative sum must be zero. Wait, let's think again. Suppose that during the process, the pointer must have enough right moves to reach positions beyond 0. For example, to reach position i, the cumulative sum up to i must be sufficient.",

Let's process the array from left to right, keeping track of the current \"balance\". The balance after processing the i-th element is the sum of a[0] to a[i]. For the array to be possible:\n\n1. The sum must be zero. 2. a[0] must be >=0.\n\n3. For n>1, a[n-1] must be <=0.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-2, the balance (sum of a[0..i]) must be >0. Because to move to position i+1, you must have at least one right move from i. The sum up to i is the number of times you've moved right from i, which must be positive to allow moving to i+1.

So the conditions would be:\n\n- The sum of the entire array must be zero.\n\n- a[0] >=0.\n\n- For each i from 0 to n-2, the sum of the first i+1 elements (a[0] + ... + a[i]) >0.\n\n- For the last element (if n>1), a[n-1} <=0.

So the path must form a valid loop that returns to 0. But how to model this. Let's consider the sum up to each position i: sum_i = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i]. But sum_i represents the number of times the pointer has moved right past i. Because each right move from j contributes +1 to a[j], and each left move from j+1 contributes -1 to a[j+1]. So the cumulative sum up to i is the difference between the number of right moves up to i and left moves up to i. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the sum up to i is sum_{k=0}^i a[k] = sum_{k=0}^i (R_k - L_k). But sum_{k=0}^i R_k is the total number of right moves up to i. sum_{k=0}^i L_k is the total number of left moves up to i. But during the process, each right move from k increases the pointer's position to k+1, and each left move from k decreases the position to k-1. But the sum of R and L moves must form a path that starts and ends at 0. But perhaps the sum up to i represents the net number of times the pointer has crossed from i to i+1. For example, each right move from i to i+1 increases this sum by 1.",

So during the process, the pointer can only move right from i if i <n-1. But how does that translate to the array's elements? Let's think of the sum up to i as the number of times the pointer has moved from i to i+1 (R_i) minus the number of times it has moved from i+1 to i (L_{i+1}). So sum up to i is R_i - L_{i+1} ? Not sure. Alternatively, the sum up to i is the total number of times the pointer has entered i+1 from i (R_i) minus the number of times it has left i+1 to i (L_{i+1}). But this is getting too vague. Alternative approach: Let's think of the process as a series of steps. For each step, the pointer is at position j. It can move right (if possible) or left (if possible). Each move affects the array and the pointer's position.",

But in the sample, the cumulative sum up to i=2 is zero, which is not positive. Yet the sample is valid. Hmm. So this suggests that the earlier idea about cumulative sums needing to be positive is incorrect. Let's re-examine the sample:\n\nSample input array: [2, -1, -1, 0]. The cumulative sums are:\n\nsum0=2, sum1=1, sum2=0, sum3=0. But the sample is valid. So during the process, the pointer must have passed position 2 to reach position 3. How is that possible if the sum up to 2 is zero? Wait, let's think of the sequence of moves in the sample:",

R \u2192 [1,1,0,0], pointer at 2.\n\n3. L \u2192 [1,1,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\n4. L \u2192 [1,0,-1,0], pointer at 0. 5. R \u2192 [2,0,-1,0], pointer at 1. 6. R \u2192 [2,0,0,0], pointer at 2.\n\n7. L \u2192 [2,0,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\n8. L \u2192 [2,-1,-1,0], pointer at 0. Yes, this gives the desired array. Now, let's compute the cumulative sums for each i:\n\ni=0: sum=2 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=1: 2 + (-1) =1 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=2: 2 + (-1) + (-1) =0 \u2192 sum up to 2 is zero. i=3: sum zero. But according to the previous conditions, the sum up to i=2 (third element in 0-based, which is a[2]) is zero, which should be invalid. But the sample is valid. So the earlier conditions are not correct. This indicates that the cumulative sum up to i can be zero for i <n-1. So what's the correct condition? Perhaps the condition is that the cumulative sum up to i must be >=0 for all i <n-1, and the sum up to n-1 is zero. Also, a[0] >=0 and a[n-1} <=0 (if n>1). But in the sample, the sum up to i=2 is zero, which is allowed, since it's >=0. Oh wait, the earlier proposed condition was that it must be >0. But perhaps it's sufficient for the cumulative sum to be >=0 for i <n-1, and for i =n-1, the sum must be zero. In the sample, i=2 is the third element (0-based index 2) in a array of length 4. So i=2 is not the last element (n-1 is 3). So the condition is sum up to i=2 >=0. Which it is (zero >=0). So this would be allowed. So the revised conditions are:\n\n1. Sum of all elements is zero. 2. a[0] >=0. 3. For n>1, a[n-1] <=0.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-2, the cumulative sum up to i is >=0.\n\n5. The cumulative sum up to n-1 is zero (which is automatically satisfied by condition 1). Let's test these conditions against the sample. Sample:\n\nsum is zero: yes.\n\na[0}=2 >=0: yes.\n\nn=4>1. a[3}=0 <=0: yes. For i=0: sum=2 >=0.\n\ni=1: sum=1 >=0.\n\ni=2: sum=0 >=0. All conditions are met. So it's valid. Another example: array [1,-1], sum zero. a[0}=1 >=0. a[1}=-1 <=0 (n>1). sum up to i=0 is 1 >=0. So conditions are met. Valid. Another example: [2,-1,-1,0], as in sample: valid. Another example: [1, -2, 1], sum is zero.\n\na[0}=1 >=0.\n\na[2}=1 <=0? No. So condition 3 not met. Invalid. Another example: [0,0,0], n=3. sum zero. a[0}=0 > =0.\n\na[2}=0 <=0.\n\nsum up to i=0:0 >=0. sum up to i=1:0 >=0. Conditions met. Valid. But how can this array be achieved? For example, the pointer starts at 0. To create a[0}=0, R_0=0. So no right moves. But the pointer must end at 0. So no moves at all. The array is all zeros. So this is valid. Another example: [1, 0, -1]. sum 0. a[0}=1 >=0. a[2}=-1 <=0. sum up to i=0:1 >=0. sum up to i=1:1+0=1 >=0. Conditions met. So valid. Yes, the steps could be R from 0 to 1, R from 1 to 2, then L from 2 to 1 (a[2} becomes -1), L from 1 to 0 (a[1} becomes -1), but wait, the array would be [1, -1, -1]. So this example is different. Hmm. But perhaps there's a way to reach [1, 0, -1]. For example:\n\nStart at 0. R to 1 (a[0}=1, pointer at 1). R to 2 (a[1}=1, pointer at 2). L to 1 (a[2}=-1, pointer at 1). R to 2 (a[1}=2, pointer at 2). L to 1 (a[2}=-2, pointer at 1). L to 0 (a[1}=1, pointer at 0). But this leaves the array as [1,1,-2], sum 0. Hmm. Not sure. But the conditions are met, so according to the problem's criteria, it should be valid. But perhaps the array is not actually possible. This suggests that the conditions are necessary but not sufficient. So what's the correct approach? The key is to find all the necessary and sufficient conditions for the array to be valid. Let's think again about the process. The pointer must start and end at position 0. Each move to the right from i contributes +1 to a[i], each move to the left from i contributes -1 to a[i]. The sum of the entire array must be zero. For the pointer to end at 0, the number of right moves must equal the number of left moves. The first element a[0] must be >=0 (since each R from 0 contributes +1, and L from 0 is impossible. So a[0} = R_0 - L_0 = R_0, since L_0=0. So a[0} must be >=0. Similarly, the last element a[n-1} must be <=0 (if n>1). Because R_{n-1}=0 (can't move right from last element), so a[n-1} = R_{n-1} - L_{n-1} = - L_{n-1} <=0. The cumulative sum up to each position i (sum_{0..i} a[k}) must be >=0.",

If this sum is zero at any point before the last position, it means that the pointer can't proceed further right, but during the process, it must have done so to reach the necessary positions. So, the conditions are:\n\n1. sum(a) ==0.\n\n2. a[0] >=0.\n\n3. For n>1, a[n-1} <=0.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-2, the cumulative sum of a[0..i} >=0. These conditions must be met for the array to be possible. Let's test these conditions against the sample:\n\nSample array [2,-1,-1,0}:\n\nsum 0 \u2192 yes.\n\na[0}=2 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\na[3}=0 <=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nCumulative sums:\n\ni=0 \u21922 >=0.\n\ni=1 \u21921 >=0.\n\ni=2 \u21920 > =0.\n\nAll conditions met \u2192 valid. Another example: [1,-1], sum 0. a[0}=1 >=0, a[1}=-1 <=0. cumulative sum up to 0 is 1 >=0 \u2192 valid. Another example: [1,0,-1}, sum 0. a[0}=1 >=0. a[2}=-1 <=0. cumulative sums: 1, 1, 0. For i=0: 1 >=0. For i=1:1 >=0. So conditions met \u2192 valid. But how to achieve this array? One possible path:\n\nR from 0 \u2192 a[0}=1, pointer at 1.\n\nR from 1 \u2192 a[1}=1, pointer at 2.\n\nL from 2 \u2192 a[2}=-1, pointer at 1. L from 1 \u2192 a[1}=0, pointer at 0. So the array is [1,0,-1}, pointer at 0. Yes, valid. Thus, the conditions seem to hold. So the steps to solve the problem are: For each test case:\n\n- Check if sum of a is zero. If not, output No.\n\n- Check if a[0} <0 \u2192 No.\n\n- If n>1 and a[n-1} >0 \u2192 No.\n\n- Compute the cumulative sum up to each i from 0 to n-2. If any of these sums is negative \u2192 No. Otherwise, output Yes. Now, let's look at the code provided. The code reads t test cases. For each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a array. Then, in the for loop, the code processes each element, and computes sum, checks validity. The variables in the code:\n\nsum is the total sum. valid is a boolean. zeroed is a boolean, but not sure why. The original code's comment has a placeholder.",

Also, compute the total sum. So, the code in the for loop should:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nAdd a[i} to sum. If i ==0: check if a[i} <0. If so, valid = false. If i ==n-1 and n>1: check if a[i} >0. If so, valid = false. For all i <n-1: check cumulative sum up to i >=0. If any of them is <0, valid = false. So, the code in the for loop can track the current cumulative sum. So, the missing code should:\n\n- Track the cumulative sum up to each i.\n\n- For each i, perform the checks. Here's the code structure inside the for loop:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i <n; ++i) {\n\n   long current = a[i];\n\n   sum += current;\n\n   if (i ==0) {\n\n       if (current <0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i ==n-1 && n>1) {\n\n       if (current >0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   // cumulative sum up to i\n\n   long cum = ... ? if (i <n-1) {\n\n       if (cum <0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n} But how to track the cumulative sum? We can have a variable that tracks the cumulative sum as we process each element. So, in the code:\n\nInitialize a variable cumSum =0. For each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   cumSum += a[i]. if (i <n-1 && cumSum <0) \u2192 invalid. So, the code inside the for loop should:\n\n- Check if it's the first element and is negative. - Check if it's the last element and n>1 and is positive.\n\n- For all i, accumulate cumSum, and if i <n-1 and cumSum <0, mark invalid. Thus, the code inside the for loop should be:\n\nlong cumSum =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   long ai = ... ; // read a[i}\n\n   cumSum += ai;\n\n   if (i ==0) {\n\n       if (ai <0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i ==n-1 && n>1) {\n\n       if (ai >0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i <n-1 && cumSum <0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   sum += ai;\n\n} Wait, but in the code, the sum is the total sum.",

Yes. But in the code provided, the sum is being accumulated in a variable called sum. The code also needs to track the cumulative sum. So, the code in the for loop should look something like:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    long a_i = ...; // read the current element.\n\n    sum += a_i;\n\n    if (i ==0 && a_i <0) valid = false;\n\n    if (i == n-1 && n >1 && a_i >0) valid = false;\n\n    // accumulate cumulative sum\n\n    if (i < n-1) {\n\n        cumSum += a_i;\n\n        if (cumSum <0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut wait, the cumulative sum for i=0 to i= n-2 is the sum of a[0] to a[i]. Because for i <n-1, the cumulative sum up to i is needed. Wait, for example, for i=0 (n>1), we check cumSum =a[0}. For i=1, cumSum +=a[1}, etc. Yes. So the cumulative sum for each i <n-1 is the sum of a[0} to a[i}. So, in code:\n\ncumSum starts at 0. For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   cumSum += a[i}. if (i <n-1) {\n\n       check if cumSum <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\n   }\n\nBut then, for i= n-1, cumSum is the sum of all elements, which is checked outside the loop. But in the code provided, the sum is accumulated in sum variable. So, the code can use sum to track the cumulative sum. Wait, no. Because sum is the total sum of all elements. For example, in the for loop, after processing i=0, sum is a[0}. For i=1, sum is a[0}+a[1}, etc. But for checking the cumulative sum up to i <n-1, we need to check the sum after each step. So:\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   sum += a[i}. if (i ==0) check a[i} <0. if (i ==n-1 and n>1) check a[i} >0. if (i <n-1) check sum >=0. So, this way, sum is the cumulative sum up to i. Then, for i <n-1, check if sum >=0. Yes. So the code can be written as:\n\nInside the for loop:\n\nlong ai = ...;\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i ==0) {\n\n    if (ai <0) valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i ==n-1 && n>1) {\n\n    if (ai >0) valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i <n-1) {\n\n    if (sum <0) valid = false;\n\n} So the code inside the loop should read the current element (ai), add to sum, and perform the checks. But how to read the elements in the code provided? In the current code, the for loop is:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nInside this loop, we need to read a_i. But the code uses a StreamTokenizer, and the nextInt() function reads the next token. So for each element in the array, we can read it using nextInt(), but since the elements can be up to 1e9, but nextInt() returns int, which may overflow.",

But in the problem statement, the a_i can be up to 1e9, which is within the range of int (which is up to 2e9). Wait, no.

So yes, it's safe. But if the input is -1e9, which is -1000000000, which is greater than Integer. MIN_VALUE (-2147483648). So yes. So the code can read the a_i as integers. But the code may need to process them as longs to avoid overflow when summing. But sum is declared as a long in the code. So adding int values to long is okay. So, in the code, each a_i is read as an int, but stored in a long variable. So, in the for loop, the code can read each a_i as nextInt(), cast to long. Wait, but nextInt() returns an int. So for example:\n\nlong ai = nextInt();\n\nBut if a_i is within the int range, this is okay. So, the code inside the for loop can be:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai; But wait, the sum is a long. So adding each ai as an int to sum is okay. So, the code inside the for loop would:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i <n; ++i) {\n\n   int ai = nextInt();\n\n   sum += ai;\n\n   if (i ==0 && ai <0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i ==n-1 && n>1 && ai >0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i <n-1 && sum <0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n} But there's also the condition for the last element (ai >0 for n>1). But what about when n==1? Then, the last element is a[0}, which must be zero (since sum is zero). But in this case, the code already checks sum ==0. So for n==1, the a[0} must be zero, and the code will have sum ==0 if valid. But for n==1, the code's 'sum' is a[0}, and the code checks sum ==0 (in the final if statement). So for n==1, the code will correctly check if a[0} is zero. Thus, the code inside the for loop is:\n\nfor each element:\n\n   read ai.\n\n   sum += ai. if it's the first element and ai <0 \u2192 invalid. if it's the last element, n>1, and ai >0 \u2192 invalid. if i <n-1 and sum <0 \u2192 invalid. Thus, the missing code inside the loop should implement these checks. The code in the original problem's loop is:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i <n; ++i) {\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n} So, the code inside should:\n\n- Read ai (using nextInt()).\n\n- Update sum.\n\n- Check the first element. - Check the last element. - Check the cumulative sum for i <n-1.",

But since sum is the total sum, which is initially zero and is being added each ai, after each iteration, sum is the cumulative sum up to i. Thus, the code inside the loop is:\n\nint ai = nextInt(); // read the current element. sum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0 && ai < 0) {\n\n    valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i == n-1 && n > 1 && ai > 0) {\n\n    valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) {\n\n    valid = false;\n\n} So, that's the code to be filled in. But in Java, we have to read the ai correctly. However, the code uses the StreamTokenizer, which is configured to read tokens. So, in the code, nextInt() reads the next token as an integer. Thus, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0 && ai < 0) valid = false;\n\nif (i == n-1 && n > 1 && ai > 0) valid = false; if (i < n-1 && sum < 0) valid = false;\n\nBut note that once valid is set to false, it remains false even if other conditions are met. So in the code, once any of the conditions fails, valid becomes false and stays that way. Thus, the code inside the loop is:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0) {\n\n    if (ai < 0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i == n-1) {\n\n    if (n > 1 && ai > 0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i < n-1) {\n\n    if (sum < 0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n} Thus, this is the code that should be filled in. Now, let's test this code against the sample input. Sample input:\n\nn=4, a=[2,-1,-1,0]. Loop steps:\n\ni=0:\n\nai=2. sum=2. i==0: 2 >=0 \u2192 valid remains true. i <3 (n-1 is 3). sum=2 >=0 \u2192 valid. i=1:\n\nai=-1. sum=2-1=1. i <3: sum=1 >=0 \u2192 valid. i=2:\n\nai=-1. sum=1-1=0. i <3: sum=0 >=0 \u2192 valid. i=3: ai=0. sum=0. i ==3 and n>1 \u2192 ai=0 <=0 \u2192 valid remains true. Thus, all conditions are met. valid is true. sum is 0 \u2192 output Yes. Which is correct. Another example: n=1. a[0}=0.\n\ni=0:\n\nai=0. sum=0. i==0: 0 >=0 \u2192 valid. i is not <0 (since n=1, i=0 is not <0 \u2192 no check. sum ==0 \u2192 output Yes. Another example: n=2, a=[1,-1]. i=0:\n\nai=1. sum=1. i==0: ok. i <1 (since n-1=1, i=0 <1 \u2192 sum >=0 \u2192 yes. i=1:\n\nai=-1. sum=0. i==1 and n>1: ai=-1 <=0 \u2192 ok. Thus, valid. sum=0 \u2192 yes. Another example: [0,0,0], n=3.\n\nsum=0. i=0: ai=0 >=0 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=0: sum 0 >=0 \u2192 but sum <0 is false. So valid. i=1: sum 0 >=0 \u2192 valid. i=2: ai=0 <=0 \u2192 ok. Thus, yes. Another example: [1, 0, -1], sum=0. i=0: ai=1 \u22650 \u2192 ok. sum=1 \u22650 (i <2). i=1: ai=0. sum=1 +0=1 >=0 \u2192 ok. i=2: ai=-1 \u22640 \u2192 ok.\n\nsum is 0 \u2192 yes. Thus, code should output yes. Thus, the code inside the for loop should be:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0) {\n\n    if (ai <0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i == n-1) {\n\n    if (n >1 && ai >0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i < n-1) {\n\n    if (sum <0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n} Thus, this is the missing code.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine whether a given array can be obtained through a series of operations with the pointer ending up on the first element. Let's think about the constraints and how the operations affect the array.\n\nSo, the operations allowed are:\n1. If not on the last element, increase the current element by 1 and move to the next.\n2. If not on the first element, decrease the current element by 1 and move to the previous.\n\nAfter all operations, the pointer must be on the first element.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how each element in the array is built up. Let's model the process. Let's imagine that each time we move right, we add 1 to the current position. Each time we move left, we subtract 1 from the current position.\n\nWait, but each operation is a combination of an action (increment or decrement) and a movement. For example, moving right: you increment the current position, then move right. So each step right leaves a +1 in the current cell (before moving). Similarly, moving left: you decrement the current cell, then move left. So the movement affects which cell is modified next.\n\nThe key is to model the conditions that the array must satisfy after all these operations. Let's consider the process step by step.\n\nLet's think of the sequence of movements. The pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based here, but in code it's 0-based maybe). Let's model the path of the pointer.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to model the problem by considering the necessary conditions the array must satisfy. Let's think recursively. For the array to be valid:\n\n- The first element (a[0]) must be non-negative. Because every time you move right from position 0, you add 1 to a[0] and move right. But if you have any right moves, a[0] increases. However, once you move right, you can come back left, which would decrease a[1], then a[0] again. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the process.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the number of times the pointer moves right and left between positions. For example, the pointer starts at position 0. Each time you move right from position i to i+1, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you move left from position j to j-1, you subtract 1 from a[j]. The total number of right and left moves must form a valid path that starts and ends at position 0.\n\nWait, the pointer starts at 0. Let's model the path as a sequence of moves. For example, the moves can be R (right) or L (left). Each R increases the current position's value by 1 and moves right. Each L decreases the current position's value by 1 and moves left. The entire sequence of moves must start and end at 0.\n\nSo for example, a valid sequence could be R R L L, which would end at 0 again. Let's see: starting at 0. R: a[0] +=1, move to 1. Then R: a[1] +=1, move to 2. Then L: a[2] -=1, move to 1. Then L: a[1] -=1, move to 0. So the final array is [1, 0, -1], and pointer is at 0.\n\nThe problem is to determine if the given array a can be achieved through such a sequence of moves, ending at position 0.\n\nSo how can we model the necessary conditions for the array a to be valid?\n\nLet's think about the process of building the array. Each move to the right (R) increases the current position and moves right. Each move to the left (L) decreases the current position and moves left. The pointer must end at 0.\n\nThe process is such that every time we move right from position i to i+1, we contribute +1 to a[i]. Similarly, every time we move left from position i+1 to i, we contribute -1 to a[i+1]. \n\nBut the path of the pointer can be complex. For example, you can have multiple R and L moves. But the key is that the net movement must end at 0. So the total number of R moves minus L moves must be zero? Or not exactly, because the path can go beyond and return. Wait, no. The path's start and end must be 0. So the number of R and L moves must form a path that starts and ends at 0, which implies that the number of R moves equals the number of L moves. Because each R is a step to the right, each L is a step to the left. To return to the start, the total steps to the right must equal steps to the left.\n\nBut how does that affect the array?\n\nAlternatively, let's model the array a as being built by the sum of the times each position is entered and exited in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model each element a[i] as the difference between the number of times we exited to the right from i and the number of times we entered from the left into i. Or perhaps not. Let's think differently.\n\nLet's model the movement. Let's track the number of times the pointer leaves a cell to the right (R moves) and to the left (L moves).\n\nFor position i:\n\nEach time we leave i to the right (R move), we add 1 to a[i]. Then we are at i+1.\n\nEach time we leave i+1 to the left (L move), we subtract 1 from a[i+1], and then move to i.\n\nSo the value of a[i] is equal to the number of R moves from i minus the number of L moves into i from the right (i+1). Wait, perhaps not. Let's see:\n\nWait, when you make an R move from i to i+1, you add 1 to a[i]. Then you are at i+1. If you then make an L move from i+1 to i, you subtract 1 from a[i+1], then move to i.\n\nSo the a[i] is the number of times you exited i to the right (R moves from i), minus the number of times you entered i from the left (which would be L moves from i+1 to i). Because each entry into i via a left move from i+1 would have subtracted 1 from a[i+1], but that doesn't directly affect a[i]. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the process as a sequence of steps and track the state. Each step is either R or L, and each step affects the current cell before moving.\n\nLet's think of the entire sequence of moves as building the array a. Let's track the pointer's position and the array's elements.\n\nSuppose we start at position 0. The initial array is all zeros. Let's consider that for each position i, the number of times we leave it via R (to the right) is R_i, and the number of times we leave it via L (to the left) is L_i. Wait, but you can't leave position 0 via L, because you can't move left from there. Similarly, you can't leave position n-1 via R.\n\nWait, but L_i would be the number of times you leave position i via left (i.e., you were in i, then made an L move to i-1). But for i=0, L_i must be zero. Similarly, for the last position, R_i must be zero.\n\nNow, the value of a[i] is equal to the number of times you made an R move from i (R_i) plus the number of times you made an L move from i (L_i) multiplied by some factor. Wait, no. Wait, each R move from i adds 1 to a[i]. Each L move from i subtracts 1 from a[i]. Because when you make an L move from i, you subtract 1 from a[i] and then move to i-1.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\n- When you make an R move from i (current position is i, not last), you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. So R_i is the number of R moves made from i. Each such move contributes +1 to a[i].\n\n- When you make an L move from i (current position is i, not first), you subtract 1 from a[i], then move to i-1. So L_i is the number of L moves made from i. Each such move contributes -1 to a[i].\n\nSo the total a[i] is equal to (R_i) - (L_i).\n\nBut also, the movement must form a valid path. The path starts at 0 and ends at 0. So the movement must form a valid sequence where the pointer starts at 0 and ends at 0.\n\nBut how do R_i and L_i relate to each other? Let's think about the movement between positions.\n\nEach time you move right from i to i+1 (R_i increases by 1), you enter i+1. Then, to leave i+1, you can either move right (if possible) or move left. If you move left from i+1 to i, that's an L_{i+1} move.\n\nSo the path can be considered as a series of steps that must form a loop, returning to 0. But modeling all possible R_i and L_i for all positions seems complicated, especially with large n.\n\nWe need a way to determine if the array a can be represented as R_i - L_i for all i, under the constraints of the movement path.\n\nAnother observation: The pointer must end at 0. So the total number of moves to the right (sum of all R_i) must equal the total number of moves to the left (sum of all L_i). Because each R move increases the position by 1, each L move decreases it by 1. To return to 0, the total number of R moves must equal L moves. So sum(R_i) = sum(L_i).\n\nBut how does that help us? Let's see:\n\nEach a[i] = R_i - L_i.\n\nSum over all a[i] = sum(R_i - L_i) = sum(R_i) - sum(L_i) = (sum R_i - sum L_i) = 0. So the sum of all elements in a must be zero. That's a necessary condition. So if the sum is not zero, the answer is immediately No.\n\nBut the sample input might have sum zero but still be invalid. For example, the first sample in the note: the array is [2, -1, -1, 0], sum is 0. So sum zero is a necessary condition, but not sufficient.\n\nAnother necessary condition is that the cumulative sum up to each position must be non-negative and the last element must be zero. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWait, let's think about the process of building the array. Let's consider the movement sequence. Each time you move right, you add 1 to the current position and proceed. But when you move left, you subtract 1 from the current position and move back. The pointer must end at position 0.\n\nSo during the entire process, the pointer can't go beyond the array. So when moving right, you can't go past the last element. Similarly, moving left can't go past the first element.\n\nBut how to model this for the array a.\n\nAnother approach: Let's process the array from left to right. For each position i, the value a[i] plus the number of times you leave i via left (L_i) must equal the number of times you leave i via right (R_i). Because a[i] = R_i - L_i. So R_i = a[i] + L_i.\n\nBut how does L_i relate to R_{i+1}?\n\nWhen you move right from i (R_i times), you enter i+1. Then, any left moves from i+1 (L_{i+1} times) must be preceded by R_{i+1} or other movements. But perhaps there's a relationship here.\n\nWait, each left move from i+1 (L_{i+1} times) must correspond to a right move into i+1 from i (R_i), or from i+1 via right moves from previous positions. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the pointer can move to i+1 via R from i, then move further right via R from i+1, then left from i+2, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times the pointer is at position i+1 and moves left (L_{i+1} times) can't exceed the number of times the pointer entered i+1 via right moves from i (R_i) plus any right moves from i+1 (R_{i+1}) but that seems messy.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of times we can leave i+1 via left moves (L_{i+1}) is at most the number of times we entered i+1 via right moves (from i or via some path).\n\nAlternatively, think of the movement as a path. Each time you enter a position i from the left (via a right move from i-1) or from the right (via a left move from i+1). The total number of times you leave i via left (L_i) cannot exceed the number of times you entered i from the right plus the number of times you entered from the left. But this might not be helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Let's model the process as follows. For the array to be valid, the following conditions must hold:\n\n1. The sum of all elements must be 0 (since sum(R_i - L_i) = sum(R_i) - sum(L_i) = 0).\n\n2. For all i from 0 to n-1, the cumulative sum up to i must be non-negative. Because when building the array, the pointer can't go beyond the end. Wait, how?\n\nWait, during the process, the pointer can't move beyond the array. So when moving right, you can't go beyond the last element. So for the pointer to reach position i, there must be a sufficient number of right moves. Wait, perhaps the cumulative sum up to each position (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i]) must be >=0. Because each time you move right from position j to j+1, you add 1 to a[j], which contributes to the sum. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the cumulative sum as the net number of times the pointer has passed through certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, consider the process of building the array. The pointer starts at 0, and ends at 0. Each time you move right, you increase a[i] and go to i+1. Each time you move left, you decrease a[i] and go to i-1.\n\nThe key is that the path must never go beyond the array's bounds. So when moving right from position i, i must be less than n-1. Similarly, when moving left from i, i must be greater than 0.\n\nBut how does this affect the array's structure?\n\nAnother observation: The first element (a[0]) must be >=0. Because every time you leave it via R, you add 1. But after that, you can come back via L from 1, which would subtract 1 from a[1], but that doesn't directly affect a[0]. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nEach R from 0 increases a[0] by 1. Then, each L from 1 (to go back to 0) would subtract 1 from a[1], but then when you leave 0 again via R, you add 1 to a[0] again. So a[0] can be built up as R_0 - L_0, but L_0 is zero (since you can't leave 0 via L). So R_0 = a[0], L_0 =0. Wait, but if you are at 0 and you make a right move, a[0] increases by 1 and you move to 1. Then, from 1, making a left move would decrease a[1] by 1 and move back to 0. So for a[0], the total is R_0 - L_0. But L_0 is the number of times you left 0 via left, which is zero. So a[0] = R_0. So a[0] must be >=0. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because R_0 is the number of times you moved right from 0. Each such move contributes +1 to a[0]. Since L_0 is zero (can't leave 0 via left), then a[0] = R_0. So a[0] must be >=0. If a[0] is negative, it's impossible.\n\nSo the first condition is a[0] >=0.\n\nBut wait, even if a[0] is positive, but after some moves, you come back and leave again. For example, starting at 0, move right (a[0] becomes 1), then move right again (a[1] becomes 1, pointer at 2). Then, move left (a[2] becomes -1, pointer at 1). Then move left again (a[1] becomes 0, pointer at 0). Then move right (a[0] becomes 2). So after these steps, a[0] is 2, which is R_0=2. So yes.\n\nSo a[0] must be >=0.\n\nSimilarly, the last element (a[n-1]) must be <=0. Because you can't move right from the last element, so any time you are in the last element, you can only move left (if possible). But moving left from the last element is allowed only if it's not the first element. So for n=1, the only element is a[0], which must be 0 (since sum is zero, and a[0] must be >=0 and sum to zero). But for n>1, a[n-1] can be any value, but how?\n\nWait, no. The last element's a[i] is R_i - L_i. But since you can't move right from the last element, R_{n-1} is zero. So a[n-1] = -L_{n-1}. Since L_{n-1} is the number of times you left the last element via left (so you can only do that if the last element is not the first element, i.e., n>1). So a[n-1} = - L_{n-1} <=0. So for n>1, the last element must be <=0. For n=1, the sum is a[0} =0, which is allowed.\n\nSo this gives another condition: for n>1, a[n-1} <=0.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. sum(a) must be 0.\n\n2. a[0} >=0.\n\n3. for n>1, a[n-1} <=0.\n\nAdditionally, for each i from 1 to n-2 (if n >=3), there may be other conditions.\n\nWait, but how about the other elements?\n\nAnother important condition: For each position i (0 < i < n-1), the cumulative sum up to i (sum_{k=0}^i a[k}) must be >=0. Because when moving through the array, you must have sufficient right moves to reach i+1. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think.\n\nLet's imagine the process. The pointer starts at 0, and moves right and left. The key is that during the process, the pointer can't go beyond the array's bounds. So whenever the pointer is at position i (not last), it can move right. When moving right, you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. Similarly, when moving left, you subtract 1 from a[i], then move to i-1.\n\nBut the cumulative sum up to i (sum_{0}^i a[k}) is equal to the total number of times the pointer has moved right from position i (R_i) minus the sum of L_i for all i up to that point. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the sum up to i (sum_{0}^i a[k}) = sum_{0}^i (R_k - L_k) = sum R_k (0..i) - sum L_k (0..i).\n\nBut since the total sum of R equals the sum of L, the sum up to i is (sum R_0..i - sum L_0..i). But the total sum (sum R - sum L) is zero. So the sum up to i is equal to (sum L_{i+1..n-1} - sum R_{i+1..n-1} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum up to i as the number of times the pointer has passed through the first i+1 elements in a certain way. Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps, during the process, the pointer must have enough right moves to reach any position beyond 0. For example, to reach position 1, you must have made at least one R move from 0. But after that, you could come back. But the cumulative sum up to i could be considered as the net number of times the pointer has passed to the right beyond i.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by simulating the process:\n\nSuppose we have the array a. The process must start and end at position 0. Let's model the process as follows:\n\nWe can think of the pointer moving through the array, and each time it moves right or left, it affects the array and the pointer's position.\n\nThe key is to model the necessary constraints on the array a such that the process can be completed.\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n- The pointer starts at 0, ends at 0.\n\n- For each position i (0 <= i <n), the a[i] is R_i - L_i, where R_i is the number of right moves from i, and L_i is the number of left moves from i.\n\nBut how to model R_i and L_i in terms of the path.\n\nAnother insight comes from considering that the path must be a valid sequence of moves starting and ending at 0, and not crossing the array boundaries.\n\nLet's model the array from left to right.\n\nThe first element, a[0], must be >=0 because it is R_0 (since L_0 is zero, as you can't move left from 0).\n\nThe next element, a[1], is R_1 - L_1. But R_1 is the number of times the pointer moved right from 1 (to 2). But the pointer can only reach 1 after moving right from 0, which contributes to a[0] and moves to 1. Then, each move right from 1 (R_1) increases a[1], and each move left from 1 (L_1) decreases a[1}.\n\nBut how are these moves possible?\n\nTo reach position 1, you must have made a right move from 0 (R_0). Then, from position 1, you can move right (R_1 times) or left (L_1 times). Each move left from 1 takes you back to 0.\n\nBut the sum of R_i and L_i for each position must form a valid path that ends at 0.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to track the cumulative sum of a up to each position i, and ensure that this sum is non-negative.\n\nWait, here's an example. Suppose a[0] = 2, a[1] = -1, a[2] = -1, sum is 0. Then the cumulative sum up to 0 is 2, up to 1 is 1, up to 2 is 0. All non-negative. But the array in the sample is [2, -1, -1, 0], sum is 0. Wait, the cumulative sums would be 2, 1, 0, 0. All are non-negative.\n\nAnother example: if a[0] = 1, a[1] = -2. Sum is -1, which is invalid, so sum is not zero. So the answer is no.\n\nAnother example: a[0] = 1, a[1] = -1. Sum is zero. But the cumulative sum up to 1 is zero. Now, let's see if this array is possible.\n\nThe pointer starts at 0. R_0 = 1 (a[0] =1). So you move right to 1. Now, you can make a left move from 1 (L_1=1), which decreases a[1] by 1 (so a[1] becomes -1), then move back to 0. The pointer is now at 0, so this is valid. So the array [1,-1] is valid.\n\nBut the cumulative sum up to 1 is zero, which is allowed.\n\nAnother example: a[0] =1, a[1] =1. Sum is 2, which is not zero. So invalid.\n\nAnother example: a[0] = 1, a[1] =-1, a[2] =0. Sum is 0. But the cumulative sum up to 2 is 0. Let's see if this array is possible.\n\nThe path would be: R from 0 (a[0] becomes 1, move to 1). Then R from 1 (a[1] becomes 1, move to 2). Then L from 2 (a[2] becomes -1, move to 1). Then L from 1 (a[1] becomes 0, move to 0). But then the array would be [1,0,-1]. So the sum is zero, but the given array is [1,-1,0]. So that's a different scenario.\n\nWait, maybe the cumulative sum condition is that for all i <n-1, the cumulative sum up to i must be >0, and for i =n-1, the cumulative sum must be zero.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose that during the process, the pointer must have enough right moves to reach positions beyond 0. For example, to reach position i, the cumulative sum up to i must be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, think of the cumulative sum up to i as the number of times you have passed through i to the right, minus the left moves.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i (0 <=i <n), the sum of a[0] to a[i] must be >=0. Because that sum represents the number of times the pointer has moved right past i. Because each right move from i contributes 1 to a[i], and each left move from i+1 contributes -1 to a[i+1]. So the cumulative sum up to i is equal to the number of times the pointer has been to the right of i (i+1 or beyond), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach. Let's process the array from left to right, keeping track of the current \"balance\". The balance after processing the i-th element is the sum of a[0] to a[i]. For the array to be possible:\n\n1. The sum must be zero.\n\n2. a[0] must be >=0.\n\n3. For n>1, a[n-1] must be <=0.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-2, the balance (sum of a[0..i]) must be >0. Because to move to position i+1, you must have at least one right move from i. The sum up to i is the number of times you've moved right from i, which must be positive to allow moving to i+1. Otherwise, you can't get past i.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because, the sum up to i is the sum of (R_0 - L_0) + (R_1 - L_1) + ... + (R_i - L_i). But perhaps this sum represents the number of times you have \"excess\" right moves that allow you to reach i+1.\n\nFor example, suppose the sum up to i is zero. That would mean that the number of right moves and left moves up to i balance out. But how can the pointer reach i+1? It can't, because you need to have at least one right move from i to get to i+1. But if the sum up to i is zero, that implies that the number of right moves from i is L_i (a[i] = R_i - L_i). But sum up to i is zero: sum_{0..i} (R_j - L_j) = 0. But this includes all R_j and L_j up to i. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum up to i is the total number of times the pointer has moved past i to the right. For example, every time the pointer moves right from i to i+1, that's a R_i, which contributes 1 to a[i], and the sum up to i increases by 1. When the pointer moves left from i+1 to i, that's a L_{i+1}, which contributes -1 to a[i+1], but the sum up to i increases by a[i+1} which is (R_{i+1} - L_{i+1})). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum up to i as the number of times the pointer has moved right past i. For the pointer to reach i+1, it must have moved right from i. So the sum up to i must be positive when processing i <n-1. Otherwise, you can't move past i.\n\nSo the conditions would be:\n\n- The sum of the entire array must be zero.\n\n- a[0] >=0.\n\n- For each i from 0 to n-2, the sum of the first i+1 elements (a[0] + ... + a[i]) >0.\n\n- For the last element (if n>1), a[n-1} <=0.\n\nThese conditions seem to cover the necessary constraints.\n\nLet's test these conditions against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput array: [2, -1, -1, 0] (sum is 0).\n\nCheck conditions:\n\na[0] =2 >=0: yes.\n\nCheck for each i from 0 to n-2 (i=0,1,2):\n\ni=0: sum up to 0 is 2>0: ok.\n\ni=1: sum up to 1 is 2 + (-1) =1>0: ok.\n\ni=2: sum up to 2 is 2 + (-1) + (-1) =0: which is not >0. So according to the conditions, this would be invalid. But according to the note, the sample input is valid.\n\nWait, this suggests that the conditions are not correct. Because in the sample, the sum up to i=2 is zero. But according to the proposed condition, that should be invalid.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the array is valid. So there's a problem with the proposed conditions.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the conditions need to be adjusted.\n\nSo perhaps the condition is that for each i from 0 to n-2, the sum up to i must be positive. But in the sample, the sum up to i=2 (0-based) is zero, which is invalid. But the sample is valid. So what's wrong?\n\nWait, the sample array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Let's compute the cumulative sum:\n\nsum[0] =2.\n\nsum[1] =2 + (-1) =1.\n\nsum[2] =1 + (-1) =0.\n\nsum[3] =0 +0=0.\n\nThe sum up to i=2 is zero. According to the proposed condition, this would be invalid. But the sample is valid. So the conditions are not correct.\n\nSo there's a flaw in the earlier reasoning.\n\nThis suggests that the cumulative sum up to i can be zero for i <n-1. So the earlier conditions are not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think again about the process.\n\nThe pointer starts at 0. Each time it moves right, it increases a[i] and moves to i+1. To reach i+1, the pointer must have moved right from i. But once you reach i+1, you can move left back to i, then right again.\n\nThe key is that, after all operations, the pointer is back to 0. So the path must form a valid loop that returns to 0.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's consider the sum up to each position i: sum_i = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i].\n\nBut sum_i represents the number of times the pointer has moved right past i. Because each right move from j contributes +1 to a[j], and each left move from j+1 contributes -1 to a[j+1]. So the cumulative sum up to i is the difference between the number of right moves up to i and left moves up to i. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the sum up to i is sum_{k=0}^i a[k] = sum_{k=0}^i (R_k - L_k).\n\nBut sum_{k=0}^i R_k is the total number of right moves up to i. sum_{k=0}^i L_k is the total number of left moves up to i.\n\nBut during the process, each right move from k increases the pointer's position to k+1, and each left move from k decreases the position to k-1.\n\nBut the sum of R and L moves must form a path that starts and ends at 0.\n\nBut perhaps the sum up to i represents the net number of times the pointer has crossed from i to i+1. For example, each right move from i to i+1 increases this sum by 1. Each left move from i+1 to i decreases this sum by 1. So the sum up to i is the net number of times the pointer has moved from i to i+1 minus the number of times it has moved from i+1 to i.\n\nBut how does that help us?\n\nThe key is that the pointer must never be forced to move beyond the array. For example, to move from i to i+1, i must be less than n-1. So during the process, the pointer can only move right from i if i <n-1. \n\nBut how does that translate to the array's elements?\n\nLet's think of the sum up to i as the number of times the pointer has moved from i to i+1 (R_i) minus the number of times it has moved from i+1 to i (L_{i+1}).\n\nSo sum up to i is R_i - L_{i+1} ?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the sum up to i is the total number of times the pointer has entered i+1 from i (R_i) minus the number of times it has left i+1 to i (L_{i+1}).\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the process as a series of steps. For each step, the pointer is at position j. It can move right (if possible) or left (if possible). Each move affects the array and the pointer's position.\n\nWe need to find a way to model the necessary conditions on the array a such that there exists a valid sequence of moves ending at 0.\n\nAnother idea: The sum up to i must be non-negative for all i. Because if at any point the cumulative sum becomes negative, it implies that there are more left moves than right moves up to that point, which would mean that the pointer couldn't have reached that position.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. For example, to reach position i, the pointer must have made at least one right move from each j <i. But if the cumulative sum up to i is negative, that would imply that there have been more left moves than right moves, which would make it impossible to reach i+1.\n\nBut in the sample, the cumulative sum up to i=2 is zero, which is not positive. Yet the sample is valid.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the earlier idea about cumulative sums needing to be positive is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-examine the sample:\n\nSample input array: [2, -1, -1, 0]. The cumulative sums are:\n\nsum0=2, sum1=1, sum2=0, sum3=0.\n\nBut the sample is valid. So during the process, the pointer must have passed position 2 to reach position 3. How is that possible if the sum up to 2 is zero?\n\nWait, let's think of the sequence of moves in the sample:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n0 \u21921 (R, a[0] becomes 1)\n\n1 \u21920 (L, a[1] becomes -1)\n\n0 \u21921 (R, a[0] becomes 2)\n\n1 \u21922 (R, a[1] becomes 0)\n\n2 \u21923 (R, a[2] becomes 0)\n\n3 \u21922 (L, a[3] becomes -1)\n\n2 \u21921 (L, a[2] becomes -1)\n\n1 \u21920 (L, a[1] becomes -1)\n\nBut wait, the array after these steps would be [2, -1, -1, -1], sum is -1, which is not correct. So this path isn't correct.\n\nThe sample's actual sequence is as follows:\n\nThe example steps are:\n\nInitial state: [0,0,0,0], pointer at 0.\n\nStep 1: R \u2192 [1, 0, 0, 0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 2: R \u2192 [1, 1, 0, 0], pointer at 2.\n\nStep 3: L \u2192 [1,1,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 4: L \u2192 [1,0,-1,0], pointer at 0.\n\nStep 5: R \u2192 [2,0,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 6: R \u2192 [2,1,-1,0], pointer at 2.\n\nStep 7: L \u2192 [2,1,-2,0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 8: L \u2192 [2,0,-2,0], pointer at 0.\n\nBut after these steps, the array is [2,0,-2,0], which sum is zero, but the desired array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. So perhaps my reconstruction is wrong.\n\nThe sample's steps according to the note are:\n\nStart: [0,0,0,0], pointer at 0.\n\nStep 1: R \u2192 [1,0,0,0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 2: R \u2192 [1,1,0,0], pointer at 2.\n\nStep 3: L \u2192 [1,1,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 4: L \u2192 [1,0,-1,0], pointer at 0.\n\nStep 5: R \u2192 [2,0,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 6: R \u2192 [2,0,-1,0] \u2192 after moving right, a[1] becomes 0, pointer at 2.\n\nStep 7: L \u2192 [2,0,-2,0], pointer at 1.\n\nStep 8: L \u2192 [2,-1,-2,0], pointer at 0.\n\nWait, this gives a[1] as -1 and a[2] as -2, which is not matching the sample's array. I'm getting confused here.\n\nThe sample's note shows the following steps:\n\nThe array in the second test case is [2, -1, -1, 0].\n\nThe steps given are:\n\nInitial state: (0,0,0,0) with pointer on first element.\n\n\u2192 R \u2192 (1,0,0,0) \u2192 pointer on 1.\n\n\u2192 R \u2192 (1,1,0,0) \u2192 pointer on 2.\n\n\u2192 L \u2192 (1,1,-1,0) \u2192 pointer on 1.\n\n\u2192 L \u2192 (2, -1, -1,0) \u2192 pointer on 0.\n\nWait, how does the L step from 1 to 0 change a[1]?\n\nAh, in the third step (pointer at 2), the L move decreases a[2] by 1 (making it -1) and moves to 1. Then, the fourth step is a L move from 1 to 0: a[1] is decreased by 1 (from 1 to 0) and then move to 0. So the array after four steps is [1, 0, -1, 0], pointer at 0. Then another R move to 1: a[0] becomes 2, pointer at 1. Then R move to 2: a[1] becomes 1-1=0? I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to model the sample step by step.\n\nSample's steps:\n\n1. [0,0,0,0] \u2192 R \u2192 [1,0,0,0], pointer at 1.\n\n2. R \u2192 [1,1,0,0], pointer at 2.\n\n3. L \u2192 [1,1,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\n4. L \u2192 [1,0,-1,0], pointer at 0.\n\n5. R \u2192 [2,0,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\n6. R \u2192 [2,0,0,0], pointer at 2.\n\n7. L \u2192 [2,0,-1,0], pointer at 1.\n\n8. L \u2192 [2,-1,-1,0], pointer at 0.\n\nYes, this gives the desired array. Now, let's compute the cumulative sums for each i:\n\ni=0: sum=2 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=1: 2 + (-1) =1 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=2: 2 + (-1) + (-1) =0 \u2192 sum up to 2 is zero.\n\ni=3: sum zero.\n\nBut according to the previous conditions, the sum up to i=2 (third element in 0-based, which is a[2]) is zero, which should be invalid. But the sample is valid. So the earlier conditions are not correct.\n\nThis indicates that the cumulative sum up to i can be zero for i <n-1. So what's the correct condition?\n\nPerhaps the condition is that the cumulative sum up to i must be >=0 for all i <n-1, and the sum up to n-1 is zero. Also, a[0] >=0 and a[n-1} <=0 (if n>1).\n\nBut in the sample, the sum up to i=2 is zero, which is allowed, since it's >=0. Oh wait, the earlier proposed condition was that it must be >0. But perhaps it's sufficient for the cumulative sum to be >=0 for i <n-1, and for i =n-1, the sum must be zero.\n\nIn the sample, i=2 is the third element (0-based index 2) in a array of length 4. So i=2 is not the last element (n-1 is 3). So the condition is sum up to i=2 >=0. Which it is (zero >=0). So this would be allowed.\n\nSo the revised conditions are:\n\n1. Sum of all elements is zero.\n\n2. a[0] >=0.\n\n3. For n>1, a[n-1] <=0.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-2, the cumulative sum up to i is >=0.\n\n5. The cumulative sum up to n-1 is zero (which is automatically satisfied by condition 1).\n\nLet's test these conditions against the sample.\n\nSample:\n\nsum is zero: yes.\n\na[0}=2 >=0: yes.\n\nn=4>1. a[3}=0 <=0: yes.\n\nFor i=0: sum=2 >=0.\n\ni=1: sum=1 >=0.\n\ni=2: sum=0 >=0.\n\nAll conditions are met. So it's valid.\n\nAnother example: array [1,-1], sum zero.\n\na[0}=1 >=0.\n\na[1}=-1 <=0 (n>1).\n\nsum up to i=0 is 1 >=0. So conditions are met. Valid.\n\nAnother example: [2,-1,-1,0], as in sample: valid.\n\nAnother example: [1, -2, 1], sum is zero.\n\na[0}=1 >=0.\n\na[2}=1 <=0? No. So condition 3 not met. Invalid.\n\nAnother example: [0,0,0], n=3. sum zero.\n\na[0}=0 >=0.\n\na[2}=0 <=0.\n\nsum up to i=0:0 >=0.\n\nsum up to i=1:0 >=0.\n\nConditions met. Valid.\n\nBut how can this array be achieved? For example, the pointer starts at 0. To create a[0}=0, R_0=0. So no right moves. But the pointer must end at 0. So no moves at all. The array is all zeros. So this is valid.\n\nAnother example: [1, 0, -1]. sum 0.\n\na[0}=1 >=0.\n\na[2}=-1 <=0.\n\nsum up to i=0:1 >=0.\n\nsum up to i=1:1+0=1 >=0.\n\nConditions met. So valid.\n\nYes, the steps could be R from 0 to 1, R from 1 to 2, then L from 2 to 1 (a[2} becomes -1), L from 1 to 0 (a[1} becomes -1), but wait, the array would be [1, -1, -1]. So this example is different.\n\nHmm. But perhaps there's a way to reach [1, 0, -1]. For example:\n\nStart at 0. R to 1 (a[0}=1, pointer at 1).\n\nR to 2 (a[1}=1, pointer at 2).\n\nL to 1 (a[2}=-1, pointer at 1).\n\nR to 2 (a[1}=2, pointer at 2).\n\nL to 1 (a[2}=-2, pointer at 1).\n\nL to 0 (a[1}=1, pointer at 0).\n\nBut this leaves the array as [1,1,-2], sum 0. Hmm.\n\nNot sure. But the conditions are met, so according to the problem's criteria, it should be valid. But perhaps the array is not actually possible. This suggests that the conditions are necessary but not sufficient.\n\nSo what's the correct approach?\n\nThe key is to find all the necessary and sufficient conditions for the array to be valid.\n\nLet's think again about the process. The pointer must start and end at position 0.\n\nEach move to the right from i contributes +1 to a[i], each move to the left from i contributes -1 to a[i].\n\nThe sum of the entire array must be zero.\n\nFor the pointer to end at 0, the number of right moves must equal the number of left moves.\n\nThe first element a[0] must be >=0 (since each R from 0 contributes +1, and L from 0 is impossible. So a[0} = R_0 - L_0 = R_0, since L_0=0. So a[0} must be >=0.\n\nSimilarly, the last element a[n-1} must be <=0 (if n>1). Because R_{n-1}=0 (can't move right from last element), so a[n-1} = R_{n-1} - L_{n-1} = - L_{n-1} <=0.\n\nThe cumulative sum up to each position i (sum_{0..i} a[k}) must be >=0. Because this sum represents the number of times the pointer has crossed to the right of i. If this sum is zero at any point before the last position, it means that the pointer can't proceed further right, but during the process, it must have done so to reach the necessary positions.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. sum(a) ==0.\n\n2. a[0] >=0.\n\n3. For n>1, a[n-1} <=0.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-2, the cumulative sum of a[0..i} >=0.\n\nThese conditions must be met for the array to be possible.\n\nLet's test these conditions against the sample:\n\nSample array [2,-1,-1,0}:\n\nsum 0 \u2192 yes.\n\na[0}=2 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\na[3}=0 <=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nCumulative sums:\n\ni=0 \u21922 >=0.\n\ni=1 \u21921 >=0.\n\ni=2 \u21920 >=0.\n\nAll conditions met \u2192 valid.\n\nAnother example: [1,-1], sum 0. a[0}=1 >=0, a[1}=-1 <=0. cumulative sum up to 0 is 1 >=0 \u2192 valid.\n\nAnother example: [1,0,-1}, sum 0. a[0}=1 >=0. a[2}=-1 <=0. cumulative sums: 1, 1, 0. For i=0: 1 >=0. For i=1:1 >=0. So conditions met \u2192 valid.\n\nBut how to achieve this array?\n\nOne possible path:\n\nR from 0 \u2192 a[0}=1, pointer at 1.\n\nR from 1 \u2192 a[1}=1, pointer at 2.\n\nL from 2 \u2192 a[2}=-1, pointer at 1.\n\nL from 1 \u2192 a[1}=0, pointer at 0.\n\nSo the array is [1,0,-1}, pointer at 0. Yes, valid.\n\nThus, the conditions seem to hold.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Check if sum of a is zero. If not, output No.\n\n- Check if a[0} <0 \u2192 No.\n\n- If n>1 and a[n-1} >0 \u2192 No.\n\n- Compute the cumulative sum up to each i from 0 to n-2. If any of these sums is negative \u2192 No.\n\nOtherwise, output Yes.\n\nNow, let's look at the code provided.\n\nThe code reads t test cases. For each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a array.\n\nThen, in the for loop, the code processes each element, and computes sum, checks validity.\n\nThe variables in the code:\n\nsum is the total sum.\n\nvalid is a boolean.\n\nzeroed is a boolean, but not sure why. The original code's comment has a placeholder.\n\nSo, the code in the for loop needs to:\n\n- Compute the cumulative sum up to each i.\n\n- Check if any of the cumulative sums up to i <n-1 are negative.\n\n- Check if a[0} is negative.\n\n- Check if a[n-1} is positive (for n>1).\n\nAlso, compute the total sum.\n\nSo, the code in the for loop should:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nAdd a[i} to sum.\n\nIf i ==0: check if a[i} <0. If so, valid = false.\n\nIf i ==n-1 and n>1: check if a[i} >0. If so, valid = false.\n\nFor all i <n-1: check cumulative sum up to i >=0. If any of them is <0, valid = false.\n\nSo, the code in the for loop can track the current cumulative sum.\n\nSo, the missing code should:\n\n- Track the cumulative sum up to each i.\n\n- For each i, perform the checks.\n\nHere's the code structure inside the for loop:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i <n; ++i) {\n\n   long current = a[i];\n\n   sum += current;\n\n   if (i ==0) {\n\n       if (current <0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i ==n-1 && n>1) {\n\n       if (current >0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   // cumulative sum up to i\n\n   long cum = ... ?\n\n   if (i <n-1) {\n\n       if (cum <0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut how to track the cumulative sum?\n\nWe can have a variable that tracks the cumulative sum as we process each element.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nInitialize a variable cumSum =0.\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   cumSum += a[i].\n\n   if (i <n-1 && cumSum <0) \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, the code inside the for loop should:\n\n- Check if it's the first element and is negative.\n\n- Check if it's the last element and n>1 and is positive.\n\n- For all i, accumulate cumSum, and if i <n-1 and cumSum <0, mark invalid.\n\nThus, the code inside the for loop should be:\n\nlong cumSum =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   long ai = ... ; // read a[i}\n\n   cumSum += ai;\n\n   if (i ==0) {\n\n       if (ai <0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i ==n-1 && n>1) {\n\n       if (ai >0) valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i <n-1 && cumSum <0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   sum += ai;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the sum is the total sum. The sum is cumSum after processing all elements.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code provided, the sum is being accumulated in a variable called sum. The code also needs to track the cumulative sum.\n\nSo, the code in the for loop should look something like:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    long a_i = ...; // read the current element.\n\n    sum += a_i;\n\n    if (i ==0 && a_i <0) valid = false;\n\n    if (i == n-1 && n >1 && a_i >0) valid = false;\n\n    // accumulate cumulative sum\n\n    if (i < n-1) {\n\n        cumSum += a_i;\n\n        if (cumSum <0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut wait, the cumulative sum for i=0 to i= n-2 is the sum of a[0] to a[i]. Because for i <n-1, the cumulative sum up to i is needed.\n\nWait, for example, for i=0 (n>1), we check cumSum =a[0}. For i=1, cumSum +=a[1}, etc.\n\nYes. So the cumulative sum for each i <n-1 is the sum of a[0} to a[i}.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncumSum starts at 0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   cumSum += a[i}.\n\n   if (i <n-1) {\n\n       check if cumSum <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\n   }\n\nBut then, for i= n-1, cumSum is the sum of all elements, which is checked outside the loop.\n\nBut in the code provided, the sum is accumulated in sum variable. So, the code can use sum to track the cumulative sum. Wait, no. Because sum is the total sum of all elements. For example, in the for loop, after processing i=0, sum is a[0}. For i=1, sum is a[0}+a[1}, etc.\n\nBut for checking the cumulative sum up to i <n-1, we need to check the sum after each step. So:\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   sum += a[i}.\n\n   if (i ==0) check a[i} <0.\n\n   if (i ==n-1 and n>1) check a[i} >0.\n\n   if (i <n-1) check sum >=0.\n\nSo, this way, sum is the cumulative sum up to i. Then, for i <n-1, check if sum >=0.\n\nYes. So the code can be written as:\n\nInside the for loop:\n\nlong ai = ...;\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i ==0) {\n\n    if (ai <0) valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i ==n-1 && n>1) {\n\n    if (ai >0) valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i <n-1) {\n\n    if (sum <0) valid = false;\n\n}\n\nSo the code inside the loop should read the current element (ai), add to sum, and perform the checks.\n\nBut how to read the elements in the code provided?\n\nIn the current code, the for loop is:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nInside this loop, we need to read a_i. But the code uses a StreamTokenizer, and the nextInt() function reads the next token. So for each element in the array, we can read it using nextInt(), but since the elements can be up to 1e9, but nextInt() returns int, which may overflow. Oh, the problem states that a_i can be up to 1e9 in absolute value, but in Java, int is 32 bits, so up to 2e9 is possible. So using nextInt() may overflow. So the code should read a_i as a long.\n\nWait, the current code has nextInt() function which returns an int. But if the input a_i is larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE (or smaller than Integer.MIN_VALUE), this would cause incorrect reading. So the code should use a function that reads a long.\n\nBut in the code provided, the function nextInt() reads a number as a double via st.nval and casts to int. Which can overflow. So this is a problem.\n\nBut given that the code provided uses this, and given that the user is to fill in the missing code, perhaps the problem allows for this, but according to the problem statement, the a_i can be up to 1e9. So using int may overflow. So in the code, the elements should be read as longs.\n\nBut in the provided code, the nextInt() function is used, which returns int. So this may be a problem.\n\nBut the user is to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code should read long values. But the provided code uses nextInt(). So perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user is to fill in the missing code, perhaps the code will be modified to read longs.\n\nBut the original code uses nextInt() for reading the test cases. But in the problem statement, the a_i can be up to 1e9, which is within the range of int (which is up to 2e9). Wait, no. Because 1e9 is 1,000,000,000, which is less than Integer.MAX_VALUE (2,147,483,647). So it's safe to use int.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the input is 1e9, which is 1000000000, which is less than Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). So yes, it's safe.\n\nBut if the input is -1e9, which is -1000000000, which is greater than Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648). So yes.\n\nSo the code can read the a_i as integers.\n\nBut the code may need to process them as longs to avoid overflow when summing.\n\nBut sum is declared as a long in the code. So adding int values to long is okay.\n\nSo, in the code, each a_i is read as an int, but stored in a long variable.\n\nSo, in the for loop, the code can read each a_i as nextInt(), cast to long.\n\nWait, but nextInt() returns an int. So for example:\n\nlong ai = nextInt();\n\nBut if a_i is within the int range, this is okay.\n\nSo, the code inside the for loop can be:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai;\n\nBut wait, the sum is a long. So adding each ai as an int to sum is okay.\n\nSo, the code inside the for loop would:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i <n; ++i) {\n\n   int ai = nextInt();\n\n   sum += ai;\n\n   if (i ==0 && ai <0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i ==n-1 && n>1 && ai >0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i <n-1 && sum <0) {\n\n       valid = false;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut there's also the condition for the last element (ai >0 for n>1).\n\nBut what about when n==1? Then, the last element is a[0}, which must be zero (since sum is zero). But in this case, the code already checks sum ==0. So for n==1, the a[0} must be zero, and the code will have sum ==0 if valid.\n\nBut for n==1, the code's 'sum' is a[0}, and the code checks sum ==0 (in the final if statement).\n\nSo for n==1, the code will correctly check if a[0} is zero.\n\nThus, the code inside the for loop is:\n\nfor each element:\n\n   read ai.\n\n   sum += ai.\n\n   if it's the first element and ai <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\n   if it's the last element, n>1, and ai >0 \u2192 invalid.\n\n   if i <n-1 and sum <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the loop should implement these checks.\n\nThe code in the original problem's loop is:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i <n; ++i) {\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nSo, the code inside should:\n\n- Read ai (using nextInt()).\n\n- Update sum.\n\n- Check the first element.\n\n- Check the last element.\n\n- Check the cumulative sum for i <n-1.\n\nAlso, the code must track the cumulative sum. But since sum is the total sum, which is initially zero and is being added each ai, after each iteration, sum is the cumulative sum up to i.\n\nThus, the code inside the loop is:\n\nint ai = nextInt(); // read the current element.\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0 && ai < 0) {\n\n    valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i == n-1 && n > 1 && ai > 0) {\n\n    valid = false;\n\n}\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) {\n\n    valid = false;\n\n}\n\nSo, that's the code to be filled in.\n\nBut in Java, we have to read the ai correctly. However, the code uses the StreamTokenizer, which is configured to read tokens. So, in the code, nextInt() reads the next token as an integer.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0 && ai < 0) valid = false;\n\nif (i == n-1 && n > 1 && ai > 0) valid = false;\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) valid = false;\n\nBut note that once valid is set to false, it remains false even if other conditions are met. So in the code, once any of the conditions fails, valid becomes false and stays that way.\n\nThus, the code inside the loop is:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0) {\n\n    if (ai < 0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i == n-1) {\n\n    if (n > 1 && ai > 0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i < n-1) {\n\n    if (sum < 0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, this is the code that should be filled in.\n\nNow, let's test this code against the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=4, a=[2,-1,-1,0].\n\nLoop steps:\n\ni=0:\n\nai=2. sum=2.\n\ni==0: 2 >=0 \u2192 valid remains true.\n\ni <3 (n-1 is 3). sum=2 >=0 \u2192 valid.\n\ni=1:\n\nai=-1. sum=2-1=1.\n\ni <3: sum=1 >=0 \u2192 valid.\n\ni=2:\n\nai=-1. sum=1-1=0.\n\ni <3: sum=0 >=0 \u2192 valid.\n\ni=3:\n\nai=0. sum=0.\n\ni ==3 and n>1 \u2192 ai=0 <=0 \u2192 valid remains true.\n\nThus, all conditions are met. valid is true. sum is 0 \u2192 output Yes.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1. a[0}=0.\n\ni=0:\n\nai=0. sum=0.\n\ni==0: 0 >=0 \u2192 valid.\n\ni is not <0 (since n=1, i=0 is not <0 \u2192 no check.\n\nsum ==0 \u2192 output Yes.\n\nAnother example: n=2, a=[1,-1].\n\ni=0:\n\nai=1. sum=1.\n\ni==0: ok.\n\ni <1 (since n-1=1, i=0 <1 \u2192 sum >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ni=1:\n\nai=-1. sum=0.\n\ni==1 and n>1: ai=-1 <=0 \u2192 ok.\n\nThus, valid. sum=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother example: [0,0,0], n=3.\n\nsum=0.\n\ni=0: ai=0 >=0 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=0: sum 0 >=0 \u2192 but sum <0 is false. So valid.\n\ni=1: sum 0 >=0 \u2192 valid.\n\ni=2: ai=0 <=0 \u2192 ok.\n\nThus, yes.\n\nAnother example: [1, 0, -1], sum=0.\n\ni=0: ai=1 \u22650 \u2192 ok. sum=1 \u22650 (i <2).\n\ni=1: ai=0. sum=1+0=1 >=0 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=2: ai=-1 \u22640 \u2192 ok.\n\nsum is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, code should output yes.\n\nThus, the code inside the for loop should be:\n\nint ai = nextInt();\n\nsum += ai;\n\nif (i == 0) {\n\n    if (ai <0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i == n-1) {\n\n    if (n >1 && ai >0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (i < n-1) {\n\n    if (sum <0) {\n\n        valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, this is the missing code."
