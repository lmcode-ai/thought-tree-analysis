    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let me see what needs to be done here. The user provided two classes for positional embeddings in a model, and there's a missing line in the Wav2Vec2ConformerRotaryPositionalEmbedding class. The task is to fill in the 'embeddings = # TODO: Your code here' part.\n\nLooking at the RotaryPositionalEmbedding class, the code so far calculates 'freqs' using an einsum between time_stamps and inv_freq. The 'freqs' is a matrix where each row corresponds to a time step and each column is a frequency component. The next step is to compute the embeddings, which I believe should be the sine and cosine of these frequencies. \n\nWait, the comments mention calculating cosine and sine embeddings from embeddings. The line after the TODO has cos_embeddings = embeddings.cos()... So the embeddings variable must be the frequency values. But in the code, 'freqs' is already computed. So maybe the embeddings variable is just 'freqs'? Because then taking cos and sin of that would make sense. \n\nWait, the code after the TODO is:\n\nfreqs = torch.einsum(...)\nembeddings = # TODO\ncos_embeddings = embeddings.cos()\n\nSo, perhaps the 'embeddings' here should be 'freqs'? Because then the next lines compute cosine and sine from it. So the missing line is embeddings = freqs. That seems straightforward. But maybe I need to check the dimensions. Let me think: 'time_stamps' is a 1D tensor of length sequence_length. inv_freq is a 1D tensor of length dim/2 (since step is 2). The einsum \"i,j->ij\" would make freqs a matrix of size (sequence_length, dim/2). But the rotary embeddings usually have sin and cos for each dimension. Wait, maybe the step here is because they are interleaving sin and cos for even and odd dimensions?\n\nHmm, the dim here is the hidden size per head. Since in rotary embeddings, for each position, you have a rotation matrix that's applied to the query and keys. The frequencies are set up such that for each pair of dimensions (2i, 2i+1), they share the same frequency. So the inv_freq is computed for every step 2. So the freqs would have for each position, dim/2 elements. Then when you compute cos and sin for those elements, each of those elements corresponds to a pair of dimensions. \n\nTherefore, the embeddings variable should just be the freqs. So the code after the TODO line should be embeddings = freqs. That's all. \n\nWait, maybe the code is written as:\n\nfreqs = torch.einsum(\"i,j->ij\", time_stamps, self.inv_freq)\nembeddings = freqs\n\nThen, when taking cos and sin, each element in embeddings is the frequency component for that dimension. \n\nYes, that makes sense. The problem is just that the line was missing, so the code needs to assign freqs to embeddings. \n\nSo the missing code is embeddings = freqs. \n\nI think that's it. Let me check again. The code after the TODO is supposed to compute embeddings, which are then used for cos and sin. Since freqs is exactly the value needed, the line is straightforward."
