The user wants me to fill in the TODO part which is in the Boost.Asio section. \n\nThe comment says that part is supposed to set up a resolver to translate a server name and service into an endpoint. Let's see what's already there. They have the resolver created, and a query with \"time.nist.gov\" and \"daytime\". So the next steps would involve using the resolver to find endpoints and then connecting with a socket.\n\nFirst, the resolver's resolve function is needed. So maybe they need to call resolver.resolve(query) to get the list of endpoints. Then, create a tcp::socket and connect it to one of the endpoints. \n\nWait, the code after the TODO should set up the resolver's part. Let me think step by step.\n\nAfter creating the resolver and the query, the next line should be resolving the query. So something like:\n\nauto endpoints = resolver.resolve(query);\n\nBut maybe they need to handle errors here? But the problem might just want the basic code. Then, create a socket, and connect. \n\nSo:\n\nboost::asio::ip::tcp::socket socket(io_service);\nboost::asio::connect(socket, endpoints);\n\nThat would connect the socket to one of the endpoints from the resolver. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code should be those lines. Let me check if the variables are properly declared. The resolver is already there, the query too. So the code between the TODO comment would be:\n\nauto endpoints = resolver.resolve(query);\nboost::asio::ip::tcp::socket socket(io_service);\nboost::asio::connect(socket, endpoints);\n\nHmm, but maybe the order? Let me think: create the socket first, then resolve, then connect. Wait, the resolver is already set up, so yes. So first resolve gives the endpoints, then create the socket, then connect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the socket is declared before resolve? No, that's not needed. The code as I wrote should work.\n\nSo the missing lines are those three lines. Let me make sure there's no other missing parts. The TODO comment is right after the query, so those lines need to come there. \n\nYes, that should do it. The user just needs to add those lines to set up the connection using Boost.Asio."
