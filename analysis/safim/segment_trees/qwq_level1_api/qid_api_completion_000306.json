The comment mentions using padding and truncation. So, I remember that the tokenizer for these models (like Bert, Electra, DistilBert) can handle pairs of sentences. \n\nThe inputs should be created using the tokenizer's __call__ method with the premise and hypothesis as the pair. The parameters should include padding='max_length' or padding=True, and truncation=True, and also return_tensors set to 'pt' for PyTorch tensors. \n\nWait, the exact parameters might be: when tokenizing pairs, you pass the first text as 'text', the second as 'text_pair'? Or maybe using the 'text' and 'text_pair' arguments. Let me think. For example, the BertTokenizer's method is called like tokenizer(premise, hypothesis, ...), which automatically handles the pair. \n\nSo the code should be something like:\n\ninputs = tokenizer(premise, hypothesis, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\nBut wait, maybe they need to specify max_length? The problem doesn't mention that, so probably just padding and truncation with default values are okay. The user's comment says to use padding and truncation, so the parameters should include those. \n\nTherefore, the line would be:\n\ninputs = tokenizer(premise, hypothesis, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\nYes, that's right. The return_tensors is needed to get tensors. So that's the line that fills the TODO in prepare_input.\n\nNow, check if there's any other missing parts. The rest of the code seems okay. The main function calls everything correctly, and the evaluate_mnli function uses the tokenized inputs properly. The load_model_and_tokenizer sets the num_labels to 3, which matches MNLI's three classes. \n\nSo the only missing code is in prepare_input, replacing the TODO line with that tokenizer call. The function then returns inputs, which is a dict of tensors. That should work because when passed to the model, the **tokenized_input unpacks the dict into the model's parameters correctly."
