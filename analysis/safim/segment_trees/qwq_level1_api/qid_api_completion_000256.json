Looking at the code for pe_positive: \n\npe_positive[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)\npe_positive[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)\n\nWait, 0::2 means every even index (starting at 0), so that's for the even indices (columns 0,2,4 etc.), assigned sin, and 1::2 is odd indices (1,3,5 etc.) assigned cos. That's correct. Similarly for pe_negative, the code computes:\n\npe_negative[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(-1 * position * div_term)\npe_negative[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(-1 * position * div_term)\n\nWait but sin is odd function, so sin(-x) = -sin(x), but in the code, the negative position is handled by flipping for positive, but maybe that's okay. Let me see. Wait the problem here in the code is that pe_negative is computed for -1 * position.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to complete the given Python code for the Wav2Vec2ConformerRotaryPositionalEmbedding and Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding classes. Let me look at the first one first.\n\nStarting with the Rotary Positional Embedding class. The __init__ method has a line where inv_freq is calculated. The comment says to calculate the inverse frequency for rotary embeddings, and the formula is 1.0 divided by (base raised to some exponent over dim). The exponent part is missing here. The base is config.rotary_embedding_base, and the code has step = 2. Wait, in rotary embeddings, the exponent usually is (i / 2) / dim, where i is the position. Wait, maybe the exponent is (torch.arange(dim) // 2) / dim? Let me think. The standard rotary embedding formula uses for position x and angle theta_i = 10000^(2i/d), but here the base might be a different value. The formula in the code's inv_freq line is base ** ( (something) / dim ). \n\nWait, in the code's inv_freq line, the placeholder is in the exponent. The code says base ** ( # TODO: Your code here / dim ). The missing part is probably torch.arange(dim // 2), because for each dimension up to half the hidden size (since dim is hidden_size divided by num_heads), we compute theta_i. Since the step is 2, maybe the exponent is (torch.arange(0, dim, step=2) / 2). Wait let me recall the formula: For rotary embeddings, the frequency is base^(2i/d), where i is the position in the dimension. Wait maybe I should look up the standard rotary embedding code.\n\nAlternatively, the Rotary Positional Embedding typically uses inv_freq as 1/(base^(2i/d)), where i is the index. So for each dimension up to dim//2, so the code should generate a tensor of exponents for each dimension. The inv_freq is per dimension. For example, in the original code for rotary embeddings, inv_freq is computed as 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2, dtype=torch.float32) / dim)). So here, the exponent is (torch.arange(0, dim, step=2) / dim). \n\nWait, in the code's case, the dim is config.hidden_size divided by num_attention_heads. Since the inv_freq is for each head's dimension, which is dim. So the missing code should be torch.arange(0, dim, step=2). Let me check the line again. The inv_freq is calculated as 1.0 divided by (base raised to (something divided by dim). So the exponent here is (something / dim). The something should be torch.arange(0, dim//2)*2. Because for each pair of dimensions, the exponent is (2i)/dim. Wait, maybe the correct exponent is (torch.arange(0, dim, 2) / dim). So the code should be:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim))\n\nWait the step here is 2 because each pair of sine/cosine terms for even indices. So the correct line for the exponent part is:\n\nbase ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim)\n\nHence, the missing code in that line is torch.arange(0, dim, step=2).float(). So the code inside the exponent's numerator is torch.arange(0, dim, 2). Since the variable dim is already defined as config.hidden_size // config.num_attention_heads. So putting it all together, the line should be:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim))\n\nWait, but the step here is 2, as step was set to 2 earlier. Oh right, the step was set to 2 in the code with \"step = 2\", but the step variable isn't used. Hmm, maybe that's a leftover from the code. The step variable might be a mistake, or maybe part of the problem. Wait, in the code provided, the line is:\n\nstep = 2\n\nBut then that variable isn't used. So maybe that's a mistake, but since the user hasn't mentioned it, perhaps we can ignore that and proceed. The step variable is not needed here. So the missing code is torch.arange(0, dim, step=2), but since in the code's line, the exponent is ( ... / dim ), the code should be torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() divided by dim. \n\nSo the missing part in the exponent is torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float()\n\nTherefore, the line should be filled as:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim))\n\nSo that's the first missing part. \n\nNext, looking at the Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding class. Let me check the extend_pe method. \n\nIn the code provided, there's a part where the pe_positive and pe_negative are calculated. The position variable is created as torch.arange(0, x.size(1)).unsqueeze(1). \n\nThen, the div_term_exp is set to -(math.log(10000.0) / self.d_model). \n\ndiv_term = torch.exp( torch.arange(0, self.d_model, 2, dtype=torch.float32) * div_term_exp )\n\nWait, that's correct for the standard positional encoding. Then, the pe_positive is filled with sin and cos for the even and odd indices respectively. Wait, for the standard PE, position * div_term, then even indices are sin, odd are cos. Wait no, the standard is:\n\nFor even dimensions (i even), PE(pos, i) = sin(pos/10000^(i/d_model)), but actually, the exponents are i/2 divided by the d_model over 2. Wait let me recall. The standard formula is:\n\nPE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/(10000^(2i/d_model)))\n\nPE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/(10000^(2i/d_model)))\n\nHence, the code here uses position * div_term. The position is multiplied by div_term which is exp( (2i/d_model) * (-log(10000)) ), which equals 1/(10000^(2i/d_model)). So position * div_term is the argument inside sin and cos. \n\nLooking at the code for pe_positive: \n\npe_positive[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)\npe_positive[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)\n\nWait, 0::2 means every even index (starting at 0), so that's for the even indices (columns 0,2,4 etc.), assigned sin, and 1::2 is odd indices (1,3,5 etc.) assigned cos. That's correct. \n\nSimilarly for pe_negative, the code computes:\n\npe_negative[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(-1 * position * div_term)\npe_negative[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(-1 * position * div_term)\n\nWait but sin is odd function, so sin(-x) = -sin(x), but in the code, the negative position is handled by flipping for positive, but maybe that's okay. Let me see. \n\nWait the problem here in the code is that pe_negative is computed for -1 * position. However, the code's current implementation for pe_negative might have a mistake. Let's check the code's current lines for pe_negative:\n\npe_negative[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(-1 * position * div_term)\npe_negative[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(-1 * position * div_term)\n\nWait, but for position being the same as the positive positions (since it's defined as torch.arange(0, x.size(1)), the negative positions would be -1, -2 etc. So for position i (starting from 0?), the negative position would be -i. \n\nWait perhaps the code has an error here. Let me think: position is the array [0,1,2,..., T-1], where T is x.size(1). So the pe_negative is supposed to represent the negative positions (like -1, -2, ...). So for the negative position at index k (starting from 0?), it's actually the negative of (k+1) ? \n\nWait in the code, pe_negative is initialized as zeros of size (T, d_model). The position variable is from 0 to T-1. \n\nWait when computing pe_negative, the code is using -1 * position * div_term. So for position 0, it's 0, so sin(0) is 0, cos is 1, etc. \n\nBut then when they flip pe_positive, maybe that's part of handling the relative positions. The code then constructs pe_positive as torch.flip(pe_positive, [0]).unsqueeze(0). So flipping over the first dimension (the time dimension) would reverse the order, so that pe_positive is now from position T-1 down to 0. Then, when concatenated with pe_negative (which starts from position 0?), perhaps that creates a combined array that can be used for relative positions. \n\nLooking further down, when extending the pe, the code checks if the current pe is sufficient. \n\nWait the problem here is in the code's current lines for pe_negative's sine and cosine. The code uses -position * div_term. However, for the negative positional encoding, the sine terms should be sin(-position * div_term), which is -sin(position * div_term). The cosine of -x is the same as cosine x, so cos(-x) = cos(x). Therefore, the code for pe_negative's sine can be written as torch.sin(-position * div_term), which would be -sin(pos*div_term), and cosine is cos(pos*div_term). \n\nBut the code as written for pe_negative's sine is using -position * div_term, which is correct. But when flipped, perhaps it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pe_negative is computed for negative positions. For example, the negative positional encoding at position -k would have PE(-k, i) = sin(-k / ...) or whatever. \n\nWait the code may be correct here. Let me move on. \n\nAnother possible issue is that in the extend_pe function, after creating pe_positive and pe_negative, they are concatenated. The code says:\n\npe_positive is flipped along the 0 dimension (time), so it becomes from T-1 down to 0. \n\npe_positive is unsqueezed to (1, T, d_model). \n\npe_negative is pe_negative[1:].unsqueeze(0). \n\nWait why the [1:]? Because the first element (position 0) of pe_negative would be for -0, which is same as 0. But since the positive part already includes 0, perhaps the negative part starts from -1. So by taking [1:], they exclude the first element (position 0 in the pe_negative array, which corresponds to -0?), so that when combined with the flipped positive, which includes the 0 position at the end, the concatenated array can cover from -T+1 to T-1 or something. \n\nThe final pe is the concatenation of pe_positive (flipped) and pe_negative (without first element). \n\nWait the code's line is:\n\npe_positive = torch.flip(pe_positive, [0]).unsqueeze(0)\npe_negative = pe_negative[1:].unsqueeze(0)\npe = torch.cat([pe_positive, pe_negative], dim=1)\n\nSo the pe_positive is size (1, T, d_model) after flipping (originally T entries from T-1 down to 0). The pe_negative is (1, T-1, d_model). So the total is 2T-1. \n\nWhich matches pe_length_required = x.size(1)*2 -1.\n\nThis seems correct. \n\nLooking at the forward function: when extracting the relative embeddings, the mid_index is pe.size(1)//2, which is (2T-1)/2 rounded down. So for example, if T is the current x's size(1), then the mid is at the position of the original T-1 (from the flipped positive part). The start_idx is mid_index - T +1 and end_idx is mid_index+T. Wait let's see: \n\nSuppose x.size(1) is T. The pe is of length 2*T-1. The mid is (2T-1)//2. Let's say T is 5, then pe is 9 elements. (2*5-1=9). mid_index is 4. start_idx is 4 -5 +1 =0, end_idx is 4+5=9. So it takes the whole array. But perhaps when the current T is smaller than the previous, the PE is extended. \n\nThis part seems okay. \n\nNow, are there any missing parts in the code? \n\nLooking at Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding's __init__: \n\nThe pe is initialized to None, then in extend_pe, it's set. \n\nWait in the __init__ method, there's a line:\n\ninit_tensor = torch.tensor(0.0).expand(1, self.max_len)\n\nWait the expand here might have an issue. Because expand(1, self.max_len) would create a tensor of [1, max_len], which is correct as initial tensor, but perhaps that's just a dummy tensor to trigger the extend_pe function. \n\nThe code in __init__ calls self.extend_pe(init_tensor). But when the model is initialized, this would run, which would create the pe up to max_len. Wait but according to the code in extend_pe, when self.pe is None, it creates a new pe based on the input's size (x.size(1)), but here the input is a tensor of size (1, self.max_len). So when the model is initialized, self.max_len is config.max_source_positions, so the initial call to extend_pe would set pe with pe_length_required = (self.max_len)*2 -1. \n\nWait that's correct? Because when the first call to extend_pe is made with an init_tensor of size (1, self.max_len), then the code would compute pe_positive and pe_negative for that max_len. \n\nHmm, not sure if there's an error here, but perhaps the code is okay. \n\nNow, looking back at the problem statement. The user mentioned that there are missing lines or blocks to fill in. The problem is to output the missing code only. \n\nLooking again at the Rotary Positional Embedding class, the missing code is the exponent part in inv_freq. The line is:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** ( # TODO: Your code here / dim))\n\nThe part before / dim is torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float(). \n\nSo the missing code is torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() \n\nHence, the missing line in that part is:\n\nbase ** ( torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim )\n\nSo putting it all together, the corrected line is:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim))\n\nSo that's the first missing part.\n\nNow, looking at the other class, are there any missing parts?\n\nLooking at the Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding's extend_pe method, perhaps there's an error in the creation of pe_positive and pe_negative. Wait, the code for pe_negative's position is using the same position as the positive's. \n\nWait, the code for pe_negative is set to:\n\npe_negative = torch.zeros(x.size(1), self.d_model)\n\nposition = torch.arange(0, x.size(1), dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(1)\n\nSo position is 0-based. For negative positions, perhaps we should use -position[1:]. Let me see. Because when creating the negative positional embeddings, for the elements beyond the 0 position in the pe_negative array, they correspond to the negative positions. \n\nWait the code computes pe_negative for positions 0 to T-1 (where T is x.size(1)), but then when using -1 * position, that's correct for the values, but when the pe_negative is concatenated after flipping the pe_positive, perhaps it's necessary to have the pe_negative for positions -1, -2 etc. \n\nWait the code for pe_negative is using position as the same as the forward positions, but with the negative sign in the argument. That should be okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no missing code in the relative positional embedding part. The user might have only missed the part in the Rotary's inv_freq calculation. \n\nWait the problem says \"you will be given code with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" The user's given code has a TODO in the Rotary class's __init__ method. The other class might be correct as given. \n\nSo the only missing code is the line in Rotary's inv_freq calculation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the line to fill in the exponent part:\n\ntorch.arange(0, dim, 2).float()\n\nSo putting it into the equation, the inv_freq line becomes:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim))\n\nThus, the missing code is the part inside the exponent's numerator: torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float()\n\nHence, the code to output is just that part. \n\nWait the problem says to output only the missing code so that the program runs correctly. The user's instruction says to output the missing code as plain text, not in code blocks. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the exponent, so the code to replace the #TODO is torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() \n\nSo the answer should be that line."
