    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided a Python code with some missing parts, and I have to fill in the blanks. The task is to complete the code so that it runs correctly. The code is about using a DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis. \n\nFirst, looking at the function load_model_and_tokenizer. The problem says to load the tokenizer and the model. The model is already being loaded with from_pretrained using model_name, which is set to \"distilbert-base-uncased\". So the tokenizer needs to be loaded similarly. The line where the tokenizer is assigned has a TODO. The correct way would be to use the DistilBertTokenizer's from_pretrained method as well. So the line should be something like:\n\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name)\n\nBecause the tokenizer_name is set to the same as the model name here. That makes sense since they are both using \"distilbert-base-uncased\".\n\nNext, checking the prepare_input function. The function's docstring says it tokenizes the input text. The code already calls the tokenizer with return_tensors=\"pt\", padding, truncation, and returns the inputs. Wait, the function returns the inputs, which is a dictionary containing the input IDs, attention mask, etc. But the parameters mention that it returns a torch.Tensor. Wait, actually, the return of the tokenizer in this case is a BatchEncoding object, which is a dict-like structure with tensors if return_tensors is \"pt\". So the return is correct. So maybe that part is okay. The user didn't mark anything here as missing, so perhaps that's already filled.\n\nThen the predict_sentiment function. The model is used with **tokenized_input which unpacks the dictionary. The outputs.logits are used, and the argmax is taken. The comment says 0 is negative, 1 is positive. So the code returns \"positive\" if prediction is 1 else \"negative\". That looks correct.\n\nThe main function seems to put it all together. So the only missing part is the tokenizer initialization in load_model_and_tokenizer.\n\nWait, let me check again. The load_model_and_tokenizer function has model_name and tokenizer_name both set to \"distilbert-base-uncased\". The model is loaded via:\n\nmodel = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nSo the tokenizer line should be similar. So the line where tokenizer is assigned is missing. The current line is:\n\ntokenizer = # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the correct code here is to call the tokenizer's from_pretrained method with tokenizer_name. So the line would be:\n\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name)\n\nYes, that's the missing part. Are there any other missing parts? Let me check the other functions again.\n\nIn the prepare_input function, the inputs are correctly generated, so that's okay. The predict_sentiment function uses the model correctly. The main function is just calling everything. So the only missing code is the tokenizer initialization line.\n\nSo the answer should be just that line. The user asks to output only the missing code, as plain text, not in a code block. So the code to fill the TODO is the assignment to tokenizer using the from_pretrained method."
