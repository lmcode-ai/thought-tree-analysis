The line with the TODO is where I need to fill in the correct code.\n\nThe comment says to initialize Layer Normalization. The standard practice is to use nn.LayerNorm here. The parameters for LayerNorm include the normalized shape. Since this is typical for transformers, the dimension should match the config.dim, which is the embedding dimension. \n\nLooking at the code, the config.dim is the size of the embeddings, so the LayerNorm should be applied over the last dimension. Therefore, the LayerNorm instance should be initialized with nn.LayerNorm(config.dim, eps=layer_norm_eps). The layer_norm_eps is given as 1e-12, so that's already set.\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nself.LayerNorm = nn.LayerNorm(config.dim, eps=layer_norm_eps)\n\nThat's the only missing part here. Let me check if there are any other parts needed. The rest of the code seems to be in place. The forward method combines the embeddings correctly, applies the layer norm and dropout. \n\nWait, also, in PyTorch, the LayerNorm is usually applied after the sum of embeddings and position embeddings, which is what's happening here. So the initialization line is the key part here. The TODO is right there. \n\nI think that's all. So the missing code is just assigning the LayerNorm instance to self.LayerNorm with the correct parameters."
