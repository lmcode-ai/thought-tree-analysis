    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a Python code with some missing parts that need to be filled in. The task is to complete the code so that it runs correctly. The main function here is predict_sentiment, where there's a TODO comment. Let me look at that part closely.\n\nThe function predict_sentiment takes the model and tokenized_input. The model is a DistilBertForSequenceClassification instance. When we call model(**tokenized_input), the outputs should contain the logits or the predicted probabilities. \n\nIn the code, after getting the outputs, the comment says \"Get the prediction (0: negative, 1: positive)\". The current line has prediction = # TODO: Your code here.item().\n\nHmm, so the outputs from the model probably have a logits attribute. The logits are the raw scores for each class. To get the predicted class, we need to take the argmax of the logits along the class dimension. Since it's a binary classification (positive or negative), the class with the highest logit is the prediction.\n\nSo, the correct line should be something like:\n\nprediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits).item()\n\nWait, let me make sure. The outputs from the model's forward pass would have logits. So, outputs.logits gives a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_labels). Since we're using a single example (batch_size 1), the argmax would pick the index of the highest value. Then .item() converts it to a Python integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outputs have a different structure. But according to the Hugging Face documentation for DistilBertForSequenceClassification, the outputs.logits is indeed the correct attribute. \n\nSo the missing code is prediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits).item()\n\nLet me check the existing code again. The TODO line is written as:\n\nprediction = # TODO: Your code here.item()\n\nSo the user probably needs to replace the TODO with the correct expression. The .item() is already there, but maybe that's a mistake. Wait, no. The code as written has the TODO comment where the expression should be. So the line should be:\n\nprediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits).item()\n\nThat's the correct way to get the class with the highest logit and convert it to a Python integer. Then the return statement uses that prediction to decide between 'positive' or 'negative'.\n\nI think that's the only missing part. The rest of the code seems okay. The load_model_and_tokenizer function loads the model and tokenizer correctly. The prepare_input function uses the tokenizer with padding and truncation, returning PyTorch tensors. The main function puts it all together.\n\nSo the only code needed here is the line for prediction in the predict_sentiment function."
