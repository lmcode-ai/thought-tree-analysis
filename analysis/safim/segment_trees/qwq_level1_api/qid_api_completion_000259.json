    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what code to fill in for the missing parts. Let's start with the first class, Wav2Vec2ConformerRotaryPositionalEmbedding. The problem is in the forward method where it says \"freqs = # TODO: Your code here\".\n\nLooking at the comments, they mention using einsum. The inv_freq is a buffer that's calculated earlier. The time_stamps are generated as a tensor from 0 to sequence_length-1, same as the length of the input. \n\nRotary embeddings involve computing sine and cosine for each position and each dimension. The standard approach uses a matrix multiplication or einsum to compute the outer product of time steps and inv_freq. \n\nThe inv_freq is 1/(base^(2i/dim)), where i is the step. So for each position (time_stamp) and each dimension (inv_freq's elements), we compute time_stamp * inv_freq. That gives a matrix where each row is for a position and each column is for a dimension. \n\nSo using einsum, how do I do that? The time_stamps is a 1D tensor of shape (seq_len), inv_freq is 1D of shape (dim/2), since step is 2. \n\nThe einsum would be between time_stamps and inv_freq. The desired output freqs should be of shape (seq_len, dim/2), so each position has dim/2 elements. \n\nThe einsum equation would be \"i,j->ij\" where i is the time dimension and j is the inv_freq dimension. So \"t,d -> td\" where t is time_stamps and d is inv_freq. \n\nYes, so freqs = torch.einsum(\"i,j->ij\", time_stamps, self.inv_freq). \n\nWait, checking the variables: time_stamps is of shape (sequence_length), and inv_freq is (dim_step). Since step was 2, the inv_freq's length is dim//2. Because dim is hidden_size//num_heads, and step=2 so for even dimensions. \n\nWait, the code in __init__ has step=2, so the arange is from 0 to dim with step 2. So the length of inv_freq is (dim//2). \n\nSo the einsum would result in sequence_length x (dim//2). Then embeddings are concatenated with themselves to get to dim, so that makes sense. The embeddings variable would then be (seq_len, dim), which when cos and sin gives the required dimensions. \n\nSo that's the missing line. \n\nNow the other class, Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding. The code seems mostly done. Let me check the extend_pe function. \n\nIn the code, after calculating pe_positive and pe_negative, they are flipped and concatenated. Wait, the code says pe_positive = torch.flip(pe_positive, [0]).unsqueeze(0). That's because for relative positions, the positive and negative need to be arranged such that the middle is the current position. \n\nWait, the current code in extend_pe: \n\nWhen creating pe_positive, position is from 0 to x.size(1)-1. The pe_positive is computed for positions 0,1,... but then flipped so that the first element is the last position. Then when concatenated with pe_negative (which is from 1 onwards), the combined tensor's middle is at position x.size(1)-1. \n\nWait, maybe I need to confirm the exact steps. The code's logic is to create a combined positional encoding where the middle is 0, and the left side is negative positions, right is positive. \n\nThe code first computes pe_positive as the standard PE for positions 0,1,..,n-1. Then flips it so that the first element corresponds to position n-1, then the next to n-2 etc. \n\npe_negative is computed for positions 1 to n (since position starts at 0, but pe_negative is for negative positions except zero?), then sliced from 1: so pe_negative is 1 to n-1? \n\nWait, the code for pe_negative: \n\npe_negative is initialized as zeros(x.size(1), d_model). Then position is same as pe_positive's. Then when computing pe_negative, it uses -1*position. So for position 0, it's 0, but then when we take pe_negative[1:], that removes the first element (position 0). \n\nSo the pe_positive after flip is [position n-1, n-2,...0], and pe_negative is [positions 1, 2,...n-1] (since we started at 0, so after slicing 1: gives positions 1 to x.size(1)-1). \n\nSo when concatenated, the combined pe is [pe_positive_flipped (size n), pe_negative (size n-1)], leading to total 2n-1 elements. The middle is at index n-1. \n\nSo when in forward, the start and end indices are set to mid_index - hidden_states.size(1) +1 to mid_index + ..., which should extract the right window. \n\nLooking at the code, the existing code seems okay, but maybe check if there are any errors. \n\nWait in the extend_pe function, when pe_positive is created, the code uses pe_positive[:, 0::2] and 1::2. That's for even and odd indices. \n\nBut the code creates pe_positive as zeros, then fills even and odd indices with sin and cos. \n\nYes, that's standard sinusoidal PE. \n\nSo the code for the relative positional embedding seems correct, so there are no missing parts there. \n\nThe only missing code is in the Rotary case, the freqs line. So the answer is to set freqs using einsum between time_stamps and inv_freq. \n\nSo the line is: \n\nfreqs = torch.einsum(\"i,j->ij\", time_stamps, self.inv_freq)\n\nWait, but time_stamps is a tensor of shape (sequence_length), and self.inv_freq is (dim/2). So the einsum will produce (sequence_length, dim/2). Then when concatenated with itself, it becomes (sequence_length, dim). \n\nYes, because torch.cat((freqs, freqs), dim=-1) would double the last dimension, so that matches the dim which is the original hidden_size divided by number of heads. \n\nSo that's the correct line. \n\nTherefore, the only code needed is that line for freqs."
