    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to complete the Python code provided. Let's look at the code step by step to find where the missing parts are.\n\nFirst, the code defines three functions: load_model_and_tokenizer, prepare_input, and evaluate_mnli, plus a main function. The problem says to fill in the missing lines or blocks.\n\nLooking at the evaluate_mnli function. The comment says to use the model to evaluate MNLI. The code has a with statement that's incomplete. The line starts with \"with # TODO: Your code here:\" So I need to figure out what goes there.\n\nIn PyTorch, when evaluating models, it's common to use torch.no_grad() to disable gradient calculation, which saves memory and speed. So the with block should be a context manager for no_grad. So the line should be:\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n\nThat's probably the missing part here. Let me check. The function then calls model(**tokenized_input). Since during evaluation, we don't need gradients, using no_grad makes sense.\n\nSo the corrected code for evaluate_mnli would have that with statement. Are there any other missing parts?\n\nLet me check the other functions. The load_model_and_tokenizer function seems complete. The prepare_input function is returning the result of encode_plus, which is correct. The main function and the rest look okay.\n\nThe only missing part is indeed the with block in evaluate_mnli. So the answer should be filling that line with torch.no_grad().\n\nWait, maybe there's another part? Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe user said to output only the missing code. The code given has a TODO in evaluate_mnli's with statement, so that's the only missing part. The rest of the code is already filled. So the answer is just the line inside the with statement.\n\nYes. So the missing code is \"torch.no_grad():\" inside the with statement. So the line becomes:\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**tokenized_input)\n\nTherefore, the code to output is just the line with the with statement filled."
