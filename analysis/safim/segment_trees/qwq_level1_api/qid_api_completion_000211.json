    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let me look at the code the user provided. They want me to complete the missing part, which is the plotting of the word embeddings using PCA. The TODO is right before the plotting section.\n\nSo, the code already has the PCA transformed vectors. The next step is to create a scatter plot. The user's code already has plt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:,0], transformed_vectors[:,1]). Then, they loop through the vocab to annotate each point with the word. But maybe they need to make sure the plot displays correctly.\n\nWait, the existing code after the TODO does include the scatter plot and annotations. But the user might have missed some parts. Let me check again. The code provided by the user includes the scatter, the annotate loop, the title, and the show(). Hmm, maybe the user's code had the TODO there but actually those lines are already present. Wait, maybe I need to check if the code as given has the correct parts.\n\nWait the user says to output the missing code. Let me see the code again. The user's code after the TODO shows that they have written the plt.scatter and the loop for annotations. But perhaps the user's actual code had the TODO where those lines were missing. Wait, looking at the code provided by the user in the problem:\n\nLooking at the code block:\n\n# Plotting word embeddings\n# TODO: Your code here\nplt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1])\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title('Word Embeddings Visualized with PCA')\nplt.show()\n\nWait, in the user's code, the lines after the TODO are already present. That suggests maybe the user's code had the TODO where those lines were missing, so the correct answer is those lines. But the user instruction says \"output only the missing code\". So the missing code would be the lines after the TODO. But since in the user's provided code, those lines are already there, perhaps there was a mistake, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's code actually has the TODO, and those lines are missing, so the assistant needs to fill in those lines. So the TODO is a placeholder where the user hasn't written the code yet.\n\nIn that case, the correct code to fill in would be the lines:\n\nplt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1])\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title('Word Embeddings Visualized with PCA')\nplt.show()\n\nTherefore, the missing code is those four lines. The user might have mistakenly included them in their code, but according to their instruction, those are the missing parts that need to be filled. Since the problem says to output only the missing code, that's what we need to provide."
