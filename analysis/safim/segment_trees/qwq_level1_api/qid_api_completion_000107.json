The user provided Java code for a MetricsCalculator class, and there's a missing part in the Metrics constructor call, specifically for the 99.99th percentile of latencies.

The last missing part is the 99.99th percentile for latencies. The previous lines for service times and latencies up to 99.9 are all using StatUtils.percentile with the appropriate percentile value and then dividing by the nanos to millis conversion. \n\nSo, the pattern is for each percentile, they call StatUtils.percentile on the latencies array with the desired percentile (like 99.99 here), then divide by TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(1L) to convert nanoseconds to milliseconds. \n\nThe line before the TODO is the 99.9th percentile for latencies. The missing part should be the same as the serviceTime's 99.99th, but applied to latencies. So the code should be:\n\nStatUtils.percentile(latencies, 99.99d) / TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(1L)\n\nSo replacing the /* TODO: Your code here */ part with that. Let me double-check: the parameters for percentile are the array and the percentile. The 99.99 is written as 99.99d, which is a double. The rest is the division for unit conversion. That should be exactly what's missing here. No other parameters are needed. So the correct line is using StatUtils.percentile on latencies with 99.99d."
