So the code is correct here. The code for pe_positive and pe_negative uses:\n\npe_positive[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)\npe_positive[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)\n\nWait, the position is a tensor of shape (L,1), and div_term is a tensor of shape (d_model/2). So when multiplying, position * div_term would be (L, d_model/2).",

So that gives the sine(-x) = -sin(x), but in the code it's sin(-position*div_term), which is -sin(position*div_term). However, for the negative positions, the formula is supposed to handle it as PE(-x, 2i) = -sin(x/(...)), but let's see:\n\nThe relative positional encoding for negative positions would be for when the relative position is negative. So for a position -k, the PE would be PE(-k, 2i) = sin(-k/(...)) but that's the same as -sin(k/(...)). But in the code, the pe_negative is filled with sin(-1 * position * div_term) for 0::2. So that would be sin(-p * d) which is -sin(p*d). So the first part (even indices) of pe_negative is -sin(p*d), but the cosine part would be cos(-p*d) = cos(p*d). But when flipped, the pe_positive is reversed. So the code seems correct for forming the relative embeddings.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to complete the given Python code for the Wav2Vec2Conformer classes, specifically the missing parts in the Rotary Positional Embedding and Relative Positional Embedding modules. Let me look through the code carefully.\n\nStarting with the Wav2Vec2ConformerRotaryPositionalEmbedding class. The __init__ method has a line where inv_freq is calculated. The comment says to calculate the inverse frequency for rotary embeddings. The current line is:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (# TODO: Your code here.float() / dim))\n\nHmm, the formula for rotary embeddings usually involves exponents based on the dimension. The standard approach is to compute inv_freq as 1/(base^(2i/d)), where i ranges from 0 to (dim//2 - 1). Wait, right, the exponent part here should be (torch.arange(0, dim, 2) / dim). So the missing part is torch.arange(0, dim, 2). Let me see the variables here. The dim is config.hidden_size divided by the number of attention heads. \n\nSo the line should have torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() divided by dim. So replacing the TODO with torch.arange(0, dim, 2). That way, the exponent is (torch.arange(0, dim, 2)/dim). So the inv_freq calculation would be correct.\n\nNow, moving to the Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding class. In the extend_pe function, there's a part where position is multiplied by div_term. The code for pe_positive and pe_negative is using position * div_term. But looking at standard positional encodings, the position is multiplied by some exponential term. Wait, in the standard PE, the formula is pos/10000^(2i/d), which here is implemented via the div_term. Since div_term is exp((2i/d)*ln(10000)), so when multiplied by position, it gives the correct term. But in the code, for pe_positive, the position is a tensor of [0,1,2,...], and the div_term is exp( (2i/d) * (-ln(10000)) ), which is 1/(10000^(2i/d)). So position * div_term would be position / (10000^(2i/d)), so the sin and cos would be correct.\n\nWait, the code for pe_positive's 0::2 (even indices) is sin, and 1::2 (odd) is cos. That aligns with the standard PE. \n\nLooking at the code for pe_positive and pe_negative: the code for pe_positive is using position starting from 0 up to x.size(1), but the pe_negative is using -position. Then, when concatenating, they flip pe_positive and shift. \n\nWait, the code for pe_positive is being flipped along the first dimension (rows), so that the first element becomes the last. For example, if position is 0,1,2, then pe_positive after flip would be 2,1,0. Then, when concatenated with pe_negative (which is from 1 to end), they form a sequence that covers negative positions. \n\nNow, the part where the code might be missing... Let me check the initialization. The __init__ has self.pe initialized to None, and when extend_pe is called, if the existing pe is not sufficient, it creates a new one. The code seems okay, but maybe in the initial creation, the pe_positive and pe_negative are not properly initialized with the right dimensions?\n\nWait, looking at the code for pe_positive and pe_negative: they are initialized as zeros of size (x.size(1), d_model). But then filled with sin and cos. That's okay.\n\nWait, in the code for pe_negative, the line is pe_negative = pe_negative[1:].unsqueeze(0). Because when you concatenate pe_positive (which is reversed), and pe_negative (starting from 1 to exclude the zero?), perhaps to avoid duplication at position 0? Because the middle point would be zero. Let me think: if the original position is from 0 to L-1 (for L being x.size(1)), then pe_positive after flipping becomes L-1, L-2,...0. So the first element is L-1. Then, the concatenated pe would have length 2L-1. Because positive part (length L) reversed, then negative part (from 1 to L elements, so L-1 elements?), so combined length L + (L-1) = 2L-1. That's correct for relative positions. \n\nWait, the code for pe_negative starts at position 1? Because pe_negative is initialized as zeros of the same size as pe_positive (x.size(1)), but when we do pe_negative[1:], that removes the first element. So the pe_negative's elements are for positions 1 to x.size(1)-1, but with negative positions. So when concatenated with the reversed pe_positive (which includes position 0), the total should be 2*L-1. \n\nNow, the problem might be in the initial creation of the positional embeddings. The code for pe_positive and pe_negative uses position which starts at 0. So the sin and cos terms are computed correctly. \n\nLooking through the code for the RelPositionalEmbedding, I think the code is okay. Wait, but in the code for pe_positive and pe_negative, the first dimension is x.size(1), but when creating the pe_positive and pe_negative tensors, they should be properly filled. \n\nWait, another thing: the line div_term_exp is -(math.log(10000.0)/self.d_model), and then the div_term is exp of (arange(0, d_model, 2) * div_term_exp). Let me see: the exponent here is (2\u03c0i/d_model) * something? Wait, the standard formula for positional encoding is:\n\nPE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))\nPE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))\n\nSo the exponent for the division term is (2i / d_model). So the exponent in the denominator's exponent is (2i/d_model) * ln(10000), so the base 10000 is raised to that exponent. Wait, the term inside the sin/cos is pos / (10000^(2i/d_model)) ?\n\nWait, the actual term inside is pos * (1/(10000^(2i/d_model))) ?\n\nSo 10000^(2i/d) = e^{ (2i/d)*ln(10000) }, so 1/(10000^(2i/d)) = e^{ - (2i/d)*ln(10000) }, which is exactly the exp( (2i) * div_term_exp ), since div_term_exp is - (ln(10000)/d_model). \n\nSo the code for div_term is correct. Because:\n\ndiv_term = exp( (2\u03c0i) * ... ), wait, no. Wait, the code uses:\n\ndiv_term = torch.exp( torch.arange(0, self.d_model, 2, dtype=torch.float32) * div_term_exp )\n\nWait, the arange is over 0, 2, ..., up to d_model-2 (if d_model is even). So each term is i = 0,1,..., (d_model//2 -1). \n\nSo each element in the arange is 2*i (since step is 2). Wait, no: torch.arange(0, self.d_model, 2) gives 0,2,4,... up to less than d_model. So for each index j in 0 to (d_model//2 - 1), the value is 2j. \n\nThus, the exponent inside exp is (2j) * div_term_exp. Since div_term_exp is - (ln(10000)/d_model), so the exponent is - (2j * ln(10000)/d_model ), which is exactly the exponent for 1/(10000^(2j/d_model)), so when multiplied by position, gives position/(10000^(2j/d_model)). \n\nSo the code is correct here.\n\nThe code for pe_positive and pe_negative uses:\n\npe_positive[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)\npe_positive[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)\n\nWait, the position is a tensor of shape (L,1), and div_term is a tensor of shape (d_model/2). So when multiplying, position * div_term would be (L, d_model/2). Then, the sin and cos would produce tensors of shape (L, d_model/2). \n\nThe 0::2 in the slices selects even indices (columns 0, 2, 4...) for sine, and the next ones for cosine. Since the d_model is the total dimension, each pair (sin and cos) corresponds to 2i and 2i+1 dimensions. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the code for pe_negative's sine is using -1 * position * div_term. So that gives the sine(-x) = -sin(x), but in the code it's sin(-position*div_term), which is -sin(position*div_term). However, for the negative positions, the formula is supposed to handle it as PE(-x, 2i) = -sin(x/(...)), but let's see:\n\nThe relative positional encoding for negative positions would be for when the relative position is negative. So for a position -k, the PE would be PE(-k, 2i) = sin(-k/(...)) but that's the same as -sin(k/(...)). But in the code, the pe_negative is filled with sin(-1 * position * div_term) for 0::2. So that would be sin(-p * d) which is -sin(p*d). So the first part (even indices) of pe_negative is -sin(p*d), but the cosine part would be cos(-p*d) = cos(p*d). \n\nBut when flipped, the pe_positive is reversed. So the code seems correct for forming the relative embeddings.\n\nNow, looking for missing parts. The user mentioned that there are missing lines or blocks. Let's review the code again.\n\nLooking at the Rotary Positional Embedding's __init__ method. The line with inv_freq:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** ( (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim) ))\n\nWait, the original code has the base raised to the power of (something divided by dim). The step in the arange is correct. So the missing part is torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim. So the exponent is (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim). \n\nWait, in the code as written, the user has written:\n\nbase ** ( # TODO: Your code here.float() / dim)\n\nSo the missing part is torch.arange(0, dim, 2). So the line should be:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim))\n\nSo the TODO part is torch.arange(0, dim, 2). \n\nTherefore, the first missing code is torch.arange(0, dim, 2).\n\nNow, looking at the Relative Positional Embedding. Are there any missing parts?\n\nLooking at the code provided, in the Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding class's extend_pe function:\n\nWait, in the code's __init__ method, there is a line:\n\ninit_tensor = torch.tensor(0.0).expand(1, self.max_len)\n\nWait, that creates a tensor of shape (1, self.max_len) filled with zeros. Then, when we call extend_pe, which is supposed to initialize the pe. \n\nIn the first call to extend_pe during __init__, when x is this init_tensor (size (1, self.max_len)), then x.size(1) would be self.max_len. \n\nBut when the code runs, in the first call to extend_pe, since self.pe is None, it proceeds to create the pe. \n\nWait, but is there any missing part here? The code seems to be complete. The problem statement says there are missing lines in the code to be filled. Since the user provided the code with some TODOs, perhaps the only missing part is the first one in the Rotary embedding's inv_freq?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the forward function of the Rotary embedding: \n\nWait, in the code given for the Rotary class, after computing embeddings = torch.cat((freqs, freqs), dim=-1), which doubles the dimension. Since the original freqs is from the einsum, which is of shape (sequence_length, dim/2), so concatenating along the last dimension would make it (sequence_length, dim). But since the hidden_states are split into heads, and each head has dimension dim. \n\nWait, but the rotary embeddings usually rotate the query and key vectors, and the concatenation here may be correct. \n\nLooking back, the user's problem may only have the one missing part in the inv_freq line. The rest of the code provided by the user may be correct except that.\n\nSo the only missing code is in the inv_freq calculation, replacing the TODO with torch.arange(0, dim, 2).\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\nIn Wav2Vec2ConformerRotaryPositionalEmbedding's __init__:\n\ninv_freq = 1.0 / (base ** (torch.arange(0, dim, 2).float() / dim))\n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"torch.arange(0, dim, 2)\"."
