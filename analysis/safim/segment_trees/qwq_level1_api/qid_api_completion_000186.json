    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a Python code snippet with some TODO comments and want me to fill in the missing parts. The task is to output only the missing code without any extra explanations or formatting. Alright, let me go through the code step by step to find where the gaps are.\n\nFirst, looking at the code, the first missing part is in the print statement right after loading the data. The line says print(# TODO: Your code here). The comment mentions to display the first few rows, so the obvious choice here is to use data.head(). So replacing that TODO with data.head() should do it.\n\nNext, I'll check the rest of the code for other missing parts. The ADF test part seems okay. Then feature selection using correlation: they compute the correlation matrix and select features with absolute correlation above 0.5. They then remove 'TargetVariable' from the selected_features list. That looks correct.\n\nThe ARIMA model is being fit on 'TargetVariable', and then they plot predictions and diagnostics. The SARIMAX part includes exogenous variables from selected_features, which makes sense for multivariate modeling. \n\nThe ANOVA test is applied to the SARIMAX results, which might be a bit tricky. Wait, does the anova_lm function from statsmodels.stats.anova work with SARIMAX results? I recall that anova_lm is typically used for linear models, and SARIMAX is a time series model. But maybe in this context, since SARIMAX can include exogenous variables similar to regression, the user might be trying to get an ANOVA table for the model's parameters. However, this might not be the standard use case, but since the code is written that way, perhaps it's intended as is.\n\nLooking back, the only missing part is indeed that first print statement. The rest of the code seems complete. So the only line needed is data.head() inside the print function. Let me double-check the instructions: they said to output only the missing code as plain text, not in a code block. So the answer should just be the line: print(data.head())?\n\nWait, the original line was print(# TODO...), so replacing the TODO with data.head(), so the correct line is print(data.head()). That's correct because data.head() returns the first few rows, and printing that would display them. So that's the missing code."
