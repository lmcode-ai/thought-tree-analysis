But the comment says \"divides by 2 raised to exp\", so it's a normal division, not exact. So yes, that's correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to complete the code for the DivBy2Exp function. The function is supposed to divide the given mpz_class value by 2 raised to the exponent 'exp'. Let me think about how GMP handles this.\n\nHmm, in GMP, there's a function called mpz_fdiv_q_2exp. Wait, right! The function mpz_fdiv_q_2exp divides a number by 2^exp, truncating towards negative infinity. Or maybe mpz_tdiv_q_2exp? Wait, but the user probably wants the standard division. Alternatively, maybe they just need a straightforward division towards zero. Oh right, the standard function for division by 2^exp is mpz_divexact_2exp, but that's when the division is exact. Wait no, maybe I should check the GMP documentation.\n\nAlternatively, the function mpz_divexact_2exp is for when you know the division is exact. But here, the function name is DivBy2Exp, which might just perform the division regardless. The correct function to use here is mpz_fdiv_q_2exp or mpz_tdiv_q_2exp? Or perhaps mpz_divexact_2exp is not the right one here. Wait, the user's code probably expects a division that truncates towards zero. Because when you divide by 2^exp, the standard division in C++ would do that. So GMP's mpz_tdiv_q_2exp with the 't' meaning towards zero?\n\nWait, let me recall: mpz_div by 2^exp can be done with mpz_tdiv_q_2exp. The function mpz_fdiv_q_2exp truncates towards positive infinity, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the function mpz_div_2exp is there, but I think that's for unsigned division. Alternatively, perhaps the correct function is mpz_fdiv_q_2exp or mpz_tdiv_q_2exp. Wait, perhaps the function mpz_div by 2^exp is done via mpz_div_2exp, but looking at the GMP manual:\n\nLooking up GMP functions:\n\nThe function mpz_div_2exp is a function that divides by 2^exp, but it's named as mpz_div_2exp, but I might be confusing with the variable names here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to use mpz_fdiv_q_2exp or mpz_tdiv_q_2exp. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps there is a simpler function. Wait, the GMP documentation says that mpz_divisible_2exp_p checks divisibility, but here the user just wants division.\n\nAlternatively, the function mpz_fdiv_q_2exp divides and rounds the quotient towards negative infinity. Whereas mpz_tdiv_q_2exp uses the \"truncate towards zero\" mode. Since for positive numbers, both would be same. But for negative numbers, truncating towards zero is the usual division in C. So probably the right approach here is to use the tdiv version.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right function is mpz_tdiv_q_2exp. Let me check the parameters. The function mpz_tdiv_q_2exp takes (quotient, numerator, exp). So the code would be:\n\nmpz_tdiv_q_2exp (ret.get_mpz_t(), value.get_mpz_t(), exp);\n\nWait, but the function name is mpz_tdiv_q_2exp. Let me confirm. The GMP manual says:\n\nThe functions mpz_tdiv_q_2exp and mpz_tdiv_r_2exp do division by a power of two, 2^exp. \n\nYes, so that's the correct function. So in the code, the line should be:\n\nmpz_tdiv_q_2exp(ret.get_mpz_t(), value.get_mpz_t(), exp);\n\nTherefore, in the DivBy2Exp function, the code inside the TODO would be:\n\nmpz_tdiv_q_2exp(ret.get_mpz_t(), value.get_mpz_t(), exp);\n\nWait, but what about the exponent being a uint64_t? The function's third argument is an unsigned long. Since exp is a uint64_t, on a 64-bit system that's okay, but maybe we need to cast it. However, in GMP, the function might accept an unsigned long. Wait, the GMP documentation says:\n\nvoid mpz_tdiv_q_2exp (mpz_t q, mpz_t n, unsigned long int bn)\n\nSo the third parameter is an unsigned long. So if exp is a uint64_t, which is 64 bits, but on a 32-bit system, that could be a problem. However, the function here's parameter 'exp' is uint64_t, so perhaps the code should cast it to unsigned long. But the user's code might expect that exp is within the range of unsigned long. Alternatively, maybe in the context of this code, exp is within that range. Since the user hasn't specified that, but the code is written with uint64_t, perhaps we can cast it to unsigned long. But maybe the code can just pass exp as is. However, if the exp is larger than the number's bits, GMP handles that by returning zero. So the code line would be:\n\nmpz_tdiv_q_2exp(ret.get_mpz_t(), value.get_mpz_t(), exp);\n\nTherefore, the missing code is that line. Let me see the existing code:\n\nIn the DivBy2Exp function:\n\nmpz_class DivBy2Exp(const mpz_class& value, uint64_t exp) {\n  mpz_class ret;\n  /* TODO: Your code here */;  // Divides mpz_class value by 2 raised to exp\n  return ret;\n}\n\nSo the line to replace the comment with is:\n\nmpz_tdiv_q_2exp(ret.get_mpz_t(), value.get_mpz_t(), exp);\n\nWait, but maybe the function is called DivBy2Exp, which might expect the division to be exact? But the comment says \"divides by 2 raised to exp\", so it's a normal division, not exact. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore the missing code is:\n\nmpz_tdiv_q_2exp(ret.get_mpz_t(), value.get_mpz_t(), exp);\n\nSo that's the line that needs to be filled in. Let me make sure there are no other missing parts. The function initializes 'ret' as an mpz_class, then after the function call, returns it. The function call correctly sets the value of 'ret' to the quotient. So yes, that's the correct code."
