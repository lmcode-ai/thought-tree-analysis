The inv_freq is a 1D tensor of length dim//2 (since step is 2, but the code says step=2, then the arange is 0 to dim step 2. So inv_freq has length dim/2. Then when multiplied by time_stamps (sequence_length elements), the einsum gives a (sequence_length, dim/2) matrix. Then they concatenate it to get dim size. So time_stamps is the positions, which should be from 0 to sequence_length-1. So the line should be time_stamps = torch.arange(sequence_length).float(). Yes, that makes sense.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to complete the code for these two positional embedding classes in PyTorch. Let's start with the first one, the Wav2Vec2ConformerRotaryPositionalEmbedding.\n\nLooking at the Rotary Positional Embedding class. The __init__ method initializes inv_freq by calculating the inverse frequencies based on the hidden dimension and the base. Then in the forward method, the code checks if the cached embeddings can be reused. If not, it proceeds to generate the time stamps and compute the frequency embeddings using einsum. The problem is the line where time_stamps is assigned\u2014 that's the TODO.\n\nHmm, the time_stamps should be the position indices along the sequence length. Since the hidden_states have a shape of (batch, sequence_length, ...) but for positional embeddings, the positions are from 0 to sequence_length-1. So time_stamps should be a tensor of shape (sequence_length,) containing the positions. Let's see, in the code, sequence_length is hidden_states.shape[1], so time_stamps is probably torch.arange(sequence_length).float(). \n\nWait, because when they do torch.einsum(\"i,j->ij\", time_stamps, inv_freq), the time_stamps is the first dimension. The inv_freq is a 1D tensor of length dim//2 (since step is 2, but the code says step=2, then the arange is 0 to dim step 2. So inv_freq has length dim/2. Then when multiplied by time_stamps (sequence_length elements), the einsum gives a (sequence_length, dim/2) matrix. Then they concatenate it to get dim size. \n\nSo time_stamps is the positions, which should be from 0 to sequence_length-1. So the line should be time_stamps = torch.arange(sequence_length).float(). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So that's the missing line.\n\nNow the second class, Wav2Vec2ConformerRelPositionalEmbedding. Let me check where the code might be missing. Looking at the extend_pe function. The code initializes pe_positive and pe_negative as tensors of size (x.size(1), d_model). Then position is created as a tensor from 0 to x.size(1)-1. The div_term is exp for the cosine/sine terms. \n\nWait, in the code for pe_positive, they set the even and odd indices using sin and cos. However, when initializing pe_positive and pe_negative, they are initialized with zeros. But then they only fill the even and odd indices starting from 0. Wait, the code:\n\npe_positive = torch.zeros(x.size(1), self.d_model)\nposition = torch.arange(0, x.size(1), dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(1)\ndiv_term_exp = -(math.log(10000.0) / self.d_model)\ndiv_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, self.d_model, 2, dtype=torch.float32) * div_term_exp)\npe_positive[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)\npe_positive[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)\nSimilarly for pe_negative. \n\nWait, that should work but I don't see any missing code here. Wait, the problem is maybe in the initialization of pe_positive and pe_negative? Let me check the code step by step. \n\nWait, the code for the relative positional encoding seems okay. The user didn't mention any TODO in the RelPositionalEmbedding part. The problem might have been in the Rotary one. \n\nWait the user's instruction was to complete the code where there's a TODO. The only TODO is in the Rotary class's forward function. So the only missing part is the time_stamps assignment. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that in the Rotary class's forward method, the line after the comment should be:\n\ntime_stamps = torch.arange(sequence_length).float()\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The variable sequence_length is hidden_states.shape[1], which is correct. The Rotary's frequency calculation uses time_stamps multiplied by inv_freq. The inv_freq is 1/(base^(...), so each dimension's frequency is correct. \n\nYes, that's all. The rest of the code in the Rotary class seems okay. The RelPositionalEmbedding code doesn't have any TODO, so maybe that's already correct as per the user's code input. \n\nTherefore, the only missing code is the line for time_stamps in the RotaryPositionalEmbedding class."
