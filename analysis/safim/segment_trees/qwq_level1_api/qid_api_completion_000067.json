    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete the Java code provided by filling in the missing parts. The user mentioned that I should only output the missing code, not the whole program, and in plain text. Alright, let's go through each TODO section step by step.\n\nFirst, the first comment says: Check if a string \"12345\" is numeric using Apache Commons Lang. The variable isNumeric is supposed to hold that boolean result. I remember that Apache Commons Lang has a StringUtils class with a method for checking if a string is numeric. What's the method name again? I think it's isNumeric. So maybe StringUtils.isNumeric(\"12345\"). But wait, the parameter is the string, right? So the code would be StringUtils.isNumeric(\"12345\"). Let me make sure. Yes, that's correct. So the line should be:\n\nboolean isNumeric = StringUtils.isNumeric(\"12345\");\n\nWait, but wait, the string is \"12345\", which is numeric, so that's good. The method returns a boolean, so that's exactly what we need. Okay, that's the first part.\n\nThe second comment is already filled, as it shows reversed = StringUtils.reverse(\"Hello World\"); so that's done.\n\nThird part is reading the file, which is done using FileUtils.readFileToString, so that line is okay.\n\nThen writing to a file is also done with FileUtils.writeStringToFile.\n\nThe last part is calculating the MD5 hash of \"Sample text\" using DigestUtils.md5Hex. The line is already there, so that's okay.\n\nWait, the problem only mentions the first TODO. Let me check the code again. Looking at the main method:\n\nThe first TODO is for the isNumeric variable. The rest of the lines have their code filled except that. So the only missing part is the line assigning isNumeric. The user wants only the missing code, which is that one line. But wait, let me check again. The code given has:\n\nboolean isNumeric = /* TODO: Your code here */;\n\nSo that's the only missing part. The rest of the lines after that have their code. So the answer is just the right-hand side of that assignment.\n\nWait, the question says \"output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly\". So the missing code is the expression after the = sign. So the user expects the code to be:\n\nStringUtils.isNumeric(\"12345\");\n\nSo the line is replacing the comment with that.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me confirm once again. The method is isNumeric in StringUtils, and the parameter is the string \"12345\". So that's correct. I think that's all. The other lines are already filled as per the problem statement."
