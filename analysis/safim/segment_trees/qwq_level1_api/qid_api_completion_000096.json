For example, the 90th percentile is done with StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 90.0d). Then they divide by TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(1L) to convert nanoseconds to milliseconds.\n\nThe missing part is the 50th percentile, which is the median. So I should replace the TODO comment with StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 50.0d). That makes sense because the 50th percentile is the median. \n\nWait, let me check the parameters. The method StatUtils.percentile takes the array and the percentile. So yes, 50.0d for the median. Then divide by the same conversion factor as the others. So the line should be StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 50.0d) divided by the TimeUnit conversion. \n\nSo putting that in, the missing code is StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 50.0d).
