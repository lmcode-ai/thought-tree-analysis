    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a Python code with some missing parts that I need to fill in. The task is to complete the code so that it runs correctly. The instructions say to output only the missing code, not the entire program, and as plain text. Alright, let me go through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the function load_model_and_tokenizer. The problem is in the 'electra' case. The model is initialized correctly with ElectraForSequenceClassification, but the tokenizer line is a TODO. The other models (BERT and DistilBERT) have their respective tokenizer assignments. For Electra, I think the tokenizer should be ElectraTokenizer, similar to how the others are handled.\n\nSo the line should be: tokenizer = ElectraTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name). That's straightforward. Let me confirm: the model_names dictionary for 'electra' uses \"google/electra-base-discriminator\", which is correct. So the tokenizer should be created from that same model_name. So that's the missing line.\n\nNext, check the other parts. The prepare_input function uses encode_plus with premise and hypothesis, returning tensors. That seems okay. The evaluate_mnli function uses the model's outputs to get the prediction. The main function looks okay too. The only missing part is indeed the Electra tokenizer line.\n\nWait, are there any other possible missing parts? Let me check again. The user might have other TODOs, but in the given code, the only TODO is in the Electra's tokenizer assignment. So the answer should just be that line.\n\nSo the correct code to fill in is:\n\ntokenizer = ElectraTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nYes, that's it. No other changes needed. The rest of the code should work as is. Let me make sure I didn't miss any imports or other sections. The imports already include ElectraTokenizer, so that's covered. Alright, that's the only missing line."
