So the code should be:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n}\n\nHmm, but that's inside the existing try block.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let me look at this code and figure out what's missing. The task is to complete the Java code for the UnzipTransform class. The user mentioned that there's a TODO comment where I need to add code. Let me check the context around that.\n\nThe method is called unpack, and it's handling unzipping a file into a target directory. The loop goes through each entry in the zip file. For each entry that's not a directory, it creates the necessary directories and then tries to copy the entry's data to an output file. The TODO is inside the try block with the FileOutputStream. \n\nSo, the part that's missing is copying the data from the zip entry's input stream to the output stream. The ZipEntry has a way to get an InputStream. The code needs to read the contents of the zip entry and write them to the outputStream.\n\nLooking at the imports, there's org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. Oh right, IOUtils has a copy method which can take an InputStream and an OutputStream. So probably, the code should get the input stream from the zip entry, then use IOUtils.copy to copy it to the output stream.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get the input stream for the current zip entry: zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)\n2. Use IOUtils.copy to copy from the input stream to the output stream (outputStream)\n3. Make sure to close the input stream, but since IOUtils.copy handles that if we pass true?\n\nWait, the try-with-resources for the outputStream is already there. The input stream should also be properly closed. Alternatively, since we're using IOUtils.copy, maybe it's better to use try-with-resources for the input stream as well. Wait, but the code as written only has the outputStream in the try. Hmm.\n\nWait, the current code has:\n\ntry (FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(outputPath.toFile())) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */;\n}\n\nSo inside here, we need to get the input stream from the zip entry. Let's see:\n\nSo inside that block:\n\nInputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry);\nIOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\ninputStream.close();\n\nBut using IOUtils.copy might automatically close the stream? Wait, the IOUtils.copy method signature: the javadoc says that if the close parameter is true, it will close the streams. Wait, looking up: the method IOUtils.copy(InputStream input, OutputStream output) does not close them by default. There's an overload with a third boolean parameter. So perhaps we should use that. Alternatively, we can use try-with-resources for the input stream as well.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n}\n\nBut in this case, the inputStream would be closed automatically when leaving the try block, which is okay. However, the current code's try block is only for the outputStream, so the inputStream needs to be inside that. Wait, the code is inside the try for the outputStream, so perhaps:\n\nInside the TODO block:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // Maybe log or rethrow?\n    // Since the method already throws IOException, perhaps just let it propagate.\n    throw new IOException(\"Error copying entry \" + zipEntry.getName(), e);\n}\n\nBut maybe even simpler. Since the code's surrounding try is already in a block that can throw IOException, perhaps just use:\n\nInputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry);\nIOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\ninputStream.close();\n\nBut closing the inputStream explicitly. However, using try-with-resources is better to ensure it's closed even if an error occurs. So the better approach would be:\n\nInside the TODO section:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n}\n\nBut since this is inside the existing try-with-resources for the outputStream, that's okay. The inputStream will be closed when the block exits. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code can use IOUtils.copy(zip.getInputStream(zipEntry), outputStream), but that would leave the input stream open. So better to use the try-with-resources approach.\n\nTherefore, the missing code should be:\n\nInputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry);\nIOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\ninputStream.close();\n\nBut using try-with-resources is better, so:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n}\n\nWait, but that's inside the existing try block for the outputStream. So that's acceptable. The code inside the TODO needs to read the zip entry's data and write it to the output file. \n\nTherefore, the correct code would be to get the input stream from the zip entry, copy it to the output stream. So the code between the TODO comment should be:\n\nInputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry);\nIOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\ninputStream.close();\n\nAlternatively, using the try-with-resources approach, which is better. So the code would be enclosed in a try-with-resources for the input stream. \n\nYes, that's better. So the code would be:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n}\n\nBut since the outputStream is already in a try-with-resources (the outer one), this is okay.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is those three lines using try-with-resources. Alternatively, if you don't use that, but the first approach. But the try-with-resources is better. So I think that's the right code to put there. Let me check if there are any other possible issues. The outputStream is already open, so writing to it is correct. \n\nAnother thing to note: The ZipFile's getInputStream requires the entry, so zip.getInputStream(zipEntry) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nInputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry);\nIOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\ninputStream.close();\n\nOr better with the try-with-resources, as that's more idiomatic and ensures proper closure. So the code should be:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n}\n\nHmm, but that's inside the existing try block. So that's acceptable. The code will compile and work. \n\nSo the correct missing code is the try-with-resources block for the input stream, copying using IOUtils.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the code inside the TODO block:\n\ntry (InputStream inputStream = zip.getInputStream(zipEntry)) {\n    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);\n}\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code can be written without the try-with, but the try-with is better.\n\nYes, that should be the missing code."
