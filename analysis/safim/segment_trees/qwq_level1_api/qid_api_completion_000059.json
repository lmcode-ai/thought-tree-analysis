The comment mentions building a string to string cache with a maximum size of 100 and entries expiring 10 minutes after writing. \n\nHmm, I remember that Caffeine is a cache library. To create a cache, you use the Caffeine.newBuilder() method. Then you set the maximum size with maximumSize() and the expiration with expireAfterWrite(). \n\nWait, the expiration is 10 minutes after writing, so I should use expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES). And the maximum size is 100, so maximumSize(100). Then build() the cache.\n\nPutting it all together, the line should be something like:\n\nCaffeine.newBuilder().maximumSize(100).expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES).build();\n\nYes, that should do it. Let me double-check the method names. expireAfterWrite takes duration and time unit. The maximumSize is correct. Then build() returns the Cache. So the assignment is cache = that whole expression.\n\nI think that's all. The rest of the code seems to have the correct method calls, so the only missing part is the cache initialization line."
