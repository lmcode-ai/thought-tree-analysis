    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see what the user is asking here. They provided a Python code snippet that's incomplete, and they want me to fill in the missing parts. The task is to output only the missing code, not the entire program or any extra info. Alright, let's go through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the code starts by importing necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and matplotlib. Then it reads a CSV file into a DataFrame, checks for stationarity with the ADF test, does feature selection based on correlation, fits an ARIMA model, and then a SARIMAX model. The user mentions a TODO comment in the plotting section after the ARIMA model diagnostics. Let me look at that part again.\n\nLooking at the code, after fitting the ARIMA model, they create subplots. The first subplot is for the ARIMA predictions using plot_predict, and the second is for diagnostics with plot_diagnostics. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" between the subplots and the plt.show(). Hmm, what's missing here?\n\nWait, the code as written has two subplots. The first is plt.subplot(211) where they plot the predictions, and the second is subplot(212) where they call plot_diagnostics. But the plot_diagnostics method from statsmodels might already generate multiple plots in one figure. Wait, the ARIMA results' plot_diagnostics usually creates a 2x2 grid of diagnostic plots. But since it's placed in a subplot(212), maybe that's causing an issue. Or maybe the user wants additional plots in the first subplot?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TODO is indicating that the code there is incomplete. Let me check the structure again. The code after the first subplot (the predictions) is the second subplot calling plot_diagnostics. The problem is that plot_diagnostics might not be compatible with being placed into a subplot. Because plot_diagnostics already creates its own set of subplots. So maybe the user's code here is incorrect, and the TODO is pointing out that the plot_diagnostics is being placed into a subplot which might cause an error.\n\nWait, the original code's structure is:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(...)\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\n\nBut plot_diagnostics creates four subplots itself. So putting that into a subplot(212) would lead to a subplot within a subplot, which is not correct. That's probably the error. The user's code has a mistake here, so the TODO is to fix that.\n\nSo the correct approach would be to separate the plots. The first subplot is the predictions, and then the diagnostics should be in a separate plot or arranged properly. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the diagnostics in the second subplot but that's not possible. Therefore, the correct code would be to first plot the predictions in the first subplot, then plot the diagnostics in the second subplot but in a way that accommodates the four plots. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to split the figure into two rows, with the first being the prediction and the second being the diagnostics, but in that case, the diagnostics method should be adjusted.\n\nWait, looking at the ARIMA results' plot_diagnostics method, according to the documentation, it creates a 2x2 grid of plots (residuals, histogram, Q-Q, and correlogram). So if you call it inside a subplot, it might not work. So the mistake here is that the user is trying to place the plot_diagnostics into a subplot. The correct way would be to create a figure with the first subplot for the predictions, then create another figure or a separate area for the diagnostics. Alternatively, adjust the figure size and layout so that the diagnostics can fit into the subplot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to split the figure into two rows: the first row is the prediction, and the second row is the diagnostics, but since the diagnostics themselves are four plots, maybe they need to be arranged differently. But that's tricky. Maybe the correct approach is to first call plot_predict in the first subplot, then in the second subplot, plot one of the diagnostics (like residuals), but that would require accessing the residuals from arima_results and then plotting them manually. However, the code as written is trying to use plot_diagnostics in the second subplot, which is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the TODO comment suggests that this part is incorrect and needs fixing. The user probably expects the missing code to fix this. The solution is to remove the subplot for the diagnostics and let it plot in its own figure, or adjust the way the figure is structured.\n\nWait, looking again at the user's code:\n\nAfter creating the figure and subplots:\n\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(...)\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\n\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nThen plt.show()\n\nThe problem is that plot_diagnostics creates multiple subplots, so putting it into a subplot(212) will cause it to be placed inside that subplot's axis, leading to a figure within a subplot, which might cause errors or display issues. So to fix this, the plot_diagnostics should be called without being placed into a subplot, perhaps in a separate figure, or adjust the code so that the diagnostics are arranged properly.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to call plot_diagnostics on its own, not inside the subplot structure. But the user's code wants to have two plots: the predictions and the diagnostics. So perhaps the first subplot is the predictions, then the second part is four plots from the diagnostics. But that would require a different figure setup. Maybe the user intended to have two separate figures, but they are trying to put them into one figure with two rows, but the second row can't hold four plots. So maybe the solution is to split the figure into two separate plots, or adjust the layout.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the code, and the correct way is to call plot_diagnostics on its own, not within the subplot. So the missing code is to remove the subplot(212) and let plot_diagnostics create its own figure. However, the user's code structure has the plt.subplot(212) before calling plot_diagnostics, which is causing the problem. Therefore, the TODO is to fix that code.\n\nWait, the user's code's TODO is exactly at the point where the code is between the subplot calls and the plt.show(). The code as it is written has a comment saying \"TODO: Your code here\" after the two subplot calls. So perhaps the user intended to add code there to display the figure correctly, but the main issue is the misuse of plot_diagnostics in the subplot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to add more code there. Wait, perhaps the original code's plot_diagnostics() is correct but when called inside a subplot, it's not working. So the correct code would be to not use the subplot for the diagnostics. The user's code may have an error here, and the TODO is to correct that. So the correct approach is to adjust the code so that the diagnostics are plotted in their own figure, or properly within the existing one.\n\nWait, let me think again. The code after the first subplot is:\n\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(...)\nplt.title('First title')\n\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('Second title')\n\nThen plt.show()\n\nThe problem here is that plot_diagnostics returns an axes object that is part of a 2x2 grid. So when you call plot_diagnostics() inside a subplot(212), it will try to place its own four subplots into the second subplot's axis, which is not possible. Therefore, the code will throw an error.\n\nThe solution is to not put the diagnostics inside a subplot. Instead, first plot the predictions in the first subplot, then create a new figure or adjust the layout for the diagnostics. Alternatively, the user might have intended to plot the predictions and then the diagnostics in separate figures. But given the code structure, perhaps the correct way is to remove the subplot(212) call and let plot_diagnostics create its own figure. However, since the user has structured the code with subplots, the intended code might involve reorganizing the plots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and wants to plot the diagnostics as a single plot, not the four, so they can extract the residuals and plot them. For example, in the second subplot, plot the residuals. Let me think.\n\nLooking up ARIMA results' attributes, the residuals are in arima_results.resid. So, perhaps they want to plot the residuals in the second subplot. But the original code uses plot_diagnostics, which provides more detailed diagnostics. Alternatively, the user might need to adjust the code to plot only the residuals in the second subplot.\n\nAlternatively, the correct approach here is to separate the two plots. So, first, plot the predictions in a subplot, then plot the diagnostics in another figure. But the user's code is structured to have two subplots in one figure. Therefore, maybe the missing code is to properly create the figure with enough subplots. Alternatively, the user might have intended to have the first subplot as predictions, and the second subplot as the residuals, along with other diagnostics.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be simply that the user's code is missing the call to plt.show() or they forgot to write some code. But the existing code has plt.show() at the end, which would be needed. Wait, the code as written does have plt.show() after the TODO comment. But the error is in the way plot_diagnostics is called inside a subplot. So the correct fix is to remove the subplot(212) and instead, after the first subplot, have a second figure for the diagnostics. Or perhaps the user wants to have two separate figures, one for the predictions and another for the diagnostics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to split the figure into two rows, first the prediction and then the diagnostics, but the diagnostics need to be arranged in a way that can fit into one subplot. However, since the diagnostics are four plots, that's not feasible. Thus, the solution is to remove the subplot(212) call, so that plot_diagnostics creates its own figure. But the user's current code has the two subplots and the TODO is where? Let me check again the code provided:\n\nThe code after the ARIMA fitting:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(...)\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n# TODO: Your code here\nplt.show()\n\nAh, the TODO is exactly after the two subplots. The problem is that the code is using plot_diagnostics inside the second subplot, which is incorrect, so the solution is to remove the plt.subplot(212) call before plot_diagnostics.\n\nWait, so the user's code is:\n\nAfter creating the figure with size (10,8):\n\nCall subplot(211), plot the predictions, set the title.\n\nThen call subplot(212), then call plot_diagnostics(), set title.\n\nBut plot_diagnostics() creates four plots in a 2x2 grid, so putting that inside a subplot(212) would cause an error because the function expects to create its own subplots.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to be adjusted here. The correct approach would be to first do:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\n\nFirst subplot (211) for predictions.\n\nThen, after that subplot, call plot_diagnostics() without placing it into another subplot. But that would result in the diagnostics being in a separate figure. Alternatively, adjust the figure to have enough space.\n\nAlternatively, the correct code would be to split the figure into two parts, first the prediction and then the diagnostics, but since the diagnostics require four plots, maybe the user wants to display them in the second subplot as a grid. However, I don't think that's possible because the plot_diagnostics function creates its own grid, so it can't be placed into a single subplot.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to remove the subplot(212) and let the plot_diagnostics create its own figure. However the user's code has the plt.subplot(212) before the call to plot_diagnostics, which is wrong. So the missing code here is to remove the call to subplot(212) before the plot_diagnostics line. But the user is asking to fill in the missing code, not to modify existing code. Wait the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Complete the code in python: ... Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly.\"\n\nAh, so the user provided code that has a missing part where the TODO is placed, perhaps the code after the two subplots needs something. Or maybe the existing code has an error that needs correction via adding some code. Alternatively, perhaps the TODO is indicating that there is a missing part there that needs code.\n\nWait the code as written after the first two subplots has a comment TODO: Your code here, then plt.show(). So perhaps the user intended for some code to be there, but what?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to add some additional plotting commands between the subplots and the show. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing a line to display the title for the second subplot.\n\nWait, the existing code does have a plt.title() after the plot_diagnostics call. But since plot_diagnostics creates multiple subplots, that title would only apply to the first of its four plots, which is probably not intended. But the error is in the subplot setup.\n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to remove the subplot(212) and instead, after the first subplot, proceed to plot the diagnostics in their own figure, but then how to make it so that both figures are displayed? The user has the plt.show() at the end, which would show all figures generated up to that point.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be structured as follows:\n\n1. Create the first figure with the predictions (the first subplot 211).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The code currently has:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\n\nThen subplot(211) for the predictions.\n\nThen subplot(212), then plot_diagnostics, which creates four plots. This would lead to an error because plot_diagnostics can't be placed into a subplot's axis. So the correct code would be to not use the subplot for the diagnostics.\n\nTherefore, the code should be modified to have the first subplot, then after that, call plot_diagnostics without a subplot. But since the figure was already created with the first subplot, adding the plot_diagnostics would add its own subplots to the same figure. But the problem is the existing figure's layout.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended to have two separate figures: one for the predictions and another for the diagnostics. In that case, after the first figure (with the predictions subplot), create a new figure for the diagnostics. So the missing code would be:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.show()\n\nBut that's not the case here. Alternatively, the code needs to be adjusted so that the diagnostics are in a separate figure, hence the missing code could be inserting a new figure before the diagnostics plot.\n\nWait, let me think of the correct approach. The user's code has the following:\n\nThe first part is creating a figure with two subplots, but the second subplot is causing an error. To fix this, perhaps the second subplot should be removed, and the plot_diagnostics is called outside of any subplot in that figure. But the way the code is structured now, the plot_diagnostics is in the second subplot, which is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the correct code would be to remove the subplot(212) and the plt.title() for diagnostics, then call plot_diagnostics() after the first subplot, which would add it to the same figure but in a new part, but that might not work due to the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to split into two separate figures. The user's code has the first figure with the two subplots (which isn't working because of the diagnostics), so the missing code could be to create a new figure for the diagnostics. Therefore, the code should be:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(...)\nplt.title(...)\nplt.subplot(212)\n# perhaps plot something else here, like residuals, but not the diagnostics.\n\nBut the user wants to plot the diagnostics. Since that's not feasible here, the alternative is to have a separate figure for the diagnostics. So the missing code after the first two subplots (the TODO) would be to create a new figure and plot the diagnostics there.\n\nWait, looking at the user's code:\n\nAfter the two subplots (the second being subplot(212)), the code has the TODO, then plt.show(). So perhaps the user intended to add another subplot here, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing a call to plt.tight_layout() or something to adjust the spacing. Or perhaps the user missed the closing of the figure?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the plot_diagnostics() returns an axes object and the user forgot to capture it, but that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to add code to plot the residuals in the second subplot. For that, the code would be something like:\n\nIn the second subplot (212):\n\nplt.plot(arima_results.resid)\n\nBut then that would be a single line. The user's code currently has plot_diagnostics(), which is incorrect. So the missing code would be replacing plot_diagnostics with plotting the residuals, along with other diagnostics perhaps. But the user's code uses the anova test later, which is for SARIMAX, not the ARIMA.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again: the problem is the code as written has an error because it's trying to put plot_diagnostics into a subplot. The correct way is to not do that. So the solution is to remove the subplot(212) and the title, then call plot_diagnostics() on its own, but within the same figure? Or in a new figure?\n\nAlternatively, the correct code is to have two figures:\n\nFirst: The predictions plot.\n\nSecond: The diagnostics plot.\n\nTherefore, modifying the code as follows:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(start=1, end=100)\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\n\n# Remove the subplot(212) and the plot_diagnostics here.\n\nThen, after that, create a new figure:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nThen plt.show().\n\nBut the user's code currently has the code up to the TODO, where the existing code (before the TODO) includes the subplot(212), so the missing code would involve changing that part. Since the user wants us to output only the missing code, perhaps the correct answer is to replace the subplot(212) and the erroneous call with proper code.\n\nAlternatively, the missing code is to add something after the second subplot's call. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's code is missing the actual call to plot the diagnostics correctly, so the correct code would be to call the diagnostics in a way that fits into the subplot.\n\nWait, looking at the documentation: The plot_diagnostics method of ARIMA results can take a figure parameter. Maybe the user needs to pass the current axes or figure to it. Let me check the statsmodels documentation.\n\nLooking up ARIMA Results' plot_diagnostics method:\n\nThe function signature is:\n\ndef plot_diagnostics(self, variable=0, lags=10, fig=None, figsize=None, **kwargs)\n\nSo if the user wants to plot the diagnostics into the current figure's subplot, they can specify the fig parameter. But the current code is inside a subplot (212), which is an axes object. So perhaps the correct code is to call plot_diagnostics with the current axes.\n\nWait, but the function expects a figure, not an axes. Alternatively, maybe the user should create a new figure for the diagnostics, but that would require creating a new figure.\n\nAlternatively, the user can split the figure into two rows, first for the prediction, and then the second row for the four diagnostics plots arranged vertically, but that might not fit. It's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the user's mistake is trying to use plot_diagnostics in a subplot, so the correct code is to remove the subplot(212) and call plot_diagnostics() in its own figure, but then how to structure the code in the existing code block?\n\nThe original code has:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(...)\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n# TODO: Your code here\nplt.show()\n\nThe error is in the subplot(212) line. The correct approach is to not use subplot(212) before calling plot_diagnostics. Therefore, the missing code is to remove the subplot(212), but since the user can only add code and not modify, perhaps the code should be rewritten as:\n\nAfter the first subplot:\n\n# plt.subplot(212)  # Remove this line\n\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\n\nBut since the user can't delete lines, maybe the correct code is to call plot_diagnostics without the subplot. Therefore, the code should be modified by removing the subplot call, but the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines. Alternatively, the TODO is where the user should insert code to handle the subplot correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to add a title to the figure, so the missing code is to have a title for the entire figure. Or perhaps the code needs to close the first subplot before moving on. But that's unlikely.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made an error in the code, and the correct answer is to replace the subplot(212) and the plot_diagnostics call with proper code that allows the diagnostics to be displayed. The correct code would be to not use the subplot for the diagnostics, so the missing code would be to comment out or remove the subplot(212) call. But since we can only add code, perhaps the solution is to create a new figure after the first subplot:\n\nAfter the first subplot's title:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nBut then the original figure's first subplot and this new figure would both be displayed when plt.show() is called.\n\nWait, but the user's code currently has the first figure with two subplots. The missing code is after the two subplot calls, so perhaps the correct code is to close the first figure and start a new one. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the user's code has a mistake in the plotting section, and the correct code is to replace the subplot(212) call and instead, after the first subplot, create a new figure for the diagnostics. Therefore, the missing code at the TODO is to add:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nBut the existing code already has a title after the plot_diagnostics. However, with that approach, the first figure (with the prediction) and the new figure (with diagnostics) would both display when plt.show() is called.\n\nThis could be the correct approach. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nBut the user's existing code has a plt.subplot(212) before the plot_diagnostics, so the solution would involve omitting that and creating a new figure. However, since the user's instruction is to fill in the missing code without altering existing lines, perhaps the correct code to add after the TODO is the call to create a new figure and plot the diagnostics there.\n\nAlternatively, the user's code has an error in the subplot call, so the correct code to add there is to not put it into a subplot. But since that involves modifying existing code, perhaps the user wants the code after the two subplot calls. The existing code's TODO is after the two subplot lines and before plt.show(). So the missing code could be to add another figure or adjust the layout.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's code is missing the necessary call to display the figure correctly, but they already have plt.show(). So I'm a bit confused.\n\nAnother angle: The user's code is supposed to run correctly, but the plot_diagnostics is in the wrong place. The correct approach is to call plot_diagnostics without the subplot(), so the code after the first subplot should be:\n\nAfter the first subplot:\n\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Predictions')\n\n# Remove the subplot(212)\n# Instead, plot diagnostics in their own figure\narima_results.plot_diagnostics(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nBut the user's code has the subplot(212) call. Since we can't remove lines, maybe the correct code to add is to pass the current axes to the plot_diagnostics function?\n\nWait, the plot_diagnostics function can accept the fig parameter. So perhaps, after the subplot(212), the code can save the current axes and pass it to the function:\n\ncurrent_ax = plt.gca()\narima_results.plot_diagnostics(fig=current_ax.figure)\n\nBut I'm not sure if this works. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to split the figure into multiple subplots manually and plot each diagnostic separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to replace the plot_diagnostics() call with something else. For example, plot the residuals in the second subplot:\n\nplt.subplot(212)\nplt.plot(arima_results.resid)\nplt.title('Residuals')\n\nBut then that would only show one diagnostic.\n\nAlternatively, the user's code has an error and the correct missing code is to call plt.tight_layout() before plt.show() to adjust the layout, which might resolve the subplot overlap issue. But that might not fix the underlying issue with plot_diagnostics.\n\nHmm, considering all this, I think the main problem is that the user is trying to call plot_diagnostics inside a subplot, which is not allowed, leading to an error. The correct approach is to not use the subplot for the diagnostics. So the missing code is to remove the subplot(212) and the title, then call plot_diagnostics in its own figure. Therefore, the correct code after the first subplot would be:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.subplot(211)\narima_results.plot_predict(...)\nplt.title(...)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title(...)\n\nBut the user has existing code that includes the subplot(212). Since we can't edit existing lines, perhaps the code to add after the TODO is to create a new figure. But the existing code has the plt.subplot(212) before the TODO. So the correct code would involve replacing that, but since we can only add, not modify, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's code has a mistake in the subplot numbering. For example, the first subplot is 211 (the first row of two rows), and the second subplot is 212 (second row). But plot_diagnostics needs more space. Maybe the figure should have a larger size and the second subplot is split into four subplots, but I don't know how to do that programmatically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct code is to use the second subplot to plot the residuals, and the user forgot to do that. So the missing code is:\n\nIn the second subplot (212), plot the residuals:\n\nplt.plot(arima_results.resid)\nplt.title('Residuals')\n\nBut then the original code's call to plot_diagnostics should be removed, which we can't do. Hence, the missing code is replacing plot_diagnostics with plotting residuals.\n\nBut the user's code currently has the plot_diagnostics() line. Since we can only add code, perhaps the correct missing code is to replace that, but the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines.\n\nAlternatively, the user's code is correct except for needing to call plt.tight_layout() before showing the plot. So the missing code is:\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nPlaced before plt.show().\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would resolve the subplot issue with plot_diagnostics.\n\nAt this point, given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the most plausible answer is that the user's code has an error in the subplot call for plot_diagnostics. The correct code is to call plot_diagnostics outside of any subplot in a new figure. Therefore, the missing code to add after the first subplot (but before plt.show()) is:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nHowever, since the existing code has the subplot(212) line before the TODO, the correct approach would be to remove that line and replace it with the new figure call, but since we can only add missing code, perhaps the answer is to create a new figure and plot the diagnostics there.\n\nAlternatively, the missing code is to add plt.tight_layout() before plt.show().\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user forgot to import matplotlib's pyplot and that's the missing line, but they already have import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.\n\nHmm. Considering that the user's code has the TODO immediately after the subplot(212) call and before plt.show(), perhaps the correct code to add is:\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nTo adjust the spacing between subplots. But whether this would fix the plot_diagnostics issue is unclear. Alternatively, the error is that the plot_diagnostics is creating multiple subplots that overlap, so calling plt.tight_layout() would help arrange them properly. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the user's code is correct except for needing to call the plot_diagnostics on the correct figure. Since plot_diagnostics creates its own figure by default, perhaps the code should be modified to pass the existing figure, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the user's error is that they forgot to add the selected features into the ARIMA model. Wait no, the ARIMA model is fitted on 'TargetVariable' only. The SARIMAX includes exog variables. So that's okay.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the most logical solution, I'll go with the assumption that the plot_diagnostics() call should be in its own figure, so the missing code is to create a new figure for that after the first plot. Therefore, the code to add at the TODO location is:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nBut since the existing code already has a title after the plot_diagnostics(), maybe the code is:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nBut this would create a new figure. Thus, the complete code would have two figures displayed: one with the predictions and another with the diagnostics. The user's original code had a single figure with two subplots, which was incorrect. Therefore, the correct missing code is the new figure call.\n\nSo the output would be the lines:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title('ARIMA Model Diagnostics')\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after the first subplot, the user has:\n\nplt.subplot(212)\narima_results.plot_diagnostics()\nplt.title(...)\n\nThen the TODO, then plt.show().\n\nIf we add the new figure code after the TODO, it would be after the subplot calls. But that would create a third figure. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the correct missing code is to replace the subplot(212) with creating a new figure, but since we can't modify existing lines, perhaps the code to add after the TODO is to create a new figure for the diagnostics.\n\nGiven all this confusion, I think the minimal change is to add plt.tight_layout() before plt.show(), which might fix the layout issues caused by the subplot and plot_diagnostics combination. So the missing code is:\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nThus, the user adds that line after the TODO, before plt.show(), which might help arrange the plots properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's code is okay, and the TODO is a mistake, but the code is correct. But given the context, the most likely missing code is plt.tight_layout().\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck here, but I think the most plausible answer is adding plt.tight_layout() to adjust the layout, so the missing code is:\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nThat's one line to add before plt.show()."
