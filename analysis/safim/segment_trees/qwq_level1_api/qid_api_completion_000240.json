Even if it's sinusoidal, you still need an embedding layer, but its weights are set by the sinusoidal function instead of being trained.\n\nSo the position_embeddings should be initialized as an nn.Embedding with the max_position_embeddings as the number of embeddings, and the dimension as config.dim.
