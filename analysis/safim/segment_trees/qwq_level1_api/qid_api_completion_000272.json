In the original transformer, for even dimensions, it's sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d)), and cos for odd. Here, the code is using 0::2 and 1::2. So yes, that line should be cosine.\n\nThen for pe_negative's odd indices, the code already has the cosine part. Wait, looking at pe_negative's code:\n\npe_negative[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(-1 * position * div_term)\npe_negative[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(-1 * position * div_term)\n\nHmm, so the same structure. So the missing line in pe_positive's 1::2 is torch.cos(position * div_term).\n\nTherefore, the line to fill is:\n\npe_positive[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)\n\nThat's the missing code. Let me double-check. The user's code for the positive part's even indices is sine, so the odd should be cosine. That's the standard way. So that's the line."
