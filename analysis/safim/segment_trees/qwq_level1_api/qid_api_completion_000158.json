    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the missing code for the ReLU derivative in the given Python classes. Let's start by recalling what the ReLU function is. ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit, and its function is defined as the maximum of 0 and x. So, the function part is already done using np.maximum(0, x), which makes sense.\n\nNow, the derivative of ReLU is what's needed here. The ReLU derivative is 0 when x is less than 0, and 1 when x is greater than 0. But wait, at x=0, the derivative is technically undefined, but it's usually taken as 0 or 0.5 in practice. However, commonly, people just set it to 0 for simplicity. So the derivative should return 0 for x <= 0 and 1 otherwise.\n\nThe problem says to use np.where, which is a numpy function that allows conditional selection. The syntax for np.where is np.where(condition, true_value, false_value). So, applying that here: the condition would be x > 0. If true, the derivative is 1; else, 0.\n\nWait, but what about the point exactly at zero? If the condition is x >= 0, then at x=0 it would be 1. But the standard is usually to set it to 0. Let me confirm: ReLU's derivative is 0 for x < 0, 1 for x >0, and often 0 at x=0. Or sometimes it's considered non-differentiable there, but in implementation, it's common to set it to 0. So maybe the condition should be x > 0. \n\nTherefore, the code would be something like:\n\nreturn np.where(x > 0, 1, 0)\n\nWait, but the function's input is x. The derivative's parameter is x, so we can directly use x in the condition. Since the derivative is taken with respect to x. So yes, the code should be using x in the np.where.\n\nLooking back at the Tanh and Sigmoid derivatives, they use self.function(x) to get the computed value. But for ReLU, since the derivative only depends on x's sign, we don't need that. So the correct line is to use np.where with x>0 to return 1 else 0.\n\nSo the missing line is return np.where(x > 0, 1, 0). That's the derivative of ReLU using np.where as hinted."
