The task is to fill in that missing code so the program runs correctly.\n\nLooking at the code, the TODO is in the calculateMetricsPerOperation method. The line with the TODO is for the 90th percentile of service times. The existing code has comments indicating that the 50th, 95th, 99th, etc., percentiles are already handled, but the 90th is missing there. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the line with the TODO is the one that's commented as \"Calculate the 90th percentile of service times\". Let me look at the code structure here. The Metrics constructor is being called with a bunch of parameters. The line before the TODO is the 50th percentile for service times, and the line after the TODO is the 95th percentile. The TODO line is where the 90th percentile should be. But the code there has a comment indicating that's where the 90th should go, but the code is incomplete.\n\nLooking at the existing lines, for serviceTimes' percentiles: \n\n- The 50th is done with StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 50.0d) divided by the time unit conversion.\n- Then there's a comment with TODO, and the line has /* TODO: Your code here */ divided by the same time unit. The comment says it's for the 90th percentile. Then the next line is the 95th, which is correctly using 95.0d.\n\nSo the missing part is replacing the \"/* TODO: Your code here */\" part with the correct call to StatUtils.percentile for the 90th percentile of serviceTimes, similar to the other percentiles. \n\nSo the correct code there should be StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 90.0d). That's all. The existing lines for 95, 99 etc. are correct, so the TODO line must be the 90th percentile. \n\nSo replacing the TODO comment with StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 90.0d) should fix it. Let me make sure the syntax is right. The parameters for percentile are the array and the percentile value. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing line is just replacing the TODO block with the correct percentile call. The rest of the parameters after that are already correct. So that's the only change needed here."
