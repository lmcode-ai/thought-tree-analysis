Let me start by looking at the first class.\n\nThe first class is Wav2Vec2ConformerFeatureProjection. In the __init__ method, there's a comment saying to initialize LayerNorm with the last dimension of conv_dim and epsilon from config. The variables layer_norm_eps and conv_dim_last are already set. The line for self.layer_norm is missing. \n\nLooking at PyTorch's LayerNorm, the constructor takes the normalized shape. Since it's the last dimension of conv_dim, which is conv_dim_last, the shape should be (conv_dim_last,). Also, the eps is layer_norm_eps. So the code should be nn.LayerNorm(normalized_shape=(conv_dim_last,), eps=layer_norm_eps). So that's the line to fill in there.\n\nNow moving to the second class, Wav2Vec2ConformerFeedForward. The code seems mostly filled. The __init__ and forward methods have all the required parts according to the comments. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the __init__, they initialize two dropout layers, the dense layers, and the activation. The forward method applies intermediate dense, activation, dropout, then output dense and dropout. The code provided in the forward matches the comments, so maybe there's nothing missing here. Wait, the user might have intended some missing parts here, but looking at the code given, all the steps mentioned in the comments are implemented. The problem might only be the first class's LayerNorm.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. The problem is probably only the LayerNorm line in the first class. The second class's code seems complete as per the provided structure. Therefore the only missing part is the self.layer_norm assignment in the first class."
