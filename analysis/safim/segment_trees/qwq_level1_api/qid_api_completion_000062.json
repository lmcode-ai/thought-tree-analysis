    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what code goes in the TODO comment for the value2 assignment. The comment says to get a value from the cache, computing it if not present using a lambda. \n\nHmm, I remember that Caffeine's Cache has a get method that takes a key and a supplier. So when you call cache.get(key, supplier), if the key is present, it returns the existing value. If not, it uses the supplier to compute a value, stores it in the cache, and returns it.\n\nSo for the line String value2 = /* TODO */, I should use cache.get(). The key here is probably \"key2\" since key1 was already used. Wait, looking at the code, the previous lines use \"key1\", and after that, they invalidate and add \"key3\". But the value2 line is before those? Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the code structure:\n\nAfter putting \"key1\", retrieving it, then comes the value2 line. The comment says to use a lambda to compute if not present. So the key here might be a new key like \"key2\", since \"key1\" is already present. Wait, but maybe the key is \"key1\" again? But then it would just get it from the cache. But since they want a lambda for computing when not present, the key must not be present yet. Let's see. \n\nWait, the previous code has put \"key1\", then getIfPresent, so maybe for value2, they are using a different key. Let's see the line: the variable is value2, so maybe they want to get \"key2\". \n\nSo the syntax would be cache.get(\"key2\", () -> \"value2\"); \n\nWait, but the lambda should return the computed value. The supplier is a function that returns a value. So the lambda () -> \"value2\" would compute \"value2\" when the key isn't present. \n\nTherefore, the line should be:\n\nString value2 = cache.get(\"key2\", () -> \"value2\");\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is another value. Let me check the exact wording of the problem. The problem says \"Get a value from the cache, computing the value if not present using a lambda expression\". So the key isn't specified, but the variable is value2, so probably the key is \"key2\". \n\nTherefore, the missing code is cache.get(\"key2\", () -> \"value2\") \n\nWait, but the assignment is to value2. So the code would be:\n\nString value2 = cache.get(\"key2\", () -> \"value2\");\n\nThat makes sense. Let me make sure that's the correct method. The Caffeine Cache's get method with a key and a Supplier. Yes. \n\nI think that's the correct code for the TODO part."
