Let's look at the problem again.\n\nThe task is to complete the code where the comment says \"# TODO: Your code here\". The line before that is assigning the cosine and sine embeddings, and then the cached variable needs to be set. \n\nLooking at the code structure, the Rotary Positional Embedding here is supposed to compute the embeddings for the hidden states. The code so far has calculated the cosine and sine components. The problem is in the line where self.cached_rotary_positional_embedding is assigned. \n\nIn Rotary Positional Embedding, typically, the embeddings are stored as a tuple of cosine and sine values. Or maybe a tensor combining them. Let me think. The code has separated them into cos_embeddings and sin_embeddings. So the cached_rotary_positional_embedding probably needs to store both together. \n\nWait, checking the code flow: the function returns this cached value. Looking at the forward function, if the cached exists, it returns it. So the cached variable should hold both the cos and sin embeddings. So maybe the line should be something like:\n\nself.cached_rotary_positional_embedding = (cos_embeddings, sin_embeddings)\n\nBecause those are the two tensors that are computed. Then, when the function returns that, the caller would get both. Alternatively, maybe they are concatenated? But the variables are separate.\n\nLooking at how Rotary embeddings work: when applying the rotation, each position's cosine and sine are applied to the query and key vectors. So storing both as separate tensors makes sense. Therefore, the correct way is to store them as a tuple. \n\nSo, the missing line is assigning the tuple of cos and sin embeddings to the cached variable. Let me check the variables again. The code has:\n\ncos_embeddings = embeddings.cos()[:, None, None, :]\nsin_embeddings = embeddings.sin()[:, None, None, :]\n\nSo yes, those are the two tensors. Therefore, the line should be:\n\nself.cached_rotary_positional_embedding = (cos_embeddings, sin_embeddings)\n\nThat's the most logical completion here. Let me make sure that the code elsewhere expects a tuple. For instance, when the cached value is returned, the user of this class would expect to get both cosine and sine parts. Since the code before the TODO returns the cached variable, that's what needs to be stored here. \n\nI think that's the correct answer here. So that's the line to fill in the TODO."
