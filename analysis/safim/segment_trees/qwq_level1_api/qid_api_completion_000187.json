    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a Python code snippet that needs to be completed. The task is to fill in the missing parts. Let me go through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the ADF test part. The line says adf_test_result = # TODO. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is done using the statsmodels library. The function they probably want is ts.adfuller. So the data being tested is the 'TargetVariable' column, right? Because that's the time series they're analyzing. Wait, but maybe it's the entire dataset? Hmm, no, usually the ADF test is applied to the time series you're interested in, which in this case is the TargetVariable. So the code should be something like ts.adfuller(data['TargetVariable']), and store that result.\n\nWait, but the parameters for adfuller might have some defaults. Let me recall: the adfuller function takes the series, and other optional parameters like maxlag, regression, etc. But the user probably just wants the basic call here. So the line would be adf_test_result = ts.adfuller(data['TargetVariable']).\n\nLet me check the variables again. The data is loaded with index 'Date', so the TargetVariable is a column in the DataFrame. Yes. So that's the missing code for the ADF test.\n\nIs there anything else missing? Let me check the rest of the code. The next part is about feature selection using correlation. That part seems okay. Then fitting ARIMA and SARIMAX models. The SARIMAX includes exogenous variables from selected_features, which is correct based on the previous code.\n\nThe ANOVA test is applied to the SARIMAX results. Wait, the anova_lm function takes the results object, so that's probably okay as written.\n\nSo the only missing part is the ADF test line. I think that's the only TODO. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nadf_test_result = ts.adfuller(data['TargetVariable'])\n\nWait, but sometimes people might difference the series first, but the ADF test is to check stationarity, so the test is applied to the original series. The code as written is correct. Yeah, that's the missing line."
