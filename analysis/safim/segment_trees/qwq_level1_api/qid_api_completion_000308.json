    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure out what's missing here. The user provided a Python script that's supposed to handle MNLI evaluation with different models like BERT, ELECTRA, or DistilBERT. The task is to complete the missing code parts so that the program runs correctly. \n\nLooking at the code, the main function seems structured, but the problem is in the evaluate_mnli function. The comment says to get the prediction with the largest logits values. The current line has a TODO where prediction is assigned. \n\nSo, the outputs from the model are stored in 'outputs'. For sequence classification models from transformers, the outputs usually have logits as the first element. So, outputs.logits would give the raw predictions. Then, to get the predicted class, we need to find the index of the maximum logits value.\n\nWait, the code line says prediction = # TODO: Your code here.item(). Hmm, maybe the user intended to take the argmax of the logits. Let me think. The logits are a tensor, so we can apply torch.argmax on them. Since the outputs.logits is a 2D tensor (even if batch size 1), we need to specify the dimension. \n\nLet me see. The model returns logits, which for a batch of size 1 would be a tensor of size [1 x 3]. So, taking the argmax over dimension 1 (the classes) would give a tensor of size [1], then we need to get the item as an integer. \n\nSo the correct code would be something like:\n\nprediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()\n\nYes, that makes sense. The .item() converts it from a single-element tensor to a Python int. \n\nLet me check again. The evaluate_mnli function's returns a string from the labels list, which has 3 elements. The logits should have 3 classes, so the argmax over dim 1 (since each row is a sample) would be correct. \n\nAre there any other missing parts? The prepare_input function returns the tokenized inputs as a dictionary with tensors, which is correct because the model expects that when using **tokenized_input. \n\nAnother thing: in the main function, after getting prediction, it's passed to labels[prediction], which should work if prediction is an integer index. \n\nTherefore, the only missing part is in evaluate_mnli where prediction is assigned. So the correct line is:\n\nprediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()\n\nThat's the line that needs to be filled in. Let me make sure there's no other missing code. The rest of the functions look complete. The load_model_and_tokenizer correctly initializes the models and tokenizers based on the model_type. The prepare_input uses encode_plus with the right parameters. \n\nYes, so the only TODO is replacing that line. The user's instruction says to output only the missing code. So the answer is just that line."
