The code should plot the x and y coordinates from transformed_vectors. The line would be something like plt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:,0], transformed_vectors[:,1]). Then the annotations are added on top. That makes sense. Let me check the code again. The user's code after transformed_vectors is:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\n# TODO: Your code here\nfor i, word in enumerate(vocab):\n    plt.annotate(word, xy=(transformed_vectors[i, 0], transformed_vectors[i, 1]))\nplt.title(...)\nplt.show()\n\nSo inserting the scatter plot line after the figure is created but before the loop. That's the missing part. The scatter plot is needed to actually show the points. The annotations will label them. So the correct code to add is plt.scatter(transformed_vectors[:, 0], transformed_vectors[:, 1]). The colon in slicing is correct because transformed_vectors is a 2D array. So yes, that's the line they need. I'll make sure there's no other missing code. The rest of the code seems okay. The other parts like NER are already completed. So the only missing part is the scatter plot line."
