    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see what the problem is here. The user provided a Python code with some missing parts that I need to fill in. The task is to complete the code so that it runs correctly. The instructions say to output only the missing code, not the entire program, and as plain text. Alright, let me look at the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the function load_model_and_tokenizer has an elif block for 'distilbert'. In that block, the model is assigned using DistilBertForSequenceClassification, but the tokenizer line is a TODO. The line says tokenizer = # TODO: Your code here. So I need to figure out what the correct tokenizer instantiation is here.\n\nLooking at the imports, there's a DistilBertTokenizer imported from transformers. So for DistilBert, the tokenizer should be created using DistilBertTokenizer. The model_name for distilbert is \"distilbert-base-uncased\", as per the model_names dictionary. So the line should be similar to the others. For example, in the Bert case, they use BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name). So for DistilBert, it should be DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name). Therefore, the missing line is tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name).\n\nNext, check the prepare_input function. The comments say to tokenize the input pair, return PyTorch tensors, using padding and truncation. The current code uses encode_plus with premise and hypothesis, and the parameters return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True, truncation=True. That seems correct. Wait, but maybe the truncation and padding need to be set to 'max_length' or something? Or maybe the code is okay as is. Since encode_plus can handle padding and truncation with those parameters, perhaps that part is already correct and there's no missing code here. The problem mentions missing lines or blocks, but maybe the only missing part is the tokenizer line in the load_model function.\n\nThen, the evaluate_mnli function. The code gets the outputs from the model, then uses argmax on the logits. The labels are in order entailment (0), neutral (1), contradiction (2). That should be correct as per MNLI's standard labeling. So no missing code here either.\n\nThe main function and the rest seem to be in order. The only missing part is indeed the tokenizer for DistilBert in the load_model_and_tokenizer function. So the answer should just fill in that line.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The user's code shows that in the 'distilbert' case, the model is set correctly, but the tokenizer line is a TODO. So the correct code for that line is:\n\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nYes. That's the only missing part. So the answer should be that line."
