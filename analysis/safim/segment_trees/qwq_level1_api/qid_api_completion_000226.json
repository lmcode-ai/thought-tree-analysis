    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's look at the code provided and see what's missing. The user wants me to fill in the TODO part where they're visualizing feature importance. \n\nThe code so far sets up an XGBoost classifier, fits it, makes predictions, calculates accuracy, and then starts plotting feature importance. The features are ['points', 'assists', 'rebounds'], and they have a bar plot with those on the x-axis and the feature importances from the model. \n\nThe TODO is right after plotting the bars. The next steps would be to add labels and a title, but looking at the existing code, they already set the ylabel and title. Wait, let me check again. The code has plt.ylabel('Importance') and plt.title('Feature Importance'), so those are done. But maybe the x-axis label is missing? The x-axis doesn't have a label here. The features are on the x-axis, so perhaps plt.xlabel('Features') is needed. That's probably the missing part. \n\nAlso, maybe the bars are not labeled properly, but since the code uses plt.bar(features, ...), the x-axis ticks should already have the feature names. So adding the x-label would be the main thing here. Let me see the original code again. The user's code after the TODO comment has the ylabel and title lines, but the xlabel is missing. So the TODO must be to add plt.xlabel('Feature') or 'Features'. \n\nYes, that's the gap. The code is incomplete because the x-axis label is missing. So the missing line is plt.xlabel('Feature') or plural. Looking at the code's existing lines, they used 'Importance' for y, so probably 'Features' as the x-label. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be plt.xlabel('Features') followed by perhaps rotating the labels if needed, but the problem might just require the x-label. Since the user's instructions say to output only the missing code, that line is the key here. Let me make sure there's nothing else. The code after the TODO has the plt.show() already. So the missing line is the xlabel."
