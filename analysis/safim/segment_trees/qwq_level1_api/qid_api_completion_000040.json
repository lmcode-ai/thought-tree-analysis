For the TODO part, since they want a distribution of doubles between 0 and 1, I think we need to use boost::uniform_real<> here. \n\nThe existing code after the TODO has a line that says:\n\nboost::variate_generator<base_generator_type&, boost::uniform_real<> > uni(generator, uni_dist);\n\nWait, there's a problem here.

Since the desired range is [0, 1), passing 0.0 and 1.0 makes sense. \n\nLet me check the Boost.Random documentation. The uniform_real constructor takes the a and b parameters, which are the lower and upper bounds. So yes, 0.0 and 1.0. \n\nTherefore, the code between the TODO comments should declare the distribution:\n\nboost::uniform_real<> uni_dist(0.0, 1.0);\n\nThat's all. The next line binds this distribution with the generator into the variate_generator. \n\nLet me double-check the existing code. The variate_generator is of type <base_generator_type&, boost::uniform_real<>>, and the constructor uses generator and uni_dist. Since uni_dist is now properly declared, that should work. \n\nI don't see any other missing parts here. The rest of the code seems okay. So the only missing line is the declaration of uni_dist with the uniform_real distribution between 0 and 1."
