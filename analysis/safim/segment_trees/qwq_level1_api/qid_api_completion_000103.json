The code is part of the calculateMetricsPerOperation method. They're creating a Metrics object here. The parameters for the Metrics constructor are being filled in. Looking at the lines above and below the TODO, I can see that the 50th percentile for latency is already there, then the TODO line is for the 90th percentile. \n\nThe pattern for the serviceTime percentiles is using StatUtils.percentile with the appropriate percentile value. For example, for the 90th percentile of service times, it's StatUtils.percentile(serviceTimes, 90.0d). So the same should apply for latencies. \n\nThe line with the TODO has a comment indicating it's for the 90th percentile of latencies. The existing code for the 50th is StatUtils.percentile(latencies, 50.0d), so replacing that with 90.0d should do it. \n\nWait, let me check the exact placement. The code that's commented out has a line: \n\n/* TODO: Your code here */ / TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(1L),  // Calculate the 90th percentile of latencies\n\nLooking at the surrounding lines, the 90th percentile is missing here. The lines after that have 95th, 99th etc., which are correctly filled. So the missing part is replacing the TODO comment with the correct percentile call for 90.0d.\n\nTherefore, the correct code should be StatUtils.percentile(latencies, 90.0d). That will replace the TODO part. The division by TimeUnit... is already there, so just inserting the percentile calculation there.\n\nI need to make sure that the parameters for the Metrics constructor are in the right order. But the user's instruction is just to fill in the missing line. So replacing the TODO line with the correct percentile call.\n\nSo the missing code is: StatUtils.percentile(latencies, 90.0d)"
