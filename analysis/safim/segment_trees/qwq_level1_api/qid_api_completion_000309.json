    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete the Python code provided. The task is to fill in the missing parts so that the program runs correctly. The user wants only the missing code, not the whole program or any explanations. \n\nLooking at the code, the first part is the load_model_and_tokenizer function. It seems to be setting up different models based on the model_type. The model names are stored in a dictionary. Then, depending on the model type, they load the corresponding model and tokenizer from transformers. That part looks done except maybe checking if the model_type is valid. Wait, the code already has a raise ValueError for else case, so that's covered.\n\nThen the prepare_input function. The comment says to tokenize the premise and hypothesis, return PyTorch tensors with padding and truncation. The code uses tokenizer.encode_plus with those parameters. That should be correct. The return is inputs, which is the result of encode_plus. So that's done.\n\nNow the evaluate_mnli function. The problem is in the line where prediction is assigned. The outputs from the model are the logits. The user wants the index of the maximum logit. The outputs.logits would be a tensor, so taking argmax(dim=1) would give the index. Since the outputs are batched (because return_tensors=\"pt\" in prepare_input), even if it's one sample, it's a 1D tensor of size 1. So maybe:\n\nprediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()\n\nWait, the function returns the index, which then maps to the labels list. Let me check: the outputs.logits is a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_labels). Since we have a single input, batch_size is 1. So argmax along dim 1 gives the index of the highest logit for that sample. Then, to get the integer, we use .item().\n\nSo the line where prediction is assigned should be:\n\nprediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()\n\nAlternatively, maybe just .numpy() and then [0], but item() is better here. So that line is the missing code.\n\nLet me double-check. The function's return is labels[prediction], so prediction must be an integer index. The code in evaluate_mnli needs to compute that. The outputs from the model's forward pass (since it's a SequenceClassification model) should return a tuple where the first element is the logits. So outputs.logits is correct.\n\nYes, the missing line is:\n\nprediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()\n\nSo that's the code to fill in."
