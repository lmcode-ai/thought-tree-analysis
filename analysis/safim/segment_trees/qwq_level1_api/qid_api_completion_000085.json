The user provided a Java code snippet using Joda-Time and needs me to fill in the missing part for the DateTimeFormatter.\n\nThe comment says to format as \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\". So I need to create a formatter with that pattern. The Joda-Time way is to use DateTimeFormat.forPattern. Wait, or is it DateTimeFormatter.parsePattern? No, I think the correct method is DateTimeFormat.forPattern(String pattern). Then, the formatter variable should be assigned by calling that method with the desired format string.\n\nWait, let me recall: the DateTimeFormatter class has a forPattern method? Or is it the DateTimeFormat class? Oh right, the static method is in DateTimeFormat. So the code would be:\n\nDateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\n\nYes, that's right. So the missing line is that assignment. The TODO comment is right there. So that's the only part needed here. Let me double-check the format string. The user wants \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\", which includes date and time parts. The pattern letters for Joda-Time should match that. Y for year, M for month, d for day, H for hour (24-hour), m for minutes, s for seconds. So the pattern is correct.\n\nSo the answer is just that single line of code. I need to output only that line as plain text, nothing else. The user specified not to include code delimiters like triple backticks. So I'll just write the line."
