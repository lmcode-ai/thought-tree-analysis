    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what code is missing in the given Python script. Let's look at the functions one by one.\n\nFirst, the load_model_and_tokenizer function seems complete. It initializes the model and tokenizer with the correct names and loads them using from_pretrained. So nothing to do there.\n\nNext is the prepare_input function. The docstring says it tokenizes the input text using the tokenizer. The parameters are tokenizer and text. The return is a torch.Tensor. \n\nLooking at the code inside, the line with the TODO is where the inputs should be generated. The comments mention using padding, truncation, and returning PyTorch tensors. \n\nThe DistilBertTokenizer's method to do this is probably tokenizer.encode_plus. The parameters for that method would include the text, padding='max_length' or True, truncation=True, and return_tensors='pt' to get PyTorch tensors. Wait, but maybe 'max_length' is needed? The problem might just expect the basic approach. Let me recall: encode_plus takes the text, and when you set padding and truncation, it automatically handles those. So the code should be something like:\n\ninputs = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\nBut wait, the function is supposed to return a torch.Tensor. The return_tensors='pt' does that. So that's probably the line to fill in. Let me check the parameters again. The function's return is a torch.Tensor. The encode_plus returns a dict with input_ids and attention_mask, which are tensors. But the predict_sentiment function later uses **tokenized_input, which would unpack the dict. So the prepare_input should return that dictionary. Therefore, yes, the correct line is using encode_plus with those parameters. \n\nSo the missing line is:\n\ninputs = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\nLet me see if there are other possible parameters. Maybe max_length is needed? But the problem's instructions don't specify, so perhaps it's okay to leave as default. The exercise might just want the basic call with padding, truncation, and return_tensors.\n\nNow, the predict_sentiment function. The code there looks okay. It uses torch.no_grad() to disable gradients, gets the outputs, then uses argmax to find the class with highest probability. Returns 'positive' or 'negative' based on 1 or 0, which aligns with the comment. So that's fine.\n\nThe main function seems to call everything correctly. \n\nSo the only missing part is the prepare_input function's inputs assignment. Therefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is the line I wrote above."
