  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Python code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp turns one into R and the other into B. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects exactly two adjacent cells. Also, the stamp can be rotated, so the pair can be either RB or BR.\n\nHmm, the key here is to find out the conditions under which the given string is possible. Let's think about the constraints. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So any non-white cells must be part of such pairs. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, maybe the order matters, but perhaps there's a pattern we can check.\n\nWait, the initial state is all white. Each stamp changes two cells. So every time you stamp, you're setting two cells to R and B in some order. But since you can stamp multiple times on the same cells, maybe overlapping stamps can reverse previous changes. However, the problem is to reach the target string, so perhaps the key is to look at the target and see if it can be built through these operations.\n\nLet me think of the possible cases. For any non-W character in the string, they must be part of some pair. But since each stamp adds exactly one R and one B, the total number of R and B must be equal? Wait, no. Because each stamp adds one R and one B. But if you stamp the same pair again, you can flip their colors. For example, if a pair was RB, stamping again would turn them into BR, but that's equivalent to swapping. Wait, actually, each stamp on the same pair would toggle their colors. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose a cell is R and B. If you stamp again on those two, then each would flip. Because the stamp can be either way. Wait, maybe each stamp on the same pair can flip their colors. So the total count of R and B can vary, but perhaps their difference must be even? Or maybe not. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that any non-W segment must have a certain property. Let's see the examples given. The first example's target is BRB BW. Wait, the example's final string is B R B B W. Wait, how did that happen? The steps involved applying the stamp in different positions. But the important thing is that each non-W part must be formed by overlapping pairs of R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical observation is that in the final string, any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells, so any two adjacent non-W cells must have been part of a stamp's application. Wait, not exactly. Because a stamp can be applied multiple times. For example, if you have a pair that was stamped once as RB, then stamped again as BR, the net effect would be that they are back to white? No, because each stamp changes both. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each time you stamp, you set the two cells to either RB or BR. So each application overwrites the current colors of those two cells. So overlapping stamps can overwrite previous colors. \n\nHmm, maybe the key is that in the final string, every non-W cell must be part of at least one pair (with a neighbor) that is either RB or BR. But how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B, such that each non-W cell is part of at least one such pair. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the constraints on the string s. Let's consider the sequence of non-W characters. Because whenever you stamp, you set two adjacent cells to R and B. So any non-W segment must have a certain structure. Let me think of the string without the W's. Wait, but W's can be in between. Hmm, perhaps the W's are irrelevant except that they can be part of the stamp's application. Wait, no. The stamp can be applied on any two adjacent cells, even if they are white. But the stamp changes them to R and B. So the presence of W's in the final string means that those cells were never stamped, or were stamped an even number of times (since each stamp changes their color). Wait, no. Because each stamp on a cell changes its color. For example, if a cell is white, and you stamp it (as part of a pair), it becomes either R or B. If you stamp it again (as part of another pair), it would be changed again. So to end up as white, the cell must have been stamped an even number of times. But since the initial color is white, each stamp on that cell toggles its color. So for a cell to be white in the end, it must have been stamped an even number of times (including zero). \n\nBut this complicates things. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think of the problem differently. Let's consider the final string. For it to be possible, the non-W parts must form a sequence where every R and B is part of a pair. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the final string, any occurrence of a non-W character must be adjacent to another non-W character, except possibly at the ends. Wait, no. For example, the fifth test case in the note is \"BRB\", which is possible. Let me see the example given in the note: the fifth test case's example is \"W R B B\" (maybe not exactly, but the example shows that a sequence like BRB can be formed). Wait, perhaps the key is that all non-W characters must form a sequence where every R and B is part of a pair. So, the entire non-W parts must form a sequence where each R or B is adjacent to another of the opposite color. Except maybe the first and last elements?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have two identical non-W colors adjacent to each other. Because each stamp creates a pair of R and B. Wait, but if you have two adjacent R and B, that's okay. But if you have two R's next to each other, that would be a problem. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. So two R's next to each other would require that they were part of overlapping stamps. Let me think: suppose two adjacent cells are both R. How could that happen?\n\nSuppose the first cell was part of a stamp as R (with the second cell as B), and then the second cell was part of another stamp as R (with the third cell as B). Then the second cell would have been set to B first, then to R again. So the second cell would be R. So the first and second cells would be R and R? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nFirst stamp on positions 1-2: set to R and B. So cells 1 is R, 2 is B.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 2-3: suppose we choose to set them to R and B. Then cell 2 becomes R, cell 3 becomes B. So now cells 1 is R, 2 is R, 3 is B. So two R's adjacent. So that's possible. So the presence of two R's next to each other is allowed. Hmm, so that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe the problem is more complex. Let me think of the constraints again. Let's consider the entire string. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. So every time you apply a stamp, you are creating a pair of R and B. But overlapping stamps can change previous pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every non-W cell must be part of at least one such pair. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have any two identical non-W colors in a row. Wait, but the example given in the problem's first case has the final string as B R B B W. Wait, the fourth and fifth characters are B and W. The third and fourth are B and B. So two B's in a row. So that's allowed. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that all non-W segments must have even length? Or some parity condition?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the transitions between colors. Let's look at the sequence of non-W characters. Let's consider the string s, and ignore the W's. Wait, but W's can be in between. Hmm, perhaps the W's are irrelevant except that they can't be part of any non-W segments. Wait, no. Because a W in the middle would split the non-W parts into separate segments. For example, if the string is BRWBR, then the two BR segments are separate. Each must be formed by their own stamps. \n\nWait, but each stamp must be applied on two adjacent cells. So any non-W segment must be formed by a sequence of overlapping stamps. But if there's a W in between, then those segments are separate. So each non-W segment (a maximal sequence of non-W characters) must satisfy some condition.\n\nAh! That's probably the key. Let's think of each maximal non-W segment. Each such segment must be possible to form via the stamping process. So the problem reduces to checking each such segment individually. Because the W's between them can be left as white, since they were never stamped (or stamped even times, but that's complicated). Wait, but the W's between can be part of a stamp's application. For example, a stamp could be applied on a W and a non-W cell, turning them into R and B. But that would affect the W, making it non-W. So the presence of a W between two non-W segments implies that those segments are truly separate, because otherwise there would be a non-W in between.\n\nTherefore, each maximal non-W segment must be a valid sequence that can be formed by the stamping process. So the problem reduces to checking each such segment.\n\nNow, the question is: what conditions must a maximal non-W segment satisfy to be formable?\n\nLet me think of a maximal non-W segment. Let's call it s. The length must be at least 1. But since each stamp affects two cells, how can a single cell be formed? Well, it can't. Because each stamp must cover two cells. So any maximal non-W segment of length 1 is impossible. So that's one condition: all maximal non-W segments must have length at least 2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem's note says that for test cases 2,3,4, it's not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is NO. So if the input has a single non-W character, then it's impossible. So that's a condition: all maximal non-W segments must have even length? Or at least length 2?\n\nWait, the problem's note says that for the second, third, and fourth test cases, it's not possible. So for example, if the input is \"R\", then it's impossible. So any maximal non-W segment of length 1 is invalid. So first condition: all maximal non-W segments must have length >=2.\n\nWait, but what about a segment of length 3? Let's see. Let's say the segment is RBR. Can that be formed?\n\nLet me think. Let's see:\n\nStart with WWW. Suppose the segment is of length 3. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the target is RBR. Let's see:\n\nFirst, stamp positions 1-2 as R and B. So the first two are RB. Then stamp positions 2-3 as R and B. So the second and third become R and B. So the sequence would be R (from first stamp's first cell), then R (from second stamp's first cell), then B (from second stamp's second cell). So the result is R R B. Not RBR. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp 1-2 as R and B (RB). Then stamp 1-2 again as BR. So first cell becomes B, second R. Then stamp 2-3 as B and R. So the second and third become B and R. So the sequence would be B (from first stamp's second application), then B (from second stamp's first cell?), wait maybe I'm getting confused. Let me track step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible. Let me think of RBR:\n\nSuppose the first stamp is on positions 1-2 as R and B (RB). Then the third cell is still W. Then stamp positions 2-3 as B and R (so the second becomes B and third R). So after first stamp: R B W. After second stamp on 2-3 as B R: the second becomes B (overwritten from B to B?), third becomes R. So the sequence is R B R. That's exactly RBR. So yes, a segment of length 3 is possible. So the length can be odd. So the length doesn't have to be even. So that's not the condition.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition for a segment of non-W characters?\n\nLet me think of the possible sequences. Each stamp adds a pair of R and B. But overlapping stamps can create longer sequences. Let's think of the entire segment as being built by overlapping pairs. Each pair must be either RB or BR. But when they overlap, the overlapping cell must be part of both pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire sequence must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp adds a pair of R and B, so overlapping pairs would require that adjacent elements alternate. For example, if you have a sequence like R B R, that's possible. Because the first two are R B (from a stamp), and the next two (positions 2-3) could be B R (another stamp). So the overlapping at position 2 would have to be B (from first stamp) and then B again? Wait, no. Wait, the second stamp on positions 2-3 would set them to either BR or RB. Let me see:\n\nFirst stamp on 1-2: R B. Then stamp on 2-3 as B R (so the second and third become B and R). So the second cell was B from the first stamp, and then set to B again (so no change?), and third becomes R. So the result is R B R. So the sequence is R B R. So the colors alternate. So the sequence must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, in this case, the sequence R B R alternates. So perhaps the condition is that the entire non-W segment must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp adds a pair of R and B, so overlapping pairs must alternate. \n\nLet me test this idea. Let's see:\n\nIf a segment is R B R B, that's alternating. So possible. \n\nIf a segment is R R B, then the first two R's are same, so that's invalid. So that can't be formed. \n\nAnother example: the first test case's final string is B R B B W. The non-W part before the W is B R B B. The segment B R B B has the last two B's. So that's two B's in a row. So according to the idea, that would be invalid. But the example says it is possible. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait the example's final string is B R B B W. Let me see how that was formed. The steps given were:\n\nStart with WWWWW.\n\nFirst stamp on positions 4-5 (assuming 1-based?), making them RB. So the string becomes WWW RB W.\n\nThen stamp on positions 1-2 as BR (so first two become B and R). So now B R R B W. Wait, no, the second step's stamp is on 1-2 as BR (B first?), so first cell B, second R. So after first step: positions 4-5 are RB. Then after second step, positions 1-2 are BR. So the string is B R R B W. Then the third step is stamp on positions 2-3 as RB. So positions 2 and 3 become R and B. So the string becomes B (from first), then R (position 2 was R, now R?), wait no. Wait, the third step is stamp on positions 2-3. Let me track:\n\nAfter second step, the string is B R R B W. \n\nThird step: stamp on positions 2-3. Let's choose to set them to R and B. So position 2 becomes R (overwriting the existing R?), and position 3 becomes B. So the string becomes B R (position 2) and B (position3), so the third character is B. So the string after third step is B R B B W. Which matches the example. \n\nSo the segment B R B B has the last two B's. So according to the previous idea, that would violate the alternation. But in this case, it's allowed. So the alternation idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's the problem here? Let's look at the segment B R B B. The last two B's are consecutive. How did that happen?\n\nLooking at the steps, the third stamp was applied on positions 2-3, which turned them into R and B? Or maybe I made a mistake in the example's steps. Let me re-examine the example's explanation:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: W W W W W\n\nFirst stamp on positions 4-5 (assuming 1-based) as RB (so positions 4 is R, 5 is B). So the string becomes W W W R B W? Wait, no, the fifth character is the fifth position. So after first step, the string is W W W R B.\n\nSecond step: stamp on positions 1-2 as BR (so first is B, second R). So the string becomes B R W R B.\n\nWait, the third character is still W. Then third step is stamp on positions 2-3 (the R and W). So they become either RB or BR. Let's say they choose BR (so position 2 becomes B, position3 becomes R). Then the string becomes B (position1), B (position2), R (position3), R (position4), B (position5). So the third character is R, fourth is R. So the segment would be B B R R B. Hmm, but the example's final string is B R B B W. Maybe I'm getting confused with the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the third step was applied on positions 3-4. Let me see the example's description again:\n\nThe example's third step is \"stamp as BR\" on positions 3-4. Let me see:\n\nAfter the second step, the string is B R R B W (assuming the third character was W before? Maybe I need to recheck the example's steps. The example's explanation says:\n\nThe first step leads to W W (then RB) W \u2192 so positions 4-5 are RB. Then the second step is stamp on 1-2 as BR, so first two are BR. So the string after second step is B R followed by W (position3), R (position4), B (position5). So the third character is W. \n\nThen the third step is stamp on positions 2-3 (R and W). So they become either RB or BR. Let's say they choose RB. So position2 becomes R (overwritten?), position3 becomes B. So the string becomes B (position1), R (position2?), no, wait: the stamp on positions 2-3 (R and W) would turn them into R and B. So position2 was R, now becomes R again? So the second character remains R, third becomes B. So the string after third step is B R B R B? Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nOriginal after second step: positions 1-5 are B R W R B.\n\nStamp on positions 2-3 (R and W). The stamp can choose to set them to RB or BR. Let's choose RB. So position2 becomes R (same as before?), and position3 becomes B. So the new string is B (1), R (2), B (3), R (4), B (5). So the segment is B R B R B. But the example's final string is B R B B W. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. Alternatively, perhaps the third step was applied on positions 3-4 (W and R). Let's see:\n\nStamp on positions 3-4 (W and R). Choosing BR would set them to B and R. So position3 becomes B, position4 becomes R. So the string becomes B R B R B. Still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step was applied on positions 3-4 as BR. So the third character (W) becomes B, and fourth (R) becomes R? No, the stamp would set them to B and R. So the fourth would be R. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W. Let me see how that could happen. Maybe the third step was applied on positions 3-4 as BR. So the third character (W) becomes B, and fourth (R) becomes R? No, the fourth would be R. Wait, the fourth was R before. So if the stamp is applied on positions 3-4 (W and R), and the stamp is set to BR (B and R), then the third becomes B, fourth becomes R. So the fourth remains R. So the fourth character is still R. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Maybe the example's final string is B R B B W. Let me see the steps again as described in the problem:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp on 4-5 as RB \u2192 WWWRB.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 BR followed by W R B \u2192 so B R W R B.\n\nThird stamp on positions 2-3 (the R and W) as RB \u2192 so positions 2 and 3 become R and B. So the string becomes B (position1), R (position2?), no, wait: the stamp on 2-3 (R and W) as RB would set them to R and B. So position2 is R (unchanged?), position3 becomes B. So the string is B R B R B. But the example's final string is B R B B W. So perhaps I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step was applied on positions 3-4 (W and R) as BR. So the third becomes B, fourth becomes R. So the string after third step is B R B R B. But the example's final string is B R B B W. Hmm, perhaps the example's explanation has a typo, but regardless, the key point is that the final string has two B's in a row, and it's considered valid. So the previous idea that the sequence must alternate is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition?\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider that each stamp can be applied anywhere, and each application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The final string must be achievable through any number of such operations. \n\nLet me think of the entire string. The key is that every non-W cell must be part of at least one pair (with a neighbor) that is either RB or BR. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence of non-W characters must form a sequence where every pair of adjacent characters is either RB or BR. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells, so overlapping stamps can create longer sequences, but each adjacent pair must have been part of a stamp. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells, so every pair of adjacent non-W cells must have been part of a stamp's application. Therefore, every adjacent pair must be either RB or BR. \n\nAh! That's the key. Because if two adjacent non-W cells are, say, RR, then there's no way to have a stamp that would create that. Because any stamp on those two would set them to RB or BR. So the only way they could be RR is if they were part of overlapping stamps that somehow set them both to R. But that's impossible. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose two adjacent cells are R and R. How could that happen?\n\nSuppose first, the first cell was part of a stamp with the second as R and B (so first is R, second B). Then, a stamp on the second and third cells (assuming third exists) as B and R. So the second cell becomes B (from first stamp) then B again (no change?), and third becomes R. So the second cell remains B. So the first and second are R and B. Not RR. \n\nAlternatively, suppose the first two cells were stamped as BR (B and R). Then, a stamp on the first and second again as BR. That would set them to B and R again. So no change. So they remain BR. \n\nAlternatively, is there any way to get two R's adjacent?\n\nSuppose first stamp on positions 1-2 as RB (R and B). Then, a stamp on positions 1-2 as BR (B and R). So the first becomes B, second R. So they are BR. Not RR. \n\nHmm, so it's impossible to have two R's adjacent. Because any stamp on those two cells would set them to either RB or BR. So the only way two adjacent non-W cells can exist is if they form either RB or BR. \n\nTherefore, the condition is that in the entire string, every pair of adjacent non-W characters must be either RB or BR. Additionally, any maximal non-W segment must have length at least 1, but since each stamp requires two cells, the segments must have length at least 2? Wait, no. Wait, a single non-W character can't exist. Because to have a single non-W character, it must be part of a stamp, but that would require the adjacent cell to also be non-W. So any maximal non-W segment must have length at least 2. \n\nWait, but what about a segment of length 1? Like \"R\" in the string. That's impossible, so the first condition is that all maximal non-W segments have length >=2. \n\nSecond condition: in each maximal non-W segment, every pair of adjacent characters must be either RB or BR. \n\nSo combining these two conditions, the problem reduces to checking for each maximal non-W segment:\n\n1. Its length is at least 2.\n\n2. Every adjacent pair in the segment is either RB or BR.\n\nIf both conditions are met for all segments, then output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the example given in the problem's first case. The final string is B R B B W. The non-W segment is B R B B. Let's check the pairs:\n\nB and R \u2192 okay (BR or RB? B followed by R is BR, which is allowed.\n\nR and B \u2192 RB, which is allowed.\n\nB and B \u2192 BB, which is not allowed. So according to this condition, the example would be invalid. But the example says it is valid. So there's a problem here. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait, the example's final string is B R B B W. The segment B R B B has the last two B's. So according to the condition, this would be invalid. But the example says it is possible. So my conditions are incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nLooking back at the example's steps:\n\nThe final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. So their adjacent pair is BB, which is not allowed. But according to the problem's example, this is a valid case. So my previous reasoning must be wrong. \n\nSo why is that possible?\n\nLet me think of how the B B could be formed. Let's see the steps in the example:\n\nThe third step in the example's explanation is:\n\nAfter the second step, the string is B R R B W. Then the third step is stamping on positions 2-3 (R and R?), but wait, the second step's result was B R W R B? Or maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third step was applied on positions 3-4 (W and R). Let me see:\n\nSuppose after the second step, the string is B R W R B. \n\nThen, the third step is stamping on positions 3-4 (W and R). Choosing to set them to B and R (BR). So the third becomes B, fourth becomes R. So the string becomes B R B R B. So the third and fourth are B and R. So the final string would be B R B R B, which doesn't have two B's. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. Alternatively, maybe the example's final string is different. Let me recheck the problem's example description:\n\nThe example says the final picture is B R B B W. The steps are:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp on 4-5 as RB \u2192 WWWRB.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 BR followed by W R B \u2192 so B R W R B.\n\nThird stamp on positions 2-3 (R and W) as RB \u2192 so positions 2 and 3 become R and B. So the string becomes B (position1), R (position2), B (position3), R (position4), B (position5). So the third and fourth are B and R. So the final string is B R B R B. But the example says the final is B R B B W. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the example's explanation. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the third step was applied on positions 3-4 (W and R) as BR. So the third becomes B, fourth becomes R. So the fourth is R. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step was applied on positions 3-4 (W and R) as RB. So the third becomes R, fourth becomes B. So the string becomes B R R B B. Then the third and fourth are R and B. So the final string would be B R R B B. But that has two R's adjacent. Which would be invalid. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think of the problem differently. Let's think of the conditions again. \n\nThe key is that every non-W cell must be part of at least one pair (with a neighbor) that is either RB or BR. But overlapping pairs can allow for some flexibility. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire non-W segment must form a sequence where every pair of adjacent characters is either RB or BR. Because each pair must have been part of a stamp. So the entire segment must be a sequence of alternating R and B. \n\nWait, in the example's final string (assuming it's B R B B W), the last two B's are adjacent. So that would violate the condition. But the example says it's possible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is different. Let me recheck the problem's example description:\n\nThe problem says: \"one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W\". So the final string is B R B B W. \n\nHmm, so the third and fourth characters are B and B. So their adjacent pair is BB, which is not allowed. So according to my previous logic, this should be impossible, but the example says it is possible. So my logic is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition here?\n\nLet me think of how the BB could be formed. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the third and fourth cells are both B. How could that happen?\n\nLet me try to construct such a scenario. Let's say the target is B R B B. \n\nLet me try to find a sequence of stamps that can create this.\n\nStart with W W W W.\n\nFirst, stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nSecond, stamp positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 B R R B.\n\nThird, stamp positions 2-3 (R and R) \u2192 but that's two R's. To stamp them, you have to set them to either RB or BR. Let's choose BR. So position2 becomes B, position3 becomes R. So the string becomes B B R B. \n\nNow, the third and fourth are R and B. \n\nHmm, not getting the desired B B. \n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach. \n\nFirst stamp on positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 W R B W.\n\nSecond stamp on positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R B W.\n\nThird stamp on positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R B B. \n\nAh! Here we go. \n\nLet me walk through this:\n\nInitial: W W W W.\n\nFirst stamp on 2-3 as RB \u2192 positions 2 is R, 3 is B. So the string is W R B W.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R B W. \n\nThird stamp on 3-4 as BR \u2192 positions 3 and 4 become B and R. So the third was B, now becomes B (no change?), and fourth becomes R. So the string becomes B R B R. Not B B. \n\nHmm, no. \n\nWait, third stamp on positions 3-4 (B and W). Choosing to set them to BR (B and R). So position3 becomes B (unchanged?), position4 becomes R. So the string is B R B R. \n\nHmm, not getting the B B. \n\nAlternatively, third stamp on positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 so B and W become R and B. So position3 becomes R, position4 becomes B. So the string is B R R B. \n\nHmm, that has two R's. \n\nHmm, maybe another approach. \n\nLet me try to get B R B B:\n\nStart with W W W W.\n\nStamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nStamp 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R W B.\n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 B (position1), then R and W become R and B \u2192 so position2 becomes R, position3 becomes B. So the string becomes B R B B. \n\nAh! There we go. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Stamp 1-2 \u2192 B R W W.\n\n2. Stamp 3-4 \u2192 B R W B.\n\n3. Stamp 2-3 (R and W) \u2192 set to RB \u2192 R and B. So position2 becomes R (no change?), position3 becomes B. So the string after step3 is B R B B. \n\nYes! So the third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nSo the adjacent pair between positions 3 and 4 is B and B. But how did that happen? \n\nWait, after step2, the fourth character is B. Then step3 doesn't affect the fourth character. So the fourth remains B. So the third character after step3 is B (from step3's stamp on 2-3), and the fourth is B (from step2). So the third and fourth are B and B. \n\nSo their adjacent pair is BB, which is not allowed by the previous condition. But the example says this is possible. So my previous condition is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition here?\n\nIn this case, the third and fourth are B and B. But how did that happen? The fourth was set in step2 to B, and not changed in step3. So the fourth is B. The third was set in step3 to B. So the pair between third and fourth is BB. \n\nBut according to the problem's example, this is allowed. So the previous condition that every adjacent pair must be RB or BR is incorrect. \n\nSo what's the correct condition?\n\nLet me think of the entire sequence of non-W characters. In the example's case, the sequence is B R B B. \n\nThe first pair is B R \u2192 allowed.\n\nThe second pair is R B \u2192 allowed.\n\nThe third pair is B B \u2192 not allowed. \n\nBut the example says it's possible. So the condition must allow for some cases where adjacent pairs are not RB or BR. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct approach here?\n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire sequence can be formed by overlapping pairs of RB or BR, but not necessarily every adjacent pair in the final string must be such. \n\nWait, but how can that be? Each stamp affects two cells, so every non-W cell must be part of at least one such pair. But overlapping pairs can allow for some flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nWait, in the example's case B R B B:\n\nThe pairs could be (B R), (R B), (B B). But the last pair is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, the pairs could be (B R), (R B), (B B) \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. \n\nHmm, so that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must be such that it can be covered by a set of overlapping pairs, each of which is RB or BR. \n\nFor example, in the case of B R B B:\n\nThe pairs could be (B R), (R B), (B B) \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, the pairs could be (B R), (R B), (B B) \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, perhaps the sequence can be covered by overlapping pairs, but not necessarily every adjacent pair. \n\nWait, the first three characters B R B can be covered by the pairs (B R) and (R B). The last two B's can be covered by a pair (B B) which is not allowed. So that's not possible. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nPerhaps I need to think of the problem in terms of the parity of the number of R and B in each segment. \n\nEach stamp adds one R and one B. So the total number of R and B in the entire string must be equal. \n\nWait, that's an important point! Because each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. So the total number of R and B in the final string must be equal. \n\nAh! That's a crucial condition. \n\nSo the first condition is that the total number of R and B in the entire string must be equal. \n\nIn the example's case, the string is B R B B W. The R count is 1, B count is 3. So total R + B is 4, but R and B counts are not equal. Wait, that would mean the example is invalid, but the problem says it is valid. \n\nWait, let's count:\n\nThe example's final string is B R B B W. \n\nB's: positions 1,3,4 \u2192 3 B's.\n\nR's: position 2 \u2192 1 R. \n\nTotal R (1) and B (3) \u2192 not equal. So this would violate the condition. But the example says it is possible. \n\nHmm, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait, the example's steps:\n\nThe first stamp adds R and B \u2192 total R:1, B:1.\n\nSecond stamp adds B and R \u2192 total R:1+1=2? Or no, each stamp overwrites the cells. \n\nWait, each stamp changes the two cells to either RB or BR. So each stamp contributes exactly one R and one B. But if you stamp over existing cells, you're replacing their previous colors. \n\nSo the total number of R and B in the final string must be equal? \n\nIn the example's final string, there are 3 B's and 1 R \u2192 total R and B counts are not equal. So this would violate the condition. But the example says it is possible. \n\nThis suggests that my assumption is wrong. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the total R and B counts don't have to be equal. \n\nWait, let's see the example's steps:\n\nFirst stamp: adds R and B \u2192 total R:1, B:1.\n\nSecond stamp: adds B and R \u2192 so the first two cells are B and R. So the total R and B counts are still 1 each (since the second cell was W before, now R, and first was W to B. So net R:1, B:1. \n\nThird stamp: on positions 2-3 (R and W). The stamp could be set to RB \u2192 so R and B. So the second cell is R (no change?), third becomes B. So the third cell was W \u2192 now B. So the total R count is still 1 (position2), B count is 2 (positions1 and3). \n\nFourth cell is R from first stamp, fifth is B. \n\nWait, after third step, the string is B R B R B? Or perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, let's track the total R and B after each step:\n\nInitial: all W \u2192 R=0, B=0.\n\nFirst stamp (positions4-5 as RB): R=1, B=1.\n\nSecond stamp (positions1-2 as BR): adds B and R \u2192 but overwriting the first two W's. So now R count is 1 (position2) and B count is 1 (position1). So total R=1, B=1.\n\nThird stamp (positions2-3 as RB): position2 was R, now becomes R (no change?), position3 was W \u2192 B. So R count remains 1 (position2), B count increases by 1 (position3). So now R=1, B=2. \n\nFourth cell (position4) is R (from first stamp), fifth is B. \n\nSo total R: 1 (position2) + 1 (position4) \u2192 2. B: 1 (position1) + 1 (position3) + 1 (position5) \u2192 3. So total R=2, B=3. \n\nSo the final counts are R=2, B=3 \u2192 not equal. \n\nBut the example's final string has B R B B W \u2192 which has R=1, B=3. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. \n\nWait, the example's final string is B R B B W. So R count is 1, B count is 3. \n\nSo the total R and B are not equal. So the condition that they must be equal is not required. \n\nSo that idea is also incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is getting really tricky. \n\nPerhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. \n\nThe final string must be achievable through any number of such operations. \n\nThe key is that every non-W cell must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: the entire string can be viewed as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nEach non-W segment must be such that it can be covered by a series of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the sequence B R B B can be covered by the pairs (B R), (R B), and (B B) \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence can be covered by overlapping pairs in a way that allows for some flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must be such that it can be written as a sequence of R and B where every other character is the same. \n\nWait, in the example's case B R B B \u2192 the first three characters alternate B R B (alternating), but the fourth is B again. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence must have no two identical characters in a row except possibly at the end. \n\nWait, but the example has two B's at the end. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look for the following conditions:\n\n1. All maximal non-W segments have length at least 2.\n\n2. In each maximal non-W segment, every pair of adjacent characters must be either RB or BR. \n\nBut the example violates this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first condition is that all maximal non-W segments have even length? \n\nIn the example's case, the segment length is 4 (B R B B). 4 is even. \n\nThe first test case's example's segment length is 4 (B R B B) \u2192 even. \n\nAnother example: the fifth test case in the note is \"WWW \u2192 W R B B\". The segment length is 2 (R B B? No, the fifth test case's example is \"WWW \u2192 W R B B\" \u2192 the non-W segment is R B B? Or maybe the example is different. \n\nWait, the fifth test case's example is given as:\n\n\"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 then BRB. So the final string is BRB, which has length 3 (odd). So that would violate the even length condition. \n\nHmm, so that idea is also incorrect. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the code provided and see what the user has done so far. \n\nThe code given is:\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().split('W')\n    for i in s:\n        bs = 'B' in i\n        rs = 'R' in i\n        if bs ^ rs:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print('YES')\n\nfor t in range(int(input())):\n    solve()\n\nThe code splits the string into parts separated by 'W's. So each part is a maximal non-W segment. \n\nThe loop iterates over each segment (i). For each segment, it checks if there is a B and/or R. \n\nThe condition is if (bs XOR rs) is true. That is, if the segment contains B but not R, or R but not B. \n\nIn that case, the code is supposed to do something (probably return 'NO'). \n\nThe current code always prints 'YES', but the TODO is where the user needs to add code. \n\nThe idea here is that each segment must contain both B and R. Because if a segment has only B's or only R's, then it's impossible. \n\nFor example, a segment like \"RR\" can't be formed because each stamp must have one R and one B. So a segment with only R's or only B's is impossible. \n\nSo the first condition is that each non-W segment must contain at least one B and at least one R. \n\nThe code is checking for that. \n\nSo the code is currently splitting the string into non-W segments. For each segment, if it contains only B's or only R's, then it's invalid. \n\nSo the code should return 'NO' in that case. \n\nBut what about the example's case? The segment B R B B contains both B and R. So that's okay. \n\nThe example's segment has B and R, so the code would proceed. \n\nBut what other conditions are needed? \n\nThe code currently only checks that each segment has both B and R. But that's not sufficient. \n\nFor example, consider a segment like \"RBRB\" \u2192 which is valid. \n\nAnother example: \"RRBB\" \u2192 contains both R and B, but the first two are RR \u2192 which can't be formed. \n\nSo the code needs to check more conditions. \n\nThe next condition is that in each segment, the number of B's and R's must be equal? \n\nIn the example's segment B R B B \u2192 B count is 3, R count is 1 \u2192 not equal. So that would be invalid. But the example says it is valid. \n\nHmm, so that's not the condition. \n\nAlternatively, the difference between B and R counts must be 0 or 1? \n\nIn the example's case, difference is 2 \u2192 which would be invalid. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the number of B's and R's must have the same parity? \n\nIn the example's case, B count is 3 (odd), R count is 1 (odd) \u2192 same parity. \n\nHmm, but that's not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: the difference between the number of B's and R's in each segment must be 0 or 1. \n\nIn the example's case, difference is 2 \u2192 which would be invalid. \n\nBut the example is valid, so that's not the condition. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire segment must alternate between B and R, possibly with some overlapping. \n\nWait, the example's segment is B R B B. \n\nThe first three characters alternate B R B \u2192 which is okay. The fourth is B. \n\nBut how does that happen? \n\nThe fourth B must be part of a pair with the third B. But that pair is BB, which is not allowed. \n\nSo perhaps the code needs to check that the entire segment is such that every pair of adjacent characters is either RB or BR. \n\nBut in the example's case, the third and fourth are B and B \u2192 which is invalid. \n\nSo why is the example valid? \n\nThis suggests that my understanding of the example is incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W. \n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nBut how were they formed? \n\nIn the steps described in the problem's example:\n\nThe third step is stamping on positions 2-3 (R and W) as RB \u2192 so positions 2 and 3 become R and B. \n\nWait, after the second step, the string is B R W R B. \n\nStamping on positions 2-3 (R and W) as RB \u2192 so position2 becomes R (no change?), position3 becomes B. \n\nSo the string becomes B R B R B. \n\nThe fourth character is R. \n\nSo the final string is B R B R B. \n\nWhich has alternating B R B R B \u2192 which satisfies the condition that every adjacent pair is RB or BR. \n\nSo perhaps I misunderstood the example's final string. \n\nThe problem's example says the final picture is B R B B W. But perhaps that's a mistake, and the actual final string is B R B R B. \n\nIn that case, the example's final string would satisfy the condition that every adjacent pair is RB or BR. \n\nSo the correct conditions are:\n\n1. Each maximal non-W segment has length >=2.\n\n2. Each segment contains both B and R.\n\n3. In each segment, every pair of adjacent characters is either RB or BR. \n\nSo the code needs to check these conditions. \n\nThe current code checks condition 2 (each segment has both B and R). \n\nNow, the code needs to also check condition 1 and 3. \n\nSo the steps to complete the code are:\n\n- For each segment in s (the list of non-W segments):\n\n   a. If the length is less than 2 \u2192 return NO.\n\n   b. Check that every adjacent pair in the segment is either 'RB' or 'BR'.\n\n   c. Also, check that the segment contains both B and R (which is already done via the XOR condition).\n\nWait, the XOR condition is 'B' in i and 'R' in i \u2192 if either is missing, then the XOR would be true (since XOR is true when exactly one is true). Wait, no. \n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nbs = 'B' in i\n\nrs = 'R' in i\n\nif bs ^ rs \u2192 which is true when exactly one of them is true. \n\nSo if the segment has only B's or only R's \u2192 then this condition is true \u2192 which would trigger the TODO. \n\nSo the code should return 'NO' in that case. \n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nFor each segment:\n\n   if length <2 \u2192 return NO.\n\n   if (bs and rs) is false \u2192 return NO.\n\n   check that every adjacent pair is RB or BR.\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, return 'NO'. \n\nElse, return 'YES'. \n\nSo the code needs to implement these checks. \n\nNow, the current code has the loop over the segments. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor i in s:\n\n    bs = 'B' in i\n\n    rs = 'R' in i\n\n    if bs ^ rs:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe 'bs ^ rs' is true when exactly one of them is true \u2192 which means the segment has only B's or only R's \u2192 which is invalid. \n\nSo in that case, the code should return 'NO'. \n\nBut the code currently does nothing and proceeds to print 'YES'. \n\nSo the TODO should be to return 'NO' in that case. \n\nBut also, there are other conditions to check. \n\nThe first condition is that the length of the segment is at least 2. \n\nSo the code should also check for that. \n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nfor each segment in s:\n\n    if len(i) < 2 \u2192 return 'NO'\n\n    if (bs and rs) is false \u2192 return 'NO'\n\n    check that every adjacent pair in the segment is RB or BR. \n\nIf any of these conditions fail, return 'NO'. \n\nElse, after all segments are checked, return 'YES'. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified to include these checks. \n\nThe current code is:\n\ndef solve():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    s = input().split('W')\n\n    for i in s:\n\n        bs = 'B' in i\n\n        rs = 'R' in i\n\n        if bs ^ rs:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print('YES')\n\nSo the first thing to do is to check for the length of each segment. \n\nSo inside the loop over the segments:\n\nfor i in s:\n\n    if len(i) < 2:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n        return \n\n    # then check the other conditions \n\nWait, but the function is supposed to process all test cases. So the function should return early if any condition is violated. \n\nAlso, the code currently splits the string into segments by splitting on 'W's. So the segments are the parts between W's. \n\nSo the code should loop through each segment, and for each:\n\n- if length <2 \u2192 return NO.\n\n- if (bs and rs) is false \u2192 return NO.\n\n- check all adjacent pairs in the segment are RB or BR. \n\nIf any of these fail, return NO. \n\nElse, after all segments are checked, return YES. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified as follows:\n\ndef solve():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    s_str = input().strip()  # maybe better to use .strip()\n\n    segments = s_str.split('W')\n\n    for seg in segments:\n\n        if len(seg) < 2:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            return\n\n        # check if contains both B and R\n\n        has_B = 'B' in seg\n\n        has_R = 'R' in seg\n\n        if not (has_B and has_R):\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            return\n\n        # check adjacent pairs\n\n        for j in range(len(seg)-1):\n\n            pair = seg[j:j+2]\n\n            if pair not in ['RB', 'BR']:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                return\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but this would split the string into segments separated by W's. \n\nBut the split on 'W' will split the string into parts between W's. So for example, \"BRB\" is a segment, and \"WW\" would split into empty strings. \n\nWait, the split on 'W' will include empty strings for leading or trailing W's. \n\nFor example, if the string is \"WBRW\", then split on 'W' gives ['', 'BR', '']. \n\nSo we need to filter out empty segments. \n\nBecause empty segments (length 0) are allowed (they are the parts between W's), but we need to ignore them. \n\nSo the code should loop over the segments, and for each segment, if it is non-empty, then check the conditions. \n\nSo modifying the code:\n\ndef solve():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    s_str = input().strip()\n\n    segments = s_str.split('W')\n\n    for seg in segments:\n\n        if seg == '': \n\n            continue  # skip empty segments\n\n        if len(seg) < 2:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            return\n\n        has_B = 'B' in seg\n\n        has_R = 'R' in seg\n\n        if not (has_B and has_R):\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            return\n\n        for j in range(len(seg)-1):\n\n            pair = seg[j:j+2]\n\n            if pair not in ['RB', 'BR']:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                return\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nThis should handle all cases. \n\nNow, let's test this with the example's case. \n\nExample's final string is B R B B W \u2192 the segments are ['BRBB', ''] (assuming the string ends with W). \n\nThe first segment is 'BRBB' (length 4). \n\nCheck length >=2 \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck has both B and R \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck pairs:\n\nBR \u2192 allowed.\n\nRB \u2192 allowed.\n\nBB \u2192 not allowed. \n\nSo the third pair (positions 2-3 of the segment) is 'BB', which is not allowed. \n\nSo the code would return 'NO', but the example says it should return 'YES'. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nAh! This is the crux of the problem. \n\nThe example's final string must be possible, but according to this code, it would return 'NO' because of the BB pair. \n\nBut according to the problem's example, it is possible. \n\nThis means that the code's logic is wrong. \n\nSo what's wrong here? \n\nThe example's final string must have a valid sequence of stamps. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, the segment 'BRBB' has an invalid pair. \n\nBut according to the problem's example, it is possible. \n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition? \n\nPerhaps the condition is not that every adjacent pair must be RB or BR, but that the entire sequence can be formed by overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the sequence BRBB can be formed by the following stamps:\n\nStamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R \n\nStamp 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R \n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B \n\nSo the sequence would be B (1), R (2), B (3), R (4). \n\nBut that's not the desired BRBB. \n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. \n\nThe example's final string is B R B B. \n\nThe pairs are B R (okay), R B (okay), B B (invalid). \n\nBut how can this be formed? \n\nPerhaps the last two B's are part of a stamp applied on positions 3-4 as BB? No, that's not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the last two B's are part of a stamp applied on positions 3-4 as BR or RB. \n\nWait, let's think of the steps that form B R B B:\n\nSuppose the steps are:\n\n1. Stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R \n\n2. Stamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R \n\n3. Stamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B \n\nSo after step3, the string is B (1), R (2) becomes R (no change?), B (3), R (4). \n\nNo, that gives B R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, step3 is stamping positions 3-4 as BB \u2192 which is not allowed. \n\nHmm, I'm not able to find a way to form B R B B with valid stamps. \n\nPerhaps the example's final string is a mistake, or perhaps my understanding is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct and the example is wrong. \n\nBut according to the problem's example, it is possible. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the code that checks the conditions of length >=2, contains both B and R, and every adjacent pair is RB or BR. \n\nBecause that seems to be the logical condition based on the stamp's effect. \n\nEven if the example seems to contradict it, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's analysis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is different. \n\nThe problem's example says the final picture is B R B B W. \n\nBut perhaps the correct final string is B R B R B, which would have alternating pairs. \n\nIn that case, the code would return 'YES'. \n\nPerhaps the example's description has a typo. \n\nAssuming that the code's logic is correct, then the code should be implemented as above. \n\nNow, looking back at the code provided by the user, the current code splits the string into segments and checks for the presence of both B and R. \n\nThe missing code in the TODO is to return 'NO' when the segment has only B or only R. \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nif bs ^ rs:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    return \n\nBut also, the code needs to check the length of the segment and the adjacent pairs. \n\nBut the user's code currently only has the XOR condition. \n\nThe user's code is incomplete because it doesn't check the length or the pairs. \n\nSo the correct code should include all three conditions. \n\nBut the problem requires that the code is completed by filling in the missing lines. \n\nThe user's code currently has:\n\nfor i in s:\n\n    bs = 'B' in i\n\n    rs = 'R' in i\n\n    if bs ^ rs:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO should return 'NO' and exit. \n\nBut also, the code needs to check the length of the segment. \n\nSo the code should first check for the length of each segment. \n\nBut the user's code doesn't have that. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified to include those checks. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code currently has the loop over the segments, and the XOR condition. \n\nThe missing code in the TODO is to return 'NO' when the XOR is true. \n\nBut also, the code needs to check the length of the segment and the pairs. \n\nBut since the user's code doesn't have those checks, perhaps the problem expects that the code should return 'NO' when the XOR is true, and also check the length and pairs. \n\nBut the user's code is incomplete in multiple places. \n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code currently has the loop over the segments, and the XOR condition. \n\nThe TODO is inside the if bs ^ rs block. \n\nSo the missing code there is to return 'NO' and exit. \n\nBut also, the code needs to check the length of the segment and the pairs. \n\nBut since the user's code doesn't have those checks, perhaps the problem expects that the code should return 'NO' in the XOR case, and also add other conditions. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code currently has the loop over the segments, and the XOR condition. \n\nThe missing code in the TODO is to return 'NO' when the XOR is true. \n\nSo the code for the TODO is:\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nreturn \n\nBut also, the code needs to check the length of the segment. \n\nBut the user's code doesn't have that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects that the code should return 'NO' when the XOR is true, and also check the length of the segment. \n\nBut the user's code currently doesn't have the length check. \n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code's current structure is:\n\nfor i in s:\n\n    bs = 'B' in i\n\n    rs = 'R' in i\n\n    if bs ^ rs:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code here is to return 'NO' when the condition is met. \n\nSo the code for the TODO is:\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nreturn \n\nBut also, the code needs to check the length of the segment. \n\nBut the user's code doesn't have that. \n\nThe problem's code may have other missing parts. \n\nThe user's code currently prints 'YES' unconditionally after the loop. \n\nSo the code needs to return early if any condition is violated. \n\nThus, the complete code would involve adding the length check and the pair check. \n\nBut since the problem says to output only the missing code, perhaps the missing code is just the 'print' and 'return' in the TODO block. \n\nBut the problem's example requires that the code also checks the pairs and lengths. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nPerhaps the problem's intended solution is to check that each non-W segment has both B and R, and that the entire string has an even number of non-W characters. \n\nWait, the example's segment has length 4 (even), and the total non-W count is 4 (B R B B \u2192 4 characters). \n\nThe fifth test case's example has a segment of length 3 (odd), but the problem's note says it is possible. \n\nSo that idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct solution is to check that each non-W segment has both B and R, and that the entire string has an even number of non-W characters. \n\nIn the example's case, the non-W count is 4 (even). \n\nThe fifth test case's example has 3 characters (odd) \u2192 but the note says it is possible. \n\nSo that's not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct solution is to check that each non-W segment has both B and R, and that the entire string has an even number of non-W characters. \n\nBut the fifth test case's example has 3 characters (odd), which would fail this condition. \n\nBut the note says it is possible. \n\nSo that's not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the
