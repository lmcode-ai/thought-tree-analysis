So, the term dp[j] + (i-j)^2 = dp[j] + i\u00b2 - 2ij + j\u00b2. This can be rewritten as ( -2j * i ) + ( dp[j] + j\u00b2 ) + i\u00b2.

Now, the problem is that the code provided has a missing part in the Dijkstra's algorithm. Looking back at the Dijkstra function.

Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Stanley traveling between cities with roads and flights. The key point is that he can take at most k flights. The goal is to find the minimum time to each city from city 1, considering that flights between any two cities u and v take (u - v)^2 time, but he can use at most k of them.\n\nLooking at the code provided, it seems like the approach is using Dijkstra's algorithm combined with some dynamic programming and convex hull trick. Let's see what's there and what's missing.\n\nThe code starts by importing necessary modules and setting up a Dijkstra function. The Dijkstra function has a comment indicating it's from a library, but in the code's current state, the TODO line is incomplete. Wait, looking at the code for dijkstra:\n\nIn the function dijkstra, after the for loop over G[v]'s edges, there's a comment saying \"# TODO: Your code here\". That's definitely missing. The line should update the distance for node u if a better path is found. The standard Dijkstra step would be:\n\nif dist[u] > dist[v] + cost:\n    dist[u] = dist[v] + cost\n    heappush(hp, (dist[u]*B + u))\n\nSo that's one missing part here. But the problem might have more missing code? Let me check the rest.\n\nWait the code given after that has parts where they are doing something with the convex hull trick. Let me see the overall structure. The code first runs Dijkstra on the road graph to get the minimal times using roads only (assuming 0 flights). Then, for each flight allowed (up to k times?), it tries to compute the best path using up to that number of flights.\n\nHmm, the code loops over k times, and in each iteration, it seems to try to account for adding one more flight. The approach here might be dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the minimal time with up to that many flights. Each step, for each city i, the new DP value can be the previous value (without using a flight) or the best possible flight from any other city.\n\nWait, the code inside the loop for iii in range(k):\n\nThey initialize newdp to 10^11. Then, for each i, they add a line to the convex hull trick. The line added is -2i * x + (dp[i] + i\u00b2). Then, querying for x = i gives cht.query(i) + i\u00b2. Wait, perhaps the convex hull is being used to find for each city i the minimum of (dp[j] + (i-j)^2) over all j? Because (i-j)^2 = i\u00b2 - 2ij + j\u00b2, so if you rearrange terms, maybe they're trying to express this as a linear function in terms of j. \n\nAlternatively, the flight between j and i takes (j - i)^2 time. So for each possible j, the cost to take a flight from j to i is (i-j)^2. The newdp[i] would be the minimum between its current value (from roads) and (dp[j] + (i-j)^2) for all j. But considering all j would be O(n^2), which is too big. Hence, the convex hull trick is used here to optimize this.\n\nThe line added to the CHT is for each j, the line a = -2j, b = dp[j] + j\u00b2. Then for a given i, the query would compute the minimum over all j of (a * i + b) = -2j*i + dp[j] + j\u00b2. Which simplifies to ( -2ij + j\u00b2 ) + dp[j], which is j\u00b2 - 2ij + i\u00b2 - i\u00b2 + dp[j] + j\u00b2? Wait, wait no. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, (i-j)^2 = i\u00b2 - 2ij + j\u00b2. So, the term dp[j] + (i-j)^2 = dp[j] + i\u00b2 - 2ij + j\u00b2. \n\nThis can be rewritten as ( -2j * i ) + ( dp[j] + j\u00b2 ) + i\u00b2. \n\nSo, when you take the CHT, the term involving i is linear in i, so the lines for each j are a = -2j, b = dp[j] + j\u00b2. Then the minimum over all j of (a * i + b) gives the minimal ( -2j*i + (dp[j] +j\u00b2) ), which when added to i\u00b2 gives the minimal (dp[j] + (i-j)^2). \n\nHence, the CHT is used to compute the minimal (dp[j] + (i-j)^2) for each i by querying the CHT at x=i. Then, the newdp[i] would be the minimum between the current newdp[i] and that value. \n\nBut in the code's current loop, after adding all the lines, they loop over each i from 1 to n, and set newdp[i] to the query result plus i squared. However, this might not be correct because they need to compare with the previous DP value (from roads) and also update via roads again.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nAfter the CHT part, they set newdp[i] = cht.query(i) + i**2. But that's the minimal flight path from any j, but then they also need to consider the roads, which are handled via Dijkstra again.\n\nWait, the code after the CHT step does:\n\ndp = newdp[:]\ndp = dijkstra(root, dp)\n\nAh, so after calculating newdp via flights, they run Dijkstra again to incorporate road paths. Because the newdp is the best of either taking a flight (from any j) or the previous dp (without that flight?), but then after that, they run Dijkstra to propagate the road paths again. \n\nHmm, the approach is similar to the 0-1 BFS, but in this case, each step allows adding one more flight. So for each flight allowed, we compute the possible improvement via a flight, then propagate road paths again. \n\nSo the code's structure is that each iteration through k steps allows adding one flight, and then computes the best path with up to that number of flights.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code provided has a missing part in the Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nLooking back at the Dijkstra function. The function is supposed to take the graph G and the initial distance array, then compute the shortest paths. Let me look at the code for dijkstra:\n\ndef dijkstra(G, dist, INF=1e11):\n    N = len(dist)\n    hp = []\n    for i in range(N):\n        heappush(hp, dist[i]*B + i) # B is 1e5+10, so this is a way to store (cost, node) in a single integer to use the heap.\n\n    while hp:\n        cv = heappop(hp)\n        c, v = cv // B, cv % B\n        if dist[v] < c:\n            continue\n        for u, cost in G[v]:\n            if dist[v] + cost < dist[u]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO part here is missing the code to update the distance for u and push to the heap. \n\nThe standard Dijkstra step would be:\n\ndist[u] = dist[v] + cost\n\nand then push (new distance * B + u) into the heap. But since this is a priority queue, we have to do this even if the node is already in the heap. \n\nBut we need to only push when the new distance is better. So:\n\nif dist[u] > dist[v] + cost:\n    dist[u] = dist[v] + cost\n    heappush(hp, dist[u]*B + u)\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop is over G[v], which is the adjacency list. So for each neighbor u of v, with edge cost, we check if the current distance to u can be improved via v. \n\nSo the missing line is:\n\nheappush(hp, ( (dist[u] * B) + u )) ?\n\nWait, but when we update dist[u] to dist[v] + cost, the new distance is dist[u] = dist[v]+cost. So after setting dist[u] to the new value, we need to push the new entry into the heap. \n\nAlternatively, the code should be:\n\nif dist[v] + cost < dist[u]:\n    dist[u] = dist[v] + cost\n    heappush(hp, (dist[u] * B + u))\n\nWait, but how is the heap stored? Let me think. The B is a scaling factor. The code uses a trick where the cost is multiplied by B (1e5+10) and added to the node index. Because the maximum possible cost (INF) is 1e11, and B is ~1e5, so B*N (for N up to 1e5) would be about 1e10 which is less than INF. Wait, but actually, the B is 1e5+10, so when multiplied by INF (1e11), that would be way too big. Wait, maybe the code's B is just a scaling factor for the priority. \n\nWait, in the code, the initial push is for each node i, the distance is dist[i] multiplied by B plus i. The B is chosen so that distances (which are up to 1e11) when multiplied by B won't interfere with the node index (since B is 1e5+10, and node indices are up to 1e5). So, when you multiply the distance by B and add i (which is <=1e5), the node index part doesn't interfere with the distance's higher bits. This way, the priority is correctly ordered by the distance. \n\nSo in the TODO part, after updating dist[u], we need to push the new distance * B + u into the heap. \n\nThus, the correct code here should be:\n\nif dist[v] + cost < dist[u]:\n    dist[u] = dist[v] + cost\n    heappush(hp, dist[u] * B + u)\n\nWait, but the heappush needs the value to be a tuple? Or is the code using integers as a way to encode the priority and node? \n\nYes, the code is using an integer to encode the cost and node. For example, the initial push is heappush(hp, dist[i]*B + i). \n\nSo the correct line is:\n\nheappush(hp, dist[u] * B + u)\n\nBut in the code, the first line after the if is to set dist[u] = dist[v] + cost. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code is:\n\n                if dist[v] + cost < dist[u]:\n                    dist[u] = dist[v] + cost\n                    heappush(hp, dist[u] * B + u)\n\nSo that's the missing code in the Dijkstra function. \n\nWait, but the code uses the 'hp' variable which is the heap. Also, since the code may have multiple entries for the same node in the heap, but when the distance is updated, the old entries are ignored because when they are popped, if the current distance is less than the stored cost, we skip processing. \n\nSo this is the correct step. \n\nNow, checking the rest of the code. Let me see if there are other missing parts. \n\nLooking at the main code:\n\nAfter initializing the roads, they run dijkstra once to get the initial DP with 0 flights. Then, for each of the k flights allowed, they compute the new DP by considering taking a flight from any node j to i, then run Dijkstra again to propagate the road paths. \n\nWait in the code, after the CHT step, newdp is set as the minimum between the flight path and the current dp? Or is the CHT step already considering the previous DP? \n\nWait the code for the flight part:\n\nIn the loop for each flight step:\n\nThey create a newdp array, then for each j (since they add lines for all i from 1 to n), the CHT is built with lines from all j's. Then, for each i, the minimal flight path from any j is found. \n\nThe newdp[i] is set to that minimal value. Then, they set dp = newdp, and run Dijkstra again. \n\nWait, but maybe the newdp is the minimal time considering one more flight (so the current flight count is iii+1?), and then the Dijkstra step after allows using roads between the flights. \n\nSo the overall approach is for each flight step:\n\n- The newdp starts as the minimal time using up to (current flight count) flights, then adding one more flight. \n\nWait, maybe the order is that first, they compute the best possible by adding one flight (from any j), then propagate via roads. \n\nThe Dijkstra after the CHT step allows taking roads after the flight. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo the code seems correct except for the missing lines in Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nTherefore, the only missing part is the code in the Dijkstra's function where the TODO is. \n\nSo the answer is to put that code there. \n\nThus, the correct code to output is the lines for the TODO section."
