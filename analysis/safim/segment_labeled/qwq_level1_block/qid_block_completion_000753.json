Looking at the code structure, in the while loop:\n\nwhile (t-- >0) {\n   // need to read the rating here, then call getAns(r)\n} So first, inside the loop, read the input line, parse it into an integer. Then call getAns with that integer. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input line for the current test case. Since each test case's input is one line with the rating, we can do Console. ReadLine().Trim() then parse to int. So something like:\n\nint rating = int. Parse(Console.ReadLine().Trim());\n\nThen call getAns(rating); So putting it all together, the code inside the loop would be:\n\nint r = int. Parse(Console.ReadLine().Trim());\ngetAns(r); Wait, but the method is called getAns, which takes the rating as a parameter. So yes, that's correct.",

Therefore, the code to insert into the TODO block is those two lines. Wait, but maybe the code can be written as a single line? Like:\n\ngetAns(int. Parse(Console.ReadLine().Trim()));\n\nBut that's also possible. However, the problem says to output the missing code. The original code has the TODO comment there, so the user probably expects to read the input and call the function. So the correct code is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nvar rating = int. Parse(Console.ReadLine().Trim());\ngetAns(rating); Alternatively, using var or not, but the code should read the input and call getAns with it. Looking at the code structure, the getAns function is already correctly implemented. Let me check the getAns function again. In the code provided, the getAns function:\n\nstatic void getAns(int r)\n{\n    int d;\n    if (r >= 1900) d = 1;\n    else if (r >= 1600) d = 2;\n    else if (r >= 1400) d = 3;\n    else d =4;\n    Console. WriteLine(\"Division {0}\", d);\n} Yes, that seems correct. Let's test with the examples given in the notes. For example, when the rating is 1400, the first condition is false. Then check else if r >=1600: 1400 is not, so next else if r >=1400: yes, so d=3. So division 3. Correct. Another example: 1679: it's >=1600 but less than 1900, so division 2. Correct. 2300 is division 1. And ratings below 1400, like 1399, go to else, so d=4. All correct. So the getAns function is correct. Therefore, the only missing part is reading each test case's input and calling getAns. Therefore, the code to insert into the TODO block is:\n\nint r = int. Parse(Console.ReadLine().Trim());\ngetAns(r); Alternatively, as a one-liner:\n\ngetAns(int. Parse(Console.ReadLine().Trim()));\n\nEither should work.
