  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing code in the Java program for this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum unhappiness value while ensuring the number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs both invited) is even. \n\nHmm, the code provided has some parts that are incomplete. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. \n\nThe problem says that each member not invited adds their a_i to the unhappiness. The cakes are the number of friend pairs where both are invited. The total cakes must be even. We need to minimize the unhappiness under this constraint.\n\nThe approach here probably involves some kind of graph or pairing consideration. Let me think about how the current code is structured. \n\nLooking at the work function:\n\nThey read n and m, then the a array. Then they read the m friend pairs into x and y arrays, and track the degree of each node (maybe the number of friends each has?).\n\nThen the code initializes ans to MAX_VALUE. Then there's a check if m is even, setting ans to 0. Wait, why? Maybe if m is even, then it's possible to have an even number of cakes by just inviting everyone? Or maybe that's a mistake. Let me think. If m is even, then the total number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs invited) can be even. But if all are invited, then the number of cakes is exactly m. So if m is even, then that's acceptable. But the unhappiness would be the sum of a_i for those not invited, which would be zero if everyone is invited. So maybe that's the case where the answer is zero. But that's only possible if m is even. Wait, but the problem says the cakes must be even. So if m is even, then inviting everyone gives exactly m cakes, which is even. So that's a valid solution. So in that case, the minimum could be zero. But maybe there are cases where even if m is even, there's a better solution with lower unhappiness? Like maybe not inviting some people but still keeping the cakes even. Hmm, but the code here sets ans to 0 if m is even. But maybe that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to handle some cases first. Let me see further.\n\nThen there's a loop over all nodes with degree[i] odd. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\". So that's one missing part. Then another loop over all edges, checking if both degrees are even, and then taking the sum of a[x[i]] and a[y[i]] as a possible candidate for ans. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach here is to model this as a graph problem where the degrees of the nodes (number of friends) play a role. Wait, the degrees here are the number of friends each has. But when you invite someone, their degree in the selected subset might not be the same as their original degree. Wait, maybe the code is considering something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled as a graph where the edges are the friend pairs, and the selection of nodes (whether to invite or not) must form a subset such that the number of edges in the subset is even. The goal is to minimize the sum of a_i for uninvited nodes. \n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be approached with some kind of parity constraints. Let me think of it as a graph where each edge contributes to the parity. The total number of edges selected (both endpoints invited) must be even. \n\nThe key idea here might be similar to the problem where you have to choose a subset of vertices such that the number of edges in the subset has even parity, and you want to minimize the cost (sum of a_i for not chosen). \n\nThis reminds me of the problem where you have to find a minimum vertex cover with parity constraints, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to the problem where you can model it as a graph and find a minimum weight vertex cover with some parity condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node has a cost (the a_i if not invited, so the cost of inviting is 0, not inviting is a_i). The total cost is the sum of a_i for all not invited. The constraint is that the number of edges in the invited subset must be even. \n\nHmm, how can we model this? Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node can be either invited (0 cost) or not (a_i cost). The edges contribute to the parity. The total edges selected (both endpoints invited) must be even. \n\nThe minimal cost would be the minimal sum of a_i for not invited nodes, such that the number of edges with both endpoints invited is even. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a graph and some parity constraints. \n\nOne approach for such parity constraints is to model it as a graph and use a minimum cut approach. For example, in some problems, you can model the parity as a constraint and use a bipartition with a source and sink. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as follows: \n\nThe minimal total unhappiness is the sum of all a_i minus the sum of the a_i of the invited people (since the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited). Wait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize that, we want to invite as many as possible (since inviting someone doesn't add their a_i). But the constraint is that the number of edges (friend pairs) where both are invited must be even. \n\nSo the problem is to choose a subset S of the nodes (those invited) such that the number of edges entirely within S is even, and the sum of a_i for nodes not in S is minimized. \n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of invited nodes (since that reduces the unhappiness) but with the parity constraint on the edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where we can model the parity condition. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of parity. Let's denote the number of edges in the selected subset (both endpoints invited) as C. We need C to be even. \n\nSuppose that without the parity constraint, the minimal unhappiness would be the sum of a_i for all not invited. But with the constraint, we might have to exclude some nodes or include some to adjust the parity. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness would be the minimal between two cases: either the minimal when C is even, or when C is even but with some adjustments. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each edge contributes to the parity, and we can model this as a bipartition with a parity constraint. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let me think of the problem as follows: \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in the selected subset (C) must be even. To model this, we can consider the problem as a graph and use a minimum cut approach where the parity is enforced by connecting to a dummy node. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nThe problem can be considered as a graph where each node has a cost (a_i if not invited, 0 if invited). The total cost is the sum of a_i for not invited. The constraint is that the number of edges with both endpoints invited must be even. \n\nWe can model this as a graph where we need to choose a subset S of nodes (invited) such that the number of edges in S is even, and the cost is minimized. \n\nTo model this, perhaps we can use a bipartition where we have two possible states (even or odd), and find the minimal cost for the even case. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible way to model it using a graph with a source and sink. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nWe can model the problem as a graph where each node can be in S (invited) or not. The edges between nodes contribute to the parity. To enforce the parity constraint, we can add a dummy node and connect it in a way that enforces the parity. \n\nAlternatively, here's a standard approach for parity constraints in such problems: \n\nSuppose that the parity of the number of edges in the selected subset must be even. Let's consider that each edge contributes 1 to the parity. The total must be even. \n\nThis can be modeled by considering the problem as a graph and adding a parity constraint. \n\nThe standard method for such parity constraints is to use a bipartition and connect to a dummy node. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem of finding a minimum vertex cover with parity constraints. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node has a cost, and edges have some constraints. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of all a_i minus the sum of the a_i of the invited nodes. Wait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So the total unhappiness is sum_{i not in S} a_i. To minimize this, we want to maximize the sum of a_i for those not in S, but that's the opposite. Wait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize it, we want as many as possible of the nodes with high a_i to be invited. Wait, no, actually, the a_i is the unhappiness if not invited. So if a_i is high, you want to invite them to avoid adding that to the total. \n\nSo the problem is to choose a subset S (invited) such that the number of edges in S is even, and the sum of a_i for nodes not in S is minimized. \n\nThe minimal sum is equivalent to maximizing the sum of (a_i) for nodes in S (since the total sum of all a_i is fixed, so minimizing the unhappiness is equivalent to maximizing the sum of a_i for invited nodes). \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nTotal unhappiness = sum_{i not in S} a_i = total_a - sum_{i in S} a_i. \n\nSo to minimize the unhappiness, we need to maximize the sum of a_i for the invited nodes, under the constraint that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nAh, that's a key insight. So the problem reduces to finding a subset S of nodes with maximum possible sum of a_i, such that the number of edges in S (both endpoints in S) is even. Then the minimal unhappiness is total_a minus this maximum sum. \n\nSo the problem becomes: maximize the sum of a_i for S, with the number of edges in S even. \n\nNow, how do we model this? \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model this as a graph and find the maximum weight subset with even edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each edge contributes to the parity, and we can use a flow-based approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of parity. Let's denote the number of edges in S as C. We need C even. \n\nSuppose that without the parity constraint, the maximum sum would be the sum of all a_i (if we can invite everyone, but that may have C = m, which may be even or odd). \n\nIf m is even, then inviting everyone is allowed, so that's the best possible. But if m is odd, then we need to adjust the selection to make C even. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any subset S where the number of edges in S is even. So when m is even, the maximum is indeed the sum of all a_i (if all are invited, then C = m which is even). \n\nBut if m is odd, then inviting everyone would give C = m (odd), which is invalid. So in that case, we need to exclude some nodes so that the number of edges in S becomes even. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as follows: \n\nThe maximum possible sum is either the maximum over all subsets S with even C, or the maximum over subsets with odd C, whichever is better. But since we need even, we have to choose the even case. \n\nHmm, but how do we model this? \n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the parity of C can be adjusted by flipping the inclusion of certain nodes. \n\nSuppose that the optimal solution without the parity constraint is S0. If the parity of C0 (the number of edges in S0) is even, then that's our solution. If it's odd, then we need to find a way to flip some nodes to make the parity even, while losing as little a_i as possible. \n\nBut how do we find such a flip? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each edge is a constraint, and the parity is tracked. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem of finding a minimum cut with parity constraints. \n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node has a weight (a_i). We need to choose a subset S such that the number of edges in S is even, and the sum of a_i for S is maximized. \n\nThe key idea here is that the parity of the number of edges in S must be even. To model this, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph with a source and sink, and use a minimum cut approach where the parity is enforced. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the standard method for parity constraints in such problems. \n\nWe can model the problem as a graph where each node is split into two nodes, and we have to choose a direction (invited or not) such that the parity is even. \n\nAlternatively, here's a standard approach for parity constraints in graph problems: \n\nWe can model the problem with a bipartition and a dummy node. Let me think of the following steps: \n\n1. Create a graph where each node has two states: invited or not. \n\n2. The edges between nodes contribute to the parity. \n\n3. To enforce the parity constraint, we can connect all nodes to a dummy node in a way that the parity is tracked. \n\nAlternatively, here's a method using a flow network: \n\nWe can model the problem as a flow network where the parity is enforced via a parity constraint. \n\nThe idea is to model the problem as a graph where the parity of the number of edges in the selected subset must be even. To do this, we can use a flow network with a source and a sink, and connect the nodes in such a way that the parity is considered. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\n- The total maximum sum is the sum of all a_i (if all are invited) minus the cost of excluding some nodes. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where the edges are considered, and the parity is tracked. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem of finding a minimum vertex cover with parity constraints. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in S must be even. Let's consider that each edge contributes 1 to the parity. The total must be even. \n\nWe can model this as a graph where each edge is a variable, and the sum must be even. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nThe problem can be considered as a graph where each node has a weight (a_i if invited, 0 otherwise). The total weight is the sum of a_i for invited nodes. The constraint is that the number of edges in the selected subset (both endpoints invited) must be even. \n\nTo model this, perhaps we can use a flow network where the parity is enforced via a parity constraint. \n\nThe standard approach for such parity constraints is to use a bipartition and a dummy node. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\n1. Create a source node and a sink node. \n\n2. For each node i, split it into two nodes, i and i'. \n\n3. Connect the source to i with capacity a_i (since inviting the node gives us a_i). \n\n4. Connect i to i' with infinite capacity (so that the flow must go through either i or i'). \n\n5. Connect i' to the sink with capacity 0 (so that choosing not to invite the node doesn't contribute). \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too vague. Let me think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach using the concept of parity: \n\nSuppose that the optimal solution without the parity constraint is S0. Let C0 be the number of edges in S0. \n\nIf C0 is even, then that's our solution. \n\nIf C0 is odd, then we need to find a way to flip some nodes so that the parity becomes even, while losing as little a_i as possible. \n\nThe minimal loss would be the minimal (a_i + a_j - 2* something?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe difference between the optimal even and odd cases can be found by considering the edges. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample inputs. \n\nLooking at the first sample input: \n\nSample Input 1: \n\nSuppose n=3, m=2, a = [0,0,0], and the edges are (1-2) and (2-3). \n\nIf all are invited, the number of cakes is 2 (even), so that's allowed. The unhappiness is 0. \n\nSample Input 2: \n\nn=3, m=0. So no edges. The number of cakes is 0 (even). So any subset is allowed. The minimal unhappiness is the minimal sum of a_i not invited. \n\nWait, in the second sample given in the problem description, the a array is [4,5,3], and m=0. So the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3 (unhappiness 3). \n\nHmm, so the problem requires that the number of edges in the subset must be even. \n\nNow, back to the code provided. \n\nLooking at the code's current approach: \n\nThe code first reads n and m, then the a array, then the edges. \n\nThen, it initializes ans to Integer.MAX_VALUE. \n\nThen, if m is even, it sets ans to 0. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if m is even, but the optimal solution might not be to invite everyone. For example, if some a_i are very high, it might be better to exclude some. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to handle some cases, but it's not correct. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is: \n\n- If m is even, then ans is set to 0. \n\nBut that's only valid if inviting everyone is possible (i.e., the number of edges is m, which is even). But the unhappiness would be zero only if all a_i are zero. Otherwise, the unhappiness would be the sum of a_i for those not invited. \n\nWait, the code's initial setting of ans to 0 when m is even is probably wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to handle the case where the number of edges is even, so the minimal possible is zero (if all are invited and a_i are zero). But that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to set ans to the minimal possible value when m is even, but that's not correct. \n\nLooking further into the code: \n\nThen there's a loop over all nodes with degree[i] odd. The code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". \n\nThen, there's a loop over all edges, checking if both degrees are even, and then taking the sum of a[x[i]] and a[y[i]] as a candidate for ans. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem in terms of the degrees of the nodes. \n\nWait, the degree here is the number of friends each node has. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where the degrees are considered. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is being modeled as a graph where the edges are the friend pairs, and the degrees are the number of friends each has. \n\nThe code's approach might be considering that the parity of the number of edges in the subset S (the invited nodes) must be even. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a subset S where the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe key idea here is that the parity of the number of edges in S is even. \n\nNow, the code's current approach is unclear. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe problem requires that the number of edges in the selected subset S must be even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for nodes not in S. \n\nTo maximize the sum of a_i for S (so that the unhappiness is minimized), we need to choose S with maximum possible a_i sum, and even number of edges. \n\nThe problem can be considered as a maximum weight independent set with a parity constraint on edges. \n\nHmm, but how to model this? \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in S can be adjusted by flipping the inclusion of certain nodes. \n\nSuppose that the optimal solution without the parity constraint is S0. If the number of edges in S0 is even, then that's the solution. If it's odd, then we need to find a way to flip some nodes to make it even, while losing as little a_i as possible. \n\nThe minimal loss would be the minimal (a_i + a_j - 2* something?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe difference between the maximum even and odd cases can be found by considering the edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a graph where each edge contributes to the parity. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample inputs and the code's current structure. \n\nLooking at the code's current work function: \n\nAfter reading the edges, it's storing x and y for each edge, and tracking the degree of each node. \n\nThen, the code checks if m is even, and sets ans to 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to handle the case where m is even, so the minimal possible is zero (if all are invited and a_i are zero). But that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to set ans to the minimal possible value when m is even, but that's not the case. \n\nThen, the code loops over nodes with odd degree. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where the degrees are considered. \n\nWait, the degree here is the number of friends each node has. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S must be even. \n\nSuppose that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe number of edges in S is the number of edges where both endpoints are in S. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where the edges are the friend pairs, and the selection of nodes must form a subset with even edges. \n\nThe key idea here is that the parity of the number of edges in S must be even. \n\nNow, the code's current approach is to loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, the degree here is the number of friends each node has. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where the degrees are considered. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a subset S where the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for nodes not in S. \n\nTo maximize the sum of a_i for S, we need to choose S with maximum possible a_i sum, and even edges. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node has a weight (a_i), and we need to choose a subset S with maximum weight such that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThis is similar to the maximum weight independent set problem with a parity constraint. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that the parity can be adjusted by flipping certain nodes. \n\nSuppose that the optimal solution without the parity constraint is S0. Let C0 be the number of edges in S0. \n\nIf C0 is even, then that's the solution. \n\nIf C0 is odd, then we need to find a way to flip some nodes so that the parity becomes even. \n\nThe minimal cost would be the minimal (sum of a_i for S0) minus the cost of flipping some nodes to make the parity even. \n\nThe flipping could involve adding or removing nodes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment can be found by considering edges or nodes that can change the parity. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe total number of edges in S can be written as the sum over all edges of (indicator if both endpoints are in S). \n\nThe parity is the sum modulo 2. \n\nWe need this sum mod 2 to be 0. \n\nThe problem is to maximize the sum of a_i for S, with this constraint. \n\nThis is a quadratic constraint, which is tricky. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each edge contributes to the parity, and we can model this with a flow network. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe problem can be considered as a graph where each node has a weight (a_i), and we want to choose a subset S with maximum weight such that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe key is to find the maximum between two cases: \n\n- The maximum weight subset with even edges. \n\n- The maximum weight subset with odd edges. \n\nBut we need the even case. \n\nThe difference between the two cases can be found by considering the edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a flow network where the parity is enforced via a parity constraint. \n\nHere's a possible approach inspired by the standard method for parity constraints in such problems: \n\nWe can model the problem as a flow network where the parity is tracked. \n\nThe idea is to split each node into two parts and use a parity node to enforce the constraint. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\n1. Create a source node and a sink node. \n\n2. For each node i, split it into two nodes: i and i'. \n\n3. Connect the source to node i with capacity a_i (since choosing to include the node gives us its a_i). \n\n4. Connect node i to node i' with an edge of capacity infinity (so that the flow must go through either i or i'). \n\n5. Connect node i' to the sink with capacity 0 (so that not choosing the node doesn't contribute). \n\nWait, but how does this enforce the parity? \n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach inspired by the standard method for parity constraints: \n\nWe can model the problem as a flow network where the parity is tracked via a parity node. \n\nThe steps are as follows: \n\n- Create a source (S) and a sink (T). \n\n- For each node i, create two nodes: i and i'. \n\n- Connect S to i with capacity a_i (the weight of including the node). \n\n- Connect i to i' with an edge of capacity infinity. \n\n- Connect i' to T with capacity 0. \n\n- Additionally, for each edge (u, v) in the original graph, we need to enforce that the number of such edges where both u and v are in S is even. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's constraints. \n\nThe key idea is that the parity of the number of edges in S must be even. \n\nSuppose that the optimal solution without the parity constraint is S0. Let C0 be the number of edges in S0. \n\nIf C0 is even, then that's our solution. \n\nIf C0 is odd, then we need to find a way to flip some nodes so that the parity becomes even. \n\nThe minimal cost would be the maximum between (sum of S0) and (sum of S0 minus some delta). \n\nThe delta would be the minimal cost to flip some nodes to change the parity. \n\nThe flipping could involve adding or removing nodes. \n\nFor example, flipping a single node would change the number of edges in S by the number of edges connected to that node. \n\nWait, but flipping a node (including it if it was excluded, or excluding it if it was included) would change the count of edges in S by the number of edges where the other endpoint is in S. \n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the minimum between two cases: \n\n1. The maximum subset with even edges. \n\n2. The maximum subset with odd edges, then subtract the minimal cost to flip to even. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the parity of the number of edges in the selected subset. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following variables: \n\nLet total be the sum of all a_i. \n\nThe unhappiness is total - sum_S a_i, where sum_S is the sum of a_i for invited nodes. \n\nWe need to maximize sum_S such that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe maximum sum_S can be either the maximum over all subsets with even edges, or the maximum over subsets with odd edges, whichever is better. \n\nWait, no. We have to choose even. \n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to compute the maximum between two possibilities: \n\n- The maximum subset with even edges. \n\n- The maximum subset with odd edges, but then we have to adjust it to even by flipping some nodes. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the parity of the number of edges in the entire graph. \n\nWait, the total number of edges in the graph is m. \n\nIf m is even, then the maximum possible sum_S is the sum of all a_i (if all are invited, then the number of edges is m, which is even). \n\nIf m is odd, then we need to exclude at least one edge's nodes to make the count even. \n\nWait, but excluding a node can affect multiple edges. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal adjustment is to find a pair of nodes whose exclusion would reduce the number of edges by an odd number, thus flipping the parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment is to find a single edge and exclude one of its endpoints. \n\nWait, this is getting too vague. \n\nLooking back at the code provided, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem using the degrees of the nodes. \n\nThe code has a loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, the degree here is the number of friends each node has. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where the degrees are considered. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe number of edges in S is the number of edges where both endpoints are in S. \n\nThe parity of this number must be even. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where the degrees are considered. \n\nWait, the degree of a node is the number of friends it has. \n\nSuppose that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in S is even. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a subset S where the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe maximum sum_S is the sum of a_i for nodes in S. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is total_a - sum_S. \n\nNow, the code's current approach is: \n\nAfter reading the edges and degrees, it checks if m is even, then sets ans to 0. \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to set ans to the minimal possible value when m is even. \n\nWait, the code's initial ans is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE. \n\nThen, if m is even, it sets ans to 0. \n\nBut that's only valid if the minimal unhappiness is zero, which requires that all a_i are zero and all are invited. \n\nSo that's probably incorrect. \n\nThen, the code loops over nodes with odd degree. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where the degrees must be even. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe number of edges in S is the number of edges where both endpoints are in S. \n\nThe parity of this number must be even. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nWait, no. The degrees in the original graph are the number of friends each has. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe code's current approach is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to model the problem using the degrees of the nodes. \n\nWait, the code has a loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nMaybe the idea is that the number of edges in S must be even, so the degrees of the nodes in S must have some parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nWait, the number of edges in S is the number of edges between nodes in S. \n\nThe degree of a node in S is the number of its friends also in S. \n\nThe sum of all degrees in S (counting each edge twice) must be even. \n\nBut the number of edges in S is (sum of degrees in S)/2. \n\nSo the parity of the number of edges in S is equal to the parity of (sum of degrees in S)/2. \n\nHmm, so the parity of the number of edges in S is equal to the parity of (sum of degrees in S) divided by 2. \n\nWait, but the sum of degrees in S is even, since each edge is counted twice. \n\nSo the number of edges in S is (sum of degrees in S)/2. \n\nThe parity of the number of edges is (sum of degrees in S)/2 mod 2. \n\nSo the parity of the number of edges in S is equal to (sum of degrees in S) mod 4 divided by 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the parity of the number of edges in S is equal to (sum of degrees in S) mod 2 divided by 2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the number of edges in S is equal to (sum of degrees in S) mod 2 divided by 2. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe number of edges in S is (sum of degrees in S) / 2. \n\nSo the parity of the number of edges is (sum of degrees in S) mod 2 divided by 2? \n\nWait, no. \n\nLet me think numerically: \n\nSuppose sum of degrees in S is 4 \u2192 edges are 2 \u2192 even. \n\nSum is 5 \u2192 edges 2.5 \u2192 impossible. \n\nWait, the sum of degrees in S must be even. \n\nSo the number of edges is an integer. \n\nThe parity of the number of edges is (sum of degrees in S)/2 mod 2. \n\nSo the parity of the number of edges is (sum of degrees in S mod 4)/2 mod 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the parity of the number of edges in S is equal to (sum of degrees in S) mod 2 divided by 2. \n\nWait, no. \n\nLet me see: \n\nsum_degrees = 2 \u2192 edges = 1 \u2192 parity 1 mod 2 \u2192 1 mod 2. \n\nsum_degrees mod 2 is 0 \u2192 edges mod 2 is 1 mod 2 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, this approach might not be helpful. \n\nPerhaps the code's current approach is trying to model the problem using the degrees of the nodes. \n\nThe code has a loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nMaybe the idea is that the number of edges in S must be even, so the degrees of the nodes in S must have some parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even, so the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nWait, the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe sum of degrees in S is twice the number of edges in S, so it must be even. \n\nSo the sum of degrees in S must be even. \n\nBut the sum of degrees in S is the sum of the degrees of the nodes in S, but each edge between two nodes in S is counted twice. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model this. \n\nThe code's current approach has a loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nPerhaps the idea is that the sum of degrees in S must be even. \n\nSo the sum of degrees of nodes in S must be even. \n\nThe sum of degrees of nodes in S is equal to twice the number of edges in S plus the number of edges from S to outside S. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe sum of degrees of nodes in S is equal to twice the number of edges within S plus the number of edges from S to outside S. \n\nSo the sum of degrees in S is even plus the number of edges from S to outside. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe sum of degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nBecause the number of edges in S is even, so twice that is even. \n\nThe sum of degrees in S is twice the number of edges in S plus the number of edges from S to outside. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily even. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is not the right path. \n\nLooking back at the code's current structure: \n\nThe code has a loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nThen, there's a loop over edges where both degrees are even, and then taking the sum of a[x] and a[y] as a candidate for ans. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find pairs of nodes whose exclusion can adjust the parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity. \n\nWait, the code's initial ans is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE. \n\nThen, if m is even, it sets ans to 0. \n\nBut that's probably wrong. \n\nThen, the code loops over nodes with odd degree. \n\nThe TODO is in that loop. \n\nThen, the code loops over edges where both degrees are even, and takes the sum of a[x] and a[y] as a candidate for ans. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to make the parity even. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe code's approach might be to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity. \n\nThe initial ans is set to the minimal possible value when the parity is even. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the minimal between two cases: \n\n1. The case where the number of edges is even. \n\n2. The case where the number of edges is odd, but we have to adjust it to even by excluding some nodes. \n\nThe code's current approach is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a graph and use a flow-based solution with a parity constraint. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the number of cakes (edges in S) is even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for nodes not in S. \n\nTo maximize the sum of a_i for S, we need to choose S with maximum possible a_i sum and even edges. \n\nThe key idea is that the parity of the number of edges in S must be even. \n\nThe optimal solution can be found by considering two cases: \n\n- The maximum subset with even edges. \n\n- The maximum subset with odd edges, then subtract the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity would be the minimal cost to add or remove nodes such that the parity changes. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal (a_i + a_j - 2* something?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal cost of flipping a single node or an edge. \n\nWait, flipping a node (including it if it was excluded, or excluding it if it was included) changes the number of edges in S by the number of edges between that node and other nodes in S. \n\nThis is complicated. \n\nPerhaps the problem can be solved by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal adjustment needed to make the parity even is the minimal cost of either: \n\n- Removing one node from S (if the current parity is odd), which would reduce the number of edges by the number of edges connected to that node within S. \n\nOr adding a node to S, which would increase the number of edges by the number of edges connected to it within S. \n\nBut this is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal cost to adjust the parity is the minimal cost of flipping the inclusion of a single node or an edge. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a bipartition and a parity node. \n\nHere's an idea inspired by the standard method for parity constraints in flow networks: \n\nWe can model the problem as a flow network where the parity is tracked via a parity node. \n\nThe steps are as follows: \n\n1. Create a source node (S) and a sink node (T). \n\n2. Create a parity node (P). \n\n3. Connect S to P with an edge of capacity 1 (since we need the parity to be even, so the flow through P must be even). \n\n4. For each node i: \n\n   a. Create two nodes, i and i'. \n\n   b. Connect S to i with capacity a_i (the weight of including the node). \n\n   c. Connect i to i' with an edge of capacity infinity. \n\n   d. Connect i' to T with capacity 0. \n\n5. For each edge (u, v) in the original graph: \n\n   a. Create a new node for this edge. \n\n   b. Connect u' to this node with capacity 1. \n\n   c. Connect v' to this node with capacity 1. \n\n   d. Connect this node to P with capacity 1. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach inspired by the problem's constraints and the code's current structure: \n\nThe code's current approach is to loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nPerhaps the degree here refers to the number of friends each node has. \n\nThe code's loop over nodes with odd degree suggests that the problem requires that the number of edges in S must be even. \n\nThe degree of a node is the number of friends it has. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where the degrees must be even. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe number of edges in S is the number of edges between nodes in S. \n\nThe sum of the degrees of the nodes in S is twice the number of edges in S plus the number of edges from S to outside S. \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in S is equal to the parity of (sum of degrees of nodes in S - edges from S to outside) divided by 2. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the problem can be solved by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the minimum between two cases: \n\n1. The case where the number of edges in S is even. \n\n2. The case where the number of edges in S is odd, but we have to adjust it to even by excluding one node or including one node. \n\nThe minimal adjustment would be the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal cost of flipping a single node or an edge. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal cost of excluding a node or including a node such that the parity changes. \n\nThe minimal cost would be the minimal a_i (if excluding a node) or the minimal cost to include a node (which would be -a_i, but since we want to maximize the sum, it's better to include nodes with high a_i). \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the minimal between the following two values: \n\n- The maximum possible sum of a_i for S with even edges. \n\n- The maximum possible sum of a_i for S with odd edges minus the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity would be the minimal cost of flipping a single node or an edge. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints and the code provided, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the missing code in the loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nThe code has a loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nThe TODO is inside this loop. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to track the parity of the number of edges in S. \n\nThe loop over nodes with odd degree suggests that the code is trying to handle nodes with odd degrees. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to find pairs of nodes with odd degrees and connect them somehow. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to make the degrees even. \n\nWait, the degree here is the number of friends each node has. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe number of edges in S is the number of edges between nodes in S. \n\nThe parity of this number must be even. \n\nThe code's current approach is to loop over nodes with odd degree. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where the degrees must be even. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe sum of the degrees of the nodes in S must be even (since each edge is counted twice). \n\nSo the sum of the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nThe sum of the degrees of the nodes in S is equal to twice the number of edges in S plus the number of edges from S to outside S. \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in S is even. \n\nThe sum of the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nSo the sum of the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the degrees of the nodes in S must be even. \n\nThe sum of the degrees of the nodes in S is even. \n\nThe sum of the degrees of the nodes in S is equal to the sum of the degrees of all nodes in S. \n\nThe degrees here are the number of friends each node has. \n\nWait, but the degrees are the number of friends each node has in the entire graph, not just in S. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the minimal between two cases: \n\n- The case where the number of edges in S is even. \n\n- The case where the number of edges in S is odd, but we have to exclude one node to make it even. \n\nThe minimal cost would be the minimal a_i among all nodes. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to make the number of edges even. \n\nThe code's current approach has a loop
