Division 4 is below 1400. So the existing code's first if statement handles Division 1. Then the next elif is checking if it's >=1600. But since the first condition (>=1900) already caught those, this elif is for 1600 to 1899, right? So that should be Division 2. So the code here should print 'Division 2' in that block. But the current code has a TODO there. So the missing line is print('Division 2'). Then the next elif is >=1400, which would cover 1400 up to 1599, which is Division 3. That's already correct.",
