      "text": "Okay, I need to complete the Python code for this problem. Let's see what the problem is asking. The task is to determine which division a Codeforces user is in based on their rating. The divisions are divided as follows: Division 1: rating >= 1900\nDivision 2: 1600 to 1899\nDivision 3: 1400 to 1599\nDivision 4: less than 1400 So for each input rating, I have to check these conditions and print the correct division. The code given starts with a loop for the number of test cases. The input is read as an integer t, then for each test case, we read a rating. The TODO is where I need to insert the code. Hmm, the steps I need to do for each test case are:\n\n1. Read the rating value. 2. Evaluate which division it belongs to. 3. Print \"Division X\" where X is 1-4.\n\nLet me think about the logic structure. Maybe using if-elif-else statements. So, first, read the rating:\n\nrating = int(input()) Then check:\n\nif rating >= 1900:\n    print(\"Division 1\") elif 1600 <= rating <= 1899:\n    print(\"Division 2\")\nelif 1400 <= rating <= 1599:\n    print(\"Division 3\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Division 4\") Wait, that should cover all cases. Let me check the notes examples. For example, the first test case with -789 would go to else, division 4. The 1399 is also else. 1400 is division3. 1679 is division2, 2300 division1. That matches the examples. So putting that into the code. The existing loop is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo inside the loop, first read the rating. So the code would be:\n\nrating = int(input()) if rating >= 1900:\n    print(\"Division 1\")\nelif 1600 <= rating <= 1899:\n    print(\"Division 2\")\nelif 1400 <= rating <= 1599:\n    print(\"Division 3\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Division 4\") That's the code that should replace the TODO. Let me make sure there are no off-by-one errors. Like 1600 is division2, which is correct. 1899 same. 1600-1899 is division2. Then 1400 is division3.",
