      "text": "Because if I check for division 2 first but the rating is 1900, it would incorrectly go to division 2 unless the checks are in the right order. So the order of conditions should be from highest to lowest. So first check if it's division 1, then 2, then 3, else 4. So code steps:\n\nRead the rating. Check if rating >=1900 \u2192 print Division 1.\n\nElse if (rating >=1600 && rating <=1899) \u2192 Division2. Else if (rating >=1400 && <=1599) \u2192 Division3. Else \u2192 Division4. Alternatively, since each condition is mutually exclusive, the else chain should work. Now, coding this in C++.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint rating;\nscanf(\"%d\", &rating);\n\nThen the if-else structure. So:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    printf(\"Division 1\\n\");\n} else if (rating >=1600) {\n    printf(\"Division 2\\n\");\n} else if (rating >=1400) {\n    printf(\"Division 3\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Division 4\\n\");\n} Wait, because the second condition is 1600-1899. Since if it's >=1600 but less than 1900 (since first condition failed), then it's in 2. That works. Similarly, the third condition: if it's not in 2 or 1, then if >=1400, it's division3. Else, division4. Yes, that should work. Because:\n\nFor example, 1399 would go to else if (1400? no, so else to division4. 1400 would hit the third condition (>=1400 \u2192 division3.\n\n1600 would hit the second condition. 1899 same as second.\n\n1900 first. So that logic is correct. So putting that code inside the loop. So the missing code is:\n\nint rating;\nscanf(\"%d\", &rating);\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    printf(\"Division 1\\n\");\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    printf(\"Division 2\\n\");\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    printf(\"Division 3\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Division 4\\n\");\n}\n\nI need to make sure that the printf statements are correct, with the exact capitalization and spacing. The problem says \"Division X\" so the output must match exactly. The code uses printf, which is correct since the code uses stdio. Testing the sample inputs:\n\nLike the note says, for 1399, it's division4. Let's see:\n\n1399: the first three conditions are no. So else, division4. Correct. 1400: third condition (>=1400 \u2192 yes, so division3.\n\n1679: in the second condition (>=1600, and since first condition failed, it's division2.\n\n2300 \u2192 division1. All correct. What about a rating lower than 1400, like 1300 \u2192 division4. Edge cases: exactly 1600 \u2192 division2. 1599 \u2192 division3. Yes. So the code should work.",
