The problem is about determining if a given array can be obtained through a series of specific operations. The operations involve moving a pointer and incrementing or decrementing elements. The key points are:\n\nThe pointer starts at the first element. The operations are:\n1. If not on the last element, increase current by 1, then move to next. 2. If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous. And after all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.",

Each operation moves the pointer either forward or backward. But each operation also changes the array. Wait, perhaps the key is to model the net effect of the operations on the array and the pointer's path. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the array that must be satisfied for it to be possible. Let's think of the required conditions. Let me look at the sample input given in the note. The second test case example's final array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. How did that happen? The example steps show that they moved forward and backward, adjusting the values. Hmm, perhaps the array must satisfy certain properties. Let me think of the process as a path where each step is either moving forward (operation 1) or backward (operation 2).

Let me think of the following approach: \n\nThe key is that the array must satisfy two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of all elements is zero. 2. The cumulative sum of the array from the start must not exceed certain limits. Wait, perhaps the cumulative sum when traversing the array from left to right must not be negative? Alternatively, let me think of the path's movement. Suppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves that can be broken down into \"up\" and \"down\" phases. Alternatively, here's a different approach inspired by some similar problems. Let me consider the following: \n\nLet me define a variable that tracks the current position. The pointer starts at 0. Each operation either moves it right or left. The total displacement must be zero. The array a[i] is equal to (number of times you moved right from i) minus (number of times you moved left from i). Now, the path must form a closed loop. Let me think of the path as a walk. Let me model the required conditions for the array. Suppose I track the path's position over time. Let me think of the path as a sequence of positions. Let me consider the difference between the number of right and left steps at each position.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the Java code for this problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given array can be obtained through a series of specific operations. The operations involve moving a pointer and incrementing or decrementing elements. The key points are:\n\nThe pointer starts at the first element. The operations are:\n1. If not on the last element, increase current by 1, then move to next.\n2. If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous.\n\nAnd after all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.\n\nHmm, so the main thing is to model the possible sequences of moves and see if the target array can be achieved under these constraints.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. Since the pointer must end at the first element, the path taken must form some kind of loop that brings it back. \n\nLet me think of the operations as steps. Each operation moves the pointer either forward or backward. But each operation also changes the array. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the net effect of the operations on the array and the pointer's path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the array that must be satisfied for it to be possible. Let's think of the required conditions.\n\nLet me look at the sample input given in the note. The second test case example's final array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. How did that happen?\n\nThe example steps show that they moved forward and backward, adjusting the values. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array must satisfy certain properties. Let me think of the process as a path where each step is either moving forward (operation 1) or backward (operation 2). The pointer starts at position 0 and must end at 0. \n\nEach time you do an operation 1, you increase the current element and move right. Each operation 2 decreases current and moves left. \n\nThe total number of steps moving right and left must balance such that the net movement is zero. But how does this affect the array?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array's elements can be represented in terms of the path taken. Let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Each time you go forward, you add 1 to the current cell, then move. Each backward step subtracts 1 and moves left. \n\nWait, but the pointer's position after each step depends on the direction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the array's elements can be determined by the number of times the pointer passed through each cell in each direction. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let's model the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer moved right through a cell and the number of times it moved left through it. \n\nWait, perhaps each time you move right from position i to i+1, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you move left from i to i-1, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nWait, the operation 1: when you are at position i (not last), you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. So the step is: a[i] +=1, then move right. \n\nOperation 2: when at position i (not first), subtract 1 from a[i], then move left. \n\nSo the total value of a[i] is equal to the number of times you moved right from i minus the number of times you moved left into i? Or maybe the net difference between the times you passed through in each direction?\n\nHmm, perhaps the array's elements can be represented as the difference between the number of right steps leaving the cell and left steps entering it. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the path as a sequence of moves. Let's think of the path as a walk starting at 0, ending at 0, and each step is either +1 (right) or -1 (left), but with constraints (can't go beyond 0 or n-1). \n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of operations in any order, so the path can be any such walk that starts and ends at 0. \n\nThe key is that the array a must be achievable through such a walk, where each right step (when moving from i to i+1) contributes +1 to a[i], and each left step (moving from i to i-1) contributes -1 to a[i]. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each time you perform an operation 1 (right move), you add 1 to the current cell before moving. So each right move from position i adds 1 to a[i]. Each left move (operation 2) subtracts 1 from the current cell (position i) before moving left. \n\nTherefore, the total value of a[i] is equal to the number of times you moved right from i minus the number of times you moved left into i? Or perhaps the number of times you took a right step from i minus the number of left steps arriving at i?\n\nAlternatively, the total a[i] is equal to (number of times you moved right from i) minus (number of times you moved left from i+1 to i). \n\nHmm, maybe it's better to model the array as the difference between the number of right steps leaving each position and left steps arriving there. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let's denote the path as a sequence of positions. Each step is either R (right) or L (left). The path starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nEach R step from position i contributes +1 to a[i], and each L step from position i (moving to i-1) contributes -1 to a[i]. \n\nTherefore, the total a[i] is equal to the number of R steps at i minus the number of L steps at i. \n\nWait, yes. Because every time you do an R step from i, you add 1 to a[i]. Every time you do an L step from i (i.e., moving left from i to i-1), you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nTherefore, the total a[i] is (number of R steps at i) - (number of L steps at i). \n\nNow, the path must start at 0 and end at 0. Let's think of the path as a walk where each step is either R or L, but with the constraints that you can't go beyond the array's bounds. \n\nBut how does this help us find the conditions for the array a?\n\nThe problem is to determine if such a path exists such that for each i, a[i] = (R_i - L_i), where R_i is the number of R steps taken from i, and L_i is the number of L steps taken from i. \n\nAdditionally, the path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. Let me think of the path's steps and how they affect the positions. \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. Let's denote the path as a sequence of positions. Let's say the path is a sequence of positions p_0, p_1, ..., p_m, where p_0 = 0 and p_m =0. \n\nEach step from p_k to p_{k+1} is either +1 (R) or -1 (L). \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times you took a step to the right from i is R_i, and the number of times you took a step to the left from i is L_i. \n\nThe total a[i] is R_i - L_i. \n\nAlso, the total number of steps must form a path that starts and ends at 0. \n\nNow, the key is to find conditions on the a array such that these equations can be satisfied. \n\nLet me think of the path's movement. The total displacement must be zero (since it starts and ends at 0). \n\nThe total number of R steps minus the number of L steps must be zero. Because each R contributes +1 to displacement, each L contributes -1. So total R - L =0. \n\nBut the sum of all a[i] must be equal to (sum over R_i) - (sum over L_i) = (R_total - L_total) =0. \n\nWait, that's an important point. The sum of all a[i] must be zero. Because each R_i contributes +1 to a[i], each L_i contributes -1. So the total sum is (sum R_i) - (sum L_i) = (R_total - L_total) =0. \n\nTherefore, the first condition is that the sum of all elements in the array must be zero. \n\nBut the sample input's second test case has sum 2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0, so that's okay. \n\nThe first test case in the note must have a sum not zero? Wait the note says \"NoteIn the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" So perhaps the first test case's array has a non-zero sum, so it's invalid. \n\nSo the first condition is that the sum of the array must be zero. \n\nBut that's necessary but not sufficient. \n\nWhat other conditions are there?\n\nLet me think of the path's movement. Let's model the path as a walk. Let's think of the path's steps and how the a[i] must be formed. \n\nAnother idea: the path must form a closed loop starting and ending at 0. So the path must be such that the number of times you go right and left balance out. \n\nBut how does this affect the a array?\n\nLet me think of the path's steps. Let's consider the cumulative steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy certain inequalities. For example, the path can't go beyond the array's boundaries, so the path can't go to position -1 or n. \n\nWait, but the problem allows moving as long as the pointer is not on the last element for R steps, etc. So the path can't have steps that go beyond the array. \n\nHmm, but how does that translate into conditions on the a array?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a's elements up to some point must not be too negative or something. \n\nWait, let me think of the path's movement. Let's model the path as a sequence of steps. Let me think of the path's position over time. \n\nSuppose we track the position as we go through the steps. Let me think of the path as a walk where each step is either +1 or -1, but constrained by the array's boundaries. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the required a array in terms of the path's steps. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the required a array in terms of the path's \"height\" or something. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let me consider the difference between consecutive elements. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let me consider the differences between a[i] and a[i+1], but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the required conditions step by step. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me consider the net effect on the array. \n\nEach time you move right from position i, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you move left from i, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nThe total a[i] is R_i - L_i. \n\nNow, the path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me denote the number of times you are at position i and move right as R_i, and the number of times you move left from i as L_i. \n\nThe total a[i] = R_i - L_i. \n\nAlso, the path must form a closed loop. \n\nNow, for each position i (except 0 and n-1?), the number of times you enter i must equal the number of times you leave it. \n\nWait, except for the start and end (which are both 0). \n\nHmm, the path starts at 0 and ends at 0. So the total number of times you leave 0 must equal the number of times you enter it, except for the initial position. \n\nWait, perhaps the in-degree and out-degree for each node must balance except for the start/end. \n\nAlternatively, for each position i except 0, the number of times you enter i must equal the number of times you leave it. \n\nBecause every time you enter a position (except the start), you must leave it again. \n\nWait, let's think of the path as a walk. For any position except the start and end, the number of times you enter equals the number of times you leave. Since the start and end are the same (0), the total for 0 must have one more exit than entry? Or maybe not. \n\nHmm, perhaps the total number of times you leave 0 must equal the number of times you enter it, except for the initial position. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of times you leave 0 is equal to the number of times you enter it plus 1 (since you start there). \n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me model the required conditions for the a array. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let me consider the path's movement. \n\nLet me think of the path as a series of moves. Let me track the position and the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the required a array in terms of the path's \"height\" or the cumulative steps. \n\nWait, here's an alternative approach inspired by some similar problems. Let me think of the required a array as needing to satisfy certain conditions based on the path's movement. \n\nSuppose that the path must form a closed loop starting and ending at 0. Let me consider the path's \"height\" as the current position. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. \n\nNow, the a array's elements can be thought of as the difference between the number of times you went right from each position and left from it. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nAnother idea: Let me consider the path's movement and track the cumulative steps. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me denote the path as a sequence of positions p_0, p_1, ..., p_m where p_0 = p_m =0. \n\nEach step from p_k to p_{k+1} is either +1 or -1. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times you moved right from i is R_i, and the number of times you moved left from i is L_i. \n\nThe a[i] = R_i - L_i. \n\nNow, the total number of right steps must equal the total number of left steps (since the path starts and ends at 0). \n\nSo sum over all R_i = sum over all L_i. \n\nBut that's already implied by the sum of a[i] being zero. \n\nHmm. \n\nNow, let's think of the path's movement. For each position i, the number of times you enter i must equal the number of times you leave it, except for the starting point (0). \n\nWait, except for the start and end (which are the same), so the start has one more exit than entry. \n\nWait, the path starts at 0, so the first step is an exit from 0. The end is also 0, so the last step is an entry into 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the total number of exits from 0 is equal to the number of entries into 0. \n\nWait, the path starts at 0, so the first step is an exit. The last step is an entry into 0. \n\nSo the total exits from 0 is equal to the entries into 0 plus 1? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, for each position i except 0, the number of times you enter i must equal the number of times you leave it. \n\nFor position 0, the number of exits must equal the number of entries plus 1 (since you start there). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTotal exits from 0: R_0 (number of right steps from 0) plus L_0 (number of left steps from 0? Wait no, left steps from 0 can't happen because you can't go left from 0. \n\nWait, the left steps from 0 are impossible. So L_0 =0. \n\nWait, the left steps can only be done from positions 1 to n-1. \n\nSo for position 0, the exits are only R_0 (right steps). \n\nThe entries into 0 can only come from position 1 via a left step. \n\nSo the number of entries into 0 is equal to the number of left steps from 1 (L_1). \n\nThe exits from 0 is R_0. \n\nSo for position 0: exits (R_0) must equal entries (L_1) plus 1 (the initial position). \n\nWait, because the path starts at 0, so the first exit is R_0's first step. The total exits from 0 must equal the entries into 0 (from position 1) plus 1 (the initial position's exit). \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a walk and model the required conditions for the a array. \n\nLet me think of the path's movement and how the a array is built. \n\nSuppose I track the current position and the steps taken. \n\nEach time I move right from position i, a[i] increases by 1. \n\nEach time I move left from position i, a[i] decreases by 1. \n\nThe total a[i] is the net of these. \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nLet me consider the path's movement and the cumulative effect on the array. \n\nAnother idea: Let's model the required a array in terms of the path's \"height\" and the steps taken. \n\nSuppose we track the current position and the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start up to some point must not be negative. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nLet me think of the path as a series of moves. Let me consider the difference between the required a array and the path's steps. \n\nSuppose that the path must form a closed loop. Let me think of the required a array as needing to have certain properties. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe key is that the array must satisfy two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of all elements is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum of the array from the start must not exceed certain limits. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum when traversing the array from left to right must not be negative? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves that can be broken down into \"up\" and \"down\" phases. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by some similar problems. \n\nLet me consider the following: \n\nLet me define a variable that tracks the current position. \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. \n\nEach operation either moves it right or left. \n\nThe total displacement must be zero. \n\nThe array a[i] is equal to (number of times you moved right from i) minus (number of times you moved left from i). \n\nNow, the path must form a closed loop. \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk. Let me model the required conditions for the array. \n\nSuppose I track the path's position over time. Let me think of the path as a sequence of positions. \n\nLet me consider the difference between the number of right and left steps at each position. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the first element to the ith must be non-negative? \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we model the path as a walk where each step is either +1 or -1. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. \n\nThe array a[i] is equal to (number of times you stepped right from i) minus (number of times you stepped left from i). \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nLet me think of the path's movement. \n\nLet me consider the path's \"height\" as the current position. \n\nThe path starts at 0, ends at 0. \n\nThe array a[i] can be thought of as the net number of times the path went right from i minus left from i. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required a array such that the path can be constructed without going out of bounds. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nLet me think of the required conditions as follows: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[i] from the first element up to the ith must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end backwards must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. To return to 0, the path must have a certain structure. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves that can be broken down into \"up\" and \"down\" phases. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach. Let me think of the required a array in terms of the path's steps. \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nEach step either increases current_position by 1 (R) or decreases by 1 (L). \n\nThe a array is built by adding 1 to the current position before moving right, or subtracting 1 before moving left. \n\nWait, no. Each R step adds 1 to the current cell before moving. Each L step subtracts 1 from current cell before moving left. \n\nSo the a array is the result of all these operations. \n\nNow, the problem is to see if there exists a path (sequence of R and L steps) that starts and ends at 0, such that the a array is exactly the result of all these operations. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of the a array as the difference between the number of R steps and L steps at each position. \n\nNow, the path must form a closed loop. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop, so the number of R steps must equal the number of L steps. \n\nThe sum of a[i] must be zero. \n\nAdditionally, the path must not go out of bounds. \n\nBut how to model the other conditions? \n\nAnother idea: Let me model the required a array as follows. \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. Let me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nLet me think of the required a array as the difference between the number of times you passed through each position in each direction. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's note. \n\nThe sample explanation shows that the array can have negative values. \n\nWait, the second test case's array has elements 2, -1, -1, 0. \n\nThe sum is zero. \n\nSo the first condition is sum zero. \n\nBut what about other conditions? \n\nLet me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose that the path must form a closed loop. \n\nLet me think of the path's \"height\" as the current position. \n\nThe path starts at 0, ends at 0. \n\nThe array a[i] is the net number of times you moved right from i minus left from i. \n\nNow, the path must never go beyond the array's bounds. \n\nSo the maximum position reached must be less than n. \n\nBut how does that translate into conditions on the array? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[0..i] must be non-negative? \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of steps. \n\nLet me think of the path's position over time. \n\nLet me model the required a array in terms of the path's steps. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nEach step is either R or L. \n\nEach R step adds 1 to a[current_position], then current_position increases by 1. \n\nEach L step subtracts 1 from a[current_position], then current_position decreases by 1. \n\nThe final current_position must be 0. \n\nThe problem is to see if the given a array can be obtained through such steps. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the path's steps in terms of the a array. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can model the required path as a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe total number of R steps from position i is R_i, and L steps from i is L_i. \n\nThen a[i] = R_i - L_i. \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nThe total R steps must equal the total L steps. \n\nNow, the path's movement must form a closed loop. \n\nLet me think of the path's steps as a sequence. \n\nLet me consider the path's movement and track the current position. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[0..i] must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample. \n\nLet me think of the path's movement as a walk where the net steps must form a closed loop. \n\nThe array a must be such that the path can be constructed without going out of bounds. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nLet me consider the path's movement and model the required conditions. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array is built by the steps taken. \n\nNow, the key is to model the required a array such that the path can be constructed. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. \n\nThe a array must have sum zero. \n\nAdditionally, the path must not go out of bounds. \n\nBut how to model the other conditions? \n\nPerhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[i] from the first element up to the ith must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nLet me think of the path's position as a function of time. \n\nThe path starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nThe array a[i] is the net number of times the path moved right from i minus left from i. \n\nNow, the path must never go beyond the array's bounds. \n\nSo the maximum position reached must be less than n. \n\nBut how to translate this into conditions on the array? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[0..i] must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nLet me think of the path's position as a sequence of steps. \n\nLet me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nEach step is either R or L. \n\nEach R step adds 1 to a[current_position], then moves to current_position +1. \n\nEach L step subtracts 1 from a[current_position], then moves to current_position -1. \n\nThe final position must be 0. \n\nThe problem is to see if the given a array can be obtained through such steps. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the path's steps in terms of the a array. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nLet me model the path's steps as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nThe a array is the result of the steps taken. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nNow, the key is to find a way to model the required conditions. \n\nAnother idea: Let me think of the path's movement as a walk where the net steps must form a closed loop. \n\nThe array a must be such that the path can be constructed without going out of bounds. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop, so the number of R steps must equal the number of L steps. \n\nThe sum of a[i] must be zero. \n\nAdditionally, the path must never go beyond the array's bounds. \n\nTo ensure that the path doesn't go out of bounds, the cumulative steps must not exceed n-1. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nPerhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[0..i] must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. \n\nThe balance represents the current position. \n\nEach R step increases the current position by 1, and adds 1 to a[i]. \n\nEach L step decreases the current position by 1, and subtracts 1 from a[i]. \n\nWait, but the a array is the result of all these operations. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nWe can model the path as a walk where the current position must never exceed n-1 or go below 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nThe problem is to determine if such a walk exists. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can model the required conditions as follows: \n\nThe sum of the array must be zero. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum of the array from the first element to the ith must be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nLet me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nThe path starts at 0. \n\nEach time you move right, you increase the current position. \n\nEach time you move left, you decrease it. \n\nThe a array is the net of these steps. \n\nNow, the path must never go beyond the array's bounds. \n\nSo the maximum position reached must be less than n. \n\nBut how to model this?

\n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nLet me consider the path's movement and track the current position. \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nThe a array is the result of the steps taken. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nNow, the key is to model the required conditions. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. \n\nThe balance represents the current position. \n\nEach R step increases the current position by 1, and adds 1 to a[i]. \n\nEach L step decreases the current position by 1, and subtracts 1 from a[i]. \n\nWait, but the a array is the result of all these operations. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nLet me think of the path's movement as a walk where the current position is tracked. \n\nThe path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nThe key is to model the required conditions. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[0..i] must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nThe path starts at 0. \n\nEach time you move right, you increase the current position. \n\nEach time you move left, you decrease it. \n\nThe a array is the net of these steps. \n\nNow, the path must never go out of bounds. \n\nSo the current position must never exceed n-1 or go below 0. \n\nThe a array must be such that the path can be constructed without violating these bounds. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following conditions must be met: \n\nThe sum of the array must be zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum of the array from the first element to the ith must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following example: \n\nSuppose the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums are: \n\n2 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 0. \n\nAll are non-negative. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSuppose the array is [1, -1]. \n\nSum is zero. \n\nCumulative sums are 1, 0. \n\nThis is okay. \n\nBut what if the array is [ -1, 1 ]? \n\nSum is zero. \n\nCumulative sums are -1, 0 \u2192 the first is negative \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo this array would be invalid. \n\nSo the condition that the cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative is necessary. \n\nAdditionally, perhaps the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative? \n\nWait, let me think of the array [1, -1]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end (starting from the last element) would be 0, then 0. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative sum from the first element must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end (starting from the last element) would be 0, then -1, then 1, then 3. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative sum from the first element must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach: \n\nThe array must satisfy two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of all elements is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum of the array from the first element to the ith must be non-negative for all i. \n\n3. The cumulative sum of the array from the ith element to the last must be non-negative for all i. \n\nWait, but how to model the second condition? \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nLet me think of the first condition: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nThis ensures that the path never goes below 0. \n\nThe second condition is that the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the second condition is that the cumulative sum from the end must be non-negative. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the first element is: \n\n2 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end (starting from the last element) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 -1 \u2192 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 but this includes negative values. \n\nHmm, so that approach might not work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative sum from the first element must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the second condition is that the cumulative sum from the ith element to the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end (starting from the last element) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 (0 + -1) \u2192 -1 \u2192 ( -1 + -1) \u2192 -2 \u2192 ( -2 + 2) \u2192 0. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative sum from the first element must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the first element up to each position is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end backwards must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the first element is 2, 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end (starting from the last element) would be 0, then -1 (0 + -1), then 1 ( -1 + -1?), no. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second condition is that the cumulative sum from the ith element to the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the first element is okay. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end: \n\nThe last element is 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe third element is -1, but the sum from the third to end is -1 +0 = -1 \u2192 which is negative. \n\nSo this would violate the condition. \n\nBut the sample is valid. \n\nSo that approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. \n\nLet me think of the problem differently. \n\nLet me think of the path's movement and the required a array. \n\nThe path starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nEach R step from position i adds 1 to a[i], then moves to i+1. \n\nEach L step from position i subtracts 1 from a[i], then moves to i-1. \n\nThe total a[i] is R_i - L_i. \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nNow, the path's movement can be represented as a sequence of steps. \n\nLet me think of the path's movement as a series of moves that can be represented as a string of R and L steps. \n\nThe path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe a array is the result of these steps. \n\nNow, the key is to find conditions on the a array such that such a path exists. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nNow, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe total number of R steps must equal the number of L steps. \n\nThe sum of a[i] must be zero. \n\nAdditionally, the path must never go out of bounds. \n\nTo ensure that the path doesn't go out of bounds, the current position must never exceed n-1 or go below 0. \n\nThe path's movement must be such that the current position never exceeds these bounds. \n\nNow, how to model this in terms of the a array? \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nThe path must be such that the cumulative steps never exceed the array's bounds. \n\nLet me think of the path's movement as a walk where the current position is tracked. \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nThe a array is the result of the steps taken. \n\nThe key is to model the required conditions. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nNow, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe a array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of the array from the first element to the ith must be non-negative. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum from the ith element to the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the following conditions are necessary and sufficient: \n\n1. The sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative. \n\n3. The cumulative sum from the ith element to the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me test this with the sample array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the first element: \n\n2 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the ith element to the end: \n\nFor i=0: 2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=1: -1 + (-1)+0 =-2 \u2192 which is negative \u2192 violates condition 3. \n\nHmm, so this would be invalid, but the sample is valid. \n\nSo this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the path's movement and the a array. \n\nSuppose that the path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nThe a array is the result of the steps taken. \n\nThe path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe key is to find conditions on the a array such that such a path exists. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe a array must be such that the path can be constructed without going out of bounds. \n\nThe path's movement can be represented as a series of steps. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nNow, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe a array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of the array from the first element to the ith must be non-negative. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum from the ith element to the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but the sample array's cumulative sum from the second element is -1 + -1 +0 =-2, which is negative. \n\nSo this approach is not working. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum from the end is computed in a different way. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nThe a array must be such that the path can be constructed without going out of bounds. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nThe path's movement must never go out of bounds. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nThe key is to model the required conditions. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current_position' which starts at 0. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array must be the result of the steps taken. \n\nNow, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe a array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of the array from the first element to the ith must be non-negative. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum from the ith element to the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but the sample array's cumulative sum from the second element is -1 + -1 +0 =-2 \u2192 which is negative. \n\nSo this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nLet me think of the sample array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe path in the sample explanation is: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes -1). \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 2). \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 0). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to -1? No, can't move left from 0. \n\nWait, the sample explanation's path is: \n\nThe steps are: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nR: a[0] becomes 1, move to 1. \n\nL: a[1] becomes -1, move to 0. \n\nR: a[0] becomes 2, move to 1. \n\nR: a[1] becomes 0, move to 2. \n\nL: a[2] becomes -1, move to 1. \n\nL: a[1] becomes -1, move to 0. \n\nL: can't move left from 0. \n\nWait, the sample explanation's path ends at 0. \n\nThe final array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe path's steps are: \n\nThe steps taken are: \n\nR, L, R, R, L, L, L? \n\nWait, the sample explanation's path is: \n\nThe steps are: \n\nInitial: [0,0,0,0], pointer at 0. \n\nStep 1: R \u2192 a[0] becomes 1, move to 1. \n\nStep 2: L \u2192 a[1] becomes -1, move to 0. \n\nStep 3: R \u2192 a[0] becomes 2, move to 1. \n\nStep 4: R \u2192 a[1] becomes 0, move to 2. \n\nStep 5: L \u2192 a[2] becomes -1, move to 1. \n\nStep 6: L \u2192 a[1] becomes -1, move to 0. \n\nStep 7: R \u2192 can't move right from 3? \n\nWait, the final array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe steps taken are: \n\nThe path is: \n\n0 \u21921 \u21920 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920 \u2192 etc.? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nThe key is that the path must end at 0. \n\nThe a array is the result of all the steps taken. \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nNow, the key is to find conditions on the a array. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation: \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe a array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of the array from the first element to the ith must be non-negative. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum from the ith element to the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but the sample array's cumulative sum from the second element is
