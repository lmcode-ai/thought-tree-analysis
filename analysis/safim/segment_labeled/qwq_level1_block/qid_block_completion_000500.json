The first 3 elements are 5,4,3. The sum from index 1 to 2 (elements 4 and 3) would be 7. The prefix array would be [0,5,9,12,14,15]. So the sum from 1 to 2 is prefix[3] - prefix[1] = 12 -5 =7. So yes, that works.\n\nSo for a query x and y, the required sum is the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements. The first x elements are p[0] to p[x-1]. The last y elements are from (x - y) to (x-1). So the sum is prefix[x] - prefix[x - y].\n\nWait, because the sum from 0 to x-1 is prefix[x], and subtract the sum from 0 to (x - y -1), which is prefix[x - y]. So the difference is the sum from (x - y) to (x-1).\n\nTherefore, the key is to precompute the prefix sum array. Then for each query, the answer is prefix[x] - prefix[x - y].\n\nLooking back at the code provided, the code after sorting the array has a loop from j=1 to n-1, which is probably where the prefix sum is supposed to be computed. Let's see:\n\nIn the code:\n\nAfter sorting, there's a loop for(j=1; j <n; j++) { /* TODO */ }\n\nSo the idea is to precompute the prefix sum here. Let's see:\n\nThe prefix array can be stored in the same array p, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using p as the prefix array. Wait, the code's p is an array of long long ints. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's p is declared as long int p[n], and after sorting, the loop is for j from 1 to n-1. So perhaps the code is trying to compute a prefix sum array here. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the code is supposed to compute a prefix array. Let me see:\n\nThe initial code's loop is:\n\nfor(j=1; j <n; j++) {\n    // TODO\n}\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to compute a prefix sum array here. Let's see:\n\nThe first element of the prefix is p[0], then p[1] = p[0] + p[1], etc. Wait, but the array p is being modified here. Wait, maybe the code is trying to make p[j] store the sum up to j elements. Let me think:\n\nSuppose that after sorting, the array p is in descending order. Then, the prefix sum can be computed as:\n\nprefix[0] = p[0]\n\nprefix[1] = p[0] + p[1]\n\nprefix[2] = p[0] + p[1] + p[2], etc.\n\nSo the code can precompute this in the loop. Let's see:\n\nThe code's p array is already sorted. So for j from 1 to n-1, we can do p[j] += p[j-1]. That way, p[j] will hold the sum of the first j+1 elements? Wait, no. Wait, if j starts at 1 (assuming 0-based), then for j=1, p[1] += p[0], so p[1] becomes p[0]+p[1], which is the sum of first two elements. Then for j=2, p[2] += p[1], which would be p[2] + (sum of first two), so that would be sum of first three. So yes, this way, after the loop, p[j] will hold the sum of the first (j+1) elements? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the initial array after sorting is p[0], p[1], p[2], ..., p[n-1].\n\nThe loop starts at j=1. For each j, p[j] += p[j-1]. So after the first iteration (j=1), p[1] = p[0] + p[1]. Then j=2, p[2] += p[1], which is p[2] + (p0+p1) \u2192 sum of first 3 elements. So after the loop, p[j] will hold the sum of the first (j+1) elements? Wait, no, the first element is p[0], so for j=0, it's just p[0]. For j=1, it's p[0]+p[1], which is sum of first 2 elements. So p[j] is the sum of the first (j+1) elements. Wait, but the index is j. So the sum up to index j (inclusive) is p[j]. So the prefix array can be considered as p, where p[i] is the sum of the first (i+1) elements. Wait, but that's not exactly standard. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using p as the prefix array, where p[i] is the sum of the first i elements (with 1-based). Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have the array after sorting as p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1].\n\nWe can create a prefix array where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements (so prefix[0] =0, prefix[1] = p[0], prefix[2] = p[0]+p[1], etc). Then the sum from a to b (0-based) is prefix[b+1] - prefix[a].\n\nBut in the code, perhaps they are reusing the p array to store the prefix sum. Let me see:\n\nIf the code does:\n\nfor (j=1; j <n; j++) {\n\n    p[j] += p[j-1];\n\n}\n\nThen after this, p[j] will be the sum of the first (j+1) elements? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal p after sorting: p[0], p[1], p[2], ..., p[n-1]\n\nAfter the loop:\n\np[0] remains as is.\n\np[1] = p[1] + p[0]\n\np[2] = p[2] + p[1] (which is p[2] + (p[0]+p[1]) \u2192 sum of first 3 elements)\n\nSo yes, after the loop, p[j] is the sum of the first (j+1) elements. Wait, no, p[0] is the first element. p[1] is sum of first two, p[2] sum of first three, etc. So p[j] is the sum of the first (j+1) elements. So to get the sum of the first x elements (since x is given in the query), we can use p[x-1], but wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose x is 3. The first 3 elements are p[0], p[1], p[2]. The sum is p[2] (since after the loop, p[2] is p0+p1+p2). So for x=3, the sum is p[2], which is p[3-1] (since x-1 is 2). So in general, the sum of the first x elements is p[x-1].\n\nTherefore, the sum from a to b (0-based indices a to b) would be p[b] - p[a-1], but only if a>0. If a is 0, then it's p[b].\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose a is 1 (0-based) and b is 2. The sum is p[2] - p[0] (since p[0] is the sum up to index 0). Wait, no. Wait, the sum from a=1 to b=2 is p[2] (sum up to 2) minus p[0] (sum up to 0). So yes, that works.\n\nSo the formula would be sum(a to b) = p[b] - (a ==0 ? 0 : p[a-1]).\n\nTherefore, for the query x and y, the required sum is the sum from (x - y) to (x-1). Let me see:\n\nThe starting index is (x - y), and the ending index is (x-1). So the sum is p[x-1] - (if (x - y) ==0 then 0 else p[(x - y) -1]).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsum from a to b is p[b] - (a ==0 ? 0 : p[a-1]).\n\nSo in the case of a = x - y and b = x-1:\n\nsum = p[x-1] - ( (x - y) ==0 ? 0 : p[ (x - y) -1 ] )\n\nSo the code in the query loop should compute this.\n\nLooking at the current code's query processing:\n\nIn the code, they have:\n\nif(x != y)\n\nr = p[x-1] - p[x - y -1]\n\nelse\n\nr = p[x-1]\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf x == y, then the starting index a is x - y =0, so the sum is p[x-1] - 0 (since a is 0). So that's correct. So the else case is correct.\n\nIf x != y, then a = x - y, so the sum is p[x-1] - p[a-1] = p[x-1] - p[x - y -1], which is exactly what the code is doing. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct, provided that the prefix sum is computed properly.\n\nThe missing part is the loop that computes the prefix sum. The loop is:\n\nfor(j=1; j <n; j++)\n\n{\n\n    // TODO: Your code here\n\n}\n\nSo the code needs to compute the prefix sum. The correct code here is to add p[j] += p[j-1]; \n\nWait, yes. Because initially, p is the sorted array. Then, for each j starting at 1, we add the previous value to current p[j], so that after the loop, p[j] holds the sum of the first j+1 elements? Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the first element is p[0], which remains as is. Then for j=1, p[1] += p[0], so p[1] is p[0] + p[1]. Then for j=2, p[2] += p[1], which is p[2] + (p0+p1) \u2192 sum of first three elements. So yes, after the loop, p[j] is the sum of the first j+1 elements? Wait, no, the first j+1 elements? Wait, j is the index. For j=0, it's the first element. For j=1, it's first two elements. So p[j] is the sum of the first (j+1) elements. So the sum of the first x elements is p[x-1], since x elements would be up to index x-1. Wait, no, if x is the number of elements, then the sum of first x elements is p[x-1], because p[j] is the sum up to index j. So for x elements, the index is x-1. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the loop is p[j] += p[j-1]; \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor(j=1; j <n; j++)\n\n    p[j] += p[j-1];\n\nThat's the missing part. Let me check the data types. The p array is declared as long long int, which is correct because the sum can be up to 2e5 elements each 1e6, so 2e11, which fits in a long long.\n\nSo the code after the sort should compute the prefix sum in that loop. That's the missing part.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample input from the note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n5 3 1 2\n\nQueries:\n\n3 2\n\n2 1\n\n4 3\n\nWait, the first example's input is probably like:\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 3\n\n5 3 5 1 \u2192 but the note's first example's first query is 3 items with 5,3,5. Wait, perhaps the input is 5,3,1,2? Let me see the note's first example:\n\nIn the first query, the items are 5,3,5. Wait, perhaps the input array after sorting in descending order would be [5,5,3,1,2]? Wait no, the input in the note's first example's first query is 3 items worth 5,3,5. So the original array must have those numbers. Let me see the note's first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nProbably the input is 5 3 1 2. After sorting in descending order, it becomes 5,3,2,1. Wait, but the first query's example says the three items are 5,3,5. Hmm, maybe the actual input is different. But regardless, the code's approach is correct.\n\nIn any case, the code's logic is correct once the prefix sum is computed. So the missing code is indeed p[j] += p[j-1]; in the loop.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in that line."
