Since it's inside a for loop, adding a break; would exit the for loop. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif (hs.get(a) >=3) {\n\n    res = a;\n\n    break;\n\n}\n\nBut then, after the for loop, we can print res. \n\nWait, but what if there are multiple numbers that meet the condition? The first one encountered (the first to reach 3) is chosen, which is acceptable. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code can check all elements and then after the loop, check the HashMap for any key with count >=3. But that would require another loop over the entries, which is O(n) again, but perhaps not worth it. \n\nThe current approach of breaking early is better. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nres = a;\n\nbreak;\n\nWait, but in the code, the for loop is over i from 0 to n-1. So when the break is executed, the loop stops, and proceeds to print res. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what if the array has no elements with count >=3? Then the code will process all elements, and res remains -1, which is correct. \n\nSo that should work. \n\nWait, but let me test some examples. \n\nFirst test case: n=1. The array has one element. The code processes it, count is 1. The if condition (1 >=3) is false, so no break. The loop ends, res is -1. Correct. \n\nSecond test case: array of three 2's. The third element is processed, count becomes 3. The if is true, so res is set to 2 and break. So the loop stops, and the code prints 2. Correct. \n\nThird test case: 2 occurs four times. The third occurrence would trigger the break, so res is 2. \n\nFourth test case: 4 occurs three times. The third occurrence would set res and break. \n\nFifth test case: suppose the first three elements are 1, so when the third 1 is processed, res is set to 1 and break. So the output is 1, which is acceptable. \n\nSixth test case: all elements are distinct. The loop processes all elements, res remains -1. \n\nSo all test cases are handled correctly. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nres = a;\n\nbreak;\n\nWait, but in the code, the for loop is inside the while loop for each test case. So the break will exit the for loop, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the if block should be those two lines. \n\nSo the answer is to put those two lines in the TODO section. \n\nWait, but the code may have to be in the correct syntax. Let me check the code structure again. \n\nThe code inside the for loop:\n\nint a= s.nextInt();\n\nhs.put(a,hs.getOrDefault(a,0)+1);\n\nif(hs.get(a)>=3) {\n\n    // TODO: Your code here\n\n}\n\nSo the code inside the if block is where the missing code goes. \n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nres = a;\n\nbreak;\n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is those two lines. \n\nWait, but in Java, the break will exit the for loop. That's correct. \n\nSo the user needs to output exactly those two lines. \n\nWait, but the problem says to output only the missing code. So the code to be filled in the TODO is:\n\nres = a;\n\nbreak;\n\nYes. \n\nSo that's the answer."
