The problem says that we have two strings s and t of the same length n, each made up of 'a', 'b', 'c'. We can perform moves where we replace \"ab\" with \"ba\" or \"bc\" with \"cb\". The question is whether we can turn s into t using any number of these moves. Hmm, the key here is to understand what these moves allow us to do. Let's think about the allowed transformations. The \"ab\" to \"ba\" move swaps 'a' and 'b' but only when they are in the order \"ab\". Similarly, \"bc\" can be swapped to \"cb\". So, these swaps can be done multiple times. Wait, but how do these swaps affect the positions of the characters? Let's see. For 'a's and 'c's, maybe they can move past 'b's? Because 'a's can swap with 'b's in one direction, and 'c's can swap with 'b's in the other.",
