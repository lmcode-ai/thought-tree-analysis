Let me see:\n\nFor each friend i with a car (cnt[i] is 0?), the code loops over all masks j. If the distance from 1 to h[i] with mask 0 (the original path) is the same as with mask j, then that means that the path taken by this friend includes exactly the subset j of the friends without cars. \n\nWait, maybe the mask j here represents the subset of friends without cars that can be picked up by this friend's shortest path. \n\nSo for each such friend, their path can cover some subset of the friends without cars. The DP is trying to track all possible subsets that can be covered by the union of the subsets chosen by each friend. \n\nThe DP array dp[j][0] is probably the number of ways to reach subset j, but in the code, it's set to 0 or 1. \n\nThe initial state is dp[0][0] = 1. \n\nThen, for each friend with a car, we look at all possible masks j where the friend's path can cover j (i.e., the distance from 1 to their home with mask j is the same as the base distance). \n\nThen, for each existing subset z in dp, we can update the new subset (z | j) to be possible. \n\nThe code uses a temporary buffer (dp[...][1]) to store the new possibilities, then copies it back. \n\nThe final answer is the maximum subset size covered, so the minimal number of walkers is k minus that. \n\nSo the missing code in the BFS part is indeed the part where when you reach the home of a friend without a car, you can update the mask and add the new state to the queue. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the TODO block should be:\n\ndis[x][nmask] = dis[x][mask];\nq.push_front( {x, nmask} );\n\nWait, but the code's existing condition already ensures that dis[x][nmask] is greater than the current dis[x][mask], so setting it to the current value and pushing to the queue. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the missing code is those two lines. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the for loop is over i from 0 to k-1 (since i starts at 0 and goes up to k?), but the p array is 1-based. Let me check the loop:\n\nThe code has for (int i=0; i < k; i++). Since k is the number of friends without cars, that's correct. \n\nSo the code for the TODO is as I thought. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in is:\n\ndis[x][nmask] = dis[x][mask];\nq.push_front( {x, nmask} );\n\nWait, but in the code's existing code, after the if condition, the code is inside the block. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\ndis[x][nmask] = dis[x][mask];\nq.push_front( {x, nmask} );\n\nYes. \n\nI think that's the missing part. Let me check again. \n\nThe code's current line after the if is a comment. So replacing that with those two lines. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the answer is those two lines."
