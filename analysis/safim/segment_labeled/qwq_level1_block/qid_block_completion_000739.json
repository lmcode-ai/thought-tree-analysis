Division 2 is between 1600 and 1899. Division 3 is 1400 to 1599. And Division 4 is anything 1399 or below. So the input is t test cases, each with a rating. For each, I have to output the division. Hmm, the code provided is a loop that runs t times. For each iteration, I need to read the rating, then check which condition it meets. Let me think about the steps. For each rating:\n\nFirst, check if it's >=1900 \u2192 Division 1. If not, check if it's between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 Division 2. Then, if between 1400 and 1599 \u2192 Division3. Else, if it's <=1399 \u2192 Division4. Wait, the order here matters. Because once the first condition is met, the others are skipped. So the order should be from highest to lowest.
