The existing code after the first two conditions is the else if (x <1900) { ... }, so the code inside that block should be for division 2. Because the previous condition was else if (x <1600) which is division 3. So the next step is, if x is >=1600 but less than 1900, that's division 2. So the code here should be puts(\"Division 2\");. Then the else block is for 1900 and above, which is division 1, which is already handled. So the missing line is putting \"Division 2\" in that else if block.
