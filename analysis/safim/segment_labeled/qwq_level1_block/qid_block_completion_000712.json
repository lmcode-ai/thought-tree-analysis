So add std::cin >> rating; But wait, the variable 'rating' is already declared outside the loop. Hmm, that's okay, but each iteration we read a new value.\n\n2. Then check the rating against the conditions. How to structure the conditions? Let's think of the order. Since the divisions are in ranges, we can check from highest to lowest. If rating >=1900 \u2192 division 1.\n\nElse if between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 division2. Else if between 1400 and 1599 \u2192 division3. Else (<=1399) \u2192 division4. So the code can be a series of if-else statements. Alternatively, maybe a switch, but since it's ranges, if-else is better. So code outline:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ncin >> rating;\n\nthen:\n\nif (rating >=1900) cout << \"Division 1\";\nelse if (rating >=1600) cout << \"Division 2\";\nelse if (rating >=1400) cout << \"Division3\";\nelse cout << \"Division4\"; Wait, let me check the conditions again. Let's see:\n\nDivision 2 is 1600 \u2264 rating \u22641899. So if the first condition (>=1900) is false, then check if it's >=1600, which would put it in division2. Because if it's 1600-1899, that's correct. Then division3 is 1400-1599. So after the else if for division2, the next check is if >=1400 \u2192 division3. Else, it's division4. That works. Yes, because after the first two conditions fail, if it's >=1400, then it's in 1400-1599. Otherwise, it's below 1400, so division4. That logic should work. So putting that into code:\n\nAfter reading the rating, the code would be:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n} But wait, need to make sure that the input is read each time.

Or, better, change the loop to while(t--) so that each iteration t is decremented.\n\nSo the correct code would have the loop as while(t--) { ... }, and inside that loop, read the rating and process.\n\nTherefore, the user's code's loop is incorrect and needs to be fixed. So the TODO section must include both reading the input and the division check, and also the loop must be adjusted.\n\nWait, the problem says \"output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly\". So the user's code has the loop as while(t), but that's an infinite loop unless t is modified. So the code inside the loop must include the t-- or change the loop condition.\n\nHmm, so the code as given is:\n\nwhile (t)\n{\n\t/* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the user's code's loop is while(t) which is equivalent to while(t !=0). So to make it loop t times, the code inside must read the rating, process, and then decrement t each time. Alternatively, the loop can be changed to while(t--) which would handle the decrement.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to change the loop to while(t--) { ... }, but since the user's code has the loop as while(t), perhaps the code inside must include the t--.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended the loop to run t times, so the code inside must read the rating, process, and then decrement t each time.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\n\n// process and output division\n\nt--; \n\nBut that's a bit awkward. Alternatively, the loop can be written as while(t--) which is more concise.\n\nTherefore, the correct code would have the loop as while(t--) and inside read the rating and process.\n\nSo the user's code's loop is written as while(t), so to fix it, the loop should be changed to while(t--), but since the problem says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code inside the loop must include the t--.\n\nWait, the problem says \"output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly\". The existing code has the loop as while(t), so the missing code must include the t-- somewhere. Because otherwise, the loop will run forever.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop must read the rating, process, and then decrement t. Or, the loop can be changed to while(t--), but since the code is given as while(t), perhaps the code inside must include the t--.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's code is okay if the loop is written as while(t--) but the original code has while(t). So the correct code would have the loop as while(t--) and the code inside.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop (the TODO section) must first read the rating, then process, and the loop must be adjusted. But since the problem says to output only the missing code, perhaps the loop is left as while(t), and the code inside must include the t--.\n\nWait, the code given is:\n\nwhile (t)\n{\n\t/* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the user's code's loop is while(t), so the code inside must read the rating, process, and then decrement t each time. Otherwise, the loop will run forever.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop must have:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\n\n// process division and output\n\nt--;\n\nSo that each iteration, t is decremented, so after t times, the loop exits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nwhile(t--) {\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. The existing code has the loop as while(t), so the user's code's loop is as written. Therefore, the code inside the loop must include the t--.\n\nSo putting it all together, the code inside the loop would be:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\n\nif (rating >=1900) {\n\n    std::cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n\n} else if (rating >=1600) {\n\n    std::cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n\n} else if (rating >=1400) {\n\n    std::cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n\n} else {\n\n    std::cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n\n}\n\nt--;\n\nWait, but that's a lot of code. Alternatively, perhaps the loop can be changed to while(t--) but the problem says to output only the missing code. Since the code given has the loop as while(t), the code inside must include the t--.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to have the loop run t times, so the code inside must read the rating and process, and the loop is written as while(t--) so that each iteration t is decremented. So changing the loop to while(t--) is part of the code, but the problem says to output only the missing code. Since the code given has the loop as while(t), perhaps the code inside must include the t--.\n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Complete the code in cpp to solve this programming problem\".\n\nThe existing code has the loop as while(t). So the code inside the loop must read the rating, process, and also decrement t each time. Otherwise, the loop will not terminate.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop must include the t--.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n}\n\nt--;\n\nWait, but that's the code that needs to be filled in the TODO section. So that's the missing code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop can be written as while(t--) and then the code inside doesn't need to do t--. But since the code given has the loop as while(t), the user must have intended to have the loop run while t is non-zero, but without modifying t, so the code inside must decrement t each time.\n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n}\nt--;\n\nWait, but in C++, the order of operations here is important. The code first reads the rating, then does the checks, then decrements t. That way, each iteration processes one test case and t counts down.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\n// process\nt--;\n\nBut the code must be inside the loop.\n\nAnother point: the output must be exactly \"Division X\" with a space and the number. So the code uses the correct strings.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFor example, the sixth test case with 1679: it's between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 division2. The code would hit the second condition (since 1679 >=1600, and first condition is false). So yes.\n\nThe seventh test case 2300 \u2192 division1.\n\nThe first test case -789 \u2192 division4.\n\nAll the sample cases should be handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: 1399 \u2192 division4. 1400 \u2192 division3. 1599 \u2192 division3. 1600 \u2192 division2. 1899 \u2192 division2. 1900 \u2192 division1.\n\nYes, the code's conditions handle these.\n\nSo the code inside the loop is as above.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the code inside the while loop, which includes reading the rating, the if-else chain, and decrementing t.\n\nSo the code to output is:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\nif(rating >=1900) std::cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\nelse if(rating >=1600) std::cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\nelse if(rating >=1400) std::cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\nelse std::cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\nt--;\n\nAlternatively, using braces for the if-else blocks, but the problem says to output the code as plain text. The code can be written with or without braces as long as it's correct. But to be safe, using braces is better to avoid any issues.\n\nWait, the code as written in the problem's code uses indentation with tabs or spaces, but the assistant's code should match the style. However, the problem says to output the code as plain text, so the exact formatting may not matter as long as the code is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written more concisely. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the code must be placed inside the while loop. The existing code has variables 't' and 'rating' declared before the loop. So the code inside the loop must read the rating each time. The 'rating' variable is declared outside, so it's okay to reuse it each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop is:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    std::cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n}\nt--;\n\nYes, that's the code needed. So that's the missing part."
