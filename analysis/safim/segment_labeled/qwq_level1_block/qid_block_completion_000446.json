  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a rooted tree where each node has a number a_v that must be between l_v and r_v. The operations allowed are choosing a vertex v, then selecting a non-decreasing array c of non-negative integers along the path from root (1) to v. Each element in c is added to the corresponding nodes on that path. The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations needed so that all a_v meet their constraints.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model the operations in a way that allows us to compute the minimal steps. Since each operation affects a path from root to some node, and the c array must be non-decreasing, I need to think of how these operations can be combined to reach the required a_v values.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required a_v. Each a_v is the sum of all the c_i's from the operations that include it in their path. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, maybe there's a way to model this as some kind of greedy approach where we process nodes in a certain order and track the required increments.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to the problem where you have to cover certain constraints with non-decreasing sequences. Maybe we can model this using a greedy approach on the tree's structure. Let me think of the tree as a hierarchy, and process the nodes in post-order or something.\n\nAlternatively, since each operation's path is from root to a node, the order in which nodes are processed might matter. Let me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me denote that for each node v, the required a_v must be between l_v and r_v. But how do the operations contribute to this?\n\nEach operation on a node v adds a non-decreasing sequence c_1 \u2264 c_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 c_k (where k is the depth of v) to the nodes along the path. So, for each node u on the path from root to v, the contribution from this operation is c_i, where i is the position of u in the path.\n\nThe total a_u is the sum of all c_i's from all operations that include u in their path. Since the c arrays are non-decreasing, perhaps the minimal number of operations can be found by considering the differences between the required a_v and the contributions from previous operations.\n\nHmm, maybe we can model this as a problem where each node's required value must be achieved by the sum of certain variables. Let me think of the variables as the increments added at each step. Since the c arrays are non-decreasing, perhaps each operation corresponds to a certain \"step\" that affects a path, and the variables must be chosen such that their cumulative effect meets the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a system of equations where each a_v is the sum of some variables, and the constraints on the variables (non-decreasing in each path) must be satisfied. The minimal number of operations would then be the minimal number of variables needed to satisfy all equations and inequalities.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where we need to find the minimal number of non-decreasing sequences along paths such that their sum meets the required a_v's. But how?\n\nAnother thought: Let's consider the required a_v for each node. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to the nodes along the path must form a non-decreasing sequence. To reach the required a_v, perhaps the minimal number of operations corresponds to the number of \"breakpoints\" where the required increments can't be covered by a single non-decreasing sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a greedy approach where we process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root) and track the required increments. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v and at most r_v. But since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the increments along a path must be non-decreasing.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let's think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me denote that for each node v, the required a_v must be achieved by the sum of the c's from all operations that pass through it. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing along the path, the variables (the c's) must form non-decreasing sequences along each path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the differences between the required a_v and the contributions from their ancestors. Let me think recursively. For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The a_v is the sum of all the c's from the operations that include v in their path. Since each c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to v's parent must be less than or equal to the contribution to v. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps there's a way to model this as a difference between the required a_v and the contributions from the parent.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's sample input. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. Let's consider the minimal required a_v as l_v. To achieve this, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nEach operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The minimal number of operations is the minimal number of such sequences needed to cover the required increments.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each node's required value is the sum of some variables, and the variables along any path must form a non-decreasing sequence. The minimal number of variables (operations) needed to reach the required a_v's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be viewed as a problem where each node's required a_v must be the sum of some variables, and the variables along any path must form a non-decreasing sequence. The minimal number of variables (operations) is the minimal number of such variables needed to reach the required a_v's.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and the variables must form non-decreasing sequences along each path. To minimize the number of variables (operations), we can model this as a greedy approach where we track the required increments and split them into as few non-decreasing sequences as possible.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's constraints. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v and at most r_v. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the minimal number of operations would be determined by the \"steps\" needed along the paths.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the required a_v for each node and the constraints from their parents. Let me think of the required a_v as the sum of the contributions from all operations that pass through it. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to a node's parent must be less than or equal to the contribution to the node itself. \n\nWait, maybe the problem can be modeled using a greedy approach where we process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root) and track the required increments. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. Let me denote that for each node v, the minimal required a_v is l_v, but since the operations can choose any c_i up to r_v, perhaps we can model the required increments as the difference between the current required value and the contributions from the parent's path.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's sample:\n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order traversal. For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The a_v is the sum of all the c's from the operations that include v in their path. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent of v must be less than or equal to the contribution to v. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and the variables along the path must form a non-decreasing sequence. To minimize the number of operations, we can model this as the maximum number of \"breakpoints\" where the required increments can't be covered by a single non-decreasing sequence.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's sample explanation. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. Let me consider the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of the variables as the increments added by each operation.

The minimal number of operations is the minimal number of variables needed to cover all required a_v's.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each node's required a_v must be covered by the sum of variables along its path, and the variables must form a non-decreasing sequence. The minimal number of variables (operations) is the minimal number of such variables needed.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's sample. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. Let me process the nodes in post-order. For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The contribution from the parent's path is already fixed, so the remaining required a_v must be covered by variables along the path from the parent to v. Since the variables must be non-decreasing, the minimal number of operations would be determined by the differences between the required a_v and the contributions from the parent's path.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the required a_v as the sum of variables along the path, and the variables must form a non-decreasing sequence. To minimize the number of variables (operations), we can model this as a greedy approach where we track the required increments and split them into as few non-decreasing sequences as possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a problem where each node's required a_v must be covered by the sum of variables along its path, and the variables must form a non-decreasing sequence.
