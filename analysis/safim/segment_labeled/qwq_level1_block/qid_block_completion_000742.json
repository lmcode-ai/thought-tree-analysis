The problem description says there are four divisions with specific rating ranges. Looking at the code, the structure is there. The main method reads the test cases and stores the ratings in an array. Then, for each rating, it checks conditions and sets x to the division number. Then prints \"Division \" + x. The existing code has some if-else conditions. The first if checks if the rating is >=1900, which is division 1. Then else if for 1600 to 1899, that's division 2. Then another else if which is commented as TODO. That must be for division 3, which is 1400 to 1599. So in that block, we should set x=3. Then the else case is for division 4, which is everything else (rating <=1399). Wait, let me check the conditions again.",
