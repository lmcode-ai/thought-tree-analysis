  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. The problem is about finding the minimum energy to restore so that I can walk from bench 1 to n+1. Hmm.\n\nThe input gives t test cases. Each test case has n and m, then n a_i's which are the distances between consecutive benches. The idea is that I start with m energy. Each meter I walk uses 1 energy. But I can sit on benches to restore any amount. The goal is to find the minimal total restored energy needed to reach the end.\n\nSo the approach must be to track the energy as I go from bench to bench. Every time I walk from i to i+1, I subtract the a_i distance from current energy. If at any point the energy goes negative, I need to restore some energy at the previous bench (or current? Wait, when do I sit? Probably, you can sit on the benches as you pass them. So whenever you reach a bench, you can choose to sit there and restore energy before proceeding. So the strategy is to sit at each bench to restore just enough so that you can cover the next distance.\n\nWait, but the problem says the minimal total restored. So maybe the optimal way is to sit at each bench (except the last) to restore enough so that you can cover the next a_i steps. Let me think of the process step by step.\n\nLet me think of the process as starting at bench 1. Then, to go to bench 2, the distance is a_1. So the initial energy m must be at least a_1. If not, then I need to sit on bench 1 and add some energy. Wait, but maybe after that, the next steps also require more.\n\nAlternatively, the idea is to track the current energy. Start with m. For each a_i in the distances:\n\n- The required energy to walk a_i is a_i. So before moving to the next bench, if current energy is less than a_i, then I need to sit here (on the current bench) and add some energy. The required added here would be (a_i - current_energy). Then, after adding, the energy becomes (current_energy + added) which is at least a_i. Then subtract a_i, so the remaining energy is (current_energy + added - a_i) = (current_energy - a_i) + added. But since added is (a_i - current_energy), that would be (current_energy -a_i) + (a_i - current_energy) = 0. Wait, that's not good. Wait, no, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\nAt each step between bench i and i+1:\n\nCurrent energy must be >= a_i. If it is, subtract a_i. If not, then you have to sit on bench i, add enough energy so that current_energy + added >= a_i. The added here is (a_i - current_energy). Then subtract a_i, so the remaining energy is (current_energy + added) - a_i = 0. So after each step, the energy is exactly 0? Or maybe not, because maybe adding more could help in future steps. Wait, but the problem wants the minimal total added. So adding more than needed would be worse. So the optimal is to add exactly the needed amount each time.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, if after passing a step, you have some energy left, that can be used for the next steps. So perhaps it's better to not add exactly the needed each time, but sometimes carry over energy.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to track the current energy. Start with m. For each a_i in the sequence:\n\nThe required energy to cross a_i is a_i. So if current_energy >= a_i, subtract a_i, proceed. Else, you need to add (a_i - current_energy) to the current energy, add that to the total required, then set current_energy to 0 (since after using a_i, it's 0). \n\nWait, but maybe that's not the case. Let me think of an example. Suppose m is 3, and the a_i's are [1, 4]. \n\nFirst step: a_1 is 1. Current energy is 3 >=1, so subtract 1, now 2. \n\nSecond step: a_2 is 4. Current is 2 <4. So need to add (4-2)=2. Total added is 2. Then after adding, energy is 4, subtract 4, so 0. So total added is 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe adding more here could save in the future? But in this case, there are no future steps, so that's optimal. \n\nAnother example: the first test case in the note. Let's see:\n\nSample input 1: n=3, m=2, a = [1,2,1]. \n\nThe example says the answer is 3. Let's see:\n\nStart with m=2.\n\nFirst a_1 is 1. 2 >=1, subtract 1 \u2192 1. \n\nNext a_2 is 2. Current is 1 <2. So need to add (2-1)=1. Now total added is 1. Then energy becomes 1+1=2? Wait, no. Wait, the added is (2-1) =1. So the added is 1, so energy becomes 1 +1 =2. Then subtract 2 \u2192 0. \n\nThen next a_3 is 1. Current is 0. So need to add (1-0)=1. Total added now 2. Then energy becomes 1, subtract 1 \u21920. \n\nTotal added is 1+1=2, but the example says 3. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait the example's first test case's note says the answer is 3. Hmm, so maybe my approach is wrong here. \n\nWait the example's first test case's explanation says: \n\nThey walk to bench 2 (using 1, m becomes 1). Then restore 2 units (so total added so far is 2?), then walk to bench3 (distance 2, so 1+2=3 \u2192 subtract 2 \u2192 1+2-2=1? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me read again.\n\nThe example's first case: \n\nThey start at bench1. Walk to 2 (cost 1, m becomes 1). Then sit on bench2 and restore 2 units (so now energy is 1 + 2 =3?), then walk to bench3 (distance 2, so subtract 2 \u2192 1. Then sit on bench3 and restore 1 (so energy becomes 1+1=2?), then walk to bench4 (distance 1 \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 1 left. So total added is 2+1=3. Which matches the example's answer. \n\nHmm, so according to this, the approach of adding (a_i - current) each time gives 1 (for a_2) and 1 (for a_3) \u2192 total 2, but the correct answer is 3. So my previous approach is wrong. \n\nAh, so the problem is that when you sit on a bench, you can choose to add any amount, but the minimal total. So perhaps the optimal way is to sit at each bench before moving to the next. \n\nWait, in the first step, after bench1, you can choose to sit there and add some energy. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that you can sit on benches to restore energy. So whenever you are on a bench, you can choose to sit there and restore any amount. So the idea is that before moving from bench i to i+1, you can sit on bench i and add some energy. \n\nSo the process is:\n\nStart at bench1 with m energy. \n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n- Before moving to bench i+1, you can sit on bench i and add some energy. \n\n- The distance to cover is a_i. \n\nSo the current energy before adding must be at least (a_i - added_energy). Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose before moving from bench i to i+1, you have current_energy. You can choose to add x energy (x >=0). Then, the total energy becomes (current_energy + x). This must be >= a_i. \n\nThe cost is x added to the total. \n\nWe need to choose x such that (current_energy +x) >= a_i, and x is as small as possible. \n\nSo the minimal x here is max(0, a_i - current_energy). \n\nThen, after moving, the energy becomes (current_energy +x) - a_i = (current_energy -a_i) +x. \n\nBut since x is chosen as max(0, a_i - current_energy), then:\n\nif current_energy >= a_i \u2192 x=0 \u2192 new energy is current_energy -a_i.\n\nelse \u2192 x = a_i - current_energy \u2192 new energy is (current_energy + (a_i - current_energy) ) -a_i = 0. \n\nSo the process is exactly as I thought before. \n\nBut in the first example, let's see:\n\nTest case 1: n=3, m=2, a = [1,2,1]\n\nLet's walk through step by step:\n\nInitial energy: 2.\n\nFirst a_i is 1 (distance between 1 and 2):\n\ncurrent_energy is 2 >=1 \u2192 x=0. \n\nAfter moving, energy is 2-1=1. \n\nSecond a_i is 2 (distance between 2 and 3):\n\ncurrent_energy is 1 <2 \u2192 x needed is 1. \n\nTotal added so far:1. \n\nAfter adding, energy becomes 1+1=2. Subtract 2 \u2192 0. \n\nThird a_i is 1 (distance between 3 and4):\n\ncurrent_energy is 0 <1 \u2192 x needed is 1. \n\nTotal added becomes 2. \n\nSo the total added is 2, but the example says 3. \n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait the example's explanation says that after bench2, they restored 2 units. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem's setup. Let me recheck the example's note:\n\nIn the first test case example, the user's path is:\n\nWalk to bench2 (spends 1, m becomes 1). Then restore 2 units (so now energy is 1+2=3). Then walk to bench3 (distance 2 \u2192 uses 2 \u2192 energy 1. Then restore 1 (so energy becomes 2), then walk to bench4 (distance 1 \u2192 uses 1 \u2192 energy 1 left. \n\nTotal added is 2+1=3. \n\nAh, so in this scenario, the user chose to add more than the minimal required. But why would that be better?\n\nWait, according to the problem's statement, the minimal total added is required. So why is the example's answer 3 instead of 2?\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me see:\n\nWait in the second step (distance 2 between bench2 and3):\n\nThe current energy after bench1 is 1. \n\nThe minimal x needed is 1 (so that 1+1=2, which allows to cross the 2 distance. \n\nThen after that, the energy is 0. \n\nThen for the third step (distance 1), you have 0, so need to add 1. \n\nTotal is 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait the example's note says that the user restored 2 units on bench2. So why would they do that? \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that you can only restore energy on the benches you are sitting on. So when you are on bench2, you can choose to restore any amount. But in the scenario where you add 1 on bench2, you can proceed. \n\nWait the example's explanation must be wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. \n\nWait let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \"you can restore your energy by sitting on benches (and this is the only way to restore the energy). When you are sitting, you can restore any integer amount of energy you want (if you sit longer, you restore more energy). Note that the amount of your energy can exceed m.\"\n\nAh, so the key point is that you can choose to sit on a bench and restore any amount. So the minimal total is the sum of all the x's you choose. \n\nIn the first test case, according to the example's explanation, the total added is 2 (bench2) +1 (bench3) =3. But according to my approach, the minimal would be 1 (bench2) +1 (bench3) =2. \n\nSo why is the example's answer 3? \n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in the example's first case. Let me re-calculate with the example's steps:\n\nThe example's path:\n\nStart with m=2. \n\nFirst, walk to bench2: uses 1 \u2192 energy 1. \n\nThen sit on bench2 and add 2 \u2192 total added so far is 2. \n\nNow energy is 1+2=3. \n\nThen walk to bench3: uses 2 \u2192 energy 1. \n\nThen sit on bench3 and add 1 \u2192 total added 3. \n\nThen walk to bench4: uses 1 \u2192 energy 0. \n\nTotal added is 3. \n\nBut according to the minimal approach, the user could have added 1 on bench2 (so energy becomes 2, then after walking, 0. Then on bench3, add 1. So total 2. \n\nSo why is the example's answer 3? \n\nWait the problem's first test case's example must have a different input. Let me check the problem's note again. \n\nThe problem says in the first test case of the example, the answer is 3. \n\nHmm, so there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in the problem's input. Let me recheck the problem's first example's input. \n\nWait the problem says in the first test case of the example, the a_i's are [1,2,1], and m=2. \n\nWait according to my approach, the minimal added is 1 (for the second step) and 1 (third step) \u2192 total 2. But the example says 3. \n\nHmm, so there must be a misunderstanding. \n\nWait perhaps the problem requires that you can only sit on a bench before moving to the next. So when you are on bench i, you can choose to sit there and add energy before moving to i+1. \n\nWait in the first scenario, after bench1, you have 1 energy. \n\nTo move to bench2, you can sit on bench1 and add some energy. \n\nWait no, the first step is from bench1 to bench2. So before moving from bench1 to bench2, you can sit on bench1 and add energy. \n\nWait in the first step, the initial energy is 2. So you can choose to add 0, since 2 >=1. \n\nSo after moving, energy is 1. \n\nThen, for the second step (distance 2 between bench2 and3), you are on bench2. Before moving to bench3, you can sit on bench2 and add energy. \n\nThe current energy is 1. So you need to add at least 1. \n\nIf you add 1, then energy becomes 2, subtract 2 \u2192 0. \n\nThen for the third step (distance 1 between bench3 and4), you are on bench3. Current energy is 0. So you need to add 1. \n\nTotal added is 1+1=2. \n\nSo why does the example's answer say 3? \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's first test case is different. Let me see the problem's note again. \n\nThe problem's first test case's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units of energy on the second bench, walk to the bench 3, spending 2 units of energy, restore 1 unit of energy and go to the bench 4.\"\n\nAh, so in this path, they chose to add 2 on bench2 and 1 on bench3. So total 3. But why would they do that when they could have added 1 on bench2 and 1 on bench3 for a total of 2? \n\nAh, perhaps I'm missing something here. \n\nWait maybe the problem requires that you can only sit on a bench after arriving there. So when you arrive at bench2, you can choose to sit there and add energy. \n\nWait in that case, the minimal approach is correct. So why does the example's answer say 3? \n\nWait maybe the problem's first test case's input is different. Let me see. \n\nWait the problem's first test case's note says the a_i's are 1,2,1. So the total distance is 4. \n\nWait the minimal added is 2. But the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the minimal approach:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, m=2, a = [1,2,1]\n\nInitial energy: 2.\n\nStep 1: distance 1. \n\nCurrent energy is 2 >=1 \u2192 no need to add. \n\nAfter moving, energy is 1. \n\nStep 2: distance 2. \n\nCurrent energy is 1 <2 \u2192 need to add (2-1)=1. \n\nTotal added so far:1. \n\nEnergy after adding: 1+1=2 \u2192 subtract 2 \u2192 0. \n\nStep3: distance 1. \n\nCurrent energy is 0 <1 \u2192 need to add 1. \n\nTotal added: 2. \n\nSo the minimal total is 2. But the example says 3. \n\nHmm, this suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding. \n\nWait the problem's note says the first test case's answer is 3. So perhaps the problem requires that you can't sit on the first bench? Or perhaps the initial energy is m, but you have to start at bench1, so you can sit there before moving. \n\nWait the problem says you start at bench1. So you can sit there before moving to bench2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's first test case has different a_i's. Let me see the problem's note again. \n\nThe problem's first test case's note says the a_i's are 1,2,3? Or maybe I misread. \n\nWait the problem's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units of energy on the second bench, walk to the bench 3, spending 2 units of energy, restore 1 unit of energy and go to the bench 4.\"\n\nThe path uses a_i's of 1 (between 1-2), 2 (2-3), and 1 (3-4). So the total distance is 4. \n\nBut according to the minimal approach, the answer should be 2. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can't sit on the starting bench (bench1) before the first step. \n\nWait no, the problem says you start at bench1, so you can sit there. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's output. The output is the minimal total energy to restore. \n\nWait in the example's path, the total added is 2+1=3. But the minimal is 2. So why is the example's answer 3? \n\nThis suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can only sit on a bench after arriving there, but before moving to the next. \n\nWait that's what I assumed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that you can't sit on the last bench (n+1). \n\nWait the problem says you have to reach bench n+1. So you don't need to sit there. \n\nHmm, I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can't sit on a bench after moving to it. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can only sit on a bench after moving to it. \n\nWait, the process is: \n\nYou start at bench1. \n\nYou can choose to sit there and add energy before moving to bench2. \n\nSo the first step is correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's first test case's input is different. Let me think again. \n\nWait maybe the a_i's are [1,3,1], so the second distance is 3. \n\nThen the minimal approach would be:\n\nInitial m=2. \n\nStep1: a=1 \u2192 energy 1. \n\nStep2: a=3 \u2192 current is 1. Need to add 2 \u2192 total added 2. \n\nThen energy after adding is 3 \u2192 subtract 3 \u2192 0. \n\nStep3: a=1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 3. \n\nWhich matches the example's answer. \n\nAh! So perhaps I misread the a_i's in the first test case. \n\nThe problem's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units of energy on the second bench, walk to the bench 3, spending 2 units of energy, restore 1 unit of energy and go to the bench 4.\"\n\nThe distance between bench2 and3 is 2, so the a_i's are [1,2,1]. \n\nWait then the second distance is 2. \n\nHmm, so why in that case the example's answer is 3? \n\nWait in that case, the minimal added is 1 (step2) +1 (step3) \u2192 total 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 3. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can't sit on the first bench. \n\nWait, but the problem says you start at bench1, so you can sit there. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that you must sit on every bench except the first. \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can only sit on a bench after moving to it. \n\nWait, that would mean that for the first step, you can't sit on bench1 before moving. \n\nWait, that would change things. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nIf you can only sit on a bench after arriving there, then for the first step (moving from bench1 to bench2), you can't sit on bench1 before moving. \n\nWait that would mean that you have to have enough energy to make the first move. \n\nSo the process would be:\n\nStart at bench1 with m energy. \n\nTo move to bench2, you must have at least a_1 energy. \n\nIf not, you can't move. \n\nWait that's a different scenario. \n\nIn that case, the first step requires that you have enough energy. \n\nSo in the first test case, the first step is a_1=1. \n\nInitial m=2 is enough. \n\nAfter moving, you arrive at bench2, and can sit there. \n\nThen, for the second step (distance 2), you have 1 energy. \n\nSo you can sit on bench2 and add 1 (total added 1) to get to 2, then move. \n\nThen after that, you have 0. \n\nThird step: distance 1. \n\nYou are at bench3, can sit and add 1. \n\nTotal added 2. \n\nSo the answer is still 2. \n\nHmm, so why does the example's answer say 3? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can only sit on a bench after moving to it, but before moving to the next. \n\nWait that's the same as before. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's first test case's a_i's are different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's note. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the energy can't go negative at any point. \n\nWait, the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"you can't walk if you have no energy\". \n\nSo when you are at bench i, you can choose to sit and add energy. \n\nThe process is: \n\nAt each step between bench i and i+1:\n\nYou are at bench i. \n\nYou can choose to sit here and add any amount of energy (x >=0). \n\nThen, you must have enough energy to walk the a_i distance. \n\nSo the total energy after adding x must be >= a_i. \n\nThe energy after moving is (current_energy +x) - a_i. \n\nThe x added is added to the total. \n\nThe goal is to choose x's such that the sum of x's is minimized, and you can proceed all the way. \n\nSo the minimal x for each step is max(0, a_i - current_energy). \n\nThe current_energy after each step is (current_energy +x -a_i) = (current_energy -a_i) +x. \n\nSince x is chosen as max(0, a_i - current_energy), then:\n\nif current_energy >= a_i \u2192 x=0 \u2192 new energy is current_energy -a_i. \n\nelse \u2192 x = a_i - current_energy \u2192 new energy is 0. \n\nSo the process is exactly as I thought. \n\nSo in the first test case, the minimal total is 2. \n\nBut the example says 3. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait maybe the example's first test case has a different input. Let me check the problem's note again. \n\nThe problem's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units of energy on the second bench, walk to the bench 3, spending 2 units of energy, restore 1 unit of energy and go to the bench 4.\"\n\nThe path described here uses 2+1=3 added. \n\nBut according to the minimal approach, it's possible to do it with 2. \n\nSo why is the example's answer 3? \n\nAh! Maybe the problem requires that you can't sit on the first bench. \n\nWait, if you can't sit on the first bench, then the first step must be done with the initial m. \n\nIn the first test case, the first step is okay (m=2 >=1). \n\nSecond step: after first step, energy is 1. \n\nTo move to bench3, you need to have at least 2. \n\nSo you must sit on bench2 and add 1 (total added 1). \n\nThen after moving, energy is 0. \n\nThird step: need to add 1 (total 2). \n\nSo the answer is 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, this is very confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you must sit on every bench except the first. \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can only sit on a bench after moving to it, but before moving to the next. \n\nWhich is what I assumed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's first test case has a different a array. \n\nWait maybe the a array is [1,3,1]. \n\nThen the second distance is 3. \n\nThen the minimal approach would be:\n\nInitial m=2. \n\nStep1: a=1 \u2192 energy 1. \n\nStep2: a=3 \u2192 current is 1. Need to add 2 \u2192 total added 2. \n\nAfter moving, energy 0. \n\nStep3: a=1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 3. \n\nWhich matches the example's answer. \n\nAh! So perhaps I misread the a array in the first test case. \n\nThe problem's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units of energy on the second bench, walk to the bench 3, spending 2 units of energy, restore 1 unit of energy and go to the bench 4.\"\n\nThe second step's distance is 2 units of energy spent. So the distance between bench2 and3 is 2. \n\nSo the a array is [1,2,1]. \n\nBut then the minimal added is 2. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can't sit on the first bench. \n\nWait, if you can't sit on the first bench, then the first step must be done with initial m. \n\nIn the first test case, the first step is okay (m=2 >=1). \n\nThen, after first step, energy is 1. \n\nSecond step: distance 2. \n\nYou can sit on bench2 and add 1 \u2192 total added 1. \n\nThen energy after is 0. \n\nThird step: add 1 \u2192 total 2. \n\nSo the answer is 2. \n\nBut the example says 3. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the code and see. \n\nThe code given has a loop for(int i=0; i <n; i++) { /* TODO */ }\n\nThe current code outputs max(0, -m). \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nThe current code's output is max(0, -m), which is 0 when m is positive. \n\nSo clearly, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe correct approach is to track the current energy. \n\nWe need to initialize current_energy to m. \n\nThen, for each a_i in the a array:\n\ncompute the required energy to move. \n\nif current_energy < a_i:\n\n   needed = a_i - current_energy \n\n   total += needed \n\n   current_energy = 0 \n\nelse:\n\n   current_energy -= a_i \n\nSo the total added is the sum of all needed. \n\nThus, the code should track current_energy and total. \n\nThe initial code has a loop for the a_i's, but it's empty. \n\nSo the missing code is to read the a_i's into an array, then compute the required total. \n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { /* TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nThen, after the loop, it outputs max(0, -m). \n\nSo the code is completely wrong. \n\nThe correct approach is to read all a_i's into an array, then compute the required total. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and m. \n\nRead the array a of size n. \n\nInitialize current_energy = m \n\ntotal_added =0 \n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n   if current_energy < a_i:\n\n       needed = a_i - current_energy \n\n       total_added += needed \n\n       current_energy += needed \n\n   current_energy -= a_i \n\nSo after each step, current_energy is updated. \n\nWait, but after adding needed, current_energy becomes current_energy + needed (which is exactly a_i), then subtract a_i \u2192 0. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ncurrent_energy = m \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n    if current_energy < a_i:\n\n        total += (a_i - current_energy)\n\n        current_energy =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        current_energy -= a_i \n\nSo the code should do this. \n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is to read the a_i's and store them in an array, then process them. \n\nWait the current code's loop is inside the test case loop. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { /* TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nSo inside this loop, we need to read the a_i's. \n\nWait the code currently doesn't have any variables to store the a_i's. \n\nSo the code needs to have an array to store the a_i's. \n\nThus, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\ncin >>n >>m; \n\nvector<int> a(n); \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    cin >>a[i]; \n\n}\n\nThen, compute the total_added. \n\nBut the current code's loop is empty. \n\nSo the missing code in the loop is to read the a_i's. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe current code's loop is for(int i=0; i <n; i++) { /* TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nSo the missing code is to read a_i into an array. \n\nBut the code currently has no array. \n\nAh, so the code is incomplete. \n\nThe user's code has variables t, n, m, a (but a is an int, not an array). \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code should have an array to store the a_i's. \n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is to read the a_i's into an array. \n\nBut the current code doesn't have such an array. \n\nSo the user's code is missing variables. \n\nHmm, but the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code has:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { /* TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nSo the missing code is to read the a_i's. \n\nBut since the code currently has an 'a' variable (int a; declared globally), perhaps the code is supposed to read each a_i into a variable and process it on the fly. \n\nWait, perhaps the code can process the a_i's as they are read, without storing them in an array. \n\nBecause the processing can be done step by step. \n\nSo the code can be modified as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\ncurrent_energy = m \n\ntotal_added =0 \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> a_i; \n\n    if current_energy < a_i:\n\n        needed = a_i - current_energy \n\n        total_added += needed \n\n        current_energy =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        current_energy -= a_i \n\n}\n\nThen, output total_added. \n\nBut the current code's loop is empty. \n\nSo the missing code is to read each a_i, process it, and track current_energy and total_added. \n\nBut the current code's variables are not set up for this. \n\nThe current code has variables t, n, m, a (int a). \n\nSo perhaps the code should read each a_i into 'a' and process it. \n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is:\n\ncin >> a; \n\nand then process 'a' in the loop. \n\nBut the code also needs to track current_energy and total_added. \n\nSo the code should have variables declared inside the test case loop. \n\nThus, the complete code would be:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\ncin >>n >>m; \n\nint current_energy = m; \n\nint total =0; \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    cin >> a; \n\n    if(current_energy < a) {\n\n        int needed = a - current_energy; \n\n        total += needed; \n\n        current_energy =0; \n\n    } else {\n\n        current_energy -= a; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\ncout << total << endl; \n\nBut the original code's loop is empty and the output is max(0, -m). \n\nSo the missing code is to read the a_i's, track current_energy and total. \n\nThus, the code needs to be modified as follows. \n\nThe original code has:\n\nwhile(t--){\n\n    cin>>n>>m;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {/* TODO: Your code here */}\n\n    cout<<max(0,-m)<<endl;\n\n}\n\nThe correct code should replace the loop and the output. \n\nThe missing code in the loop is to read each a_i and process it. \n\nSo the code inside the loop should be:\n\nint current_energy = m; \n\nint total =0; \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    int a; \n\n    cin >> a; \n\n    if(current_energy < a) {\n\n        total += (a - current_energy); \n\n        current_energy =0; \n\n    } else {\n\n        current_energy -= a; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\ncout << total << endl; \n\nBut the original code's loop is empty. \n\nThus, the missing code is to replace the loop and the output. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code has the loop as:\n\nfor(int i=0;

\n\nint total =0; \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    int a; \n\n    cin >> a; \n\n    if(current_energy < a) {\n\n        total += (a - current_energy); \n\n        current_energy =0; \n\n    } else {\n\n        current_energy -= a; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\ncout << total << endl; \n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is:\n\nint a; \n\ncin >> a; \n\nif(current_energy < a) {\n\n    total += (a - current_energy); \n\n    current_energy =0; \n\n} else {\n\n    current_energy -= a; \n\n}\n\nBut the code also needs to declare current_energy and total before the loop. \n\nSo the code inside the test case loop should be:\n\ncin>>n>>m;\n\nint current_energy = m;\n\nint total =0;\n\nfor(int i=0;
