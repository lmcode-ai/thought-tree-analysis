The key here is to figure out when and how much to restore energy. Since sitting on a bench can restore any amount, the optimal strategy is to restore just enough energy whenever needed to proceed to the next bench. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. Starting at bench 1, I need to walk to bench 2, which is a distance of a_1. So I subtract a_1 from my current energy. But if my energy is not enough, I have to sit before that step and restore some energy. Wait, but when do I sit? I can sit on the current bench before moving. So the idea is that whenever the required energy to walk to the next bench is more than the current energy, I need to sit and restore enough to cover the deficit, plus maybe some more?

So total is 1+1=2. \n\nAlternatively, if in the first step, you restore 2 (so needed is 1, but you could restore 2, but that would add 1 to the total, but then after first step, energy is 3 (3+2=5? Wait, no. Wait, initial m is 3. So first a_i is 4. So needed is 1. So you have to restore 1. Then after moving, energy is 0. Then next a_i is 1. So you need to restore 1. So total is 2. \n\nAlternatively, if you had restored 2 in the first step, then after moving, you have (3+2) -4 =1. Then next a_i is 1, so you can do it. So total restored is 2, which is same as before. So in that case, it's same. But the minimal is still the same. \n\nSo the approach of only restoring exactly the needed amount each time when you can't proceed is optimal. Because any extra would be unnecessary. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is as follows:\n\nInitialize current_energy = m, total_restored =0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list of a's:\n\n   if current_energy < a_i:\n\n       needed = a_i - current_energy\n\n       total_restored += needed\n\n       current_energy += needed\n\n   current_energy -= a_i\n\nProceed until all a_i are processed. The total_restored is the answer.\n\nWait, but the problem says that you can sit on benches to restore. So you can only restore energy when you are on a bench. So the order is: you start on bench 1. Before moving to bench 2, you can sit and restore. Then move. Then on bench 2, you can sit again before moving to bench 3, etc. So the algorithm above is exactly modeling that. Because for each a_i (the distance between bench i and i+1), before moving, you check if you can proceed. If not, you restore on bench i, then proceed. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the code needs to implement this. \n\nLooking at the given code:\n\nThe code has variables x and y. Wait, in the code, the variables are named x and y. Let me check:\n\nIn the code:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nint x,y,su=0,d;\n\nscanf(\"%d%d\",&x,&y);\n\nAh, so x is n, and y is m. Because in the problem statement, the first line of the test case has n and m. So the code uses x for n and y for m. \n\nThen, the loop is for(int i=0; i<x; i++) which is correct since n is x here. \n\nThe code's TODO is inside the for loop. The code currently has su as the variable, but in the printf, it's using su - y>0? ... which probably is wrong. Because su is supposed to be the total restored. \n\nWait, the code's current printf is \"printf(\"%d\\n\",su - y>0?su-y:0);\". That suggests that su is the total energy used? Or maybe the code is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's variables are not properly named. Let me think. \n\nThe code's su is probably the total energy needed, but perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum of all a_i, then subtract the initial m. But that's not correct. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is probably wrong, and the user wants us to fill in the missing code. \n\nThe code's structure is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read x (n) and y (m)\n\n   loop over x elements (the a_i's)\n\n   inside the loop, the code is missing. \n\n   then print su - y if positive else 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the total required energy as the sum of all a_i. Then, the required initial energy is sum(a_i). The initial m is given, so the required is max(0, sum(a_i) - m). But that's not correct, because you can restore energy in between. \n\nWait, but that approach would be wrong. For example, in the first test case of the example given in the problem:\n\nSuppose the example input is like:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n3 3\n\n1 2 3\n\nThen the sum of a_i is 6. m is 3. So sum - m is 3, so the answer would be 3. But according to the note in the problem, the first test case requires 2+1 =3? Wait the note says in the first test case, they restored 2 on bench 2, and 1 on bench 3. So total 3. So that would match. \n\nWait, but in that case, the sum of a_i is 1+2+3=6. m is 3. 6-3=3, so that would give the correct answer. \n\nHmm, but what about another case where the path requires restoring in the middle. Let me think of another example. \n\nSuppose n=2, m=3, a1=4, a2=1. \n\nThe sum is 5. m is 3. 5-3=2. But according to the algorithm I thought of earlier:\n\ncurrent_energy starts at 3. \n\nFirst a_i is 4. current_energy (3) <4. So needed is 1. total_restored +=1. current becomes 4. subtract 4, now 0. \n\nSecond a_i is 1. current is 0 <1. needed is 1. total becomes 2. current becomes 1, subtract 1, 0. \n\nTotal restored is 2, which matches the sum approach. \n\nHmm, so maybe the sum approach is correct? Wait, but why?\n\nWait, the sum of all a_i is the total energy needed. The initial m plus the restored must be at least the sum. So the minimal restored is max(0, sum - m). \n\nWait, that's a different approach. So why does that work?\n\nBecause whenever you can restore any amount at any bench, you can choose to restore exactly the deficit when needed. But the total deficit would be sum - m if sum > m. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the sum is 6, m is 3. 6-3=3, which matches the example's 3. \n\nAnother example: n=1, m=1, a1=2. \n\nsum is 2. m is 1. So required is 1. \n\nThe algorithm would have current_energy 1 <2. So needed 1. total_restored 1. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example where the sum approach works. \n\nWait, so maybe the minimal required is indeed max(0, sum(a_i) - m). \n\nBut why does that work? Because whenever you can restore energy at any bench, you can choose to restore exactly the needed amount each time. The total required is the sum of all a_i minus the initial m. \n\nSo the minimal required is the maximum between 0 and (sum - m). \n\nWait, that's a much simpler solution. \n\nBut why didn't I think of that earlier? Because I thought the problem required considering the order, but maybe the order doesn't matter. \n\nWait, let me think of a case where the sum approach would fail. \n\nSuppose m is 5, and the a_i are [3, 3, 3]. \n\nSum is 9. 9-5=4. \n\nBut let's see the step-by-step:\n\ncurrent_energy =5.\n\nFirst a_i=3: 5 >=3 \u2192 subtract \u2192 2 left.\n\nSecond a_i=3: 2 <3 \u2192 need 1. total_restored +=1 \u2192 current becomes 3. subtract 3 \u2192 0.\n\nThird a_i=3: 0 <3 \u2192 need 3 \u2192 total becomes 4. \n\nTotal is 4, which matches sum - m (9-5=4). \n\nAnother example where the steps require more than the sum approach. Wait, can't think of any. \n\nHmm, so maybe the minimal required is indeed the maximum between 0 and (sum of a_i - m). \n\nIf that's the case, then the code can be written as:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nsum all a_i, then compute max(0, sum - m). \n\nSo the code's current structure is almost correct. The code's su is the sum of a_i. \n\nWait, in the code, the code has su initialized to 0, and in the for loop (over x elements), perhaps adding a_i to su. Then, the printf is (su - y>0 ? su - y :0). \n\nYes! Because su is the sum of a_i, and y is m. So the code is almost correct except for the loop. \n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code's for loop is for(int i=0; i<x; i++), and inside the loop, the TODO is where the a_i is read. \n\nAh, right! The code hasn't read the a_i's yet. So the code's su is supposed to be the sum of the a_i's. \n\nSo the missing code is to read the a_i's and add them to su. \n\nWait, the code's su is initialized to 0. So in the loop, for each a_i, we read it and add to su. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nint a;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &a);\n\nsu += a;\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nIn the for loop:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<x; i++){\n\n    int a;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &a);\n\n    su += a;\n\n}\n\nThen, the printf is correct. \n\nWait, but in the problem's first example, the first test case has n=3, m=3, a = [1,2,3]. The sum is 6. 6-3=3, which matches the example's note. \n\nThe third test case in the example, where you don't need to restore, the sum must be <= m. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the problem reduces to simply computing the sum of all a_i, subtract m, and if it's positive, that's the answer, else 0. \n\nTherefore, the code's missing part is to read the a_i and accumulate their sum into su. \n\nSo the code's TODO is to read the a_i's. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nInside the for loop:\n\nint a;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &a);\n\nsu += a;\n\nSo that's the code to fill in. \n\nWait, but why did I think of the step-by-step approach earlier? Because I thought maybe the order of the a_i's matters, but apparently it doesn't. \n\nThe key insight is that whenever you can restore energy at any bench, you can always choose to restore exactly the needed amount each time. The total required is the total needed over all steps, which is exactly sum(a_i) - m if sum exceeds m. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct with that approach. \n\nSo the code's missing part is to read the a_i and add to su. \n\nTherefore, the code should have in the for loop:\n\nint a;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &a);\n\nsu += a;\n\nSo that's the code to fill in. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to write those three lines inside the for loop. \n\nWait, but the code's variables are x and y. Let me confirm again. \n\nYes, in the code, the variables are declared as:\n\nint x,y,su=0,d;\n\nThen, scanf(\"%d%d\",&x,&y); so x is n, y is m. \n\nThe for loop runs x times (since n is x). \n\nEach a_i is part of the n numbers. So the code's for loop is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is indeed to read each a_i and add to su. \n\nSo the code to fill in is:\n\nint a;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &a);\n\nsu += a;\n\nSo that's the code. \n\nTherefore, the user's code's TODO block should be filled with those three lines. \n\nI think that's the correct solution. \n\nLet me test with the first example's first test case. \n\nTest case 1: n=3, m=3, a = [1,2,3]. \n\nThe code's su will be 6. \n\n6-3=3 \u2192 output 3. Which matches the example's note. \n\nAnother test case where the sum is less than m: \n\nn=2, m=10, a = [3,4]. Sum is 7. 7-10 is negative \u2192 output 0. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case where the a's are in a way that the step-by-step approach would require the same as the sum. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is those three lines."
