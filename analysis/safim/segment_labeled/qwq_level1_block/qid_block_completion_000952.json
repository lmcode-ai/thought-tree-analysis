The problem is about maximizing the AND of all elements in an array after performing at most k operations. Each operation allows us to set a bit in any element to 1. So, the key is to decide which bits to set so that when we take the AND of all elements, it's as large as possible. Hmm, the approach here probably involves considering each bit from the highest to the lowest. Because for the final AND result, a bit can only be set if all elements have that bit set.",
