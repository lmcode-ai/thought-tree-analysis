Let's see:\n\nprefix[1] = p[0], since p[i-1] when i=1 is p[0].\n\nprefix[2] = p[0] + p[1], etc. So the prefix array is the sum of the first i elements of the sorted array (excluding the 0 at the end). \n\nNow, the queries are handled by taking x and y, and outputting prefix[x] - prefix[x - y]. Wait, that would be the sum from the (x - y)th element up to the xth element? Let me see. \n\nWait, the prefix array is cumulative. So prefix[x] is the sum of the first x elements (sorted in descending order). So the first x elements are the x largest elements. The y cheapest among them are the y smallest in those x elements, which are the last y elements of those x. So the sum of those y elements would be the sum of the (x - y)th to (x-1)th elements? Wait, let's think:\n\nSuppose the sorted array is in descending order. The first x elements are the x largest. The y cheapest among them are the y smallest in those x elements, which are the last y elements of those x. So the sum of those y elements is the sum of the elements from position (x - y) to (x-1) in the sorted array. \n\nWait, the first x elements are p[0] to p[x-1]. The y smallest among them are the last y elements of those x elements. So the sum would be sum from (x - y) to (x-1). \n\nThe prefix array is built as prefix[i] = sum of first i elements. So the sum from a to b (inclusive) would be prefix[b+1] - prefix[a]. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the elements are p[0], p[1], p[2], ..., p[x-1]. The sum of the last y elements (positions x - y to x-1) is sum from (x - y) to (x-1). The number of terms is y. \n\nThe sum can be calculated as prefix[x] (sum of first x elements) minus the sum of the first (x - y) elements. Because the first (x - y) elements are p[0] to p[x - y -1]. So the sum from (x - y) to (x-1) is prefix[x] - prefix[x - y]. \n\nYes, that's exactly what the code is doing. So the code's approach is correct. \n\nNow, the problem is to make sure that the code correctly reads the input into the array. The initial loop for reading the p array is missing. The code has:\n\nfor(ll i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the user needs to read the p_i into p[i]. So the line should be cin >> p[i]; \n\nWait, but the array is declared as ll p[n+1], so p[1] to p[n] are the elements. So the loop from 1 to n (inclusive) is correct. \n\nSo the missing code is simply:\n\ncin >> p[i];\n\nSo that's the first part. \n\nWait, but the code then sorts the array p in descending order. But the array includes p[0], which was set to 0. So after sorting, the 0 will be at the end. But when we take the first x elements (excluding the 0?), no. Because the sorted array will have the largest elements first, and the 0 is the last element. So when we take the first x elements, they are all the actual items except possibly the 0. Since all p_i are at least 1, the 0 is the smallest. \n\nSo the code is okay. \n\nWait, but the code's sort is from p to p + (n+1). So the entire array of size n+1 is being sorted. The first element (p[0]) was 0, but after sorting in descending order, the 0 will be at the end. So the first n elements (p[0] to p[n-1]) are the sorted items in descending order, and p[n] is 0. \n\nWait, but when building the prefix array, the loop is for i from 1 to n. So for each i, p[i-1] is the element at index i-1. So for i=1, it's p[0], which is the first element of the sorted array (the largest). So the prefix array is correctly built as the sum of the first i elements of the sorted array (excluding the 0). \n\nTherefore, the code is correct except for the missing input line. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as p_1 to p_n. So the code's array p is 1-based, but after sorting, the first element (p[0]) is the largest. \n\nWait, the code's initial p[0] is set to 0, but then the loop from 1 to n reads the p_i into p[1] to p[n]. Then, when sorted, the entire array (including p[0]) is sorted. So the 0 is part of the array. \n\nWait, that's a problem. Because when we sort the array, the 0 will be considered as part of the elements. For example, if n is 3, then the array has p[0] =0, p[1], p[2], p[3]. The sort will include all four elements. But the actual items are p[1], p[2], p[3]. So after sorting in descending order, the 0 will be the last element. \n\nSo when we take the first x elements (like x=3), the first three elements would be the three items (since the 0 is the fourth element). So that's okay. \n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input given in the note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n1 2 3 5 \n\nQueries:\n\n3 2\n\n2 1\n\n4 3\n\nWait, the input is n=4, q=3, and the p array after reading would be p[1]=1, p[2]=2, p[3]=3, p[4]=5. Then p[0] is 0. \n\nSorting the entire array (size 5) in descending order would arrange the elements as 5,3,2,1,0. \n\nSo the sorted array p would be:\n\np[0] =5, p[1]=3, p[2]=2, p[3]=1, p[4]=0. \n\nThe prefix array is built as:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =5 (sum of first 1 elements)\n\nprefix[2] =5+3=8\n\nprefix[3] =8+2=10\n\nprefix[4] =10+1=11\n\nprefix[5] =11+0=11 (but the loop only goes up to i=4, since n is 4. Wait, the loop is for i from 1 to n (which is 4). So the prefix array will have up to prefix[4] = 11. \n\nNow, for the first query x=3, y=2. The code outputs prefix[3] - prefix[3-2=1] \u2192 10 -5 =5. But according to the note, the answer is 8 (3+5). Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the first query in the note says the answer is 8. Let me see. \n\nIn the first query, x=3, y=2. The customer buys 3 items. The two cheapest of them are 3 and 5 (assuming the items are 5,3,5). Wait, the example's note says the items are 5,3,5. Wait, perhaps the input in the note is different. Let me check the note again. \n\nThe note says:\n\nIn the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest are 3+5=8. \n\nWait, so the items are 5,3,5. So the sorted array would be 5,5,3. So the first 3 elements (since x=3) would be 5,5,3. The two cheapest are 3 and 5 (the two smallest in those three). So their sum is 3+5=8. \n\nBut according to the code's approach, the sorted array (excluding the 0) would be 5,5,3, ... (assuming the input was different). \n\nWait, perhaps in the code's current setup, the problem is that the initial p[0] is 0, which is included in the sort. Let me re-calculate with the example given in the note. \n\nSuppose the input is n=3, and the p array (after reading) is p[1]=5, p[2]=3, p[3]=5. Then p[0] is 0. \n\nSorting the array (size 4) in descending order would give p[0]=5, p[1]=5, p[2]=3, p[3]=0. \n\nThe prefix array would be:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =5 (sum of first 1 elements)\n\nprefix[2] =5+5=10\n\nprefix[3] =10+3=13\n\nprefix[4] =13+0=13 (but the loop stops at i=3 since n=3). \n\nSo for the first query x=3, y=2:\n\nprefix[3] - prefix[3-2] \u2192 13 -5 =8, which matches the note. \n\nAh okay, so the code works in that case. \n\nSo the problem is that the code's initial setup is correct except for the missing input line. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is simply to read the p_i into p[i]. \n\nSo the code inside the loop should be:\n\ncin >> p[i];\n\nSo the user needs to fill that in. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO is:\n\ncin >> p[i];\n\nThat's all. \n\nWait, but the code uses ll for the array. The input is given as integers, but since the p_i can be up to 1e6, using ll is okay. \n\nSo the only missing part is the cin >> p[i]; in the loop. \n\nYes, that's the only missing code. \n\nSo the answer is to output that line."
