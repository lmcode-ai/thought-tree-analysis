      "text": "Wait, let me check the ranges again. Division 2 is 1600-1899. So if the rating is 1899, it's division 2. So the condition for division2 is between 1600 and 1899. So if after checking division1 (which is >=1900), then the next condition is if (rating >=1600) would catch division2. Because if it's 1600 or higher but less than 1900, that's division2. Similarly, division3 is 1400 to 1599. So if after division2's condition fails (so less than 1600), then check if >=1400. Then division3. Else, division4. Yes, that logic works. So code steps:\n\nRead the rating. Check:\n\nif (rating >=1900) \u2192 cout \"Division 1\"\n\nelse if (rating >=1600) \u2192 Division 2\n\nelse if (rating >=1400) \u2192 Division3\n\nelse \u2192 Division4\n\nSo inside the loop:\n\nint rating;\n\ncin >> rating;\n\nThen the if-else chain. Wait, but what about ratings below the minimum? Like the note says some test cases have -789, which is division4. The code should handle that since the else will catch it. So putting that all together. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nint rating;\n\ncin >> rating;\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n\n    cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n\n    cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n\n    cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n\n} else {\n\n    cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n\n}\n\nThat should cover all cases. Wait, let's test the examples given in the notes. Test case 1: -789 \u2192 division4. Correct.\n\n1299 \u2192 division4. Yes, since 1299 <1400.\n\n1300 \u2192 same, division4.\n\n1399 \u2192 also division4.\n\nFifth test case 1400 \u2192 division3. Correct.\n\nSixth:1679 \u2192 division2.\n\nSeventh:2300 \u2192 division1. All correct. So the code should work. Now, the code in the loop must read the rating and do this. So the missing part is exactly that. So the code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nint rating; cin>>rating; if(rating>=1900) cout<<\"Division 1\\n\"; else if(rating>=1600) cout<<\"Division 2\\n\"; else if(rating>=1400) cout<<\"Division 3\\n\"; else cout<<\"Division 4\\n\"; But I have to write it properly with semicolons and braces. Wait, in C++, the if-else can be written with or without braces, but to avoid issues, perhaps the code uses braces.
