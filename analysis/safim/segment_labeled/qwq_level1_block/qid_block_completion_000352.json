      "text": "The i-th block's length is ceil(i/2). So for each i from 1 to n, the length is (i+1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even. So ceil(i/2) is equal to floor((i+1)/2). So the sum S(n) is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let me compute this sum. Let's see:\n\nFor even i: i=2k, ceil(2k/2)=k. So for i=2k, the term is k. For odd i: i=2k-1, ceil((2k-1)/2) =k. So for i=2k-1, the term is k. So for each pair of terms (i=2k-1 and i=2k), their sum is k +k =2k. The total sum can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet n be even or odd. Let's split into cases. Suppose n is even: n=2m. Then the terms are grouped into m pairs. Each pair (2k-1, 2k) contributes 2k. So the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) ) = m(m+1). Wait let's see for n=2 (m=1): sum is 1+1=2. m(m+1)=1*2=2. Correct.\n\nn=4 (m=2): 1+1+2+2 =6. 2*3=6. Correct. If n is odd: n=2m+1. Then the first 2m terms form m pairs, sum m(m+1), plus the last term (2m+1) which is ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1. So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Wait let's test n=5 (2m+1 where m=2). Then m+1 is 3. 3 squared is 9, which matches the example. For n=1 (m=0), sum is 1, which is (0+1)^2=1. Correct. For n=3 (m=1), sum is 1+1+2 =4, which is (1+1)^2=4. Correct. So the formula for the sum S(n) is:\n\nif n is even: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1 ) if n is odd: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2 \n\nAlternatively, since for n even, n=2m, so m =n/2, so S(n)= m*(m+1). For n odd, n=2m+1, so m = (n-1)/2, so S(n) = (m+1)^2 = ((n+1)/2)^2. Alternatively, combining both cases, S(n) can be written as floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). Wait let me see:\n\nWait for even n=2m, (n+1)/2 is m+0.5, so floor is m, ceil is m+1. So product m*(m+1) which matches.\n\nFor odd n=2m+1, (n+1)/2 is m+1, so floor and ceil are same, so (m+1)^2. So yes, the formula can be written as floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). But perhaps it's easier to compute based on parity. So the sum S(n) is:\n\nS(n) = ( (n div 2) ) * ( (n+1) div 2 )\n\nBecause for even n, n div 2 is m, (n+1)/2 is m + 0.5, so (n+1) div 2 is m+1. So m*(m+1). For odd n, n div 2 is m, (n+1)/2 is m+1, so (m)*(m+1) + (m+1) ? Wait no, perhaps the formula is indeed S(n) = floor(n/2) * ceil(n/2) + (if n is odd, add ceil(n/2) ?) Wait no, perhaps the formula is S(n) = ceil(n/2) * floor( (n+1)/2 ) ? Hmm, maybe I should just code it as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nelse:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nSo that's straightforward. Once we have the sum S(n), the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of S(n). Because s^2 must be <= S(n), and we want the maximum s.\n\nWait let me test with the example. For n=5, sum is 9, sqrt(9)=3, so s=3. Correct. Another test case: n=2, sum is 2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so floor is 1. Which is correct, since you can use one of the two 1-length blocks to make 1x1. Another test case: n=3, sum is 4. sqrt(4)=2, so s=2. That makes sense. Using all three blocks (1+1+2=4) gives a 2x2 square. So the approach is:",

For N=3, (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 correct. For N=6, 3.5 floored to 3 \u2192 correct. So yes, the maximum s is floor( (N+1)/2 ). Wait but wait, let me think again. Wait for N=6, the sum is 12. The maximum s is 3, which is exactly floor( (6+1)/2 ) =3.5 floored to 3. Correct. Wait so the maximum s is floor( (N+1)/2 ). So the formula is s = (N+1)/2 rounded down. Which is equivalent to integer division (N+1)//2. Wait (N+1) divided by 2, using integer division. Because for even N, (N+1)/2 is not integer, but integer division truncates. So for N even, (N+1)//2 is (N)/2. For example N=6: 7//2=3. For N=5:6//2=3. So yes, exactly the same as the previous approach. So the maximum s is simply floor( (N+1)/2 ), which is (N+1)//2 in integer division. Wait but wait, let me check with N=7. (7+1)/2 is 4, which is correct. N=8: (8+1)/2=4.5 \u2192 floor is 4. Which is correct (sum is 4*5=20, sqrt(20)=4.47, floor 4). So this formula works. So the maximum s is (N+1)//2 ? Wait that can't be right. Wait for N=5, the sum is 9, so s is 3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. For N=6, sum is 12, s is 3.605's floor is 3, which is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 floor 3. Correct. Wait so the maximum s is exactly (N+1)//2 ? Wait that's a much simpler solution. So why compute the sum at all? Wait, because the sum S(n) for even N is m*(m+1) where m=N/2. The maximum s is floor( sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Since m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2, the floor is m. So s is m = N/2. For odd N, the sum is m\u00b2 where m=(N+1)/2, so sqrt is m. So s is m. So combining both cases, s is floor( (N+1)/2 ), which is exactly (N+1)//2 in integer division. So the maximum s is simply (N+1)//2 ? Wait that's a huge simplification. So the problem reduces to outputting (N+1)//2 ? Wait but let me test with N=5. (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct. N=6 \u2192 3.5 \u2192 3, which is correct. N=7 \u21924, correct. N=1 \u21921, correct. N=2 \u21921.5 \u21921, correct. N=4 \u21922.5 \u21922, correct. So yes, this works. Wait so why was the example given in the problem statement for N=5, the answer is 3, which matches (5+1)/2=3. So this formula works. Wait so the problem is actually much simpler than I thought. The maximum s is simply floor( (N+1)/2 ). So the code can be written as:\n\nfor each test case N:\n\ns = (N+1)/2 (integer division)\n\noutput s.\n\nWait but why does this hold?

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given n blocks, each with a certain length, I have to find the maximum square side length possible. Let's see.\n\nThe blocks are numbered from 1 to n. The i-th block has a length of ceil(i/2). So for each i, the length is (i+1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even. Because ceil division by 2. So for example, i=1 gives 1, i=2 also 1, i=3 is 2, etc.\n\nThe square's side length is s. The area of the square is s^2. The total length of all the blocks used must be at least s^2, but since each block is 1 unit high, the sum of their lengths must be >= s\u00b2. But also, the arrangement must form a square. Wait, but the problem says we can arrange them without rotating, so the square's side is the maximum between the height and the length? Wait no, the square's side is s, so both dimensions must be exactly s. Since each block is 1 unit high, stacking them vertically would contribute to the height. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait the problem says the square is formed using the blocks without rotating. Each block is 1x length. So when building the square, each block is placed such that its 1-unit side is along the height (so the square's height is built by stacking these 1-unit heights). Wait, but the square's side is s, so the total height must be s, and the total length in each row must also be s. Hmm, maybe I need to think of the square as being built by arranging the blocks in rows. Each row's total length must be exactly s, and there must be exactly s rows, since the height is s (each block contributes 1 to the height when placed vertically? Or maybe the blocks are placed horizontally, so their length contributes to the square's length, and their height (1) contributes to the square's height. So the square's height is exactly the number of blocks stacked vertically? Wait, perhaps the problem is that the square's side is s, so the total area must be s\u00b2. Each block contributes an area of 1 * (ceil(i/2)), so the sum of all selected blocks' lengths must be >= s\u00b2. But since we can choose any subset of the blocks, the maximum s is the largest where the sum of the first k blocks (for some k <=n) is >= s\u00b2. Wait no, but the sum of all blocks up to n must be at least s squared, but we can choose any subset. Wait, actually, to maximize s, we need the sum of the lengths of the selected blocks to be at least s\u00b2, and we want the maximum s where this is possible. So the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that the sum of the lengths of the first m blocks (for some m <=n) is >= s\u00b2. Because using more blocks can only increase the sum, so the maximum possible s is determined by the total sum of all blocks up to n. Wait, but maybe the sum of all blocks is S, then the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S)). But that might not be correct because maybe the sum is exactly s\u00b2, but perhaps the arrangement isn't possible? Wait the problem says that the square can be formed as long as the total area is at least s\u00b2? Or exactly?\n\nWait the problem says \"using these blocks, without rotating any of them\". The square's area is s\u00b2, so the sum of the areas of the blocks used must be exactly s\u00b2. Because otherwise, if the sum is more than s\u00b2, you can't form the square. Wait no, maybe you can choose a subset of the blocks whose total area is exactly s\u00b2. So the problem is to find the maximum s where there exists a subset of the blocks (from 1 to n) such that the sum of their lengths (since each has height 1) is exactly s\u00b2. Because the square's area is s\u00b2, so the total area of the blocks used must equal s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest integer s where the sum of some subset of the blocks' lengths equals s\u00b2. But how do we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows using the blocks in such a way that their total area is at least s\u00b2, but the square's area is exactly s\u00b2. But that might not be possible. Hmm, the problem statement says \"maximum possible side length of a square you can create using these blocks\". So the square must be formed exactly, so the sum of the selected blocks' lengths must be exactly s squared. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 total_sum, and there exists a subset of the blocks with sum exactly s\u00b2. But how do we compute that?\n\nWait, but maybe the sum of all the blocks is S. Then the maximum possible s is the floor of sqrt(S). Because if S is the total sum, then s_max is the largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S. Because you can take all the blocks, their total is S, so you can form a square of s_max. But is that correct?\n\nWait let's see the example given. For n=5, the blocks have lengths 1,1,2,2,3. The total sum is 1+1+2+2+3 =9. So s_max would be 3, which matches the example. So that works. Another example: if n=1, sum is 1, so s is 1. That also matches the note. So perhaps the problem is indeed to compute the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum of all the blocks up to n. So the key is to compute the sum of the first n blocks, then take the integer part of the square root.\n\nWait but how do we compute the sum of the first n blocks? Let's see. The i-th block's length is ceil(i/2). So for each i from 1 to n, the length is (i+1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even. So ceil(i/2) is equal to floor((i+1)/2). So the sum S(n) is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet me compute this sum. Let's see:\n\nFor even i: i=2k, ceil(2k/2)=k. So for i=2k, the term is k.\n\nFor odd i: i=2k-1, ceil((2k-1)/2) =k. So for i=2k-1, the term is k.\n\nSo for each pair of terms (i=2k-1 and i=2k), their sum is k +k =2k. \n\nThe total sum can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet n be even or odd. Let's split into cases.\n\nSuppose n is even: n=2m. Then the terms are grouped into m pairs. Each pair (2k-1, 2k) contributes 2k. So the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) )= m(m+1). \n\nWait let's see for n=2 (m=1): sum is 1+1=2. m(m+1)=1*2=2. Correct.\n\nn=4 (m=2): 1+1+2+2 =6. 2*3=6. Correct.\n\nIf n is odd: n=2m+1. Then the first 2m terms form m pairs, sum m(m+1), plus the last term (2m+1) which is ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1. So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2.\n\nWait let's test n=5 (2m+1 where m=2). Then m+1 is 3. 3 squared is 9, which matches the example. For n=1 (m=0), sum is 1, which is (0+1)^2=1. Correct. For n=3 (m=1), sum is 1+1+2 =4, which is (1+1)^2=4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for the sum S(n) is:\n\nif n is even: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1 )\n\nif n is odd: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2 \n\nAlternatively, since for n even, n=2m, so m =n/2, so S(n)= m*(m+1). For n odd, n=2m+1, so m = (n-1)/2, so S(n) = (m+1)^2 = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nAlternatively, combining both cases, S(n) can be written as floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). Wait let me see:\n\nWait for even n=2m, (n+1)/2 is m+0.5, so floor is m, ceil is m+1. So product m*(m+1) which matches.\n\nFor odd n=2m+1, (n+1)/2 is m+1, so floor and ceil are same, so (m+1)^2. So yes, the formula can be written as floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). But perhaps it's easier to compute based on parity.\n\nSo the sum S(n) is:\n\nS(n) = ( (n div 2) ) * ( (n+1) div 2 )\n\nBecause for even n, n div 2 is m, (n+1)/2 is m + 0.5, so (n+1) div 2 is m+1. So m*(m+1).\n\nFor odd n, n div 2 is m, (n+1)/2 is m+1, so (m)*(m+1) + (m+1) ?\n\nWait no, perhaps the formula is indeed S(n) = floor(n/2) * ceil(n/2) + (if n is odd, add ceil(n/2) ?) Wait no, perhaps the formula is S(n) = ceil(n/2) * floor( (n+1)/2 ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe I should just code it as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nelse:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nSo that's straightforward.\n\nOnce we have the sum S(n), the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of S(n). Because s^2 must be <= S(n), and we want the maximum s.\n\nWait let me test with the example. For n=5, sum is 9, sqrt(9)=3, so s=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, sum is 2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so floor is 1. Which is correct, since you can use one of the two 1-length blocks to make 1x1.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, sum is 4. sqrt(4)=2, so s=2. That makes sense. Using all three blocks (1+1+2=4) gives a 2x2 square.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each test case n, compute S(n) as per the formula above, then compute the integer part of sqrt(S(n)).\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating S(n) efficiently, then taking the square root.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute S(n) quickly, given that n can be up to 1e9, and T is up to 1e4. So per test case, the computation must be O(1).\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead T test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nCompute S(n):\n\nif n is even:\n\nm = n/2\n\nS = m*(m+1)\n\nelse:\n\nm = (n+1)/2\n\nS = m*m\n\nThen compute s = floor( sqrt(S) )\n\nOutput s.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Let's say n=6 (even). Then m=3, S=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so floor is 3. So the maximum s is 3. Let's see:\n\nThe blocks are 1,1,2,2,3,3. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3 =12. So s=3, since 3^2=9 <=12, but 4^2=16>12. So correct.\n\nAnother example: n=7 (odd). m=(7+1)/2 =4. So S=4^2=16. sqrt(16)=4. So s=4. That's correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, coding this in C++.\n\nThe code given has:\n\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std ;\nint T , N ; \nint main( ) {\n\t/* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nWe need to read T test cases, each with N, compute S, then compute s as floor(sqrt(S)), then output s.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead T.\n\nLoop T times:\n\nRead N.\n\nCompute S:\n\nif N%2 ==0:\n\nm = N/2\n\nS = m*(m+1)\n\nelse:\n\nm = (N+1)/2\n\nS = m*m\n\nThen compute s as sqrt(S). But need to be careful with integer sqrt.\n\nWait, since S is a perfect square in the case when N is odd. Because when N is odd, S is m squared. So sqrt(S) is exactly m, so s is m. For even N, S is m*(m+1). The sqrt of that is between m and m+1. So floor is m.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nFor even N:\n\nS = m*(m+1). Let's see m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. So sqrt(S) is between m and m+1, so floor is m.\n\nThus, the maximum s is m for even N, and m for odd N (since m is sqrt(S)).\n\nWait wait, for even N, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Let's see:\n\nTake m=3 (N=6). m*(m+1)=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, floor is 3, which is m. So yes.\n\nAnother example m=4 (N=8). 4*5=20. sqrt(20)=4.472, floor is 4 = m.\n\nSo for even N, s is m = N/2.\n\nWait wait, but for even N, the s is floor( sqrt(S) ), which is m. Because m*(m+1) is less than (m+0.5)^2 ?\n\nWait m*(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. (m + 0.5)^2 = m\u00b2 + m + 0.25. So m*(m+1) is less than (m+0.5)^2. So sqrt(m*(m+1)) is less than m+0.5, so floor is m.\n\nThus, for even N, s is m = N/2.\n\nFor odd N, s is m = (N+1)/2.\n\nWait so in code, the s can be computed as:\n\nif N is even:\n\ns = m = N/2\n\nelse:\n\ns = m = (N+1)/2\n\nWait that's even simpler! Because sqrt(S) for even N is floor to m, and for odd N it's exactly m.\n\nSo the maximum s is:\n\ns = floor( (N+1)/2 )\n\nWait wait, let me see:\n\nWait for even N:\n\nN is even, so (N+1)/2 is a half-integer. The floor of that is N/2.\n\nFor example N=6: (6+1)/2 =3.5 \u2192 floor is 3, which is N/2=3.\n\nFor N=5 (odd), (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 which is exactly m=3, which is correct.\n\nWait so the maximum s is floor( (N+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nWait for N=2 (even):\n\ns would be (2+1)/2 =1.5 \u2192 floor is 1. Which is correct (sum is 2, s=1).\n\nN=4 even: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor 2. Sum is 4*5/2? Wait no, for N=4 even, m=2, so S=2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is correct. So yes, floor( (N+1)/2 ) gives 2.5 floored to 2.\n\nWait so the maximum s is floor( (N+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait that's a much simpler formula. Wait, but let me check for N=7 (odd):\n\n(N+1)/2 is 4 \u2192 which is correct. For N=5, it's 3, correct. For N=1, (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 correct. For N=3, (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 correct. For N=6, 3.5 floored to 3 \u2192 correct. So yes, the maximum s is floor( (N+1)/2 ). Wait but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait for N=6, the sum is 12. The maximum s is 3, which is exactly floor( (6+1)/2 ) =3.5 floored to 3. Correct.\n\nWait so the maximum s is floor( (N+1)/2 ). So the formula is s = (N+1)/2 rounded down. Which is equivalent to integer division (N+1)//2.\n\nWait (N+1) divided by 2, using integer division. Because for even N, (N+1)/2 is not integer, but integer division truncates. So for N even, (N+1)//2 is (N)/2. For example N=6: 7//2=3. For N=5:6//2=3. So yes, exactly the same as the previous approach.\n\nSo the maximum s is simply floor( (N+1)/2 ), which is (N+1)//2 in integer division.\n\nWait but wait, let me check with N=7. (7+1)/2 is 4, which is correct. N=8: (8+1)/2=4.5 \u2192 floor is 4. Which is correct (sum is 4*5=20, sqrt(20)=4.47, floor 4).\n\nSo this formula works. So the maximum s is (N+1)//2 ?\n\nWait that can't be right. Wait for N=5, the sum is 9, so s is 3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. For N=6, sum is 12, s is 3.605's floor is 3, which is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 floor 3. Correct.\n\nWait so the maximum s is exactly (N+1)//2 ?\n\nWait that's a much simpler solution. So why compute the sum at all?\n\nWait, because the sum S(n) for even N is m*(m+1) where m=N/2. The maximum s is floor( sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Since m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2, the floor is m. So s is m = N/2. For odd N, the sum is m\u00b2 where m=(N+1)/2, so sqrt is m. So s is m. So combining both cases, s is floor( (N+1)/2 ), which is exactly (N+1)//2 in integer division.\n\nSo the maximum s is simply (N+1)//2 ?\n\nWait that's a huge simplification. So the problem reduces to outputting (N+1)//2 ?\n\nWait but let me test with N=5. (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct. N=6 \u2192 3.5 \u2192 3, which is correct. N=7 \u21924, correct. N=1 \u21921, correct. N=2 \u21921.5 \u21921, correct. N=4 \u21922.5 \u21922, correct. So yes, this works.\n\nWait so why was the example given in the problem statement for N=5, the answer is 3, which matches (5+1)/2=3. So this formula works.\n\nWait so the problem is actually much simpler than I thought. The maximum s is simply floor( (N+1)/2 ). So the code can be written as:\n\nfor each test case N:\n\ns = (N+1)/2 (integer division)\n\noutput s.\n\nWait but why does this hold?\n\nBecause the sum S(n) is exactly m^2 when n is odd (m=(n+1)/2), so s is m. When n is even, the sum is m(m+1), which is just less than (m+0.5)^2. So the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)) is m, which is exactly N/2. And (N+1)/2 when even N is (even N +1)/2, which is a half-integer, so integer division truncates to N/2. So yes, the formula holds.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead T, then for each test case, read N, compute (N+1)/2 using integer division (since in C++, (N+1)/2 when using / with integers does that).\n\nWait in C++, for even N, (N+1)/2 is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3 when using integer division. So yes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nSo the missing code in the main function is:\n\ncin >> T;\n\nwhile(T--){\n\n    cin >> N;\n\n    cout << (N +1)/2 << endl;\n\n}\n\nWait that's all? Because the problem's solution is that simple?\n\nWait but let me check with another example. Let's say N=7. (7+1)/2=4. The sum is 16, sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\nAnother example N=8: (8+1)/2=4.5 \u2192 4. The sum is 4*5=20. sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case N=9 (odd): (9+1)/2=5. Sum is (5)^2=25 \u2192 s=5. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is as above.\n\nWait but the code given in the problem has variables T and N declared globally. So in the code:\n\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std ;\nint T , N ; \nint main( ) {\n    cin >> T;\n    while(T--){\n        cin >> N;\n        cout << (N +1)/2 << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but in C++, when you do (N+1)/2 for even numbers, like N=6, (6+1) is 7, divided by 2 gives 3.5 \u2192 3 as integer division. Which is correct.\n\nYes, so that's the code."
