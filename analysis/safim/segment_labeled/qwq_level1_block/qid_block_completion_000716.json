The current code uses scanf for t, so maybe continue with scanf here. So something like scanf(\"%d\", &rating);. Then, check the value of rating and decide which division. Let's think about the conditions. The order of checks matters here. For example, if I check division 1 first, then division 2, etc., that should work. The conditions:\n\nIf rating >= 1900 \u2192 Division 1.\n\nElse if rating >=1600 \u2192 Division 2.\n\nElse if rating >=1400 \u2192 Division3.\n\nElse \u2192 Division4.

Once the division is determined, we need to output \"Division X\" where X is 1-4. So, after calculating which division, we can use printf with the appropriate string. Putting it all together:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &rating);\n\nThen the conditional checks. Wait, code structure:\n\nAfter reading the rating, perhaps:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n\n    printf(\"Division 1\\n\");\n\n} else if (rating >=1600) {\n\n    printf(\"Division 2\\n\");\n\n} else if (rating >=1400) {\n\n    printf(\"Division 3\\n\");\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"Division 4\\n\");\n\n}\n\nThat should work.
