Since the divisions are in ranges, maybe using if-else statements would work. Let's outline the logic:\n\nIf the rating is >=1900 \u2192 Division 1.\nElse, check if it's between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 Division 2.\nElse, check if between 1400 and 1599 \u2192 Division3. Else, Division4. So the order of checking is important here. Let me write the code steps. First, inside the loop, read the rating:\n\nint rating = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen, the conditions:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 1\");\n} else if (rating >=1600) {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 2\");\n} else if (rating >=1400) {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 3\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 4\");\n} Wait, let me check the ranges again. For Division 2, it's 1600 \u2264 rating \u22641899. So if the first condition (>=1900) is false, then check if it's >=1600, which would cover up to 1899. That's correct. Then, if not, check if >=1400, which would be 1400-1599. And else is <=1399. That seems right. Testing the examples given:\n\nLike the note says, for 1399, it would go to else if (1399 >=1600? no), then else if (1399 >=1400? no), so else \u2192 division4. Correct.\n\n1400: the third condition is yes, so division3. Correct.\n\n1679: in the second condition (>=1600 but less than 1900 \u2192 division2. Correct.\n\n2300 \u2192 division1. All looks good. So that's the code to put inside the loop. So the missing part is reading the rating and these conditionals. So putting it all together, inside the while loop:\n\nint rating = sc.nextInt();\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 1\");\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 2\");\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 3\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Division 4\");\n} Yes, that should do it.
