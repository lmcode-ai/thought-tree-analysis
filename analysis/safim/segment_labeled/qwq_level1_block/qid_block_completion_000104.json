  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see what the problem is here. The task is to compute the minimum time to reach each city from city 1, considering that Stanley can take at most k flights. The flights between any two cities u and v take (u - v)^2 time, but he can only use up to k of them. The roads are given with their travel times, and we have to choose paths that use roads and flights optimally, with the flight count constraint.\n\nLooking at the provided code, I need to figure out what's missing and how to complete the code so it works. Let me go through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the code starts with some includes and variables. The input is read, then the roads are added to an adjacency list. The dij function is a Dijkstra's algorithm, but it's incomplete. The main function uses a loop for up to k flights, involving a DP step (dp function) and then running Dijkstra again.\n\nHmm, the main structure seems to involve a dynamic programming approach where for each step of adding a flight, the dp function updates the possible distances using that flight. But I'm not entirely sure how the code is structured here.\n\nLooking at the dij function: it's supposed to perform Dijkstra's algorithm. The loop processes nodes from the priority queue, and for each neighbor, checks if the distance can be improved. The TODO comment is in the part where the new distance is considered. So the code inside the 'if (dis[y] > ...' block is missing. That code is probably supposed to update the distance and push to the priority queue. The standard Dijkstra step would be:\n\nif (dis[y] > dis[x] + va[i]) {\n    dis[y] = dis[x] + va[i];\n    if (!vi[y]) q.push(make_pair(dis[y], y));\n}\n\nWait, but the priority queue here is a max-heap, because the code uses a priority_queue<pair<ll, int>> which by default is a max-heap. However, Dijkstra usually uses a min-heap. That's a problem here. Wait, looking at how the queue is used in the code:\n\nWait in the main function, when they push to the queue, they use mp(0,1), then later when pushing f[j], they do mp(-dis[j], j). Oh right, maybe because the priority queue is stored as a max-heap, to get the minimum, they are using negative distances? Let me see:\n\nYes, in the code, when pushing to the queue, they use mp(-dis[j], j). Because the priority queue is a max-heap, so storing the negative allows the smallest dis[j] to come first. So the 'dis[y]' is the distance, so when we have a better distance, we need to set dis[y] to the new value and then push it to the queue with the new distance (as a negative value).\n\nSo the code inside the if statement should be:\n\ndis[y] = dis[x] + va[i];\nq.push( mp(-dis[y], y) ); \n\nWait but since we are in the context of the Dijkstra function, which uses vi to mark visited nodes. So once a node is popped from the queue, it's marked as visited, so pushing it again won't matter because when we process the node again, it's already marked as visited. So the standard Dijkstra steps would be applied here.\n\nWait, but in the current code's dij function, the code after checking the edge is a TODO. So the missing code is to update the distance and push to the priority queue. So the code should be something like:\n\nif (dis[y] > dis[x] + va[i]) {\n    dis[y] = dis[x] + va[i];\n    q.push( mp(-dis[y], y) );\n}\n\nWait but the priority_queue is a max heap, so using the negative distance. So the mp should indeed be with -dis[y]. Also, since the priority is based on the first element of the pair, which is the distance stored as negative here, so the smallest distance comes first.\n\nSo that's part one: filling in the missing code in the dij function's edge loop.\n\nNow, moving on to the DP part. The code has a dp function that's supposed to compute f[i], which probably represents the minimum distance when using i flights. But the code's structure is a bit unclear. Let me think about the approach here.\n\nThe problem is similar to the classic \"shortest path with limited number of edges of a certain type\". Here, flights can be taken up to k times, but each flight's time is (u-v)^2, and roads are given. Since k can be up to 20, the standard approach is to use a modified Dijkstra with states tracking the number of flights taken so far.\n\nAlternatively, the code here seems to use a dynamic programming approach where for each step (each flight allowed), it computes the best possible path using up to that many flights.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the main function loops over i from 1 to k, and for each step, calls dp(), then updates dis[j] with f[j] (the new possible distances after using one more flight?), and then runs Dijkstra again. Hmm, perhaps the dp function is trying to model the transition from the current state (using i-1 flights) to using i flights.\n\nLet me look at the dp function. The function 'dp()' starts by initializing t=0. Then for each i from 1 to n:\n\nWait the loop is for (int i=1; i<=n; i+=1). Wait, no, in the code for dp():\n\n    for(int i=1,j;i<=n;i+=1){\n        while(t>1){\n            if(slope(s[t-1],s[t])>=slope(s[t],i)) t-=1;\n            else break;\n        }\n        s[++t]=i;\n    }\n\nWait wait, wait. That loop is inside the dp() function. Wait the code seems to be doing some kind of convex hull trick. The variables s is an array that's being maintained. The slope function computes the slope between two points.\n\nWait, perhaps the dp function is part of a convex hull trick optimization for dynamic programming. Let me think: when adding a flight, the new distance for a city can be calculated based on existing distances with one fewer flight. The flight between any two cities can be considered as an edge of weight (distance to city x) + (x - y)^2. So when you have a current minimum distance to city x with (i-1) flights, then taking a flight to city y would give a new distance of (distance[x] + (x - y)^2), and using i flights. To find the minimal distance to y for i flights, you can consider all x and choose the minimal value over x of (distance[x] + (x - y)^2). \n\nBut doing this naively for each y would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 1e5. So the convex hull trick is used here to find the minimum efficiently.\n\nSo the 'dp()' function is probably precomputing the convex hull for the current distances (from the previous steps), then for each y, compute the minimal value of (distance[x] + (x - y)^2 ), which can be rephrased as (distance[x] + x\u00b2) - 2x*y + y\u00b2. Let's see:\n\ndistance[x] is the current distance (using up to i-1 flights). For a flight from x to y, the total time added is (x - y)^2, so the new distance would be distance[x] + (x - y)^2. \n\nWe can reorganize the term:\n\ndistance[x] + (x - y)^2 = (distance[x] + x\u00b2) - 2xy + y\u00b2\n\nSo when we want to find the minimum over x of (distance[x] + x\u00b2 - 2xy) + y\u00b2. The y\u00b2 term is a constant per y, so the term to minimize for each y is (distance[x] + x\u00b2 - 2xy). Then adding y\u00b2 gives the total.\n\nSo for each y, the minimal value is the minimum over x of ( (distance[x] + x\u00b2) - 2xy ), plus y\u00b2. \n\nThe convex hull trick can be applied here because the expression is linear in terms of y. Let me see:\n\nLet's denote a_x = distance[x] + x\u00b2, and b_x = -2x. Then the expression becomes a_x + b_x * y. \n\nThe minimum of a_x + b_x y over x can be found using a convex hull trick where the lines are represented by (b_x, a_x). Since we are looking for the minimum, we need the lower envelope of the lines. \n\nThe 'dp()' function may be setting up the convex hull for these lines. The 's' array holds the indices (cities) in an order that forms the lower envelope. \n\nLooking at the code in dp():\n\nThe loop for i from 1 to n (the cities?), but the code has a loop where for each i (the current city?), it's adding lines into the convex hull structure. Then, for each city j, we compute the minimal value by finding the best line in the lower envelope at the point y = 2i (since the slope's condition is find(2.0*i)). Wait, perhaps the code is structured as follows:\n\nThe 'find' function is determining which line in the convex hull gives the minimum value at x = 2i. The 'slope(s[mid], s[mid+1])' is comparing the slopes between consecutive lines, and the condition is to find the line where the slope is <= the desired x (which is 2i here). \n\nWait, the 'find' function is passing 2.0*i as the parameter. Let me see the 'slope' function:\n\nlong double slope(int x, int y) {\n    return (dis[y] + y*y - dis[x] - x*x) / (y - x);\n}\n\nAh right. So for two lines represented by cities x and y, their slope is (a_y - a_x)/(y - x), where a_x = dis[x] + x\u00b2. \n\nThe 'find' function is given a parameter x (the desired slope?), but in the code's dp function, for each j (city?), it calls 'find(2.0*i)' \u2014 but wait, in the code's current dp function, the loop is for 'i' from 1 to n, and in the 'dp()' function after building the convex hull, the code loops over i again (but maybe in the code, that's a typo?)\n\nWait, the code's 'dp()' function has:\n\nvoid dp() {\n    ll x,y; t=0;\n    for(int i=1; i<=n; i+=1) { \n        while (t>1) { \n            if (slope(s[t-1], s[t]) >= slope(s[t], i)) t--;\n            else break;\n        }\n        s[++t] = i;\n    }\n    for (int i=1, j; i<=n; i++) {\n        j = find(2.0*i);\n        f[i] = dis[j] + 1LL*(i-j)*(i-j);\n    }\n    return;\n}\n\nWait, the first loop in dp() is for each city i (from 1 to n). For each i, they are adding the line corresponding to city i into the convex hull structure. The 'slope(s[t-1], s[t])' and 'slope(s[t],i)' are comparing the lines. The condition is that if the slope between s[t-1] and s[t] is greater than or equal to the slope between s[t] and current i, then we remove s[t]. \n\nThis is building the convex hull in a way that the lines are in a certain order. The convex hull is built in such a way that the lines are stored in s in an order where the slopes between consecutive lines are increasing or something like that. \n\nOnce the convex hull is built, the second loop iterates over each city j (i?), and for each j, it finds the best line (the one that gives the minimal value at y = 2*j). Wait the 'find(2.0*i)' is using the parameter x = 2*i. The 'find' function is trying to find the line in the convex hull where the slope between that line and the next is less than or equal to x. \n\nWait the 'find' function's purpose is to find the line in the lower envelope where the optimal x is achieved at the given parameter. The parameter here is 2*i, which comes from the derivative of the quadratic function. Because when considering the expression a_x + b_x*y, the minimal value over lines occurs where the slope between two lines is equal to y. \n\nWait, when we have multiple lines, the minimal value at a particular y is achieved at a point where the lines cross such that their slopes are around y. The find function is using binary search to locate the correct line. \n\nIn the code's f[i] = dis[j] + (i-j)^2. Wait, let me see:\n\nThe minimal value for f[i], which is the distance to city i using one more flight (since the DP is building up steps), would be the minimal (dis[x] + (x - i)^2) over x. The way this is calculated is that the minimal value can be found by the convex hull, so the optimal x is j (the one returned by find(2*i)), so then substituting x = j into the equation gives dis[j] + (j - i)^2. But the code's f[i] is dis[j] + (i-j)*(i-j), which is the same as (j -i)^2, so that's correct. \n\nSo the DP function is trying to calculate f[i], which represents the minimal time when taking an additional flight from some city x to city i. \n\nNow, looking back to the main function, the loop runs for each step from 1 to k. For each step, it does:\n\ndp(); // which computes f[i] as the possible new distances using an extra flight\nthen, for each j, if f[j] is better than current dis[j], it updates dis[j], and pushes to the priority queue. Then runs dij() again.\n\nWait, but after updating the distances, the Dijkstra is run again. So the process is:\n\nAfter each flight step (each iteration of the k loop in main), you compute the possible new paths by considering taking one more flight (so the total flights becomes current i). Then, for each city, the new distance is the minimum between the current dis (with previous steps) and the f[i] (the new option adding one flight). \n\nWait but the way the code is structured, the dp function is called once per flight step, and each call to dp probably considers transferring via flights to get new distances. \n\nPutting all together, the code may be correct except for the missing parts. \n\nNow, the missing code in the dij function:\n\nIn the loop over the edges:\n\nfor(int i=lst[x];i;i=nxt[i]){\n    y = to[i]\n    if (dis[y] > dis[x] + va[i]) {\n        dis[y] = dis[x] + va[i]\n        q.push(mp(-dis[y], y)); // since the queue uses negative for min-heap\n    }\n}\n\nSo that's the missing code. The existing code has a comment there, and the code inside that if statement is missing. So the code to be filled in there is:\n\ndis[y] = dis[x] + va[i];\nq.push(mp(-dis[y], y));\n\nWait but need to check if the node hasn't been visited yet before pushing. Because in Dijkstra's algorithm, once a node is popped from the queue, it's marked as visited (vi[x] is set to 1), so pushing it again won't affect the result. So the code can just push it every time, even if it's already in the queue with a higher distance. \n\nBut the code is as the user has. \n\nWait the code's 'dij()' function:\n\nThe code starts with 'while (!q.empty())' etc. The 'vi' array is used to mark visited nodes. So, when a node is popped from the queue, it's marked as visited and processed. So pushing to the queue even if it's already in the queue is okay, since the first time it's popped, it's processed (since then, any subsequent paths to it would have longer distances). \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the if statement is those two lines. \n\nSo the first part of the problem is to fill in those two lines. \n\nNow, the second part: are there any other missing parts? Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the code for the DP function. Let me see if the code is correct there. The 'dp()' function's first loop is for i from 1 to n, but in the code's loop, the variable i is the loop variable. So in the 'for (int i=1; i<=n; i+=1)' loop, for each city i, they are adding a new line (represented by that city) into the convex hull. The lines are ordered such that their slopes are increasing. \n\nWait, the lines are added in order of increasing i (since the loop is from 1 to n), so the convex hull is built in a way that the cities are processed in order of increasing index. That might be okay, but perhaps the lines need to be processed in some order based on their slope. However, in convex hull trick, the order in which lines are added can affect how the convex hull is built. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct here. The code's convex hull construction may depend on the order of i. However, since the code is given here, and the problem's constraints are such that the code is supposed to work, perhaps this part is okay. \n\nAnother part of the code is the 'find' function. Let me check that. \n\nThe function 'find' is given x (the desired slope?), and returns s[l], where the binary search is done over the convex hull array s. The condition is slope(s[mid], s[mid+1]) <= x. \n\nThe binary search loops until l < r, and the condition is adjusted. \n\nThe slope between s[mid] and s[mid+1] must be <= x. So, when that's true, we move l to mid +1, else move r to mid. \n\nThe purpose is to find the line where the next line's slope is greater than x. The desired line is the last one where the slope up to that point is less than or equal to x. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Suppose the convex hull is built so that the lines in the s array have slopes between consecutive lines increasing. Then, the binary search would find the first line where the slope between it and next is greater than x, so the optimal line is before that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's 'find' function is correctly implemented to find the line where the optimal point is. \n\nOverall, assuming the convex hull trick part is correctly implemented, the main missing part is the Dijkstra's edge relaxation code. \n\nWait, also, in the initial setup of the dis array:\n\nIn the main function, after reading the inputs and adding edges, it sets:\n\nfor(int i=2;i<=n;i++) dis[i]=inf;\n\nWhich is correct, since city 1 is the starting point, so dis[1] remains 0. \n\nThe priority queue is initialized with (0,1), which is correct as the starting point. \n\nThe main loop runs for i from 1 to k. For each step, the DP function is called, which constructs the convex hull based on the current distances (from the previous steps). Then, f[i] (wait, no, f is an array of size 1e5?) \n\nWait, the code uses f[100005], but in the dp function, f[i] is being computed. \n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nThe 'f' array is probably holding the next step's possible distances using one more flight. \n\nWait, in the main loop:\n\nfor each iteration (from 1 to k steps):\n\n- call dp() which computes f array, where f[i] is the minimal distance to city i using one more flight than before (so for the first step, starting from 0 flights, the dp computes using 1 flight, etc.)\n\n- then, for each city, if f[j] is better than current dis[j], then update dis[j] and push to the queue. \n\nThen, after updating all dis[j], run dij() again. \n\nWait, but why run dij() again after the update? Because the roads can be used again after taking a flight. \n\nHmm, the approach is that, after adding the possible flights (using up to i flights), the DP function computes the new possible distances via flights, then the Dijkstra's algorithm is run again to propagate these new distances through the roads. This way, the next flight steps can build on the updated distances that include the roads and flights so far. \n\nThis is a common approach in such problems with limited number of certain edges (here, flights). The DP step allows considering the flights, and the Dijkstra step propagates the new distances through the roads. \n\nTherefore, the code's structure seems correct. \n\nSo the only missing part is the code in the dij function's edge loop.\n\nThus, the answer is to fill in the two lines in the 'if' block inside the edge loop:\n\ndis[y] = dis[x] + va[i];\nq.push( mp(-dis[y], y) );\n\nSo that's the missing code.\n\nWait but the code in the dij function's for loop:\n\nfor(int i=lst[x];i;i=nxt[i]){ \n\nWait here the loop variable is also named 'i' (the same as the function's parameter in 'add' function?), but in the code, inside the for loop, the code uses 'i' as the edge index. The variable 'y' is set to to[i]. \n\nWait so in the code's for loop over the edges:\n\nfor(int i=lst[x]; i; i=nxt[i]) \n\nwhere 'i' here is the edge index, and 'to[i]' gives the next node. \n\nThus, the code inside the if (dis[y] > ...) is:\n\ndis[y] = dis[x] + va[i]; // since va[i] is the weight of the current edge.\n\nThen push to the queue. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is exactly those two lines. \n\nAnother thing to check: the priority queue in dij is a max-heap, but with stored as negative distances. So when we push -dis[y], the smaller distances have higher priority. \n\nYes, because when the distance is smaller, -distance is larger, so the priority queue (which is a max-heap) will pop the smallest distance first, which is correct. \n\nHence, the code is correct except for the missing lines in the if block. \n\nSo, to answer the original question: output only the missing code. The user wants the code that fills in the TODO. So the answer is the two lines inside the if block."
