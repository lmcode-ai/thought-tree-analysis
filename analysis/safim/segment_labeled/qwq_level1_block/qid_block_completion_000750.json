So for each test case, I have to read the rating and then check these conditions in order. The output should be \"Division X\" where X is 1-4. The code provided has a loop for each test case. The TODO is inside that loop, so I need to write the code that processes each rating. First, inside the loop, I need to read the rating. So I should read a line, parse it into an integer. Like:\n\nint rating = int.Parse(ReadLine()); Then, determine which division it's in. Maybe using if-else statements. Start with the highest division first. Like:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    Write(\"Division 1\");\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    Write(\"Division 2\");\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    Write(\"Division 3\");\n} else {\n    Write(\"Division 4\");\n} Wait, let me check the conditions again. For division 2, it's between 1600 and 1899. So if the rating is 1600 or higher but less than 1900, then division 2. So the first condition checks if it's >=1900 (division1). Then the next condition is >=1600 would catch up to 1899. Then division3 is >=1400, which would cover 1400-1599. Else, division4. Yes, that logic works. So putting that together. Also, after writing, we need a new line for each case. So perhaps using WriteLine instead of Write. Because the problem says to output a single line per test case. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nint rating = int.Parse(ReadLine());\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    WriteLine(\"Division 1\");\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    WriteLine(\"Division 2\");\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    WriteLine(\"Division 3\");\n} else {\n    WriteLine(\"Division 4\");\n}\n\nThat should cover all cases. Let me test the examples given in the notes. Test case 1: -789 \u2192 division4. The code would go else, correct.\n\n1299 \u2192 same, else.\n\n1300 \u2192 else.\n\n1399 \u2192 else \u2192 division4. Correct.\n\n1400: the third condition (1400 >=1400 \u2192 yes \u2192 division3. Correct.\n\n1679: between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 division2. Correct.\n\n2300 \u2192 division1. All good.",
