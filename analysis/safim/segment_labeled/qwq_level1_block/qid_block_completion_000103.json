The convex hull trick is usually used for optimization DP where the DP recurrence can be expressed as a linear function and the minimum or maximum is found over a set of lines.\n\nHmm, in the code's loop that runs K times, they first build a convex hull of some lines. The variables in the code's struct node are x and y. Let's see:\n\nIn the loop for K times:\n\n- They set tp=1 and st[1] = (1,1). Not sure why that is. Then, for each i from 2 to n:\n\nThe node v is {i, dp[i] + i*i}. Then they check some condition and adjust the st array, which is the convex hull.\n\nThen, in the second loop for each i from 1 to n, they compute a v = {1, i*2}, then find the best line in the convex hull (st) that gives the minimal value. The final dp[i] is updated with that value plus i^2, which comes from the flight time (since flight from some city j would be (i-j)^2, but maybe there's some rearrangement here).\n\nWait, the flight between any two cities u and v takes (u - v)^2. So if you take a flight from city j to city i, the time added is (i-j)^2. To model this in the DP, when considering adding a flight to the path, for each city i, the new distance would be the minimum over all j of (current distance to j with k-1 flights + (i-j)^2). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, the DP can be represented as a linear function. Let's think of dp[i][f] as the minimal time to reach city i with exactly f flights. Then, when we want to compute dp[i][f], it's the minimum over all j of (dp[j][f-1] + (i-j)^2). \n\nThis expression can be rewritten as (i\u00b2 - 2ij + j\u00b2) + dp[j][f-1]. So, grouping terms by j, this becomes ( -2i * j ) + (j\u00b2 + dp[j][f-1]) + i\u00b2. \n\nSo, for each j, this is a linear function in terms of i: m_j * i + b_j, where m_j is -2j, and b_j is j\u00b2 + dp[j][f-1]. The minimal value over all j for a given i would be the minimum of these lines evaluated at i. \n\nThe convex hull trick is used here to maintain these lines and query the minimal value efficiently. \n\nIn the code, the DP array might be tracking the current best for a certain flight count. The loop that runs K times is probably each time considering adding one flight. So for each flight step, we compute the new DP by considering the minimal over all j's of the previous DP plus the flight cost.\n\nThe code's variables in the convex hull part:\n\n- The node v for each city j (assuming i is the city index here?) is stored as {x = j, y = dp[j] + j*j}? Because then, the line for j is y = (j\u00b2 + dp[j]) + (-2j)*i + i\u00b2. Wait, because when you subtract the terms:\n\nWait, the flight cost is (i-j)^2 = i\u00b2 - 2ij + j\u00b2. So the expression dp[j][f-1] + (i-j)^2 becomes dp[j][f-1] + j\u00b2 - 2ij + i\u00b2 = (dp[j][f-1] + j\u00b2) + (i\u00b2 - 2ij). \n\nThe term (i\u00b2 - 2ij) can be written as ( -2j ) * i + i\u00b2. So the entire expression can be written as ( -2j * i ) + ( dp[j][f-1] + j\u00b2 ) + i\u00b2. So when looking for the minimal over j, the minimal of ( -2j *i + ( dp[j][f-1] + j\u00b2 )) plus i squared. Since the i squared is the same for all j, the minimal comes from the part ( -2j *i + ( dp[j][f-1] + j\u00b2 ) ), so finding the minimal of that over j for each i adds the i squared at the end.\n\nHence, each line is of the form ( -2j ) * x + ( dp[j][f-1] + j\u00b2 ), where x is the current city i. \n\nThus, for each j, we can represent it as a line with slope m=-2j and intercept b = dp[j][f-1] + j\u00b2. \n\nThe convex hull trick maintains these lines and allows querying the minimal value at a given x (which here is the current i). \n\nIn the code's K loop:\n\n- The st array is the convex hull. The loop for i from 2 to n is adding each city's line (as a node {j, dp[j] + j*j} ? Wait, the node's x is i (the city j?), and the y is dp[j] + j\u00b2. \n\nWait in the first part:\n\nfor(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n    node v = {i, dp[i] + 1ll * i * i};\n    // ... adding to the convex hull\n}\n\nSo here, for each city j (since i is iterating cities?), the line's slope is -2j (since x is i = j?), the intercept is (dp[j] + j\u00b2). So each city contributes a line. \n\nThe convex hull is built by adding these lines and maintaining the lower hull (since we want the minimal value). \n\nThen, when querying for a particular i (current city), the node v is {1, 2*i} \u2014 wait, maybe that's the x-coordinate being i? Wait the code says:\n\nfor (each i from 1 to n) {\n    node v = {1, i * 2}; \n    // ... then find the line in the convex hull where the optimal point is found\n}\n\nWait, the x-coordinate is the parameter here. Let me see. The lines are functions of x (the city we are going to), so for each i (the destination city), we need to query the minimal value at x = i. \n\nWait, the node v here is (1, 2*i), but perhaps in the code the 'x' component of the node represents the variable x, so when calculating the cross product for the query. \n\nWait the code uses a structure like \"node\" which has x and y, and the cross product between (v - a) and (b - a) would indicate the relative position. So in the query step, the point where the optimal occurs is found by moving the pointer p, which is the index of the line in the convex hull that gives the minimal value at x = i. \n\nThe calculation for dp[i] is then taking the line's value at x = i, which is m * x + b, but since the line's equation is m * x + b, where m is -2j and b is (dp[j] + j\u00b2), so the value is (-2j)*i + (dp[j] + j\u00b2). Adding the i\u00b2, the total is that plus i\u00b2, which equals dp[j] + (i-j)^2. \n\nTherefore, the code's line:\n\ndp[i] = std::min(dp[i], 1ll * i * i + st[p].y - 2ll * i * st[p].x);\n\nWait, let's see: st[p] is the line's (x, y) where x is j (the city that contributed the line), and y is (dp[j] + j\u00b2). \n\nSo substituting, the line's value at x =i is m * i + b, where m is -2j (since x is j?), so m = -2 * st[p].x. \n\nWait the line's equation is m*x (where x is the destination city's i) plus b. Wait the slope m is -2j (since j is the starting city), so m is -2*(st[p].x). \n\nThe intercept b is (dp[j] + j^2) = st[p].y. \n\nSo the value is (-2 * st[p].x)*i + st[p].y. \n\nAdding the i\u00b2 gives: \n\ni\u00b2 + (-2i * st[p].x + st[p].y) \n\nWhich is exactly the expression in the code's line: \n\n1ll*i*i + (st[p].y - 2ll*i * st[p].x)\n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the convex hull is being built for all the lines from the previous step (with f-1 flights), and then each city's DP[i] is updated with the minimal possible value when taking one more flight. \n\nWait, but how does the K loop work? The loop runs K times, each time considering adding one flight. So each iteration adds one flight. \n\nNow, the problem requires that the total number of flights doesn't exceed k. So the initial DP after the first dij() is the minimal time using roads only (0 flights). Then each loop iteration adds one flight. \n\nWait, but what's the order here? The code first runs dij() after initialization, which probably processes the roads. Then, for each K step (starting with K and decrementing), it builds the convex hull and updates the DP. But after that, it runs dij() again. \n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. Also, in the code's dij function, the missing part inside the edges loop:\n\nInside the for loop over e[u].size():\n\nfor each edge, check if dp[v] can be updated by going through u's path plus the edge's weight. So the standard Dijkstra relaxation step. So the missing code should be:\n\ndp[v] = min(dp[v], dp[u] + w);\nq.push( {v, dp[v]} );\n\nBut wait, the priority queue in the dij function is initialized by pushing all nodes at the start. That's not standard. Wait normally, you push the starting node first. But here, they push all nodes into the priority queue with their initial distances. That might be a problem because the distances are not all finalized yet, but perhaps due to the way the DP is structured.\n\nWait the D structure has a 'num' and 'dis'. The priority queue is a min-heap, so the smallest distance comes first. \n\nThe dij function initializes the queue with all nodes, but their initial distances are set to infinity except for dp[1]=0. \n\nThen, when processing a node u with current dis equal to dp[u], we look at its edges and relax the edges. So this is a standard Dijkstra, except that all nodes are initially pushed into the queue. But pushing all nodes at once may be inefficient but since the code uses a priority queue, and once a node's distance is finalized (i.e., popped from the queue), subsequent entries with larger distances are ignored. \n\nSo that part is okay. \n\nNow, in the code, the missing part is inside the edge loop in the dij function:\n\nThe code says:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < e[u].size(); i++) {\n    int v = e[u][i].to;\n    int w = e[u][i].w;\n    if(dp[v] > dp[u] + w) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nThe correct code here should update dp[v] and push the new D into the priority queue. So the code should be:\n\ndp[v] = dp[u] + w;\nq.push( {v, dp[v]} );\n\nYes. That's the standard Dijkstra relaxation step. \n\nSo that's the first part to fill in. \n\nNow, the rest of the code's logic needs to be correct. Let me check the other parts again to ensure that I haven't missed anything. \n\nThe main function after initializing runs dij() which computes the minimal road distances (without any flights). Then, for each flight allowed (K times), it does the convex hull trick to compute the minimal distance when adding one more flight, then runs dij again to update the road paths with the new distances including the flight.\n\nWait, the K loop: The code starts with K, and runs while(K--). Suppose K is the maximum allowed flights. Each iteration of the loop adds one flight. So the first iteration allows 1 flight, then 2, etc., up to k flights. \n\nEach time, after computing the possible paths using f flights (where f starts at 1, then increases to K), the code runs dij again. This is because after adding a flight path, you can again use roads to extend those paths further. \n\nSo the algorithm is combining the flight-based jumps (using convex hull trick for the flight part) and then using Dijkstra to propagate those new distances through the road network. \n\nThis is a standard approach in problems where flights/teleports can be used a limited number of times, and you alternate between propagating the existing shortest paths via roads (Dijkstra) and then considering the flights (which can be considered as edges with certain costs and a limited count). \n\nSo the code seems to follow that structure. The only missing part is the Dijkstra's edge relaxation step. \n\nTherefore, the missing code inside the if statement is:\n\ndp[v] = dp[u] + w;\nq.push( D{v, dp[v]} );\n\nBecause the D struct has 'num' and 'dis', so when creating the D object, it should be D{v, dp[v]}.\n\nWait the struct D has:\n\nstruct D {\n    int num;\n    ll dis;\n    ... \n};\n\nSo the constructor takes a num (int) and dis (ll). So when pushing to the queue:\n\nq.push( D{v, dp[v]} );\n\nAlternatively, since the queue holds D objects, you can also do:\n\nq.push( {v, dp[v]} );\n\nBecause the compiler can deduce the type.\n\nSo the correct code for the missing part is those two lines.\n\nNow, are there any other missing parts?\n\nLooking back at the code given, the user instruction says that the code has missing lines or blocks to fill. The only missing part is inside the if condition in the dij function. \n\nTherefore, I think that's the only missing code."
