Yes, that logic works. Because once it's not in the first, then check next.

The problem says division2 is up to 1899. So if x is 1900, it's division1, so the first condition catches that. The else if (x >=1600) would include 1600-1899, which is correct. Similarly, division3's lower bound is 1400, so the else if (x >=1400) would cover 1400-1599, since if it was 1600 or more, it would have been caught in division2's condition. And the else is for anything below 1400, which is division4. That seems right. So putting that into code. Also, the output must be exactly \"Division X\" where X is 1-4. The printf statements should have the correct strings. So the missing code inside the while loop is:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &x);\nthen the if-else structure.
