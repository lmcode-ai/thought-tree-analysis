Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to set each b_i to the minimal possible value that is greater than b_{i-1}, given the constraints. Wait, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's constraints. Let me think of the problem in terms of the required b_i. Suppose we have already determined the value of b_{i-1}. Then, for b_i, we need to choose a value such that b_i > b_{i-1}, and b_i must be a multiple of a_i. The minimal |k_i| (the number of moves) would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. But since k_i can be positive or negative, perhaps the minimal |k_i| is achieved by choosing the smallest integer k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. Wait, but k_i can be positive or negative. Let me think. Suppose b_{i-1} is some value. Then, the minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the ceiling of (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i (if a_i is positive, which it is) and the floor of (b_{i-1} -1)/a_i (but that might be negative). Wait, perhaps the minimal is achieved by the smallest k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. Wait, the minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the smallest k_i where a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}, and the largest k_i where a_i *k_i is just below that. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. Wait, but k_i can be any integer. Let me think of the minimal |k_i|. Suppose that the required value is that a_i *k_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. The minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the ceiling of (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i and the floor of (b_{i-1} -1)/a_i (but that would be negative, so maybe not). Wait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i. Wait, let me think numerically. Suppose b_{i-1} is 5, and a_i is 3. Then, the minimal k_i such that 3*k_i >5 is 2 (since 3*2=6>5). The absolute value is 2. Alternatively, if k_i is negative, like -1, then 3*(-1) =-3 which is less than 5, so that's not allowed. So the minimal is 2. Another example: if b_{i-1} is 4, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (3*2=6>4). Another case: if b_{i-1} is 3, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (3*2=6>3). Wait, but if b_{i-1} is 2, a_i is 3, then k_i can be 1 (3*1=3>2). So that's better. So the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). Wait, let's see: \n\nFor b_{i-1}=5, a_i=3: (5+1)/3 = 2, so ceil(2) is 2. For b_{i-1}=4, (4+1)/3 = 1.666..., ceil is 2. For b_{i-1}=3, (3+1)/3 = 1.333..., ceil is 2. Wait, but in the case where b_{i-1}=2, (2+1)/3 =1, so ceil is 1. Yes, that works. So the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). Wait, but k_i can be any integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i. So the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i. Which is exactly ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i )? Wait, let me see. Let me compute (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i. Wait, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i > (b_{i-1})/a_i. So k_i must be at least floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. Yes. So the minimal k_i is floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. Wait, let's see with the examples. Case 1: b_{i-1}=5, a_i=3. (5)/3 = 1.666..., floor is 1. So 1+1=2. Correct. Case 2: b_{i-1}=4, a_i=3: 4/3 is 1.333, floor 1 \u2192 2. \n\nCase 3: b_{i-1}=3, a_i=3 \u2192 1 \u2192 2. Case 4: b_{i-1}=2, a_i=3 \u2192 0.666 \u2192 floor 0 \u2192 1. Yes, that works. So the minimal k_i is floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. But then, the value of b_i is a_i *k_i. The number of moves for this k_i is |k_i|. Wait, but k_i can be negative? Wait, no. Because if b_{i-1} is negative, then maybe a_i *k_i can be smaller in absolute terms.",

Suppose b_{i-1} is -5, and a_i is 3. Then, the required b_i must be greater than -5. The minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing k_i =0, since 0*3=0 >-5. So that's better than k_i=1 (3) or -1 (-3). So in this case, the minimal k_i is 0, which gives |0|=0 moves.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i from b_i. Since initially all b_i are zero, we can think of each b_i as some multiple of a_i, but since each move is adding or subtracting a_i once, the number of moves for b_i is the absolute value of the number of times we add or subtract. Wait, actually, each move is either adding or subtracting a_i once. So for each b_i, the total moves are the absolute value of (current value of b_i divided by a_i), but since each step is adding or subtracting a_i, the number of moves is exactly |(b_i)/a_i|. Wait, no, because each move is adding or subtracting a_i once. So for example, if you add a_i once, that's one move, subtract twice, that's two moves. So the total moves for b_i is the absolute value of the number of times you added or subtracted. So the total moves for b_i is |(b_i) / a_i|, but only if b_i is a multiple of a_i. Wait, actually, since each move changes b_i by \u00b1a_i, the value of b_i must be a multiple of a_i. So the number of moves for b_i is exactly |b_i / a_i|. \n\nThe problem is to choose these b_i such that the sequence is strictly increasing, and the sum of |b_i / a_i| is minimized. \n\nHmm, the approach here is probably dynamic programming. Let me think about the code given. The code loops over each i, and for each i, calculates some mini and then compares to rmin. The inner loops for j and k might be part of the DP approach. \n\nLooking at the code structure, the outer loop is for i from 0 to n-1. Then, inside, there's a loop for j from i-1 down to 0. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\". Then, there's a loop for k from i+1 to n-1, where they compute x as maxk divided by v[k] plus 1, add x to mini, and set maxk to v[k] * x. \n\nWait, the code's current structure might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem requires that each b_i must be strictly greater than all previous elements. So for each position i, the value of b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}, and so on. \n\nThe approach in the code seems to be trying to compute for each possible starting point i, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute for each position i, the minimal moves required given some constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by working backwards. Let me think of the DP approach. Let's consider that for each position i, we can track the minimal moves required up to i, given that b_i is set to some value. But since the values can be very large, this might not be feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by ensuring that each b_i is at least b_{i-1} + 1. Since the array must be strictly increasing, each term must be at least previous +1. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of constraints. Let's denote the desired b array as b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. The constraints are:\n\nb_1 can be anything (since there's nothing before it), but for each i >=2, b_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nThe goal is to choose each b_i such that it's a multiple of a_i (since each move adds or subtracts a_i, so b_i must be k_i * a_i where k_i is an integer, possibly negative). Wait, no, actually, each move adds or subtracts a_i once. So the total number of moves for b_i is |k_i|, where b_i = k_i * a_i. So the value of b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, no. Wait, each move for b_i is adding or subtracting a_i once. So after m moves, the total change is m * a_i (if all moves are adding) or -m * a_i (if all subtracting), but actually, the total can be any multiple of a_i. So the value of b_i must be equal to (some integer) * a_i. Because each move contributes \u00b1a_i. So yes, b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nk_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1} for all i >=2,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nSo the problem is to find such a sequence of k_i's with minimal sum of absolute values, under the constraints that a_i *k_i > a_{i-1}*k_{i-1} for each i from 2 to n. \n\nHmm, how can we model this? \n\nPerhaps dynamic programming is the way to go. Let's think of DP[i][k] as the minimal total moves up to the i-th element, given that the i-th element is set to k * a_i. But since a_i can be up to 1e9, this is not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the DP state as the minimal moves up to i, given the value of b_i. But again, the possible values are too large. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the DP in terms of the required constraints. Let me think of the constraints step by step. \n\nSuppose we process the elements from left to right. For each position i, the value of b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nLet me think of the minimal moves required up to i, given that b_i is set to some value. \n\nWait, perhaps we can model the DP as follows: \n\nLet dp[i] be the minimal total moves up to the i-th element, along with the minimal possible value of b_i given that the previous constraints are satisfied. \n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each i, we can track the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints, and the minimal moves required to reach that. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by greedy approaches. Let's start from the first element and adjust each subsequent element to be as small as possible while satisfying the constraints. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach. Let's process the array from left to right. For each position i, we need to choose k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}, and we want to minimize the total |k_i|. \n\nBut how do we choose k_i optimally? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the constraints in terms of the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nSuppose we have already determined the value of b_{i-1}. Then, for b_i, we need to choose k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. The minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i (in absolute terms) that satisfies this inequality. \n\nBut since the previous b_{i-1} depends on the choices made up to i-1, this seems like a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current value of b_{i}, but since that can be large, we need a way to represent it efficiently. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to track the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints, and the minimal moves required to reach that. \n\nAlternatively, here's another idea. Let's model the problem by ensuring that each b_i is as small as possible while still satisfying the constraints. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal moves can be found by greedily adjusting each term to the minimal possible value that satisfies the constraints. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nStart with b_1. Since there are no constraints except that it must be less than b_2, but since we can choose any k_1, perhaps the minimal moves for the first element is zero (since it can be zero, but then the next element must be greater than zero). \n\nWait, but the first element can be anything. Let me think of the first element. Since there's no prior elements, the only constraint is that the next element must be greater than it. \n\nSo for the first element, the best is to set it as low as possible so that the next elements can be as small as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to set each b_i to the minimal possible value that is greater than b_{i-1}, given the constraints. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's constraints. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required b_i. \n\nSuppose we have already determined the value of b_{i-1}. Then, for b_i, we need to choose a value such that b_i > b_{i-1}, and b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| (the number of moves) would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nBut since k_i can be positive or negative, perhaps the minimal |k_i| is achieved by choosing the smallest integer k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but k_i can be positive or negative. Let me think. \n\nSuppose b_{i-1} is some value. Then, the minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the ceiling of (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i (if a_i is positive, which it is) and the floor of (b_{i-1} -1)/a_i (but that might be negative). Wait, perhaps the minimal is achieved by the smallest k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, the minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the smallest k_i where a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}, and the largest k_i where a_i *k_i is just below that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but k_i can be any integer. Let me think of the minimal |k_i|. \n\nSuppose that the required value is that a_i *k_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the ceiling of (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i and the floor of (b_{i-1} -1)/a_i (but that would be negative, so maybe not). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i. \n\nWait, let me think numerically. Suppose b_{i-1} is 5, and a_i is 3. Then, the minimal k_i such that 3*k_i >5 is 2 (since 3*2=6>5). The absolute value is 2. Alternatively, if k_i is negative, like -1, then 3*(-1) =-3 which is less than 5, so that's not allowed. So the minimal is 2. \n\nAnother example: if b_{i-1} is 4, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (3*2=6>4). \n\nAnother case: if b_{i-1} is 3, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (3*2=6>3). \n\nWait, but if b_{i-1} is 2, a_i is 3, then k_i can be 1 (3*1=3>2). So that's better. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFor b_{i-1}=5, a_i=3: (5+1)/3 = 2, so ceil(2) is 2. \n\nFor b_{i-1}=4, (4+1)/3 = 1.666..., ceil is 2. \n\nFor b_{i-1}=3, (3+1)/3 = 1.333..., ceil is 2. \n\nWait, but in the case where b_{i-1}=2, (2+1)/3 =1, so ceil is 1. \n\nYes, that works. So the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, but k_i can be any integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i. So the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1})/a_i. \n\nWhich is exactly ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i )? \n\nWait, let me see. Let me compute (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i. \n\nWait, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i > (b_{i-1})/a_i. \n\nSo k_i must be at least floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. \n\nYes. So the minimal k_i is floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. \n\nWait, let's see with the examples. \n\nCase 1: b_{i-1}=5, a_i=3. \n\n(5)/3 = 1.666..., floor is 1. So 1+1=2. Correct. \n\nCase 2: b_{i-1}=4, a_i=3: 4/3 is 1.333, floor 1 \u2192 2. \n\nCase 3: b_{i-1}=3, a_i=3 \u2192 1 \u2192 2. \n\nCase 4: b_{i-1}=2, a_i=3 \u2192 0.666 \u2192 floor 0 \u2192 1. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is floor( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1. \n\nBut then, the value of b_i is a_i *k_i. \n\nThe number of moves for this k_i is |k_i|. \n\nWait, but k_i can be negative? \n\nWait, no. Because if b_{i-1} is negative, then maybe a_i *k_i can be smaller in absolute terms. \n\nWait, this approach assumes that k_i is positive, but maybe there's a better k_i with a negative value. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nWait, let's think of another scenario. Suppose b_{i-1} is -5, and a_i is 3. \n\nThen, the required b_i must be greater than -5. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing k_i =0, since 0*3=0 >-5. \n\nSo that's better than k_i=1 (3) or -1 (-3). \n\nSo in this case, the minimal k_i is 0, which gives |0|=0 moves. \n\nSo the previous approach of taking floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) +1 would give floor(-5/3)= -2 \u2192 -2+1 =-1 \u2192 k_i=-1. \n\nWhich gives b_i =-3, which is greater than -5, but the moves would be 1. But choosing k_i=0 gives 0 moves. \n\nSo the previous approach is not correct. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that when b_{i-1} is negative, there might be a better k_i (like zero) that requires fewer moves. \n\nTherefore, the minimal k_i is not necessarily the one that just barely exceeds b_{i-1}/a_i. \n\nHmm, so this complicates the approach. \n\nAlternative idea: For each position i, given the previous b_{i-1}, the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the possible k_i that satisfy a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo the minimal |k_i| is the minimal of all possible k_i where a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nTo find this, we can compute the minimal possible k_i such that a_i *k_i > b_{i-1}, and then choose the k_i with the smallest absolute value. \n\nLet me think of how to compute this. \n\nLet me denote the required condition as a_i *k_i > prev_b. \n\nWe can solve for k_i: \n\nk_i > prev_b / a_i \n\nSince a_i is positive (given in the input as a positive integer), so the inequality is straightforward. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the smallest integer greater than prev_b/a_i, and the largest integer less than or equal to prev_b/a_i, but such that a_i *k_i is still greater than prev_b. Wait, but the largest integer less than prev_b/a_i would give a_i *k_i <= prev_b, so that's not allowed. \n\nWait, so the minimal k_i must be the smallest integer greater than prev_b/a_i. \n\nWait, but in the previous example where prev_b is -5 and a_i is 3, then prev_b/a_i is -5/3 \u2248-1.666. \n\nThe smallest integer greater than that is -1. \n\nBut then k_i =-1 gives a_i *k_i =-3, which is greater than -5. \n\nBut the minimal |k_i| is 0, which is better. \n\nAh, so the problem is that there exists a k_i (0) which is smaller than the minimal k_i (in terms of the inequality) but still satisfies the condition. \n\nWait, because 0 is greater than -1.666. \n\nWait, 0 is greater than prev_b/a_i (which is -1.666). \n\nSo 0 is a valid k_i. \n\nSo the minimal k_i can be any integer greater than prev_b/a_i. \n\nTherefore, the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between all integers k_i where k_i > (prev_b)/a_i. \n\nSo the minimal |k_i| is the minimal of all possible k_i in that set. \n\nTo find the minimal |k_i|, we can consider the integer closest to (prev_b)/a_i but still satisfying the inequality. \n\nLet me think of the possible candidates. \n\nLet me denote x = prev_b / a_i. \n\nWe need k_i > x. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the ceiling of x (the smallest integer greater than x) and the floor of x (if floor(x) is greater than x, but that can't be). Wait, floor(x) is the largest integer less than or equal to x. So floor(x) is <=x. \n\nWait, so the minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nWait, but in the example where x is -1.666, the minimal k_i is -1 (since that's the smallest integer greater than x). \n\nBut in that case, the minimal |k_i| is 0, which is better. \n\nAh, so the minimal |k_i| can be found by considering all integers greater than x, and choosing the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the ceiling of x and the floor of x +1, but perhaps there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the ceiling of x and the floor of x +1, but perhaps even lower. \n\nWait, let me think of the example where x is -1.666. \n\nPossible k_i can be -1, 0, 1, etc. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is 0 (since 0 is allowed). \n\nSo the minimal is 0. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0, which is better than -1 (abs 1 vs 0). \n\nSo the minimal is achieved at k_i=0. \n\nSo how do we find that? \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is the minimal between all integers k where k > x. \n\nSo the minimal is the integer closest to zero that is greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the ceiling of x and the floor of x +1, but perhaps even lower. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal is the integer closest to zero that is greater than x. \n\nSo, for example, if x is -1.666, then the integers greater than x are -1, 0, 1, etc. The one with the smallest absolute value is 0. \n\nAnother example: x = 2.3. Then the minimal k_i is 3 (since 2.3 <3, and 2 is not allowed). The absolute value is 3. \n\nAnother example: x = 1.2. The minimal k_i is 2 (abs 2), but maybe 1.2 is less than 2, but 1 is not allowed. \n\nWait, no, 1.2 is the value of x. So k_i must be >1.2 \u2192 minimal is 2. \n\nAnother example: x = -0.5. Then the minimal k_i is 0 (since 0 is greater than -0.5, and |0| is better than 1). \n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0. \n\nHmm, so the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the ceiling of x and the floor of x +1, but also considering zero if possible. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo how can we compute this? \n\nLet me think of the formula. \n\nLet me denote x = prev_b / a_i. \n\nWe need to find the minimal |k| where k is an integer and k > x. \n\nThe minimal |k| is the minimal between the ceiling of x and the floor of x +1, but perhaps even better. \n\nWait, the minimal |k| is the minimal between the ceiling of x and the floor of x +1, but also any integer between them. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal is the integer closest to zero that is greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal is the integer closest to zero that is greater than x. \n\nSo, the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo, the minimal k can be found by considering the integer part of x. \n\nLet me think of x as a real number. \n\nCase 1: x is negative. \n\nSuppose x is -1.666. \n\nThe minimal k is 0 (since 0 is greater than x and has smaller absolute value than -1). \n\nCase 2: x is between 0 and 1. \n\nSay x =0.5. \n\nThe minimal k is 1 (since 0 is not allowed, as 0.5 <1 \u2192 k must be >0.5 \u2192 minimal is 1). \n\nCase 3: x is between 1 and 2. \n\nx=1.2 \u2192 minimal k is 2? No, wait, 1.2 <2 \u2192 but 1 is not allowed. So minimal is 2. \n\nWait, but 1.2 <2 \u2192 but 1 is less than x (1.2). So the minimal is 2. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k is ceil(x). \n\nWait, but in the first case where x is -1.666, ceil(x) is -1. \n\nBut the minimal k is 0, which is better. \n\nAh, so the problem is that ceil(x) gives the smallest integer greater than x, but there might be a smaller absolute value integer that is also greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal |k| is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closer to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo, the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nSo, the minimal k can be found by considering the following candidates: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than x (ceil(x)), \n\n- The integer 0, if it is greater than x, \n\n- The integer 1, if it is greater than x, \n\n- etc. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal is the minimal between ceil(x) and the floor(x) +1, but that's the same as ceil(x). \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closest to zero. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal |k| is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closest to zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal is the minimal between ceil(x) and the first integer greater than x that is closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal is the
