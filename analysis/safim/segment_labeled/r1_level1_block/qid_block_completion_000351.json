So each of the s rows must sum to exactly s, and the sum of all the blocks' lengths (each is ceil(i/2)) must be at least s * s (since each row contributes s length). Wait, but maybe the sum of all the blocks' lengths must be >= s^2. Because each row contributes some sum to the total, and you need s rows each of sum s, so total sum s^2. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of all the blocks' lengths (ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n) is >= s^2. Therefore, the maximum possible s is the largest integer where the sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n is >= s^2. So first, we need to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Then find the largest s where this sum is >= s^2. Now, let's compute the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for S(n). Let's split into even and odd cases. If i is even: ceil(i/2) = i/2. If i is odd: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. Let's compute for n even and n odd. Case 1: n is even, say n=2k. Then the sum can be split into pairs. For i=1 and 2: ceil(1/2) is 1, ceil(2/2) is 1. Sum is 2. For i=3 and 4: ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2. Sum is 4. So for each pair (2m-1, 2m), the sum is m + m = 2m. Wait, for i=2m-1 and i=2m: ceil((2m-1)/2) = m, ceil(2m/2) = m. So sum is 2m per pair. Since n is even, there are k pairs. So sum S(n) = 2*(1 + 2 + ... +k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). Since n=2k, k = n/2. So S(n) = (n/2)(n/2 +1) = (n/2)( (n+2)/2 ) = (n(n+2))/4. Case 2: n is odd, n=2k+1. Then the sum for the first 2k terms is k*(k+1), as in the even case. Then add the (2k+1)-th term: ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So total sum S(n) = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k = (n-1)/2. So S(n) = ((n-1)/2 +1)^2 = ((n+1)/2)^2. So putting it all together:\n\nif n is even: S(n ) = (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4\nif n is odd: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s^2 <= S(n). So for even n:\n\ns^2 <= (n^2 + 2n)/4. We need to find the maximum integer s such that s^2 <= (n^2 +2n)/4. Similarly, for odd n:\n\ns^2 <= ((n+1)/2)^2. Wait, when n is odd, S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2, which is (k+1)^2 where k = (n-1)/2. So S(n) is a perfect square. Therefore, s = (n+1)/2. Wait, but (n+1)/2 is (2k+2)/2 = k+1. So yes. So for n odd, the sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1, which is (n+1)/2. But wait, let's test with the sample input. Sample Input 2: n=5. n=5 is odd. So S(5) = ((5+1)/2)^2 = (3)^2=9. So s^2 is 9, so s=3. Which matches the sample output. Sample Input 1: n=1. For n=1, which is odd, S(1) = (1+1)/2)^2 = 1. So s=1, which matches the sample. Another sample: n=4 (even). S(4) = (4*6)/4 = 6. So maximum s is floor(sqrt(6))=2, but wait let's compute:\n\nsqrt(6) is approx 2.449, so floor is 2. But wait in the code given, when n is even, the code outputs n/2.

      "text": "Wait, but maybe for even n, the maximum s is floor( sqrt( (n(n+2))/4 ) ). But the code currently outputs n/2 when n is even. So in the code, when n is even, the output is n/2. Let's see if that's correct. Take n=2 (even). S(2) = (2*4)/4=2. So s^2 must be <=2. The maximum s is 1. Which is 2/2=1. Correct. n=4: S(4)= (4*6)/4=6. s^2 <=6 \u2192 s=2 (2^2=4 \u22646, 3^2=9>6). So output is 2, which is 4/2=2. Correct. n=6: S(6)= (6*8)/4=12. s^2 <=12 \u2192 s=3 (3^2=9, 4^2=16>12). 6/2=3. Correct. So for even n, outputting n/2 gives the correct answer. So why is that? Let's see:\n\nWe have S(n) for even n is (n/2)(n/2 +1). So s must be the maximum integer s where s\u00b2 <= (n/2)(n/2 +1). But when n is even, let's let k = n/2. So S(n) = k*(k+1). We need to find s such that s\u00b2 <=k(k+1). What's the maximum s here? Let's compute k(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k. So s is between k and k+1. Because k\u00b2 <k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2 +2k+1 = (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k, because k\u00b2 +k is less than (k+1)^2. Wait, wait:\n\nk\u00b2 +k = k(k+1) = s\u00b2 \u2192 s must be the integer part of sqrt(k(k+1)). But sqrt(k(k+1)) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). Let's see for example, when k=3 (n=6):\n\nsqrt(3*4) = sqrt(12) \u22483.464 \u2192 s=3. Which is equal to k. So in this case, the maximum s is k, which is n/2. So for even n, the maximum s is floor( sqrt( k(k+1) ) ) where k =n/2. But since k and k+1 are consecutive integers, their product is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is less than k+1. So floor(sqrt(k(k+1))) is k. So s =k =n/2. Wait, but why? Let's see for k=2 (n=4):\n\nk(k+1)=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449. Floor is 2. Which is k=2. So yes. So for even n, the maximum s is indeed k =n/2. So the code for even n is correct. Now for odd n. The code has an if(n is odd) block, and we need to fill in the code there. Let's look at the code given:\n\nThe code structure is:\n\nif (n is odd) {\n    // TODO: code here\n} else {\n    output n/2;\n}\n\nSo for odd n, we need to compute s. Let's see: For n odd, S(n) is ((n+1)/2)^2. So s is (n+1)/2. Because s\u00b2 = ((n+1)/2)^2, which is exactly equal to S(n). So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. But wait, for example, n=5:\n\nS(5)= (5+1)/2=3. So s=3. Which is correct. Similarly, n=3: S(3)= (4/2)^2=4 \u2192 s=2. But wait, what if the sum S(n) is a perfect square? Then s is exactly sqrt(S(n)), which in this case is (n+1)/2. So for odd n, the maximum s is (n+1)/2. However, n is odd, so (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is an integer. Wait, for example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct. So for odd n, the code should output (n+1)/2. But wait, let's check with the sample input where n=5. The code's else clause handles even n. For n=5, which is odd, the code should output (5+1)/2=3, which matches the sample. So why in the code for even n it's outputting n/2, which is correct, and for odd n, the code needs to output (n+1)/2. Wait, but wait. Wait, let's see:\n\nWhen n is even, the code outputs n/2. Correct. When n is odd, the code needs to compute (n+1)/2. Because for example, n=5, (5+1)/2=3. So the code for odd n should output (n+1)/2. But wait, in the code, the 'if' condition is checking if n is odd. So when n is odd, the code is supposed to compute and output (n+1)/2. But wait, (n+1)/2 can be written as (n+1)/2. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. n=3: (3+1)/2=2. So for odd n, the code should output (n+1)/2. So in code:\n\nif(n % 2 !=0) { // n is odd\n    cout << (n +1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nWait, but let's test for n=3: output is 2. S(3)=4 \u2192 s=2. Correct. But wait, another example: n=7 (odd). S(7) = (7+1)/2=4 \u2192 squared is 16. Sum is 4^2=16. So yes. Output is 4. But wait, let's check when n is 1. For n=1 (odd), (1+1)/2=1. Correct. But wait, wait a minute. What if n is 7? Let's compute S(7) = sum of ceil(i/2) from i=1 to 7. i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2, i=5:3, i=6:3, i=7:4. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3+4=16. Which is 4^2. So output is 4. Which is (7+1)/2=4. Correct. But what about n=9? S(9) = ((9+1)/2)^2 =25. Let's compute sum:\n\ni=1:1, 2:1, 3:2,4:2,5:3,6:3,7:4,8:4,9:5. Sum is 1+1=2, +2+2=4 (total 6), +3+3=6 (total 12), +4+4=8 (total 20), +5=25. So yes. So output is 5. (9+1)/2=5. So the code for odd n is correct. Wait, but the code given in the problem has:\n\nif (n%2 !=0) { ... }\n\nelse { ... } So for n odd, the code needs to output (n+1)/2. But wait, (n+1)/2 can be written as (n+1)//2, which is equivalent in integer division. So for example, when n is 5: (5+1)/2=3. So code for the odd case is:\n\ncout << (n +1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n\nBut wait, what about when n is even? For example, n=6. Then (6+1)/2=3.5. But n is even, so the code uses the else clause. So no problem. So the code's missing part is to handle the case where n is odd, and output (n+1)/2. Wait, but wait. Let's look at the code again. The code is:\n\nif (n %2 !=0) {\n\n// TODO\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\ncout << n/2 << \"\\n\";\n\n} So when n is odd, the code should output (n+1)/2. But (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is an integer. So in code, for the odd case, the output is (n+1)/2. But wait, when n is 5: (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct. So the missing code for the odd case is to compute (n+1)/2 and output it. But wait, in the sample input when n=5, the code outputs 3, which is correct. Wait, but wait. Let me test n=5. But according to the code given, when n is even, output n/2. Else, compute (n+1)/2. But wait, that's the case. So the code for odd n is correct. But why in the code is the else clause handling even n, and the if clause handling odd n. So the code is correct. So the missing code is to output (n+1)/2 when n is odd. So the missing code in the if block is: cout << (n +1)/2 << \"\\n\"; But wait, let's test with n=5: Yes, code outputs (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Another test case: n=7. Output is 4. Correct. But wait, let's look at the code again. The code is written for C++. So for the case when n is odd, (n+1)/2 is integer. So in code, for example, n is 5, which is a long long. So (5+1) is 6, divided by 2 is 3. Correct. So the code for the odd case is to output (n+1)/2. So the missing code is simply that line. But wait, wait. Let me check the problem statement again. The code given is:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\ntypedef long long ll;\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main(void){\n    int t;cin>>t;\n    while(t--){\n        ll n;cin>>n;\n        if(n%2!=0){\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n        }\n        else{\n            cout<<n/2<<\"\\n\";\n        }    \n    }\n    \n} So when n is odd, the code is missing.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n wooden blocks. Each block's length is the ceiling of i/2, where i is the block's number from 1 to n. The blocks are 1 unit high. So, arranging them into a square requires that the total area of the blocks used is at least s^2 (since the square's area is s x s). But since each block's height is 1, the total area is the sum of the lengths of the blocks used. So the sum of the selected blocks' lengths must be >= s^2, and we need the maximum s possible.\n\nWait, but how do they form a square? Oh right, the blocks are 1 unit high. So the square is formed by stacking the blocks in such a way that their combined height and length form the square. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the blocks are 1 unit high. So each block is placed horizontally, contributing 1 unit to the height and length equal to ceil(i/2). So to make a square of side length s, we need the total length of the blocks in each row to be s. But how many rows? Since each block is 1 unit high, each row is 1 unit high. So the square would have s rows (since the height is s). Each row must have total length >= s. Wait, no. Wait, the square is s units in height and s units in width. So each row (which is 1 unit high) contributes to the height. So to get s height, we need s rows. Each row must have a total length of s. So each of the s rows must sum to exactly s, and the sum of all the blocks' lengths (each is ceil(i/2)) must be at least s * s (since each row contributes s length). Wait, but maybe the sum of all the blocks' lengths must be >= s^2. Because each row contributes some sum to the total, and you need s rows each of sum s, so total sum s^2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of all the blocks' lengths (ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n) is >= s^2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible s is the largest integer where the sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n is >= s^2.\n\nSo first, we need to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Then find the largest s where this sum is >= s^2.\n\nNow, let's compute the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet's find a formula for S(n). Let's split into even and odd cases.\n\nIf i is even: ceil(i/2) = i/2.\nIf i is odd: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2.\n\nLet's compute for n even and n odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even, say n=2k.\n\nThen the sum can be split into pairs. For i=1 and 2: ceil(1/2) is 1, ceil(2/2) is 1. Sum is 2. For i=3 and 4: ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2. Sum is 4. So for each pair (2m-1, 2m), the sum is m + m = 2m. Wait, for i=2m-1 and i=2m: ceil((2m-1)/2) = m, ceil(2m/2) = m. So sum is 2m per pair. Since n is even, there are k pairs. So sum S(n) = 2*(1 + 2 + ... +k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). Since n=2k, k = n/2. So S(n) = (n/2)(n/2 +1) = (n/2)( (n+2)/2 ) = (n(n+2))/4.\n\nCase 2: n is odd, n=2k+1.\n\nThen the sum for the first 2k terms is k*(k+1), as in the even case. Then add the (2k+1)-th term: ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So total sum S(n) = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k = (n-1)/2. So S(n) = ((n-1)/2 +1)^2 = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nif n is even: S(n) = (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4\nif n is odd: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s^2 <= S(n).\n\nSo for even n:\n\ns^2 <= (n^2 + 2n)/4.\n\nWe need to find the maximum integer s such that s^2 <= (n^2 +2n)/4.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n:\n\ns^2 <= ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nWait, when n is odd, S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2, which is (k+1)^2 where k = (n-1)/2. So S(n) is a perfect square. Therefore, s = (n+1)/2. Wait, but (n+1)/2 is (2k+2)/2 = k+1. So yes. So for n odd, the sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1, which is (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: n=5.\n\nn=5 is odd. So S(5) = ((5+1)/2)^2 = (3)^2=9. So s^2 is 9, so s=3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1. For n=1, which is odd, S(1) = (1+1)/2)^2 = 1. So s=1, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=4 (even). S(4) = (4*6)/4 = 6. So maximum s is floor(sqrt(6))=2, but wait let's compute:\n\nsqrt(6) is approx 2.449, so floor is 2. But wait in the code given, when n is even, the code outputs n/2. For example, if n=4, even, output is 4/2=2. Which matches this.\n\nWait, but for even n, the code as given in the problem has an else clause where it outputs n/2. But according to our formula, S(n) for even n is (n^2 +2n)/4. So s^2 must be <= this value. So s is the floor of sqrt((n\u00b2 +2n)/4).\n\nWait, but maybe for even n, the maximum s is floor( sqrt( (n(n+2))/4 ) ). But the code currently outputs n/2 when n is even. So in the code, when n is even, the output is n/2. Let's see if that's correct.\n\nTake n=2 (even). S(2) = (2*4)/4=2. So s^2 must be <=2. The maximum s is 1. Which is 2/2=1. Correct.\n\nn=4: S(4)= (4*6)/4=6. s^2 <=6 \u2192 s=2 (2^2=4 \u22646, 3^2=9>6). So output is 2, which is 4/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=6: S(6)= (6*8)/4=12. s^2 <=12 \u2192 s=3 (3^2=9, 4^2=16>12). 6/2=3. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, outputting n/2 gives the correct answer. So why is that? Let's see:\n\nWe have S(n) for even n is (n/2)(n/2 +1). So s must be the maximum integer s where s\u00b2 <= (n/2)(n/2 +1).\n\nBut when n is even, let's let k = n/2. So S(n) = k*(k+1). We need to find s such that s\u00b2 <=k(k+1). What's the maximum s here? Let's compute k(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k. So s is between k and k+1. Because k\u00b2 <k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2 +2k+1 = (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k, because k\u00b2 +k is less than (k+1)^2. Wait, wait:\n\nk\u00b2 +k = k(k+1) = s\u00b2 \u2192 s must be the integer part of sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nBut sqrt(k(k+1)) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). Let's see for example, when k=3 (n=6):\n\nsqrt(3*4) = sqrt(12) \u22483.464 \u2192 s=3.\n\nWhich is equal to k. So in this case, the maximum s is k, which is n/2. So for even n, the maximum s is floor( sqrt( k(k+1) ) ) where k =n/2. But since k and k+1 are consecutive integers, their product is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is less than k+1. So floor(sqrt(k(k+1))) is k. So s =k =n/2.\n\nWait, but why? Let's see for k=2 (n=4):\n\nk(k+1)=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449. Floor is 2. Which is k=2. So yes. So for even n, the maximum s is indeed k =n/2. So the code for even n is correct.\n\nNow for odd n. The code has an if(n is odd) block, and we need to fill in the code there. Let's look at the code given:\n\nThe code structure is:\n\nif (n is odd) {\n    // TODO: code here\n} else {\n    output n/2;\n}\n\nSo for odd n, we need to compute s. Let's see: For n odd, S(n) is ((n+1)/2)^2. So s is (n+1)/2. Because s\u00b2 = ((n+1)/2)^2, which is exactly equal to S(n). So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. But wait, for example, n=5:\n\nS(5)= (5+1)/2=3. So s=3. Which is correct. Similarly, n=3: S(3)= (4/2)^2=4 \u2192 s=2.\n\nBut wait, what if the sum S(n) is a perfect square? Then s is exactly sqrt(S(n)), which in this case is (n+1)/2. So for odd n, the maximum s is (n+1)/2. However, n is odd, so (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is an integer.\n\nWait, for example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for odd n, the code should output (n+1)/2. But wait, let's check with the sample input where n=5. The code's else clause handles even n. For n=5, which is odd, the code should output (5+1)/2=3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo why in the code for even n it's outputting n/2, which is correct, and for odd n, the code needs to output (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, let's see:\n\nWhen n is even, the code outputs n/2. Correct.\n\nWhen n is odd, the code needs to compute (n+1)/2. Because for example, n=5, (5+1)/2=3. So the code for odd n should output (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the 'if' condition is checking if n is odd. So when n is odd, the code is supposed to compute and output (n+1)/2. But wait, (n+1)/2 can be written as (n+1)/2. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. n=3: (3+1)/2=2.\n\nSo for odd n, the code should output (n+1)/2. So in code:\n\nif(n % 2 !=0) { // n is odd\n    cout << (n +1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nWait, but let's test for n=3: output is 2. S(3)=4 \u2192 s=2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, another example: n=7 (odd). S(7) = (7+1)/2=4 \u2192 squared is 16. Sum is 4^2=16. So yes. Output is 4.\n\nBut wait, let's check when n is 1. For n=1 (odd), (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. What if n is 7? Let's compute S(7) = sum of ceil(i/2) from i=1 to 7.\n\ni=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2, i=5:3, i=6:3, i=7:4.\n\nSum is 1+1+2+2+3+3+4=16. Which is 4^2. So output is 4. Which is (7+1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nBut what about n=9? S(9) = ((9+1)/2)^2 =25. Let's compute sum:\n\ni=1:1, 2:1, 3:2,4:2,5:3,6:3,7:4,8:4,9:5. Sum is 1+1=2, +2+2=4 (total 6), +3+3=6 (total 12), +4+4=8 (total 20), +5=25. So yes. So output is 5. (9+1)/2=5.\n\nSo the code for odd n is correct.\n\nWait, but the code given in the problem has:\n\nif (n%2 !=0) { ... }\n\nelse { ... }\n\nSo for n odd, the code needs to output (n+1)/2. But wait, (n+1)/2 can be written as (n+1)//2, which is equivalent in integer division. So for example, when n is 5: (5+1)/2=3. So code for the odd case is:\n\ncout << (n +1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n\nBut wait, what about when n is even? For example, n=6. Then (6+1)/2=3.5. But n is even, so the code uses the else clause. So no problem.\n\nSo the code's missing part is to handle the case where n is odd, and output (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's look at the code again. The code is:\n\nif (n %2 !=0) {\n\n// TODO\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\ncout << n/2 << \"\\n\";\n\n}\n\nSo when n is odd, the code should output (n+1)/2. But (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is an integer.\n\nSo in code, for the odd case, the output is (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, when n is 5: (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the missing code for the odd case is to compute (n+1)/2 and output it. But wait, in the sample input when n=5, the code outputs 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test n=5.\n\nBut according to the code given, when n is even, output n/2. Else, compute (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, that's the case. So the code for odd n is correct.\n\nBut why in the code is the else clause handling even n, and the if clause handling odd n. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the missing code is to output (n+1)/2 when n is odd.\n\nSo the missing code in the if block is: cout << (n +1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n\nBut wait, let's test with n=5:\n\nYes, code outputs (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7. Output is 4. Correct.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the code again. The code is written for C++. So for the case when n is odd, (n+1)/2 is integer. So in code, for example, n is 5, which is a long long. So (5+1) is 6, divided by 2 is 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code for the odd case is to output (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the missing code is simply that line.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check the problem statement again. The code given is:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\ntypedef long long ll;\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main(void){\n    int t;cin>>t;\n    while(t--){\n        ll n;cin>>n;\n        if(n%2!=0){\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n        }\n        else{\n            cout<<n/2<<\"\\n\";\n        }    \n    }\n    \n}\n\nSo when n is odd, the code is missing. The code must be written in that TODO section.\n\nSo the answer is to output (n +1)/2. But wait, but when n is even, the code outputs n/2, which is correct.\n\nSo for the code, the missing line in the if block is:\n\ncout << (n + 1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n\nBut wait, let me test with n=5 again. (5+1)/2=3, which is correct.\n\nBut what about n=1? (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3. (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code for the odd case is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is to output (n+1)/2.\n\nSo in the code's TODO section, the code should be:\n\ncout << (n + 1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n\nBut why is that the case? Because for odd n, S(n) is ((n+1)/2)^2. So s^2 = S(n), which means s is exactly (n+1)/2. So the maximum possible s is (n+1)/2.\n\nThus, the code for the odd case is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing line is to print (n +1)/2.\n\nThus, the correct code to fill in the TODO section is:\n\ncout << (n + 1)/2 << \"\\n\";"
