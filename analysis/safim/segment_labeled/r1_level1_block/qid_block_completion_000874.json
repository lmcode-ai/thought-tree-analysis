The end map counts the occurrences of the second character. The v map counts the occurrences of the entire string.\n\nIn the loop for each string, the sum is being updated. The formula is sum += start.getOrDefault(first char, 0) + end.getOrDefault(second char, 0) - 2 * v.getOrDefault(current string, 0).

Then, subtract the cases where both characters are the same except one, but wait: if there's a string that is exactly the same as s, then when considering the first and second character counts, they would contribute to both start and end counts.

So the number of strings with same first character but different second is start.get(a) - v.get(ab). Similarly, for the second character, the number of previous strings with same second character (b) but different first is end.get(b) - v.get(ab). So the total for this string is (start.get(a) - v(ab)) + (end.get(b) - v(ab)) = start.get(a) + end.get(b) - 2*v(ab).\n\nAh, that's the formula used in sum. Because when you add start and end, you are counting all strings that share the first character (but any second) and all that share the second character (any first). But the problem is that for those strings that share both first and second (i.e., same string as current), they are counted in both start and end. So subtracting 2 * v(ab) removes those duplicates. Because for each occurrence of ab, it's included once in start and once in end, but they should be subtracted because the pair (current ab, previous ab) would have zero differences, not one. So subtracting 2 * v(ab) ensures that those duplicates are removed.\n\nSo the sum accumulates this value for each string as it's processed. But since the processing is in order, for each i, we are considering the previous j < i, so the sum accumulates for each i the number of j < i that differ by exactly one character. This way, the total sum is the correct count.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct, provided that the input strings are properly read into the str array.\n\nSo the missing line in the TODO is reading the string into str[i]. The code for that would be str[i] = br.readLine(). Because each line corresponds to a string. So adding that line.\n\nSo the answer is to fill the TODO with that line."
