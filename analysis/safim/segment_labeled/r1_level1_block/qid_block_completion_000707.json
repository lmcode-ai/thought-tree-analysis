So perhaps the code is written incorrectly, but the user must not modify that part. Hmm, but that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the code is given with some parts missing, and the user is to fill in the missing lines, which could include the main function's structure.\n\nWait, the code starts with #include <iostream> and using namespace std;. Then the main function is written as main(int a), which is probably invalid. Because the return type is missing. So in C++, the main function must return int. So the code as given is invalid. But that's part of the code that's already present, and the user is supposed to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the user is allowed to modify the main function's parameters. But how?\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Because according to the problem statement, the code has missing lines or blocks that must be filled in. So perhaps the main function's parameters are part of the code that's already written, and the user can't change them, but that's invalid. Alternatively, perhaps the code is missing some lines, like the actual code inside main. So perhaps the main function's parameters are correct, but that's not possible. Because in standard C++, main can't be written that way.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is written in a way that the code is correct except for the missing part, but the code as given is invalid. So perhaps the original code has a mistake, and the user is supposed to correct it. For example, the main function's parameters are incorrect, and the user must fix that. But the problem says to fill in the missing lines, which implies that the code provided is otherwise correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is written in a non-standard way but compiles in some environments. For example, maybe the code is written without the return type (assuming int by default), but in C++ that's not allowed. So perhaps the code is wrong, but the user is to proceed as if that's correct and just fill in the code inside.\n\nThis is a bit of a problem. But perhaps the actual code inside is what's important. Let's think about what needs to be done.\n\nThe program must read t test cases, each with a rating, and output the division for each.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read t.\n\n2. For each of t test cases:\n\n   a. Read the rating.\n\n   b. Determine which division it's in.\n\n   c. Output \"Division X\".\n\nSo the code needs to handle this.\n\nIn the existing code, the main function is written as main(int a). So when the program starts, a is the number of command-line arguments. But that's not how to read input. So perhaps this code is incorrect, and the user is to replace it with the correct code. However, according to the problem statement, the code is given and the user must fill in the missing parts. So perhaps the code is supposed to have the correct structure, and the user must add code inside the main function.\n\nWait, but the code provided includes a main function with parameter (int a), which is incorrect. So perhaps the problem expects the user to write code that reads t and processes the test cases.\n\nBut in that case, the code inside the main function should read the input. So the code inside the TODO section must read t, then loop t times.\n\nSo perhaps the existing code's main function is written incorrectly, but the user is to ignore that and write code that properly reads the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct except for the missing code. But that's not possible. Because the main function's parameters are wrong. So perhaps the problem is a trick, but in reality, the code is missing the correct code inside.\n\nSo, perhaps the missing code is:\n\nRead t, then loop t times. For each iteration, read the rating, check which division, and output.\n\nSo here's the structure:\n\nInside the main function:\n\nint t;\ncin >> t;\nwhile(t--) {\n    int rating;\n    cin >> rating;\n    if (rating >= 1900) {\n        cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n    } else if (rating >= 1600) {\n        cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n    } else if (rating >= 1400) {\n        cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the conditions have to be checked in the right order. For example, if the rating is 1600, it's division 2. So the order of checking is important.\n\nThe divisions are:\n\nDivision 1: 1900 <= rating\n\nDivision 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n\nDivision 3: 1400 <= rating <=1599\n\nDivision4: <=1399\n\nSo the correct approach is to check from highest to lowest. So first check if >=1900: division 1.\n\nElse, check >=1600: division 2.\n\nElse, check >=1400: division3.\n\nElse division4.\n\nYes. So the code should check in that order.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be as above.\n\nBut what about the main function's parameters? Since the code is supposed to be filled in, maybe the code inside the main function is the part to be filled. So the existing code has a main function with parameter int a, but the user is to write code that reads t and processes each test case. So even though the main function's parameters are not correct, perhaps the code will work when the missing code is filled in. Wait, but in C++, the main function's parameters are argc and argv. So the code as written (main(int a)) is incorrect. So when compiling, this would generate an error. But maybe the problem expects the user to ignore that and proceed with filling in the code, assuming that the code's structure is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's code is a mistake, and the user is to write the correct main function. But according to the problem statement, the code is given with missing lines or blocks. So perhaps the main function's parameters are not part of the missing code and can be ignored. But that's unlikely. Because the code as given is invalid.\n\nHmm. This is a problem. If the code's main function is written incorrectly, the program won't compile. So perhaps the code provided is correct except for the missing lines. Therefore, the user must fill in the code such that the main function's parameters are corrected.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". So the code that's missing is the code inside the main function, and the user must output that part.\n\nIn that case, the existing code has a main function that's written as main(int a), which is invalid. But perhaps that's part of the code that's already present, and the user must fill in the code inside the main function. But the code as given would not compile. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct except for the parameters. For example, the code's main function is written as:\n\nint main() { ... }\n\nBut the given code has main(int a). So perhaps that's a mistake, but the user can't change that. But then the code would not compile.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. But given that the problem says to output the missing code as plain text, not the entire program, perhaps the code that's missing is the code inside the main function. So the user must write code that reads t, then processes each test case.\n\nSo, the solution is to write code inside the main function (the TODO section) that reads t from the input, then loops t times, each time reading a rating and outputting the division.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nint t;\ncin >> t;\nwhile (t--) {\n    int rating;\n    cin >> rating;\n    if (rating >= 1900) {\n        cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n    } else if (rating >= 1600) {\n        cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n    } else if (rating >= 1400) {\n        cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, the existing code has a main function with parameter (int a). How does that affect the code? The parameter a in main is supposed to be the number of command-line arguments (argc). So if the code is run with no arguments, a would be 1 (the program name). But in this case, the code is supposed to read from standard input, not command-line arguments. So the main function's parameters are irrelevant here. So the code's main function is written incorrectly. But the user is supposed to fill in the code inside the main function, regardless. So the code as written will not compile. But perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement's code, and the user is supposed to write code that ignores the parameter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's main function is written correctly as int main(), and the user is to fill in the code. So maybe the code in the problem statement is presented with some errors, but the user is to proceed under the assumption that the code is correct except for the missing parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's main function is written as:\n\nint main() { ... }\n\nBut the problem's code shows main(int a). So perhaps the user is to ignore that and write code that reads t and processes the test cases.\n\nIn any case, the code that's missing is the code inside the main function. So regardless of the main function's parameters, the code inside is the same.\n\nSo the missing code is the code that reads t and the test cases.\n\nThus, the answer is the code inside the main function as described.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nint t;\ncin >> t;\nwhile(t--) {\n    int rating;\n    cin >> rating;\n    if (rating >= 1900) {\n        cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n    } else if (rating >= 1600) {\n        cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n    } else if (rating >= 1400) {\n        cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, in C++, endl is a newline and flushes the buffer. Using \"\\n\" is more efficient, especially when there are a lot of test cases. But both work. The problem's examples show outputs like \"Division X\" followed by a new line. So using endl or \"\\n\" is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing: the code must handle all possible ratings in the given range. The conditions correctly capture the divisions. For example, a rating of 1899 is division 2, 1599 is division3, etc.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, the initial code has using namespace std; so we can use cin, cout, etc. without std::.\n\nSo the code inside the main function should be as above.\n\nSo the missing code is the code inside the main function that reads t and processes each test case.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the code that reads t, loops t times, reads each rating, and prints the division."
