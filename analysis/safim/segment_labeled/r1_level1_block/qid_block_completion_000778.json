For example, in the fifth test case, multiple numbers reach three.

So even after setting ans to 1, it will check the next elements. For example, if another element's count reaches 3, ans will be updated. But according to the problem statement, any is acceptable. So the code as written would work, but may not break early, but that's okay. However, perhaps the problem expects that once a number reaches 3, we can take it as the answer and not check the rest.
