Because each row requires s units of length, and there are s rows. So the sum of all blocks' lengths must be >= s^2. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2) >= s\u00b2. Wait, but how to compute that sum? Let's calculate the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nLet's see for small n:\n\nn=1: ceil(1/2)=1. sum=1.\n\nn=2: ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1. sum=2.\n\nn=3: 1,1,2. sum=4.\n\nn=4: 1,1,2,2. sum=6. n=5: 1,1,2,2,3. sum=9. n=6: 1,1,2,2,3,3. sum=12. So the sum for n is:\n\nFor even n=2k: sum = k*(k+1)/2 * 2 ? Wait wait. Let's think. For i from 1 to 2k:\n\nceil(i/2) is (1,1,2,2,3,3,...,k,k). So for even n=2k, the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) = k(k+1). For odd n=2k+1: sum is sum up to 2k (which is k(k+1)) plus ceil((2k+1)/2) =k+1. So sum is k(k+1) +k+1= (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. So sum for n is:\n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 +1 ) if n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2. Wait, let's check with examples:\n\nn=5 (odd). (5+1)/2=3. 3^2=9. Correct sum.\n\nn=6 (even): 6/2=3. 3*(3+1)=12. Correct.\n\nn=4 (even): 2*3=6. Correct. So sum is:\n\nsum = ( ( (n//2) ) * ( (n//2)+1 ) ) ) if n even.\n\nsum = ( ( (n+1)//2 ) ) ^2 if n odd. So for a given n, compute the sum S as above, then find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= S. So the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of S.\n\nBut how to compute that? But the problem is to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= sum(ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n). So for each test case n, compute S and then find s = floor( sqrt(S) ). But how to compute this quickly for n up to 1e9? Let's model this. Case 1: n is even. n = 2k. sum S = k*(k+1). We need to find s such that s\u00b2 <= k(k+1). Similarly, for n=2k+1 (odd):\n\nsum S = (k+1)^2. Then s would be k+1, since (k+1)^2 is exactly s\u00b2. So for odd n, the sum is a perfect square. So s is exactly (n+1)/2, since for n=2k+1, k+1 = (2k+1+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 = k+1. So for odd n, s is (n+1)/2. Wait, for example n=5 (odd), sum is 9, which is 3^2. So s=3. (5+1)/2=3. So yes. For even n=2k: sum is k*(k+1). Let's compute the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)). sqrt(k^2 +k) is between k and k+1. Because k\u00b2 <k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2 +2k+1 = (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So the floor is k.\n\nWait, wait, for example: k=3. sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464..., floor is 3. So s=3. Which is correct for n=6, sum=12, s=3. But for k=1: sum=1*2=2. s=1. Correct.\n\nk=2: sum 2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.45. floor is 2. But sum=6, s^2=4. Which is 2^2=4 <=6. But wait, the maximum s is 2 for sum 6. But 2\u00b2=4, and 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes. So for even n=2k, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ). But what is that equal to?\n\nWait, can we find a formula? Let's compute for even n=2k:\n\ns = floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ) But since k(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+0.5)^2 ? Wait, k(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k. Let's see if this is less than (k +0.5)^2. (k+0.5)^2 = k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So k\u00b2 +k is less than (k+0.5)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) <k+0.5. So floor is k.\n\nWait for example, k=3:\n\n3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464... which is less than 3.5. So floor is 3. Yes. So for even n=2k, s is k.\n\nWait, but that's the same as (n/2). Because n is even, so (n/2) =k. So s is k. But for n=6 (k=3), s=3. But sum is 12. 3^2 is 9, which is less than 12. But could there be a larger s?\n\nNo, because 4^2 is 16 which is larger than 12. So s=3. So for even n=2k, s is k. But wait, that's exactly (n/2). Wait, in this case, for even n, the maximum s is k =n/2. But wait, when n=2, sum=1*2=2. s=1, which is n/2=1. Yes. But for n=4, sum=2*3=6. s=2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6. Wait, but 2*3=6, the floor of sqrt(6) is 2. So yes. So for even n, s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ) which is k. So for even n=2k, s is k. But then, for even n, the s is k = n/2. But for even n, the sum is k(k+1) = (n/2)(n/2 +1). But the maximum s is k, because k^2 is k\u00b2, and the sum is k(k+1) >=k\u00b2. So s can be k. Because s^2=k^2 <=k(k+1) = sum. Yes, because k+1 >=k. So yes. So for even n, s is n/2. For odd n, s is (n+1)/2. Wait, but in the code provided, the current solution is to output (n+1)/2, which is integer division. For example, n=5 (odd) gives (5+1)/2=3, which is correct. For even n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5, but in integer division in C#, since n is an int, (n+1)/2 would be (6+1)/2=3.5, but since it's integer division, it's 3. Which matches the correct s for even n.\n\nWait, because for even n=2k, (n+1)/2 is (2k +1)/2, which is k + 0.5. But integer division in C# truncates towards zero, so for even n, (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 = k.5, which would be k when using integer division. Wait, 2k+1 is odd, divided by 2 gives k.5, but when using integer division, it's k. So (n+1)/2 in C# would be (even n=2k) \u2192 (2k +1)/2 in integer division is k.\n\nWait, for example, n=6: (6+1)/2=7/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division in C# is 3. But for even n=2k, the correct s is k. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 =k.5 \u2192 integer division would give k. So that's correct. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k: (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 in C#, when using integer division with integers, 7/2=3. So yes, for even n=6, (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Which is correct for s.\n\nFor odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3. So (n+1)/2 gives 3. Which is correct. So the code is currently outputting (n+1)/2 for both even and odd n, which seems to be correct. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, n=5 gives s=3, which matches (5+1)/2=3. And for even n=6, (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Which is correct. But wait, for even n=4:\n\nsum is 2*3=6. s\u00b2 can be 4 (2\u00b2) which is <=6. So s is 2. (4+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 2. Correct. So the formula (n+1)/2 with integer division gives the correct answer for both even and odd n.\n\nWait, that's the same as the current code. So why is the code not passing the test cases ?\n\nWait the problem is the code as written is:\n\nConsole. WriteLine((n + 1) / 2);\n\nBut when n is even, (n+1)/2 is (even +1)/2. For example, n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 1. Which is correct. sum is 2, s=1. Correct. Wait for n=3 (odd), (3+1)/2=2. sum is 4 (1+1+2). s=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. sum is 6. s=2. Correct. n=5: 3. Correct. n=6: 3. sum is 12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So correct. Wait, but for n=6, sum is 12. The maximum s is 3. Because 3\u00b2=9 \u226412, and 4\u00b2=16>12. So 3 is correct. But according to (n+1)/2 for n=6: 7/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. Correct. So the code seems to work. But why is the problem presented as needing code completion?",

The problem says that each block has a length of ceil(i/2). So for i=1, it's 1. For i=2, 1. For i=3, 2. And so on.

The code provided currently just outputs (n +1)/2, which I suspect is incorrect. Because when I look at the example given in the note: for n=5, the answer is 3. But according to (5+1)/2 that's 3, which matches. Wait, maybe the initial code is correct? But why then the user is asking to complete the code? Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's think again. The blocks are each 1 unit high and ceil(i/2) units long. So when building a square of side length s, each row is s units long. Each block contributes its length to the row. Since the height of each block is 1, each row is made by placing blocks horizontally. So the total area of all blocks must be at least s^2. Because each row requires s units of length, and there are s rows. So the sum of all blocks' lengths must be >= s^2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2) >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, but how to compute that sum? Let's calculate the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nLet's see for small n:\n\nn=1: ceil(1/2)=1. sum=1.\n\nn=2: ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1. sum=2.\n\nn=3: 1,1,2. sum=4.\n\nn=4: 1,1,2,2. sum=6.\n\nn=5: 1,1,2,2,3. sum=9.\n\nn=6: 1,1,2,2,3,3. sum=12.\n\nSo the sum for n is:\n\nFor even n=2k: sum = k*(k+1)/2 * 2 ? Wait wait. Let's think. For i from 1 to 2k:\n\nceil(i/2) is (1,1,2,2,3,3,...,k,k). So for even n=2k, the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) = k(k+1).\n\nFor odd n=2k+1: sum is sum up to 2k (which is k(k+1)) plus ceil((2k+1)/2) =k+1.

For example, n=5 (odd) gives (5+1)/2=3, which is correct. For even n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5, but in integer division in C#, since n is an int, (n+1)/2 would be (6+1)/2=3.5, but since it's integer division, it's 3. Which matches the correct s for even n.\n\nWait, because for even n=2k, (n+1)/2 is (2k +1)/2, which is k + 0.5. But integer division in C# truncates towards zero, so for even n, (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 = k.5, which would be k when using integer division. Wait, 2k+1 is odd, divided by 2 gives k.5, but when using integer division, it's k. So (n+1)/2 in C# would be (even n=2k) \u2192 (2k +1)/2 in integer division is k.\n\nWait, for example, n=6: (6+1)/2=7/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division in C# is 3.\n\nBut for even n=2k, the correct s is k. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 =k.5 \u2192 integer division would give k. So that's correct.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k: (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 in C#, when using integer division with integers, 7/2=3. So yes, for even n=6, (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Which is correct for s.\n\nFor odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3. So (n+1)/2 gives 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is currently outputting (n+1)/2 for both even and odd n, which seems to be correct.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement, n=5 gives s=3, which matches (5+1)/2=3. And for even n=6, (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, for even n=4:\n\nsum is 2*3=6. s\u00b2 can be 4 (2\u00b2) which is <=6. So s is 2. (4+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nSo the formula (n+1)/2 with integer division gives the correct answer for both even and odd n.\n\nWait, that's the same as the current code. So why is the code not passing the test cases?\n\nWait the problem is the code as written is:\n\nConsole.WriteLine((n + 1) / 2);\n\nBut when n is even, (n+1)/2 is (even +1)/2. For example, n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 1. Which is correct. sum is 2, s=1. Correct.\n\nWait for n=3 (odd), (3+1)/2=2. sum is 4 (1+1+2). s=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. sum is 6. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=5: 3. Correct.\n\nn=6: 3. sum is 12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So correct.\n\nWait, but for n=6, sum is 12. The maximum s is 3. Because 3\u00b2=9 \u226412, and 4\u00b2=16>12. So 3 is correct.\n\nBut according to (n+1)/2 for n=6: 7/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work. But why is the problem presented as needing code completion? Maybe the initial code is wrong. But according to the analysis, the code is correct. But that's conflicting with the problem statement. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake and the code is correct. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait let's re-examine the problem statement. The sample input for n=5 is 3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. For n=6, the code outputs 3, which is correct. But wait, the sum for n=6 is 12. The maximum s is 3, because 3*3=9 <=12. So the code's output is correct.\n\nSo why is the code provided considered incomplete? Because according to the initial analysis, the code is correct. So perhaps the code is correct and the problem is solved by the given code, but the user is confused.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code needs to be completed. But the code given already has the correct logic. So perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the code is not correct. Let's test another case. For example, n=7.\n\nn=7 is odd. sum is ((7+1)/2)^2=4^2=16. s=4. According to code: (7+1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=8 (even). sum is 4*5=20. s=4. 4\u00b2=16 <=20. code gives (8+1)/2=4.5 \u2192 4. Correct.\n\nn=9 (odd). (9+1)/2=5. sum=5^2=25. s=5. Correct.\n\nn=10 (even). sum is 5*6=30. s=5. code outputs (10+1)/2=5.5 \u21925. Correct.\n\nn=12 even: sum is 6*7=42. s=6. code outputs 6.5/2=6.5 \u2192 (12+1)/2=13/2=6.5 \u2192 6. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct. So why is the problem presented as needing code completion? Perhaps the original code is correct, but the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the code that's supposed to be filled in.\n\nBut according to the code provided, the Query method is outputting (n +1)/2. Which is correct for all test cases. So the code is correct. Then why is this problem here?\n\nWait, maybe the code is actually incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem says that each block has a length of ceil(i/2). So for i=1, it's 1. For i=2, 1. For i=3, 2. And so on.\n\nThe sum of these lengths is as computed earlier, which for even n=2k is k*(k+1), and for odd n=2k+1 is (k+1)^2.\n\nBut when we want to compute the maximum s, it's the floor of sqrt(S), where S is the sum. But in the code, it's outputting (n+1)/2, which for even n is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 which for integer division is k. For odd n, (2k+2)/2 =k+1.\n\nBut S for even n=2k is k*(k+1). The maximum s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nWait, but sqrt(k(k+1)) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) which is less than k+0.5. Because (k +0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is less than k+0.5. So the floor is k. So for even n=2k, s is k. Which is exactly (n+1)/2 in integer division. Because (2k+1)/2= k.5 \u2192 integer division gives k.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n=2k+1, the sum is (k+1)^2. So s is k+1. Which is (2k+1 +1)/2 =k+1. So code's formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct, and the answer is indeed (n+1)/2 using integer division. So the code is correct as written.\n\nBut why is this presented as a problem requiring completion? It seems that the code is already correct. Unless there's a hidden part of the code that is missing. Looking back at the code provided, perhaps the Scanner class is incomplete. In the Scanner class, the Next() method has a TODO comment. Let's look at that code.\n\nIn the Scanner class:\n\npublic string Next()\n{\n    if (_index >= _line.Length)\n    {\n        string s;\n        do\n        {\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n        } while (s.Length == 0);\n\n        _line = s.Split(Separator);\n        _index = 0;\n    }\n\n    return _line[_index++];\n}\n\nThe TODO part is where the code reads the input. So the user must fill in the code that reads the input line for s. The current code has a do-while loop that tries to read until s is non-empty. But the code inside the loop is missing.\n\nIn C#, to read a line from the console, you can use Console.ReadLine(). So inside the do loop, the code should read a line from the console and assign it to s.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ns = Console.ReadLine();\n\nBecause otherwise, the code will not read anything and s will not be initialized, leading to a compilation error.\n\nSo the correct code for the TODO part is to read the line using s = Console.ReadLine();\n\nSo the answer is to fill in that line.\n\nSo the missing code is inserting s = Console.ReadLine(); in the TODO section of the Scanner's Next() method."
