That's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the rest of the code to make sure. The main part is the 'calc' function and how the cost is calculated. The initial cost is computed by summing calc(i, n, a) for each i from 1 to n. Then, when processing queries, they subtract and add terms based on the index being changed.\n\nThe 'calc' function seems to check if the current index and the next (idx+1) are different. If they are different, it returns idx multiplied by (n - idx). Otherwise, returns 0. Hmm. So this is probably counting the number of subarrays where the split between idx and idx+1 contributes to the awesomeness. \n\nBecause for the sum of awesomeness across all subarrays, each split between two consecutive elements contributes 1 to the awesomeness of a subarray if they are different. For example, if elements at positions i and i+1 are different, then any subarray that includes both of them and spans across this split will have their awesomeness increased by 1. So the total contribution of this split is the number of possible left ends (from 1 to i) multiplied by the number of right ends (from i+1 to n). Which is exactly i*(n - i) as in the code.\n\nSo the total sum is the sum of all such contributions for each split that is a boundary (i.e., a[i] != a[i+1]). Then, the initial sum of awesomeness for all subarrays is equal to the sum of these contributions plus the number of all possible subarrays. Because each subarray's awesomeness is the number of splits (boundaries between different elements) plus 1. For example, a subarray with k splits (k+1 blocks) contributes k+1 to the sum. So the sum can be written as the sum over all splits (each contributing 1 for each subarray that includes that split) plus the number of subarrays (since each has at least 1 block). \n\nWait, because each subarray's awesomeness is 1 plus the number of splits (boundaries where consecutive elements differ) within the subarray. So the total sum is equal to the number of subarrays (each contributes 1) plus the number of splits that are included in each subarray. \n\nSo the total sum is (n*(n+1)/2) [which is the number of subarrays] plus the sum over all splits (each split i contributes the number of subarrays that include it, which is i*(n - i)). \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each split at position i (between a[i] and a[i+1]) contributes 1 for each subarray that starts at or before i and ends at or after i+1. So for a split at i, the left can be any l from 1 to i, and the right can be any r from i+1 to n. So the number of subarrays that include this split is i * (n - (i+1) + 1) ) = i * (n - i). Because r can be i+1 to n, which is (n - i) options. So each split contributes i*(n -i) to the sum. \n\nTherefore, the total sum is the number of subarrays (which is n*(n+1)/2) plus the sum over all splits (each contributes i*(n-i)), where a split is a position i where a[i] != a[i+1].\n\nWait, no. Because the awesomeness is the number of blocks, which is (number of splits in the subarray) + 1. So the total sum over all subarrays is sum (number of splits in the subarray) + sum (1 for each subarray). The sum of 1 for each subarray is n*(n+1)/2. The sum of splits in each subarray is the sum over all possible splits (i) of the number of subarrays that include that split. So indeed, the total sum is n*(n+1)/2 plus the sum over all splits (i) of i*(n-i). \n\nIn the code, the initial 'cost' variable seems to be the sum of the contributions from the splits. Then, when outputting the answer, they add n*(n+1)/2 to 'cost' to get the total sum. Because in the sample input, after the first query, the answer is 29, which equals the cost plus n*(n+1)/2.
