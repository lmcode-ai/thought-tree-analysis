Let me think about the order of checking. Because if I check in a certain order, like check for division 1 first (since if it's >=1900, that's the answer). Then check division 2 (since if it's >=1600 and <=1899, but since we've already checked for >=1900, we can just check if it's >=1600. Wait, but the original division 2 is 1600 to 1899. So after checking if it's >=1900 (div1), then if it's >=1600, it's div2. Wait, no. Because if after checking for >=1900, the next check could be if >=1600, but then that would include 1600-1899, which is correct. Then division 3 is >=1400 but that would be checked after division 2. Wait, but division 3 is 1400-1599. So after checking division 2 (>=1600), then if it's >=1400, but since division 2 is already checked, the remaining >=1400 would be 1400-1599, so division 3. Then the rest (<=1399) would be division4. So the order of checks should be:\n\nif (rating >=1900) \u2192 division1\n\nelse if (rating >=1600) \u2192 division2\n\nelse if (rating >=1400) \u2192 division3\n\nelse \u2192 division4\n\nSo that's the order of conditions.",
