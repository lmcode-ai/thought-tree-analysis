So, for example, if a substring has 3 distinct characters, each can appear up to 3 times. The task is to count all such substrings in the given string. Looking at the code, the main part is nested loops. The outer loop (j) iterates over each starting index of the substring. Then, for each j, the inner loop (s) goes from j to min(m, j+100).

So for a substring longer than 100 characters, say, 101, even if all are distinct, the number of distinct would be 101, but each can appear once. But since there are only 10 possible digits, the maximum possible distinct is 10. Therefore, any substring longer than 100 characters (since 10 distinct can each appear up to 10 times, 10*10=100) can't be diverse. So the code is checking up to j+100, which makes sense. So the inner loop runs for at most 100 characters, which keeps the time manageable. Inside the inner loop, they have an array b that counts the occurrences of each digit. sum1 is the number of distinct digits. Then, when a new character is added (s increments), they check if the current count of that character exceeds max. If it does, they need to update max. The TODO is here. Wait, the code has:\n\nif (b[a[s] -48] > max) {\n    // TODO\n} So when the count of the current character increases beyond the current max, we need to update max. Because max is the maximum frequency of any character in the current substring. The max is compared to sum1 (the number of distinct characters). If max <= sum1, then the substring is diverse. So in the TODO part, we should set max to the new value of b[a[s]-48], right? Because when a character's count becomes higher than the current max, the new max is that count. So the missing line here is max = b[a[s] -48]; because when you increment the count for a[s], you check if this new count exceeds the previous max, and if so, update max.
