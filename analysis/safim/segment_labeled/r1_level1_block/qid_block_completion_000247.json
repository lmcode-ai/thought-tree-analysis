The code reads N and M (rows and columns), then for each a_i:\n\nif (a >=2*N) { ... } // this is the missing code for R\nif (a >=2*M) { ... } // this is the existing code for C.\n\nSo perhaps R is for rows and C for columns. For example, when considering horizontal stripes (rows), each stripe is two rows. Each row has M cells. So a_i >= 2*M implies that the a_i can cover two rows (2*M cells). Then, the code adds a_i / M to R, which would be the number of rows covered. For example, a_i=3*M would allow adding 3 rows (3*M / M =3). But two rows per stripe. So in this case, the code's approach is to sum all possible rows that can be covered (each row requiring M cells), and then check if the sum of rows (R) is >= N (the total needed). But that can't be right, since each row requires M cells, but to form a stripe of two rows, you need 2*M cells. So if a_i is 2*M, then R += 2*M / M = 2. So two rows can be covered. But the code's logic for R is adding a_i/M when a_i >= 2*M. So for a_i=2*M, that adds 2 to R. But for a stripe of two rows, you need 2*M cells. So for each such a_i, R increases by 2 (since 2*M / M =2). So this seems correct. Then, the code's check for R >= M (the total columns?) no. Wait, the code's final check is:\n\n((C >= N) && (hasGreaterThanTwoC || ((N%2) == 0))) || ((R >= M) && (hasGreaterThanTwoR || ((M%2) == 0))) Hmm. So for the first part: C >= N (the total rows?) and some conditions. Or R >= M (columns) and some conditions. This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to understand the code's logic. Let's suppose that the code is considering two possibilities:\n\n1. Fill the grid using vertical stripes (columns) such that each stripe is at least two columns wide. For this, each stripe of two columns requires 2*N cells (since each column has N cells). So a_i must be >=2*N. The code checks a >=2*N and adds a / N to C (since each a_i can contribute (a_i // N) columns). Wait, but if a_i is >=2*N, then a_i//N is 2, so that's two columns. So for each such a_i, the code is adding 2 columns (from 2*N) to C. So C is the sum of columns contributed by all a_i where a_i >=2*N.\n\nThen, the code checks if C >= M (the total required columns) and if either the total M is even (so can be covered by pairs of two columns) or there's a a_i that's >=3*N (so can cover three columns, which would allow for an odd M). Wait, but in the code's existing code for the C variable (the code that's already present), the code checks a >=2*M. Wait, but in that case, if the code is supposed to handle vertical stripes (columns), then the a_i should be >=2*N. So the code's existing code for the C case is using M instead of N. Which suggests that there's a bug in the code. For example, in the code as written:",

Maybe C is the sum of possible rows that can be covered. Wait, if C is the sum of possible rows, then each row is M cells. So a_i >=2*M means that the a_i can cover two rows (since 2*M cells).

The code's check is:\n\nC >=N (sum of rows covered is >= N) and (hasGreaterThanTwoC (any a_i >=3*M) OR N is even). Wait, why N is even? Because if N is even, then all stripes can be two rows each, and the sum C must be >=N. For example, if N is 4, then two stripes of two rows each. Each stripe requires 2*M cells. So C must be >=4 (sum of 2+2). But the code's check is C >=N (4) and N is even. Which works. But if N is 5 (odd), then C must be >=5. So sum of rows covered must be >=5. But to form 5 rows, you can have two stripes of two rows (sum 4) and one stripe of one row? No, that's not possible. Wait, no. Because each stripe must be at least two rows, or three? Or perhaps the code's logic is that if any a_i can contribute three rows (like 3*M), then that allows you to have a stripe of three rows, which when combined with others (two rows each) can sum to an odd N. For example, N=5: 3 + 2 =5. So sum of C must be >=5, and there must be at least one a_i that can contribute three rows (so that hasGreaterThanTwoC is true). So the code's check is:\n\nIf (C >=N) and (N is even OR hasGreaterThanTwoC) \u2192 then possible via horizontal stripes. Similarly for vertical stripes: (R >=M) and (M is even OR hasGreaterThanTwoR). Now, the code's existing code for C (horizontal stripes) is:\n\nfor each a_i:\n\nif (a >=2*M) \u2192 add a/M to C.\n\nif (a >=3*M \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoC to true. So for a_i=3*M \u2192 a/M is 3, which adds 3 to C. And sets hasGreaterThanTwoC. But for a_i=2*M \u2192 a/M is 2 \u2192 adds 2 to C. So sum C would be 2 for this a_i. Now, the code's missing part is the code for R (vertical stripes). The code is missing the code inside the if (a >=2*N) block. So, for vertical stripes:\n\nif (a_i >=2*N \u2192 then add a/N to R.\n\nAnd if a_i >=3*N \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoR to true. Because each vertical stripe (column) requires N cells per column. So two columns \u2192 2*N cells. So if a_i >=2*N \u2192 then a_i/N is 2 \u2192 adds 2 to R (columns covered). So, the missing code should be:\n\nR += a / N;\n\nif (a >= 3*N) {\n    hasGreaterThanTwoR = true;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the code's existing code for C, they do:\n\nif (a >=2*M) {\n    C += a/M;\n    if (a >=3*M)\n        hasGreaterThanTwoC = true;\n} So for the vertical stripes case (R), the code should do:\n\nif (a >=2*N) {\n    R += a/N;\n    if (a >=3*N)\n        hasGreaterThanTwoR = true;\n} But looking at the code, the variables R and C are initialized to zero. So, in the missing code block (for the a >=2*N case), we need to add to R the value of a / N, and check if a is >=3*N to set hasGreaterThanTwoR.\n\nTherefore, the missing code inside the if(a>=2*N) block is:\n\nR += a / N; if (a >=3*N)\n    hasGreaterThanTwoR = true;\n\nSo, that's the code that needs to be filled in. Putting it all together, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read N, M, K.\n\n- For each pigment a_i:\n\n   - if a_i >= 2*N \u2192 add a_i / N to R (columns covered via vertical stripes).\n\n      - if a_i >=3*N \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoR to true.\n\n   - if a_i >=2*M \u2192 add a_i / M to C (rows covered via horizontal stripes).\n\n      - if a_i >=3*M \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoC to true. Then check:\n\nIf (C >= N and (hasGreaterThanTwoC or N is even)) \u2192 possible via horizontal stripes. OR If (R >= M and (hasGreaterThanTwoR or M is even)) \u2192 possible via vertical stripes. If either is true, output Yes, else No. But wait, the code's final condition is:\n\n((C>=N) && (hasGreaterThanTwoC || N%2 ==0)) || ((R>=M) && (hasGreaterThanTwoR || M%2 ==0 )). So, for example, for horizontal stripes:\n\nC is the sum of rows covered (each row is M cells). We need C >= N (total rows required). But how can C be >=N? Because each a_i >=2*M contributes a_i/M rows. For example, if N is 5, and a pigment has a_i=3*M, then C +=3. If another has a_i=2*M, C +=2. Then C=5, which equals N. So sum is 5.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if it's possible to color a grid such that every cell has at least three toroidal neighbors of the same color. The given code is incomplete, and I need to fill in the missing parts.\n\nHmm. The code seems to be handling each test case. The variables R and C are being calculated. Looking at the existing code: for each pigment a_i, if a_i >= 2*M, then it contributes to C by adding a/M. Also, if a_i is >=3*M, then hasGreaterThanTwoC is set to true. Similarly, there's a part commented out where R is being handled. Oh wait, the code has a section for a >=2*N but the code inside is missing. So that's where the missing code is.\n\nWait, the code reads each a_i. For each a_i, if it's >=2*N, then do something for R. Then, if >=2*M, do something for C. The problem requires that all cells are covered, and the coloring meets the neighbor condition.\n\nSo the approach here seems to be that the solution can be either a row-wise or column-wise tiling. Like, maybe if the grid can be covered using stripes of colors, either all rows or all columns. Because in that case, each cell's neighbors would be in the same row or column.\n\nWait, the toroidal neighbors. Let's think. For example, if all cells in a row are the same color. Then, each cell has two neighbors in the same row (left and right), but since it's toroidal, maybe that's correct. Wait, but the problem states that each cell must have at least three neighbors of the same color. So if the rows are all same color, then each cell's left and right (same row) are same color, and the up and down (same column) might be different. But that's only two same-colored neighbors. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe if the entire grid is colored with one color. Then every neighbor is same color. So that's four. But then the total cells needed would be N*M. But in that case, the a_i's sum must be >= N*M, but also, there must be at least one color that has a_i >= N*M. Or maybe not sum, but each cell is assigned exactly one color, so the sum of all a_i must be >= N*M, but each a_i is the maximum cells that can be used for that color.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any assignment where each cell is colored with exactly one pigment (since all cells must be colored). So the sum of a_i must be >= N*M, but also each a_i is the maximum allowed for that pigment. So the sum of all a_i must be >= N*M, but also, we need to check if there's a way to assign the cells such that each cell has at least three same-colored neighbors.\n\nBut the approach in the code seems different. The variables R and C are being tracked. For example, when a pigment can cover 2*M cells, it contributes to C. Then, when the total C (sum of a_i/M where a_i >=2*M) is >= N, then maybe it's possible. Similarly for R. But why?\n\nAh, perhaps the idea is to tile the grid with vertical or horizontal stripes. For example, vertical stripes (columns) where each stripe is two columns wide. Wait, but that's for when M is even. Or maybe the code is considering whether the colors can be arranged in rows or columns such that each row/column is covered by a color that can cover multiple rows or columns.\n\nWait, let's think about the condition for a beautiful picture. Each cell needs at least three neighbors of the same color. Let's say the grid is divided into vertical stripes, each two columns wide. For a cell in such a stripe, the left and right neighbors are same color (since it's a two-column stripe). But since the grid is toroidal, the neighbors above and below would be in the same column. Wait, but the vertical stripes are columns. So in a vertical stripe of two columns, each cell has left and right as same color (since adjacent columns in the same stripe), but the up and down neighbors are also same color if the stripe is contiguous. Wait, maybe not. For example, if the stripe is two columns wide, then a cell (x,y) has left neighbor (x, y-1 mod m), which is same color. Right neighbor same. Up (x-1 mod n, y) same color? Only if the entire column is same color. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution requires that each color is used in a way that forms a contiguous block that's at least two rows or two columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that each color's cells form a region where each cell in the region has at least three same-color neighbors. For example, if the entire grid is one color, then all neighbors are same color. So that's valid. So if any a_i >= n*m, then it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the grid is divided into vertical stripes of two columns each, and each stripe is a single color. Then, each cell in the stripe has two left-right neighbors same color. But up and down neighbors would be same color as well. Wait, because in a vertical stripe of two columns, the cells in adjacent rows are same color. So the up and down neighbors (same column) are same color. So each cell would have four same-colored neighbors. That satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, for example, if a color is used for two columns. Then, each cell in those two columns has same color. So, for each cell (x,y), the left and right (mod m) would be same color (since two columns), and the up and down (mod n) would be same color (since same column). Wait, but same column would be part of the same stripe only if the stripe is two columns wide. Wait, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the entire grid is covered using vertical stripes where each stripe is two columns wide, then for a cell in such a stripe, the left and right neighbors are in the same stripe (since it's two columns), and the up and down are same column (so same stripe). So all four neighbors are same color. So that's good. So each cell would have four same-colored neighbors, which meets the condition.\n\nBut how to check if this is possible.\n\nIn this case, each vertical stripe (two columns) requires m must be even? Because each stripe is two columns. So if m is even, then you can have m/2 stripes of two columns each. Each such stripe would require that each color used for it can cover n * 2 cells (since two columns, each with n cells). So for each color, a_i must be >= 2n. Because each vertical stripe is two columns, each of which has n rows. So 2n per stripe. Then, the number of vertical stripes needed is m/2. So total cells would be 2n * (m/2) = n*m.\n\nSo the sum of (a_i / (2n)) across all colors should be >= m/2. But wait, no. Because each stripe of two columns would require 2n cells. So for a color to contribute to this, its a_i must be >= 2n. Then, each such a_i can contribute a_i/(2n) stripes. The total required is m/2. So sum of (a_i/(2n)) for all a_i >= 2n) should be >= m/2. But this is for vertical stripes.\n\nBut in the code, there's a part where for a_i >=2*N (so 2n), they add to R. But in the code, the existing code for C is when a_i >=2*M. So perhaps the code is considering two possibilities: either arranging in vertical stripes (columns) or horizontal stripes (rows).\n\nWait, the variables R and C: for vertical stripes (columns), each stripe is two columns, so each requires 2n cells. So for each a_i >= 2n, the maximum number of such stripes is a_i/(2n). The sum of these for all colors must be >= m/2. But m must be even in this case, unless one of the a_i is >=3n, allowing for an odd m.\n\nSimilarly for horizontal stripes (rows), each stripe is two rows, so each requires 2m cells. So a_i >= 2m. Sum of a_i/(2m) must be >=n/2. And n must be even, unless one of the a_i is >=3m.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's look at the code again. The code's final check is:\n\nif ((C >= N and (hasGreaterThanTwoC or N is even)) OR (R >= M and (hasGreaterThanTwoR or M is even)) then output Yes.\n\nWait, the code seems to check if either:\n\n1. The sum C (sum of a_i/M when a_i >=2M) is >= N, and either (hasGreaterThanTwoC) or N is even. \n\nOR \n\n2. The sum R (sum of a_i/N when a_i >=2N) is >= M, and either (hasGreaterThanTwoR) or M is even.\n\nBut what's the logic here?\n\nWait, perhaps C is the sum of the number of rows that can be formed from the pigments when each row is covered in a way that each color's contribution is M cells per row. Because for vertical stripes, each color contributes to columns, but maybe in the code, C is the number of columns covered. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, think of C as the total number of columns that can be covered by using vertical stripes. For vertical stripes, each stripe is two columns. Each such stripe requires 2n cells (since each column has n cells, two columns is 2n). So a pigment with a_i >=2n can contribute (a_i)/(2n) *2 columns (since each 2n cells covers two columns). Wait, but perhaps the code is not tracking that. Alternatively, perhaps the code is considering that each vertical stripe is two columns, but for each color, the number of columns it can contribute is floor(a_i / n). Because each column requires n cells. So if a_i >= 2n, then floor(a_i /n) is 2, which can contribute two columns. But that's if the stripe is two columns.\n\nWait, maybe the code is thinking that for vertical stripes, each color can cover multiple columns. Each column requires m cells? No, that's not right. Wait, vertical stripes are columns, so each column has n cells. So if a pigment can cover a_i cells, then it can contribute floor(a_i /n) columns. But if you need to form vertical stripes that are at least two columns wide, then maybe each color can contribute floor(a_i/(2n)) *2 columns. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to model two possible patterns:\n\n1. Vertical stripes where each stripe is two columns. For this, each color contributes a_i/(2n) *2 columns. So total columns is sum (a_i/(2n) *2) = sum (a_i/(n)). So sum of a_i/(n) for a_i >=2n. Because if a_i is less than 2n, then a_i/(n) would be 1, but since you need two columns per stripe, that's not enough. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering two possibilities for the arrangement:\n\na) The grid is filled by colors arranged in vertical stripes (columns), each of which can be 2 columns wide. However, if m is even, then each stripe is 2 columns. But if m is odd, then you need at least one stripe that is 3 columns wide. So to cover m columns, the sum of columns contributed by the colors must be >= m. Each color can contribute columns as a_i / m (wait, but m is the number of columns in the grid, which is variable per test case). Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: for the picture to be beautiful, each cell must have three same-colored neighbors. The code's approach seems to check for two possible configurations:\n\n1. The entire grid is filled with vertical stripes (columns) where each stripe is at least two columns wide. In this case, each cell in a stripe would have left and right neighbors in the same stripe (if the stripe is two columns wide). But since the grid is toroidal, the left and right are same color. Additionally, the up and down neighbors (same column) are same color. So each cell has four same-colored neighbors. Thus, the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut how to model this. For each vertical stripe, each column in the stripe requires n cells (since each column has n rows). So a stripe of two columns requires 2n cells. So for a color to contribute to vertical stripes, its a_i must be >= 2n. Then, the number of columns contributed by this color is (a_i // (2n)) * 2. Wait, because each 2n cells gives two columns. But the code in the example for C is adding a_i / M. Wait, but in the code, M is the number of columns. So for a vertical stripe scenario, perhaps each color can contribute (a_i / (n)) columns, but only if a_i >= 2n (since each stripe is two columns, needing 2n cells). So (a_i / (2n)) * 2 columns. But the code's existing code for the C case (which is when a_i >=2*M) is adding a_i/M. So M is the number of columns, and a_i >= 2*M. Then, a_i / M is how many columns (each of M cells) can be formed. Wait, but M is the number of columns in the grid. So if a_i >=2*M, then a_i /M is at least 2, which could represent two columns. But why? Because each column has M cells (no, wait, the number of rows is N, columns is M. Each column has N cells. So to cover a column, you need N cells. So if a_i >= 2*N, then you can contribute two columns (since 2*N cells would cover two columns, each of N cells). So maybe the code is mixing up rows and columns here.\n\nWait, in the code, the variables R and C are being used. The existing code for the C case is:\n\nif (a >= 2*M) {\n    C += a/M;\n    if (a >=3*M)\n        hasGreaterThanTwoC = true;\n}\n\nSo M is the number of columns in the grid. So a >=2*M implies that a can cover at least two columns (each column requires M cells, but wait no: each column has N cells. Because the grid is N rows and M columns. So each column has N cells. So to cover a column, you need N cells. So if a_i >=2*N, then that's two columns. But in the code, the condition is a >=2*M. That seems wrong. Because M is columns, and each column has N cells. So the code's current approach is incorrect here. Wait, this suggests that there's a mistake in the code's current logic.\n\nWait, let's think again. If the code is considering the vertical stripes approach (columns), then each vertical stripe of two columns would require 2*N cells (since each column is N cells). So a_i must be >= 2*N. Then, the number of columns that can be covered by this a_i is (a_i) // (2*N) * 2. For example, if a_i is 3*N, then 3*N // 2*N is 1, so two columns. But if the code is adding a_i / M to C, then this is wrong. Because M is the number of columns in the grid. So if the code is using M as the divisor, that's incorrect. Because each column requires N cells, not M.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the code's existing logic. For instance, in the code for the C case (vertical stripes), the code checks a >=2*M and then adds a/M to C. But that's not correct if the code is supposed to track how many columns can be covered. Because each column requires N cells, not M. So the code's logic here is wrong. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables R and C are swapped. Let me look again. The code reads N and M (rows and columns), then for each a_i:\n\nif (a >=2*N) { ... } // this is the missing code for R\nif (a >=2*M) { ... } // this is the existing code for C.\n\nSo perhaps R is for rows and C for columns. For example, when considering horizontal stripes (rows), each stripe is two rows. Each row has M cells. So a_i >= 2*M implies that the a_i can cover two rows (2*M cells). Then, the code adds a_i / M to R, which would be the number of rows covered. For example, a_i=3*M would allow adding 3 rows (3*M / M =3). But two rows per stripe. So in this case, the code's approach is to sum all possible rows that can be covered (each row requiring M cells), and then check if the sum of rows (R) is >= N (the total needed). But that can't be right, since each row requires M cells, but to form a stripe of two rows, you need 2*M cells. So if a_i is 2*M, then R += 2*M / M = 2. So two rows can be covered. But the code's logic for R is adding a_i/M when a_i >= 2*M. So for a_i=2*M, that adds 2 to R. But for a stripe of two rows, you need 2*M cells. So for each such a_i, R increases by 2 (since 2*M / M =2). So this seems correct. Then, the code's check for R >= M (the total columns?) no. Wait, the code's final check is:\n\n((C >= N) && (hasGreaterThanTwoC || ((N%2) == 0))) || ((R >= M) && (hasGreaterThanTwoR || ((M%2) == 0)))\n\nHmm. So for the first part: C >= N (the total rows?) and some conditions. Or R >= M (columns) and some conditions.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to understand the code's logic.\n\nLet's suppose that the code is considering two possibilities:\n\n1. Fill the grid using vertical stripes (columns) such that each stripe is at least two columns wide. For this, each stripe of two columns requires 2*N cells (since each column has N cells). So a_i must be >=2*N. The code checks a >=2*N and adds a / N to C (since each a_i can contribute (a_i // N) columns). Wait, but if a_i is >=2*N, then a_i//N is 2, so that's two columns. So for each such a_i, the code is adding 2 columns (from 2*N) to C. So C is the sum of columns contributed by all a_i where a_i >=2*N.\n\nThen, the code checks if C >= M (the total required columns) and if either the total M is even (so can be covered by pairs of two columns) or there's a a_i that's >=3*N (so can cover three columns, which would allow for an odd M).\n\nWait, but in the code's existing code for the C variable (the code that's already present), the code checks a >=2*M. Wait, but in that case, if the code is supposed to handle vertical stripes (columns), then the a_i should be >=2*N. So the code's existing code for the C case is using M instead of N. Which suggests that there's a bug in the code. For example, in the code as written:\n\nFor vertical stripes (columns):\n\nEach column requires N cells (since N rows). So a stripe of two columns requires 2*N cells. So for a_i >=2*N, the code should add (a_i / (2*N)) * 2 columns. But the code is checking a >=2*M and adding a_i/M. So this is incorrect. Because 2*M is the number of cells needed for two rows (each row has M cells). So the code's existing C variable is for rows, and R is for columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables R and C are swapped. Let's think: the code's comment says:\n\nR=C=0;\n\nThen, for each a_i:\n\nif(a >=2*N) { ... } // this is the missing code for R\nif(a >=2*M) { ... } // existing code for C.\n\nSo in the code, the R variable is being handled in the first if (a >=2*N) block, which is the missing code.\n\nBut then, in the existing code for C, when a >=2*M, then C is increased by a/M. So, for example, if a is 3*M, then 3*M / M =3, so C increases by 3. So what's C supposed to represent? Maybe C is the sum of possible rows that can be covered.\n\nWait, if C is the sum of possible rows, then each row is M cells. So a_i >=2*M means that the a_i can cover two rows (since 2*M cells). So a_i/M is the number of rows (each row M cells). So adding a_i/M to C.\n\nSo in this scenario, C is the total number of rows that can be covered, considering that each a_i >=2*M contributes to that. Then, the code's check for C >= N (the total rows needed). So if the sum of C is >=N, and either N is even or there's a a_i that can cover three rows (a_i >=3*M), then it's possible.\n\nSo the code's approach is to check two possibilities:\n\n- Can we arrange the colors as horizontal stripes (rows) where each stripe is two rows wide. For this, each color contributes a_i/M rows (each row is M cells), but the color must have a_i >=2*M (so two rows per contribution). Then, the sum of these rows must be >= N (the total rows needed). However, for the stripes to form even numbers, if N is even, then each stripe is two rows. But if N is odd, then at least one stripe must be three rows (so that the sum can be odd). Hence, the hasGreaterThanTwoC flag (which is set if any a_i >=3*M) allows for this.\n\nSimilarly, for vertical stripes (columns), each color contributes a_i/N columns (each column is N cells). But the color must have a_i >=2*N. Then, the sum of columns must be >= M (the total columns needed). And for that, if M is even, or there's a color with a_i >=3*N.\n\nSo in the existing code:\n\nFor the C case (horizontal stripes):\n\nif a_i >=2*M (so can cover two rows), then add a_i/M to C. Because each row is M cells. So a_i/M is the number of rows that can be covered. But since each stripe is two rows, but the code is just summing all possible rows covered by the a_i's.\n\nWait, but this approach may be incorrect. Because if you have a_i=3*M, then a_i/M is 3 rows. Which would contribute 3 rows. But how are these rows arranged? For example, if the total required rows is 5, and you have a_i=3*M, then you can arrange three rows as one stripe (three rows) and two rows as another stripe (two rows), making 5 total. But in this case, the three-row stripe would have cells that have three same-colored neighbors. Because in a three-row stripe, each cell in the middle row has up and down neighbors same color. The left and right (same row) are same color. So four neighbors same color. For the top and bottom rows (since the grid is toroidal), their neighbors would be same color. So this works.\n\nBut how does the code check for this? The code's check is:\n\nC >=N (sum of rows covered is >= N) and (hasGreaterThanTwoC (any a_i >=3*M) OR N is even).\n\nWait, why N is even? Because if N is even, then all stripes can be two rows each, and the sum C must be >=N. For example, if N is 4, then two stripes of two rows each. Each stripe requires 2*M cells. So C must be >=4 (sum of 2+2). But the code's check is C >=N (4) and N is even. Which works.\n\nBut if N is 5 (odd), then C must be >=5. So sum of rows covered must be >=5. But to form 5 rows, you can have two stripes of two rows (sum 4) and one stripe of one row? No, that's not possible. Wait, no. Because each stripe must be at least two rows, or three? Or perhaps the code's logic is that if any a_i can contribute three rows (like 3*M), then that allows you to have a stripe of three rows, which when combined with others (two rows each) can sum to an odd N. For example, N=5: 3 + 2 =5. So sum of C must be >=5, and there must be at least one a_i that can contribute three rows (so that hasGreaterThanTwoC is true).\n\nSo the code's check is:\n\nIf (C >=N) and (N is even OR hasGreaterThanTwoC) \u2192 then possible via horizontal stripes.\n\nSimilarly for vertical stripes: (R >=M) and (M is even OR hasGreaterThanTwoR).\n\nNow, the code's existing code for C (horizontal stripes) is:\n\nfor each a_i:\n\nif (a >=2*M) \u2192 add a/M to C.\n\nif (a >=3*M \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoC to true.\n\nSo for a_i=3*M \u2192 a/M is 3, which adds 3 to C. And sets hasGreaterThanTwoC.\n\nBut for a_i=2*M \u2192 a/M is 2 \u2192 adds 2 to C. So sum C would be 2 for this a_i.\n\nNow, the code's missing part is the code for R (vertical stripes). The code is missing the code inside the if (a >=2*N) block.\n\nSo, for vertical stripes:\n\nif (a_i >=2*N \u2192 then add a/N to R.\n\nAnd if a_i >=3*N \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoR to true.\n\nBecause each vertical stripe (column) requires N cells per column. So two columns \u2192 2*N cells. So if a_i >=2*N \u2192 then a_i/N is 2 \u2192 adds 2 to R (columns covered).\n\nSo, the missing code should be:\n\nR += a / N;\n\nif (a >= 3*N) {\n    hasGreaterThanTwoR = true;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the code's existing code for C, they do:\n\nif (a >=2*M) {\n    C += a/M;\n    if (a >=3*M)\n        hasGreaterThanTwoC = true;\n}\n\nSo for the vertical stripes case (R), the code should do:\n\nif (a >=2*N) {\n    R += a/N;\n    if (a >=3*N)\n        hasGreaterThanTwoR = true;\n}\n\nBut looking at the code, the variables R and C are initialized to zero. So, in the missing code block (for the a >=2*N case), we need to add to R the value of a / N, and check if a is >=3*N to set hasGreaterThanTwoR.\n\nTherefore, the missing code inside the if(a>=2*N) block is:\n\nR += a / N;\nif (a >=3*N)\n    hasGreaterThanTwoR = true;\n\nSo, that's the code that needs to be filled in.\n\nPutting it all together, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read N, M, K.\n\n- For each pigment a_i:\n\n   - if a_i >= 2*N \u2192 add a_i / N to R (columns covered via vertical stripes).\n\n      - if a_i >=3*N \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoR to true.\n\n   - if a_i >=2*M \u2192 add a_i / M to C (rows covered via horizontal stripes).\n\n      - if a_i >=3*M \u2192 set hasGreaterThanTwoC to true.\n\nThen check:\n\nIf (C >= N and (hasGreaterThanTwoC or N is even)) \u2192 possible via horizontal stripes.\n\nOR \n\nIf (R >= M and (hasGreaterThanTwoR or M is even)) \u2192 possible via vertical stripes.\n\nIf either is true, output Yes, else No.\n\nBut wait, the code's final condition is:\n\n((C>=N) && (hasGreaterThanTwoC || N%2 ==0)) || ((R>=M) && (hasGreaterThanTwoR || M%2 ==0 )).\n\nSo, for example, for horizontal stripes:\n\nC is the sum of rows covered (each row is M cells). We need C >= N (total rows required). But how can C be >=N?\n\nBecause each a_i >=2*M contributes a_i/M rows. For example, if N is 5, and a pigment has a_i=3*M, then C +=3. If another has a_i=2*M, C +=2. Then C=5, which equals N. So sum is 5. Now, since N is 5 (odd), we need hasGreaterThanTwoC (from the 3*M a_i) to be true. So in this case, the check passes.\n\nBut how is C the sum of rows? Because each row requires M cells. So for a_i=3*M, a_i/M is 3, which is three rows. So if you have three rows, that's 3*M cells. So if you have a stripe of three rows (3*M cells), each cell in those rows will be same color. Then, each cell in those rows has up and down neighbors same color (since the stripe is three rows, and toroidal, the rows are contiguous). Left and right neighbors are same color (same row). So each cell has four same-colored neighbors, which meets the condition.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the part that handles the a_i >=2*N case by adding a_i / N to R and checking if a_i >=3*N to set hasGreaterThanTwoR.\n\nSo the code that's missing is:\n\nR += a / N;\nif (a >=3*N)\n    hasGreaterThanTwoR = true;\n\nThat's the code to be filled into the missing part."
