Wait, the array a has elements from 0 to n-1. So if index2 is >=n, then a[index2] is undefined. So in the else block, we need to handle the case where the sum is from index1 to n-1. For example, if x is 5, and y is 3. Then n -x could be something like 0 (if n is 5), then index2 is 0+3=3. If n is 5, index2 is 3 which is valid. So sum is a[0] - a[3]. Which is sum of 0,1,2 elements. But if x is 3 and y is 3 (so y=x), then index1 is n-3. index2 is n-3 +3 =n. So when n=3, index1 is 0, index2 is 3, which is out of bounds. Then the sum is a[index1] (sum of elements 0,1,2) minus a[3], but since a[3] is out of bounds, which would be zero. So in that case, the sum is a[index1]. So the code's else clause should output a[index1], because the sum is from index1 to the end (since y is x). So when index2 >=n, which means index1 + y > =n. Then index1 + y -1 >=n-1. So the sum is all elements from index1 to n-1. Which is a[index1]. So the else clause should output a[index1]. Wait, but in the code, when index2 is >=n, then the code's else block is executed. So in that case, the correct sum is a[index1] - 0 (since a[index2] is beyond the array, which is considered as 0). So the code should output a[index1] in that case. So the missing code in the else block is to output a[index1]. Let's check the sample input. For example, in the third sample input:\n\nThe third query is x=5 and y=3, but n=5. So the array is sorted as [1,2,3,5,5]. Then after processing the sum array:\n\nsum starts at 0. i=4 (a[4] is 5): sum +=5 \u2192 sum=5 \u2192 a[4]=5. i=3 (a[3] is 5): sum +=5 \u2192 sum=10 \u2192 a[3]=10.\n\ni=2 (a[2] is3): sum +=3 \u2192 sum=13 \u2192 a[2]=13.\n\ni=1 (a[1] is2): sum +=2 \u2192 sum=15 \u2192 a[1]=15. i=0 (a[0] is1): sum +=1 \u2192 sum=16 \u2192 a[0]=16. So the a array is [16,15,13,10,5]. In the third query, x=5 (buy all 5 items), y=3. So index1 =n -x=5-5=0. index2=0+3=3. So a[0] -a[3] is 16 -10=6, which matches the sample output. So that works. Another example: the first query in the sample. Let's say after processing. The array is sorted as [3,5,5], but wait the sample's first query is x=3 and y=2. Let me check. Wait the sample input isn't given here. The note says in the first query, the items are 5,3,5. Wait, perhaps the initial array is [5,3,5], then after sorting it's [3,5,5]. Then the sum array is:\n\ni=2: sum=5 \u2192 a[2]=5.\n\ni=1: sum=5+5=10 \u2192 a[1]=10.\n\ni=0: sum=10+3=13 \u2192 a[0]=13. So for x=3, bought=3, index1=3-3=0. y=2. index2=0+2=2. a[0] -a[2] =13-5=8, which matches the note. So the code works here. Another case: when x=2 and y=1. So index1 =n-2=1 (assuming n=3). index2=1+1=2. a[1] -a[2] =10-5=5. Which is correct as per the second sample note. So the code works when index2 is within bounds. Now, when index2 is out of bounds, like in the third sample when x=3 and y=3. Then index1 =n-3=0 (if n=3), index2=0+3=3 >=n. So code enters else. Then output a[index1], which is 13. But wait, what's the sum of the first 3 elements of the subset. The subset is 0,1,2 (all elements). The sum is 3+5+5=13. So correct. So in the else clause, the correct output is a[index1]. So the missing code is to output a[index1]. So the code should have:\n\nelse {\n    cout << a[index1] << endl;\n}\n\nYes. So that's the missing part.",

But those x elements are sorted, so the cheapest y among them are the first y elements in that subset. Wait, no. Let's think: the array is sorted ascending. So the last x elements are the largest. When you select those x elements, the y cheapest among them are the first y of those x (since the subset is sorted). So the sum of the y cheapest in the x selected is the sum of the first y elements in the sorted subset. But the entire array is sorted.

So after this loop, the array a becomes [sum of all elements, sum of a[1]+a[2], sum of a[2]]. So a[i] is the sum from a[i] to a[n-1]. Wait no, because when i is processed in reverse order. So a[i] after this loop holds the sum of a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[n-1]. Wait no, let's see. For example, after i=2 is processed, sum is a[2], and a[2] is sum. Then i=1: sum += a[1], so sum is a[2] + a[1]. Then a[1] is set to sum. Then i=0: sum += a[0], sum becomes a[2] + a[1] + a[0]. Then a[0] is set to that sum. So a[i] is the sum from a[i] to a[n-1]. So the array after this loop is a prefix sum from the end. So a[i] is the sum of all elements from i to the end. \n\nNow, when processing a query (x, y), the code calculates index1 as n - bought. So bought is x. So index1 is n - x. Then index2 is index1 + cheap (cheap is y). So the code checks if index2 is within bounds. If so, output a[index1] - a[index2]. Else, do something else. \n\nWait, because a[index1] is the sum from index1 to the end. But a[index1] - a[index2] would be sum from index1 to index2 -1. Because sum from index1 to index2-1 is (sum from index1 to end) - (sum from index2 to end) = a[index1] - a[index2]. So in the example where the selected elements are from index1 to n-1 (x elements), the sum of the first y elements in this subset (since they are sorted in ascending order) is the sum of the first y elements. Since the subset is sorted (as the original array is sorted), the first y elements are the cheapest. So their sum is sum from index1 to index1 + y -1. So the code's approach is to compute that sum by using the prefix sum array. But wait, index1 is n -x. So the subset starts at index1. The first y elements are from index1 to index1 + y -1. So the sum would be a[index1] (sum from index1 to end) minus a[index1 + y] (sum from index1 + y to end). So a[index1] - a[index1 + y] would be the sum of elements from index1 to index1 + y -1. \n\nBut in the code, index2 is index1 + y. So a[index1] - a[index2] is the sum of elements from index1 to index2-1. Which is exactly the sum of the first y elements in the selected x elements. So this is correct. \n\nBut what happens if index2 is >=n? For example, when index1 + y >=n. Then index2 is out of bounds. So in that case, the sum would be from index1 to n-1. Which is the sum of all x elements, but when y is larger than x? Wait, no. Because in the problem statement, y is <= x. So in the code, when the query is (x, y), y is <=x. So when x elements are selected, y is at most x. So in the selected x elements, the first y elements are the y cheapest. So index1 is n -x. The sum is from index1 to index1 + y -1. The code's logic is that index2 is index1 + y. So if index1 + y exceeds n-1, then a[index2] is not present. So in that case, the sum is from index1 to n-1. Because index1 + y -1 would be n-1 when index1 + y >=n. So in this case, the sum is a[index1] - 0 (since a[index2] is beyond the array, which is sum from index1 to n-1). \n\nWait, the array a has elements from 0 to n-1. So if index2 is >=n, then a[index2] is undefined. So in the else block, we need to handle the case where the sum is from index1 to n-1. For example, if x is 5, and y is 3. Then n -x could be something like 0 (if n is 5), then index2 is 0+3=3. If n is 5, index2 is 3 which is valid. So sum is a[0] - a[3]. Which is sum of 0,1,2 elements. But if x is 3 and y is 3 (so y=x), then index1 is n-3. index2 is n-3 +3 =n. So when n=3, index1 is 0, index2 is 3, which is out of bounds. Then the sum is a[index1] (sum of elements 0,1,2) minus a[3], but since a[3] is out of bounds, which would be zero. So in that case, the sum is a[index1]. \n\nSo the code's else clause should output a[index1], because the sum is from index1 to the end (since y is x). So when index2 >=n, which means index1 + y >=n. Then index1 + y -1 >=n-1. So the sum is all elements from index1 to n-1. Which is a[index1]. So the else clause should output a[index1]. \n\nWait, but in the code, when index2 is >=n, then the code's else block is executed. So in that case, the correct sum is a[index1] - 0 (since a[index2] is beyond the array, which is considered as 0). So the code should output a[index1] in that case. \n\nSo the missing code in the else block is to output a[index1]. \n\nLet's check the sample input. For example, in the third sample input:\n\nThe third query is x=5 and y=3, but n=5. So the array is sorted as [1,2,3,5,5]. Then after processing the sum array:\n\nsum starts at 0. i=4 (a[4] is 5): sum +=5 \u2192 sum=5 \u2192 a[4]=5.\n\ni=3 (a[3] is 5): sum +=5 \u2192 sum=10 \u2192 a[3]=10.\n\ni=2 (a[2] is3): sum +=3 \u2192 sum=13 \u2192 a[2]=13.\n\ni=1 (a[1] is2): sum +=2 \u2192 sum=15 \u2192 a[1]=15.\n\ni=0 (a[0] is1): sum +=1 \u2192 sum=16 \u2192 a[0]=16.\n\nSo the a array is [16,15,13,10,5].\n\nIn the third query, x=5 (buy all 5 items), y=3. So index1 =n -x=5-5=0. index2=0+3=3. So a[0] -a[3] is 16 -10=6, which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nAnother example: the first query in the sample. Let's say after processing. The array is sorted as [3,5,5], but wait the sample's first query is x=3 and y=2. Let me check.\n\nWait the sample input isn't given here. The note says in the first query, the items are 5,3,5. Wait, perhaps the initial array is [5,3,5], then after sorting it's [3,5,5]. Then the sum array is:\n\ni=2: sum=5 \u2192 a[2]=5.\n\ni=1: sum=5+5=10 \u2192 a[1]=10.\n\ni=0: sum=10+3=13 \u2192 a[0]=13.\n\nSo for x=3, bought=3, index1=3-3=0. y=2. index2=0+2=2. a[0] -a[2] =13-5=8, which matches the note. So the code works here.\n\nAnother case: when x=2 and y=1. So index1 =n-2=1 (assuming n=3). index2=1+1=2. a[1] -a[2] =10-5=5. Which is correct as per the second sample note.\n\nSo the code works when index2 is within bounds. Now, when index2 is out of bounds, like in the third sample when x=3 and y=3. Then index1 =n-3=0 (if n=3), index2=0+3=3 >=n. So code enters else. Then output a[index1], which is 13. But wait, what's the sum of the first 3 elements of the subset. The subset is 0,1,2 (all elements). The sum is 3+5+5=13. So correct.\n\nSo in the else clause, the correct output is a[index1]. So the missing code is to output a[index1]. \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nelse {\n    cout << a[index1] << endl;\n}\n\nYes. So that's the missing part."
