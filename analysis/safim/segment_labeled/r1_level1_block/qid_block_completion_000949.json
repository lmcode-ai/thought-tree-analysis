So 1 << i would be an int, which for i up to 30 would be 2^30, which is okay as an int. But when i is 30, 1 << 30 is 1073741824, which fits in an int. But when we shift for a long, maybe we need to use 1L << i to prevent overflow beyond 31 bits. Because in Java, 1 << i when i is 30 is okay as an integer. But when we perform a bitwise AND with a long (a[m] is a long), the left-hand side (1 << i) would be promoted to long. Wait, but 1 is an int, so 1 << i is an int. So for i=30, it's 2^30, which is within int's range (since 2^31-1 is the max int). But when we do (a[m] & (1 << i)), since a[m] is a long, the 1 << i is promoted to long. So for i=30, (1 << i) as int is 1073741824, which when cast to long is 0x40000000, which is correct.\n\nWait, but when i is 30, 1 << i is an int. So 1 << 30 is 2^30. But when you cast that to a long, it's okay. So (a[m] & (1 << i)) would work for bits up to 30. Wait, but 1 << i is an int, and when you do a bitwise AND with a long, the int is promoted to a long. So yes, (1 << i) is correct. But wait, for i up to 30, 1 << i is up to 2^30, which is 1,073,741,824. So as an int, it's correct. But if i was 31, then (1 << 31) would be a negative int (as int is signed 32 bits). But in this problem, the bits are up to 30, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that a_i can be up to 2^31, which is 2^31 is 2147483648. So the maximum a_i is 2^31-1, which is 31 bits. Wait, the input says a_i < 2^31. So the bits needed are from 0 to 30, inclusive. So i ranges from 0 to 30, which is correct.\n\nBut in Java, when you do 1 << i where i is 30, you get 2^30, which is 1073741824. So (a[m] & (1 << i)) will check if the (i+1)-th bit is set? Wait, no. Because 1 << 0 is 1 (bit 0), 1 << 1 is 2 (bit 1), etc. So yes, for each i from 0 to 30, (1 << i) is the mask for the i-th bit.\n\nWait, but a[m] is a long. So for example, if a[m] is a long with the 30th bit set, then (a[m] & (1 << 30)) would be non-zero. But 1 << 30 is an int (since 1 is an int). But when you perform the AND operation with a long, the 1 << 30 is promoted to a long. So the mask is correct. So the code (a[m] & (1 << i)) != 0 would correctly check if the i-th bit is set in a[m].\n\nWait, but when i is 30, (1 << 30) is an int. For example, (1 << 30) as an int is 0x40000000. But when you cast that to a long, it's 0x0000000040000000. So when you AND with a long, which a[m] is, then the mask is correct for the i-th bit. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps using 1L << i would be better. Because 1L is a long, so shifting left by i (up to 30) would give the correct mask. For example, when i is 30, 1L <<30 is 1073741824, which is the same as (1<<30) as an int. But when you cast it to a long, maybe it's the same. But in Java, when you do (a[m] & (1 << i)), since a[m] is a long, the (1 << i) is promoted to a long. So for i up to 30, it's correct.\n\nBut if the code was written with i up to 31, then using (1 << i) would be problematic because 1 << 31 is a negative int (as an int). But in this problem, i is up to 30, so no problem.\n\nSo the missing code inside the inner loop (for m) is to check if the i-th bit is set in a[m], and increment b[i] accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nif ((a[m] & (1 << i)) != 0) {\n    b[i]++;\n}\n\nWait, but in Java, the bitwise AND between a long and an int (as (1<<i) is an int) would automatically promote the int to a long. So (a[m] & (1 << i)) would be correct. For example, if a[m] is 3 (long), then (3 & (1 << 1)) is 3 & 2 = 2, which is correct. So the code would correctly count the bits.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because the code uses a loop for i from 0 to 30 (the loop is for(i=0; i<=30; i++)). So for each i (bit position from 0 to 30), we check how many elements have that bit set.\n\nSo the code inside the inner loop should be checking the i-th bit of a[m]. So the line is:\n\nif ( (a[m] & (1L << i)) != 0 )\n\nWait, but here, the 1L << i would give the mask for the i-th bit as a long. For example, 1 << i is okay for i up to 30. But if we use 1L, then even for i=30, it's 1L <<30, which is 2^30. So perhaps the correct code is to use 1L <<i to avoid any issues with integer promotion.\n\nWait, but in Java, the left-hand operand's type determines the shift. For example, 1 << 30 is an int. But 1L << 30 is a long. So, in the code, if we do (a[m] & (1 << i)), then since a[m] is a long, the (1 << i) is promoted to a long. But if i is 30, then (1 << i) is 1<<30, which is 0x40000000 as an int. When promoted to a long, it's 0x0000000040000000. Which is correct. However, if the code uses (1L << i), then it's the same result. So which is correct here?\n\nWait, the code defines a as a long array. So each a[m] is a long. So to check if the i-th bit is set, the mask should be (1L << i). Because, for example, if i is 30, then 1L <<30 is correct. If you use 1 <<i, which is an int, and then promoted to a long, that's the same as (1L <<i) when i <=30, because 1 <<30 as an int is 1073741824, which when cast to a long is 1073741824L, which is equal to 1L <<30.\n\nWait, 1 <<30 is the same as 1L <<30? Let's see: 1 <<30 is 0x40000000 (as an int, but in two's complement that's 1073741824). When cast to a long, it's 0x0000000040000000. 1L <<30 is 0x40000000L. So yes, they are the same. So using 1 <<i is the same as 1L <<i for i up to 30. So the code can be written either way.\n\nBut in Java, the code (a[m] & (1 <<i)) when a[m] is a long would be a long. So the bitwise AND is correct.\n\nSo the code inside the inner loop is:\n\nif ( (a[m] & (1 << i)) != 0 ) {\n    b[i]++;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the code, the array a is of type long[]. So a[m] is a long. So (1 << i) is an int. When you perform a[m] & (1 << i), the (1<<i) is promoted to a long. So for example, if i is 30, (1<<30) is 1073741824, which as a long is 0x40000000. So the bitwise AND will correctly check if the i-th bit is set in a[m]. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, when i is 30, the bit being checked is the 30th bit (since bits are 0-indexed). Which is correct.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nfor each element m in the array a, check if the i-th bit is set. If yes, increment b[i] by 1.\n\nSo the code inside the loop for m is:\n\nif ((a[m] & (1 << i)) != 0) {\n    b[i]++;\n}\n\nBut wait, in Java, 1 is an integer, and shifting left by i (up to 30) gives an integer. So 1 <<i is okay.\n\nBut perhaps the code should use 1L <<i to handle all bits correctly. Let me think. Let's say i is 30. Then 1 <<30 is 1073741824 (as an int). When promoted to a long, it's 0x0000000040000000. So the mask is correct for the 30th bit. So yes, it's the same as 1L <<30. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the correct code is to check if a[m] has the i-th bit set. So the line inside the inner loop is:\n\nif ((a[m] & (1 << i)) != 0) {\n    b[i]++;\n}\n\nBut wait, in Java, the bitwise operators have precedence. So (a[m] & (1 <<i)) != 0 is equivalent to (a[m] & (1 <<i)) !=0. Which is correct. So the code is okay.\n\nBut wait, in Java, the & operator has lower precedence than !=. So the expression is evaluated as (a[m] & ( (1<<i) )) !=0. So it's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the code inside the loop for m is:\n\nfor(m=0; m <n; m++) {\n    if ((a[m] & (1 << i)) !=0) {\n        b[i]++;\n    }\n}\n\nSo that's the code to fill in the missing part.\n\nBut looking at the code structure in the given Java code:\n\n            for(i=0;i<=30;i++){\n                for(m=0;m<n;m++){\n                    /* TODO: Your code here */\n                }\n            }\n\nSo inside the m loop, for each element, check if the current bit i is set in a[m], and increment b[i] if so.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif ((a[m] & (1L << i)) != 0) b[i]++;\n\nWait, but wait: 1 << i is an integer. When i is 30, 1 <<30 is an integer. But when you do a bitwise AND with a long (a[m] is a long), then the integer is promoted to long. So, for example, if a[m] is a long with bit 30 set, then (a[m] & (1 <<30)) would be (a[m] & 1073741824), which as a long is 1073741824, which is non-zero. So the condition would be true.\n\nBut using 1L << i might be more correct. Because for example, if the code is written as (1 <<i), then when i is 31, the value would be incorrect. But here, i runs from 0 to 30, so 1 <<i is correct. So either way is correct. But perhaps in Java, using (1L <<i) is better practice when dealing with long values. Because 1 <<i is an int, but 1L <<i is a long. So in this code, since a[m] is a long, using 1L <<i would avoid possible sign extension issues when i is 31, but since i is up to 30, it's not a problem here.\n\nBut since the code's loop for i is up to 30, using (1 <<i) is correct. However, the code uses a long array, so perhaps using 1L <<i is better to avoid any potential issues. For example, in Java, when you shift an int (1) by 31, it becomes 0x80000000 (as an int), which is -2^31. When promoted to a long, it's 0xFFFFFFFF80000000. So if i were 31, using 1 <<i would give a mask with the 31st bit set, but the higher bits would be 1s (since it's a negative int). But since i only goes up to 30, this isn't a problem here.\n\nSo the code can be written with (1 <<i) or (1L <<i). But which is correct?\n\nLet me see: a[m] is a long. For example, suppose a[m] is 2^30. Then, 1<<30 is 2^30 (as an int, 1073741824), which when cast to a long is 1073741824. So (a[m] & (1 <<30)) would be 1073741824, which is non-zero, so the condition is true. That's correct.\n\nIf we use 1L <<i, then for i=30, the mask is the same. So either way, the code works. So both are correct. But perhaps the problem is that (1 <<i) is an int, and when i is 30, it's a positive integer, but when promoted to a long, it's still correct. So the code would work.\n\nBut in the given code, the array a is long[]. So a[m] is a long. So when we do (a[m] & (1 <<i)), the (1 <<i) is promoted to long, but since i is up to 30, it's 2^30, which fits in an int and is positive. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n\nif ((a[m] & (1 << i)) != 0) b[i]++;\n\nBut in Java, the code would be written as:\n\nif ( (a[m] & (1 << i) ) != 0 )\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code that's missing. So inside the for loop over m, for each m, check if the current a[m] has the i-th bit set, and increment b[i] if yes.\n\nSo the code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nif ((a[m] & (1 << i)) != 0) b[i]++;"
