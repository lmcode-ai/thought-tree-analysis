The code given is in C++ (well, actually, the code uses scanf and printf, so maybe it's C, but the question says to complete it as C++). Hmm.\n\nLooking at the code structure: There's an array arr of size 200001 initialized to zero. For each test case, they read n elements, incrementing the count in arr for each element. Then, after processing all elements, they reset the array and print the result.\n\nThe missing part is where the condition arr[a] >=3 is checked. The TODO is inside that if block. So what's supposed to happen here?\n\nThe current code sets result to -1 at the start of each test case. When during processing an element, its count reaches three or more, we need to set result to that element. But wait, because the loop is processing elements one by one. Suppose during the processing of an element, the count reaches three. Then we can immediately set result to a. But since the problem allows any such element to be printed, maybe we can just set it once and ignore subsequent elements. However, there's a problem here: what if the array has multiple elements that reach three counts? For example, maybe the first occurrence of a third count is not the one we should pick, but the code might overwrite the result with a later one.\n\nWait, but the problem says to print any such value. So the first occurrence of a value that has three counts can be stored as the result, and even if later elements have counts >=3, we can just ignore them since we need to output any one.\n\nBut in the current code, during the processing of each element, when arr[a] increments to 3, we set the result. But if multiple elements reach three, the result will be set to the last one that triggers the condition. However, the problem says to output any one, so this is acceptable. However, the code has a loop that reads all elements, and during each read, if the count hits three or more, it's updating the result. But once the result is set to a value, subsequent elements could overwrite it. For example, if two different elements reach three counts, the result will be the last one processed. But the problem allows any, so this is okay.\n\nBut wait, in the loop for n elements, each time when a is read, the count is incremented, then checked. So for example, if an element appears three times, when the third occurrence is processed, arr[a] becomes 3, so the if condition is triggered, and result is set to a. If that element appears again, say a fourth time, the count becomes 4, which is >=3, so the result would be set to a again. But that's redundant. But the problem only requires that any of the values that have at least three occurrences is printed. So as long as result is set to any such value, it's okay.\n\nBut there's a problem here. Suppose during the processing of elements, multiple elements reach three counts. The code will set result to the latest one. But when the loop is done, the result is printed. So even if there are multiple valid elements, the code will output the last one that triggered the >=3 condition. But the problem allows any. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if a value's count increases beyond three? Like, for example, if the third occurrence is processed, result is set. Then the fourth occurrence comes, and the code sets result again. But since result is already set to the correct value, this is redundant but not harmful. However, if another element's count reaches three later, the result will be overwritten. So the code would output the last element that triggered the condition. But again, the problem allows any. So this is okay.\n\nBut the code's current logic has the result variable, which is initialized to -1. As elements are read, whenever any element's count reaches three, result is set to that element. So after processing all elements, the result will be the last element that had its count reach three or more during processing. But in cases where multiple elements meet the condition, the code will output the last one. Which is allowed by the problem statement.\n\nBut there's a problem. Suppose the same element is processed again after the third occurrence. For example, the element is processed three times, result is set. Then a fourth time: the count becomes 4. The if condition is triggered again, and result is set again. But this is unnecessary but harmless. However, in the code, the loop processes all elements. So even if the result is set once, the code might overwrite it with the same value again. But the problem says to output any, so this is okay.\n\nBut what about the case where after processing all elements, some elements have counts >=3, but were not triggered during the loop? For example, an element's count increases from 2 to 3 when processed, but then later another element's count increases to 3. So the result will be the last one. But when the loop is done, the code's result is the last one, which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because during processing, for each element a, after incrementing the count, if the count is >=3, we set result to a. So even if an element is processed multiple times after reaching three, each time the count is incremented, the code checks if it's >=3 and sets result to a. So the result will be the last element in the array that caused the count to reach three. But that's not necessarily the correct answer. Because maybe the element occurs three times, but the code sets result to a even if the count is 4 or higher. But since the problem allows any such element, that's okay.\n\nWait, but the code is supposed to print any value that appears at least three times. So the code's logic is: during processing, whenever a's count reaches three or more, set result to a. So if the array has multiple elements that meet the condition, the result will be the last element that, during processing, had its count incremented to >=3. For example, suppose the array is [1,1,1,2,2,2]. The elements are processed in order. When the third 1 is read, result is set to 1. Then when the third 2 is read, result is set to 2. So the output is 2, which is correct. So yes, the code will output the last element in the array that reaches three or more occurrences during processing.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, that's acceptable. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut the current code has a problem. Let's think about the code's structure. For each test case:\n\n- Initialize result to -1.\n\n- Read n elements.\n\n- For each element a:\n\n   - increment arr[a].\n\n   - if arr[a] >=3, set result to a.\n\n- After processing all elements, reset arr to 0.\n\n- Print result.\n\nBut wait, the code's logic for resetting the array is a loop that sets arr[i] to 0 for all i from 0 to 200000. However, this is O(200001) time for each test case. When t is 1e4, and each test case has small n, this could be O(2e5) for sum of n, but 1e4 * 2e5 is 2e9 operations, which is way too slow. Wait, but the sum of n across test cases is <= 2e5. So for each test case, the code resets the entire array, which is 2e5+1 elements. So for t=1e4, that's 1e4 * 2e5 = 2e9 operations. Which is way too slow for C++ to handle in time. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but the code provided by the user includes this loop:\n\nfor(i=0; i<200001; i++) {\n    arr[i] = 0;\n}\n\nBut this is O(200001) per test case. For t=1e4, that's 2e5 * 1e4 = 2e9 operations. Which is way beyond the time limits. That's a mistake.\n\nSo the original code is incorrect. Because the way of resetting the array is O(200001) per test case, which for 1e4 test cases is 2e5 * 1e4 = 2e9 operations. Which would cause a TLE (time limit exceeded) error.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the sum of n across test cases is <= 2e5. So a better approach would be to, for each test case, track which elements were modified and reset only those. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the elements in the array are up to n (since the problem states that 1 <= a_i <= n for each test case), perhaps during each test case, after processing, we can iterate through all the a_i's and reset their counts. But that's not feasible because we don't store the a_i's.\n\nWait, but the code is processing the elements as they come. So for each test case:\n\nRead n elements. For each element a, we increment arr[a]. So after processing, all the a's that were part of this test case have their counts in arr. So to reset, perhaps we can store all the a's in a temporary array, then after processing, iterate through them and set arr[a] to 0. But that would require O(n) time per test case. Which is acceptable since sum of n is 2e5.\n\nBut the code provided does not do that. Instead, it resets all 2e5+1 elements each test case, which is very slow.\n\nSo this is a bug in the original code, which needs to be fixed. However, the user hasn't mentioned this. But the code given has that loop. So perhaps the user's code is incorrect, but the problem is to fill in the missing code.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code given may have missing lines or blocks. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the way of resetting the array is not. But in that case, the code would not pass the time constraints, but maybe the problem requires us to not fix that part, but only fill in the missing code.\n\nWait, the problem says that the code is to be completed. So perhaps the code given is incomplete in that part. But according to the code given, the missing part is inside the if block when arr[a] >=3.\n\nSo the problem is to fill in the code inside the if block. The rest of the code (like resetting the array) is part of the code, but perhaps it's incorrect. But according to the code provided, the user may have written that code, and the problem is to fill in the missing part. So even if the code has a time complexity problem, that's part of the existing code, and the problem is to complete it.\n\nSo perhaps the original code has a bug in the resetting of the array, leading to TLE, but the problem is not asking us to fix that. So we need to focus on the missing code.\n\nSo back to the problem. The code currently has:\n\nIn the loop that processes each element, when arr[a] >=3, the code inside the if block is missing.\n\nSo the code needs to set result to a. But if the code sets result = a, then for each occurrence of a that makes the count >=3, the result is updated. But the problem allows any such a. So for example, even if there are multiple a's that meet the condition, the code will output the last one that was processed. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo in the if block, the code should set result = a. So the missing line is result = a; ?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that if there is a value that appears at least three times, output any. But the code's logic may not capture all possible values. For example, consider an array where an element appears three times but the third occurrence is early in the array, then another element appears three times. The code would set the result to the second element. So the code's approach is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nSo the missing line is simply result = a;.\n\nBut wait, what if the same element is encountered again after the third occurrence? For example, the third occurrence is processed, result is set. Then the fourth occurrence: arr[a] becomes 4, and the if block is triggered again, setting result to a again. But that's redundant but harmless. The end result is correct.\n\nSo the code for the missing part is: result = a;\n\nBut in the code, after setting result to a, do we need to break out of the loop? Because once a result is found, perhaps we can stop processing further elements. But in the code, the loop continues processing all elements. Which could be inefficient, but the problem allows any output.\n\nWait, but the code needs to process all elements even after finding a candidate, because there may be an element that occurs more than three times. For example, in the fifth test case mentioned in the notes: 1,2,3 all occur three times, but the code will output the last one processed. But according to the problem statement, any of them is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nSo the missing code inside the if block is simply:\n\nresult = a;\n\nBut wait, the code's initial result is -1. So once the if condition is met, it's possible that result is set to a. If there are multiple elements that meet the condition, result is set to the last one processed. Which is correct.\n\nSo the correct code to fill in is to set result to a. But why not check if result is already set (i.e., result != -1) and then maybe skip? Because the problem allows any of them, and the code's current approach is to set result to the last a that triggers the >=3 count. So that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is simply:\n\nresult = a;\n\nSo, in the TODO section, the code should be:\n\nresult = a;\n\nBut wait, looking back at the code's structure, during the processing of each element a, after incrementing arr[a], we check if arr[a] >=3, and if so, set result to a.\n\nBut in some cases, the element a could have been processed multiple times. For example, if a appears 4 times. The third occurrence will set result to a. The fourth occurrence will set it again to a. But that's redundant but correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is simply result = a;.\n\nBut the code's logic is that the result will be overwritten each time a element's count reaches three. But the problem allows any element that meets the condition, so this is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct with that line.\n\nNow, the code after this will reset the array. However, the resetting is O(2e5) per test case, which could be a problem. But according to the problem statement, the code is provided, and the user needs to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code's time is acceptable for the given problem's constraints, but in reality, this code would not pass due to the resetting step's time. But the problem says to complete the code, not to fix existing errors.\n\nTherefore, the correct code to add is:\n\nresult = a;"
