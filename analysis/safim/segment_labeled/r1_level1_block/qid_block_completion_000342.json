Each block has a height of 1 and a length of ceil(i/2) where i is the block's number. Oh right, so the i-th block's length is (i +1 )//2, because ceil(i/2) is the same as integer division of (i+1) by 2. For example, when i is even, like 4, (4+1)/2 is 2.5 floored to 2. Wait, no, wait: ceil(4/2) is 2, which is (4)/2. But for i=5, ceil(5/2) is 3, which is (5+1)/2 = 3. So yes, ceil(i/2) is equal to (i +1)//2 in integer division. So the length of the i-th block is (i+1)//2. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of the lengths of the blocks used is at least s^2, since each block contributes 1 unit in height and some length.

So the optimal way is to take all the blocks, compute their total sum, then find the largest s where sum >= s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n. Then find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S. But also, perhaps there's a smarter way than computing S, especially since n can be up to 1e9. Wait, let's compute the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for S(n). Ceil(i/2) can be written as (i+1)//2 in integer division. So for even i=2k: (2k+1)/2 is k.5, integer division gives k. But ceil(2k/2) is k. So yes. For odd i=2k-1: (2k-1 +1)/2 = 2k/2 =k. Which is correct because ceil((2k-1)/2) is k. So for each i, ceil(i/2) is (i+1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even. So sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2) is equal to: If n is even: sum for i=1 to n of ceil(i/2) is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} [ceil( (2k-1)/2 ) + ceil(2k/2) ) ] Each pair (2k-1, 2k) contributes k + k = 2k. So for even n=2m, the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2 * m(m+1)/2 = m(m+1). So m is n/2. So sum is (n/2)(n/2 +1) = m(m+1). If n is odd: n=2m+1. Then the sum is sum for even part (from 1 to 2m) plus ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1. The sum for even part 2m is m*(m+1). Then add m+1 for the last term. So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m +1) = (m+1)^2. But m = (n-1)/2. So sum is (( (n-1)/2 ) +1 )^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2. Because n is odd, (n-1)/2 is m, so m+1 is (n+1)/2. So putting it all together:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) + (n % 2) ) ) * ( (n//2) + 1 ) Wait, let's see: Wait, when n is even, m = n/2, sum is m(m+1). When n is odd, sum is ( (n+1)/2 )^2. Wait, let's test with small numbers. For n=1: sum is 1. (1+1)/2 = 1. So (1)^2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: sum is 1+1=2. m=1, 1*2=2. Correct. n=3: sum is 1+1+2=4. Which is (3+1)/2)^2 = 2^2=4. Correct. n=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9. Which is (5+1)/2 =3, 3^2=9. Correct. So for n even: sum is (n/2) * (n/2 +1). For n odd: sum is ((n+1)/2)^2.

Sample Input 2: n=5. The sum S is 9. sqrt(9) is 3. So s=3. Which matches the sample output. Another sample: n=6 (even). S = 3 *4 =12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so s=3. So the maximum square is 3x3. Wait, but 3x3 area is 9. But sum is 12, which is more than 9. So yes, possible. Wait, but the problem is to arrange the blocks to form a square of side s. So the sum needs to be >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum. Yes. So the approach is correct. Now, how to compute s given S. But when S is up to (1e9 / 2 + 1) * (1e9 / 2) ), which for even n=1e9 is (5e8) * (5e8 +1) ~ 2.5e17. For sqrt(2.5e17) is about 5e8. So s can be up to around 5e8, which is manageable with binary search. But even better, perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute s directly from n.\n\nWait, but let's think: for even n=2m.\n\nS = m*(m+1). Then s is floor(sqrt(m*(m+1))). But m*(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. So sqrt(m\u00b2 + m) is between m and m+1. So s is m.\n\nWait, for example: m=3. m(m+1) =12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. floor is 3. Which is m.\n\nSimilarly, m=1: 1*2=2. sqrt(2) ~1.414. s=1. So for even n, s is floor(sqrt(S)) = floor( sqrt(m(m+1)) ), which is m.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because m(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor of that is m. So for even n, s = m = n/2. Wait, but let's check with n=6 (m=3). S=3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes, correct. Another example: n=4 (m=2). S=2*3=6. s=2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6. Correct. So for even n, s is m = n/2. Wait, that's a possible conclusion. Then, for even n, the maximum s is m = n/2. But wait, let's see for n=2. m=1, S=1*2=2. s=1. 1\u00b2=1 <=2. Correct. So for even n, s is m =n/2. For odd n, S= m\u00b2, where m = (n+1)/2. So sqrt(S) is m. So s is m.\n\nWait, but n=5: m=(5+1)/2=3. S=9. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. Correct.\n\nn=3: m=2. S=4. sqrt(4)=2. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=1: m=1. S=1. s=1. Correct. n=7: m=4. S=16. s=4. Correct. So for both even and odd cases:\n\nIf n is even: s = n/2. If n is odd: s = (n+1)/2. Wait, wait, wait. Wait for even n, we have S= m*(m+1), where m= n/2. Then sqrt(S) is between m and m+1. So floor is m. So s is m. But in that case, s^2 is m\u00b2. But S is m*(m+1) which is larger than m\u00b2. So s is m.\n\nBut wait, the maximum s is m. For example, when S= m*(m+1), then s can be m. Because m\u00b2 <= m*(m+1) < (m+1)^2. Yes. So s is m.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n, s is m = (n+1)/2, because S = m\u00b2. So s is m. So the formula for s is:\n\ns = (n//2) + (n % 2) Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n, n//2 is m. n%2 is 0. So s = m.\n\nFor odd n, n//2 is (n-1)/2. n%2 is 1. So s = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2. Which matches. So the formula can be written as s = (n +1) // 2. Wait, wait:\n\nFor even n: (n +1)//2. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 floored to 2. Which is correct. n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 floored to 1. Correct. For odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Correct. n=3: (3+1)/2=2. Correct. So yes, s can be written as (n +1) // 2. Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that for even n, s is m =n/2, which is equal to (n+1)//2. Wait for even n=6: (6+1)//2 = 3.5 floored to 3. Which is n/2=3. So yes. So regardless of parity, s is (n+1)//2. Wait, but this can't be right. For example, in even n=6, S=3*4=12. s is floor(sqrt(12))=3, which is (6+1)/2=3.5 floored to 3. So yes, (n+1)//2 gives 3. For n=5, (5+1)//2=3. Which is correct. So regardless of n even or odd, s is (n+1)//2. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier case where for even n, S= m*(m+1) =n/2*(n/2 +1). So for even n=2, m=1, S=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, floor is 1. Which is (2+1)//2=1.5 floored to 1. Correct. But wait, this formula gives s as (n+1)//2. Let's test with n=4. (4+1)//2=2.5 floored to 2. Correct, as S=2*3=6, s=2. So for even n, s is (n//2). For odd n, s is (n+1)/2. But (n+1)//2 is (n//2) + (n%2). So for even n, n%2 is 0, so (n//2) +0 =n//2. For odd n, n%2 is 1, so (n//2) +1 = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2. So yes, (n+1)//2 is equivalent to s = (n//2) + (n%2). But how does this formula hold with the sum S? Wait, for even n=2m: sum S = m(m+1). s is m. So s\u00b2 = m\u00b2. But sum is m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m >= m\u00b2. So s is m. But (n+1)//2 = (2m +1)//2= m. So yes. So the formula s= (n+1)//2 seems to hold. But wait, let's take even n=6: s=3. sum S=3*4=12. s^2=9. 9 <=12. But can we make a square of 3x3. But the sum is 12, which is larger than 9. So yes. But what about a square of s=3. Then sum is >=9. So yes. But wait, how is this possible? Because for even n, s is m =n/2. But sum is m(m+1), which is larger than m\u00b2. So why can't we have a square of side s= m.",

But for even numbers, n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5, but integer division would be 3. Yes. But why? Because in C++, when you do (n +1)/2 for integers, it's integer division. For even n=6: (6+1) is 7, divided by 2 is 3. So (7)/2=3. For odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Yes. So the code is correct. But wait, the code must handle n up to 1e9. So using integers is okay. So the solution is simply to output (n+1)//2. Thus, the code is straightforward.

So the code inside solve() is:\n\nlong long n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl;\n\nBut wait, since the problem allows up to n=1e9, and t up to 1e4, we need to use appropriate data types. In C++, using int would overflow for n=1e9. So n should be read as long long. But in the code, the original code has:\n\nvoid solve()\n{\n\t/* TODO: Your code here */\n\t\n} So the code inside solve() should read a long long n, compute (n+1)/2, and output it. So the correct code is:\n\nvoid solve() {\n    long long n;\n    cin >> n;\n    cout << (n + 1) / 2 << '\\n';\n} But wait, in the sample input 2, n=5 gives 3. Correct. Another test case: n=4. (4+1)/2=2.5, but integer division gives 2. Which is correct. Yes. So the missing code is this.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be made using n blocks. Each block has a height of 1 and a length of ceil(i/2) where i is the block's number. Oh right, so the i-th block's length is (i +1 )//2, because ceil(i/2) is the same as integer division of (i+1) by 2. For example, when i is even, like 4, (4+1)/2 is 2.5 floored to 2. Wait, no, wait: ceil(4/2) is 2, which is (4)/2. But for i=5, ceil(5/2) is 3, which is (5+1)/2 = 3. So yes, ceil(i/2) is equal to (i +1)//2 in integer division. So the length of the i-th block is (i+1)//2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of the lengths of the blocks used is at least s^2, since each block contributes 1 unit in height and some length. Because the square's area is s^2, and each block contributes (length) units of area. So the total sum of lengths must be >= s^2. Wait, because each block is 1 unit high, so when arranged, each contributes their length as area. So the total area of all selected blocks must be at least s^2, and we can arrange them in such a way that their total area covers the s x s square. But since the blocks are 1 unit high, you can stack them vertically. Wait, maybe the problem is that each block's height is 1, so when arranged horizontally, the total height of the square is s, which requires that each column has s blocks. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the blocks can't be rotated. So each block is placed horizontally. Then, the height of the square is 1, and the length would be the sum of the lengths of the blocks. But that would make a rectangle of 1 x sum, which is not a square. Hmm, so that can't be right. So perhaps the problem is about arranging the blocks vertically? Wait, the problem says you can't rotate them. So each block is placed such that its height is 1 (so vertical dimension is 1), and the length is in the horizontal direction. So to make a square of side s, the total area of the blocks used must be at least s^2. Because each block's area is 1 * length, so sum of lengths is the total area. So the maximum s is the largest integer where sum of selected blocks' lengths >= s\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem is to select a subset of blocks such that the sum of their lengths is at least s\u00b2, and find the maximum possible s.\n\nSo the key is to compute the maximum s for which the sum of the first k blocks (for some k) is >= s\u00b2, and we need the maximum s possible given the blocks up to n.\n\nWait, but which blocks to select? Because the blocks have varying lengths. The sum of the lengths of all n blocks would be sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Then the maximum s is the largest integer s where this sum is >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, because if we can select any subset of the blocks, but to maximize s, we should take as many as possible. Because the sum of all possible blocks gives the maximum possible sum, so that would allow the largest s. Because adding more blocks (with longer lengths) can only increase the sum. So the optimal way is to take all the blocks, compute their total sum, then find the largest s where sum >= s\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n. Then find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S. But also, perhaps there's a smarter way than computing S, especially since n can be up to 1e9.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for S(n).\n\nCeil(i/2) can be written as (i+1)//2 in integer division. So for even i=2k: (2k+1)/2 is k.5, integer division gives k. But ceil(2k/2) is k. So yes. For odd i=2k-1: (2k-1 +1)/2 = 2k/2 =k. Which is correct because ceil((2k-1)/2) is k.\n\nSo for each i, ceil(i/2) is (i+1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even.\n\nSo sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2) is equal to:\n\nIf n is even: sum for i=1 to n of ceil(i/2) is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} [ceil( (2k-1)/2 ) + ceil(2k/2) ) ] \n\nEach pair (2k-1, 2k) contributes k + k = 2k. So for even n=2m, the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2 * m(m+1)/2 = m(m+1). So m is n/2. So sum is (n/2)(n/2 +1) = m(m+1).\n\nIf n is odd: n=2m+1. Then the sum is sum for even part (from 1 to 2m) plus ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1.\n\nThe sum for even part 2m is m*(m+1). Then add m+1 for the last term. So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m +1) = (m+1)^2. But m = (n-1)/2. So sum is (( (n-1)/2 ) +1 )^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2. Because n is odd, (n-1)/2 is m, so m+1 is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) + (n % 2) ) ) * ( (n//2) + 1 )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, when n is even, m = n/2, sum is m(m+1).\n\nWhen n is odd, sum is ( (n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nWait, let's test with small numbers.\n\nFor n=1: sum is 1. (1+1)/2 = 1. So (1)^2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: sum is 1+1=2. m=1, 1*2=2. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum is 1+1+2=4. Which is (3+1)/2)^2 = 2^2=4. Correct.\n\nn=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9. Which is (5+1)/2 =3, 3^2=9. Correct.\n\nSo for n even: sum is (n/2) * (n/2 +1). For n odd: sum is ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo the sum S can be computed as:\n\nif n is even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd: S = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e9, and we need to compute S, then find the largest s where s\u00b2 <= S. Then, the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(S), but perhaps not exactly. For example, if S is 14, then sqrt(14) is ~3.7417, so s is 3. But if S is exactly a square, like 9, then s is 3.\n\nSo the steps for each test case would be:\n\n1. Given n, compute S as the sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\n2. Find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= S.\n\nSo how do we compute s?\n\ns is the floor of the square root of S. But perhaps there's a case where S is between s\u00b2 and (s+1)^2. For example, if S is 10, then s is 3.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: compute S as per n's parity, then compute floor(sqrt(S)).\n\nBut how can we compute S efficiently?\n\nWell, for n even:\n\nn even: m = n/2, S = m*(m+1)\n\nn odd: m = (n+1)/2, S = m*m.\n\nSo for example, when n=5 (odd), m=3, S=9.\n\nSo then, for each n, compute S as:\n\nif n even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n odd: S = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nThen compute s = floor( sqrt(S) )\n\nWait, but wait. Let's take the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: n=5. The sum S is 9. sqrt(9) is 3. So s=3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: n=6 (even). S = 3 *4 =12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so s=3. So the maximum square is 3x3.\n\nWait, but 3x3 area is 9. But sum is 12, which is more than 9. So yes, possible.\n\nWait, but the problem is to arrange the blocks to form a square of side s. So the sum needs to be >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to compute s given S.\n\nBut when S is up to (1e9 / 2 + 1) * (1e9 / 2) ), which for even n=1e9 is (5e8) * (5e8 +1) ~ 2.5e17. For sqrt(2.5e17) is about 5e8. So s can be up to around 5e8, which is manageable with binary search.\n\nBut even better, perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute s directly from n.\n\nWait, but let's think: for even n=2m.\n\nS = m*(m+1). Then s is floor(sqrt(m*(m+1))).\n\nBut m*(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. So sqrt(m\u00b2 + m) is between m and m+1. So s is m.\n\nWait, for example: m=3. m(m+1) =12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. floor is 3. Which is m.\n\nSimilarly, m=1: 1*2=2. sqrt(2) ~1.414. s=1.\n\nSo for even n, s is floor(sqrt(S)) = floor( sqrt(m(m+1)) ), which is m.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nBecause m(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor of that is m.\n\nSo for even n, s = m = n/2.\n\nWait, but let's check with n=6 (m=3). S=3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes, correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4 (m=2). S=2*3=6. s=2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, s is m = n/2.\n\nWait, that's a possible conclusion. Then, for even n, the maximum s is m = n/2.\n\nBut wait, let's see for n=2. m=1, S=1*2=2. s=1. 1\u00b2=1 <=2. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, s is m =n/2.\n\nFor odd n, S= m\u00b2, where m = (n+1)/2. So sqrt(S) is m. So s is m.\n\nWait, but n=5: m=(5+1)/2=3. S=9. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. Correct.\n\nn=3: m=2. S=4. sqrt(4)=2. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=1: m=1. S=1. s=1. Correct.\n\nn=7: m=4. S=16. s=4. Correct.\n\nSo for both even and odd cases:\n\nIf n is even: s = n/2.\n\nIf n is odd: s = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait for even n, we have S= m*(m+1), where m= n/2. Then sqrt(S) is between m and m+1. So floor is m. So s is m.\n\nBut in that case, s^2 is m\u00b2. But S is m*(m+1) which is larger than m\u00b2. So s is m.\n\nBut wait, the maximum s is m. For example, when S= m*(m+1), then s can be m. Because m\u00b2 <= m*(m+1) < (m+1)^2.\n\nYes. So s is m.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n, s is m = (n+1)/2, because S = m\u00b2. So s is m.\n\nSo the formula for s is:\n\ns = (n//2) + (n % 2)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even n, n//2 is m. n%2 is 0. So s = m.\n\nFor odd n, n//2 is (n-1)/2. n%2 is 1. So s = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2. Which matches.\n\nSo the formula can be written as s = (n +1) // 2.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nFor even n: (n +1)//2. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 floored to 2. Which is correct. n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 floored to 1. Correct.\n\nFor odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Correct. n=3: (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nSo yes, s can be written as (n +1) // 2.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggests that for even n, s is m =n/2, which is equal to (n+1)//2.\n\nWait for even n=6: (6+1)//2 = 3.5 floored to 3. Which is n/2=3. So yes.\n\nSo regardless of parity, s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but this can't be right. For example, in even n=6, S=3*4=12. s is floor(sqrt(12))=3, which is (6+1)/2=3.5 floored to 3. So yes, (n+1)//2 gives 3.\n\nFor n=5, (5+1)//2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo regardless of n even or odd, s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier case where for even n, S= m*(m+1) =n/2*(n/2 +1). So for even n=2, m=1, S=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, floor is 1. Which is (2+1)//2=1.5 floored to 1. Correct.\n\nBut wait, this formula gives s as (n+1)//2. Let's test with n=4. (4+1)//2=2.5 floored to 2. Correct, as S=2*3=6, s=2.\n\nSo for even n, s is (n//2). For odd n, s is (n+1)/2. But (n+1)//2 is (n//2) + (n%2). So for even n, n%2 is 0, so (n//2) +0 =n//2. For odd n, n%2 is 1, so (n//2) +1 = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo yes, (n+1)//2 is equivalent to s = (n//2) + (n%2).\n\nBut how does this formula hold with the sum S?\n\nWait, for even n=2m: sum S = m(m+1). s is m. So s\u00b2 = m\u00b2. But sum is m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m >= m\u00b2. So s is m.\n\nBut (n+1)//2 = (2m +1)//2= m. So yes.\n\nSo the formula s= (n+1)//2 seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, let's take even n=6: s=3. sum S=3*4=12. s^2=9. 9 <=12. But can we make a square of 3x3. But the sum is 12, which is larger than 9. So yes. But what about a square of s=3. Then sum is >=9. So yes.\n\nBut wait, how is this possible? Because for even n, s is m =n/2. But sum is m(m+1), which is larger than m\u00b2. So why can't we have a square of side s= m. Well, the answer is that the maximum possible s is m, because even though the sum is larger than m\u00b2, but the next possible s would be m+1, whose square is (m+1)^2. The sum S is m(m+1), which is m\u00b2 +m. So (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 +2m +1. So S is m\u00b2 +m, which is less than m\u00b2 +2m +1. So s can't be m+1. Hence, the maximum is m.\n\nSo in all cases, the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, let's test another example. For n=5: s=3. sum is 9. 3^2=9. So yes. For n=7: (7+1)/2=4. sum is 16. s=4. Correct.\n\nBut let's take n=8. s=(8+1)/2=4.5 floored to 4. sum is 4*5=20. 4\u00b2=16 <=20. But what about s=4? sum is 20. Can we have a square of 4x4? The area needed is 16. Sum is 20 >=16. So yes, but what's the maximum possible s? The next possible s is 5. 5\u00b2=25. 20 <25. So no. So maximum is 4. Which matches (n+1)//2=4.\n\nSo according to this, the answer is simply s = (n+1) // 2.\n\nBut wait, this can't be right. Because for example, when n=3. sum is (3+1)/2=2. So sum is 4. s=2. 2\u00b2=4. So exactly matches. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4. sum is 2*3=6. s=2. sum is 6 >=4. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=6. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9. sum is 12 >=9. But what if sum is 12, which is 3*4. Then, is there a way to arrange blocks to make a 3x3 square? Yes. Because the sum is 12, which is 3*4. But the required area is 9. So even if the sum is more than s\u00b2, it's acceptable. So the formula is correct.\n\nBut why does the maximum s equal (n+1)//2? How is that derived from the sum S?\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor even n=2m: sum S = m(m+1). s is m. Then m(m+1) >= m\u00b2. So s is m.\n\nFor odd n=2m-1: sum S = m\u00b2. Then s is m. Which equals (2m-1 +1)/2 =m.\n\nSo in all cases, s is (n+1)/2 rounded down. Which is (n+1)//2.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is (n+1) // 2.\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because for even n, the sum is m*(m+1), which is >= m\u00b2. But (m+1)^2 is m\u00b2 + 2m +1. So sum is m^2 +m. Which is less than m^2 +2m +1. So s can't be m+1.\n\nBut why does the sum being S >= s\u00b2 allow us to use s as the maximum?\n\nBecause the sum S is the total area of all blocks. To form a square of side s, the required area is s\u00b2, which must be <= S. So the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= S.\n\nBut according to the formula s = (n+1)//2, this is exactly the case.\n\nSo this suggests that the solution is simply to output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, let's check with the sample input given in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=5 \u2192 output is 3. (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=1 \u2192 output is 1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=3. sum is 4. s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=6 \u2192 6+1=7//2=3. So output 3. sum is 3*4=12. s\u00b2=9. Correct.\n\nSo this formula seems to hold. So the code is to read n, compute (n+1)//2 and output that.\n\nBut wait, why is this the case?\n\nBecause for even n=2m:\n\nsum S = m*(m+1)\n\ns = m\n\nbecause m\u00b2 <= m(m+1) < (m+1)^2 \u2192 s = m.\n\nFor odd n=2m-1:\n\nsum S = m\u00b2 \u2192 s=m.\n\nSo regardless of parity, s is (n+1)/2 rounded down.\n\nSo this is the correct approach.\n\nBut why did we go through the sum S and then take sqrt(S) if the answer is simply (n+1)//2?\n\nBecause the sum S for even n is m*(m+1), which is greater than m\u00b2. So s is m. For example, n=2: sum is 2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, but s is 1. But according to the formula, (2+1)//2 =1. So yes.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the maximum s would be floor( sqrt(S) ), which for even n is m. So the two approaches agree.\n\nBut the code can be written as for each test case, output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, how can this be correct? Because the sum for even n is m*(m+1), which is m squared plus m. So the maximum s is m, which is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut this seems counter-intuitive. For example, when sum is 12 (n=6), why can't we make a square of side 3 (sum 9) and have 3 left over? But we can. But why can't we make a larger square? Because the next possible s is 4, which requires sum >=16. But 12 <16, so no.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nThus, the code is simply to output (n +1) // 2.\n\nBut let's test this against some cases.\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 floor to 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (2+1)/2=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (7+1)/2=4 \u2192 sum is 16, s=4.\n\nn=8: (8+1)/2=4.5 \u21924. sum=4*5=20. s=4. 4\u00b2=16 <=20. correct.\n\nSo yes. So the code is simply to output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut why does the problem's sample input 2 have n=5 and the sum is 9 (3\u00b2), but according to the formula, (5+1)/2=3. So it's correct. So the code can be written as:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n\n\n    print (n+1) // 2\n\nBut wait, let's check with n=5, sum is 9. s=3. 3\u00b2=9. So sum is exactly s\u00b2. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6, sum is 12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So correct.\n\nBut what about n=7. sum is 16. s=4. 4\u00b2=16. Correct.\n\nBut wait, let's consider n=9. sum is (9+1)/2=5. So sum is 5\u00b2=25. s=5. Correct.\n\nBut for n=10. sum is 5*6=30. s=5. 5\u00b2=25. 30 >=25. Correct.\n\nSo this formula works.\n\nSo the code is simply output (n+1)//2.\n\nThus, the missing code in the solve function is to read n, compute (n+1)//2 and output it.\n\nSo the code inside the solve function would be:\n\nlong long n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1) / 2 << '\\n';\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's test n=5. (5+1)/2 is 3. Correct.\n\nBut for even numbers, n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5, but integer division would be 3.\n\nYes.\n\nBut why? Because in C++, when you do (n +1)/2 for integers, it's integer division. For even n=6: (6+1) is 7, divided by 2 is 3. So (7)/2=3.\n\nFor odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the code must handle n up to 1e9. So using integers is okay.\n\nSo the solution is simply to output (n+1)//2.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n\nBut how to handle the cases when the sum is not a square, but still allows the same s.\n\nFor example, n=6, sum is 12. s=3. 3^2=9, which is allowed. But sum is larger than 9, but the maximum s is 3.\n\nBecause the next possible s is 4, which requires sum >=16, which 12 <16.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code inside solve() is:\n\nlong long n;\ncin >> n;\ncout << (n + 1) / 2 << endl;\n\nBut wait, since the problem allows up to n=1e9, and t up to 1e4, we need to use appropriate data types. In C++, using int would overflow for n=1e9. So n should be read as long long.\n\nBut in the code, the original code has:\n\nvoid solve()\n{\n\t/* TODO: Your code here */\n\t\n}\n\nSo the code inside solve() should read a long long n, compute (n+1)/2, and output it.\n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nvoid solve() {\n    long long n;\n    cin >> n;\n    cout << (n + 1) / 2 << '\\n';\n}\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 2, n=5 gives 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4. (4+1)/2=2.5, but integer division gives 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the missing code is this."
