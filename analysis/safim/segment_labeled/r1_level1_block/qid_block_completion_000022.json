The code uses a 2D array of nullable booleans (bits) to track whether each bit of each element is set.

But when building each element's bits, for each bit position, how do we decide to set it to 0 or 1 while satisfying the OR conditions?\n\nLet me think about the process. The code first processes all statements where the OR result has certain bits. For each bit position, when the OR must be 0, both elements' bits must be 0. So they handle that in the initial loop over the statements. Then, the code sorts the statements and processes each element's bits, trying to set them to 0 if possible.\n\nIn the section where the code is handling the bits for each element (i loop), for each bit j, if bits[i,j] is already determined (true or false), they continue. Otherwise, they check if any of the constraints (statements) involving this element (i) and another element (p) require that the OR has the bit set. \n\nWait, the code has a part where, for the current bit j, it checks if the current element's bit is not yet determined. Then it looks at all the statements where the current element is the 'from' (t.Item1) and the other element is 'to' (t.Item2). For each such statement, the OR of the two bits must be set if the original x has that bit set.\n\nBut how to make sure that all constraints are satisfied while making the array lex smallest.\n\nThe key idea is that for lex order, we want the earliest possible elements to be as small as possible. So for each element in order, and for each bit from highest to lowest (since higher bits have more weight in the value), we try to set the bit to 0 if possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, higher bits (like the 30th bit) contribute more to the value. So for lex order, the first element that differs will have a higher impact. So for each element, starting from the first, we want to set the bits from the highest to the lowest. Because setting a higher bit to 0 when possible will make the element smaller. For example, if a bit can be 0 or 1, setting it to 0 reduces the value of the element, which is better for lex order.\n\nBut in the code, when processing the bits, they are looping j from 0 to 29, which corresponds to bits 0 (LSB) to 29 (MSB). Wait, that's the opposite. Because j=0 is bit 0 (value 1), j=1 is bit 1 (value 2), up to j=29 (value 2^29). So if they process the bits in order from j=0 to 29, they are handling the LSB first, then higher bits. But that's wrong for lex order, because higher bits have more weight. For example, if you set a higher bit to 0 when possible, the overall value is minimized. So the code's processing order might be incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the code's main loop for processing the bits, they are handling each bit j starting from 0 (LSB) to 29 (MSB). But for lex order, the bits should be handled from MSB to LSB. Because when building the number, setting higher bits to 0 first (if possible) leads to a smaller number. So perhaps the code has a bug here. But the code provided by the user is supposed to be correct except for the missing part. So maybe the code is correct, but the bit order is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses a different approach. Let's think again. The code has a loop over i from 0 to n-1 (elements), and for each element, it's processing each bit j from 0 to 29. For each bit j, if the current element's bit is not determined, it checks the constraints involving this element and others.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the code is trying to build the lex smallest array, which requires that earlier elements are as small as possible, and within each element, higher bits are set to 0 as much as possible. So for each element i, the bits should be considered from highest to lowest (j=29 to 0). But in the code's loop, j starts at 0 and goes up. That would process the lower bits first. Which would allow higher bits to be set, making the element larger, which is not desired. So perhaps this is an error in the code. But since the code is part of the problem given, and we have to fill in the missing part, maybe the code is correct, and the error is elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct. Let's see. For example, the code's processing of each element's bits in the order j=0 (LSB) to 29 (MSB). But for lex order, the earliest possible elements are processed first. For each element, the code is trying to set as many bits as possible to 0. Wait, but if the code is processing bits in LSB order, then when handling higher bits (like j=29), they can be set to 0 if possible. So perhaps the code is handling the bits in the correct order. Because when processing a bit j, which is higher than previous ones, but in the order of j increasing, perhaps it's possible to set higher bits to 0 if possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose for an element, the higher bit can be 0. If the code processes lower bits first, maybe setting them to 0, but the higher bits could still be set to 0. But how does the code handle that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because for each element, the code tries to set each bit to 0 if possible, and if not, sets it to 1, but the order of processing the bits (from LSB to MSB) may not affect that. For example, each bit is handled independently, but that's not correct. Because higher bits have more impact on the value. So the code may be incorrect in the order of processing the bits. But again, since the code is given and we need to fill in the missing part, perhaps the code is correct, and the problem is with the missing code in the TODO section.\n\nLooking at the code's structure. The main loop is over each element i, sorted, and for each bit j. For each bit j in the element i, the code checks if the bit is already determined. If not, then proceeds.\n\nIn the part where bits[i,j] is false (the code sets bits[i,j] to false, then enters a loop over the statements (from ind to indNext), which are the statements where the current element i is the 'from' (the first element in the tuple). For each such statement, the code has to process the 'to' elements (t.Item2). But the missing code is inside the for loop for k in [ind, indNext), when bits[i,j] is false. \n\nSo what's the scenario here? The code has determined that bits[i,j] must be false. But the OR between i and the 'to' elements must have the j-th bit equal to the x's j-th bit. Wait, but earlier, when (x & b) == 0, the code sets both from and to bits to false. But in the part after that, the code is processing each bit again, perhaps for cases where the OR is required to have the j-th bit set.\n\nWait, the first part of the code (before the main loop) handles all statements where x has the j-th bit not set. For those, the code enforces that both elements' bits are false. Then, in the main processing loop, they process the remaining cases where the OR's j-th bit could be set.\n\nSo, the main processing loop is handling each bit j in order from 0 to 29. For each element i, in order from 0 to n-1. For each bit j, if the current element's bit is not yet determined, they check if any of the constraints (statements) that involve this element i and another element p. The code seems to be determining whether the current element's bit can be set to 0, which would allow the array to be lex smaller.\n\nIn the section where bits[i,j] is false, the code enters a loop over the statements (k from ind to indNext). The missing code is here. So when bits[i,j] is set to false (because the current element's bit is determined to be 0), what needs to be done for the statements involving i and other elements (p)?\n\nSince the OR of i's bit and p's bit must have the j-th bit set (since x's j-th bit is set in this part of the code?), then if i's bit is 0, p's bit must be 1. Because 0 | 1 = 1.\n\nWait, the code has already handled the cases where x's j-th bit is 0 (by setting both bits to 0). So in the main loop, the code is handling the cases where x's j-th bit is 1. So for each statement (from, to, x), where x has the j-th bit set (since those statements were not handled in the first loop), the OR of from's j-th bit and to's j-th bit must be 1.\n\nSo when processing a statement (i, p, x) where x's j-th bit is 1, the OR of i's j-th bit and p's j-th bit must be 1. So either i's bit is 1, or p's bit is 1, or both.\n\nIn the code, for each element i, processing each bit j, they first check if the bit is already determined. If not, they check all the statements where i is the 'from' (sorted). For each of these statements, if the x's j-th bit is 1, then the OR of i's j-th bit and p's j-th bit must be 1.\n\nIn the code, when bits[i,j] is false (in the code's code), that's the case where the code has set it to false. But wait, how did bits[i,j] become false? Because in this part of the code, if bits[i,j] is false, then the code enters the loop where it's for each statement involving i as from. Since x's j-th bit is 1 (because this statement is in st, which wasn't handled in the first loop where x's j-th bit was 0). So, in this case, if i's j-th bit is false (0), then the OR with p's j-th bit must be 1. Therefore, p's j-th bit must be 1.\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO part is for each statement (k), where the current element is i (from) and the other element is p (to), when i's j-th bit is forced to 0, then p's j-th bit must be set to 1. Because 0 | 1 = 1. So, in this case, the code should set bits[p, j] to true.\n\nSo in the loop over k from ind to indNext (which are the statements where the current i is the from), when the code is in the case where bits[i,j] is set to false, then for each such statement, the OR is i's bit OR p's bit = 1. Since i's bit is 0, p's bit must be 1. Therefore, we must set p's j-th bit to true.\n\nSo the missing code inside the loop over k is to set bits[p][j] to true. So, for each statement k in that loop, take the 'to' element (p) and set bits[p, j] to true.\n\nBut wait, what if bits[p,j] was already set to false? That would be a conflict, but according to the problem statement, the input is such that a valid array exists. So the code can safely set it to true here.\n\nTherefore, the missing code should be:\n\nvar p = st[k].Item2;\nbits[p, j] = true;\n\nSo, inside the loop for k, for each statement, the 'to' element is p. So in the loop, when bits[i,j] is false (so i's bit is 0), then p's bit must be 1. So the code should set bits[p,j] to true.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO section is to set bits[p][j] to true for each p in the statements.\n\nSo the code in the for loop over k would be:\n\nvar p = st[k].Item2;\nif (bits[p, j] == null)\n{\n    bits[p, j] = true;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // If it's already false, that's a conflict. But the problem states that there is at least one valid array, so this shouldn't happen.\n}\n\nBut according to the problem's note, all statements are valid, so the code can safely set bits[p][j] to true. Even if it was previously set, but since the problem says the input is valid, perhaps this can't happen. So in the code, the missing part is:\n\nbits[p, j] = true;\n\nSo in the loop, for each statement in the current range (ind to indNext), take the 'to' element (p) and set their j-th bit to true.\n\nSo the code inside the for k loop would be:\n\nvar p = st[k].Item2;\nbits[p, j] = true;\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nbits[st[k].Item2, j] = true;\n\nBut in the code, the loop is for each k from ind to indNext, and the variables are:\n\nst[k] is a tuple with Item1 (from), Item2 (to), Item3 (x). So st[k].Item2 is the 'to' index (p).\n\nSo the code inside the loop is:\n\nbits[p, j] = true;\n\nSo in the missing part, the code should be:\n\nvar p = st[k].Item2;\nbits[p, j] = true;\n\nBut in C#, the code would be:\n\nbits[st[k].Item2, j] = true;\n\nSo in the for loop:\n\nfor (int k = ind; k < indNext; k++)\n{\n    bits[st[k].Item2, j] = true;\n}\n\nThat's the code that needs to be filled in. Because when i's bit is set to false (0), then for all statements where i is the from (and to is p), the OR must be 1. So p's bit must be 1.\n\nSo that's the missing code."
