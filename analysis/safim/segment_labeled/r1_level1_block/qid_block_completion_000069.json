But looking at the initial code:\n\nIn the initial loop for i from 0 to n-1 (assuming arr is 0-based), when i>0, they check if arr[i] != arr[i-1]. The variable ans seems to be tracking something. Let's see: For each i (starting from 1?), the code does:\n\nflag = arr[i] ! = arr[i-1]\n\nans = flag * i + ans +1\n\nsum += ans. Wait, maybe ans is the awesomeness sum for all subarrays ending at i. Let's see:\n\nFor i=0 (since arr is 0-based, and i starts from 0 in the loop?), but the loop is for i from 0 to n-1. So first iteration is i=0, but i>0 is false, so no code is executed except reading arr[i]. Then for i=1 (assuming n>1), flag is arr[1] ! = arr[0]. Then ans is set to flag*1 + ans +1.

Wait, the code says:\n\nans = 1ll * flag * i + ans +1; Wait, that's (flag * i) added to (ans +1). So if flag is true (1), then ans becomes i + ans +1. But for i=1, ans was initially 1. So ans becomes 1 + 1 + 1 =3? Then sum is 1 (from first iteration) + 3 (this ans) =4. Hmm, perhaps this is not the right approach. Let's think of a small example. Take n=2. The array is [1, 2]. The sum of awesomeness for all subarrays: [1] \u2192 1\n\n[2] \u21921\n\n[1,2] \u21922\n\nTotal sum: 1+1+2=4. In the code:\n\nInitial sum is 1 (ans starts at 1).

The sum is:\n\nEach single element: 3*1 =3. Subarrays of length 2: 3 each with 1 block \u2192 3.\n\nSubarray of length 3: 1. Total 3+3+1=7. In code:\n\nInitial sum is 1 (ans=1). i=1: arr[1] == arr[0], flag=0. ans becomes 0*1 + ans +1 \u2192 0 +1 +1=2. sum +=2 \u2192 sum=3. i=2: arr[2] == arr[1], flag=0. ans becomes 0*2 +2 +1=3. sum +=3 \u2192 sum=6.",

So flag=1. ans =1*1 +1 +1 =1+1+1=3. sum +=3 \u2192 sum=4.\n\ni=2:\n\na[2] ==a[1]. flag=0. ans =0*2 +3 +1=4. sum +=4 \u2192 sum=8. i=3:\n\na[3] ! =a[2]. flag=1. ans=1*3 +4 +1=3+4+1=8. sum +=8 \u2192 sum=16.\n\ni=4:\n\na[4] ! =a[3]. flag=1. ans=1*4 +8 +1=4+8+1=13. sum +=13 \u2192 sum=29. Which matches the sample. So the code's initial sum is correct. Now, when processing a query, we need to adjust the sum based on the changes in splits.",

The first query is changing position 2 (1-based) to 2, which is arr[1] =2. So p=2, x=2. In the code, arr[p-1] is arr[1] which was 1. The new value is 2. So arr[p-1] ! =x (no, wait, original arr[p-1] is 1, x is 2. So yes, the code enters the else block. Then, for the previous element (p-1>0 \u2192 p=2, p-1=1>0). Check if arr[p-1] (original 1) equals arr[p-2] (arr[0] which is 1). Yes. So in the code:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) \u2192 true. Then, the code adds rem * (p-1), where rem is n - (p-1) =5-1=4. So 4*1=4 is added to sum. Then, the code checks the next part (p <n \u2192 p=2 <5). The next element is arr[2] (original 1). Since arr[p-1] (original 1) == arr[p] (original 1), the code adds rem * p, where rem =5-2=3. So 2*3=6 added. So sum increases by 4+6=10. But wait, the original sum is 29.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the missing code in this C++ program. Let me read the problem statement again to understand what's required.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each query. The awesomeness of a subsegment is the number of blocks of consecutive identical elements. For example, [1,2,2] has awesomeness 2 because there's the [1] and [2,2] blocks.\n\nThe initial code computes some sum, and during each query, when the value at position p is changed to x, it adjusts the sum accordingly. The key is that when we change an element, it affects the neighboring elements (the ones before and after it), which in turn affects the number of blocks in various subsegments.\n\nLooking at the existing code structure, there are two main parts when processing a query: handling the previous element (p-1) and the next element (p). For each of these, there are conditions based on whether the old value was equal to the adjacent elements and what the new value is compared to those adjacents.\n\nThe part I need to fill is in the case where the new value x equals the previous element (arr[p-2]). Let's see. The code is handling the case when the previous element (p-1) exists. Let's break down the existing code:\n\nIn the 'if (p-1 > 0)' block:\n\nIf the original arr[p-1] was equal to arr[p-2], then when we change arr[p-1] to x (which is different from arr[p-1], because the outer condition checks that arr[p-1] != x), there's a possible split here. So the code adds rem * (p-1) to the sum. But I'm not exactly sure how that works.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial calculation. The sum seems to be computed in a way that for each position where a split occurs (i.e., when a[i] != a[i-1]), it contributes to the total sum. The initial sum is built by considering each element and whether it's different from the previous one.\n\nThe key idea here is that each time two consecutive elements are different, it creates a split that affects all subsegments that include both elements. For example, if a[i] != a[i-1], then any subsegment that includes both a[i-1] and a[i] will have one more split. The total contribution of this split is (number of left choices) * (number of right choices). The number of left choices is i (since the left can be any l from 1 to i), and the right choices are (n - i + 1) (since the right can be from i to n). So the total for a split between i-1 and i is i * (n - i + 1).\n\nBut in the code's initial setup, there's a loop where for each i > 0, they check if arr[i] != arr[i-1], which is a flag. Then ans is updated as 1ll * flag * i + ans + 1. Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Let's see: for each element, the initial code might be building some kind of dynamic programming structure. The variable ans could represent the number of blocks in all subarrays ending at position i. For example, when adding a new element, if it's different from the previous, then the number of blocks for subarrays ending at i increases by the index, perhaps? Or maybe the ans variable represents the contribution of the current position to the sum. Then sum accumulates ans each time. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial sum is computed by considering each possible left and right, and the sum is the total number of blocks across all subarrays. For each position where a split occurs (i.e., a[i] != a[i-1]), the number of subarrays that cross this split is (i) * (n - i + 1). For example, the split between i-1 and i contributes 1 to each subarray that starts at or before i-1 and ends at or after i. So each split contributes (i) * (n - i + 1) to the total sum.\n\nSo the total sum is the sum over all possible splits (each split's contribution) plus the number of subarrays (since each subarray of length 1 has 1 block). Wait, no. Because the awesomeness is the number of blocks, which is equal to 1 plus the number of splits in the subarray. For example, a subarray with elements [a, a, a] has 1 block. [a, a, b] has 2 blocks. So the awesomeness is (number of splits in the subarray) + 1. So the total sum is the sum for all subarrays of (number of splits in the subarray + 1). Which is equal to the total number of subarrays (each contributes 1) plus the sum of the number of splits in each subarray. The total number of subarrays is n*(n+1)/2. But in the initial code, the sum starts at 1 and builds up. So perhaps the code is calculating the sum of the awesomeness in a way that tracks the splits.\n\nBut perhaps the code's sum is computed as follows: each split between i-1 and i contributes (i) * (n - i + 1) to the total sum. Because for each such split, the number of subarrays that include this split is (i) possible starting points (since the start can be from 1 to i) multiplied by (n - i + 1) possible ending points (from i to n). So each split contributes i*(n - i + 1) to the sum of awesomeness. Then, the total sum is the sum over all splits (i) of i*(n -i+1) plus the number of subarrays (since each subarray has at least 1 block). Wait, because each split contributes 1 to the awesomeness of the subarrays that cross it. So the total sum would be sum (number of splits in all subarrays) + number of subarrays. Which can be computed as sum of (i*(n -i +1) for each split between i-1 and i) + (n*(n+1))/2).\n\nBut looking at the initial code:\n\nIn the initial loop for i from 0 to n-1 (assuming arr is 0-based), when i>0, they check if arr[i] != arr[i-1]. The variable ans seems to be tracking something. Let's see:\n\nFor each i (starting from 1?), the code does:\n\nflag = arr[i] != arr[i-1]\n\nans = flag * i + ans +1\n\nsum += ans.\n\nWait, maybe ans is the awesomeness sum for all subarrays ending at i. Let's see:\n\nFor i=0 (since arr is 0-based, and i starts from 0 in the loop?), but the loop is for i from 0 to n-1. So first iteration is i=0, but i>0 is false, so no code is executed except reading arr[i]. Then for i=1 (assuming n>1), flag is arr[1] != arr[0]. Then ans is set to flag*1 + ans +1. The initial value of ans is 1. So let's see:\n\nIf flag is true (arr[1] != arr[0]), then ans becomes 1*1 (since i=1) + ans (which is 1) +1. Wait, no: the code is:\n\nans = 1ll * flag * i + ans +1 ?\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nans = 1ll * flag * i + ans +1;\n\nWait, that's (flag * i) added to (ans +1). So if flag is true (1), then ans becomes i + ans +1. But for i=1, ans was initially 1. So ans becomes 1 + 1 + 1 =3? Then sum is 1 (from first iteration) + 3 (this ans) =4.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is not the right approach. Let's think of a small example.\n\nTake n=2. The array is [1, 2]. The sum of awesomeness for all subarrays:\n\n[1] \u2192 1\n\n[2] \u21921\n\n[1,2] \u21922\n\nTotal sum: 1+1+2=4.\n\nIn the code:\n\nInitial sum is 1 (ans starts at 1).\n\nThen for i=1 (second element), flag is true (1 !=2).\n\nans = 1 * 1 (i=1) + ans (1) +1 \u2192 1 +1 +1=3. sum +=3 \u2192 sum is 4. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: n=3, array [1,1,1]. The sum is:\n\nEach single element: 3*1 =3.\n\nSubarrays of length 2: 3 each with 1 block \u2192 3.\n\nSubarray of length 3: 1. Total 3+3+1=7.\n\nIn code:\n\nInitial sum is 1 (ans=1).\n\ni=1: arr[1] == arr[0], flag=0. ans becomes 0*1 + ans +1 \u2192 0 +1 +1=2. sum +=2 \u2192 sum=3.\n\ni=2: arr[2] == arr[1], flag=0. ans becomes 0*2 +2 +1=3. sum +=3 \u2192 sum=6.\n\nWait, but the actual sum is 7. So code's sum is 6 here. So something's wrong. But the sample input says that for [1,1,1], the awesomeness is 1. So the sum for all subarrays would be sum for l=1 to r=1 (1), l=1-2 (1), l=1-3 (1), l=2-2 (1), l=2-3 (1), l=3-3 (1). Total 6. But according to the problem statement, the sample says for [1,1,1], the awesomeness is 1. So each subarray of the entire array [1,1,1] has awesomeness 1. So sum is 6. So code's calculation is correct here.\n\nWait, then the code is correct. Because in the code's initial setup, the sum is 6 for the array [1,1,1]. Then what's the problem?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's sum is the sum of the awesomeness of all subarrays. Let's confirm.\n\nIn the code's initial setup for the example [1,2,2,4,5], after the first query, the sum is 29. Which matches the sample. So the code's initial sum calculation is correct.\n\nSo the code's approach is to track, for each position i (starting from 1?), the contribution to the sum based on whether the current element is different from the previous. The ans variable seems to accumulate the number of blocks in the current subarrays ending at position i. Then sum accumulates all these ans values. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's sum is the sum of the awesomeness for all subarrays. Let's think of it as for each position i, the code tracks the contribution of the current element and the transitions between elements.\n\nBut perhaps the main idea is that each time two adjacent elements differ, it creates a split. Each split contributes to the sum based on how many subarrays cross that split. For example, a split between positions i-1 and i contributes i*(n - i) to the sum. Because the split is part of any subarray that starts at or before i-1 and ends at or after i. The number of such subarrays is i*(n - i +1). Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let's see:\n\nThe split at position i (between a[i] and a[i+1], assuming 0-based) would be part of all subarrays that include both a[i] and a[i+1]. The number of such subarrays is (i+1) * (n - (i+1)), where i+1 is the number of possible starting points (from 0 to i) and (n - (i+1) +1) is the number of possible ending points (from i+1 to n-1). So the total is (i+1) * (n - i - 1 + 1) = (i+1)*(n - i). So each split contributes (i+1)*(n -i) to the sum.\n\nBut in the code, when handling queries, they adjust the sum based on whether the split at p-1 (previous) and p (current) is created or removed.\n\nSo in the code's processing of queries, when the value at position p is changed, they check the previous and next elements. For example, in the case where p-1 is valid (p>1), the code checks if arr[p-1] was equal to arr[p-2] before the change, and how changing it to x affects this.\n\nThe code's approach seems to be:\n\n- For each split (i, i+1) (for 0-based), track whether a[i] != a[i+1]. Each such split contributes (i+1) * (n - (i+1) + 1) = (i+1)*(n - i) to the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the code maintains the sum as the sum of all splits' contributions, plus the number of subarrays. Because each subarray has at least one block (awesomeness >=1), so the total sum is sum_splits + total_subarrays. Because each split contributes 1 to the awesomeness for each subarray that includes it. The total_subarrays is n*(n+1)/2.\n\nBut in the code's initial sum calculation, let's see:\n\nFor the sample input in the note, after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5], and the sum is 29.\n\nThe total_subarrays is 5*(5+1)/2 =15. So sum_splits is 29-15=14. Let's see how many splits there are and their contributions.\n\nThe splits are between positions where consecutive elements differ.\n\nIn the array [1,2,2,4,5], the splits are between 0-1 (1 and 2), 2-3 (2 and 4), 3-4 (4 and5). So three splits.\n\nThe contributions for each split:\n\nSplit 0-1: (0+1) * (5-0-1) =1 *4=4? Wait, maybe the formula is (i) * (n - i). For split at position i (between a[i] and a[i+1]).\n\nWait, for split between i and i+1 (0-based), the contribution is (i+1) * (n - (i+1)). Because the number of subarrays that include this split is (i+1) possible starting points (from 0 to i) multiplied by (n - (i+1)) possible ending points (from i+1 to n-1).\n\nSo for split 0-1 (i=0):\n\n(i+1) * (n - (i+1)) =1 *4=4.\n\nSplit between 2-3 (i=2):\n\n3 * (5-3)=3*2=6.\n\nSplit between 3-4 (i=3):\n\n4 *1=4.\n\nTotal sum_splits:4+6+4=14. Then total sum is 14 +15=29. Which matches the sample. So the code's approach is to track sum_splits (the sum of the contributions of each split) and add the total_subarrays (n*(n+1)/2) to get the sum.\n\nBut looking at the code's initial setup:\n\nsum starts at 1. Then for each i from 0 to n-1, when i>0, we check if the current element is different from the previous. For example, in the first iteration (i=0), nothing is done. For i=1, if a[1] != a[0], then we add some value to the sum.\n\nWait, the initial code:\n\nsum is initialized as 1.\n\nans is initialized as 1.\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nif (i>0) {\n\n   flag = arr[i] != arr[i-1]\n\n   ans = flag * i + ans +1;\n\n   sum += ans;\n\n}\n\nSo for the first element (i=0), nothing is added. For i=1, if flag is true, ans becomes 1*1 (i=1) + ans (1) +1. So ans =1+1+1=3. sum becomes 1+3=4.\n\nThen for i=2, if flag is true (arr[2] != arr[1]), ans becomes 2*1 (assuming flag is 1) + 3 +1 = 2+3+1=6. sum becomes 4+6=10.\n\nBut this approach doesn't align with the split-based calculation. So perhaps the code is using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a dynamic programming approach where ans represents the number of blocks in the current subarrays ending at position i. For each i, ans is the sum of the awesomeness of all subarrays ending at i.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhen i=0 (the first element), the only subarray is [0], so ans=1. sum becomes 1.\n\nFor i=1, if a[1] is different from a[0], then the subarrays ending at i=1 are [0,1] and [1]. The awesomeness is 2 (for [0,1]) and 1 (for [1]), sum is 3. ans becomes 3. sum is 1+3=4.\n\nFor i=2, if a[2] is the same as a[1], then the subarrays ending at i=2 are:\n\n- [0,1,2]: awesomeness is 2 (since a[0] !=a[1], so two blocks).\n\nWait, no: a[0] is 1, a[1] is 2, a[2] is 2. So [0,1,2] has two blocks (1, 2,2). So awesomeness is 2. The subarrays ending at 2 are:\n\n[2] \u2192 1\n\n[1,2] \u21921 (since a[1] and a[2] are same \u2192 one block).\n\n[0,1,2] \u2192 2 blocks.\n\nSum is 1+1+2=4. So ans for i=2 would be 4. sum becomes 4 + previous sum (4) \u2192 8.\n\nBut according to the code's calculation:\n\nIf a[2] is same as a[1], then flag is 0. ans = 0 * 2 (i=2) + ans (3) +1 \u2192 0 +3 +1=4. sum +=4 \u2192 4+4=8. Which matches.\n\nSo the code's ans variable seems to track the sum of awesomeness for all subarrays ending at i. For each i, ans is computed based on whether the current element is different from the previous. If it's different, then for each subarray ending at i, the number of blocks increases by 1. But the way ans is calculated seems to be a formula that builds this.\n\nIn the code's initial setup, the sum is the sum of ans for all i. So for each i, ans is the sum of awesomeness for all subarrays ending at i. Then the total sum is the sum of all ans values for each i.\n\nSo for the sample [1,2,2,4,5], let's compute ans for each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nNo previous. ans is 1 (only subarray [0]). sum=1.\n\ni=1:\n\na[1] !=a[0]. So flag=1. ans =1*1 +1 +1 =1+1+1=3. sum +=3 \u2192 sum=4.\n\ni=2:\n\na[2] ==a[1]. flag=0. ans =0*2 +3 +1=4. sum +=4 \u2192 sum=8.\n\ni=3:\n\na[3] !=a[2]. flag=1. ans=1*3 +4 +1=3+4+1=8. sum +=8 \u2192 sum=16.\n\ni=4:\n\na[4] !=a[3]. flag=1. ans=1*4 +8 +1=4+8+1=13. sum +=13 \u2192 sum=29. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code's initial sum is correct.\n\nNow, when processing a query, we need to adjust the sum based on the changes in splits.\n\nFor example, when changing the value at position p (1-based), which is arr[p-1] (0-based), the code checks the previous element (p-2) and next element (p). For each of these adjacent positions, the code modifies the sum based on whether the split existed before and after the change.\n\nIn the code, when the old arr[p-1] was equal to its previous (p-2) element, then changing it to x (which is different) may create a new split. Similarly, if the new x is equal to the previous element, then a split may be removed.\n\nBut how does the code track the splits and their contributions?\n\nThe code seems to have two parts for handling the previous and next elements.\n\nFor the previous element (p-1 >0):\n\nIf before the change, arr[p-1] == arr[p-2], then changing arr[p-1] to x (which is different) will create a new split between p-2 and p-1. So the code adds rem * (p-1) to the sum, where rem is n - (p-1). Wait, p-1 is the index (0-based) of the current element. So (p-1) is the position where the split is between (p-2) and (p-1). The number of subarrays that include this split is (p-1) * (n - (p-1) + 1). Because the starting points can be from 0 to (p-2) (which is (p-1) options) and the ending points from (p-1) to n-1 (n - (p-1) options). So (p-1) * (n - (p-1) +1 - (p-1) +1? Wait, perhaps the code's rem is (n - (p-1)) which is n - (p-1) in 0-based terms. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn the code:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) {\n\n   ll rem = n - (p-1);\n\n   sum += rem * (p-1);\n\n}\n\nSo (p-1) is the index of the current element. The split is between (p-2) and (p-1). The contribution of this split would be (p-1) * (n - (p-1)), since (p-1) is (index of p-1) + 1? Not sure. But according to the code's calculation, when a split is created between p-2 and p-1 (after changing arr[p-1] to x, which is different from arr[p-2]), the code adds rem * (p-1) to the sum. Here, rem is n - (p-1), which is the number of elements from p-1 (inclusive) to the end. So (p-1) * (n - (p-1)) equals (number of starting points) * (number of ending points). Wait, but (p-1) is the index (0-based) of the current element. The split between (p-2) and (p-1) is at index (p-2). So the split's contribution would be (p-1) * (n - (p-1 +1) +1) = (p-1) * (n - p +1). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's rem represents the number of possible right ends. For example, when the split is between i and i+1 (0-based), the number of possible left ends is i+1 (from 0 to i), and the number of possible right ends is (n - (i+1)), which is (n - i -1). So the contribution is (i+1) * (n - i -1). \n\nBut in the code, when handling the split between (p-2) and (p-1), the index of the split is (p-2), so i = p-2. So the contribution is (i+1) * (n - i -1) = (p-1) * (n - (p-2 +1)) = (p-1) * (n - p +1). But in the code, rem is n - (p-1). So (n - (p-1)) is n - p +1. So (p-1) * (n - p +1) is exactly the contribution. So when the code adds rem * (p-1), that's correct. So when a split is added between (p-2) and (p-1), the contribution is (p-1) * (n - (p-1)).\n\nSimilarly, when a split is removed (for example, when changing x to match the previous element, thus merging two splits), the code subtracts that contribution.\n\nNow, looking at the code's current parts:\n\nIn the case where p-1 >0:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) {\n\n   // So before the change, the split between p-2 and p-1 did not exist.\n\n   // After changing to x, if x != arr[p-2], then a split is created. So we add the contribution.\n\n   sum += rem * (p-1).\n\n}\n\nelse if (x == arr[p-2]) {\n\n   // Before the change, the split between p-2 and p-1 did exist. Now, after changing arr[p-1] to x (same as p-2), the split is removed. So we subtract the contribution.\n\n   // So here, rem is n - (p-1), and the code should subtract rem * (p-1).\n\n   // The code's missing part here.\n\n}\n\nSo in the code's TODO part, when x == arr[p-2], which means after the change, the split between p-2 and p-1 is removed. So the contribution of that split (which was present before the change) is subtracted from the sum. So the code should subtract rem * (p-1) from sum.\n\nIn the existing code for the first case (when the previous elements were equal), they add rem * (p-1). For the else if case where the new x equals the previous element, they should subtract rem * (p-1).\n\nSo the missing code in the else if (x == arr[p-2]) case is:\n\nsum -= rem * (p-1);\n\nBut how is rem computed here? Let's check the code's previous part:\n\nIn the first case (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]), rem is computed as n - (p-1). Because when the split is added, the contribution is (p-1) * (n - (p-1)), which is rem * (p-1).\n\nIn the else if case, the split is being removed. So rem should be n - (p-1), and sum is subtracted by rem * (p-1).\n\nBut in the code, the rem variable is only defined in the first case. So in the else if case, rem is not defined. So the code needs to compute rem = n - (p-1).\n\nSo the missing code would be:\n\nll rem = n - (p - 1);\nsum -= rem * (p - 1);\n\nTherefore, the code inside the else if (x == arr[p-2]) should be:\n\nll rem = n - (p -1);\nsum -= rem * (p -1);\n\nBut looking at the code's structure, the variable rem is used in the previous case. So in the else if case, we need to compute rem and then subtract.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nll rem = n - (p - 1);\nsum -= rem * (p - 1);\n\nBut wait, in the first case, when arr[p-1] == arr[p-2], and now we change it to x (different from arr[p-2), the split is created. So the code adds the contribution. In the else if case, when x equals arr[p-2], the split is being removed. So the code must subtract the contribution that was present before the change.\n\nBut how do we know if the split was present before the change?\n\nThe else if (x == arr[p-2]) is part of the code that's executed when the original arr[p-1] != x (since the outer condition is that arr[p-1] !=x). So before the change, arr[p-1] != arr[p-2] (since the else if is part of the else clause of the first condition). Because:\n\nThe code structure is:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == x) { ... } else {\n\n   if (p-1 >0) {\n\n      if (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) { ... }\n\n      else if (x == arr[p-2]) { ... }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo in the else clause (arr[p-1] !=x), we check if p-1>0 (previous element exists). Then, if before the change, arr[p-1] was equal to arr[p-2], then the code adds rem * (p-1). Otherwise, if x is equal to arr[p-2], then after changing, the split between p-2 and p-1 will be removed. So we subtract rem * (p-1).\n\nBut wait, before the change, if arr[p-1] != arr[p-2], then there was a split between p-2 and p-1. So when changing arr[p-1] to x which is equal to arr[p-2], this split is removed, hence the contribution should be subtracted.\n\nYes. So the code's else if (x == arr[p-2]) is entered when the original arr[p-1] != arr[p-2] (because the first condition was arr[p-1] == arr[p-2] which was false, leading to the else if). So the original split existed, and after the change, the split is removed. So the code subtracts the contribution of that split.\n\nSo the code needs to compute rem as n - (p-1), multiply by (p-1), and subtract from sum.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nll rem = n - (p - 1);\nsum -= rem * (p - 1);\n\nBut in the code, the previous 'rem' is declared inside the 'if (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2])' block. So in the 'else if (x == arr[p-2])' block, 'rem' is not defined. Hence, we need to compute it.\n\nSo the correct code for the TODO part is:\n\nll rem = n - (p - 1);\nsum -= rem * (p - 1);\n\nPutting that into the code:\n\nelse if (x == arr[p - 2]) {\n    ll rem = n - (p - 1);\n    sum -= rem * (p - 1);\n}\n\nThat's the missing code.\n\nSimilarly, in the part where p <n is handled (the next element), the code checks if the current arr[p-1] == arr[p], and when x equals arr[p], subtracts the contribution. So the code for the next element is similar.\n\nSo the missing code for the else if (x == arr[p-2]) case is adding the two lines above.\n\nTesting this with the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n5 1\n\n1 1 1 4 5\n\nFirst query is 2 2.\n\nAfter the query, the array becomes [1, 2, 1,4,5].\n\nWait, the initial array after reading is [1,1,1,4,5]. The first query is changing position 2 (1-based) to 2, which is arr[1] =2.\n\nSo p=2, x=2.\n\nIn the code, arr[p-1] is arr[1] which was 1. The new value is 2. So arr[p-1] !=x (no, wait, original arr[p-1] is 1, x is 2. So yes, the code enters the else block.\n\nThen, for the previous element (p-1>0 \u2192 p=2, p-1=1>0).\n\nCheck if arr[p-1] (original 1) equals arr[p-2] (arr[0] which is 1). Yes. So in the code:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) \u2192 true.\n\nThen, the code adds rem * (p-1), where rem is n - (p-1) =5-1=4. So 4*1=4 is added to sum.\n\nThen, the code checks the next part (p <n \u2192 p=2 <5). The next element is arr[2] (original 1). Since arr[p-1] (original 1) == arr[p] (original 1), the code adds rem * p, where rem =5-2=3. So 2*3=6 added. So sum increases by 4+6=10. But wait, the original sum is 29.\n\nWait, but the sample's first query sum is 29. So after the code's calculation, perhaps there's a mistake.\n\nWait, the initial sum after processing the array [1,2,2,4,5] is 29. Then, the query changes the array to [1,2,2,4,5] (no change?), which is the same as before. Wait, no. The sample's first query is changing index 2 (1-based) to 2. The original array after the first query is [1,2,2,4,5], which is the same as the array after processing the initial input. So why does the sum in the sample become 29?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is different. Let me recheck the sample's note:\n\nIn the sample note, after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. The initial array was [1,1,1,4,5], and the first query is changing position 2 (1-based) to 2. So the initial array after processing the input is [1,1,1,4,5]. Then the query changes position 2 (value 1) to 2, making the array [1,2,1,4,5]. Wait, no. Because the original array after input is [1,1,1,4,5]. The first query is i=2, x=2. So the array becomes [1,2,1,4,5]. Then the sum is computed. But according to the sample note, the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5], which is different. Oh, perhaps the sample's initial array is different. Maybe the sample's initial array is different than what I thought. But the sample note's explanation says after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5], which suggests that the second element (1-based) is changed to 2. So the initial array must have had a different value at position 2. For example, if the initial array was [1,1,2,4,5], then changing position 2 to 2 would make no change. But perhaps the sample's initial array is [1,2,2,4,5], and the first query is a dummy query.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's note is the first query in the problem. But the problem statement says that the first line of input is n and m, then the array, then m queries. So in the sample note, the initial array is not given, but after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. So perhaps the first query is changing the array from [1,1,2,4,5] to [1,2,2,4,5], but that's not clear.\n\nBut regardless, the code's logic for handling the previous and next elements is as discussed.\n\nSo the missing code in the else if (x == arr[p-2]) block is to subtract the contribution of the split between p-2 and p-1 (if it existed before the change).\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nll rem = n - (p - 1);\nsum -= rem * (p - 1);"
}
