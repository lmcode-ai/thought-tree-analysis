Division 3 is 1400 to 1599, and Division 4 is everything below 1400. Looking at the existing code, after checking if the number is >=1900, which prints Division 1. Then there's an elif for num >=1600, but the code there is incomplete. The next elif is for >=1400, which would be Division 3, but wait, that's only correct if the number is between 1400 and 1599. Because 1600 and above would have already been handled by the previous condition. Wait, the code structure is using elif statements, which are checked in order. So the first condition is if num >=1900: print Div 1. Then, elif num >=1600: so in this case, numbers that are >=1600 but <1900. Because if they were >=1900, they would have been caught by the first condition. So for the elif num >=1600, we need to print Division 2. Because Division 2 is 1600 <= rating <= 1899. So in this case, that condition would capture numbers from 1600 up to 1899.999..., which is correct. So for the missing code here, the line should be print(\"Division 2\"). Then the next condition is elif num >=1400: which would capture 1400 up to 1599, so that's Division 3, which is handled by the existing code. And else is Division 4. So the missing line is the code for the elif num >=1600 case. So the code there should print \"Division 2\". Let me check the sample test cases. For example, in the sixth test case with 1679, that's >=1600 and <1900, so it should output Division 2.",
