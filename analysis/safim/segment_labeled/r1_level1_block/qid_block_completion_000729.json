      "text": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine the division based on the given rating. Let's see the problem statement again. The divisions are divided as follows:\n- Division 1: rating >= 1900\n- Division 2: between 1600 and 1899 inclusive\n- Division 3: between 1400 and 1599 inclusive\n- Division 4: <=1399 So the function div(n) should return the correct division number based on these ranges. Hmm. So for a given n, check which range it falls into. Let's think about the order. Starting from the highest first. Because if n is 2000, it's division 1, so check if n > =1900 first. Then, if not, check if it's >=1600, etc. So the logic would be:\n\nif n >=1900 \u2192 return 1\nelif 1600 <=n <=1899 \u2192 return 2\nelif 1400 <=n <=1599 \u2192 return3\nelse \u2192 return4\n\nWait, but the else covers all cases where n is <=1399, right? So that's division4. So the function should implement these conditions in that order. So the code inside the div function would be:\n\ndef div(n): if n >=1900:\n        return 1\n    elif n >=1600:\n        return 2\n    elif n >=1400:\n        return 3\n    else:\n        return 4\n\nWait, let's check the conditions. Because for the elif statements, once the first condition (n >=1900) is not met, the next check is if n >=1600. But 1600 is part of division 2. But division 2 requires that the rating is <=1899. Wait, but if the code checks if n >=1600, but after checking that n is not >=1900, then 1600 <=n <=1899 is covered by the first elif. Yes, because after the first condition (n >=1900) is false, the elif n >=1600 would capture all n >=1600 but less than 1900, which is exactly division 2. Similarly, the next elif checks for >=1400, but since n is already less than 1600 here, so division 3. Then else is division4. So this code should work. Let me test with the sample inputs:\n\nTest case 1: -789 \u2192 else \u2192 4.\nTest case 2:1299 \u2192 else \u21924. Test case3:1300 \u2192 else? Wait 1300 is <=1399, so division4. Yes. Test case4:1399 \u2192 same as above \u21924. Test5:1400 \u2192 elif n >=1400 \u2192 return3. Test6:1679 \u2192 between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 returns 2. Test7:2300 \u2192 first condition, returns 1. Yes, that all works. So the code should be correct.",
