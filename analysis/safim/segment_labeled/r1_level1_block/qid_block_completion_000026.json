So that's correct. But in the fourth test case's sample, the code would set count=4 (n-1=4?), but I'm not sure. But let's think: in the code, during the loop, for each i from 0 to n-1: At each iteration, check if s/k ==b. If not, subtract (k-1) from s and increment count. So let's see for the fourth sample: Assuming the test case's parameters are n=5, k=4, b=7, s=38.\n\nk*b =28. So 28 <= s=38 <=28 +5*(4-1) \u219228 < =38 <=28 +15=43 \u2192 yes. So sum r_i =38-28=10. So sum of r_i is 10. But since each r_i can be up to 3 (k-1=3), and there are 5 elements. So for example, 3+3+3+1+0=10. Then the array would be [0*4 +3, 0*4+3, 0*4+3, 0*4+1, 7*4+0] \u2192 [3,3,3,1,28]. Sum is 3+3+3+1+28=38. Beauty is 0+0+0+0+7=7. But the sample's array is different. So there are multiple possible solutions. But the code's approach would do:\n\nCheck if s/k =38/4=9.5 \u2192 floor is 9, which is not equal to b=7. So subtract (k-1=3) from s: 38-3=35. count=1. Check 35/4=8.75 \u2192 floor 8. Not equal to 7. Subtract 3: 35-3=32. count=2.\n\n32/4=8 \u2192 still not 7. Subtract 3 \u219229. count=3.\n\n29/4=7.25 \u2192 floor 7. Now s_remaining=29. 7 equals b=7. So flag is true. So count=3. Then, the code will output: For i <n - count -1 \u21925-3-1=1. So i<1 \u2192i=0: output 0. Then i <5-1=4 (since n-1 is 4) \u2192 i=1,2,3: output k-1=3. Then the last element (i=4) outputs 29. So the array is [0,3,3,3,29], sum 0+3+3+3+29=38. Beauty is floor(0/4)+3/4*3 +29/4 \u21920+0+0+0+7=7. Which matches the sample. Ah! So the code's approach works here. So the code's logic is correct. But how? The code's loop subtracts (k-1) until s/k ==b. Then, the remaining s is the value of the last element, and count is the number of (k-1) elements. Then, the code outputs (n - count -1) zeros, count (k-1)s, and the last element s_remaining. Wait, the code's output logic is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n   if (i <n - count -1) \u2192 output 0.\n\n   else if (i <n-1) \u2192 output k-1.\n\n   else \u2192 output s_remaining. } So the first (n - count -1) elements are 0, then (count) elements are (k-1), then the last element is s_remaining. But wait, the count is the number of (k-1) elements. So (count) elements are (k-1), and the first (n - count -1) elements are 0. But that's (n - count -1) + count +1 =n elements. So correct. In the fourth sample's case, count=3, n=5. So first (5-3-1)=1 element is 0. Then 3 elements are (3), and the last element is 29. So [0,3,3,3,29], which is correct. So the code's approach is valid. But the code has a for loop that runs up to n times. Each time, if s/k !=b, subtracts (k-1). But how can we handle large values? Because for example, if k is 1e9, then subtracting (k-1) could make s negative quickly, leading to problems. But according to the problem statement, the sum s must be >=k*b and <=k*b +n*(k-1). So the code's approach should only subtract (k-1) up to n times. However, if the initial s is too small, subtracting (k-1) could make s negative. For example, if k=2, s=1, and in the loop, subtract 1 each time. So after one step, s=0, but s/k=0. But if b was 0, then that's okay. But the code's loop checks if s/k ==b. So in such cases, it's possible. But how to ensure that after subtracting (k-1) up to n times, the code can reach s_remaining where s_remaining/k ==b.\n\nWait, but according to the necessary conditions, if the sum s is between k*b and k*b +n*(k-1), then there exists a solution. And the code's approach will find it. So let's see. Suppose s is in [k*b, k*b +n*(k-1)]. Then, s =k*b + sum r_i, where sum r_i <=n*(k-1). So sum r_i =s -k*b. But the code's approach is to subtract (k-1) as much as possible. So the count is the maximum possible number of (k-1) elements. But perhaps that's not the case. Wait, let's see. Suppose sum r_i is 10, and n=5. Each r_i can be at most (k-1). For example, if k=5, then sum r_i can be 10=3+3+4+0+0. So the code's approach would subtract (k-1) (4) three times, making s_remaining = s -3*4 =s -12. Then, s_remaining/k = (k*b +10 -12)/k. But this may not be equal to b.\n\nHmm. Maybe the code's approach is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the code's approach is not correct in some cases. For example, when sum r_i is less than (n-1)*(k-1). Then, the code's approach of setting (count) elements to (k-1) may require s_remaining = s - count*(k-1), which is s_remaining =k*b + sum r_i - count*(k-1). And this s_remaining must be >=b*k and < (b+1)*k. So:\n\nk*b <= k*b + sum r_i - count*(k-1) < k*b +k.\n\nSubtract k*b from all parts:\n\n0 <= sum r_i - count*(k-1) <k.\n\nRearranged:\n\ncount*(k-1) <= sum r_i < count*(k-1) + k.\n\nSo sum r_i must be in this interval. But sum r_i can be any value between 0 and n*(k-1). But how to find the count. Let's see:\n\nsum r_i can be written as (count)*(k-1) + rem, where 0<=rem <k. But in that case, sum r_i - count*(k-1) =rem. So 0<= rem <k. So the code's approach is trying to find count such that sum r_i = count*(k-1) + rem, where rem is in [0, k). And then set the last element to b*k + rem. Wait, but sum r_i is s -k*b. So sum r_i = s -k*b. So code's approach subtracts (k-1) from s (equivalent to adding (k-1) to sum r_i?), not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct if the following holds:\n\nsum r_i = count*(k-1) + rem, where rem is in [0, k). So the code's loop subtracts (k-1) from s (sum r_i = sum r_i_initial - count*(k-1)), but sum r_i_initial =s -k*b.",

But how to find count? The code uses a loop that tries to subtract (k-1) up to n times. Each time, it checks if s/k ==b. But when you subtract (k-1), s decreases by (k-1). So s/k can decrease by at least (k-1)/k, which is 0.999 for large k. But for example, if k is large, say 1e9, then each subtraction of (k-1) reduces s by nearly 1e9. So after a few steps, s could become negative, but the code's loop would stop when s/k ==b. But how does this work? Let's take an example where k=1e9, b=0, s=1e9-1. Then sum r_i =s -k*b =1e9-1. sum r_i is 1e9-1. n is 1e5. The maximum sum r_i is n*(k-1) =1e5*(1e9-1) which is way larger than 1e9-1. So a solution exists. But according to the code's approach, the code will check if s/k ==0. s is 1e9-1. s/k is 0. So flag is true. So count is 0. The code outputs all zeros except the last element. Which is s=1e9-1. But the sum of the array is s=1e9-1. But beauty is floor( (1e9-1)/1e9 )=0. Correct. Another example: k=5, b=3, s= 3*5 + 3=18. So sum r_i=3. The code's loop:\n\nInitial s=18. s/k=3.6 \u2192 floor 3. So equals b. So flag is set. count=0. Output 0 elements as 0, then one element 18. So array is [0,0,0,..,18]. Sum 18, beauty 3. Correct. But sum r_i=3. So the code's approach would set count=0. But sum r_i=3. So in the code's approach, the remaining s_remaining=18. Then, the last element is 18, which has r_i=18 mod5=3. So yes. But according to the code's output logic, the first (n -count -1) elements are 0. So if count is 0, the first n-1 elements are 0, last is 18. So sum is 18. Correct. So the code's approach works.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to construct an array a of n non-negative integers such that the sum of each element divided by k (floored) is equal to b, and the total sum of the array is s. If not possible, output -1.\n\nLooking at the code provided. The main approach seems to be:\n\nThe code processes each test case. It checks in a loop for each element (up to n times) whether s/k equals b. If not, subtracts (k-1) from s and increments count. This probably represents allocating some elements as (k-1), which contribute 0 to the beauty when divided by k. Then, if after some steps s/k equals b, then flag is set to true. The rest of the code then outputs the array.\n\nWait, the loop runs up to n times, each time subtracting (k-1) from s. So the idea is that by putting some elements as k-1 (which gives floor division by k as 0), we can adjust the remaining s to have s/k equal to b. Then the last element will be s, which after these subtractions is equal to b*k + something less than k?\n\nWait, let's think about the condition. The total beauty is sum( floor(a_i/k) ) = b. So each element contributes at least 0. For the elements that are (k-1), their contribution is 0. The remaining element (the last one) would be s - count*(k-1), and that needs to be >=0. Also, floor(s_remaining /k) must be equal to b.\n\nWait, the code's logic is that during each iteration, they subtract (k-1) from s (if possible), which represents setting one element to (k-1). Then, after some count of elements set to (k-1), the remaining s must be such that s/k == b. So that remaining s is assigned to the last element. Then, the beauty would be sum of (k-1)/k (which is 0) for the first count elements, plus the remaining s divided by k (which is b). Then the total beauty is exactly b. But also, the sum of all elements is (count)*(k-1) + (remaining s) = original s.\n\nBut wait, when they subtract (k-1) from s in each step, that's assuming that each such element is set to (k-1), which contributes (k-1) to the sum. So the total sum is count*(k-1) + (s_remaining), which should equal the original s.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the remaining s_remaining is such that when divided by k, it gives exactly b. Because in the code, the loop checks if s/k equals b. So once s/k equals b, then the remaining s is set as the last element. But that s would be in the range [b*k, (b+1)*k). Because when you divide by k, the floor is b.\n\nWait, but the remaining s after subtracting count*(k-1) must be equal to something that, when divided by k, gives exactly b. So s_remaining >=b*k, because otherwise floor(s_remaining/k) would be less than b. But the code checks if s/k equals b. So after subtracting (k-1) count times, the remaining s must be >= b*k and < (b+1)*k.\n\nWait, no. Because s_remaining divided by k equals b. So floor(s_remaining/k) is b. So s_remaining must be between [b*k, (b+1)*k). So after subtracting count*(k-1), the remaining s must satisfy that.\n\nBut how is this possible? Let's see.\n\nThe original s is the sum we have to reach. The code's approach is to set some elements to (k-1), and the last element to s_remaining. Then, the sum is count*(k-1) + s_remaining = original s.\n\nThe beauty is sum of floor(a_i/k) for each a_i. For the (k-1) elements, their contribution is 0. The last element's contribution is floor(s_remaining/k) = b. So the total beauty is exactly b. So this approach works only if s_remaining is in [b*k, (b+1)*k).\n\nBut how do we get s_remaining? The code subtracts (k-1) from s in each step until s/k equals b. Let me see:\n\nSuppose after subtracting (k-1) count times, the remaining s is s_initial - count*(k-1). The code checks if (s_remaining)/k ==b. So s_remaining must be between b*k and (b+1)*k -1.\n\nWait, but when you subtract (k-1) each time, you are reducing s_remaining by (k-1). So for example, initially s is the original sum. Then, each step subtracts (k-1) and increments count. The loop stops when s/k ==b.\n\nBut let's see an example. Suppose k=6, b=3, s=19. From the sample input.\n\nIn the third test case, n=3. The code checks in the loop:\n\nInitially, s=19. s/k is 3.166..., floor is 3. So 3 ==b (3). So flag is set. Then, count is 0. So the code outputs n elements. For i < n - count -1 (i < 3-0-1=2). So for i=0,1: output 0. Then the last element outputs s=19. Which matches the sample's a = [0,0,19]. Sum is 19, and floor(19/6)=3, others 0. So beauty is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example from the fourth test case: a = [0,3,3,3,29], sum 38. k=5? Wait, no. The sample says k=6? Let me check the sample description. Oh, no, in the fourth test case, the beauty is 7. The array is [0,3,3,3,29]. Sum is 0+3+3+3+29=38. The beauty is (0/6) + (3/6)=0, etc. The last element 29/6=4.833..., floor is 4. Wait, the sample says the beauty is 7? Hmm, maybe I need to check the note. Oh, the fourth test case's note says the beauty is 0+0+0+0+7=7. So k must be 5? Wait, 29 divided by 5 is 5.8, floor 5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the example wrong. Let me not get stuck here.\n\nBack to the code. The code's approach is to set count elements to (k-1), and the last element to s_remaining. Then the sum is count*(k-1) + s_remaining = original s. The beauty is sum of (k-1)/k (0) for count elements, plus s_remaining/k (b). So the total beauty is b.\n\nBut how do we ensure that s_remaining >=0 and that the sum after these steps is correct.\n\nThe code also needs to check that after subtracting (k-1) as many times as possible, the remaining s is such that s/k ==b, and that count <=n-1. Because one element has to be s_remaining. So the number of elements set to (k-1) can be at most n-1. Because the last element is s_remaining.\n\nSo during the loop, in each iteration, we check if s/k equals b. If not, subtract (k-1) and increment count. But wait, why subtract (k-1) each time?\n\nBecause for each (k-1) element, the sum increases by (k-1) but contributes nothing to the beauty. So by allocating some elements as (k-1), we can adjust the remaining sum s_remaining to be such that s_remaining/k equals b.\n\nBut what if after subtracting (k-1) some times, the remaining s is too small?\n\nThe code's loop runs up to n times (since i ranges from 0 to n-1). For each step, if s/k is not equal to b, subtract (k-1) and increase count. But the loop stops as soon as s/k equals b. Then, if after n steps, it hasn't found such s, output -1.\n\nBut how to ensure that this approach is correct.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for a solution to exist.\n\nThe sum of the array is s. The sum of floor(a_i/k) is b.\n\nEach a_i can be written as a_i = x_i *k + r_i, where 0<=r_i <k. Then floor(a_i/k) is x_i. The sum of x_i's is b.\n\nThe sum of a_i's is sum (x_i *k + r_i) =k*sum x_i + sum r_i =k*b + sum r_i.\n\nBut the sum of a_i's is s. So:\n\ns = k*b + sum r_i.\n\nSince sum r_i >=0 and sum r_i <n*k (each r_i <k, sum over n terms). So:\n\n0 <= s -k*b <n*k.\n\nSo for a solution to exist, s must be between k*b and k*b + n*k -1. But wait, sum r_i can be up to n*(k-1). Because each r_i can be at most k-1. So sum r_i <=n(k-1). Therefore:\n\ns =k*b + sum r_i >=k*b.\n\ns =k*b + sum r_i <=k*b +n(k-1).\n\nSo the necessary condition is k*b <= s <=k*b +n(k-1).\n\nIf this is not satisfied, then no solution exists.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of x_i's must be exactly b, where x_i is floor(a_i/k). Each x_i can be any non-negative integer.\n\nBut the code's approach is to set (n-1) elements to (k-1) (r_i =k-1, which contributes x_i=0), and the last element to s_remaining = s - (n-1)(k-1). Then, the x_i for the last element is floor(s_remaining /k). So for that to be b, s_remaining must be between b*k and (b+1)*k -1.\n\nBut s_remaining = s - (count)*(k-1), where count is the number of (k-1) elements (count <=n-1). Wait, the code's loop is trying to find the number of (k-1) elements (count) such that s_remaining/k ==b.\n\nSo let's see. s_remaining must be >=b*k and <= (b+1)k -1.\n\nBut s_remaining = s - count*(k-1).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nb*k <= s - count*(k-1) < (b+1)*k.\n\nRearranged:\n\ns - (b+1)*k +1 <= count*(k-1) < s -b*k.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, count must be such that:\n\ns_remaining = s - count*(k-1) \n\nand b*k <= s_remaining < (b+1)*k.\n\nSo solving for count:\n\ns_remaining >=b*k \u2192 s - count*(k-1) >=b*k \u2192 count*(k-1) <= s -b*k.\n\ns_remaining < (b+1)*k \u2192 s - count*(k-1) < (b+1)*k \u2192 count*(k-1) > s - (b+1)*k.\n\nSo combining:\n\ns - (b+1)*k < count*(k-1) \u2264 s -b*k.\n\nBut count must be a non-negative integer, and count \u2264n-1.\n\nWait, but the code's approach is to subtract (k-1) from s until s/k equals b. Let's see.\n\nSuppose after count steps, s_remaining = s - count*(k-1). Then, s_remaining/k =b.\n\nBut s_remaining/k = (s - count*(k-1))/k =b \u2192 s - count*(k-1) =b*k + r, where 0<=r <k.\n\nWait, but that would imply that (s - count*(k-1))/k =b + r/k, so floor is b. But the code checks if s/k equals b. Wait, no. The code checks if (s_remaining)/k ==b. So in code, the loop checks if s/k equals b. So s_remaining must be >=b*k and < (b+1)*k.\n\nBut how does subtracting (k-1) each time help reach that condition?\n\nFor example, suppose s is very large. Subtract (k-1) each time until s_remaining is in the required range.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to greedily subtract (k-1) from s until s/k becomes b. Let's see:\n\nSuppose original s is 38, k=5, b=7.\n\nWait, that's perhaps the fourth test case. Let's see:\n\nn=5, k=5, b=7, s=38.\n\nWait, but k*b is 35. 35 <=38 <=35 +5*(5-1) \u2192 35 <=38 <=55. So possible.\n\nSo sum of r_i is 38-35=3. So sum of r_i must be 3. So in the code's approach, the code would subtract (k-1) count times, until s_remaining/k is 7.\n\nOriginal s is 38. Let's see:\n\n38 /5 is 7.6 \u2192 floor is 7. So 7 ==b (7). So flag is true. So count is 0. So the code will output all elements as 0 except the last one. But wait, that's not possible. Because sum of the elements would be 38, but the code would set (n-1) elements to 0 and the last to 38. Then the beauty is 38/5=7.6 \u2192 7. Which is correct. But sum is 38. But in that case, the array would be [0,0,0,0,38]. Then sum is 38, beauty is 7. Correct.\n\nBut in the sample explanation for test case 4, the array is [0,3,3,3,29]. So why is that?\n\nAh, maybe in the sample, k is not 5 but 6. Let me check the note again. The fourth test case's note says the array is [0,3,3,3,29], sum 38. Beauty is 7. Let's calculate each a_i /k floor:\n\nAssuming k is 6:\n\n0/6 \u2192 0, 3/6 \u21920, 3/6 \u21920, 3/6\u21920, 29/6 \u21924. So sum is 4. But sample says beauty is 7. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the note again.\n\nThe note says: In the fourth testcase of the example a = [0, 3, 3, 3, 29]. The sum is 38. The beauty is (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 +7) =7. So for the last element, 29 / k =7. So k must be 4. Because 29/4 is 7.25, floor is 7. But then the other elements 3/4 would be 0. Then sum a_i is 0+3+3+3+29=38. So k=4. But in the code, perhaps that's handled differently.\n\nBut perhaps I should not get stuck on the sample here.\n\nBack to the code's approach. The code checks for s_remaining (after subtracting count*(k-1)) divided by k equals b. So s_remaining must be in [b*k, (b+1)*k).\n\nSo for example, if k=6, b=3, s=19. Then s_remaining is 19, which is 3*6 +1. So 19 is in [18,24). So 19/6 is 3.166..., floor is 3. So the code will set count=0, and output all elements except the last as 0. Then last element is 19. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the fourth test case's sample, the code would set count=4 (n-1=4?), but I'm not sure.\n\nBut let's think: in the code, during the loop, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nAt each iteration, check if s/k ==b. If not, subtract (k-1) from s and increment count.\n\nSo let's see for the fourth sample:\n\nAssuming the test case's parameters are n=5, k=4, b=7, s=38.\n\nk*b =28. So 28 <= s=38 <=28 +5*(4-1) \u219228 <=38 <=28 +15=43 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo sum r_i =38-28=10. So sum of r_i is 10. But since each r_i can be up to 3 (k-1=3), and there are 5 elements. So for example, 3+3+3+1+0=10. Then the array would be [0*4 +3, 0*4+3, 0*4+3, 0*4+1, 7*4+0] \u2192 [3,3,3,1,28]. Sum is 3+3+3+1+28=38. Beauty is 0+0+0+0+7=7.\n\nBut the sample's array is different. So there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nBut the code's approach would do:\n\nCheck if s/k =38/4=9.5 \u2192 floor is 9, which is not equal to b=7. So subtract (k-1=3) from s: 38-3=35. count=1.\n\nCheck 35/4=8.75 \u2192 floor 8. Not equal to 7. Subtract 3: 35-3=32. count=2.\n\n32/4=8 \u2192 still not 7. Subtract 3 \u219229. count=3.\n\n29/4=7.25 \u2192 floor 7. Now s_remaining=29. 7 equals b=7. So flag is true. So count=3.\n\nThen, the code will output:\n\nFor i <n - count -1 \u21925-3-1=1. So i<1 \u2192i=0: output 0.\n\nThen i <5-1=4 (since n-1 is 4) \u2192 i=1,2,3: output k-1=3.\n\nThen the last element (i=4) outputs 29.\n\nSo the array is [0,3,3,3,29], sum 0+3+3+3+29=38. Beauty is floor(0/4)+3/4*3 +29/4 \u21920+0+0+0+7=7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAh! So the code's approach works here. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nBut how? The code's loop subtracts (k-1) until s/k ==b. Then, the remaining s is the value of the last element, and count is the number of (k-1) elements. Then, the code outputs (n - count -1) zeros, count (k-1)s, and the last element s_remaining.\n\nWait, the code's output logic is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n   if (i <n - count -1) \u2192 output 0.\n\n   else if (i <n-1) \u2192 output k-1.\n\n   else \u2192 output s_remaining.\n\n}\n\nSo the first (n - count -1) elements are 0, then (count) elements are (k-1), then the last element is s_remaining.\n\nBut wait, the count is the number of (k-1) elements. So (count) elements are (k-1), and the first (n - count -1) elements are 0. But that's (n - count -1) + count +1 =n elements. So correct.\n\nIn the fourth sample's case, count=3, n=5. So first (5-3-1)=1 element is 0. Then 3 elements are (3), and the last element is 29. So [0,3,3,3,29], which is correct.\n\nSo the code's approach is valid.\n\nBut the code has a for loop that runs up to n times. Each time, if s/k !=b, subtracts (k-1). But how can we handle large values? Because for example, if k is 1e9, then subtracting (k-1) could make s negative quickly, leading to problems.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sum s must be >=k*b and <=k*b +n*(k-1). So the code's approach should only subtract (k-1) up to n times. However, if the initial s is too small, subtracting (k-1) could make s negative. For example, if k=2, s=1, and in the loop, subtract 1 each time. So after one step, s=0, but s/k=0. But if b was 0, then that's okay.\n\nBut the code's loop checks if s/k ==b. So in such cases, it's possible.\n\nBut how to ensure that after subtracting (k-1) up to n times, the code can reach s_remaining where s_remaining/k ==b.\n\nWait, but according to the necessary conditions, if the sum s is between k*b and k*b +n*(k-1), then there exists a solution. And the code's approach will find it.\n\nSo let's see. Suppose s is in [k*b, k*b +n*(k-1)].\n\nThen, s =k*b + sum r_i, where sum r_i <=n*(k-1). So sum r_i =s -k*b.\n\nBut the code's approach is to subtract (k-1) as much as possible. So the count is the maximum possible number of (k-1) elements. But perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose sum r_i is 10, and n=5. Each r_i can be at most (k-1). For example, if k=5, then sum r_i can be 10=3+3+4+0+0. So the code's approach would subtract (k-1) (4) three times, making s_remaining = s -3*4 =s -12. Then, s_remaining/k = (k*b +10 -12)/k. But this may not be equal to b.\n\nHmm. Maybe the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is not correct in some cases. For example, when sum r_i is less than (n-1)*(k-1). Then, the code's approach of setting (count) elements to (k-1) may require s_remaining = s - count*(k-1), which is s_remaining =k*b + sum r_i - count*(k-1). And this s_remaining must be >=b*k and < (b+1)*k.\n\nSo:\n\nk*b <= k*b + sum r_i - count*(k-1) <k*b +k.\n\nSubtract k*b from all parts:\n\n0 <= sum r_i - count*(k-1) <k.\n\nRearranged:\n\ncount*(k-1) <= sum r_i < count*(k-1) +k.\n\nSo sum r_i must be in this interval.\n\nBut sum r_i can be any value between 0 and n*(k-1).\n\nBut how to find the count. Let's see:\n\nsum r_i can be written as (count)*(k-1) + rem, where 0<=rem <k.\n\nBut in that case, sum r_i - count*(k-1) =rem. So 0<= rem <k.\n\nSo the code's approach is trying to find count such that sum r_i = count*(k-1) + rem, where rem is in [0, k). And then set the last element to b*k + rem.\n\nWait, but sum r_i is s -k*b. So sum r_i = s -k*b.\n\nSo code's approach subtracts (k-1) from s (equivalent to adding (k-1) to sum r_i?), not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct if the following holds:\n\nsum r_i = count*(k-1) + rem, where rem is in [0, k).\n\nSo the code's loop subtracts (k-1) from s (sum r_i = sum r_i_initial - count*(k-1)), but sum r_i_initial =s -k*b.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, after subtracting count*(k-1) from s (the sum), the remaining s_remaining must be in [b*k, (b+1)*k), which is exactly the condition needed for the last element.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nAfter count steps of subtracting (k-1), the remaining s_remaining is s_initial - count*(k-1). This s_remaining must be in [b*k, (b+1)*k). So:\n\nb*k <= s_initial - count*(k-1) < (b+1)*k.\n\nBut s_initial =k*b + sum r_i_initial (sum r_i_initial =s_initial -k*b).\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe better to think of the code's approach as follows:\n\nThe code tries to find the maximum possible count (up to n-1) such that after subtracting count*(k-1) from s, the remaining is >=b*k and <(b+1)*k.\n\nBut how to find count?\n\nThe code uses a loop that tries to subtract (k-1) up to n times. Each time, it checks if s/k ==b.\n\nBut when you subtract (k-1), s decreases by (k-1). So s/k can decrease by at least (k-1)/k, which is 0.999 for large k.\n\nBut for example, if k is large, say 1e9, then each subtraction of (k-1) reduces s by nearly 1e9. So after a few steps, s could become negative, but the code's loop would stop when s/k ==b.\n\nBut how does this work?\n\nLet's take an example where k=1e9, b=0, s=1e9-1. Then sum r_i =s -k*b =1e9-1. sum r_i is 1e9-1. n is 1e5. The maximum sum r_i is n*(k-1) =1e5*(1e9-1) which is way larger than 1e9-1. So a solution exists. But according to the code's approach, the code will check if s/k ==0. s is 1e9-1. s/k is 0. So flag is true. So count is 0. The code outputs all zeros except the last element. Which is s=1e9-1. But the sum of the array is s=1e9-1. But beauty is floor( (1e9-1)/1e9 )=0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: k=5, b=3, s= 3*5 + 3=18. So sum r_i=3. The code's loop:\n\nInitial s=18. s/k=3.6 \u2192 floor 3. So equals b. So flag is set. count=0. Output 0 elements as 0, then one element 18. So array is [0,0,0,..,18]. Sum 18, beauty 3. Correct.\n\nBut sum r_i=3. So the code's approach would set count=0. But sum r_i=3. So in the code's approach, the remaining s_remaining=18. Then, the last element is 18, which has r_i=18 mod5=3. So yes.\n\nBut according to the code's output logic, the first (n -count -1) elements are 0. So if count is 0, the first n-1 elements are 0, last is 18. So sum is 18. Correct.\n\nSo the code's approach works.\n\nNow, the missing code in the code is the part where for i <n - count -1, the code outputs 0. So the missing code is to output 0 followed by a space.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (i < n - count - 1) {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    } else if (i < n -1) {\n\n        cout << k -1 << \" \";\n\n    } else {\n\n        cout << s << endl;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo for the elements where i <n - count -1, the code needs to output 0. So the missing line is:\n\ncout << 0 << \" \";\n\nSo that those elements are 0.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, n=3, count=0. So n -count -1=2. So i=0,1: output 0. Then the last element is s=19. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the fourth test case, count=3, n=5. n -count -1=5-3-1=1. So i=0: output 0. Then i=1,2,3: output 3. Then i=4: output 29.\n\nSo the missing code is to output 0 followed by a space."
