Even if we found a c early on, we still need to read all the elements to avoid the input getting mixed up with the next test case.\n\nTherefore, even if we find c early, we can't break out of the loop. So the code will read all elements, but whenever any element's count reaches 3, and c is not yet set, set c to that element.\n\nBut then, after all elements are processed, the code checks if any element has count >=3, which could have been done by the code as written.\n\nWait, but in this approach, if during processing the elements, the code sets c to the first element that reaches 3, but there might be other elements with higher counts. For example, if the array is [1,1,1,2,2,2], then the first 1's would set c to 1. Then the code proceeds to read the 2's, but since c is already set, it's not updated. So the output is 1, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the array is [2,2,3,3,3,2], then when the third 3 is read, c is set to 3. Then, the next 2's count would be 3 (since initial count for 2 was 2, adding the third 2 makes it 3), but since c is already set to 3, the code doesn't update it. So the output is 3. But in the array, 2 occurs three times as well. But since the problem allows any output, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the while(ki--) loop should read each element, increment the map count, and check if the count is >=3. If yes and c is still -1, set c to that element.\n\nSo the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nRead x.\n\nIncrement mep[x].\n\nCheck if mep[x] >=3 and c == -1. If yes, set c = x.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nint x;\n\ncin >> x;\n\nmep[x]++;\n\nif (mep[x] >=3 && c == -1) {\n\n    c = x;\n\n}\n\nBut in C++, variables need to be declared. So inside the loop, for each iteration, read x.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nint x; cin >> x;\n\nmep[x]++;\n\nif (mep[x] >=3 && c == -1) {\n\n    c = x;\n\n}\n\nThat's the code that needs to be added.\n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code is the three lines:\n\nint x; cin >> x;\n\nmep[x]++;\n\nif (mep[x] >=3 && c == -1) c = x;\n\nBut in the code, the loop is while(ki--), which runs for each element. So each time, the code reads x, updates the map, checks if the count is 3 or more, and sets c if needed.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, that's the code that should be inserted in the TODO section."
