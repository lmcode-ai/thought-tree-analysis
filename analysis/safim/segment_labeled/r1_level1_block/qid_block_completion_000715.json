Let's take the rating variable. Let's name it r. So inside the loop, I need to read r. So first, add 'int r; cin >> r;'\n\nThen, check the conditions in order. The divisions are ordered from highest to lowest. So first check if r >=1900, then check for division 2 (1600-1899), then division3 (1400-1599), else division4. Wait, but what about the ranges? For example, division2 is 1600 <= r <=1899. So the code could have:\n\nif (r >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n} else if (r >= 1600 && r <= 1899) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n} else if (r >=1400 && r <=1599) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the else if chain, once we check if r >=1900 is false, then the next check can be whether r >=1600, but since the first condition is false, r is <1900. So if r >=1600 here, then it's division2. Because any number between 1600 and 1899 inclusive will satisfy this. So maybe the conditions can be simplified. Let's see:\n\nif (r >=1900) -> division1. Else if (r >=1600) -> division2 (since we know it's <1900 here). Else if (r >=1400) -> division3 (since it's <1600 here). Else -> division4. This way, we don't need to check the upper bounds, because the order of the conditions takes care of that. So for example, after checking division1, the next else if checks if >=1600. Since we are in the else, r is <1900. So if r >=1600 here, then it's between 1600 and 1899. So division2. Similarly, the next else if checks >=1400. Since previous conditions failed (r <1600), so if >=1400, then 1400-1599, division3. Otherwise, division4. Yes, that's a more efficient way. So the code would be:\n\nint r;\ncin >> r;\nif (r >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n} else if (r >= 1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n} else if (r >= 1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n}\n\nThat should cover all cases. Let me test with the sample inputs. Test case 1: -789. So first condition is false. Then >=1600? No. >=1400? No. So else: division4. Correct. Test case 5: 1400. So first two conditions false.
