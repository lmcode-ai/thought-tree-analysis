      "text": "Because each row (horizontal) in the square has height 1. So each row must have a total length of s. So to make a square of size s, we need s rows, each of which has a total length of s. So the total number of 'length units' required is s * s. But each block contributes its length to a row. So the sum of all the lengths of the blocks used must be >= s^2. Because each row uses some blocks that sum to s in length, and there are s rows. So total is s*s. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of the lengths of the first m blocks (for some m <=n) is >= s\u00b2, and also we need to select the blocks in such a way that they can be arranged into s rows each of total length s.\n\nWait, but maybe the selection isn't just sum >= s\u00b2. Because maybe even if the sum is >= s\u00b2, you can't split the blocks into s groups (rows), each with sum >= s. But how do the blocks' lengths affect this arrangement? Since the blocks' lengths are 1,1,2,2,3,3, etc., perhaps the sum of the blocks must be >= s\u00b2, and the sum must be possible to partition into s groups (each group's sum is at least s). But perhaps when sum >= s\u00b2, then it's possible to arrange them. Because sum of s\u00b2 is the minimum required. So perhaps the maximum possible s is the largest s where the total sum of all blocks up to some m is >= s\u00b2, and then m is the number of blocks used. But maybe even using all blocks, the sum is less than s\u00b2. So the problem is to find the maximum s such that the total sum of the first m blocks (for some m <=n) is >= s\u00b2, and find the largest possible s.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the sum of the lengths of the blocks up to n. Let's think. For each block i, length is ceil(i/2). So for i from 1 to n, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's compute this sum. Let's split into even and odd i. For i=1: ceil(1/2)=1. For i=2:1. i=3:2, i=4:2, etc. So for even i (i=2k), ceil(2k/2)=k. For odd i (i=2k-1), ceil((2k-1)/2) = k. So each pair (i=2k-1, i=2k) contributes k +k = 2k. So for n blocks: If n is even, say n=2m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) ) = m(m+1). If n is odd, say n=2m+1. Then the sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Because the first 2m terms sum to m(m+1), and the last term (i=2m+1) is ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1. So the sum is:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 ) ) if n even.\n\nsum = ( (n+1)/2 )^2 if n is odd. Wait, let's check with examples. n=1 (odd). sum is 1. Which is ( (1+1)/2 )\u00b2 = (1)^2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: even. (2/2) * (2/2 +1) =1 *2=2. Correct: 1+1=2.\n\nn=3: odd. (3+1)/2=2. 2\u00b2=4. sum is 1+1+2=4. Correct.\n\nn=4 even. (4/2)*(4/2+1) =2*3=6. 1+1+2+2=6. Correct. n=5: (5+1)/2=3. 3\u00b2=9. sum 1+1+2+2+3=9. Correct. So the formula for sum S(n) is:\n\nif n is even: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd: S(n) = ( (n+1)/2 )^2\n\nSo S(n) can be written as floor( (n+1)/2 ) * ceil( (n+1)/2 ) Wait, for even n: (n+1)/2 is (even+1)/2. For example, n=2: (3)/2=1.5. floor is 1, ceil is 2. product 1*2=2. Which matches even case. For n=3: (4)/2=2, floor and ceil are 2 and 2. product 4. Which matches. So S(n) = floor((n+1)/2) * ceil( (n+1)/2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to ((n+1)//2) * ((n+2)//2). Because (n+1)/2 is either integer or .5. So for even n: (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 = k + 0.5. So floor is k, ceil is k+1. So product k*(k+1). For odd n: (n+1) is even. (n+1)/2 is integer. So product is k*k where k is (n+1)/2. So S(n) = k * m, where k = (n+1)//2 and m = (n+2)//2. But regardless, the sum S(n) can be calculated as the total sum of all blocks up to n. But the problem allows using any subset of the blocks. Wait, no. The problem states that you can use any subset of the blocks, not necessarily contiguous. But the sum of their lengths must be >= s\u00b2, and the maximum s possible. Wait, but the blocks can be selected in any order. So the sum of the lengths of the selected blocks must be >= s\u00b2. But then, since we can choose any subset of the blocks, the maximum sum possible is the sum of all n blocks. So the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that s\u00b2 <= S(n).",

So the maximum possible s is floor( sqrt(sum) ). But in this case, the sum can be as large as S(n). So the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S(n). But wait, is that correct? Wait, let's take an example. Let's say S(n) is 9 (like n=5). Then sqrt(9)=3, so maximum s is 3. If S(n) is 10, sqrt(10) is approx 3.16, so floor is 3. But 3^2 is 9 <=10, and 4^2 is 16>10. So maximum s is 3. Yes. So the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of the maximum possible sum, which is S(n). So the problem reduces to: For a given n, compute S(n) as the sum of all blocks (since using all gives maximum sum). Then compute the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= S(n). So s = floor( sqrt(S(n)) ) So for each test case, compute S(n), then compute the integer square root of S(n). So how to compute S(n):\n\nAs per earlier, for even n: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) For odd n: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, S(n) can be written as (k)*(k) when n is odd (since (n+1)/2 is k, and k squared). And when even, it's k*(k+1), where k is n/2. So for example, when n is 5 (odd), S(n) is 3\u00b2=9. Now, the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))). But let's see:\n\nFor even n: S(n) = k*(k+1), where k =n/2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor is k. So s =k. But for example, k=2 (n=4), sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)~2.449, floor is 2. But 2^2=4 <=6, and 3^2=9>6. So maximum s is 2. But k is 2 (n=4). So s=k=2. Similarly, for odd n: S(n) =k\u00b2. Then sqrt(k\u00b2)=k. So s=k.\n\nFor example, n=5, k=3. s=3. So for even n:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( k*(k+1) ) ) But k*(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So the floor is k. So s =k.\n\nWhich is n/2. So for even n, s =n/2. For example, n=4: s=2. For even n=2: sum is 2. sqrt(2)=1.414, floor 1. But according to the code above, n=2, even, k=1. s=1. Which matches. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement:\n\nSample input 2 is n=5, which gives s=3. Sample input 2's output is 3, which matches. Another example: when n=2, sum is 2. s is floor(sqrt(2))=1. Which matches the first sample input where n=1 has sum 1, s=1. So combining all:\n\nFor even n:\n\ns = n/2. For odd n:\n\ns = (n+1)/2. Wait, but wait:\n\nWait when n is even:\n\nsum is k*(k+1) where k =n/2. s = floor(sqrt(k*(k+1)))). But k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k < (k+1)^2. sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is less than k+1. So floor is k. So for even n, s= k= n/2. For odd n:\n\nsum is k\u00b2, where k= (n+1)/2. So s= k.\n\nSo regardless of even or odd, s is (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even?\n\nWait, but wait. Let's see for even n=6. n=6 is even. k=3. sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. So s=3. Which is 6/2=3. Yes. Another example: n=5, odd. sum=3\u00b2=9. s=3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. So the maximum s is (n+1)//2? Wait, for even n:\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=2.5. floor is 2, which matches s=2. Wait, perhaps the maximum s can be written as floor( (n+1)/2 ). Wait for even n:\n\nn=2: (2+1)/2=1.5. floor is 1. Which is correct. n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5. floor is 2. Which is correct. For odd n:\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2. So floor is 2. sum is 4. s=2. Correct. n=5: (5+1)/2=3. sum is 9. s=3. Correct. So s is the floor of (n+1)/2. But wait, for even n:\n\nn=6: (6+1)/2=3.5. floor is 3. Which matches 6/2=3. So yes. So the formula for s is s = floor( (n+1)/2 ) ? But wait, wait. Let's check for even n=2. Sum is 2. s is 1, which is (2+1)/2=1.5, floor is 1. Correct. So yes. So the maximum s is floor( (n+1)/2 )? But wait, this would imply that for even and odd n, s is (n+1)//2. Because (n+1)/2, when n is even, becomes (even +1)/2 = odd/2. So (n+1)/2 for even n is (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5. So floor is k. For example, n=4: (5)/2=2.5, floor is 2. Which is n/2=2. But for even n, floor( (n+1)/2 ) = floor( (2k +1)/2 ) =k. So yes. So s can be written as (n+1)//2 in integer division. Wait, in Java, integer division of (n+1)/2 when n is even:\n\nn is even. Let's say n=4. (4+1)/2=5/2=2 in Java (since 5/2 is 2 when using integer division). Wait, n=4 is even. (n+1)/2=5/2=2.5. But integer division in Java truncates towards zero. So (4+1)/2 is 2. So (n+1)/2 when n even is (2k +1)/2 =k.5. So integer division gives k.\n\nWhich is same as floor((n+1)/2). So for even n:\n\ns= (n+1)/2 (integer division) equals k. For example, n=4: 4+1=5/2=2 (integer division). Which is correct. So regardless of even or odd, s is (n+1)/2, using integer division.\n\nWait for n=5 (odd):\n\n5+1=6/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=3 (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=2 (even): (2+1)/2=1. Correct. So s is (n+1)//2. So the maximum possible s is (n+1)//2. Wait, but how does that make sense? Let's check the sum and s.\n\nFor example, n=5: sum is 9. s is 3. 3\u00b2=9. Correct. n=6, even. sum is 3*4=12. s=3 +1//2= (6+1)/2=3.5 in integer division (Java) is 3. So s=3. s\u00b2=9 < =12. So that's correct. n=7 (odd): (7+1)/2=4. sum is 4\u00b2=16. s=4. 16=16. Correct. n=8 even: sum is 4*5=20. s= (8+1)/2=4.5 -> 4 in integer division. s\u00b2=16 <=20. So yes. But wait, 4\u00b2 is 16, which is less than 20. So perhaps there's a way to get a higher s. But according to the earlier logic, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), which for S(n)=20, sqrt(20) is ~4.47. So floor is 4. So maximum s is 4. But according to the formula (n+1)/2, when n=8, (8+1)/2=4.5, integer division gives 4, which matches. So the formula holds. So this suggests that the maximum s is indeed (n+1)/2 when using integer division. So regardless of even or odd, s is (n+1)/2. But wait, how does this hold when sum is (n+1)/2 squared when n is odd, and when even, sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1). Let's see. For even n=2k: sum =k*(k+1). s= (2k +1)/2 in integer division. Which is k. So s=k. Then s\u00b2=k\u00b2. But sum is k(k+1)=k\u00b2 +k. So s\u00b2 <= sum. So yes, since k\u00b2 <=k\u00b2 +k. So s=k is valid. But could there be a larger s?\n\nNo, because s+1 is k+1. (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2+2k+1. sum is k(k+1)=k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2+2k+1 when k>0. So s can't be k+1. Thus, the maximum s is k, which is (2k)/2= k. Which is (n+1)/2 in integer division. Because (2k +1)/2 is k.5, which when integer divided by 2 is k. So yes. So the formula s=(n+1)//2 works for all n. So the code needs to compute s = (n+1)/2 using integer division (since Java truncates towards zero, but (n+1) is even when n is odd, so for odd n, (n+1)/2 is integer.",

So the code in the main loop is:\n\nlong n = sc.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( (n +1)/2 ); Wait, but in Java, when you divide two integers, it does integer division. For example, 5/2 is 2. But for n up to 1e9, (n+1) can be up to 1e9+1, which is within the range of int (which is up to 2e9). So for n up to 1e9, n can be stored as an int. But when n is 1e9, (n+1) is 1e9+1, which is 1,000,000,001. So when you store it as an int, that would overflow. Because the maximum int is 2^31-1 =2,147,483,647. So 1e9 is 1,000,000,000, which is less than that. So 1e9+1 is 1,000,000,001, which is less than 2e9. So when using int, it's okay. But Java's int is 32-bit signed, so maximum is 2^31-1=2,147,483,647. So if n is up to 1e9, which is 1,000,000,000, then n+1 is 1e9+1 which is under 2^30 (1,073,741,824) plus, but still within int's capacity. So yes, n can be read as an int.

So using int n = sc.nextInt(); then (n+1)/2 is 500,000,000, which is also valid as an int. But when n is 1e9, (n+1)/2 is 500,000,000, which is within int's capacity (since int can go up to 2e9). So yes. But in the code, the original code reads t as an int. So the missing code would be: For each test case:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println( (n +1)/2 ); But wait, what if n is 1e9. Then (n+1) is 1e9+1. (1e9+1)/2 is 500,000,000.5, which as an integer is 500,000,000. So in Java, if n is an int, then (n+1)/2 is computed as integer division. So for n=1e9, stored as an int, adding 1 gives 1e9+1, which is stored as an int (since 1e9+1 is less than 2^30). Then divided by 2, it's 5e8. Thus, the code can be written as:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1e9, which is within the int range. Yes. But in Java, if n is read as an int, then (n+1) is calculated as an int. So for n=1e9, (n+1) is 1,000,000,001, which is still within the int range (since 2^31-1 is 2,147,483,647). So yes, 1e9+1 is 1,000,000,001 which is less than 2,147,483,647. So it fits. Thus, the code for each test case is to read n as an integer, compute (n+1)/2, and output that. So the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nlong n = sc.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( (n +1)/2 ); But in Java, the division is integer division. So whether you read as long or int, it's the same.",

But in the original code, the user is using Scanner, which reads nextInt() as an int, but for very large numbers (which 1e9 is not), it's better to read as long.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be made using n blocks. Each block has a height of 1 unit, and the length is ceil(i/2) where i is the block's number. So for i from 1 to n, each block's length is ceil(i/2). \n\nWait, right. So the i-th block's length is ceiling of i divided by 2. For example, when i is 1, it's 1/2=0.5, ceil to 1. i=2 is 1, i=3 is 2, etc. So the blocks' lengths go like 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4... etc. \n\nThe square's side length is s. The total area of the blocks used must be at least s^2, but since each block is 1 unit high, when arranged, the total length contributed by each block is (1 * length) per block. But wait, how are the blocks arranged? Oh right, since each is height 1, to form a square of side s, we need to have s rows, each of which contributes to the length s. So the sum of the lengths of the blocks in each row must be >= s. Wait, no. Because each row (horizontal) in the square has height 1. So each row must have a total length of s. So to make a square of size s, we need s rows, each of which has a total length of s. So the total number of 'length units' required is s * s. But each block contributes its length to a row. So the sum of all the lengths of the blocks used must be >= s^2. Because each row uses some blocks that sum to s in length, and there are s rows. So total is s*s. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of the lengths of the first m blocks (for some m <=n) is >= s\u00b2, and also we need to select the blocks in such a way that they can be arranged into s rows each of total length s.\n\nWait, but maybe the selection isn't just sum >= s\u00b2. Because maybe even if the sum is >= s\u00b2, you can't split the blocks into s groups (rows), each with sum >= s. But how do the blocks' lengths affect this arrangement? Since the blocks' lengths are 1,1,2,2,3,3, etc., perhaps the sum of the blocks must be >= s\u00b2, and the sum must be possible to partition into s groups (each group's sum is at least s). But perhaps when sum >= s\u00b2, then it's possible to arrange them. Because sum of s\u00b2 is the minimum required. So perhaps the maximum possible s is the largest s where the total sum of all blocks up to some m is >= s\u00b2, and then m is the number of blocks used. But maybe even using all blocks, the sum is less than s\u00b2. So the problem is to find the maximum s such that the total sum of the first m blocks (for some m <=n) is >= s\u00b2, and find the largest possible s.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the sum of the lengths of the blocks up to n. Let's think. For each block i, length is ceil(i/2). So for i from 1 to n, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's compute this sum.\n\nLet's split into even and odd i. For i=1: ceil(1/2)=1. For i=2:1. i=3:2, i=4:2, etc. So for even i (i=2k), ceil(2k/2)=k. For odd i (i=2k-1), ceil((2k-1)/2) = k. So each pair (i=2k-1, i=2k) contributes k +k = 2k. So for n blocks:\n\nIf n is even, say n=2m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) ) = m(m+1).\n\nIf n is odd, say n=2m+1. Then the sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Because the first 2m terms sum to m(m+1), and the last term (i=2m+1) is ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 ) ) if n even.\n\nsum = ( (n+1)/2 )^2 if n is odd.\n\nWait, let's check with examples.\n\nn=1 (odd). sum is 1. Which is ( (1+1)/2 )\u00b2 = (1)^2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: even. (2/2) * (2/2 +1) =1 *2=2. Correct: 1+1=2.\n\nn=3: odd. (3+1)/2=2. 2\u00b2=4. sum is 1+1+2=4. Correct.\n\nn=4 even. (4/2)*(4/2+1) =2*3=6. 1+1+2+2=6. Correct.\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3. 3\u00b2=9. sum 1+1+2+2+3=9. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for sum S(n) is:\n\nif n is even: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd: S(n) = ( (n+1)/2 )^2\n\nSo S(n) can be written as floor( (n+1)/2 ) * ceil( (n+1)/2 )\n\nWait, for even n: (n+1)/2 is (even+1)/2. For example, n=2: (3)/2=1.5. floor is 1, ceil is 2. product 1*2=2. Which matches even case.\n\nFor n=3: (4)/2=2, floor and ceil are 2 and 2. product 4. Which matches.\n\nSo S(n) = floor((n+1)/2) * ceil( (n+1)/2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to ((n+1)//2) * ((n+2)//2). Because (n+1)/2 is either integer or .5. So for even n: (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 = k + 0.5. So floor is k, ceil is k+1. So product k*(k+1). For odd n: (n+1) is even. (n+1)/2 is integer. So product is k*k where k is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo S(n) = k * m, where k = (n+1)//2 and m = (n+2)//2.\n\nBut regardless, the sum S(n) can be calculated as the total sum of all blocks up to n. But the problem allows using any subset of the blocks. Wait, no. The problem states that you can use any subset of the blocks, not necessarily contiguous. But the sum of their lengths must be >= s\u00b2, and the maximum s possible.\n\nWait, but the blocks can be selected in any order. So the sum of the lengths of the selected blocks must be >= s\u00b2. But then, since we can choose any subset of the blocks, the maximum sum possible is the sum of all n blocks. So the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that s\u00b2 <= S(n). Because if you take all blocks, their sum is S(n), and the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ). But wait, is that the case?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because even if S(n) is >= s\u00b2, perhaps there's a subset of the blocks that sum to s\u00b2. For example, maybe using some blocks and not others allows for a higher s. But since the sum of the selected subset can't exceed S(n), the maximum possible sum is S(n). So the maximum possible s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 <= S(n). Because even if the sum is s\u00b2, then s is possible. If sum is greater, like s\u00b2 + k, then maybe s can be higher. Wait, no. Because if sum is s\u00b2 +k, but k < 2s+1, then the maximum s would be s, because (s+1)^2 is s\u00b2 +2s+1. So if sum is s\u00b2 +k, where k <2s+1, then the sum is less than (s+1)^2. So the maximum possible s is floor( sqrt(sum) ). \n\nBut in this case, the sum can be as large as S(n). So the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S(n). But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's say S(n) is 9 (like n=5). Then sqrt(9)=3, so maximum s is 3.\n\nIf S(n) is 10, sqrt(10) is approx 3.16, so floor is 3. But 3^2 is 9 <=10, and 4^2 is 16>10. So maximum s is 3.\n\nYes. So the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of the maximum possible sum, which is S(n).\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor a given n, compute S(n) as the sum of all blocks (since using all gives maximum sum). Then compute the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= S(n). So s = floor( sqrt(S(n)) )\n\nSo for each test case, compute S(n), then compute the integer square root of S(n).\n\nSo how to compute S(n):\n\nAs per earlier, for even n: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nFor odd n: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, S(n) can be written as (k)*(k) when n is odd (since (n+1)/2 is k, and k squared). And when even, it's k*(k+1), where k is n/2.\n\nSo for example, when n is 5 (odd), S(n) is 3\u00b2=9.\n\nNow, the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))).\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFor even n: S(n) = k*(k+1), where k =n/2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor is k.\n\nSo s =k.\n\nBut for example, k=2 (n=4), sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)~2.449, floor is 2.\n\nBut 2^2=4 <=6, and 3^2=9>6. So maximum s is 2.\n\nBut k is 2 (n=4). So s=k=2.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n: S(n) =k\u00b2. Then sqrt(k\u00b2)=k. So s=k.\n\nFor example, n=5, k=3. s=3.\n\nSo for even n:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( k*(k+1) ) )\n\nBut k*(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So the floor is k.\n\nSo s =k.\n\nWhich is n/2.\n\nSo for even n, s =n/2.\n\nFor example, n=4: s=2.\n\nFor even n=2: sum is 2. sqrt(2)=1.414, floor 1. But according to the code above, n=2, even, k=1. s=1. Which matches.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement:\n\nSample input 2 is n=5, which gives s=3.\n\nSample input 2's output is 3, which matches.\n\nAnother example: when n=2, sum is 2. s is floor(sqrt(2))=1. Which matches the first sample input where n=1 has sum 1, s=1.\n\nSo combining all:\n\nFor even n:\n\ns = n/2.\n\nFor odd n:\n\ns = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nWait when n is even:\n\nsum is k*(k+1) where k =n/2.\n\ns = floor(sqrt(k*(k+1)))).\n\nBut k*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k < (k+1)^2.\n\nsqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is less than k+1. So floor is k.\n\nSo for even n, s= k= n/2.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nsum is k\u00b2, where k= (n+1)/2. So s= k.\n\nSo regardless of even or odd, s is (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even?\n\nWait, but wait. Let's see for even n=6.\n\nn=6 is even. k=3. sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. So s=3. Which is 6/2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=5, odd. sum=3\u00b2=9. s=3. Which is (5+1)/2=3.\n\nSo the maximum s is (n+1)//2?\n\nWait, for even n:\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=2.5. floor is 2, which matches s=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum s can be written as floor( (n+1)/2 ).\n\nWait for even n:\n\nn=2: (2+1)/2=1.5. floor is 1. Which is correct.\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=2.5. floor is 2. Which is correct.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2. So floor is 2. sum is 4. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3. sum is 9. s=3. Correct.\n\nSo s is the floor of (n+1)/2. But wait, for even n:\n\nn=6: (6+1)/2=3.5. floor is 3. Which matches 6/2=3.\n\nSo yes. So the formula for s is s = floor( (n+1)/2 ) ?\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's check for even n=2. Sum is 2. s is 1, which is (2+1)/2=1.5, floor is 1. Correct.\n\nSo yes. So the maximum s is floor( (n+1)/2 )? But wait, this would imply that for even and odd n, s is (n+1)//2. Because (n+1)/2, when n is even, becomes (even +1)/2 = odd/2. So (n+1)/2 for even n is (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5. So floor is k. For example, n=4: (5)/2=2.5, floor is 2. Which is n/2=2.\n\nBut for even n, floor( (n+1)/2 ) = floor( (2k +1)/2 )=k. So yes. So s can be written as (n+1)//2 in integer division.\n\nWait, in Java, integer division of (n+1)/2 when n is even:\n\nn is even. Let's say n=4. (4+1)/2=5/2=2 in Java (since 5/2 is 2 when using integer division).\n\nWait, n=4 is even. (n+1)/2=5/2=2.5. But integer division in Java truncates towards zero. So (4+1)/2 is 2. So (n+1)/2 when n even is (2k +1)/2 =k.5. So integer division gives k.\n\nWhich is same as floor((n+1)/2).\n\nSo for even n:\n\ns= (n+1)/2 (integer division) equals k. For example, n=4: 4+1=5/2=2 (integer division). Which is correct.\n\nSo regardless of even or odd, s is (n+1)/2, using integer division.\n\nWait for n=5 (odd):\n\n5+1=6/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=3 (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=2 (even): (2+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nSo s is (n+1)//2. So the maximum possible s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but how does that make sense? Let's check the sum and s.\n\nFor example, n=5: sum is 9. s is 3. 3\u00b2=9. Correct.\n\nn=6, even. sum is 3*4=12. s=3+1//2= (6+1)/2=3.5 in integer division (Java) is 3. So s=3. s\u00b2=9 <=12. So that's correct.\n\nn=7 (odd): (7+1)/2=4. sum is 4\u00b2=16. s=4. 16=16. Correct.\n\nn=8 even: sum is 4*5=20. s= (8+1)/2=4.5 -> 4 in integer division. s\u00b2=16 <=20. So yes.\n\nBut wait, 4\u00b2 is 16, which is less than 20. So perhaps there's a way to get a higher s. But according to the earlier logic, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), which for S(n)=20, sqrt(20) is ~4.47. So floor is 4. So maximum s is 4. But according to the formula (n+1)/2, when n=8, (8+1)/2=4.5, integer division gives 4, which matches. So the formula holds.\n\nSo this suggests that the maximum s is indeed (n+1)/2 when using integer division. So regardless of even or odd, s is (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, how does this hold when sum is (n+1)/2 squared when n is odd, and when even, sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1). Let's see.\n\nFor even n=2k: sum =k*(k+1). s= (2k +1)/2 in integer division. Which is k. So s=k. Then s\u00b2=k\u00b2. But sum is k(k+1)=k\u00b2 +k. So s\u00b2 <= sum. So yes, since k\u00b2 <=k\u00b2 +k. So s=k is valid. But could there be a larger s?\n\nNo, because s+1 is k+1. (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2+2k+1. sum is k(k+1)=k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2+2k+1 when k>0. So s can't be k+1.\n\nThus, the maximum s is k, which is (2k)/2= k. Which is (n+1)/2 in integer division. Because (2k +1)/2 is k.5, which when integer divided by 2 is k.\n\nSo yes. So the formula s=(n+1)//2 works for all n.\n\nSo the code needs to compute s = (n+1)/2 using integer division (since Java truncates towards zero, but (n+1) is even when n is odd, so for odd n, (n+1)/2 is integer. For even n, (n+1)/2 is a .5 which when integer divided gives the floor).\n\nSo the code is for each test case, read n, compute (n+1)/2 (using integer division) and output that.\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input given in the problem.\n\nSample input 2 is n=5. Output is 3. (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nSample input 1 is n=1. Output is 1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother sample in the problem's note is n=2, output 1. (2+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nBut wait, in the second test case (n=5), the sum is 9, which is 3^2. So s=3.\n\nAnother example: n=6. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. s\u00b2=9 <=12. But 4^2 is 16>12. So maximum s is 3. Which is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3.\n\nYes. So the code can be written as simply outputting (n+1)/2 for each test case.\n\nWait, but in Java, when you do (n+1)/2 for a long n (since n can be up to 1e9, which is within int range, but when multiplied in sum, but no, in the code, the problem is just to compute (n+1)/2. For example, when n is 1e9, (1e9 +1)/2 is 500,000,000.5, which when integer divided by 2 becomes 5e8. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Java, for integer n, (n+1)/2 when n is even:\n\nFor example, n=4: (4+1)/2=5/2=2 (since integer division truncates towards zero). So yes, correct.\n\nSo the code can be as simple as for each test case, output (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nWait for even n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 1. Correct.\n\nn=6: (6+1)/2=3.5 \u21923. Correct.\n\nYes. So the formula holds.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nFor each test case, read n and output (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, this seems too simple. But according to the analysis, yes.\n\nBut why is that possible? Because the maximum sum S(n) is (n+1)//2 * ((n+1)//2 + (n even or odd)).\n\nWait, but according to the sum formula, for even n, S(n) is k*(k+1), where k=n/2. For example, n=4, k=2, sum 2*3=6. s=2. sqrt(6)=2.449, floor is 2. Which is k. For even n, s is k= n/2. Which is (n+1)/2 when integer divided.\n\nWait, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5, integer division gives 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code is simply outputting (n+1)/2. So in Java, that's (n +1)/2. Because Java uses integer division.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nFor each test case, read n, compute (n+1)/2 and print it.\n\nBut let's test with the examples.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1. Output 1. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3. Output 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case, n=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. sum is 3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 \u226412. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7. (7+1)/2=4. sum is 4\u00b2=16. s=4. Correct.\n\nn=8 \u2192 (8+1)/2=4.5 \u21924. sum is4*5=20. s=4. 4\u00b2=16 \u226420. Correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code in the main loop is:\n\nlong n = sc.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( (n +1)/2 );\n\nWait, but in Java, when you divide two integers, it does integer division. For example, 5/2 is 2.\n\nBut for n up to 1e9, (n+1) can be up to 1e9+1, which is within the range of int (which is up to 2e9). So for n up to 1e9, n can be stored as an int. But when n is 1e9, (n+1) is 1e9+1, which is 1,000,000,001. So when you store it as an int, that would overflow. Because the maximum int is 2^31-1 =2,147,483,647. So 1e9 is 1,000,000,000, which is less than that. So 1e9+1 is 1,000,000,001, which is less than 2e9. So when using int, it's okay. But Java's int is 32-bit signed, so maximum is 2^31-1=2,147,483,647. So if n is up to 1e9, which is 1,000,000,000, then n+1 is 1e9+1 which is under 2^30 (1,073,741,824) plus, but still within int's capacity. So yes, n can be read as an int.\n\nWait, but 1e9 is 10^9, which is 1,000,000,000. Which is less than 2^30 (1,073,741,824) is 2^30 is about 1e9. So 1e9 is within the range of int.\n\nBut when you compute (n +1) for n=1e9, that's 1,000,000,001, which is less than 2^30 (since 2^30 is 1,073,741,824). So yes, that's within int's capacity.\n\nBut the problem says n can be up to 1e9. So for n in Java, using int is okay. Because 1e9 is within the integer's max value.\n\nBut when the code reads n as an int, but then when we compute (n+1)/2, the calculation is done in integer arithmetic.\n\nBut let's see: when n is 1e9, (n+1) is 1e9+1. Divided by 2, it's 500,000,000.5, but in integer division, it's 500,000,000.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nlong n = sc.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nWait, but in Java, if n is read as an int, then for very large n (like 1e9), but that's within the int's limit. So in code:\n\nBut in the given code, the user is using:\n\nint t=sc.nextInt();\nwhile(t-->0){\n   /* process each test case */\n}\n\nSo the code for each test case would be:\n\nlong n = sc.nextLong(); // but n can be up to 1e9, so can be read as int.\n// but in Java, using nextInt() for n would also work. Then (n+1)/2 would be computed as int.\n\nWait, but for n=1e9, which is 1,000,000,000, when stored as int, it's valid. So using int n = sc.nextInt(); then (n+1)/2 is 500,000,000, which is also valid as an int.\n\nBut when n is 1e9, (n+1)/2 is 500,000,000, which is within int's capacity (since int can go up to 2e9). So yes.\n\nBut in the code, the original code reads t as an int. So the missing code would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println( (n +1)/2 );\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1e9. Then (n+1) is 1e9+1. (1e9+1)/2 is 500,000,000.5, which as an integer is 500,000,000. So in Java, if n is an int, then (n+1)/2 is computed as integer division. So for n=1e9, stored as an int, adding 1 gives 1e9+1, which is stored as an int (since 1e9+1 is less than 2^30). Then divided by 2, it's 5e8.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1e9, which is within the int range. Yes.\n\nBut in Java, if n is read as an int, then (n+1) is calculated as an int. So for n=1e9, (n+1) is 1,000,000,001, which is still within the int range (since 2^31-1 is 2,147,483,647). So yes, 1e9+1 is 1,000,000,001 which is less than 2,147,483,647. So it fits.\n\nThus, the code for each test case is to read n as an integer, compute (n+1)/2, and output that.\n\nSo the missing code inside the loop is:\n\nlong n = sc.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( (n +1)/2 );\n\nBut in Java, the division is integer division. So whether you read as long or int, it's the same. For example, if n is read as a long, then (n+1) is a long, divided by 2 with integer division.\n\nBut in the original code, the user is using Scanner, which reads nextInt() as an int, but for very large numbers (which 1e9 is not), it's better to read as long. But given that n is up to 1e9, int is sufficient.\n\nBut in Java, when you have (n+1)/2, if n is read as int, and (n+1) exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE, but in this problem, n is up to 1e9. 1e9+1 is 1,000,000,001, which is less than Integer.MAX_VALUE (2,147,483,647). So using int is okay.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println( (n +1)/2 );\n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is:\n\nint n=sc.nextInt();\nSystem.out.println( (n+1)/2 );\n\nSo for each test case, read n and output (n+1)/2.\n\nThat's the solution."
