  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the Java code for this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining for each day's rain whether removing it prevents a flood. A flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds m. The main challenge is efficiently calculating the effect of each rain removal without simulating all possibilities directly, which would be too slow given the constraints.\n\nThe existing code seems to use a sweep line algorithm. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nIn the main loop for each test case:\n\n- They read n and m, then read each x_i and p_i.\n- They add x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i to a priority queue 'a' (probably the events for the sweep line), and x_i to another queue 'd' (maybe for something else?).\n- Then there's a loop processing events from 'a' and 'd', tracking 'rate' (the number of active intervals contributing to the rainfall), and calculating 'water' (the current accumulated rainfall at some position?).\n\nWait, the way they process events might be tracking the maximum possible accumulated rainfall. Because the accumulated a_j is the sum over each rain i of max(0, p_i - |x_i -j|). This forms a function that's a sum of V-shaped curves. The maximum of this function could be found by analyzing critical points where the slope changes.\n\nThe code then computes variables 'l' and 'r', which I'm guessing represent the left and right maximums of the accumulated rainfall. The idea is that after removing a particular rain i, the maximum possible a_j must be <= m. To check this for each i, they need to subtract the contribution of that rain and see if the remaining maximum is under m.\n\nBut how do they track l and r? Let's see. The code initializes 'l' and 'r' to some values and updates them when the current 'water' exceeds m. The variables 'lpos' and 'rpos' might be the positions where the maximum occurs.\n\nIn the final loop for each i, they check two conditions: subtracting the contribution of the i-th rain from both l and r. If both adjusted values are <=m, then output 1, else 0.\n\nWait, but the code as written uses l and r as the maximum values before considering the removal of the i-th rain. So when they remove the i-th rain, the maximum possible a_j would be the original maximum minus the contribution of that rain at the positions lpos and rpos. But is that correct?\n\nHmm. The problem is that the maximum of the entire function after removing the i-th rain might be at a different position. So just checking the previous l and r positions might not be sufficient. But perhaps the code's approach is based on the fact that the original maximums (before removal) are the points where the contribution of the i-th rain is significant, so subtracting those contributions would ensure that the new maximum is under m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original code is trying to compute the maximum possible a_j after removing the i-th rain by considering the original maximum positions and subtracting the contribution of the i-th rain there. However, this approach might not cover all possibilities, leading to incorrect results.\n\nBut according to the code's current logic, for each i, they check if after removing the i-th day's rain, the maximum at lpos (adjusted by that rain's contribution) is <=m and similarly for rpos. If both are true, then the answer is 1. Otherwise, 0.\n\nBut how are l and r computed in the original code? Let's see:\n\nThe code processes the events in order. 'water' seems to represent the accumulated rainfall at the current position as they sweep through events. When the water exceeds m, they update l and r. Wait, the code has:\n\nif(water>m && water - now - l + lpos >=0) { ... }\n\nNot sure. Maybe this part is incorrect. Let's think through the logic.\n\nThe code is processing events in the order of increasing position. Each event is either the start of a rain's influence (x_i - p_i) or the peak (x_i) or the end (x_i + p_i). Wait, no. The 'a' queue contains x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i, which are the start and end points of the influence of each rain. The 'd' queue contains x_i, which might be the peak point where the slope changes from +1 to -1.\n\nWait, the contribution of a single rain is a triangular shape: starting at x_i - p_i, increasing by 1 per position until x_i, then decreasing by 1 until x_i + p_i. So the sweep line approach would track the rate of change (slope) of the accumulated rainfall as we move along positions. Each start (x_i - p_i) adds +1 to the slope, each end (x_i + p_i) adds -1, but the peak (x_i) might be where the slope changes from +1 to -1, but that's already accounted for by the start and end points. Wait, perhaps the code is using a different approach. The events are the start and end points (x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i), and the code tracks the current slope (rate). Then, between two events, the slope is constant, so the accumulated rainfall increases by rate * (current position - previous position).\n\nBut wait, in the code, the 'a' queue has all the start and end points of the rains, and 'd' queue has x_i. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Because the original approach would require all critical points where the slope changes, which are x_i - p_i (adds +1), x_i (changes from +1 to -1, so adds -2), and x_i + p_i (adds +1). But that's not how the code is handling it.\n\nWait, in the code, they add x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i to 'a', and x_i to 'd'. Then, during the processing, when the next event is from 'a' (a start or end point) or 'd' (x_i), the code adjusts the rate. But the original approach of adding x_i to 'd' and handling it as a separate event may not be correct. Because the slope changes at x_i from +1 to -1, which is a decrease by 2. So perhaps the correct events are the start (x_i - p_i), peak (x_i), and end (x_i + p_i) points. But the code's approach adds start and end to 'a' and x_i to 'd'. Then, during the processing, when an event is from 'd', it's an x_i, which contributes a slope change of -2.\n\nBut maybe the code is correct. Let's see: the initial rate is 1. When we process x_i - p_i (from 'a'), we add 1 to the rate. Then, when we process x_i (from 'd'), we subtract 2. Then, when processing x_i + p_i (from 'a'), we add 1. So the slope changes are correct. For a single rain, the slope is +1 from x_i - p_i to x_i, then -1 from x_i to x_i + p_i. Wait, but the rate after x_i - p_i is increased by 1, so between x_i - p_i and x_i, the rate is 1 (since initially 1, then adding 1 at the start). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's setup for the events is incorrect. Let's think: each rain contributes to the slope as follows. The function for a rain's contribution is a triangle that increases from x_i - p_i to x_i (slope +1), then decreases from x_i to x_i + p_i (slope -1). The slope changes at x_i - p_i (+1), x_i (-2), and x_i + p_i (+1). So the events should be these three points. But in the code, for each rain, they add x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i to 'a', and x_i to 'd'. So during processing, the events are sorted, and when you process x_i - p_i, you add +1 to rate. Then when you process x_i, you subtract 2. Then when you process x_i + p_i, you add +1. So the slope changes correctly.\n\nSo when the code processes events in order, 'a' and 'd' are merged in sorted order, and each event correctly modifies the rate.\n\nThe code then computes 'water' as the accumulated rainfall. But how is this 'water' computed? Because between two events, the rate is the current slope, so the increase is rate * (current position - previous position). So 'water' starts at 0, and for each interval between previous and current position, adds rate * (current - previous) to it.\n\nWait, but 'water' here might represent the maximum possible accumulated value in the current interval. But I'm not sure. Because the actual accumulated a_j would vary depending on j. For example, the a_j is the sum of all contributions from each rain. So the maximum a_j would be at the peak of the overall function.\n\nBut the code seems to be tracking 'water' as if it's moving along the positions, adding the rate multiplied by the distance from the previous event. But since each interval has a constant rate, the maximum in that interval would be either at the start or the end. But how does the code track the maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum accumulated value. But the variables l and r are updated when the current 'water' exceeds m. But this approach might not capture the maximum correctly. Let's see:\n\nIn the code:\n\nInitially, rate is 1, lpos is a.peek(), rpos is a.peek(). l and r are initialized to -1e9 and 0. Then, during processing each event:\n\nwater += rate * (now - prev).\n\nThen, if water > m, they check two conditions. The first condition is:\n\nif(water>m && water - now - l + lpos >=0) {\n    l = water;\n    lpos = now;\n}\n\nWait, this part is confusing. Let's think: maybe 'l' is tracking the maximum left value. The expression 'water - now - l + lpos >=0' seems unclear. Perhaps it's trying to compute the current maximum in a way that considers the contribution up to now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the maximum possible value in the left part and the right part. For example, the maximum could be in the left or right of some positions, and after removing a rain's contribution, we subtract it from both.\n\nBut perhaps the code is incorrect here. Let's think through an example.\n\nSuppose after processing all events, 'l' and 'r' are the maximum values achieved at positions lpos and rpos. Then, for each rain i, when we remove it, the contribution of that rain to lpos and rpos is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|), where j is lpos or rpos. So the code subtracts this value from the original maximum, and if both adjusted values are <=m, then it's safe.\n\nBut this assumes that the maximum after removing the rain i is either at lpos or rpos. Which may not be the case. However, perhaps in the original code, 'l' and 'r' are the leftmost and rightmost positions where the maximum was achieved. So when you subtract the contribution of the i-th rain from both positions, if both are <=m, then the entire maximum is <=m.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is based on the observation that the original maximum is at lpos and rpos, and removing any rain's contribution can only decrease the maximum. So checking those two points after removal would suffice. But this may not be the case. For example, removing a rain that contributed to a different part of the field could create a new maximum elsewhere.\n\nBut considering the constraints of the problem, perhaps this approach is sufficient. Let's see the example given in the problem statement:\n\nIn the first test case, the original maximum is 3. If you remove the third day's rain, the maximum becomes 2, which is <=m=2. The code checks l and r (both 3) and subtracts the contribution of the third rain. The third rain's x is 3, p is 2. So at lpos=2 (the position where the original maximum was), the contribution is max(0, 2 - |3-2|) = 1. So subtracting 1 from 3 gives 2, which is <=m. Hence, the code returns 1 for that case.\n\nBut what if after removing a rain, the maximum is at a different position? For example, suppose the original maximum is 10 at position 5. Then, removing a rain that contributes 8 at position 5 would bring it down to 2, but perhaps another position (say, 6) had a value of 9 before removal, and the rain contributed 0 there. So after removal, position 6's value would be 9, which is still over m=5. Then the code would not detect this, because it's checking the original lpos and rpos (5) and subtracting 8. But in reality, the new maximum is at 6. So the code's approach would incorrectly allow it, leading to a wrong answer.\n\nSo the code's logic is flawed. But according to the sample input, it works. So perhaps this approach is acceptable under certain conditions, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is to find the leftmost and rightmost positions where the maximum was achieved. Then, any position that would have a higher value after removing a day's rain must have been covered by these positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables 'l' and 'r' track the maximum possible accumulated rainfall before any removal. Then, when you remove a day's rain, the maximum after removal could be the original maximum minus that day's contribution (if the original maximum was at a position covered by that day's rain). If the code checks all possible days that could contribute to the original maximum, then it would work.\n\nBut how to track all possible maximum positions? That's the crux of the problem.\n\nThe code's current approach seems to track l and r as the earliest and latest positions where the maximum was achieved, and then check the effect of removing each day's rain on these positions. But how does it compute l and r?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nWhen processing the events, whenever the water exceeds m, they check:\n\nif(water>m && water - now - l + lpos >=0) { ... }\n\nWait, maybe this is trying to track the maximum value. Let's see:\n\nThe code's 'water' is the accumulated value up to the current position. The current position is 'now'.\n\nSuppose during the sweep, after processing an event, 'water' exceeds m. Then, they update 'l' and 'r' as follows.\n\nFor example, the code says:\n\nif(water>m&&water-now -l +lpos >=0) {\n    l = water;\n    lpos = now;\n}\n\nWait, let's compute 'water' - now is the value at position 0? Or maybe this is a way to compute the maximum in the current interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables 'l' and 'r' are tracking the maximum values in the left and right parts. For example, during the sweep from left to right, whenever the accumulated rainfall (water) exceeds m, it checks if the current interval's maximum (which is the water at the end of the interval) is higher than the previous maximum. But the logic here is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the earliest and latest positions where the maximum occurs. For example, lpos is the leftmost position where the maximum is achieved, and rpos is the rightmost.\n\nBut the code's approach here is not straightforward. The expressions in the conditions are confusing. For example, in the first condition:\n\nwater-now - l + lpos >=0\n\nRearranged, this is (water - l) - (now - lpos) >=0.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe this is a way to check if the current water value at position 'now' is higher than the previous maximum l. But the calculation is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect here, which is causing the problem. For the code to pass the sample inputs, but not the general case, the missing part is probably in the way l and r are computed.\n\nBut the user says that the code is missing some parts and we have to fill them in. Looking at the code, the first thing to check is the FastReader's next() method. The code has a comment saying \"TODO: Your code here\" in the next() method.\n\nAh!

The correct code would read a line from the BufferedReader and create a new StringTokenizer.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nBecause that's how the next() method in a typical FastReader works. When there's no current token, read a new line and split it into tokens.\n\nSo the problem is that the code's FastReader is missing the code to read the next line when tokens are exhausted.
