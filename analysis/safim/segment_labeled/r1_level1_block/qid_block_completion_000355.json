So the maximum s is floor( sqrt( sum ) ), but if sum is a perfect square, then s is exactly sqrt(sum). But how do we compute sum for given n, then compute s.\n\nBut n can be up to 1e9, so we need an O(1) solution. So first, compute the sum as per even or odd n, then compute the square root. But how?\n\nLet's think about when n is even and when it's odd. Case 1: n is even. sum = m*(m+1), where m = n/2. We need to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= m(m+1). What's s here?\n\nm(m+1) is equal to m\u00b2 + m. So the square root of m\u00b2 + m is between m and m+1. We can write s = floor( sqrt(m(m+1) ) ). But sqrt(m\u00b2 + m) = m * sqrt(1 + 1/m) \u2248 m + 0.5 when m is large. But m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. The floor of sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) would be m.\n\nBecause (m + 0.5)^2 = m\u00b2 + m + 0.25. So m\u00b2 + m < (m + 0.5)^2. Therefore, sqrt(m(m+1)) is less than m+0.5, so floor is m.\n\nWait, for example, m=3: sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, floor is 3. So s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12 <16=4\u00b2. So yes. So for even n, sum is m(m+1), and s is m.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for m=3, s=3. But 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But the maximum possible s is 3, since 3\u00b2 is 9 and 4\u00b2 is 16>12. So yes. But wait, what about m=1: sum=1*2=2. s=1. 1\u00b2=1 <=2 <4. So correct. Another example: m=2. sum=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449. floor is 2. So s=2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6 <9. Correct. So in even case, s is m. So when n is even, sum is m(m+1), s is m. But wait, the square of s is m\u00b2, which is less than sum, but sum may allow for a higher s? Wait, sum is m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. So s is the largest integer s such that s\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m.\n\nLet me check for m=3: s\u00b2 must be <=12. 3\u00b2=9, 4\u00b2=16. So s=3. But 3 is less than m+0.5 (3.5) ? Wait, but m\u00b2 +m = m(m+1) = s(s+1) when s = m. So sum is m(m+1), which is s(s+1) where s=m. So the sum is s(s+1). So s squared is s\u00b2, and sum is s(s+1) = s\u00b2 +s. So sum is s\u00b2 +s. So the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum is s.\n\nWait, sum is s(s+1) (since for even n, s is m). So sum is s(s+1). The maximum possible s for the square is the maximum x where x\u00b2 <= s(s+1). But x is the value we need to compute. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: Wait, for even n, sum is m*(m+1), where m = n/2. So sum = m\u00b2 + m. So the question is, what is the largest integer x such that x\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m.\n\nWe can find x by solving x\u00b2 <= m(m+1). Let's see:\n\nx\u00b2 <= m(m+1) \u2192 x <= sqrt(m(m+1)). But m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. Let's compute sqrt(m\u00b2 +m):\n\nsqrt(m\u00b2 +m) = m * sqrt(1 + 1/m) \u2248 m + 0.5 - (0.5)/(2m) + ... for large m. So the square root is between m and m+0.5. So the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)) is m, because m\u00b2 = m\u00b2, m\u00b2 +m is m\u00b2 +m. The square of m is m\u00b2, which is less than m\u00b2 +m. But the square of m+1 is (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 + 2m +1, which is larger than m\u00b2 +m when m>0. So the maximum x is m, because x\u00b2 = m\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m < (m+1)^2. So for even n, s = m = n/2. So the maximum square side is m.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the sum is m(m+1). So sum is m\u00b2 +m. The maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum is s = floor( sqrt(sum) ) = floor( sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) ) = m. Because sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) < m + 0.5, so floor is m. So for even n, the answer is m = n/2. Wait, but let's test with sample input. Sample Input 2 is n=5. Which is odd. The sum is 9, so sqrt(9) is 3. So s=3. Which matches the sample output. But when n=6 (even), sum is 3*4=12. s is 3, which is sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So yes. So for even n, the answer is m = n/2. For odd n, sum is ((n+1)/2)^2. So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Because sum is exactly s\u00b2. So for example, n=5. sum=3\u00b2=9. s=3. So the maximum possible s is:\n\nif n is even: s = n/2. if n is odd: s = (n+1)/2. Wait, but wait. For example, n=1 (odd). sum is ((1+1)/2)^2 = 1. So s=1.\n\nn=3 (odd). sum is (4/2)^2=4. s=2. Yes. But wait, what about n=2 (even). sum=1*2=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, floor is 1. Yes. But then, what's the general formula? Wait, for n even:\n\nsum is m*(m+1) where m = n/2. So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(m(m+1)) ) = m. Because m\u00b2 <= m(m+1) < (m+1)^2. But wait, m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. So m\u00b2 + m is between m\u00b2 and m\u00b2 + 2 m +1 = (m+1)^2. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor is m. So s = m. But for odd n, sum is ( (n+1)/2 )^2, which is a perfect square, so s = (n+1)/2. So the answer for each n is:\n\nif n is even: s = n/2. if n is odd: s = (n+1)/2. Wait, but wait. Let's test with n=5 (odd) gives s=3. Which is correct.\n\nn=6 (even): 6/2=3. s=3. Which is correct. n=7 (odd): (7+1)/2=4. sum is 4^2=16. s=4. Yes. n=4 (even): sum is 2*3=6. s=2. Which is correct. Wait, but wait. For even n, why is the answer m? Because sum is m*(m+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt( m*(m+1) ) ), which is m, since m\u00b2 <= m(m+1) < (m+1)\u00b2. So yes. So the code can be written as follows: For each test case, if n is even, the answer is n/2. If n is odd, (n+1)/2.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible side length of a square using the given blocks. Each block's length is the ceiling of i/2 for their index i. And the square's area has to be at least s^2, where s is the side length. So we need to determine the largest s such that the sum of the lengths of the blocks used (each contributing 1 unit height) is at least s, because the total area would be sum * 1 (height) >= s*s. Wait, wait, no. Wait, each block is 1 unit high and some length. So when building the square, the blocks are placed horizontally. Each row of the square must be covered by the blocks' lengths. So the sum of the lengths of the blocks used in a row must be >= s. But since the square has s rows, each of length s, each row needs to sum to s. Wait, no. Wait, the total area of the square is s * s. The total area of the blocks used is the sum of all the block lengths (since each is 1 unit high, each block contributes its length to the area). So sum of all selected blocks' lengths must be >= s*s. Because the square's area is s\u00b2 and each block contributes (1 * length) area. So to form the square, we need sum of the block lengths >= s\u00b2. Then, the maximum possible s is the largest integer where the sum of the first k blocks (sorted in some way?) can reach at least s\u00b2. But since the blocks are given in a certain way, maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, the blocks are numbered from 1 to n. Each block i has a length of ceil(i/2). So the sequence of lengths is:\n\ni=1 \u2192 1/2 ceil is 1.\n\ni=2 \u2192 2/2=1.\n\ni=3 \u2192 ceil(3/2) = 2.\n\ni=4 \u2192 2.\n\ni=5 \u21923.\n\nSo the pattern is that for each pair (even and odd i), their lengths are the same. For example, i=1 and 2: both length 1. i=3 and 4: length 2. i=5 and 6: 3 and 3. Etc. So for each pair (i=2k-1 and i=2k), the total length contributed is (k) each, so sum is 2k. So maybe grouping the blocks into pairs and seeing how much each contributes.\n\nSo the sum of all blocks up to n can be calculated as follows:\n\nIf n is even, then for each pair (i=1,2), (3,4), ..., (n-1, n), each contributes (ceil(i/2) + ceil((i+1)/2)) = ( (i+1)/2 ) + (i+1)/2 ), since for even i, ceil(i/2) = i/2. Wait, for example, for i=3 and 4: ceil(3/2) is 2, ceil(4/2) is 2. Sum is 4. Which is 2*2. For i=5 and 6: 3 and 3, sum 6. So each pair contributes 2*k, where k is the index of the pair. The first pair (1,2) contributes 1+1=2 \u2192 2*1. Second pair (3,4) \u2192 2+2=4=2*2. Third pair (5,6) \u21923+3=6=2*3. So for even n, there are n/2 pairs. Each pair contributes 2*k for the k-th pair. So the sum is 2*(1+2+3+... + (n/2)). The sum of 1+2+...+m is m(m+1)/2. So for even n, sum is 2 * ( (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) ) / 2 ) \u2192 which simplifies to (n/2) * (n/2 +1). So sum = m*(m+1), where m is n/2.\n\nIf n is odd, then we have (n-1) even, which is even. So (n-1)/2 pairs, each contributing 2*k, and then the last block (n) has length ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2. So sum is ( ( (n-1)/2 ) * ( (n-1)/2 + 1 ) ) + (n+1)/2 \u2192 because (n-1)/2 is the number of pairs, and (n+1)/2 is the ceil(n/2) when n is odd.\n\nSo the total sum for n blocks is:\n\nsum = (m * (m +1)) when n is even, where m = n/2.\n\nsum = m*(m+1) + (m +1), where m = (n-1)/2. Because when n is odd, the last block is (n) which is m+1. So m = (n-1)/2. Then sum is m*(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m +1) ) = (m+1)^2. So for odd n, sum is ( ( (n-1)/2 ) +1 )^2 \u2192 ((n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, n=5 (odd). m = (5-1)/2 = 2. So sum is 2*(2+1) + 3 \u2192 6+3=9. Which is (3)^2. And (5+1)/2 is 3. So yes. So for odd n, sum is ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nFor even n=6: m=3. sum=3*4=12. Which is 3*4=12.\n\nSo sum is ( (n//2) * (n//2 +1) ) if n even, and ( ( (n+1)/2 ) )\u00b2 if n is odd.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for odd n, the sum is a perfect square, which is ( (n+1)/2 )\u00b2. For even n, sum is (n/2) * (n/2 +1).\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum. Because the sum is the total area of all blocks. So the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(sum). But wait, maybe not exactly. Because the sum could be exactly s\u00b2, then s is possible. But if sum is between s\u00b2 and (s+1)^2 -1, then s is the maximum.\n\nSo the maximum s is floor( sqrt( sum ) ), but if sum is a perfect square, then s is exactly sqrt(sum).\n\nBut how do we compute sum for given n, then compute s.\n\nBut n can be up to 1e9, so we need an O(1) solution.\n\nSo first, compute the sum as per even or odd n, then compute the square root.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about when n is even and when it's odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even.\n\nsum = m*(m+1), where m = n/2.\n\nWe need to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= m(m+1).\n\nWhat's s here?\n\nm(m+1) is equal to m\u00b2 + m. So the square root of m\u00b2 + m is between m and m+1.\n\nWe can write s = floor( sqrt(m(m+1) ) ).\n\nBut sqrt(m\u00b2 + m) = m * sqrt(1 + 1/m) \u2248 m + 0.5 when m is large.\n\nBut m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. The floor of sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) would be m.\n\nBecause (m + 0.5)^2 = m\u00b2 + m + 0.25. So m\u00b2 + m < (m + 0.5)^2. Therefore, sqrt(m(m+1)) is less than m+0.5, so floor is m.\n\nWait, for example, m=3: sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, floor is 3. So s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12 <16=4\u00b2. So yes.\n\nSo for even n, sum is m(m+1), and s is m.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for m=3, s=3. But 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But the maximum possible s is 3, since 3\u00b2 is 9 and 4\u00b2 is 16>12. So yes.\n\nBut wait, what about m=1: sum=1*2=2. s=1. 1\u00b2=1 <=2 <4. So correct.\n\nAnother example: m=2. sum=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449. floor is 2. So s=2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6 <9. Correct.\n\nSo in even case, s is m.\n\nSo when n is even, sum is m(m+1), s is m. But wait, the square of s is m\u00b2, which is less than sum, but sum may allow for a higher s?\n\nWait, sum is m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. So s is the largest integer s such that s\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m.\n\nLet me check for m=3: s\u00b2 must be <=12. 3\u00b2=9, 4\u00b2=16. So s=3.\n\nBut 3 is less than m+0.5 (3.5) ?\n\nWait, but m\u00b2 +m = m(m+1) = s(s+1) when s = m. So sum is m(m+1), which is s(s+1) where s=m. So the sum is s(s+1). So s squared is s\u00b2, and sum is s(s+1) = s\u00b2 +s. So sum is s\u00b2 +s. So the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum is s.\n\nWait, sum is s(s+1) (since for even n, s is m). So sum is s(s+1). The maximum possible s for the square is the maximum x where x\u00b2 <= s(s+1). But x is the value we need to compute.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, for even n, sum is m*(m+1), where m = n/2. So sum = m\u00b2 + m. So the question is, what is the largest integer x such that x\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m.\n\nWe can find x by solving x\u00b2 <= m(m+1). Let's see:\n\nx\u00b2 <= m(m+1) \u2192 x <= sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nBut m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. Let's compute sqrt(m\u00b2 +m):\n\nsqrt(m\u00b2 +m) = m * sqrt(1 + 1/m) \u2248 m + 0.5 - (0.5)/(2m) + ... for large m.\n\nSo the square root is between m and m+0.5. So the floor of sqrt(m(m+1)) is m, because m\u00b2 = m\u00b2, m\u00b2 +m is m\u00b2 +m. The square of m is m\u00b2, which is less than m\u00b2 +m. But the square of m+1 is (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 + 2m +1, which is larger than m\u00b2 +m when m>0. So the maximum x is m, because x\u00b2 = m\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 +m < (m+1)^2.\n\nSo for even n, s = m = n/2. So the maximum square side is m.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the sum is m(m+1). So sum is m\u00b2 +m. The maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum is s = floor( sqrt(sum) ) = floor( sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) ) = m. Because sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) < m + 0.5, so floor is m.\n\nSo for even n, the answer is m = n/2.\n\nWait, but let's test with sample input.\n\nSample Input 2 is n=5. Which is odd. The sum is 9, so sqrt(9) is 3. So s=3. Which matches the sample output. But when n=6 (even), sum is 3*4=12. s is 3, which is sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So yes.\n\nSo for even n, the answer is m = n/2.\n\nFor odd n, sum is ((n+1)/2)^2. So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Because sum is exactly s\u00b2. So for example, n=5. sum=3\u00b2=9. s=3.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is:\n\nif n is even: s = n/2.\n\nif n is odd: s = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, n=1 (odd). sum is ((1+1)/2)^2 = 1. So s=1.\n\nn=3 (odd). sum is (4/2)^2=4. s=2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about n=2 (even). sum=1*2=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, floor is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut then, what's the general formula?\n\nWait, for n even:\n\nsum is m*(m+1) where m = n/2. So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(m(m+1)) ) = m. Because m\u00b2 <= m(m+1) < (m+1)^2.\n\nBut wait, m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. So m\u00b2 + m is between m\u00b2 and m\u00b2 + 2m +1 = (m+1)^2. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor is m.\n\nSo s = m.\n\nBut for odd n, sum is ( (n+1)/2 )^2, which is a perfect square, so s = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the answer for each n is:\n\nif n is even: s = n/2.\n\nif n is odd: s = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test with n=5 (odd) gives s=3. Which is correct.\n\nn=6 (even): 6/2=3. s=3. Which is correct.\n\nn=7 (odd): (7+1)/2=4. sum is 4^2=16. s=4.\n\nYes.\n\nn=4 (even): sum is 2*3=6. s=2. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. For even n, why is the answer m? Because sum is m*(m+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt( m*(m+1) ) ), which is m, since m\u00b2 <= m(m+1) < (m+1)\u00b2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each test case, if n is even, the answer is n/2. If n is odd, (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if the sum of the blocks is exactly s\u00b2 when n is odd, and s\u00b2 is m*(m+1) when even. But according to the previous analysis, when n is even, the sum is m(m+1), so the maximum s is m, but m(m+1) is larger than m\u00b2. So the sum allows for s\u00b2 to be up to m(m+1). But the maximum s is m, since (m+1)^2 is m\u00b2 + 2m +1, which is larger than m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nIf n is even \u2192 s = n/2.\n\nIf n is odd \u2192 s = (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=5 (odd). (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2's case when n=5: sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So s=3.\n\nAnother example: n=3 (odd). sum is (3+1)/2=2. sum is 2\u00b2=4. So s=2.\n\nYes.\n\nn=2 even: 2/2=1. sum=1*2=2. s=1.\n\nSo yes. The code can be written as:\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n is even, s = n/2.\n\nif n is odd, s = (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is even?\n\nWait, let's take n=4. Then m=2. sum is 2*3=6. s is 2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6 <9. So sum allows for s=2. But the sum is 6. Which is 2*3. So the maximum s is 2.\n\nSo according to this approach, the code is simply:\n\nif n is even, count = n/2.\n\nif n is odd, count = (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in the code given, there's a part:\n\nint count=0;\n\nif(n%2!=0){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\nelse count+=n/2;\n\nSo the code is handling even and odd cases. For even n, count is set to n/2. For odd n, the code is missing. So the code for the odd case would be to set count to (n+1)/2. But wait, (n+1)/2 is an integer because n is odd. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3.\n\nBut since in Java, integer division truncates, so (n+1)/2 when n is odd would be (odd+1)/2 = even/2, which is an integer.\n\nSo the code for the odd case should be:\n\ncount = (n+1)/2;\n\nSo in the given code, the missing part is the code for the odd case. The code as given is:\n\nif (n%2 !=0) {\n    /* TODO */\n} else {\n    count += n/2;\n}\n\nWait, but in Java, (n+1)/2 for an odd n would be (like 5+1)/2=3. So for n=5, the code would set count to 3.\n\nSo the missing code for the odd case is:\n\ncount += (n+1)/2;\n\nWait, but in the code provided, count is initialized to 0, then in the else case (even) it's set to n/2. For the odd case, the code inside the if block would need to set count to (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ncount += (n+1)/2;\n\nBut in Java, when n is odd, (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is integer.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nIn the code, for the odd case, the code would be:\n\ncount += (n+1)/2;\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nFor n=5, the code would execute the if block, set count to (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code's missing part is adding (n+1)/2 to count. Since count is initialized to 0, adding is same as setting.\n\nSo the code inside the if (n%2 !=0) block should be:\n\ncount += (n +1)/2;\n\nSo the complete code would compute for odd n: (n+1)/2, and even n: n/2.\n\nWhich matches the required answer.\n\nSo the correct code to fill in the TODO section is:\n\ncount += (n +1)/2;\n\nSo the missing code is that line."
