Because the total sum of the array must be equal to arr[i] multiplied by the number of segments. So if the total sum is not divisible by arr[i], then it's not possible. Wait, but in the code, there's a loop where for each i, it's considering arr[i] as the sum for each segment.

So for each j where arr[j] equals multiple*S, multiple increases by 1. So if after processing, the total sum is (multiple-1)*S, then that's correct. For example, if there are 3 segments, the total is 3S. Suppose in the loop, multiple starts at 2, then when the next segment is found (sum 2S), multiple becomes 3, then next 3S. So when the loop ends, multiple would be 4, but total sum is 3S. So (multiple-1) is 3, which matches. So the code checks if the total sum is (multiple-1)*S.
