The grid has n rows and m columns. Stones are '*', obstacles are 'o', and empty cells are '.'. All stones fall down until they hit the bottom, an obstacle, or another stone that's already stopped. My task is to compute the final grid after all stones have settled.\n\nThe input has multiple test cases. For each, after reading the grid, I need to process it and output the result.\n\nLooking at the code provided. Let's see what's missing. The code loops through each test case, reads the grid, and then there's a nested loop structure. The outer loop is for _ in range(n), then a reversed loop for a from n-2 down (since reversed(range(n-1)) would start at n-2 and go to 0), then for each column b. If the current cell is a stone, and the cell below is either 'o' or '*', it does nothing. Otherwise, there's a TODO where I need to write the code.\n\nHmm. The approach here seems to be to simulate the falling stones step by step. Since stones can fall multiple times, maybe the outer loop (for _ in range(n)) is there because in the worst case, a stone might need to fall from the top to the bottom, which takes n steps. Each iteration of the outer loop processes the stones moving down one row if possible.\n\nBut how exactly to move the stones. For each cell (a, b) which is a stone, if the cell below (a+1, b) is empty, then the stone should move down. So in the code, when s[a][b] is '*' and s[a+1][b] is '.', then we need to swap them. Because moving down one step.\n\nWait, but if we process the stones from top to bottom, that might not work. Because if a stone moves down, then in the next iteration, the same stone could move again. But in the given code, the loop for a is in reversed(range(n-1)), which I think is processing from the bottom rows upwards. Wait, reversed(range(n-1)) gives a sequence from n-2 down to 0. Because range(n-1) is 0 to n-2, reversed gives n-2, n-3, ..., 0. So for a in this loop, we check each row from the bottom (excluding the last row, since a+1 must be a valid row). So for each a, we check row a (current) and a+1 (below).\n\nSo for each a in reversed order (starting from the bottom rows), we check each cell. If the current cell is a stone, and the cell below is empty, then we need to swap them. But how?\n\nIn the TODO part, when s[a][b] is '*' and s[a+1][b] is '.', then the stone can fall. So the code should move the stone down. So set s[a][b] to '.' and s[a+1][b] to '*'. That way, the stone moves down one cell.\n\nBut wait, since the code is processing a in reversed order (from bottom up), perhaps this approach works. For example, if there are stones in row a and a+1 is empty, then moving the stone down. Then, in the next iteration of the outer loop (the for _ in range(n)), this stone may move again if possible.\n\nBut why do we need the outer loop to run n times? Because a stone might need to fall from the top to the bottom, which could take up to n-1 steps. So the outer loop runs n times, which is more than enough to let all stones settle.\n\nSo the missing code is: when the current cell (a,b) is a stone and the cell below is empty, swap them. So in the else clause (since the cell below is not 'o' or '*'), we need to set s[a][b] to '.', and s[a+1][b] to '*'.\n\nBut wait, the code is checking if s[a][b] is '*' and s[a+1][b] is '.', then proceed. Because in the code, after the 'if' checks for 'o' or '*' and continues, the else block is when the cell below is empty (since s[a+1][b] is '.').\n\nSo in the else part, the code should move the stone down. So:\n\ns[a][b] = '.'  # current cell becomes empty\ns[a+1][b] = '*'  # the stone moves down\n\nSo that's the missing code. Because this will swap the stone with the empty cell below.\n\nBut why process the rows in reversed order (from bottom up)? Let's see: If we process from the bottom up, then when a stone is moved down, the next rows (lower a) will check their cells. But perhaps the reversed order is necessary to prevent multiple stones from moving in the same step. For example, if two stones are stacked, processing from top to bottom would allow the lower stone to move first, then the upper one. But in reversed order (processing from bottom up), the upper stones are handled first. Wait, no: reversed(range(n-1)) processes a from higher to lower. So a starts at n-2 (the second last row), then n-3, etc., up to 0. So when a is n-2, we are checking row n-2 and row a+1 is n-1 (the last row). So if the stone is in row n-2 and the last row is empty, we move it down. Then, when a is n-3, check that row, and so on. So processing rows from the bottom up. So this way, when a stone in row a moves down, it's possible that in the same iteration, stones in higher rows (lower a values) might also move down. But the outer loop runs multiple times (n times), which should handle all possible movements.\n\nWait, for example, consider a column with three stones stacked on top of each other. Let's say the initial positions are rows 0, 1, 2 (assuming n=4 rows, 0-based). Then, during each outer loop iteration, processing from the bottom up:\n\nFirst, a is 2 (n-2 is 2 when n is 4). Check if row 2 has a stone. The cell below is row 3. If it's empty, the stone moves down. Then a becomes 1: check row 1. The cell below is row 2. If it's empty now (since the stone from row 2 moved down?), but in this example, the stone from row 2 has already moved down. So the code would check row 1 and see if the cell below is empty. But maybe this isn't the right way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe processing from top to bottom (i.e., a in 0 to n-2) would not work because moving a stone down could allow the stone above it to also move. But processing from bottom up ensures that when a stone is moved down, the stones above it are processed in the next a steps. Wait, perhaps the reversed order is correct here.\n\nWait, perhaps the reversed order is necessary to process the stones from the bottom up. For example, if a stone is in row a and the one below is empty, we move it down. Then, in the next a's (lower rows), but since we're going from higher a to lower, perhaps this is correct.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's take an example. Suppose we have a column with two stones in rows 0 and 1 (n=3). So the initial grid is:\n\nrow 0: *\n\nrow 1: *\n\nrow 2: .\n\nIn the first iteration of the outer loop (for _ in range(n)), the reversed loop for a would start at a=1 (n-2 when n=3 is 1). For a=1: check row 1. It's a stone. The cell below (a+1=2) is '.' So we swap: row 1 becomes ., row 2 becomes *. Then a becomes 0. Check row 0: it's a stone. The cell below (a+1=1) is now '.' So we swap: row 0 becomes ., row 1 becomes *. So after one iteration of the outer loop, the stones have moved down to rows 1 and 2. But the outer loop runs multiple times (n=3 times). So in the next iteration, again process a from 1 to 0. For a=1, row 1 has a stone. The cell below (row 2) is now a stone. So nothing happens. For a=0: row 0 is '.', so nothing. So after two outer iterations, the stones are at rows 1 and 2. Then third iteration: same as before. So the final positions are rows 1 and 2. But according to the problem statement, all stones fall as much as possible. So the correct final positions would be rows 1 and 2. But wait, the initial setup allows the stones to fall until they hit the floor or other stones. So the correct final positions would be both stones at the bottom. So rows 1 and 2. Wait, but in the problem statement, the stones fall until they can't. So the first stone (row 0) would fall to row 2, and the stone in row 1 would fall to row 1 (since after the first stone falls, the second stone can fall into row 0's original position, but no. Wait, maybe my example is not correct. Let's think again.\n\nWait, in the initial grid:\n\nRow 0: *\n\nRow 1: *\n\nRow 2: .\n\nSo when stones fall, each stone moves down as much as possible. The first stone (row 0) can fall until there's something below. The second stone (row 1) can fall as well.\n\nBut during the simulation, in each step, the stones are processed. The problem requires that all stones fall as much as possible. So how do we simulate this?\n\nThe correct way is that for each column, the stones stack up from the bottom. So for each column, the stones are placed at the bottom, possibly with obstacles in between.\n\nFor example, in a column with two stones and no obstacles, the final state is two stones at the bottom. So the correct approach is for each column, collect all the stones (ignoring obstacles) and place them from the bottom up, filling the positions below any obstacles.\n\nBut the code here is simulating the process step by step, which might be less efficient but works given the constraints.\n\nIn the example I gave, after processing the reversed order, after one iteration of the outer loop, the stones would be in rows 1 and 2. But the correct final positions should be rows 1 and 2. Wait, no. Wait, if the column is three rows (n=3), then the stones should fall to the bottom. So row 0 and 1 have stones. The correct final state is both stones in rows 1 and 2. So the code's approach seems to work.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach of processing the stones from the bottom up (a in reversed) and swapping when possible, with multiple iterations (n times) is sufficient. Because each iteration allows stones to move one step down if possible. So after n iterations (equal to the maximum possible steps a stone can take), all stones would have settled.\n\nSo the missing code is to swap the current cell (a, b) with the cell below (a+1, b) when possible.\n\nTherefore, in the else clause, the code should be:\n\ns[a][b] = '.'  # set current cell to empty\ns[a+1][b] = '*'  # move the stone down\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ns[a][b] = '.'\ns[a+1][b] = '*'\n\nBut how to write that in Python?\n\nIn the code, the part to fill is inside the else block. So the code should be:\n\nif s[a][b] == '*':\n    if s[a+1][b] in ['o', '*']:\n        continue\n    else:\n        s[a][b], s[a+1][b] = '.', '*'  # swap them\n\nBut wait, in the code provided, the if is checking whether the cell below is 'o' or '*'\u2014if not, then the else clause is executed. So the else clause is when the cell below is '.', which means the stone can fall. So the code for the else block is to swap the stone with the empty cell below.\n\nYes. So the missing code is:\n\ns[a][b] = '.' \ns[a+1][b] = '*'\n\nSo that's the code that needs to be inserted.\n\nTesting this logic: suppose a stone is in (a, b) and the cell below is '.'.\n\nBy setting s[a][b] to '.' and the cell below to '*', the stone moves down. This is correct.\n\nNow, the code is structured such that, for each test case, after reading the grid, it loops n times (the outer loop for _ in range(n)), then for each a in reversed order, then for each column. So each iteration of the outer loop allows stones to move one step down. After n iterations (since the maximum needed steps is n-1 for a stone in the first row to reach the last row), all stones would have settled.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is exactly the two lines that swap the current stone with the empty cell below."
