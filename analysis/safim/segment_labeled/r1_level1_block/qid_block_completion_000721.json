So the code works correctly.\n\nBut wait, the code would process all test cases regardless of the value of t. For example, if t is 2, but the input has 3 test cases, the code would process all 3. But according to the problem statement, the input will have exactly t test cases. So the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct. The first line is read into s (t), but then the code processes each of the t test cases via the loop.\n\nSo the problem is to process each test case (each s in the loop) and output the division.\n\nSo the missing code is inside the loop.\n\nFor each test case, given the rating s, output \"Division X\" where X is 1-4.\n\nSo the code inside the loop needs to check the value of s and output the corresponding division.\n\nThe conditions are:\n\nIf s >= 1900 \u2192 Division 1\n\nElse if 1600 <= s <= 1899 \u2192 Division 2\n\nElse if 1400 <= s <= 1599 \u2192 Division 3\n\nElse (<=1399) \u2192 Division 4\n\nSo how to structure the code.\n\nIn C++, for each test case, after reading s, we can use if-else statements.\n\nSo inside the loop:\n\nif (s >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n} else if (s >= 1600) {  // because s is <= 1899 here\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n} else if (s >= 1400) {  // since s <1600 here, so 1400-1599\n    cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n}\n\nThat should cover all cases.\n\nTesting some examples:\n\nTest case 1: -789 \u2192 else \u2192 Division 4.\n\nTest case 2: 1299 \u2192 else \u2192 Division 4.\n\nTest case 3: 1300 \u2192 else \u2192 Division 4.\n\nTest case 4: 1399 \u2192 else \u2192 Division 4.\n\nTest case 5: 1400 \u2192 third condition \u2192 Division3.\n\nTest case6: 1679 \u2192 >=1600 \u2192 Division2.\n\nTest case7:2300 \u2192 Division1.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code inside the loop is:\n\nif (s >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n} else if (s >= 1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n} else if (s >= 1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n}\n\nBut in code, we have to use proper syntax. Also, since we're using using namespace std, we can use cout and endl.\n\nBut the problem says to output exactly the missing code. The existing code has the loop:\n\nwhile (cin >> s) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the code to add inside the loop is the if-else structure above.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif (s >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n} else if (s >= 1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n} else if (s >= 1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n}\n\nBut in C++, you can also use '\\n' instead of endl for speed, but the problem says to output the division as per the examples. The examples use newlines (as per output specification: each test case output a single line).\n\nAlternatively, using endl is correct.\n\nThus, the code to fill in is the above if-else chain."
