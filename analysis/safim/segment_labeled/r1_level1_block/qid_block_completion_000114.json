Wait, no. Because in the same Dijkstra run, once a node is popped from the heap, it's no longer in the heap. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the current code, during the processing of a node i (the current node being processed), when we examine its edges and find a better path for j (dd[j] > d), we need to update dd[j] and then adjust the heap if j is still in it.\n\nWait, but in the code's setup, the heap is a priority queue that contains all nodes at the start.

If j has already been processed (pq[j] is 0), then we can't update it anymore, but in that case, dd[j] would already be the shortest possible distance for this phase (current Dijkstra run). \n\nSo, in the TODO part, whenever we find a shorter distance d for j, we need to update dd[j] and then, if j is still in the heap, move it up in the priority queue. But how does the code check if j is in the heap? The pq array contains the position of j in the heap. If pq[j] is 0, then j is not in the heap. \n\nWait, the code uses pq as an array where pq[i] is the position in the heap of node i. So when pq[i] is 0, it's not in the heap.

However, since we are in a new Dijkstra run (after a relax step), all nodes are added into the heap again. So during each Dijkstra run, the code is processing all nodes again, allowing for updates even if they were processed in previous runs.\n\nWait, no.
