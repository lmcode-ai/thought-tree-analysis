Wait, no, because when processing each string in order, adding the count of possible previous strings that meet the condition.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to calculate the contributions from the first character differing and the second character being the same, plus the contributions from the second character differing and the first being the same. Because those are the two scenarios where exactly one position differs.\n\nFor example, consider a string \"xy\". The number of strings that have first character x and second not equal to y (so that only the second differs) plus the number of strings that have second character y and first not equal to x (so that only the first differs).\n\nBut how to track these efficiently.

Wait, for the first case, we want the first character to differ, but the second to be the same. So for each existing string in the frequency, if a string has same second character, but different first, then the count for this case is the number of such strings.\n\nWait, but how to track this. Let's see:\n\nWe can have three separate frequency maps:\n\n- a[c1]: the count of strings where the first character is c1 (regardless of the second).\n\n- b[c2]: the count of strings where the second character is c2 (regardless of the first).\n\n- c[c1][c2]: the count of strings that are exactly c1 followed by c2.\n\nBut maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when considering a new string c1c2, for the first case (first character differs, second same), the number of previous strings that have the same second character (c2) but a different first character. So the total number of such previous strings is (sum of a's for all first characters except c1) where the second character is c2. Wait, but a[c] counts the number of strings where the first character is c, regardless of the second. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for the first case, the number of previous strings that have first character different from c1, but second character equal to c2. Let's call this value X.\n\nX would be equal to (total strings with second character c2) minus the number of strings that have both first character c1 and second character c2. Because total strings with second c2 is b[c2], and among those, those that have first character c1 are exactly c[c1][c2]. So X = b[c2] - c[c1][c2].\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (second character differs, first same), Y would be (a[c1] - c[c1][c2]), since a[c1] is the count of all strings with first character c1, and subtracting c[c1][c2] gives those with first character c1 but second character not equal to c2.\n\nSo for each new string c1c2, the contribution to the answer is X + Y.
