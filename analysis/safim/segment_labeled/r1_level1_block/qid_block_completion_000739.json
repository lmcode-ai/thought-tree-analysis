So the input is multiple test cases. For each test case, we get a rating, and we have to output the division number. First, let's think about how to structure the conditions. We can check from the highest division down. Because once a condition is met, we can stop checking. So the logic would be: If rating >= 1900 \u2192 Division 1\nElse if rating >=1600 and <=1899 \u2192 Division 2\nElse if rating >=1400 and <=1599 \u2192 Division 3\nElse \u2192 Division 4\n\nWait, but since we check in order, maybe we can simplify. Like, once the first condition (>=1900) is not met, check if >=1600. Because if it's not >=1900, but is >=1600, then it must be between 1600 and 1899. Similarly, next check if >=1400. If so, then division 3. Otherwise, division 4. Yes, that's a better approach. So the order is important here. Checking from highest to lowest. So the steps for each test case:\n\nRead the rating. Check:\n\nif rating >=1900 \u2192 print Division 1\nelif rating >=1600 \u2192 Division 2 (since it's not >=1900, so between 1600 and 1899)\nelif rating >=1400 \u2192 Division 3 (since it's not >=1600, so between 1400-1599)\nelse \u2192 Division 4\n\nWait, but the third condition is >=1400. But since the previous check was >=1600 which is false, then the current rating is <1600. So if it's >=1400, then it's in 1400-1599. So the conditions are correct. So code structure for each test case:\n\nfor each test case:\n    r = int(input())\n    if r >=1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >=1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >=1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\") That's the logic. Now, I need to insert this into the given code. The given code is:\n\nfor i in range(int(input())):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo inside the loop, read the rating, then apply the conditions. So the missing code would be:\n\nr = int(input()) if r >= 1900:\n    print(\"Division 1\")\nelif r >= 1600:\n    print(\"Division 2\")\nelif r >= 1400:\n    print(\"Division 3\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Division 4\") Yes. That's the code to insert. Let me check the sample test cases. Sample Input 1-4: -789, 1299,1300,1399 \u2192 all division 4. For example, 1300: check >=1900? No. >=1600? No. >=1400? 1300 is 1300, wait no. Wait 1300 is less than 1400. Wait, no. Wait 1300 is less than 1400? Oh right!",
