Each operation allows setting a bit in any element. So the goal is to determine which bits to set across the array to maximize the final AND.\n\nLet me think. The AND of all elements is maximized when each bit in the result is set if possible.

For example, to check the i-th bit in x, you can do (x & (1 << i)) != 0. Because shifting 1 left by i gives a mask for the i-th bit. So if x AND that mask is non-zero, the bit is set.\n\nBut in the current code, there's a loop over i from 0 to 30. For each x in the array, they iterate i from 0 to 30.
