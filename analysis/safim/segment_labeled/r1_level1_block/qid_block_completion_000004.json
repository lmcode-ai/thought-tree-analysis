The element array is initialized to all 1s except the sign bit (since ~(1<<31) is 0x7FFFFFFF in two's complement? Wait, no. Wait, 1<<31 is a negative number, and then unary ~ would invert all bits. Hmm. Maybe that's intended to set all bits except the sign bit to 1? So each element starts with all bits possible as 1, then they unset bits as per the constraints.\n\nThe first loop in the while(k<31) block is processing each bit from 0 to 30. For each bit position k, they first check all the edges (i,j,val). For each edge, if the bit in val is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have that bit 0. Because OR of a_i and a_j's bit is 0. So in this first pass, they unset the k-th bit for element[i]. But wait, maybe they need to unset it for both i and j? Because if a_i | a_j's k-th bit is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have 0 in that bit.\n\nWait, the first loop in the code, for each i, they iterate over the adjList entries (which are the edges involving i).

That seems wrong. Because for all edges involving i and j where the x's k-th bit is 0, both i and j must have that bit 0. So perhaps the code here is incomplete. Because in the first part, when they find an edge where x's k-th bit is 0, they unset the bit for i, but maybe they should also unset it for j?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input. For example, if there's a statement i,j,x where x's k-th bit is 0, then a_i | a_j's k-th bit is 0. Which implies that both a_i and a_j have 0 in that bit. So for such constraints, both elements must have the bit unset. But in the code's first loop, they only process i's edges, and for each edge, if the x's bit is 0, unset i's bit. Then break.

Maybe this is handled elsewhere. Or perhaps the adjList is built with both directions. For example, when adding an edge i-j, they also add j-i. So when processing j's edges, they would also process the same constraint and unset j's bit. Because the code adds both adjList[i].add(j) and adjList[j].add(i). So when i is processed, and when j is processed, each will check their edges. But in the first loop, for each i, they loop through their edges, and if any edge has x's bit 0, unset i's bit.

Wait, in the first loop, for each i, they loop through all edges in adjList[i], and for each edge, check if the x's bit is 0. If yes, unset i's bit and break. So even if there are multiple edges, once one is found, the bit is unset and the loop breaks.\n\nBut this approach might miss some necessary unsetting. Because for example, suppose there's an edge i-j with x's bit 0, and another edge i-k with x's bit 0. Then, for i, when processing the first edge, the code unsets i's bit. Then breaks. So the second edge is not processed, but i's bit is already unset. But j's bit would be processed when j is iterated. Because j's adjList includes the i-j edge. So when j is processed in the first loop, the code will see that edge's x's bit is 0, unset j's bit, and break. Similarly for k. So perhaps this works. Because each edge is processed in both directions. So for any x's bit 0 in an edge between i and j, when i is processed in the first loop, i's bit is unset. Then when j is processed in the first loop, j's bit is unset. Thus, for all edges where x's bit is 0, both ends are unset. But wait, the code is written in such a way that when processing i's edges, if any edge has x's bit 0, then the code unsets i's bit and breaks. So for i, it's sufficient to have at least one edge with x's bit 0 to have i's bit unset. But what if i has multiple edges, some with x's bit 0 and others with x's bit 1? For the edges where x's bit is 0, i's bit must be 0. For edges where x's bit is 1, it's possible that either i or j has the bit set. So in the first loop, the code is handling the cases where x's bit is 0 by forcing i's bit to 0. Then, in the second loop, for bits that are not yet decided (i.e., x's bit is 1), we can make decisions to set the bits as needed to get the lexicographically smallest array.\n\nBut perhaps the code's first loop is correct. Because for any edge with x's bit 0, both i and j's bits must be 0. So when processing i's edges, for any such edge, i's bit is unset. Similarly, when processing j's edges, j's bit is unset. Since the adjList has both i and j's edges, both will be handled.\n\nThen, after the first loop, the code proceeds to the second loop. For each i where the element's k-th bit is 1 (meaning that after the first loop, the bit was not unset), the code unsets the bit (sets to 0) and then checks all edges. For each edge y in adjList[i], if the x's bit is 1, and the element[j]'s k-th bit is 0, then perhaps this is a problem. Because a_i's bit is now 0 (since we unset it), but element[j]'s bit is 0. Then, a_i | a_j's bit would be 0, but the x's bit is 1, which is a contradiction. Wait, no. Because if the edge's x's bit is 1, then the OR of a_i and a_j's bits must be 1. So if we have a_i's bit as 0, then a_j's bit must be 1. But if element[j]'s bit is 0 (already unset in the first loop), that would be a problem. So in that case, when we set a_i's bit to 0, we must ensure that a_j's bit is 1. But if element[j]'s bit is 0, then that's impossible. Therefore, this case would require that a_i's bit cannot be 0, so we have to set it to 1. Hence, the code must revert the unsetting of a_i's bit and leave it as 1.\n\nSo in the code's second loop, for each i, if after the first loop, the bit is 1 (i.e., not unset), then the code tries to set it to 0 (to make the array lex smaller). But then, it checks all edges from i. For each edge (i,j) where x's k-th bit is 1, if after setting a_i's bit to 0, a_j's bit must be 1 to satisfy the OR. But if a_j's bit is already 0 (as determined in the first loop), then this is impossible. Therefore, the code must find if this scenario is possible. If in any of the edges (i,j) with x's k-th bit 1, j's bit is 0, then setting i's bit to 0 is invalid. Therefore, the code must set i's bit back to 1. \n\nSo the missing code here is to check whether, after setting i's bit to 0, all edges (i,j) with x's k-th bit 1 have j's bit set. But if any j's bit is 0, then this is impossible, so i's bit must remain 1. \n\nIn the code's second loop, the code is currently unsetting the k-th bit for element[i], which is equivalent to setting it to 0. Then, for each edge y in adjList[i], it checks if the x's bit is 1 (bit ==1). Then, if the x's bit is 1, and the current element[j]'s k-th bit is 0, that's a problem. Because after setting i's bit to 0, j's bit is 0, so their OR is 0, which doesn't match the required x's bit of 1. \n\nSo in this case, setting i's bit to 0 is invalid, so we need to revert it. So the code should set element[i]'s bit back to 1. Then, break out of the loop, as we can't set it to 0. \n\nSo the missing code inside the if (bit ==1 ... ) condition is to set element[i]'s k-th bit to 1 again, and break. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\nbreak;\n\nWait, but how to implement this. Let's think. The code first unsets the bit (sets to 0). Then, for each edge (i,j), if x's k-th bit is 1 and element[j]'s k-th bit is 0. If any such edge exists, then setting i's bit to 0 is impossible. So in this case, we need to revert i's bit to 1. \n\nBut the code is processing all edges in the adjList[i] for this i. So during the processing of these edges, if any of them has x's k-th bit 1 and j's k-th bit is 0, then the code needs to set i's bit back to 1 and break out of the loop (since we can't have i's bit 0). \n\nSo in the code's TODO section, the missing code is:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\nbreak;\n\nBut why break? Because once we set the bit back, we don't need to process further edges. \n\nSo in that case, when such a condition is found, the code sets the bit back and breaks. \n\nBut perhaps after setting the bit back, the code should also break out of the loop over the edges. Because once the bit is set back to 1, there's no need to check other edges. \n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\nbreak;\n\nThis will set the bit back to 1 and break out of the loop over the edges. Then, the code can proceed. \n\nSo in the code's TODO part, when the condition is met (bit is 1 and element[j]'s bit is 0), the code should set element[i]'s k-th bit to 1 again, and break. \n\nThis ensures that if any edge requires that the OR of i and j's bits is 1, but j's bit is 0 (so i's must be 1), then i's bit is set to 1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\nbreak;\n\nThat's the code that needs to be filled in."
