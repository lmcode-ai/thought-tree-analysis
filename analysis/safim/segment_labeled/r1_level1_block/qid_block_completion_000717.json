The divisions are defined as follows:\n\n- Division 1: rating >= 1900\n- Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n- Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n- Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nSo, for each test case, I have to read the rating and output the corresponding division. The input is T test cases. Each test case is a single integer. The output for each case is \"Division X\" where X is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Hmm. Let's think about how to structure the conditions. The conditions are in a hierarchy. For example, if the rating is 2000, it's division 1. So, the order of checking matters. Because if I check division 4 first, that would be a mistake for higher ratings. The correct approach is to check the conditions from highest to lowest. So first check if rating >=1900 \u2192 division 1. Then check if >=1600 but <=1899 \u2192 division 2. Then >=1400 \u2192 division3. Else division4.",

That should handle all cases. Testing the sample inputs:\n\nFor example, sample note says that test case 5 (rating 1400) is division3. The code would check 1400 >=1900? No. Then >=1600? No. Then >=1400 \u2192 yes. So division3. Another example: 1679 is division2. The code checks >=1900? No. Then 1679 >=1600 \u2192 yes. So division2. What about 1399?
