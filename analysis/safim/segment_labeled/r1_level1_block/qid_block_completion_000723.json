The divisions are divided as follows:\n- Division 1 if the rating is at least 1900. - Division 2 if between 1600 and 1899 inclusive.\n- Division 3 between 1400 and 1599 inclusive.\n- Division 4 if 1399 or lower. So, the input is t test cases, each with a rating. For each, output the division. Hmm. So the approach is straightforward. For each rating, check which range it falls into and print the corresponding division. Let me think about how to structure the conditions. Since the conditions are in order from highest to lowest, maybe check for Division 1 first. So if rating >=1900, then Division 1. Else, check if it's >=1600 (and since we know it's <1900 here, that's division 2). Then check >=1400 (and thus <1600, so division3). Else, division4. Yes, that's the correct order.",
