  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what code to insert in the missing part of the Java program. The problem is about finding the minimal number of days so that Keshi can reach city n from city 1, with AmShZ blocking roads each day. The solution seems to involve some kind of graph algorithm, probably Dijkstra's because the code uses a priority queue.\n\nLooking at the existing code: The adjacency list is built in reverse, adding edges from v to u (since the original roads are u->v). The reason for reversing is probably to perform a BFS or shortest path calculation starting from the destination (city n-1 in 0-based indexing). The 'd' array is initialized as the out-degree of each node. Wait, wait. Wait, the code reads in roads as u and v (original), then adds adj[v].add(u). So the adj list represents reversed edges. Then d[u] is incremented. So d[u] is the number of outgoing edges from u in the original graph. Because each original edge u->v contributes to d[u]++.\n\nThe cost array is initialized with MAX values except for the destination (n-1) which is 0. The priority queue is ordered by cost. The algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's, where we process nodes in order of increasing cost. \n\nThe key part is in the loop where we process each neighbor 'a' of the current node. For each a (which is a predecessor in the original graph), we check if cost[cur] + d[a] is less than cost[a]. Hmm. Because when moving from a to cur (since adj is reversed), in the original graph, a has outgoing edges. So when Keshi is at node a, he can choose any of the outgoing edges that haven't been blocked. AmShZ's strategy is to block all but the optimal path. So, to minimize the days, we need to find the path where the number of days required is the maximum of (the steps taken so far plus the number of other outgoing edges from each node along the path).\n\nWait, the problem requires that each time AmShZ can either block a road or tell Keshi to move. The minimal days d is the smallest number such that, using an optimal strategy, Keshi arrives at the destination within d days.\n\nThe approach here is to model the problem using dynamic programming. For each node u, cost[u] represents the minimal number of days required to reach the destination from u. The priority queue is used to compute this cost in a Dijkstra-like manner. \n\nThe logic here is that when moving from a node a to a node cur (in the original graph), the number of days required is the cost of cur plus (the number of outgoing edges from a that are not part of the optimal path). Because AmShZ can block those edges over time, so Keshi will have to wait for those days. So, for each edge a -> cur (original), the cost for a would be the cost of cur plus (d[a] - 1). Because d[a] is the original out-degree of a. If we choose to take the edge to cur, then AmShZ must block the other (d[a] -1) edges first. Each day, he can block one, so that after (d[a]-1) days, Keshi can move. Then, on the next day, he moves. So the total added days would be (d[a] -1) + 1 = d[a]. Wait, but how does that fit into the equation?\n\nWait, for a node a, when moving to the next node, the time added is (the number of outgoing edges from a minus the number of edges that are part of the optimal path). Wait, maybe not. Let's think: when Keshi is at node a, which has k outgoing edges. AmShZ can block all edges except the one leading to the optimal next node. Each day, he can block one. So, if there are k-1 edges to block (since the last edge is the one we want to take), then it takes (k-1) days to block them. Then on the next day, he tells Keshi to move, which takes 1 day. So the total added days are k (since (k-1) + 1 =k). \n\nSo, for each edge a->cur (original graph), the cost of a would be cost[cur] + (d[a] - (remaining edges after blocking)). But in the optimal case, AmShZ blocks all except the edge leading to the best path. So for node a, the minimal cost would be cost[a] = min( cost[cur] + (d[a]) ) for all edges a->cur. Wait, because (d[a] is the number of outgoing edges from a. So when moving from a to cur, AmShZ has to block d[a]-1 edges, each taking a day, then on day (d[a]-1 +1) = d[a], Keshi moves. So the cost for a would be the cost of cur plus d[a]. But wait, the code has:\n\nif (cost[cur] + d[a] < cost[a]) {\n   // update cost[a]\n}\n\nBut in the code, after checking this condition, we decrement d[a]. What's that for?\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The variable d[a] here is the original out-degree of a. So for each node a, when considering edges from a (original) to other nodes, the minimal cost for a is the minimal of (cost of next node + (d[a] - (number of edges already processed for a)) + 1? Maybe not. \n\nWait, the code is building a reversed graph, and the priority queue is processed with the node's current cost. The loop processes each neighbor a of cur (in the reversed graph, which corresponds to a node a in the original graph that has an edge to cur). So in the original graph, a has an edge to cur. \n\nSo for each a (original node a), when considering the edge a->cur (original), the cost to reach the destination via this edge would be cost[cur] + (d[a] - 1). Because d[a] is the number of outgoing edges from a. So to block all other edges except this one, AmShZ needs to block (d[a] -1) edges, which takes (d[a] -1) days. Then on the next day, Keshi moves. So total added days are (d[a] -1) + 1 = d[a]. Wait, but then the cost should be cost[cur] + d[a], right? So why is the code checking cost[cur] + d[a]? Because in the code, the line says if (cost[cur] + d[a] < cost[a]). So that would make sense. \n\nBut then, after that, the code does --d[a]. Hmm. What's the decrement for?\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when processing the edges of a in reverse order. For example, suppose node a has multiple outgoing edges (original edges). For each such edge, when considering the reversed graph, each a is a predecessor of cur. The algorithm processes each of these edges, and for each edge, the cost for a is considered as cost[cur] + (the current value of d[a]). But each time we process an edge from a to cur, we decrement d[a], which effectively reduces the 'remaining' edges. \n\nWait, let's think of node a with multiple outgoing edges. For example, if a has 3 edges. Then, when processing the first edge (in the reversed graph), d[a] is 3. So the cost for a via this edge is cost[cur] + 3. Then, d[a] is decremented to 2. Then, when processing the second edge, the cost would be cost[cur] + 2. And so on. \n\nThis approach would allow us to find the minimal possible cost for a by considering all possible edges. The minimal cost for a would be the minimum of (cost of each possible next node plus the current d[a] value (which decreases as we process edges)).\n\nFor example, if a has edges to node X, Y, Z. The reversed edges would be X, Y, Z pointing to a. So when processing X's edges (reversed), a is a predecessor. Then, when processing Y, etc. \n\nBut in the code, when we process each edge of the reversed graph (i.e., for each cur in the original's destination, we look at a's in the reversed edges), the algorithm checks if cost[cur] + d[a] is better than the current cost of a. Then, decrements d[a]. So, for each edge, the d[a] is the original out-degree of a minus the number of edges processed so far. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose a has 3 outgoing edges. The first edge processed in the reversed graph (so, for example, a has an edge to cur1, which in the reversed graph is adj[cur1].add(a). Then, when cur1 is processed, for each a in adj[cur1], we process the edge a to cur1. At that time, d[a] is 3 (original out-degree). So the cost for a would be cost[cur1] + 3. Then, d[a] is decremented to 2. Then, when another edge of a is processed (say, when processing cur2), the d[a] is now 2. So the cost would be cost[cur2] + 2. Then, d[a] becomes 1, and so on. \n\nSo, for each edge a->cur in the original graph (cur is a neighbor of a), the algorithm considers the possibility of choosing that edge as the last one to be blocked, leading to the minimal cost. By decrementing d[a] each time, the next edge processed for a would have a lower value. This way, for a node a with multiple outgoing edges, the algorithm can find the minimal cost by taking the edge that gives the minimal (cost[cur] + (current d[a])). \n\nSo, the minimal cost for a is the minimum of (cost[cur] + (d[a] - k)), where k is the number of edges processed after this one. But by processing edges in reverse order (i.e., each time we process an edge, d[a] is decremented), the algorithm can pick the edge that gives the minimal possible value of (cost[cur] + d[a] - number_of_processed_edges_so_far). Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the key idea is that for each edge of a (original), the cost for a via that edge is cost[cur] plus (the number of edges that AmShZ has to block before this edge can be used. If this edge is the first one considered, then AmShZ must block all other edges except this one, which takes d[a]-1 days. Then, on day d[a], Keshi moves. But in the code, when processing edges, the code is using cost[cur] + d[a] (the original out-degree) as the potential new cost for a. However, after processing each edge, d[a] is decremented. \n\nWait, maybe the correct formula for the cost is cost[cur] + (d[a] - (k)), where k is the number of edges processed after this one. Because each time we process an edge, the code is considering that edge as being the k-th edge (so for the first edge, the d[a] is 3, then 2 for the next, etc.). \n\nWait, perhaps the reasoning is as follows: For a node a with out-degree k, the optimal strategy is to block all edges except the one leading to the next node with the minimal cost. So the cost for a is the minimal (cost[next] + (k - 1) + 1) = cost[next] + k. However, when a has multiple next nodes, we need to choose the next node that gives the minimal cost. But how does the code handle this?\n\nThe code uses a priority queue to process nodes in order of their current cost. When a node cur is processed (extracted from the priority queue), all its reversed edges (adj[cur]) are the original edges leading into cur. For each a in adj[cur], which is a node that has an original edge to cur, the code checks if using this edge can provide a better cost for a. \n\nThe key is that for each a, when considering the edge a->cur, the cost for a would be cost[cur] + (the number of edges a has to block before this edge can be taken). The number of edges to block is (number of edges of a) - 1, assuming that this is the first edge considered. But perhaps the code is considering that each edge is processed in a certain order, and the d[a] is decremented each time. \n\nWait, maybe the code is using the current value of d[a] (which is the original out-degree minus the number of edges already processed). So when processing the first edge of a, the d[a] is the original out-degree. Then, the code checks if cost[cur] + d[a] is better than the current cost of a. Then, d[a] is decremented. So for the next edge, the d[a] is (original out-degree -1). \n\nThis approach allows us to compute the minimal cost for a as the minimum of (cost of next node + d[a]_current), where d[a]_current decreases as more edges are processed. \n\nFor example, if a has two edges: first to cur1 (with cost 5), then to cur2 (with cost 3). Suppose the original out-degree d[a] is 2. \n\nWhen processing the first edge (a->cur1), the code checks cost[cur1] + 2. If that's better than a's current cost (which is initially infinity), then the cost for a is updated. Then, d[a] becomes 1. \n\nThen, when processing the second edge (a->cur2), the code checks cost[cur2] + 1. If that's better than the current cost of a (which is, say, 5 + 2 =7), then the cost is updated to 3 +1=4. \n\nSo, in this way, the code can find the minimal possible cost for a by considering all possible edges and their respective contributions, which are cost of next node plus the current value of d[a] (which is the original out-degree minus the number of edges processed so far). \n\nThus, the correct approach is to, for each edge a->cur (original), calculate cost[cur] + (current d[a]), and if that's better than a's current cost, update a's cost. Then, decrement d[a] to account for this edge being processed. \n\nIn the code, the line inside the if condition should update the cost of a and add it to the priority queue. So the missing code should be:\n\ncost[a] = cost[cur] + d[a];\nqueue.add(new int[]{cost[a], a});\n\nWait, but what's the order here? For example, when we process a's edge, we check if the new cost is better. If yes, we update cost[a], then add to the queue. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ncost[a] = cost[cur] + d[a];\nqueue.add(new int[]{cost[a], a});\n\nBut wait, the original code's 'd[a]' is the original out-degree minus the number of edges processed so far for a. Because each time we process an edge from a, we decrement d[a]. \n\nSo for example, the first edge processed from a (original node) would have d[a] as original out-degree. The next edge would have d[a] = original out-degree -1. So when processing each edge, the current value of d[a] is used. \n\nTherefore, the correct code inside the if block is to update the cost of 'a' to cost[cur] plus the current d[a], then add the new cost and 'a' to the priority queue. \n\nSo the missing lines are:\n\ncost[a] = cost[cur] + d[a];\nqueue.add(new int[]{cost[a], a});\n\nYes. Because when we process the current edge (from a to cur in the original graph), the cost for a would be the cost of cur plus the current number of outgoing edges (d[a]) that a has. Because AmShZ needs to block all other edges, which takes d[a] -1 days, then on the next day move. So total is (d[a] -1 +1) =d[a] days. So the cost is added as cost[cur] + d[a]. \n\nTherefore, the code should set cost[a] to this value, and then add it to the priority queue. \n\nThe other part is that d[a] is decremented after checking. So when processing the next edge of a, the d[a] is one less. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ncost[a] = cost[cur] + d[a];\nqueue.add(new int[]{cost[a], a});\n\nBut need to check if this is indeed the correct approach. \n\nLet me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n2 1\n1 2\n\nIn this case, the code builds the adjacency list for reversed edges. So node 1 (0-based?) has an edge from 2 (n-1 is 1). The d array for node 0 (original node 1) is 1. \n\nProcessing starts with node 1. adj[1] contains node 0. So when processing node 1, for a=0, cost[1] is 0. So cost[0] = 0 + d[0] (which is 1). So cost[0] becomes 1. Then added to the queue. \n\nThe answer is cost[0] =1. But according to the first sample note, the answer is 0 days. Wait, but the sample input says that the output is 0 days. Wait, no: wait the sample note says \"it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message\". Which means Keshi can move directly. So the answer should be 1 day? Wait, no. Because on day 1, AmShZ tells him to move, and he moves. So the answer should be 1. But the sample note says that in the first sample, the output is 0. Wait, the sample note says:\n\n\"In the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message.\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let's check the actual sample input. \n\nWait, the sample input is probably:\n\nn=2, m=1. Road from 1 to 2. So the answer is 1 day. But according to the code's output, cost[0] is 1. Which matches. Because the code outputs cost[0]. \n\nBut according to the sample note, the answer is 0. That can't be. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the code uses 0-based indexes. So node 0 is the starting city (1 in 1-based), and node 1 is the destination (n=2). So the code's answer is cost[0], which is 1. But according to the sample note, the answer is 1 day. But the sample note says that AmShZ sends the second type of message. So he tells Keshi to move. Then Keshi moves. So it's one day. So the code's output is 1, which matches. So why does the sample note say the first sample's output is 0? Or perhaps the sample note is not the first sample. Maybe the first sample is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's see. When the code processes the node n-1 (1 in 0-based), which has cost 0. Then, in adj[1], there's a=0. Then, the code checks if cost[1] + d[a] (d[0] is 1) is less than cost[0]. Since cost[0] is MAX/2, it is. So cost[0] is set to 0+1=1. Then, a is added to the queue. \n\nSo the code outputs 1. Which is correct for the first sample. So the sample note must have another example. \n\nBut regardless, the code's logic is to model the minimal days as the cost for each node, which is computed as the cost of the next node plus the current d[a] (the number of edges to block plus 1). \n\nSo the correct code to insert is:\n\ncost[a] = cost[cur] + d[a];\nqueue.add(new int[]{cost[a], a});\n\nThus, the missing lines are these two. Because when a new cost for 'a' is found, we update the cost array and add the new entry to the priority queue."
