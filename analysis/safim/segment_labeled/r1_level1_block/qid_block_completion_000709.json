      "text": "Inside the loop, the TODO is where I need to put the logic. Hmm. So for each n (the rating), I need to check which division it falls into. Let me think about the conditions. The order of checking matters here. Because once a condition is met, the correct division is determined. For example, if the rating is 2000, it's >=1900, so Division 1. So the first condition to check is whether the rating is >=1900. If yes, output Division 1. If not, check if it's >=1600 (since if it's between 1600-1899, it's Division 2). Then check if >=1400 for Division 3. Else, Division 4. So the order of conditions should be from highest to lowest. Because once a higher condition is met, we don't need to check lower ones. So the logic would be:\n\nif (n >= 1900) => Division 1\n\nelse if (n >=1600) => Division 2 (since it's not >=1900, but >=1600, which covers 1600-1899)\n\nelse if (n >=1400) => Division 3 (since it's between 1400-1599)\n\nelse => Division 4. Yes, that should cover all the cases. So in the code, for each test case, read n, then check these conditions in order. So the missing code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> n;\n\nthen the if-else chain. Then output the corresponding division. So putting it all together. The code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> n;\n\nif (n >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n} else if (n >= 1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n} else if (n >= 1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n}\n\nWait, but what about the ranges? Let me check:\n\nFor example, if n is 1600: the first condition is false (1900 is higher). Then check if >=1600, which is true. So Division 2. Correct. If n is 1599: first two conditions false.
