      "text": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine the division based on the given rating. Let's see the problem statement again. So, the divisions are as follows:\n- Division 1: 1900 or higher.\n- Division 2: between 1600 and 1899 inclusive. - Division 3: between 1400 and 1599 inclusive.\n- Division 4: 1399 or lower. The input is t test cases, each with a rating. For each, I have to output the correct division. Hmm, how to structure the conditions. Let's think about the order. Since the higher divisions have higher ranges, maybe check the highest first. Like, first check if the rating is >=1900, then else check if it's >=1600 (but since it's else, we know it's <=1899 here). Then else check >=1400 (so 1400-1599), else division 4. Right. So for each rating, the logic would be:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) \u2192 Division 1\nelse if (rating >=1600) \u2192 Division 2 (since it's after checking >=1900, so here it's between 1600-1899)\nelse if (rating >=1400) \u2192 Division 3 (1400-1599)\nelse \u2192 Division 4. So in code, for each test case, read the rating, then apply these conditions.",

Wait, the loop is written as while(t). So maybe it's decrementing t each time. Oh right, because in C++, if you have while (t), then you need to decrement t each iteration. Wait, the current code has:\n\nint t;\nstd::cin >> t;\nwhile (t) { ... } So this loop will run t times only if inside the loop, t is decremented. Otherwise, it's an infinite loop. Wait, the loop is written as while(t), which checks if t is non-zero. So inside the loop, after processing a test case, we need to decrement t. Like t--;. But in the code given, the loop is while(t), but there's no code inside that decrements t. So the missing code includes reading the rating, processing, and decrementing t.\n\nWait, the original code's while loop is:\n\nwhile(t) {\n   // TODO: code here\n} So, in that loop, we need to read each test case, process, output, and decrement t. So the steps inside the loop would be:\n\nRead the rating (std::cin >> rating;)\n\nThen determine which division it's in. Then output \"Division X\" followed by a newline. Then decrement t (since t is the count of test cases left). Wait, but if we have t=5, then the loop runs while t is non-zero.

So the code inside the while loop would be:\n\nstd::cin >> rating;\n\nif (rating >=1900) {\n   std::cout << \"Division 1\\n\";\n} else if (rating >=1600) {\n   std::cout << \"Division 2\\n\";\n} else if (rating >=1400) {\n   std::cout << \"Division 3\\n\";\n} else {\n   std::cout << \"Division 4\\n\";\n}\n\nt--; // or maybe in the loop condition.
