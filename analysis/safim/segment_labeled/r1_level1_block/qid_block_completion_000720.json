The else-if chain checks conditions in order. The previous condition checks if r <=1599, which is division 3. So if that's false, then r is >=1600. So the next condition is checking if r <=1899. So for 1600 <= r <=1899, it should print Division 2. Because division 2 is 1600 to 1899 inclusive. So the correct code here is to print \"Division 2\". So the missing line is printf(\"Division 2\\n\");.",
