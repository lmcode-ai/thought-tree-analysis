So first compute the sum of all the blocks' lengths, then s is the integer part of the square root of that sum, but perhaps adjusted. Wait, for example, if sum is s^2, then s is possible. If sum is between s^2 and (s+1)^2, then s is possible if sum >= (s+1)^2, but otherwise s is the maximum. So the problem reduces to compute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n, then compute the maximum s where s^2 <= S.\n\nTherefore, the key is to compute S, then find the integer s such that s is the floor of the square root of S. Wait, no. Wait, S can be a perfect square. For example, if S is 9, then s is 3. If S is 10, the maximum s is 3, since 3^2 is 9 <=10, and 4^2 is 16>10. So the formula for s is the floor of sqrt(S). So the steps are:\n\n1. For given n, compute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n2. Compute s = floor(sqrt(S)). 3. Output s. So the problem is to compute S quickly, especially since n can be up to 1e9. So how to compute S efficiently? Let's find a formula for S. Let's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor i=1: ceil(1/2) = 1\ni=2: ceil(2/2) =1\ni=3: 2\ni=4:2\ni=5:3, etc. So for even i: ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. So let's split the sum into even and odd terms. Let n be split into k pairs (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2m-1, 2m). If n is even, m = n/2. If n is odd, m = (n-1)/2, and there's an extra term. Each pair (2i-1, 2i) contributes ceil( (2i-1)/2 ) + ceil(2i/2 ) = i + i = 2i. So for each pair, sum is 2i. So the sum of the first m pairs is sum_{i=1 to m} 2i = 2*(m(m+1)/2) ) = m(m+1). If n is even, then m = n/2. So sum is m(m+1) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4. If n is odd, then m = (n-1)/2. Then the sum of the pairs is m(m+1). Then we have an additional term for the last odd number (n) which is ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2. So total sum is m(m+1) + (n+1)/2. Let's compute m in terms of n: m = (n-1)/2. So substituting:\n\nsum = [ (n-1)/2 * ( (n-1)/2 +1 ) ] + (n+1)/2 \n\nSimplify (n-1)/2 +1 = (n-1 +2)/2 = (n+1)/2. So sum becomes (n-1)(n+1)/4 + (n+1)/2 \n\nFactor (n+1)/4: [ (n-1) + 2 ] * (n+1)/4 = (n+1)(n+1)/4 = (n+1)^2 /4. Wait, let's compute:\n\nsum for odd n is ( (n-1)/2 * (n+1)/2 ) + (n+1)/2 \n\nWhich is (n+1)/2 [ (n-1)/2 + 1 ] \n\n= (n+1)/2 [ (n-1 + 2)/2 ] \n\n= (n+1)/2 * (n+1)/2 \n\n= (n+1)^2 /4 \n\nSo for odd n, sum is (n+1)^2 /4. For even n, sum is (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = n(n+2)/4 So the sum S can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nS = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4 \n\nif n is odd:\n\nS = (n+1)^2 /4 \n\nWait, let me check for some small values. n=1: sum is 1. (1+1)^2 /4 =4/4=1. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)^2 /4 =16/4=4. The sum is ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2. Sum is 1+1+2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: even. (2^2 +2*2)/4 = (4+4)/4=8/4=2. Which is correct (1+1=2). n=5 (which was the example in the problem statement). n is odd. (5+1)^2/4=36/4=9. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. Correct. So the formula for sum S is:\n\nif n is even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) = (n(n+2))/4 \n\nif n is odd: S = ((n+1)/2)^2 \n\nSo now, given n, compute S, then compute the floor of sqrt(S). Wait, but S can be expressed for both even and odd n in terms of integer operations. For example, for even n, (n(n+2))/4. Let's see for even n:\n\nLet n=4. Then (4*6)/4=6. Sum is ceil(1/2)=1, 1, 2, 2. Sum is 6. Correct. So floor(sqrt(6))=2. Which is 2^2=4 < =6 <9, so correct. But the problem is to compute s as the maximum integer where s^2 <= S. So how to compute s given S? It's the integer part of sqrt(S), but since S can be a perfect square. For example, if S=9 (n=5), then s=3. If S=10, s=3. So the formula for s is floor(sqrt(S)). But since n can be up to 1e9, S can be up to ((1e9 +1)/2)^2 which is around (5e8)^2 = 2.5e17, so sqrt(S) is up to 5e8. So using standard sqrt functions in C with integers might not be precise.",

So the sqrt(S) is (n+1 - 1/(2(n+1)))/2. Hmm, but perhaps this is not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps for even n, the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Let's see for some examples. For even n=2: S=2. sqrt(2)=1.414, floor is 1. (n+1)/2=3/2=1.5. So s=1. Which matches.\n\nn=4: S=6. sqrt(6)=2.449, floor is 2. (4+1)/2=2.5. So s=2. Correct. n=6: S= (6*8)/4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. (6+1)/2=3.5. So s=3. Which is correct. Wait, so for even n, s is floor( (sqrt(n(n+2)) ) / 2 ). But how to compute that without dealing with floating points? Alternatively, perhaps s can be written as (n//2 +1)//1? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe for even n, s is (sqrt(n(n+2)) ) // 2. But how? Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern. Let's compute s for even n:\n\nFor even n:\n\nn=2: s=1\n\nn=4: s=2\n\nn=6: s=3\n\nn=8: S= (8*10)/4=20. sqrt(20)=4.472, s=4. But 8//2=4. So (n/2) =4, but s is 4. Which is sqrt(20)~4.47, so floor is 4. So for even n, s = floor( sqrt( (n/2) * (n/2 +1) ) ) Wait, for even n, S = (n/2)*( (n/2)+1 ). So S is the product of two consecutive integers. The square root of such a product is approximately the average of the two, but slightly less. So sqrt(k*(k+1)) = sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) \u2248 k + 0.5 - ... So the floor would be k. For example, k=3: sqrt(3*4)=sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor 3. So for even n, S = k*(k+1) where k =n/2. Then s is the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) \u2192 which is k. Because k^2 < k(k+1) < (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1, so floor is k. So s=k =n/2. Wait, for even n, S = (n/2)*(n/2 +1). Let k = n/2. So S = k(k+1). Then sqrt(S) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). Which is less than k+1. So floor(sqrt(S)) is k. Because k^2 < k(k+1) < (k+1)^2 \u2192 yes. So for even n, s =k =n/2. Wait, wait. Let's check for n=6 (even):\n\nk=3. S=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. Which is k. So yes. n=4: k=2. S=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449. floor 2=k.\n\nn=2: k=1. S=1*2=2. sqrt(2)=1.414. floor 1=k. So for even n, s =n/2. But wait, what about n=8. k=4. S=4* 5=20. sqrt(20)=4.472. floor is 4. So yes. So for even n, s is k =n/2. But wait, in that case, the sum S is k*(k+1). So the maximum s is k, since s^2 is k\u00b2, which is \u2264 S (since k\u00b2 <k\u00b2 +k = S). So s= k. So for even n, s= n/2. But wait, the example given in the problem statement is when n=5 (odd). The sum S is (5+1)^2/4=9. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. Which matches the example. Now, let's see for odd n.\n\nOdd n: S = ((n+1)/2)^2. So sqrt(S) = (n+1)/2. So s is exactly (n+1)/2. For example:\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 s=3. n=3: (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 S=4, s=2. n=1: (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 s=1. So for odd n, s is (n+1)/2. But wait, for even n, s is n/2. For odd n, s is (n+1)/2. So perhaps s is equal to (n+1)//2 ? Wait, for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) + 0.5, which when integer divided would be n/2. For example, n=4 \u2192 4+1=5, 5//2=2. Which is n/2=2. For n=6 \u2192 (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3.5 as integer division (assuming C's integer division) would be 3, but (6+1)/2 is 3.5, and (n+1)//2 is 3. But for even n, (n+1)//2 is (n/2) if n is even. Wait, no. Wait, n=4 is even. (4+1)/2=2.5, integer division in C truncates towards zero, so 4 +1=5, 5/2=2.5 \u2192 2. So (n+1)/2 when n is even would be (even +1) is odd, divided by 2. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) + 0.5, so integer division gives (n/2) when even. Wait, n=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5, integer division gives 2. So for even n, (n+1)//2 is equal to (n)/2 + (1//2) \u2192 (n/2) +0.5 \u2192 integer division gives n/2. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) +0.5, which in integer division (like in C) would be n/2. Wait, let's compute for even n=4: (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 integer division (in C) truncates to 2. Which is 4/2=2. Similarly, for even n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. But for even n, s is n/2, which is exactly (n+1)/2 when n is even, but since (n+1) is odd, integer division in C would give (n+1)/2 as (n/2) when n is even. Wait, perhaps for even n, (n+1)//2 is equal to n/2 when n is even. Let's see:\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)//2=5//2=2 (same as 4/2=2). n=6 \u21927//2=3 (same as 6/2=3). So for even n, (n+1)//2 equals n/2. For odd n: (n+1)/2 is integer. For example, n=5 \u21926/2=3. So in integer division, it's 3. So s can be written as (n+1)//2 for all n.\n\nWait, for even n, s is n/2, which is (n+1)//2. For example, n=4: (4+1)//2=2.5\u21922 in integer division, which is n/2=2. For odd n=5: (5+1)//2=3. So s is (n+1)//2. But wait, let's test for n=5. S=9. sqrt(9)=3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. For even n=6: S=3*4=12. sqrt(12)~3.464, floor is 3. Which is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u21923.5 truncated is 3. So yes. So s is (n+1)//2 for all n.\n\nWait, that's a surprising conclusion. Let's test with more examples. n=7 (odd). (7+1)/2=4. So s=4. S= (7+1)^2/4=64/4=16. sqrt(16)=4. So correct. n=8 (even). (8+1)//2=4.5\u21924. S=8*10/4=20. sqrt(20)=4.47, floor is4. Correct. So for all n, the maximum s is (n+1)//2. But wait, this seems to contradict the example in the problem statement. Let me check the first example. In the problem statement, the first test case is n=1. Output is 1. (1+1)//2=1. Correct. Second test case is n=5. Output is3. Which is (5+1)//2=3. Correct. Another test case: n=2. Output is1. (2+1)/2=1.5\u21921. Correct. Another example: n=3. sum is 4 (ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2. sum=4). sqrt(4)=2. So s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Correct. So this seems to hold. Therefore, the solution is to compute (n+1)//2 for each test case. But why? How? Wait, why does this formula work? Let's think again. For even n: S = (n/2)(n/2+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt(S) ). But S = k(k+1) where k =n/2. Then, k^2 < S < (k+1)^2. So floor(sqrt(S)) =k. Which is n/2. So s=k =n/2 = (n+1)//2, since for even n, (n+1) is odd, and (n+1)//2 is (n//2) + 0.5, but integer division in C truncates to n//2. Wait, but (n+1)//2 for even n is (n+1)/2. For even n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u21922. Which is 4//2=2. For odd n: S = ((n+1)/2)^2. So sqrt(S) is exactly (n+1)/2, which is integer. So s= (n+1)/2, which is (n+1)//2.",

So the code is simply, for each test case, read n and output (n+1)//2. But why does this formula work? Because for even n, the sum S is k*(k+1) where k is n/2. The maximum s is k, which is (n+1)//2. For odd n, the sum is (k)^2, where k is (n+1)/2, so s is k. Therefore, the code is straightforward. For each test case, output (n+1)//2. But wait, let's test another example. Suppose n=7 (odd). (7+1)//2=4. S is (7+1)^2/4=16. sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\nn=9 (odd): (9+1)/2=5. S=10^2/4=25. sqrt(25)=5. Correct. n=10 (even). (10+1)//2=5.5\u21925. S=10*12/4=30. sqrt(30)=5.477\u21925. Correct. Yes, this formula works. So the code for each test case is simply output (n+1)/2, using integer division. But in C, since n is a long long (since n can be up to 1e9, which fits in 32-bit integer, but when we add 1, it's 1e9+1 which is within 32 bits), but for the division, when using integers, (n+1)/2 would be computed as integer division. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) + 0.5, which when done as integer division, would truncate to n/2. For example, (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2 in C.\n\nWait, but in C, when dividing two integers, it truncates towards zero. So for example, (n+1) is divided by 2. So when n is even, (n+1) is odd, and (n+1)/2 in integer division is (n)/2. Because (even +1) is odd. So for even n:\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=5/2=2 in C (since 5/2 is 2.5, but truncated to 2). Similarly, n=6:7/2=3. But (n+1)/2 for even n is (n/2) + 0.5, which truncates to n/2. But for odd n, (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is integer. Thus, in code:\n\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1) / 2);\n\nBut n is up to 1e9, so we can read n as a long long, but in practice, since 1e9 is within the range of a 32-bit integer. But to avoid overflow, perhaps using long long is better. So the code is: For each test case, read n as a long long, then output (n+1)/2. Wait, but the example given in the problem statement when n=5, the output is 3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Another example: n=2, output is (2+1)/2=1.5 \u21921 in C. Correct. Yes. So the code is simple. The missing code is:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1) / 2);\n\nBut the original code has variables of type int. Wait, no. The code given is:\n\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<math.h>\nint main(){\n    int t;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &t);\n    while(t--){\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n} But the input for n can be up to 1e9, which is 10^9, which is larger than 2^31 (assuming int is 32 bits). So if the code uses int for n, then for n=1e9, it would overflow. So in C, the code must read n as a long long. So the correct code inside the loop is:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1)/2); So the missing code is:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1)/2); But wait, the original code doesn't include any headers for long long. However, in C, using %lld for long long is correct. So the code should be correct. Thus, the answer is to replace the TODO with:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1) / 2);",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be made using n blocks. Each block has a height of 1 and a length of ceil(i/2) where i is the block's number from 1 to n. \n\nHmm. So each block is a 1xceil(i/2) rectangle, and they can't be rotated. So when placing them in the square, they can be arranged either vertically (so their height contributes to the height of the square) or horizontally (their length contributes to the height of the square). Wait, wait. Wait, the square's side length is the same in both dimensions, so the total area of the blocks used must be at least s^2, since each block contributes 1 * ceil(i/2) units of area. But arranging them to fit into an s x s square is more complex. However, the problem says we need to find the maximum possible s such that the sum of the lengths (since each block is placed horizontally, taking 1 unit height and contributing their length to the width) equals s, and the sum of the heights (if placed vertically) is s. Wait, no. Wait, the blocks are 1 unit high. So if you arrange them horizontally, they contribute their length to the width of the square, and their height (1 unit) to the height. But how do we arrange them so that the total height of all blocks stacked vertically equals s, and the total width arranged horizontally equals s? Or perhaps the blocks can be arranged in rows. Like, each row is a collection of blocks placed horizontally, end to end. Then each row contributes 1 unit to the height (since each block is 1 unit high) and the sum of the lengths of the blocks in the row contributes to the width. So to form a square of side s, we need to have s rows, each of which has a total length of s. So the sum of the lengths of all blocks used must be at least s * s. But the blocks can be distributed among the rows as needed. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the total sum of all available blocks' lengths (ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n) is >= s*s. Then the maximum possible s is the largest integer where the sum is at least s squared.\n\nYes! Because each row in the square must have exactly s units of length (since the square's side is s), and there are s rows. So the total required is s * s. So the maximum s is the largest integer such that the sum of the lengths of the selected blocks is >= s^2. Since we can choose any subset of the blocks (since we don't have to use all), but to maximize s, we want to take as many blocks as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the lengths of all the blocks is the maximum possible sum. So the sum of all blocks' lengths (ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n) is the total sum. Then the maximum s is the floor of the square root of that sum. But maybe there's a better way. Wait, no. Because the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that sum >= s^2. So first compute the sum of all the blocks' lengths, then s is the integer part of the square root of that sum, but perhaps adjusted. Wait, for example, if sum is s^2, then s is possible. If sum is between s^2 and (s+1)^2, then s is possible if sum >= (s+1)^2, but otherwise s is the maximum. So the problem reduces to compute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n, then compute the maximum s where s^2 <= S.\n\nTherefore, the key is to compute S, then find the integer s such that s is the floor of the square root of S. Wait, no. Wait, S can be a perfect square. For example, if S is 9, then s is 3. If S is 10, the maximum s is 3, since 3^2 is 9 <=10, and 4^2 is 16>10. So the formula for s is the floor of sqrt(S). So the steps are:\n\n1. For given n, compute the sum S of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n2. Compute s = floor(sqrt(S)).\n3. Output s.\n\nSo the problem is to compute S quickly, especially since n can be up to 1e9. So how to compute S efficiently?\n\nLet's find a formula for S. Let's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor i=1: ceil(1/2) = 1\ni=2: ceil(2/2) =1\ni=3: 2\ni=4:2\ni=5:3, etc.\n\nSo for even i: ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2.\n\nSo let's split the sum into even and odd terms.\n\nLet n be split into k pairs (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2m-1, 2m). If n is even, m = n/2. If n is odd, m = (n-1)/2, and there's an extra term.\n\nEach pair (2i-1, 2i) contributes ceil( (2i-1)/2 ) + ceil(2i/2 ) = i + i = 2i.\n\nSo for each pair, sum is 2i. So the sum of the first m pairs is sum_{i=1 to m} 2i = 2*(m(m+1)/2) )= m(m+1).\n\nIf n is even, then m = n/2. So sum is m(m+1) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4.\n\nIf n is odd, then m = (n-1)/2. Then the sum of the pairs is m(m+1). Then we have an additional term for the last odd number (n) which is ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2. So total sum is m(m+1) + (n+1)/2. Let's compute m in terms of n: m = (n-1)/2. So substituting:\n\nsum = [ (n-1)/2 * ( (n-1)/2 +1 ) ] + (n+1)/2 \n\nSimplify (n-1)/2 +1 = (n-1 +2)/2 = (n+1)/2. So sum becomes (n-1)(n+1)/4 + (n+1)/2 \n\nFactor (n+1)/4: [ (n-1) + 2 ] * (n+1)/4 = (n+1)(n+1)/4 = (n+1)^2 /4.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nsum for odd n is ( (n-1)/2 * (n+1)/2 ) + (n+1)/2 \n\nWhich is (n+1)/2 [ (n-1)/2 + 1 ] \n\n= (n+1)/2 [ (n-1 + 2)/2 ] \n\n= (n+1)/2 * (n+1)/2 \n\n= (n+1)^2 /4 \n\nSo for odd n, sum is (n+1)^2 /4. \n\nFor even n, sum is (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = n(n+2)/4 \n\nSo the sum S can be written as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nS = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4 \n\nif n is odd:\n\nS = (n+1)^2 /4 \n\nWait, let me check for some small values.\n\nn=1: sum is 1. (1+1)^2 /4 =4/4=1. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3+1)^2 /4 =16/4=4. The sum is ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2. Sum is 1+1+2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: even. (2^2 +2*2)/4 = (4+4)/4=8/4=2. Which is correct (1+1=2).\n\nn=5 (which was the example in the problem statement). n is odd. (5+1)^2/4=36/4=9. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for sum S is:\n\nif n is even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) = (n(n+2))/4 \n\nif n is odd: S = ((n+1)/2)^2 \n\nSo now, given n, compute S, then compute the floor of sqrt(S).\n\nWait, but S can be expressed for both even and odd n in terms of integer operations. For example, for even n, (n(n+2))/4. Let's see for even n:\n\nLet n=4. Then (4*6)/4=6. Sum is ceil(1/2)=1, 1, 2, 2. Sum is 6. Correct. So floor(sqrt(6))=2. Which is 2^2=4 <=6 <9, so correct.\n\nBut the problem is to compute s as the maximum integer where s^2 <= S.\n\nSo how to compute s given S? It's the integer part of sqrt(S), but since S can be a perfect square. For example, if S=9 (n=5), then s=3. If S=10, s=3.\n\nSo the formula for s is floor(sqrt(S)). But since n can be up to 1e9, S can be up to ((1e9 +1)/2)^2 which is around (5e8)^2 = 2.5e17, so sqrt(S) is up to 5e8. So using standard sqrt functions in C with integers might not be precise. Alternatively, compute s via binary search.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to express s directly from n, without computing S first.\n\nWait, let's substitute S into the expression for s.\n\nCase 1: n is even.\n\nS = n(n+2)/4. So s = floor( sqrt( n(n+2)/4 ) )\n\n= floor( (sqrt(n(n+2)) ) / 2 )\n\nBut sqrt(n(n+2)) is approximately n+1 - 0.5 (for large n), but this is not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for s in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, for even and odd n, express s in terms of n.\n\nLet's see:\n\nCase 1: n even.\n\nn is even: S = (n(n+2))/4. Let's compute sqrt(S) = sqrt(n(n+2)/4) = (sqrt(n(n+2))) / 2.\n\nBut n(n+2) = (n+1)^2 -1. So sqrt(n(n+2)) = sqrt( (n+1)^2 -1 ) \u2248 n+1 - 1/(2(n+1)) (using Taylor series for sqrt(x\u00b2-1) near x). So the sqrt(S) is (n+1 - 1/(2(n+1)))/2. Hmm, but perhaps this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for even n, the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Let's see for some examples.\n\nFor even n=2: S=2. sqrt(2)=1.414, floor is 1. (n+1)/2=3/2=1.5. So s=1. Which matches.\n\nn=4: S=6. sqrt(6)=2.449, floor is 2. (4+1)/2=2.5. So s=2. Correct.\n\nn=6: S= (6*8)/4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. (6+1)/2=3.5. So s=3. Which is correct.\n\nWait, so for even n, s is floor( (sqrt(n(n+2)) ) / 2 ). But how to compute that without dealing with floating points?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps s can be written as (n//2 +1)//1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for even n, s is (sqrt(n(n+2)) ) // 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern. Let's compute s for even n:\n\nFor even n:\n\nn=2: s=1\n\nn=4: s=2\n\nn=6: s=3\n\nn=8: S= (8*10)/4=20. sqrt(20)=4.472, s=4.\n\nBut 8//2=4. So (n/2) =4, but s is 4. Which is sqrt(20)~4.47, so floor is 4. So for even n, s = floor( sqrt( (n/2) * (n/2 +1) ) )\n\nWait, for even n, S = (n/2)*( (n/2)+1 ). So S is the product of two consecutive integers. The square root of such a product is approximately the average of the two, but slightly less. So sqrt(k*(k+1)) = sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) \u2248 k + 0.5 - ... So the floor would be k. For example, k=3: sqrt(3*4)=sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor 3. So for even n, S = k*(k+1) where k =n/2. Then s is the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) \u2192 which is k. Because k^2 < k(k+1) < (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1, so floor is k. So s=k =n/2.\n\nWait, for even n, S = (n/2)*(n/2 +1). Let k = n/2. So S = k(k+1). Then sqrt(S) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). Which is less than k+1. So floor(sqrt(S)) is k. Because k^2 < k(k+1) < (k+1)^2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo for even n, s =k =n/2.\n\nWait, wait. Let's check for n=6 (even):\n\nk=3. S=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. Which is k. So yes.\n\nn=4: k=2. S=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449. floor 2=k.\n\nn=2: k=1. S=1*2=2. sqrt(2)=1.414. floor 1=k.\n\nSo for even n, s =n/2.\n\nBut wait, what about n=8. k=4. S=4*5=20. sqrt(20)=4.472. floor is 4. So yes. So for even n, s is k =n/2.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the sum S is k*(k+1). So the maximum s is k, since s^2 is k\u00b2, which is \u2264 S (since k\u00b2 <k\u00b2 +k = S). So s= k. So for even n, s= n/2.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem statement is when n=5 (odd). The sum S is (5+1)^2/4=9. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. Which matches the example.\n\nNow, let's see for odd n.\n\nOdd n: S = ((n+1)/2)^2. So sqrt(S) = (n+1)/2. So s is exactly (n+1)/2. For example:\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 s=3.\n\nn=3: (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 S=4, s=2.\n\nn=1: (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 s=1.\n\nSo for odd n, s is (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, for even n, s is n/2. For odd n, s is (n+1)/2. So perhaps s is equal to (n+1)//2 ?\n\nWait, for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) + 0.5, which when integer divided would be n/2. For example, n=4 \u2192 4+1=5, 5//2=2. Which is n/2=2. For n=6 \u2192 (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 3.5 as integer division (assuming C's integer division) would be 3, but (6+1)/2 is 3.5, and (n+1)//2 is 3. But for even n, (n+1)//2 is (n/2) if n is even. Wait, no. Wait, n=4 is even. (4+1)/2=2.5, integer division in C truncates towards zero, so 4+1=5, 5/2=2.5 \u2192 2. So (n+1)/2 when n is even would be (even +1) is odd, divided by 2. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) + 0.5, so integer division gives (n/2) when even. Wait, n=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5, integer division gives 2. So for even n, (n+1)//2 is equal to (n)/2 + (1//2) \u2192 (n/2) +0.5 \u2192 integer division gives n/2. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) +0.5, which in integer division (like in C) would be n/2.\n\nWait, let's compute for even n=4: (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 integer division (in C) truncates to 2. Which is 4/2=2.\n\nSimilarly, for even n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3.\n\nBut for even n, s is n/2, which is exactly (n+1)/2 when n is even, but since (n+1) is odd, integer division in C would give (n+1)/2 as (n/2) when n is even.\n\nWait, perhaps for even n, (n+1)//2 is equal to n/2 when n is even. Let's see:\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)//2=5//2=2 (same as 4/2=2).\n\nn=6 \u21927//2=3 (same as 6/2=3).\n\nSo for even n, (n+1)//2 equals n/2.\n\nFor odd n: (n+1)/2 is integer. For example, n=5 \u21926/2=3. So in integer division, it's 3.\n\nSo s can be written as (n+1)//2 for all n.\n\nWait, for even n, s is n/2, which is (n+1)//2. For example, n=4: (4+1)//2=2.5\u21922 in integer division, which is n/2=2.\n\nFor odd n=5: (5+1)//2=3.\n\nSo s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, let's test for n=5. S=9. sqrt(9)=3. Which is (5+1)/2=3.\n\nFor even n=6: S=3*4=12. sqrt(12)~3.464, floor is 3. Which is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u21923.5 truncated is 3.\n\nSo yes. So s is (n+1)//2 for all n.\n\nWait, that's a surprising conclusion. Let's test with more examples.\n\nn=7 (odd). (7+1)/2=4. So s=4. S= (7+1)^2/4=64/4=16. sqrt(16)=4. So correct.\n\nn=8 (even). (8+1)//2=4.5\u21924. S=8*10/4=20. sqrt(20)=4.47, floor is4. Correct.\n\nSo for all n, the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, this seems to contradict the example in the problem statement. Let me check the first example.\n\nIn the problem statement, the first test case is n=1. Output is 1. (1+1)//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond test case is n=5. Output is3. Which is (5+1)//2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2. Output is1. (2+1)/2=1.5\u21921. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. sum is 4 (ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2. sum=4). sqrt(4)=2. So s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to hold. Therefore, the solution is to compute (n+1)//2 for each test case. But why? How?\n\nWait, why does this formula work? Let's think again.\n\nFor even n: S = (n/2)(n/2+1). The maximum s is floor( sqrt(S) ). But S = k(k+1) where k =n/2. Then, k^2 < S < (k+1)^2. So floor(sqrt(S)) =k. Which is n/2. So s=k =n/2 = (n+1)//2, since for even n, (n+1) is odd, and (n+1)//2 is (n//2) + 0.5, but integer division in C truncates to n//2. Wait, but (n+1)//2 for even n is (n+1)/2. For even n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u21922. Which is 4//2=2.\n\nFor odd n: S = ((n+1)/2)^2. So sqrt(S) is exactly (n+1)/2, which is integer. So s= (n+1)/2, which is (n+1)//2.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether n is even or odd, s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWow, that's a neat formula. So the answer for each test case is (n+1)//2. So the code can be written as, for each test case, output (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test for n=6. (6+1)//2=3.5\u21923. S=6*8/4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. So floor is 3. Which matches. So yes.\n\nSo the code is simply, for each test case, read n and output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut why does this formula work? Because for even n, the sum S is k*(k+1) where k is n/2. The maximum s is k, which is (n+1)//2. For odd n, the sum is (k)^2, where k is (n+1)/2, so s is k.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward. For each test case, output (n+1)//2.\n\nBut wait, let's test another example. Suppose n=7 (odd). (7+1)//2=4. S is (7+1)^2/4=16. sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\nn=9 (odd): (9+1)/2=5. S=10^2/4=25. sqrt(25)=5. Correct.\n\nn=10 (even). (10+1)//2=5.5\u21925. S=10*12/4=30. sqrt(30)=5.477\u21925. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So the code for each test case is simply output (n+1)/2, using integer division.\n\nBut in C, since n is a long long (since n can be up to 1e9, which fits in 32-bit integer, but when we add 1, it's 1e9+1 which is within 32 bits), but for the division, when using integers, (n+1)/2 would be computed as integer division. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) + 0.5, which when done as integer division, would truncate to n/2. For example, (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2 in C.\n\nWait, but in C, when dividing two integers, it truncates towards zero. So for example, (n+1) is divided by 2. So when n is even, (n+1) is odd, and (n+1)/2 in integer division is (n)/2. Because (even +1) is odd. So for even n:\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=5/2=2 in C (since 5/2 is 2.5, but truncated to 2).\n\nSimilarly, n=6:7/2=3.\n\nBut (n+1)/2 for even n is (n/2) + 0.5, which truncates to n/2.\n\nBut for odd n, (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is integer.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1) / 2);\n\nBut n is up to 1e9, so we can read n as a long long, but in practice, since 1e9 is within the range of a 32-bit integer. But to avoid overflow, perhaps using long long is better.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nFor each test case, read n as a long long, then output (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem statement when n=5, the output is 3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, output is (2+1)/2=1.5 \u21921 in C. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code is simple. The missing code is:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1) / 2);\n\nBut the original code has variables of type int. Wait, no. The code given is:\n\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<math.h>\nint main(){\n    int t;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &t);\n    while(t--){\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nBut the input for n can be up to 1e9, which is 10^9, which is larger than 2^31 (assuming int is 32 bits). So if the code uses int for n, then for n=1e9, it would overflow. So in C, the code must read n as a long long.\n\nSo the correct code inside the loop is:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1)/2);\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1)/2);\n\nBut wait, the original code doesn't include any headers for long long. However, in C, using %lld for long long is correct. So the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the answer is to replace the TODO with:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nprintf(\"%lld\\n\", (n + 1) / 2);"
