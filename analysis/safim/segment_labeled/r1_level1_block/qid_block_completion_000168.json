Let's take the first sample input from the note:\n\nSample Input 1: The array is [1,1,1,1], which has 4 min and 4 max. The input for that case must have l1=4, r1=4, l2=4, r2=4. So in the code, since the ranges [4,4] and [4,4] overlap, z is max(4,4)=4. Which is correct. Another sample input: the third test case in the note. The input is l1=3, r1=3, l2=10, r2=10. So the code's if condition is l2 (10) > r1 (3) \u2192 true. So in this case, the code would set z to l1 + l2 =3+10=13. Which matches the sample's output. The array has 3 min and 10 max, sum 13.

Then, the ranges [2,3] and [4,5] do not overlap. So in the code's 'if' condition, l2 (4) > r1 (3) \u2192 yes, so the code would compute l1 + l2 = 2+4=6.
