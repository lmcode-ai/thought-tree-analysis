So in the example where all candies are eaten and the sums are equal, the code would set the result to the sum of counts.\n\nSo the missing line is that when the sums are equal during the loop, update the result to the maximum between current result and current counts.\n\nYes. So adding that line would make the code work.\n\nTesting with the first sample:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nAfter deque has 1 and 1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nsums are 0 and 0. So result is set to 0. Then, since bobSum is not less than aliceSum (they are equal), we add to aliceSum. So aliceSum becomes 1, count 1. Deque now has 1.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nsums are 0 (bob) and 1 (alice). Bob sum < alice sum. So add to bobSum (1), count 1. Deque is empty.\n\nLoop exits. Then, check if sums are equal (1 ==1). Yes. So result is set to 1+1=2. So the correct answer is printed.\n\nSo during the loop, when sums are 0, the code records 0. Then, at the end, it records 2.\n\nSo the maximum is correctly captured.\n\nAnother example: test case where all candies are eaten and sums are equal. The code would capture during the loop when possible, and also at the end.\n\nSo the missing code is inside the if (bobSum == aliceSum) block, and it's result = Math.max(result, bobCount + aliceCount);\n\nThus, the correct answer is to insert that line."
