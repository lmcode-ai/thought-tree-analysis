Because after checking >=1900, then >=1600 (which would be numbers from 1600 to 1899), then >=1400 would catch 1400 to 1599. Because once a condition is met, the rest are skipped. So the code for the elif num >=1400: line would print Division 3, and the else would handle anything below 1400 (so Division 4). So the missing line is print(\"Division 3\") inside that elif block.
