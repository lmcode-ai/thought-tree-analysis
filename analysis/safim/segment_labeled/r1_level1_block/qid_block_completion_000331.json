For n=1e5, this would be O(n^2) time, which is 1e10 operations. That's way too slow. But with the optimization that j can't go beyond i+99, the inner loop runs at most 100 times per i. So total time is O(1e5 * 100) = 1e7, which is acceptable. So the first thing I need to do is adjust the inner loop to run only up to i+99. But how? In Java, for the inner loop, j starts at i and runs while j < n. But to optimize, j can run up to Math.min(i+99, n-1). So the inner loop should be:\n\nfor (int j=i; j < Math.min(i+100, n); j++). Wait, because the maximum possible length is 100. So for j from i to i+99 (inclusive), that's 100 elements. Because if j starts at i, then the substring s[i..j] has length j -i +1. For j = i+99, the length is 100. So j can't be more than i+99. So the loop should run for j from i to Math.min(i+99, n-1). So the loop becomes:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n && j <= i + 99; j++).

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this Java code to count the number of diverse substrings in a given string. The problem says a substring is diverse if the number of occurrences of each character doesn't exceed the number of distinct characters in it. Hmm.\n\nSo, the code provided has a loop over each starting index i, and then for each j starting from i, it's checking substrings s[i..j]. The current code initializes an array arr of size 10 (for digits 0-9), unq (number of unique characters), and max (maximum count of any character in the current substring). The missing part is inside the inner loop for j.\n\nThe idea is to process each substring by expanding j from i onwards. For each character in position j, we need to update the frequency in arr, track the number of unique characters, and track the maximum frequency. Then check if the maximum frequency is <= the number of unique characters. If yes, then increment the answer.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently update unq and max? Let's think. For each j, when we add the current character (digit) to the substring, we first check if its count was zero before. If so, unq increases by 1. Then increment the count in arr. Then, check if the new count is now the maximum. So, for example, if the previous max was 3 and this character's count becomes 4, then max becomes 4.\n\nSo for each step j:\n\n1. Get the current digit: char c = str.charAt(j). Then digit is c - '0'.\n2. Check if arr[digit] was 0. If yes, increment unq.\n3. Increment arr[digit].\n4. Check if this new arr[digit] is greater than current max. If yes, update max.\n5. After updating, check if max <= unq. If yes, increment ans.\n\nWait, but the condition for diversity is that for every character in the substring, its count <= unq. However, if the maximum of all counts is <= unq, then all counts are automatically <= unq, because the max is the highest. So checking if max <= unq is sufficient. Because if the maximum count is <= the number of unique characters, then all other counts are <= max, hence <= unq.\n\nSo that's the key. So once we have the max and unq for the current substring, we can check if max <= unq. If yes, it's a diverse substring.\n\nSo the steps inside the inner loop are:\n\nAt each j:\n\n- Get the current digit.\n- If the current count of the digit is 0, then unq increases by 1.\n- Increment the count.\n- Check if this new count is larger than current max. If yes, update max.\n- Then, check if max <= unq. If yes, ans +=1.\n\nSo putting this into code:\n\nInside the j loop:\n\nchar c = str.charAt(j);\nint digit = c - '0';\n\nif (arr[digit] == 0) {\n    unq++;\n}\narr[digit]++;\nif (arr[digit] > max) {\n    max = arr[digit];\n}\nif (max <= unq) {\n    ans++;\n}\n\nWait, but what about when the substring's length exceeds 100? Because if the maximum possible unique characters is 10 (digits 0-9), then for a substring longer than 10*10=100, the condition can't be satisfied. Because if there are k unique characters, the maximum possible sum of counts where each count <=k is k *k. So the maximum possible length of a diverse substring is 10*10=100. So for any substring longer than 100, it's impossible to be diverse.\n\nSo to optimize, instead of checking all j up to n-1, we can limit j to i to min(n-1, i + 99). Because once the substring length exceeds 100 (i.e., j >= i+100), it's longer than 100, and the substring can't be diverse. So for j from i to min(i+99, n-1). This is important for performance, since n can be up to 1e5, and without this optimization, the time complexity would be O(n^2), which would be 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nBut the code provided doesn't have this optimization. The original code loops j from i to n-1. So adding that optimization would be crucial.\n\nWait, but the code given in the problem has the inner loop as j from i to n-1. So if we proceed as is, for each i, j runs up to n-1. For n=1e5, this would be O(n^2) time, which is 1e10 operations. That's way too slow. But with the optimization that j can't go beyond i+99, the inner loop runs at most 100 times per i. So total time is O(1e5 * 100) = 1e7, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is adjust the inner loop to run only up to i+99. But how?\n\nIn Java, for the inner loop, j starts at i and runs while j < n. But to optimize, j can run up to Math.min(i+99, n-1). So the inner loop should be:\n\nfor (int j=i; j < Math.min(i+100, n); j++).\n\nWait, because the maximum possible length is 100. So for j from i to i+99 (inclusive), that's 100 elements. Because if j starts at i, then the substring s[i..j] has length j -i +1. For j = i+99, the length is 100. So j can't be more than i+99. So the loop should run for j from i to Math.min(i+99, n-1). So the loop becomes:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n && j <= i + 99; j++).\n\nSo this is crucial for the code to pass within time constraints.\n\nBut the original code provided in the problem does not have this optimization. The user's code has the inner loop as for(int j=i;j<n;j++). So the missing code must include this optimization. But how?\n\nWait, the code to be completed is the inner part of the j loop. So perhaps, even with the existing loop structure, adding this optimization is part of the code. Wait, but in the code provided, the inner loop is written as:\n\nfor(int j=i;j<n;j++){ ... }\n\nSo changing this to j up to i+99 is necessary. But the code provided already has the loop structure. So perhaps the user expects that in the code, but in the problem statement, the code is given with the loop for j from i to n-1, and the user is supposed to fill in the missing code.\n\nWait, the problem says that the code has missing lines or blocks that must be filled. So perhaps the code is structured such that the inner loop runs j from i to n-1, but we need to break early once the substring becomes longer than 100 characters. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct as written, but the inner loop's body includes a check to break early if the substring length exceeds 100. Wait, but the loop runs j from i to n-1. So the length of the substring s[i..j] is j -i +1. So when j -i +1 exceeds 100, which is when j >= i +100. So once j reaches i+100, the substring length is 101, which is impossible. So in the inner loop, after the code that processes the current j, we can check if the current substring's length is 100. Once it's 100, the next j would make it 101, which is impossible. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible length is 100. So for j from i to i+99, the length is 100. So j can be up to i+99.\n\nSo the inner loop should run for j from i to i+99, but not beyond the string length. So in the code, the inner loop is:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n && j <= i + 99; j++)\n\nBut the existing code's inner loop is written as for (int j=i; j <n; j++). So modifying the loop condition is necessary for the code to be efficient. But this is part of the code structure provided. However, in the problem statement, the code has the inner loop as:\n\nfor(int j=i;j<n;j++){\n\n}\n\nSo perhaps the code as written is not optimized and will lead to TLE. Therefore, the code must have the inner loop's condition modified to j <= i+99. But how can the user fill in the code when the loop is already written as j <n?\n\nWait, perhaps the code that needs to be filled is in the loop, and in that loop, we can check if the current length (j -i +1) exceeds 100, and break. For example, inside the loop:\n\nif (j -i +1 > 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nSo that after processing j, when the substring becomes longer than 100, we break. Because the maximum allowed length is 100. So for each j, after processing, check if the length is 100. If not, continue. Otherwise, process and break. Wait, but j is incremented each time. So for example, j starts at i. The first substring is length 1, then 2, up to 100. So when j = i +99, the length is 100. Then j increments to i+100, which would be length 101, but then we check if (j -i +1 > 100) which is 101>100, so break. But in the code, the loop is written as j starting from i, and incrementing each time. So adding this check inside the loop would allow the loop to process j up to i+99 (since j -i +1 for j=i+99 is 100). Then j becomes i+100, and j-i+1 is 101, so we break.\n\nSo in the code, inside the inner loop (for j), after processing the current j, check if the length is over 100 and break.\n\nWait, but the code in the inner loop would process j even if it's i+100, but in that case, the length is 101. So the code should break when j -i +1 exceeds 100. So inside the loop, after processing j, we check if (j -i +1) >= 100, then break. Wait, because if j is i+99, the length is 100, which is allowed. Then j increments to i+100, which is length 101. So the code would process j from i to i+100, but break in the next iteration.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. The loop is:\n\nfor (j = i; j <n; j++) {\n   process j\n   if (j -i +1 > 100) break;\n}\n\nWait, no. Because j starts at i. For each j, j -i +1 is the length. For j = i: length 1. j=i+99: length 100. j=i+100: length 101. So in the loop, after processing j, check if the length exceeds 100, and break. So the loop would process j=i, then check if 1>100? No. Then j increments to i+1. Process, check 2>100? No. Continue up to j=i+99 (length 100). Then check 100>100? No. Then j increments to i+100. If i+100 <n, then process j=i+100. Then j -i +1 is 101. Check if 101>100 \u2192 yes \u2192 break. So in this case, the loop would process j=i+100, which is length 101, which is invalid. But that's not allowed. So to avoid processing j=i+100, the check should be after processing j but before incrementing. Wait, perhaps the check is better done before processing j. No, because the code has to process j up to j=i+99 (length 100). So the correct approach is to break after processing j=i+99.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should break after processing j, but only if the length is exactly 100. Because after that, the next j would be 101. So perhaps the code should break after processing j when the length is 100. Because once the length is 100, the next iteration will process j+1, which is 101, which is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should break after processing j, if the current substring's length is 100, to prevent further processing. Because after that, any longer substring can't be valid. So during the loop:\n\nfor j from i to n-1:\n\n   process the current j (i.e., add to frequency array, check conditions, etc.)\n\n   if (j -i +1 == 100) break;\n\nBecause once the substring reaches length 100, the next j would make it 101, which is invalid. So after processing j=i+99 (length 100), we break. So the code inside the loop would have:\n\nif (j - i + 1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nThis way, the loop runs for j from i up to i+99, and then breaks. So the inner loop runs for at most 100 iterations per i.\n\nThis is crucial for the code to run efficiently. So the code for the inner loop would be:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n; j++) {\n\n   // process j\n\n   if ((j - i + 1) > 100) {\n       break;\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when j is i, j -i +1 is 1. So the check would be 1>100? No. Then proceed. Then j increments. So j can be up to i+100, which would be length 101. So the check is after processing. So to avoid that, perhaps the check should be made before processing j. But no, because in the loop condition, j is allowed to be up to n-1. So the correct way is to process j, then check if the length is over 100 and break. But how?\n\nWait, the maximum allowed length is 100. So for a substring starting at i, the maximum possible j is i+99 (so the length is 100). So when j reaches i+99, the next j is i+100, which would make length 101. So, the inner loop should stop when j exceeds i+99. So, during the loop, after processing j, check if j -i +1 exceeds 100. If yes, break.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInside the j loop:\n\nprocess the current j (update frequency, check if diverse, etc.)\n\nif (j - i + 1 > 100) {\n   break;\n}\n\nWait, no. Because when j is i+99, j-i+1 is 100. Then, we process j and continue. Then j increments to i+100. j -i +1 is 101. Then we process j, but the code would check if 101>100, then break. But processing j when it's i+100 is invalid. So the code would process j up to i+100, which is a substring of length 101, which is invalid. That's not acceptable.\n\nSo the solution is to break before processing j if the length exceeds 100. So the code should check the length before processing j. But how to do that in the loop structure?\n\nAlternatively, the code can check the current length (after adding j) and break if it's over 100. But this is tricky. Let's think.\n\nWait, the substring is from i to j, inclusive. So for each j, the length is j -i +1.\n\nIn the inner loop:\n\nfor (j =i; j <n; j++) {\n\n   // process j\n\n   // then check if the current substring's length is over 100 and break\n\n}\n\nBut in this case, when j is i+99, the length is 100. Then, after processing j, the code would check if 100>100? No, so no break. Then j increments to i+100. Process j (length 101), which is invalid. But during processing, even though the substring is invalid, the code would check if max <= unq, which for a length 101 substring, the maximum possible unq is 10. So max must be >= 101/10 = 10.1, but for 10 unique characters, the max count is 10. So 10*10=100, but the length is 101. So this substring can't be valid. But during processing, even if we check, it's impossible. However, the code will process it and waste time.\n\nSo to optimize, the code must break the loop once the substring length exceeds 100. So the check is after processing j, but before incrementing j. Wait, no. Because in the for loop, j increments at the end of each iteration.\n\nSo the solution is: after processing the current j, check if the substring's length is 100. If yes, then break. Because the next j will make it 101.\n\nWait, when j is i+99, the length is 100. Then, after processing, check if (j -i +1) == 100, then break. Because the next j will be i+100, which makes the length 101.\n\nSo inside the loop, after processing j, we do:\n\nif (j -i +1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nThis way, once the substring reaches length 100, we break the loop, and don't process any longer substrings.\n\nThis will limit the inner loop to at most 100 iterations per i.\n\nSo the code inside the inner loop would be:\n\nchar c = str.charAt(j);\nint digit = c - '0';\nif (arr[digit] == 0) {\n    unq++;\n}\narr[digit]++;\nif (arr[digit] > max) {\n    max = arr[digit];\n}\nif (max <= unq) {\n    ans++;\n}\nif (j -i +1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nThis way, after processing j=i+99 (length 100), the code breaks and stops processing further j's.\n\nThis is the key optimization needed to pass the time constraints.\n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code inside the j loop is:\n\nint digit = str.charAt(j) - '0';\nif (arr[digit] == 0) {\n    unq++;\n}\narr[digit]++;\nmax = Math.max(max, arr[digit]);\nif (max <= unq) {\n    ans++;\n}\nif (j - i + 1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nWait, but wait, after updating arr[digit], we need to check if that's the new maximum. So the line:\n\nif (arr[digit] > max) {\n    max = arr[digit];\n}\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nmax = Math.max(max, arr[digit]);\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo the code inside the j loop is:\n\nchar currentChar = str.charAt(j);\nint digit = currentChar - '0';\nif (arr[digit] == 0) {\n    unq++;\n}\narr[digit]++;\nmax = Math.max(max, arr[digit]);\nif (max <= unq) {\n    ans++;\n}\nif (j - i + 1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nSo this is the code that needs to be filled in the TODO section.\n\nThus, the missing code inside the inner loop is the code that updates arr, unq, max, checks the condition, and breaks if the substring length is 100.\n\nSo putting this all together, the code inside the loop is:\n\nint digit = str.charAt(j) - '0';\nif (arr[digit] == 0) {\n    unq++;\n}\narr[digit]++;\nif (arr[digit] > max) {\n    max = arr[digit];\n}\nif (max <= unq) {\n    ans++;\n}\nif (j - i + 1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code to be added is:\n\nint digit = str.charAt(j) - '0';\nif (arr[digit] == 0) {\n    unq++;\n}\narr[digit]++;\nmax = Math.max(max, arr[digit]);\nif (max <= unq) {\n    ans++;\n}\nif (j - i + 1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nBut in Java, the syntax is:\n\nint digit = s.charAt(j) - '0';\n\nSo the code inside the loop is:\n\nint digit = str.charAt(j) - '0';\nif (arr[digit] == 0) {\n    unq++;\n}\narr[digit]++;\nmax = Math.max(max, arr[digit]);\nif (max <= unq) {\n    ans++;\n}\nif (j - i + 1 == 100) {\n    break;\n}\n\nYes.\n\nSo the missing code is this part."
