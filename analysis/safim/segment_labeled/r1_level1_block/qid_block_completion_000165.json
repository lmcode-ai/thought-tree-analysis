Otherwise, case 1 is not possible.\n\nCase 2: The minimal sum is (l1 + l2). Because to get the minimal sum, we take the minimal possible counts for both min and max. But wait, maybe not. Because the min_count can be any value between l1 and r1, and max_count can be any between l2 and r2. So the minimal sum would be l1 + l2. But perhaps that's the case.\n\nSo for case 2, the minimal sum is l1 + l2. So the total elements would be l1 + l2.\n\nBut wait, there's a problem. Suppose case 1 is possible, but case 2's sum is smaller than case 1's value. For example, if l1=1, r1=5, l2=1, r2=5. Then case 1's minimal is max(1,1) =1, which would require a sum of 1. But case 2's sum is 1+1=2. So case 1 gives a better (smaller) result. So in that case, the answer would be 1.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\nFor each test case, compute two possibilities:\n\na) The minimal possible when min and max are the same. This is possible only if there's an overlap between the ranges [l1, r1] and [l2, r2]. The value for this case is the smallest possible count in the overlapping region, which is max(l1, l2).\n\nb) The minimal possible when min and max are different. This is the sum of the minimal counts for each, which is l1 + l2.\n\nThen the answer is the minimum between these two possibilities (if both are possible).

The answer is the minimum of these two.\n\nBut wait, why is case a's value the maximum of l1 and l2? Because in order to satisfy both l1 and l2, the count must be at least the maximum of l1 and l2, and at most the minimum of r1 and r2. But the minimal possible in that overlapping range is the maximum of l1 and l2. So, for example, if l1=3 and l2=2, then the minimal is 3. So case a's value is 3, which is the minimal possible count that satisfies both ranges.\n\nSo, the minimal possible in case a is max(l1, l2).\n\nThus, the overall answer is the minimum between:\n\n- max(l1, l2) (if possible, i.e., if the ranges overlap)\n\n- l1 + l2 (case b)\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute possible1 (if possible):\n\noverlap_low = max(l1, l2)\n\noverlap_high = min(r1, r2)\n\nif overlap_low <= overlap_high:\n\n   possible1 = overlap_low\n\nelse:\n\n   possible1 = infinity (meaning not possible)\n\npossible2 = l1 + l2\n\nanswer = min(possible1, possible2)\n\nBut wait, what if possible1 is possible? Then the answer is the smaller of possible1 and possible2. Otherwise, it's possible2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint possible1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n\nint overlapLow = Math.max(l1, l2);\n\nint overlapHigh = Math.min(r1, r2);\n\nif (overlapLow <= overlapHigh) {\n\n    possible1 = overlapLow;\n\n}\n\nint possible2 = l1 + l2;\n\nint ans = Math.min(possible1, possible2);\n\nThen output ans.\n\nWait, but let's test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe first example in the note says:\n\nTest case 1: [1,1,1,1] has 4 min and 4 max. So l1=4, r1=4, l2=4, r2=4? Wait, the first sample in the note says:\n\nSample Input:\n\nIn the note, the first test case's optimal array is [1,1,1,1], which has 4 min and 4 max. So for that test case, the input must have l1=4, r1=4, l2=4, r2=4. Then possible1 is max(4,4)=4. possible2 is 4+4=8. So the answer is 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: The fifth example in the note:\n\nTest case 5: [4,6,6], which has 1 min (the 4) and 2 max (the two 6s). So l1 is 1, r1 is something that allows 1, and l2 is 2, r2 allows 2. So input for this test case would be l1=1, r1=1, l2=2, r2=2. Then possible1 is max(1,2) =2. But the ranges [1,1] and [2,2] don't overlap. So possible1 is not possible. So the answer is possible2: 1+2=3. Which matches the array's size of 3.\n\nAnother example in the note: test case 3 has [1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], which has 3 min and 10 max. The input here must have l1=3 (allowed min count), r1=3, l2=10, r2=10. So possible1: check if [3,3] and [10,10] overlap. No. So possible1 is impossible. So the answer is 3 +10=13, which is the array's length.\n\nBut in the sample note, that array's count is 3 min and 10 max, summing to 13. So the code would output 13.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, possible2 is l1 + l2, which in this case is 3 +10=13, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if l1=3, r1=5, l2=5, r2=7. Then possible1 is max(3,5)=5. Check if 5 <= min(5,7) \u2192 5 <=5 \u2192 yes. So possible1 is 5. possible2 is 3+5=8. So answer is min(5,8)=5. Which would be better.\n\nSo the code's logic seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nFor each test case, read l1, r1, l2, r2.\n\nCompute possible1: if the max of l1 and l2 is <= min of r1 and r2, then possible1 is max(l1,l2). Else, possible1 is not possible.\n\npossible2 is l1 + l2.\n\nThe answer is the minimum of possible1 (if possible) and possible2.\n\nWait, but possible1 could be not possible. For example, when possible1 is infinity. So, the code needs to take the minimum between possible1 (if possible) and possible2, but if possible1 is not possible, then the answer is possible2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint l1 = ...;\n\nint r1 = ...;\n\nint l2 = ...;\n\nint r2 = ...;\n\nint possible1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n\nint overlapLow = Math.max(l1, l2);\n\nint overlapHigh = Math.min(r1, r2);\n\nif (overlapLow <= overlapHigh) {\n\n    possible1 = overlapLow;\n\n}\n\nint possible2 = l1 + l2;\n\nint ans = Math.min(possible1, possible2);\n\nSystem.out.println(ans);\n\nWait, but what if possible1 is Integer.MAX_VALUE? Then possible2 could be smaller. For example, possible2 is 5, possible1 is MAX_VALUE. Then Math.min(5, MAX_VALUE) is 5. So that's correct.\n\nYes. Because if possible1 is not possible, then possible1 is MAX_VALUE, and possible2 is the sum, which is the answer.\n\nSo this code would handle all cases.\n\nSo the problem reduces to implementing this logic in Java.\n\nNow, looking back at the code given. The user has provided a code skeleton where the main method reads t test cases. For each test case, we need to read l1, r1, l2, r2, compute the answer as per above, and output it.\n\nSo the code inside the loop for each test case should be:\n\nint l1 = in.nextInt();\n\nint r1 = in.nextInt();\n\nint l2 = in.nextInt();\n\nint r2 = in.nextInt();\n\nThen compute possible1 and possible2 as discussed.\n\nThen output the minimum.\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input given in the note's first example:\n\nSample Input:\n\nLooking at the note's first example:\n\nThe first test case's input must have l1=4, r1=4, l2=4, r2=4. So the possible1 is 4, possible2 is 8. The answer is 4.\n\nAnother sample in the note: the third test case's input is such that possible1 is not possible, so answer is possible2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the missing code is to read the four integers, compute the possible1 and possible2, then output the minimum.\n\nSo the code inside the loop for each test case is:\n\nint l1 = in.nextInt();\n\nint r1 = in.nextInt();\n\nint l2 = in.nextInt();\n\nint r2 = in.nextInt();\n\nint overlapLow = Math.max(l1, l2);\n\nint overlapHigh = Math.min(r1, r2);\n\nint possible1 = (overlapLow <= overlapHigh) ? overlapLow : Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n\nint possible2 = l1 + l2;\n\nint ans = Math.min(possible1, possible2);\n\nSystem.out.println(ans);\n\nYes.\n\nSo the missing code is reading the four integers and then computing ans as described.\n\nSo the complete code for the test case loop is:\n\nfor(int t = in.nextInt();t>0;t--)\n\n{\n\n    int l1 = in.nextInt();\n\n    int r1 = in.nextInt();\n\n    int l2 = in.nextInt();\n\n    int r2 = in.nextInt();\n\n    int overlapLow = Math.max(l1, l2);\n\n    int overlapHigh = Math.min(r1, r2);\n\n    int possible1 = overlapLow <= overlapHigh ? overlapLow : Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n\n    int possible2 = l1 + l2;\n\n    int ans = Math.min(possible1, possible2);\n\n    System.out.println(ans);\n\n}\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code that needs to be filled in the TODO section."
