Then the sequence from left to right: b_{i-2}=3, b_{i-1}=2, b_i=0 -> but 3>2, which is not increasing to the right?

So we require b_k >= prev+1. The smallest multiple of a[k] that is >= prev+1 is: ceil((prev+1)/a[k]) * a[k]. Then the number of moves is x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k]). Then we set prev = a[k] * x, for the next element. So the right part would be:\n\n        while k<len(a):\n            x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n            temp += x\n            prev = a[k] * x\n            k+=1\n\n   But note: in the left part, we are moving from i-1 down to 0, and in the right part from i+1 to len(a)-1.

Left part (j=1,0):\n        j=1: \n            prev = 0\n            x = ceil((0+1)/2) = ceil(0.5)=1. temp += 1 -> 1.\n            prev = 2*1 = 2.\n        j=0: x = ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3.\n            temp += 3 -> 4.\n            prev = 1*3 = 3. Right part (k=3,4):\n        k=3:\n            prev = 0 (from the fixed element i=2) -> wait, should we start the right part with the fixed element as the previous? But note: the right part starts at k=i+1, and the first element to the right should be > b_i=0.

In the right part, we start with prev=0, and then we do for k in range(i+1, n). This should work. Let me test with the sample: n=5, a=[1,2,1,1,1], i=2 (0-indexed), right part:\n        k=3: \n            prev=0\n            x = (0 // a[3]) + 1 = (0//1)+1 = 0+1=1.\n            temp=0+1=1.\n            prev=1*1=1. k=4: x = (1//1)+1 = 1+1=2.\n            temp=1+2=3.\n            prev=2*1=2. then the left part for i=2: \n        j=1: \n            prev=0 ( initially for the fixed element)\n            x = ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1.\n            temp=0+1=1.\n            prev=2.\n        j=0:\n            x=ceil((2+1)/1)=3.\n            temp=1+3=4. total = 4 (left) + 3 (right) = 7.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the minimum number of moves to make array b (initially zeros) strictly increasing by performing moves that either add or subtract a_i to b_i.\n\nThe provided code in program1.py has a loop that iterates over each index i. For each i, it initializes an array t (which doesn't seem to be used) and a variable temp to accumulate the number of moves. Then it processes the left part (from i-1 down to 0) and the right part (from i+1 to the end). The left part is already implemented: for each j from i-1 down to 0, it calculates the minimum number of moves (as x) such that the value at j (which we are building) is less than the next value (which is built in the next step). Specifically, we require that the value at j (which is a_j * x, but note: we can subtract so x can be negative? Actually, the code uses ceil and positive x) must be less than the next value (which is stored in 'prev' for the next left element). Actually, the left part is built from the rightmost left element (i-1) to the leftmost. The idea is to set the value at position i to 0? Actually, the problem does not require the starting value to be fixed.\n\nBut note: the example: \nExample 1: n=5, a = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. The solution subtracts a1 from b1 (so b1 becomes -1) and then adds a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5 (so they become 1,1,1). Then the array is [-1,0,1,1,1] -> but wait, that is not strictly increasing because the last three are not strictly increasing. Actually, the example says: final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. How?\n\nActually, the example says: subtract a1 from b1 -> b1 = -1, then add a3 to b3 -> b3=1, then add a4 to b4 -> 1+1=2? but that would be 2, but they say 4? Wait, they say: add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively. So b3 = 1, b4=1, b5=1? That doesn't work. Then they say the array becomes [-1,0,3,4,5]. How? \n\nActually, the moves: \n- subtract a1: b1 = -1\n- then for b3: we add a3 three times? so 1+1+1 = 3? \n- then for b4: we add a4 four times? 1*4=4?\n- then for b5: we add a5 five times? 1*5=5?\n\nBut that would be 1 (for b1) + 3 (for b3) + 4 (for b4) + 5 (for b5) = 13 moves? but the example says 4 moves.\n\nWait, the example says: subtract a1 (1 move) and then add a3 (1 move), a4 (1 move), a5 (1 move) -> total 4 moves. Then the array becomes: \nb1 = -1, b2 remains 0, b3=1, b4=1, b5=1 -> but then we have: \n-1, 0, 1, 1, 1 -> which is not strictly increasing because 1 is not greater than 1.\n\nBut the example says the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. How do they get 3,4,5? \n\nThey must have done:\nb1 = -1 (by subtracting a1 once: 1 move)\nb2 remains 0? (0 moves)\nb3: they add a3 three times? -> 3 moves -> total moves 4? then b3=3\nb4: they add a4 four times? -> 4 moves? but that would be 8 moves total? \n\nAlternatively, they might have set b3 to 3 by adding three times, but that is 3 moves. Then b4 must be at least 4? so they add a4 four times? 4 moves? then total moves 1+3+4=8? \n\nBut the example says 4 moves.\n\nRethink: the problem says: \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\nSo for b3, we can only add a3 (which is 1) or subtract a3. To get 3, we must add a3 three times: 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, for b4: to get 4, we need 4 moves? and for b5: 5 moves? total 1 (for b1) + 3 (for b3) + 4 (for b4) + 5 (for b5) = 13 moves? \n\nBut the example says 4 moves. \n\nLooking at the example: \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\"\n\nHow? They must have done:\n- subtract a1: b1 becomes -1 (1 move)\n- then for b3: they add a3 three times? (3 moves) -> total 4 moves? but then what about b4 and b5? they are still 0? \n\nWait, the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5\" to b3, b4, and b5 respectively. But that would be one move for each: so 3 moves. Then total 4 moves. Then the values: \nb1 = -1 (from subtracting a1 once: -1)\nb2 = 0 (unchanged)\nb3 = 0 + a3 = 1\nb4 = 0 + a4 = 1\nb5 = 0 + a5 = 1\n\nThat gives [-1,0,1,1,1] -> not strictly increasing.\n\nBut the example says the array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nSo there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nActually, the example says: \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> b1 = -1 (1 move)\nthen \"add a3\" -> b3 = 1 (1 move) -> total 2 moves? \nthen \"add a4\" -> b4 = 1 (1 move) -> total 3 moves?\nthen \"add a5\" -> b5 = 1 (1 move) -> total 4 moves.\n\nBut then the array is [-1,0,1,1,1] -> which is not strictly increasing.\n\nThe example output is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nHow? They must have done multiple moves on the same index? \n\nThe problem says: we can choose an integer i and then add OR subtract a_i to b_i. And we can choose the same i multiple times.\n\nSo to get b3=3, we must choose i=3 three times (each time adding a3=1) -> 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, for b4: 4 moves? and for b5: 5 moves? then total moves = 1 (for b1) + 3 (for b3) + 4 (for b4) + 5 (for b5) = 13.\n\nBut the example says 4 moves.\n\nAlternatively, they might have set b3 to 3 by three moves, but then b4 must be at least 4? so 4 moves for b4? and b5 at least 5? 5 moves? total 1+3+4+5=13.\n\nBut the example says 4 moves.\n\nI see the example in the note: Example 2: n=7, a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> they reach [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3] in 10 moves? \nHow? \nTo get -3 at index0: subtract 1 three times -> 3 moves.\n-2 at index1: subtract 1 two times -> 2 moves.\n-1 at index2: subtract 1 one time -> 1 move.\n0 at index3: 0 moves? (but initially 0) -> 0 moves.\n1 at index4: add 1 one time -> 1 move.\n2 at index5: add 1 two times -> 2 moves.\n3 at index6: add 1 three times -> 3 moves.\nTotal: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12 moves? but they say 10.\n\nAlternatively, they might have done:\nindex0: subtract 3 times -> 3 moves -> -3\nindex1: subtract 2 times -> 2 moves -> -2\nindex2: subtract 1 time -> 1 move -> -1\nindex3: 0 -> 0 moves\nindex4: add 1 time -> 1 move -> 1\nindex5: add 2 times -> 2 moves -> 2\nindex6: add 3 times -> 3 moves -> 3\nTotal: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nBut 12 != 10.\n\nWait, the example says: \"you can reach [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3] in 10 moves\". How?\n\nAnother possibility: we are allowed to do multiple moves on the same index arbitrarily. But the moves are independent per index? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that we do moves in a fixed order. However, the moves are independent: each move is on one index and we can do as many as we want.\n\nBut the example 2: \nWe have a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nWe want: \nb0 = -3 -> 3 moves (subtract 3 times)\nb1 = -2 -> 2 moves (subtract 2 times)\nb2 = -1 -> 1 move (subtract 1 time)\nb3 = 0 -> 0 moves\nb4 = 1 -> 1 move (add 1 time)\nb5 = 2 -> 2 moves (add 2 times)\nb6 = 3 -> 3 moves (add 3 times)\nTotal: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nAlternatively, they might have done:\nb0: subtract 3 -> 3 moves\nb1: subtract 2 -> 2 moves\nb2: subtract 1 -> 1 move\nb3: 0 -> 0\nb4: add 1 -> 1 move\nb5: add 2 -> 2 moves\nb6: add 1? and then add 2? no.\n\nWait, the example output is 10 moves. \n\nI see: the problem says \"minimum number of moves\". Maybe we can set the entire array with a common base? \n\nBut note: the moves are independent per index. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\nb0: subtract 3 -> 3 moves\nb1: subtract 2 -> 2 moves\nb2: subtract 1 -> 1 move\nb3: 0 -> 0\nb4: add 1 -> 1 move\nb5: add 1 twice? -> 2 moves? but that would be 2 moves for 2? \nb6: add 1 three times? -> 3 moves? total 3+2+1+0+1+2+3=12.\n\nBut 12.\n\nWait, the example says 10. \n\nI see the note: \"Example 2: you can reach [\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3] in 10 moves.\"\n\nHow? \n\nAnother idea: we can do multiple moves on the same index arbitrarily, but we are free to assign any integer value to each b_i? as long as it is a multiple of a_i? (because we start at 0 and then add or subtract multiples of a_i). \n\nBut the value at b_i must be k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (positive for adding, negative for subtracting). \n\nSo for a_i=1, then b_i can be any integer.\n\nWe require: \nb0 = -3 -> k0 = -3 -> 3 moves (because |k0|=3)\nb1 = -2 -> k1 = -2 -> 2 moves\nb2 = -1 -> k2 = -1 -> 1 move\nb3 = 0 -> k3=0 -> 0 moves\nb4 = 1 -> k4=1 -> 1 move\nb5 = 2 -> k5=2 -> 2 moves\nb6 = 3 -> k6=3 -> 3 moves\nTotal moves = 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nBut 12 != 10.\n\nWait, the example says 10. \n\nI see: the problem does not require that the moves are the absolute value of the multiple? because one move is one operation. So if we subtract 3 times, that's 3 moves. \n\nBut 12 is 12.\n\nAlternatively, the example might be using a different assignment? \n\nWe require: \nb0 < b1 < b2 < ... < b6.\n\nBut we are not forced to set b0=-3, b1=-2, etc. We can set any multiples.\n\nFor example, we could set:\nb0 = -3 (3 moves)\nb1 = -1 (1 move: subtract once) -> then we have -3, -1 -> then b2 must be at least 0? \nb2 = 0 (0 moves) -> but then we have -3, -1, 0 -> then b3 must be at least 1? \nb3 = 1 (1 move) -> then b4=2 (2 moves: add twice) -> but wait, we can set b4=2 by two moves? \nb5=3 (3 moves)\nb6=4 (4 moves)\n\nTotal: 3+1+0+1+2+3+4 = 14.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, we can set:\nb0 = 0 (0 moves) -> but then b1 must be at least 1? \nb1 = 1 (1 move)\nb2 = 2 (2 moves)\nb3 = 3 (3 moves)\nb4 = 4 (4 moves)\nb5 = 5 (5 moves)\nb6 = 6 (6 moves)\nTotal: 0+1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr set negatives:\nb0 = -6 (6 moves)\nb1 = -5 (5 moves)\nb2 = -4 (4 moves)\nb3 = -3 (3 moves)\nb4 = -2 (2 moves)\nb5 = -1 (1 move)\nb6 = 0 (0 moves)\nTotal: 6+5+4+3+2+1+0 = 21.\n\nStill not 10.\n\nHow 10? \n\nI see: the problem does not require that the entire sequence is increasing by at least 1? it only requires strictly increasing. So the gaps can be more than 1? \n\nBut then why not set:\nb0 = -3 (3 moves)\nb1 = 0 (0 moves) -> then we have -3,0 -> then b2 must be at least 1? \nb2 = 1 (1 move)\nb3 = 2 (2 moves) -> wait, but we can set b3=2 by two moves? \nb4=3 (3 moves)\nb5=4 (4 moves)\nb6=5 (5 moves)\nTotal: 3+0+1+2+3+4+5 = 18.\n\nNot 10.\n\nAlternatively, we can set:\nb0 = -3 (3 moves)\nb1 = -3 + 1 = -2? -> but we cannot do that because we can only add or subtract multiples of a_i. For a_i=1, we can set any integer. So we can set b1 to -2 by subtracting twice? 2 moves? \nThen we have: -3, -2 -> then b2 must be at least -1? \nb2 = -1 (1 move: subtract once) -> then we have -3,-2,-1 -> then b3=0 (0 moves) -> then b4=1 (1 move) -> b5=2 (2 moves) -> b6=3 (3 moves)\nTotal: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nStill 12.\n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nI see the example: \"Example 2: you can reach [\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3] in 10 moves.\"\n\nHow 10? \n\nWait, the total moves are 3 (for -3) + 2 (for -2) + 1 (for -1) + 0 (for 0) + 1 (for 1) + 2 (for 2) + 3 (for 3) = 12. \n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nUnless the example is not using the same a_i for each index? \n\nBut the problem says: a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] for example 2? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"Example 2: you can reach [\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3] in 10 moves.\" without giving the array a. \n\nBut the input specification says: the array a is given. \n\nSo for example 2, the array a might be different? \n\nLooking at the problem statement: Example 2 is not provided with the array a. \n\nBut the note says: \"Example 2: ... in 10 moves\". \n\nSo I think the example 2 is for n=7 and a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n\nBut then 12 moves.\n\nAlternatively, the example might be using a different sequence? \n\nWe are allowed to set the values arbitrarily as long as b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nBut for a_i=1, we can set any integer. \n\nBut the minimal moves is the sum of the absolute values of the multiples? \n\nBut the multiples are: \nb0 = -3 -> multiple = -3 -> moves = 3\nb1 = -2 -> multiple = -2 -> moves = 2\nb2 = -1 -> multiple = -1 -> moves = 1\nb3 = 0 -> multiple = 0 -> moves = 0\nb4 = 1 -> multiple = 1 -> moves = 1\nb5 = 2 -> multiple = 2 -> moves = 2\nb6 = 3 -> multiple = 3 -> moves = 3\nSum = 12.\n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nUnless we can set the values in a way that the multiples are not the absolute values? \n\nNo, because each move is one operation. \n\nAnother possibility: the example might be using a different assignment of values? \n\nWe are not forced to set the values to -3,-2,...,3. We can set any strictly increasing sequence of multiples. \n\nFor example, we can set:\nb0 = -3 (3 moves)\nb1 = -1 (1 move) -> then we have -3, -1 -> then b2 must be at least 0? \nb2 = 0 (0 moves) -> then b3 = 1 (1 move) -> b4 = 2 (2 moves) -> b5 = 3 (3 moves) -> b6 = 4 (4 moves) -> total 3+1+0+1+2+3+4=14.\n\nOr:\nb0 = -3 (3 moves)\nb1 = 0 (0 moves) -> then b2 = 1 (1 move) -> b3 = 2 (2 moves) -> b4 = 3 (3 moves) -> b5 = 4 (4 moves) -> b6 = 5 (5 moves) -> total 3+0+1+2+3+4+5=18.\n\nOr:\nb0 = 0 (0 moves)\nb1 = 1 (1 move)\nb2 = 3 (3 moves) -> because we require b2>1, so at least 2, but we can set to 3? then moves=3\nb3 = 4 (1 move: because 4-3=1, so we add once) -> wait, no: we start at 0 and then we add or subtract. So for b2, we can only set to multiples of a2=1. We set to 3 by adding three times: 3 moves.\nb3: we require >3, so at least 4. We set to 4 by adding four times? but then we start from 0, so 4 moves? \nBut we can also set b3 to 4 by adding four times: 4 moves.\nTotal: 0+1+3+4 = 8 for the first four, then b4, b5, b6: at least 5,6,7 -> 5+6+7=18 moves? total 0+1+3+4+5+6+7=26.\n\nNot 10.\n\nHow to get 10? \n\nI see: the problem might be solved by a dynamic programming or greedy method. \n\nInsight: we are allowed to choose any integer value for b_i as long as it is a multiple of a_i. We wish to minimize the total number of moves (which is the sum of the absolute values of the multiples) and have b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}.\n\nWe can let b_i = x_i * a_i, where x_i is an integer (positive or negative).\n\nWe require: x0 * a0 < x1 * a1 < ... < x_{n-1} * a_{n-1}.\n\nAnd we wish to minimize sum_i |x_i|.\n\nThis is a classical problem. \n\nBut note: the provided code in program1.py has a particular structure: it iterates over a fixed index i, and then processes the left part and the right part. In the left part, it goes from j=i-1 down to 0, and for each j, it calculates:\n\n   x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n   temp += x\n   prev = a[j] * x\n\nBut note: 'prev' here is the value at j+1? and we require b_j < b_{j+1} = prev.\n\nSo we require: b_j < prev -> so b_j <= prev-1.\n\nBut b_j must be a multiple of a_j, and we want the smallest number of moves (which is |x|) that makes b_j <= prev-1. However, we also want to minimize the total moves and also we want to leave as much room as possible for the elements to the left? \n\nThe code for the left part uses:\n\n   x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n\nBut then it sets prev = a[j] * x.\n\nAnd then moves to the next left.\n\nBut note: ceil((prev+1)/a[j]) might be negative? \n\nLet me try with the example: a = [1,2,1,1,1] and i=1 (0-indexed). \n\nThe code sets i=1. Then it processes the left part: j=0.\n\nprev initially = 0 (from the element at i=1, which is set to 0?).\n\nThen for j=0: \n   x = ceil((0+1)/a[0]) = ceil(1/1)=1.\n   temp += 1 -> 1.\n   prev = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nThen it processes the right part: from k=2 to 4.\n\nBut the right part is not implemented.\n\nThen the total moves for this i=1 is temp (from left) + temp_right.\n\nThen we take the minimum over i.\n\nWhat is the idea? \n\nThe code seems to fix b_i = 0. Then for the left part, it builds a sequence such that b_{i-1} < b_i = 0, then b_{i-2} < b_{i-1}, etc. And similarly for the right part: b_{i+1} > b_i = 0, then b_{i+2} > b_{i+1}, etc.\n\nFor the left part: \n   We start with b_i = 0.\n   Then for j = i-1: we require b_{i-1} < 0.\n   We choose the multiple x (which will be negative) such that b_{i-1} = x * a_{i-1] is as close to 0 as possible (but below) to leave room for the elements further to the left. But the code does:\n\n        x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n\n   Here, prev is initially 0 (for the element at i). Then for j=i-1: \n        x = ceil((0+1)/a[i-1]) = ceil(1/a[i-1])\n\n   But if a[i-1] is 2, then ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1. Then it sets prev = a[i-1]*x = 2*1=2. \n\n   Then for the next left (j=i-2), we require b_{i-2} < b_{i-1}=2. So we require b_{i-2} <= 1.\n\n   Then x = ceil((2+1)/a[i-2]) = ceil(3/a[i-2]). If a[i-2]=1, then ceil(3/1)=3.\n\n   Then b_{i-2}=1*3=3.\n\n   Then the sequence from left to right: b_{i-2}=3, b_{i-1}=2, b_i=0 -> but 3>2, which is not increasing to the right? \n\n   We are building from right to left: the array should be ... , b_{i-2}, b_{i-1}, b_i. And we require b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} < b_i. But 3<2 is false.\n\n   So the code must be building the left part in reverse order? \n\n   The left part: j goes from i-1 down to 0. For each j, we are setting b_j to a value that is less than the next (which is at j+1, which we have just set). \n\n   But the calculation: \n        x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n\n   This is for the condition: b_j < b_{j+1} = prev.\n\n   We require b_j <= prev - 1.\n\n   Then the largest possible value for b_j that is <= prev-1 and is a multiple of a_j is: floor((prev-1)/a_j) * a_j. But the code does ceil((prev+1)/a_j) and then multiplies by a_j? \n\n   Let me see: ceil((prev+1)/a_j) is the smallest integer x such that x >= (prev+1)/a_j.\n\n   Then a_j * x >= prev+1.\n\n   But we require b_j < prev, so we want a_j * x < prev? \n\n   This seems backwards.\n\n   Actually, the code in the left part is for the negative multiples? \n\n   Let me try with a negative example: \n\n   We require b_j < prev. We want to choose a multiple x (which can be negative) of a_j for b_j. We want to minimize |x|, and also we want b_j to be as large as possible (but still < prev) to leave room for the next left element.\n\n   The largest multiple of a_j that is < prev is: \n        floor((prev-1)/a_j) * a_j   [if we are considering integer multiples]? \n\n   But then the number of moves would be |x|, where x = floor((prev-1)/a_j) / a_j? \n\n   But note: if we let x be the integer such that b_j = x * a_j, then we require x * a_j < prev.\n\n   The largest x that satisfies this is: x = floor((prev-1)/a_j)  [if we are in positive?] but if prev is positive.\n\n   But if we choose the largest possible b_j (which is floor((prev-1)/a_j) * a_j), then the number of moves is |x| = |floor((prev-1)/a_j)|. However, this might not be the minimal in terms of absolute value? \n\n   For example, if a_j=2, prev=0, then we require b_j < 0. The largest b_j is -2? (if we use x=-1) -> then moves=1. But floor((0-1)/2)=floor(-1/2)=-1, so x=-1, and moves=1.\n\n   If we use x=-2, then b_j=-4, which is also <0, but moves=2, which is more.\n\n   So we want the largest value (closest to prev from below) to minimize the moves for the subsequent left elements? \n\n   The code does:\n\n        x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n\n   Let me try with a_j=2, prev=0:\n        x = ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1.\n   Then b_j = 1*2 = 2, which is not <0. \n\n   This is not what we want.\n\n   Alternatively, if we use negative x: \n\n   We require: x * a_j < 0 -> x<0.\n\n   The formula ceil((prev+1)/a_j) for prev=0 and a_j=2: ceil(1/2)=1, which is positive.\n\n   So it seems the code is not handling negative multiples.\n\n   But the example uses negative values.\n\n   Let me read the code again: the left part is from j=i-1 down to 0, and it sets:\n\n        x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n        temp += x\n        prev = a[j] * x\n\n   This seems to be for positive multiples? \n\n   But then for the left part, we want b_j < b_{j+1}=0, so we need a negative value. \n\n   The code must be intended to use negative moves? but then x would be negative.\n\n   How to ceil for negative? \n\n   Alternatively, the code might be using a different approach: \n\n   We can also subtract. So the move count is the absolute value of x. But the code does temp+=x, which for x negative would reduce the count? \n\n   But then it wouldn't make sense.\n\n   I see the example in the code: \n        Example 1: n=5, a = [1,2,1,1,1]. \n        The solution is 4 moves.\n\n   In the code, they iterate i from 0 to n-1.\n\n   Let's try i=2 (0-indexed) -> the third element.\n\n   Then the left part: j=1,0.\n\n   For j=1: \n        prev = 0 (initially for i=2)\n        x = ceil((0+1)/a[1]) = ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1.\n        temp += 1 -> 1.\n        prev = a[1]*1 = 2.\n\n   Then j=0:\n        x = ceil((2+1)/a[0]) = ceil(3/1)=3.\n        temp += 3 -> 4.\n        prev = 1*3 = 3.\n\n   Then the right part: j=3,4.\n\n   For the right part, we require b3 > b2=0, and b4 > b3.\n\n   How to do the right part? \n\n   We start with b2=0.\n   For j=3: we require b3 > 0. The smallest multiple of a[3]=1 that is >0 is 1. So we would do x=1 (1 move), then b3=1.\n   Then for j=4: we require b4>1. The smallest multiple of a[4]=1 that is >1 is 2. So x=2 (2 moves) -> total moves for right = 1+2=3.\n\n   Total moves = 4 (left) + 3 (right) = 7.\n\n   But the example says 4 moves.\n\n   Alternatively, for the right part, we might do differently: \n\n   We want to minimize the moves, and also leave room for further elements? \n\n   In the left part, the code used the ceiling function to determine the smallest integer x such that a_j*x >= prev+1, and then used that as the value for b_j? but that would be greater than prev, which is not what we want for the left part (where we require b_j < next).\n\n   This suggests the code for the left part is actually for the right part? \n\n   Let me swap: \n\n   In the provided code, the left part (j from i-1 down to 0) is using a formula that sets b_j to a value that is at least prev+1? but then we require b_j < b_{j+1} = prev? \n\n   This is not compatible.\n\n   I see the note in the code: the example subtracts a1 and then adds a3, a4, a5. In their solution, they set b2=0 (the third element, index2) and then for the left part, they have a0 and a1.\n\n   They set b0 = -1 (by x=-1 for a0=1: moves=1) and b1=0? but then b1=0 is not < b2=0? it should be strictly increasing. \n\n   So they must have set b1 to a value <0. \n\n   How about: \n        b0 = -1 (1 move: subtract once)\n        b1 = -2? (1 move: because a1=2, so we can set to -2 by subtracting once: 1 move) -> then b1=-2 < b0=-1? -> no, -2<-1 is true, but then the sequence is b0=-1, b1=-2 -> which is not increasing.\n\n   So they must have set b0=-1 and b1=0? but then b1=0 and b2=0 -> not strictly increasing.\n\n   How do they get b1=0? initially 0, and they do nothing? then b1=0. Then b0=-1 (which is <0) and b1=0, b2=0 -> then b1 and b2 are not strictly increasing.\n\n   The example says the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\n   So b0=-1, b1=0, b2=3, b3=4, b4=5.\n\n   How many moves for each index?\n        b0: -1 -> 1 move (subtract once)\n        b1: 0 -> 0 moves\n        b2: 3 -> 3 moves (add three times)\n        b3: 4 -> 4 moves (add four times)\n        b4: 5 -> 5 moves (add five times)\n   Total: 1+0+3+4+5 = 13.\n\n   But the example says 4 moves.\n\n   Unless they are not setting each index independently? \n\n   The moves: \n        move1: subtract a0 -> b0 becomes -1.\n        move2: add a2 -> b2 becomes 1.\n        move3: add a3 -> b3 becomes 1.\n        move4: add a4 -> b4 becomes 1.\n\n   Then the array: \n        b0=-1, b1=0, b2=1, b3=1, b4=1 -> not increasing.\n\n   To get b2=3, they would need to add a2 three times: three moves. Similarly, b3=4: four moves, b4=5: five moves. \n\n   So total moves: 1 (for b0) + 3 (for b2) + 4 (for b3) + 5 ( for b4) = 13.\n\n   This is not 4.\n\n   I see the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\". \n   In 0-indexed: a3, a4, a5 are the fourth, fifth, sixth? but we only have five elements.\n\n   The array a: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. \n   In 0-indexed: a0=1, a1=2, a2=1, a3=1, a4=1.\n\n   So a3 in 1-indexed is the fourth element, which is a3 in 0-indexed index3.\n\n   So they are only doing one move on a2 ( which is index2) ? not mentioned? \n\n   The example says: \"subtract a1 from b1\", then \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\". \n   In 1-indexed: \n        b1: subtract a1 -> b1 becomes -2? but the example says the array has b1=0. \n\n   Unless \"b1\" in 1-indexed is the first element? \n\n   The problem says: choose an integer i (1<=i<=n) and add or subtract a_i to b_i.\n\n   So in 1-indexed:\n        b1: subtract a1 ( which is the first element of a, value 1) -> b1 becomes -1.\n        b2: not mentioned -> remains 0.\n        b3: add a3 ( which is the third element of a, value 1) -> b3 becomes 1.\n        b4: add a4 (1) -> b4 becomes 1.\n        b5: add a5 (1) -> b5 becomes 1.\n\n   Then the array: [-1,0,1,1,1] -> not strictly increasing.\n\n   The example says the array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\n   To achieve that, they must have done:\n        b1: -1 (1 move)\n        b3: 3 (3 moves: add three times)\n        b4: 4 (4 moves)\n        b5: 5 (5 moves)\n   Total moves = 1+3+4+5 = 13.\n\n   This is not 4.\n\n   I see the example output says: \" the final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\"\n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   Unless the moves can be applied to the same index multiple times and they are counted as one move per index touch? \n\n   The problem says: \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\n   So one move: one index chosen and one operation (add or subtract) on that index.\n\n   To get b5=5, if a5=1, we must do 5 moves on index5.\n\n   So 5 moves for index5 alone.\n\n   Then the example's 4 moves is not enough.\n\n   I think there is a mistake in the example.\n\n   Let me look at the note: \"Example 1: you can subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively. The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\"\n\n   This is 4 moves: one move on a1, one move on a3, one move on a4, one move on a5. \n\n   Then the array: \n        b1 = 0 - a1 = -1.\n        b3 = 0 + a3 = 1.\n        b4 = 0 + a4 = 1.\n        b5 = 0 + a5 = 1.\n\n   not [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5].\n\n   To get b3=3, they would need to do three moves on a3: three times. \n\n   So the example's explanation is flawed.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since the code for program1.py is provided with a TODO only in the right part, and the left part is implemented, I will assume that the right part is symmetric to the left part.\n\n   In the left part, we had:\n\n        while j>=0:\n            x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n            temp += x\n            prev = a[j] * x\n            j-=1\n\n   For the right part, we require: b_{k} > b_{k-1} = prev.\n\n   So we require b_k >= prev+1.\n\n   The smallest multiple of a[k] that is >= prev+1 is: ceil((prev+1)/a[k]) * a[k].\n\n   Then the number of moves is x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k]).\n\n   Then we set prev = a[k] * x, for the next element.\n\n   So the right part would be:\n\n        while k<len(a):\n            x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n            temp += x\n            prev = a[k] * x\n            k+=1\n\n   But note: in the left part, we are moving from i-1 down to 0, and in the right part from i+1 to len(a)-1.\n\n   Let me test with the example that they provided in the code: n=5, a=[1,2,1,1,1], and i=2 (0-indexed).\n\n   We fixed b2=0.\n\n   Left part (j=1,0):\n        j=1: \n            prev = 0\n            x = ceil((0+1)/2) = ceil(0.5)=1.\n            temp += 1 -> 1.\n            prev = 2*1 = 2.\n        j=0:\n            x = ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3.\n            temp += 3 -> 4.\n            prev = 1*3 = 3.\n\n   Right part (k=3,4):\n        k=3:\n            prev = 0 (from the fixed element i=2) -> wait, should we start the right part with the fixed element as the previous? \n\n   But note: the right part starts at k=i+1, and the first element to the right should be > b_i=0.\n\n   So for k=3:\n        x = ceil((0+1)/a[3]) = ceil(1/1)=1.\n        temp += 1 -> now temp=5.\n        prev = 1*1 = 1.\n   k=4:\n        x = ceil((1+1)/a[4]) = ceil(2/1)=2.\n        temp += 2 -> 7.\n        prev = 1*2 = 2.\n\n   Total moves=7.\n\n   But the example says the minimum is 4.\n\n   What if we choose i=0? \n   Then left part: j from -1 to 0: no left part.\n   Right part: k=1,2,3,4.\n        Start with b0=0.\n        k=1: require >0, a[1]=2: x = ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> moves=1, b1=2.\n        k=2: require >2, a[2]=1: x=ceil((2+1)/1)=3 -> moves=3, b2=3.\n        k=3: require >3, a[3]=1: x=ceil((3+1)/1)=4 -> moves=4, b3=4.\n        k=4: require >4, a[4]=1: x=5 -> moves=5.\n        Total=1+3+4+5=13.\n\n   i=1:\n        left part: j=0: \n             prev=0 ( for b1=0)\n             x=ceil((0+1)/a[0])=ceil(1/1)=1 -> moves=1, b0=1.\n        right part: k=2,3,4:\n             start with b1=0.\n             k=2: x=ceil((0+1)/1)=1 -> moves=1, b2=1.\n             k=3: x=ceil((1+1)/1)=2 -> moves=2, b3=2.\n             k=4: x=ceil((2+1)/1)=3 -> moves=3.\n             total=1 (left) + 1+2+3 = 7.\n\n   i=3:\n        left part: j=2,1,0 -> \n             start with b3=0.\n             j=2: x=ceil((0+1)/1)=1 -> moves=1, b2=1.\n             j=1: x=ceil((1+1)/2)=ceil(2/2)=1 -> moves=1, b1=2.\n             j=0: x=ceil((2+1)/1)=3 -> moves=3, b0=3.\n             total left=1+1+3=5.\n        right part: k=4:\n             x=ceil((0+1)/1)=1 -> moves=1.\n             total=5+1=6.\n\n   i=4:\n        left part: j=3,2,1,0 -> \n             start with b4=0.\n             j=3: ceil(1/1)=1 -> moves=1, b3=1.\n             j=2: ceil((1+1)/1)=2 -> moves=2, b2=2.\n             j=1: ceil((2+1)/2)=ceil(3/2)=2 -> moves=2, b1=4.\n             j=0: ceil((4+1)/1)=5 -> moves=5.\n             total=1+2+2+5=10.\n\n   The minimum over i is min(13,7,6,10, for i=0,1,2,3,4) -> 6.\n\n   But the example says 4.\n\n   What if we try i=2 with a different approach for the right part? \n\n   The right part: we require b3>0 and b4> b3.\n\n   We can set b3=1 (1 move) and then b4=2 (1 move: because we can add once to get 1, but then we require >1, so we add twice? then b4=2, moves=2) -> total moves for right=1+2=3.\n\n   Then total moves=4 (left) +3=7.\n\n   Or set b3=1 and b4=1 -> not increasing.\n\n   or set b3=1 and b4=2 -> then moves for b4=2 ( because a4=1, so two moves) -> 1+2=3.\n\n   still 7.\n\n   Alternatively, the right part might be done in a way that we use the largest possible value for the first right element to minimize the moves for the subsequent ones? \n\n   But the minimal moves for an element is the smallest absolute value of the multiple that satisfies the condition. For the first right element, the smallest move count to get >0 is 1 ( by setting to 1 or -1? but -1 is <0, so not >0) -> so 1.\n\n   then for the next, we require >1, so the smallest move count is 2 ( to get 2).\n\n   So 3 moves.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   So the provided algorithm might not be optimal.\n\n   I found a known solution for this problem ( making a sequence increasing by asignaing multiples of a_i) uses dynamic programming: \n        dp[i][j] = minimum moves for the prefix ending at i if we assign the j-th possible value to the i-th element.\n\n   But j can be up to 5000 because the value can be any integer, but we only care about the relative values.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a greedy / two-pointers method.\n\n   However, the provided code structure is as given.\n\n   After checking online, I found that a common solution is to try every possible starting point ( which the code does) and then for the left part and right part, we simulate as:\n\n   For the left part: \n        current = 0\n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            # We need b[j] < b[j+1]\n            # Let moves_needed = ceil((current + 1) / a[j])   [wait, not exactly]\n\n   But in a known solution in C++ for the same problem ( from a codeforces submission ):\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            long long now = 0;\n            long long tot = 0;\n            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {\n                long long need = now / a[j] + 1;\n                tot += need;\n                now = 1LL * need * a[j];\n            }\n            now = 0;\n            for (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n                long long need = now / a[j] + 1;\n                tot += need;\n                now = 1LL * need * a[j];\n            }\n            ans = min(ans, tot);\n        }\n\n   But wait, this is for the right part: \n        now = 0\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            need = now / a[j] + 1   -> integer division? \n\n   Let me try with a[j]=2, now=0: need = 0/2+1 = 1.\n   then now = 1*2 = 2.\n\n   then next, if a[j]=1, now=2: need = 2/1+1 = 2+1=3.\n   then now=3.\n\n   This is for the condition: b[j] > b[j-1] ( which is now initially for the first j after i: b[i]=0, so we require b[i+1]>0).\n\n   need = ceil((now+1)/a[j])? \n\n   now=0, a[j]=2: ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> matches.\n   now=2, a[j]=1: ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3 -> matches.\n\n   But the formula in the code: need = now / a[j] + 1.\n\n   This works for nonnegative 'now' and positive a[j] if we use integer floor division? \n\n   floor(0/2)=0, then +1=1.\n   floor(2/1)=2, then+1=3.\n\n   But what if now=1, a[j]=2: \n        floor(1/2)=0, need=1.\n        ceil((1+1)/2)=ceil(2/2)=1 -> matches.\n\n   now=3, a[j]=2: floor(3/2)=1, need=2.\n        ceil((3+1)/2)=ceil(4/2)=2 -> matches.\n\n   now= -1, a[j]=2: floor(-1/2) in Python is -1, then need = -1+1=0.\n        but we require b[j] > b[j-1] = -1. The smallest multiple of 2 that > -1 is 0? -> then need = 0? but 0 is not > -1? it is greater, but the condition is >, so 0>-1 is true. And 0 is a multiple of 2 (0*2=0). Moves=0.\n\n   ceil(( -1+1)/2)=ceil(0/2)=ceil(0)=0.\n\n   So the formula: need = floor(now / a[j]) + 1   if now>=0 floor division is truncation towards -infinity? \n\n   In Python, for nonnegative now, floor division is truncation towards floor, but for negative, it is floor.\n\n   However, in the left part, now might be negative.\n\n   Let me try now=-1, a[j]=2 in the formula: floor(-1/2) in Python is -1 ( because -1//2 = -1 in Python), then need = -1+1=0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   now=-2, a[j]=2: floor(-2//2)=-1, need=-1+1=0. \n        but we require > -2. 0>-2, and 0 is a multiple of 2, and moves=0.\n\n   now=-3, a[j]=2: floor(-3//2) = -2 ( because -3//2 = -2 in Python), need = -2+1 = -1.\n\n   This is negative, which is not allowed.\n\n   What should we do for now=-3, a[j]=2? \n        We require b[j] > now = -3.\n        multiples: ... -4, -2, 0, 2, ...\n        the smallest multiple > -3 is -2.\n        how many moves: we are at 0, and we want -2: we can subtract once: move count=1 (absolute value of the multiple is 1, because -2 = -1 * 2).\n\n        need = ceil((-3+1)/2)=ceil(-2/2)=ceil(-1)=-1.\n\n   But then need is negative.\n\n   The formula need = floor(now / a[j]) + 1 for now=-3, a[j]=2: floor(-3/2)=-2, then -2+1=-1.\n\n   Then we would do: \n        tot += -1  -> which would reduce the count, but moves cannot be negative.\n\n   So the known solution in C++ might use unsigned, but then it would be wrong.\n\n   Alternatively, the known solution might be for a different but similar problem.\n\n   I found a known solution for this problem ( from a trusted source ) in C++:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nconst int maxn = 5003;\nint n, a[maxn];\n\nint main() {\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

The array will be [\u22121,0,0,0,0] which is not increasing. So we also change a3 to 1, a4 to 2, and a5 to 3. The array will be [\u22121,0,0,1,2,3] (wait, they have 6 elements?) \n\n        The sample has n=5.\n\n        I see the contest problem: \n            \"In one move, you can choose any integer and add it to any one of the elements of the array. This move costs the chosen integer ( if you add x, then it costs |x|).\"\n\n        This is different from our problem.\n\n        In our problem, the move is restricted to adding or subtracting a_i to b_i, and the cost is 1 per move, regardless of the magnitude.\n\n        So the problems are different.\n\n Given the time, and since the code for program1.py has a TODO only for the right part, and the left part is implemented, and the right part is symmetric, I will complete the right part as the symmetric of the left part.\n\n   In the left part: \n        while j>=0:\n            x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n            temp += x\n            prev = a[j] * x\n            j -= 1\n\n   For the right part: \n        while k<len(a):\n            x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n            temp += x\n            prev = a[k] * x\n            k += 1\n\n   Then we hope that the sample might work with i=2: \n        left part: as before, temp=4.\n        right part: \n            k=3: \n                 prev=0 ( from the fixed element at i=2)\n                 x = ceil((0+1)/a[3]) = ceil(1/1)=1.\n                 temp=4+1=5.\n                 prev=1.\n            k=4:\n                 x = ceil((1+1)/a[4]) = ceil(2/1)=2.\n                 temp=5+2=7.\n        total=7.\n\n   But the minimum over i might be found at i=3 with 6.\n\n   Since the online judge will test, and the known solution for the same problem in other languages uses the floor division method, and the provided code in program1.py uses ceil, I will output the floor division method for the right part as in the known solution.\n\n   But the left part uses ceil, and the right part should be floor? \n\n   In the left part, we have: \n        x = ceil((prev+1)/a[j])\n\n   For the right part, if we use the floor division method, it is: \n        need = prev / a[k] + 1   [using integer floor division]\n\n   But in Python, for negative prev, floor division is floor, and for positive, it is floor.\n\n   However, the left part in the provided code uses ceil, which for positive numbers is different from floor.\n\n   For example, prev=0, a[j]=2: \n        ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1.\n        floor(0/2)+1 = 0+1=1.\n\n   So in this case, the same.\n\n   prev=2, a[j]=1: \n        ceil((2+1)/1)=3.\n        floor(2/1)+1=2+1=3.\n\n   prev=1, a[j]=2: \n        ceil((1+1)/2)=ceil(2/2)=1.\n        floor(1/2)+1=0+1=1.\n\n   prev=3, a[j]=2: \n        ceil((3+1)/2)=ceil(4/2)=2.\n        floor(3/2)+1=1+1=2.\n\n   prev=-1, a[j]=2: \n        ceil((-1+1)/2)=ceil(0)=0.\n        floor(-1/2)+1 = -1+1=0.\n\n   prev=-3, a[j]=2: \n        ceil((-3+1)/2)=ceil(-2/2)=ceil(-1)=-1.\n        floor(-3/2)+1 = -2+1 = -1.\n\n   So the floor division method and the ceil method are the same in these examples.\n\n   But note: in Python, for negative division, floor division is floor, and ceil from math.ceil is ceiling.\n\n   However, ceil for negative: ceil(-1.5) = -1, and floor(-1.5) = -2.\n\n   In our formula: ceil((prev+1)/a[k]) might be different from floor(prev/a[k])+1 when (prev+1) is not an integer and negative.\n\n   Example: prev = -2, a[k]=2: \n        ceil((-2+1)/2)=ceil(-1/2)=ceil(-0.5)=0.\n        floor(-2/2)+1 = floor(-1)+1 = -1+1=0.\n\n   Example: prev = -3, a[k]=2: \n        ceil((-3+1)/2)=ceil(-2/2)=ceil(-1)=-1.\n        floor(-3/2)+1 = floor(-1.5) = -2, then -2+1=-1.\n\n   So they are the same.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the floor division method for both.\n\n   But the left part is already implemented with ceil. We can change it to floor division, but the TODO is only for the right part.\n\n   So for the right part, we can do:\n\n        while k<len(a):\n            x = (prev // a[k]) + 1\n            temp += x\n            prev = x * a[k]\n            k += 1\n\n   But note: in Python, for nonnegative prev, // is floor division, for negative, it is floor (toward -infinity).\n\n   This matches the ceil method for the left part.\n\n   However, the left part is implemented with ceil. We must be consistent.\n\n   Since the left part is given and we are to complete the right part, and the right part is symmetric, and the formula using floor division is shorter, and we have shown equivalence, I will use the floor division method for the right part.\n\n   So for program1.py, the missing code for the right part is:\n\n        while k<len(a):\n            x = (prev // a[k]) + 1\n            temp += x\n            prev = x * a[k]\n            k += 1\n\n   But note: the left part uses 'prev' from the fixed element (0) and then for the left part, it might become negative? \n\n   In the right part, we start with prev=0, and then we do for k in range(i+1, n).\n\n   This should work.\n\n   Let me test with the sample: n=5, a=[1,2,1,1,1], i=2 (0-indexed), right part:\n        k=3: \n            prev=0\n            x = (0 // a[3]) + 1 = (0//1)+1 = 0+1=1.\n            temp=0+1=1.\n            prev=1*1=1.\n        k=4:\n            x = (1//1)+1 = 1+1=2.\n            temp=1+2=3.\n            prev=2*1=2.\n\n   then the left part for i=2: \n        j=1: \n            prev=0 ( initially for the fixed element)\n            x = ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1.\n            temp=0+1=1.\n            prev=2.\n        j=0:\n            x=ceil((2+1)/1)=3.\n            temp=1+3=4.\n        total = 4 (left) + 3 (right) = 7.\n\n   But we know the minimum is 6 (at i=3).\n\n   So the code will try i=3 and get 6, which is the minimum.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program1.py's right part is:\n\n        while k<len(a):\n            x = (prev // a[k]) + 1\n            temp += x\n            prev = x * a[k]\n            k += 1\n\n   For program2.py:\n\n   The provided code has:\n\n        if b == 1 or a == b:\n            print('YES')\n        else:\n            for i in range(1, a):\n                if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                    w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                    if s == w:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    break\n\n   The condition at the beginning: if the string has only one distinct letter (b==1) or if the string has all distinct letters (a==b), then it is balanced? \n        - If one distinct letter: then in any substring, the frequency of that letter is the length, and for any two letters (only one letter) the difference is 0. So YES.\n        - If all distinct: then in any substring, the frequency of any letter is either 0 or 1. For two letters u and v, if both appear in the substring, then both are 1, difference 0. If one appears and the other doesn't, then one is 1 and the other 0, difference 1. So YES.\n\n   Otherwise, we enter a loop for i from 1 to a-1.\n\n   If s[i] is in the prefix s[:i], then we do:\n        w = (s[:i] * a)[:a]   -> this repeats the prefix of length i enough times to have at least a (which is the length of s) characters, and then takes the first a characters.\n\n        if s == w, then print \"YES\", else ... TODO.\n\n   For example, s=\"aba\", a=3, i=1: \n        s[1]='b' -> not in s[:1]=\"a\", so skip.\n        i=2: s[2]='a' is in s[:2]=\"ab\" -> then w = (s[:2]=\"ab\" repeated a=3 times: \"ababab\", then [:3]=\"aba\") -> s=\"aba\"==w, so print \"YES\".\n\n   For s=\"abc\", a=3, i=1: 'b' not in \"a\", skip.\n        i=2: 'c' not in \"ab\", skip. -> then the loop ends without break, and the code does nothing? \n\n   But the condition outside the loop is not handled. The code will not print anything for \"abc\", but it should print \"YES\".\n\n   So the code has a flaw.\n\n   The known solution for the perfectly balanced string is to check that the string is of the form (a finite string repeated) and the finite string contains all the distinct letters.\n\n   But also, the editorial of the contest where this problem appeared ( if any) might have a different solution.\n\n   However, the sample: \n        s=\"aba\": \n            distinct letters: 'a','b' -> not all distinct, and not single letter.\n            then i=0: not in the loop (i from 1 to a-1=2) -> i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> no.\n            i=2: 'a' in \"ab\" -> yes.\n            then w = (\"ab\" repeated enough to make 3 letters) = \"aba\" -> matches, so YES.\n\n        s=\"abc\": \n            distinct letters: 3, and a=3, so a==b -> YES.\n\n        s=\"abb\": \n            distinct letters: 'a','b' -> not all distinct, not single.\n            i=1: s[1]='b' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> no.\n            i=2: s[2]='b' in s[:2]=\"ab\" -> yes.\n            then w = (s[:2]=\"ab\" repeated to 3 letters) = \"aba\" ( because \"ab\"*3 = \"ababab\", then [:3]=\"aba\") -> s=\"abb\" != \"aba\", so we go to the else branch.\n\n            In the else branch, we must print \"NO\", and break.\n\n   So for \"abb\", it will print \"NO\".\n\n   But are there other possibilities? \n\n   The condition in the for loop breaks at the first i for which s[i] is in s[:i]. \n\n   For example, s=\"aab\", distinct=2, a=3.\n        i=1: s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> yes.\n        w = (s[:1]=\"a\" repeated 3 times) = \"a\"*3 = \"aaa\", and s=\"aab\" != \"aaa\", so we go to the else branch.\n\n   But is \"aab\" perfectly balanced? \n        Consider the substring \"aa\": \n            frequency of 'a'=2, frequency of 'b'=0 -> difference=2>1 -> not balanced.\n\n   So it should be \"NO\", which matches.\n\n   But consider s=\"aabc\", distinct=3, a=4, so a!=b (b=3) -> not in the initial condition.\n        i=1: 'a' in \"a\" -> true.\n        w = (s[:1]=\"a\" repeated 4 times)=\"aaaa\", s=\"aabc\"!=\"aaaa\", so we go to else.\n\n   But is \"aabc\" balanced? \n        substring \"aa\": 'a':2, 'b':0, 'c':0 -> difference between 'a' and 'b' is 2>1 -> not balanced.\n\n   So we should print \"NO\".\n\n   However, consider s=\"abac\", distinct=3, a=4.\n        i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> false.\n        i=2: 'a' in \"ab\" -> true.\n        w = (s[:2]=\"ab\" repeated 4 times) = \"abab\", then take 4: \"abab\", s=\"abac\"!=\"abab\", so else branch -> \"NO\".\n\n   But is \"abac\" balanced? \n        substring \"aba\": \n            a:2, b:1 -> difference between a and b is 1, which is allowed.\n            a:2, c:0 -> difference 2>1 -> not allowed.\n\n   So it should be \"NO\", which matches.\n\n   But consider a string that is not of the form (a prefix repeated) but is balanced? \n\n   The note says: \"abc\" is balanced, but in the code, we have a==b (3==3) -> so we print \"YES\".\n\n   What about \"aabb\", distinct=2, a=4.\n        not in the initial condition.\n        i=1: 'a' in \"a\" -> true.\n        w = \"a\"*4=\"aaaa\" != \"aabb\" -> else branch: print \"NO\", and break.\n\n   But is \"aabb\" balanced? \n        substring \"aa\": 'a':2, 'b':0 -> difference 2>1 -> not balanced.\n\n   So \"NO\" is correct.\n\n   What about \"abab\", distinct=2, a=4.\n        i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> false.\n        i=2: 'a' in \"ab\" -> true.\n        w = (s[:2]=\"ab\" repeated 4 times) = \"ababab\"[:4]=\"abab\", matches s, so print \"YES\".\n\n   And \"abab\" is balanced? \n        The distinct letters: 'a','b'\n        substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> difference 1.\n        substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> 0.\n        substring \"a\": a:1, b:0 -> difference 1.\n        substring \"b\": a:0, b:1 -> difference 1.\n        substring \"ba\": a:1, b:1 ->0.\n        substring \"bab\": a:1, b:2 -> difference 1.\n        substring \"abab\": a:2, b:2 ->0.\n        So YES.\n\n   Therefore, the code seems to be: \n        if the string is not of the form (prefix repeated) and not single letter and not all distinct, then it is not balanced.\n\n   But is that always true? \n\n   The known solution in a contest for the same problem is to check that the string is of the form (minimal period string) and the minimal period is the distinct set.\n\n   However, the code in the else branch of the TODO: we must print \"NO\" and break.\n\n   But the code currently in the else branch is not written.\n\n   So for the else branch, we should print \"NO\" and break.\n\n   But note: the for loop breaks after the first i for which s[i] in s[:i] and then if it doesn't match the full string, we print \"NO\". \n\n   What if there is a later i that might yield a match? \n\n   The problem: if for the first i (>=1) such that s[i] is in s[:i], and then if the string is not equal to the repeated prefix, we break and print \"NO\". \n\n   But consider: s=\"abac\", distinct=3, a=4.\n        i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> no.\n        i=2: 'a' in \"ab\" -> yes, then build w=\"abab\", which is not equal to \"abac\", so we print \"NO\".\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Consider a string that might have two candidates: \n        s=\"abcab\", distinct=3, a=5.\n        i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> no.\n        i=2: 'c' in \"ab\" -> no.\n        i=3: 'a' in \"abc\" -> yes.\n        w = (s[:3]=\"abc\" repeated to 5) = \"abcabc\"[:5]=\"abcab\", matches s.\n        so print \"YES\".\n\n   But consider s=\"abcabcd\", distinct=4, a=7.\n        i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> no.\n        i=2: 'c' in \"ab\" -> no.\n        i=3: 'a' in \"abc\" -> yes.\n        w = \"abc\" repeated: \"abcabcabc\"[:7]=\"abcabca\", which is not \"abcabcd\", so we would print \"NO\".\n\n   But is \"abcabcd\" perfectly balanced? \n        Consider the substring \"abcd\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> balanced.\n        Consider the substring \"abcabc\": \n            a:2, b:2, c:2 -> balanced.\n        Consider the substring \"abcabcd\": \n            a:2, b:2, c:2, d:1 -> difference between a and d is 1, between b and d is 1, between c and d is 1.\n        But consider the substring \"cabc\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:2 -> difference between a and c is 1, between b and c is 1.\n        However, consider the substring \"abcd\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> balanced.\n\n        But wait, the condition is for every substring and for every two letters in the entire string (not necessarily in the substring) the difference in the substring is at most 1.\n\n        In the substring \"c\", the frequency of 'c' is 1, and the frequency of 'd' is 0, so |1-0|=1, which is allowed.\n\n        In the substring \"abcabcd\", the frequency of 'a'=2, 'd'=1, difference=1.\n\n        But consider the substring \"d\": \n            frequency of 'd'=1, and frequency of 'a'=0, difference=1.\n\n        It might be balanced.\n\n        However, the problem says: for every substring and for every two letters (that appear in the entire string) the condition must hold.\n\n        In the substring \"d\", the letters that appear in the entire string are 'a','b','c','d'. In the substring \"d\", the frequency of 'd' is 1, and of 'a' is 0, and |1-0|=1, which is allowed.\n\n        But consider a substring that is \"ab\", then in this substring, the frequency of 'a'=1, 'b'=1, 'c'=0, 'd'=0. The difference between 'a' and 'c' is 1, between 'a' and 'd' is 1, between 'b' and 'c' is 1, between 'b' and 'd' is 1.\n\n        So it might be balanced.\n\n        However, the known solution in the problem's note says that \"abc\" is balanced, but \"abb\" is not.\n\n        How do we know about \"abcabcd\"?\n\n        Let me check a substring that might be problematic: \"ca\" -> \n            'c':1, 'a':1, 'b':0, 'd':0 -> differences: between 'c' and 'b' is 1, between 'c' and 'd' is 1, between 'a' and 'b' is 1, etc.\n\n        Consider a substring that is \"bcabcd\" (length=6): \n            a:1, b:2, c:2, d:1.\n            difference between b and a: 2-1=1, between b and d: 2-1=1, between c and a: 2-1=1, between c and d: 2-1=1.\n\n        Consider a substring that is \"cabc\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:2, d:0.\n            difference between c and a: 1, between c and b: 1, between c and d: 2 (because 2-0=2) -> which is >1.\n\n        Therefore, the substring \"cabc\" is not balanced: for the triplet (t=\"cabc\", u='c', v='d'), the frequency of 'c' is 2 and of 'd' is 0, and |2-0|=2>1.\n\n        So \"abcabcd\" is not balanced.\n\n        Therefore, the code should print \"NO\", which it does.\n\n   So the else branch should be: \n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\n   But note: the break is already there (outside the if-else, but inside the for loop and the if s[i] in s[:i]). \n\n   The structure:\n\n        for i in range(1, a):\n            if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                if s == w:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                break\n\n   So after the else, we break.\n\n   Therefore, in the else branch, we print \"NO\" and then break (the break is already there).\n\n   So the TODO is: \n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   But what if the for loop doesn't break? that is, if for no i in [1, a-1] is s[i] in s[:i], then we don't break and the loop ends. Then we should print \"YES\" or \"NO\"?\n\n   Example: s=\"abc\", then the condition s[i] in s[:i] is never true, so the loop does nothing. Then the code currently does not print anything.\n\n   But \"abc\" should be \"YES\", because a==b (3==3) -> wait, the initial condition: \n        a = len(s)=3, b=len(set(s))=3, so a==b -> we print \"YES\" at the beginning.\n\n   So the for loop is not entered.\n\n   Another example: s=\"abcdef\", distinct=6, a=6 -> a==b -> print \"YES\".\n\n   What about a string that is not of the form (prefix repeated) and not single letter and not all distinct, and also for every i, s[i] is not in s[:i]? \n\n   This means that the string has distinct letters in the prefix of length i for every i? \n\n   But then the entire string would have distinct letters, which is caught by a==b.\n\n   So the for loop is only entered for strings that are not of the form (single letter or all distinct) and that have a repeated letter at position i (which means not all distinct in the prefix of length i+1).\n\n   Therefore, the else branch is simply: print(\"NO\")\n\n   So for program2.py, the missing code is: \n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: the break is after the if-else, so we break out of the for loop.\n\n   Therefore, the completed code for program2.py in the else branch is: \n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, to be safe, we can break after printing, but the break is already there.\n\n   Let me write the structure:\n\n        for i in range(1, a):\n            if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                if s == w:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                break\n\n   And if we break, we are done for that test case.\n\n   If we don't break, then after the for loop, there is no code, so we have already printed nothing? \n\n   But the initial condition caught the single letter and all distinct.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: the problem says the string might be up to 200000, and the for loop might break early.\n\n   Summary:\n\n   For program1.py, the missing code for the right part is:\n\n        while k<len(a):\n            x = (prev // a[k]) + 1\n            temp += x\n            prev = x * a[k]\n            k += 1\n\n   For program2.py, the missing code in the else branch is:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, in the right part of program1.py, we must be cautious: the variable 'prev' for the right part is initially 0, and then we update it.\n\n   And in the left part, the variable 'prev' is also initially 0.\n\n   But in the provided code for the left part, they have:\n\n        j=i-1\n        prev = 0   [for the left part]\n\n   and for the right part, they have:\n\n        k=i+1\n        prev=0   [for the right part]\n\n   then the while loop for the right part.\n\n   So the code for program1.py's right part is as above.\n\n   Let's output in the required JSON format."
