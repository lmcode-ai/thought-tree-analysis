We start with two empty sums (a for Alice, b for Bob) and we have a variable `cur` that counts the total number of candies eaten so far.\n\n The current code does:\n   if a >= b: then Bob (from the right) eats one candy (so we pop from the right and add to b)\n   else: then we should have Alice eat from the left? But note the initial condition: the deque `l` is the candies that are left.\n\n However, note the example: \n   For the first test case: [1] -> but wait, the example says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" -> so two candies? Actually, the example input is: \n        t=1, n=2, candies = [1,1] -> then they can each eat one and the total is 2.\n\n But the code starts with a deque of [1,1]. Then:\n   cur=0, a=0, b=0 -> then since a>=b (0>=0) -> we pop from the right: b becomes 1, and the deque becomes [1]. Then we check: a (0) != b (1) -> so we don't set ans to 1.\n   Then next iteration: cur=1, now a=0, b=1 -> so we go to the else branch. We must do something.\n\n The problem: the current code only adds to Bob when a>=b, and we need to add to Alice when a < b.\n\n So in the else branch, we should take from the left.\n\n Let me change the else branch to: \n        a += l.popleft()\n\n But then we have:\n   After the first iteration: a=0, b=1, deque=[1]\n   Then in the else branch: we pop from the left: a becomes 1, deque becomes empty. Then we check: a==b? (1==1) -> so we set ans = 2 (because cur becomes 2?).\n\n However, note that we are incrementing `cur` at the beginning of the loop. So:\n   First iteration: cur=1 -> then we add to Bob -> then check: a==b? -> no -> then next.\n   Second iteration: cur=2 -> then we are in the else branch -> we add the left to Alice -> then check: a==b? -> yes -> set ans=2.\n\n Then we break because the deque is empty.\n\n So the answer for the first test case is 2.\n\n But what about the second test case? \n   Example: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> the example says the answer is 7.\n\n However, note the example: \n   \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n How do we get 7? \n   Alice eats 3 candies, Bob eats 4 candies -> total 7.\n\n How to simulate?\n   We start with the entire array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n   We need to simulate until we have a==b? and we want to maximize the total candies (cur).\n\n   However, note: the problem says that they can stop at any time. We are trying to maximize the total number of candies eaten such that a==b.\n\n   The provided algorithm: \n        We start with a=0, b=0, and we have a deque of the candies.\n\n        We do:\n          while the deque is not empty:\n             cur = current count of candies eaten (we start by incrementing by one for the next candy we are going to eat)\n\n             if a>=b: then we take from the right (add to Bob)\n             else: take from the left (add to Alice)\n\n             then if a==b, we update ans = cur.\n\n        Then we print ans.\n\n   But note: we are always eating until the deque is empty? and we update ans every time we have a==b? Then we would get the last time they were equal.\n\n   However, we want the maximum total candies. So we update ans whenever we have a==b and then continue? because we might get a larger total.\n\n   But the problem: if we have a==b at some point, we can stop? or can we continue and then later have a==b again? \n        Actually, we are allowed to stop at any time. So we are looking for the maximum cur for which a==b.\n\n   However, the algorithm continues until the deque is empty. And we update ans every time we have a==b. So the last time we have a==b might not be the maximum cur? \n        Actually, we are incrementing cur at the beginning of the loop. And we are going to eat until the deque is empty. And we update ans whenever a==b. So we are capturing every time they are equal and the total candies at that time.\n\n   But note: we are always adding one candy at a time. And we are updating ans to the last time they were equal? Actually, we update to the current cur. And we want the maximum cur? \n\n   However, the problem: we want the maximum total candies. So we should record the maximum cur for which a==b. But the algorithm updates ans to the current cur every time a==b. So if we have multiple times when a==b, we take the last one? which is the largest cur? \n\n   Example: [1,2,1,1] \n        We want: \n          Initially: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> so we pop from right: b=1, deque=[1,2,1]\n          Then: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> so we pop from left: a=1, deque=[2,1] -> now a==b? yes -> ans=2 (because we are at the second candy: two candies eaten: one from left and one from right) -> then we set ans=2.\n          Then: next iteration: cur=3 -> a=1, b=1 -> a>=b -> so we pop from right: b=1+1=2, deque=[2] -> a!=b -> no update.\n          Then: next iteration: cur=4 -> a=1, b=2 -> a<b -> so we pop from left: a=1+2=3, deque=[] -> then check: a==b? no -> so we break.\n\n        Then we output ans=2. But is there a possibility of 4? \n          We have: \n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3\n            Bob: [1,1] -> 2 -> not equal.\n\n          Alternatively, if we try to stop at 2: that's the only time they are equal.\n\n        But what if we do:\n          Alice: [1] -> 1\n          Bob: [1] -> 1 -> that's 2 candies.\n\n          Or:\n          Alice: [1,2] -> 3\n          Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n          Alice: [1] -> 1\n          Bob: [1,1] -> 2 -> not equal.\n\n        So 2 is the maximum.\n\n   However, consider [1,1,1]: \n        We want: \n          Initially: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1, deque=[1,1]\n          Then: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1, deque=[1] -> a==b -> ans=2.\n          Then: next: cur=3 -> a=1, b=1 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1+1=2, deque=[] -> then check: a!=b -> break.\n\n        So we output 2. But can we have 3? \n          Alice: [1,1] -> 2\n          Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n          Alice: [1] -> 1\n          Bob: [1,1] -> 2 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n          Alice: [1,1,1] -> 3\n          Bob: nothing -> 0 -> not equal.\n\n        So 2 is the maximum.\n\n   But note the example: \n        \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n        The input: n=6, candies = [1,1,1,1,1,1]? Actually, the example says: \n            s(3) = \"BANBANBAN\" -> but that's for program2. \n\n        The second test case in the problem description for program1: \n            \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n        The example: \n            \"For the second test case, ... so the answer is 6\"\n\n        The example input must be: \n            n=6, and weights: [3,1,4,1,5,9]? but the example says they both eat 7. \n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\"\n\n        So the array: [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6] -> \n            Alice: a1+a2+a3 = 7\n            Bob: a4+a5+a6 = 7? but then the total is 14? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> so Bob eats a6, a5, a4 -> and the total is a6+a5+a4=7.\n\n        So the array: [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6] = [7,3,20,5,10,8]? but wait, the example says the fourth test case has [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] and the second test case has 6 candies.\n\n        Actually, the example for the second test case: \n            \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n        And the example: \n            \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> meaning the three rightmost? \n\n        So the array must be: [7,3,20,5,10,8]? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30? but the example says 7? \n\n        Correction: the example says: \n            \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> so 7+3+20 = 30? that's not 7.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n        And the example input: \n            n=6, and the weights: [1,1,1,1,1,1]? then Alice eats 3 from the left: 1+1+1=3, Bob eats 3 from the right: 1+1+1=3 -> then total candies=6.\n\n        But the example says: \"they each eat 7\" -> that must be the fourth test case.\n\n        The fourth test case: \n            n=8, weights = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 10+8+11+1 = 30 -> total candies=7.\n\n        How do we simulate the fourth test case?\n\n        We have: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n        Steps:\n          a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> so we pop from right: b=1, deque becomes [7,3,20,5,10,8,11]\n          cur=1 -> a!=b -> no update.\n\n          Then: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> so we pop from left: a=7, deque=[3,20,5,10,8,11] -> a!=b -> no update.\n\n          Then: a=7, b=1 -> a>=b -> pop from right: b=1+11=12, deque=[3,20,5,10,8] -> no update.\n\n          Then: a=7, b=12 -> a<b -> pop from left: a=7+3=10, deque=[20,5,10,8] -> no update.\n\n          Then: a=10, b=12 -> a<b -> pop from left: a=10+20=30, deque=[5,10,8] -> no update.\n\n          Then: a=30, b=12 -> a>=b -> pop from right: b=12+8=20, deque=[5,10] -> no update.\n\n          Then: a=30, b=20 -> a>=b -> pop from right: b=20+10=30, deque=[5] -> now a==b? 30==30 -> so we set ans=6? (because we have eaten 6 candies? but wait: we started at 0 and we did 6 steps? but note we increment cur at the beginning of each iteration, so we have:\n            step1: cur=1 -> then we ate one candy (Bob:1)\n            step2: cur=2 -> then we ate one candy (Alice:7)\n            step3: cur=3 -> then we ate one candy (Bob:11 -> total Bob=12)\n            step4: cur=4 -> then we ate one candy (Alice:3 -> total Alice=10)\n            step5: cur=5 -> then we ate one candy (Alice:20 -> total Alice=30)\n            step6: cur=6 -> then we ate one candy (Bob:8 -> total Bob=20)\n            step7: cur=7 -> then we ate one candy (Bob:10 -> total Bob=30) -> then we set ans=7.\n\n          Then we break because the deque is not empty? Actually, after step7, the deque becomes [5] -> then we do:\n            step8: cur=8 -> a=30, b=30 -> a>=b -> pop from right? but the deque has only one element -> we pop it: b=30+5=35, then check: a!=b -> no update.\n\n          Then the deque is empty -> break.\n\n          So we output ans=7.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm as described (with the else branch fixed to pop from the left) and updating ans every time a==b (and then continuing) will capture the last time they were equal? which is at step7.\n\n        But note: we update ans every time we have a==b. So if we have a==b at step7, we set ans=7. Then at step8 we break the condition? but we don't reset. And we break the loop when the deque is empty.\n\n        So the code for program1.py: we need to fill the else branch with: \n            a += l.popleft()\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000. This two-pointer (or deque) approach is O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200,000, so it's acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the else branch is: \n            a += l.popleft()\n\n        But note: we must be cautious because we are using a deque. We are popping from the left and the right.\n\n        Let me write the fixed program1.py:\n\n        from collections import deque\n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            n = int(input())\n            l = deque(map(int, input().split()))\n            a, b = 0, 0\n            ans = 0\n            cur = 0\n            while l:\n                cur += 1\n                if a >= b:\n                    b += l.pop()\n                else:\n                    a += l.popleft()\n                if a == b:\n                    ans = cur\n            print(ans)\n\n        However, let's test with the third test case: \n            \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\"\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] -> \n                Step1: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=3, deque=[1,2] -> a!=b -> no update.\n                Step2: a=0, b=3 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1, deque=[2] -> a!=b -> no update.\n                Step3: a=1, b=3 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1+2=3, deque=[] -> then check: a==b? 3==3 -> set ans=3.\n\n            Then we output 3? but the example says 0.\n\n        Why? \n\n        The problem: the third test case? \n            The note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\"\n\n        But we got 3? \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"non-zero\". But 3 is non-zero? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not say they must eat non-zero? but the condition is that they want to be fair: same total weight. \n\n        The note says: \"there is no way\" -> meaning they cannot achieve the same non-zero weight? but they can achieve 3? \n\n        Let me check the example: \n            The third test case: the input is not given. \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n        So they might be able to achieve zero? by not eating any candy? but the problem says: \n            \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\"\n\n        And note: the problem says \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\".\n\n        If they eat zero candies, then the total weight is zero for both, and the total candies is 0.\n\n        But the problem does not say they must eat at least one? \n\n        However, the example: \n            \"For the first test case, ... the answer is 2\"\n\n        So they are allowed to eat zero? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> meaning if she eats, she must eat a contiguous segment from the left? but she can choose to eat zero? \n\n        The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" -> including zero? \n\n        However, the problem does not explicitly say they can eat zero. But the note for the third test case says the answer is 0.\n\n        So in the third test case, they cannot achieve the same non-zero weight? but they can achieve zero by not eating any? and that gives 0 candies.\n\n        But our algorithm: \n            We start with a=0, b=0 -> then we set ans=0? because initially cur=0? but note: we are not entering the loop? because the deque is not empty? \n\n        How do we capture the zero case? \n\n        The problem: we start with a=0, b=0 -> that's equal. But we haven't eaten any candy? so cur=0. \n\n        However, we set ans=0 initially. Then we enter the loop? and we do:\n            cur becomes 1 -> then we pop one candy -> then we break the equality? \n\n        But we want to record the state when they have eaten zero candies? \n\n        We can set ans=0 initially? and then if we never get a==b in the loop, then we output 0? \n\n        However, the problem: \n            We set ans=0 at the beginning. Then we do the loop. If we never set ans again, then we output 0.\n\n        But in the third test case: \n            [1,2,3] -> we set ans=3 at the end? \n\n        But the example says the answer should be 0? \n\n        Why? \n\n        The note: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\" -> meaning they cannot achieve the same non-zero weight? but they can achieve the same non-zero weight? we got 3? \n\n        Actually, the example: \n            \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\"\n\n        This implies that the only possibility is zero candies? \n\n        But we found a way to eat 3 candies and have the same weight? \n\n        Let me check: \n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3\n            Bob: [3] -> 3 -> that's the same non-zero weight.\n\n        Why does the note say there is no way? \n\n        I see: the problem says: \n            \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n        And they cannot overlap. \n\n        In [1,2,3]: \n            Alice eats [1,2] -> then Bob can only eat from the right: the rightmost candy is 3? and that's available? \n\n        So it should be valid.\n\n        But the note says the answer is 0? \n\n        I think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \n            \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n        But then the example input for the third test case must be different.\n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1<=n<=200000) ...\"\n\n        And the third test case: \n            The note says: \"For the fourth test case, ...\" so the third test case is not described? \n\n        Actually, the problem note has four examples: \n            Example 1: n=2, [1,1] -> 2\n            Example 2: n=6, ... -> 6\n            Example 3: ... -> 0\n            Example 4: n=8, ... -> 7\n\n        The third test case: \n            \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\"\n\n        So the input for the third test case must be such that the only time they are equal is at zero? \n\n        Example: [2, 1] -> \n            Step1: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1, deque=[2] -> not equal.\n            Step2: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> pop left: a=2, deque=[] -> then check: 2==1? no -> so we break without updating ans (so ans remains 0).\n\n        Then we output 0.\n\n        So the algorithm: \n            We start with ans=0. Then we do the loop. We update ans only when we have a==b. In the [2,1] case, we never set ans? so we output 0.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py is as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are using a deque with each operation O(1) per candy, so it's O(n) per test case and total O(200000) for all test cases.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing line is: \n            a += l.popleft()\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n The problem: \n   We are given an integer n. We form a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. \n   We can swap any two distinct indices any number of times. We want the string to not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n   We are to output the minimum number of operations m, and then m lines of two indices (i,j) for the swaps.\n\n   The example: \n        n=1: \n            s(1) = \"BAN\"\n            We can swap indices 1 and 2: \n                original: \n                    index1: 'B'\n                    index2: 'A'\n                    index3: 'N'\n                swap index1 and index2: \n                    becomes \"ABN\" -> which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        n=2: \n            s(2) = \"BANBAN\"\n            We swap index2 and index6: \n                becomes: \n                    index1: 'B'\n                    index2: swapped with index6 -> so becomes the last character: 'N'\n                    index3: 'N' -> but wait, let me write the positions:\n\n                Original: \n                  1: 'B'\n                  2: 'A'\n                  3: 'N'\n                  4: 'B'\n                  5: 'A'\n                  6: 'N'\n\n                Swap index2 and index6: \n                  1: 'B'\n                  2: 'N' (from index6)\n                  3: 'N'\n                  4: 'B'\n                  5: 'A'\n                  6: 'A' (from index2)\n\n                So the string: \"B\" (1), \"N\" (2), \"N\" (3), \"B\" (4), \"A\" (5), \"A\" (6) -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n                Now, is \"BAN\" a subsequence? \n                    We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' in order.\n\n                    We can take:\n                         first 'B' at index1, then the 'A' at index5, then the 'N' at index2? -> but index2 is before index5? -> not allowed.\n\n                    How about: \n                         first 'B' at index1, then the next 'A' is at index5, then the next 'N' after index5? there is no 'N' after index5? \n                         or first 'B' at index4, then the next 'A' at index5, then the next 'N'? there is no 'N' after index5.\n\n                So it works.\n\n   The provided code:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        for i in range(t):\n            n = int(input())\n            if n == 1:\n                print(1)\n                print(1,2)\n            elif n%2 :   # if n is odd\n                print(int((n+1)/2))\n                for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            else :       # if n is even\n                print(int(n/2))\n                for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                    print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n   We need to complete the TODO for the odd case.\n\n   The even case: \n        For n even, we output m = n/2.\n        Then we iterate for e in a range: \n            from 2 to int((3*n+1)/2) (inclusive) with step 3.\n\n        Example: n=2 -> \n            m = 2/2 = 1.\n            range: \n                start=2, end = int((3*2+1)/2)+1 = int(7/2)+1 = 3+1 = 4? -> so the range is [2] (since step=3: 2, then 5 -> but 5>4? so only 2)\n            Then we do: \n                print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1) \n                = 2, 2 + int(3*2/2) + 1 = 2 + int(3) + 1 = 2+3+1=6.\n\n            So we print: 2 6 -> which matches the example.\n\n   The odd case: \n        For n odd, we output m = (n+1)/2.\n\n        Then we have a for loop: \n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n\n        We need to output something for each e.\n\n        What should we output? \n\n        The example: n=3 -> \n            m = (3+1)/2 = 2.\n\n            The range: \n                start=2, end = int((3*3+1)/2)+1 = int(10/2)+1 = 5+1 = 6 -> so e in [2, 5] (step=3: so e=2, then e=5)\n\n            What to print for e=2 and e=5?\n\n        The problem: we want to break all \"BAN\" subsequences.\n\n        Observation: \n            The string for n=3: \"BANBANBAN\"\n\n            We can break the pattern by swapping the 'A' in each \"BAN\" with a 'N' from the end? \n\n            The solution in the note for n=2: swapped the second character (which is the 'A' of the first \"BAN\") with the last character (which is the 'N' of the last \"BAN\").\n\n            For n=3, we can do:\n                Operation1: swap the second character (the first 'A') with the last character (the last 'N') -> \n                    becomes: \"B\" then last char becomes 'A', and the first 'A' becomes 'N'? \n                    Then: \n                         index1: 'B'\n                         index2: becomes the last character: which was the last 'N' -> so now index2='N'\n                         index9: becomes the original index2: 'A'\n\n                    So: \"BN\" at the beginning and then the rest: ... and the last character is 'A'.\n\n                Then Operation2: swap the fifth character (which is the 'A' in the second \"BAN\") with the sixth character? or with a character from the end? \n\n            But note: the provided even case swaps the k-th 'A' (which is at position 2 + 3*(k-1)) with a character that is in the second half.\n\n            Specifically, for the even case: \n                We swapped the second character (which is the first 'A') with the last character (which is the last 'N').\n\n            For the odd case, we have an extra \"BAN\". \n\n            The solution: \n                We can break the first (n+1)/2 \"BAN\" blocks? \n\n            How about: \n                For the k-th operation (k from 0 to m-1), we swap the 'A' in the k-th block (which is at position = 2 + 3*k) with the last character of the string? but then the last character might be swapped already.\n\n            Alternatively, we can swap the 'A' in the k-th block with the 'N' in the (n - k)-th block? \n\n            For n=3: \n                Operation1: swap the first 'A' (at index2) with the last 'N' (at index9) -> \n                    becomes: \n                         index1: 'B'\n                         index2: 'N' (from the last block)\n                         index3: 'N' -> but wait, the first block becomes \"B\" then \"N\" then ... \n                         ... and the last block: the last character becomes 'A'\n\n                Then Operation2: swap the second 'A' (which is at index5) with the 'N' in the middle block? but the middle block's 'N' is at index6? \n                    But note: we already swapped the last block's 'N'? so the middle block's 'N' is still at index6? \n\n                So swap index5 and index6: \n                    Then the second block: \n                         originally: index4='B', index5='A', index6='N'\n                         after swap: index4='B', index5='N', index6='A'\n\n                Then the string: \n                    Block1: [0]: 'B', [1]: 'N' (from the last block), [2]: 'N' (original) -> \"BNN\"\n                    Block2: [3]: 'B', [4]: 'N', [5]: 'A' -> \"BNA\"\n                    Block3: [6]: 'B', [7]: 'A' (from the first block? no, we swapped the first block's 'A' with the last block's 'N') -> actually the last block: \n                         originally: [6]='B', [7]='A', [8]='N' -> but we swapped the last block's 'N' (index8? wait, the last block: indices 7,8,9? because the string is 9 characters? \n\n                Actually, the indices for n=3: \n                    Block1: indices 1,2,3 -> [0:3] in 0-indexed: \n                         index0: 'B'\n                         index1: 'A'\n                         index2: 'N'\n                    Block2: indices 4,5,6 -> \n                         index3: 'B'\n                         index4: 'A'\n                         index5: 'N'\n                    Block3: indices 7,8,9 -> \n                         index6: 'B'\n                         index7: 'A'\n                         index8: 'N'\n\n                But note: the problem uses 1-indexed.\n\n                Operation1: swap index2 (which is the second character, so index1 in 0-indexed) and index9 (which is the last character, index8 in 0-indexed) -> \n                    Then:\n                         index0: 'B'\n                         index1: becomes the original last character: 'N' (from the last block)\n                         index8: becomes the original index1: 'A'\n\n                Then the last block becomes: \n                         index6: 'B'\n                         index7: 'A' -> but wait, we didn't touch index7? \n                         index8: 'A' -> so the last block is \"B\", then 'A', then 'A' -> \"BAA\"\n\n                Then Operation2: swap index5 (which is the fifth character, so index4 in 0-indexed) and index6 (the sixth character, index5 in 0-indexed) -> \n                    Then:\n                         index4: becomes the original index5: 'N'\n                         index5: becomes the original index4: 'A'\n\n                Then the string: \n                    Block1: [0]='B', [1]='N', [2]='N' -> \"BNN\"\n                    Block2: [3]='B', [4]='N', [5]='A' -> \"BNA\"\n                    Block3: [6]='B', [7]='A', [8]='A' -> \"BAA\"\n\n                Now, is \"BAN\" a subsequence? \n                    We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N'. \n                    We can take:\n                         'B' at index0, then 'A' at index5, then 'N' at index1? -> but index1 is before index5? -> not allowed.\n                    Then: \n                         'B' at index0, then 'A' at index7, then 'N' at index1? -> again, index1 is before index7? -> not allowed? \n                    Actually, the subsequence must be in increasing index order.\n\n                    How about: \n                         'B' at index0, then next 'A' after index0: the first 'A' is at index5? then after index5: the next 'N'? there is no 'N' after index5? \n                         'B' at index3: then next 'A' after index3: at index5? then next 'N' after index5? none.\n                         'B' at index6: then next 'A' after index6: at index7? then next 'N' after index7? none.\n\n                So it works.\n\n            How to generalize? \n                For the k-th operation (k from 0 to m-1) in the odd case, we swap:\n                    the 'A' in the k-th block (which is at position = 2 + 3*k) with the 'N' in the (n - k - 1)-th block? \n\n                But note: the last block is the (n-1)-th block (0-indexed). \n\n                The position of the 'N' in the (n - k - 1)-th block: \n                    The block starts at 3*(n-k-1) + 1 (1-indexed) and the 'N' is the third character: so at 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k) in 1-indexed? \n\n                Alternatively, we can note that the entire string has length 3*n. The last character is at 3*n. The 'N' in the last block is at 3*n. The 'N' in the second last block is at 3*n - 3, etc.\n\n                Specifically, the 'N' in the j-th block (0-indexed) is at position: 3*j + 3 (1-indexed).\n\n                So for the k-th operation, we want to swap:\n                    the 'A' in the k-th block: at position = 3*k + 2 (1-indexed) \n                    with the 'N' in the (n - k - 1)-th block: at position = 3*(n-k-1) + 3 = 3*(n-k) (1-indexed)\n\n                For k=0: \n                    swap 2 and 3*(n) -> for n=3: 2 and 9 -> which matches.\n\n                For k=1: \n                    swap 3*1+2 = 5 and 3*(3-1) = 3*2 = 6 -> so 5 and 6 -> which matches.\n\n                But note: the even case does something different? \n                    The even case: \n                        for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                            print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n                    For n=2: \n                        e=2: then we print (2, 2 + 3*2/2 + 1) = (2, 2+3+1)= (2,6) -> which is swapping the first 'A' (at 2) with the last character (at 6) -> but the last character is the last 'N'? which is at 6? \n\n                    But the last block's 'N' for n=2: \n                         block0: positions 1,2,3 -> 'N' at 3\n                         block1: positions 4,5,6 -> 'N' at 6.\n\n                    So we swapped the first 'A' (at 2) with the last 'N' (at 6). \n\n                Now, for the odd case, we want to do the same for the first (n+1)//2 blocks? \n\n                But note: the even case does n/2 swaps? and the odd case does (n+1)/2 swaps? \n\n                And in the odd case, we are swapping the k-th 'A' (at 3*k+2) with the (n-k-1)-th block's 'N' (at 3*(n-k))? \n\n                However, the provided even case code does: \n                    for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                        print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n                For n=2: \n                    e=2: then the second index = 2 + 3*2/2 + 1 = 2+3+1=6.\n\n                For n=3 (if we try to use the even formula?): \n                    e in range(2, int((9+1)/2)+1, 3) = range(2, int(10/2)+1, 3) = range(2, 5+1, 3) -> e=2, then e=5? \n                    Then for e=2: second index = 2 + 3*3/2 + 1 -> 2 + 4.5 + 1 -> but that's not integer.\n\n                So the odd case must be handled differently.\n\n                The problem: the provided code for the even case uses a different formula: \n                    print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n                But for the odd case, we have a for loop that iterates over e in the same way? \n\n                We need to output two indices for each e.\n\n                How about: \n                    For the odd case, we do the same as the even case for the first (n-1) blocks? and then the last block? \n\n                Alternatively, we can use the same idea: \n                    We swap the k-th 'A' (at position = 3*k+2) with the (n-k)-th block's 'N'? but note the even case: \n                        k from 0 to m-1: \n                            for the k-th swap, we swap (3*k+2) with (3*n - 3*k)   [because the (n-k-1)-th block's 'N' is at 3*(n-k)].\n\n                But the even case: \n                    for k=0: swap 2 with 3*n? \n                    for k=1: swap 5 with 3*n-3? \n                    etc.\n\n                For the even case, the provided code: \n                    second index = e + int(3*n/2) + 1\n\n                For k=0: e=2 -> second index = 2 + 3*n/2 + 1 = 3 + 3*n/2.\n\n                For n=2: 3 + 3*2/2 = 3+3=6 -> matches.\n\n                For n=4: \n                    k=0: e=2 -> second index = 2 + 3*4/2 + 1 = 2+6+1=9 -> but the last block's 'N' is at 12? and the block we want to swap with is the last block? \n\n                Actually, for n=4, we want to swap the first 'A' (at 2) with the last 'N' (at 12)? but 9 is not 12.\n\n                Alternatively, the provided even case code for n=4: \n                    m = n/2 = 2.\n                    e in range(2, int((3*4+1)/2)+1, 3) = range(2, int(13/2)+1, 3) = range(2, 6+1, 3) -> e=2,5.\n\n                Then for e=2: \n                    print(2, 2 + 3*4/2 + 1) = 2 + 6+1 = 9.\n                For e=5:\n                    print(5, 5+6+1)=5+7=12.\n\n                So we are swapping:\n                    first swap: 2 and 9 -> \n                         originally: \n                             index1: 'B'\n                             index2: 'A' -> becomes the character at index9? which is the third character of the third block? \n                         The third block: \n                             indices: 7,8,9 -> originally: 'B','A','N'\n                         So after swap: \n                             index2: becomes 'N' (from the third block's 'N')\n                             index9: becomes 'A'\n\n                    second swap: 5 and 12 -> \n                         index5: originally the second block's 'A' (at position5) -> becomes the last character? which is the 'N' of the last block (at12)\n                         index12: becomes the 'A' from the second block.\n\n                Then the string: \n                    Block0: [1]='B', [2]='N', [3]='N'? -> wait, the first block: \n                         originally: [1]='B', [2]='A', [3]='N'\n                         after swap: [1]='B', [2]='N' (from the third block's 'N'), [3]='N'? -> but we didn't touch [3]? \n                         Actually, we swapped [2] and [9]: \n                             so [2] becomes the original [9] which is the 'N' of the third block.\n                             [9] becomes the original [2] which is 'A'\n\n                    Block1: [4]='B', [5]='A' -> becomes swapped with [12]: \n                         [5] becomes the original [12] which is the last block's 'N'? \n                         [12] becomes the original [5] which is 'A'\n\n                    Block2: [7]='B', [8]='A', [9] becomes 'A' (from the first block's 'A')\n                    Block3: [10]='B', [11]='A', [12] becomes 'A'\n\n                Then the string: \n                    \"B\", then 'N' at2, then 'N' at3 -> \"BNN\" for the first block.\n                    Then \"B\" at4, then 'N' at5 -> \"BN\" and then the next character is at6? which is the original third character of the first block? which is 'N'? -> but we didn't swap that? \n\n                Actually, the string is 12 characters: \n                    positions 1 to 12.\n\n                After the swaps: \n                    pos1: 'B'\n                    pos2: 'N' (from the third block)\n                    pos3: 'N' (from the first block) -> because the first block's 'N' is still at pos3? \n                    pos4: 'B'\n                    pos5: 'N' (from the last block)\n                    pos6: 'N' (from the first block? no, the first block's 'N' is at pos3? and we didn't move it? \n                    ... \n\n                This is getting messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same formula for both even and odd? \n\n        The idea: \n            We want to swap the k-th 'A' (at position = 3*k+2) with the (n-k-1)-th block's 'N' (at position = 3*(n-k))? \n\n        For the even case: \n            k from 0 to n/2 - 1: \n                swap (3*k+2) and (3*(n-k))\n\n        For the odd case: \n            k from 0 to (n+1)/2 - 1: \n                swap (3*k+2) and (3*(n-k))\n\n        But note: the provided even case code does: \n            for e in range(2, int((3*n+1)/2)+1, 3): \n                print(e, e + int(3*n/2)+1)\n\n        How to express 3*(n-k) in terms of e? \n            e = 3*k+2 -> so k = (e-2)/3.\n\n            Then 3*(n-k) = 3*n - 3*k = 3*n - (e-2) = 3*n - e + 2.\n\n        But the even case code uses: \n            second index = e + 3*n/2 + 1.\n\n        For n even: \n            e = 3*k+2, then 3*n - e + 2 = 3*n - (3*k+2) + 2 = 3*n - 3*k = 3*(n-k)\n\n        And the even case code: \n            e + 3*n/2 + 1 = 3*k+2 + 3*n/2 + 1 = 3*k + 3 + 3*n/2.\n\n        This is not the same as 3*(n-k).\n\n        So the provided even case code does not use the same formula? \n\n        But for n=2: \n            k=0: \n                our formula: swap 2 and 3*(2-0)=6 -> matches.\n            the provided code: 2 and 6 -> matches.\n\n        For n=4: \n            k=0: swap 2 and 3*(4-0)=12 -> but the provided code swaps 2 and 9? \n\n        So they are different.\n\n        How did the provided even case code get 9 for n=4? \n            It does: \n                e=2: second index = 2 + 3*4/2 + 1 = 2+6+1=9.\n\n            Why 9? \n\n        The note for the even case: \n            \"for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\"\n\n        For n=4: \n            (3*4+1)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5 -> int(6.5)=6 -> then +1 -> 7? so the range is from 2 to 7 (step3): e=2,5.\n\n        Then for e=2: \n            second index = 2 + 3*4/2 + 1 = 2+6+1=9.\n        For e=5:\n            second index = 5+6+1=12.\n\n        So it's swapping the first 'A' (at2) with the character at9, and the second 'A' (at5) with the character at12.\n\n        What is at position9? \n            The string: \n                positions: \n                  1: 'B'\n                  2: 'A'\n                  3: 'N'\n                  4: 'B'\n                  5: 'A'\n                  6: 'N'\n                  7: 'B'\n                  8: 'A'\n                  9: 'N'\n                  10: 'B'\n                  11: 'A'\n                  12: 'N'\n\n            So position9 is the 'N' of the third block.\n\n        And position12 is the 'N' of the last block.\n\n        Why swap with the third block's 'N' for the first swap? \n\n        The problem: we want to break the subsequence \"BAN\". \n\n        The idea: \n            We break the first block by moving its 'A' to a position that is after the 'B' of the first block but not followed by an 'N'? \n\n        Actually, the solution in the note for n=2: swapped the first 'A' with the last 'N'. \n\n        For n=4, we are swapping the first 'A' with the third block's 'N'? and the second 'A' with the last block's 'N'. \n\n        This is a valid solution? \n\n        How about we do the same for the odd case? \n            We have m = (n+1)//2 swaps.\n\n            We iterate e in the range: \n                from 2 to int((3*n+1)/2)+1, step3.\n\n            Then for each e, we print(e, e + 3*n//2 + 1)   [using integer division?]\n\n        But for n=3: \n            m = (3+1)//2 = 2.\n            range: \n                start=2, end = int((3*3+1)/2)+1 = int(10/2)+1 = 5+1=6 -> so e=2,5.\n\n            Then for e=2: \n                second index = 2 + 3*3//2 + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7?   (since 3*3//2 = 9//2 = 4 in integer division? but note: the problem uses int() which truncates? so 10/2=5.0 -> int(5.0)=5? then 5+1=6? so the range is 2 to 6? and step3: e=2,5)\n\n            Then for e=2: print(2, 2+ (3*3)//2 + 1) -> 2 + 9//2 + 1 = 2+4+1=7? \n            For e=5: print(5, 5+4+1)=5+5=10.\n\n            But the string for n=3 has only 9 characters -> so 10 is out of bounds.\n\n        We must use the same formula as the even case? \n\n        The even case formula: \n            second index = e + 3*n/2 + 1\n\n        But for n=3: 3*n/2 = 9/2 = 4.5 -> then we use int(3*n/2) -> 4? then 2+4+1=7, 5+4+1=10 -> but 10 is beyond 9.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            second index = 3*n - (e-2)   [which is 3*n - e + 2] -> for e=2: 9-2+2=9 -> matches the first swap we wanted (2 and 9).\n            for e=5: 9-5+2=6 -> so swap 5 and 6.\n\n        That matches our earlier solution for n=3.\n\n        And for n=2: \n            e=2: 6-2+2=6 -> matches.\n\n        And for n=4: \n            e=2: 12-2+2=12 -> but the provided even case code for n=4 uses 9? \n\n        Why the discrepancy? \n\n        The problem: the provided even case code for n=4 does not swap 2 and 12? it swaps 2 and 9, and 5 and 12.\n\n        But note: if we swap 2 and 12 for n=4: \n            Then the first block: \n                originally: [1]='B', [2]='A', [3]='N'\n                after swap: [1]='B', [2] becomes the last character: 'N' (from the last block), [3]='N'? \n            Then the last block: \n                [10]='B', [11]='A', [12] becomes the original [2]='A'\n\n            Then we have: \n                Block0: \"B\", \"N\", \"N\" -> \"BNN\"\n                Block3: \"B\", \"A\", \"A\" -> \"BAA\"\n\n            Then we still have the second and third blocks: \n                Block1: [4]='B', [5]='A', [6]='N' -> \"BAN\" -> which is bad.\n\n        So we must break every block? \n\n        The solution: we break the first m blocks by swapping their 'A' with a 'N' from the last m blocks? \n\n        Specifically, we swap the k-th 'A' (at 3*k+2) with the (n - k)-th block's 'N'? which is at 3*(n-k) - 0? but the last block is the n-th block? \n\n        Actually, the blocks are 0-indexed: \n            block0: positions 1,2,3\n            block1: positions 4,5,6\n            ...\n            block i: positions 3*i+1, 3*i+2, 3*i+3.\n\n            The 'N' in block i is at 3*i+3.\n\n        So the (n-k-1)-th block? that would be block (n-k-1) -> its 'N' is at 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k).\n\n        But the provided even case code for n=4 swaps:\n            k=0: swap block0's 'A' (at2) with block2's 'N' (at 3*2+3 = 9) -> which is the third block? \n            k=1: swap block1's 'A' (at5) with block3's 'N' (at 3*3+3=12) -> the last block.\n\n        So they are swapping with the (n/2 + k)-th block? \n\n        Specifically, for n=4: \n            k=0: swap with block2 (which is the block at index2, which is the third block) -> which is at offset n/2 = 2? \n            k=1: swap with block3 (which is the next one?).\n\n        How to express the index of the block we are swapping with? \n            It is the block at index = n - k - 1? \n                for k=0: n-k-1 = 4-0-1=3? -> but they swapped with block2 (index2) not block3.\n\n        Actually, they swapped with the block at index = n - k - 1 - (n/2 - 1)? \n\n        Alternatively, the second index in the even case code: \n            e + 3*n/2 + 1 = 3*k+2 + 3*n/2 + 1 = 3*k + 3 + 3*n/2.\n\n        For n=4: 3*k+3+6 = 3*k+9.\n            k=0: 9\n            k=1: 12\n\n        And the block index for the 'N' we are swapping with: \n            position = 3*k+9 -> \n                for k=0: 9 -> which is the third block's 'N' (block2: index2, because block0:1..3, block1:4..6, block2:7..9 -> so 9 is the last of block2)\n            for k=1: 12 -> which is the last block's 'N'\n\n        How to relate 9 to the block? \n            It is the last character of the first half? \n            The entire string length=12, so the first half is 6? but 9 is in the second half.\n\n        Actually, the formula: \n            second index = e + 3*n//2 + 1\n\n        But for the odd case, we cannot use 3*n//2 because it is not integer? \n\n        However, the problem says: \n            for the even case: \n                for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                    print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n            for the odd case: \n                we have a for loop in the same range? \n\n        We need to output the same structure.\n\n        For the odd case, we can do: \n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        Let me test for n=3: \n            e=2: 3*3 - 2 + 2 = 9 -> valid.\n            e=5: 9 -5+2=6 -> valid.\n\n        And for n=1: \n            The odd case? but the code has a separate branch for n=1.\n\n        For n=5: \n            m = (5+1)//2 = 3.\n            range: \n                start=2, end = int((15+1)/2)+1 = int(16/2)+1 = 8+1=9 -> so e=2,5,8.\n\n            Then:\n                e=2: second index = 15-2+2=15\n                e=5: 15-5+2=12\n                e=8: 15-8+2=9.\n\n            So we swap:\n                (2,15), (5,12), (8,9)\n\n            This is within the bounds (1 to 15).\n\n        Why is this valid? \n            We are swapping the 'A' in block0 (at2) with the last 'N' (at15) -> breaks block0 and the last block.\n            Then the 'A' in block1 (at5) with the 'N' in block3 (at12) -> because block3: starts at 3*3+1=10, so 'N' at12.\n            Then the 'A' in block2 (at8) with the 'N' in block2? wait, block2: starts at 3*2+1=7, so 'N' at9 -> so we swap the 'A' and the 'N' in block2? \n                originally: block2: [7]='B', [8]='A', [9]='N'\n                after swap: [7]='B', [8]='N', [9]='A'\n\n            This breaks the block2.\n\n        So it should work.\n\n        Therefore, for the TODO in the odd case, we can do:\n            print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        But note: the even case uses a different formula. However, the problem says: \n            \"if there are multiple possible answers, output any\"\n\n        And we are within the minimum number of operations (which is (n+1)//2).\n\n        However, the provided even case code does not use this formula. \n\n        But the problem says: the even case code is provided and works. \n\n        We have two options for the odd case: \n            Option1: use the same formula as the even case: \n                        print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n            Option2: use the formula: \n                        print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        But for the even case, the two formulas are different? \n            For n=2: \n                Option1: e=2 -> 2+3+1=6.\n                Option2: 3*2 -2+2=6 -> same.\n            For n=4: \n                Option1: e=2 -> 2+6+1=9.\n                Option2: 12-2+2=12 -> different.\n\n        So they are not the same.\n\n        How about we use the same as the even case for the odd case? \n            For the odd case, we do: \n                print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n            For n=3: \n                e=2: 2 + int(9/2)+1 = 2+4+1=7.\n                e=5: 5+4+1=10.\n\n            But 10 is beyond 9.\n\n        So we cannot use the even case formula for the odd case.\n\n        Therefore, we use the formula: \n            print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        And this matches the example for n=3.\n\n        But note: the range for the even case in the provided code is: \n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3)\n\n        And for the odd case, we use the same range.\n\n        And then for each e in that range, we print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        This will work.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code in the odd case is:\n            print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        But note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\n        And 3*n - e + 2 is within [1, 3*n]? \n            e is at least 2, so 3*n - e + 2 <= 3*n -2+2 = 3*n -> valid.\n            e is at most ... the last e in the range: \n                the range goes up to int((3*n+1)/2)+1 -> which is at most (3*n+1)/2 + 1 < 3*n for n>=2.\n\n        So it's valid.\n\n        Let me test with n=1 in the odd case? \n            But the code has a separate branch for n=1.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the completed program2.py for the odd case:\n\n            elif n%2 :\n                print(int((n+1)/2))\n                for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                    print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        But note: the problem says the total operations must be at most 10^5, and n<=100, so (n+1)/2 <= 50.5 -> at most 50 operations per test case, and t<=100 -> total operations <= 5000, which is safe.\n\n        And the indices are within [1, 3*n] and distinct.\n\n        So we are done.\n\nSummary:\n\n  program1.py: \n      missing line: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n  program2.py:\n      missing block for the odd case: \n          for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n              print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n  But note: the provided code for the even case uses a different formula, but we are not changing that.\n\n  We output in the required JSON format.\n\n  Note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and \"NOT as markdown code\". And the structure: \n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n  For program1, the missing code is a single line? \n        We are replacing the line: \n            # TODO: Your code here\n        with: \n            a += l.popleft()\n\n        So the completion for program1 is that line.\n\n  For program2, the missing code is a block of two lines? \n        We are replacing:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        with two lines: \n            print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\n        But note: the for loop is already there.\n\n        Actually, the TODO is inside the for loop. So we only need to complete the body of the for loop.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2 is: \n            \"print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\"\n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  But the program2.py code for the odd case already has the for loop structure. We only need to fill the body.\n\n  So we output:\n\n      \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n      \"program2\": \"print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\"\n\n  But wait: the program2.py code for the odd case has the for loop and then the TODO. We are replacing the TODO line with the print statement.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n  So we output only the code that is missing.\n\n  But note: the program1.py has only one line missing? and program2.py has one line missing (the body of the for loop).\n\n  However, the program2.py code for the odd case has:\n\n        for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO line with a print statement.\n\n  So the missing code for program2 is the line: \"print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\".\n\n  But note: the problem says \"blocks\", so if it were multiple lines we would output multiple lines. But here it's one line.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\", \n        \"program2\": \"print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\"\n      }\n\n  However, let me check the example for n=3 in program2: \n        We output:\n            2\n            2 9\n            5 6\n\n        But the example in the note for n=3 is not provided, but we designed it to be valid.\n\n  But the problem says: for the first test case (n=1) we output 1 and then 1 2.\n        for the second test case (n=2) we output 1 and then 2 6.\n        for the third test case (n=3) we output 2 and then two lines: 2 9 and 5 6.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, note: the example in the problem for n=2: \n        \"In the second testcase, s(2) = \\\"BANBAN\\\", we can swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6\"\n\n        So we output 2 and 6, which is what we do.\n\n  So we are good.\n\n  But note: the even case code for n=2: \n        else:\n            print(int(n/2))   -> 1\n            for e in range(2, int((3*2+1)/2)+1, 3): \n                int((6+1)/2)=int(7/2)=3, so range(2, 3+1, 3) -> only e=2.\n            then print(e, e+int(3*2/2)+1) = 2, 2+3+1=6.\n\n  So it's correct.\n\n  Therefore, we output the JSON."
