For example, n=6: then b=0 -> invalid (positive integers) -> but n=6: then n-6=0 -> invalid. So we require n-6>=1 -> n>=7? but n%4==2: the smallest n is 6 -> so n=6 is not covered. Therefore, for n=6 we must use the (1,3,1,1) solution. How about n=10: \n          using (2,10-6,2,2) = (2,4,2,2) -> \n          gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> works. But n=6: we cannot use (2,0,2,2) -> invalid. So we can do:\n\n          if n>=10? But the problem says n>=4, and n%4==2: n=6,10,14,...\n\n      We can do:\n\n          if n==6:\n              print(1,3,1,1,end=' ')\n          else:\n              print(2, n-6, 2, 2, end=' ') But the problem says: the total test cases t up to 10000, and n up to 10^9, so we cannot check n==6 for every n%4==2? Alternatively, we can use the solution (1, n-3, 1, 1) for all n%4==2. Why not? It works for n=6,10,14, etc. But let's test n=10: \n          (1,7,1,1): \n            gcd(1,7)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe current code uses a deque and tries to simulate the process by having two pointers (from left and right) and building up the sums for Alice (a) and Bob (b). However, the current code has a TODO in the else part and the logic might not be complete.\n\nThe problem: We have two people, Alice and Bob, eating candies from the left and right respectively. They want the total weight eaten by each to be equal, and we wish to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nNote: The current code initializes:\n  a = 0 (Alice's total weight from the left)\n  b = 0 (Bob's total weight from the right)\n  ans = 0 (to record the maximum total candies eaten when a == b)\n  cur = 0 (current count of candies eaten)\n\nThe while loop runs as long as there are candies. The current code does:\n  cur += 1   (this counts the next candy to be eaten, but note: we are going to eat one candy in each step? Actually, we are popping one candy per step, but we are not sure which side)\n\nIn the condition:\n  if a >= b: then we pop from the right (and add to Bob) because Bob's sum is less or equal? Actually, the idea is to balance the two sums.\n\nHowever, the note in the example: \n  For the first test case: [1] -> Alice eats one from left, Bob eats one from right? But the example says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" and the answer is 2.\n\nBut the array has one candy? Actually, the first test case: \n  Input: \n      t=1\n      n=2\n      weights: [1,1]\n\nSo the current code uses a deque and starts with [1,1]. Then:\n  Step1: cur=1, a>=b (0>=0) -> so we pop from right: b=1, then check: a==b? 0==1 -> no, so no update to ans.\n  Step2: cur=2, now a=0, b=1 -> a < b -> so we go to the else. But the else is missing.\n\nWe need to complete the else part.\n\nActually, the intended logic is:\n  We have two pointers (or a deque) and we can add to Alice if her current sum is less than Bob's, and to Bob if his current sum is less than Alice's.\n\nBut note: the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot skip. So we have two pointers: one starting at the left (for Alice) and one at the right (for Bob). We can simulate:\n\n  left = 0, right = n-1\n  a = 0, b = 0\n  count = 0\n  We want to maximize the total number of candies (count) such that a == b.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to have Alice eat a contiguous segment from the left and Bob from the right, but they cannot overlap. So we can simulate:\n\n  We can have two pointers and two sums. We start with a=0, b=0, and then:\n    if a <= b: then we take one from the left (and add to a) and advance the left pointer.\n    else: take one from the right (and add to b) and advance the right pointer.\n\n  Then whenever a == b, we record the total candies eaten (which is (left pointer) + (n - 1 - right pointer)).\n\nBut note: the current code uses a deque and pops from the left? Actually, no, it only pops from the right in the if, and the else is missing.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  We have two pointers: left_index and right_index, and we traverse until left_index <= right_index.\n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can do two pointers.\n\nHowever, the current code uses a deque and pops. We can fix the else part to pop from the left? But note: the deque has the left as the front and right as the back.\n\nSo:\n  if a >= b: then we are going to pop from the right (and add to Bob) because Bob's sum is less? Actually, if a>=b, then Bob is behind, so we add to Bob.\n  else: then we should add to Alice? So we pop from the left.\n\nBut the current code has:\n  if a>=b: \n      b += l.pop()\n  else:\n      # TODO: we should do a += l.popleft()\n\nBut note: the condition is a>=b, so if a>=b we add to Bob (from the right). If a < b, we add to Alice (from the left).\n\nThen, after adding, we check if a==b and then set ans = cur (which is the total number of candies eaten so far).\n\nBut note: we are popping one candy per iteration, so cur counts the total candies eaten.\n\nHowever, the problem is: we are not allowed to necessarily eat all candies? And we want the maximum total candies when the two sums are equal.\n\nBut the current code sets ans = cur every time a==b. We want the maximum cur? Actually, we want the last time (or the maximum) when a==b? But note: as we eat more candies, the sums might become equal again? Actually, no: because we are only adding positive numbers. The sums are increasing. Once we pass an equality, we might not get another? Actually, we might: consider [1,2,3,3,2,1]. \n  Step1: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1, cur=1 -> not equal.\n  Step2: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1, cur=2 -> now a==b -> ans=2.\n  Step3: a=1, b=1 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1+2=3, cur=3 -> not equal.\n  Step4: a=1, b=3 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1+2=3, cur=4 -> a==b -> ans=4.\n  Step5: a=3, b=3 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=3+3=6, cur=5 -> not equal.\n  Step6: a=3, b=6 -> a<b -> pop left: a=3+3=6, cur=6 -> a==b -> ans=6.\n\nSo we update ans every time we have equality, and the last equality might be the one with the most candies? Actually, yes, because we are going until the deque is empty. And we want the maximum total candies.\n\nBut note: the example test cases:\n\nTest case 1: [1,1] -> \n  Step1: a=0>=b=0 -> pop right: b=1, cur=1 -> not equal.\n  Step2: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1, cur=2 -> a==b -> ans=2 -> then the deque becomes empty -> output 2. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> the example says the answer is 7. How?\n  Actually, the example says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (total 30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (total 30). So total candies eaten: 3+4=7.\n\nHow to simulate?\n  We have: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n  We need to get a=30 and b=30. How does the two-pointer work?\n\n  We start:\n    a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1 -> cur=1\n    a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> pop left: a=7 -> cur=2\n    a=7, b=1 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1+11=12 -> cur=3\n    a=7, b=12 -> a<b -> pop left: a=7+3=10 -> cur=4\n    a=10, b=12 -> a<b -> pop left: a=10+20=30 -> cur=5\n    a=30, b=12 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=12+8=20 -> cur=6\n    a=30, b=20 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=20+10=30 -> cur=7 -> now a==b -> ans=7.\n\n  Then we continue? But we have the middle [5] left? \n    Then: a=30, b=30 -> a>=b -> pop right: but the deque now has [5]? Actually, we have popped from both ends until the deque is [5]? Then we pop the 5: b=30+5=35 -> cur=8 -> not equal.\n\n  Then the while loop ends? Actually, the deque becomes empty after popping the 5? Then we break.\n\n  So we recorded ans=7 at cur=7.\n\n  But note: we have to break when the deque becomes empty? Yes.\n\n  However, we also have to consider that we might have an equality at cur=7 and then we break at cur=8? But we set ans=7 at the time we had cur=7.\n\n  So the code would output 7.\n\n  But what if we have multiple equalities? We want the last one? Actually, we want the maximum total candies, so we update whenever we have an equality. The last update will be the maximum because we are adding one candy at a time.\n\n  However, note: the total candies eaten at an equality is cur, and we are increasing cur by one each time we eat a candy.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      if a == b:\n          ans = cur   # because we have eaten cur candies and they are equal.\n\n  But note: we update even if we have a later equality? Yes, and that will be a larger cur.\n\n  So the algorithm is:\n\n      t = int(input())\n      for each test case:\n          n = int(input())\n          l = deque(list of n integers)\n          a = 0, b = 0, cur = 0, ans = 0\n          while l is not empty:\n              cur += 1\n              if a <= b:   # actually, the condition in the given code is a>=b, but we see that if a>=b we add to Bob? \n                  # But wait: if a>=b, then Bob is behind? Actually, we want to add to the smaller one? \n                  # However, the given code condition is a>=b -> then we add to Bob (from the right). \n                  # But if a>=b, then Bob has less, so we add to Bob to try to catch up.\n                  # Similarly, if a < b, we add to Alice.\n\n                  # But note: the condition in the given code is \"if a>=b\", so we do:\n                  #   b += l.pop()\n                  # else: we do a += l.popleft()\n\n              Then if a==b: ans = cur\n\n          print(ans)\n\n  However, the condition in the given code is \"if a>=b\", which is the same as above? Actually, the condition is the opposite? \n\n  Let me reexamine:\n\n      We have two sums: a (from the left) and b (from the right). We want to balance them.\n\n      If a >= b, then Bob (the right) is behind? Actually, Bob's sum is less than or equal to Alice's? Then we should add to Bob? Yes, so we pop from the right and add to Bob.\n\n      If a < b, then Alice is behind? Then we add to Alice by popping from the left.\n\n  So the condition is correct.\n\n  Therefore, we complete the else part by:\n\n      else:\n          a += l.popleft()\n\n  But wait: the example test case 3: [3, 6, 2, 3] -> the example says answer=0.\n\n  Let's simulate:\n\n      [3,6,2,3]\n\n      Step1: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=3, cur=1 -> not equal.\n      Step2: a=0, b=3 -> a<b -> pop left: a=3, cur=2 -> now a==b? 3==3 -> so ans=2.\n      Step3: a=3, b=3 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=3+2=5, cur=3 -> not equal.\n      Step4: a=3, b=5 -> a<b -> pop left: a=3+6=9, cur=4 -> not equal.\n\n      Then we output ans=2? But the example says 0.\n\n  Why? The note: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n  But we got 2? \n\n  Actually, the third test case in the example is: \n      \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n  But our simulation found 2? \n\n  Let me check the example: the third test case is from the sample? The problem says:\n\n      Input: \n          t\n          n\n          weights\n\n      The sample test cases:\n\n        Test case 1: n=2, [1,1] -> output 2.\n        Test case 2: n=8, [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> output 7.\n        Test case 3: n=4, [3,6,2,3] -> output 0? but we got 2.\n\n      Why? The note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n      But we got 2? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\"\n\n      In our simulation, we had a=3 and b=3. But note: the candies we ate: \n          Alice ate the first candy (3) and Bob ate the last candy (3). \n          But the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot skip. \n          So Alice ate [3] and Bob ate [3]. The middle two [6,2] are not eaten? \n\n      And the condition is satisfied: both have 3. \n\n      Why then the example says 0? \n\n      Let me read the sample note again: \n          \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n      This implies that the sample input for the third test case must be different.\n\n      Actually, the problem statement says: \n          \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n      And the third test case: \n          \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n      The sample input for the third test case is not provided explicitly? \n\n      But the constraints say: the total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n      The sample input for the problem is:\n\n        t=4\n        n=2: [1,1] -> 2\n        n=8: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> 7\n        n=4: [3,6,2,3] -> 0? but we got 2.\n\n      This is a contradiction.\n\n      Actually, the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n      But we found a way: Alice eats the first candy (3) and Bob eats the last candy (3). That is non-zero.\n\n      I see the problem: the problem says \"non-zero weight\", but we have 3 which is non-zero. \n\n      Alternatively, the problem might mean that they cannot have the same positive weight? But 3 is positive.\n\n      After checking the sample note: the third test case is described as: \n          \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n      But our simulation found 2.\n\n      I suspect the third test case in the problem is different. The problem says:\n\n          \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n          and the third test case: n=4, [3,6,2,3] -> but the example output is 0? \n\n      Actually, the problem note says: \"For the fourth test case\" and then the fifth test case? \n\n      The sample test cases in the problem note:\n\n        Test case 1: [1,1] -> 2\n        Test case 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> 6? but the example says 6? Actually, the example says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\" -> but wait, the example says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7+3+20=30) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 10+8+11=29?) -> wait, the example says: Bob eats the first three from the right: [11,8,10]? but the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> the right three: 1,11,8 -> 1+11+8=20? \n\n      Actually, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that doesn't add up.\n\n      Let me reread: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n      How? The array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n          Alice: [7,3,20] -> 7+3+20 = 30? \n          Bob: [1,11,8] -> 1+11+8=20? \n\n      But the example says 7? \n\n      Actually, the example says: \"the answer is 6\" because they eat six candies. \n\n      And the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three rightmost: [1,11,8]? \n\n      But then the total weight is 20, not 7.\n\n      I see: the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are first when starting from the right? But the example says: \"the first three from the right\" meaning the three that are at the rightmost? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". So he must eat a contiguous segment from the right? \n\n      But note: the candies are in a row. So Bob must eat a contiguous segment starting from the last candy and moving leftwards? \n\n      So Bob's candies are a contiguous segment at the right. Similarly, Alice's are contiguous at the left.\n\n      Therefore, the entire set of candies eaten is: a prefix and a suffix that do not overlap.\n\n      In the second test case: \n          Alice: [7,3,20] (the first three) -> 30\n          Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> the last four: 10+8+11+1 = 30? -> 10+8+11+1=30? 10+8=18, 18+11=29, 29+1=30 -> yes.\n\n      So Bob ate the last four? Then the total candies is 3+4=7? But the example says 6? \n\n      The example says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\" -> but 3+4=7.\n\n      Actually, the example says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\" -> that doesn't match.\n\n      I see: the example says: \"the answer is 6\" but then the fourth test case example says the answer is 7.\n\n      There is a discrepancy.\n\n      After reading the problem again: \n          \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n      But the example input for the second test case: n=8, and the answer is 6? \n\n      How? 6 candies in total? \n\n      They must have eaten 3 by Alice and 3 by Bob? \n\n      How to get 3+3=6? \n          Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30? \n          Bob: [1,11,8] -> 20? -> not equal.\n\n      Alternatively: \n          Alice: [7,3] -> 10\n          Bob: [1,8,11] -> 20 -> not equal.\n\n      Or:\n          Alice: [7] -> 7\n          Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n      Or:\n          Alice: [7,3,20,5] -> 35\n          Bob: [1,11] -> 12 -> not equal.\n\n      How about:\n          Alice: [7,3] -> 10\n          Bob: [10] -> 10 -> then total candies=3? \n\n      But Bob must eat from the right without skipping: so he must eat the entire suffix? \n\n      The problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". So he can choose any contiguous segment from the right? Actually, no: he must start at the rightmost and go left without skipping? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"from the right\", meaning he can choose any contiguous segment that is a suffix? \n\n      So Bob can choose a suffix of any length? Similarly, Alice a prefix.\n\n      Then the second test case: \n          Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n          Bob: [1,11,8,10] -> 30 -> total 7 candies? \n\n      But the example says: \"the answer is 6\" because they eat six candies? \n\n      The example says: \"the answer is 6\" and then the fourth test case says the answer is 7.\n\n      I see: the example note for the second test case says: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n      How can the total weight be 7? \n\n      The array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n          If Alice eats the first three: 7+3+20 = 30? \n          Bob eats the last three: 1+11+8 = 20? \n\n      But the example says 7? \n\n      I think there is a typo. The problem says: \n          \"For the second test case, ... (with total weight 7)\" \n\n      That must be a typo. The intended total weight is 30? \n\n      And the example says: \"the answer is 6\" -> but 3+3=6? \n\n      How to get 6? \n\n      We can have:\n          Alice: [7,3] -> 10\n          Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30? -> no.\n\n      Or:\n          Alice: [7,3,20,5] -> 35\n          Bob: [11,1] -> 12 -> no.\n\n      How about:\n          Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n          Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30 -> total 7 candies.\n\n      But the example says 6? \n\n      The problem note says: \"the answer is 6\" and then \"For the fourth test case ... the answer is 7\".\n\n      I see: the problem note for the second test case says: \"the answer is 6\" but the example input for the second test case is n=8? \n\n      And the fourth test case: n=9? \n\n      The problem says: \n          \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n      So the second test case must be different? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \n          \"For the second test case\" -> meaning the second test case in the sample input.\n\n      The sample input has:\n          t=4\n          test case1: n=2 -> [1,1] -> output 2\n          test case2: n=8 -> [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> output 7? but the problem note says output 6? \n\n      And then test case3: n=4 -> [3,6,2,3] -> output 0? \n      test case4: n=9? -> output 7? \n\n      But the problem note says for the second test case the answer is 6? \n\n      I see: the problem note says: \n          \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n      But the code in the problem statement for the second test case: \n          \"For the second test case, ... They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n      This implies that in the second test case, they ate all 8 candies? and the total is 6? That doesn't make sense.\n\n      After re\u2010reading the problem statement: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n      How can the total weight be 7? \n\n      The only possibility is that the array for the second test case is not [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] but a different one? \n\n      The problem says: \n          \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n      and the sample input for the second test case: n=8, and then the list.\n\n      But the example output for the second test case is 6? \n\n      I think there is a mistake in the problem note. The intended example for the second test case might be a different array.\n\n      However, the problem says: \n          \"For the second test case\" and then the fourth test case uses the same array? \n\n      Given the confusion, let us trust the algorithm we designed: \n          We use a deque and two sums: a and b.\n          We start with a=0, b=0, and cur=0, and ans=0.\n          While the deque is not empty:\n              cur += 1\n              if a >= b:\n                  pop from the right and add to b.\n              else:\n                  pop from the left and add to a.\n              if a == b:\n                  ans = cur   # because we have eaten cur candies and they are equal.\n\n          Then print ans.\n\n      But the third test case [3,6,2,3] gives 2, but the example says 0.\n\n      Why 0? The problem says: \"there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\", but we found a way.\n\n      I see: the problem might require that they eat at least one candy? But we did. \n\n      Or the problem might be that they cannot eat the same non-zero weight if we consider the entire process? But we found a state at cur=2 where a==b=3.\n\n      The problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\" -> so we want the maximum total candies for which a==b.\n\n      In [3,6,2,3]: we have two states: \n          at cur=2: a=3, b=3 -> total=2.\n          at cur=4: a=3+6=9, b=3+2=5 -> not equal? \n          and then we break.\n\n      So the maximum is 2.\n\n      But the example says 0.\n\n      This is a contradiction.\n\n      After checking the official example: \n          \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n      This implies that the third test case is not [3,6,2,3] but something else? \n\n      The problem says: \n          \"The second line of each test case contains n integers\"\n\n          and the third test case: n=4, [3,6,2,3] -> but then the answer should be 2.\n\n      I suspect the sample test case 3 is actually [1,2,3,4] or something else.\n\n      Given the constraints, we must rely on the algorithm.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"For the third test case, ... answer is 0\", so the sample input for the third test case must be one that never has a==b except at 0.\n\n      For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4]:\n          Step1: a=0>=b=0 -> pop right: b=4, cur=1\n          Step2: a=0, b=4 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1, cur=2 -> not equal.\n          Step3: a=1, b=4 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1+2=3, cur=3 -> not equal.\n          Step4: a=3, b=4 -> a<b -> pop left: a=3+3=6, cur=4 -> not equal.\n\n          Then we break, and ans remains 0.\n\n      So the third test case might be [1,2,3,4]? \n\n      But the problem says the third test case has n=4? and the array [3,6,2,3] is the fourth? \n\n      The problem says: \n          \"For the fourth test case, ... the answer is 7\"\n\n      and the fourth test case: n=9? \n\n      Given the confusion, we stick to the algorithm.\n\n      But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000, and we are using a deque and popping each element once, so O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\n      However, the sample test case 3 in the problem is not [3,6,2,3] but one that yields 0.\n\n      How to resolve? \n\n      The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\", meaning that there is no non-zero weight partition? \n\n      But our algorithm sets ans=0 initially, and if we never see a==b during the process, then we output 0.\n\n      So for [1,2,3,4] we output 0.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n      But then why for [3,6,2,3] we output 2? \n\n      The problem says the third test case is one that yields 0, so it must be a different array.\n\n      We'll assume the algorithm is as described.\n\n      Therefore, we complete program1.py by adding in the else part:\n\n          a += l.popleft()\n\n      But note: the given code uses a deque and we have to import deque? It is already imported.\n\n      However, the given code has:\n\n          from collections import deque\n\n      So we are safe.\n\n      But wait: the example test case 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> we want to output 7? \n          We did the simulation and got 7.\n\n      And the fourth test case: [2,4,1,3,1,2] -> the example says: \n          \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n      But that is the same as the second test case? \n\n      Actually, the fourth test case in the problem is a different one: \n          \"For the fourth test case, ... the answer is 7\"\n\n      and the input is: \n          n=9? \n\n      But the example input for the fourth test case is not provided.\n\n      We trust the algorithm.\n\n      Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n      But note: the given code has:\n\n          while l:\n              cur += 1\n              if a>=b:\n                  b += l.pop()\n              else:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we write: a += l.popleft()\n\n      However, we must be cautious: what if the deque becomes empty during the popleft? The while condition checks at the beginning, so we are safe.\n\n      But what if we try to pop from an empty deque? The while loop condition ensures there is at least one element.\n\n      So we write:\n\n          else:\n              a += l.popleft()\n\n      Now, for program2.py:\n\n      The problem: Given n, find four positive integers a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\n      The current code:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for i in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              m = n//4\n              if n % 4 == 0:\n                  print(m, m, m, m, end=' ')\n              elif n % 4 == 1:\n                  print(m, 2*m, m, 1, end=' ')\n              elif n % 4 == 2:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              else:   # n % 4 == 3\n                  print(2, 4*m-2, 2, 1, end=' ')\n              print(sep='')\n\n      We need to complete the case when n % 4 == 2.\n\n      The examples:\n\n          n=4: (1,1,1,1) -> gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n          n=7: (2,2,2,1) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n          n=8: (2,2,2,2) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> works.\n          n=9: (2,4,2,1) -> gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n          n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n      How about n=6? \n          n=6: 6 % 4 = 2 -> we need to output.\n\n      The example: n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> 3+5+1+1=10.\n\n      How to generalize?\n\n      We note that the problem says: \"It is possible to show that the answer always exists.\"\n\n      The current code uses m = n//4.\n\n      For n=6: m = 6//4 = 1.\n\n      We need to output four positive integers.\n\n      We can try:\n\n          We want gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d) = x.\n\n      The sample for n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> x=1.\n\n      For n=6: we can try x=1? \n          Then we need a and b such that gcd(a,b)=1, and c and d such that lcm(c,d)=1 -> then c=d=1.\n          Then a+b+1+1=6 -> a+b=4, and gcd(a,b)=1.\n          We can choose a=1, b=3 -> then gcd(1,3)=1 -> works? \n          So (1,3,1,1) -> 1+3+1+1=6.\n\n      But the problem says: positive integers, and 1,3,1,1 are positive.\n\n      However, the sample for n=7: (2,2,2,1) -> x=2.\n\n      How about n=2 mod 4? \n\n      We can try:\n\n          Option 1: set x=1.

Then a=1, b=n-3, then gcd(1, n-3)=1. \n          But then the numbers: 1, n-3, 1, 1 -> and the sum: 1 + (n-3) + 1 + 1 = n. \n          But we require positive: so n-3 must be at least 1 -> n>=4, which is true.\n\n          However, for n=6: 1, 6-3=3, 1, 1 -> [1,3,1,1] -> works.\n\n          But what if n=10: we have 1,7,1,1 -> but the sample used (3,5,1,1).

Actually, we set x=2, and we have lcm(2,2)=2.\n\n            But gcd(2, n-6) might be greater than 2? \n            For example, n=6: then b=0 -> invalid (positive integers) -> but n=6: then n-6=0 -> invalid.\n\n          So we require n-6>=1 -> n>=7? but n%4==2: the smallest n is 6 -> so n=6 is not covered.\n\n      Therefore, for n=6 we must use the (1,3,1,1) solution.\n\n      How about n=10: \n          using (2,10-6,2,2) = (2,4,2,2) -> \n          gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> works.\n\n      But n=6: we cannot use (2,0,2,2) -> invalid.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if n>=10? \n          But the problem says n>=4, and n%4==2: n=6,10,14,...\n\n      We can do:\n\n          if n==6:\n              print(1,3,1,1,end=' ')\n          else:\n              print(2, n-6, 2, 2, end=' ')\n\n      But the problem says: the total test cases t up to 10000, and n up to 10^9, so we cannot check n==6 for every n%4==2? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the solution (1, n-3, 1, 1) for all n%4==2.\n\n      Why not? It works for n=6,10,14, etc.\n\n      But let's test n=10: \n          (1,7,1,1): \n            gcd(1,7)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n      And the problem does not require minimal x or anything.\n\n      However, the sample outputs for other cases use numbers that are not ones in the first two. \n\n      But the problem says: \"you can output any of them\".\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      But wait: the sample for n=10 in the problem note is (3,5,1,1) -> which is different.\n\n      The problem does not require a specific one.\n\n      However, the existing code for n%4==1 and n%4==3 uses a pattern that avoids having three ones? \n\n      We can try to find a solution that uses larger numbers.\n\n      How about: \n          We set x = 1, but we can also set x = k for any k? \n\n      Another idea: \n          We set a = n-6, b=2, c=2, d=2 -> then a+b+c+d = n, and we require gcd(a,2)=? and lcm(2,2)=2.\n          So we require gcd(n-6,2)=2 -> which means n-6 must be even? and divisible by 2 but not necessarily by 4? \n          Actually, gcd(n-6,2)=2 if n-6 is even and not divisible by 4? No: gcd(6,2)=2? 6 is divisible by 2 -> gcd(6,2)=2. \n          Actually, gcd(any even number, 2)=2.\n\n          But then we require n-6 to be at least 1? -> n>=7.\n\n          So for n>=7 and n%4==2, we can do: (n-6,2,2,2) -> \n            Example n=10: (4,2,2,2) -> gcd(4,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> works.\n\n          But for n=6: (0,2,2,2) -> invalid.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if n==6:\n              print(1,3,1,1,end=' ')\n          else:\n              print(2, n-6, 2, 2, end=' ')   # but wait, we did (n-6,2,2,2) above? \n          But the order: the problem does not specify the order of a,b,c,d? \n\n          The condition: gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). \n\n          In (2, n-6, 2, 2): \n            gcd(2, n-6)=2 (because n-6 is even) and lcm(2,2)=2 -> works.\n\n          But note: the sample for n=10: (2,4,2,2) -> works.\n\n      However, the problem note for n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> which is different.\n\n      But the problem says: \"you can output any\".\n\n      But the current code for other cases prints in the order: a, b, c, d.\n\n      We can do for n%4==2: \n          if n==6:\n              print(1,3,1,1,end=' ')\n          else:\n              print(2, n-6, 2, 2, end=' ')\n\n      But note: the problem says n>=4, and n%4==2: the smallest n is 6, then 10,14,...\n\n      Alternatively, we can avoid the if by using:\n\n          We can set: \n            a = 1\n            b = 3   # for n=6: then 1+3+1+1=6.\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n          But for n>6: we want to use a different formula.\n\n      But we want a uniform solution.\n\n      How about: \n          a = 1\n          b = n-3\n          c = 1\n          d = 1\n\n      This works for all n>=4? \n          For n=6: 1,3,1,1 -> works.\n          For n=10: 1,7,1,1 -> works.\n\n      But the problem note for n=10 uses (3,5,1,1) -> which is also valid.\n\n      Why did the existing code for n%4==1 use (m,2*m,m,1)? \n          For n=5: m=1 -> (1,2,1,1) -> but we could have done (1,2,1,1) as well? \n\n      But they did not use (1, n-3, 1, 1) for n%4==1? \n\n      They used a different idea.\n\n      However, the problem does not require a specific solution.\n\n      But the sample output for n=10 in the problem note is (3,5,1,1) -> which has the ones at the end.\n\n      Our solution (1, n-3, 1, 1) has the ones at the end as well.\n\n      And for n%4==1: they did (m, 2*m, m, 1) -> the last is 1.\n\n      For n%4==3: (2, 4*m-2, 2, 1) -> the last is 1.\n\n      So for consistency, we can use (1, n-3, 1, 1) for n%4==2.\n\n      But note: the first number is 1, and the second is n-3, which might be very large (n up to 10^9) -> but that is acceptable.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          elif n % 4 == 2:\n              print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      However, let me check the example n=6: \n          prints: 1, 6-3=3, 1, 1 -> (1,3,1,1) -> works.\n\n      n=10: (1,7,1,1) -> works.\n\n      But the problem note for n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> which is different, but acceptable.\n\n      However, the problem note for n=10 says: \n          \"In the fifth test case gcd(3,5)=lcm(1,1)=1\"\n\n      So they used (3,5,1,1). \n\n      But our solution (1,7,1,1) also works.\n\n      But the problem says: \"you can output any\".\n\n      However, the existing code for n%4==0 and n%4==1 and n%4==3 does not use 1 for the first number necessarily? \n\n      For n%4==0: the first number is m (which is at least 1) but not necessarily 1.\n      For n%4==1: the first number is m (which is at least 1) -> for n=5, m=1 -> first number=1.\n      For n%4==3: the first number is 2.\n\n      So it varies.\n\n      Therefore, we can output (1, n-3, 1, 1) for n%4==2.\n\n      But wait: the problem says \"positive integers\", and n-3 might be 1? \n          For n=4: not in this branch.\n          For n=6: 3 -> positive.\n          For n=10: 7 -> positive.\n\n      So it is valid.\n\n      However, the sample for n=10 in the problem note is (3,5,1,1) -> which has the advantage that the numbers are closer? \n\n      But we are not required to.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do as the problem note for n=10: \n          We can set: \n            a = 3\n            b = n-5   # because 3 + (n-5) + 1 + 1 = n\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n          Then we require gcd(3, n-5)=1. \n          This is true if n-5 is not divisible by 3? \n          But if n-5 is divisible by 3, then gcd=3, and we require lcm(1,1)=1 -> 3 != 1 -> fails.\n\n      For example, n=8: 8%4=0 -> not in this branch.\n      n=11: 11%4=3 -> not in this branch.\n      n=14: 14%4=2 -> then b=14-5=9 -> gcd(3,9)=3 -> fails.\n\n      So we cannot do (3, n-5, 1, 1) for all n%4==2.\n\n      Therefore, the safe solution is (1, n-3, 1, 1).\n\n      But note: the problem says: \"positive integers\", and n-3>=1 because n>=6 -> so n-3>=3? no, n=6 -> 3, n=10->7, so it's at least 3.\n\n      So we do:\n\n          elif n % 4 == 2:\n              print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      However, the existing code for n%4==1 uses:\n\n          print(m, 2*m, m, 1, end=' ')\n\n      and for n%4==3:\n\n          print(2, 4*m-2, 2, 1, end=' ')\n\n      Note: in the n%4==3 case, they use 2 and 1 at the end.\n\n      We are using 1 and 1 at the end for n%4==2.\n\n      But the last number is always 1 in the non-divisible-by-4 cases? \n\n      For n%4==1: last number is 1.\n      For n%4==2: last number is 1.\n      For n%4==3: last number is 1.\n\n      So it is consistent.\n\n      Therefore, we complete program2.py for the n%4==2 case with:\n\n          print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      But wait: the problem says \"positive integers\", and we are using 1, n-3, 1, 1 -> all positive for n>=6.\n\n      So we write:\n\n          elif n % 4 == 2:\n              print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      However, note the sample n=10: \n          Our output: 1,7,1,1 -> but the problem note example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). \n          The problem says: \"In the fifth test case\" -> which is n=10? \n          But the fifth test case in the problem note is n=10, and they output (3,5,1,1). \n\n      But the problem does not require a specific solution.\n\n      We output the code accordingly.\n\n      But note: the problem note for the fourth test case: n=9 -> output (2,4,2,1) -> which is the n%4==1 case? \n          9%4=1 -> so they use: \n              m = 9//4 = 2 (since 9//4=2 in integer division) -> then output: m=2, 2*m=4, m=2, 1 -> (2,4,2,1) -> matches.\n\n      And the fifth test case: n=10 -> n%4=2 -> we output (1,7,1,1) -> but the problem note says (3,5,1,1). \n\n      However, the problem says: \"If there are several possible answers you can output any of them.\"\n\n      So both are acceptable.\n\n      Therefore, we complete the two programs.\n\n      Summary:\n\n        program1.py: \n          In the else block: \n              a += l.popleft()\n\n        program2.py:\n          In the elif n%4==2 block:\n              print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      We output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n      Note: the program2.py code has a print(sep='') at the end? \n          Actually, the last line: \n              print(sep='')\n\n          This is equivalent to print(flush=True, sep='')? But it will print an empty line? \n\n          Actually, the previous print has end=' ', so we have a space at the end. Then we print an empty line? \n\n          But the problem requires: for each test case, output 4 integers.\n\n          The sample outputs for the test cases are:\n\n            n=4: \"1 1 1 1\"\n            n=5: \"1 2 1 1\"\n            n=6: \"1 3 1 1\"\n            n=7: \"2 2 2 1\"   -> but wait, n=7: 7%4=3 -> so they output: (2, 4*m-2, 2, 1) -> m=7//4=1 -> 4*1-2=2 -> \"2 2 2 1\"\n\n          But the last print(sep='') will add a newline? \n\n          Actually, the print function: \n              print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ') -> outputs without a newline at the end, but with a space.\n              then print(sep='') -> outputs a newline? \n\n          But note: the default for print is end='\\n'. So print(sep='') will output a newline.\n\n          And then the next test case will start on a new line.\n\n          But the previous print for the test case ended with a space and then we do a newline? \n\n          The problem does not specify the formatting, but the sample outputs are one per line.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"For each test case output 4 positive integers\"\n\n          So we can output the four integers in one line? \n\n          The current code for the other cases: \n              if n%4==0: print(m,m,m,m,end=' ') -> then a space at the end, and then a newline from the next print(sep='').\n\n          But we want one line per test case.\n\n          The print(sep='') will output a newline. So the entire output for one test case is:\n\n              [output of the four numbers with a space at the end] and then a newline.\n\n          But the space at the end is acceptable.\n\n          Alternatively, we can change the end for the last print? \n\n          But the problem does not specify.\n\n          We'll leave as is.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code:\n\n        program1: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n        program2: \"print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n\n      But note: in program2, the line after the if-else chain is: print(sep='') -> which we are not changing.\n\n      We output the JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n            \"program2\": \"print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n          }\n\n      However, the program2 code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" in the elif n%4==2 block, and we are replacing that with the print statement.\n\n      But the code after the if-else has a print(sep='') which prints a newline.\n\n      This matches the other cases.\n\n      We are done."
