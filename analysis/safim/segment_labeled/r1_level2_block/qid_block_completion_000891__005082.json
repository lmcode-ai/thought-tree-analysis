So for each occurrence of the same entire string, we have to subtract 2 times the count of that string? But note: the current string is being processed. The variable 'c' is being updated in a way that for the first occurrence of a string, we set c[d+e]=0 and then add 2? Then for the next occurrence, we subtract the current c[d+e] (which is 0 for the first time, then 2 for the next, then 4, etc) and then add 2 to it. Let me simulate with two identical strings \"aa\":\n\nFirst string \"aa\":\n   a['a'] doesn't exist -> so we do: (in the except for a) we set a['a']=1? but the code for the except block is missing. Similarly, for the first string, we get to the except block for a: we must set a[d] = 1? and then for b: we set b['a']=1? and then for c: we set c['aa']=0 and then add 2 -> becomes 2. Second string \"aa\":\n   a['a'] exists: so we do ans += a['a'] -> ans = 1, then a['a'] becomes 2. b['a'] exists: so we do ans += b['a'] -> ans = 1+1 = 2, then b['a'] becomes 2. Then we check c: 'aa' is in c -> so we do ans -= c['aa'] -> ans = 2 - 2 = 0, then c['aa'] becomes 2+2=4. But the expected for two identical strings: there should be 0 pairs that differ in exactly one position? so 0 is correct. But what about two different strings that share the same first character? Example: \"ab\" and \"ac\"\nFirst string \"ab\":\n   a['a'] -> except: set a['a']=1\n   b['b'] -> except: set b['b']=1\n   c['ab'] -> set to 0 then add 2 -> becomes 2.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\nThe provided code uses three dictionaries: a, b, and c.\n- Dictionary 'a' counts the frequency of the first character.\n- Dictionary 'b' counts the frequency of the second character.\n- Dictionary 'c' counts the frequency of the entire string.\n\nThe idea is to use inclusion-exclusion:\nTotal pairs that differ in the first character only: we can count pairs that have the same second character? But note the approach:\n\nThe current code does:\n  For each string (d, e):\n      ans += a[d]   -> This adds the count of strings that have the same first character (so that the second character must be different? but note: we are adding the current count of the first character, which includes all strings with the same first character, but then we subtract the ones that are the same string?).\n\nBut note: the problem says exactly one position must differ.\n\nWe can think of two types of pairs:\n1. The first character is the same and the second character differs.\n2. The second character is the same and the first character differs.\n\nHowever, the current code does:\n  ans += a[d]   -> This would count all previous strings that have the same first character. But that includes the ones that have the same entire string? and also the ones that have the same first character but different second? Actually, we want to count the pairs that have the same first character (so that the second character is different) but then we also have to avoid counting the pairs that are identical? Actually, identical pairs are not counted because we are adding a[d] which is the count of previous strings with the same first character. But that includes the same entire string? \n\nBut then we also do:\n  ans += b[e]   -> This counts the previous strings with the same second character.\n\nBut then we subtract:\n  if the entire string d+e is already in c, then we subtract c[d+e] (and then we do c[d+e] += 2?).\n\nActually, the current approach is:\n  We are overcounting the pairs that are identical? Actually, no. Because we are counting:\n    - The pairs that have the same first character: this includes the pairs that have the same entire string? and also the ones that have the same first and different second? But we want exactly one position to differ. So if two strings are identical, then they don't have exactly one position differing (they have zero). Also, if two strings have both characters different, then they are not counted in either a[d] or b[e]? \n\nBut wait: \n  We are adding a[d] for the same first character -> that gives pairs that have the same first character (so the second character can be same or different? but we are going to subtract the ones that are the same entire string?).\n\nThen we add b[e] for the same second character -> that gives pairs that have the same second character (so the first character can be same or different?).\n\nBut then we subtract twice the entire string? Actually, we subtract the count of the entire string? \n\nBut note: the entire string d+e: if we have seen the same string before, then we subtract c[d+e] (which is the current count of that string? but then we set c[d+e] to 0 initially and then we do c[d+e] += 2?).\n\nActually, the code does:\n  For a new string (d,e):\n      If we have seen the same first character in a previous string, then we add the count of such strings (a[d]) to ans. Then we update a[d] by adding 1.\n      Similarly, we add the count of the same second character (b[e]) to ans, and update b[e].\n      Then we check the entire string: if we have seen the entire string before, then we subtract the current count of the entire string (c[d+e])? and then we update c[d+e] by adding 2? \n\nBut wait, the update of c is: \n      if d+e not in c: \n          c[d+e] = 0\n      else:\n          ans -= c[d+e]\n      c[d+e] += 2\n\nThis doesn't look right. Actually, we should subtract the count of the same entire string because when we added a[d] we included the same entire string? and similarly for b[e]. \n\nBut note: the same entire string would have been counted twice: once in a[d] and once in b[e]. So we subtract the same entire string twice? But we don't want to subtract the same entire string at all because we don't want to count identical pairs? Actually, we don't want to count the identical pairs in the first place? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a different approach:\n\nWe can count:\n  total pairs that have the same first character: then they differ in the second character? -> but that would be the case only if the second character is different? Actually, no: if they have the same first character, then the pair might have the same second character (then they are identical) or different. We only want the ones that have the same first character and different second character? \n\nSimilarly, the pairs that have the same second character and different first character.\n\nBut then we have overcounted? Actually, no: because a pair that has both characters different is not counted in either.\n\nSo the total pairs that differ in exactly one position = \n   (number of pairs with same first character) - (number of pairs that are identical) \n   + (number of pairs with same second character) - (number of pairs that are identical)\n\nBut wait, we subtracted the identical pairs twice? So we have to add them back? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n   total = (pairs with same first character) + (pairs with same second character) - 2*(pairs that are identical)\n\nBut note: the identical pairs are included in both the same first and same second. So we subtract twice the identical pairs? \n\nBut the problem: we don't want the identical pairs at all? Actually, the identical pairs are not desired because they don't have exactly one difference? So we want to remove them.\n\nBut the current code does:\n   ans += a[d]   -> which is the count of previous strings with the same first character (including the identical ones? because if we have two identical strings, then the first character is the same and the second character is the same? so they are included in a[d] and also in b[e]?).\n\nThen we do:\n   ans += b[e]   -> same second character.\n\nThen we subtract: if we have seen the same entire string, then we subtract the current count of that entire string? and then we update the entire string by adding 2? \n\nBut why 2? \n\nActually, the subtraction: \n   We have overcounted the identical pairs: each identical pair was counted twice (once in a[d] and once in b[e]). So for each occurrence of the same entire string, we have to subtract 2 times the count of that string? \n\nBut note: the current string is being processed. The variable 'c' is being updated in a way that for the first occurrence of a string, we set c[d+e]=0 and then add 2? Then for the next occurrence, we subtract the current c[d+e] (which is 0 for the first time, then 2 for the next, then 4, etc) and then add 2 to it.\n\nLet me simulate with two identical strings \"aa\":\n\nFirst string \"aa\":\n   a['a'] doesn't exist -> so we do: (in the except for a) we set a['a']=1? but the code for the except block is missing.\n\nSimilarly, for the first string, we get to the except block for a: we must set a[d] = 1? and then for b: we set b['a']=1? and then for c: we set c['aa']=0 and then add 2 -> becomes 2.\n\nSecond string \"aa\":\n   a['a'] exists: so we do ans += a['a'] -> ans = 1, then a['a'] becomes 2.\n   b['a'] exists: so we do ans += b['a'] -> ans = 1+1 = 2, then b['a'] becomes 2.\n   Then we check c: 'aa' is in c -> so we do ans -= c['aa'] -> ans = 2 - 2 = 0, then c['aa'] becomes 2+2=4.\n\nBut the expected for two identical strings: there should be 0 pairs that differ in exactly one position? so 0 is correct.\n\nBut what about two different strings that share the same first character? \nExample: \"ab\" and \"ac\"\nFirst string \"ab\":\n   a['a'] -> except: set a['a']=1\n   b['b'] -> except: set b['b']=1\n   c['ab'] -> set to 0 then add 2 -> becomes 2.\n\nSecond string \"ac\":\n   a['a'] exists: ans += 1 -> ans=1, then a['a'] becomes 2.\n   b['c'] -> except: set b['c']=1 -> so no addition to ans.\n   c['ac'] -> not in c: set to 0 then add 2 -> becomes 2.\n\nSo we have ans=1, which is correct.\n\nBut what about a pair that has both different? \nExample: \"ab\" and \"cd\": \n   For \"ab\": as above.\n   For \"cd\": \n        a['c'] -> except: set a['c']=1 -> no addition.\n        b['d'] -> except: set b['d']=1 -> no addition.\n        c['cd'] -> set to 0 then add 2 -> becomes 2.\n   Then ans remains 0 -> correct.\n\nNow, what about a pair that has the same second character but different first? \nExample: \"ab\" and \"cb\":\n   First \"ab\": as above.\n   Second \"cb\":\n        a['c'] -> except: set a['c']=1 -> no addition.\n        b['b'] -> exists: ans += b['b'] -> which is 1 -> ans=1.\n        c['cb'] -> not in c: set to 0 then add 2 -> becomes 2.\n   So we get 1 -> correct.\n\nBut then we have a problem: the pair (\"ab\", \"ac\") is counted once (from the first character) and the pair (\"ab\", \"cb\") is counted once (from the second character). \n\nSo the code is counting:\n   - The pairs that share the same first character (which includes the ones that are identical and the ones that have the same first and different second) -> but then we subtract the identical ones by twice the count? \n\nActually, the subtraction is done for each occurrence: we subtract the current value of c[d+e] (which is 2 * (count of the same string so far?)). \n\nBut why 2? \n\nLet me see: for the same entire string, we are subtracting the current value of c[d+e] and then adding 2 to c[d+e]. \n\nThe initial value for a new string is set to 0 and then we add 2 -> so the next time we see the same string, we subtract 0? but wait, the first time we set c[d+e]=0 and then we do c[d+e] += 2 -> becomes 2.\n\nThen the next time we see the same string, we subtract 2 (the current value) and then add 2 to it -> becomes 4.\n\nThen the next time we see the same string, we subtract 4 and then add 2 -> becomes 6.\n\nSo the subtraction is: for the k-th occurrence of the same string, we subtract 2*(k-1) because the previous value was 2*(k-1). \n\nBut why 2*(k-1)? \n\nNote: the identical pairs: if we have k occurrences of the same string, then the number of identical pairs that we have overcounted is: for each new occurrence, we have to subtract the overcount for the pairs that are formed with the previous identical strings? \n\nBut note: when we add a string, we are adding the count of previous strings with the same first character and the same second character? and then we subtract the identical pairs? \n\nActually, the overcount for a new occurrence of the same string is: \n   It was counted in a[d] (which is the count of previous strings with the same first character) and in b[e] (same second). So we have counted it twice? and we want to remove the pairs that are formed by the new string and each of the previous identical strings? because those pairs are identical? and we don't want to count them? \n\nBut wait: we are counting pairs that have the same first character: that includes the identical ones? and we don't want the identical ones? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n   The total pairs that have the same first character (ignoring the second) is C(count_first, 2) for each first character? but we are not doing that.\n\nThe current code is doing an online count: for each new string, we add the count of previous strings that have the same first character (which is the number of pairs that the new string forms with all previous strings that have the same first character) and similarly for the second.\n\nBut then we subtract the pairs that are identical? because we have overcounted: the identical pairs were counted in both a[d] and b[e]? so we subtract twice the number of previous identical strings? \n\nBut the code subtracts the current value of c[d+e] (which is 2 * (the current count of the same string?)) and then we update c[d+e] by adding 2? \n\nActually, the value in c[d+e] is 2 * (the number of previous occurrences of the same string). Why? \n   First occurrence: we set c[d+e]=0 and then add 2 -> becomes 2? but that doesn't look like the count.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the code to:\n\n   Instead of subtracting c[d+e] and then adding 2, we could subtract 2 * (the count of the same string so far) and then update the count by 1? but then we are storing 2*(count) in c? \n\nBut the code does: \n   if d+e not in c:\n        c[d+e] = 0\n   else:\n        ans -= c[d+e]\n   c[d+e] += 2\n\nSo for the first occurrence: c[d+e] becomes 2.\nFor the second occurrence: we subtract 2 (which is the current value) and then set c[d+e] = 2+2 = 4.\nFor the third: we subtract 4 and then set to 6.\n\nSo the subtraction for the k-th occurrence (k>=2) is 2*(k-1). \n\nBut how many identical pairs are we forming? When we add the k-th occurrence, we form (k-1) new identical pairs? and each identical pair was overcounted by 2 (because it was counted in a[d] and in b[e]). So we subtract 2*(k-1). \n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the missing part in program1.py is the except block for the first dictionary 'a'. We see that for the second dictionary 'b', the except block sets the key to 1. Similarly, we should set the key for 'a' to 1.\n\nSo for the except block for 'a', we do:\n   a[d] = 1\n\nBut note: the code for the except block for 'a' is missing. We have:\n\n   try:\n        ans += a[d]\n        a[d] += 1\n   except KeyError:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should set a[d] = 1 in the except.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is: \n   a[d] = 1\n\nBut note: the code for the except block for 'b' is already present: \n   try:\n        ans += b[e]\n        b[e] += 1\n   except KeyError:\n        b[e] = 1\n\nSo we do the same for 'a'.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing line is: \n   a[d] = 1\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are counting the number of trees (with a specific structure: vertex i (for i>=2) is connected to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) such that vertex i is the centroid.\n\nThe provided code does:\n\n   MOD = 998244353\n\n   We have a function modmul to be defined? It should do modular multiplication and also handle an optional third argument? \n\n   The function modmul is defined as:\n        def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   Then we have precomputation of factorials and inverse factorials.\n\n   Then we have:\n        n = int(input())\n        out = [0] * n\n\n        for i in range((n+1)//2):\n            base = fact[n-1]\n            frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))\n            out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n        Then we do:\n            rem = 0\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                oldrem = rem\n                rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n                out[i] -= oldrem\n                rem %= MOD\n                out[i] %= MOD\n\n        Then print the array.\n\nWe need to define modmul. The function is called with two or three arguments? The third argument is optional and defaults to 0.\n\nLooking at the calls:\n   modmul(x, y) -> two arguments: we should compute (x * y) % MOD.\n   modmul(x, y, c) -> three arguments: what does that do? \n\nBut in the code, we see:\n   modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))   -> two arguments.\n\n   modmul(i, fact[i-1]) -> two arguments.\n\n   modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)) -> two arguments.\n\n   modmul(base, frac) -> two arguments.\n\n   modmul(out[i], invs(i)) -> two arguments.\n\nBut then we also see:\n   modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1]) -> two arguments.\n\nSo we don't see a call with three arguments? \n\nBut the function signature has c=0. So we can ignore the third argument? \n\nBut note: the function name modmul might imply modular multiplication. We can do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut wait, what if we are called with three arguments? The third argument is c. The function is called with two arguments in the code, so c will be 0. Then we do (x * y) % MOD, and then we have an extra 0? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the function is intended to multiply three numbers? But the calls are with two. \n\nLooking at the code: there is no call with three arguments. So we can ignore the third argument? \n\nBut the function is defined with an optional third argument. We can do:\n\n   if c == 0:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n   else:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut that would be incorrect because the function is called with two arguments and we want to multiply two numbers. And if we are called with three, we multiply three? \n\nBut the code doesn't call with three. So we can simply do:\n\n   return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function is called modmul, and we are in a modular arithmetic context. We must do modulo multiplication.\n\nHowever, the problem says the answer can be huge, so we do modulo MOD.\n\nBut wait: the function is called with two arguments, and we have an optional third. We can define:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut that would break if we ever pass 0 as the third argument? because 0 is the default and we use it to mean two-argument. But if we pass c=0, then we do two-argument? \n\nBut note: the function is called only with two arguments. So we can also define it without the third argument? but the signature says c=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   def modmul(*args):\n        res = 1\n        for a in args:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        return res\n\nBut the problem: the function is called with two or three arguments? but we only see two. However, the function signature has three. But the code only uses two. \n\nBut note: the function invs(x) is defined as:\n        return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\nThat's two arguments.\n\nAnd comb(x,y) is defined as:\n        return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\nHere the inner modmul has two arguments, and the outer has two: fact[x] and the result of the inner modmul.\n\nSo we are safe to define modmul for two arguments? but the function is defined to take two or three? \n\nBut the problem: the function is called with two arguments. The third argument is optional and we don't use it. So we can ignore it? \n\nBut the function signature has three parameters. We must handle the third? \n\nWe can do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut that would be incorrect if we ever pass a non-zero third argument? but we don't.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=1):   # but the default is 0? we cannot change the default.\n\nThe problem: the function is called with two arguments, so c=0. Then we do (x * y * 0) % MOD? that would be 0. That is wrong.\n\nSo we must change: we want to multiply two numbers when c=0? but 0 is the multiplicative annihilator. \n\nAlternatively, we can interpret: if c is provided and non-zero, then multiply by c? but the default is 0, which we don't want to multiply.\n\nBut the function is called only with two arguments. So we can ignore the third? \n\nBut the function signature is fixed? we cannot change it? \n\nLooking at the problem: we are to complete the code. We are allowed to change only the missing part? \n\nBut the function modmul is defined with three parameters. We must write the body accordingly.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\nBut note: the function is called with two arguments: then c=0, so we do (x*y) % MOD.\n\nIf called with three, then we do (x*y*c) % MOD.\n\nBut the code does not call with three. So we can do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut that is essentially the same.\n\nBut note: the function might be called with three arguments? but we don't see it. However, the problem says to complete the code so that the entire program runs correctly. Since we don't see a call with three, we can do either.\n\nBut the problem: the function is defined with an optional third argument. We must handle the case when it is provided? \n\nWe'll do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut wait: what if we are called with three arguments? The code doesn't do that, but the function signature allows it. We are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res *= c\n        return res % MOD\n\nBut modulo arithmetic: we can do modulo at the end? but the numbers might be huge? but we are using Python integers and then modulo at the end is acceptable? \n\nBut the numbers can be as large as (10^6)! which is huge? but we are doing modulo 998244353, so we can do:\n\n   return (x * y) % MOD   if c==0, else (x * y % MOD) * c % MOD\n\nBut to avoid huge intermediates, we can do:\n\n   if c == 0:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n   else:\n        return (x * y) % MOD * c % MOD\n\nBut note: the multiplication of three numbers: we can do (x * y * c) % MOD, but we can break it down to avoid overflow? but in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, but modulo 998244353 is 9-digit, so the product of three numbers might be huge? but we can do:\n\n   return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut we don't know the size? but the modulus is 998244353, and the numbers are less than the modulus? so the product of three numbers is at most (998244353-1)^3, which is about 1e27? which is acceptable in Python? but we can do modulo step by step.\n\nBut the problem: the modulus is 998244353, and we can do:\n\n   return (x * y) % MOD * c % MOD\n\nBut that is the same as (x * y * c) % MOD.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   if c == 0:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n   else:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function is called with two arguments, so c=0. So we only do two-argument multiplication.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut wait: what if we are called with three arguments? The code doesn't do that, but the function signature allows it. We are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can write a more general version:\n\n   def modmul(*args):\n        res = 1\n        for a in args:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        return res\n\nBut the function signature in the code is fixed: it has three parameters with the third having a default. We cannot change the signature? \n\nThe problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". And the code provided has:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n\nSo we must keep the signature.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n   if c:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n   else:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut note: c might be 0? then we do two-argument. But if c is non-zero, we do three. \n\nBut the default is 0, so when called with two arguments, c=0 -> we do two-argument.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is the body of modmul.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n   program1: the missing line is \"a[d] = 1\"\n   program2: the missing function body is as above.\n\nBut note: the output format is JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nWe must output the exact code string for the missing parts.\n\nFor program1: the missing part is the entire except block? but the except block currently has a comment and we are to replace the TODO. The existing code for the except block for 'a' is:\n\n   except KeyError:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO line with the code? but note: the code for the except block for 'b' is:\n\n   except KeyError:\n        b[e] = 1\n\nSo we do the same: we set a[d] = 1.\n\nSo the missing code for program1 is: \n        a[d] = 1\n\nBut note: the indentation. The existing code is indented by 4 or 8? The try block is indented by 4 (relative to the for loop). The except block should be at the same level.\n\nSo we write: \"a[d] = 1\"\n\nFor program2: the missing code for modmul is the entire body? the function body is:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the body.\n\nWe write: \n        if c != 0:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut we can also write without else:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the modulus is MOD (which is 998244353).\n\nBut the problem: the function might be called with c=0? then we do two-argument. Otherwise, three.\n\nBut the function is called only with two arguments? but we write the general one.\n\nSo the missing code for program2 is the body of modmul.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        a[d] = 1\", \"program2\": \"    if c == 0:\\n        return (x * y) % MOD\\n    else:\\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\"}\n\nBut note: the indentation in program2: the function body is indented by 4 spaces? The existing code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nIn the provided program2.py, the function modmul is defined and then the next line is indented by 4. So we write the body with 4-space indentation.\n\nBut the function body we are writing: we have to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\nBut that is also acceptable.\n\nWe choose the first version for clarity.\n\nBut note: the function is called with two arguments, so we can ignore the three-argument case? but we must handle the signature.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n        if c:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut c might be 0? then we do two-argument. But if c is non-zero, we do three. However, what if c is 0? then we do two-argument. But the default is 0, so that's correct.\n\nBut note: the function might be called with c=0? then we do two-argument. But also, if called with c=1, we do three-argument? \n\nBut the code doesn't call with three, so it doesn't matter.\n\nWe'll write:\n\n        if c:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut that is shorter.\n\nBut the problem: what if c is 0? then we skip the if and do the return. But if c is non-zero, we do the if. \n\nBut the default is 0, so when called with two arguments, c=0 -> we do the two-argument.\n\nSo we can write that.\n\nBut to be safe for the case when c is 0, we do:\n\n        if c != 0:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut we can also write without else.\n\nWe choose:\n\n        if c != 0:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nBut note: the string must be escaped? but the problem says: output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And we are to output in JSON.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"        a[d] = 1\", \"program2\": \"    if c != 0:\\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\\n    return (x * y) % MOD\"}\n\nBut the indentation for program2: the function body is at the same level as the function definition? The function definition is:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the body should be indented by 4 spaces? So we write the body with 4-space indentation. But in the string, we represent the newline and the indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire body as a string with newlines.\n\nBut the problem: the missing code for program1 is one line? but the existing code has 8 spaces of indentation? because it is inside two loops: the for i and for j.\n\nThe program1 code:\n\nfor i in range(int(input())): \n    n= int(input())\n    a = dict()\n    b = dict()\n    c = dict()\n    ans = 0\n    for j in range(n):\n        d,e = str(input())\n        try:\n            ans += a[d]\n            a[d] += 1\n        except KeyError:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe except block is at the same level as the try block, which is 8 spaces (two indents). So the code we put should be at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the existing code for the except block for 'b' is:\n\n        try:\n            ans += b[e]\n            b[e] += 1\n        except KeyError:\n            b[e] = 1\n\nSo the line in the except block for 'b' is at 12 spaces? \n\nTherefore, for program1, the missing line is: \"            b[e] = 1\" for the 'b' dictionary. Similarly, for the 'a' dictionary, we want: \"            a[d] = 1\"\n\nBut the code we are to write for the except block of 'a' is:\n\n        except KeyError:\n            a[d] = 1\n\nSo the missing code is two lines? or one? \n\nActually, the existing code for the except block for 'a' is:\n\n        except KeyError:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO line? but we can write one line: \"a[d] = 1\" at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\nBut the comment is at 12 spaces? \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is: \"            a[d] = 1\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the function body: we are replacing the TODO line? but the function body is one or more lines. We write:\n\n    if c != 0:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut the function body must be indented by 4 spaces relative to the function definition? \n\nThe function definition is:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the body we write should be at 4-space indentation. So:\n\n    if c != 0:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut the first line is at 4 spaces, the next two at 8? \n\nBut the existing code in the rest of the program uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nSo we write:\n\n    if c != 0:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut we can also write:\n\n    if c != 0:\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\n    else:\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut that is two more lines? \n\nWe choose the first.\n\nTherefore, the final output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            a[d] = 1\", \"program2\": \"    if c != 0:\\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\\n    return (x * y) % MOD\"}\n\nBut note: the program2 code has a function body that is three lines? we must represent the newline as \\n.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire body as a string with embedded newlines.\n\nBut the problem: the output is JSON, so we must escape the newline as \\n.\n\nSo we do that.\n\nBut wait: the program1 code: the missing line is exactly \"            a[d] = 1\" (with 12 spaces). But the existing code for the except block for 'b' is:\n\n            b[e] = 1\n\nSo we are consistent.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON."
