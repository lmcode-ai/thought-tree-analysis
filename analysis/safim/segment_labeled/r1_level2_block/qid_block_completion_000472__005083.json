  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the smallest integer d (minimum days) such that AmShZ and Keshi can meet in city n (index n-1) within d days.\n\nThe approach uses a Dijkstra-like algorithm on the reversed graph (iadj). The key idea is to compute the cost (which represents the minimum days required) for each node to reach node n-1.\n\nIn the provided code:\n- We have an inverted adjacency list `iadj` which for a node u, stores the incoming edges (v -> u) and the count of such edges (since there can be multiple roads from v to u).\n- `nadj` is initially the out-degree of each node (in the original graph). However, note that in the inverted graph, we are storing incoming edges. But in the original graph, `nadj[v]` is set to the number of outgoing edges from v? Actually, we are building `nadj` as the out-degree in the original graph? Let's see:\n\nIn the input loop:\n  For each road (v, u): \n      We add an entry in `iadj[u]` for v (so u has an incoming edge from v).\n      We do: `nadj[v] += 1` -> so `nadj[v]` is the original out-degree of v.\n\nBut note: the graph is directed and we are building the reversed graph for the backward BFS.\n\nThe algorithm:\n  We start from the destination (n-1) with cost 0.\n  We use a priority queue (min-heap) to do a Dijkstra.\n\nFor a node v, we consider all nodes u that have an edge to v (i.e., in the original graph, u has an edge to v? Actually, in the reversed graph, we are going backwards: from v we look at u such that there is an edge from u to v in the original graph, meaning in the reversed graph we have an edge from v to u? Actually, the reversed graph we built is for the original graph: `iadj` for a node u stores the nodes v that have an edge to u? But we built it as: for an edge (v, u) we add to `iadj[u]` an entry for v. So in the reversed graph, we can traverse from u to v? Actually, we are building the reversed graph so that from the destination we can go backwards.\n\nHowever, in the algorithm, we are iterating for u in `iadj[v]` meaning: in the original graph, there is an edge from u to v? Then in the reversed graph, we are going from v to u.\n\nThe update condition is:\n  cost[u] = min(cost[u], cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1)   ??? \n\nBut note: the provided code has:\n  if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n      ... then update.\n\nBut wait, the sample update condition in the problem is:\n\n  We are at node u. When we consider moving from u to v (in the original graph) we have to account for the blocking messages.\n\nActually, the problem is solved by a known solution: \n  We define dp[u] = the minimum days required to go from u to n.\n  Then for a node u, we have:\n      dp[u] = min{ dp[u], max{ dp[v] } for v in neighbors? }   -> but that's not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following known solution for \"Keshi Is Throwing a Party\":\n\n  We do a BFS from the destination (n-1) in the reversed graph (which we built as iadj). For a node u, we want to update its cost from its neighbors. However, the update is:\n\n      dp[u] = min(dp[u], dp[v] + (out_degree[u] - count_of_edges_from_u_to_nodes_with_dp_less_than_dp[v])? )\n\nBut actually, the known solution is:\n\n  We use a priority queue. For a node u, we have:\n      dp[u] = (some value) and we update the neighbors.\n\n  Specifically, when we pop a node v, we look at all u that have an edge to v (in the original graph) meaning u->v. Then we do:\n\n      We reduce the out-degree of u by the count of the edge (u->v) that we are processing? Actually, we have multiple edges? The problem says: \"there may be more than one road between a pair of cities in each direction.\"\n\n  The update condition is:\n\n      candidate = dp[v] + (out_degree[u] - (the number of edges from u that we have already processed and lead to nodes with dp <= dp[v]))? \n\nBut note: the provided code has:\n\n      nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # iadj[v][u] is the count of edges from u to v? Actually, wait: we built iadj for the destination node? \n\nActually, in the code:\n\n  We have an edge (v, u) in the input? Then we stored in `iadj[u]` an entry for v: so for node u, we have an incoming edge from v. Then we did `nadj[v] += 1` (so `nadj[v]` is the original out-degree of v).\n\nBut now, in the reversed graph, we are at node v (which in the original graph is the head of an edge from u to v? Actually, no: the reversed graph we built is for the original graph: we have an edge from u to v in the original graph, then in the reversed graph we have an edge from v to u? But we built `iadj` as: for an edge (v, u) we store in `iadj[u]` that v is connected. So to traverse backwards from v, we look at `iadj[v]`? Actually, no: we built `iadj` for each node as the incoming edges. So to get the predecessors of v in the original graph, we look at `iadj[v]`? Then the nodes in `iadj[v]` are the nodes u such that there is an edge u->v in the original graph.\n\nBut in the reversed graph, we are going from v to u? Then we are going from the destination backwards to the source.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n  We start at n-1 (destination) with cost 0.\n\n  For each neighbor u (which in the original graph has an edge to v) we do:\n\n      We remove the edges from u to v (because we are processing this edge). Then we update the cost for u as:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + (remaining out-degree of u) + 1? \n\n      Actually, the known solution is:\n\n          dp[u] = min(dp[u], dp[v] + (out_degree[u] - cnt) + 1)\n\n      where cnt is the number of edges from u that we have already processed? But in the code, we are maintaining `nadj[u]` which is the current remaining out-degree of u (we subtract the edges we process). Then we do:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n\n      Why +1? Because the day when we move from u to v: we have to account for the move. But also, AmShZ might have to block the other edges? Actually, the strategy is: AmShZ can block all the edges from u that lead to worse nodes (with higher cost) and then tell Keshi to move along the edge to v. The number of days required for u would be: \n\n          cost[u] = max( cost[v] + 1, (number of edges from u that lead to nodes with cost >= cost[v]) ) \n\n      But note: we are processing the nodes in increasing order of cost. When we process a node v, we update all its predecessors u. For a predecessor u, we subtract the count of edges from u to v (so `nadj[u]` becomes the number of edges from u that we haven't processed yet). Then we set:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + (the current out-degree of u) + 1\n\n      Why? Because the current out-degree of u (nadj[u]) is the number of edges from u that we haven't processed (which lead to nodes that we haven't visited and hence have higher cost). So AmShZ must block all those edges? Then the day when Keshi moves, he will take the edge to v. The total days would be:\n\n          cost[u] = cost[v] + 1 + (number of edges from u that lead to nodes that are not the best) \n\n      But note: the blocking messages: each day AmShZ can block one edge. So if there are k edges from u that lead to nodes that are not v (and we want to avoid), then we have to block k days? Then on the k+1-th day, we tell Keshi to move and he goes to v. Then the total days for u would be: k (blocking) + 1 (moving) = k+1, plus the days from v? But note: the blocking happens while Keshi is at u, and then the move to v, and then the days from v. So total = (k) + 1 + cost[v]? \n\n      However, we can interleave the blocking and moving? Actually, the problem says: at the beginning of each day, AmShZ sends a message. Then if he blocks, Keshi stays. If he tells to move, then Keshi moves.\n\n      The strategy: AmShZ can block one edge per day until the only remaining edge is the one to v. Then he tells to move. So the total days at u would be: (number of edges from u that are not the one to v) + 1 (for the move) + cost[v] (the days required from v). But note: the blocking can be done in parallel? Actually, no: the days are sequential. So the entire process for u would be:\n\n          days = (number of edges from u that lead to nodes with cost greater than the minimal cost) + 1 + cost[v]\n\n      However, we don't know the minimal cost? We are processing in increasing order. So when we process a node v, we know that any unprocessed edge from u (which we haven't updated) must lead to a node with cost at least as high as the current minimal we have found? \n\n      Therefore, the update:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + (current out-degree of u) + 1\n\n      Why? Because the current out-degree of u (nadj[u]) is the number of edges from u that we haven't processed (and hence lead to nodes that we haven't visited and are assumed to be worse). Then we add 1 for the move. Then we set:\n\n          cost[u] = min(cost[u], candidate)\n\n      But note: we subtract the edges we process? Actually, we subtract the edges from u to v (which we are processing) from `nadj[u]` at the beginning of the loop? Then we use the updated `nadj[u]` (which is the out-degree without the edges to v) to compute candidate.\n\n      However, the code does:\n\n          nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # subtract the count of edges from u to v? \n\n      Then candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1.\n\n      But wait: we are subtracting the edges from u to v? Then `nadj[u]` becomes the out-degree of u without the edges to v. Then candidate = cost[v] + (out_degree[u] without the edges to v) + 1.\n\n      This matches: the number of edges we have to block is (out_degree[u] without the edges to v) because we are going to use the edge to v. Then we block one per day, then one day to move, and then the cost from v.\n\n      However, what if there are multiple edges from u to v? Then we subtract all of them at once? But note: we are storing the count in `iadj[v][u]`. So we subtract all edges from u to v. Then the remaining `nadj[u]` is the out-degree of u excluding all edges to v.\n\n      Then the candidate is: cost[v] + (remaining out-degree of u) + 1.\n\n      Then we update cost[u] to be the minimum of its current value and candidate.\n\n      And then we push u into the priority queue with the candidate value.\n\n      But note: we are processing the same u multiple times? Actually, we are using a Dijkstra with a min-heap and we mark visited. So we only process each node once.\n\n      However, we are updating `nadj[u]` multiple times? Because u might have multiple neighbors v? Then we subtract the edges to each v as we process them. And then we update the candidate for u each time we process an edge from u to a node v that we pop.\n\n      But the known solution for the problem \"Keshi in Search of AmShZ\" (CodeForces) is:\n\n          dp[u] = min{ dp[u], (deg[u] - (the number of edges from u that we have processed and lead to nodes with dp <= some value)) + dp[v] + 1 }\n\n      Actually, the known solution uses:\n\n          dp[u] = min(dp[u], dp[v] + deg[u] - cnt[u] + 1)\n\n      where cnt[u] is the number of edges from u that we have processed? But in our code, we are maintaining `nadj[u]` as the current remaining out-degree (so deg[u] initially, then we subtract edges as we process them). Then:\n\n          candidate = dp[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n\n      because after we subtract the edges to v, the remaining out-degree is nadj[u]. Then the candidate is: we block the remaining nadj[u] edges (which takes nadj[u] days) and then one day to move to v, and then dp[v] days from v.\n\n      So the update is:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n\n      Then we set:\n\n          cost[u] = min(cost[u], candidate)\n\n      And then we push u with candidate.\n\n      But note: we subtract the edges from u to v at the beginning of the loop? Then we use the updated nadj[u] for candidate.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code in the while loop is:\n\n          cost[u] = candidate\n          heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n      However, we are only updating if the candidate is less than the current cost[u]. Then we push.\n\n      But note: we are using a min-heap and we mark visited. So we only process each node once? Actually, we set `visit[v]=1` when we pop. So we don't process a node twice.\n\n      But we might update the same node u multiple times? We want the minimal candidate. So we do:\n\n          if candidate < cost[u]:\n              cost[u] = candidate\n              heapq.heappush(q, (candidate, u))\n\n      However, the code already has:\n\n          if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      So we need to set cost[u] and push.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n          heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n      But note: we subtract the edges from u to v at the beginning of the for loop? Then we compute candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1.\n\n      However, what if there are multiple edges from u to v? Then we subtract all of them at once. Then the candidate is computed with the updated nadj[u] (which has subtracted the edges to v). Then we update.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      Example: \n          n=2, m=1: edge from 0 to 1.\n          We start at node1 (index1) with cost[1]=0.\n          Then we look at iadj[1]: which has node0? \n          Then for u=0: \n              nadj[0] initially is 1 (because there's one outgoing edge from 0 to 1). \n              Then we subtract the edge from 0 to 1: so nadj[0] becomes 0.\n              Then candidate = cost[1] + nadj[0] + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.\n          Then we set cost[0]=1 and push (1,0).\n\n      Then we pop (1,0) and mark it. Then we output cost[0]=1.\n\n      The sample input: \n          \"2 1\\n1 2\" -> output 1.\n\n      But the note says: \"In the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message.\" meaning one day? So output 1.\n\n      Another sample: \n          \"4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n2 3\\n3 4\" \n          The note says: output 2.\n\n      How does it work?\n          We build the reversed graph (iadj):\n            iadj[1] (node0): nothing? \n            iadj[2] (node1): from 0 (city1) and 2 (city3) -> but wait, the input:\n                 1->2: so for iadj[1] (which is node2? no, we index from 0) \n            Actually, we index cities: city1=0, city2=1, city3=2, city4=3.\n\n            Edges:\n                0->1: then iadj[1][0] = 1 -> so iadj[1] has {0:1}\n                0->2: then iadj[2][0] = 1\n                1->2: then iadj[2][1] = 1\n                2->3: then iadj[3][2] = 1\n\n            nadj: \n                nadj[0] = 2 (edges to 1 and 2)\n                nadj[1] = 1 (edge to 2)\n                nadj[2] = 1 (edge to 3)\n                nadj[3] = 0\n\n            We start at node3 (cost[3]=0). Then we look at iadj[3]: which has node2.\n            For node2: \n                nadj[2] = 1 -> subtract the edge from 2 to 3: so becomes 0.\n                candidate = cost[3] + nadj[2] + 1 = 0+0+1 = 1 -> so cost[2]=1, push (1,2).\n\n            Then we pop (1,2). Then we look at iadj[2]: which has node0 and node1.\n            For node0: \n                We have an edge from 0 to 2: so subtract 1 from nadj[0] -> now nadj[0]=1.\n                candidate = cost[2] + nadj[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 -> but we don't update yet? \n            For node1:\n                We have an edge from 1 to 2: subtract 1 from nadj[1] -> becomes 0.\n                candidate = cost[2] + nadj[1] + 1 = 1+0+1 = 2 -> so cost[1]=2, push (2,1).\n\n            Then we pop (2,1). Then we look at iadj[1]: which has node0.\n            For node0: \n                We have an edge from 0 to 1: subtract 1 from nadj[0] -> becomes 0.\n                candidate = cost[1] + nadj[0] + 1 = 2+0+1 = 3 -> so cost[0]=3? \n\n            But the expected answer is 2? \n\n      What's wrong? \n\n      Actually, the known solution for the problem (CodeForces 1608C) is:\n\n          We do:\n\n            dp[u] = min(dp[u], dp[v] + (out_degree[u] - cnt[u]) + 1)\n\n          but we are updating `nadj[u]` as we process each edge. However, the update for u should be done only once? \n\n      Alternatively, we should update u only when we have processed all the edges from u that lead to nodes with lower cost? \n\n      Actually, the known solution (from known submissions) is:\n\n          We use:\n\n            dist = [10**18] * n\n            dist[n-1] = 0\n            heap = [(0, n-1)]\n            while heap:\n                d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n                if d != dist[u]:\n                    continue\n                for v in rev[u]:   # rev[u] is the list of nodes that have an edge to u (in the original graph) -> so in the reversed graph, we have an edge from u to v?\n                    # Actually, rev[u] contains the nodes v such that there is an edge v->u in the original graph? Then in the reversed graph, we are going from u to v?\n                    deg[v] -= 1\n                    new_d = d + 1 + deg[v]   # note: they use deg[v] which is the current remaining out-degree of v?\n                    if new_d < dist[v]:\n                        dist[v] = new_d\n                        heapq.heappush(heap, (new_d, v))\n\n          But note: they subtract one from deg[v] for each edge from v to u? Then they compute new_d = d + 1 + deg[v]? \n\n          Why? Because when we process an edge from v to u, we subtract one from deg[v] (so deg[v] becomes the number of edges from v that we haven't processed and that lead to nodes that are worse than u? because we are processing in increasing order). Then the candidate for v is: \n\n              candidate = d (the cost of u) + 1 (for the move from v to u) + deg[v] (the number of edges from v that we haven't processed, which we have to block)\n\n          But note: the blocking can be done while we are at v? So the total days for v would be: deg[v] (blocking) + 1 (moving to u) + d (from u to destination).\n\n          However, in our code, we are subtracting the entire count of edges from u to v? But the known solution subtracts one at a time? \n\n      How to handle multiple edges? \n\n      Actually, in the known solution, they store the graph without counting multiple edges? Or they store the graph as a list of edges? \n\n      But our graph has multiple edges: we stored the count. \n\n      The known solution above does not account for multiple edges? \n\n      We have to adjust: we subtract the entire count of edges from u to v at once? Then the candidate becomes:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + (nadj[u] after subtracting the edges to v) + 1\n\n      But in the known solution, they subtract one edge at a time? \n\n      Actually, we can process each edge individually? But the problem says: there may be multiple edges. \n\n      The known solution that handles multiple edges:\n\n          We store the graph as an adjacency list with counts? Then we subtract the entire count? \n\n      Alternatively, we can note: the update condition is:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + (current out-degree of u)   # without adding 1? \n\n      But then we subtract the count of edges from u to v? \n\n      Actually, the known solution in C++ for the same problem (CodeForces 1608C) is:\n\n          vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> g(n);   // original graph: g[u] = (v, count?) \n          // but they build the reversed graph? \n\n          vector<int> deg(n, 0);\n          for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n              int u, v;\n              cin >> u >> v;\n              u--, v--;\n              g[v].push_back(u);   // reversed graph: edge from v to u? \n              deg[u]++;   // out-degree of u in the original graph\n          }\n\n          vector<long long> dist(n, 1e18);\n          dist[n-1] = 0;\n          priority_queue<pair<long long, int>> pq;\n          pq.push({0, n-1});\n          while (!pq.empty()) {\n              auto [d, u] = pq.top(); pq.pop();\n              d = -d;\n              if (d != dist[u]) continue;\n              for (int v : g[u]) {\n                  long long w = dist[u] + deg[v];\n                  deg[v]--;   // subtract one? \n                  if (w < dist[v]) {\n                      dist[v] = w;\n                      pq.push({-dist[v], v});\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n      But wait: they subtract one from deg[v] for each edge from v to u? Then they compute w = dist[u] + deg[v] (without +1). \n\n      Why? \n\n      Explanation: \n          When we are at node v, we have deg[v] outgoing edges. One of them is to u (which we are processing). The strategy: AmShZ can block all the other edges (which are deg[v]-1) and then tell Keshi to move to u. Then the total days for v would be: (deg[v]-1) (blocking) + 1 (moving) + dist[u] (from u to destination). \n\n          But note: the candidate is: (deg[v]-1) + 1 + dist[u] = dist[u] + deg[v]\n\n          However, they subtract one from deg[v] after the update? Then the next time we process an edge from v to another node, deg[v] has been reduced by one? \n\n      But in our problem, we have multiple edges: if there are k edges from v to u, then we process k times? \n\n      Actually, the known solution above does not account for multiple edges because they store the reversed graph as a list of edges (without counts). So if there are multiple edges, they will push the same neighbor v multiple times? \n\n      How to handle multiple edges? \n\n      We have to subtract the entire count at once? \n\n      Actually, the problem: if there are k edges from v to u, then we can use one of them to move? and we have to block the other k-1? and also block the edges to other nodes? \n\n      But note: the candidate for v when processing an edge to u is:\n\n          candidate = dist[u] + (deg[v] - 1)   # because we are going to use one edge to u, and we have to block the remaining deg[v]-1 edges? \n\n      However, if there are k edges to u, then we have to block the other k-1 edges? and also the edges to other nodes? \n\n      The total edges to block is: (deg[v] - 1)   [because we are going to use one edge, and block the rest deg[v]-1 edges, regardless of which node they go to?]\n\n      But note: the blocking is per edge, not per neighbor. So if there are k edges to u, then we have to block k-1 of them? and then we can use one. And the edges to other nodes we have to block all? \n\n      So the total blocking days = (deg[v] - 1)   [because we leave one edge (to u) and block the rest deg[v]-1 edges].\n\n      Then the candidate = (deg[v]-1) + 1 (to move) + dist[u] = dist[u] + deg[v]\n\n      And then we subtract one from deg[v] for the edge we used? \n\n      But if there are multiple edges to the same u, then we have to process each one? \n\n      Actually, we don't need to: because if we have k edges to u, then we can use one and block the other k-1. Then the candidate is the same: dist[u] + deg[v]   [where deg[v] is the current out-degree at the time of processing the first edge to u?]\n\n      However, if we process the same u multiple times, we would update v multiple times? \n\n      The known solution above does not store counts: they push the same neighbor v multiple times? \n\n      But we have stored counts. \n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          For each u in iadj[v]:\n              we have count = iadj[v][u]   (the number of edges from u to v in the original graph)\n\n          Then we do:\n\n              nadj[u] -= count   # we remove these edges from the out-degree of u\n              candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + count   # ??? \n\n      Why count? Because we have to block all the edges from u that are not to v? But note: we are going to use one of the edges to v? and block the rest count-1? and also block the other edges (nadj[u] after subtraction includes the edges to v? no, we subtracted them) -> so after subtraction, nadj[u] is the out-degree without the edges to v. Then the total blocking days = nadj[u] (which are edges to other nodes) + (count-1) (the extra edges to v that we don't use). Then the move takes 1 day. Then the cost from v: cost[v]. \n\n      Total = nadj[u] + (count-1) + 1 + cost[v] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + count\n\n      But wait: we subtracted the entire count from nadj[u] at the beginning? Then nadj[u] is the out-degree without the edges to v. Then the blocking days = nadj[u] (edges to other nodes) + (count-1) (edges to v that we block) = nadj[u] + count - 1.\n\n      Then the candidate = cost[v] + (nadj[u] + count - 1) + 1 = cost[v] + nadj[u] + count.\n\n      But note: we are processing the entire group of edges from u to v at once? \n\n      Therefore, the update condition should be:\n\n          candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + count   # where count = iadj[v][u]\n\n      And then we update cost[u] and push.\n\n      However, in the provided code, we have:\n\n          pi = iadj[u].setdefault(v,0)   # actually, we built iadj for the destination? \n\n      Correction: we built iadj for each node? \n\n      In the input, for an edge (v, u) we did:\n\n          iadj[u][v] = 1 + pi   # so we are counting the number of edges from v to u? \n\n      Then in the while loop, we are at node v, and we iterate over u in iadj[v]? Actually, no: we are iterating over u in iadj[v]? \n\n      But wait: we built iadj for each node? Then for node v, iadj[v] contains the nodes u such that there is an edge from u to v in the original graph? \n\n      Actually, we built iadj for each node as the incoming edges. So for node v, iadj[v] is a dictionary: keys are the nodes u that have an edge to v? \n\n      Then in the for loop: for u in iadj[v]: \n\n      And we get the count = iadj[v][u]\n\n      Then we do:\n\n          nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # subtract the count of edges from u to v? \n\n      Then candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]   # because we have to block the other edges: the edges from u to other nodes (nadj[u]) and the edges from u to v that we don't use (which is iadj[v][u]-1) -> total blocking = nadj[u] + (iadj[v][u]-1), then one move: total = nadj[u] + iadj[v][u] - 1 + 1 + cost[v] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n\n      Then we update cost[u] and push.\n\n      But let's test with the sample: \n          n=2, m=1: edge from 0 to 1.\n          Start at node1 (v=1): \n              iadj[1] has u=0 with count=1.\n              Then we do: \n                  nadj[0] = 1 -> subtract 1 -> becomes 0.\n                  candidate = cost[1] + nadj[0] + iadj[1][0] = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.\n              Then we set cost[0]=1 and push (1,0).\n\n          Then output 1 -> correct.\n\n      Now the second sample: \n          n=4, m=4: \n          Edges: \n              0->1, 0->2, 1->2, 2->3.\n\n          Build iadj:\n            iadj[1]: {0:1}\n            iadj[2]: {0:1, 1:1}\n            iadj[3]: {2:1}\n            iadj[0]: {}\n\n          nadj: \n            nadj[0]=2, nadj[1]=1, nadj[2]=1, nadj[3]=0.\n\n          Start at node3 (v=3) with cost[3]=0.\n          Look at iadj[3]: u=2 -> count=1.\n          Update: \n              nadj[2] = 1 - 1 = 0.\n              candidate = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 -> cost[2]=1, push (1,2).\n\n          Then pop (1,2). Look at iadj[2]: u=0 and u=1.\n          For u=0: \n              count = iadj[2][0] = 1.\n              nadj[0] = 2 - 1 = 1.\n              candidate = cost[2] (1) + nadj[0] (1) + count (1) = 1+1+1 = 3.\n          For u=1:\n              count = iadj[2][1] = 1.\n              nadj[1] = 1 - 1 = 0.\n              candidate = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 -> cost[1]=2, push (2,1).\n\n          Then pop (2,1). Look at iadj[1]: u=0 -> count=1.\n          Update u=0:\n              nadj[0] = 1 (current) - 1 = 0.\n              candidate = cost[1] (2) + nadj[0] (0) + count (1) = 2+0+1 = 3.\n\n          Then cost[0]=3? but expected 2.\n\n      What's the issue? \n\n      The known solution for the second sample is 2.\n\n      How can we achieve 2? \n          Day1: AmShZ blocks the edge from 0 to 2. Then Keshi stays at 0.\n          Day2: AmShZ tells Keshi to move. Then Keshi moves from 0 to 1 (because the edge 0->1 is not blocked).\n          Then at day2, Keshi is at 1. Then AmShZ can do:\n          Day3: tell Keshi to move: then Keshi moves from 1 to 2? \n          Then day4: move to 3? -> total 4 days? \n\n      But the note says: \n          \"on the first day, AmShZ blocks the first road. So the only reachable city from city1 will be city4. Hence on the second day, AmShZ can tell Keshi to move and Keshi will arrive at AmShZ's house.\"\n\n      How? \n          The sample input: \n              \"4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n2 3\\n3 4\"\n\n          The note says: \n              \"on the first day, AmShZ blocks the first road\" -> which road? \n              The first road: 1->2? \n              Then from city1, the remaining roads: 1->3 and 1->4? -> but there is no direct edge from 1 to 4? \n\n          Actually, the note says: \"the only reachable city from city1 will be city4\". \n\n          How? \n\n          The sample input: \n              1 2\n              1 3\n              2 3\n              3 4\n\n          After blocking the first road (1->2), then from city1: we have 1->3. Then from city3: 3->4. So the only city directly reachable from city1 is city3? \n\n          But the note says: \"the only reachable city from city1 will be city4\" -> meaning that in one move, Keshi can go from 1 to 4? \n\n          That is not possible. \n\n          Actually, the note says: \"It's also possible for AmShZ to tell Keshi to move for two days.\" -> meaning without blocking? \n\n          Day1: move from 1 to 2 or 3. \n          If to 2: then day2: move from 2 to 3, then day3: move to 4 -> 3 days.\n          If to 3: then day2: move to 4 -> 2 days.\n\n          So the minimal d is 2.\n\n          How does AmShZ force it to be 2? \n          The strategy: \n              Day1: block the edge 1->2. Then Keshi has only one choice: 1->3. \n              Then Day2: tell Keshi to move: then he moves to 3.\n              Then Day3: block nothing and tell to move: then he moves to 4? -> 3 days.\n\n          But the note says: \"on the first day, AmShZ blocks the first road. So the only reachable city from city1 will be city4\" -> that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\n          Actually, the note says: \"Hence on the second day, AmShZ can tell Keshi to move and Keshi will arrive at AmShZ's house.\" -> meaning in two days? \n\n          How? \n          After blocking the first road (1->2), then from city1, the only direct edge is to city3. Then when AmShZ tells Keshi to move on the second day, Keshi moves to city3. Then at the end of day2, Keshi is at city3. Then on day3, AmShZ can block the edge 3->4? but then Keshi stays. Then on day4, move to 4? \n\n          This is 4 days.\n\n          The note says: \"It's also possible for AmShZ to tell Keshi to move for two days.\" -> meaning without any blocking, but then it might take 2 days (if Keshi chooses the path 1->3->4) or 3 days (if he chooses 1->2->3->4). \n\n          But AmShZ wants to guarantee within d days.\n\n          The minimal d such that there is a strategy that no matter what Keshi does, they meet within d days.\n\n          The known solution for the sample is 2? \n\n          Actually, the sample output in the problem is 2.\n\n          How to achieve d=2? \n          On day1: AmShZ tells Keshi to move. Then Keshi might move to 2 or 3.\n          If he moves to 3: then on day2, AmShZ tells him to move and he moves to 4 -> done in 2 days.\n          If he moves to 2: then on day2, AmShZ can block the edge 2->3? then Keshi has no move (because from 2, the only edge is to 3, blocked) -> then he stays. Then on day3, AmShZ tells him to move? but then from 2 there is no move. Then on day4, ... \n\n          Alternatively, on day2, AmShZ can tell him to move: then from 2, he moves to 3. Then on day3, move to 4.\n\n          So if Keshi chooses to go to 2 on day1, then it takes 3 days.\n\n          Therefore, AmShZ cannot guarantee within 2 days.\n\n          But the problem says: \"AmShZ and Keshi want to find the smallest possible integer d for which they can make sure that they will see each other after at most d days.\"\n\n          And the sample output is 2.\n\n          This is a contradiction.\n\n          Actually, the sample input in the problem is:\n\n            \"4 4\n             1 2\n             1 4\n             2 3\n             3 4\"\n\n          Then the note: \n              \"on the first day, AmShZ blocks the first road. So the only reachable city from city1 will be city4. Hence on the second day, AmShZ can tell Keshi to move and Keshi will arrive at AmShZ's house.\"\n\n          So the edge list is:\n              1->2, 1->4, 2->3, 3->4.\n\n          Then after blocking the first road (1->2), from city1: only 1->4 remains. Then on the second day, move to 4.\n\n          So the minimal d=2.\n\n          Therefore, the sample input we used earlier was different.\n\n          Let's use the corrected sample: \n              n=4, m=4\n              edges: \n                  0->1, 0->3, 1->2, 2->3.\n\n          Build iadj:\n              iadj[1]: {0:1}   // edge 0->1\n              iadj[3]: {0:1, 2:1}   // edges 0->3 and 2->3\n              iadj[2]: {1:1}   // edge 1->2\n              iadj[0]: {}\n\n          nadj: \n              nadj[0]=2, nadj[1]=1, nadj[2]=1, nadj[3]=0.\n\n          Start at node3 (v=3) with cost[3]=0.\n          Look at iadj[3]: u=0 and u=2.\n          For u=0: \n              count = 1.\n              nadj[0] = 2-1 = 1.\n              candidate = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.\n          For u=2:\n              count = 1.\n              nadj[2] = 1-1 = 0.\n              candidate = 0+0+1 = 1 -> cost[2]=1, push (1,2).\n\n          Then pop (1,2). Look at iadj[2]: u=1.\n              count=1.\n              nadj[1]=1-1=0.\n              candidate=1+0+1=2 -> cost[1]=2, push (2,1).\n\n          Then pop (2,1). Look at iadj[1]: u=0.\n              count=1.\n              nadj[0]=1 (current)-1=0.\n              candidate=2+0+1=3.\n\n          Then cost[0]=min(2, 3) -> but we had two candidates for u=0: one from v=3 (candidate=2) and one from v=1 (candidate=3). We take the minimum.\n\n          So cost[0]=2.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm for program1.py should be:\n\n            if cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u] < cost[u]:\n                cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n                heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n          But note: we have already subtracted iadj[v][u] from nadj[u] before this candidate? Then nadj[u] is the out-degree without the edges to v.\n\n          And the candidate is: cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n      But wait: in the code, we have:\n\n          for u in iadj[v]:\n              pi = iadj[v][u]   # actually, we already have it stored, so we can use it.\n              # we did: \n              #   nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # so we have updated nadj[u]\n              # then candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n\n          Then we update.\n\n      So the code for program1.py:\n\n          if cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u] < cost[u]:\n              cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n      But note: we are using `iadj[v][u]` which is the count of edges from u to v? \n\n      And we have updated `nadj[u]` by subtracting `iadj[v][u]` just before.\n\n      This is correct.\n\n      Let's run the corrected sample with the candidate for u=0 from v=3: \n          cost[3]=0, nadj[0] after subtracting 1 is 1, then candidate = 0+1+1 = 2.\n\n      Then we set cost[0]=2 and push (2,0). Then we output cost[0]=2.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n          heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n      But note: the condition is already checked: if the candidate is less than cost[u] (which is initially inf), then we update.\n\n      So we only need to write the two lines.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: we are in a loop over u in iadj[v]. We have updated nadj[u] for this particular edge group (from u to v). Then we compute candidate and update.\n\n      So for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n          cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n          heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n      But note: the variable name is `iadj` and we are using `iadj[v][u]`.\n\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  We are to compute for each vertex i (from 1 to n) the number of trees (with the given properties) for which i is the centroid.\n\n  The given trees: \n      n is odd, and for each i from 2 to n, the i-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index.\n\n  This means the tree is built by attaching vertices one by one in increasing order, so it is a rooted tree with root at 1, and the parent of i is in [1, i-1].\n\n  The problem: count the number of such trees for which vertex i is the centroid.\n\n  A vertex is a centroid if when removed, every connected component has size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n  The provided code:\n\n      We have precomputed factorials and inverse factorials for combinations.\n\n      Then we have:\n\n          for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n              base = fact[n - 1]\n              frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n              out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n          Then we do:\n\n          rem = 0\n          for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n              oldrem = rem\n              rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))   # what is invs(i)? \n              out[i] -= oldrem\n              rem %= MOD\n              out[i] %= MOD\n\n      Then we output out.\n\n  What is `invs`? \n\n      def invs(x):\n          return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n      This is: (x-1)! / x! = 1/x.\n\n  But note: we are working modulo MOD.\n\n  The known solution for the problem (from known submissions for the problem \"Centroid Probabilities\") is:\n\n      Let f(i) = the number of trees with the given structure that have centroid at i.\n\n      The known recurrence:\n\n          f(i) = C(n-1, i-1) * (some product) ... \n\n      But the provided code does:\n\n          for i in range(0, (n+1)//2):   # note: the centroid must have the property that the subtree sizes are <= (n-1)//2. \n          # But note: the centroid condition: the removal of i splits the tree into connected components each of size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n          # Also note: the tree is rooted and built by attaching in increasing order? \n\n      The known solution from a known submission (in C++) for the same problem:\n\n          for (int i = 1; i <= (n+1)/2; i++) {\n              ans[i] = (ll) C(n/2, i-1) * C(n/2-1, i-1) % mod * fac[n/2] % mod * fac[n/2] % mod * ifac[n-1] % mod * n % mod;\n          }\n\n      But our code does:\n\n          base = fact[n-1]   # (n-1)!\n          frac = comb(n//2, i) * invcomb(n-1, i)   # which is: [ C(n//2, i) * (fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] / fact[n-1]) ]? \n\n          Actually, invcomb(n-1, i) is defined as: \n              invcomb(x, y) = invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y]   (modulo mod)\n\n          So: \n              comb(n//2, i) = fact[n//2] * invfact[i] * invfact[n//2 - i] \n              invcomb(n-1, i) = invfact[n-1] * fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] \n\n          Then frac = [ fact[n//2] * invfact[i] * invfact[n//2 - i] ] * [ invfact[n-1] * fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] ]\n\n          = fact[n//2] * invfact[n//2 - i] * fact[n-1-i] * invfact[n-1] \n\n          Then out[i] = fact[n-1] * frac = fact[n-1] * fact[n//2] * invfact[n//2 - i] * fact[n-1-i] * invfact[n-1] \n                     = fact[n//2] * fact[n-1-i] * invfact[n//2 - i] \n\n          = fact[n//2] * fact[n-1-i] / fact[n//2 - i] \n\n          = C(n-1-i, n//2 - i) * fact[n//2]   ??? \n\n          But note: C(n-1-i, n//2 - i) = fact[n-1-i] / ( fact[n//2-i] * fact[n-1-i - (n//2-i)] ) = fact[n-1-i] / ( fact[n//2-i] * fact[n//2-1] ) \n\n          This doesn't match.\n\n      Alternatively, the known solution from the problem: \n\n          The total number of trees is: (n-1)!

And for i >= (n+1)//2, out[i] is 0? \n\n          But the centroid condition: the largest subtree after removal has size <= (n-1)/2. Since n is odd, (n-1)/2 is an integer.\n\n          Also, the centroid cannot be in the first half? because the tree is built with increasing indices, the centroid is usually in the middle.\n\n          The known solution from the sample: \n              n=3: out = [1, 1, 0] -> 0-indexed: out[0]=1, out[1]=1, out[2]=0.\n              n=5: out = [0, 24, 0, 0, 0] -> but the sample says centroid is 3 (index2) and there are 24 trees? \n\n          In the sample, the answer for n=5 is: 24 trees, and the centroid is always 3? so out[2]=24, others 0.\n\n          But the provided code for n=5:\n\n              i in range(0, (5+1)//2 = 3): i=0,1,2.\n\n              base = fact[4] = 24.\n\n              i=0: \n                  comb(5//2,0) = comb(2,0)=1.\n                  invcomb(4,0)=? \n                      comb(4,0)=1, so invcomb(4,0)=1? \n                  out[0]=24*1=24.\n\n              i=1:\n                  comb(2,1)=2.\n                  invcomb(4,1)=? \n                      comb(4,1)=4, so invcomb(4,1)=1/4? \n                  out[1]=24 * (2 * 1/4) = 24 * (2/4)=12.\n\n              i=2:\n                  comb(2,2)=1.\n                  invcomb(4,2)=1/comb(4,2)=1/6.\n                  out[2]=24 * (1 * 1/6)=4.\n\n              Then we do the rem loop:\n\n                  i=4: out[4] = 0, then rem=0, then out[4] = 0.\n                  i=3: out[3]=0, then rem=0, out[3]=0.\n                  i=2: oldrem=0, rem += out[2] * invs(2) = 4 * (1/2) = 2, then out[2] = 4 - 0 = 4.\n                  i=1: oldrem=2, rem += out[1] * invs(1) = 12 * (1/1) = 12 -> rem=14, then out[1]=12-2=10.\n                  i=0: oldrem=14, rem += out[0]*invs(0) -> but invs(0) is defined for x=0: \n                         invs(0): fact[-1] is not defined -> error.\n\n          We see the problem: the loop for i in range((n+1)//2) only goes up to (n+1)//2 - 1 = 2 for n=5. But then the out array for indices 3 and 4 are 0. And then we do the rem loop for i from n-1 down to 0: i=4,3,2,1,0.\n\n          But in the rem loop, we use out[i] for i in [0, n-1].

Since n is odd, (n-1)/2 = (n/2) - 0.5, so floor is (n-1)/2. And n/2 = (n-1)/2 + 0.5, so the condition is the same as the usual centroid condition: <= floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2.\n\n          Therefore, the centroid is the usual centroid.\n\n          In a tree, there can be at most two centroids, and if there are two, then they are adjacent and n is even? \n\n          But the problem states n is odd, so there is exactly one centroid.\n\n          Therefore, the answers for the vertices should be: one vertex will be the centroid, and the others 0.\n\n          But the sample n=3: two centroids? \n\n          Let me check: \n              Tree1: \n                  1\n                 / \\\n                2   3\n                Remove 1: we get two components of size 1 -> 1<= (3-1)/2=1 -> centroid.\n                Remove 2: we get components: {1,3} (size2) -> 2>1 -> not centroid.\n                Remove 3: similarly not.\n              Tree2:\n                  1\n                   \\\n                    2\n                     \\\n                      3\n                Remove 1: components: {2,3} (size2) -> not centroid.\n                Remove 2: components: {1} and {3} -> both size1 -> centroid.\n                Remove 3: not.\n\n          So in tree1, the centroid is 1; in tree2, the centroid is 2.\n\n          Therefore, there is exactly one centroid per tree.\n\n          So the answers: for vertex1: 1 tree, for vertex2: 1 tree, for vertex3: 0.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code for program2.py must output: 1, 1, 0 for n=3.\n\n          How to compute it? \n\n          The known solution from the editorial:\n\n              Let T = (n-1)!   // the total number of trees.\n\n              For a fixed vertex i, we want to count the trees in which i is the centroid.\n\n              The condition: the subtree sizes for the children of i must be <= (n-1)/2, and also the component attached to the parent of i (if any) must be <= (n-1)/2.\n\n              But the tree is built with increasing indices, so the parent of i is in [1, i-1] and the children are in [i+1, n].\n\n              However, the tree is not rooted at i. We can root the tree at i? \n\n          The known solution from a known submission (from CodeForces) for the problem \"Centroid Probabilities\" (problem link: not provided) is:\n\n              #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n              using namespace std;\n              using ll = long long;\n              const int maxn = 1e6+10;\n              const int mod = 998244353;\n\n              int n;\n              ll fact[maxn], invf[maxn];\n\n              ll mpow(ll a, ll b) {\n                  ll res = 1;\n                  for (; b; b>>=1, a=a*a%mod) if (b&1) res=res*a%mod;\n                  return res;\n              }\n\n              ll inv(ll a) { return mpow(a, mod-2); }\n\n              ll choose(int a, int b) {\n                  if (b < 0 || b > a) return 0;\n                  return fact[a] * invf[b] % mod * invf[a-b] % mod;\n              }\n\n              int main() {\n                  cin >> n;\n                  fact[0] = 1;\n                  for (int i = 1; i < maxn; i++) fact[i] = fact[i-1]*i % mod;\n                  invf[maxn-1] = inv(fact[maxn-1]);\n                  for (int i = maxn-2; i >= 0; i--) invf[i] = invf[i+1]*(i+1) % mod;\n\n                  vector<ll> ans(n+1, 0);\n                  // for each i from 1 to n: \n                  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                      // the condition for i to be the centroid: the size of the subtree containing i must be > (n-1)/2? \n                      // actually, we need to ensure that no subtree has size > (n-1)/2.\n                      // But the tree is not rooted at i.\n\n                      // We can use: \n                      //   ans[i] = (number of trees where the largest subtree attached to i has size <= (n-1)/2) \n                      //            - (number of trees where the largest subtree attached to i has size <= (n-1)/2 but the centroid is not i) \n                      // This is not easy.\n\n                      // Instead, we use: \n                      //   Let F(i) = the number of trees where the centroid has index >= i.\n                      //   Then f(i) = F(i) - F(i+1)\n\n                      // How to compute F(i): \n                      //   F(i) = (number of trees where the subtree sizes for the children of i are <= (n-1)/2) \n                      //   and also the component attached to the parent of i is <= (n-1)/2. \n                      //   But the tree is not rooted.\n\n                  }\n\n                  // Known recurrence from the sample: \n                  //   for i in range(1, (n+1)//2+1): \n                  //        ans[i] = T * ( some factor ) \n                  //   then do a backward subtraction.\n\n              }\n\n          The provided code in the problem does:\n\n              for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n                  base = fact[n - 1]\n                  frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n                  out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n          then the backward loop.\n\n          The sample n=3: \n              i=0: \n                  comb( floor(3/2)=1,0)=1.\n                  invcomb(2,0)=1.\n                  out[0]=2.\n              i=1:\n                  comb(1,1)=1.\n                  invcomb(2,1)=1/2.\n                  out[1]=2 * (1 * 1/2)=1.\n\n          Then the backward loop:\n\n              i=2: out[2]=0 -> out[2] = 0 - 0 = 0.\n              i=1: rem = 0 + out[1] * invs(1) = 1 * 1 = 1; out[1] = 1 - 0 = 1.\n              i=0: rem = 1 + out[0] * invs(0) -> undefined.\n\n          To avoid i=0, we note that the centroid cannot be node0 in the sense of the condition? \n\n          But in the sample, node0 (vertex1) can be the centroid.\n\n          However, the condition for the centroid: the removal of vertex1 must yield components of size at most (n-1)/2 = 1. \n          In the tree with edges (1-2) and (1-3), it does.\n\n          Therefore, we must have an answer for i=0.\n\n          What is invs(0)? We defined it as fact[0-1] * invfact[0] -> which is fact[-1] -> not defined.\n\n          We should define invs(x) for x>=1 only. In the backward loop, i goes from n-1 down to 0. For i=0, we should skip the multiplication by invs(0)? \n\n          But the provided code does not skip.\n\n          Alternatively, we can change the backward loop to start from n-1 down to 1, and leave out[0] as computed.\n\n          But then for n=3, out[0] would be 2, out[1]=1, out[2]=0, and then after the backward loop for i>=1, out[0] is not touched.\n\n          Then the output would be: 2, 1, 0 -> but expected 1, 1, 0.\n\n          So we need to subtract something from out[0]? \n\n          The known solution might be: \n\n              out[0] = out[0] - (out[1]+out[2]+...) \n\n          In the backward loop, we are accumulating 'rem' which is the sum of out[i] * (1/(i+1)) for i from n-1 down to i+1, and then out[i] = out[i] - rem (which is the sum for indices below i).\n\n          But for i=0, we haven't done anything. \n\n          We can do the backward loop for i from n-1 down to 1, and then after that, \n\n              out[0] = out[0] - rem\n\n          But the code does the loop for i in range(n-1, -1, -1), and for i=0, we do:\n\n              oldrem = rem\n              rem += out[0] * invs(0)   // which is not defined.\n\n          Therefore, we must change the backward loop to avoid i=0? \n\n          But the problem: the centroid for the first node (0) is valid.\n\n          Alternatively, we can define invs(0) = 0? or skip the multiplication for i=0.\n\n          But the known recurrence might be: \n\n              f(i) = g(i) - sum_{j>i} f(j) * ( something ) \n\n          In the code, the something is 1/(i+1) for the multiplier in the accumulation.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the provided code for program2.py is given and we only need to complete the missing part (which is the inv function), and the backward loop is given, we must complete the inv function.\n\n          The inv function is for modular multiplicative inverse. We are to complete:\n\n              def inv(x):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We can compute the modular inverse of x modulo MOD by Fermat's little theorem: \n\n              return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          But note: x might be 0? then we get an error. In the backward loop, we call invs(0) which calls inv(0) in the invfact? \n\n          But in the invs function, we use fact[x-1] and invfact[x]. The invfact for x=0 is defined as 1. But fact[-1] is not defined.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code for program2.py has an issue at i=0 in the backward loop.\n\n          How to fix the backward loop? \n\n          The intended recurrence might be for i>=1. The centroid for the first node (0) might be computed in the first for loop, and then in the backward loop, for i=0, we should not use invs(0) but something else.\n\n          Given the time, and since the problem asks for the missing code (only the missing lines), and the missing code for program2.py is only the inv function, we can complete the inv function as:\n\n              def inv(x):\n                  return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          and hope that x is never 0 in the inv function? \n\n          But in the inv function, we are called with x being an integer. Where is the inv function used? \n\n          In the precomputation: \n              invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n\n          and then in the comb and invcomb functions, we use invfact which is computed from inv of factorials.\n\n          The factorial of 0 is 1, and we have invfact[0] = 1.\n\n          In the invs function: \n              def invs(x):\n                  return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n          This is called in the backward loop for i in [0, n-1]. For i=0, x=0, then we access fact[-1] -> out of bounds.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code for program2.py has an out of bounds access.\n\n          To fix this, we would need to change the backward loop, but the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and we are only to fill in the missing lines.\n\n          The missing lines in program2.py are only in the inv function.\n\n          So we complete the inv function as:\n\n              def inv(x):\n                  return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          and hope that in the other uses (like in the precomputation) it is not called with x=0? \n\n          But in the precomputation: \n              invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n\n          fact[MAX-1] is a large number but not zero, so it's safe.\n\n          However, in the invs function, we are not using the inv function, we are using the precomputed invfact. The invs function is defined in terms of fact and invfact arrays.\n\n          The only issue is the out of bounds in fact[x-1] for x=0.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify how to fix the backward loop, and we are only to complete the missing code (the inv function), we do that.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code for the inv function is:\n\n              return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          But note: the modmul function is defined, and we are working modulo MOD.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          This is the modular inverse.\n\n          Summary:\n\n          For program1.py, the missing code in the TODO is:\n\n              cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n          For program2.py, the missing code for the inv function is:\n\n              return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          But note: the problem says to output in the specified JSON format.\n\n          Example output:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\\n        heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\",\n            \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n          }\n\n          However, we must be cautious: in program1.py, the code is indented. The TODO is inside the for loop, inside the while loop.\n\n          The existing code has:\n\n              while q:\n                  d,v=heapq.heappop(q)\n                  if visit[v]:\n                      continue\n                  visit[v]=1\n                  for u in iadj[v]:\n                      nadj[u]-=iadj[v][u]\n                      if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:   # we changed the condition to use iadj[v][u] and also the candidate is cost[v]+nadj[u]+iadj[v][u] \n                          # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We changed the condition? \n\n          Actually, the condition in the provided code is:\n\n              if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n\n          But we derived that the candidate is cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u] (not +1).\n\n          Therefore, we must also change the condition to:\n\n              candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              if candidate < cost[u]:\n\n          But the problem says: we are to output only the missing code, and the condition is already written? \n\n          The TODO is only to replace the two lines inside the if.\n\n          However, the condition is also part of the TODO? \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the missing lines or blocks.\n\n          The provided code has:\n\n              if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to change the condition to use `iadj[v][u]` and then update.\n\n          Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n              if cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u] < cost[u]:\n                  cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n                  heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n          But note: the subtraction of `iadj[v][u]` from `nadj[u]` is done before the condition, so we use the updated `nadj[u]`.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              if candidate < cost[u]:\n                  cost[u] = candidate\n                  heapq.heappush(q, (candidate, u))\n\n          This is clearer.\n\n          Given the problem allows a block, we can write:\n\n              candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              if candidate < cost[u]:\n                  cost[u] = candidate\n                  heapq.heappush(q, (candidate, u))\n\n          But the problem: the condition in the provided code is already there. We are to output only the missing code, not to change existing code.\n\n          However, the condition in the provided code is not correct. We must change it.\n\n          Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and the block includes the condition, we can consider the entire if block as missing.\n\n          But the for loop and the subtraction are not missing.\n\n          The safest is to output only the two lines for the TODO, and hope that the condition is not used. \n\n          But the condition is there and uses `+1`, which is not correct.\n\n          Therefore, we must change the condition. \n\n          Given the instructions: \"Output only the missing code\", and the TODO is inside the if condition, we can output the entire if block that should replace the existing if condition and the TODO.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          Alternatively, we can output:\n\n              candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              if candidate < cost[u]:\n                  cost[u] = candidate\n                  heapq.heappush(q, (candidate, u))\n\n          and this block should be placed at the TODO.\n\n          But the existing code has an if condition already. We are replacing it.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify whether we can change existing conditions, and to be safe, we output the block that should be placed in the TODO, which includes the corrected condition and the update.\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n              candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              if candidate < cost[u]:\n                  cost[u] = candidate\n                  heapq.heappush(q, (candidate, u))\n\n          For program2.py, the missing code for the inv function is:\n\n              return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          But note: the inv function might be called with x=0? then it will return an error. However, in the precomputation, we are not calling inv(0) because we start from 1 in the factorial. In the invs function, we are not using inv(0) but we are using the precomputed invfact and fact, and the invs function is called in the backward loop with i=0, which accesses fact[-1] -> which is not defined. But that is not part of the inv function.\n\n          So the inv function is only used in the precomputation for large factorials, which are nonzero.\n\n          Therefore, we output.\n\n          However, there is an alternative: the modular inverse of 0 is undefined. We should avoid calling inv(0). But in the given code, we do:\n\n              invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n\n          and fact[MAX-1] is not zero.\n\n          So it's safe.\n\n          Final output in JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\\n    if candidate < cost[u]:\\n        cost[u] = candidate\\n        heapq.heappush(q, (candidate, u))\",\n            \"program2\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n          }\n\n          But note: the indentation in program1: the TODO is inside the for loop, and we are replacing the if and the TODO with a block. The existing for loop is:\n\n              for u in iadj[v]:\n                  nadj[u]-=iadj[v][u]\n                  if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:   # we want to replace this if and the TODO\n\n          We replace that if and the TODO with:\n\n              candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + iadj[v][u]\n              if candidate < cost[u]:\n                  cost[u] = candidate\n                  heapq.heappush(q, (candidate, u))\n\n          So the missing block is exactly that.\n\n          For program2, the inv function is:\n\n              def inv(x):\n                  return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n          and we output the body.\n\n          But the TODO in program2 is: \n\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          in the inv function.\n\n          So we output the return statement.\n\n          We output in the JSON as strings.\n\n          Let's hope."
