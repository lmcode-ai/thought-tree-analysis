  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code uses a deque and has a while loop that processes the candies. The current code has a TODO in the else branch.\n\nThe idea is to use two pointers (or a deque) to simulate the process. We start with two empty sums (a for Alice, b for Bob). We have a variable `cur` that counts the total number of candies eaten so far. The goal is to update `ans` whenever a and b become equal.\n\nHowever, note that the current code has an issue: it always alternates between popping from the right and then from the left? Actually, the condition is if a>=b then Bob (right) eats, else ... but the else is not implemented.\n\nBut note: the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. However, the code uses a deque and when a>=b, it pops from the right (which would be Bob) and adds to b. When a < b, we should let Alice eat from the left? But the code currently has a TODO.\n\nSo we need to complete the else branch: when a < b, we should take from the left (and add to a). Also, we are using a deque: we can pop from the left with `l.popleft()`.\n\nBut note: the initial code does not have a left pointer, it uses a deque. So we can do:\n\nIn the else branch: \n   a += l.popleft()\n\nBut note: the condition at the end: if a==b, then we set ans = cur.\n\nHowever, the problem is that we are only allowed to eat from the left in a contiguous manner for Alice and from the right for Bob. The simulation with two pointers (or deque) is standard for such problems.\n\nBut note: the example test cases. The second test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer is 7. How?\n\nIn the second test case: \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n  Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n  Total candies: 3+4 = 7.\n\nBut the simulation:\n\nWe start with:\n  l = deque([7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1])\n  a=0, b=0, cur=0, ans=0.\n\nStep 1: a>=b? (0>=0 -> true) -> pop right: 1 -> b=1, cur=1 -> a=0, b=1 -> not equal.\nStep 2: a<b -> pop left: 7 -> a=7, cur=2 -> 7 vs 1 -> not equal.\nStep 3: a>=b (7>=1) -> pop right: 11 -> b=1+11=12, cur=3 -> 7 vs 12 -> not equal.\nStep 4: a<b -> pop left: 3 -> a=10, cur=4 -> 10 vs 12 -> not equal.\nStep 5: a<b -> pop left: 20 -> a=30, cur=5 -> 30 vs 12 -> not equal.\nStep 6: a>=b -> pop right: 8 -> b=20, cur=6 -> 30 vs 20 -> not equal.\nStep 7: a>=b -> pop right: 10 -> b=30, cur=7 -> 30==30 -> ans=7.\n\nThen we break? Actually, the while loop continues until the deque is empty. But we have to consider that we might have multiple points where a==b. We want the maximum total candies? So we update ans whenever a==b.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"maximum number of candies\". So we update ans whenever a==b and then continue? Because we might have a later point where a==b again and with more candies? However, once we have eaten all candies, we stop. But also, if we have a==b at some point, we record the total candies at that moment and then continue? Because we might get a higher total? Actually, we can continue until the deque is empty and update whenever we get a==b.\n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to stop at any time? Actually, the problem does not require that they eat all candies. They can stop at any point. So we are simulating the entire process? Actually, the problem says: they can eat any number from the left (contiguous from the left) and any number from the right (contiguous from the right). But they cannot skip candies in the middle. So the candies they eat must be a prefix and a suffix that do not overlap.\n\nThe simulation with two pointers (or deque) is a common solution: we start with two pointers at the ends. We have two sums: a (for the prefix) and b (for the suffix). We move the pointers inward until they meet. We update the answer whenever the two sums are equal.\n\nBut note: the current code uses a deque and pops from either end. We are updating `cur` (the total candies eaten) at every step. And when a==b, we set ans=cur. But we don't break? We continue until the deque is empty? That is acceptable because we want the maximum total candies. However, the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So we want the maximum `cur` for which a==b.\n\nBut note: the example test case 3: [1,1,1,1,1,1] -> answer is 6. How?\n  Step1: a>=b -> pop right: 1 -> b=1, cur=1 -> not equal.\n  Step2: a<b -> pop left: 1 -> a=1, cur=2 -> equal -> ans=2.\n  Step3: a>=b -> pop right: 1 -> b=2, cur=3 -> not equal.\n  Step4: a<b -> pop left: 1 -> a=2, cur=4 -> equal -> ans=4.\n  Step5: a>=b -> pop right: 1 -> b=3, cur=5 -> not equal.\n  Step6: a<b -> pop left: 1 -> a=3, cur=6 -> equal -> ans=6.\n\nSo we update multiple times and the last update is 6.\n\nBut the problem: the total number of candies is 6, and they both have 3. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and we are updating whenever we get an equal sum. And we are going until the deque is empty. This is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the constraints: the total n over test cases is <= 200000. So we can simulate until the deque is empty for each test case? But worst-case one test case has 200000 candies. The while loop runs n times. And the total over test cases is 200000, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo for the else branch, we do:\n   a += l.popleft()\n\nBut note: what if the deque becomes empty during the process? The while condition checks `while l:`, so we break when the deque is empty.\n\nBut what if we pop from an empty deque? We are protected by the while condition.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is just one line: \n   a += l.popleft()\n\nBut note: the code already has an if block for a>=b and an else. We are to complete the else.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing part is: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\nBut note: the code has a line after the if-else: \n   if a==b:\n        ans = cur\n\nThat is correct.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem is about an infinite grid and a non-increasing sequence a_i. The grid cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x, and black otherwise. We start with one doll at (0,0). In one operation, we can remove a doll at (x,y) and place two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). The goal is to have all white cells contain 0 dolls. We need the minimum number of operations modulo 10^9+7.\n\nThe provided code:\n\nn,x,d,m,f = int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\nfor i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\nfor z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n    d += f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\n    x += 1\nprint(d%m)\n\nWe see that the first for loop is incomplete. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\". Also, note that 9**6 is 531441, which is about 500000. We are going to precompute factorials? Because we see f is initialized as [1] and then we are building a list f of factorials? Because in the next part we see combinations: f[z+x] * ... and then we have factorials in the denominator.\n\nThe expression: \n   d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1] * f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n\nThis looks like a binomial coefficient: \n   C(z+x, x+1) * (z!=0)   ??? \n\nBut note: \n   The expression: f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) mod m\nBut we are using modular inverse: pow(denom, m-2, m) is the inverse mod m.\n\nSo if f is the factorial array, then:\n   f[0] = 1, f[1]=1, f[2]=2, ... \n\nThen the term: \n   f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1] * f[z-1], m-2, m) mod m\n   = C(z+x, x+1) * (z!=0)   ??? \n\nBut note: the standard binomial coefficient: C(n, k) = f[n] / (f[k] * f[n-k])\n\nHere, we have: \n   n = z+x, and we are dividing by f[x+1] * f[z-1]. \n   But note: (x+1) + (z-1) = x+z, so that is consistent? \n   Actually, we have: \n        C(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z+x - (x+1)]) = f[z+x]/(f[x+1]*f[z-1])\n   because z+x - (x+1) = z-1.\n\nSo the term is C(z+x, x+1) if z != 0, and 0 if z==0.\n\nBut what is the meaning? \n\nThe problem: we are given a non-increasing sequence a0, a1, ... an (and then zeros). The grid is defined by the sequence. The goal is to compute the minimum operations.\n\nWe note that the problem is known from a CodeForces problem: \n   https://codeforces.com/contest/1696/problem/E\nThe solution uses combinatorics.\n\nThe idea: \n   The process is similar to the propagation of the doll. Each operation at (x,y) produces two dolls at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). The goal is to have no dolls in white cells. \n\n   Note: the white cells are (x,y) for y < a_x. The black cells are (x,y) for y>=a_x.\n\n   We are allowed to do operations arbitrarily. The key is that the doll at (x,y) must be removed if (x,y) is white? But note: the goal is to have 0 dolls in every white cell. So we must remove all dolls that ever appear in white cells.\n\n   How many dolls appear at a white cell (x,y)? Actually, the initial doll is at (0,0). Since a0 is the first term, and (0,0) is white if 0 < a0 -> which is true because a0>=0 and if a0==0 then (0,0) is black? But note: the condition is \"white if y < a_x\". So (0,0): y=0, so if a0>0 then (0,0) is white. But if a0==0, then (0,0) is black.\n\n   The problem: we start at (0,0). If (0,0) is black, then we don't need to remove it? But the problem says \"all white cells contain 0 dolls\". So we don't care about black cells? However, the operation might produce dolls that land on white cells? \n\n   The known solution: \n        The answer is the sum for x from 0 to infinity of the number of white cells in row x that are reachable? Actually, the known solution is:\n\n        ans = 0\n        for x in range(0, n+1):\n            if a[x] > 0:\n                ans = (ans + C(x + a[x] - 1, x)) % mod\n\n        But note: the example: \n            Input: n=1, a = [2,1] -> answer=5.\n\n        How does that work?\n            x=0: a0=2 -> term = C(0+2-1,0) = C(1,0)=1\n            x=1: a1=1 -> term = C(1+1-1,1)=C(1,1)=1\n            total = 2 -> but the example says 5.\n\n        Alternatively, the known solution from the editorial of CodeForces 1696E is:\n\n            ans = 0\n            for i in range(n+1):\n                if a[i] > 0:\n                    ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod\n\n        Let's test with the example: \n            n=1, a=[2,1]\n            i=0: a0=2 -> term = C(0+2, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2\n            i=1: a1=1 -> term = C(1+1, 1+1)=C(2,2)=1\n            total = 3 -> not 5.\n\n        Another known solution from a submission:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            typedef long long ll;\n            const int N = 700000, mod = 1e9+7;\n            ll fac[N], ifac[N];\n            ll C(int n, int k) {\n                if (k<0 || k>n) return 0;\n                return fac[n] * ifac[k] % mod * ifac[n-k] % mod;\n            }\n            int main() {\n                fac[0] = 1;\n                for (int i=1; i<N; i++) fac[i] = fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n                ifac[N-1] = 101141641;\n                for (int i=N-1; i>=1; i--) ifac[i-1] = ifac[i] * i % mod;\n                int n; scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n                vector<int> a(n+1);\n                for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n                ll ans = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                    ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n                }\n                printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n            }\n\n        But wait, the example input: \n            n=1\n            a0=2, a1=1 -> output: 3? but the example in the note says 5.\n\n        The note example: \n            \"Consider the first example. ... with 5 operations.\"\n\n        The first example in the problem statement: \n            Input: \n                1\n                2 1\n            Output: \n                5\n\n        So the above C++ code outputs 3? \n\n        Actually, the known solution from the editorial is:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            const int MOD = 1e9+7;\n            const int N = 400000;\n            int fact[N], invfact[N];\n            int C(int n, int k) {\n                if (k<0 || k>n) return 0;\n                return 1LL * fact[n] * invfact[k] % MOD * invfact[n-k] % MOD;\n            }\n            int main() {\n                fact[0]=1;\n                for (int i=1; i<N; i++) fact[i]=1LL*fact[i-1]*i%MOD;\n                invfact[N-1] = 667033874; // modular inverse of fact[N-1] mod MOD\n                for (int i=N-2; i>=0; i--) invfact[i] = 1LL*invfact[i+1]*(i+1)%MOD;\n                int n; cin >> n;\n                vector<int> a(n+1);\n                for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n                long long ans = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                    ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % MOD;\n                }\n                cout << ans << endl;\n            }\n\n        But this also gives 3 for [2,1]. \n\n        Let me check the example: \n            We start at (0,0). \n            Operation 1: remove (0,0) -> place at (0,1) and (1,0). \n            Operation 2: remove (0,1) -> place at (0,2) and (1,1). \n            Operation 3: remove (1,0) -> place at (1,1) and (2,0). \n            Operation 4: remove (1,1) -> place at (1,2) and (2,1). \n            Operation 5: remove (1,1) again? But wait, we have two dolls at (1,1) after operation 4? Actually, after operation 2: (1,1) has one doll. After operation 3: (1,1) becomes two. Then we remove one (1,1) in operation 4: then we get (1,2) and (2,1). Then we remove the other (1,1) in operation 5: then we get (1,2) again and (2,1) again.\n\n            Now the white cells: \n                row0: y<2 -> (0,0) and (0,1) -> must be 0 dolls. \n                row1: y<1 -> (1,0) -> must be 0 dolls.\n\n            After 5 operations: \n                (0,0):0, (0,1):0, (0,2):1 (from operation2) -> but (0,2) is black? because for row0: a0=2 -> white if y<2 -> so (0,2) is black -> we don't care.\n                (1,0):0, (1,1):0, (1,2):2 (from operation4 and 5) -> black? because a1=1 -> white only for y<1 -> so (1,1) and (1,2) are black -> we don't care.\n                (2,0):1 (from operation3) -> row2: a2=0 (since n=1, so for i>n, a_i=0) -> white if y<0 -> none. So (2,0) is black? \n                (2,1):2 (from operation4 and 5) -> black.\n\n            So all white cells are 0.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is 5.\n\n        How to get 5? \n\n        The known solution in the editorial of CodeForces 1696E is:\n\n            The answer is: sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i+i, i+1)\n\n            For [2,1]: \n                i=0: C(2+0, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2\n                i=1: C(1+1, 1+1)=C(2,2)=1\n                total=3.\n\n        Why 3? \n\n        Actually, the known solution from the top competitors is:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            const int mod = 1e9+7;\n            const int maxn = 700000;\n            int fac[maxn], inv[maxn];\n            int C(int n, int k) {\n                if (k<0 || k>n) return 0;\n                return 1LL * fac[n] * inv[k] % mod * inv[n-k] % mod;\n            }\n            int main() {\n                fac[0]=1;\n                for (int i=1; i<maxn; i++) fac[i]=1LL*fac[i-1]*i%mod;\n                inv[maxn-1] = 101141641; // This is the modular inverse of fac[maxn-1] mod mod? \n                for (int i=maxn-2; i>=0; i--) inv[i]=1LL*inv[i+1]*(i+1)%mod;\n                int n; cin>>n;\n                vector<int> a(n+1);\n                for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) cin>>a[i];\n                long long ans=0;\n                for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i]==0) break;\n                    ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n                }\n                cout << ans << endl;\n            }\n\n        But this gives 3.\n\n        After checking the editorial: \n            https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/103969\n\n        The editorial says:\n\n            The answer is: \n                sum_{i=0}^{n} [ C(a_i-1+i, i) ]   ... ?\n\n        Actually, the editorial says:\n\n            The number of operations needed is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that only move right or down? \n\n        But note: each operation at (x,y) produces two dolls: one at (x+1,y) and one at (x,y+1). This is the reverse of moving: from (x,y) we can come from (x-1,y) or (x,y-1). \n\n        The known combinatorial solution: \n            The number of times we have to remove a doll at (x,y) (for a white cell) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay within the white region? \n\n        Actually, the editorial says: \n            The answer is the sum_{x=0}^{n} sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x)\n\n        Then we can change the order of summation? \n\n            = sum_{x=0}^{n} [ C(x+0, x) + C(x+1, x) + ... + C(x+a_x-1, x) ]\n\n        And we know: \n            C(x, x) + C(x+1, x) + ... + C(x+k, x) = C(x+k+1, x+1)   [by the hockey-stick identity]\n\n        So: \n            = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n        So the answer is: \n            ans = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n        For the example: \n            x=0: a0=2 -> term = C(0+2, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2\n            x=1: a1=1 -> term = C(1+1, 1+1)=C(2,2)=1\n            total=3.\n\n        But the example requires 5 operations.\n\n        Why the discrepancy? \n\n        The editorial says: \n            \"The number of times we must remove a doll at (x,y) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that only move right and down and that stay in the white region. Then the total operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of that number.\"\n\n        And then they use the identity to get the closed form.\n\n        However, the example: \n            The white cells: \n                (0,0): 1 path -> operation at (0,0) is needed.\n                (0,1): 1 path (from (0,0) to (0,1): one step down? but wait, we can only move right and down? Actually, the grid: \n                    (0,0) -> (0,1) is right? \n                    (0,0) -> (1,0) is down.\n\n                So for (0,1): we have one path: (0,0) -> (0,1) (by moving right).\n                For (1,0): we have one path: (0,0) -> (1,0) (by moving down).\n\n                Then for (0,2): not white? because a0=2 -> white for y<2 -> so (0,2) is black -> skip.\n                For (1,1): black? because a1=1 -> white for y<1 -> so (1,1) is black -> skip.\n\n            Then the total operations would be 1 (for (0,0)) + 1 (for (0,1)) + 1 (for (1,0)) = 3.\n\n        But we did 5 operations. \n\n        The catch: the process is not about paths from (0,0) to (x,y) in the grid? Actually, the removal of a doll at (x,y) must be done for every time a doll appears at (x,y). And the propagation: \n            The initial doll at (0,0) is removed in operation1, producing two dolls at (0,1) and (1,0). \n            Then the doll at (0,1) is removed in operation2, producing (0,2) and (1,1). \n            Then the doll at (1,0) is removed in operation3, producing (1,1) and (2,0). \n            Then the two dolls at (1,1) must be removed: two operations (operation4 and operation5).\n\n        So the white cells that we care about: \n            (0,0): 1 removal\n            (0,1): 1 removal\n            (1,0): 1 removal\n            (1,1): 2 removals   -> total 5.\n\n        But (1,1) is black? because for row1: a1=1 -> white only for y<1 -> so (1,1) is black. Then why do we remove it? \n\n        The goal: \"all white cells contain 0 dolls\". The black cells can have any number of dolls. So we don't need to remove dolls in black cells. \n\n        Therefore, we only count the removals that occur at white cells. \n\n        In the example, the removals at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) are in white cells. The removals at (1,1) are in a black cell? so we don't need to remove them? \n\n        But then why did we do 5 operations? \n\n        The problem: \n            \"You can do the following operation. Select one doll on (x,y). Remove it and place a doll on (x,y+1) and a doll on (x+1,y).\"\n\n        The goal: \"all white cells contain 0 dolls\".\n\n        The catch: we must remove every doll that ever appears in a white cell. But note: the operation is only defined on a doll that is present. We are allowed to remove a doll in a black cell? The problem does not restrict the operation to white cells. But if we remove a doll in a black cell, we are producing two new dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). \n\n        However, the goal only requires that at the end, the white cells have 0 dolls. We can leave dolls in black cells. \n\n        Therefore, we only need to remove the dolls that are in white cells. \n\n        In the example, the doll at (0,0) is white -> must be removed. \n        Then we get two dolls: (0,1) and (1,0). \n            (0,1): white? for row0: a0=2 -> y=1 < 2 -> white -> must be removed.\n            (1,0): white? for row1: a1=1 -> y=0 < 1 -> white -> must be removed.\n        Then we remove (0,1): produces (0,2) and (1,1). \n            (0,2): black? because y=2>=a0=2 -> black -> we can leave it.\n            (1,1): black? because y=1>=a1=1 -> black -> we can leave it.\n        Then we remove (1,0): produces (1,1) and (2,0). \n            (1,1): black -> leave.\n            (2,0): black? because for row2: a2=0 (since n=1, so a_i=0 for i>1) -> white if y<0 -> none -> so (2,0) is black? Actually, the condition: y<0 -> false, so black -> leave.\n\n        Then we have no more dolls in white cells. So we only did 3 operations.\n\n        But the example in the note says 5 operations. \n\n        The note example: \n            \"One of the optimal sequence of operations is as follows: \n              Do the operation with (0,0). Now the state of the grid is (1,0,1),(0,1,1). \n              Do the operation with (0,1). Now the state of the grid is (1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,2,1). \n              Do the operation with (1,0). Now the state of the grid is (1,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,0,1). \n              Do the operation with (1,1). Now the state of the grid is (1,1,1),(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,1),(2,1,1). \n              Do the operation with (1,1). Now the state of the grid is (0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,2).\"\n\n        Why did they remove (1,1) twice? \n\n        The goal: \"all white cells contain 0 dolls\". \n        After the first three operations, the white cells: \n            (0,0):0, (0,1):0, (1,0):0 -> so we are done? \n\n        But the note says: \"Now all white cells contain 0 dolls, so we have achieved the goal with 5 operations.\"\n\n        What are the white cells? \n            The grid: \n                row0: a0=2 -> white for y=0 and y=1.\n                row1: a1=1 -> white for y=0.\n                row2: a2=0 -> no white cells.\n\n        After three operations: \n            (0,0):0, (0,1):0, (1,0):0 -> so we are done.\n\n        Why do two more operations? \n\n        The problem: \n            \"You goal is to make all white cells contain 0 dolls\"\n\n        The note example does not say that we stop after three operations. It says we do five operations. \n\n        I see the confusion: the problem does not require that we minimize the number of operations? But it says \"minimum number of operations\". \n\n        The catch: the problem says \"You can do the following operation. Select one doll on (x,y).\" -> we can select any doll, even if it is in a black cell. But if we remove a doll in a black cell, we are not required to do so by the goal. However, the goal is only about white cells. So we can leave black cells with any number of dolls. \n\n        Therefore, the minimum number of operations is exactly the number of times we must remove a doll that is in a white cell. And that is the sum over white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay within the white region? \n\n        And that sum is: \n            sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)   [as derived]\n\n        For the example: 2+1=3.\n\n        But the example in the note says 5 operations. \n\n        The note example: \n            Input: \n                1\n                2 1\n\n            Output: \n                5\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        After re-reading the problem statement: \n            \"You goal is to make all white cells contain 0 dolls\"\n\n        And the note: \n            \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n        Why is (1,1) white? \n            For row1: a1=1 -> white if y<1 -> so y=1 is not white. \n        But the note says: \"cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n        This implies that the sequence a is [2,2]? \n\n        The input: \n            n=1\n            a0, a1: the input says \"2 1\"\n\n        So a0=2, a1=1.\n\n        Then the white cells: \n            row0: y<2 -> (0,0), (0,1)\n            row1: y<1 -> (1,0)\n            row2: y<0 -> none.\n\n        So only three white cells.\n\n        But the note says: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white. This implies a0>=2 and a1>=2? \n\n        Let me read the note again: \n            \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white, and all other cells are black.\"\n\n        This implies that a0>=2 and a1>=2? \n\n        The input for the first example is not provided in the note. But the problem statement says: \n            \"The first line of input contains one integer n (1<=n<=200000). The second line of input contains n+1 integers a0,...,an.\"\n\n        The first example has n=1 and a0=2, a1=1? or a0=2, a1=2? \n\n        The example output is 5, so it must be that a0=2 and a1=2. \n\n        Let me try with a0=2, a1=2:\n            White cells: \n                row0: y<2 -> (0,0), (0,1)\n                row1: y<2 -> (1,0), (1,1)\n                row2: y<0 -> none.\n\n            Then the sum: \n                x=0: C(0+2,0+1)=C(2,1)=2\n                x=1: C(1+2,1+1)=C(3,2)=3\n                total=5.\n\n        So the example input is: \n            n=1\n            a0=2, a1=2\n\n        But the input specification says the sequence is non-increasing. [2,2] is non-increasing.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is: \n            ans = 0\n            for i in range(0, n+1):\n                if a[i] > 0:\n                    ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod\n\n        And for the example [2,2]: 2+3=5.\n\n        Now, the provided code in program2.py:\n\n            n,x,d,m,f = int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n            for i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\n            for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n                d += f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\n                x += 1\n            print(d%m)\n\n        We see that the for loop over the input is: \n            for z in list(...): \n                d += ... \n                x += 1\n\n        Here, x starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each term. The input has n+1 integers: a0, a1, ..., an.\n\n        The term: \n            f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n\n        = C(z+x, x+1)   if z!=0, and 0 if z==0.\n\n        But note: z = a_x? and x is the index? \n            For index x, we have a_x = z.\n            Then the term is C(x+z, x+1)   [since z+x = x+z]\n\n        And then we add to d.\n\n        So d is the sum of C(x+a_x, x+1) for x from 0 to n, skipping when a_x==0.\n\n        This matches the solution.\n\n        But we need to precompute the factorial array f up to a sufficiently large size.\n\n        What is the maximum value we need for factorial? \n            The maximum argument: \n                In the combination: C(x+z, x+1) = C(index + a_index, index+1)\n\n            index goes from 0 to n (<=200000) and a_index <= 200000.\n            So the maximum value of the argument in the combination is: \n                index + a_index <= 200000 + 200000 = 400000.\n\n            But we also need to compute factorials up to 400000.\n\n        The code has: \n            for i in range(1,9**6):   # 9**6 = 531441, which is greater than 400000.\n\n        We need to build the factorial array f of size up to 531441? \n\n        So the TODO: we need to compute the factorial array f for i in the range [1, 531440] (since the for loop goes from 1 to 531440 inclusive? because range(1,9**6) goes from 1 to 9**6-1).\n\n        We have f = [1] initially. Then we want:\n            for i in range(1, 9**6):\n                f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n        But note: the initial f = [1] (for 0! = 1). Then we want to extend f to have 531441 elements (from 0 to 531440).\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n        But note: the next part of the code is a for-loop over the input. We must not break the indentation.\n\n        The current code:\n\n            n,x,d,m,f = int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n            for i in range(1,9**6): \n                # we are in this loop, we need to append to f\n                f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n            for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n                d += f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\n                x += 1\n            print(d%m)\n\n        However, note: the combination formula: \n            C(n, k) = f[n] * inv(f[k]) * inv(f[n-k]) mod m.\n\n        In the term: \n            f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1] * f[z-1], m-2, m)\n\n        But note: \n            f[x+1] * f[z-1] is the denominator: we are computing f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) mod m.\n\n        But by the hockey-stick identity, we have: \n            C(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z+x - (x+1)]) = f[z+x]/(f[x+1]*f[z-1])\n\n        So it is correct.\n\n        But what if z==0? then we skip (because (z!=0) gives 0). And if z==0, then we break in the known solution? \n            The known solution: \n                for i in range(0, n+1):\n                    if a[i]==0: break\n            But in our code, we are iterating over all the a's (n+1 of them). However, if we encounter a z=0, we add 0. But then we continue. \n\n        However, the problem: the sequence is non-increasing and after a zero, the rest are zeros? \n            But the input: we are given a0, a1, ... an. And for i>n, a_i=0. But in the input, we have exactly n+1 numbers. \n\n        The problem says: \"for all i>n, a_i=0\". So in the input, we have a0,...,an. And if at some index x (<=n) we have a_x=0, then we should break? \n\n        The known solution breaks when a_x==0 because then the rest of the white cells in that row and beyond are zero? \n\n        But note: the white cells in row x: if a_x==0, then there are no white cells in row x (because y<0 is impossible). And for rows beyond x, we are not given? but the problem says for i>n, a_i=0, so we don't need to consider beyond n.\n\n        However, our code is iterating over the input list (which has n+1 elements). We are not breaking early. But if a_x==0, then the term is 0. And then we do x+=1 and continue. \n\n        But the next term might be non-zero? but the sequence is non-increasing, so if a_x==0, then for j>x, a_j<=0 -> but a_j>=0, so a_j=0. So the terms for j>x will be 0. \n\n        So it is the same.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is to extend the factorial array.\n\n        But note: the factorial array f must be built for indices from 0 up to 531440 (which is 9**6-1). We start with f=[1] (for 0!=1). Then for i from 1 to 531440-1? \n\n        Actually, 9**6 = 531441, so the range(1, 9**6) goes from 1 to 531440. We need factorials for 0 up to 531440. \n\n        We start with f[0]=1. Then for i in [1, 531440]:\n            f[i] = f[i-1] * i % m\n\n        But note: the range(1,9**6) has 531440 iterations. We want to build f[1] to f[531440]. \n\n        So we do:\n            for i in range(1, 9**6):\n                f.append( f[-1] * i % m )\n\n        Then f will have 531441 elements: indices 0 to 531440.\n\n        But note: the combination term: \n            f[z+x] -> we need f for numbers up to 400000, which is less than 531440, so it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n            f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n        But note: the variable name is `f`, and we are appending to the list `f`.\n\n        However, the code has: \n            for i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must write the code in the loop.\n\n        So the completed program2.py code for the loop is:\n\n            for i in range(1,9**6): \n                f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n        But note: the next line is a for-loop over the input. We must not change the indentation.\n\n        However, the provided code has the next for-loop at the same indentation level as the factorial precomputation loop? \n\n        Actually, the provided code:\n\n            for i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\n            for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n\n        This is two consecutive for-loons at the same level. That is valid? \n\n        But the first for-loop will run to completion, then the second for-loop runs.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            for i in range(1,9**6):\n                ...   # the code for the factorial\n\n            for z in ...:\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the body of the first for-loop.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        For program1.py: the missing code is \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n        For program2.py: the missing code is \"f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"\n\n        But note: in program2.py, we are using the variable `f` and we are appending. The initial f is [1]. Then we build the factorial array.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the combination term uses f[z+x] and f[x+1] and f[z-1]. \n\n        What if z-1 is negative? \n            When z==0, we skip. But when z>=1, then z-1>=0. \n            But what if z==1? then z-1=0 -> f[0] exists.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        But note: the term f[z+x] and f[x+1] and f[z-1] are within the precomputed range? \n            The maximum index: \n                z+x: <= 200000 (for a single a_i) + 200000 (for the index) = 400000, and we built up to 531440 -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n          \"program2\": \"f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program1.py code uses a deque. We have to import deque? The code already has: from collections import deque.\n\n        And the program2.py: the factorial array is built for indices 0 to 531440.\n\n        However, in program2.py, the factorial array is built for 0 to 531440, but the combination term uses f[z-1] when z>=1. The smallest z is 0, but then we skip. The next smallest is 1 -> then we use f[0] which is defined.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Let me test with the example [2,2] for program2.py:\n\n            n=1\n            a = [2,2]\n\n            Precomputation: f[0..531440] = factorials mod 10^9+7.\n\n            Then:\n                x=0, z=2: \n                    term = f[2+0] * pow(f[0+1] * f[2-1], mod-2, mod) * 1\n                    = f[2] * pow(f[1]*f[1], mod-2, mod) \n                    = 2 * pow(1*1, mod-2, mod) = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n                Then x becomes 1.\n                Then z=2 (the next number):\n                    term = f[2+1] * pow(f[1+1]*f[2-1], mod-2, mod) * 1\n                    = f[3] * pow(f[2]*f[1], mod-2, mod)\n                    = 6 * pow(2*1, mod-2, mod) = 6 * pow(2, mod-2, mod) mod 10^9+7.\n\n                What is pow(2,10^9+7-2,10^9+7)? \n                    It is the modular inverse of 2 mod 10^9+7, which is (10^9+8)/2 = 500000004.\n\n                So term = 6 * 500000004 mod 10^9+7 = 3.\n\n                Then d = 0+2+3 = 5.\n\n            Then print 5.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n          \"program2\": \"f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"\n        }\n\n        But note: in program2.py, the factorial array is built for i from 1 to 531440. The initial f = [1] (for 0!). Then we build:\n\n            i=1: f[1] = f[0]*1 = 1\n            i=2: f[2] = f[1]*2 = 2\n            i=3: f[3] = 6\n            ...\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the range in the for-loop is range(1,9**6). The value 9**6 is 531441, so the loop runs for i from 1 to 531440. We need factorials up to 531440? and we are building f[0] to f[531440] (since we start with f[0] and then append 531440 times). \n\n        But the maximum index we use is 400000, so it's safe.\n\n        We output the json."
