Alternatively, Operation1: choose index0 and index1: set index0 to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n            Operation2: choose index0 and index1: 0 and 1 -> set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,1]\n            Operation3: choose index0 and index2: 0 and 1 -> set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3.\n\n            How about a different approach? Operation1: choose index0 and index1: set both to min(1,1)=1? but that doesn't help. Or we set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] -> same. So it seems 3 operations. But wait: the problem says: \n                \"If a_i = a_j, change one of them to 0\"\n\n            So we have two choices: we can change either one to 0. Operation1: choose index0 and index1: set index0 to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n            Operation2: choose index1 and index2: set index1 to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: set index2 to 0. Or Operation2: choose index0 and index1: set index1 to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: set index2 to 0. So we cannot avoid 3 operations.

But we can do: Operation1: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 2 -> then we need two operations: \n                    Operation2: choose 0 and 1 -> set 1 to 0 -> [0,0,2]\n                    Operation3: choose 0 and 2 -> set 2 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3.\n\n            How about a different way for [1,1,2]:\n                Operation1: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> 3 operations total. But note: we can do:\n                Operation1: choose the 1 and 2 -> set both to 1 -> [1,1,1] -> then we have three 1's -> then we can set one to 0 in the next operation -> [0,1,1] -> then set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then set the last to 0 -> 4 operations. So the minimum is 3. Therefore, the formula holds. But wait: what if we have more than one duplicate? Example: [1,1,2,2] (n=4, no zero, and has duplicates) -> then answer = 4? \n                Operation1: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,2,2] \n                Operation2: set one 2 to 0 -> [0,1,0,2] \n                Operation3: set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,0,2] \n                Operation4: set the 2 to 0 -> [0,0,0,0] -> 4 operations. Alternatively, we can do:\n                Operation1: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,2,2] \n                Operation2: set the two 2's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,0,2] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 2 -> then two more operations -> total 4. But note: we can use the zeros we create to clear the rest? Operation1: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,2,2] \n                Operation2: use the zero and the 1: set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,2,2] \n                Operation3: set one 2 to 0 -> [0,0,0,2] \n                Operation4: set the last 2 to 0 -> 4.\n\n            How about:\n                Operation1: set one 2 to 0 -> [1,1,0,2] \n                Operation2: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,0,2] \n                then two more -> 4.

Given the complexity, and since the problem constraints are small (n<=100), we can simply break after the first reduction and then continue popping without checking? But the while loop condition is while a: so we must pop until empty. How about we do: \n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = -1   # mark that we have used the reduction, but then the final expression: \n                then the final expression: \n                    if c was initially 0 and we set c=-1, then the term (a==[] and c==0) is (True and ( -1==0 )) -> false. and -c = -(-1)=1, so the expression: b + 0 - (-1) = b+1.

Expression: 2 + (True and ( -1==0 )) - (-1) = 2+0+1=3. But [1,2,2] has n=3, and we want 3 operations? -> matches.

    "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first problem involves maximizing the sum of values from partitioning an array optimally, while the second problem involves maximizing the number of dirty cells left in a grid such that a cleaning robot can clean them without malfunctioning. \n\n### Solution for Program1.py\nThe goal is to partition an array into contiguous subarrays such that the sum of the values of these subarrays is maximized. The value of a subarray is defined based on the sum of its elements: positive sum gives the length of the subarray, negative sum gives the negative of the length, and zero sum gives zero. \n\n#### Approach\n1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Compute the prefix sums of the array to facilitate efficient sum queries over subarrays.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of values achievable for the first `i` elements.\n3. **Efficient Updates with Data Structures**: Utilize a Fenwick tree (or segment tree) to efficiently compute the maximum values required for the DP transitions. Specifically:\n   - **Fenwick Tree for Lesser Prefix Sums**: Tracks `dp[j] - j` for indices `j` where the prefix sum is less than the current prefix sum.\n   - **Fenwick Tree for Greater Prefix Sums**: Tracks `dp[j] + j` for indices `j` where the prefix sum is greater than the current prefix sum.\n   - **Dictionary for Equal Prefix Sums**: Maintains the maximum `dp[j]` for indices `j` with the same prefix sum as the current index.\n4. **DP Transition**: For each position `i`, compute `dp[i]` by considering three cases based on the relationship between the current prefix sum and previous prefix sums:\n   - If the current prefix sum is greater, use `i + max(dp[j] - j)`.\n   - If equal, use the stored value from the dictionary.\n   - If lesser, use `-i + max(dp[j] + j)`.\n5. **Update Data Structures**: After computing each `dp[i]`, update the Fenwick trees and the dictionary to include the new value.\n\n#### Solution Code for Program1.py\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n}\n```\n\n### Solution for Program2.py\nThe goal is to maximize the number of dirty cells left in a 2xN grid such that a cleaning robot can clean all dirty cells without encountering multiple closest dirty cells at any step, which would cause a malfunction.\n\n#### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP table `f[i][j]` where `i` represents the column index and `j` the row index (0 or 1). The value `f[i][j]` stores the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left from column `i` onwards when the robot is at cell `(j, i)`.\n2. **Initialization**: Start with `f[0][0] = 0` since the robot begins at the clean cell `(0, 0)`.\n3. **DP Transitions**:\n   - **Same Row Next Column**: Move to the next column in the same row, updating the DP state if the next cell is left dirty.\n   - **Other Row Same Column**: If the other row in the current column is dirty, move to it and increment the count of dirty cells cleaned by the robot.\n4. **Result Extraction**: The result is the maximum value between `f[n][0]` and `f[n][1]`, representing the robot ending at either row after processing all columns.\n\n#### Solution Code for Program2.py\n```json\n{\n  \"program2\": \"                f[i][j^1] = max(f[i][j^1], f[i][j] + 1)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1.py**: The solution efficiently computes the optimal partition using dynamic programming enhanced with Fenwick trees for range maximum queries. The key insight is leveraging prefix sums and maintaining separate data structures for different prefix sum comparisons to achieve optimal performance.\n- **Program2.py**: The solution uses dynamic programming to explore all possible paths the robot can take while ensuring no ties in the closest dirty cell at any step. The transitions account for moving right in the same row or switching rows in the same column, updating the count of dirty cells left accordingly. The result ensures the maximum dirty cells are left without causing the robot to malfunction.",

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\nThe initial approach in the code uses a global variable `ans` and an `update` function.\nThe idea is to note that the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1].\n\nTherefore, the total sum over all contiguous subarrays can be expressed as:\n  Total = (number of subarrays) + (for each adjacent pair (i, i+1), the number of subarrays that include this adjacent pair and for which a[i] != a[i+1] contributes 1)\n\nBut note: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] = 1 + (# of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1]).\n\nSo, the total sum is:\n  Sum_{l=1}^{n} Sum_{r=l}^{n} [1 + (# of indices j from l to r-1 with a[j]!=a[j+1])]\n= (n*(n+1)//2) + Sum_{j=1}^{n-1} [ (# of subarrays that include the adjacent pair (j, j+1)) * I(a[j]!=a[j+1]) ]\n\nHow many subarrays include the adjacent pair (j, j+1)? \nThe subarray must start at any index from 1 to j and end at any index from j+1 to n.\nSo, that is j * (n - j) [if we use 0-indexing: then for index j (0-indexed) the adjacent pair is (j, j+1), then the number of subarrays that include this pair is (j+1) * (n - j - 1) ???]\n\nBut note: in the provided code, the update function does:\n  if a[i] == a[i+1]:\n      ans += t * (i+1)   [but note: i is 0-indexed?]\n  else:\n      ans += t * (n - i) * (i+1)\n\nWait, let me check the example: \n  n=5, a = [1,2,2,4,5]\n\nWe are going to consider adjacent pairs at indices 0,1,2,3.\n\nFor adjacent pair at index0 (between a0 and a1): \n  They are 1 and 2 -> different -> so it contributes (n-0) * (0+1) = 5 * 1 = 5? \nBut in the example, the total is 29.\n\nAlternatively, note that the total sum can be expressed as:\n  Total = n*(n+1)//2 + (for each adjacent index i, if a[i]!=a[i+1] then the number of subarrays that cross this boundary is (i+1) * (n-i-1))\n\nBut then the base total would be: \n  base = 15 (for n=5: 5*6//2 = 15) \n  plus the contributions from boundaries:\n\nBoundary at index0 (between 1 and 2): different -> contributes 1 * (5-1) = 1*4 = 4\nBoundary at index1 (between 2 and 2): same -> contributes 0\nBoundary at index2 (between 2 and 4): different -> contributes (2+1) * (5-2-1) = 3 * 2 = 6\nBoundary at index3 (between 4 and 5): different -> contributes (3+1) * (5-3-1) = 4 * 1 = 4\nTotal = 15 + 4+0+6+4 = 29 -> matches.\n\nSo the formula for the total sum is:\n  ans = n*(n+1)//2 + (for each adjacent index i from 0 to n-2) [ (i+1)*(n-i-1) if a[i]!=a[i+1] else 0 ]\n\nBut wait, the code in the update function does:\n  if a[i] == a[i+1]:\n      ans += t * (i+1)\n  else:\n      ans += t * (n - i) * (i+1)\n\nThis does not match the above formula.\n\nAlternatively, let me read the code:\n\nThe initial `ans` is 0, then we call update(i,1) for each i in [0, n-1].\n\nFor i=0: \n  if a[0]==a[1]? -> 1==2? no -> so add (n-0)*(0+1) = 5*1 = 5\nFor i=1: \n  a[1]==a[2]? 2==2 -> yes -> add (1+1)=2\nFor i=2: \n  a[2]==a[3]? 2==4? no -> add (n-2)*(2+1)=3*3=9\nFor i=3: \n  a[3]==a[4]? 4==5? no -> add (n-3)*(3+1)=2*4=8\nTotal = 5+2+9+8 = 24 -> but expected base is 29? \n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, note that the example does not use the base n*(n+1)//2. The entire total is computed by the update function.\n\nBut observe: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 (for the first element) plus 1 for every index j in [l, r-1] where a[j]!=a[j+1]. \nBut note: the first element is always a block. Then every time we have a change we get an extra block.\n\nSo the total number of blocks over all subarrays is:\n  = (# of subarrays) + (# of adjacent pairs (j, j+1) that are different and that are included in the subarray)\n\nBut note: the first term is the base 1 per subarray. The second term is the number of adjacent pairs (j, j+1) that are different and that are included in the subarray.\n\nSo total = n*(n+1)//2 + (for each adjacent pair j (0-indexed) that is different, the number of subarrays that include j and j+1 is (j+1) * (n - j - 1))\n\nBut the code does:\n\n  if a[i] == a[i+1]:\n      ans += t * (i+1)\n  else:\n      ans += t * (n - i) * (i+1)\n\nThis does not look like (j+1)*(n-j-1) for the adjacent pair at j.\n\nWait, the update function is called for every index i from 0 to n-1. But note: the adjacent pair at index i is between a[i] and a[i+1]. So we must not call update for i = n-1? \n\nIn the initial loop: we call update(i,1) for i in [0, n-1]. But when i = n-1, we check i+1 < n? -> no, so we do the else branch: add (n - (n-1)) * (n-1+1) = 1 * n = n.\n\nBut in the example, n=5, so for i=4 (last element) we add 5. \n\nSo the initial total for the example is:\n  i0: 5*1 = 5\n  i1: 2 (because same) -> 1+1 = 2? but the code adds (i+1)=2 -> so 2\n  i2: 3*3=9\n  i3: 2*4=8\n  i4: 1*5=5\nTotal = 5+2+9+8+5 = 29 -> matches.\n\nSo the formula per index i (0-indexed) is:\n  For an index i, if i is not the last element and a[i]==a[i+1], then we add (i+1) [but note: the code condition is \"if i+1 < n and a[i]==a[i+1]\"]\n  Otherwise, we add (n-i) * (i+1)\n\nBut why?\n\nLet me break down:\n\nThe total awesomeness over all subarrays can be expressed as the sum over indices i of the contribution of the element at position i as the start of a block.\n\nHow many subarrays have a block starting at position i?\n  - The block starting at i: it will be broken by a change at i (if we look to the right) until the next change. But note: the block starting at i might be the first block in the subarray, or it might be a later block. \n\nAlternatively, we can think of the contribution of each adjacent pair and the contribution of the entire array.\n\nBut note: the provided method is known in problems as \"contribution technique\".\n\nAnother known solution for this exact problem (from past contests) is:\n\n  ans = n\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i-1]) * i * (n - i)\n\nBut that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, known solution for \"Sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays\" is:\n\n  total = n*(n+1)//2   # because each subarray has at least one block\n  for i in range(n-1):\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          total += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\nBut that gives 15 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 29.\n\nBut the code in the update function does:\n\n  if (i+1 < n and a[i] == a[i+1]):\n      ans += t * (i+1)\n  else:\n      ans += t * (n-i) * (i+1)\n\nAnd when we run for the example, we get 29.\n\nHow does this formula work?\n\nConsider the contribution of the element at position i:\n\n- If the element at i is the same as the element at i+1, then when the subarray ends at i (so the last element is i) then the block that starts at i (if it is the last block) is not broken by the next element? \n\nActually, the problem can be rephrased: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 (for the first element) and then for each position j from l to r-1, we get an extra block if a[j] != a[j+1]. \n\nBut note: the first element always starts a block. Then every time we have a change we get a new block.\n\nSo the total blocks = 1 + (# of changes in the subarray).\n\nTherefore, the total over all subarrays = (# of subarrays) + (# of pairs (j, j+1) that are different and that lie in the subarray).\n\nSo the first term is n*(n+1)//2.\n\nThe second term: for a fixed adjacent pair (j, j+1) that is different, how many subarrays include this pair? \n  - The subarray must start at any index from 0 to j, and end at any index from j+1 to n-1 -> (j+1) * (n-1-j).\n\nBut in the code, the update function is called for every index i (from 0 to n-1). \n\nFor an index i:\n  - If i is the last element (i = n-1), then it cannot form a pair with the next. But note: the last element is always the end of a block. How does the last element contribute? \n\nActually, the code does:\n\n  For the last element (i = n-1): \n      since i+1 < n is false, so we do: (n - i) * (i+1) = (n - (n-1)) * (n) = 1 * n = n.\n\nBut note: the base term (the 1 per subarray) is not computed separately. How is the entire total built?\n\nLet me compute the total for the example by the code:\n\n  i=0: a[0]!=a[1] -> add (5-0)*(0+1)=5\n  i=1: a[1]==a[2] -> add (1+1)=2\n  i=2: a[2]!=a[3] -> add (5-2)*(2+1)=3*3=9\n  i=3: a[3]!=a[4] -> add (5-3)*(3+1)=2*4=8\n  i=4: (last element) -> add (5-4)*(4+1)=1*5=5\n  Total = 5+2+9+8+5 = 29.\n\nNow, what does 29 represent? It is the entire total.\n\nBut note: the base term (the 1 per subarray) is 15. The rest 14 comes from the adjacent pairs? \n\nBut we have 3 adjacent pairs that are different (0, 2, 3) and they contribute: \n  i=0: 1*4 = 4\n  i=2: 3*2 = 6\n  i=3: 4*1 = 4 -> total 14.\n\nSo the base term 15 and the 14 from adjacent pairs gives 29.\n\nBut in the code, the base term is not added separately. How do we get 15? \n\nActually, the code adds for each index i:\n\n  For the last element: n (which is 5) -> that is the base for the last element? \n\nAlternatively, we can interpret the formula as:\n\n  The total = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [ (n-i) * (i+1) ] \n            - for each adjacent pair that is the same, we subtract the contribution that we would have if they were different and then add a fixed amount?\n\nBut that doesn't seem.\n\nAlternatively, note:\n\n  The term (n-i)*(i+1) for an index i is the number of subarrays that include the element i? \n\nYes! The number of subarrays that include the element at index i is (i+1) * (n-i). \n\nSo if we do that for every element, we get the total number of elements in all subarrays? \n\nBut we want the total blocks. \n\nHow is the total blocks related to the elements? \n\nEach element that is the start of a block in a subarray contributes 1. \n\nHow many subarrays have a block starting at position i?\n  - The block starting at i: it must be that either i is the start of the subarray or a[i-1] != a[i] (if i is not the start). \n\nBut note: the start of the subarray always starts a block. Then a block starts at i in a subarray [l, r] if:\n   - l <= i <= r\n   - and (i is the first element of the subarray, i.e., l = i) OR (a[i-1] != a[i] and the subarray includes i-1 and i).\n\nBut the condition for a block starting at i is independent of the right part? \n\nActually, the block starting at i will be present in a subarray [l, r] if:\n   - l <= i <= r\n   - and (l = i OR a[i-1] != a[i]) [if l<=i-1 then we require a[i-1]!=a[i] to break the block so that a[i] starts a new block]\n\nSo the number of subarrays that have a block starting at i is:\n   - If i is the first element (i=0) then every subarray that starts at 0 and ends at any r>=0 -> n subarrays.\n   - If i>0 and a[i-1] != a[i], then the subarray must start at any index from 0 to i (but if it starts at an index <= i-1, then we require that the subarray does not break the condition? Actually, the condition is: the subarray must include i and must not include the element i-1? No, it can include i-1 but then we require a[i-1]!=a[i]. \n\nBut note: the block starting at i is independent of the left part as long as the left part does not merge with i. So the subarray must start at an index l such that l <= i and the element immediately to the left of i (if present) is either not in the subarray or is different. \n\nActually, the block at i is present if the subarray starts at i or if the subarray starts at some l < i and a[i-1] != a[i]. \n\nSo the number of subarrays that have a block starting at i is:\n   - If i==0: n\n   - If i>0: \n          if a[i-1] != a[i]: then the subarray can start anywhere from 0 to i -> (i+1) choices for the start, and the end can be from i to n-1 -> (n-i) choices -> total (i+1)*(n-i)\n          if a[i-1] == a[i]: then the subarray must start at i (so that the element i is the first element of the subarray) -> then the number of subarrays is (n-i) [because the start is fixed at i, and the end can be from i to n-1]\n\nBut wait, that matches the code:\n\n  if (i+1 < n and a[i] == a[i+1]): \n      -> This condition is for the next element? But we are looking at the previous element? \n\nActually, the code condition is about the next element (i and i+1). But we are talking about the previous element (i-1 and i). \n\nSo the code condition is not about the previous element but the next. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be considering the block starting at i as being broken by the next element? \n\nBut note: the block starting at i will be broken at the next change? \n\nI think the code is using a different idea: \n\n  The total blocks = (# of subarrays) + (# of adjacent pairs (j, j+1) that are different and that are included in the subarray) \n  = n*(n+1)//2 + sum_{j=0}^{n-2} [ (a[j]!=a[j+1]) * (j+1)*(n-1-j) ]\n\nBut the code does:\n\n  For each index i (0-indexed) we add:\n      if i is not the last and a[i]==a[i+1]: then we add (i+1)\n      else: we add (n-i)*(i+1)\n\nBut note: \n  (n-i)*(i+1) = (i+1)*(n-i)\n\nAnd if we break the total into the base and the adjacent pairs:\n\n  total = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (n-i)*(i+1) \n         - for each adjacent pair j (from 0 to n-2) that is the same, we subtract (j+1)*(n-1-j) and then add (j+1) ??? \n\nThat doesn't seem to add up.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  total = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (n-i)*(i+1) \n         - for each adjacent pair j (from 0 to n-2) that is the same, we subtract [ (j+1)*(n-1-j) - (j+1) ]\n\nBut (j+1)*(n-1-j) - (j+1) = (j+1)*(n-2-j)\n\nBut that doesn't match the example.\n\nI think the intended interpretation is:\n\n  The total blocks = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [ (number of subarrays that include i) ] \n                   - sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [ (a[i]==a[i+1]) * (number of subarrays that include both i and i+1 and in which the block is not broken at i) ]\n\nBut that is complicated.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the code matches the example, we trust the update function.\n\nNow, the problem: we have to update the array and recalc the total after each query.\n\nThe update function is called with a multiplier t (either 1 or -1) to add or remove the contribution of an index.\n\nWhen we update an element at position i, it can affect:\n  - The adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1)\n\nSo we must remove the contributions of the adjacent pairs that are changing, then update the array, then add the new contributions.\n\nThe code does:\n\n  for q in range(m):\n      i, x = inp()\n      i -= 1\n\n      if(i >= 0):   # This condition is always true? because i>=0. But note: i is from 0 to n-1. \n          # But the code has an empty if block. We must fill in.\n\n      Then it does:\n          update(i, -1)   # remove the contribution of index i (which currently is the old value)\n\n      Then sets a[i] = x\n\n      Then if(i>=0): update(i-1, 1)   # but note: update(i-1,1) would update the adjacent pair (i-1, i) and also the adjacent pair (i-2, i-1) ??? \n\n      Then update(i, 1)   # add the contribution of index i with the new value\n\n      Then print(ans)\n\nBut wait, the update function is for an index i. What does updating index i do?\n\nThe update function for index i:\n   - It checks the adjacent pair at i: (i, i+1) if i is not the last.\n   - But also, the adjacent pair at i-1: (i-1, i) is not checked in update(i)!\n\nSo the update function for index i only updates the adjacent pair that starts at i (i.e., (i, i+1)) and also the condition for the last element.\n\nBut the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is updated when we call update(i-1). \n\nTherefore, when we change a[i], we must update:\n   - The adjacent pair (i-1, i): which is the responsibility of index i-1 (so we call update(i-1) to remove the old and then add the new)\n   - The adjacent pair (i, i+1): which is the responsibility of index i (so we call update(i) to remove the old and then add the new)\n\nBut note: the update function for an index i also includes the contribution for the last element? \n\nYes, for the last element (i = n-1) we do the else branch.\n\nSo the plan for an update at index i:\n\n  Step 1: Remove the contribution of index i (which currently is the old value) -> call update(i, -1)\n  Step 2: Also, the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is stored in index i-1. So we must remove the contribution of index i-1? \n          But note: if we change a[i], then the adjacent pair (i-1, i) changes. So we must remove the contribution of index i-1 (if i-1 exists) and then later add it back.\n\nSimilarly, the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is stored in index i, so we are going to remove and then add back when we update index i.\n\nBut the code currently does:\n\n  update(i, -1)   -> removes the contribution of index i (which includes the adjacent pair (i, i+1) and the last element condition for i)\n\n  Then sets a[i] = x\n\n  Then if(i>=0): update(i-1, 1)   -> but note: i>=0 is always true? because i>=0. Actually, i is at least 0. But we should check if i-1 is in range.\n\n  Then update(i, 1)\n\nBut we also need to remove the contribution of index i-1 (if exists) because the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is stored at index i-1. Then after updating a[i], we add back the contribution of index i-1.\n\nSo the missing part is: we must also remove the contribution of index i-1 (if i-1>=0) before updating a[i]? \n\nBut the code does:\n\n  if(i>=0):   # This is always true, but we want to update the adjacent pair (i-1, i) which is stored at index i-1.\n\n  Currently, the code does nothing in the if block. We must remove the contribution of index i-1 (if i-1>=0) and then later we add it back.\n\nSo the corrected steps:\n\n  Step 1: Remove the contribution of index i-1 (if i-1>=0) because the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is about to change.\n  Step 2: Remove the contribution of index i (because the adjacent pair (i, i+1) and the last element condition for i are about to change, and also the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is stored at i-1 but we already removed that? Actually, we removed the old state of (i-1, i) at step1, and we will add the new state after update?).\n\n  Step 3: Update a[i] = x.\n\n  Step 4: Add the contribution of index i-1 (if i-1>=0) because the adjacent pair (i-1, i) has changed.\n  Step 5: Add the contribution of index i.\n\nBut the code currently does:\n\n  if(i>=0):   # we are going to do something? Actually, we are going to remove the adjacent pair (i-1, i) stored at index i-1? \n\n  Then update(i, -1)\n\n  Then set a[i]=x\n\n  Then if(i>=0): update(i-1, 1)   # this is step4: add back index i-1? But note: we haven't removed index i-1 in the first if block? \n\nSo we must remove index i-1 in the first if block.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the first if block is: remove the contribution of index i-1 (if i-1>=0) by calling update(i-1, -1).\n\nBut note: the condition i>=0 is always true, but we want to remove index i-1 only if i-1>=0, i.e., i>0.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n  if i > 0: \n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut the condition in the code is written as:\n\n  if(i >= 0):   # This condition is always true because i>=0. But we want to do something only if i-1 is valid, i.e., i>=1.\n\nSo we change the condition to check for i>=1? \n\nBut the code says:\n\n  if(i >= 0):   # then do something? \n\nWe can do:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the condition is written as \"if(i>=0)\", which is always true. We must change the condition? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\nSo we are to fill in the missing block under the first \"if(i>=0):\". \n\nWe can do:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the next step is to remove index i. Then after updating, we add index i-1 and then index i.\n\nSo the complete update for a query (i, x) is:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)   # remove the old contribution of index i-1 (which includes the adjacent pair (i-1, i) in the old state)\n\n  update(i, -1)         # remove the old contribution of index i\n\n  a[i] = x\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, 1)    # add the new contribution of index i-1\n\n  update(i, 1)          # add the new contribution of index i\n\nBut note: the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is stored at index i. When we remove index i, we remove the adjacent pair (i, i+1) and the last element condition for i. Then when we update a[i], we add back the adjacent pair (i, i+1) and the last element condition for i.\n\nAlso, the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is stored at index i-1. We remove the old state and then add the new state.\n\nBut what about the adjacent pair (i+1, i+2)? It is stored at index i+1. Changing a[i] does not affect the adjacent pair (i+1, i+2) directly. However, the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is stored at index i, and we are updating index i. The adjacent pair (i+1, i+2) is stored at index i+1 and is not affected by a[i] (only a[i+1] and a[i+2] matter). So we don't need to update index i+1.\n\nBut wait: the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is stored at index i. The adjacent pair (i+1, i+2) is stored at index i+1. When we change a[i], it affects the adjacent pair (i, i+1) (so we update index i) and the adjacent pair (i-1, i) (so we update index i-1). It does not affect the adjacent pair (i+1, i+2) because that pair does not involve a[i]. However, it does affect the adjacent pair (i+1, i+2) if i+1 is the last element? No, because the last element condition for index i+1 is independent of a[i]. \n\nBut note: the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is stored at index i. The adjacent pair (i+1, i+2) is stored at index i+1. So we don't need to update index i+1.\n\nHowever, there is one more: the element at i+1 might be the last element? Then the contribution of index i+1 is (n - (i+1)) * (i+2) [if we are in the else branch] and that does not depend on a[i]. So it's safe.\n\nBut what about the adjacent pair (i, i+1) for the index i+1? It is stored at index i, not at index i+1. \n\nTherefore, the update for index i and i-1 is sufficient.\n\nSo the missing code in the first if block is:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the condition in the code is \"if(i>=0):\", which is always true. We want to do the removal only if i>0. So we can write:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut the condition is written as \"if(i>=0):\", so we can put:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the code after the if block does update(i, -1). So we must not remove index i-1 if i==0.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The block we are to fill is under the line \"if(i >= 0):\" and before \"update(i, -1)\".\n\nSo we write:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n\n  if(i >= 0):   # TODO: Your code here\n\n  update(i, -1)\n\nWe are to fill the TODO block.\n\nSo we write:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the condition \"if(i>=0)\" is redundant because i>=0 always. But we are using it to check for i>0? \n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut the condition \"if(i>=0)\" is already there, so we can nest:\n\n  if i >= 0:   # always true\n      if i > 0:\n          update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut that is equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the condition to if i>0? But the problem says we are to fill the block, so we write:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the code after the block is update(i,-1). So we must not do anything else.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py the missing code is:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nBut note: the example update in the problem: \n  The first query: i=1 (0-indexed i=0) and x=2? \n  Actually, the example input: \n      n=5, m=?\n      a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]   (from the example note: after first query a=[1,2,2,4,5] -> so the initial array is not given? \n\nBut the example input: \n  \"5 3\n   1 1 2 2 4\n   2 5\n   4 3\n   5 1\"\n\nBut the problem says: after the first query a = [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the first query is i=2 (1-indexed) to change to 5? \n\nWait, the problem says: \n  \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\nAnd the input: \n  5 3\n  1 1 2 2 4\n  2 5\n  4 3\n  5 1\n\nSo the first query: i=2 (1-indexed) -> so index1 (0-indexed) is set to 5? \n  Then the array becomes [1,5,2,2,4] -> not [1,2,2,4,5].\n\nActually, the example note says: \n  \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\nBut the input array is [1,1,2,2,4] and the first query is \"2 5\", meaning set the element at index2 (1-indexed) to 5 -> so set a[1] (0-indexed) to 5 -> [1,5,2,2,4]. \n\nThis does not match the example note. \n\nBut the example note says: \n  \"after each query you need to calculate ... and the first answer is 29\"\n\nAnd the example input says:\n  \"5 3\n   1 1 2 2 4\n   2 5\n   4 3\n   5 1\"\n\nSo the first query: i=2 (1-indexed) -> index1 (0-indexed) set to 5 -> [1,5,2,2,4]\n\nWe must compute the total for [1,5,2,2,4] and get 29? \n\nBut the example note says the array is [1,2,2,4,5] and the total is 29.\n\nSo there is a discrepancy. \n\nBut the problem statement says: \n  \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\nSo the initial array might be different? \n\nGiven the complexity, we trust the update procedure we designed.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py the missing code is:\n\n  if i > 0:\n      update(i-1, -1)\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nDescription: \n  Tokitsukaze has a sequence a. Operation: select two distinct indices i and j.\n      If a_i = a_j, then change one of them to 0.\n      Otherwise, change both to min(a_i, a_j).\n  We want the minimum number of operations to change all numbers to 0.\n\nExample: \n  Input: \n      3\n      1 2 3\n  Output: \n      4\n\n  Steps: \n      Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> since 1 != 2, change both to 1 -> [1,1,3]\n      Operation2: choose the two 1's -> change one to 0 -> [0,1,3]\n      Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> but note: we cannot choose 0? because then we would change both to min(0,1)=0? \n          However, the operation says: if they are not equal, change both to min. So [0,0,3]\n      Operation4: choose 0 and 3 -> [0,0,0]\n\n  But the example says 4.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \n  In the first test case, one of the possible ways: \n      Operation1: a1 and a2: 1 and 2 -> change to 1 and 1 -> [1,1,3]\n      Operation2: a1 and a2: 1 and 1 -> change one to 0 -> [0,1,3]\n      Operation3: a1 and a2: 0 and 1 -> change both to 0 -> [0,0,3]\n      Operation4: a2 and a3: 0 and 3 -> change both to 0 -> [0,0,0]\n\nBut note: in operation3, we can choose a1 and a2: 0 and 1 -> then change both to min(0,1)=0 -> [0,0,3] (so we set the 1 to 0).\n\nThe problem: we are to compute the minimum number of operations.\n\nWe note:\n  - We can always change two distinct numbers to zeros in one operation if one of them is zero? \n        If we have (0, x) with x>0, then we change both to 0 -> so we can clear one non-zero per operation if we have a zero.\n\n  - How to create zeros? \n        Option1: by having two equal non-zero numbers: then we can set one of them to 0 in one operation.\n        Option2: by having a zero and a non-zero: then we can set the non-zero to 0 in one operation (and the zero remains 0).\n\n  - Also, we can change two distinct non-zeros to the minimum of the two. This might create duplicates? \n\nStrategy:\n\n  We want to minimize the operations.\n\n  Let c0 = count of zeros initially.\n\n  We can break the process:\n      Step 1: create zeros as efficiently as possible.\n      Step 2: use zeros to clear the rest.\n\n  How many operations do we need to clear the entire array?\n      - Each operation can create at most one zero? \n          - If we choose two non-zeros that are equal: we can set one to zero -> one zero created.\n          - If we choose two non-zeros that are distinct: we set both to the minimum, which doesn't create a zero? \n          - But then we can use the zeros we have to clear the rest.\n\n  However, the operation on two distinct non-zeros does not create a zero. So we must avoid that? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a known solution:\n\n      Let distinct = number of distinct non-zero numbers.\n\n      Let freq = frequency of the most frequent non-zero number.\n\n      Then the answer = (number of non-zero elements) + max(0, freq - 1) - 1   ??? \n\n  But the example: [1,2,3] -> non-zero elements=3, distinct=3, freq=1 -> then 3 + max(0,1-1)-1 = 3+0-1=2 -> not 4.\n\n  Another known solution from similar problems:\n\n      We note that if there is a zero initially, then we can clear the rest in (number of non-zeros) operations.\n\n      Without any zero initially:\n          - We need to create a zero. \n          - How? We can create a zero by having two equal numbers: then we set one to zero in one operation. Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros -> then we clear the rest in (n-1) operations? total = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n          - But what if there are no duplicates? \n                Then we cannot create a zero in one operation. \n                We can do: \n                    Operation1: choose two distinct numbers, say a and b (a<b), then set both to a -> now we have two a's (if we choose two that become the same) and then we can set one to zero in the next operation.\n                    Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros -> then we clear the rest in (n-2) operations? \n                Total = 1 (to create two same) + 1 (to create a zero) + (n-2) = n.\n\n          - But wait: after the first operation we have two a's and the rest unchanged. Then we set one a to zero -> then we have one zero and one a and the rest. Then we use the zero to clear the rest one by one: each non-zero takes one operation. So the total operations = 1 (first op) + 1 (second op) + (n-2) = n.\n\n          - However, if we have duplicates initially, then we can create a zero in one operation and then clear the rest in (n-1) operations -> total = n.\n\n          - But the example: [1,2,3] (no duplicates and no zero) -> then total = 3? but the example says 4.\n\n      Why 4? \n          Operation1: (1,2) -> [1,1,3]  (operation1: two distinct -> set both to min=1)\n          Operation2: (1,1) -> [0,1,3]   (operation2: two equal -> set one to 0)\n          Operation3: (0,1) -> [0,0,3]   (operation3: zero and non-zero -> set non-zero to 0)\n          Operation4: (0,3) -> [0,0,0]   (operation4: zero and non-zero -> set non-zero to 0)\n\n      So 4 operations.\n\n      How does n=3 lead to 4? \n\n      Actually, the formula might be: \n          If there is at least one duplicate in the non-zero numbers (and no zero initially) then we can create a zero in one operation and then clear the rest in (n-1) operations -> total = n.\n          If there is no duplicate and no zero initially, then we need an extra operation to create a duplicate? so total = n+1.\n\n      But in the example: n=3, no duplicate and no zero -> then 3+1 = 4.\n\n      Let me test with n=2: \n          [1,2] (no duplicate, no zero) -> \n            Operation1: set both to 1 -> [1,1] -> then Operation2: set one to 0 -> [0,1] -> then Operation3: set the last to 0 -> [0,0] -> 3 operations.\n          But n=2 -> 2+1=3 -> matches.\n\n      Another test: [1,1] (duplicate, no zero) -> \n          Operation1: set one to 0 -> [0,1] -> then Operation2: set the 1 to 0 -> 2 operations = n.\n\n      Another test: [0,1] (one zero) -> \n          Operation1: set the 1 to 0 -> 1 operation = n-1? but n=2 -> 1 operation, but we have one non-zero -> so we need 1 operation.\n\n      How to incorporate the initial zeros?\n\n      Let:\n        c0 = count of zeros initially.\n        Let non_zero = n - c0.\n\n        If there is at least one zero initially, then we can clear the non-zero elements in non_zero operations (each non-zero can be cleared in one operation by pairing with a zero).\n\n        But what if there are duplicates in the non-zero part? It doesn't matter because we have a zero to use.\n\n        So if c0>0: answer = non_zero.\n\n        If c0==0:\n            If there is at least one duplicate in the non-zero numbers: then we can create a zero in one operation and then clear the rest in (non_zero-1) operations? \n                But note: after creating a zero, we have one zero and non_zero-1 non-zeros? \n                Actually, when we create a zero, we set one element to zero. The other element we set to the same value? (if they were equal) or to the min (if distinct) but we are creating a duplicate? \n\n            Actually, if there is a duplicate, we can do:\n                Operation1: take two equal non-zeros and set one to zero -> now we have one zero and the rest non-zeros (and one of the non-zeros is the same as before, but one less) -> then we clear the rest non-zeros in (non_zero-1) operations? \n                Total = 1 + (non_zero-1) = non_zero.\n\n            But wait: non_zero = n (since c0=0). So total = n.\n\n            If there is no duplicate, then we need to create a duplicate first? \n                Operation1: take two distinct non-zeros and set both to the min -> now we have a duplicate (the min value appears twice) and the rest unchanged -> then we can create a zero in the next operation: \n                Operation2: take the two duplicates and set one to zero -> then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros -> then we clear the rest in (non_zero-2) operations? \n                Total = 1 (to create duplicate) + 1 (to create zero) + (non_zero-2) = non_zero = n.\n\n            But the example [1,2,3] (n=3) -> non_zero=3, no duplicate -> then total = 3? but we did 4.\n\n            What's the catch?\n\n            After operation1: [1,1,3] -> non_zero=3? but we have two 1's and one 3 -> then operation2: we can set one of the 1's to zero -> [0,1,3] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 3 -> then we need two more operations: \n                operation3: set 1 to 0 (using the existing zero) -> [0,0,3]\n                operation4: set 3 to 0 -> [0,0,0]\n            So total=4.\n\n            Therefore, the formula for no initial zero:\n                If there is at least one duplicate: then we can do in n operations.\n                If there is no duplicate: then we need n+1 operations.\n\n            But wait: in the no duplicate case, we did:\n                Operation1: create a duplicate -> now we have n-1 distinct non-zeros? no, we have n-1 non-zeros? \n                Actually, we set two distinct numbers to the same value -> so we reduce the count of distinct numbers by at least one? and we don't reduce the total non-zero count? \n\n            After operation1: we still have n non-zeros? because we set two to the min -> so we have two min values and the rest unchanged -> total non-zeros = n.\n\n            Then operation2: we set one of the duplicates to zero -> now we have n-1 non-zeros and one zero.\n\n            Then we clear the n-1 non-zeros in n-1 operations (each one with the zero) -> total = 1+1+(n-1) = n+1.\n\n            So the formula: \n                if there is at least one zero initially: answer = non_zero (which is n - c0)\n                else:\n                    if there is a duplicate in the non-zero numbers: answer = n\n                    else: answer = n+1\n\n            Example: \n                [1,2,3]: n=3, no duplicate -> 3+1=4 -> matches.\n                [1,1,2]: n=3, has duplicate -> 3 -> \n                    Operation1: set one of the 1's to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> then 2 operations to clear the 1 and 2 -> total=3 -> matches.\n\n            But what about [1,2,2]? \n                n=3, has duplicate -> 3 operations.\n                Operation1: set one of the 2's to 0 -> [1,0,2] -> then Operation2: set 1 to 0 (using the zero) -> [0,0,2] -> Operation3: set 2 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\n            And [1,1,1]: \n                n=3, has duplicate -> 3 operations.\n                Operation1: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,1] -> then Operation2: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> Operation3: set 1 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\n            But wait: we can do better for [1,1,1]? \n                Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] \n                Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] \n                Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> set 1 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3.\n\n            Alternatively, Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n            Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> that's only 2 operations? \n            But wait: we have three elements. In the second operation, we choose two indices: the two 1's -> then we set one to 0 -> then we get [0,0,0]. So that's 2 operations.\n\n            How? \n                Operation1: indices0 and indices1: [1,1,1] -> set a0 to 0? -> [0,1,1]\n                Operation2: indices1 and indices2: [0,1,1] -> set a1 to 0? -> [0,0,1] -> not [0,0,0]? \n                Or set a2 to 0? -> [0,1,0] -> then we still have a 1.\n\n            But the operation: we choose two distinct indices. In [0,1,1] we can choose the two 1's (at index1 and index2) and set one of them to 0 -> then we get [0,0,1] or [0,1,0]. \n\n            We cannot set both to 0? because the operation: if they are equal, we set one of them to 0. \n\n            So we set one of them to 0 -> then we get one zero and one non-zero? \n\n            Therefore, we cannot clear the entire array in 2 operations.\n\n            So the minimum for [1,1,1] is 2? \n                Operation1: choose two 1's (say index0 and index1) -> set index0 to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n                Operation2: choose the two 1's (index1 and index2) -> set index1 to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> not done.\n                Operation3: choose index0 and index2: 0 and 1 -> set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3.\n\n            Alternatively, Operation1: choose index0 and index1: set index0 to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n            Operation2: choose index0 and index1: 0 and 1 -> set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,1]\n            Operation3: choose index0 and index2: 0 and 1 -> set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3.\n\n            How about a different approach? \n                Operation1: choose index0 and index1: set both to min(1,1)=1? but that doesn't help. Or we set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] -> same.\n\n            So it seems 3 operations.\n\n            But wait: the problem says: \n                \"If a_i = a_j, change one of them to 0\"\n\n            So we have two choices: we can change either one to 0. \n\n            Operation1: choose index0 and index1: set index0 to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n            Operation2: choose index1 and index2: set index1 to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: set index2 to 0.\n\n            Or Operation2: choose index0 and index1: set index1 to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: set index2 to 0.\n\n            So we cannot avoid 3 operations.\n\n            Therefore, the formula: \n                if there is at least one zero: answer = (n - c0)\n                else:\n                    if there is a duplicate: answer = n\n                    else: answer = n+1\n\n            But for [1,1,1]: n=3, duplicate -> so 3 -> matches.\n\n            However, consider [1,1,2] (duplicate) -> n=3 -> 3 operations, but we did 3 operations: \n                Operation1: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> then two operations to clear the 1 and 2 -> total 3.\n\n            But we can do:\n                Operation1: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 2 -> then we need two operations: \n                    Operation2: choose 0 and 1 -> set 1 to 0 -> [0,0,2]\n                    Operation3: choose 0 and 2 -> set 2 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3.\n\n            How about a different way for [1,1,2]:\n                Operation1: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> 3 operations total.\n\n            But note: we can do:\n                Operation1: choose the 1 and 2 -> set both to 1 -> [1,1,1] -> then we have three 1's -> then we can set one to 0 in the next operation -> [0,1,1] -> then set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then set the last to 0 -> 4 operations.\n\n            So the minimum is 3.\n\n            Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n            But wait: what if we have more than one duplicate?

\n                Operation1: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,2,2] \n                Operation2: use the zero and the 1: set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,2,2] \n                Operation3: set one 2 to 0 -> [0,0,0,2] \n                Operation4: set the last 2 to 0 -> 4.\n\n            How about:\n                Operation1: set one 2 to 0 -> [1,1,0,2] \n                Operation2: set one 1 to 0 -> [0,1,0,2] \n                then two more -> 4.\n\n            So 4 operations.\n\n            The formula: n=4 -> 4.\n\n            Now, what if we have no duplicate and no zero: [1,2,3,4] -> then answer = 4+1 = 5.\n\n            Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> set to 1 -> [1,1,3,4] \n            Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,3,4] \n            then we have three non-zeros: 1,3,4 -> we need 3 operations to clear them (using the zero) -> total = 1+1+3 = 5.\n\n            So the formula: \n                if there is at least one zero: \n                    answer = n - c0   (because we can clear each non-zero in one operation by pairing with a zero)\n                else:\n                    if there is at least one duplicate in the non-zero numbers: \n                        answer = n\n                    else:\n                        answer = n+1\n\n            But note: the problem says the array can contain zeros initially.\n\n            However, the code in program2.py:\n\n                for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n                    while a:\n                        q=a.pop()\n                        if a.count(q)>0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                    print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c)\n\n            Let me break down:\n\n                We are reading the test cases: the first line is t, then for each test case: n and then the list a.\n\n                The loop: for n in [*open(0)][2::2] -> this skips the first two lines? \n                    Actually, [*open(0)] is a list of lines.\n                    [2::2] means starting from index2 (the third line) and then every second line -> so it takes the lines that are the array a for each test case.\n\n                Then: \n                    *a, = map(int, n.split())   -> the array a for the test case.\n                    b = len(a)   -> which is n\n                    c = a.count(0)   -> count of zeros\n\n                Then: \n                    while a:\n                        q = a.pop()\n                        if a.count(q)>0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                Then print(b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c)\n\n            What is the purpose of the while loop? \n\n            The while loop pops the last element of a and then checks if the remaining list has that element? \n\n            Then it does nothing in the TODO block? \n\n            Then the print: \n                b - c + (if a is empty and c==0 then add 1? because (a==[])*(c==0) is 1 if both true, else 0)\n\n            So the expression: \n                b - c + (1 if (a becomes empty and c==0) else 0)\n\n            But note: the while loop pops until a is empty. So a will be empty at the end.\n\n            Therefore, the expression is: \n                b - c + (1 if c==0 else 0)\n\n            = n - c0 + (1 if c0==0 else 0)\n\n            = if c0>0: n - c0\n              if c0==0: n - 0 + 1 = n+1\n\n            But wait, we are missing the case for duplicates? \n\n            The formula we deduced for no initial zero: \n                if there is a duplicate: n\n                else: n+1\n\n            But the code does: \n                if there is no zero: then n+1\n                if there is at least one zero: then n - c0\n\n            So it does not account for duplicates? \n\n            The while loop: \n                It pops an element q and then if the remaining list has q, then we do something? \n\n            The TODO block is missing. \n\n            The idea: we want to count the number of duplicates? \n\n            Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces submissions) is:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    if all(x == 0 for x in a):\n                        print(0)\n                        continue\n                    c0 = a.count(0)\n                    non_zero = n - c0\n                    if c0 > 0:\n                        print(non_zero)\n                    else:\n                        if len(set(a)) < n:   # there is at least one duplicate\n                            print(n)\n                        else:\n                            print(n+1)\n\n            But the code in program2.py is different.\n\n            The code in program2.py:\n\n                while a:\n                    q = a.pop()\n                    if a.count(q) > 0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We are popping the last element. Then we check if the remaining list has the same element. \n\n            What if we remove duplicates? \n\n            The idea: we want to know if there is at least one duplicate? \n\n            But note: if we pop an element and then the remaining list has the same element, then that element is duplicated. \n\n            Then we can do: \n                if we find a duplicate, we set a flag? \n\n            But the code does not have a flag.\n\n            Alternatively, we can remove one occurrence of q from the list? \n\n            But the code does: \n                a.pop() -> removes the last element.\n\n            Then we check a.count(q)>0 -> if true, then we remove one occurrence of q? \n\n            How? \n\n            We can do: \n                a.remove(q)   # but this removes the first occurrence? \n\n            But note: the list a is being popped from the end, and then we remove an occurrence of q from the remaining list. \n\n            Then the total number of operations in the while loop? \n\n            Actually, the while loop is removing two elements for the price of one duplicate? \n\n            But the problem: we are counting the number of operations? \n\n            Alternatively, the known solution is:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    c0 = a.count(0)\n                    if c0:\n                        print(n - c0)\n                    else:\n                        s = set()\n                        dup = False\n                        for x in a:\n                            if x in s:\n                                dup = True\n                            s.add(x)\n                        print(n if dup else n+1)\n\n            But the given code uses a while loop.\n\n            The given code after the while loop prints: \n                b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c \n                = n + (1 if (a becomes empty and c==0) else 0) - c0\n\n            And if we do nothing in the while loop, then after the while loop a is empty, so we get:\n                if c0>0: n - c0\n                if c0==0: n + 1 - 0 = n+1\n\n            But we want to account for duplicates: if there is a duplicate and c0==0, then we want to output n, not n+1.\n\n            How can the while loop help? \n\n            The while loop: \n                It pops until the list is empty. \n                For each popped element, if the element is duplicated in the remaining list, then we do something.\n\n            We want to know if there is at least one duplicate. \n\n            We can use the while loop to remove duplicates? \n\n            The TODO block: \n                We can remove one occurrence of q from the list? \n\n            Then the total number of elements removed per duplicate is two: one by the pop and one by the removal.\n\n            But then the variable b is the initial length n.\n\n            And c is the initial count of zeros.\n\n            Then the expression: b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c\n\n            But if we remove duplicates in the while loop, then the list a becomes empty faster? \n\n            Alternatively, we can count the number of duplicates? \n\n            But the formula: \n                if there is at least one duplicate and c0==0, then we output n, else n+1.\n\n            We can set a flag in the TODO block? \n\n            But the code after the while loop doesn't use any flag.\n\n            Another idea: \n                The expression: b - c + (a==[] and c==0) \n                = n - c0 + (1 if (a is empty and c0==0) else 0)\n\n            But a is always empty after the while loop.\n\n            So it is: n - c0 + (1 if c0==0 else 0)\n\n            = n - c0 + (c0==0)\n\n            = if c0>0: n - c0\n              if c0==0: n+1\n\n            We want to change this to: \n                if c0>0: n - c0\n                else: \n                    if there is a duplicate: n\n                    else: n+1\n\n            How can we use the while loop to change the value of the expression? \n\n            We can count the number of duplicates we found? \n\n            But the expression is fixed.\n\n            Alternatively, we can modify the variable b (the initial length) or c (the count of zeros) in the while loop? \n\n            The TODO block: we can do something that affects the final expression.\n\n            The expression: b + (a==[] and c==0) - c\n\n            We can change b or c? \n\n            The problem: we are to fill the TODO block.\n\n            What if in the TODO block we do: \n                b -= 1   # because we found a duplicate, and we want to reduce the answer by 1 in the case c0==0?\n\n            Then the final expression: \n                if c0>0: (n-1) - c0 + (0) [because (a==[] and c0==0) is 0 if c0>0] -> but wait, the term (a==[])*(c==0) is 0 if c0>0, so we get (n-1) - c0.\n\n            But we want n - c0 for c0>0.\n\n            Alternatively, if we do: \n                if we find a duplicate, then we set a flag, and then at the end we subtract 1 from the answer only if c0==0 and we found at least one duplicate.\n\n            But we cannot set a flag that survives the loop? \n\n            How about: \n                In the TODO block, we do: \n                    c = 1   # but c is the count of zeros initially, we don't want to change that.\n\n            Another idea: \n                We want the final answer to be: \n                    if c0>0: n - c0\n                    else: \n                         if we found at least one duplicate: n\n                         else: n+1\n\n            Currently, without the TODO block, the answer is n - c0 + (1 if c0==0 else 0) = \n                if c0>0: n - c0\n                if c0==0: n+1\n\n            We want to reduce the answer by 1 in the case c0==0 and there is at least one duplicate.\n\n            How can we do that? \n\n            We can do: \n                In the TODO block, if we find a duplicate, then we do: \n                    b -= 1   # then the final expression: (b) + (a==[] and c==0) - c \n                    # but then b is reduced by 1 for each duplicate we find? \n\n            But we only want to reduce by 1 overall in the duplicate case.\n\n            How many times do we enter the TODO block? \n                We enter once for each duplicate? \n                But note: if there are multiple duplicates, we only want to reduce by 1.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2] (c0=0) -> \n                Initially: a = [1,1,2], b=3, c=0.\n                Step1: pop -> q=2, then a=[1,1], a.count(2)=0 -> skip.\n                Step2: pop -> q=1, then a=[1], a.count(1)>0 -> true -> enter TODO: we do b-=1 -> b=2.\n                Step3: pop -> q=1, then a=[], a.count(1)=0 -> skip.\n                Then print: b + (a==[] and c==0) - c = 2 + (1 and 1) - 0 = 2+1 = 3.\n\n            And we want 3 (because n=3 and there is a duplicate) -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] (c0=0, no duplicate) -> \n                Step1: pop 3 -> a=[1,2] -> count(3)=0 -> skip.\n                Step2: pop 2 -> a=[1] -> count(2)=0 -> skip.\n                Step3: pop 1 -> a=[] -> count(1)=0 -> skip.\n                Then print: b + (a==[] and c==0) - c = 3 + 1 - 0 = 4 -> matches.\n\n            Example: [0,0,1] (c0=2) -> \n                b=3, c=2.\n                Step1: pop 1 -> a=[0,0] -> count(1)=0 -> skip.\n                Step2: pop 0 -> a=[0] -> count(0)=1 -> enter TODO: b becomes 2.\n                Step3: pop 0 -> skip.\n                Then print: 2 + (1 and c==0) - 2 = 2 + (1 and 0) - 2 = 2+0-2 = 0 -> but expected answer = non_zero = 1.\n\n            Why 1? \n                We have two zeros and one 1. We can clear the 1 in one operation (pairing with a zero) -> 1 operation.\n\n            But we got 0.\n\n            What went wrong? \n\n            We reduced b by 1 in the TODO block even when there are zeros? \n\n            We only want to reduce b by 1 in the case when c0==0 and there is a duplicate.\n\n            How can we avoid reducing b when c0>0? \n\n            We can check in the TODO block: only reduce b if c==0? \n\n            But c is the initial count of zeros, which is 2 in this example.\n\n            So in the TODO block, we do:\n\n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n\n            Then for [0,0,1]:\n                Step2: when we pop the first 0, we find that there is another 0 in the list, but c=2>0, so we don't reduce b.\n\n            Then the final expression: b + (a==[] and c==0) - c = 3 + (1 and 0) - 2 = 3+0-2=1 -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,1,0] (c0=1) -> \n                b=3, c=1.\n                Step1: pop 0 -> a=[1,1] -> count(0)=0 -> skip.\n                Step2: pop 1 -> a=[1] -> count(1)=1 -> enter TODO: but c=1>0, so we don't reduce b.\n                Step3: pop 1 -> skip.\n                Then print: 3 + (1 and c==0) - 1 = 3 + (1 and 0) - 1 = 3+0-1=2.\n\n            But the expected answer: \n                non_zero = 2 -> so 2 operations? \n                Operation1: use the zero and one 1: set the 1 to 0 -> [0,1,0] \n                Operation2: use a zero and the last 1: set the 1 to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 2 operations -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,1,0,0] (c0=2) -> \n                non_zero=2 -> answer=2.\n                In the code: \n                    b=4, c=2.\n                    Step1: pop 0 -> a=[1,1,0] -> count(0)=1 -> but c=2>0, so we don't reduce b.\n                    Step2: pop 0 -> a=[1,1] -> count(0)=0 -> skip.\n                    Step3: pop 1 -> a=[1] -> count(1)=1 -> enter TODO: c=2>0 -> skip.\n                    Step4: pop 1 -> skip.\n                    Then print: 4 + (1 and 0) - 2 = 4+0-2=2 -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2,0] (c0=1) -> \n                non_zero=3 -> answer=3.\n                In the code: \n                    b=4, c=1.\n                    Step1: pop 0 -> a=[1,1,2] -> count(0)=0 -> skip.\n                    Step2: pop 2 -> a=[1,1] -> count(2)=0 -> skip.\n                    Step3: pop 1 -> a=[1] -> count(1)=1 -> enter TODO: c=1>0 -> skip.\n                    Step4: pop 1 -> skip.\n                    Then print: 4 + (1 and 0) - 1 = 4+0-1=3 -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,2,2,0] (c0=1) -> \n                non_zero=3 -> answer=3.\n                Step1: pop 0 -> skip.\n                Step2: pop 2 -> a=[1,2] -> count(2)=1 -> enter TODO: c=1>0 -> skip.\n                Step3: pop 2 -> a=[1] -> count(2)=0 -> skip.\n                Step4: pop 1 -> skip.\n                Then print: 4 + 0 - 1 = 3 -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3,0] (c0=1) -> \n                non_zero=3 -> answer=3.\n                The while loop: \n                    pop0: skip.\n                    pop3: skip.\n                    pop2: skip.\n                    pop1: skip.\n                Then print: 4+0-1=3.\n\n            Example: [1,1,0,0] (c0=2) -> already done.\n\n            Example with duplicate and c0==0: [1,1,2] -> \n                b=3, c=0.\n                Step1: pop2: skip.\n                Step2: pop1: a=[1] -> count(1)>0 -> enter TODO: and since c==0, we do b-=1 -> b=2.\n                Step3: pop1: skip.\n                Then print: 2 + (1 and 1) - 0 = 2+1=3.\n\n            Example with no duplicate and c0==0: [1,2,3] -> \n                b=3, c=0.\n                Step1: pop3: skip.\n                Step2: pop2: skip.\n                Step3: pop1: skip.\n                Then print: 3+1-0=4.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO block is:\n\n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n\n            But note: the condition is: if a.count(q)>0, then we do that.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the count might be more than one, but we only want to reduce b by one for the entire test case? \n\n            But if there are multiple duplicates, we reduce b multiple times? \n\n            Example: [1,1,1] (c0=0) -> \n                Step1: pop1: a=[1,1] -> count(1)=2>0 -> enter TODO: b becomes 2 (since c==0)\n                Step2: pop1: a=[1] -> count(1)=1>0 -> enter TODO: b becomes 1\n                Step3: pop1: skip.\n                Then print: 1 + 1 - 0 = 2 -> but expected answer is 3.\n\n            What's the issue? \n\n            The formula: for [1,1,1] (n=3, c0=0, duplicate) -> we want 3.\n\n            But we reduced b twice.\n\n            Why? \n\n            The while loop:\n                We start with a=[1,1,1], b=3, c=0.\n                Step1: pop last -> q=1, a becomes [1,1]. Then a.count(1)=2>0 -> so we do b=2.\n                Step2: pop last -> q=1, a becomes [1]. Then a.count(1)=1>0 -> so we do b=1.\n                Step3: pop last -> done.\n\n            Then print: 1 + 1 - 0 = 2.\n\n            But we only want to reduce b by 1 overall, because we only need one duplicate to avoid the extra operation.\n\n            How to fix? \n\n            We only need to know if there is at least one duplicate. We don't care how many. \n\n            So we should reduce b by at most one per test case.\n\n            We can break after the first duplicate? \n\n            But the while loop continues.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break out of the loop after we reduce b once? \n\n            But then we might not pop all elements.\n\n            Or we can set a flag and then avoid reducing again? \n\n            But the problem: we are only allowed to fill the TODO block.\n\n            We can use a global flag? But the code is not in a function.\n\n            How about we remove all occurrences of q? \n\n            But then we would be removing more than one duplicate.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = 1   # to mark that we have found a duplicate and avoid further reductions? \n\n            But c is the count of zeros, and we are in the case c==0 initially. We don't want to change the count of zeros? \n\n            And the final expression uses the initial c? \n\n            Actually, the final expression uses the initial c (because we did c=a.count(0) at the beginning). \n\n            But if we change c in the loop, then the final expression uses the changed c? \n\n            We want the final expression to use the initial c? \n\n            The variable c is reassigned? \n\n            We can do: \n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = 1   # then in the next iterations, c is 1 so we won't reduce again.\n\n            Then for [1,1,1]:\n                Step1: pop last -> q=1, a=[1,1] -> count(1)>0 -> and c==0 -> so we do b=2 and set c=1.\n                Step2: pop last -> q=1, a=[1] -> count(1)=1>0 -> but now c=1, so we skip.\n                Step3: pop last -> skip.\n                Then print: b + (a==[] and c_initial==0) - c_initial \n                    But wait, we changed c. The final expression uses the current c? \n\n            The final expression: \n                print(b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c)\n\n            Now, at the end, c=1 (because we changed it) and the initial c0 was 0.\n\n            Then: \n                b=2, (a==[])=True, (c==0)=False -> so (a==[])*(c==0)=0, then 2 + 0 - 1 = 1.\n\n            But we want 3.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a new variable? \n\n            But the problem: we are only to fill the TODO block.\n\n            How about we break after the first reduction? \n\n            We can break out of the while loop? \n\n            Then we would not pop all elements. \n\n            Then the condition (a==[]) might be false? \n\n            And the final expression would be incorrect.\n\n            Another idea: \n                We only reduce b by 1 for the first duplicate we find, and then we set a flag in the TODO block by changing the value of c to a negative number? \n\n            But then the final expression: \n                if we set c to -1, then (c==0) is false, and then the expression: b + 0 - (-1) = b+1.\n\n            That doesn't help.\n\n            Given the complexity, and since the problem constraints are small (n<=100), we can simply break after the first reduction and then continue popping without checking? \n\n            But the while loop condition is while a: so we must pop until empty.\n\n            How about we do: \n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = -1   # mark that we have used the reduction, but then the final expression: \n                then the final expression: \n                    if c was initially 0 and we set c=-1, then the term (a==[] and c==0) is (True and ( -1==0 )) -> false.\n                    and -c = -(-1)=1, so the expression: b + 0 - (-1) = b+1.\n\n            For [1,1,1]: \n                b becomes 2, then we set c=-1.\n                Then the expression: 2 + 0 - (-1) = 2+1=3 -> matches.\n\n            For [1,2,3] (no duplicate): \n                we never enter the TODO block, so c remains 0.\n                expression: 3 + 1 - 0 = 4.\n\n            For [1,1,2] (duplicate, c0=0): \n                Step1: pop2: skip.\n                Step2: pop1: enter TODO: set b=2, c=-1.\n                Then the expression: 2 + (a becomes empty? and c==0) is (True and ( -1==0 )) -> false -> 0, then -c = -(-1)=1 -> 2+0+1 = 3? \n                But we want 3.\n\n            Actually, the expression is: b + (a==[] and c==0) - c \n            = 2 + (True and ( -1==0 )) - (-1) \n            = 2 + (False) + 1 \n            = 3.\n\n            For [0,0,1] (c0=2): \n                we do not enter the TODO block? \n                But we do: \n                    Step1: pop1: skip.\n                    Step2: pop0: a=[0] -> count(0)=1 -> enter TODO? \n                But in the TODO block: \n                    if c==0: ... but c=2, so we skip.\n                Then the expression: 3 + (True and (2==0)) - 2 = 3+0-2=1.\n\n            But if we set c to -1 in the TODO block even when c0>0, then for [0,0,1]:\n                Step2: we enter TODO: c=2>0 -> skip? we don't do the block.\n\n            So we only do the block if c==0.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO block:\n\n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = -1\n\n            But wait, what if there is more than one duplicate and c0==0? \n                Example: [1,1,2,2] (c0=0) -> \n                    We want 4 operations? \n                    Step1: pop2: a=[1,1,2] -> count(2)=1>0 -> enter TODO: c==0 -> so we set b=3, c=-1.\n                    Then we continue: \n                    Step2: pop2: a=[1,1] -> count(2)=0 -> skip.\n                    Step3: pop1: a=[1] -> count(1)=1>0 -> enter TODO: but now c=-1, so we skip.\n                    Step4: pop1: done.\n                    Then expression: 3 + (a==[] and c==0) - c = 3 + (True and ( -1==0 )) - (-1) = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4 -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,1,1] (c0=0) -> \n                Step1: pop1: a=[1,1] -> count(1)=2>0 -> enter TODO: set b=2, c=-1.\n                Step2: pop1: a=[1] -> count(1)=1>0 -> but c=-1, so skip.\n                Step3: pop1: done.\n                Expression: 2 + (True and ( -1==0 )) - (-1) = 2+0+1=3 -> matches.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] (c0=0) -> \n                We don't enter TODO, so expression: 3+1-0=4.\n\n            Example: [1,2,2] (c0=0) -> \n                Step1: pop2: a=[1,2] -> count(2)=1>0 -> enter TODO: set b=2, c=-1.\n                Step2: pop2: skip.\n                Step3: pop1: skip.\n                Expression: 2 + (True and ( -1==0 )) - (-1) = 2+0+1=3.\n\n            But [1,2,2] has n=3, and we want 3 operations? -> matches.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO block for program2.py is:\n\n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = -1\n\n            But note: the variable c is being reused. The initial c is the count of zeros. Then we set it to -1 to mark that we have used the reduction.\n\n            This works.\n\n            However, what if there are zeros and we find a duplicate? \n                Example: [0,1,1] (c0=1) -> \n                    Step1: pop1: a=[0,1] -> count(1)=1>0 -> enter TODO: but c=1 (not 0) -> skip.\n                    Step2: pop1: a=[0] -> count(1)=0 -> skip.\n                    Step3: pop0: skip.\n                    Expression: 3 + (True and (1==0)) - 1 = 3+0-1=2 -> matches.\n\n            So it's safe.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = -1\n\n            But note: the condition is: if a.count(q)>0. We are inside that condition.\n\n            So we write:\n\n                if c == 0:\n                    b -= 1\n                    c = -1\n\n            However, what if there are multiple duplicates and we set c=-1, then we avoid reducing b again? which is what we want.\n\n            So we are done.\n\n            Summary:\n\n            For program1.py: \n                Missing code: \n                    if i > 0:\n                        update(i-1, -1)\n\n            For program2.py:\n                Missing code:\n                    if c == 0:\n                        b -= 1\n                        c = -1\n\n            We output in JSON format:\n\n                {\n                  \"program1\": \"if i > 0:\\n        update(i-1, -1)\",\n                  \"program2\": \"if c == 0:\\n                    b -= 1\\n                    c = -1\"\n                }\n\n            But note: the indentation must match the existing code.\n\n            In program1.py, the existing code has:\n\n                if(i >= 0):# TODO: Your code here\n                update(i , -1)\n\n            We want to insert:\n\n                if i > 0:\n                    update(i-1, -1)\n\n            And the next line is update(i, -1) which is at the same indentation as the if(i>=0) block.\n\n            So we indent the new code one level more than the if(i>=0) block? \n\n            The existing if(i>=0) is at the same level as the for loop? \n\n            Actually, the code:\n\n                for q in range(m):\n                    i , x = inp()\n                    i -= 1\n\n                    if(i >= 0):# TODO: Your code here\n                    update(i , -1)\n\n            We want:\n\n                for q in range(m):\n                    i , x = inp()\n                    i -= 1\n\n                    if(i >= 0):\n                        if i > 0:\n                            update(i-1, -1)\n                    update(i , -1)\n\n            But the condition if(i>=0) is always true, so we can also do:\n\n                if i > 0:\n                    update(i-1, -1)\n\n            without the outer if(i>=0). But the outer if is already there.\n\n            So we write:\n\n                if i > 0:\n                    update(i-1, -1)\n\n            with the same indentation as the TODO block.\n\n            In the given code, the TODO block is under if(i>=0) and at the same indentation as the next line (update(i,-1))? \n\n            Actually, the code has:\n\n                if(i >= 0):# TODO: Your code here\n                update(i , -1)\n\n            The TODO block is empty. We are to fill it. So we write:\n\n                if i > 0:\n                    update(i-1, -1)\n\n            with an indentation level of 4 or 8? The existing code uses 4 spaces.\n\n            We write:\n\n                if i > 0:\n                    update(i-1, -1)\n\n            with 8 spaces (one more level) to be inside the if(i>=0) block.\n\n            But the next line (update(i,-1)) is not inside the if(i>=0) block? \n\n            Actually, the if(i>=0) has no body? \n\n            How about we write:\n\n                if(i >= 0):\n                    if i > 0:\n                        update(i-1, -1)\n\n            But the original code has a colon at the end of if(i>=0): so it expects an indented block.\n\n            The TODO is to fill that block.\n\n            So we write:\n\n                if i > 0:\n                    update(i-1, -1)\n\n            with 8 spaces (so two levels) to be inside the if(i>="
