  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\nThe input has t test cases. For each test case, we have n strings. The total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\nWe are using a 2D array `data` of size 11x11 (since letters from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters) to count the frequency of each string.\n\nThe current code has:\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nBut note: the current loop counts pairs that differ in the second character (when the first character is the same) by the condition `if k != l` and then adds `data[j][k] * data[j][l]` (which counts pairs with same first letter j and different second letters k and l). However, we also need to count pairs that have the same second letter but different first letters.\n\nThe TODO part is for the case when the first letter differs and the second letter is the same. So we should do:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the current code has two conditions. The first condition `if j != l` is for the first character being different (and then we want the second character to be the same, which is k in both). The second condition `if k != l` is for the second character being different (and then the first character is the same, which is j in both).\n\nHowever, the inner loop variable for the second condition is `l` (which is the same variable as the one used for the first character in the first condition). This is a problem because we are using the same loop variable for two different purposes.\n\nActually, the current structure is:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # This is for pairs that have the same second letter (k) and different first letters (j and l)\n                    # So we should add: data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n                if k != l:\n                    # This is for pairs that have the same first letter (j) and different second letters (k and l)\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut note: the inner loop runs for every l from 0 to 10 for every j and k. The two conditions are independent. However, the problem is that the same pair of strings might be counted twice? Actually, no: because a pair that differs in exactly one position must differ in either the first or the second, but not both. So we are counting two disjoint sets.\n\nBut wait: the current code for the second condition is inside the same inner loop. And we are adding for every l that is not k: `data[j][k] * data[j][l]`. This counts every pair of strings that have the same first letter j and second letters k and l (with k != l). However, note that for a fixed j and k, we are iterating over l and adding the product. This will count the same pair multiple times? Actually, no: for a fixed j and k, and for a fixed pair of second letters (k and l1) and (k and l2), we are adding the product for each distinct l. But note: the total pairs for fixed j and k is: for each l != k, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l]. However, this counts each pair (s1, s2) exactly once? Actually, no: because if we have two strings: one with (j,k) and one with (j,l), then we add 1 for that pair. But if we have multiple strings with (j,k) and multiple with (j,l), then we are adding the product. This is correct.\n\nBut the problem: the same pair of strings is only counted once? Actually, the pair (i, j) is considered only once? Let me see: we are iterating over the entire grid. For a fixed j (first letter) and k (second letter), we are adding the count of (j,k) multiplied by the count of (j, l) for every l != k. This counts every pair of two strings that have the same first letter j and second letters k and l (with k != l). Similarly, in the first condition, we are going to count pairs that have the same second letter k and different first letters j and l.\n\nHowever, the current code does not have the first condition filled. We must fill the first condition.\n\nBut note: the current code has the second condition already written: `if k != l: answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]`. And the first condition is missing.\n\nSo we should add for the first condition: `if j != l: answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]`\n\nBut wait: the inner loop variable is `l` and we are using it for two different purposes? Actually, in the first condition we are using `l` as the first letter index, and in the second condition we are using `l` as the second letter index. This is incorrect because the same `l` is used for both. We need to separate the two.\n\nActually, the current structure is:\n\n    for j in range(11):   # first letter index\n        for k in range(11):   # second letter index\n            for l in range(11):   # this l is used for both: in the first condition as a first letter index and in the second condition as a second letter index.\n\nThis is confusing and incorrect. We should restructure? But the problem says: output only the missing code. We cannot change the existing code.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"fill in the missing lines or blocks\". The existing code has two conditions: one for `j != l` (which we must fill) and one for `k != l` (which is already written). However, the inner loop variable `l` is being used for two different meanings. This will cause the two conditions to be mixed.\n\nActually, the intended logic is:\n\nWe want to count two types of pairs:\n\nType 1: same first letter, different second letter.\nType 2: same second letter, different first letter.\n\nFor Type 1: for a fixed first letter j, and for a fixed second letter k, we want to count all the strings with first letter j and second letter not equal to k. But note: we are iterating over k and then over l (which is the second letter). So for fixed j and k, we do:\n\n    for l in range(11):\n        if k != l:\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut this counts each pair (j,k) and (j,l) for every l != k. However, note that for a fixed j, the total pairs of strings in group j that have different second letters is: for each k, we add data[j][k] * (total of data[j][l] for l != k). But this counts each pair twice: because the pair (s1, s2) where s1 has second letter k and s2 has second letter l (k != l) is counted once when k is the second letter of s1 and l is the second letter of s2, and then again when k is the second letter of s2 and l is the second letter of s1? Actually, no: because in the inner loop, for a fixed j and k, we iterate over l and for each l != k we add data[j][k] * data[j][l]. Then when we fix j and l (with l now being the second letter of the first string) and then k = l, we will not iterate over the same pair again? Actually, no: because when k = l, we skip. But note: when we are at k = k0 and l = l0 (with k0 != l0), we add data[j][k0] * data[j][l0]. Then when we are at k = l0 and l = k0, we again add data[j][l0] * data[j][k0] (which is the same). So each pair is counted twice.\n\nSimilarly, for Type 2: same second letter, different first letter: we do:\n\n    for l in range(11):\n        if j != l:\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nThis will also count each pair twice: because the pair (s1, s2) with s1 = (j,k) and s2 = (l,k) (j != l) is counted when we are at (j,k) and l, and then again when we are at (l,k) and j (if we consider the outer loops for j and l).\n\nTherefore, the total answer is twice the actual number of pairs? Then at the end we do `print(answer//2)`. So that is okay.\n\nBut note: the current code for the second condition is already written and we are only to fill the first condition. So we must add:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut wait: the inner loop variable `l` is being used for both conditions. In the first condition, `l` is an index for the first letter (so we are comparing with j, the first letter of the current string). In the second condition, `l` is an index for the second letter (so we are comparing with k, the second letter of the current string). This is acceptable because the two conditions are independent and we are iterating over the same range.\n\nHowever, note that the two conditions are not mutually exclusive: we might have j != l and k != l at the same time? But in the inner loop, `l` is the same variable. Actually, the condition `if j != l` and `if k != l` are independent. But note: in the first condition, we are using `l` as a first letter index? Actually, no: the variable `l` is just an integer from 0 to 10. We are using it in two different contexts.\n\nBut observe: in the first condition, we are using `l` to index the first letter: we are looking at data[l][k]. So the first condition is: for a fixed j (first letter) and k (second letter), and for each l (which we are using as a first letter index) that is not equal to j, we add data[j][k] * data[l][k]. This counts pairs of strings that have the same second letter k and first letters j and l (with j != l).\n\nIn the second condition, we are using `l` to index the second letter: we are looking at data[j][l]. So the second condition is: for a fixed j (first letter) and k (second letter), and for each l (as second letter index) that is not equal to k, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l]. This counts pairs of strings that have the same first letter j and second letters k and l (with k != l).\n\nSo the two conditions are independent and we are using the same loop variable `l` for two different purposes. This is acceptable because the two conditions are in separate if statements and the meaning of `l` in the two conditions is different (but the same variable). However, note that the inner loop runs 11 times for each fixed j and k, and in each iteration we check:\n\n    if j != l:   # here l is being used as a first letter index? Actually, no: j and l are both first letter indices? \n        ... data[l][k]   # so l is used as first letter index\n\n    if k != l:   # here l is being used as a second letter index? \n        ... data[j][l]   # so l is used as second letter index\n\nBut wait: j and k are fixed. The variable `l` is an integer from 0 to 10. We are using it in two different ways. This is incorrect because:\n\nIn the first condition, we want to consider all first letter indices l (from 0 to 10) that are not equal to j. But in the second condition, we want to consider all second letter indices l (from 0 to 10) that are not equal to k. However, the same `l` value is used for both. For example, if j=0 and k=0, then:\n\n    l=0: skip both conditions (because j==l and k==l).\n    l=1: \n        first condition: j (0) != l (1) -> true, so we add data[0][0] * data[1][0] -> which is correct for Type 2 (same second letter 0, different first letters 0 and 1).\n        second condition: k (0) != l (1) -> true, so we add data[0][0] * data[0][1] -> which is correct for Type 1 (same first letter 0, different second letters 0 and 1).\n\nBut note: the value of `l` is 1 in both conditions. This is acceptable because the two conditions are independent. However, the problem is that we are iterating `l` from 0 to 10 and using it for both conditions in the same iteration? Actually, no: we are doing both conditions in the same iteration. But that is okay because the two conditions are independent and we are using the same `l` value for two different purposes? Actually, no: the two conditions are using the same `l` value for two different meanings. But the two meanings are independent: one meaning is for the first letter index and the other for the second letter index. However, the array `data` is 11x11, so we can use the same index variable for both dimensions.\n\nBut note: the two conditions are not conflicting because we are using `l` in two different dimensions. So it is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for the first condition is:\n\n    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the condition is `if j != l`, so we are only adding when the first letters are different and the second letter is the same (k). This is correct.\n\nSo the completed code for program1.py's missing part is:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the grid is 11x11 and we are doing 11^3 = 1331 iterations per test case. Since the total n is 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 100, but the sum of n is 10^5, so the number of test cases might be up to 100, but 100 * 1331 = 133100 which is acceptable.\n\nSo we are done for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are to compute, for each vertex i (from 1 to n) in a tree of n vertices (n is odd) that is built by attaching each vertex i (from 2 to n) to exactly one vertex with a smaller index, the number of trees for which vertex i is the centroid.\n\nThe centroid is defined as a vertex whose removal leaves no subtree with more than (n-1)/2 vertices.\n\nThe given code already has:\n\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n    # We are missing the inv function\n\n    MAX = 10 ** 6   # note: n < 200000, so MAX=10**6 is safe.\n\n    Precomputation of factorials and inverse factorials.\n\n    Then we have:\n\n    n = int(input())\n    out = [0] * n\n\n    for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n        base = fact[n - 1]\n        frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n        out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n    Then we do:\n\n    rem = 0   \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        oldrem = rem\n        rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))   # note: invs(i) is defined as fact[i-1] * invfact[i] mod MOD? \n        out[i] -= oldrem\n        rem %= MOD\n        out[i] %= MOD\n\n    Then print the array out.\n\nWe are missing the `inv` function. We need to compute the modular inverse modulo MOD.\n\nWe can use Fermat's little theorem: since MOD is prime, the inverse of x is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the function `invs(x)` is defined as:\n\n    def invs(x):\n        return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\nBut that is the inverse of x? Actually, note:\n\n    fact[x] = x! \n    invfact[x] = 1/(x!) mod MOD.\n\nSo invs(x) = ( (x-1)! ) * (1/(x!)) = 1/x mod MOD.\n\nBut wait: (x-1)! / x! = 1/x.\n\nSo invs(x) is the modular inverse of x.\n\nNow, what is the algorithm doing?\n\nThe problem is known: counting trees (which are labeled and built by attaching each vertex to a smaller one) by centroid.\n\nThe known solution:\n\nLet dp[i] be the number of trees of size i (with i nodes) that are \"centroid-containing\" for a fixed root? Actually, the known solution for this problem is:\n\nWe know that the total number of trees is (n-1)! (because: vertex 1 has no parent, vertex 2 can choose parent from 1, vertex 3 from 1 or 2, ... so (n-1)!).\n\nBut the centroid condition: for a vertex i to be the centroid, we require that in the tree, when we remove i, the connected components (which are the subtrees attached to i) have size <= (n-1)/2.\n\nWe can use generating functions and inclusion exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, the known solution in the code:\n\nWe are initializing an array `out` of length n.\n\nFor i in range( (n+1)//2 ) [which is from 0 to (n-1)//2 - 1? Actually, (n+1)//2 is (n//2 + 1) because n is odd. But note: the indices in the array `out` are from 0 to n-1 (for vertices 0-indexed). However, the problem says the vertex i (from 1 to n) so we output the i-th integer for the i-th vertex.\n\nBut the loop: for i in range((n+1)//2) -> i goes from 0 to (n-1)//2.\n\nThen we set:\n\n    base = fact[n-1]   # which is (n-1)! \n\n    frac = modmul( comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i) )\n\n    out[i] = base * frac mod MOD\n\nWhat is comb(n//2, i)? It is C(n//2, i). And invcomb(n-1, i) is 1 / C(n-1, i) mod MOD? Actually, the function `invcomb(x,y)` is defined as:\n\n    def invcomb(x, y):\n        return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x-y]))\n\nBut note: the standard combination is: C(x,y) = fact[x] * invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] mod MOD.\n\nSo invcomb(x,y) = invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y] mod MOD = fact[y] * fact[x-y] / fact[x] mod MOD = 1 / C(x,y) mod MOD? Actually, no: because:\n\n    C(x,y) = fact[x] * invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] mod MOD.\n\n    So 1 / C(x,y) = invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y] mod MOD.\n\nTherefore, invcomb(x,y) = 1 / C(x,y) mod MOD.\n\nSo:\n\n    frac = C(n//2, i) * (1 / C(n-1, i)) mod MOD.\n\nThen out[i] = (n-1)! * C(n//2, i) / C(n-1, i) mod MOD.\n\nBut note: C(n-1, i) = fact[n-1] * invfact[i] * invfact[n-1-i] mod MOD.\n\nSo:\n\n    out[i] = fact[n-1] * [ C(n//2, i) * (1 / C(n-1, i)) ] \n            = fact[n-1] * [ C(n//2, i) * ( fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] / fact[n-1] ) ]\n            = C(n//2, i) * fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] mod MOD.\n\nBut that doesn't look familiar.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n    out[i] = fact[n-1] * ( C(n//2, i) * inv( C(n-1, i) ) ) mod MOD.\n\nBut note: the known solution for centroid tree counting:\n\nWe know that the total number of trees is (n-1)!.\n\nFor a fixed vertex i, we want to count the trees in which i is the centroid.\n\nThe known approach: \n\nLet the size of the subtree that contains vertex 1 (if we root the tree at i) be at most (n-1)/2, and similarly for every other subtree? Actually, the condition is that every connected component after removing i has size <= (n-1)/2.\n\nBut note: the tree is built by attaching each vertex to a smaller one. So the entire tree is rooted at 1? Not necessarily: the root can be any vertex, but the tree is unrooted. However, the condition of centroid is symmetric.\n\nBut the known solution in the code:\n\n    for i in range((n+1)//2):\n        ... \n\n    Then we do a backward update:\n\n    rem = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        oldrem = rem\n        rem += out[i] * invs(i+1)   # but note: in the code it's modmul(out[i], invs(i)) -> but i might be 0? \n\nWait: in the code: `invs(i)` is called. But i is the index in the array, which goes from 0 to n-1. And in the function `invs(x)`, we have:\n\n    return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\nIf x=0, then we get fact[-1] -> which is out of bounds.\n\nBut note: the loop for `out` is only set for i in [0, (n-1)//2]. The rest of the `out` array is 0. Then in the backward loop, we start from i = n-1 down to 0. For i >= (n+1)//2, out[i] is 0. But for i in [0, (n-1)//2] we have non-zero.\n\nBut in the backward loop, we do:\n\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))   # but if i==0, then invs(0) would be: fact[-1] -> which is not defined.\n\nSo we must check: the loop for the forward part: i in range((n+1)//2) -> i from 0 to (n-1)//2. The smallest i is 0.\n\nBut note: the function `invs(x)` is defined for x>=1? Because it uses fact[x-1]. So we must avoid calling invs(0). \n\nLooking at the code: the backward loop runs for i from n-1 down to 0. For i=0, we call invs(0) -> which is not defined.\n\nBut note: the problem says n>=3 and odd. So the smallest n is 3. Then the forward loop: i in range((3+1)//2) = range(2) -> i=0,1.\n\nThen in the backward loop, we start at i=2 (n-1=2) and go down to 0. For i=0, we call invs(0) -> which is undefined.\n\nBut wait: the array `out` is of size n. For indices that are not set in the forward loop, they are 0. So for i=0, out[0] is set (if n>=3, then (n+1)//2>=2, so i=0 is set). But then we do:\n\n    out[0] = ... (some value) \n    then in the backward loop, for i=0: \n        oldrem = rem   (which is the accumulated rem from i=1 and i=2)\n        rem += out[0] * invs(0)   -> but invs(0) is undefined.\n\nSo we must fix the function `invs` to handle 0? But the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. The missing code is only the `inv` function? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The function `invs` is defined and uses `fact` and `invfact`. We are not allowed to change that. \n\nAlternatively, note that the backward loop might be intended for i>=1? But the code runs for i from n-1 down to 0.\n\nBut observe: the function `invs` is called with `i` as the index. However, in the context, the `i` in the backward loop is the vertex index? Actually, the array `out` is indexed by the vertex index (0-indexed). The vertex indices are from 0 to n-1. The centroid condition: the centroid must be a vertex that is not too small? Actually, the centroid cannot be a leaf? But note: in a tree of 3 vertices, the centroid can be the middle vertex (which is vertex 1 in 0-indexed) and also the root (vertex0) in one of the trees.\n\nBut the known example: n=3 -> vertices 0,1,2.\n\nThe answers: 1,1,0.\n\nSo the array `out` should be [1,1,0]. \n\nIn the forward loop: i in range((3+1)//2)=range(2) -> i=0 and i=1.\n\n    i=0: \n        base = fact[2] = 2\n        frac = C(1,0) * invcomb(2,0) = 1 * (1 / C(2,0)) = 1 / 1 = 1 -> so out[0]=2\n    i=1:\n        base = 2\n        frac = C(1,1) * invcomb(2,1) = 1 * (1 / C(2,1)) = 1/2 mod MOD -> so out[1]=2 * (1/2) = 1.\n\nThen the backward loop:\n\n    i=2: \n        oldrem = 0\n        rem += out[2] * invs(2) -> but out[2] is 0 (since we only set out[0] and out[1]), so rem remains 0.\n        out[2] = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\n    i=1:\n        oldrem = 0\n        rem += out[1] * invs(1) = 1 * invs(1) \n            invs(1) = fact[0] * invfact[1] = 1 * 1 = 1? \n            So rem becomes 1.\n        out[1] = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n    i=0:\n        oldrem = 1\n        rem += out[0] * invs(0) -> here we have a problem: invs(0) is called.\n\nSo we must avoid calling invs(0). But the problem says: we are only to complete the missing code. The missing code is the `inv` function and the TODO in program1. We are not allowed to change the rest.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The function `invs` is defined and we are not to change it. The backward loop uses `invs(i)`. How can we avoid i=0? \n\nAlternatively, note that the problem states: for each i from 1 to n. The array `out` is 0-indexed: so out[0] corresponds to vertex1? Actually, the problem says: the i-th integer is for the i-th vertex. So vertex1 is at index0, vertex2 at index1, ... vertexn at index n-1.\n\nBut the centroid condition: the centroid must be a vertex that is not too small? Actually, the centroid must be a vertex that is in the \"middle\". In particular, the centroid cannot be a leaf? But in the example n=3, vertex0 (which is the first vertex) is a centroid in one tree. So we must compute for vertex0.\n\nBut the function `invs(0)` is called. How is `invs` defined? \n\n    def invs(x):\n        return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\nWhen x=0: we access fact[-1] -> which is not defined. So we must avoid this.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n>=3 and odd. The smallest n is 3. The forward loop sets out[0] and out[1] for n=3. Then the backward loop goes from i=2 down to 0. For i=0, we call invs(0). This will crash.\n\nTherefore, the provided code has a bug? Or we are missing something.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is only the `inv` function and the TODO in program1. We are not to change the rest.\n\nSo we must assume that the backward loop does not call `invs(0)`? But it does. \n\nAlternatively, note that the forward loop only sets indices from 0 to (n-1)//2. The backward loop then updates the entire array. But the update for i=0: \n\n    out[0] = ... \n\nBut the function `invs` is called with i=0. We must define `invs(0)`? But the problem does not say we can change `invs`. \n\nWait: the problem says \"Complete the code in python\" for program2.py. The code block we are given for program2.py includes the definition of `invs` and we are allowed to change it? But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The `inv` function is missing. The `invs` function is already defined? Actually, the code for `invs` is provided. We are not to change it.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we only output the missing parts. The missing part is the `inv` function.\n\nSo we write:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer modulo 998244353. And MOD is 998244353.\n\nBut what about the backward loop? It might be that the original code intended to use `invs(i+1)`? But we are not allowed to change.\n\nAlternatively, note that the function `invs(x)` is defined for x>=1. And in the backward loop, when i=0, we have out[0] which is non-zero. But we cannot compute invs(0). \n\nBut looking at the known solution for centroids in trees: \n\nThe known solution for the problem \"Centroid\" on codeforces: \n\n    #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n    using namespace std;\n    const int maxn = 500000;\n    const int mod = 998244353;\n    int n, ans[maxn + 5];\n    long long inv[maxn + 5], f[maxn + 5];\n    int main() {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n        inv[1] = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            inv[i] = (mod - mod / i) * inv[mod % i] % mod;\n        }\n        f[0] = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            f[i] = f[i - 1] * i % mod;\n        }\n        long long res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            ans[i] = 1LL * f[n - 1] * inv[i - 1] % mod * inv[n - i] % mod * f[n - i] % mod;\n            res = (res + ans[i]) % mod;\n        }\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            printf(\"%lld \", (ans[i] + mod - res * inv[n] % mod) % mod);\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n\nBut that is different.\n\nAlternatively, we can see that the provided code in the problem might be from a known solution. \n\nBut note: the provided code in the problem for program2.py has:\n\n    for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n        base = fact[n - 1]\n        frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n        out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n    rem = 0   \n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        oldrem = rem\n        rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n        out[i] -= oldrem\n        rem %= MOD\n        out[i] %= MOD\n\nThis is similar to the known solution for the problem \"Centroid\" from a contest? \n\nAfter research, the intended solution:\n\n    Let f(i) = (n-1)! * C(n/2, i) / C(n-1, i)   for i from 0 to n/2.\n\n    Then we do an inclusion exclusion: \n\n        g(i) = f(i) - sum_{j>i} g(j) * (1/(j+1))   [or something similar?]\n\nBut the backward loop:\n\n    rem = 0\n    for i from n-1 down to 0:\n        oldrem = rem\n        rem += out[i] * (1/(i+1))   [but in the code it's invs(i) which is 1/i?]\n\n        out[i] = f(i) - oldrem   [but then we subtract oldrem?]\n\nBut the code does:\n\n        out[i] = out[i] - oldrem\n\nAnd then rem is updated by adding out[i] * (1/i) [if we interpret invs(i) as 1/i].\n\nBut note: the function `invs(i)` is defined as:\n\n    def invs(x):\n        return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\nAnd we know that:\n\n    fact[x] = x! \n    invfact[x] = 1/(x!) mod MOD.\n\nSo:\n\n    fact[x-1] * invfact[x] = (x-1)! / (x!) = 1/x mod MOD.\n\nSo invs(x) = 1/x mod MOD.\n\nTherefore, the backward loop:\n\n    rem += out[i] * (1/i)   [if i>=1]\n\nBut for i=0, we have 1/0 which is undefined.\n\nBut note: the forward loop only sets out[i] for i in [0, (n-1)//2]. For i>= (n+1)//2, out[i] is 0. And (n+1)//2 is at least 2 (since n>=3). So the smallest i in the forward loop is 0, but the backward loop starts at n-1 (which is at least 2) and goes down to 0. \n\nWe must avoid i=0 in the backward loop? But the code does not skip.\n\nHowever, note that the centroid can only be in the first (n+1)//2 vertices? Actually, the centroid must be a vertex that is not too small? But the example: n=3, vertex0 is a centroid. So we must compute for vertex0.\n\nBut the function `invs(0)` is called. This is an error.\n\nTherefore, the provided code has a bug. But the problem says: we are to fill in the missing lines. The missing line is the `inv` function. We cannot change the rest.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The function `invs` is provided, but we are not to change it. The backward loop is provided, we are not to change it.\n\nSo we must assume that the backward loop will never call `invs(0)`? But it does for i=0.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says: the total n>=3 and odd. The smallest vertex index is 0. But the centroid condition: the centroid must be a vertex that is not a leaf? But vertex0 can be a leaf? In the tree: \n    edges: 0-1, 1-2 -> then vertex0 is a leaf, and the centroid is vertex1.\n    edges: 0-1, 0-2 -> then vertex0 is the centroid.\n\nSo vertex0 can be the centroid.\n\nBut then we must compute `invs(0)`. This is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the provided code might be intended to use `invs(i+1)`? \n\nBut we are not allowed to change. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the array `out` is 0-indexed by the vertex index, but the centroid condition only holds for vertices that are not the smallest ones? \n\nBut the example: n=3, vertex0 is the centroid in one tree.\n\nSo we must have a valid `invs(0)`. How can we define `invs(0)`? \n\nWe can define `invs(0)` to be 0? But then the backward loop for i=0:\n\n    rem += out[0] * 0 = 0\n    out[0] = out[0] - oldrem   [which is the accumulated rem from i=1 and i=2]\n\nBut then out[0] is not adjusted by the inclusion exclusion? \n\nAlternatively, we can define `invs(0)` to be 1? But 1/0 is undefined.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must output the `inv` function and hope that the rest is correct? But the provided code for program2.py is not complete and has a potential bug.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing code for program2.py is only the `inv` function. The TODO in program1.py is the other missing part.\n\nSo we output:\n\n    For program1.py: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n    For program2.py: the function body for `inv` that computes the modular inverse.\n\nBut note: the problem says to output in JSON format:\n\n    {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nThe completion for program1.py is the line: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nThe completion for program2.py is the function body for `inv` as a string? But the function is:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut we must output only the body? Or the whole function? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The function `inv` is completely missing. So we output the whole function? But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nAlternatively, we output the missing block for program2.py as the string for the function body? But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We output the block that is missing.\n\nBut the code for program2.py has:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we should replace the TODO with the body.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    For program1: \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n    For program2: \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut note: the indentation. In program1, the missing line is inside the if block, so we must have the same indentation. The existing code has 8 spaces at the beginning of the line? Actually, the code for program1.py has:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nSo the TODO is at the same indentation level as the `if k != l` condition. We should add a line with 8 spaces (two levels of 4) and then the code.\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So for program1, we output the string: \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\". The existing code has 8 spaces for the inner block, so we use 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The structure:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    [missing line]   # this should be indented by 12 spaces? \n                if k != l:\n                    ...   # this is at 12 spaces\n\nBut the TODO is at 12 spaces. So the missing line should be at 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. So we output the string with the exact indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we output the line as it would appear in the program.\n\nSo for program1, the missing line is:\n\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut wait: the existing code has:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nWe are replacing the TODO comment with:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nSo the missing code is: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\" with 12 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the line should be indented by 4 more spaces relative to the `if` statement. In Python, we use 4 spaces per indent. The `if` is at 12 spaces (three indents: j-loop, k-loop, l-loop). Then the body of the `if` should be 16 spaces. But the existing code for the second condition is at 16 spaces? \n\nLooking at the second condition: it is at the same level as the `if j != l` condition, so it is not inside the `if j != l`. So the structure is:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    ...   # 16 spaces\n                if k != l:\n                    ...   # 16 spaces\n\nSo the missing line should be at 16 spaces. But the problem says: output only the missing code. So we output the string: \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nBut that is 16 spaces? Actually, the existing code for the second condition is:\n\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nwhich is 16 spaces (4 for each of the four indents). So we do the same.\n\nTherefore, for program1, we output: \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nBut note: the multiplication sign is the same as in the second condition.\n\nFor program2, we output the body of the `inv` function: \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning, because the function body is indented by 4 spaces).\n\nBut the function is:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the comment with the return statement, so the body is one line: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\".\n\nBut we must use the modulus MOD.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the JSON.\n\nHowever, let me test with the example n=3 for program2.py:\n\n    We have: \n        fact = [1,1,2]   for MAX=10**6, but we only need up to n-1=2.\n        invfact[2] = inv(2) = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD) -> which is (MOD+1)//2? \n        Then we compute:\n            for i in range((3+1)//2) = range(2): i=0,1.\n\n        i=0:\n            base = fact[2] = 2.\n            frac = comb(1,0) * invcomb(2,0) \n                comb(1,0) = fact[1] * invfact[0] * invfact[1] = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n                invcomb(2,0) = invfact[2] * fact[0] * fact[2] = (1/2) * 1 * 2 = 1? \n                So frac = 1 * 1 = 1.\n            out[0] = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n        i=1:\n            base = 2.\n            frac = comb(1,1) * invcomb(2,1)\n                comb(1,1)=1.\n                invcomb(2,1)= invfact[2] * fact[1] * fact[1] = (1/2) * 1 * 1 = 1/2 mod MOD.\n            out[1] = 2 * (1/2) = 1.\n\n        Then out = [2, 1, 0] (for indices 0,1,2).\n\n        Then backward loop:\n            i=2: \n                oldrem = 0\n                rem += out[2] * invs(2) = 0 * ... = 0.\n                out[2] = 0 - 0 = 0.\n            i=1:\n                oldrem = 0\n                rem += out[1] * invs(1) = 1 * 1 = 1 -> rem=1.\n                out[1] = 1 - 0 = 1.\n            i=0:\n                oldrem = 1\n                rem += out[0] * invs(0) -> but we defined invs(0) as: \n                    def invs(x):\n                        return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n                For x=0: fact[-1] is not defined -> error.\n\nSo we must avoid this. But we are not allowed to change the backward loop.\n\nTherefore, the provided code for program2.py might be intended to use a different indexing? Or the array `out` is not for vertex0 to vertex2, but for something else.\n\nBut the problem says: for the i-th vertex, output the answer. And the array `out` is printed as ' '.join(map(str,out)).\n\nSo we must have an answer for vertex0.\n\nGiven the constraints, we output the code as described and hope that the test cases do not include n=3? But they do.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says: the total n>=3 and odd, and n<200000. The smallest n is 3. So we must handle n=3.\n\nBut the function `invs` is defined for x>=1. In the forward loop, we set out[i] for i in [0, (n-1)//2]. For n=3, (n-1)//2 = 1, so i=0 and i=1. Then in the backward loop, we start at i=n-1=2, then i=1, then i=0. For i=0, we call invs(0) -> crash.\n\nTherefore, the provided code has a bug. But the problem says we are only to fill the missing parts. The missing parts are the `inv` function and the one line in program1.\n\nSo we must output the `inv` function and the line for program1, and hope that the invs(0) call is never made? But it is made.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the function `invs` to handle 0? But the problem says not to output the entire program. And we are only to output the missing parts.\n\nGiven the instructions, we output only the two missing parts and hope that the intended solution does not use i=0 in the backward loop? But it does.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we do as instructed.\n\nFinal output:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut to be safe, we note that in the backward loop, for i=0, we might have out[0] set and then we call invs(0). We can avoid this by not setting out[0] in the forward loop? But the forward loop includes i=0.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the centroid for vertex0 is computed differently? \n\nAfter rethinking, the known solution for centroids might be:\n\n    Let f(i) = (n-1)! * \\prod_{j} \\frac{ S_j }{ \\sum_{k} S_k } ... \n\nBut the provided solution is known from a known problem: \n\n    Problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1406/problem/C\n    But that is for unweighted trees, not for the specific attachment rule.\n\nAlternatively, the provided solution might be for: \n\n    \"Count the number of trees (with the given attachment rule) for which the centroid is the vertex i.\"\n\n    And the known generating function:\n\n        F(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 + x^{s_i})\n\n        where s_i is the size of the subtree? \n\n    But the provided code does:\n\n        out[i] = (n-1)! * C(n/2, i) / C(n-1, i)\n\n    and then an inclusion exclusion.\n\nGiven the time, we output the JSON as above."
