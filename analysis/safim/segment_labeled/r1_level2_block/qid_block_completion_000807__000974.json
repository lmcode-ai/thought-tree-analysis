  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight eaten by each to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py has a while loop that uses two pointers (e from the left and r from the right) and two variables (lowest for Alice's current total and highest for Bob's current total). The idea is to try to balance the two totals and record the total number of candies eaten (which is the sum of the left count and the right count) when the totals are equal.\n\nHowever, the current code has a TODO in the condition when Bob's total (highest) is less than Alice's total (lowest). Also, note that the condition for when they are equal is handled by then increasing Alice's side (which might be one way, but we must be cautious).\n\nWe note that the problem requires the maximum total candies. The approach is to use two pointers and:\n- Start with Alice having the first candy and Bob having the last candy.\n- Then, if Alice's total is less than Bob's, we add the next candy to Alice.\n- If Bob's total is less than Alice's, we add the next candy to Bob.\n- When they are equal, we record the current total candies eaten (which is the left count + right count) and then we try to add one more candy to Alice (and then continue) to see if we can get a longer sequence? But note the example: we might have multiple segments that are equal.\n\nHowever, the note in the code: when they are equal, the code currently adds the next candy to Alice. But that might break the balance. Instead, we should record the current total as a candidate and then try to extend? Actually, the problem says they can choose any contiguous segments from the left and right (without overlapping). So we are trying to find two non-overlapping contiguous segments (one at the left and one at the right) that have the same sum and maximize the total number of candies.\n\nBut note: the provided code does not record the candidate when they are equal? It sets `index = e + (m - r)`. However, we are in a loop that continues until the pointers meet? Also, the condition for the loop is `h+g <= m`? Actually, the variables `h` and `g` seem to be tracking the counts? But they are incremented only in the conditions? And the initial values are 1 for both? Actually, the initial setup: \n  e=0, r=m-1, so Alice has the first candy (lowest = lst[0]) and Bob has the last candy (highest = lst[m-1]). Then the counts: g is for Alice? and h for Bob? Actually, the initial counts: g=1 (Alice has 1 candy) and h=1 (Bob has 1 candy). Then the condition `h+g <= m` (so total candies eaten so far is at most m).\n\nBut the code in the equal branch does:\n  lowest += lst[e+1]\n  e += 1\n  g += 1\n\nThis is extending Alice. But then we break the balance? So we should record the candidate and then extend? Actually, the problem requires the maximum total candies. We can record the candidate when the sums are equal and then try to extend? However, the note in the problem: they can choose any contiguous segments. So we are free to choose any contiguous left and contiguous right. The two-pointer method is standard: we start with Alice at 0 and Bob at n-1. Then we move the left pointer if the left sum is less, the right if the right sum is less, and when they are equal we record and then we can move both? But note: we are allowed to extend independently? Actually, the problem does not require that we use contiguous segments that are adjacent? They can be separated by uneaten candies.\n\nBut the method: we want to maximize the count. So when we have an equal sum, we record the total candies (left count + right count) and then we can try to extend? Actually, the standard solution for this problem (which is known) is:\n\n  left = 0\n  right = n-1\n  left_sum = 0\n  right_sum = 0\n  ans = 0\n  while left <= right:\n      if left_sum < right_sum:\n          left_sum += arr[left]\n          left += 1\n      elif left_sum > right_sum:\n          right_sum += arr[right]\n          right -= 1\n      else:\n          # When they are equal, we record the current total candies: left - 0 + (n-1 - right) + ...?\n          # Actually, the number of candies eaten so far: left (from 0 to left-1) and from right+1 to n-1? \n          # But note: we have not included the current pointers? Actually, we are building the sums without including the current pointers? \n          # Let me reframe: we start with no candies. Then we add until we get an equal sum. Then we record the total candies: left_count + (n-1 - right) \n          # But in the code provided, they start by having one candy each? So the initial state: left_sum = arr[0], right_sum = arr[n-1], and then we start.\n\n  Actually, the provided code starts with:\n      e=0, r=m-1\n      lowest = lst[0]   -> Alice has the first candy\n      highest = lst[m-1] -> Bob has the last candy\n\n  Then the counts: g=1 (for Alice) and h=1 (for Bob). But note: the condition `h+g <= m` is the total candies eaten so far? Then we do:\n\n  The problem: the provided code does not have a variable for Bob's count? Actually, we see:\n      In the condition for Bob: we have a TODO.\n\n  Let me try to complete the code:\n\n  We have:\n      if lowest < highest: \n          we add the next candy to Alice (from the left: e+1) and update g (which is Alice's count) and e.\n      elif highest < lowest:\n          we should add the next candy to Bob (from the right: r-1) and update h (which is Bob's count) and r.\n      else: # equal\n          we record the current total candies: which is g (from Alice) + h (from Bob) -> but note: the problem says they eat in total the candies. And then we extend Alice? Why? Actually, we can also extend Bob? But the code extends Alice. However, we can break the balance? But we are trying to maximize the total candies. We record the candidate and then we extend one of them? Actually, we can do: record the candidate (so set index = g + h) and then we extend Alice? Then we break the balance and then we continue? \n\n  However, the note: the problem says they can choose any contiguous segments. So we are free to choose any. The two-pointer method: when we have an equal sum, we record the total candies (g+h) and then we can extend either side? But if we extend both, we break the balance? Actually, we can only extend one? But then we break the balance? \n\n  The standard solution: when the sums are equal, we record the total candies (left_count + right_count) and then we reset? Actually, no. We record and then we extend the left? Why? Actually, we can continue: we record the candidate and then we extend the left (so we break the balance) and then we continue the process? Because we might get another equal later? \n\n  Example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] \n      Initially: \n          Alice: [1] -> 1\n          Bob: [1] -> 1 -> equal -> record 2 candies.\n          Then we extend Alice: [1,2] -> 3\n          Then Bob: 1 < 3 -> extend Bob: [1,2] -> 3 -> then equal? Then record 4 candies? But wait, the two segments: [1,2] and [2,1] -> but they are not contiguous? Actually, the Bob segment is the last two? But note: the Bob segment is contiguous from the right. So the entire array: [1,2] from the left and [2,1] from the right? But they overlap? Actually, the left segment is [0:2] and the right segment is [4:6]? So they don't overlap. Then total candies: 4.\n\n  But the example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> the maximum is 6? Because Alice can take [1,2,3] and Bob [3,2,1] -> both sum to 6. How do we get that?\n\n  We need to continue: after we record 2, we extend Alice to 3 (so 1+2=3) and then Bob is 1 -> then we extend Bob to 1+2=3? Then we have equal again? Then we record 4? Then we extend Alice: 1+2+3=6, then Bob: 1+2=3 -> then we extend Bob: 1+2+3=6 -> then we record 6? Then we extend Alice? But then we run out? \n\n  However, the condition: we cannot let the pointers cross. So we must break when the pointers meet? \n\n  The provided code: \n      while h+g <= m:   # total candies eaten so far is at most m? Actually, we have not eaten more than m.\n\n  Steps for [1,2,3,3,2,1] (n=6):\n      e=0, r=5 -> lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal -> then we set index = e + (m - r) = 0 + (6-5) = 1? That doesn't seem right. Then we extend Alice: e becomes 1, g becomes 2, then lowest = 1+2=3.\n      Then condition: 3>1 -> then we extend Bob: we need to add the next candy from Bob? But the current Bob has only the last candy. So we add the next one: r becomes 4, and then highest = 1+2=3? Then we have equal? Then we set index = e + (m - r) = 1 + (6-4)=1+2=3? Then we extend Alice: e becomes 2, g=3, lowest=3+3=6.\n      Then condition: 6>3 -> extend Bob: r becomes 3, highest=3+3=6 -> equal -> set index = 2 + (6-3)=2+3=5? Then extend Alice: e becomes 3 -> but then e=3 and r=3 -> they meet? Then the condition: h+g = 3 (Bob) + 4 (Alice) = 7? which is >6 -> break. Then we print 5? But the expected is 6.\n\n  What went wrong? The total candies when we have the last equal: Alice has 3 candies (indices0,1,2) and Bob has 3 candies (indices3,4,5). So the total is 6. But the code recorded 5? \n\n  The problem: the variable `index` is set to `e + (m - r)`. \n      Initially: e=0, r=5 -> m=6 -> then index = 0 + (6-5)=1 -> then after the first equal we set index=1.\n      Then we extend Alice: e becomes 1 -> then Bob: r becomes 4 -> then we set index = 1 + (6-4)=3.\n      Then we extend Alice: e becomes 2 -> then Bob: r becomes 3 -> then we set index = 2 + (6-3)=5.\n      Then we extend Alice: e becomes 3 -> then the condition: h+g = 3 (Bob) + 4 (Alice) = 7 -> break.\n\n  But we never recorded the last equal? We recorded at the moment of equal and then we extended? So we should record the candidate and then extend? But the candidate at the last equal was 6? How do we get 6? \n\n  Actually, when we are at the state: \n      Alice: [0,1,2] -> e=2 (so next available left is 3) and Bob: [5,4,3] -> r=3 (so next available right is 2). \n      Then the total candies eaten: Alice has 3, Bob has 3 -> total 6.\n\n  How to compute: \n      The number of candies Alice has: e (if we consider that e is the next index to take? Actually, the code uses e as the last taken index? Then the count is e+1? But the variable g is the count for Alice. Similarly, h for Bob.\n\n  But the code: \n      Initially: g=1, h=1.\n      Then when we extend Alice: we do g+=1 -> so g becomes 2, then 3, then 4? \n      Similarly, when we extend Bob: we do ... but we don't have code for Bob? \n\n  The TODO: \n      In the condition `elif highest<lowest:`, we need to do:\n          highest += lst[r-1]   # because we are extending Bob to the next candy to the left of the current last taken?\n          r -= 1\n          h += 1\n\n  But note: the current Bob has taken the candy at index r (which is the current right pointer). To extend, we take the next candy to the left: at index r-1. Then we update r to r-1 and increase h (Bob's count) by 1.\n\n  Then, in the equal branch, we set index = e + (m - r) -> but wait, what is e? e is the last taken index for Alice? Then the count for Alice is e? Actually, we started at index0 and then we extended to e+1? Actually, the initial e=0 (taken the first candy). Then when we extend, we do e+=1 and then take the next candy? So the count for Alice is e+1? But we have a variable g that counts. Similarly, the count for Bob: the initial r=m-1, then when we extend Bob we do r-=1, so the count for Bob is (m-1 - r) + 1? Actually, the number of candies Bob has is the initial one plus the ones we added? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use g and h to record the counts. Then when we have an equal sum, the total candies is g+h. So we can set index = g+h? \n\n  But note: the problem says the total number of candies they eat. So we can set index = g+h when we have an equal sum? Then we want the maximum index? \n\n  So we should change: \n      In the equal branch: \n          we set index = max(index, g+h)   # because we want the maximum total candies? \n          and then we extend Alice? Why? Because we are in the middle? We can extend either? But if we extend only one, we break the balance? But we are going to continue? \n\n  However, we must break the balance to try to get a longer sequence? \n\n  But the example: we have [1,1] -> \n      Initially: \n          Alice: 1, Bob: 1 -> equal -> set index = 2 (if we do g+h=1+1=2) -> then we extend Alice: e becomes 1 -> then we have Alice: 1+1=2, Bob:1 -> then we extend Bob? But there is no more candy for Bob? Then condition: h+g = 1+2=3 -> which is >2 -> break. Then we output 2.\n\n  But what if we have [1,1,1]? \n      Start: \n          Alice:1, Bob:1 -> equal -> candidate=2.\n          Then extend Alice: e=1, g=2, lowest=2.\n          Then condition: 2>1 -> extend Bob: r=1, h=2, highest=1+1=2 -> equal -> candidate = max(2, 2+2)=4? But wait, the total candies is 4? But the array only has 3. And they cannot both take 2 candies because the middle candy would be taken by both? \n\n  So we must avoid overlapping. The condition: the pointers must not cross. Actually, we have e and r: \n      Initially: e=0, r=2 (for n=3). \n      After the first equal: we extend Alice: e becomes 1 -> then we extend Bob: r becomes 1 -> now e=1 and r=1 -> they are at the same candy? Then we have taken the middle candy twice? \n\n  Therefore, we must break when e >= r? \n\n  The condition of the while loop: `h+g <= m` -> but m=3, and initially h+g=2, then we extend Alice: h+g=3, then extend Bob: h+g=4 -> which is >3 -> break? So we don't do the Bob extension? \n\n  Actually, the condition: \n      while h+g <= m: \n          ... \n      So when we extend Bob: we do h+=1 -> then h+g becomes 3 (if we started with 2) -> then we do the next iteration? Then we extend Bob: then h+g becomes 4 -> then we break? \n\n  But in the [1,1,1] example: \n      Step1: equal -> candidate=2, then extend Alice: g=2, e=1, lowest=2 -> then condition: 2>1 -> then we do Bob: \n          highest = 1 + lst[1] = 1+1=2 -> r becomes 1, h becomes 2 -> then condition: 2==2 -> then we set candidate = max(2, 2+2)=4? But that's invalid.\n\n  We must not count the same candy twice. The candy at index1 is taken by both? \n\n  Therefore, we must break the loop when e >= r? \n\n  Actually, the condition: we should not let e and r cross. Specifically, we should break when e >= r? \n\n  So we can add a condition: if e >= r: break? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the condition of the while loop to: while e < r and h+g <= m? \n\n  But note: the condition h+g<=m is always true? Because we start with 2 and then we add one at a time until we have at most m? Actually, the maximum is m. So we can break when e>=r.\n\n  So we can do: \n      while e < r:   # because if e==r, then we are at the same candy? and if e>r, then we have crossed.\n\n  But the provided code uses `h+g<=m` and the initial h+g=2. \n\n  Let me restructure the code to use two pointers without h and g? Actually, we can use e and r as the pointers and then the counts are: \n      Alice: e - 0 + 1? -> but we start at 0, so count = e+1? \n      Bob: m-1 - r + 1? -> count = m - r? \n\n  Actually, the initial: \n      e=0 -> Alice has taken [0] -> count=1.\n      r=m-1 -> Bob has taken [m-1] -> count=1.\n\n  Then when we extend Alice: we take e+1 -> then e becomes 1 -> count becomes 2? \n  Similarly, Bob: we take r-1 -> then r becomes m-2 -> count becomes 2.\n\n  So the total candies = (e+1) + (m - r) \n\n  Therefore, in the equal branch, we can set: \n      candidate = (e+1) + (m - r)   # because Alice has taken [0..e] -> count=e+1, Bob has taken [r..m-1] -> count = m-1 - r + 1 = m - r.\n\n  Then we can set: \n      index = max(index, candidate)\n\n  And then we extend? But we can extend either? Actually, we can extend both? But then we break the balance? But we are going to continue? \n\n  However, we must extend one of them? Because if we don't, we are stuck. So we extend Alice? \n\n  But note: we might have multiple equal segments. \n\n  So the plan for the while loop: \n      while e < r:   # we break when e>=r\n          if lowest < highest:\n              e += 1\n              lowest += lst[e]\n          elif highest < lowest:\n              r -= 1\n              highest += lst[r]\n          else: \n              candidate = (e+1) + (m - r)\n              index = candidate   # but we want the maximum? so we do index = max(index, candidate)\n              # Then we extend one side? Let's extend Alice? \n              e += 1\n              lowest += lst[e]\n\n      But what if after extending Alice we break the balance? Then we continue the loop? \n\n  However, we must also consider: we might get an equal again? \n\n  But note: we are moving the pointers independently. \n\n  But the problem: we might miss an opportunity if we only extend Alice? For example, we might have an equal again by extending Bob? \n\n  Actually, we can extend either? But we are free to choose? The standard solution: when they are equal, we record and then we extend the left? Why? Because we are going to continue the process? \n\n  However, we can also extend the right? But the problem is symmetric? \n\n  But note: we must avoid infinite loops? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do: \n      else:\n          candidate = (e+1) + (m - r)\n          index = max(index, candidate)\n          # We extend the left? \n          e += 1\n          if e < r:   # to avoid index out of bounds\n              lowest += lst[e]\n\n  But then we might break the balance? \n\n  However, the standard solution for \"Two Substrings\" (codeforces problem) is to do:\n\n      i = 0\n      j = n-1\n      left_sum = 0\n      right_sum = 0\n      ans = 0\n      while i <= j:\n          if left_sum < right_sum:\n              left_sum += a[i]\n              i += 1\n          elif right_sum < left_sum:\n              right_sum += a[j]\n              j -= 1\n          else:\n              ans = i + (n - 1 - j)   # because Alice has taken [0, i-1] -> count = i, Bob has taken [j+1, n-1] -> count = n-1 - j\n              # Then we extend the left? \n              left_sum += a[i]\n              i += 1\n\n      But note: the above does not record the candidate when we break? \n\n  Actually, we can also record at the end? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      i = 0\n      j = n-1\n      left_sum = 0\n      right_sum = 0\n      ans = 0\n      while i < j:\n          if left_sum == right_sum:\n              ans = i + (n - j)   # because Alice has taken i candies (from 0 to i-1) and Bob has taken n - j candies (from j to n-1)\n          if left_sum <= right_sum:\n              left_sum += a[i]\n              i += 1\n          else:\n              right_sum += a[j]\n              j -= 1\n\n      # But then we might have an equal at the end? \n\n  Actually, the known solution for the problem (from codeforces) is:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          ans = 0\n          while i <= j:\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  ans = i + (n - j - 1)   # because Alice has taken [0, i-1] -> count = i, Bob has taken [j+1, n-1] -> count = n-1 - j, so total = i + (n-1-j) = i + n - j - 1\n              if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += a[i]\n                  i += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += a[j]\n                  j -= 1\n          if left_sum == right_sum and i<=j+1:   # but we break when i>j? \n              ans = i + (n - j - 1)\n          print(ans)\n\n  But wait, the example [1,2,3,3,2,1] (n=6):\n      We want ans=6.\n\n      Steps:\n          Initially: i=0, j=5, left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal -> ans = 0 + (6-5-1)=0 -> then because left_sum<=right_sum (0<=0) -> add a[0]=1 -> left_sum=1, i=1.\n          Then: 1 and 0 -> then add to right: a[5]=1 -> right_sum=1, j=4.\n          Then: 1==1 -> ans = 1 + (6-4-1)=1+1=2.\n          Then: left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[1]=2 -> left_sum=3, i=2.\n          Then: 3>1 -> add to right: a[4]=2 -> right_sum=3, j=3.\n          Then: 3==3 -> ans = 2 + (6-3-1)=2+2=4.\n          Then: left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[2]=3 -> left_sum=6, i=3.\n          Then: 6>3 -> add to right: a[3]=3 -> right_sum=6, j=2.\n          Then i=3, j=2 -> break? \n          Then we check: if left_sum==right_sum and i<=j+1 -> 6==6 and 3<=3 -> true -> then ans = 3 + (6-2-1)=3+3=6.\n\n      So we output 6.\n\n  Therefore, we can use:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          ans = 0\n          while i <= j:\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  # record candidate: the total candies eaten so far: i (on the left) and (n-1 - j) on the right -> total = i + (n-1 - j)\n                  ans = i + (n-1 - j)\n              if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += a[i]\n                  i += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += a[j]\n                  j -= 1\n          if left_sum == right_sum:\n              # then we can record again? \n              ans = i + (n-1 - j)\n          print(ans)\n\n  But note: the total candies when we break: \n      The left has taken [0, i-1] -> count = i\n      The right has taken [j+1, n-1] -> count = n-1 - j\n      So total = i + (n-1 - j) = i + n - j - 1\n\n  However, the example [1,1] (n=2):\n      i=0, j=1: \n          left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal -> ans = 0 + (2-1-1)=0.\n          Then left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[0]=1 -> left_sum=1, i=1.\n          Then i<=j: 1<=1 -> then left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> then we do else: add a[1]=1 -> right_sum=1, j=0.\n          Then i=1, j=0 -> break.\n          Then check: left_sum==right_sum (1==1) -> then ans = 1 + (2-0-1)=1+1=2 -> output 2.\n\n  But the example [1,2] (n=2):\n      i=0, j=1:\n          left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal -> ans=0.\n          Then left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[0]=1 -> i=1.\n          Then i<=j: 1<=1 -> then left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> then we add a[1]=2 -> right_sum=2, j=0.\n          Then break. Then check: 1==2? no -> then output the last recorded ans? which was 0? \n          But the expected is 0? because they cannot have the same total? \n\n  So that matches.\n\n  Therefore, we can change the code in program1.py to:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      for i in range(n):\n          m = int(input())\n          lst = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          i_left = 0\n          i_right = m-1\n          ans = 0\n          while i_left <= i_right:\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  # record the total candies: \n                  #   left candies: from 0 to i_left-1 -> count = i_left\n                  #   right candies: from i_right+1 to m-1 -> count = m-1 - i_right\n                  ans = i_left + (m - 1 - i_right)\n              if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += lst[i_left]\n                  i_left += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += lst[i_right]\n                  i_right -= 1\n          if left_sum == right_sum:\n              ans = i_left + (m - 1 - i_right)\n          print(ans)\n\n  But wait, the example [1,1] gives 2, which is correct. [1,2] gives 0, which is correct. [1,2,3,3,2,1] gives 6, which is correct.\n\n  However, the provided code in the problem has a different structure. We are allowed to change the code? \n\n  The provided code:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      for i in range(n):\n          h = 1\n          g = 1\n          counter = 0\n          m = int(input())\n          lst = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          index =0\n          e= 0\n          r =m-1\n          highest = lst[m-1]\n          lowest = lst[0]\n          while h+g <= m:\n              if lowest<highest:\n                  lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                  e+=1\n                  g +=1\n              elif highest<lowest:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              elif highest == lowest:\n                  lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                  e+=1\n                  g+=1\n                  index = e + (m - r)\n          print(index)\n\n  We are to complete the TODO. But the above standard solution is simpler. However, the problem says: output only the missing code? And we are to output in a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". \n\n  But note: the provided code for program1.py has a while condition `h+g<=m` and we are to complete the `elif highest<lowest` block. Also, the code in the equal branch is already written? But it is not recording the maximum? It is overwriting index? \n\n  We can try to fix the provided code? \n\n  The provided code uses:\n      e: the last index taken by Alice (so the next available is e+1) -> the count for Alice is g.\n      r: the last index taken by Bob (so the next available is r-1) -> the count for Bob is h.\n\n  Then the total candies when they are equal: g + h.\n\n  We want the maximum g+h over the entire process.\n\n  So we should do: \n      In the equal branch: \n          index = max(index, g+h)   # because we want the maximum total candies? \n          and then we extend Alice? \n\n  But then we break the balance? \n\n  Then the condition for the while loop: h+g<=m -> we break when the total candies eaten is more than m? \n\n  We also need to avoid overlapping: we must not let e>=r? \n\n  So we can change the while condition to: while e < r and h+g <= m? \n\n  Actually, the condition h+g<=m is redundant? because we are adding one at a time and we start at 2 and we break when e>=r? \n\n  But the problem: the provided code does not break when e>=r? \n\n  We can complete the TODO for the Bob extension:\n\n      elif highest<lowest:\n          highest += lst[r-1]\n          r -= 1\n          h += 1\n\n  And then in the equal branch, we do:\n      index = max(index, g+h)   # record the candidate\n      # Then we extend Alice? \n      if e+1 < r:   # to avoid taking the same candy? \n          lowest += lst[e+1]\n          e += 1\n          g += 1\n      else:\n          break   # because we cannot extend Alice? \n\n  But then we might miss extending Bob? \n\n  Alternatively, we can extend Alice unconditionally? But then we might go out of bounds? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      elif highest == lowest:\n          # record candidate\n          index = max(index, g+h)\n          # Then we extend Alice if possible? \n          if e+1 < r:   # there is at least one candy between e and r? \n              lowest += lst[e+1]\n              e += 1\n              g += 1\n          else:\n              break\n\n  But then what if we can extend Bob? We are not symmetric? \n\n  However, the problem: we are free to extend either? But if we extend Alice, then we break the balance? Then the next iteration will fix? \n\n  But the example [1,1,1]: \n      Start: \n          e=0, r=2, g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal: index = max(0, 2)=2.\n          Then we extend Alice: e=1, g=2, lowest=2.\n          Then condition: 2>1 -> then we extend Bob: \n              highest = 1 + lst[1] = 1+1=2, r=1, h=2.\n          Then condition: 2==2 -> index = max(2, 4)=4 -> then we extend Alice: but e+1=2 and r=1 -> e+1>r -> break.\n          Then output 4? but expected is 2? because they cannot both take 2 candies? \n\n  Actually, the problem: the candy at index1 is taken by both? \n\n  Therefore, we must not extend if e+1 >= r? \n\n  But in the standard solution, we break when the pointers cross? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the while condition to: while e < r-1 and h+g <= m:   # so that after extending, we have e < r? \n\n  But the initial condition: e=0, r=2 -> then we can extend? \n\n  However, the provided code does not have a break condition for pointers crossing? \n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem says the total n over test cases is <=200000, we can use the standard solution. But we are only allowed to output the missing code? \n\n  The problem: we are to complete the TODO in the provided code. \n\n  So for program1.py, we are to complete the `elif highest<lowest:` block.\n\n  We write:\n      highest += lst[r-1]\n      r -= 1\n      h += 1\n\n  But then the equal branch is already written? But it is not recording the maximum? It is setting index = e + (m - r) and then extending Alice? \n\n  We must also change the equal branch to record the maximum? \n\n  However, the problem says: output only the missing code? \n\n  But the TODO is only in the `elif highest<lowest` block. \n\n  But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> so we might need to change more? \n\n  But the instruction: \"Output only the missing code\" -> and the missing code is the TODO block? \n\n  But the example output format: \n      {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  So for program1, we output the completion for the TODO block? \n\n  However, the TODO block is only one line? \n\n  But the provided code in the equal branch might be flawed? \n\n  But the problem says: we are to fill in the missing lines or blocks. \n\n  Since the TODO is only in the `elif highest<lowest`, we complete that block.\n\n  But note: the example test cases: \n      The first test case: \n          Input: \n              1\n              2\n              1 1\n          Expected: 2\n\n      With the provided code and our completion for the Bob extension, and without changing the equal branch:\n\n          Start: \n              e=0, r=1, g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal branch: \n                  then we do: \n                      lowest += lst[e+1] -> lst[1]=1 -> lowest=2\n                      e=1\n                      g=2\n                      index = e + (m - r) = 1 + (2-1)=1+1=2.\n          Then condition: h+g = 1+2=3 <=2? -> no, break? \n          Then output 2.\n\n      So it works.\n\n      Second test case: \n          Input: \n              1\n              3\n              1 1 1\n          Expected: 0? or 2? \n\n          But the note: For the third test case, there is no way to have non-zero -> but the third test case is different.\n\n          The example: \n              \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n          But the fourth test case: \n              Input: \n                  1\n                  7\n                  [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]\n              Expected: 7\n\n          How does the provided code work for the fourth test case? \n\n          It's complex. \n\n  Given the time, we output for program1.py the completion for the TODO block:\n\n      highest += lst[r-1]\n      r -= 1\n      h += 1\n\n  But wait, the array index: when r is the current right pointer (which is the last candy taken by Bob), then the next candy to the left is at r-1. \n\n  However, we must be cautious: the initial r = m-1. Then to extend, we take r-1? \n\n  But the first extension for Bob: \n      highest = lst[m-1] (initial) \n      then we do: highest += lst[r-1] = lst[m-2] -> then r becomes m-2, and h becomes 2.\n\n  That matches.\n\n  But the fourth test case: \n      n=7, lst = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> wait, 8 elements? \n      The input: the second line has 7 integers? \n\n  The problem says: the second line of each test case contains n integers.\n\n  So n=7 -> 7 integers: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11]? \n\n  But the example: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n  That is 8 candies? \n\n  Actually, the example says: \n      \"the fourth test case: Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\"\n\n  But the input has 7 candies? \n\n  Let me count: \n      [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> 8 candies? \n\n  The problem says: the first line of the test case is n=7. \n\n  So it should be 7 candies. \n\n  The example: \n      They each eat 30: \n          Alice: 7+3+20 = 30\n          Bob: 10+8+11+1 = 30 -> but that is 4 candies? \n      Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n  But the array has 7 candies: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11] -> then Bob's candies: from the right: [11,8,10] -> 11+8+10=29? \n\n  Or is the array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] with n=8? \n\n  The problem says: the first line of the test case contains n=7. \n\n  This is confusing. \n\n  But the example output is 7. \n\n  How can we get 7? \n      They eat 7 candies in total: so 3 by Alice and 4 by Bob? \n      But the array has 7 candies, so they must be eating all? \n\n  But then the middle candy (the 4th) is not eaten? \n\n  The array: \n      [7,3,20,5,10,8,11] \n      Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n      Bob: [10,8,11] -> 10+8+11=29 -> not equal.\n\n  Or Bob: [11,8,10,5] -> 11+8+10+5=34? \n\n  The example says: Bob eats from the right. So the last candy is 11, then 8, then 10, then 5? But 5 is not at the right? \n\n  The example: \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\" -> so the array must have an 1 at the end? \n\n  Therefore, the array is 8 elements: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] and n=8? \n\n  But the problem says: the first line of the test case is n=7. \n\n  This is a discrepancy. \n\n  The note: \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n  So the array has at least 7 candies? \n\n  Let me assume the array is: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] and n=8. \n\n  Then the test case: \n      t=1\n      n=8\n      list = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n  We want to achieve 7 total candies.\n\n  How? \n      Alice: [7,3,20] -> index0,1,2 -> sum=30\n      Bob: [1,11,8,10] -> index7,6,5,4 -> sum=1+11+8+10=30\n      Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n  In the provided code:\n\n      e=0, r=7 (0-indexed, r=7)\n      lowest = 7, highest=1 -> lowest>highest -> we do the TODO block: \n          highest += lst[6] = 1+11=12, r=6, h=2.\n      Then lowest=7, highest=12 -> then we extend Alice: \n          lowest += lst[1] = 7+3=10, e=1, g=2.\n      Then lowest=10, highest=12 -> extend Alice: \n          lowest += lst[2]=10+20=30, e=2, g=3.\n      Then lowest=30, highest=12 -> extend Bob: \n          highest += lst[5]=12+8=20 -> then extend Bob: highest += lst[4]=20+10=30, r=4, h=4.\n      Then lowest=30, highest=30 -> equal: \n          index = e + (m - r) = 2 + (8-4)=2+4=6 -> then we extend Alice: \n          e=3, g=4, lowest=30+5=35.\n      Then condition: h+g=4+4=8<=8 -> true.\n          Then 35>30 -> extend Bob: but r=4, then next is r-1=3 -> but then we would be taking the candy at index3 (which is 5) and that is between Alice and Bob? \n          But Alice has taken [0,1,2,3] and Bob [4,5,6,7] -> then the candy at index3 is taken by Alice and index4 by Bob? \n          Then we do: \n              highest += lst[3] = 30+5=35 -> then equal? \n          Then index = 3 + (8-3)=3+5=8? \n          Then we extend Alice: e=4 -> but e=4 and r=3 -> then condition fails? \n\n      Then we output 8? but expected is 7.\n\n  So the provided code (even with the TODO) does not work for the fourth test case? \n\n  The issue: the equal branch should record the candidate and then extend, but we are not recording the maximum candidate? In the fourth test case, we had a candidate of 6 (when e=2 and r=4) and then we extended and got 8, which is not valid because there are only 8 candies and they would be eating all, but then the sums are not equal? \n\n  Actually, when we extend after an equal, we break the balance, but we might get a new equal later? \n\n  But in the fourth test case, after the first equal (at e=2 and r=4) we have total candies=6, which is a candidate. Then we extend Alice to e=3, and then we extend Bob to r=3, and then we have a new equal at 35, and then we record 8? \n\n  But 8 is the entire array, and the sums are 7+3+20+5 = 35 and 10+8+11+1=30+5=35? -> but wait, Bob's part: we added the 5? which is at index3? but Alice also took index3? \n\n  So we are double-counting the candy at index3.\n\n  Therefore, we must not let the pointers cross. \n\n  We should change the while condition to: while e < r and h+g <= m: \n\n  But then in the fourth test case, after the first equal (e=2, r=4) -> then we extend Alice: e=3, then condition: e<r? 3<4 -> true. Then we have lowest=35, highest=30 -> then we extend Bob: r=3, then e=3 and r=3 -> then we break because e<r fails? \n\n  Then we never record the second equal? \n\n  And the candidate from the first equal is 6, but expected is 7.\n\n  How to get 7? \n      We must record the candidate at the first equal: 6, and then also at the state when e=2 and r=3? -> but then the sums are not equal? \n\n  Alternatively, we record the candidate only when the sums are equal. \n\n  In the fourth test case, the only time the sums are equal is at e=2, r=4 (candidate=6) and then at the end when e=3 and r=3 (which is not allowed) and then when we have e=3 and r=4 (which is not equal) and then after extending Bob to r=3, we have highest=30+10+8+11+1? -> no, we added only until r=4.\n\n  This is very complex. \n\n  Given the time, and since the problem says the total n over test cases is <=200000, we use the standard two-pointer method that is known to work. \n\n  But we are only allowed to output the missing code for the TODO block? \n\n  We output for program1.py the TODO block as:\n\n      highest += lst[r-1]\n      r -= 1\n      h += 1\n\n  And hope that the equal branch will eventually catch the maximum? \n\n  But the fourth test case might fail. \n\n  However, the problem's example of the fourth test case might have been with n=8? \n\n  And the provided code might work for n=8? \n\n  Let me run the provided code (with the TODO) for [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] (n=8) and m=8.\n\n  Initial:\n      e=0, r=7, g=1, h=1, lowest=7, highest=1 -> highest<lowest -> do TODO: \n          highest = 1 + lst[6] = 1+11=12, r=6, h=2.\n      then lowest=7, highest=12 -> extend Alice: \n          lowest =7+3=10, e=1, g=2.\n      then lowest=10, highest=12 -> extend Alice: \n          lowest=10+20=30, e=2, g=3.\n      then lowest=30, highest=12 -> extend Bob: \n          highest=12+8=20, r=5, h=3.\n      then lowest=30, highest=20 -> extend Bob: \n          highest=20+10=30, r=4, h=4.\n      then equal: \n          index = e + (m - r) = 2 + (8-4)=2+4=6.\n          Then extend Alice: \n          e=3, g=4, lowest=30+5=35.\n      then condition: h+g=4+4=8<=8 -> true.\n          then 35>30 -> extend Bob: \n          highest=30+lst[3]=30+5=35, r=3, h=5.\n      then equal: \n          index = 3 + (8-3)=3+5=8.\n          Then extend Alice: e=4, but then e=4 and r=3 -> then condition: h+g=5+5=10>8 -> break.\n      then print 8.\n\n  But expected is 7.\n\n  So the provided code with the TODO and without changes to the equal branch does not work. \n\n  Therefore, we must change the equal branch to record the maximum. \n\n  But the problem: we are to output only the missing code. \n\n  Since the TODO is only in the `elif highest<lowest` block, and the equal branch is not missing, we only output the TODO block. \n\n  And hope that the intended solution is different. \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might have a note: the sum of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can use a different method? \n\n  Given the instructions, we output for program1.py the TODO block as:\n\n      highest += lst[r-1]\n      r -= 1\n      h += 1\n\n  For program2.py, we have to complete the function f(l).\n\n  The problem: \n      We are given an array a of n positive integers.\n      We start with b_i = 0 for each i.\n      In one move, we can choose an i and either add a_i or subtract a_i to b_i.\n      We want b to be strictly increasing.\n      We want the minimum number of moves.\n\n  The provided code: \n\n      n=int(input())\n      l=[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n\n      def f(l):\n          cur = 0\n          n = 0\n          for i in l:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          return n\n\n      print(min(f(l[i+1:])+f(l[:i][::-1]) for i in range(n)))\n\n  The function f is called on subarrays. And the final answer is the minimum over i of f(l[i+1:]) + f(l[:i][::-1]).\n\n  What is the function f doing? \n\n  The note: \n      Example1: n=5, a = [1,2,1,3,1] -> output=4.\n      Example2: n=7, a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> output=10.\n\n  The intended solution: \n      We can consider that the array b must satisfy: \n          b0 < b1 < b2 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\n      We start at 0 for each. \n\n      We can do: \n          b0 can be either -a0 or a0.\n          b1 can be either -a1 or a1, but we require b0 < b1.\n\n      This is a dynamic programming problem. \n\n  However, the provided structure: \n      We are splitting the array at index i, and then we call f on the prefix (reversed) and f on the suffix. \n\n  What could f be? \n\n  One possibility: f(l) might be the minimum moves to make the array l into a increasing sequence starting from 0, but with the condition that the first element can be either positive or negative? \n\n  But the array l in f might be for a contiguous segment. \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might be solved by: \n      We choose an index i as the \"root\" or the turning point? \n      Then the part to the left of i (reversed) should be decreasing (because we are coming from the right) and the part to the right should be increasing.\n\n  But the array b must be increasing from left to right. \n\n  If we choose a particular index i to be the minimum, then:\n      To the left of i: we must have a decreasing sequence (because as we go left we are going to more negative) and to the right an increasing sequence.\n\n  And the moves: for each element, we can choose to add or subtract. \n\n  For the left part (reversed): we want a sequence that is increasing in the reversed order, which means in the original order (left part) it is decreasing. \n\n  So the function f(l) might be the minimum moves to make the array l into a decreasing sequence? or increasing? \n\n  Let me read the function call: \n      f(l[i+1:]) -> the suffix, which is from index i+1 to the end. \n      f(l[:i][::-1]) -> the prefix up to i-1, reversed.\n\n  And the suffix should be increasing? and the reversed prefix should be increasing in the reversed order (which means the prefix is decreasing).\n\n  So the function f might be defined for an array to make it increasing with the minimum moves, but with the freedom of choosing sign for each element? \n\n  However, the problem: for a given array, what is the minimum moves to make it increasing (strictly) if for each element we can choose either a_i or -a_i? \n\n  This is a classic problem. \n\n  We can use greedy: \n      We want b0 < b1 < b2 < ...\n      We can choose b0 = -a0 or a0.\n      For b1: we can choose -a1 or a1, and we require b0 < b1.\n\n  We can do a DP with the state being the last value. But the values can be very large. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a greedy method: \n      Let's set the first element to -a0. (or a0, whichever gives a lower value for the next)\n      But it's not clear. \n\n  There is a known solution for the minimum moves to make the array increasing with sign choice: \n      We want to minimize the number of sign changes? But the moves: each time we choose a sign, it counts as one move? \n\n      Actually, the cost for each element is 1 if we change from the natural positive to negative, but initially it's 0, and we can choose. \n\n      But the cost is: for each element, regardless of what we choose, it costs one move? \n          No: the move is defined as adding or subtracting. Initially b_i=0. Then we do one move: either add a_i (then b_i = a_i) or subtract a_i (then b_i = -a_i). \n\n      So for each element, we have two choices, and it costs one move either way. \n\n      Therefore, the cost is fixed per element: one move per element. But then the total moves would be n, but we are allowed to choose signs arbitrarily. \n\n      However, the examples: \n          Example1: [1,2,1,3,1] -> 4 moves.\n          Example2: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> 10 moves.\n\n      So it's not n. \n\n  Let me read the example1: \n      \"you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively. The final array will be [-1,0,3,4,5] after 4 moves.\"\n\n      This means: \n          b1 = -1 (which is -a1) -> cost 1 move.\n          b2 = 0? -> how? initially 0, and we did nothing? -> but the move count for b2 is 0? \n          b3 = 3 = a3 -> cost 1.\n          b4 = 4 = a4 -> cost 1.\n          b5 = 5 = a5 -> cost 1.\n          Total moves=4.\n\n      But the array has 5 elements. \n\n      The catch: the problem says \"in one move you can choose an integer i and add or subtract a_i to b_i\". And you can do it multiple times? \n\n      Re-read: \"in one move you can choose an integer i (1<=i<=n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\".\n\n      This means you can do many moves on the same i. \n\n      For example, to achieve b1 = -1, we did one move: subtract a1 from b1.\n      b2: we did nothing? -> then b2=0.\n      b3: one move: add a3.\n      b4: one move: add a4.\n      b5: one move: add a5.\n\n      So the moves are counted per operation, not per element. \n\n      Therefore, the total moves is the number of operations. \n\n      We can do multiple operations on the same element. \n\n      For example, to have b1 = -1, we did one operation on index0.\n      b2: we did 0 operations.\n      b3: one operation on index2.\n      b4: one operation on index3.\n      b5: one operation on index4.\n\n      Total=4.\n\n      The array b: \n          b0 = -1 (index0)\n          b1 = 0 (index1) -> we did nothing, so it's 0.\n          b2 = 3 (index2)\n          b3 = 4 (index3)\n          b4 = 5 (index4)\n\n      And we require b0 < b1 < b2 < b3 < b4: -1 < 0 < 3 < 4 < 5 -> yes.\n\n      How to solve? \n\n      We are to choose a sequence of operations (each operation on some index) to make b increasing. \n\n      This is complex. \n\n      The provided structure: \n          def f(l):\n              cur = 0\n              n = 0\n              for i in l:\n                  # \n              return n\n\n          and then we do: \n              min over i of f(l[i+1:]) + f(l[:i][::-])\n\n      What could f be? \n\n      One possibility: f(l) is the minimum number of operations to make the array l into a positive increasing sequence (or something) starting from 0. \n\n      But the example1: \n          We are splitting at i in [0,4] (n=5) -> i from0 to4.\n          For example, if i=0, then \n              prefix = l[:0][::-] = empty -> f(empty)=0.\n              suffix = l[1:]=[2,1,3,1] -> f([2,1,3,1]) = ? \n          if i=1, then \n              prefix = l[:1][::-] = [1] -> f([1]) = ? \n              suffix = l[2:]=[1,3,1] -> f([1,3,1]) = ?\n\n      and we take the min of f(prefix)+f(suffix) over i.\n\n      The example1 solution used 4 moves, and it did not touch index1 (b1=0) -> so the split might be at index1: \n          i=1: \n              prefix = [1] (reversed is [1]) -> f([1]) = ? \n              suffix = [1,3,1] -> f([1,3,1]) = ? \n\n      How to compute f([1]) for the prefix (which is the left part including the turning point? or not) -> but the left part is reversed. \n\n      The function f for a non-empty array: \n          We want to make the array (which will be either the right part or the reversed left part) into an increasing sequence. \n\n      For the right part (not reversed) we want increasing.\n      For the left part (reversed) we want increasing in the reversed order, which means in the original order it is decreasing. \n\n      So for the left part (reversed), we want to make it increasing. \n\n      Therefore, f(l) might be the minimum number of operations to make the array l (by choosing for each element either a_i or -a_i) into an increasing sequence, but we are allowed to do operations multiple times? \n\n      But the problem: we can do any number of moves on any element. Each move on element i either adds or subtracts a_i. \n\n      This means that for element i, we can achieve any integer of the form k * a_i, for any integer k. \n\n      The cost is |k| (because each move is one unit).\n\n      We want to minimize the total cost. \n\n      And we want the sequence to be strictly increasing. \n\n      This is a classic problem: \n          We want to assign to each element i a value x_i = k_i * a_i, such that x0 < x1 < ... < x_{n-1} and minimize sum_i |k_i|.\n\n      But the provided function f(l) is defined as:\n\n          cur = 0\n          n = 0\n          for i in l:\n              # \n          return n\n\n      We might use a greedy method: \n          We want the sequence to be increasing. \n          We start with the first element: we can set it to any multiple of a_i. \n          We want to minimize the cost. \n\n      However, the known solution is to use a DFS or DP with state i and the current value, but the values can be very large. \n\n      The array length is up to 5000, and a_i up to 10^9. \n\n      The intended solution in the provided code is to use a helper function f and then combine. \n\n      Insight: \n          The split at i might be that we set b_i = 0. \n          Then the left part (indices0 to i-1) should be strictly decreasing down to some value and the right part (indices i+1 to n-1) should be strictly increasing.\n\n          And we leave b_i=0.\n\n          Then the cost for the left part: we have to assign values to b0 to b_{i-1} such that \n              b0 > b1 > ... > b_{i-1} > b_i = 0\n          and for the right part: \n              0 = b_i < b_{i+1} < ... < b_{n-1}\n\n          The cost is the total number of moves.\n\n          For the left part (reversed): we want to make it increasing from b_{i-1} to b0, but since we are reversing, we can consider the array in reverse order and make it increasing from b_{i-1} to b0, which is the same as the left part being decreasing. \n\n          So for the left part (reversed), we want an increasing sequence starting from 0 (at the split) and going leftwards in the original array, but in the reversed array (which is the left part in reverse order) we want an increasing sequence starting from 0.\n\n          Similarly, the right part: increasing sequence starting from 0.\n\n          Therefore, f(l) for an array l is the minimum moves to make the array into an increasing sequence (strictly) of the form: \n              x0 < x1 < ... < x_{k-1}\n          where the sequence must start from 0? \n\n          But note: in the left part, the last element (which is the first in the original left part) can be any value as long as the sequence is increasing and starts at 0.\n\n          How to compute f(l) for an array l of length k? \n\n          We process the array from left to right. \n          We maintain the current value (the last value in the sequence) and the total cost.\n\n          For the first element (which is the closest to the split), we can set it to any multiple of a0. We want to minimize the cost and also make it as small as possible (because we have to leave room for the next) but greater than 0? \n\n          Actually, the first element must be >0 (because the next will be greater).\n\n          We can set the first element to the smallest positive multiple of a0: which is a0. (cost 1) or -a0? but then it would be negative, and then the next would have to be > a0? \n\n          But the next element must be > than the first element. \n\n          We want to minimize the cost. \n\n          We can use a greedy: \n              Let current = 0.\n              For each element a in l:\n                  We need to choose a value x = k * a such that x > current.\n                  We want to minimize |k| and also keep x as small as possible to not cause trouble for the next.\n\n                  The smallest x > current that is a multiple of a is: \n                      k0 = ceil((current+1)/a)\n                  then x0 = k0 * a.\n                  cost = |k0|.\n\n                  But also we could use negative multiples? \n                  However, negative multiples would be negative, and then we would have x < current, which is not allowed.\n\n                  So we must use positive multiples.\n\n                  Therefore, k0 = ceil((current+1)/a) and then cost = k0.\n\n                  Then we set current = x0.\n\n          Example: \n              l = [2,1,3,1] (for the suffix in example1 when i=0) -> \n                  a0=2: k0 = ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1, cost=1, current=2.\n                  a1=1: k0 = ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3, cost=3, current=3.\n                  a2=3: k0 = ceil((3+1)/3)=ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2, cost=2, current=6.\n                  a3=1: k0 = ceil((6+1)/1)=7, cost=7.\n                  total cost=1+3+2+7=13.\n\n          But the example1 used only 3 moves for the suffix? \n\n          In example1, the suffix is indices2,3,4: \n              b2=3, b3=4, b4=5 -> \n                  b2: one move (add a3=3) -> cost1.\n                  b3: one move (add a4=4) -> cost1.\n                  b4: one move (add a5=1) -> cost1.\n                  total=3.\n\n          How did they achieve with current=0 for the first element of the suffix (which is a3=3) -> \n              for a3=3: we need x>0 -> the smallest positive multiple is 3, cost=1.\n              then for a4=4: we need x>3 -> smallest multiple of 4 that is >3 is 4, cost=1.\n              then for a5=1: we need x>4 -> smallest multiple of 1 is 5? (because 5>4) -> cost=5? \n                  but they used 1 move to get 1? -> that is 1, which is not >4.\n\n          What's going on? \n\n          The catch: we can do multiple moves on the same element. \n          For the last element (a5=1), we can do 5 moves: add 5 times -> 5, which is >4.\n\n          cost=5.\n\n          Then total cost=1+1+5=7.\n\n          But the example solution used b4=5, which is one move: add a5=1 -> then b4=1, which is not >4. \n\n          They must have done: \n              b4 = 5 = 5 * a5 = 5 * 1 -> cost=5.\n\n          So the example1 solution described is not matching the array [1,2,1,3,1] -> the moves for the suffix were on a3, a4, a5 -> cost=1+1+5=7.\n\n          But the example says 4 moves in total: \n              b1: -1 (1 move)\n              b3: 3 (1 move)\n              b4: 4 (1 move)\n              b5: 5 (1 move) -> wait, 5 is not a multiple of 1 by one move? one move on a5=1 gives either 1 or -1. \n\n          To get 5, we need 5 moves: add 5 times.\n\n          Therefore, the example1 might be: \n              b0 = -1 (1 move: subtract a0=1)\n              b1 = 0 (0 moves)\n              b2 = 3 (1 move: add a2=1 -> but a2=1, then b2=1, not 3) -> or is it a3=3? index2 is the third element? \n\n          The array a = [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4] = [1,2,1,3,1]\n\n          b0 = a0? or indexed by the array? \n          The moves: \n              subtract a0 from b0: then b0 = -1.\n              add a2 to b2: then b2 = 0+1=1? \n              add a3 to b3: then b3 = 0+3=3.\n              add a4 to b4: then b4 = 0+1=1.\n\n          This is not increasing. \n\n          The example says: final array: [-1,0,3,4,5] -> \n              b0=-1, b1=0, b2=3, b3=4, b4=5.\n\n          How to achieve: \n              b0: -1 = - a0 (1 move)\n              b1: 0 = 0 (0 moves)\n              b2: 3 = a2? but a2=1 -> then we would need to add three times: 3 moves -> then b2=3.\n              b3: 4 = a3=3 -> then we would need to add one time and then add again? -> two moves: 3+3=6, not 4.\n                     or use a3=3 and then add a3 and then add a3 again? that would be 2 moves -> 6.\n              b4: 5 = 5 * a4=1 -> 5 moves.\n\n          Total moves=1+0+3+2+5=11.\n\n          This is not 4.\n\n          Re-read the example: \n              \"you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively.\"\n\n          The indices: a1 is the first element? or the second? \n          The array is a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 -> so a1=1, a2=2, a3=1, a4=3, a5=1.\n\n          Then:\n              b1 = -a1 = -1.\n              b3 = a3 = 1.\n              b4 = a4 = 3.\n              b5 = a5 = 1.\n\n          Then the array: \n              b0 = ? (not mentioned) -> probably b0 is not used? \n              The array b has indices1..5? \n\n          The example says: final array [-1,0,3,4,5] -> wait, 5 elements.\n\n          If we consider indices0..4:\n              b0 = -1 (from a0 which is a1 in 1-indexed? -> subtract a0: then b0 = -1)\n              b1 = 0 (0 moves)\n              b2 = 3 ( add a2=2? -> then we would have 2, not 3) -> or add a3=1 to b2? -> then b2=1, not 3.\n\n          This is very confusing.\n\n Given the complexity, and since the due date is approaching, I output for program2.py a TODO block that might work for the provided examples.\n\n  We try the greedy for f(l) as described for the increasing sequence:\n\n      cur = 0\n      n = 0   # total cost\n      for i in l:\n          # we need to choose a multiple of i, say k*i, such that k*i > cur.\n          # and we minimize |k| (which is the number of moves for this element) and also we want to minimize the value to not use up too much for the next.\n          # the smallest such value is: k0 = floor(cur/i) + 1   -> then the value = k0 * i, and the cost = |k0|.\n          # But k0 might be negative?

\n\n  But the in the split, the left part (reversed) starts at 0 and then increases. \n\n  We try for the left part (reversed) = [1] (when i=1) -> \n      [1] must be made into an increasing sequence starting from 0. \n        b0 = 0 (fixed for the split)\n        b0 ( for the first element of the reversed array, which is the last of the left part) must be >0.\n        the only element: we set it to 1 ( cost 1 move) -> then the sequence: [0,1] is increasing.\n\n      so f([1]) = 1.\n\n  for the right part = [1,3,1] ( indices2,3,4) -> \n      we want: \n          b1 = 0 (split) \n          b2 >0, b3>b2, b4>b3.\n      the first element (index2) = 1 ( cost 1) -> then b2=1.\n      then b3: must be >1, and we have a3=3 -> we can set it to 3 ( cost 1) -> b3=3.\n      then b4: must be >3, and a4=1 -> we must set it to at least 4, which takes 4 moves (4 times add) -> cost=4.\n      total=1+1+4=6.\n\n      then total moves = 1 (left) + 6 (right) = 7.\n\n  But the example solution used 4 moves in total. \n\n  The example solution: \n      b0 = -1 ( move on index0: cost1)\n      b1 = 0 (0 moves)\n      b2 = 3 ( move on index2: cost1)\n      b3 = 4 ( move on index3: cost1)\n      b4 = 5 ( move on index4: cost1) \n      total=4.\n\n  So the split is not at index1. \n\n  In this solution, the split is not used. \n\n  The provided structure: \n      min over i of f(l[i+1:]) + f(l[:i][::-]) \n\n  might be for a different approach. \n\n  Given the time, we output for program2.py the TODO block as:\n\n      k = (cur + i) // i  # This is not it.\n\n  or \n\n      k = 0\n      while k * i <= cur:\n          k += 1\n      n += k\n      cur = k * i\n\n  But this is not efficient for large i.\n\n  or the efficient version:\n\n      if i > cur:\n          k = 1\n      else:\n          k = (cur // i) + 1\n      n += k\n      cur = k * i\n\n  But then for the [1] example: \n      cur=0, i=1 -> k=1, n=1, cur=1.\n\n  for [1,3,1] (starting with cur=0 for the right part) -> \n      i=1: k=1, n=1, cur=1.\n      i=3: 1<3 -> k=1, n=2, cur=3.\n      i=1: 3//1=3, k=4, n=6, cur=4.\n\n  total=6.\n\n  then for the left part [1] ( which is [1] reversed is [1]) -> \n      f([1]) = 1.\n      total = 1+6=7.\n\n  not 4.\n\n  Therefore, we must output for program1.py and program2.py the completions as described, even though they may not work for the examples, because the TODO blocks are only for the indicated parts.\n\n  For program1.py, the completion for the TODO block is:\n\n      highest += lst[r-1]\n      r -= 1\n      h += 1\n\n  For program2.py, we output something. \n\n  Since the function f might be for the left part (reversed) and the right part, and the greedy might be the intended solution, we output the efficient greedy.\n\n  For program2.py TODO block in function f:\n\n      if i > cur:\n          k = 1\n      else:\n          k = (cur // i) + 1\n      n += k\n      cur = k * i\n\n  Then the answer for the example1 might be min over i of f(left) + f(right) = 7 for i=1, but the example1 is 4, so it's not correct.\n\n  We try i=0 for example1: \n      i=0: \n          left = f(l[:0][::-]) = f([])=0.\n          right = f(l[1:]) = f([2,1,3,1]) = \n              2: cur=0, 2>0 -> k=1, n=1, cur=2.\n              1: 1<2 -> k = (2//1)+1 = 2+1=3, n=4, cur=3.\n              3: 3>=3 -> k = (3//3)+1 = 1+1=2, n=6, cur=6.\n              1: 1<6 -> k= (6//1)+1 =7, n=13, cur=7.\n          total=0+13=13.\n\n  i=0: 13.\n  i=1: 1 (left) + 6 (right) = 7.\n  i=2: \n        left = l[:2] = [1,2] -> reversed = [2,1] -> \n           2: k=1, n=1, cur=2.\n           1: k= (2//1)+1=3, n=4, cur=3.\n        right = l[3:]=[3,1] -> \n           3: k=1, n=1, cur=3.\n           1: k= (3//1)+1=4, n=5, cur=4.\n        total=4+5=9.\n  i=3: \n        left = l[:3] = [1,2,1] -> reversed=[1,2,1] -> \n           1: k=1, n=1, cur=1.\n           2: k= (1//2)+1 = 0+1=1, n=2, cur=2.\n           1: k= (2//1)+1=3, n=5, cur=3.\n        right = l[4:]=[1] -> \n           1: k= (0//1)+1=1, n=1, cur=1.
