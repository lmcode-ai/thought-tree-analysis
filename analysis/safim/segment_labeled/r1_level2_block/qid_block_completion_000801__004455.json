The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py has a while loop that uses two pointers (p1 starting at the left and p2 at the right) and two sums (s1 for Alice and s2 for Bob). The idea is to move the pointers and update the sums until the pointers cross. We record the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 from the left and (n-1-p2) from the right) whenever s1 equals s2.\n\nHowever, the code has a TODO in the condition for when s1 < s2. The current code only handles the case when s1==s2 (then it records the count and moves the left pointer) and when s2 < s1 (then it moves the right pointer). We need to handle the case when s1 < s2.\n\nThe plan is:\n- We start with p1=0, p2=n-1, s1=0, s2=0, and an empty list l2.\n- We traverse while p1-1 <= p2 (which is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1). Actually, the condition in the while loop is written as (p1-1<=p2). Let me check: initially p1=0, then condition is -1<=p2 (which is true). Then we have three conditions.\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop is \"while (p1-1<=p2)\". This condition is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. Since p1 and p2 are indices, we want to continue as long as we haven't crossed.\n\nIn the first condition, if s1==s2, we record the current total candies (p1 from the left and n-1-p2 from the right) and then we add the current left candy to s1 and move p1.\n\nThen we have two other conditions: if s1 < s2, we need to do something? Actually, the current code only has:\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\nand then the next condition is if s2 < s1.\n\nBut note: after the first condition, we have updated s1 and p1. Then we check s1 < s2? and then s2 < s1? However, we must update either the left or the right in each iteration? But the first condition already updated the left. Then we check again? Also, the condition for s1==s2 might break the state.\n\nActually, the problem is that the code after the first condition might not be in the same iteration. We have to consider that after updating the left, we might then have s1 < s2 or s2 < s1? But the code then does two more if conditions? That might be problematic.\n\nAlternatively, the intended logic is to have a loop that in each step either:\n  - if s1 == s2: record the count, then add a candy from the left (so we are trying to extend the left and then we break the balance? but we record the count at the moment of equality)\n  - then if s1 < s2: we add a candy from the left? But wait, we just added from the left in the equality case? \n\nActually, the provided code does:\n    if s1 == s2: \n        l2.append(...)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n    if s1 < s2: ...   # then we need to add from the left? but we just added from the left? \n\nThis might lead to an infinite loop? Also, note that after the first if, we have updated s1 and p1, so then we check the next condition with the updated s1.\n\nAlternatively, the standard solution for this problem (which is known as \"Candies\" from a contest) uses two pointers and:\n\n  while left <= right:\n      if s1 == s2:\n          ans = left + (n - 1 - right)\n          # then we can try to extend by taking from left? \n          s1 += arr[left]\n          left += 1\n      elif s1 < s2:\n          s1 += arr[left]\n          left += 1\n      else:\n          s2 += arr[right]\n          right -= 1\n\nBut note: we want to record every time we have an equality? and then at the end the last recorded equality is the maximum? Actually, we want the maximum total candies at the moment of equality.\n\nHowever, the provided code in the problem does record in l2 every time there is an equality. Then at the end it prints l2[-1] (the last recorded equality). But note: the last recorded equality might not be the maximum? Actually, the total candies eaten is p1 (from the left) and (n-1-p2) from the right. As we move the pointers, the total number of candies is increasing? Actually, we are moving the pointers and the total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) is increasing? But note: when we add a candy from the left, p1 increases and the count of left candies increases, but the count of right candies remains the same? Actually, the total candies eaten is p1 (because Alice ate p1 candies) and Bob ate (n-1-p2) candies? So total = p1 + (n-1-p2). And we record that when s1==s2.\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop: (p1-1<=p2). Initially, p1=0, p2=n-1: condition is -1<=n-1 -> true. Then we check: s1==s2 (0==0) -> we record: p1 + (n-1-p2) = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0. Then we add l[0] to s1 and p1 becomes 1. Then we check: if s1 (which is l[0]) < s2 (0)? That would be false. Then if s2 (0) < s1 (l[0])? Then we add l[p2] (the last candy) to s2 and p2 becomes n-2. Then we continue.\n\nBut the problem: we have a TODO for the case when s1 < s2. What should we do? We should add a candy from the left? Because if s1 is less than s2, we need to increase s1.\n\nSo we should do:\n    if s1 < s2: \n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious because we are in a loop and we have already updated the state in the first condition? Actually, the structure is:\n\n    while (p1-1<=p2):\n        if s1 == s2: \n            ... # record and then update left\n        if s1 < s2: \n            ... # update left\n        if s2 < s1: \n            ... # update right\n\nBut after the first condition, we updated the left and then we check the next condition? So if after updating the left we have s1 < s2, then we update the left again? That would be two left updates in one iteration? That might be acceptable? But note: the condition for s1==s2 might break the balance and then we immediately try to fix it? However, the problem is that we are not guaranteed that the conditions are mutually exclusive? Actually, they are: if we have s1==s2, then after updating the left, we have s1>s2? Not necessarily: because we don't know the next candy. But then we check the next condition? \n\nBut note: the condition for s1==s2 is followed by two other ifs? So if after the update we have s1 < s2, we do the next if. And if we have s2 < s1, we do the last if. But what if we have s1==s2 again? That won't happen because we just updated one side.\n\nBut the problem: we are updating the left in the first condition and then we check the next condition? So we might update twice in one iteration? That would be acceptable? But we must avoid an infinite loop? The pointers are moving: p1 increases or p2 decreases, so eventually the loop ends.\n\nHowever, the condition in the while loop: (p1-1<=p2). When p1 becomes greater than p2+1, we break. \n\nBut what if we update the left twice? Then p1 increases by 2 and we break when p1-1>p2? \n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so we are safe.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\nBut wait: what if p1 is already beyond p2? We have the condition in the while loop: (p1-1<=p2). So when we update p1, we might break the condition? Then we break the loop. So it's safe.\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop is checked at the beginning of each iteration. So if we update p1 and then p1-1 becomes greater than p2, then the next iteration won't run? But we are in the same iteration: we have updated p1 and then we break out of the if conditions and then the loop condition is checked again at the next iteration? Actually, no: after the three if conditions, we go back to the top of the while loop.\n\nSo the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we are safe.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are to find four positive integers a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\nThe provided code already handles:\n  if n%4==0: then we output (m, m, m, m) where m = n//4. Then gcd(m,m)=m and lcm(m,m)=m -> so it works.\n\n  if n%4==2: then we output (2*m-1, 2*m+1, 1, 1). Let's check: \n      a = 2*m-1, b=2*m+1, c=1, d=1.\n      Then a+b+c+d = (2*m-1)+(2*m+1)+1+1 = 4*m+2. But n = 4*m + 2? Actually, m = n//4, so if n=6, then m=1 -> a=1, b=3, c=1, d=1 -> total=6. \n      gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n  if n%4==3: then we output (2, 4*m-2, 2, 1). \n      Let n=7: then m = 7//4 = 1 -> then a=2, b=4*1-2=2, c=2, d=1 -> total=2+2+2+1=7.\n      gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n      But note: the example in the note for n=7: \n          \"In the second test case gcd(2,2)=lcm(2,1)=2, 2+2+2+1=7\"\n      So that matches.\n\n  Now, for n%4==1: \n      We have n = 4*m+1.\n\n      The example: n=5? The note says: \n          \"In the fifth test case gcd(3,5)=lcm(1,1)=1, 3+5+1+1=10\" -> but 10 mod4=2, so that's the n%4==2 case.\n\n      We need an example for n%4==1: n=5,9,13,...\n\n      The note has n=9: \n          \"In the fourth test case gcd(2,4)=lcm(2,1)=2, 2+4+2+1=9\"\n          But 9 mod4=1? Actually, 9 mod4=1 -> so we are in the n%4==1 case? But the example provided for n=9 is in the note and they used a solution that is for n%4==1? \n\n      However, the provided code for n%4==1 is missing.\n\n      We have to output four positive integers.\n\n      Idea: \n        We can try to set a and b such that gcd(a,b)=x, and c and d such that lcm(c,d)=x, and a+b+c+d=n.\n\n      We can try to set x=1. Then we require gcd(a,b)=1 and lcm(c,d)=1. The lcm(c,d)=1 implies that c=d=1. Then we have a+b = n-2. And we require gcd(a,b)=1. We can set a=1 and b=n-3? But then a=1, b=n-3, and then gcd(1, n-3)=1. But we have to have positive integers: so a=1, b=n-3, c=1, d=1. Then total = 1 + (n-3) + 1 + 1 = n. \n        But we require positive: so n-3 must be at least 1 -> n>=4, which is true. But for n=5: then a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> total=5. \n        Check: gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n      However, the example for n=9 in the note used a different solution: [2,4,2,1] -> which has gcd(2,4)=2 and lcm(2,1)=2. But that solution is for n=9 and we are in the n%4==1 case? Actually, 9 mod4=1, so the code for n%4==1 would be used. But the example solution [2,4,2,1] is what the code uses for n%4==3? \n\n      Actually, the note for n=9 says: \n          \"In the fourth test case ... answer is 9\"\n\n      And the provided code for n%4==3 uses: \n          print(2,4*m-2,2,1,end=' ')\n\n      For n=9: m = 9//4 = 2 -> then 4*m-2 = 8-2=6 -> so we would output (2,6,2,1) -> 2+6+2+1=11, which is not 9.\n\n      Actually, the example in the note for n=9 is: 2+4+2+1=9. How do we get that?\n\n      The provided code for n%4==3: \n          n=9: then 9 mod4=1? Actually, 9 mod4=1 -> so we are in the n%4==1 case? \n\n      But the code for n%4==3 is used when n mod4==3. So for n=9, we are in the n%4==1 case.\n\n      Therefore, we must design the n%4==1 case.\n\n      The example in the note for n=9 uses: [2,4,2,1] -> which sums to 9. How can we express that in terms of m? \n          m = n//4 = 9//4 = 2.\n\n      We can try: \n          a = 1, b = n-3, c=1, d=1 -> [1,5,1,1] for n=5? \n          But the note for n=10: \n              \"In the fifth test case gcd(3,5)=lcm(1,1)=1, 3+5+1+1=10\"\n          So for n=10, which is 10 mod4=2, we use the n%4==2 case: \n              m=10//4=2 -> then output (2*2-1, 2*2+1, 1, 1) = (3,5,1,1) -> which matches.\n\n      For n=5: we can output (1,2,1,1) -> which is the solution we described.\n\n      But the note for n=9: they used [2,4,2,1] -> which has gcd(2,4)=2 and lcm(2,1)=2. \n\n      Why did they use that? Because the problem says \"If there are several possible answers you can output any of them\".\n\n      So we can output either [1, n-3, 1, 1] or [2,4,2,1] for n=9? \n\n      However, the problem says: \"It is possible to show that the answer always exists.\"\n\n      But note: the example [2,4,2,1] for n=9: \n          a=2, b=4, c=2, d=1 -> then gcd(2,4)=2, and lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\n      How to generalize? \n        We can set: \n          a = 2, b = 4*m - 4, c = 2, d = 1? \n        Then total = 2 + (4*m-4) + 2 + 1 = 4*m+1 = n? \n        But for n=5: m=1 -> then a=2, b=0 -> not positive.\n\n      Alternatively, we can set: \n          a = 1, b = 4*m - 2, c = 1, d = 1? \n        Then total = 1 + (4*m-2) + 1 + 1 = 4*m+1 = n. \n        Then gcd(1, 4*m-2)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n      But for n=5: m=1 -> then a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> [1,2,1,1] -> which is valid.\n\n      However, the note for n=9: they used [2,4,2,1]. Why? Maybe because they want to avoid having two 1's? But the problem does not require minimal or maximal numbers.\n\n      But note: the example for n=9: [2,4,2,1] has the property that the gcd is 2 (which is greater than 1). \n\n      The problem does not require any particular solution. So we can choose the solution [1, n-3, 1, 1] for n%4==1.\n\n      However, the provided code for other cases uses expressions in terms of m. We can do:\n\n          print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      But note: 4*m-2 = 4*(n//4)-2. For n=5: m=1 -> 4*1-2=2 -> then we output (1,2,1,1) -> total=5 -> works.\n\n      For n=9: m=2 -> 4*2-2=6 -> then we output (1,6,1,1) -> total=9 -> and gcd(1,6)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n      But the note for n=9 used [2,4,2,1] which is different. However, the problem allows any solution.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"In the fourth test case\" they used [2,4,2,1] for n=9. But that test case is in the note and the problem does not require that we output the same as the note. \n\n      But the problem statement says: \"For each test case output 4 positive integers ...\"\n\n      So we can output [1, n-3, 1, 1] for n%4==1.\n\n      However, the provided code for other cases uses expressions that are not the minimal numbers? For example, for n%4==2: we output (2*m-1, 2*m+1, 1, 1) which are two large numbers and two ones.\n\n      So for consistency, we can use the same pattern: two ones and two numbers that are consecutive odd numbers? But for n%4==1, we have n-3 = 4*m+1-3 = 4*m-2. So we can output (1, 4*m-2, 1, 1). \n\n      But note: the problem requires positive integers. 4*m-2 must be positive? \n          Since n>=4, then m>=1. For m=1: 4*1-2=2>0 -> valid.\n\n      Therefore, for n%4==1, we can do:\n          print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      However, wait: the example for n=5: \n          We output: 1, 2, 1, 1 -> which is correct.\n\n      But the example for n=9: \n          We output: 1, 6, 1, 1 -> which is also correct.\n\n      But the note for n=9 used [2,4,2,1] and the problem says \"In the fourth test case\", so we are free to choose.\n\n      However, the problem expects the output to be four positive integers. \n\n      But note: the provided code for other cases uses expressions that might be larger? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the solution from the note for n=9: \n          How to express [2,4,2,1] in terms of m? \n          n=9 -> m=2. \n          We have: \n            a=2, b=4, c=2, d=1.\n          Then: \n            a = 2, b = 2*2, c=2, d=1.\n\n          Then we can set: \n            a = 2, b = 2*m, c=2, d=1 -> total = 2 + 2*m + 2 + 1 = 2*m+5.\n          But n=4*m+1 -> 2*m+5 = 2*m+5, and we require 2*m+5 = 4*m+1 -> 2*m=4 -> m=2 -> only for m=2? \n\n      So that solution is specific to m=2? \n\n      Therefore, the solution [1, 4*m-2, 1, 1] is more general.\n\n      But note: the problem says the total n can be up to 10^9, and we are using m = n//4, so 4*m-2 is at least 2 (for m>=1) and positive.\n\n      Therefore, we can use:\n\n        elif n%4==1:\n            print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      However, wait: the example for n=5: \n          m = 5//4 = 1 -> 4*1-2=2 -> then we output (1,2,1,1) -> which is correct.\n\n      But what about n=13? \n          m=13//4=3 -> then we output (1, 4*3-2=10, 1, 1) -> total=1+10+1+1=13 -> and gcd(1,10)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n      So that's valid.\n\n      However, the provided code for n%4==3 uses: \n          print(2,4*m-2,2,1,end=' ')\n\n      For n=7: m=1 -> 4*1-2=2 -> then (2,2,2,1) -> total=7 -> and gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\n      But note: the example for n=9 in the note is [2,4,2,1] and we are outputting [1,6,1,1] for n=9? \n          The problem does not require a particular solution, so both are acceptable.\n\n      However, the problem note says: \"In the fourth test case\" and then the example. But the test case is n=9. The problem does not require that we output the same as the example.\n\n      Therefore, we can use the solution [1, 4*m-2, 1, 1] for n%4==1.\n\n      But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the missing code for program2.py in the TODO part.\n\n      The TODO is in the n%4==1 branch.\n\n      So the missing code for program2.py is:\n          print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n      However, note the last line of the for loop: \n          print(sep='') \n\n      This is to avoid the space? Actually, the print(..., end=' ') already outputs the four numbers with a space and then a space at the end? Then we do print(sep='') which will print nothing? Actually, that print(sep='') is after the if-elif-else, so it will print a newline? \n\n      But the problem output specification: \"For each test case output 4 positive integers ...\" and then we can output a newline? \n\n      Actually, the provided code for the other cases uses print(..., end=' ') and then a print(sep='') which is equivalent to print()? Because the default end of print() is '\\n'. But note: the print(sep='') will output a newline? \n\n      Actually, the print(sep='') is the same as print()? Because if we don't pass any arguments, then sep doesn't matter. It will output nothing and then a newline? \n\n      But the problem expects the next test case on a new line? \n\n      The current code for the other cases does the same: they output the four numbers with end=' ' (so no newline) and then a print(sep='') which is a newline. \n\n      So we are consistent.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n          print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the output for each test case is four positive integers. We are outputting four numbers: 1, (4*m-2), 1, 1. And then we output a newline via the last print(sep='').\n\nHowever, note: the last print(sep='') is outside the if-elif-else, so it is executed for every test case. \n\nSo the complete code for program2.py for the n%4==1 case is:\n\n    elif n%4==1:\n        print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut note: the variable m is defined as m = n//4.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nFor program1.py: the missing line is:\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\nBut note: the original code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then the next condition. We must replace the TODO line with the code.\n\nBut the original code for program1.py has:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace that with:\n\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\nBut note: the next condition is \"if s2 < s1\", so we must not break the structure.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as two lines? The original code for the condition s1==s2 is written in one line? Actually, the condition s1==s2 is:\n\n        if s1 == s2: l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n\nSo we can write the new condition in one line? Or we can break it? But the problem does not specify the style.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and then the entire missing code for each program.\n\nWe are to output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in a JSON object.\n\nSo:\n\n  program1: \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\nBut note: the original code has a comment at the end of the TODO line. We are replacing the entire line? \n\nThe original line is:\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that line with:\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\nBut the comment is removed? That's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\nBut the original code for the other conditions are in one line? The condition for s2 < s1 is:\n\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\nSo we can do one line? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the problem says \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that should be placed.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the missing part? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".\n\nWe are to output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is one line? But the original has a comment. We are replacing the entire line.\n\nSo we write:\n\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\nBut note: the next condition is \"if s2 < s1\", so we must not break the indentation.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut note: the original code for the other cases uses the same print style.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has an indentation of 8 spaces? Actually, the original code for the other cases has 8 spaces? \n\nIn the provided code for program2.py:\n\n    elif n%4==1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with:\n\n        print(1, 4*m-2, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut the original code for the other cases (like n%4==0) is:\n\n        print(m,m,m,m,end=' ')\n\nSo we are consistent.\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has a print(sep='') after the if-elif-else, so we are not affecting that.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as specified."
