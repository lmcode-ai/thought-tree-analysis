Then swap A1[4] and A4[0] -> A1=[a,a,a,a,a] (step7: 7 operations). Still 7. But note: we can swap from any two arrays. After step2, we have A1=[a,a,c,d,e] and A2=[b,b,c,d,e].

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The code is almost complete. We are missing the condition for Division 3 and the corresponding print statement.\n The condition for Division 3 is: 1400 <= rating <= 1599.\n However, note that the current condition in the code for Division 3 is:\n   elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n But the code inside is missing.\n\n We should complete it by printing \"Division 3\".\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem is about finding the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy of the array where all elements are equal.\n\n Explanation of the provided code:\n   We are reading the test cases. The input is read all at once: [*open(0)].\n   We skip the first two lines (the first line is t, then for each test case we have two lines) and then take every second line starting from index 2 (which are the lines containing the array).\n   We split the current line (a) and then set n to the length of the array.\n   We compute m = max frequency of any element in the array (using Counter).\n   We initialize r (the operation count) to 0.\n\n The while loop condition is: while m < n.\n\n We are to complete the while loop.\n\n Insight:\n We are allowed two operations:\n   1. Clone an array (costs 1 operation).\n   2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) (costs 1 operation per swap).\n\n The goal is to have at least one copy that has all elements equal.\n\n Note: We start with one copy.\n\n How to think:\n   If the array is already all equal (m == n), then we need 0 operations.\n\n   Otherwise, we can do:\n     Operation 1: Clone the array (so we have two copies). Then we can swap elements between the two copies to put as many of the same element as we want in one copy.\n\n   However, note the example: \n        Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> answer is 6 operations? But the note says 6 operations.\n\n   But the problem says: minimal number of operations.\n\n   Alternate Insight (from known solutions to similar problems):\n     We note that we can use the following strategy:\n        - We start with one array. We want to have one array with all elements equal to x (where x is the most frequent element? because we want to minimize operations?).\n\n     Actually, the note says: \n        In the first test case: already equal -> 0.\n        Second test case: 6 operations.\n\n     However, known solutions for similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round 751 (Div. 2), problem B) suggest:\n\n        Let m = max frequency of an element.\n        Then the answer is computed by:\n          operations = 0\n          while m < n:\n             operations += 1   # for cloning\n             # Then we can swap: we can double the number of the target element? \n             # Actually, after cloning, we can swap to get one more of the target element in the original array? \n             # But note: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily between any copies.\n\n        Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              freq = {}\n              max_freq = 0\n              for num in a:\n                  freq[num] = freq.get(num,0) + 1\n                  if freq[num] > max_freq:\n                      max_freq = freq[num]\n\n              operations = 0\n              while max_freq < n:\n                  # We can do a clone operation: then we can swap to put more of the same element in one array.\n                  # Specifically, we can double the number of the target element? \n                  # Actually, we can swap to get at most min(max_freq, n - max_freq) more of the target element? \n                  # But note: after cloning, we have two arrays. We can swap an element that is not the target in the first array with the target element in the second array? \n                  # How many such swaps? We can get at most max_freq (from the clone) to add to the first array? But we can only swap one element per swap.\n\n                  # Actually, the known solution is:\n                  #   operations += 1   # for the clone\n                  #   operations += max_freq   # for swapping? but wait, we can do multiple swaps in one operation? \n                  # But note: the problem says \"swap two elements\" is one operation.\n\n                  # However, the example: \n                  #   Initially: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> max_freq = 2 (for 0 and 3? actually 0 appears twice, 3 appears twice -> m=2, n=6).\n                  #   Step1: clone -> operations=1, now we have two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0].\n                  #   Then we can swap: we want to get one array with all zeros. \n                  #   How? We can swap a non-zero in the first array with a zero in the second array. \n                  #   But note: we can do one swap per operation. How many swaps do we need? \n                  #   To get one array to have 6 zeros, we need 4 more zeros in one array. \n                  #   But we have two zeros in each array. We can swap two zeros from the second array to the first array? \n                  #   Actually, we can only swap two elements at a time (one swap per operation). \n                  #   However, we can do multiple swaps in one operation? The problem says: \"Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions\" is one operation? \n                  #   But note: the problem says \"swap two elements\" (singular) per operation.\n\n                  # Therefore, each swap operation swaps two elements. So to get one more zero in the first array, we need to swap a zero from the second array with a non-zero in the first array. \n                  # But we have two zeros in the second array. We can do two swaps? that would be two operations.\n\n                  # However, the example says 6 operations in total: \n                  #   Step1: clone (1 op)\n                  #   Then they did 5 more operations? \n                  #   Actually, the example breaks down the operations: \n                  #       After clone: 1 op -> two arrays.\n                  #       Then they did one swap: swapping two elements (so one operation) to get the first array to have [0,0,0,3,7,0] (so they swapped two non-zeros? Actually, they swapped two elements: one from the first array and one from the second array?).\n                  #       Then they created a copy of the first array (so another clone: 2nd clone, op count=2) -> now three arrays.\n                  #       Then they swapped two elements in the first two copies (so one swap: op count=3) to get the first array to have [0,0,0,0,0,0] (by swapping the 3 and 7 with zeros from the second array? but the second array now has [3,7,0,3,7,0]?).\n\n                  # Actually, the example says 6 operations. So the operations are:\n                  #   Operation 1: clone\n                  #   Operation 2: swap (one swap) -> then they have two arrays: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] (this doesn't match the example) ... the example then says they create a copy (so operation 3: clone) and then swap (operation 4,5,6: three swaps?).\n\n                  # This is confusing.\n\n   Alternate known solution (from Codeforces submissions for the same problem):\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            freq = {}\n            max_freq = 0\n            for num in arr:\n                freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1\n                if freq[num] > max_freq:\n                    max_freq = freq[num]\n\n            if max_freq == n:\n                print(0)\n                continue\n\n            # We start with one array.

The problem says: \"Swap two elements\" (singular) meaning one swap per operation.\n\n            # Therefore, the process is:\n            #   We start with one array: A0.\n            #   We can clone to get A1.\n            #   Then we can do k swaps: each swap can bring one more occurrence of the target element (say x) from A1 to A0? But we can also swap from A0 to A1? \n            #   Actually, we can swap an element that is not x in A0 with an element that is x in A1. Then A0 gains one x and loses one non-x, and A1 loses one x and gains one non-x.\n\n            #   So after one swap, A0 has one more x. But we can do as many swaps as we have x in A1? (but note: we don't want to remove all x from A1 because we might need to use it again?).\n\n            #   However, we can do multiple clones.

We can clone to get a second array. Then we can swap to get the first array to have f + min(f, n - f) of the element? \n            #   Actually, we can swap up to f times (because the second array has f copies of the element) to get the first array to have f + f = 2f? \n            #   Then we clone the first array (which now has 2f) to get a third array. Then we can swap from the third array to the first array? to get 2f + min(2f, n-2f) = min(4f, n)? \n\n            #   This is similar to doubling.\n\n            #   The number of operations: \n            #       Operation for clone: each clone is one op.\n            #       Operation for swaps: each swap is one op.\n\n            #   But note: we can do multiple swaps after a clone? \n\n            #   However, the problem does not require to break down the swaps and clones arbitrarily.

Then we clone the target array (which now has 4) to get a new clone with 4 zeros. Then we swap 2 of those zeros to the target array to get 6.\n\n        But what if we do not swap all? \n          We could swap only what we need? \n\n        The above algorithm does: \n          Step1: clone and swap 2 -> then we have 4 in the target array.\n          Step2: clone and swap 2 -> then we have 6.\n\n        Total 6.\n\n        Another example: n=5, k=1.\n          current=1, n-current=4 -> swaps_needed = min(1,4)=1.\n          operations=1+1=2, current=2.\n          Then: current=2, n-current=3 -> swaps_needed=min(2,3)=2.\n          operations=2+1+2=5, current=4.\n          Then: current=4, n-current=1 -> swaps_needed=min(4,1)=1.\n          operations=5+1+1=7.\n\n        But is there a better way?\n          We start with [a, b, c, d, e] and we want to get [x,x,x,x,x] (say x=a).\n\n          Operation1: clone -> two arrays: A1=[a,b,c,d,e], A2=[a,b,c,d,e].\n          Operation2: swap A1[1] and A2[0] -> A1=[a,a,c,d,e], A2=[b,b,c,d,e] -> 2 operations, now A1 has two a's.\n          Operation3: clone A1 -> A3=[a,a,c,d,e] -> 3 operations.\n          Operation4: swap A1[2] and A3[0] -> A1=[a,a,a,d,e], A3=[c,a,c,d,e] -> 4 operations.\n          Operation5: swap A1[3] and A3[0] -> A1=[a,a,a,a,e], A3=[c,c,c,d,e] -> 5 operations.\n          Operation6: clone A1 -> A4=[a,a,a,a,e] -> 6 operations.\n          Operation7: swap A1[4] and A4[0] -> A1=[a,a,a,a,a], A4=[e,a,a,a,e] -> 7 operations.\n\n          So 7 operations.\n\n        But the above algorithm does 7.\n\n        However, we can do better? \n          After having A1 with two a's (at step2), we can clone A1 again to get A3=[a,a,c,d,e] (step3: 3 operations).\n          Then swap A1[2] and A3[0] -> A1=[a,a,a,d,e] (step4: 4 operations).\n          Then swap A1[3] and A3[1] -> A1=[a,a,a,a,e] (step5: 5 operations). \n          Then clone A1 to get A4=[a,a,a,a,e] (step6: 6 operations).\n          Then swap A1[4] and A4[0] -> A1=[a,a,a,a,a] (step7: 7 operations).\n\n          Still 7.\n\n        But note: we can swap from any two arrays. After step2, we have A1=[a,a,c,d,e] and A2=[b,b,c,d,e]. \n          Then we can use A2 to provide more a's? but A2 doesn't have any a's? \n\n        Actually, we only have one a in the entire system? initially two (one in A1 and one in A2) but we swapped one from A2 to A1, so A2 lost its a.\n\n        So the above algorithm is correct.\n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5. \n          But if we do a while loop that runs until current>=n, and we double current each time? then the number of iterations is O(log(n)). \n          But in the worst-case, k=1, then we do about O(n) iterations? and n can be 10^5? then 10^5 iterations, and the total n over test cases is 10^5, but the sum of n is 10^5? \n          Actually, the constraint: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\". \n\n          But note: the total n is the length of the arrays. The number of test cases t <= 10000, but the sum of n <= 100000.\n\n          So we can iterate per test case in O(n) or O(n log n) but the doubling in the while loop: the number of iterations for one test case is O(log(n))? \n          However, in the worst-case k=1, then the number of iterations is about O(n) because we add k, then 2k, then 4k, ... until we reach n? \n          But k=1, then we do: \n            iteration1: current=1 -> becomes 1+1=2\n            iteration2: current=2 -> becomes 2+2=4\n            iteration3: current=4 -> becomes 4+4=8\n            ... until we reach n.\n\n          So iterations = O(log(n)), which is about 17 for n=10^5.\n\n        Therefore, we can implement:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              from collections import Counter\n              cnt = Counter(a)\n              m = max(cnt.values()) if cnt else 0\n\n              if m == n:\n                  print(0)\n                  continue\n\n              # Let current = m\n              current = m\n              operations = 0\n              while current < n:\n                  # We need to decide how many swaps we can do in this step: \n                  #   We can swap up to current (because the clone will have current of the target element) and we need n - current more.\n                  swaps_needed = min(current, n - current)\n                  operations += 1   # for the clone\n                  operations += swaps_needed   # for the swaps\n                  current += swaps_needed\n\n              print(operations)\n\n        But wait, the sample test case 1: [1,1,1] -> n=3, m=3 -> skip and print 0 -> correct.\n        Test case 2: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 -> \n            iteration1: current=2, swaps_needed = min(2,4)=2 -> operations=1+2=3, current=4.\n            iteration2: current=4, swaps_needed = min(4,2)=2 -> operations=3+1+2=6, current=6 -> break -> output 6.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, the provided code in program2.py is:\n\n          from collections import*\n          for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n        We must complete the while loop.\n\n        But note: the array a is read as strings. The elements are strings. But the problem says integers, but we are counting frequency of strings? that is okay.\n\n        However, the array a is split into strings. The length n is the length of the array.\n\n        We have: \n          m = max frequency of any string in the array.\n\n        Then we set r=0.\n\n        Then we do while m<n:\n\n        We need to update m and r.\n\n        According to our algorithm:\n\n          In the while loop, we do:\n\n            swaps_needed = min(m, n - m)\n            r += 1 + swaps_needed\n            m += swaps_needed\n\n        But note: we are updating m to be the new frequency in the target array? but actually, we are not storing the entire array, we are just simulating the doubling of the frequency? \n\n        However, the frequency in the target array becomes m + swaps_needed = m + min(m, n-m) = \n            if m <= n-m: then m + m = 2*m\n            else: then m + (n-m) = n.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          while m < n:\n              swaps = min(m, n-m)\n              r += 1 + swaps\n              m += swaps\n\n        Then print(r).\n\n        But note: the example [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> \n            Initially: m=2, n=6.\n            Iteration1: swaps = min(2,4)=2 -> r=0+1+2=3, m=2+2=4.\n            Iteration2: swaps = min(4,2)=2 -> r=3+1+2=6, m=4+2=6 -> break.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, what if the array has multiple elements with the same frequency? we take the max frequency. And we are always increasing the frequency of the same element? \n\n        But note: we are not changing the element we are focusing on. We are always focusing on the element that initially had the max frequency. And we are only swapping to get that element.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n          while m < n:\n              swaps = min(m, n - m)\n              r += 1 + swaps\n              m += swaps\n\n        But note: the problem says the array can have negative numbers? but we are using strings? that is okay.\n\n        However, the array is read as strings, but we are counting frequency of the string representation. This is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the array elements are integers, but the input is given as strings. The Counter counts the string. For example, if the array has 1 and \"1\", they would be different? \n          But the problem says: the array elements are integers. And the input is integers as strings? so we are counting the same integer as the same string? \n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          swaps = min(m, n - m)\n          r += 1 + swaps\n          m += swaps\n\n        But note: we must update m and r in the loop.\n\n        We write:\n\n          while m < n:\n              swaps = min(m, n - m)\n              r += 1 + swaps\n              m += swaps\n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and the while loop runs at most O(log n) per test case, so it is efficient.\n\n        Now, we output the missing code for both programs.\n\n        For program1.py: \n          The missing part is in the condition for Division 3. We have:\n            elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We should print \"Division 3\".\n\n        But note: the condition is written as: \n            elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n\n        We can write:\n            print(\"Division\", 3)\n\n        However, the problem says: output in the format \"Division X\". The existing prints are: \n            print(\"Division\",1)   -> outputs \"Division 1\"\n            print(\"Division\", 2)  -> outputs \"Division 2\"\n            print(\"Division\",4)   -> outputs \"Division 4\"\n\n        So we do the same.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n            print(\"Division\", 3)\n\n        But note: the condition for Division 3 is already written as an 'elif'. We just need to fill the print.\n\n        However, the condition for Division 4 is the 'else'. \n\n        So the completed program1.py for that part is:\n\n            if n >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division\",1)\n            elif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n                print(\"Division\", 2)\n            elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n                print(\"Division\", 3)\n            else:\n                print(\"Division\",4)\n\n        But note: the condition for Division 2 is written as: \"n >= 1600 and n <1900\", but the condition for Division 1 is \"n>=1900\", so the conditions are non-overlapping.\n\n        We are only required to output the missing code.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code is the block for the condition \"n >= 1400 and n < 1600\", which is:\n            print(\"Division\", 3)\n\n        But note: the existing code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then an empty block. We must replace that with the print.\n\n        However, the code is indented. We output the code that would replace the TODO.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, we output the three lines that go inside the while loop.\n\n        But note: the while loop in program2.py is:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must replace the TODO with the three lines? but the TODO is at the end of the line. We can write:\n\n            while m<n:\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the existing code has the while loop with a comment at the end. We are to complete the body.\n\n        We output the body (with proper indentation) for the while loop.\n\n        But note: the existing code has the while loop on one line. We are going to break it into multiple lines.\n\n        The existing line: \n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are going to replace the comment with a new line and then the three lines.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the missing block for the while loop.\n\n        We output:\n\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += 1 + swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        But we must indent it by one level.\n\n        How to represent? We output the three lines with 4 spaces of indentation? or the same as the surrounding? \n\n        The existing code uses 1 space for indentation? \n          n=len(a:=a.split()); ... \n          while m<n: ... \n\n        Actually, the code is written in a compact style. We can do:\n\n          while m<n:swaps = min(m, n - m); r += 1 + swaps; m += swaps\n\n        But that is one line. However, the problem does not specify. But the TODO is in the same line.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We can output the three lines with the same level of indentation as the while loop body.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We output only the missing block.\n\n        Since the while loop body is missing, we output the three lines with the necessary indentation (one level). \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the indentation level. We assume 4 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the three lines without specifying the indentation? but the problem says to output the code that can be inserted.\n\n        We'll output the three lines with 4 spaces of indentation.\n\n        However, the existing code uses 1 space? \n\n        Example: \n          for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n        The body of the for loop is indented by 1 space? Actually, it's one space? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. We can use the same style: one space.\n\n        We output:\n\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += 1 + swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        But we must indent each line by one space? \n\n        Actually, the while loop is already in the body of the for loop (which is indented by one space). Then the body of the while loop should be indented by two spaces? \n\n        However, the existing code for the for loop body is:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n        The while loop body is missing. We are to put three lines inside the while loop.\n\n        We output the three lines, each starting with one more level of indentation. Since the while loop is at the same level as the previous line (which is one space), the body of the while loop should be two spaces.\n\n        But the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces for clarity? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We output the three lines as:\n\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += 1 + swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        and we assume the user will insert them with the same indentation as the while loop body.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Return json\".\n\n        We'll output the missing code as strings in the JSON.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code is one line: \n            \"print(\\\"Division\\\", 3)\"\n\n        But note: the existing code has the condition and then the block. We are only replacing the TODO block.\n\n        Actually, the condition is:\n\n            elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                print(\"Division\", 3)\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is that one line.\n\n        But the existing condition has a colon and then the next line is the TODO. We are replacing the TODO line with the print.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1.py: \n            \"print(\\\"Division\\\", 3)\"\n\n        For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the while loop: three lines.\n\n        We output:\n\n            \"    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += 1 + swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n\n        But the indentation: we use 4 spaces per level. The while loop is at the same level as the for loop body (which is one space). The body of the while loop should be one level deeper. \n\n        However, the existing code for the for loop body uses one space. The while loop is written on a line that is indented by one space. The body of the while loop should be indented by two more spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces for the block.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use one tab? but the problem does not specify.\n\n        Since the problem says the code is for python, and the standard is 4 spaces, we use 4 spaces.\n\n        But note: the existing code uses no spaces for the body? \n\n        Actually, the existing code for the for loop body is written in one line. The while loop is on a new line, and the body is missing. \n\n        We'll output the three lines with 4 spaces of indentation relative to the while loop.\n\n        However, the while loop is already indented (by one space) relative to the for loop. So the body of the while loop should be indented by 5 spaces? \n\n        But that is messy. The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We output the three lines that should be the body of the while loop, and we indent them by one level (which in Python is typically 4 spaces). \n\n        But the existing code uses minimal spaces. We can do:\n\n            while m<n:swaps = min(m, n - m); r += 1 + swaps; m += swaps\n\n        to make it one line? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can output either.\n\n        But the TODO is in the same line as the while. We can output:\n\n            swaps = min(m, n - m); r += 1 + swaps; m += swaps\n\n        as the missing block? but that would be one line.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". We can output the three lines as a block.\n\n        We choose to output the three lines with 4 spaces of indentation.\n\n        Therefore, the JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\", 3)\",\n            \"program2\": \"    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += 1 + swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n          }\n\n        But note: the program2.py code has the while loop condition and then a comment. We are replacing the entire body. The existing code has:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the comment with the three lines. But the condition is already written. We only need the body.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the three lines without the while condition.\n\n        We output the body.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The block for the while loop is missing.\n\n        We output the three lines with 4 spaces of indentation.\n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. The judge will adjust? \n\n        We'll output as described.\n\n        Let me write the code for program2.py after completion:\n\n          from collections import*\n          for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n            print(r)\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
