  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given multiple test cases. The constraints note that the total n*m over test cases <= 10^6, so we can do O(n*m) per test case but we must be efficient.\n\n However, note: the grid has dimensions n and m (up to 1000 each) but the total grid cells over test cases is at most 10^6. So we can iterate over each cell in each test case.\n\n The problem: We start at (0,0) and end at (n-1, m-1). We can only move right or down. We want to know if there is a path such that the sum of the values (which are either 1 or -1) is 0.\n\n Important: The path must have exactly (n+m-1) steps. The sum of the path is the sum of the values along the path.\n\n Since the grid is large (1000x1000) and the sum can be as large as 1000 (if all are 1) or as low as -1000, we cannot use a DP that has state [i][j][sum] because the sum can range from - (n+m-1) to (n+m-1) and that is 2000 states per cell, and total cells 10^6, so 2000 * 10^6 = 2e9 states which is too many.\n\n Instead, we can use a bitset DP. We note that the total absolute sum cannot exceed (n+m-1) in absolute value. We can use a bitmask for each cell (i, j) that represents which sums are achievable.\n\n However, note: the total number of steps is (n+m-1). The maximum absolute value of the sum is (n+m-1). So the range is from -(n+m-1) to (n+m-1). The total distinct sums is 2*(n+m-1)+1. For n, m <= 1000, the maximum n+m-1 is 1999, so the total distinct sums is 3999. We cannot use a bitset of size 4000 for each cell? But note the total grid cells over test cases is 10^6, so 10^6 * 4000 = 4e9 bits = 500 MB which might be borderline in C++ but in Python it might be too heavy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use two arrays (for the current row and the next row) and use a set of achievable sums? But the set might grow to 4000 per row, and we have 1000 rows and 1000 columns -> 1000*1000*4000 = 4e9 which is too heavy.\n\n Another idea: we can use dynamic programming that tracks the minimum and maximum achievable sum at each cell? But note: we are not just interested in the existence of 0, but we need to know if 0 is in the set of achievable sums. However, the set of achievable sums at (i, j) might not be contiguous? Actually, it is contiguous? \n\n Why? Because we start at (0,0) and then we can only add 1 or -1. But note: the moves are arbitrary. Actually, the set of achievable sums at (i, j) is contiguous? \n\n Let's see: \n   We have a grid of 1 and -1. The path from (0,0) to (i,j) has exactly (i+j+1) steps. The sum is the number of 1's minus the number of -1's. Let x = number of 1's, then the number of -1's is (i+j+1 - x). Then the sum = x - (i+j+1 - x) = 2*x - (i+j+1). \n\n Therefore, the sum has the same parity as (i+j+1). And the minimum sum is achieved when we take as few 1's as possible? Actually, the minimum sum is: if we take all the -1's we can, then the sum = (number of 1's) - (number of -1's) = (number of 1's) - ( (i+j+1) - (number of 1's) ) = 2*(number of 1's) - (i+j+1). \n\n But note: the number of 1's can vary. However, the key is that the step between consecutive achievable sums is 2? So the set of achievable sums at (i, j) is every integer between min_sum and max_sum that has the same parity as (i+j+1). \n\n Therefore, we can represent the set by two values: the minimum and maximum achievable sums at (i, j). Then we can check if 0 is between min_sum and max_sum and has the same parity as (i+j+1). But wait: is the set contiguous? \n\n Actually, we can use a greedy argument: we can adjust the path to change the sum by 2? For example, if we have two consecutive steps: right then down vs down then right? But note: the grid is fixed. However, we can use the fact that we can change the path arbitrarily? Actually, the set of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) is such that the sum can be any integer between min_sum and max_sum with step 2? \n\n But note: we are constrained by the grid. However, we can use the following:\n\n   min_dp[i][j] = minimum achievable sum at (i, j)\n   max_dp[i][j] = maximum achievable sum at (i, j)\n\n How to compute?\n   dp[0][0] = A[0][0]\n   Then for (i, j):\n        min_dp[i][j] = A[i][j] + min( min_dp[i-1][j] if i>0 else a big number, min_dp[i][j-1] if j>0 else a big number )\n        max_dp[i][j] = A[i][j] + max( max_dp[i-1][j] if i>0 else a very small number, max_dp[i][j-1] if j>0 else a very small number )\n\n But wait: is that correct? Actually, no. Because the set of achievable sums is not necessarily contiguous? But we just argued that it is contiguous? \n\n However, consider: \n   We have two paths to (i,j): one with sum s1 and one with sum s2. Then we can form any sum between min(s1,s2) and max(s1,s2) that has the same parity? Not exactly: we need to know if we can get every value in between? \n\n Actually, we can use an exchange argument: if we have two paths that differ by a loop, then we can adjust the sum by 2? But note: we are not allowed to form loops. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following known fact: in a grid with 1 and -1, the set of achievable sums from (0,0) to (i,j) is contiguous with step 2? \n\n But let me test with a small grid:\n\n  2x2 grid:\n    a b\n    c d\n\n  Paths: \n    (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1): sum = a + b + d\n    (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1): sum = a + c + d\n\n  The difference between the two paths: (a+b+d) - (a+c+d) = b - c.\n\n  If b and c are both 1, then the difference is 0 -> only one value? \n  If b=1, c=-1, then the difference is 2 -> then we have two values: s and s+2? \n\n  But what if we have more than two paths? \n\n  Actually, we can use the following: \n    The sum at (i,j) is determined by the path. The minimum and maximum sums are achieved by taking the path with the most 1's and the path with the most -1's? \n\n  However, the set of achievable sums is contiguous? \n\n  Actually, we can use a lemma: \n    Let f(i,j) be the set of achievable sums at (i,j). Then f(i,j) is an interval of integers that all have the same parity (namely the parity of i+j+1) and the step between consecutive integers is 2.\n\n  Why? Because we can change the path by swapping two consecutive moves? Specifically, if we have two adjacent cells that form a 2x2 block, we can change the path by going around the block and that changes the sum by the difference of the two cells that are swapped? \n\n  Actually, we can use a known technique: \n    We can use a DP that stores the min and max achievable sums. Then we can check if 0 is between min and max and has the same parity? \n\n  But note: the parity condition: the sum must be congruent to (i+j+1) mod 2? Actually, from the formula: \n        sum = 2*(number of 1's) - (i+j+1) \n    so mod 2: sum \u2261 (i+j+1) mod 2.\n\n  Therefore, 0 is achievable only if (i+j+1) is even? Actually, no: because 0 mod 2 is 0, so we require (i+j+1) mod 2 = 0. \n\n  However, note: the total steps is (n+m-1). So at (n-1, m-1), the total steps is (n+m-1). So we require that (n+m-1) is even? \n\n  But the problem does not require that the total steps is even? It can be odd? Then 0 might not be achievable? \n\n  Example: n=1, m=1: then steps=1, which is odd. Then the sum is the value at (0,0). If that value is 0? But the values are only 1 or -1. So if n+m-1 is odd, then the sum must be odd? So 0 (even) cannot be achieved? \n\n  Therefore, if (n+m-1) is odd, then 0 is even -> not achievable? \n\n  But wait: the problem says: \"print YES if there exists a path ... with sum 0\". So if (n+m-1) is odd, then the sum must be odd? Then 0 (even) is impossible? \n\n  So we can immediately output \"NO\" if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0? \n\n  However, wait: what if the grid has zeros? The problem says the numbers are 1 or -1. So no zeros. \n\n  Therefore, the sum of the path is (number of 1's) - (number of -1's) = (number of 1's) - ( (n+m-1) - (number of 1's) ) = 2*(number of 1's) - (n+m-1). \n\n  Then 0 = 2*(number of 1's) - (n+m-1)  =>  number of 1's = (n+m-1)/2.\n\n  Therefore, (n+m-1) must be even? \n\n  So if (n+m-1) is odd, then we cannot have 0? \n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          continue\n\n  But wait: what if the grid does not have enough 1's? Even if (n+m-1) is even, we need exactly (n+m-1)/2 ones? \n\n  However, we are not forced to have a fixed number of ones? We can choose the path. \n\n  So we require that the minimum achievable sum at (n-1, m-1) is <= 0 and the maximum achievable sum >= 0? \n\n  But note: the set of achievable sums is contiguous? Then we can do:\n\n      if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          min_dp = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]\n          max_dp = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]\n          min_dp[0][0] = max_dp[0][0] = A[0][0]\n          for i in range(n):\n              for j in range(m):\n                  if i==0 and j==0: continue\n                  min_val = 10**18\n                  max_val = -10**18\n                  if i>0:\n                      min_val = min(min_val, min_dp[i-1][j])\n                      max_val = max(max_val, max_dp[i-1][j])\n                  if j>0:\n                      min_val = min(min_val, min_dp[i][j-1])\n                      max_val = max(max_val, max_dp[i][j-1])\n                  min_dp[i][j] = min_val + A[i][j]\n                  max_dp[i][j] = max_val + A[i][j]\n\n          if min_dp[n-1][m-1] <= 0 <= max_dp[n-1][m-1]:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n  But wait: is the set of achievable sums contiguous? We argued that the set is contiguous? \n\n  However, we must be cautious: the above DP for min and max does not rely on the set being contiguous. It just computes the minimum and maximum. But if the set is contiguous, then the condition min_dp <= 0 <= max_dp is sufficient? \n\n  But note: the parity condition: we know that the sum must have the same parity as (i+j+1). At (n-1, m-1): the parity is (n+m-1) mod 2. We already checked that (n+m-1) is even, so 0 is even -> same parity. \n\n  However, what if the set of achievable sums is not contiguous? Then we might have min_dp and max_dp but there might be gaps? \n\n  But we have the lemma: the set of achievable sums at (i,j) is contiguous? \n\n  Actually, we can prove by induction: \n      Base: (0,0): only one value -> contiguous.\n      Step: (i,j) can come from (i-1,j) or (i,j-1). The set at (i-1,j) is contiguous and at (i,j-1) is contiguous. Then the set at (i,j) is the set { x + A[i][j] for x in (set(i-1,j) \u222a set(i,j-1)) }.\n\n      But the union of two contiguous sets? They might not be contiguous? \n\n  However, note: the sets at (i-1,j) and (i,j-1) are both contiguous and they are both sets of integers with the same parity (which is the parity of (i-1+j) and (i+j-1) respectively). Note that (i-1+j) and (i+j-1) are both equal to (i+j-1) mod 2? Actually, (i-1+j) = i+j-1, and (i+j-1) = i+j-1 -> same. And the next step: (i,j) has parity (i+j+1) mod 2? Actually, the parity at (i,j) is (i+j+1) mod 2? \n\n  But wait: at (0,0): i+j+1 = 1 -> odd. Then at (0,1): i+j+1 = 0+1+1 = 2 -> even. \n\n  Actually, the parity condition: the sum at (i,j) must be congruent to (i+j+1) mod 2? \n\n  Alternatively, we can note: \n      The sum at (i,j) = (number of 1's) - (number of -1's) = (number of 1's) - ( (i+j+1) - (number of 1's) ) = 2*(number of 1's) - (i+j+1) -> so mod2: 2*(number of 1's) is 0 mod2, so the sum mod2 = (i+j+1) mod2.\n\n  Therefore, the set at (i,j) is a set of integers that are all congruent to (i+j+1) mod2. \n\n  Now, the sets from (i-1,j) and (i,j-1) are both sets of integers that are congruent to (i+j) mod2? Because at (i-1,j): parity = (i-1+j+1) = i+j mod2, and at (i,j-1): (i+j-1+1)=i+j mod2. \n\n  Then when we add A[i][j] (which is either 1 or -1, so mod2 is 1) we get: \n        new_parity = (i+j) mod2 + 1 mod2 = (i+j+1) mod2.\n\n  Now, the set at (i,j) is the union of two sets (from left and top) each shifted by A[i][j]. Since the two sets are contiguous and they are both sets of integers with the same parity (i+j mod2) and then we add 1 mod2, they become sets of integers with the same parity (i+j+1 mod2). But are the two sets adjacent? \n\n  Actually, the sets from the top and left might not be adjacent? \n\n  Example: \n      Consider:\n        (0,0): 1 -> set = {1} (parity=1 mod2 -> 1 mod2, which is (0+0+1)=1 mod2 -> correct)\n        (0,1): from (0,0) -> 1 + (value at (0,1)) \n               if value at (0,1) is 1: then set = {2} -> parity=0 mod2? (0+1+1=2 mod2=0) -> correct.\n        (1,0): from (0,0) -> 1 + (value at (1,0)) \n               if value at (1,0) is -1: then set = {0} -> parity=0 mod2? (1+0+1=2 mod2=0) -> correct.\n        (1,1): from (0,1) and (1,0): \n               from (0,1): 2 + (value at (1,1)) -> if value is 1: 3; if value is -1: 1.\n               from (1,0): 0 + (value at (1,1)) -> if value is 1: 1; if value is -1: -1.\n               So the set: if the value at (1,1) is 1: {3,1} -> which is {1,3} -> contiguous? \n                     if the value is -1: {1, -1} -> which is not contiguous? \n\n  But wait: the set { -1, 1 } is not contiguous? But we have a gap at 0? \n\n  However, note: the parity at (1,1) is (1+1+1)=3 mod2=1. So the set must be odd. And -1 and 1 are both odd. But the set is not contiguous? \n\n  Therefore, the set is not necessarily contiguous? \n\n  Then our min_dp and max_dp might not be enough? \n\n  But note: the problem constraints: the total grid cells over test cases is 10^6. And the absolute value of the sum is at most (n+m-1) which is at most 2000? So we can do a DP that for each row we keep a bitset? \n\n  We can use a 1D DP for the current row: \n        dp[i][j] = set of achievable sums at (i, j)   -> but we cannot store a set for each j because the set might be large.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a bitset for each row? \n\n  The maximum absolute sum is 2000, so we can use a bitset of size 4001 (from -2000 to 2000). \n\n  Steps:\n      Let offset = 2000.\n      dp[i][j] = a bitset (a boolean array of length 4001) such that dp[i][j][k] is True if the sum k - offset is achievable.\n\n      Then:\n          dp[0][0][A[0][0] + offset] = True.\n\n      Then for each cell (i, j):\n          if i>0: \n              then we can shift the bitset from (i-1,j) by A[i][j] and OR it to the current.\n          if j>0:\n              similarly.\n\n      But the total grid cells is 10^6, and each bitset is 4001 booleans -> 10^6 * 4001 = 4.001e9 booleans -> about 4.001e9 bytes = 4 GB? That is too much.\n\n  We can do it row by row and use two arrays for the current row and the previous row? \n\n      dp_prev = bitset for the previous row (for all j in the row)\n      dp_curr = bitset for the current row.\n\n      For the current row, we traverse j from 0 to m-1:\n          dp_curr[j] = (dp_prev[j] OR dp_curr[j-1]) shifted by A[i][j]\n\n      But note: the shift: \n          If we have a bitset for a cell, then shifting by A[i][j] (which is either 1 or -1) is just shifting the entire bitset by 1 to the right (if 1) or to the left (if -1). \n\n      How to shift a bitset? We can use bit-level parallelism? But in Python we can use a list of booleans? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use a single integer as a bitset? The bitset has 4001 bits -> 4001/64 ~ 63 integers. But we can use Python's int which is arbitrary precision. \n\n      Steps for one row:\n\n          Let's define a class for a bitset? Or we can use:\n\n          dp_prev: a list of bitsets for the previous row (one per column). But we want to avoid storing the entire grid? \n\n          Actually, we only need the previous row and the current row. \n\n          We can do:\n\n            dp_prev = [None] * m   # each element is a bitset (an integer) for the j-th column in the previous row.\n\n          How to initialize:\n\n            dp_prev[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)   # offset=2000\n\n          Then for the next row:\n\n            dp_curr = [0] * m\n            for j in range(m):\n                # from above: if we are at (i, j) and we come from (i-1, j): then we take the bitset from dp_prev[j] and shift by A[i][j]\n                # from left: if j>0, then we take the bitset from dp_curr[j-1] and shift by A[i][j]\n                # then OR them.\n\n                bits = 0\n                if i>0:\n                    # shift the bitset from dp_prev[j] by A[i][j]\n                    if A[i][j] == 1:\n                        bits |= (dp_prev[j] << 1)\n                    else:\n                        bits |= (dp_prev[j] >> 1)\n                if j>0:\n                    if A[i][j] == 1:\n                        bits |= (dp_curr[j-1] << 1)\n                    else:\n                        bits |= (dp_curr[j-1] >> 1)\n\n                dp_curr[j] = bits\n\n          Then set dp_prev = dp_curr for the next row.\n\n      But note: the grid might be large: m up to 1000, and we are storing 1000 integers per row? And the total rows is n (up to 1000) -> 1000*1000 = 1e6 integers? Each integer is 64 bits? Then 1e6 * 64 bits = 8e6 bytes? That is 8 MB? \n\n      However, the bitset for one cell is an integer that has 4001 bits? Actually, we are storing one integer per cell. The integer has about 4001 bits? Then the total memory: 10^6 * (4001/8) bytes? -> 10^6 * 500 = 500e6 bytes = 500 MB? \n\n      But note: we are storing one row at a time? We only store two rows: dp_prev and dp_curr, each of length m. So total memory: 2 * m * (size of one bitset in bytes). \n\n      How many bytes per bitset? We need 4001 bits -> 4001/8 = 500.125 -> 501 bytes? But we are storing as an integer. The integer for 4001 bits is stored in 63 machine words (64 bits each) -> 63*8 = 504 bytes? \n\n      Then total memory: 2 * 1000 * 504 = 1,008,000 bytes = about 1 MB? \n\n      But wait: the total grid cells over test cases is 10^6, so the maximum n*m over test cases is 10^6. So the maximum n or m might be 1000, but the total test cases: the sum of n*m <= 10^6. So we might have 10 test cases each with n=100, m=100 -> 10000 per test case -> 10*10000 = 100000. \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6\". \n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          total_cells = 0\n          for each test case:\n              n, m = ...\n              total_cells += n * m\n\n          and total_cells <= 10^6.\n\n      So we can iterate over each cell and do the bitset operations. \n\n      Steps:\n\n          offset = (n+m)   # but note: the maximum absolute sum is at most (n+m-1) -> we can set offset = (n+m) to be safe? But n and m vary per test case. \n\n          However, the problem: n and m per test case can be up to 1000, so the maximum absolute sum is 2000. We can set offset = 2000 for all test cases? \n\n          But note: the total steps in a test case is (n+m-1) <= 2000, so the absolute value of the sum is at most 2000. So we can set offset = 2000.\n\n          Then the bitset for a cell will have indices from 0 to 4000 (if we use 0-indexed for the bitset, then the bit at position k represents the sum k - 2000).\n\n          We need to check at the end: if the bitset at (n-1, m-1) has the bit at position (0+2000) set.\n\n      However, note: we must also check the parity condition? Actually, we don't need to because the bitset naturally only sets bits that have the correct parity? \n\n      But wait: we start at (0,0): the sum is A[0][0] -> which is either 1 or -1 -> then the bit at 1+2000 or -1+2000 is set. Then we shift by the next value (which is 1 or -1) so the parity alternates. \n\n      And at the end, we only check the bit at 2000? \n\n      But note: the total steps is (n+m-1). The parity of the sum must be (n+m-1) mod2. And 0 has parity 0. So we require (n+m-1) mod2 == 0. \n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0:\n              print(\"NO\")\n          else:\n              # do the DP with bitset\n\n      However, what if (n+m-1) is even but the bitset at the end does not have the bit 2000? Then \"NO\".\n\n      Implementation:\n\n          We'll use a list for the current row: dp_curr of length m, each element is an integer (the bitset) for that cell.\n\n          We also need to know the grid.\n\n          Steps for one test case:\n\n            if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                continue\n\n            offset = 2000   # because max absolute sum is 2000, so we need 4001 bits.\n\n            # Initialize for the first row:\n            dp_prev = [0] * m\n            # first cell: (0,0)\n            dp_prev[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)\n\n            # But note: if the first value is -1, then we do 1 << (2000-1) = 1<<1999 -> which is a very big integer?

Then we start i from 0? \n\n          Actually, we should start i from 0 to n-1? \n\n          For i=0: \n              we want to compute the first row? \n              for j from 0 to m-1:\n                  if j==0: skip (because we set dp_prev[0] already) \n                  else: \n                      only from left: because i==0, so no above.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            dp_prev = [0] * m\n            dp_prev[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)\n\n            for i in range(0, n):   # we start at row0? \n                dp_curr = [0] * m\n                for j in range(m):\n                    if i==0 and j==0: \n                        # we already set dp_prev[0] so we skip? \n                        # but we are in the first row, so we are going to set dp_curr[0]? \n                        # Actually, we are not using dp_curr for the first row? \n                        # We are using dp_prev for the first row? \n                        # Then we don't need to do anything for (0,0) in the loop? \n                        # But we must set dp_curr[0] from above? \n                        # Actually, for (0,0) we have already set in dp_prev[0]. \n                        # Then for the first row, we start j from 1? \n                        # But the loop j from 0 to m-1: we skip (0,0) -> then for j=0 in the first row: we skip? \n                        # But then we don't set dp_curr[0]? \n                        # We should set dp_curr[0] = from_above? \n                        # But i=0: no above, and j=0: no left -> so we set to 0? \n                        # But we want (0,0) to be set? \n                        # So we break the loop for (0,0) and then for the rest? \n\n                We can avoid the inner loop for (0,0) by starting j from 0 and then:\n\n                  if i==0 and j==0: \n                      dp_curr[0] = dp_prev[0]   # but then we are going to shift? \n                  else: \n                      ... \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp_prev = [0] * m\n            dp_prev[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)\n\n            for i in range(0, n):\n                dp_curr = [0] * m\n                for j in range(m):\n                    if i==0 and j==0:\n                        # we already set dp_prev[0] for the first row? \n                        # But we are in the first row, so we are going to set dp_curr? \n                        # Actually, we are not using dp_curr for the first row? \n                        # We are using dp_prev for the first row? \n                        # Then we don't need to do anything? \n                        # But we want to set dp_curr[0] for the first row? \n                        # Actually, we are going to use dp_prev for the first row? \n                        # Then we don't need to set dp_curr for the first row? \n                        # But then when i=0, we are going to set dp_prev = dp_curr at the end? \n                        # Then we lose the first row? \n\n          Let me restructure:\n\n            We'll do:\n\n              dp = [0] * m   # for the current row we are computing\n              # We'll iterate i from 0 to n-1, and j from 0 to m-1.\n\n              # For row0: \n              #   we set dp[0] = 1 << (A[0][0]+offset) for j=0, and then for j>=1: from left.\n\n              # We don't need the previous row? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp = [0] * m\n            # for the first row: \n            dp[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)\n            for j in range(1, m):\n                if A[0][j] == 1:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j-1] << 1\n                else:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j-1] >> 1\n\n            # then for i from 1 to n-1:\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                new_dp = [0] * m\n                # for the first element in the row: only from above\n                if A[i][0] == 1:\n                    new_dp[0] = dp[0] << 1\n                else:\n                    new_dp[0] = dp[0] >> 1\n\n                for j in range(1, m):\n                    from_above = dp[j]   # from the same column in the previous row\n                    from_left = new_dp[j-1]   # from the left in the same row\n                    if A[i][j] == 1:\n                        from_above <<= 1\n                        from_left <<= 1\n                    else:\n                        from_above >>= 1\n                        from_left >>= 1\n                    new_dp[j] = from_above | from_left\n                dp = new_dp\n\n            # then check dp[m-1] has the bit at offset?\n\n          This is better.\n\n      However, note: the total grid cells is 10^6, and we are doing one pass per cell. The bitset operations (shift and OR) on integers of 4001 bits: these operations are O(1) in the number of bits? Actually, they are O(bits) but the bits are fixed (4001) so it's constant per cell. \n\n      Therefore, total time: O(n*m) per test case, and total over test cases: 10^6 * constant -> acceptable.\n\n      But note: the constant factor: 4001 bits -> 63 machine words? Then shifting and OR are O(63) per cell -> 10^6 * 63 = 63e6 operations -> acceptable in Pyton? \n\n      However, we are in Python and 63e6 might be borderline? But the total grid cells over test cases is 10^6, so 10^6 * 63 = 63e6 operations -> which is acceptable in Pyton in PyPy or in C++ but in Python we might need to be careful.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a list of booleans? But that would be 4001 operations per cell -> 10^6 * 4001 = 4e9 -> too slow.\n\n      So we stick with the integer bitset.\n\n      But note: the shifting: \n          When we shift left by 1, we might shift beyond the 4001 bits? We should mask to the range? \n\n      However, we know the sum is bounded: we only care about sums in the range [-2000,2000]. So we can mask the bitset to the range [0,4000] (which is offset 2000). \n\n      How to mask? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            mask = (1 << (offset*2+1)) - 1   # but offset=2000 -> 4001 bits? \n\n          Then after shifting, we do:\n\n            from_above = (dp[j] << 1) & mask   # for A[i][j]==1\n            from_above = (dp[j] >> 1)           # for A[i][j]==-1: shifting right doesn't introduce new bits? \n\n          But when we shift left, we might set a bit at 4001? Then we want to mask out bits beyond 4000? \n\n          We can set:\n\n            mask = (1 << (4001)) - 1   # bits 0 to 4000 -> 4001 bits.\n\n          Then:\n\n            if A[i][j] == 1:\n                from_above = (dp[j] << 1) & mask\n            else:\n                from_above = dp[j] >> 1   # no need to mask? because shifting right doesn't set bits beyond the left? \n\n          But note: when we shift right, we lose the last bit? That's fine.\n\n          However, we might lose the bit at the boundary? \n\n          Example: if we have a sum of 2000 and we add 1, then we get 2001 -> which is beyond 2000? Then we should not allow it? \n\n          But wait: the maximum sum we can have at any cell is (i+j+1) (if all ones) and the minimum is -(i+j+1). \n\n          At cell (i,j): the maximum sum is (i+j+1) and the minimum is -(i+j+1). \n\n          And i+j+1 <= n+m-1 <= 2000. So the sum is always in [-2000,2000]. \n\n          Therefore, we don't need to mask? Because if we shift left and the bit at 4000 (which is 2000) is set, then shifting left would set a bit at 4001? But that represents 2001, which is beyond the maximum? So we should mask it out? \n\n          We can mask after every shift? \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid by noting that if the sum is already 2000 and we add 1, then we get 2001 -> which is not representable? So we should mask.\n\n          We'll create a mask:\n\n            mask = (1 << (4001)) - 1   # 4001 bits: from 0 to 4000.\n\n          Then:\n\n            if A[i][j] == 1:\n                from_above = (dp[j] << 1) & mask\n            else:\n                from_above = dp[j] >> 1   # no mask needed? because the negative sums: if we have a sum of -2000 and we add -1, we get -2001 -> which is below -2000? \n\n          Similarly, for the left.\n\n          But note: the minimum sum is - (i+j+1) >= - (n+m-1) >= -2000. So we never go below -2000? \n\n          Therefore, we only need to mask the left shift? \n\n          Actually, when we shift left, we might set a bit beyond 4000? \n\n          Example: if we have a bit at 4000 (which is 2000) and we shift left: then we set bit 4001 -> which is beyond our range. Then we mask it out.\n\n          For the right shift: we never set a bit below 0? So we don't need to mask? \n\n          But note: if we have a bit at 0 (which is -2000) and we shift right: we get 0>>1 = 0? Then the bit at 0 becomes 0? Actually, we lose the bit? \n\n          How does shifting work? \n\n            We have a bit at position k: \n                if we shift left: k becomes k+1 -> and if k+1>4000, we mask it out.\n                if we shift right: k becomes k-1 -> and if k-1<0, then we lose the bit? \n\n          But note: the bit at 0 (which is the lowest) when shifted right: we get k-1 = -1 -> which is not in the bitset? So we lose it. \n\n          That is correct: if we have a sum of -2000 and we add -1, we get -2001 -> which is below the minimum? Then we should not have that path? \n\n          Therefore, we only mask the left shift? \n\n          However, we can mask both for safety? \n\n          But note: shifting right: if we have a bit at 0, then shifting right gives 0, which is not the same as having no bit? \n\n          Actually, we want to represent the sum -2000: then we have a bit at 0. Then if we add -1, we get -2001 -> which is not representable -> so we should not have that path. \n\n          How do we represent that? \n\n          We do:\n\n            if A[i][j] == -1:\n                from_above = dp[j] >> 1   # if the bit at 0 is set, then after shifting right we get 0? But 0>>1 = 0 -> that would be the same as having no bit? \n\n          Actually, no: \n\n            dp[j] is an integer that has bits set. \n\n            Example: dp[j] = 1 (which is the bit at 0) -> then dp[j]>>1 = 0. \n\n          So we lose the bit? \n\n          That is correct: because we cannot have a sum of -2001. \n\n          Therefore, we don't need to mask the right shift? \n\n      So we do:\n\n          mask = (1 << (4001)) - 1   # bits 0 to 4000\n\n          for i in range(0, n):\n              for j in range(0, m):\n                  if i==0 and j==0:\n                      # we set the first cell\n                      dp[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)   # offset=2000\n                  else:\n                      from_above = 0\n                      from_left = 0\n                      if i>0:\n                          if A[i][j] == 1:\n                              from_above = (dp[j] << 1) & mask\n                          else:\n                              from_above = dp[j] >> 1\n                      if j>0:\n                          if A[i][j] == 1:\n                              from_left = (dp[j-1] << 1) & mask\n                          else:\n                              from_left = dp[j-1] >> 1\n                      dp[j] = from_above | from_left\n\n          But wait: we are using a 1D array for the current row? \n\n          Actually, we are using:\n\n            dp: for the current row? \n\n          How to do for the first row? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            dp = [0] * m\n            # first row: i=0\n            for j in range(0, m):\n                if j==0:\n                    dp[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)\n                else:\n                    if A[0][j] == 1:\n                        dp[j] = (dp[j-1] << 1) & mask\n                    else:\n                        dp[j] = dp[j-1] >> 1\n\n            # then for i from 1 to n-1:\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                new_dp = [0] * m\n                for j in range(0, m):\n                    from_above = 0\n                    from_left = 0\n                    if i>0:\n                        if A[i][j] == 1:\n                            from_above = (dp[j] << 1) & mask\n                        else:\n                            from_above = dp[j] >> 1\n                    if j>0:\n                        if A[i][j] == 1:\n                            from_left = (new_dp[j-1] << 1) & mask\n                        else:\n                            from_left = new_dp[j-1] >> 1\n                    new_dp[j] = from_above | from_left\n                dp = new_dp\n\n          Then at the end, check dp[m-1] has the bit at offset (which is 2000) set.\n\n      However, note: the first row: we did not use the mask for the left shift? \n\n          We should use the mask for the first row as well? \n\n          But the first row: the maximum sum we can get is at most j+1 (if all ones) -> which is at most 1000, so we won't exceed 2000? \n\n          But we are shifting: if we have a long row? m=1000, then the maximum sum is 1000, which is 1000+2000=3000? -> then we set bit at 3000? \n\n          But our mask is 4001 bits (0 to 4000) -> 3000 is within. \n\n          However, if we have a row of 2000 ones? Then the last cell would be 2000? Then we set bit at 2000+2000=4000 -> which is within. \n\n          But if we have 2001 ones? Then we set bit at 4002? Then we mask it? \n\n          But note: the problem says n, m>=1 and the total grid cells <= 10^6, and the maximum n or m is 1000, so the maximum ones in a row is 1000 -> 1000+2000=3000 -> within 4000.\n\n          Similarly, the minimum sum in the first row: if we have 1000 ones? Then the sum is 1000? Then we shift left 1000 times? \n\n          Actually, we start at 0: then we add the first element: then we shift? \n\n          Actually, we start at (0,0): set to A[0][0] + offset. Then for the next cell: we shift by A[0][1]? \n\n          Example: \n              A[0][0] = 1 -> bit at 2001? \n              Then next: if 1: then shift left: 2001 -> 2002? \n\n          Actually, we are representing the sum as (bit index) - offset. \n\n          So the first cell: A[0][0] = 1 -> we set bit at 2000+1 = 2001? \n\n          But wait: offset=2000, so the bit at 2000 represents 0? \n\n          Actually, we want: \n              bit at k: represents the sum = k - offset.\n\n          So for the first cell: \n              sum = A[0][0] = 1 -> we set bit at 1+2000 = 2001.\n\n          Then for the next cell: if A[0][1]=1, then we shift left by 1: the bit at 2001 becomes 2002 -> which represents 2002-2000=2 -> which is 1+1=2 -> correct.\n\n          But if we start at (0,0) with -1: then we set bit at 2000-1=1999 -> which represents -1.\n\n          Then for the next cell: if -1: we shift right: 1999 becomes 1998 -> which represents -2.\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          However, we set the first cell as:\n\n              dp[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)   -> if A[0][0]=1: 1<<2001 -> that's a very big shift? \n\n          But note: 2001 is the bit index. We are using an integer that has 4001 bits, so we need to shift 1 by 2001 positions. \n\n          We can do: \n\n              base = 1\n              shift = A[0][0] + offset   # which is 1+2000=2001\n              dp[0] = base << shift\n\n          But 1<<2001 is a number with 2002 bits? That is acceptable in Python? \n\n          Yes, because 2001 is not too big.\n\n      Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n      But note: the total grid cells is 10^6, and we are doing 10^6 shifts? Each shift by 1? \n\n          Actually, we are doing:\n\n            for each cell: we do two shifts (if we are in the middle) and an OR? \n\n          The shift by 1 is a constant time operation? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, but shifting by 1 is O(1)? Actually, it's O(bits) and the bits are 4001 -> constant.\n\n      Let's code accordingly.\n\n      Steps for one test case:\n\n          t = nextInt()\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = nextInt()\n              m = nextInt()\n              A = []\n              for i in range(n):\n                  A.append(getIntArray(m))\n\n              if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  continue\n\n              offset = 2000\n              mask = (1 << (4001)) - 1   # bits 0 to 4000: 4001 bits\n\n              # If the grid is 1x1: then we have to check if A[0][0] is 0? but it's 1 or -1 -> then if (n+m-1)=1 (odd) -> we skip? \n              # So we only get here if (n+m-1) is even.\n\n              # We'll do a 1D DP for the current row.\n\n              # First row:\n              dp = [0] * m\n              # first cell:\n              dp[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)\n\n              # If we have only one cell: then we break and check.\n\n              for j in range(1, m):\n                  if A[0][j] == 1:\n                      dp[j] = (dp[j-1] << 1) & mask\n                  else:\n                      dp[j] = dp[j-1] >> 1\n\n              # For the rest of the rows:\n              for i in range(1, n):\n                  new_dp = [0] * m\n                  # first column in the row:\n                  if A[i][0] == 1:\n                      new_dp[0] = (dp[0] << 1) & mask\n                  else:\n                      new_dp[0] = dp[0] >> 1\n\n                  for j in range(1, m):\n                      from_above = 0\n                      from_left = 0\n                      if A[i][j] == 1:\n                          from_above = (dp[j] << 1) & mask\n                          from_left = (new_dp[j-1] << 1) & mask\n                      else:\n                          from_above = dp[j] >> 1\n                          from_left = new_dp[j-1] >> 1\n                      new_dp[j] = from_above | from_left\n                  dp = new_dp\n\n              # Check the last cell: \n              if dp[m-1] & (1 << offset):   # we want the sum 0 -> represented by offset (which is 2000)\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n      But note: the representation: \n          We set the first cell: A[0][0] -> we set the bit at (A[0][0] + offset). \n          Then we shift: \n            For a 1: we shift left -> which increases the sum by 1? \n            For a -1: we shift right -> which decreases the sum by 1? \n\n          Then at the end, we check the bit at offset (2000) which represents 0.\n\n      However, let's test with a small grid:\n\n          Example: n=1, m=2: \n            A = [[1, -1]]\n\n          Steps:\n            (n+m-1)=2 -> even -> we do the DP.\n\n            First row: \n                j=0: dp[0] = 1 << (1+2000) = 1<<2001.\n                j=1: A[0][1] = -1 -> dp[1] = dp[0] >> 1 = 1<<2000.\n\n            Then we check: dp[1] has the bit at 2000? -> yes.\n\n          So it prints \"YES\".\n\n          But the path: [1, -1] -> sum=0 -> correct.\n\n          Example: n=2, m=1: \n            A = [[1], [-1]]\n\n            Steps:\n                First row: \n                  j=0: dp[0]=1<<2001.\n\n                Then next row: \n                  i=1: \n                    new_dp[0] = (dp[0] << 1) & mask? -> no, because A[1][0] = -1 -> so new_dp[0] = dp[0] >> 1 = 1<<2000.\n\n                Then check: new_dp[0] has bit at 2000 -> YES.\n\n          Example: n=1, m=1: \n            (n+m-1)=1 -> odd -> skip -> \"NO\".

But the total grid cells is 10^6, so the maximum t is 10? because 10 * 1000*100 = 10^6. \n\n      Actually, the total grid cells is the sum of n_i * m_i over test cases <= 10^6.\n\n      So we can do.\n\n      However, we can optimize by not using the entire 4001 bits if the current row and column index is small? But we don't.\n\n      We'll code accordingly.\n\n      But note: the grid might be given as a list of lists. \n\n      We'll read the input.\n\n      However, the input tokens are already read? \n\n      The provided code:\n\n          tokens = ''.join(sys.stdin.readlines()).split()[::-1]\n\n      Then we have nextInt(), etc.\n\n      We'll use:\n\n          t = nextInt()\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = nextInt()\n              m = nextInt()\n              A = []\n              for i in range(n):\n                  row = []\n                  for j in range(m):\n                      row.append(nextInt())\n                  A.append(row)\n\n      Then do the DP.\n\n      But note: the grid might be 1000x1000, but the total grid cells is 10^6, so we are safe.\n\n      Let's code accordingly.\n\n      However, note: the problem says the total grid cells over test cases <= 10^6, so we can have at most 10 test cases of 1000x100? \n\n      We'll code the DP as above.\n\n      But note: the grid might be 1x1, 1x2, etc.\n\n      We'll test with the examples.\n\n      One more: the example in the note: \n          \"Note: the fourth test case\" -> but we don't have the example? \n\n      But the problem says: \n          \"NoteTest case 1: ... \" and \"Test case 2: ...\" for a different problem.\n\n      We'll trust the logic.\n\n      However, the problem says: \n          \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6\"\n\n      So we are safe.\n\n      Code:\n\n          t = nextInt()\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = nextInt()\n              m = nextInt()\n              A = []\n              for i in range(n):\n                  A.append(getIntArray(m))\n\n              if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n                  continue\n\n              # We'll do the DP with bitset.\n\n              offset = 2000\n              total_bits = 4001\n              mask = (1 << total_bits) - 1\n\n              # If the grid has only one cell: then we check if A[0][0] is 0? but it's 1 or -1 -> then we skip because (n+m-1)=1 is odd -> so we don't get here.\n\n              # We'll create a 1D dp array for the current row.\n              dp = [0] * m\n\n              # first cell:\n              dp[0] = 1 << (A[0][0] + offset)\n\n              # If we have only one row:\n              for j in range(1, m):\n                  if A[0][j] == 1:\n                      dp[j] = (dp[j-1] << 1) & mask\n                  else:\n                      dp[j] = dp[j-1] >> 1\n\n              # If we have more than one row:\n              for i in range(1, n):\n                  new_dp = [0] * m\n                  # first column:\n                  if A[i][0] == 1:\n                      new_dp[0] = (dp[0] << 1) & mask\n                  else:\n                      new_dp[0] = dp[0] >> 1\n\n                  for j in range(1, m):\n                      if A[i][j] == 1:\n                          from_above = (dp[j] << 1) & mask\n                          from_left = (new_dp[j-1] << 1) & mask\n                      else:\n                          from_above = dp[j] >> 1\n                          from_left = new_dp[j-1] >> 1\n                      new_dp[j] = from_above | from_left\n                  dp = new_dp\n\n              # Check the last cell: \n              if dp[m-1] & (1 << offset):\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n      But note: the representation: \n          We are checking the bit at offset (2000) which represents 0.\n\n      However, we set the first cell: \n          We set the bit at (A[0][0] + offset). \n          Then we shift: \n            For a 1: we shift left (which increases the sum by 1) -> so the bit moves to a higher index (which represents a higher sum).\n            For a -1: we shift right (which decreases the sum by 1) -> so the bit moves to a lower index.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      We'll run the example: \n          n=1, m=2: [1, -1] -> \n            dp[0] = 1<<(1+2000) = 1<<2001\n            j=1: A[0][1]=-1 -> dp[1] = dp[0]>>1 = 1<<2000 -> then we check: dp[1] has bit at 2000? -> yes.\n\n      So it works.\n\n      However, note: the grid might be large? We are using a list of m integers per row, and we do n rows. The total grid cells is n*m, which is <= 10^6 per test case? But the total over test cases is 10^6.\n\n      We are iterating over each cell once. The operations per cell: a few shifts and ORs and conditionals. \n\n      We'll hope that the constant factor is acceptable.\n\n      But note: the shifting and OR on integers of 4001 bits: in Python, these operations are O(1) in the sense that 4001 is constant? \n\n      Actually, the time per cell is O(1) because the bitset size is fixed. \n\n      Therefore, total time: O(n*m) per test case, and total over test cases: 10^6.\n\n      We'll run.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the shifting and OR on integers of 4001 bits: the time is proportional to the number of bits? Then 10^6 * 4001 = 4e9 operations? That is too slow in Python.\n\n      We need to use the integer in a way that the shift and OR are done in constant time? \n\n      But in Python, integers are implemented with multiple limbs, and shifting by 1 is O(bits). So the total time would be O(n*m * bits) = 10^6 * 4001 = 4e9 -> which is too slow in Python.\n\n      We need a better way.\n\n      Alternative: we can use a boolean array for the current row? But then we do:\n\n          dp[j] = array of booleans of length 4001.\n\n          Then for each cell, we do:\n\n             new_dp[j] = (shift the array from above and from left) and then OR.\n\n          The shift: we can do by reindexing? \n\n          Then the time per cell is O(4001) -> 10^6 * 4001 = 4e9 -> too slow.\n\n      We need a faster way.\n\n      Insight: we only care about the set of sums that are achievable. But the set of sums is contiguous? We argued that it is not necessarily contiguous? \n\n      But note: the known fact: the set of achievable sums at (i,j) is every integer between min_dp[i][j] and max_dp[i][j] that has the parity (i+j+1) mod2? \n\n      And we know that the parity condition is satisfied for 0 only if (n+m-1) is even? \n\n      Then we can do:\n\n          if (n+m-1) % 2 != 0:\n              print(\"NO\")\n          else:\n              min_dp = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]\n              max_dp = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]\n              min_dp[0][0] = max_dp[0][0] = A[0][0]\n              for i in range(n):\n                  for j in range(m):\n                      if i==0 and j==0: continue\n                      min_val = 10**18\n                      max_val = -10**18\n                      if i>0:\n                          min_val = min(min_val, min_dp[i-1][j])\n                          max_val = max(max_val, max_dp[i-1][j])\n                      if j>0:\n                          min_val = min(min_val, min_dp[i][j-1])\n                          max_val = max(max_val, max_dp[i][j-1])\n                      min_dp[i][j] = min_val + A[i][j]\n                      max_dp[i][j] = max_val + A[i][j]\n\n              if min_dp[n-1][m-1] <= 0 <= max_dp[n-1][m-1]:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n      But we argued that the set is not contiguous? \n\n      However, the known fact in such grids: the set of achievable sums is contiguous? \n\n      Actually, we can prove by induction: \n          Base: (0,0): {A[0][0]} -> contiguous.\n          Step: \n             Let S(i,j) = { x+A[i][j] : x in S(i-1,j) \u222a S(i,j-1) }.\n             By induction, S(i-1,j) and S(i,j-1) are contiguous sets of integers with the same parity (which is (i+j-1) mod2). \n             Then S(i,j) is the union of two contiguous sets shifted by A[i][j] (which is either 1 or -1). \n\n          But note: the two sets are shifted by the same amount, so they are still contiguous? \n\n          However, they might not be adjacent? \n\n          Example: \n              (i-1,j): has sums [a, b] (contiguous)\n              (i,j-1): has sums [c, d] (contiguous)\n              Then after shifting by A[i][j] (say 1): we get [a+1, b+1] and [c+1, d+1]. \n              The union might not be contiguous if there is a gap between b+1 and c+1? \n\n          But note: we have the following:\n\n              The minimum sum from above: a, and from left: c -> then the new minimum is min(a, c) + A[i][j]?\n              But wait: we are taking min_val = min( min_dp[i-1][j], min_dp[i][j-1] ) and then adding A[i][j] -> that gives the new minimum.\n\n          And similarly for maximum.\n\n          But the set might not be contiguous? \n\n          We had a counterexample for a 2x2 grid: \n              A = [[1, -1], [ -1, 1]] -> but this is for a different purpose? \n\n          Let me try with the grid:\n\n              A = [[1, -1],\n                   [ -1, 1]]\n\n          We want to know the set of sums at (1,1):\n\n            (0,0): 1 -> set={1}\n            (0,1): from (0,0): 1 + (-1) = 0 -> set={0}\n            (1,0): from (0,0): 1 + (-1) = 0 -> set={0}\n            (1,1): from (0,1): 0 + (-1) = -1; from (1,0): 0+1=1 -> set={-1,1} -> not contiguous.\n\n          Therefore, the set is not contiguous. \n\n          So the min_dp and max_dp are not enough.\n\n      We must use the bitset? \n\n      But the bitset in Python might be too slow? \n\n      Alternative: we can use a deque for BFS? But the grid is 10^6 cells and the sum ranges from -2000 to 2000 -> 4001 states per cell -> 10^6 * 4001 = 4e9 states -> too many.\n\n      We need to use the bitset with integer shifts, but we hope that the constant factor of 4001 is too high? \n\n      But 10^6 * 4001 = 4e9 operations -> in C++ it might be borderline, in Python it is too slow.\n\n      We need a better approach.\n\n      Insight: we only care if 0 is achievable? We don't need the entire set.\n\n      We can use a 2D boolean array for the entire grid? But the sum dimension is 4001 -> 10^6 * 4001 = 4e9 booleans -> 4e9 bytes = 4 GB -> too much.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use two 1D arrays for the current and next row, and for each row we store a bitset (as an integer) for the achievable sums? \n\n      We already have that. \n\n      And the operations per cell: \n          We do two shifts and two ORs? \n\n      But the shift and OR on an integer of 4001 bits: how expensive is it in Python? \n\n      We can hope that the integer operations are optimized in C? \n\n      But 4001 bits is 63 machine words? Then shifting by 1 is 63 operations? Then 10^6 * 63 = 63e6 -> acceptable in Python? \n\n      Let me test: \n\n          n = 1000, m = 1000 -> 1e6 cells.\n\n          For each cell: we do a few shifts and ORs on integers of 63 words? \n\n          How many operations per shift? \n\n            Shifting a 63-word integer by 1: we need to shift each word and handle the carry? But in Python, it's done in C and hopefully optimized.\n\n          We'll hope that it is fast enough.\n\n      We'll try to run locally with a worst-case grid: 1000x1000, but the total grid cells over test cases is 10^6, so we can have one test case.\n\n      But 10^6 * 63 = 63e6 operations -> in Python, 63e6 might run in a few seconds? \n\n      We'll try.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the following optimization: \n\n          We don't need to store the entire 4001 bits? We can store only the range [min_possible, max_possible] for the current row? \n\n          But the min_possible and max_possible for a cell (i,j) is [-(i+j+1), i+j+1] -> which is increasing as we go down. \n\n          We can use a sliding window? \n\n      But the range is increasing, and we are doing shifts? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use a bitset that is represented as an integer, and we shift and mask as before, but we hope that the constant factor is low.\n\n      Given the constraints (10^6 cells) and 63 machine words per bitset, we hope that 63e6 operations is acceptable.\n\n      We'll code and hope.\n\n      But note: the problem says the total grid cells over test cases is 10^6, so we only do 10^6 * 63 = 63e6 operations.\n\n      In Python, 63e6 operations might be acceptable.\n\n      We'll code accordingly.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the first cell: 1<<2001 might be expensive? But it's one time.\n\n      We'll run the example of 1000x1000 grid? \n\n      But we only have one test case of 1000x1000 -> 1e6 cells.\n\n      We'll hope.\n\n      Let's output the code.\n\n      But note: the provided code has a different structure. \n\n      The provided code for program2.py has:\n\n          if testcase is None: ... \n          else: ...\n\n      We'll integrate.\n\n      We are to complete the missing code in program2.py.\n\n      The provided code:\n\n          import sys\n          tokens = ''.join(sys.stdin.readlines()).split()[::-1]\n\n          def next(): return tokens.pop()\n          def nextInt(): return int(next())\n          def nextFloat(): return float(next())\n          def getIntArray(n): return [nextInt() for _ in range(n)]\n          def getFloatArray(n): return [nextFloat() for _ in range(n)]\n          def getStringArray(n): return [next() for _ in range(n)]\n\n          testcase = True\n          def solve(testcase = 1):\n              N, M = nextInt(), nextInt()\n              A = [getIntArray(M) for i in range(N)]\n\n              if N > M:\n                  A = [list(i) for i in zip(*A)]\n                  N, M = M, N\n\n              def get(sum):\n                  return sum + N + M\n\n              B = [[0] * M for i in range(N)]\n              B[0][0] |= 1 << get(A[0][0])\n\n              for i in range(N):\n                  for j in range(M):\n                      if i == 0 and j == 0: # TODO: Your code here\n                      if i: B[i][j] |= B[i-1][j]\n                      if j: B[i][j] |= B[i][j-1]\n                      if A[i][j] > 0: B[i][j] <<= 1\n                      else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n                  if i: B[i-1] = None\n\n              print(\"YES\" if B[-1][-1] & (1 << get(0)) else \"NO\")\n\n          if testcase is None:\n              testcaseCount = 1\n              while tokens:\n                  solve(testcaseCount)\n                  testcaseCount += 1\n          else:\n              testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\n              for tc in range(testcaseCount):\n                  solve(tc + 1)\n              assert not tokens\n\n      We see that the provided code has a different approach: \n\n          It has a function get(sum) = sum + N + M.\n\n          It then does:\n\n              B[0][0] |= 1 << get(A[0][0])\n\n          Then for each cell:\n\n              if i==0 and j==0: # TODO: Your code here\n\n              if i: B[i][j] |= B[i-1][j]\n              if j: B[i][j] |= B[i][j-1]\n\n              if A[i][j] > 0: \n                  B[i][j] <<= 1\n              else:\n                  B[i][j] >>= 1\n\n          Then after the row, it sets B[i-1] = None.\n\n          And then at the end, it checks B[-1][-1] has the bit at get(0) = 0+N+M.\n\n      This is similar to our bitset approach, but:\n\n          The offset is not 2000, but N+M.\n\n          And the range: the maximum sum is at most (N+M-1) (if all ones) and the minimum is -(N+M-1). So the total range is 2*(N+M-1)+1.\n\n          The offset = N+M, so the bit index for a sum s is s + (N+M).\n\n          The maximum bit index: (N+M-1) + (N+M) = 2*N+2*M-1.\n          The minimum bit index: -(N+M-1) + (N+M) = 1.\n\n          So the bitset for a cell has size about 2*(N+M) which is up to 4000, but N and M are at most 1000, so 2*(1000+1000)=4000 -> 4000 bits.\n\n          This is similar to our 4001 bits.\n\n      However, the provided code does not mask the bitset. \n\n          When it shifts left, it might go beyond the range? \n\n          But the maximum bit index we care about is 2*(N+M)-1, and the minimum is 1.\n\n          When we shift left, we might set a bit beyond 2*(N+M)-1? \n\n          Example: if we have a sum of (N+M-1) -> bit index = (N+M-1) + (N+M) = 2*N+2*M-1.\n          Then if we add a 1: we shift left: then the new bit index = 2*N+2*M -> which is beyond the maximum we care about? \n\n          But the maximum sum we care about is (N+M-1) +1 = N+M, which would be represented by (N+M) + (N+M) = 2*N+2*M.\n\n          So the provided code does not use a mask, and the bitset might grow arbitrarily? \n\n          However, the grid has only (N+M-1) steps, so the sum is at most (N+M-1) in absolute value, so the bit index is between 1 and 2*(N+M)-1.\n\n          When we shift left, we might set a bit at 2*N+2*M, which is beyond the range we care about? \n\n          But the next cell might then shift again? \n\n          And we only care about the bit at get(0)=N+M.\n\n          So as long as we don't care about the bits beyond, it might be safe? \n\n          However, the integer might become very large? \n\n          The maximum bit index we might set: the maximum sum is (N+M-1) -> bit index = 2*N+2*M-1.\n          Then we do (N+M-1) shifts? The maximum bit index could be up to 2*N+2*M-1 + (N+M-1) = 3*N+3*M-2? \n\n          And the number of cells is N*M, so the bitset might have up to 3*N+3*M-2 bits? \n\n          For N=M=1000, that's 6000 bits -> 6000/64 = 94 machine words -> still constant.\n\n          Therefore, we can do without mask.\n\n      The provided code has a TODO: \n\n          if i == 0 and j == 0: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          then it does:\n\n          if i: B[i][j] |= B[i-1][j]\n          if j: B[i][j] |= B[i][j-1]\n\n          then shifts.\n\n      For (0,0): we have already set B[0][0] = 1 << get(A[0][0]). \n\n          Then for (0,0) we should not do the OR from above or left? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n             if i == 0 and j == 0: \n                 # already set, so skip the OR and the shift? \n                 continue\n\n          But then after the if, we do the shift? \n\n          We don't want to shift (0,0) twice? \n\n          Let me see the code flow:\n\n             for i in range(N):\n                 for j in range(M):\n                     if i==0 and j==0: \n                         # skip the OR and the shift? \n                         continue\n                     if i: ... OR from above\n                     if j: ... OR from left\n                     if A[i][j]>0: shift left by 1\n                     else: shift right by 1\n\n          But (0,0) is set before the loop? Then in the loop for (0,0) we skip -> then B[0][0] is not shifted? \n\n          But we should shift (0,0)? \n\n          No, because (0,0) is the start. The value is A[0][0] -> we have represented it as 1<<get(A[0][0]). \n\n          Then for the next cell: (0,1): \n              i=0, j=1: \n                 if i: no\n                 if j: OR from left: B[0][0] -> which is 1<<get(A[0][0])\n                 then if A[0][1]>0: shift left by 1 -> becomes 1<<(get(A[0][0])+1)\n                 else: shift right by 1 -> becomes 1<<(get(A[0][0])-1)\n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n          We want: \n             The sum for (0,1) = A[0][0] + A[0][1] -> we want to set the bit at get(A[0][0]+A[0][1]).\n\n          But what is get(A[0][0]+A[0][1])? \n             get(s) = s + (N+M)\n\n          So the bit should be at: (A[0][0]+A[0][1]) + (N+M)\n\n          But the code does: \n             from (0,0): bit at get(A[0][0]) = A[0][0] + (N+M)\n             then shift by 1 (if A[0][1]>0) -> to (A[0][0]+ (N+M)) + 1 = A[0][0]+A[0][1] + (N+M)  [because A[0][1]=1] -> correct.\n\n          If A[0][1] = -1, then shift right: (A[0][0]+ (N+M)) - 1 = A[0][0]-1 + (N+M) = (A[0][0]+A[0][1]) + (N+M) -> correct.\n\n          Therefore, the shift is done for the cell (0,1) after ORing the previous cell.\n\n          But what about (0,0)? should we shift it? \n\n          In the code, (0,0) is not shifted in the loop. But we don't need to shift it because it is the start. \n\n          However, consider a path that has only (0,0): then we never shift it. That is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n             if i==0 and j==0: \n                 continue\n\n          But note: the code after the if does the OR and then the shift. We skip both.\n\n          That is what we want.\n\n      Also, the code has:\n\n          if i: B[i-1] = None   # to save memory? \n\n      We can keep that.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          if i == 0 and j == 0: \n              continue\n\n      But wait: the provided code already has:\n\n          B[0][0] |= 1 << get(A[0][0])\n\n          This is an OR, but initially B[0][0] is 0. So it becomes 1<<get(A[0][0]).\n\n          Then for (0,0) we skip the rest.\n\n      So we only need to fill the TODO with: \n          continue\n\n      But note: the problem has:\n\n          if N > M:\n              A = [list(i) for i in zip(*A)]\n              N, M = M, N\n\n          This is to transpose the grid if N>M. Why? \n\n          To save memory? Because then we do rows of length M, and if N>M, we make N and M swapped so that the number of rows is minimized? \n\n          But the total grid cells is the same. \n\n          However, in the bitset approach, we are doing row by row. The number of rows becomes min(N,M)? \n\n          But the code then uses N and M as the new dimensions.\n\n          This is an optimization: to minimize the number of rows, so that the dp array (which is for a row) has length = min(N,M)? \n\n          But the total grid cells is the same, so the total work is the same.\n\n          We'll leave it.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is simply:\n\n          continue\n\n      But let me test with the example: \n          n=1, m=2: [1, -1]\n\n          Steps:\n\n            N=1, M=2 -> N<=M, so no transpose.\n\n            B[0][0] = 0\n            B[0][0] |= 1<<get(A[0][0]) = 1<< (1+1+2) = 1<<4? \n\n          What is get(sum)? = sum + N+M = sum+3.\n\n          Then for (0,0): we set B[0][0] = "
