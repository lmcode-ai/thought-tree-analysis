But the sample output for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). We can also do: \n   a=2, b=4, c=2, d=2 -> for n=10: 2+4+2+2=10, gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> works. But then we have to output (2,4,2,2) for n=10? But the problem setter's example is (3,5,1,1). So there are multiple solutions. We can choose any. But note: the problem says \"output any of them\". So we can choose: For n%4==2: \n        Option 1: (1, n-3, 1, 1) -> always works. Option 2: (2, n-6, 2, 2) -> but then we require n-6>=1 -> n>=7 -> but n=6: then we get (2,0,2,2) -> invalid. Alternatively: (2, n-5, 1, 2) -> then total=2+n-5+1+2 = n -> works. Condition: gcd(2, n-5)=? and lcm(1,2)=2. So we require gcd(2, n-5)=2 -> which means n-5 must be even and positive? n mod4=2 -> n=4m+2 -> n-5=4m-3 -> which is odd -> so gcd(2,4m-3)=1 -> not 2 -> fails. Option 3: (2, 2, 2, n-6) -> then total=6+n-6=n -> works. Condition: gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2, n-6)=? We require that to be 2 -> so we require that n-6 is even? But n=4m+2 -> n-6=4m-4=4(m-1) -> even -> then lcm(2,4(m-1)) = 4(m-1) if m>=2? But we require 2 = 4(m-1) -> only when m=1.5 -> fails. Alternatively: (2, 2, 1, n-5) -> total=2+2+1+n-5=n -> works. Condition: gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(1, n-5)=n-5 -> so we require 2 = n-5 -> n=7 -> which is mod4=3 -> not 2. So the safe and simple option is (1, n-3, 1, 1). But the problem setter's example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). How can we get that? We can set: \n        a = k, b = n-3-k, c=1, d=1 -> then we require gcd(k, n-3-k)=1. We can choose k such that gcd(k, n-3-k)=1. Since n-3 is fixed, we can choose k=3? Then b=n-3-3 = n-6. For n=10: k=3, b=10-6=4? -> but then 3+4+1+1=9 -> not 10. Actually: a+b+c+d = k + (n-3-k) + 1 + 1 = n-1 -> not n. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, we can set: \n        a = k, b = n-2-k, c=1, d=1 -> then total = k + (n-2-k) + 1 + 1 = n -> works. Condition: gcd(k, n-2-k)=1. We can choose k=3? Then we require gcd(3, n-2-3)=gcd(3, n-5)=1. For n=10: gcd(3,5)=1 -> works -> so (3,5,1,1) for n=10. For n=6: k=3 -> then b=6-2-3=1 -> (3,1,1,1) -> gcd(3,1)=1 -> works. But what about n=14? k=3 -> then b=14-2-3=9 -> gcd(3,9)=3 -> not 1. So we need to choose k such that gcd(k, n-2-k)=1.",

For each test case, we are given an integer n (at least 4) and we need to output four positive integers a, b, c, d such that:\n   a + b + c + d = n\n   gcd(a, b) = lcm(c, d)\n\nLooking at the sample outputs and the provided code structure, we see that the code is trying to handle the cases based on n mod 4.\n\nThe provided code has:\n   if n%4==0: ... \n   elif n%4==1: ...\n   elif n%4==2: ... (missing)\n   else: ... (n%4==3)\n\nWe need to complete the case for n % 4 == 2.\n\nLet's analyze the sample outputs:\n\nFor n=4: (1,1,1,1) -> works: 1+1+1+1=4, gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\nFor n=7: (2,2,2,1) -> 2+2+2+1=7, gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2.\nFor n=8: (2,2,2,2) -> 2+2+2+2=8, gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2.\nFor n=9: (2,4,2,1) -> 2+4+2+1=9, gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2.\nFor n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> 3+5+1+1=10, gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\nBut note the provided code for n%4==1: \n   prints (m, 2*m, m, 1) for n=4*m+1? \n   For n=5: m=5//4=1 -> (1, 2, 1, 1) -> 1+2+1+1=5 -> but the condition: gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nHowever, the sample n=7 (which is 7 mod4=3) is handled in the else? But wait: 7 mod4=3 -> so the else case is for n%4==3? \nBut the else case in the code for n=7: \n   n=7 -> m=7//4=1 -> then else: prints (2, 4*1-2, 2, 1) = (2,2,2,1) -> which matches.\n\nBut what about n=10? 10 mod4=2 -> so we are missing that case.\n\nIn the sample, n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> 3+5+1+1=10.\n\nHow can we generalize?\n\nWe note that the problem says the answer always exists.\n\nLet me try to see patterns:\n\nWe can try to set:\n   a = x, b = k*x (so that gcd(a,b)=x) and then set the condition that x = lcm(c,d). \nBut note that we have freedom.\n\nAlternatively, we can use known constructions.\n\nOne common idea in the sample solutions for similar problems is to set:\n   a = k, b = k, then we have 2k + ... = n, and we require that gcd(k,k)=k = lcm(c,d).\n\nThen we can set c and d such that lcm(c,d)=k and c+d = n-2k.\n\nBut note: we have to have positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, we can set a and b arbitrarily and then set c and d arbitrarily as long as the condition holds.\n\nLooking at the provided code for other cases:\n\n   n%4==0: a=b=c=d = n/4 -> then gcd(a,b)=n/4, lcm(c,d)=n/4 -> works.\n\n   n%4==1: \n        a = m, b = 2*m, c = m, d = 1 -> total = m+2m+m+1 = 4m+1 = n -> works? \n        gcd(m,2m)=m, lcm(m,1)=m -> works.\n\n   n%4==3: \n        a=2, b=4*m-2, c=2, d=1 -> total = 2 + (4m-2) + 2 + 1 = 4m+3 = n -> \n        gcd(2,4m-2)=2 (because 4m-2 is even) and lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\nNow for n%4==2: n=4m+2.\n\nWe need a construction. Let's try to mimic the pattern.\n\nWe can try:\n   a = 1, b = 4m+1, c = 1, d = 1? -> but then gcd(1,4m+1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works? \n        But 1+4m+1+1+1 = 4m+4 = n+2 -> too big.\n\nWe need a+b+c+d=4m+2.\n\nWe can try to set two of them to 1? Then a+b = 4m. And we require gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). Since c and d are at least 1, lcm(c,d) is at least 1.\n\nBut we can set c=1, d=1 -> then lcm(1,1)=1, so we require gcd(a,b)=1. Then we can set a=2, b=4m? -> but 2+4m+1+1=4m+4 -> too big.\n\nAlternatively, set a=1, b=4m-1, c=1, d=1 -> total=1+4m-1+1+1=4m+2 -> works. And gcd(1,4m-1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut wait: 4m-1 must be positive -> so 4m-1>=1 -> m>=1. For m=0: n=2 -> but n>=4, so m>= (since n=4m+2, then m=(n-2)/4, and n>=4 -> m>= (4-2)/4=0.5 -> so m>=1? Actually n=6: m=(6-2)/4=1 -> then a=1, b=3, c=1, d=1 -> 1+3+1+1=6 -> works.\n\nBut let's check: gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nHowever, the sample n=10: which is 10=4*2+2 -> m=2 -> then we would output (1, 4*2-1, 1, 1) = (1,7,1,1) -> 1+7+1+1=10 -> but the sample output was (3,5,1,1). Why did they choose (3,5,1,1)? \n\nNote: both are valid. The problem says \"output any of them\".\n\nBut the sample output for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). Why? Because they want to maximize the number of candies? No, the problem doesn't require that. It just requires four positive integers satisfying the conditions.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"maximum number of candies\" in the description? Actually, the problem description is about a different problem (candies on a table with two people) but the code we are writing is for the problem of finding four numbers. \n\nWait, actually the problem we are solving is: \n   \"You are given a positive integer n. You have to find 4 positive integers a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d=n, and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\"\n\nSo we can output any valid quadruple.\n\nBut the sample n=10: (3,5,1,1) is also valid: gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\nSo both (1,7,1,1) and (3,5,1,1) are valid.\n\nHowever, the provided code for other cases uses multiples. We can try to use a similar pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n   a = 2, b = 4m, c = 1, d = 1? -> total=2+4m+1+1=4m+4 -> too big.\n\n   a = 2, b = 4m-1, c=1, d=1? -> total=2+4m-1+1+1=4m+3 -> not 4m+2.\n\nWe need 4m+2.\n\nAnother idea: set a = 1, b = 2, c = 2m, d = 2m-1? -> then total=1+2+2m+2m-1=4m+2 -> works. \n   Then condition: gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(2m,2m-1)=? \n        Since 2m and 2m-1 are coprime, lcm(2m,2m-1)= (2m)*(2m-1). \n        But we require that to be 1? -> no.\n\nAlternatively, set a = 2, b = 2, c = 2m-1, d=1? -> total=2+2+2m-1+1=4m+4 -> too big.\n\nAnother idea: set a = 2, b = 2m, c = 2, d = 2m-2? -> total=2+2m+2+2m-2=4m+2 -> works.\n   Condition: gcd(2,2m)=2 (if m>=1) and lcm(2,2m-2)=? \n        lcm(2,2m-2)=2m-2? if 2m-2 is even? Actually, if m>=2 then 2m-2 is even -> then lcm(2,2m-2)=2m-2? \n        But we require 2 = 2m-2 -> then m=2. So only for m=2 it works.\n\nWe need a general solution.\n\nLet me look at the sample n=10: 10 mod4=2 -> m= (10-2)/4 = 2 -> so m=2.\n\nThe sample output is (3,5,1,1). How can we express that? \n   a=3, b=5, c=1, d=1 -> total=10.\n   We can set: a = m+1, b = 2*m+1, c=1, d=1? -> then total = (m+1)+(2m+1)+1+1 = 3m+4. \n        For m=2: 3*2+4=10 -> works. \n        Condition: gcd(m+1,2m+1)=? \n            Note: gcd(m+1,2m+1)=gcd(m+1,2m+1-2*(m+1))=gcd(m+1,-1)=gcd(m+1,1)=1 -> so it works.\n\nBut what about m=1? n=4*1+2=6: then a=1+1=2, b=2*1+1=3, c=1, d=1 -> total=2+3+1+1=7 -> not 6.\n\nSo that doesn't work for m=1.\n\nAlternatively, we can set: a = 1, b = 4m+1 - 2? -> no.\n\nAnother idea: set a = 1, b = 4m, c=1, d=0 -> but d must be positive.\n\nWe must have positive integers.\n\nWe can set: a = 1, b = 4m-1, c=1, d=1 -> as I did earlier. \n   For m=1: n=6 -> a=1, b=3, c=1, d=1 -> works.\n   For m=2: n=10 -> a=1, b=7, c=1, d=1 -> works.\n\nBut the sample output for n=10 was (3,5,1,1). Why did they choose that? \n   It doesn't matter, as long as it's valid.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"It is possible to show that the answer always exists.\" and we can output any.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: n>=4, and the total n can be up to 10^9.\n\nSo we can output (1, n-3, 1, 1) for the case n%4==2? \n   Then condition: gcd(1, n-3)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut wait: n-3 must be positive? Since n>=6 (because n mod4=2 and n>=4 -> the smallest is 6) then n-3>=3>0 -> valid.\n\nSo we can do: \n   a=1, b=n-3, c=1, d=1.\n\nBut the sample n=10: then we output (1,7,1,1) -> which is valid.\n\nHowever, the sample output for n=10 in the note is (3,5,1,1). Why? Maybe because they want to avoid having a 1 and a very large number? But the problem does not specify.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and 1 is positive and n-3 is positive for n>=4? Actually for n=4: but n=4 mod4=0 -> so we don't use this for n=4. For n=6: 1,3,1,1 -> valid.\n\nBut the problem says: \"maximum number of candies\" in the first problem? Actually, the first problem is about Alice and Bob and candies, but the second problem is about four numbers. \n\nWait, the problem we are solving is the second one? \n\nLooking at the problem statement: \n   \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\"\n\n   Description: ... (the one about four numbers)\n\nSo we are solving the four numbers problem.\n\nTherefore, we can output (1, n-3, 1, 1) for the case n%4==2.\n\nBut let me check the sample n=6: \n   (1,3,1,1): 1+3+1+1=6 -> works, gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nn=10: (1,7,1,1): 1+7+1+1=10 -> works.\n\nBut the sample provided for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). Why did they choose that? Maybe because they want to avoid having one number being too large? But the problem does not require any particular distribution.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same pattern as the other cases: \n   For n%4==1: they used (m, 2m, m, 1) -> which is (m, 2m, m, 1) -> total=4m+1.\n   For n%4==3: they used (2, 4m-2, 2, 1) -> total=4m+3.\n\nFor n%4==2: we can try to use (m, 2m+1, m+1, 1) -> total = m + (2m+1) + (m+1) + 1 = 4m+3 -> not 4m+2.\n\nAlternatively: (m, 2m, m, 2) -> total=4m+2 -> works? \n   Then condition: gcd(m,2m)=m, lcm(m,2)=? \n        If m is even, then lcm(m,2)=m? -> then m=m -> works.\n        If m is odd, then lcm(m,2)=2m? -> then we require m=2m -> m=0 -> not possible.\n\nSo that only works for even m.\n\nWe need a construction that works for any m.\n\nAnother idea: (1, 2, 1, n-4) -> but then we require gcd(1,2)=1 and lcm(1, n-4)=? \n        lcm(1, n-4)=n-4 -> so we require 1 = n-4 -> then n=5 -> but n mod4=2 -> n>=6 -> so n-4>=2 -> not 1.\n\nAlternatively: (1, 1, 2, n-4) -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(2, n-4)=? \n        We require 1 = lcm(2, n-4). But lcm(2, n-4) is at least 2 -> so not 1.\n\nWe can set: (1, 1, 1, n-3) -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1, n-3)=n-3 -> so we require 1 = n-3 -> n=4 -> but n mod4=0.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the simple solution (1, n-3, 1, 1) is valid and easy.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and n-3 is positive for n>=4? Actually for n=4: we are in the mod4=0 case. For n=6: n-3=3>0 -> valid.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   if n%4==2:\n        print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut wait: the sample output for n=10 in the note is (3,5,1,1). Why did they choose that? \n   It might be because they want to avoid having one very large number? But the problem does not specify.\n\nHowever, the problem constraints: n up to 10^9, so n-3 is about 10^9, which is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check the sample n=10: \n   (1,7,1,1) -> 1+7+1+1=10 -> valid.\n\nBut the note says: \n   \"In the fifth test case (3,5,1,1) for n=10\"\n\nSo the problem setter's example output for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). \n\nWe can also output (3,5,1,1) for n=10? How? \n   We can set: \n        a=3, b=5, c=1, d=1 -> total=10, gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut how to generalize? \n   We can set: \n        a = 2, b = n-4, c=1, d=1 -> then gcd(2, n-4)=? \n            We require that to be 1? -> so we require that n-4 is odd? \n            But n mod4=2 -> n=4m+2 -> then n-4=4m-2 -> which is even -> so gcd(2,4m-2)=2 -> and we require that to equal lcm(1,1)=1 -> fails.\n\n   a=3, b=n-5, c=1, d=1 -> then gcd(3, n-5)=? \n        We require that to be 1. \n        But n=4m+2 -> n-5=4m-3. \n        gcd(3,4m-3)=gcd(3,4m) -> but 4m mod3 = m mod3? \n        It might not be 1.\n\nFor example, if m=1: n=6 -> then a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1 -> gcd(3,1)=1 -> works.\n        m=2: n=10 -> a=3, b=5 -> gcd(3,5)=1 -> works.\n        m=3: n=14 -> a=3, b=9 -> gcd(3,9)=3 -> not 1 -> fails.\n\nSo that fails for m=3.\n\nTherefore, the safe way is to set a=1, b=n-3, c=1, d=1.\n\nBut the problem setter's example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). How did they get that? \n   They might have a different construction.\n\nLooking at the sample outputs:\n\n   n=4: (1,1,1,1)\n   n=5: (1,2,1,1) -> but the code for n%4==1: (m,2m,m,1) -> for n=5: m=1 -> (1,2,1,1) -> matches.\n   n=6: ? -> we are missing, but we can do (1,3,1,1) -> but the problem setter might have a different one? \n   n=7: (2,2,2,1) -> from the code for n%4==3: (2,4m-2,2,1) -> m=1 -> (2,2,2,1) -> matches.\n   n=8: (2,2,2,2) -> from n%4==0: (2,2,2,2) -> matches.\n   n=9: (2,4,2,1) -> from the code? n=9 mod4=1 -> m=9//4=2 -> then (2,4,2,1) -> matches? \n        But wait: 2+4+2+1=9 -> matches, and gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> matches.\n   n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> which is not (1,7,1,1) and not (2,4,2,2) because 2+4+2+2=10 but then gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> that would work too. \n\nBut the sample output for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). \n\nWe can also do: \n   a=2, b=4, c=2, d=2 -> for n=10: 2+4+2+2=10, gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> works.\n\nBut then we have to output (2,4,2,2) for n=10? \n\nBut the problem setter's example is (3,5,1,1). \n\nSo there are multiple solutions.\n\nWe can choose any.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"output any of them\".\n\nSo we can choose:\n\n   For n%4==2: \n        Option 1: (1, n-3, 1, 1) -> always works.\n        Option 2: (2, n-6, 2, 2) -> but then we require n-6>=1 -> n>=7 -> but n=6: then we get (2,0,2,2) -> invalid.\n\n        Alternatively: (2, n-5, 1, 2) -> then total=2+n-5+1+2 = n -> works. \n        Condition: gcd(2, n-5)=? and lcm(1,2)=2.\n        So we require gcd(2, n-5)=2 -> which means n-5 must be even and positive? \n            n mod4=2 -> n=4m+2 -> n-5=4m-3 -> which is odd -> so gcd(2,4m-3)=1 -> not 2 -> fails.\n\n        Option 3: (2, 2, 2, n-6) -> then total=6+n-6=n -> works.\n        Condition: gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2, n-6)=? \n            We require that to be 2 -> so we require that n-6 is even? \n            But n=4m+2 -> n-6=4m-4=4(m-1) -> even -> then lcm(2,4(m-1)) = 4(m-1) if m>=2? \n            But we require 2 = 4(m-1) -> only when m=1.5 -> fails.\n\n        Alternatively: (2, 2, 1, n-5) -> total=2+2+1+n-5=n -> works.\n        Condition: gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(1, n-5)=n-5 -> so we require 2 = n-5 -> n=7 -> which is mod4=3 -> not 2.\n\nSo the safe and simple option is (1, n-3, 1, 1).\n\nBut the problem setter's example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). How can we get that? \n   We can set: \n        a = k, b = n-3-k, c=1, d=1 -> then we require gcd(k, n-3-k)=1. \n        We can choose k such that gcd(k, n-3-k)=1. \n        Since n-3 is fixed, we can choose k=3? Then b=n-3-3 = n-6. \n        For n=10: k=3, b=10-6=4? -> but then 3+4+1+1=9 -> not 10. \n        Actually: a+b+c+d = k + (n-3-k) + 1 + 1 = n-1 -> not n.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, we can set: \n        a = k, b = n-2-k, c=1, d=1 -> then total = k + (n-2-k) + 1 + 1 = n -> works.\n        Condition: gcd(k, n-2-k)=1.\n\n        We can choose k=3? Then we require gcd(3, n-2-3)=gcd(3, n-5)=1.\n        For n=10: gcd(3,5)=1 -> works -> so (3,5,1,1) for n=10.\n\n        For n=6: k=3 -> then b=6-2-3=1 -> (3,1,1,1) -> gcd(3,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        But what about n=14? k=3 -> then b=14-2-3=9 -> gcd(3,9)=3 -> not 1.\n\n        So we need to choose k such that gcd(k, n-2-k)=1. \n        Note that k and n-2-k are two numbers that add to n-2. \n        We can choose k=1? -> then b=n-3 -> which is the same as our first option -> works.\n\n        Or k=2? -> then b=n-4 -> gcd(2, n-4)=? \n            n mod4=2 -> n-4 mod2 = (2 mod4 - 4 mod4) mod2 = (2-0) mod2=0? -> so n-4 is even -> gcd(2, even)=2 -> unless n-4=0? but n>=6 -> n-4>=2 -> so gcd=2 -> not 1.\n\n        k=3: as above, might not be 1.\n\n        k=4: then b=n-6 -> gcd(4, n-6)=? \n            n=4m+2 -> n-6=4m-4 -> gcd(4,4m-4)=4 -> unless m=1 -> then n=6 -> n-6=0 -> invalid.\n\n        k=5: then b=n-7 -> gcd(5, n-7)=? \n            n=4m+2 -> n-7=4m-5 -> gcd(5,4m-5)=gcd(5,4m) -> which might be 5 if 5 divides 4m? \n\n        So it's not trivial to choose a fixed k.\n\nTherefore, the simplest is to use k=1: then we get (1, n-3, 1, 1) which always works.\n\nBut the problem setter's example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). \n\nHowever, the problem does not require a particular solution. So we can output (1, n-3, 1, 1) for the case n%4==2.\n\nBut note: the provided code for other cases does not use such a large number. For example, for n=10, the other cases use numbers that are about n/4. \n\nBut the problem does not require that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the construction from the sample: \n   For n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> but we saw that k=3 works for n=10 and n=6, but fails for n=14.\n\nWe need a k that is coprime with n-2-k. We can choose k= n-3? -> then b= n-2 - (n-3)=1 -> then (n-3,1,1,1) -> which is the same as (1, n-3, 1,1) by swapping? \n   But note: the problem does not specify the order? \n   The problem says: \"output four positive integers a, b, c, d\"\n\n   And the condition is: gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). \n\n   So we can output (n-3,1,1,1) -> then gcd(n-3,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n   But that is essentially the same as (1, n-3, 1,1) if we swap a and b? but the problem does not require a particular order for a and b? \n   Actually, the condition is symmetric in a and b? not exactly: the gcd is symmetric. \n\n   So (a,b) and (b,a) are the same for gcd. Similarly, (c,d) and (d,c) are the same for lcm.\n\n   Therefore, (1, n-3, 1,1) and (n-3,1,1,1) are both valid.\n\nBut the problem setter's example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1) -> which is (a=3, b=5, c=1, d=1). \n\nWe can also output (1,1,1,n-3) -> but then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,n-3)=n-3 -> so we require 1=n-3 -> n=4 -> not applicable.\n\nSo the only safe and simple construction that always works is to set a=1, b=n-3, c=1, d=1.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and n-3>=1 for n>=4? \n   For n=4: we are in the mod4=0 case -> so n>=6 for mod4=2 -> n-3>=3>0.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n   if n%4==2:\n        print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut wait: the sample n=10: we output (1,7,1,1) -> which is valid.\n\nHowever, the problem setter's example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). \n\nBut the problem says \"output any of them\", so both are acceptable.\n\nBut note: the provided code for other cases uses the variable m. We can also use m for consistency.\n\nIn the code, for n%4==0: m = n//4 -> then output (m, m, m, m)\nfor n%4==1: m = n//4 -> then output (m, 2*m, m, 1) -> note: 4*m+1 = n -> so m = (n-1)//4\nfor n%4==3: m = n//4 -> then output (2, 4*m-2, 2, 1) -> note: 4*m+3 = n -> so m = (n-3)//4\n\nFor n%4==2: m = n//4 -> but then 4*m+2 = n -> so m = (n-2)//4.\n\nWe can try to express our solution in terms of m? \n   (1, n-3, 1, 1) = (1, 4*m+2-3, 1, 1) = (1, 4*m-1, 1, 1)\n\nBut the other cases use m in a different way: they use m as a base multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, we can output (1, 4*m-1, 1, 1) for the case n%4==2.\n\nBut note: the code already sets m = n//4 -> which for n=10: m=10//4=2 -> then 4*2-1=7 -> so (1,7,1,1).\n\nSo we can write:\n\n   elif n%4==2:\n        print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut wait: what if n=6? m=6//4=1 -> then 4*1-1=3 -> (1,3,1,1) -> works.\n\nBut note: integer division: for n=6, m=6//4=1 -> which is floor division -> correct.\n\nBut the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 200000? Actually, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\" for the first problem? \n\nWait, the problem we are solving (the four numbers) has input: \n   t (up to 10000) and each n up to 200000? but then the sum of n over test cases <= 200000? \n   Actually, the note says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\" -> but that was for the first problem? \n\nLooking back: the first problem (program1.py) has that constraint. The second problem (program2.py) has: \n   t (1<=t<=10000) and each n (4<=n<=10^9) and the sum of n over test cases is not bounded by 200000? \n\nBut the problem statement for the second problem says: \n   \"The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=10000) \u2014 the number of test cases. ... It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\" \n\nWait, that note might be for the first problem? \n\nBut the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\nSo we are completing two programs.\n\nBut the description for program1.py: \n   \"The first line contains an integer t (1<=t<=10000) \u2014 the number of test cases. ... It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nAnd for program2.py: \n   \"The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=10000) \u2014 the number of test cases. ... It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\" -> but wait, the constraint for n in program2.py is up to 10^9, and the sum of n over test cases <=200000? That would be impossible because t can be up to 10000 and n>=4 -> the sum would be at least 40000, but 200000 is the bound? \n\nActually, the problem statement for program2.py says: \n   \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nBut note: n can be up to 10^9, but the sum of the n's (over test cases) is at most 200000? That would imply that the total number of test cases t is at most 200000/4 = 50000? but t<=10000, and 10000 * (minimum n=4) = 40000, which is <=200000? -> no, 10000*4=40000, but the constraint says the sum of n, so if each n is 4, then total=40000, which is <=200000? but 40000<=200000 -> true. \n\nBut wait: the constraint says the sum of n over test cases <=200000? \n   Then the maximum n in a test case could be 200000? but the problem says n can be up to 10^9 -> but if the sum is bounded by 200000, then each n must be small? \n\nActually, the problem says: \n   \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nSo the n in the test cases for program2.py are small? \n\nBut the input specification says: \n   \"Each test case contains a single line with integer n (4<=n<=10^9)\"\n\nand then the note: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nThis is contradictory because if n can be 10^9, then even one test case would break the sum. \n\nBut the problem says: \"the sum of n\" meaning the sum of the values of n for all test cases? \n\nBut 10^9 is already bigger than 200000.\n\nI think there might be a confusion: the note \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\" is for the first problem (program1.py). \n\nLooking at the first problem: \n   \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1<=n<=200000) \u2014 the number of candies ... It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nSo that makes sense: the sum of the n's (the number of candies) over test cases <=200000.\n\nBut for the second problem: \n   The input n (the total sum) is up to 10^9, and the note about the sum of n over test cases is not present? \n\nActually, the problem statement for the second problem does not have that note? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Input Specification: ... It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\" \n\nWait, I see: the problem statement for the second problem has: \n   \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nBut that must be a mistake? Because n can be up to 10^9 and the sum of n over test cases (with t up to 10000) would be astronomical.\n\nRe-read: the problem statement for the second problem: \n   \"The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=10000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a single line with integer n (4<=n<=10^9) \u2014 the sum of a, b, c, and d.\"\n\n   And then: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nThis is impossible. \n\nI think there is a confusion: the note \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\" is for the first problem. \n\nBut the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\nAnd the description for program1.py has that note, and the description for program2.py does not have that note? \n\nLooking at the provided code for program2.py: \n   The input is t, then t test cases each with an integer n.\n\n   And the constraint: n up to 10^9, and t up to 10000.\n\n   And there is no note about the sum of n.\n\nBut the problem statement for program2.py in the description above says: \n   \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\"\n\nThis is likely a copy-paste error from the first problem.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must assume that t can be up to 10000 and n up to 10^9, and the sum of the n's (the values) is not bounded by 200000. \n\nBut our solution (1, n-3, 1, 1) uses n-3 which is about 10^9, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nSo we can write for program2.py:\n\n   elif n%4==2:\n        print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut the problem setter's example for n=10 is (3,5,1,1). \n\nHowever, the problem says \"output any\", so we can do that.\n\nBut let me check the sample n=10: \n   (1,7,1,1): 1+7+1+1=10 -> works.\n\nSo we'll do that.\n\nBut wait: the provided code for other cases uses the variable m. We have m = n//4. \n   For n%4==2: n=4m+2 -> so n-3 = 4m+2-3 = 4m-1.\n\nSo we can also write: \n        print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nThis is equivalent.\n\nNow, what about the first program (program1.py)? \n\nWe are given the first program: \n\n   Description: There are n candies ... \n   Input: t test cases, each with n and a list of n integers (weights)\n\n   Constraints: t up to 10000, n up to 200000, but the sum of n over test cases <=200000.\n\n   We need to output the maximum total number of candies they can eat such that the total weight Alice eats equals the total weight Bob eats.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            4\n            3\n            10 20 10\n            6\n            2 1 4 2 4 1\n            5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            6\n            1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n        Output:\n            2\n            6\n            0\n            4\n\n   How to solve:\n\n   We are to choose:\n        Alice eats a prefix: [0, i-1] (0-indexed, from left to i-1)\n        Bob eats a suffix: [j, n-1] (from j to n-1)\n        And we require that the sum of the prefix (Alice) equals the sum of the suffix (Bob), and we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten = i + (n - j).\n\n   But note: the candies cannot overlap: so i <= j.\n\n   We can also have Alice eat nothing? but then Bob must eat nothing to have the same weight (0=0) -> total=0, but we can do better.\n\n   We can use two pointers:\n\n        Let left = 0, right = n-1.\n        Let sumA = 0, sumB = 0.\n        We want to have sumA = sumB at some point, and then we record the total candies = (left) + (n-1 - right + 1) = left + (n - right) [because Bob eats from right to n-1, so the number of candies Bob eats is n-1 - right + 1 = n - right].\n\n        But note: the candies Alice eats are from index0 to left-1 -> so left candies.\n        Bob eats from right to n-1 -> so n - right candies.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            left = 0, right = n-1\n            best = 0\n            while left <= right:\n                if sumA == sumB:\n                    # we can record the total candies: left + (n - 1 - right + 1) = left + n - right\n                    best = left + n - right - 1?  -> wait, let me index:\n\n                    Actually, Alice has eaten [0, left-1] -> left candies.\n                    Bob has eaten [right, n-1] -> n - right candies.\n\n                    So total = left + (n - right)\n\n                    But note: we haven't processed the current pointers? \n\n                    We can then try to extend? \n\n                if sumA <= sumB:\n                    # we add a candy from the left\n                    sumA += w[left]\n                    left += 1\n                else:\n                    sumB += w[right]\n                    right -= 1\n\n            But we also need to check when they meet? \n\n        However, note: we cannot have a candy eaten twice.\n\n        But the above while loop might overshoot: when left>right, we break.\n\n        We need to record every time we have an equality.\n\n        Example: \n            n=3, [10,20,10]\n            left=0, right=2, sumA=0, sumB=0 -> then we do: since sumA==sumB, record total=0+ (3-2)=0+1=1? -> but then we add: \n                then we do: since sumA<=sumB (0<=0) -> we add w[0]=10 -> sumA=10, left=1.\n                then: sumA=10, sumB=0 -> so we add to sumB: w[2]=10 -> sumB=10, right=1.\n                then: left=1, right=1 -> we check: sumA=10, sumB=10 -> record total = 1 (from Alice) + (3-1=2) from Bob? -> 1+2=3 -> but that would be 3 candies? \n                But the answer is 2.\n\n            Why? because the candy at index1 (which is 20) is not eaten by either.\n\n            So we record at the moment we have sumA==sumB: total = left + (n - right - 1)? \n\n            Actually, at the moment we have sumA==sumB, we have:\n                Alice has eaten [0, left-1] -> left candies.\n                Bob has eaten [right, n-1] -> n - right candies.\n\n            And we haven't eaten the candy at left (if left<=right) or we have? \n\n            In the above, when we have left=1 and right=1: \n                Alice has eaten [0,0] -> 1 candy.\n                Bob has eaten [2,2] -> 1 candy.\n                The candy at index1 is not eaten.\n\n            So total=2.\n\n            How do we get that? \n                total = left + (n - right - 1) ? -> 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> works.\n\n            But wait: when we are at left=1 and right=1, we have not processed the candy at index1. \n            So the candies eaten are [0,0] and [2,2] -> that's left=1 and n-1 - right + 1 = n - right = 3-1=2? -> 1+2=3 -> that counts the candy at index1? \n\n            Actually, Bob eats from index1 to n-1? no, Bob eats from index right to n-1 -> so if right=1, then Bob eats [1,2]? -> that's 2 candies? \n\n            But we only want Bob to eat the suffix? and we started at right=2 and then moved to right=1 -> so we added the candy at index2 and then at index1? \n\n            How do we define the state? \n\n            We can define:\n                left: the next candy available for Alice (so Alice has eaten [0, left-1])\n                right: the next candy available for Bob (so Bob has eaten [right+1, n-1])? \n\n            But the code in the note does:\n\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                l2=[]\n                while (p1-1<=p2):   # I think they meant p1<=p2? \n                    if s1 == s2: \n                        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # p1: number of candies Alice has eaten? because she ate from 0 to p1-1 -> p1 candies.\n                                                  # Bob: ate from p2+1 to n-1 -> so n-1-p2 candies? \n                                                  # total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = p1 + n - 1 - p2\n                        s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s1 < s2: \n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    if s2 < s1: \n                        s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n            But note: the condition in the while: (p1-1<=p2) -> that is p1<=p2+1.\n\n            And when we record an equality, we do: l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2) -> then we add one more for Alice? \n\n            Then we break the condition? \n\n            Actually, the code in the note has:\n\n                if s1 == s2: \n                    l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); \n                    s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n\n            Then it checks s1<s2 and s2<s1.\n\n            This might be flawed.\n\n            We need to design:\n\n            We have two pointers: \n                p1: the next candy for Alice to eat (so Alice has eaten [0, p1-1] -> p1 candies, total weight s1)\n                p2: the next candy for Bob to eat (so Bob has eaten [p2+1, n-1] -> n-1-p2 candies, total weight s2)\n\n            Then we are at a state: \n                We haven't eaten the candy at p1 and p2.\n\n            We can:\n                if s1 == s2: \n                    we record the total candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) \n                    then we can try to extend: we let Alice eat the next candy? -> s1 += l[p1]; p1++\n\n                else if s1 < s2: \n                    we let Alice eat the next candy: s1 += l[p1]; p1++\n\n                else: \n                    we let Bob eat the next candy: s2 += l[p2]; p2--\n\n            And we do this while p1 <= p2? \n\n            But note: after we record an equality, we extend Alice. Then we break the equality? \n\n            We want to record every time we have an equality? \n\n            Example: n=3, [10,20,10]\n\n            p1=0, p2=2: s1=0, s2=0 -> record: total = 0 + (3-1-2)=0? -> then we do: s1 += l[0]=10, p1=1.\n            Then state: s1=10, s2=0 -> then we do: s2 < s1 -> so s2 += l[2]=10, p2=1.\n            Then state: s1=10, s2=10 -> record: total = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then we do: s1 += l[1]=20, p1=2.\n            Then p1=2, p2=1 -> p1>p2? -> break? \n            Then we output the last recorded? or the maximum? \n\n            The code in the note appends to l2 every time there is an equality. Then at the end it prints l2[-1]. \n\n            So for the example: l2 = [0,2] -> then output 2 -> which is correct.\n\n            But what if we have multiple equalities? we want the last one? but the problem says the maximum total number of candies? \n\n            Actually, as we extend, the total number of candies increases? \n\n            In the example: \n                first equality: total=0 -> then we extend Alice -> then extend Bob -> then we get total=2 -> which is larger.\n\n            But note: we cannot extend indefinitely because we are limited by the array.\n\n            So we record every time we have an equality, and then we take the last one? but the last one might not be the maximum? \n\n            Actually, the total candies recorded at an equality is: p1 + (n-1-p2). \n            As we move, p1 increases and p2 decreases -> so the total increases? \n\n            But when we extend, we break the equality and then we try to restore. \n\n            However, the total candies at the next equality might be larger? \n\n            Example: \n                [1,1,1,1] \n                p1=0, p2=3: s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0+ (4-1-3)=0 -> then we extend Alice: p1=1, s1=1.\n                then s1=1, s2=0 -> extend Bob: p2=2, s2=1 -> now s1==s2=1 -> record total=1 + (4-1-2)=1+1=2 -> then we extend Alice: p1=2, s1=2.\n                then s1=2, s2=1 -> extend Bob: p2=1, s2=2 -> now s1==s2=2 -> record total=2 + (4-1-1)=2+2=4 -> then we extend Alice: p1=3, s1=3 -> then p1=3, p2=1 -> p1>p2? -> break.\n                Then output 4.\n\n            But the answer for [1,1,1,1] should be 4? because Alice eats [0,1] (two candies, sum=2) and Bob eats [2,3] (two candies, sum=2) -> total=4.\n\n            However, the sample output for the fourth test case: \n                \"6\n                 1 1 1 1 1 1\" -> output 4? \n                But the sample output says 4? \n\n            Actually, the fourth test case: \n                Input: \n                    6\n                    1 1 1 1 1 1\n                Output: \n                    4\n\n            Why? \n                They can eat: \n                    Alice: [0,1] -> two candies, sum=2\n                    Bob: [4,5] -> two candies, sum=2\n                    total=4.\n\n            But they could also eat: \n                    Alice: [0,2] -> three candies, sum=3\n                    Bob: [3,5] -> three candies, sum=3 -> total=6? \n\n            Why is the answer 4? \n\n            The problem says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies. What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\"\n\n            In the 6 candies: \n                If Alice eats [0,2] (3 candies, sum=3) and Bob eats [3,5] (3 candies, sum=3) -> then total=6, which is more than 4.\n\n            But the sample output is 4? \n\n            Or is it 6? \n\n            The sample input: \n                \"6\n                 1 1 1 1 1 1\" -> output 4? \n\n            But the example in the problem statement: \n                \"In the fourth test case $$$\\gcd(2, 4) = \\operatorname{lcm}(2, 1) = 2$$$, $$$2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9$$$.\" \n\n            That was for the second problem.\n\n            For the first problem, the sample outputs are:\n                2\n                6\n                0\n                4\n\n            The fourth test case: 4.\n\n            Why 4? \n\n            Let me simulate:\n\n                n=6, [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n                We can have:\n                    Option 1: Alice eats [0] (1 candy, weight=1), Bob eats [5] (1 candy, weight=1) -> total=2.\n                    Option 2: Alice eats [0,1] (2, weight=2), Bob eats [4,5] (2, weight=2) -> total=4.\n                    Option 3: Alice eats [0,1,2] (3, weight=3), Bob eats [3,4,5] (3, weight=3) -> total=6.\n\n                Why is the answer 4? \n\n            The problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". \n\n            But in option 3, Alice eats [0,1,2] and Bob eats [3,4,5] -> no overlap -> and the weights are equal -> so total=6.\n\n            Then why the sample output is 4? \n\n            The sample input for the first problem: \n                \"4\n                 3\n                 10 20 10\n                 6\n                 2 1 4 2 4 1\n                 5\n                 1 2 3 4 5\n                 6\n                 1 1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n            The outputs: \n                2\n                6\n                0\n                4\n\n            The fourth test case: 6 ones -> output 4.\n\n            This implies that the maximum total is 4? \n\n            Why not 6? \n\n            The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> so she must eat a contiguous prefix? \n\n            And Bob: contiguous suffix.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"from the left\" and \"in a row\", so contiguous.\n\n            And they cannot overlap -> so the prefix and suffix must be disjoint.\n\n            But if Alice eats [0,1,2] (the first three) and Bob eats [3,4,5] (the last three), that is valid.\n\n            So why the answer is 4? \n\n            Let me read the problem again: \n                \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n            This means Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix. They can choose independently, but the prefix and suffix must be contiguous and disjoint.\n\n            But note: the entire set of candies is in a row. If Alice eats the first three, then Bob can only eat from the right starting after the last candy Alice ate? \n\n            The candies are put from left to right. Alice eats from the left, so she eats the leftmost part. Bob eats from the right, so he eats the rightmost part. \n\n            But what if there are candies in the middle? \n\n            Example: \n                Candies: [A, B, C, D, E, F]\n                Alice eats [A,B,C] -> then Bob can only eat [D,E,F]? \n                But the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" -> so he can eat [F] or [E,F] or [D,E,F]. \n\n            But the condition: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> so Bob cannot eat any candy that Alice ate. \n\n            And since Alice ate the first three, Bob can only eat the last three.\n\n            So total=6.\n\n            But the sample output is 4.\n\n            There is a known problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1669/F\n\n            In that problem, the sample: \n                6\n                1 1 1 1 1 1\n                -> output 6\n\n            But the sample output in the problem statement for the first program is 4.\n\n            This is confusing.\n\n            Let me check the sample input and output provided in the first program:\n\n                Input:\n                    4\n                    3\n                    10 20 10\n                    6\n                    2 1 4 2 4 1\n                    5\n                    1 2 3 4 5\n                    6\n                    1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n                Output:\n                    2\n                    6\n                    0\n                    4\n\n            The known problem (Codeforces 1669F) has:\n\n                Example: \n                    Input: \n                        6\n                        2 1 4 2 4 1\n                    Output: \n                        6\n\n                And the sample: \n                    Input: \n                        1\n                        6\n                        1 1 1 1 1 1\n                    Output: \n                        6\n\n            So why in our problem the fourth test case is 4? \n\n            I see: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> but it doesn't say she must eat a contiguous segment starting at the very left? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"from the left\", meaning she can only eat a prefix. Similarly, Bob eats a suffix.\n\n            And the entire set is contiguous. So Alice eats a prefix and Bob eats a suffix, and they must be disjoint.\n\n            The only constraint is that the prefix and suffix are disjoint.\n\n            So for [1,1,1,1,1,1]: \n                Alice eats the first 3, Bob eats the last 3 -> valid.\n\n            But the sample output is 4.\n\n            Unless the problem means that after Alice eats, the remaining candies are still in a row? and then Bob eats from the right of the remaining? \n\n            But then the candies in the middle are not eaten by anyone? \n\n            The problem does not say they have to eat all candies. They can leave some in the middle.\n\n            And the goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n            So for [1,1,1,1,1,1]: \n                We can also do:\n                    Alice eats the first 2: [0,1] -> sum=2\n                    Bob eats the last 2: [4,5] -> sum=2\n                    total=4.\n\n                Or:\n                    Alice eats the first 3: [0,1,2] -> sum=3\n                    Bob eats the last 3: [3,4,5] -> sum=3\n                    total=6.\n\n            So 6 is better.\n\n            Therefore, the sample output of 4 for the fourth test case is not expected.\n\n            But the problem statement says: \n                \"In the fourth test case $$$\\gcd(2, 4) = \\operatorname{lcm}(2, 1) = 2$$$, $$$2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9$$$.\" \n\n            That is for the second problem.\n\n            For the first problem, the fourth test case is the one with 6 ones, and the sample output is 4.\n\n            This suggests there might be a misunderstanding.\n\n            Let me read the first problem again: \n                \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n            This means: \n                Alice chooses an index i (0<=i<=n) and eats the first i candies (if she eats, she must eat from the left consecutively).\n                Bob chooses an index j (0<=j<=n) and eats the last j candies.\n\n            But they cannot overlap: so i + j <= n, and the candies Alice eats are [0, i-1], and the candies Bob eats are [n-j, n-1]. \n            And we require that these segments do not overlap: i <= n-j.\n\n            And the condition: the sum of weights of Alice's candies = sum of weights of Bob's candies.\n\n            We want to maximize i+j.\n\n            For the fourth test case: \n                n=6, [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n                We can choose i=3, j=3: then Alice's sum=3, Bob's sum=3, and they don't overlap because 3<=6-3=3 -> valid. total=6.\n\n                We can also choose i=0 and j=0: total=0.\n                i=1, j=1: total=2.\n                i=2, j=2: total=4.\n\n            So the maximum is 6.\n\n            Therefore, the sample output should be 6.\n\n            But the problem says the output for the fourth test case is 4.\n\n            Unless the sample input for the fourth test case is not [1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n\n            The input: \n                \"6\n                 1 1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n            and the output: \n                4\n\n            This is a contradiction.\n\n            I suspect the sample input for the fourth test case is not six ones, but something else.\n\n            The problem says: \n                \"6\n                 1 1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n            and then the output is 4.\n\n            But in the known problem (Codeforces 1669F) the sample input: \n                \"6\n                 2 1 4 2 4 1\" -> output 6\n\n            and the sample input: \n                \"3\n                 10 20 10\" -> output 2\n\n            and: \n                \"5\n                 1 2 3 4 5\" -> output 0\n\n            and then the fourth: \n                \"6\n                 1 1 1 1 1 1\" -> output 6\n\n            So the sample output for the first program should be:\n                2\n                6\n                0\n                6\n\n            But the problem says:\n                2\n                6\n                0\n                4\n\n            This suggests the fourth test case is not [1,1,1,1,1,1] but maybe [1,1,1,1,1] (n=5) -> but the input says n=6.\n\n            Or the weights are not all ones? \n\n            The problem says: \"6\n            1 1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n            So it is six ones.\n\n            Given the contradiction, I will assume the intended answer for the fourth test case is 6.\n\n            But the problem says the output is 4.\n\n            This is very confusing.\n\n            Let me look at the provided code for program1.py:\n\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                l2=[]\n                while (p1-1<=p2):   # This condition: p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1\n                    if s1 == s2: \n                        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); \n                        s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s1 < s2: \n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    if s2 < s1: \n                        s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n                print(l2[-1])\n\n            For the fourth test case: n=6, l=[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n            p1=0, p2=5: \n                s1=0, s2=0 -> \n                    l2.append(0 + 6-1-5 = 0+0=0) -> then s1+=l[0]=1, p1=1.\n                then s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> then s2+=l[5]=1, p2=4.\n                then s1=1, s2=1 -> \n                    l2.append(1 + 6-1-4 = 1+1=2) -> then s1+=l[1]=1+1=2, p1=2.\n                then s1=2, s2=1 -> s2+=l[4]=1+1=2, p2=3.\n                then s1=2, s2=2 -> \n                    l2.append(2+6-1-3=2+2=4) -> then s1+=l[2]=2+1=3, p1=3.\n                then p1=3, p2=3: \n                    s1=3, s2=2 -> s2< s1 -> s2+=l[3]=2+1=3, p2=2.\n                then p1=3, p2=2 -> p1-1=2<=2 -> true.\n                then s1=3, s2=3 -> \n                    l2.append(3+6-1-2=3+3=6) -> then s1+=l[3] -> but p1=3, so l[3]=1 -> s1=4, p1=4.\n                then p1=4, p2=2: p1-1=3>2 -> break.\n                then print(l2[-1]=6) -> which is the last element.\n\n            So the code would output 6.\n\n            Therefore, the sample output of 4 is not from this code.\n\n            Given the provided code structure, we need to complete the missing part.\n\n            The missing part is in the condition \"if s1 < s2:\"\n\n            The code has:\n\n                if s1 == s2: ... \n                if s1 < s2: \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if s2 < s1: \n                    s2 += l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n            We need to do for s1 < s2: \n                we should add a candy from the left for Alice: \n                    s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n            So the missing code is: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n            But note: after we do that, we might have p1>p2+1? but the while condition is p1-1<=p2, so after we do p1+=1, we get p1-1 = p1_new - 1 = (p1+1)-1 = p1, and we require p1<=p2+1 -> but we are about to break the loop next time.\n\n            Also, we might have multiple conditions in one iteration? \n\n            The code has three if's. After we do the equality, we then check the next if's. \n\n            But we only want to do one move per iteration? \n\n            We can change to elif for the other conditions? \n\n            But the code does not use elif.\n\n            Example: \n                s1==s2: we do the equality and then we also do the next if's? \n\n            That would be a bug.\n\n            Let me simulate the provided code for the first test case: n=3, [10,20,10]\n\n            p1=0, p2=2: \n                s1=0, s2=0 -> \n                    l2.append(0+3-1-2=0) -> then s1+=l[0]=10, p1=1.\n                then we check: s1=10, s2=0 -> \n                    if s1==s2? no.\n                    if s1< s2? no.\n                    if s2<s1? yes -> s2+=l[2]=10, p2=1.\n                then we have p1=1, p2=1: p1-1=0<=1 -> true.\n                then s1=10, s2=10 -> \n                    l2.append(1+3-1-1=1+1=2) -> then s1+=l[1]=20, p1=2.\n                then we check: s1=30, s2=10 -> \n                    if s1==s2? no.\n                    if s1< s2? no.\n                    if s2<s1? yes -> s2+=l[1] -> but p2=1, so l[1]=20 -> s2=30, p2=0.\n                then p1=2, p2=0: p1-1=1<=0 -> false -> break.\n                then print(l2[-1]=2) -> correct.\n\n            But note: after the equality at (p1=1, p2=1), we did both the equality block and then the block for s2<s1 in the same iteration.\n\n            That means we did two moves in one iteration? \n\n            We record the equality and then we extend both? \n\n            But that might be intended.\n\n            However, in the fourth test case we got 6, which is correct.\n\n            So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n                if s1 < s2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n\n            But note: we must be cautious of the index: p1 might be out of bounds? but the while condition ensures p1-1<=p2, and p1 is at most p2+1. When p1 is p2+1, we can still do the equality check? but then we do s1+=l[p1] -> p1 would be p2+1, which is within [0, n-1] as long as p2+1 < n? \n\n            But p2 starts at n-1, and p1 starts at 0, and p1 increases and p2 decreases. The condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that when we access l[p1], p1 is at most p2+1, and since p2>=0, p1 is at most n-1+1 = n -> but p1 is at most n? and the list l has size n, so index p1 might be n -> out of bounds.\n\n            Example: n=1: \n                p1=0, p2=0: \n                    s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 + (1-1-0)=0? -> then s1+=l[0] -> p1=1.\n                    then p1=1, p2=0: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n                    then s1 = l[0], s2=0 -> then we do the if s1>s2 -> s2+=l[0] -> but p2=0 -> then p2 becomes -1.\n                    then next: p1=1, p2=-1: p1-1=0<=-1 -> false -> break.\n                then print(l2[-1]=0) -> but for n=1, the answer should be 0.\n\n            But when p1=1, we try to access l[p1] in the future? \n\n            In the equality condition, we did s1+=l[p1] when p1=0, then p1 becomes 1. Then in the next iteration, if we have s1==s2, we would do l2.append(...) and then s1+=l[1] -> which is out of bounds.\n\n            So we need to guard against that.\n\n            The condition in the while: p1-1<=p2 -> which means p1<=p2+1.\n\n            When p1=p2+1, we are about to have the two segments meet. \n            After we do an equality check and then do p1+=1, then p1 becomes p2+2, and then we break the loop.\n\n            But when we do the equality check, we access l[p1] with p1=p2+1? \n            That is valid as long as p1 < n? \n\n            In the while condition, p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1, and p2 is at least -1? \n\n            We can change the while condition to: while p1 <= p2+1 and p1 < n and p2>=0? \n\n            But the provided code does not have that.\n\n            Alternatively, in the equality condition, we are about to do: s1+=l[p1] and p1+=1. \n            But if p1 is already n, then we cannot do that.\n\n            So we should only do that if p1 < n? \n\n            But the condition p1-1<=p2 and p1<=p2+1, and p2>=0, then p1 is at most p2+1. And p2 is at least 0, so p1 is at most n-1+1 = n. \n            When p1 = n, then p2 = n-1, and then we do the equality: \n                l2.append(n + n-1 - (n-1)) = n + 0 = n.\n                then s1 += l[n] -> out of bounds.\n\n            So we need to break after the equality if p1>=n.\n\n            But the while condition: p1-1<=p2 -> if p1=n, then n-1<=p2 -> but p2 is at most n-1, so n-1<=n-1 -> true.\n\n            Therefore, we must not do the equality if p1>=n? \n\n            Actually, in the equality condition, we are going to do: s1+=l[p1] and p1+=1. This requires p1 < n.\n\n            So we should only do that if p1 < n.\n\n            But the problem says the sum of n over test cases is at most 200000, so we can afford to check.\n\n            Alternatively, we can change the order: \n                if s1==s2 and p1 <= p2: \n                    # then we can extend Alice? but the code in the note does extend unconditionally.\n\n            Given the sample test cases work with the code as written for the ones we have, and the only issue is the fourth test case which we resolved to 6, we will assume the provided code structure is as given.\n\n            The missing part is for s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n            But note: after we do this, we might have p1 > p2+1, but the while condition is checked at the beginning of the loop.\n\n            So the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n            And for program2.py missing part for n%4==2:\n\n                print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n            But note: in program2.py, the code for n%4==2 is in an elif, and then we have to print and then do a print(sep='') at the end.\n\n            However, the sample output for the second problem for n=10 is (3,5,1,1) in the note, but we are outputting (1,7,1,1). \n\n            But the problem says \"output any\", so it is acceptable.\n\n            But the sample provided in the code for n%4==1 and n%4==3 use the variable m, so we do the same.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n            And for program2.py:\n                print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\n            However, note the code in program2.py for n%4==2 is currently:\n\n                elif n%4==2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We need to replace the TODO with the print.\n\n            But the code after the if-elif-else has a print(sep='') -> which is not needed because we use end=' ' in the print. \n            And then we do a print(sep='') -> which will print an empty string? \n\n            Actually, the last print in the loop: \n                print(sep='')\n\n            This is equivalent to print(end='\\n')? because the default end is '\\n'. \n\n            But we are printing the four numbers with end=' ' -> so we get \"1 7 1 1 \" for n=10, and then a newline from the last print.\n\n            That is: \n                for each test case: \n                    we print the four numbers with a space at the end, and then we print (sep='') which is a newline.\n\n            But we want each test case on a new line.\n\n            The sample output format: \"For each test case output 4 positive integers\"\n\n            It doesn't specify newline, but the sample output in the note is printed one per line.\n\n            The current code for the other cases: \n                if n%4==0: \n                    print(m,m,m,m,end=' ')\n                elif n%4==1:\n                    print(m,2*m,m,1,end=' ')\n                elif n%4==2:\n                    # TODO\n                else:\n                    print(2,4*m-2,2,1,end=' ')\n                print(sep='')\n\n            The last print(sep='') will output a newline because the default end is '\\n'. And the previous print uses end=' ' so it does not output a newline.\n\n            So the output for a test case will be: \n                [number] [space] [number] [space] [number] [space] [number] [space] \n                then a newline.\n\n            That is: \"1 7 1 1 \\n\" for n=10.\n\n            That is acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n            program2: \"print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n\n            But note: in program1, the code is in an if block, so we need to indent.\n\n            However, the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n            For program1, the missing code is the block for \"if s1 < s2:\". \n\n            The existing code has:\n\n                if s1 == s2: ... \n                if s1 < s2: \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if s2 < s1: ... \n\n            We need to replace the TODO with two lines? \n\n            But we can write in one line? \n\n            We can do: \n                s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n            But it's two statements.\n\n            We can write two lines.\n\n            But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n            We output the two lines.\n\n            For program2, we output one line.\n\n            In JSON format.\n\n            Example: \n                {\"program1\": \"s1 += l[p1]\\np1 += 1\", \"program2\": \"print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\"}\n\n            But note: in program1, the existing code after the TODO is the next if, so we must not break the structure.\n\n            We are only replacing the TODO part.\n\n            Let me write the code for program1:\n\n                if s1 < s2: \n                    [missing code]\n\n            So the missing code is two lines:\n\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n            But we must indent.\n\n            In the output, we output the code as a string with newline for the two lines.\n\n            Similarly, for program2, the missing code is one line.\n\n            However, in program2, the TODO is in a comment in an elif block, and we replace the comment with a print statement.\n\n            So we output:\n\n            program1: \"    s1 += l[p1]\\n    p1 += 1\"\n            or without the extra indent? \n\n            The existing code has:\n\n                if s1 < s2: \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the comment with:\n\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n\n            So we need to indent each line by the same amount as the comment.\n\n            But the problem does not specify the indentation level. \n\n            Since the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent, we will use 4 spaces for each line.\n\n            But the TODO is already indented. We just need to put the two lines at the same indentation level.\n\n            Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? \n\n            The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n            We output:\n\n                for program1: \n                    \"s1 += l[p1]\\np1 += 1\"\n\n                but then when inserted, it will be at the same indentation level as the TODO comment.\n\n            But the TODO comment is at one level of indentation. We need to indent the two lines by one level.\n\n            How many spaces? The existing code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\n            We can output:\n\n                \"    s1 += l[p1]\\n    p1 += 1\"\n\n            But the existing code might use 4 spaces for the if block.\n\n            Let me see: \n                if s1 < s2: \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            The TODO line is indented by 4 spaces.\n\n            So we output two lines, each indented by 4 spaces.\n\n            But the problem does not specify, but to be safe, we output with 4 spaces.\n\n            Alternatively, we can output without extra spaces and assume the existing indentation is there.\n\n            The missing code is the body of the if, so we output the body.\n\n            In Python, the body must be indented. The existing code has the comment indented, so we replace the comment with our two lines, keeping the same indent.\n\n            Therefore, we output the two lines with the same indent as the comment would have.\n\n            But the problem does not show the exact whitespace of the TODO line.\n\n            We will assume 4 spaces.\n\n            For program2, the missing code is one line: \n                \"print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n\n            But note: the variable m is defined as m = n//4.\n\n            And we are in the block: \n                elif n%4==2:\n                    [missing]\n\n            So we output that line.\n\n            However, the sample for n=6: \n                m = 6//4 = 1\n                then we print: 1, 4*1-1=3, 1, 1 -> \"1 3 1 1\"\n\n            And 1+3+1+1=6, and gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n            Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"    s1 += l[p1]\\n    p1 += 1\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n            }\n\n            But wait: in program1, the existing code has:\n\n                if s1 == s2: ... \n                if s1 < s2: \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if s2 < s1: ... \n\n            After we replace the TODO, it becomes:\n\n                if s1 == s2: ... \n                if s1 < s2: \n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                if s2 < s1: ... \n\n            This is valid.\n\n            However, note that after we do the if s1 < s2 block, we then check the next if. That is, we might do two blocks in one iteration? \n\n            But that is the structure of the provided code.\n\n            We'll output accordingly.\n\n            Let me test program1 with the first test case: n=3, [10,20,10]\n\n            We'll simulate with the completed code.\n\n            p1=0, p2=2, s1=0, s2=0, l2=[]\n            while p1-1<=p2: 0-1<=2 -> true.\n                s1==s2: true -> \n                    l2.append(0+3-1-2=0) -> l2=[0]\n                    s1 += l[0]=10, p1=1.\n                then check: s1=10, s2=0 -> \n                    if s1==s2? no.\n                    if s1< s2? no.\n                    if s2<s1: true -> s2+=l[2]=10, p2=1.\n                next iteration: p1=1, p2=1: 0<=1 -> true.\n                s1=10, s2=10 -> \n                    l2.append(1+3-1-1=2) -> l2=[0,2]\n                    s1+=l[1]=20, p1=2.\n                then check: s1=30, s2=10 -> \n                    if s1==s2? no.\n                    if s1< s2? no.\n                    if s2<s1: true -> s2+=l[1]=20, p2=0.\n                next: p1=2, p2=0: 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n                then print(l2[-1]=2) -> correct.\n\n            So it works.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"    s1 += l[p1]\\n    p1 += 1\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(1, 4*m-1, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n            }\n\n            But note: in program2, the code for n%4==2 is:\n\n                elif n%4==2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO with the print.\n\n            We output the print statement.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n            And \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n            So we output the two completions.\n\n            Let me write the JSON."
