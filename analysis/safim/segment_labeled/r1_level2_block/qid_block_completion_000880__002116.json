After checking with small values:\n\n  We have:\n    b[1][1] = a[1]   -> so if we let k=1: then we need C(1, 1-1)=C(1,0)=1 mod2=1 -> so a[1] is included? b[1][2] = a[1]^a[2] -> so k=1: C(1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1 mod2=1 -> a[2] included? and k=0: C(1,2-0)=C(1,2)=0 mod2=0 -> not included? But wait, the indices: we have a[1] at column1 and a[2] at column2. Actually, we can write:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k = j-i}^{j} ??? But note: the recurrence is additive and we can use the concept of the Gray code matrix. Alternatively, we can use the following known identity:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k=0}^{i} a[j-k]   if we had a different recurrence? But our recurrence is:\n\n  b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] ^ b[i-1][j]",

So either the example is not following this formula, or the formula is different. Let me compute from the matrix for i=1, n=3: \n        b[1][3] = 0. According to the formula: \n        b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i} a[n-k] \n        for i=1: subsets of 1: k=0 and k=1. a[3-0]=a[3]=3, a[3-1]=a[2]=2, so 3^2=1, but we have 0.

But then for the example: \n        n=3, given_list = [0,2,1]\n        i=0: \n            j=1: (1 has the 0-th bit) -> given_list[1] ^= given_list[0] -> given_list[1]=2^0=2\n            j=3: not present because j in [0,2] (0-indexed indices0,1,2) -> j=2: (2 in binary is 10, has the 0-th bit? -> no) \n        i=1: \n            j=2: (2 has the 1-th bit) -> given_list[2] ^= given_list[0] ( because 2 - (1<<1)=0) -> given_list[2]=1^0=1 then output reversed(given_list) = [1,2,0] -> 1 2 0, but expected a=[1,2,3] -> output 1 2 3.\n\n  not matching. Another known solution in C++ for this problem (from a contest):\n\n      #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n      using namespace std;\n      int n;\n      int a[1000000];\n      int main() {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n          for (int i = 0; i < 19; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                  if (j >> i & 1) {\n                      a[j] ^= a[j - (1 << i)];\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n          for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n              printf(\"%d \", a[i]);\n          }\n      } And they output the array a in reverse. Test with the example: \n        n=3, a = [0,2,1]\n        i=0: j=1: (1 has bit0) -> a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1]=2^0=2 j=3: out of range (j<3: 0,1,2) -> j=2: (2 in binary: '10', has bit0? -> no) \n        i=1: \n            j=2: (2 has bit1) -> a[2] ^= a[0] -> a[2]=1^0=1\n        then output: reversed(a) = [1,2,0] -> 1 2 0. But the example says the array a should be [1,2,3] and then output is 1 2 3. So [1,2,0] is not [1,2,3]. However, the note says: \n        If we let a = [1,2,3] then the last column is [0,2,1] (which is the input). then the above code takes input [0,2,1] and outputs [1,2,0]. But the archaeology example says the last column is [0,2,1] and the array a is [1,2,3]. So the code outputs [1,2,0] and not [1,2,3].",

So to get a[1],a[2],a[3] as a0, a1, a2, we should output a0, a1, a2. the code outputs: a2, a1, a0. Therefore, if we want a0=1, a1=2, a2=3, then the code should have the array [1,2,3] and then reversed [3,2,1] and output 3 2 1, which is not 1 2 3. I see the orz. Given the complexity and the known solution in C++ ( which is the same as the provided code in python with the TODO being: a[j] ^= a[j - z] and then output reversed(a) ), and the example input [0,2,1] for n=3, the code in C++ outputs [1,2,0] and then reversed is [0,2,1] -> no, in the C++ code they output for i=n-1 downto 0: a[i] -> so if a = [0,2,1] becomes after the transform [0,2,1] -> then they output a[2]=1, a[1]=2, a[0]=0 -> 1 2 0. But the expected a is [1,2,3] -> output should be 1 2 3. However, the example says that the last column for a=[1,2,3] is [0,2,1] -> which is the input. and the code takes [0,2,1] and outputs [1,2,0] ( as the array a in the code is changed to [0,2,1] initially and then transformed to [0,2,1] becomes [0,2,1] -> then reversed [1,2,0] in the output). So the output [1,2,0] is the array a = [1,2,0] ( in the output order: first 1, then 2, then 0). then for a=[1,2,0] (so a1=1, a2=2, a3=0) we would get the last column [0,2,1]?

However, what if they share one letter and the other letter is also the same? Then they are the same string and we skip because of x!=y.\n\nSo the condition is correct. However, the current code then does:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to add the product of the counts of x and y. But note: the same string is not considered because of x!=y. However, the problem is that we are iterating over distinct keys in the counter. But if we have multiple occurrences of the same string, then pairs within the same string are not considered? Actually, the problem requires pairs of indices (i, j) with i<j. So if a string appears k times, then the pairs within that string are not counted because they are the same and do not differ in exactly one position? Actually, they are the same so they don't differ at all. So we don't count them.\n\nBut what about two different strings that are not in the same group? For example, \"ab\" and \"ac\": they share the first letter and differ in the second. So we count them. Similarly, \"ab\" and \"cb\": they share the second letter? Actually, no: they have different first letters and different second letters? Wait: \"ab\" and \"cb\": \n  first letter: 'a' vs 'c' -> different\n  second letter: 'b' vs 'b' -> same\nSo they differ in exactly one position.\n\nBut what about \"ab\" and \"cd\"? They share neither the first nor the second letter? Then we skip.\n\nSo the condition (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]) is exactly the condition that they share at least one letter? But note: if they share both, then they are the same and we skip. So the condition is: they share exactly one letter? Actually, no: they might share one letter and the other letter is different. So that is the condition we want.\n\nHowever, the current code will count each pair twice: once as (x,y) and once as (y,x). Then we do cnt//2. So we need to add the product of the counts.\n\nBut note: the same string might appear multiple times. For example, if we have two \"ab\" and three \"cb\", then the pairs between \"ab\" and \"cb\" are 2*3 = 6. And we will count this once when x=\"ab\", y=\"cb\" and then again when x=\"cb\", y=\"ab\". But then we do cnt//2, so that becomes (6+6)//2 = 6, which is correct? Actually, no: because in the inner loop we are iterating over the keys (which are distinct). So we are not iterating over each occurrence, but over distinct strings. Therefore, we are only counting each distinct pair of keys once? \n\nWait: the loop is:\n   for x in num:\n        for y in num:\n            if x!=y and (x[0] == y[0] or x[1] == y[1]):\n\nSo for each distinct string x and each distinct string y (with x != y) that satisfy the condition, we add num[x] * num[y]. Then we divide by 2 at the end.\n\nBut note: the pair (x,y) and (y,x) are the same and we are counting both? Actually, the condition is symmetric: if (x,y) satisfies, then (y,x) satisfies. And we are iterating over all pairs (x,y) with x and y distinct. So we are counting each unordered pair twice? Then we divide by 2.\n\nBut what about the same key? We skip because of x!=y. So the code is almost correct. However, we must be cautious: the condition (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]) might be satisfied by two different strings that share one letter. And we are counting the product of their frequencies.\n\nBut note: what if we have the same string? We skip because of x!=y. So we are only counting pairs of distinct strings.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n    cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\nBut wait: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 10^5, but the distinct strings might be up to 11*11=121 (since letters from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters). So the double loop is 121*121 which is acceptable.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is: \n    cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer may be large and we must use 64-bit integers. The Counter and the multiplication are integers and we are using //2. But in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we are safe.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given:\n  n\n  an array of n integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (which are b[1][n], b[2][n], ... , b[n][n])\n\nWe are to reconstruct the array a[1..n] (which is the first row of the matrix b, but note: b[0][i] = a[i] for 1<=i<=n).\n\nThe matrix b is defined by:\n  b[i][0] = 0 for 0<=i<=n\n  b[0][i] = a[i] for 1<=i<=n\n  b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] ^ b[i-1][j] for 1<=i,j<=n\n\nWe are given the last column: for i from 1 to n, we are given b[i][n].\n\nWe need to output any array a[1..n] that is consistent, or -1 if none exists.\n\nThe provided code does:\n  a = [*map(int, [*open(0)][1].split())]   # This reads the second line (the n integers) and stores in a list called a. But note: the problem says the first line is n, and the second line has n integers.\n\nThen:\n  for k in 0,1:\n      for i in range(19):   # 19 because 2^19 is about 500000, and 2^30 so we go bit by bit? 19 might be too low? Actually, 2^19 is 524288, which is > 500000, so 19 bits is enough for indices? But the numbers are up to 2^30, so we need 30 bits. However, the loop is for i in range(19) and then we use z=1<<i. 19 is not enough for 30 bits? Actually, 19 is for the indices? Or for the bits? Let me see: the inner loop j goes from 0 to len(a)-1. And we check j&z. This seems to be iterating over the bits of the index j? \n\nActually, the code is:\n\n  for k in 0,1:\n      for i in range(19):\n          z = 1 << i\n          for j in range(len(a)):\n              if j & z:\n                  # TODO\n\n  Then print(*reversed(a))\n\nWe note that the array a we are going to output is printed reversed.\n\nWhat is the idea?\n\nWe know the recurrence for the matrix b:\n\n  b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] ^ b[i-1][j]\n\nWe are given the last column: b[1][n], b[2][n], ..., b[n][n].\n\nWe are to recover the first row: a[1] = b[0][1], a[2] = b[0][2], ..., a[n] = b[0][n].\n\nNote: the recurrence can be expanded. In fact, the element b[i][j] can be expressed as the XOR of a certain set of elements from the first row and the first column (which is zeros). Specifically, it is known that:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k=0}^{i} binom(i, k) mod 2 ? ... \n\nActually, there is a pattern: the element b[i][j] is the XOR of the elements a[j] (if we consider the first row) but with a kind of Sierpinski triangle pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  b[i][j] = b[i-1][j] ^ b[i][j-1]\n           = b[i-1][j] ^ (b[i-1][j-1] ^ b[i][j-2])\n           = ... \n\nBut note the base conditions: the first column is zeros. So:\n\n  b[1][1] = b[1][0] ^ b[0][1] = 0 ^ a[1] = a[1]\n  b[1][2] = b[1][1] ^ b[0][2] = a[1] ^ a[2]\n  b[2][1] = b[2][0] ^ b[1][1] = 0 ^ a[1] = a[1]\n  b[2][2] = b[2][1] ^ b[1][2] = a[1] ^ (a[1]^a[2]) = a[2]\n\nIn fact, we can prove by induction that:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k=0}^{i} binom(j, k) mod 2 * a[j-k]   ??? \n\nBut actually, there is a known result: the transformation is the XOR convolution along the anti-diagonals? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that:\n\n  b[i][j] = b[i-1][j] ^ b[i][j-1]\n\nThis recurrence is similar to the one in the Gray code or the Sierpinski triangle. In fact, the element b[i][j] is the XOR of the elements on the top row from a[j] down to a[j-i] (if we consider the binomial coefficients mod 2) but only for the positions where the binomial coefficient is odd.\n\nSpecifically, we have:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k} a[k] for every k such that the binomial coefficient C(j, i) mod 2 is 1? \n\nActually, the recurrence is:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k=0}^{i} C(j, k) mod 2 * a[?] \n\nBut note the indices: the element a is in the top row at column j0. \n\nAfter research (or known result), we have:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k} a[k] for k from j down to j-i? \n\nBut let me compute for small i and j:\n\n  j=1: \n    i=1: b[1][1] = a[1]\n  j=2:\n    i=1: b[1][2] = a[1]^a[2]? \n    i=2: b[2][2] = a[2]   (because b[2][2] = b[2][1]^b[1][2] = a[1] ^ (a[1]^a[2]) = a[2])\n\n  j=3:\n    i=1: b[1][3] = b[1][2]^b[0][3] = (a[1]^a[2]) ^ a[3] = a[1]^a[2]^a[3]\n    i=2: b[2][3] = b[2][2]^b[1][3] = a[2] ^ (a[1]^a[2]^a[3]) = a[1]^a[3]\n    i=3: b[3][3] = b[3][2]^b[2][3] = (b[3][1]^b[2][2]) ... wait, let me do step by step:\n        b[3][1] = a[1] (because first column is zeros and then top row a[1] at column1)\n        b[3][2] = b[3][1]^b[2][2] = a[1]^a[2]\n        b[3][3] = b[3][2]^b[2][3] = (a[1]^a[2]) ^ (a[1]^a[3]) = a[2]^a[3]\n\nBut note: we are given the last column: j = n. So we are given b[1][n], b[2][n], ..., b[n][n].\n\nWe can express b[i][n] in terms of the array a. How?\n\nFrom the recurrence, we can write:\n\n  b[i][n] = XOR_{k} a[k] for k such that the binomial coefficient C(n, i) mod 2 is 1? \n\nActually, we can use the generating function in GF(2). The recurrence is linear. \n\nAlternatively, we note that the transformation from the top row (a[1..n]) to the last column (b[1..n][n]) is linear and can be represented by a matrix M of size n x n, where:\n\n  b[i][n] = M(i) * a\n\nand M(i) is a row vector.\n\nHow to compute M? \n\nWe can use the recurrence:\n\n  b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] ^ b[i-1][j]\n\nwith boundary conditions: \n  b[0][j] = a[j] for j>=1, and b[i][0]=0 for i>=0.\n\nWe are interested in b[i][n]. \n\nWe can also note that the transformation for the entire matrix is the same as the Gray code order? \n\nBut there is a known result: the element b[i][j] is the XOR-sum of the elements a[j], a[j-1], ... over the positions where the bitmask of the difference in indices has the subset property? \n\nActually, we can use the following:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k=0}^{j} C(i, j-k) mod 2 * a[k]   ??? \n\nBut note: we have zeros in the first column. \n\nAfter checking with small values:\n\n  We have:\n    b[1][1] = a[1]   -> so if we let k=1: then we need C(1, 1-1)=C(1,0)=1 mod2=1 -> so a[1] is included? \n\n  b[1][2] = a[1]^a[2] -> so k=1: C(1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1 mod2=1 -> a[2] included? and k=0: C(1,2-0)=C(1,2)=0 mod2=0 -> not included? \n\nBut wait, the indices: we have a[1] at column1 and a[2] at column2. \n\nActually, we can write:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k = j-i}^{j} ??? \n\nBut note: the recurrence is additive and we can use the concept of the Gray code matrix. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the following known identity:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k=0}^{i} a[j-k]   if we had a different recurrence? \n\nBut our recurrence is:\n\n  b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] ^ b[i-1][j]\n\nThis is the same as the recurrence for the number of paths in a grid? \n\nBut note: the XOR operation is linear. We can write:\n\n  Let F(i,j) = b[i][j]. Then:\n    F(i,j) = F(i, j-1) + F(i-1, j)   in GF(2) (with XOR as addition).\n\nThis is the same as the binomial coefficients mod 2? \n\nIn fact, the value F(i,j) is the XOR over all a[k] for which the binomial coefficient C(i+j, i) mod 2 is 1? But note the indices: the top row is at i=0, so the element a[j] is at (0,j). The element at (i,j) is the XOR of the a[k] for k from j down to j-i? \n\nActually, we can use the following:\n\n  F(i,j) = XOR_{k=0}^{i} C(i, k) * a[j-k]   (in GF(2))? \n\nBut in GF(2), multiplication is AND and addition is XOR. And the binomial coefficients mod 2 are 1 only for the subsets of the bits? \n\nBut we have:\n\n  F(i,j) = F(i, j-1) ^ F(i-1, j)\n\nThis recurrence is the same as the one for the combinatorial XOR transform. \n\nIn fact, we can write:\n\n  F(i,j) = XOR_{k} a[j-k] * [C(i, k) mod 2]\n\nBut the binomial coefficients mod 2 are given by the bits of k being a subset of the bits of i? \n\nActually, Lucas' theorem tells us that C(i, k) mod 2 is 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is a subset of that of i.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  b[i][j] = XOR_{k: k is a subset of i (in binary)} a[j - k]\n\nBut note: we must have j-k >= 1? and k<=i? \n\nHowever, in our case, the top row is at j=1..n, and the matrix is built for i>=0 and j>=0. \n\nBut we are given j = n (fixed) and i from 1 to n. So:\n\n  b[i][n] = XOR_{k: k is a subset of i} a[n - k]\n\nBut note: the indices of a start at 1. So a is defined for indices 1..n. Therefore, we require n-k to be between 1 and n. So k must be between 0 and n-1.\n\nBut k is a subset of i (in the binary representation). \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n  For each i from 1 to n:\n      b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i, and 0<=k<=min(i, n-1)} a[n - k]\n\nBut note: k can be 0? then a[n-0] = a[n]. And k can be any subset of the bits of i.\n\nAlternatively, we can reindex: let d = n - j, then we have:\n\n  b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i} a[n - k]   for k such that n-k is in [1, n] -> so k in [0, n-1].\n\nBut note: k must be at most n-1. Since i<=n, k (which is a subset of i) is at most i, which is <=n, but we require k<=n-1. So if k=n, then we skip? But k is a subset of i and i<=n, so k<=n. However, if k=n, then we require a[0] which is not defined. So we must have k<=n-1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  Let c = [a[n], a[n-1], ..., a[1]]   (reversed a)\n\nThen:\n\n  b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i, and k < n} c[k]   [because a[n-k] = c[k] if we let c[k] = a[n-k]]\n\nBut note: k must be in the range [0, n-1]. And if k>=n, we skip. But since i<=n, k (a subset of i) is at most n, but we skip k>=n? Actually, k is at most i (which is <=n) but we require k<n. So for k=n, we skip.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n  b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i, k < n} c[k]\n\nThis is the fast Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform (subset XOR transform) of the array c, but only for the indices that are subsets? Actually, it is the standard subset-sum in GF(2) (also called the M\u00f6bius transform for the subset lattice).\n\nBut note: the problem says: we are given the array b_i = b[i][n] for i=1..n, and we want to recover c (which is the reversed a). \n\nSo we have:\n\n  b_i = (c transformed by the subset XOR transform) at index i, for i in [1, n].\n\nBut note: the transform is defined for the entire vector of length N (a power of two) but we have n up to 500000. However, we can do the standard fast M\u00f6bius transform (also called the sum over subsets) in O(N log N) for N being the next power of two? But note: the array c has length n, and we are only interested in the first n elements of the transform? \n\nBut the provided code does:\n\n  for k in 0,1:\n      for i in range(19):\n          z = 1 << i\n          for j in range(len(a)):\n              if j & z:\n                  # TODO\n\n  Then print(*reversed(a))\n\nThis is reminiscent of the fast Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform for the subset XOR (actually, the standard algorithm for the M\u00f6bius transform for the subset sum in GF(2) is the same as the fast zeta transform for the OR operation? Actually, the transform we have is:\n\n  F(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} c[T]\n\nThis is the zeta transform for the OR semilattice. And the inverse transform is:\n\n  c(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} mu(0, T) * F(T)   ?\n\nBut actually, the inverse transform for the subset sum in GF(2) is the same as the forward transform? Because the transform is involutory? \n\nWait, the transform:\n\n  F(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} c[T]\n\nThen the inverse is:\n\n  c(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} F(T) * mu(T, S)   ?\n\nBut in GF(2), the M\u00f6bius function for the subset lattice is: mu(T, S) = (-1)^(|S|-|T|) mod 2? But then we are in GF(2), so (-1) is 1. And then we have:\n\n  c(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} F(T)   ??? \n\nBut that is the same as F(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} c(T). Then if we do the same transform again, we get:\n\n  F'(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} F(T) = XOR_{T subset of S} (XOR_{U subset of T} c[U]) = XOR_{U} c[U] * (number of T such that U subset of T subset of S, mod2)\n\nThe number of T is 2^(|S\\U|). This is 0 mod2 if |S\\U|>=1? Actually, no: we are in GF(2). The number of subsets is even if |S\\U|>=1? Then the term c[U] would appear an even number of times and cancel, unless |S\\U|=0, i.e., U=S. So we get c[S]. \n\nTherefore, the transform is its own inverse? \n\nBut wait: the standard fast M\u00f6bius transform for the subset sum (zeta transform) is:\n\n  F(S) = sum_{T subset of S} c[T]   (in integers)\n\nand the inverse uses the M\u00f6bius function. But in GF(2), the sum becomes XOR. And the M\u00f6bius function for the subset lattice in GF(2) is: \n\n  mu(T, S) = 1 if S\\T is empty? Actually, no: the M\u00f6bius function for the subset lattice is mu(T,S)=(-1)^(|S|-|T|) for T subset of S. Then in GF(2), if |S|-|T| is even, then 1; if odd, then -1 mod2 is 1? Because -1 mod2 = 1. So in GF(2), the M\u00f6bius function is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the inverse transform is:\n\n  c(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} F(T)\n\nBut that is the same as the forward transform! So the transform is its own inverse.\n\nTherefore, to recover c from F (which is the array b_i for i=0..n-1? note: we have indices from 1 to n) we can apply the same transform to the array F.\n\nBut note: our array F (the given b_i) is defined for i from 1 to n. However, the transform requires the entire array for indices from 0 to N-1 (for N a power of two). We have:\n\n  Let F[0] = ? \n  We are not given F[0] = b[0][n]. But note: the problem says we are given b[1][n] to b[n][n]. \n\nWhat is b[0][n]? \n  By definition: b[0][n] = a[n] (from the rule: b[0][i] = a[i] for i>=1). \n\nBut we don't know a[n] yet. \n\nAlternatively, note the transform:\n\n  F(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} c[T]\n\nFor S=0: \n  F(0) = c[0]   (only the empty set)\n\nBut what is c[0]? \n  We defined c[k] = a[n-k]. So for k=0, c[0]=a[n]. \n\nBut we are not given F(0). However, the problem does not require the entire vector of F for all indices, only for indices 1..n.\n\nBut note: the transform is linear. We can set:\n\n  Let F[0] = ?\n\nWe don't know F[0]. However, we can consider the entire vector of length N (a power of two >= n) for the indices 0 to N-1. We set:\n  For i=0: F[0] = c[0] = a[n]   -> but we don't know a[n] yet.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are to output any array a that is consistent. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the transform for the entire vector of length N (with N>=n) is:\n\n  F(i) = XOR_{j subset of i} c[j]   for i in [0, N-1]\n\nWe are given F(i) for i in [1, n]. We don't know F(0) and we don't know F(i) for i>n. \n\nBut we can set:\n  For i>n, we don't care. And for i=0, we can set F(0) arbitrarily? \n\nBut the transform is linear and we can recover c from the given F(1..n) and an arbitrary F(0)? \n\nHowever, the problem says: if such an array does not exist, output -1. \n\nBut note: the transform is linear and the system is:\n\n  F(i) = XOR_{j subset of i} c[j]   for i=1..n\n\nWe can solve for c by the inverse transform (which is the same as the forward transform) if we set F(0)=? and F(i)=0 for i>n? \n\nBut we don't know F(0). However, we can do:\n\n  Let F[0] = x (unknown). Then we do the inverse transform (which is the same as the forward transform) and we get an array c. Then we require that for i>n, F(i)=0? But we are not given them. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the array c is defined only for indices 0 to n-1 (because k in [0, n-1]). So for any set S that has a bit beyond the bits in [0, n-1], we don't have c[S] defined? Actually, we set c[S]=0 for S>=n? \n\nBut the problem: the array c has length n: indices 0 to n-1. So we can set:\n\n  We consider an array of length N (a power of two and N>=n) for the transform. We set:\n      c[i] = 0 for i>=n   (because we don't have a[n-i] for i>=n? actually, i in [0, n-1] for c, so for i>=n, we set c[i]=0).\n\n  Then the transform becomes:\n      F(i) = XOR_{j subset of i, j < n} c[j]   for all i.\n\n  And we are given F(i) for i in [1, n]. We also need F(0) = c[0] (which is a[n]) but we don't know it.\n\nBut note: the transform is linear and we can do:\n\n  Step 1: set up an array F of length N (N = 1<<19, which is 2^19 = 524288, which is > 500000) as follows:\n      F[0] = ?   (unknown)\n      For i from 1 to n: F[i] = given b[i][n]   (which is the given value for the i-th element in the input)\n      For i from n+1 to N-1: F[i] = 0   (because we are not given, and we assume they are 0? but the problem doesn't say)\n\n  Then we do the inverse transform (which is the same as the forward transform) to get an array c of length N.\n\n  Then we set:\n      a[n] = c[0]\n      a[n-1] = c[1]\n      ... \n      a[1] = c[n-1]\n\n  But note: we defined c[i] = a[n-i]. So:\n      a[1] = c[n-1]? \n      a[2] = c[n-2]?\n      ... \n      a[n] = c[0]\n\n  Then we output a[1..n] in that order? But the code does: print(*reversed(a))\n\n  Actually, the current code has: \n        a = [*map(int, [*open(0)][1].split())]   # this reads the given b[1][n] to b[n][n] into a list called a.\n\n  Then after processing, it prints: print(*reversed(a))\n\n  So if we want the output to be the array a (which is the original a[1..n]), then we must have:\n\n        After our transform, the array we computed (c) is stored in the array that we then reverse and print? \n\n  But note: the code reads the given b's into a. Then we are going to do the transform and then reverse and print. \n\n  How do we use the transform to recover c? \n\n  We have: \n        F(i) = XOR_{j subset of i} c[j]   for i in [0, N-1]\n\n  We are given F(i) for i=1..n. We don't know F(0). \n\n  But note: the transform is linear and we can set F(0) arbitrarily? However, we can compute F(0) from the system? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do the transform without F(0) and then set F(0) as the XOR of the c[j] for j=0? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      Let F[0] = 0   (temporarily) and then do the forward transform (which is the inverse) to get an array c. Then we have:\n\n          F(i) = XOR_{j subset of i} c[j]   for all i.\n\n      But we know that the true F(0) should be c[0]. So we have set F(0)=0, but the true F(0) is c[0]. Therefore, we must adjust: \n\n          The true F is: F_true(i) = F_current(i) if i>0, and F_true(0)=c[0]. \n\n      But we don't know c[0] until we do the transform? \n\n  This is circular.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the given values to solve for c. \n\nBut note: the transform is linear and the system is:\n\n  For i in [1, n]:\n      given[i] = XOR_{j subset of i} c[j]\n\n  And we also have:\n      F(0) = c[0]\n\n  We can do:\n\n      Let F = array of length N, initially zeros.\n      Set F[0] = x (unknown) and for i=1..n: F[i] = given[i-1]? (because the given array a in the code is the list of b[1][n] to b[n][n])\n\n  But the given array is stored in a[0] to a[n-1] (0-indexed) for the n values.\n\n  Then we do the forward transform (which is the inverse) to get c. Then we have:\n\n      c[i] = XOR_{j subset of i} F[j]   for all i.\n\n  But we require that for i>=n, c[i]=0. \n\n  So we have:\n\n      For i>=n: \n          0 = XOR_{j subset of i} F[j]\n\n      And for i in [0, n-1]:\n          c[i] = XOR_{j subset of i} F[j]\n\n  And we also have the given values for i in [1, n] (which correspond to F[i] for i in [1, n]) and F[0]=x.\n\n  We can use the condition for i>=n to solve for x. \n\n  Specifically, consider i = N-1? But that might be too big. Instead, consider i = n, n+1, ... up to N-1. \n\n  But note: the condition must hold for every i>=n: \n        XOR_{j subset of i} F[j] = 0.\n\n  How many equations? Many. But we only have one unknown: x=F[0]. \n\n  We can take one equation: for example, take i = the next power of two minus one? \n\n  But note: the problem does not require a particular solution. We can set F[0] arbitrarily and then adjust? \n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the system is consistent if and only if the given vector F[1..n] is in the image of the transform. \n\n  But the problem says: output any array a, or -1 if none exists.\n\n  How to do it in the code?\n\n  The provided code does two passes (k in 0,1) and 19 bits. The inner loop is:\n\n        for j in range(len(a)):\n            if j & z:\n                # TODO\n\n  This is the standard in-place fast Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform for the subset OR (zeta transform). Specifically, the code for the transform is:\n\n        for i in range(19):\n            z = 1 << i\n            for j in range(N):\n                if j has the i-th bit? then we update.\n\n  The standard code for the forward transform (zeta transform for OR) in GF(2) is:\n\n        for i in range(bits):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if j has the i-th bit:\n                    F[j] = F[j] XOR F[j ^ (1<<i)]\n\n  But wait, that is the inverse? Actually, the forward transform (from c to F) is:\n\n        F = c initially.\n        for i in range(bits):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if j has the i-th bit:\n                    F[j] = F[j] XOR F[j ^ (1<<i)]\n\n  Then F becomes the transform: F(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} c[T].\n\n  And the inverse transform is the same? \n\n  But note: the inverse transform is:\n\n        c = F initially.\n        for i in range(bits):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if j has the i-th bit:\n                    c[j] = c[j] XOR c[j ^ (1<<i)]\n\n  Then c becomes the original c? \n\n  Actually, no: the forward transform is:\n\n        F = c\n        for i in range(bits):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if j has the i-th bit:\n                    F[j] = F[j] XOR F[j ^ (1<<i)]\n\n  This computes F(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} c[T]. \n\n  To invert, we do:\n\n        c = F\n        for i in range(bits):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if j has the i-th bit:\n                    c[j] = c[j] XOR c[j ^ (1<<i)]\n\n  Then we get back c? \n\n  But wait, let's try with a small example: N=2, bits=1.\n\n  c = [c0, c1]\n\n  Forward transform:\n      Initially F = [c0, c1]\n      i=0: z=1<<0=1.\n        j=0: skip (because 0 doesn't have bit0)\n        j=1: has bit0 -> F[1] = F[1] XOR F[0] = c1 XOR c0.\n      So F becomes [c0, c0^c1].\n\n  Now do the same transform on F:\n      Initially c = [c0, c0^c1]\n      j=1: has bit0 -> c[1] = c[1] XOR c[0] = (c0^c1) XOR c0 = c1.\n      Then we get [c0, c1] -> the original c.\n\n  So the same transform inverts it.\n\n  Therefore, the provided code is doing the inverse transform? \n\n  But the code has:\n\n        for k in 0,1:\n            for i in range(19):\n                z = 1 << i\n                for j in range(len(a)):\n                    if j & z:\n                        # TODO\n\n  And then it prints reversed(a). \n\n  And it does two passes (k in 0,1). Why two passes? \n\n  One possibility: the first pass is the forward transform and the second pass is the inverse? \n\n  But the problem: we are given F (the b_i's) and we want to recover c. We can do one transform (the inverse) to get c. \n\n  However, we don't know F[0]. \n\n  The idea in the code: \n\n      We are going to do two passes of the same transform? \n\n  But note: the transform is its own inverse. So two passes would be the identity? \n\n  Why then two passes?\n\n  Another possibility: the first pass is to do the transform on the given array (which is F) to get an intermediate array, and then we do something else.\n\n  But the code does the same thing in both passes.\n\n  The TODO is inside the if: if j has the i-th bit, then do something.\n\n  The standard transform update is:\n\n        a[j] = a[j] XOR a[j ^ z]\n\n  So we might do:\n\n        a[j] ^= a[j ^ z]\n\n  But then we do this for 19 bits and then twice.\n\n  If we do it twice, then it would be the identity? \n\n  Let me try with two bits: \n\n      Initially: a = [A, B, C, D]  (indices 0,1,2,3)\n\n      First pass (i=0, z=1):\n          j=1: a[1] ^= a[0]   -> a[1] = B^A\n          j=2: skip (because we are iterating j in [0,3] and for j=2: 2&1=0 -> skip)\n          j=3: a[3] ^= a[2]   -> a[3] = D^C\n\n      Then i=1, z=2:\n          j=2: a[2] ^= a[0]   -> a[2] = C^A\n          j=3: a[3] ^= a[1]   -> a[3] = (D^C) ^ (B^A) = D^C^B^A\n\n      Then we do the second pass (k=1) with the same 19 bits? \n\n      Then i=0, z=1:\n          j=1: a[1] ^= a[0]   -> a[1] = (B^A) ^ A = B\n          j=3: a[3] ^= a[2]   -> a[3] = (D^C^B^A) ^ (C^A) = D^B\n      Then i=1, z=2:\n          j=2: a[2] ^= a[0]   -> a[2] = (C^A) ^ A = C\n          j=3: a[3] ^= a[1]   -> a[3] = (D^B) ^ B = D\n\n      So we get back the original array? \n\n  Therefore, two passes of the transform (with the same bit order) is the identity.\n\n  So why two passes? \n\n  The only explanation is that the first pass is meant to be the forward transform and the second pass the inverse? But we saw that one transform inverts the other. \n\n  But wait: the first pass might be on the given array (which is F) to get an intermediate array, and then we do the second pass to get back? That would be identity and not useful.\n\n  Alternatively, the first pass might be to do the transform on the given array to get c, and then we do nothing in the second pass? \n\n  But then why two passes?\n\n  Another possibility: the first pass is for the forward transform (to get F from c) and then we do something else? \n\n  But we are given F and want c.\n\n  I think the intended solution is:\n\n      We have an array F of length N (which is at least n) and we set:\n          F[0] = 0   (we don't know it, so set to 0 for now)\n          F[1..n] = the given values\n          F[n+1..N-1] = 0\n\n      Then we do the inverse transform (which is the same as the forward transform) to get an array c. \n\n      Then we set F[0] = c[0]   (because by definition F[0] should be c[0])\n\n      Then we do the forward transform again to get the true F? \n\n      Then we compare the true F with the given F? \n\n  But the problem only requires to output a, not the entire F.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n      Let F be the given array for indices 1..n, and we set F[0] arbitrarily to 0.\n\n      Do the transform to get c.\n\n      Then set F0 = c[0] (which should be the true F[0]).\n\n      Then we set F[0] = F0.\n\n      Then do the transform again to get an updated c.\n\n      Then output c.\n\n  Why? \n\n      The first transform (with F[0]=0) gives an array c0. But the true c should be c0 plus the adjustment for the missing F0.\n\n      Specifically, the transform is linear. Let F0_true = c[0]. We initially set F[0]=0. The true F is F_true = F_current + (F0_true, 0,0,...,0). \n\n      Then the true c = transform(F_true) = transform(F_current) + transform( [F0_true,0,0,...] ).\n\n      What is transform of the vector that is F0_true at 0 and 0 elsewhere? \n          For any set S: \n              F_vector(S) = F0_true if 0 is a subset of S (which is always true) and also note that the only non-zero term is at j=0. \n              So F_vector(S) = F0_true for every S.\n\n      Therefore, the true c = c0 + [F0_true, F0_true, ..., F0_true] (a constant vector of F0_true).\n\n      But wait, the transform is in GF(2), so adding a constant vector of F0_true means: \n          c_true[i] = c0[i] XOR F0_true.\n\n      And we know F0_true = c_true[0] = c0[0] XOR F0_true.\n\n      So: F0_true = c0[0] XOR F0_true  => c0[0] = 0.\n\n      Then F0_true = 0 XOR F0_true = F0_true -> consistent.\n\n      And then c_true[0] = c0[0] XOR F0_true = 0 XOR F0_true = F0_true.\n\n      But we also have: c_true[0] = F0_true, so it matches.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Let F = [0, given[0], given[1], ..., given[n-1]] + zeros for the rest.\n          Do the transform to get c0.\n          Let F0_true = c0[0]   (which is the true F[0] = c_true[0])\n          Then the true c is: for each i, c_true[i] = c0[i] XOR F0_true.\n\n      But note: we defined c0 = transform(F_current). And the true c = transform(F_true) = transform(F_current) + transform([F0_true,0,0,...]) = c0 XOR [F0_true]*N.\n\n      So we do:\n\n          c_true = [ c0[i] XOR F0_true for i in range(N) ]\n\n      Then we set a from c_true: \n          a[i] = c_true[n-1-i] for i in range(n)   ? \n\n      But wait: we defined c[k] = a[n-k]. So:\n          a[1] = c_true[0]? \n          a[2] = c_true[1]?\n          ...\n          a[n] = c_true[n-1]\n\n      But then we output a[1..n] in the order: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]. \n\n      However, the code does: \n          print(*reversed(a))\n\n      And currently, the array a is the given b's. We are going to overwrite a? \n\n      The code reads the given b's into a. Then we are going to do the transform and then print reversed(a). \n\n      But we want to output the array a (the original a[1..n]). \n\n      So after we compute c_true (which has length N), we extract the first n elements: \n          a_output = [ c_true[i] for i in range(n) ]   # but then a_output[0] = c_true[0] = a[n], a_output[1]=c_true[1]=a[n-1], ... \n      Then we want to output: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] = a_output[n-1], a_output[n-2], ...? \n\n      Actually, we want:\n          a[1] = a_output[n-1]\n          a[2] = a_output[n-2]\n          ...\n          a[n] = a_output[0]\n\n      But the code does: \n          print(*reversed(a))\n\n      So if we set a = a_output, then reversed(a) = [a_output[n-1], a_output[n-2], ..., a_output[0]] = [a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]]\n\n      That is what we want.\n\n      Therefore, the plan is:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and the list of n integers (call it given_list) for b[1][n] to b[n][n].\n\n          Step 2: Let N = 1<<19 (or any power of two >= n)\n\n          Step 3: Create an array F of length N, initialized to 0.\n                   F[0] = 0\n                   For i in range(1, n+1): F[i] = given_list[i-1]   # because given_list[0] is b[1][n], which should be at index1.\n\n          But wait: the given_list has n elements: the first element is b1, which is b[1][n]. We want F[1] = b[1][n], F[2]=b[2][n], ... , F[n]=b[n][n]. \n\n          Step 4: Do the forward transform (which is the same as the inverse) on F for 19 bits:\n\n                   for i in range(19):\n                       z = 1 << i\n                       for j in range(N):\n                           if j has the i-th bit (j & z):\n                               F[j] = F[j] XOR F[j^z]\n\n          Step 5: Let F0_true = F[0]   # because after the transform, F becomes c0? \n                   But wait: we did the forward transform on F (which was [0, given_list[0], given_list[1], ...]) and we got c0 = transform(F).\n\n          Step 6: Now, the true c_true is: for each j in [0, N-1]: c_true[j] = F[j] XOR F0_true.\n\n          Step 7: Then we set a = c_true[0:n]   (the first n elements)\n\n          Step 8: Then the code does: print(*reversed(a))\n\n          But note: the array a we are setting is of length n, and then we reverse it.\n\n          This will output: a[n-1], a[n-2], ... , a[0] -> which is c_true[n-1], c_true[n-2], ... , c_true[0]\n\n          But we want: \n                a[1] = c_true[n-1] \n                a[2] = c_true[n-2]\n                ...\n                a[n] = c_true[0]\n\n          However, by our definition: \n                c_true[k] = a[n-k]   -> so a[n-k] = c_true[k]\n\n          Therefore, a[1] = c_true[n-1] = a_output[0] (if we set a_output = c_true[0..n-1])? \n          But then when we reverse a_output, we get: \n                reversed(a_output) = [a_output[n-1], a_output[n-2], ... , a_output[0]] = [c_true[n-1], c_true[n-2], ... , c_true[0]]\n\n          And this equals [a[1], a[2], ... , a[n]]\n\n          So it matches.\n\n          However, note: the array a in the code currently is the given_list. We are going to overwrite it with a_output = c_true[0:n]?\n\n          The code currently has:\n\n                a = [*map(int, [*open(0)][1].split())]   # this is the given_list\n\n          Then we do the transform and then set a = [ F0_true XOR F[j] for j in range(n) ]? \n\n          But we need an array of length n, and we have F of length N. We only care about the first n elements of the transformed F (after step 4) and then we XOR with F0_true.\n\n          So after step 4, we have an array F of length N. Then we do:\n\n                base = F[0]   # this is F0_true\n                a = [ F[j] ^ base for j in range(n) ]\n\n          Then we print(*reversed(a))\n\n          But wait: the given_list might be of length n, but we are using an array F of length N. We only update the first n elements of a? \n\n          However, the problem says the total n is up to 500000, and we set N=1<<19 = 524288, which is >500000.\n\n          But the given_list has length n, and we set F[0..n] (with F[0]=0 and F[1..n] = given_list) and the rest zeros.\n\n          Then we do the transform for the entire F of length N.\n\n          Then we extract the first n elements of F, and then XOR with base.\n\n          Then set a to that list of length n.\n\n          Then print reversed(a).\n\n          But note: the transform is done in-place on F. We then use F[0] and F[0..n-1] to form a.\n\n          However, the transform uses indices up to N-1. \n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n  But is this consistent? \n\n  Let me test with the example: n=3, given b[1][3]=0, b[2][3]=2, b[3][3]=1.\n\n  The example says: if a = [1,2,3] then b[1][3]=0, b[2][3]=2, b[3][3]=1.\n\n  We want to recover a = [1,2,3].\n\n  Steps:\n\n      F[0]=0, F[1]=0, F[2]=2, F[3]=1, and the rest 0.\n\n      Do the transform for 19 bits? But we only need 2 bits (since n=3, N=4).\n\n      The transform for N=4:\n\n          i=0: z=1\n            j=1: F[1] ^= F[0] -> F[1]=0^0=0\n            j=3: F[3] ^= F[2] -> F[3]=1^2=3\n          i=1: z=2\n            j=2: F[2] ^= F[0] -> F[2]=2^0=2\n            j=3: F[3] ^= F[1] -> F[3]=3^0=3\n\n          So after the transform, F = [0,0,2,3]\n\n          Then base = F[0]=0.\n\n          Then a = [ F[0]^0, F[1]^0, F[2]^0] = [0,0,2]   -> then reversed(a) = [2,0,0] -> output: 2 0 0.\n\n          But expected a = [1,2,3] -> output should be 1 2 3.\n\n      This is not matching.\n\n  What went wrong?\n\n  We defined:\n\n        c_true[j] = F_after_transform[j] XOR base\n\n  and then a = [c_true[0], c_true[1], c_true[2]] = [0,0,2]\n\n  then reversed(a) = [2,0,0]\n\n  But we expected: \n        c_true[0] = a[3] = 3\n        c_true[1] = a[2] = 2\n        c_true[2] = a[1] = 1\n\n  So we should have a = [3,2,1] and then reversed(a) = [1,2,3].\n\n  How to get c_true[0]=3, c_true[1]=2, c_true[2]=1?\n\n  In the example, the true c_true should be [3,2,1] (because a[3]=3, a[2]=2, a[1]=1).\n\n  But we got F_after_transform = [0,0,2,3] for the entire F of length 4.\n\n  Then c_true = [0^0, 0^0, 2^0, 3^0] = [0,0,2,3] -> and we take the first 3: [0,0,2] -> not [3,2,1].\n\n  What is the issue? \n\n  We did the transform on F which was [0,0,2,1] (for indices0..3) and got [0,0,2,3]. \n\n  But the transform we did is the forward transform (which is the same as the inverse) and it is:\n\n        F(S) = XOR_{T subset of S} c0[T]\n\n  where c0 is the array we set (which is [0,0,2,1] for indices0..3).\n\n  But we want to recover c_true, the true c, which is [3,2,1] for indices0..2 (and index3 is not used).\n\n  How is [0,0,2,1] related to [3,2,1]? \n\n  We set F[0]=0, F[1]=0, F[2]=2, F[3]=1.\n\n  The transform we did is:\n\n        F(0) = c0[0] = 0\n        F(1) = c0[0]^c0[1] = 0^0=0\n        F(2) = c0[0]^c0[2] = 0^2=2\n        F(3) = c0[0]^c0[1]^c0[2]^c0[3] = 0^0^2^1=3\n\n  But the true F should be:\n\n        F_true(0) = c_true[0] = 3\n        F_true(1) = c_true[0]^c_true[1] = 3^2=1  -> but we have 0\n        ...\n\n  This indicates that our initial setting of F is not the given F, but we set F[0]=0 and then F[1..3] = given_list.\n\n  But the given_list is b[1][3], b[2][3], b[3][3] = [0,2,1] -> which should be F_true(1), F_true(2), F_true(3).\n\n  So we should have set:\n\n        F[1] = F_true(1) = 0\n        F[2] = F_true(2) = 2\n        F[3] = F_true(3) = 1\n\n  and F[0] = F_true(0) = ? (unknown) -> we set to 0.\n\n  Then after the transform, we got F = [0,0,2,3] for the entire array.\n\n  Then we set base = F[0] = 0, and then c_true = [0,0,2,3] (XOR 0) -> [0,0,2,3].\n\n  But the true c_true should be [3,2,1] for indices0..2.\n\n  How to get [3,2,1] from [0,0,2,3]? \n\n  We note that the true F_true(0) = 3 (which is c_true[0]=3).\n\n  We initially set F[0]=0, but it should be 3. \n\n  The difference is a vector: [3,0,0,0] (at index0: 3, elsewhere 0).\n\n  When we do the transform of this vector, we get: for every S, the transform is 3.\n\n  Therefore, the true c_true = c0 + [3,3,3,3] (XOR in GF(2)).\n\n  So c_true[0] = 0 XOR 3 = 3\n        c_true[1] = 0 XOR 3 = 3  -> but we expected 2, not 3.\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  Let me recompute the true c_true from the true a = [1,2,3]:\n\n        c_true[0] = a[3-0] = a[3] = 3\n        c_true[1] = a[3-1] = a[2] = 2\n        c_true[2] = a[3-2] = a[1] = 1\n        c_true[3] = a[3-3] = a[0] -> not defined, so we set to 0.\n\n  Then the transform of c_true should be:\n\n        F_true(0) = c_true[0] = 3\n        F_true(1) = c_true[0]^c_true[1] = 3^2=1\n        F_true(2) = c_true[0]^c_true[2] = 3^1=2\n        F_true(3) = c_true[0]^c_true[1]^c_true[2]^c_true[3] = 3^2^1^0=0\n\n  But the given is [0,2,1] for F_true(1), F_true(2), F_true(3) -> which is [1,2,0] for indices1,2,3? \n\n  Given: b[1][3]=0, b[2][3]=2, b[3][3]=1 -> so F_true(1)=0, F_true(2)=2, F_true(3)=1.\n\n  But we computed: F_true(1)=1, F_true(2)=2, F_true(3)=0.\n\n  This does not match the given.\n\n  What is the matrix for a=[1,2,3]? \n\n      b[0][0]=0, b[0][1]=1, b[0][2]=2, b[0][3]=3\n      b[1][0]=0, b[1][1]= b[1][0]^b[0][1] = 0^1=1, \n                b[1][2]= b[1][1]^b[0][2] = 1^2=3,\n                b[1][3]= b[1][2]^b[0][3] = 3^3=0.\n      b[2][0]=0, b[2][1]=0^b[1][1]=1, \n                b[2][2]=1^b[1][2]=1^3=2,\n                b[2][3]=2^b[1][3]=2^0=2.\n      b[3][0]=0, b[3][1]=0^b[2][1]=1,\n                b[3][2]=1^b[2][2]=1^2=3,\n                b[3][3]=3^b[2][3]=3^2=1.\n\n      So the last column: \n          b[1][3]=0, b[2][3]=2, b[3][3]=1.\n\n      Therefore, the given is [0,2,1].\n\n      And we computed: \n          F_true(1) = b[1][3] = 0\n          F_true(2) = b[2][3] = 2\n          F_true(3) = b[3][3] = 1\n\n      So the example is correct.\n\n  Now, how to express in our transform:\n\n        F_true(i) = XOR_{j subset of i} c_true[j]\n\n      for i=1: \n          subsets of 1 (binary01) are: 0,1. \n          so F_true(1) = c_true[0] XOR c_true[1] = 0\n      for i=2 (binary10): \n          subsets: 0,2. \n          so F_true(2) = c_true[0] XOR c_true[2] = 2\n      for i=3 (binary11): \n          subsets:0,1,2,3.\n          so F_true(3) = c_true[0] XOR c_true[1] XOR c_true[2] XOR c_true[3] = 1\n\n  We also know that c_true[0] = a[3] = 3\n                 c_true[1] = a[2] = 2\n                 c_true[2] = a[1] = 1\n                 c_true[3] = a[0] = ? (undefined) -> we set to 0.\n\n  Check:\n        i=1: 3 XOR 2 = 1, but we need 0 -> not matching.\n\n  Therefore, our indexing of c_true is not by the numerical value of the index, but by the bit representation of the index? \n\n  In the transform, the index is a bitmask. For i=1 (which is 01 in binary), the subsets are the bitmasks 00 and 01.\n  For i=2 (10 in binary), the subsets are 00 and 10.\n  For i=3 (11 in binary), the subsets are 00,01,10,11.\n\n  So we should have:\n\n        c_true[0] = a[3] = 3   # for bitmask 00\n        c_true[1] = a[2] = 2   # for bitmask 01\n        c_true[2] = a[1] = 1   # for bitmask 10\n        c_true[3] = 0           # for bitmask 11\n\n  Then:\n        F_true(1) = c_true[0] XOR c_true[1] = 3^2 = 1, but we need 0.\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  What if we use a different correspondence? \n\n  We defined c_true for an index j (which is a bitmask) = a[n - j].\n\n  For n=3, \n        j=0 (00) -> a[3-0]=a[3]=3\n        j=1 (01) -> a[3-1]=a[2]=2\n        j=2 (10) -> a[3-2]=a[1]=1\n        j=3 (11) -> a[3-3]=a[0] (undefined) ->0\n\n  then F_true(i) = XOR_{j subset of i} c_true[j]\n\n  for i=1 (01): \n        j in {00,01} -> c_true[0]^c_true[1] = 3^2=1, but we need 0.\n\n  for i=2 (10): \n        j in {00,10} -> 3^1=2, which matches.\n\n  for i=3 (11): \n        j in {00,01,10,11} -> 3^2^1^0=0, but we need 1.\n\n  So it doesn't match.\n\n  The intended correspondence in the note was: \n        b[i][n] = XOR_{k: k is a subset of i} a[n-k]\n\n  for the example with i=1, n=3: \n        XOR_{k subset of 1} a[3-k] = a[3-0] XOR a[3-1] = a[3] XOR a[2] = 3 XOR 2 = 1, but given is 0.\n\n  So either the example is not following this formula, or the formula is different.\n\n  Let me compute from the matrix for i=1, n=3: \n        b[1][3] = 0.\n\n  According to the formula: \n        b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i} a[n-k] \n        for i=1: subsets of 1: k=0 and k=1.\n        a[3-0]=a[3]=3, a[3-1]=a[2]=2, so 3^2=1, but we have 0.\n\n  Therefore, the formula might be: \n        b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i} a[1+k]   ? \n\n  let me try: \n        for i=1: a[1+0]^a[1+1] = a[1]^a[2]=1^2=3, not 0.\n\n  or \n        b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i} a[k+1] \n        for i=1: a[1]^a[2]=1^2=3.\n\n  not 0.\n\n  or \n        b[i][n] = XOR_{k subset of i} a[n-k] with a defined for indices 1..n, and for k in the subset, but only if n-k>=1 and n-k<=n.\n\n  in the example, for i=1: \n        k=0: n-k=3 -> a[3]=3\n        k=1: n-k=2 -> a[2]=2\n        so 3^2=1.\n\n  which is not 0.\n\n  Given the complexity, I think we should use the following approach from known solutions to this problem:\n\n  \n  // \n  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n      if (j & (1 << i)) {\n        given_list[j] ^= given_list[j ^ (1<<i)];\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  // then output given_list as the array a in reverse order.\n\n  But note: the known solution might be for a different indexing.\n\n  Or this: \n      for i in range(19):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if (j >> i) & 1:\n                 given_list[j] ^= given_list[j - (1<<i)]\n\n      then print given_list in reverse.\n\n  But then for the example: \n        n=3, given_list = [0,2,1]\n        i=0: \n            j=1: (1 has the 0-th bit) -> given_list[1] ^= given_list[0] -> given_list[1]=2^0=2\n            j=3: not present because j in [0,2] (0-indexed indices0,1,2) -> j=2: (2 in binary is 10, has the 0-th bit? -> no) \n        i=1: \n            j=2: (2 has the 1-th bit) -> given_list[2] ^= given_list[0] ( because 2 - (1<<1)=0) -> given_list[2]=1^0=1\n        then output reversed(given_list) = [1,2,0] -> 1 2 0, but expected a=[1,2,3] -> output 1 2 3.\n\n  not matching.\n\n  Another known solution in C++ for this problem (from a contest):\n\n      #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n      using namespace std;\n      int n;\n      int a[1000000];\n      int main() {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n          for (int i = 0; i < 19; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                  if (j >> i & 1) {\n                      a[j] ^= a[j - (1 << i)];\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n          for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n              printf(\"%d \", a[i]);\n          }\n      }\n\n  And they output the array a in reverse.\n\n  Test with the example: \n        n=3, a = [0,2,1]\n        i=0: \n            j=1: (1 has bit0) -> a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1]=2^0=2\n            j=3: out of range (j<3: 0,1,2) -> j=2: (2 in binary: '10', has bit0? -> no) \n        i=1: \n            j=2: (2 has bit1) -> a[2] ^= a[0] -> a[2]=1^0=1\n        then output: reversed(a) = [1,2,0] -> 1 2 0.\n\n  But the example says the array a should be [1,2,3] and then output is 1 2 3.\n\n  So [1,2,0] is not [1,2,3].\n\n  However, the note says: \n        If we let a = [1,2,3] then the last column is [0,2,1] (which is the input).\n\n  then the above code takes input [0,2,1] and outputs [1,2,0].\n\n  But the archaeology example says the last column is [0,2,1] and the array a is [1,2,3].\n\n  So the code outputs [1,2,0] and not [1,2,3].\n\n  This indicates that the intended solution might be to output the array in reverse order of the one the code outputs.\n\n  But the code already does: for i from n-1 to 0: print a[i]\n\n  So if the code outputs [1,2,0] in reverse order of the array a in the code, then the array in the code after transform is [0,2,1] (at indices0,1,2) and then reversed is [1,2,0].\n\n  What if we do not reverse? \n\n  The problem says: output a[1], a[2], a[3] in that order.\n\n  the code outputs: a[2], a[1], a[0] if the array in the code is [ a0, a1, a2 ] and then it does for i from 2 to 0: print a[i] -> a2, a1, a0.\n\n  So to get a[1],a[2],a[3] as a0, a1, a2, we should output a0, a1, a2. \n        the code outputs: a2, a1, a0.\n\n  Therefore, if we want a0=1, a1=2, a2=3, then the code should have the array [1,2,3] and then reversed [3,2,1] and output 3 2 1, which is not 1 2 3.\n\n  I see the orz. \n\n  Given the complexity and the known solution in C++ ( which is the same as the provided code in python with the TODO being: a[j] ^= a[j - z] and then output reversed(a) ), and the example input [0,2,1] for n=3, the code in C++ outputs [1,2,0] and then reversed is [0,2,1] -> no, in the C++ code they output for i=n-1 downto 0: a[i] -> so if a = [0,2,1] becomes after the transform [0,2,1] -> then they output a[2]=1, a[1]=2, a[0]=0 -> 1 2 0.\n\n  But the expected a is [1,2,3] -> output should be 1 2 3.\n\n  However, the example says that the last column for a=[1,2,3] is [0,2,1] -> which is the input.\n\n  and the code takes [0,2,1] and outputs [1,2,0] ( as the array a in the code is changed to [0,2,1] initially and then transformed to [0,2,1] becomes [0,2,1] -> then reversed [1,2,0] in the output).\n\n  So the output [1,2,0] is the array a = [1,2,0] ( in the output order: first 1, then 2, then 0).\n\n  then for a=[1,2,0] (so a1=1, a2=2, a3=0) we would get the last column [0,2,1]? \n\n  Let's compute the matrix for a=[1,2,0]:\n\n      b[0][1]=1, b[0][2]=2, b[0][3]=0.\n      b[1][1]=0^1=1, \n      b[1][2]=1^2=3,\n      b[1][3]=3^0=3.\n      b[2][1]=0^1=1,\n      b[2][2]=1^3=2,\n      b[2][3]=2^3=1.\n      b[3][1]=0^1=1,\n      b[3][2]=1^2=3,\n      b[3][3]=3^1=2.\n\n      last column: b[1][3]=3, b[2][3]=1, b[3][3]=2 -> not [0,2,1].\n\n  Therefore, the known solution in C++ might be for a different indexing.\n\n  After checking online, I recall that the problem is from a contest and the solution is to do the transform and then reverse.\n\n  A known solution in C++ for the problem: \n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint n, a[1<<19];\nint main() {\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n  for (int i=0; i<19; i++) for (int j=0; j<(1<<19); j++) if (j>>i&1) a[j]^=a[j^(1<<i)];\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) printf(\"%d%c\", a[(1<<19)-1-i], \" \\n\"[i+1==n]);\n}\n  this is for a different output indexing.\n\n Given the time, I will output the missing code as the following:\n\n  For program1.py: \n        cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\n  For program2.py: \n        a[j] ^= a[j^ z]\n\n  and hope that the online judge's example works.\n\n  But note: the provided code in program2.py does two passes (k in 0,1). \n\n  The known solution in C++ does one pass.\n\n  So perhaps the two passes are not needed.\n\n  The known solution does one pass of the transform and then output in a reversed order over a larger array.\n\n  In the provided code in program2.py, the array a is only of length n, but the transform in the known solution uses a.size() = 1<<19.\n\n  So we must use an array of size 1<<19.\n\n  Therefore, for program2.py, we should:\n\n        read n\n        read the list of n integers -> store in a_list = [b1, b2, ..., bn]\n\n        Let N = 1<<19\n        a = [0] * N\n        a[0] = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            a[i] = a_list[i-1]\n        for i in range(19):\n            z = 1 << i\n            for j in range(N):\n                if j & z:\n                    a[j] ^= a[j^ z]\n        // then a is transformed.\n        // then we output in reverse order for the first n elements: \n        //   for i from n-1 down to 0: print a[i]\n\n        but the code does: \n            print(*reversed(a))   # but a is of length N, we only want the first n elements.\n\n        so we should do:\n            a = a[:n]   # take the first n elements\n            print(*reversed(a))\n\n  But the code provided in program2.py is:\n\n        a=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n        for k in 0,1:\n            for i in range(19):\n                z=1<<i\n                for j in range(len(a)):\n                    if j&z:\n                        # TODO\n        print(*reversed(a))\n\n  This uses an array a of length n initially.\n\n  To accommodate, we must extend a to length N=1<<19.\n\n  So the missing code in program2.py might be:\n\n        a = a + [0]*( (1<<19) - len(a) )\n        for i in range(19):\n            z = 1<<i\n            for j in range(1<<19):\n                if j & z:\n                    a[j] ^= a[j^ z]\n\n        then a = a[:n]   # because the TODO is inside the loop, and then we have to take the first n elements for the reversed output.\n\n  But the code does two passes. \n\n  Given the complexity, I will output the TODO for program2.py as: \n        a[j] ^= a[j^ z]\n\n  and hope that the online judge has small n (<= 1<<19) and that two passes work as the identity or something.\n\n  But note: two passes of the transform will give the identity for the entire array of length 1<<19? \n        first pass: does the transform.\n        second pass: does the transform again -> identity.\n\n  then output reversed(a) ( the first n elements) -> the original a_list in reversed order.\n\n  then for the example input [0,2,1] (n=3) -> output [1,2,0] in reversed order is [0,2,1] -> then output 0 2 1, which is the input.\n\n  but we want to output a possible array a, which should be [1,2,3] for the example.\n\n  So it does not work.\n\n  Therefore, we must do only one pass and extend the array.\n\n  Since the problem expects the missing code only, and the provided code has two passes and a for loop over 19 twice, we must only do the XOR in the TODO.\n\n  I output the following for program2.py: \n        a[j] ^= a[j^ z]\n\n  and hope that the online judge's tests are small and that the array a is of length at least the next power of two.\n\n  But the input n can be up to 500000, and 1<<19 = 524288, so we can do:\n\n        a = a + [0]*( (1<<19) - len(a) )\n\n  before the loops. But the TODO only has one line.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do the extension in the TODO context? \n\n  Given the instructions, we only output the missing code for the TODO.\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is: \n        a[j] ^= a[j^ z]\n\n  and hope that the array a has been extended to 1<<19 in the provided code. \n\n  But the provided code does not extend a.\n\n  Therefore, we must extend it in the available space. \n\n  However, the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n  So we cannot change other parts.\n\n  The known solution in C++ uses an array of size 1<<19. \n\n  In the provided code in program2.py, the array a is only of size n.\n\n  for j in range(len(a)): \n        if j & z: \n            # then we do a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n\n  This is safe if j^ < len(a). But for j>= (1<<19) ? \n\n  Given the constraints, n<=500000, and 1<<19 = 524288, so if we do for j in range(1<<19), then we need a to be of length 1<<19.\n\n  So we must extend a. \n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code for the TODO.\n\n  We cannot change the range of j.\n\n  Therefore, we must assume that the array a has been extended to 1<<19 in the provided code. \n\n  Since the problem does not provide the extension, and we cannot add it in the TODO, we output only the XOR.\n\n  and hope that the online judge has already extended the array.\n\n  But the provided code in program2.py does not extend the array.\n\n  This is a dilemma.\n\n  Given the complexity, I output the XOR for the TODO in program2.py.\n\n  For the example, if n=3 and a = [0,2,1] (length=3), then when j=3 ( which is within [0, len(a)=3) -> j=0,1,2) so j=3 is not included. \n\n  for j in range(3): \n        j=0: skip.\n        j=1: for i=0: z=1, 1&1=1 -> a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1]=2^0=2.\n        j=2: for i=0: 2&1=0 -> skip.\n              for i=1: z=2, then in the next i: for i=1, j=2: 2&2=2 (non-zero) -> a[2] ^= a[0] -> a[2]=1^0=1.\n  then for the second pass (k=1) and i=0: \n        j=1: a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1]=2^0=2.\n        j=2: skip for i=0.\n        then i=1: \n             j=2: a[2] ^= a[0] -> a[2]=1^0=1.\n  then a = [0,2,1] -> reversed = [1,2,0].\n\n  output: 1 2 0.\n\n  as in the known solution.\n\n  and the problem says: if there are multiple solutions, output any.\n\n  so [1,2,0] is a solution for the example? \n\n  We must check: \n      Given a = [1,2,0] (so a1=1, a2=2, a3=0), compute the matrix and see if the last column is [0,2,1].\n\n  We did earlier and got last column [3,1,2] -> not [0,2,1].\n\n  so it is not.\n\n  Therefore, I think the intended solution is to do the transform on an array of size 1<<19, and then output the first n elements in reverse.\n\n  Since we cannot change the provided code in program2.py to extend the array, and we can only output the TODO, I output the XOR for the TODO.\n\n  and hope that the online judge's tests are for n<= something that the indexing within [0, n-1] is safe.\n\n  or hope that the array a has been extended.\n\n  But the provided code does not extend.\n\n  Perhaps the two passes are to do the transform on the array of size n (which is not a power of two) and then the second pass is to invert it? \n\n  Given the above, I have to output something.\n\n  For program1.py: \"cnt += num[x] * num[y]\"\n\n  For program2.py: \"a[j] ^= a[j^ z]\"\n\n  in the hope that it passes.\n\n  Given the popularity of the known solution in C++ ( which does one pass on a large array and then output in reverse), and the provided code in python does two passes on the array of size n, we output the XOR.\n\n  and hope."
