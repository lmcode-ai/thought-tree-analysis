Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: For each test case, we are given n (>=4) and we must output four positive integers a, b, c, d such that:\n  a+b+c+d = n\n  and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d)\n\nWe are provided with a code that uses:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for each test case:\n      n = int(input()) m = n//4\n      if n % 4 == 0:\n          print(m, m, m, m, end=' ')\n      elif n % 4 == 1:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      elif n % 4 == 2:\n          print(2*m-1, 2*m+1, 1, 1, end=' ')\n      else:  # n % 4 == 3\n          print(2, 4*m-2, 2, 1, end=' ')\n\nWe need to complete the case for n % 4 == 1. Looking at the examples:\n\nIn the second test case: n=7 -> 7%4=3 -> so it falls in the else? But the example output for n=7 is \"2,2,2,1\" and the else block prints: 2, 4*m-2, 2, 1. For n=7: m = 7//4 = 1 -> then 4*m-2 = 4*1-2=2. So it prints: 2,2,2,1 -> which matches. In the third test case: n=8 -> 8%4=0 -> prints 2,2,2,2. In the fourth test case: n=9 -> 9%4=1 -> so we need to complete the case for n%4==1. The example output for n=9 is: 2,4,2,1? But the example says: \"In the fourth test case gcd(2,4)=lcm(2,1)=2, 2+4+2+1=9\". So output: 2,4,2,1. But note: the example for n=10: 3,5,1,1 -> which is in the fifth test case. And n=10: 10%4=2 -> so it falls in the elif n%4==2: which prints: 2*m-1, 2*m+1, 1, 1. For n=10: m=10//4=2 -> 2*2-1=3, 2*2+1=5 -> so 3,5,1,1 -> matches. Now for n=5: n%4=1 -> we need to output four positive integers that sum to 5 and satisfy the condition. Looking at the example: the first test case n=4: 1,1,1,1. For n=5: we can try to use the pattern. The example for n=9 (which is 1 mod4) is 2,4,2,1. But 2+4+2+1=9. For n=5, we cannot use 2,4,2,1 because that sums to 9. We need a solution for n=5. We can try: \n  We want a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d=5 and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). One solution: \n  a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2 -> but 1+1+1+2=5. Check: gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> not equal. Another solution: \n  a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> 1+2+1+1=5. gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> equal. So we can output: 1,2,1,1. But note: the problem says \"if there are several possible answers you can output any of them\". So for n%4==1, we can output: 1,2,1,1? But what about n=9?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends and trying to have the same total weight while maximizing the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py uses two pointers (a and b) and two sums (suma and sumb). The idea is:\n- Start with a = -1 (so the first candy is at index0) and b = n (so the last candy is at index n-1).\n- We have a variable `cur` for the current count of candies eaten and `ans` for the best count when the two sums are equal.\n\nThe while loop runs until the pointers meet or cross.\n\nThe current code has:\n  if a>=b: break\n  elif suma>sumb: \n        # TODO: Your code here\n  elif suma<sumb:\n        a moves right, add arr[a] to suma, cur increases by 1.\n  else: (suma == sumb)\n        update ans to cur (because this is a valid partition), then move both pointers: a moves right and b moves left, updating sums and adding 2 to cur.\n\nThe missing part is when suma > sumb. In that case, we should move the right pointer (b) to the left, adding the candy at b-1 to sumb and increasing cur by 1.\n\nSo the missing code for the \"elif suma>sumb\" block should be:\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: the current condition in the while loop is \"while True\" and we break when a>=b. Also, in the else block (when equal) we update both pointers. However, we must be cautious: when we move the right pointer, we are decreasing b by 1 and then adding arr[b] (which is the next candy from the right). Since initially b is n (so the last candy is at index n-1), we first do b-=1 to get to index n-1, then add arr[b]. Similarly, in the missing block, we should do the same.\n\nHowever, in the current code for the \"suma < sumb\" case, we do:\n    a += 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note that initially a is -1, so the first time we do a+=1 -> a=0, then add arr[0].\n\nSimilarly, for the right pointer, we start at b = n. To get the last candy we do b-=1 to get to n-1, then add arr[b]. So the missing block should be:\n\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: we must be cautious that after b-=1, the new b is now the next candy from the right that hasn't been eaten. And we add that candy to sumb.\n\nAlso, note that the problem says the total number of candies eaten is the maximum when the two sums are equal. The code updates `ans` only when the sums are equal. However, we might have multiple equal points? But note that the pointers are moving and we are updating `ans` every time we have an equal. But the problem asks for the maximum total candies. However, note that when we have an equal, we update `ans` to the current `cur` (which is the total count so far). But then we continue by moving both pointers? Actually, the code in the else block does:\n\n    ans = cur   # so we record the current total as a candidate for the answer\n    a += 1\n    b -= 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 2\n\nBut note: after updating `ans`, we then move both pointers and update the sums. This is because we are trying to see if we can get a longer sequence? However, the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So when we have an equal, we can try to extend by one from the left and one from the right? But note: the next time we have an equal, the total candies eaten will be more (by 2). So we are looking for the last time they are equal? Actually, the problem wants the maximum total candies. So we want the last time they are equal? But note: it is possible that after an equal, we then have an imbalance and then later become equal again? However, the two pointers are moving inward and we are increasing the sums. The problem does not require contiguous segments? Actually, they are contiguous from the left and from the right. But note: the segments are disjoint.\n\nBut the provided algorithm is standard for this problem (two pointers). The idea is to start with no candies and then gradually add from the left or right until the sums are balanced. We record every time the sums are equal and then update the answer to the current total. Then we try to extend by one from both sides? Actually, the else block does that: after recording the current total, it then moves both pointers and continues. This is because we are trying to see if we can get a longer sequence that includes the current one? However, note that the current state is that the two segments (Alice and Bob) have the same sum. Then we add one more from the left and one more from the right and then check again. This is valid because we are extending the segments.\n\nBut note: the problem says they can stop at any time. So we are looking for the maximum total number of candies. Therefore, we want the last time they are equal? Actually, we are updating `ans` every time we have an equal. But then we continue and if we get another equal, that would be a longer sequence? So we should update `ans` to the last equal we get? However, the code updates `ans` to the current `cur` and then continues. But then if we break without having updated the last equal, we might miss a longer sequence.\n\nBut note: the algorithm breaks when the pointers cross. The last equal we found is the one with the maximum total? Actually, we are always trying to extend the segments. However, the problem is that the two segments must be disjoint. The algorithm is designed to record every time the sums are equal and then extend by one from both sides. Then the next time we have an equal, the total candies is increased by 2. So we are looking for the maximum total.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total number of candies is the sum of the two segments. And we are increasing the total by 1 in the left or right and by 2 in the equal case? Actually, in the equal case we are adding two at once. But then we break the next time we have an equal? Actually, we update `ans` and then extend. So the last time we update `ans` is the maximum? However, what if after extending we never get an equal again? Then the last recorded `ans` is the maximum.\n\nBut the problem says: \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\nIn that test case, the total candies is 3+4 = 7.\n\nSo the algorithm must record 7.\n\nBut note: the provided code for the else block updates `ans` to the current `cur` and then extends. So when we have an equal, we record the current total and then extend. Then we break when the pointers cross. But what if the next state is not equal? Then we break without having updated `ans` for the extended state? Actually, we break only when the pointers cross. But the else block updates and then we continue the loop. So we might have multiple equal points.\n\nHowever, the problem says the total n is up to 200,000 and the sum of n over test cases is 200,000. So the two pointers will run in O(n) per test case.\n\nBut the issue: the current code in the else block updates `ans` to the current `cur` and then extends. Then the next time we have an equal, we update `ans` to a larger `cur`. So we are always updating to the last equal we get? That would be the maximum.\n\nBut what if we break without having an equal after the last recorded one? Then the last recorded `ans` is the maximum? Actually, we break when the pointers cross. The last recorded `ans` is the maximum we found.\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer for the fourth test case is 7. How does the algorithm get 7?\n\nLet the array for the fourth test case be: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] (from the example: Alice eats [7,3,20] and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> but note the example says Bob eats from the right: [10,8,11,1] so the array must be from left to right: [7,3,20, ... , 10,8,11,1]? Actually, the example says: \"the candies are numbered from left to right\" and Bob eats from the right. So the array is: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]? But then Alice eats the first three: 7,3,20 -> 30. Bob eats the last four: 1,11,8,10 -> 30? But 1+11+8+10=30. So the array is: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]? Then the middle candy is 5? But they leave the 5? Actually, the example says: \"they each eat 30\" and the total candies eaten is 7.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nWe start:\n  a = -1, b = 8 (n=8)\n  suma=0, sumb=0, cur=0, ans=0\n\nFirst: suma==sumb (0==0) -> then we update ans=0, then we do:\n  a becomes 0, b becomes 7.\n  suma = 7, sumb = 1 (arr[7]=1), cur=2.\n\nThen: 7>1 -> we move the right pointer? Actually, we are in the condition suma>sumb? So we do:\n  b becomes 6, then add arr[6]=11 -> sumb=12, cur=3.\nNow: 7<12 -> move left: a becomes 1, suma=7+3=10, cur=4.\nNow: 10<12 -> move left: a becomes 2, suma=10+20=30, cur=5.\nNow: 30>12 -> move right: b becomes 5, sumb=12+8=20, cur=6.\nNow: 30>20 -> move right: b becomes 4, sumb=20+10=30, cur=7.\nNow: 30==30 -> update ans=7, then move both: a becomes 3, b becomes 3 -> but then a>=b? Actually, a=3 and b=3 -> so we break? But we updated ans to 7.\n\nThen we break and print 7.\n\nSo the missing block for the \"suma>sumb\" is indeed:\n\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: we must be cautious that when we do b-=1, we are moving the right pointer to the next candy (from the right) that hasn't been eaten. And then we add that candy to sumb.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: For each test case, we are given n (>=4) and we must output four positive integers a, b, c, d such that:\n  a+b+c+d = n\n  and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d)\n\nWe are provided with a code that uses:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for each test case:\n      n = int(input())\n      m = n//4\n      if n % 4 == 0:\n          print(m, m, m, m, end=' ')\n      elif n % 4 == 1:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      elif n % 4 == 2:\n          print(2*m-1, 2*m+1, 1, 1, end=' ')\n      else:  # n % 4 == 3\n          print(2, 4*m-2, 2, 1, end=' ')\n\nWe need to complete the case for n % 4 == 1.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn the second test case: n=7 -> 7%4=3 -> so it falls in the else? But the example output for n=7 is \"2,2,2,1\" and the else block prints: 2, 4*m-2, 2, 1. For n=7: m = 7//4 = 1 -> then 4*m-2 = 4*1-2=2. So it prints: 2,2,2,1 -> which matches.\n\nIn the third test case: n=8 -> 8%4=0 -> prints 2,2,2,2.\n\nIn the fourth test case: n=9 -> 9%4=1 -> so we need to complete the case for n%4==1.\n\nThe example output for n=9 is: 2,4,2,1? But the example says: \"In the fourth test case gcd(2,4)=lcm(2,1)=2, 2+4+2+1=9\". So output: 2,4,2,1.\n\nBut note: the example for n=10: 3,5,1,1 -> which is in the fifth test case. And n=10: 10%4=2 -> so it falls in the elif n%4==2: which prints: 2*m-1, 2*m+1, 1, 1. For n=10: m=10//4=2 -> 2*2-1=3, 2*2+1=5 -> so 3,5,1,1 -> matches.\n\nNow for n=5: n%4=1 -> we need to output four positive integers that sum to 5 and satisfy the condition.\n\nLooking at the example: the first test case n=4: 1,1,1,1.\n\nFor n=5: we can try to use the pattern. The example for n=9 (which is 1 mod4) is 2,4,2,1. But 2+4+2+1=9. For n=5, we cannot use 2,4,2,1 because that sums to 9. We need a solution for n=5.\n\nWe can try: \n  We want a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d=5 and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\nOne solution: \n  a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2 -> but 1+1+1+2=5. \n  Check: gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> not equal.\n\nAnother solution: \n  a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> 1+2+1+1=5.\n  gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> equal.\n\nSo we can output: 1,2,1,1.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"if there are several possible answers you can output any of them\".\n\nSo for n%4==1, we can output: 1,2,1,1? But what about n=9? The example output is 2,4,2,1. We need a general formula.\n\nWe note that the provided code for other cases uses a base of m = n//4.\n\nFor n%4==1: \n  n = 4*m + 1.\n\nWe need to split 4*m+1 into four positive integers.\n\nWe can try to set:\n  a = 1\n  b = 2\n  c = 1\n  d = 4*m+1 - (1+2+1) = 4*m+1-4 = 4*(m-1)+1? \n\nBut for m=1 (n=5): then d=4*(1-1)+1=1 -> so 1,2,1,1 -> which works.\n\nFor m=2 (n=9): then d=4*(2-1)+1=5 -> so 1,2,1,5 -> but 1+2+1+5=9. \n  Check: gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,5)=5 -> not equal.\n\nSo that doesn't work for n=9.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the pattern from the example: 2,4,2,1 for n=9. How can we generalize?\n\nIn the example for n=9: \n  a=2, b=4, c=2, d=1 -> and gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\nWe can try to set:\n  a = 2\n  b = 4*(m-1) + 4?  But for n=9: m=9//4=2 -> then 4*(2-1)+4 = 8 -> then 2,8,2,? -> 2+8+2=12, which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, note that the example for n=9: \n  a=2, b=4, c=2, d=1 -> and 2+4+2+1=9.\n\nWe can set:\n  a = 2\n  b = 4*(m-1) + 2?  For m=2: 4*(1)+2=6 -> then 2,6,2,? -> 2+6+2=10, which is too big.\n\nAnother idea: \n  We want gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d) = x (say).\n  We can set x to 1? Then we can have a and b any two numbers that are coprime? and c and d any two numbers that are coprime? and then we can set a=1, b=1, c=1, d = n-3. But then we require lcm(1, n-3)=1 -> which requires n-3=1 -> so n=4. But we are in n%4=1, so n>=5.\n\nAlternatively, set x to 1: then we can have a=1, b= ... , and then c and d can be 1 and any number? because lcm(1, k)=k, so we require k=1? then d must be 1? Then we have a+b+1+1 = n -> a+b = n-2. And we require gcd(a,b)=1. We can set a=1, b=n-3? Then gcd(1, n-3)=1. So the numbers: 1, n-3, 1, 1. Then the total is 1 + (n-3) + 1 + 1 = n. And condition: gcd(1, n-3)=1 and lcm(1,1)=1 -> equal.\n\nSo for any n>=4, we can set: 1, n-3, 1, 1. But note: we require positive integers and n>=4 -> n-3>=1 when n>=4? Actually, for n=4: 1,1,1,1 -> which is the example. For n=5: 1,2,1,1 -> which we saw works. For n=9: 1,6,1,1 -> then gcd(1,6)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works. But the example for n=9 used 2,4,2,1 which is different. \n\nBut the problem says \"if there are several possible answers you can output any of them\". So we can use: 1, n-3, 1, 1.\n\nBut wait: the example for n=9: the output was 2,4,2,1. Why did they choose that? Because they want to show a solution that uses the condition with a gcd that is not 1? But our solution uses gcd=1. It is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the provided code for other cases does not use 1 and n-3. For example, for n%4==2: they use (2*m-1, 2*m+1, 1, 1). Note that 2*m-1 and 2*m+1 are consecutive odd numbers so they are coprime -> gcd=1, and lcm(1,1)=1. So that solution also uses gcd=1. Similarly, the else case (n%4==3) uses: 2, 4*m-2, 2, 1. \n  For n=7: m=1 -> 2, 2, 2, 1 -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> so they use 2.\n  For n=11: m=2 -> 2, 4*2-2=6, 2, 1 -> 2+6+2+1=11. gcd(2,6)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\nSo for n%4==1, we can use the same pattern as the other cases? \n\nBut note: the problem says the answer always exists.\n\nWe can use the solution: 1, n-3, 1, 1.\n\nBut the problem does not require a particular pattern. However, the provided code for the other cases uses a pattern that depends on m = n//4. We can do similarly for n%4==1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n  a = 1\n  b = n-3\n  c = 1\n  d = 1\n\nSo we can print: 1, n-3, 1, 1.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and n-3>=1 because n>=4? Actually, for n=4: 1,1,1,1 -> n-3=1 -> valid. For n=5: 1,2,1,1 -> valid.\n\nBut what if n-3 is 1? Then we have 1,1,1,1 -> which is valid.\n\nSo the code for the missing part (n%4==1) can be:\n\n    print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut wait: the example for n=9: the provided example output was 2,4,2,1. Our solution for n=9 would be 1,6,1,1. Both are valid. However, the problem does not require a particular solution.\n\nBut note: the example in the problem for n=9 is 2,4,2,1. Why? Because they want to show a solution that uses the same pattern? The problem says \"if there are several possible answers you can output any of them\".\n\nSo we can output 1, n-3, 1, 1.\n\nBut let me check the constraints: n can be as large as 10^9. Our solution uses 1, n-3, 1, 1. The numbers are positive because n>=4 -> n-3>=1.\n\nHowever, the provided code for n%4==0 uses m, and for n%4==2 uses 2*m-1 and 2*m+1 (which are about 2*m, so about n/2). The else case (n%4==3) uses 2 and 4*m-2 (which is about n-4). So they are not using 1 and n-3. But that is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a pattern that is more similar to the others? \n\nFor n%4==1: \n  We can set: \n      a = 2\n      b = 4*(m-1) + 3   # because 2 + (4*(m-1)+3) = 4*m+1? -> 2+4*m-4+3 = 4*m+1 -> 4*m+1 = 4*m+1 -> works.\n      c = 2\n      d = 1\n\nBut then we have: 2, 4*m-1, 2, 1? and the total is 2 + (4*m-1) + 2 + 1 = 4*m+4? -> but we need 4*m+1. \n\nAlternatively, we can set:\n      a = 1\n      b = 4*m   # then 1+4*m + ... = 4*m+1 -> then the rest must be 0? not possible.\n\nAnother pattern: \n  We want gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). We can set the common value to 1? Then we can use 1, any, 1, 1. But we did that.\n\nOr we can set the common value to 2? Then we require:\n  gcd(a,b)=2 and lcm(c,d)=2.\n\nFor lcm(c,d)=2: then the possibilities for (c,d) are: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). \n\nWe can set c=2, d=2? Then we have a+b = n-4. And we require gcd(a,b)=2. We can set a=2, b = n-6? Then gcd(2, n-6) might not be 2? For example, if n-6 is odd, then gcd=1. So we require n-6 even? Then n must be even? but n%4=1 -> odd. So n-6 is odd? Then gcd(2, odd)=1 -> not 2.\n\nAlternatively, set c=1, d=2 -> then lcm(1,2)=2. Then we require gcd(a,b)=2 and a+b = n-3. We can set a=2, b = n-5? Then gcd(2, n-5): if n-5 is even, then gcd at least 2? But if n-5 is divisible by 2, then gcd=2? Actually, because n%4=1 -> n is odd -> n-5 is even? So n-5 is even. Then gcd(2, n-5)=2? Because 2 divides both? But if n-5 is divisible by 4? then gcd could be 2? Actually, gcd(2, even number) is 2 if the even number is not divisible by a higher power? Actually, gcd(2, k) is 2 if k is even? Actually, no: gcd(2,4)=2, gcd(2,6)=2, gcd(2,8)=2. So yes, if k is even, then gcd(2,k)=2.\n\nSo we can set: a=2, b=n-5, c=1, d=2. Then the total: 2 + (n-5) + 1 + 2 = n. And condition: gcd(2, n-5)=2 and lcm(1,2)=2 -> works.\n\nBut note: we require positive integers: \n  a=2>0, \n  b=n-5: for n>=5? But n>=4 and n%4=1 -> the smallest n is 5: then b=0 -> not positive. So for n=5: b=0 -> invalid.\n\nSo we cannot use this for n=5.\n\nWe can set a=4, b=n-7, then a+b = n-3. Then we require gcd(4, n-7)=? and we set c=1, d=2 -> lcm=2. Then we require gcd(4, n-7)=2. \n  For n=5: 4, 5-7=-2 -> invalid.\n\nAlternatively, we can set a and b to be even numbers that are at least 2? and then we can set a=2, b= n-3-2 = n-5? But then for n=5: b=0 -> invalid.\n\nSo the solution 1, n-3, 1, 1 is safe.\n\nBut note: the example for n=9: the problem output is 2,4,2,1. How did they get that? \n  They set: \n      a=2, b=4 -> gcd(2,4)=2.\n      c=2, d=1 -> lcm(2,1)=2.\n      and 2+4+2+1=9.\n\nWe can generalize: \n  We set: \n      a = 2\n      b = 4*(m-1) + 2   # for m = n//4, but n=4*m+1 -> so 4*(m-1)+2 = 4*m-4+2 = 4*m-2 -> then a=2, b=4*m-2, c=2, d=1? \n      Then total = 2 + (4*m-2) + 2 + 1 = 4*m+3 -> but we need 4*m+1.\n\nAlternatively, we can set:\n      a = 2\n      b = 4*(m-1)   # then 2+4*m-4 = 4*m-2, then we need c+d = 4*m+1 - (4*m-2) = 3. \n      Then we set c=1, d=2? Then total=2 + (4*m-4) + 1 + 2 = 4*m+1 -> works.\n      Then the numbers: 2, 4*(m-1), 1, 2.\n\nBut for m=1 (n=5): then 4*(1-1)=0 -> invalid.\n\nSo we must avoid zero.\n\nWe can adjust: \n  For m>=2: we can use: 2, 4*(m-1), 1, 2 -> but then the gcd(2,4*(m-1))=2, and lcm(1,2)=2 -> works. \n  For m=1 (n=5): we use the solution 1,2,1,1.\n\nBut the problem says: the sum of the four numbers must be n. And we are in the case n%4==1 -> n=4*m+1.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  if m>=2:\n      print(2, 4*(m-1), 1, 2, end=' ')\n  else: # m=1 -> n=5\n      print(1,2,1,1, end=' ')\n\nBut note: the problem says t up to 10000, so we can have an if inside.\n\nBut the provided code for the other cases does not have an if for m. They are expressed in terms of m. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the solution 1, n-3, 1, 1 for all n%4==1. It is simpler and works for all n>=4 (with n%4==1).\n\nSo I think the intended solution for the missing part is:\n\n    print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut note: the example for n=9: the problem output is 2,4,2,1. Why did they choose that? Maybe because they want to avoid having two 1's and one large number? But the problem does not specify.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"you can output any of them\". So we can use 1, n-3, 1, 1.\n\nBut wait: the problem examples for n=4,5,7,8,9,10 are provided. For n=5: the example output is not provided? The fifth test case is n=10. The first test case is n=4, second is n=7, third is n=8, fourth is n=9, fifth is n=10. So n=5 is not in the examples? But the problem says the input n>=4.\n\nBut the problem says: \"In the fifth test case\" -> n=10. So we are free for n=5.\n\nTherefore, we complete program2.py for the case n%4==1 with:\n\n    print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut note: the code for the other cases uses expressions in terms of m. We don't use m here? But we can compute m = n//4, but we don't need it for this solution.\n\nSo the code for the missing part is:\n\n    print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut note: the other cases also use the variable m. We can avoid m for this case? Yes.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nAnd for program2.py is:\n\n    print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nNow, we output in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". And the structure: \n{\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nBut note: the missing code in program1.py is a block of 3 lines. We must output exactly the code that goes in the TODO.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, it is one line.\n\nBut note: the code for program1.py has an indentation. The missing block is inside an \"elif\" and is 3 lines. We must output the three lines with the same indentation.\n\nWe output the string exactly as it would appear in the code.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: the existing code in the \"elif suma<sumb\" block is:\n\n        a+=1\n        suma+=arr[a]\n        cur+=1\n\nIt is indented by 8 spaces (because the elif is indented by 4, then the block by 4 more). So we output the same.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation? However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo we output:\n\n        b -= 1\n        sumb += arr[b]\n        cur += 1\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing line is:\n\n        print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut note: the existing code for the other cases is at the same indentation level (inside the elif). So we output:\n\n        print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nBut wait: the existing code for n%4==0 is:\n\n        print(m,m,m,m,end=' ')\n\nand for n%4==2:\n\n        print(2*m-1,2*m+1,1,1,end=' ')\n\nand for n%4==3:\n\n        print(2,4*m-2,2,1,end=' ')\n\nSo we output the same style.\n\nTherefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        b -= 1\\n        sumb += arr[b]\\n        cur += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has a print at the end: `print(sep='')` which is intended to print a newline? But we are printing with end=' ' and then a print(sep='') which will print a newline? Actually, the print(sep='') will print nothing because there are no arguments? Then it prints a newline? But we are already printing the four numbers with a space at the end. Then we print a newline? Actually, the next test case will be on a new line? It's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the output format beyond the four numbers per test case. The example outputs are with spaces and then a newline? The code uses `end=' '` in the print and then `print(sep='')` which is equivalent to `print()` -> which prints a newline. So it's fine.\n\nWe output the JSON as specified."
