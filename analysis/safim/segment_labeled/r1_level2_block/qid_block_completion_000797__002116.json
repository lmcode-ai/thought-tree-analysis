Then we have:\n           (1) c_0 XOR c_1 = 0\n           (2) c_0 XOR c_2 = 2\n           (3) c_0 XOR c_1 XOR c_2 = 1\n\n        From (1) and (3): \n             (c_0 XOR c_1) XOR c_2 = 1 -> 0 XOR c_2 = 1 -> c_2 = 1. From (2): c_0 = 2 XOR c_2 = 2 XOR 1 = 3. From (1): c_1 = c_0 = 3. So c_0=3, c_1=3, c_2=1. Then a = [c_2, c_1, c_0] = [1,3,3] -> and then reversed(a) = [3,3,1]? But we want [1,2,3].

The code in the first pass ( for i in 0..18, for j in 0..2):\n\n   i=0 ( bit0=1<<0=1)\n        j=0: 0&1=0 -> skip. j=1: 1&1=1 -> a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1]=2^0=2. j=2: 2&1=0 -> skip. i=1 ( bit1=2)\n        j=0: skip. j=1: skip (1 in binary is 01, so bit1 is not set) -> wait, 1 in binary has only bit0.\n        j=2: 2 in binary is 10, bit1 is set -> a[2] ^= a[0] ( because 2^2=0) -> a[2]=1^0=1. j=3: not in [0,2] -> skip.

Then a = [3,2,1]\n\n   Then for i in n-1 downto 0: print a[i] -> prints: 1,2,3. So the array a after the second pass is [3,2,1] and then reversed (printed from last to first) yields 1,2,3.

Therefore, in the provided code, the TODO is to do the XOR in one of two ways depending on k.\n\n   Specifically:\n        for k in 0,1:\n            for i in range(19):\n                z=1<<i\n                for j in range(len(a)):\n                    if j&z:\n                        if k == 0:\n                            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n                        else:\n                            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But note: the provided code has only one TODO inside the if j&z.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The provided code has a TODO in the inner loop.\n\nThe problem: \n- There are t test cases. For each test case, we have n and a list of n integers (weights).\n- Alice eats from the left, Bob from the right. They cannot skip candies. They want the total weight eaten by Alice to equal that eaten by Bob, and they want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code:\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n    print(f)\n\nWe note that:\n- a: total weight Alice has eaten so far\n- b: total weight Bob has eaten so far\n- l: the next candy index from the left that Alice might eat (if she hasn't passed it) or the next candy to be considered for Alice\n- r: the next candy index from the right for Bob\n\nThe current code does:\n- If a<=b, then Alice eats the next left candy (n[l]) and we move l to the right.\n- If b < a, then we should let Bob eat a candy from the right. But the code is missing in the elif block.\n\nWe need to add:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nAlso note: the variable f is updated only when a==b. It is set to: len(n) - r + l - 1.\nBut note: \n- Initially, l=0, r = len(n)-1. The total number of candies eaten is (l) from the left and (len(n)-1 - r) from the right? Actually, when we have moved l to l, then Alice has eaten l candies (from index0 to index l-1). Similarly, Bob has eaten from the right: from index len(n)-1 down to r+1, so that's (len(n)-1 - r) candies.\n\nTherefore, the total candies eaten is l + (len(n)-1 - r). But note that when we update f, we do:\n    f = len(n) - r + l - 1\nBut note: len(n) - r - 1 is the count from the right? Actually, the total candies eaten is l (from left) and (n-1 - r) from the right? Then total = l + (n-1 - r) = l + n - 1 - r.\n\nBut the expression: len(n) - r + l - 1 = (len(n) - 1 - r) + l? Actually, it is the same: l + (len(n)-1) - r.\n\nSo that expression is correct.\n\nHowever, note that the while loop condition is l<=r. We are moving l and r until they cross.\n\nBut there is a problem: the condition for Bob is in an elif, and then after that we check if a==b. But what if after adding to Bob, a becomes equal to b? Then we update f.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total candies eaten is maximized. We are traversing from both ends and updating the sum. We record f every time the two sums are equal. Since we are moving from the ends, we are effectively trying to capture the moment when the two sums are equal and then record the total candies at that moment. And we continue until we have processed all candies? Actually, we stop when l>r.\n\nBut note: we are updating f every time a==b. The last time we update f will be the last time we have an equal sum? However, we want the maximum total candies. But note: as we move, the total candies eaten (l + (n-1-r)) is increasing? Actually, no: we are eating one candy at a time. But we are not necessarily increasing the total candies? Actually, we are: every step we eat one candy (either from left or right). So the total candies eaten is increasing. However, we want the maximum total candies for which the sums are equal. So we should record the maximum total candies when a==b.\n\nBut the current code updates f every time a==b. Since we are traversing from the outside, the total candies eaten (l + (n-1-r)) is increasing until the middle. But note: when we update f, we are at a state where a==b, and the total candies at that state is l + (n-1-r). And we continue to see if we can get a larger total? Actually, we are continuing until we have eaten all candies. And we record the last time we had a==b? But that might not be the maximum total candies? Actually, the total candies is increasing as we go. So the last time we have a==b would be the one with the largest total candies? Not necessarily: because we might have a==b at an early state and then again later? But note: we are moving from both ends and we are going to meet in the middle. The total candies eaten is increasing. So the later we get a==b, the more candies we have eaten.\n\nBut consider: \n  We start with 0 candies: a=0, b=0 -> then we have a==b and total=0? But we haven't eaten any candy. The problem says they eat at least one candy? Actually, the note: for the first test case, they eat two candies. So we are counting when they have eaten at least one candy.\n\nBut note: the initial state: a=0, b=0, and we haven't eaten any candy. Then we start: we let Alice eat the first candy? Then a becomes w0, and then we check: a==b? no. Then if b<a, we let Bob eat the last candy. Then we check: a==b? if yes, then we update f to 2 (because l=1, r=len(n)-2, so total = 1 (from Alice) + 1 (from Bob) = 2).\n\nBut what if we have a state in the middle? The total candies is increasing. So we want the last time we have a==b? Actually, the problem says: maximum number of candies. So we want the maximum total candies for which a==b. And since we are moving from the ends and the total candies is increasing, the last time we have a==b is the one with the maximum total.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple equal sums? And we want the one with the maximum total candies. So we can update f every time we have a==b and then at the end, the last update is the maximum.\n\nHowever, what if we have a==b at the beginning and then again later? The later one has more candies. So we can update f every time we have a==b and then the last one is the best.\n\nBut the code currently sets f=0 at the beginning. Then if we never have a==b, we print 0. That matches the third test case.\n\nBut note: the fourth test case: \n   Input: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] \n   They eat: Alice: [7,3,20] (30), Bob: [10,8,11,1] (30). Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\nHow does the code handle?\n   Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then we do: a<=b -> a=7, l=1 -> then a=7, b=0 -> so b<a -> Bob eats the last candy: b=1, r=6 -> then a=7, b=1 -> a<=b? no, so Bob eats next: b=1+11=12, r=5 -> then a=7, b=12 -> now a<=b: so Alice eats: a=7+3=10, l=2 -> then a=10, b=12 -> a<=b: Alice eats: a=10+20=30, l=3 -> then a=30, b=12 -> Bob eats: b=12+8=20, r=4 -> then a=30, b=20 -> Bob eats: b=20+10=30, r=3 -> now l=3, r=3 -> then we check: a=30, b=30 -> equal, so f = 8 (n) - 3 (r) + 3 (l) - 1 = 8-3+3-1 = 7 -> then we break? because l<=r: l=3, r=3 -> then we do: a<=b? 30<=30 -> so we add n[3] (which is 5) to a -> a=35, l=4 -> then l=4>r=3 -> break. Then we print 7.\n\nBut note: after we set f=7, we then in the next iteration (because l=3<=r=3) we do: a<=b -> we add the middle candy to Alice. Then we break. But then we have updated f to 7, and then we break. So we print 7.\n\nBut what if we have a state after that? Actually, we break the condition because after adding the middle candy, l becomes 4 and r is 3 -> so we break the loop. So we have recorded f=7.\n\nBut note: the code updates f only when a==b. In the state when l=3 and r=3, we have a==b (30==30) and we set f=7. Then we proceed: because l<=r (3<=3) we do the next step: we add the middle candy to Alice (because a<=b: 30<=30) -> then a becomes 35, l becomes 4. Then we break the loop. Then we print f=7.\n\nBut what if we have a case where after we set f, we get a better f? Actually, the total candies at that state would be: l=4 and r=3 -> total = 4 (from Alice) and 4 from Bob? Actually, Bob has eaten 4 candies? How? Initially, we had 8 candies. Bob has eaten: from the right: indices 7,6,5,4 -> that's 4 candies. But when we set f at l=3 and r=3, we had: Alice: 3 candies, Bob: 5? Let me recount:\n\n   Initially: candies: [0:7, 1:3, 2:20, 3:5, 4:10, 5:8, 6:11, 7:1]\n   Steps:\n      Step1: a=7 (l=1) -> then Bob eats index7: b=1 (r=6)\n      Step2: Bob eats index6: b=12 (r=5)\n      Step3: Alice eats index1: a=10 (l=2)\n      Step4: Alice eats index2: a=30 (l=3)\n      Step5: Bob eats index5: b=20 (r=4)\n      Step6: Bob eats index4: b=30 (r=3)\n      Now: l=3, r=3 -> a=30, b=30 -> set f=7 (because total = 3 (Alice) + 5 (Bob) = 8? But wait: Bob has eaten 4 candies: indices 7,6,5,4 -> that's 4. And Alice has eaten 3: indices0,1,2 -> total 7. So the expression: len(n)=8, then 8 - 3 (r) + 3 (l) - 1 = 8-3+3-1=7.\n\n   Then we do: a<=b -> so we add n[3] (which is 5) to a -> a=35, l=4 -> then we break.\n\n   So we have recorded f=7.\n\nBut note: the expression for f: \n   f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n   At the state: l=3, r=3 -> 8 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 7.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if we have a case where we get a==b at multiple points? For example, if we have [1,1,1,1,1,1]:\n   Step1: a=1 (l=1) -> then Bob: b=1 (r=5-1=4) -> then a==b: f = 6 - 4 + 1 - 1 = 2? Actually, total=2.\n   Then we continue: \n        Now l=1, r=4 -> a<=b: so we add n[1] (which is 1) -> a=2, l=2 -> then a=2, b=1 -> so Bob: add n[4] -> b=2, r=3 -> then a==b: f = 6-3+2-1 = 4.\n   Then we continue: l=2, r=3 -> a<=b: add n[2] -> a=3, l=3 -> then a=3, b=2 -> Bob: add n[3] -> b=3, r=2 -> then a==b: f=6-2+3-1=6.\n   Then we break because l=3>r=2? Actually, l=3 and r=2 -> l>r -> break.\n\n   So we print 6.\n\nBut note: the maximum total is 6. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing part for program1.py is:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code has an elif block: \"elif b<a:\". We must add two lines: one to add the candy at r to b, and one to decrement r.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: \n  We are given n and then a list of n integers: b[1,n], b[2,n], ..., b[n,n].\n  We need to reconstruct an array a[1..n] such that if we build the matrix b as described, then the last column (b[1,n] to b[n,n]) matches the input.\n\nThe provided code:\na=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\nfor k in 0,1:\n    for i in range(19):\n        z=1<<i\n        for j in range(len(a)):\n            if j&z:\n                # TODO: Your code here\nprint(*reversed(a))\n\nWe note that the code is doing some bit manipulation and then finally prints reversed(a). So we are going to reverse a at the end? That means we are building a in reverse? Or the solution requires reversing?\n\nBut note: the problem says: output a1, a2, ... an. But if we reverse a at the end, then we are going to output a_n, a_{n-1}, ... a_1? \n\nBut the note example: \n   Input: n=3, and the last column: [0,2,1] (which are b[1,3], b[2,3], b[3,3]).\n   The example says: if a = [1,2,3] then the last column is [0,2,1]. So the input is [0,2,1] and we are to output [1,2,3].\n\nBut the code: \n   We read the input: the second line is split into a list of integers and stored in `a`.\n   Then we do some processing, then we print reversed(a).\n\nSo if we start with a = [0,2,1] (for n=3) and then we do some processing and then reverse to get [1,2,0]? That is not [1,2,3]. \n\nSo the processing must change the array a to [3,2,1] so that when reversed we get [1,2,3]? Or to [1,2,3] and then reversed becomes [3,2,1]? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be solved by building the array in reverse. \n\nBut note: the problem says: the archaeologists know b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... b_{n,n}. And we are storing these in the array `a` initially. Then we are going to transform `a` so that when we reverse it we get the desired a1, a2, ... an? \n\nAlternatively, the code might be solving for the array a in reverse order? \n\nLooking at the note: \n   The matrix b is built from a. The last column of the matrix (b_{i,n}) is given. We are to find a.\n\nThe recurrence:\n   b_{0,j} = a_j (for j from 1 to n) -> note: the problem says b_{0,i} = a_i for 1<=i<=n. So the first row (row0) is: [0, a1, a2, ..., an]? Actually, the matrix is 0-indexed. \n   Then:\n      b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\nWe are given: for i from 1 to n: b_{i,n} = (the given input at index i-1)\n\nWe need to recover a1, a2, ... an.\n\nThere is a known solution for this problem: \n   We can express the element b_{i,j} in terms of the array a. In fact, it is known that:\n      b_{i,j} = a_j XOR a_{j-1} ... ? \n\nBut note: \n   b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR a1 = a1.\n   b_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} = a1 XOR a2.\n   b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3.\n\n   Then b_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} = 0 XOR a1 = a1.\n   b_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} = a1 XOR (a1 XOR a2) = a2.\n   b_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} = a2 XOR (a1 XOR a2 XOR a3) = a1 XOR a3.\n\n   Then b_{3,1} = a1.\n   b_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2} = a1 XOR a2.\n   b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} = (a1 XOR a2) XOR (a1 XOR a3) = a2 XOR a3.\n\nWe observe that the element b_{i,j} is the XOR of a_{j} and a_{j-1} ... but with a pattern of binomial coefficients mod 2? \n\nActually, it is known that:\n   b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} binom(i, k) mod 2 * a_{j-k}   [if j-k>=1, otherwise 0?] \nBut note: the recurrence is linear and over GF(2). The pattern is that of the Sierpinski triangle.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the transformation from a to the last column (b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... b_{n,n}) is linear. \n\nBut note: the example: \n   a = [1,2,3] -> then the last column is [b_{1,3}, b_{2,3}, b_{3,3}] = [0,2,1]? \n   But from our calculation above: \n        b_{1,3} = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3 = 1^2^3 = 0? \n        b_{2,3} = a1 XOR a3 = 1^3 = 2? \n        b_{3,3} = a2 XOR a3 = 2^3 = 1? \n   So indeed: [0,2,1].\n\nSo we have:\n   b_{i,n} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} binom(i,k) mod 2 * a_{n - k}   [if we consider that the last column is at column n, so j=n, and we are using a_{n-k}]\n\nBut note: the binomial coefficient mod 2 is 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is a subset of that of i (i.e., i & k == k) -> actually, it is the other way: by Lucas theorem, binom(i,k) mod 2 is 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is a subset of i (i.e., k has 1 only in positions where i has 1). So we can write:\n\n   b_{i,n} = XOR_{k: k is a subset of i} a_{n-k}\n\nBut note: the indices: we are indexing a from 1 to n. And k runs from 0 to i. But when k>n, then we don't have a_{n-k}? Actually, we are only concerned with k<=i and n-k>=1? \n\nAlternatively, we can consider the transformation as:\n\n   Let c_k = a_{n-k} for k=0,...,n-1. Then the last column is:\n\n      b_{i,n} = XOR_{k: k is a subset of i and k<=n-1} c_k\n\nBut note: when i>=n, then k can be up to i, but we only have c_k for k in [0, n-1]. However, the problem says i from 1 to n. So i<=n, and k<=i<=n, so k<=n. But we defined c_k for k in [0, n-1]. So for k>=n, we don't have c_k? Actually, we don't. But note: if i has a bit beyond the range of the array? Then we ignore.\n\nBut the problem: we are given the vector (b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... b_{n,n}) and we want to recover c_0, c_1, ... c_{n-1} (which is a_n, a_{n-1}, ... a_1). \n\nThis is a linear system: \n\n   b = T * c\n\nwhere T is the matrix of the subset transform (the so-called \"subset transform\" in the boolean lattice) but for each row i (which is the characteristic vector of the subsets of i). \n\nBut note: the transformation T is invertible? And the inverse is the same transform? Actually, the Mobius transform for the subset lattice is the inverse? \n\nSpecifically, the transform:\n\n   b_i = XOR_{k subset of i} c_k\n\nis the so-called the fast Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform (for the subset lattice) in GF(2). And the inverse transform is:\n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset of i} mu(k,i) * b_k\n\nBut in GF(2), the Mobius function for the subset lattice is mu(k,i)=(-1)^{|i|-|k|} mod 2? But that is 1 if |i|-|k| is even, 0 if odd? Actually, in GF(2) the inverse transform is the same as the transform? \n\nWait: actually, the transform is its own inverse (up to scaling). But in GF(2), the transform:\n\n   T: c -> b, where b_i = XOR_{k subset i} c_k\n\nthen applying T twice: \n\n   (T^2)_{i,j} = sum_{k} T_{i,k} T_{k,j} = |{k: j subset k subset i}| mod 2.\n\nBut note: if j is not a subset of i, then 0. If j is a subset of i, then the number of k such that j subset k subset i is 2^{|i|-|j|}. This is 0 mod 2 if |i|-|j|>=1? Actually, no: 2^{anything} is 0 mod 2? But wait, 2^0=1, 2^1=0 mod2, 2^2=0 mod2, etc. So:\n\n   (T^2)_{i,j} = 1 if and only if i=j? \n\nBut if i=j, then |i|-|j|=0 -> 2^0=1 -> 1 mod2. \nIf j is a proper subset of i, then |i|-|j|>=1 -> 2^{>=1} mod2=0.\n\nSo T^2 = I. Therefore, the inverse transform is T itself.\n\nSo to recover c from b, we do:\n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset i} b_k\n\nBut note: in our case, the indices: we have defined:\n\n   Let c = [a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1]   (so c_0 = a_n, c_1 = a_{n-1}, ... c_{n-1}=a_1)\n\n   And we are given: \n        b_1 = b_{1,n} = c_? \n        Actually, for row i (which corresponds to b_{i,n}), we have:\n\n        b_{i,n} = XOR_{k subset i} c_k   ??? \n\nBut wait: in our derivation, we had:\n\n        b_{i,n} = XOR_{k: k is a subset of i} c_k   [where c_k = a_{n-k}]\n\nBut note: the index k in the subset runs from 0 to i. However, we defined c only for indices 0 to n-1. And i runs from 1 to n. \n\nBut note: the transformation is defined for all nonnegative integers? But we are only given b_i for i=1..n. And we want to recover c_0, c_1, ... c_{n-1}. \n\nWe can use the inversion:\n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset i} b_k   ... but note: we only know b_k for k=1..n. However, we also note that for k>n, we don't have b_k? But in our system, for k>n, we don't use? \n\nBut note: the inversion formula: \n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset i} b_k\n\nbut if i is in [0, n-1], then the subsets k of i are in the range [0, i] and i<=n-1, so k<=n-1. But we have b_k for k=1..n. However, we are missing b_0? \n\nWhat is b_0? The problem does not give b_{0,n}. But note: the problem says they know b_{i,n} for i=1..n. So we don't have b_0.\n\nBut note: in the transformation:\n\n   b_{0,n} = ? \n   From the recurrence: \n        b_{0,n} = a_n (by definition: b_{0,i}=a_i, so at i=n: b_{0,n}=a_n = c_0).\n\nBut we are not given b_{0,n}. However, we are trying to recover a, which includes a_n = c_0.\n\nBut the inversion formula for c_0:\n\n   c_0 = XOR_{k subset 0} b_k = b_0   (because the only subset of 0 is 0).\n\nBut we don't have b_0. So we must recover without it.\n\nAlternatively, note that the transformation for the given b_i (i>=1) and the unknown b_0? \n\nBut observe: the problem does not require the exact transformation? We can use the given b_i for i=1..n and the inversion formula for i>=1? \n\nActually, the inversion formula for c_i (for i>=1) involves b_0? \n\n   c_i = b_0 XOR (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} b_k)\n\nBut we don't know b_0. \n\nBut note: we have the equation for i=0: \n   c_0 = b_0.\n\nSo we can set: \n   c_0 = ?   (we don't know) \n   Then for i>=1: \n        c_i = c_0 XOR (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} b_k)\n\nBut we have n equations and n+1 unknowns (c_0 to c_{n-1} and b_0). \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire system is linear and we can solve for c_0 as well. But the problem says: output any array a or -1 if none. \n\nBut note: the transformation from a to the last column is linear and we have:\n\n   [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]^T = T' * [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]^T\n\nwhere T' is a n x n matrix? Actually, the transformation for b_i (i>=1) is:\n\n   b_i = XOR_{k subset i} c_k   for i=1,...,n.\n\nBut note: the index i runs from 1 to n, and k runs from 0 to i. But k must be in [0, n-1] (since c is defined only for 0..n-1). \n\nThis is a linear system of n equations in n unknowns (c_0, c_1, ... c_{n-1}). And the matrix is the subset matrix for the rows i=1..n and columns k=0..n-1. \n\nBut note: the matrix is lower triangular? And the diagonal: for row i, the variable c_i appears? Actually, k runs over subsets of i. The variable c_i is included only if i<=n-1? And for row i (which is an integer from 1 to n), the variable c_j appears for every j that is a subset of i and j in [0, n-1]. \n\nBut the matrix is not square? We have n equations and n unknowns. And the matrix is the incidence matrix of the subset relation for the set {0,1,...,n-1}. But note: the row index i runs from 1 to n, and the column index j runs from 0 to n-1. \n\nBut the row index i (which is an integer) can be seen as a bitmask? Actually, we can represent the integers as bit masks of up to ceil(log2(n)) bits. But note: n up to 500000 -> so we need about 19 bits.\n\nThe key: the transformation is invertible? \n\nActually, we can use the Mobius inversion: \n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset i} mu(k,i) * b_k\n\nBut as we said, in GF(2) the Mobius function for the subset lattice is: \n   mu(k,i) = (-1)^{|i|-|k|} mod 2? But that is 1 if |i|-|k| is even, 0 if odd? \n\nBut wait: the standard Mobius function for the subset lattice (in the incidence algebra of the boolean lattice) is: \n   mu(k,i) = (-1)^{|i\\k|} if k subset i, else 0.\n\nSo mod2: (-1)^{|i\\k|} = 1 if |i\\k| is even, and -1 (which is 1 mod2) if |i\\k| is odd? Actually, -1 mod2 is 1. So in GF(2), mu(k,i)=1 for every k subset i.\n\nTherefore, the inversion formula in GF(2) is:\n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset i} b_k\n\nBut note: this is the same as the forward transform. \n\nBut we have a problem: the inversion formula requires b_k for every k subset i. But we are given b_k only for k in the range [1, n]. However, note that for k>n, we don't have them? But if i<=n, then k (a subset of i) is at most i, so k<=n. So we have all the necessary b_k.\n\nBut what about k=0? The inversion formula for c_i includes k=0? \n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset i} b_k\n\nand k=0 is always a subset of i. But we are not given b_0.\n\nSo we must recover without b_0? \n\nBut note: the problem says: the archaeologists know b_{i,n} for i=1..n. So we don't have b_0. \n\nHowever, we can treat b_0 as an unknown. But then we have:\n\n   c_i = b_0 XOR (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} b_k)\n\nSo we have:\n\n   c_i = b_0 XOR d_i   where d_i = XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} b_k.\n\nBut we have one free variable b_0. \n\nBut note: we have n equations and n+1 unknowns? \n\nActually, we have n unknowns: c_0, c_1, ... c_{n-1} and b_0? But we have n equations? \n\nBut wait: the transformation for the last column gives n equations (for i=1..n). And we have n+1 unknowns: c_0,...,c_{n-1} and b_0. \n\nBut note: we also have the equation: \n   b_0 = c_0   (from the forward transform: b_0 = XOR_{k subset 0} c_k = c_0).\n\nSo we can write:\n\n   For i=1..n: \n        b_i = (XOR_{k subset i} c_k) = c_0 XOR (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} c_k)\n\nBut we can also write:\n\n   c_0 = b_0   (but we don't know b_0).\n\nAlternatively, we can express everything in terms of c_0? \n\nBut the system:\n\n   For i=1..n:\n        b_i = c_0 XOR (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} c_k)\n\nThis is a linear system in the unknowns c_0, c_1, ... c_{n-1}. And we have n equations and n unknowns. \n\nBut note: the matrix of the system is the subset matrix for the rows i=1..n and the columns k=0..n-1. And the column for k=0 is all ones? (because c_0 appears in every equation). \n\nBut we can solve by:\n\n   Let d_i = b_i XOR (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} c_k) \n   Then we have: d_i = c_0 for every i.\n\nBut that would imply that for every i, d_i is the same? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the known solution: \n\n   We can set c_0 arbitrarily? Then solve for the others? \n\nBut note: the inversion formula we derived earlier (without the b_0) is:\n\n   c_i = (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} b_k)   ??? \n\nBut that would be missing the b_0 term.\n\nHowever, observe: the forward transform:\n\n   b_i = c_0 XOR (XOR_{k subset i, k>=1} c_k)\n\nand the inversion formula we want is:\n\n   c_i = (XOR_{k subset i} b_k)   [which includes k=0]\n\nBut we don't have b_0. \n\nBut if we assume b_0=0, then we can compute:\n\n   c_i = XOR_{k subset i} b_k   [with b_0=0]\n\nBut then we have:\n\n   c_0 = b_0 = 0.\n\nBut is that consistent? \n\nLet me test with the example: \n   Given: b_1=0, b_2=2, b_3=1. (for n=3)\n\n   We want to recover c_0, c_1, c_2 (which are a3, a2, a1).\n\n   If we set b_0=0, then:\n\n      c_0 = XOR_{k subset 0} b_k = b_0 = 0.\n      c_1 = XOR_{k subset 1} b_k = b_0 XOR b_1 = 0 XOR 0 = 0.\n      c_2 = XOR_{k subset 2} b_k = b_0 XOR b_2 = 0 XOR 2 = 2.\n      c_3 = ? but we only need up to c_2 (since n=3, we have c_0, c_1, c_2).\n\n   Then a = [c_2, c_1, c_0] = [2,0,0] -> then reversed? The code prints reversed(a) -> [0,0,2]? \n\n   But we want [1,2,3]. \n\nAlternatively, the example solution: \n   We know that if a=[1,2,3] then c = [a3, a2, a1] = [3,2,1].\n\n   How do we get [3,2,1] from the inversion with b_0? \n\n   We need b_0 = c_0 = 3.\n\n   Then:\n      c_0 = 3.\n      c_1 = b_0 XOR b_1 = 3 XOR 0 = 3.\n      c_2 = b_0 XOR b_2 = 3 XOR 2 = 1.\n      c_3 = b_0 XOR b_1 XOR b_2 XOR b_3 = 3 XOR 0 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 0? \n\n   But we don't need c_3.\n\n   Then a = [c_2, c_1, c_0] = [1,3,3] -> reversed: [3,3,1] -> not [1,2,3].\n\nSo what is the correct approach?\n\nWe must use the inversion without assuming b_0? \n\nBut note: the provided code does:\n\n   a = [*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]   # so a[0] = b_{1,n}, a[1]=b_{2,n}, ... a[n-1]=b_{n,n}\n\n   for k in 0,1:\n        for i in range(19):\n            z=1<<i\n            for j in range(len(a)):\n                if j&z:\n                    # TODO\n\n   print(*reversed(a))\n\nThis looks like it is doing a fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWT) for the subset convolution, specifically the XOR transform? Or the OR transform?\n\nBut note: the condition: if j&z -> which is non-zero, meaning that the i-th bit is set in j.\n\nAnd the inner loop iterates j from 0 to len(a)-1.\n\nThis is typical for an in-place FWT for the OR transform (specifically the transform: T(f)[S] = sum_{T subset S} f[T]). \n\nBut in GF(2), the OR transform (also called the zeta transform for the subset lattice) is:\n\n   for each bit i from 0 to 18 (since 2^19>500000? n<=500000, so 19 bits is enough)\n        for each j in [0, len(a)-1]:\n            if the i-th bit is set in j, then we update a[j] by XORing a[j] with a[j without the bit]? \n\nBut the standard in-place FWT for the OR transform (forward) is:\n\n   for i in range(0, N):\n        for j in range(0, 1<<N):\n            if j has the i-th bit set:\n                a[j] += a[j^(1<<i)]   [in integer arithmetic]\n\nBut in GF(2), it would be XOR.\n\nAnd the inverse transform is the same? \n\nBut note: the forward OR transform (for the subset convolution) is:\n\n   T(f)[S] = sum_{T subset S} f[T]\n\nand the inverse transform is the Mobius transform:\n\n   f[S] = sum_{T subset S} (-1)^{|S\\T|} T(f)[T]   mod 2? \n\nBut in GF(2), (-1) is 1, so the inverse transform is the same as the forward transform? \n\nActually, we have: \n   T^2 = I? -> as we proved earlier, yes.\n\nSo the same code does both the forward and inverse.\n\nBut the provided code does two passes: for k in 0,1. And then for each bit i, and then for each j.\n\nThis is typical for doing the transform and then the inverse? \n\nBut note: we are given the vector b = [b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... b_{n,n}]. We want to recover c = [c_0, c_1, ... c_{n-1}].\n\nWe have: \n   b = T * c   (where T is the OR transform: b_i = XOR_{k subset i} c_k)\n\nSo to get c, we do: \n   c = T^{-1} * b = T * b   (because T^2 = I).\n\nSo we should apply the same transform T to the vector b to get c.\n\nBut the vector b we are given is of length n. But our indices: the vector b is indexed by i from 1 to n. But our transform is defined for all integers from 0 to (1<<ceil(log2(n)))-1. \n\nThe code uses an array `a` of length n. But we need to extend it to length N = 1<<ceil(log2(n))? \n\nBut the code does not extend the array. It iterates j from 0 to len(a)-1. \n\nSo we are doing the transform in-place on the array of length n.\n\nBut the transform requires that the array length is a power of two? \n\nThe problem: n up to 500000. We can set the length to 1<<19 = 524288? But the code does not extend the array. \n\nBut the provided code: \n   a = [*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]   -> length = n.\n\n   Then we do two passes (k in 0,1) and then for i in 0..18, and then for j in range(len(a)).\n\n   This will work if n is at most 1<<19? But n<=500000 < 1<<19? \n\n   However, the indices j in the array: we are using j as an integer in [0, n-1]. But the transform requires that we consider j as a bitmask. \n\n   The condition: if j has the i-th bit set -> then we do: \n        a[j] ^= a[j^z]   (if we are doing the standard FWT for OR in GF(2))\n\n   But note: j^z is j without the bit z. And we require that j^z is in the range [0, n-1]? \n\n   But if j is in [0, n-1] and we remove a bit, then j^z is also in [0, n-1]? \n\n   However, if j has the i-th bit set and j^z is beyond the length of the array? Then we would be accessing a[j^z] which is out of bounds? \n\n   But the array has length n. So we must extend the array to length 1<<19? \n\n   But the code does not extend. \n\n   Alternatively, we can do the transform only for indices in [0, n-1] and hope that j^z is in [0, n-1]? \n\n   But if j has the i-th bit set and j^z is less than j, then it is in the array? \n\n   However, if j^z >= n, then we skip? \n\n   But the standard FWT for OR transform for an array of size N (a power of two) is:\n\n        for i in range(0, log2(N)):\n            for j in range(0, N):\n                if j has the i-th bit set:\n                    a[j] ^= a[j^(1<<i)]\n\n   But if our array is not of length a power of two, we can still do the transform for the full bit length? \n\n   However, the indices j that are beyond n-1 are not available. \n\n   But the problem: we are given only n elements. \n\n   How to handle? \n\n   We must extend the array to the next power of two? \n\n   But the problem says: if there is no solution, output -1. \n\n   However, the provided code does not extend. \n\n   Let me read the code: it uses j in range(len(a)) and then condition on j&z. \n\n   So if j has the i-th bit set and j^z is within [0, len(a)-1]? But if j^z is >= len(a), then we would get an index out of bounds? \n\n   But the code does not check. \n\n   Therefore, we must extend the array to the smallest power of two >= n? \n\n   But the problem says: n up to 500000. The next power of two: 1<<19 = 524288.\n\n   But the provided code does not extend. \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be solved without extending? \n\n   But the example: n=3. We have a = [0,2,1] (the given b_{1,3}, b_{2,3}, b_{3,3}).\n\n   We want to recover c = [3,2,1] (which is [a3, a2, a1]). \n\n   How to do with the transform? \n\n   We have: \n        c = T * b   (because T^2 = I, so T(b) = T(T(c)) = c)\n\n   So we should apply the OR transform to the vector b to get c.\n\n   But we have b = [0,2,1] for indices 1,2,3. But our transform is defined for indices 0,1,2,3? \n\n   We are missing index0. \n\n   We can set: \n        Let v[0] = 0? \n        v[1] = 0, v[2]=2, v[3]=1.\n\n   Then apply the OR transform to v of length 4? \n\n   The OR transform for GF(2) for an array of length 4:\n\n        Step0 (bit0): \n            j=1: has bit0 set -> v[1] ^= v[0] -> v[1]=0^0=0.\n            j=2: skip bit0 (bit0 not set) -> skip.\n            j=3: has bit0 set -> v[3] ^= v[2] -> v[3]=1^2=3.\n        Step1 (bit1):\n            j=2: has bit1 set -> v[2] ^= v[0] -> v[2]=2^0=2.\n            j=3: has bit1 set -> v[3] ^= v[1] -> v[3]=3^0=3.\n\n        Then v = [0,0,2,3]\n\n   Then we want c = [v0, v1, v2, v3] = [0,0,2,3] -> then c_0=0, c_1=0, c_2=2, c_3=3.\n\n   Then a = [c_3, c_2, c_1] = [3,2,0]? -> then reversed(a) = [0,2,3]? \n\n   But we want [1,2,3]. \n\n   Alternatively, we note that the indices in the array v: \n        index0 -> corresponds to the integer 0 -> which in our system is b_{0,n}? \n        index1 -> corresponds to i=1? \n        index2 -> i=2? \n        index3 -> i=3? \n\n   And we want c_i = v_i.\n\n   Then a = [c_{n-0}?] -> we have n=3, so a1 = c_3, a2 = c_2, a3 = c_1? \n\n   But then a = [3,2,0] -> and the code prints reversed(a) = [0,2,3]. \n\n   But the example output is [1,2,3]. \n\n   What went wrong? \n\n   We must note: the array a we are to output is a1, a2, a3. \n   In our c: \n        c_0 = a_n = a3\n        c_1 = a_{n-1} = a2\n        c_2 = a_{n-2} = a1\n\n   So a1 = c_2, a2 = c_1, a3 = c_0.\n\n   Therefore, the array a = [c_2, c_1, c_0] = [2,0,0] from the transform above? \n\n   But we got c_0=0, c_1=0, c_2=2, c_3=3. \n\n   But we only need c_0, c_1, c_2 (because n=3, indices 0,1,2). \n\n   So a = [c_2, c_1, c_0] = [2,0,0] -> then reversed(a) = [0,0,2]? \n\n   This is not [1,2,3].\n\n   Alternatively, we should not have set v[0]=0. \n\n   How about we leave v[0] as unknown? \n\n   But the transform requires the entire vector from 0 to N-1.\n\n   Known solution from the example: \n        We are given b_{1,3}=0, b_{2,3}=2, b_{3,3}=1.\n        We want to find c such that:\n           c_0 = b_{0,3}   (unknown)\n           c_0 XOR c_1 = b_{1,3} = 0\n           c_0 XOR c_2 = b_{2,3} = 2\n           c_0 XOR c_1 XOR c_2 XOR c_3 = b_{3,3} = 1   [but we don't have c_3 because n=3, so we only have c_0, c_1, c_2]\n\n        So we have:\n           c_0 XOR c_1 = 0   -> c_1 = c_0\n           c_0 XOR c_2 = 2\n           c_0 XOR c_1 XOR c_2 = 1   [because c_3 is not used? but the equation for b_{3,3} should be: \n                b_{3,3} = c_0 XOR c_1 XOR c_2   (since 3 in binary is 11, and the subsets are 0,1,2,3, but we only have c_0, c_1, c_2 because c_3 is not defined? However, the recurrence uses only defined indices? \n\n        But wait: in the recurrence, for b_{3,n} we have:\n             b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3}\n             and we can compute from the recurrence without c_3? \n\n        Alternatively, in the formula: \n             b_{i,n} = XOR_{k subset i} c_k   for k in the range [0, n-1] (because c_k is only defined for k=0..n-1). \n\n        For i=3, the subsets of 3 that are in [0,2] are 0,1,2. \n\n        So the equation for i=3: c_0 XOR c_1 XOR c_2 = 1.\n\n        Then we have:\n           (1) c_0 XOR c_1 = 0\n           (2) c_0 XOR c_2 = 2\n           (3) c_0 XOR c_1 XOR c_2 = 1\n\n        From (1) and (3): \n             (c_0 XOR c_1) XOR c_2 = 1 -> 0 XOR c_2 = 1 -> c_2 = 1.\n        From (2): c_0 = 2 XOR c_2 = 2 XOR 1 = 3.\n        From (1): c_1 = c_0 = 3.\n\n        So c_0=3, c_1=3, c_2=1.\n\n        Then a = [c_2, c_1, c_0] = [1,3,3] -> and then reversed(a) = [3,3,1]? \n\n        But we want [1,2,3].\n\n        What is the orz then? \n\n        Alternatively, the array a should be [3,3,1]? \n        Let's build the matrix for a = [3,3,1]:\n            Row0: [0, 3, 3, 1]\n            b_{1,1} = 0 XOR 3 = 3\n            b_{1,2} = 3 XOR 3 = 0\n            b_{1,3} = 0 XOR 1 = 1\n            b_{2,1} = 0 XOR 3 = 3\n            b_{2,2} = 3 XOR 0 = 3\n            b_{2,3} = 3 XOR 1 = 2\n            b_{3,1} = 0 XOR 3 = 3\n            b_{3,2} = 3 XOR 3 = 0\n            b_{3,3} = 0 XOR 2 = 2\n\n        So the last column: b_{1,3}=1, b_{2,3}=2, b_{3,3}=2 -> not [0,2,1].\n\n        So this is not the example.\n\n        The example with a=[1,2,3] yields last column [0,2,1].\n\n        How to get a=[1,2,3] from the c? \n           c_0 = a3 = 3\n           c_1 = a2 = 2\n           c_2 = a1 = 1\n\n        Then the equations:\n           b_{1,3} = c_0 XOR c_1 = 3 XOR 2 = 1? but we want 0.\n           b_{2,3} = c_0 XOR c_2 = 3 XOR 1 = 2 -> matches.\n           b_{3,3} = c_0 XOR c_1 XOR c_2 = 3^2^1 = 0? but we want 1.\n\n        So it doesn't match.\n\n        What is the correct indexing for the subsets? \n\n        Let me recompute the example by the recurrence with a=[1,2,3]:\n\n        matrix b of size 4x4 (0-indexed: i=0..3, j=0..3)\n\n        Row0: [0, a1, a2, a3] = [0,1,2,3]\n        Column0: [0,0,0,0] (since b_{i,0}=0)\n\n        Then:\n          b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1.\n          b_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} = 1 XOR 2 = 3.\n          b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} = 3 XOR 3 = 0.\n\n          b_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1.\n          b_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} = 1 XOR 3 = 2.\n          b_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n          b_{3,1} = b_{3,0} XOR b_{2,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1.\n          b_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2} = 1 XOR 2 = 3.\n          b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} = 3 XOR 2 = 1.\n\n        So the last column (j=3) for i=1,2,3: [0,2,1] -> matches.\n\n        Now, how to express b_{i,3} in terms of a?\n\n        b_{1,3} = 0 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3? = 1^2^3=0 -> yes.\n        b_{2,3} = 2 = a1 XOR a3? = 1^3=2 -> yes.\n        b_{3,3} = 1 = a2 XOR a3? = 2^3=1 -> yes.\n\n        So the formula: \n             b_{i,n} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} binom(i,k) mod 2 * a_{n-k} \n        is not exactly as above. \n\n        Instead, we see that the weight for a_j in b_{i,n} is 1 if the number of times it is XORed is odd. \n\n        How to see the pattern? \n\n        We can see that the recurrence is: \n             b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n        This is the same as:\n             b_{i,j} = b_{i-1,j} XOR b_{i,j-1}\n\n        This is the same as the number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) in a grid, and the XOR over a path, and then XOR over all paths? \n\n        In GF(2), it is the parity of the number of times the value a_j is XORed over the paths.\n\n        It is known that the number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) is binom(i+j, i). And then the value a_j is included in b_{i,j} if and only if there is a path from (0,0) to (i,j) that goes through the edge (0, j) to (0, j+1) for the a_j? \n\n        Actually, the value a_j is at (0,j). It is included in b_{i,j} if there is a path from (0,j) to (i,j) and then from (i,j) to (i,n)? \n\n        Alternatively, we can see that the value a_j is included in b_{i,n} if and only if the number of paths from (0,j) to (i,n) is odd. \n\n        The number of paths from (0,j) to (i,n) is binom(i+n-j-1, i) [because we need to move i down and n-j right]. \n\n        So the condition: binom(i+n-j-1, i) mod 2 = 1.\n\n        By Lucas, this is 1 if and only if the binary representation of i is a subset of the binary representation of i+n-j-1. \n\n        This is not the same as the subset of i.\n\n        Therefore, the initial approach may be flawed.\n\n Given the complexity and the provided code structure, I think the intended solution is to use the following:\n\n   We are given: \n        b_{i,n} for i=1..n.\n\n   We know that:\n        b_{i,n} = XOR_{j=1}^{n} [ binom(i+n-j-1, i-1) mod 2 ] * a_j\n\n   In GF(2), multiplication by 1 means include, 0 means exclude.\n\n   And binom(i+n-j-1, i-1) mod 2 = 1 if and only if the binary representation of (i-1) is a subset of the binary representation of (i+n-j-1) - (i-1) = n-j.\n\n   Wait, not exactly. \n\n   Actually, by Lucas, binom(n, k) mod 2 = 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is a subset of the binary representation of n.\n\n   So binom(i+n-j-1, i-1) mod 2 = 1 if and only if the binary representation of (i-1) is a subset of the binary representation of (i+n-j-1).\n\n   Let k = i-1, then = binom(k+1+n-j-1, k) = binom(k+n-j, k) mod 2 = 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is a subset of the binary representation of k+n-j.\n\n   This is not the same as the subset of i.\n\n Given the complexity, and the fact that the provided code does a double loop over bits and indices, it is likely that the intended solution is to use a Walsh-Hadamard transform or something similar.\n\n However, there is a known solution for this problem: \n\n   [0,2,1] -> [1,2,3]\n\n   and the solution in C++ from a known submission for the same problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        int n, a[500000];\n        int main() {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n            for (int i = 0; i < 19; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (j >> i & 1) a[j] ^= a[j ^ (1<<i)];\n                }\n            }\n            for (int i = 0; i < 19; i++) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (j >> i & 1) a[j ^ (1<<i)] ^= a[j];\n                }\n            }\n            for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) printf(\"%d \", a[i]);\n        }\n\n But this outputs: \n        For n=3, a = [0,2,1] (given) -> then after the first loop (forward transform) and then the second loop (inverse transform) and then reversed, we get the array a.\n\n Let me simulate for n=3, a = [0,2,1] (index0=0, index1=2, index2=1) (note: the last element in the array is b_{n,n}=b_{3,3}=1, but in the array a[2]=1).\n\n The code in the first pass ( for i in 0..18, for j in 0..2):\n\n   i=0 ( bit0=1<<0=1)\n        j=0: 0&1=0 -> skip.\n        j=1: 1&1=1 -> a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1]=2^0=2.\n        j=2: 2&1=0 -> skip.\n\n   i=1 ( bit1=2)\n        j=0: skip.\n        j=1: skip (1 in binary is 01, so bit1 is not set) -> wait, 1 in binary has only bit0.\n        j=2: 2 in binary is 10, bit1 is set -> a[2] ^= a[0] ( because 2^2=0) -> a[2]=1^0=1.\n        j=3: not in [0,2] -> skip.\n\n   Then a = [0,2,1]\n\n   Then the second pass ( for i in 0..18, for j in 0..2):\n\n   i=0:\n        j=0: skip.\n        j=1: has bit0 -> a[0] ^= a[1] -> a[0]=0^2=2.\n        j=2: skip.\n\n   i=1:\n        j=0: skip.\n        j=1: skip.\n        j=2: has bit1 -> a[0] ^= a[2] -> a[0]=2^1=3.\n\n   Then a = [3,2,1]\n\n   Then for i in n-1 downto 0: print a[i] -> prints: 1,2,3.\n\n   So the array a after the second pass is [3,2,1] and then reversed (printed from last to first) yields 1,2,3.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        for k in 0,1:   # two passes\n            for i in range(19):   # 19 bits\n                z = 1<<i\n                for j in range(len(a)):\n                    if j & z:\n                        if k == 0: \n                            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n                        else:\n                            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But wait, in the C++ code, the second pass does:\n        if (j >> i & 1) a[j ^ (1<<i)] ^= a[j];\n\n   So in the second pass, the roles are swapped: we update the lower index by XORing the higher index.\n\n   Therefore, in the provided code, the TODO is to do the XOR in one of two ways depending on k.\n\n   Specifically:\n        for k in 0,1:\n            for i in range(19):\n                z=1<<i\n                for j in range(len(a)):\n                    if j&z:\n                        if k == 0:\n                            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n                        else:\n                            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But note: the provided code has only one TODO inside the if j&z. \n\n   We can do:\n\n        if not k: \n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   However, the C++ code for the second pass does for j in range(n) and if the bit is set, then it updates a[j^z] by XORing a[j]. \n\n   But in our loop, j is the index. We must ensure that j^ is within bounds? The C++ code assumes the array has size at least the next power of two? \n\n   But in the example, n=3, and for j=2 (which is within [0,2]), and z=2, then j^z=0, which is within bounds.\n\n   For j=3, we don't have it because the loop is only to n-1.\n\n   But if n is not a power of two, then for j that has the i-th bit set and j^z >= n, then we would be accessing out of bounds. \n\n   Therefore, we must extend the array to the next power of two? \n\n   The problem: n up to 500000. We can extend the array to 1<<19 = 524288.\n\n   But the provided code does not extend. \n\n   The C++ code does not extend either. It only iterates j in [0, n-1]. \n\n   However, if j is in [0, n-1] and j has the i-th bit set, then j^ might be >= n? \n\n   For example, if n=3 and j=3, then we would access a[3] which is out of bounds. \n\n   Therefore, we must have the array size to the next power of two. \n\n   But the input only gives n integers. \n\n   The problem: if we extend, what to put in the extended indices? \n\n   We can put 0. \n\n   Because the transform in GF(2) with 0's for the extended indices is safe. \n\n   Therefore, we should extend the array to length = 1<<19.\n\n   But the provided code does not extend. \n\n   We must add code to extend the array. \n\n   However, the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n   The missing code is only the TODO part. \n\n   But the TODO part might assume the array is extended? \n\n   Alternatively, the condition in the inner loop: for j in range(len(a)): and then if j&z, then we do a[j] ^= a[j^z]. \n\n   If j^ is within [0, len(a)-1], then it's safe. If not, then we skip? \n\n   But the C++ code does not skip. It assumes the array is large enough. \n\n   Therefore, to be safe, we should extend the array before the loops. \n\n   But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n   And the missing code is only the TODO part. \n\n   We are allowed to output only the TODO part. \n\n   But then the code might crash for j such that j^ is out of bounds. \n\n   How about we do the following in the TODO: only do the XOR if j^ is within the bounds. \n\n   But the standard solution in C++ for this problem (from known submissions) extends the array to 1<<19. \n\n   For example: \n\n        int n;\n        cin >> n;\n        vector<int> a(1<<19,0);\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n\n   then do the loops.\n\n   Therefore, the provided code in the problem is not safe. \n\n   Since the problem says: output only the missing code, and the missing code is the TODO part, we must output the code for the TODO without changing the array. \n\n   But then we risk out of bounds. \n\n   Alternatively, note that for j in [0, n-1] and for z up to 1<<18 (which is 262144) and n up to 500000, then j^ might be in [0, n-1] because j and j^ only differ in one bit. For example, if j has the bit set, then j^ is j without the bit, which is less than j, and hence in [0, n-1] (because j is in [0, n-1]). \n\n   Is that true? \n\n   For example, j= (1<<18) + 1, then j is about 262145, which is < 500000. Then j^ ( by removing the bit 1<<18) becomes 1, which is in bounds. \n\n   For the highest bit that is set in j, removing it will yield a number less than j, and hence in [0, n-1] because the loop is for j in range(n) and we are at j. \n\n   Therefore, j^ is always in [0, j] and hence in [0, n-1]. \n\n   So it is safe. \n\n   Therefore, the TODO code is:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But wait, the provided code has:\n\n        for k in 0,1:\n            for i in range(19):\n                z=1<<i\n                for j in range(len(a)):\n                    if j&z:\n                        # TODO\n\n   We need to do either one or the other based on k.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But note: in the second pass (k=1), the C++ code does: a[j ^ (1<<i)] ^= a[j]. \n   In our code, for a given j that has the bit z set, we are to update the lower index (j^z) by XORing a[j].\n\n   Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n        if not k:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But note: the condition on k: k=0 for the first pass, k=1 for the second pass.\n\n   So in code:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is these two lines.\n\n   However, the TODO is inside the if j&z and then the for loops. \n\n   We must be careful: in the else branch, we are writing to a[j^z]. This is safe because j^z is less than j and hence in the array (since j is in the array).\n\n   Let me test with the example in the provided code structure for program2.py:\n\n   We are given: a = [0,2,1] (n=3)\n\n   for k in 0,1:\n        for i in range(19):  # i=0 to 18, but only i=0 and i=1 matter because 1<<1=2 and 1<<2=4>3.\n            for j in range(3): # j=0,1,2\n\n   k=0 (first pass)\n      i=0, z=1:\n          j=0: 0&1=0 -> skip.\n          j=1: 1&1=1 -> a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1]=2^0=2.\n          j=2: 2&1=0 -> skip.\n      i=1, z=2:\n          j=0: 0&2=0 -> skip.\n          j=1: 1&2=0 -> skip.\n          j=2: 2&2=2 (non-zero) -> a[2] ^= a[0] (because 2^2=0) -> a[2]=1^0=1.\n      so a = [0,2,1] -> no change.\n\n   k=1 (second pass)\n      i=0, z=1:\n          j=0: skip.\n          j=1: has bit0 -> a[0] ^= a[1] -> a[0]=0^2=2.\n          j=2: skip.\n      i=1, z=2:\n          j=0: skip.\n          j=1: skip.\n          j=2: has bit1 -> a[0] ^= a[2] -> a[0]=2^1=3.\n      so a = [3,2,1]\n\n   Then print(*reversed(a)): \n        reversed(a) = [1,2,3] -> prints \"1 2 3\"\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But note: the provided code has the TODO inside the if j&z and then the for j and for i and for k.\n\n   We output only the missing code.\n\n   So for program1.py: the missing code is two lines: \n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   For program2.py: the missing code is an if-else with two XOR assignments.\n\n   But note: the TODO in program2.py is only in the if j&z block. We are to replace the TODO with the if-else.\n\n   However, the TODO is in a for loop that is for k in 0,1, then for i, then for j, then if j&z.\n\n   We output the code that goes in place of the TODO.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the completion is:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But note: the code must be indented properly. Since the TODO is at the level of the if, we assume the same indentation.\n\n   In the provided code, the TODO is at the same indentation as the if j&z.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But wait, in the provided code for program2.py, after the if j&z there is a comment and then we have to put code. We put the above code.\n\n   However, the above code is two lines for the if and two for the else, and we must be careful with the indentation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write in one line? \n\n   But it is two assignments.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above.\n\n   But note: the variable is `a`, and we are using `j` and `z`.\n\n   This is the code.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\",\n     \"program2\": \"if k == 0:\\n                a[j] ^= a[j^z]\\n            else:\\n                a[j^z] ^= a[j]\"\n   }\n\n   But note: the program1 code: we are in the elif block, so we are at the same indentation level as the comments. We output two lines with the same indentation.\n\n   For program2: we are inside the for j loop and inside the if j&z. We need to indent the if-else by the same amount as the TODO. In the provided code, the TODO is at the same level as the if j&z. So we add one more level of indentation for the if-else and the assignments.\n\n   In the provided code for program2, the TODO is at the level of the if j&z, so we should have:\n\n        if j&z:\n            if k == 0:\n                a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n            else:\n                a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   So the missing code is the if-else block.\n\n   Therefore, we output the if-else block with an extra indentation.\n\n   But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n   We output the code that should be placed in the TODO.\n\n   In the TODO, we replace the comment with the if-else.\n\n   So the completion for program2 is the string:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   with each line indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n   In the provided code, the TODO is at a certain indentation level. The if-else should be at that same level. \n\n   But the if-else is a single block. \n\n   Alternatively, we can write without newlines? \n\n   But the problem does not require that.\n\n   We output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\n   Therefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n        if k == 0:\n            a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n        else:\n            a[j^z] ^= a[j]\n\n   But note: in the provided code, the for j loop is for j in range(len(a)): and then if j&z: and then the TODO. \n\n   We are to replace the TODO with the above code.\n\n   So the above code should be placed exactly at the TODO.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above.\n\n   But the program1 missing code is two lines: \n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   However, in the provided code for program1, the TODO is in the elif block and there is a comment. We replace the comment with these two lines.\n\n   So the completion for program1 is:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   But note: the first line is adding the candy at index r to b, and the second line decrements r.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer."
