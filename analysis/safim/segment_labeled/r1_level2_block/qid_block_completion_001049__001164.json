We can write:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n      (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n      ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n      (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a) But note: the set `solutions` might already contain a, but that's okay. However, what about a=1 and a=2? They are in the initial set. The divisors we consider in the loop are at least 2 (from the range starting at 2) and then a = i or div, which are at least 2. So we won't add 1 again. And a=2 might be added again, but the set will handle duplicates. But the sample (3,5) works: \n   a=2: \n        w%2=1, l%2=1 -> condition4: 1 and 1 -> true -> add 2 (but already there). a=3:\n        condition2: w%3=0 and (l-2)%3= (5-2)=3 -> 3%3=0 -> true -> add 3. So the set becomes {1,2,3}. Another sample: (4,4)\n   half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6. divisors: i=2: 6%2==0 -> div=3. a=2: \n        w%2=0, l%2=0 -> condition1: true -> add 2 (already there). a=3:\n        w%3=1, l%3=1 -> condition4: true -> add 3.\n   a=6: \n        from i= floor(sqrt(6)) is 2, so we get a=6 from div=6//2=3? no, we only get a=2 and a=3. But 6 is also a divisor of 6. How do we get a=6? We iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6))=2. Then we get i=2, and then a in [2, 3]. We miss 6?",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is the length if the sum is positive, negative of the length if the sum is negative, and 0 if the sum is zero.\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum sum. The missing part is updating the dictionary `dmx` in the loop.\n\nIn the loop for i from 1 to n:\n    dp[i] is computed as the maximum of three possibilities:\n        1. i + pfen.max(ordpos[i])   [from positive prefix sums?]\n        2. nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i [from negative prefix sums?]\n        3. dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)   [if we have seen the same prefix sum before?]\n\nThen we update the Fenwick trees. After that, we have:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should update `dmx[pref[i]]` to be dp[i] because we want to remember the best dp value for the prefix sum `pref[i]` so that in the future we can use it.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the dictionary `dmx` is initialized with `dmx[0] = 0` (for prefix[0]=0 at index0).\n\nTherefore, the missing line in program1.py is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about tiling a bathroom floor. The bathroom has dimensions w x l. The interior uses (w-2)*(l-2) 1x1 tiles. The boundary uses 1xa tiles (which can be rotated). We are to find all positive integers a for which the tiling is possible.\n\nThe provided code initializes a set `solutions` with {1,2}. Then it iterates over factors of `half_perimeter = w + l - 2` (which is the total length of the boundary? Actually, the boundary has two sides of length w and two of length l, but the corners are shared. So the total boundary length is 2*(w+l-2) in terms of 1x1 units? However, note that the problem says the boundary is tiled with 1xa tiles. But the total number of 1x1 units on the boundary is: w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4.\n\nBut note: the problem states that the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). Then the boundary tiles are the rest: total = w*l, so boundary = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4.\n\nHowever, the variable `half_perimeter` is defined as w+l-2. Why half? Actually, the boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l-2) (if we consider the corners only once). But note: the boundary is a rectangle. The total length of the boundary (in terms of edges) is 2*(w+l) but we have 4 corners? Actually, the boundary is made of 4 sides: two of length w and two of length l. However, the tiles are placed along the boundary. The total number of 1x1 squares on the boundary is 2*(w+l)-4 (because each corner is shared by two sides, and we subtract 4 corners that are counted twice). But note: 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2). So the entire boundary has 2*(w+l-2) squares. Therefore, the total boundary must be divisible by a. So a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). However, the code uses `half_perimeter = w+l-2` and then iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter`? Actually, it iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter` and then also considers the divisor of the entire boundary? \n\nBut note: the boundary is 2*(w+l-2). So the divisors of the entire boundary are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2). However, the code only iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter = w+l-2`. Then for each divisor i of `half_perimeter`, it considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. But then it also checks a condition on w mod a? \n\nThe problem has several ways to arrange the tiles on the boundary. The key is that the boundary is a cycle and we have four corners. The tiles of size 1xa must cover the entire boundary without gaps. The known solutions are a=1 and a=2. Then we consider divisors of the entire boundary? Actually, the entire boundary length is 2*(w+l-2). So a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). However, the code uses `half_perimeter = w+l-2` and then iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter`? That would only cover divisors of half_perimeter, but we also have divisors that are factors of 2*(w+l-2) that might not be factors of (w+l-2) if they include the factor 2? \n\nBut note: the code also includes 2 in the initial set. Then in the loop, for each divisor i of `half_perimeter`, it considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. However, we must also consider divisors that are factors of 2*(w+l-2) that are not factors of (w+l-2). \n\nAlternatively, we can factor 2*(w+l-2). But the problem constraints are high (w,l up to 1e9) and the total output is at most 200000 integers, so we can factor the number 2*(w+l-2) by iterating up to sqrt(2*(w+l-2)). However, the current code iterates only up to sqrt(half_perimeter). \n\nBut note: the code does:\n    for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n        then for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n            ... check condition ...\n\nThis misses divisors that are factors of 2*(w+l-2) but not of (w+l-2). So we must also consider the factor 2? \n\nActually, the problem has multiple ways to arrange the tiles at the corners. The known arrangements that work are:\n\n1. The entire boundary is covered by 1xa tiles. The boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l-2). So a must divide 2*(w+l-2). \n\nBut there are also geometric constraints: at the corners, the tile must be placed such that it covers the corner and then extends along one side. There are several cases:\n\nCase 1: a divides the entire boundary and also the side lengths in a way that the corners are covered appropriately.\n\nThe known arrangements that work are:\n\na) a divides w-1 and l-1? Actually, the problem has been studied in known similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problems). The valid a are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that satisfy one of the following:\n\nCondition 1: The boundary can be covered if we can cover the four corners without conflict. There are a few patterns:\n\nPattern 1: a divides w and a divides l? Actually, no, because the boundary is 2*(w+l-2). But we have to check the arrangement.\n\nActually, the known solution for the problem (from similar problems) is to consider the divisors of the entire boundary length (which is 2*(w+l-2)) and then check one of the four conditions:\n\nCondition 1: The boundary can be split into four segments (the four sides) and we require that the length of each side (w and l) modulo a is either 0 or 1? Actually, the problem note shows that for (3,5): a=1,2,3 work.\n\nLet's analyze (3,5):\n    Boundary length = 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. Divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nBut the example says only 1,2,3 are valid.\n\nWhy 4 is not valid? \n    If a=4, then we need to cover 12 units with 12/4=3 tiles. But the arrangement: \n        The two sides of length 3: each must be covered by one tile? But 3 mod 4 = 3 -> we cannot cover 3 with a tile of length 4? \n        Alternatively, we can cover two adjacent sides together? \n\nActually, the boundary is a cycle. We can cover the boundary by going around. But the problem is that the tile must be 1xa and can be rotated, meaning it can be placed horizontally or vertically. However, the corners must be covered by the ends of two tiles.\n\nThere are four critical points: the four corners. The tile that covers a corner must be placed such that it covers the corner and then extends along one side. The next tile then starts at the next unit. \n\nThe conditions that must be satisfied for a divisor a:\n\n1. The entire boundary length 2*(w+l-2) must be divisible by a.\n\n2. Additionally, the arrangement must be possible. There are two main arrangements (and symmetric ones) that work:\n\nArrangement 1: \n    - The two sides of width w: one side is covered by tiles that leave a gap of 0 or 1 at the end? Actually, we have:\n\nWe can break the boundary into four segments: \n    Segment 1: from (0,0) to (w,0) [length w]\n    Segment 2: from (w,0) to (w,l) [length l]\n    Segment 3: from (w,l) to (0,l) [length w]\n    Segment 4: from (0,l) to (0,0) [length l]\n\nBut note the corners are shared. So the segments are actually of length w-1, l-1, w-1, l-1? \n\nAlternatively, the entire boundary is a cycle of 2*(w+l-2) units. \n\nThe known conditions (from known problems) are that a is valid if at least one of the following holds:\n\n(a) w mod a == 0 and l mod a == 0   -> but wait, then the entire floor would be covered by a x a tiles? Not exactly.\n\nActually, we have to cover the boundary. The conditions that are known from the problem \"Bath Tile\" (Codeforces) are:\n\nCondition 1: a divides w-1 and l-1? \nCondition 2: a divides w-2 and l? \nCondition 3: a divides w and l-2?\nCondition 4: a divides gcd(w-1, l-1) and then the entire boundary? \n\nBut note the example: w=3, l=5, a=1,2,3.\n\nFor a=1: trivial.\n\nFor a=2: \n    Condition 1: w-1=2, which is divisible by 2; l-1=4, divisible by 2 -> so condition 1 holds? \n    Condition 2: w-2=1, not divisible by 2 -> fails condition2? \n    Condition 3: l-2=3, not divisible by 2 -> fails condition3? \n    Condition 4: gcd(2,4)=2, and 2 divides 2 -> condition4? \n\nBut actually, condition1 is: a divides w-1 and a divides l-1? Then condition1 holds for a=2.\n\nFor a=3:\n    Condition1: w-1=2 not divisible by 3 -> fails.\n    Condition2: w-2=1 not divisible by 3 -> fails.\n    Condition3: l-2=3 divisible by 3, and w=3 divisible by 3? -> condition3: a divides w and a divides l-2? -> 3 divides 3 and 3 divides 3 -> holds.\n\nSo we have two conditions: condition1 and condition3.\n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to consider the divisors of the entire boundary (which is 2*(w+l-2)) and then check one of the four conditions:\n\nCondition A: (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) -> but this is too strong? \n\nAlternatively, we have four cases:\n\nCase 1: The corner at (0,0) is covered by a tile going along the bottom and then the next tile going along the left? Actually, we can model the boundary as a cycle and the tile placements must align at the corners. The known conditions are:\n\n1. The remainder when covering the sides:\n\nWe require that the boundary can be partitioned into four contiguous segments (the four sides) such that the length of each segment is divisible by a? But the entire boundary is divisible by a, so that is already satisfied. However, the problem is that the corners are shared by two tiles. \n\nActually, the known solution (from Codeforces problems with the same name) is to check:\n\n- a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2) (the entire boundary length) and one of the following must hold:\n\n  (i) w % a == 0 and l % a == 0   -> but this is not necessary? \n\nActually, the known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round #707 (Div. 2), problem C) is:\n\nThe valid a (apart from 1 and 2) are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that satisfy one of the following:\n\n  (a) w % a == 0 and l % a == 2 % a   [but note: 2 mod a might be 2 if a>2, but we are in integers] -> actually, we require that the residues at the corners work.\n\nBut the known conditions are:\n\n  Condition 1: a divides w-2 and a divides l? -> then we can cover the bottom and top with tiles that run the full width (so w is divisible by a) and the sides with tiles that leave 2 units at the top and bottom? Actually, no.\n\nAfter checking known solutions for \"Bath Tile\", the conditions are:\n\n  Condition 1: a divides (w-2) and a divides (l) -> but then the entire boundary? \n\nActually, the solution is to check four conditions:\n\n  Condition 1: a divides (w-2) and a divides (l) -> but then the boundary? \n\nAlternatively, we can have:\n\n  Condition 1: a divides (w) and a divides (l-2)\n  Condition 2: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n  Condition 3: a divides (w-2) and a divides (l)   -> but then the entire boundary? \n  Condition 4: a divides (w) and a divides (l)   -> but then the entire boundary? \n\nBut note: the boundary is 2*(w+l-2). If a divides the entire boundary, then we don't need to check divisibility of the sides? \n\nThe key is that the boundary is a cycle. The arrangement must allow the tiles to cover the four sides without gaps. The four conditions correspond to four ways to assign the corners to the tiles:\n\n  Type 1: The four corners are each covered by two tiles (so each corner is the meeting point of two tiles). Then the entire boundary is covered by tiles that run along the sides. This requires that the length of each side (minus the corners) is divisible by a? Actually, the side of length w has two corners, so the length to cover is w (but the two corners are shared) -> so the side of length w requires w - 2 * (overlap) ... \n\nActually, the known solution from a known code for this problem (Codeforces) is:\n\n  Let total = 2*(w+l-2)\n  Then the set of valid a is the divisors d of total such that:\n\n      (w % d == 0 and l % d == 0) OR\n      (w % d == 0 and (l-2) % d == 0) OR\n      ((w-2) % d == 0 and l % d == 0) OR\n      (w % d == 1 and l % d == 1)   [but note: if d=1, then 1 divides everything, but we already have 1] \n\nBut wait, the example (3,5): \n    d=1: \n        w%1=0, l%1=0 -> true.\n    d=2:\n        w%2=1 -> not 0 -> skip first condition.\n        w%2=1 -> skip second condition.\n        (w-2)%2 = 1%2=1 -> skip third condition.\n        w%2=1, l%2=1 -> true for the fourth condition? -> so d=2 is valid.\n    d=3:\n        w%3=0, l%3=2 -> skip first condition.\n        w%3=0 and (l-2)%3=3%3=0 -> true for the second condition -> valid.\n    d=4: \n        w%4=3 -> skip first condition.\n        w%4=3 -> skip second condition.\n        (w-2)%4=1 -> skip third condition.\n        w%4=3, l%4=1 -> not both 1 -> skip fourth condition -> invalid.\n\nBut the example says a=1,2,3 are valid. So the conditions above would yield 1,2,3.\n\nHowever, note that the divisor d must be a divisor of total=2*(w+l-2)=12. The divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. We then check each divisor against the four conditions. We must avoid duplicates.\n\nBut note: the initial set in the code is {1,2}. Why 2? Because the problem says that the output for the first test case is 1,2,3. But the code already has 1 and 2. Then in the loop we add 3? \n\nBut the code currently iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter = w+l-2` (which is 3+5-2=6). The divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6. Then for each divisor i, we consider a=i and a=6//i. Then we check:\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            ... \n\nBut what is the condition? The code currently only checks if w mod a <= 2. Then it does something? \n\nActually, the code is incomplete. The TODO part is missing.\n\nLooking at the known solution for the problem (from Codeforces submissions), one common approach is:\n\n  total = 2*(w+l-2)\n  factors = set()\n  for x in [w, w-1, w-2, l, l-1, l-2]:\n      for f in factorize(x):   # but we are factoring the entire boundary? \n          ... \n\nBut the problem constraints are high, so we factor the entire boundary? \n\nAlternatively, we can iterate over the divisors of total and then check the four conditions. But the total boundary length is 2*(w+l-2) which can be up to 4e9, and factoring that for 100 test cases (each with up to 200000 divisors) might be too heavy? \n\nBut note: the problem says the total output is at most 200000 integers. So the total number of divisors over all test cases is at most 200000. Therefore, we can factor the entire boundary for each test case and then check the conditions.\n\nHowever, the provided code does not factor the entire boundary. It factors `half_perimeter = w+l-2` and then considers the divisors of that. But the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). So the divisors of the entire boundary are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2). We can get them by:\n\n  divisors = set()\n  n = 2*(w+l-2)\n  for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n))+1):\n      if n % i == 0:\n          divisors.add(i)\n          divisors.add(n//i)\n\nThen we check each divisor a (with a>=1) against the four conditions.\n\nBut the problem: the initial code already has 1 and 2 in the set. Why? Maybe because the factorization loop starts at 2? Then we add 1 and 2 initially. But then we can factor the entire boundary and add all divisors that satisfy one of the conditions.\n\nBut the problem says the total output integers are at most 200000, so we can do that.\n\nHowever, the provided code structure is:\n\n  solutions = {1,2}\n  for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n      if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n      div = half_perimeter // i\n      for a in [i, div]:\n          mod_a = w % a\n          if mod_a <= 2:\n              ...   # then what? \n\nThis is incomplete. We must check the conditions for a. Also, note that a might be 1 or 2 again? So we should avoid duplicates.\n\nBut the set `solutions` is a set, so duplicates are avoided.\n\nWhat is the condition? The code checks `mod_a = w % a` and then if `mod_a <= 2`. But that is not sufficient. We must check one of the four conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the condition in the code might be checking one of the conditions? \n\nBut the known conditions are:\n\n  Condition1: (w % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)\n  Condition2: (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n  Condition3: ((w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)\n  Condition4: ((w-1) % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0)\n\nBut note: condition4 is equivalent to (w % a == 1) and (l % a == 1).\n\nSo we can check:\n\n  if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n      solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the entire boundary must be divisible by a? Actually, we are iterating over divisors of `half_perimeter` (which is w+l-2) and then considering a = i and a = div. But the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). If a divides half_perimeter, then 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * (half_perimeter) is divisible by a? Not necessarily: if a is even, then 2*(w+l-2) is divisible by a only if a divides 2*(w+l-2). But if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then a divides half_perimeter, so 2*(w+l-2) is divisible by a if and only if a divides 2*(w+l-2). But note: 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. So if a divides half_perimeter, then 2 * half_perimeter is divisible by a? Yes, because half_perimeter = k * a, so 2 * half_perimeter = 2*k*a -> divisible by a.\n\nTherefore, if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then a divides the entire boundary. So we only need to check the geometric conditions.\n\nBut what about divisors that are factors of 2*(w+l-2) but not of (w+l-2)? For example, if a=4 and w+l-2=6, then 2*(w+l-2)=12, which is divisible by 4, but 4 does not divide 6. So we would miss a=4.\n\nTherefore, we must factor the entire boundary 2*(w+l-2). \n\nBut the problem says the total output integers are at most 200000, so we can factor 2*(w+l-2) for each test case. However, the worst-case number of divisors for a number around 4e9 is about 2000, and 100 test cases would be 100*2000=200000 divisors, which matches the output limit.\n\nSo we should change the code to factor the entire boundary: total_boundary = 2*(w+l-2). Then iterate over all divisors of total_boundary, and for each divisor a (>=1), check one of the four conditions. Then add a to the set.\n\nBut the provided code structure is different: it already has a set `solutions` initialized with {1,2} and then iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter` (w+l-2). We must extend it to factor the entire boundary.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we cannot change the entire structure. We must complete the provided code.\n\nLooking at the provided code:\n\n  solutions = {1, 2}\n  for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n      if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n      div = half_perimeter // i\n      for a in [i, div]:\n          mod_a = w % a\n          if mod_a <= 2:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO part is missing. And then after the loop, we output the solutions.\n\nBut the condition `mod_a <= 2` is not sufficient. We must check the four conditions. Also, we are missing divisors that are factors of 2*(w+l-2) but not of (w+l-2). \n\nBut note: the initial set has 1 and 2. The divisor 2 might be a divisor of the entire boundary even if it is not a divisor of half_perimeter? For example, if half_perimeter is odd, then 2 does not divide half_perimeter, but the entire boundary is 2*(odd) -> divisible by 2. So we must also consider the factor 2 of the entire boundary.\n\nTherefore, we should factor the entire boundary. But the problem says we cannot change the entire code, only fill in the missing part.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter   # = 2*(w+l-2)\n  Then factor total_boundary? \n\nBut the code does not do that. \n\nGiven the constraints, we must output the missing code for the provided structure. But the provided structure is insufficient. \n\nRe-examining the problem: the known solutions for the sample (3,5) are 1,2,3. The provided code initializes solutions with {1,2}. Then in the loop for half_perimeter=6, it will iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2. Then i=2: 6%2==0 -> div=3. Then for a in [2,3]:\n   For a=2: mod_a = 3 % 2 = 1 -> which is <=2 -> then we do something? \n   For a=3: mod_a = 3 % 3 = 0 -> <=2 -> then we do something.\n\nBut what do we do? We should add a to the set? But then we would add 2 and 3. But 2 is already in the set. So we add 3. Then the set becomes {1,2,3}. That matches.\n\nBut is that sufficient? What about a=4? For (3,5): a=4 is not valid, so we don't want it. But what about a=6? \n   a=6: mod_a = 3 % 6 = 3 -> which is not <=2 -> skip.\n\nSo a=6 is skipped. \n\nBut is the condition `w % a <= 2` sufficient? \n\nLet's test a=3 for (3,5): \n   Condition1: 3%3=0, 5%3=2 -> not 0 -> fails.\n   Condition2: 3%3=0, (5-2)=3 -> 3%3=0 -> holds.\n   So valid.\n\nBut the condition in the code is: if w % a <= 2 -> 3%3=0<=2 -> true. Then we add a? \n\nBut the TODO part is missing. We haven't added a to the set. \n\nSo the TODO part should be: add a to the set `solutions`.\n\nBut then we would add a=2 and a=3. But a=2 is already in the set. So we add a=3.\n\nBut is the condition `w % a <= 2` sufficient for the geometric condition? \n\nConsider a=4 for (4,4): \n   half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6 -> divisors: 2,3,6. \n   a=4 is not in the divisors of 6? So we wouldn't consider it. \n   But the entire boundary is 2*(4+4-2)=12, which is divisible by 4. \n   Conditions for (4,4):\n        Condition1: 4%4=0, 4%4=0 -> valid.\n   So a=4 should be valid.\n\nBut our current method would not consider a=4 because 4 is not a divisor of 6. \n\nTherefore, the provided code is flawed. It only considers divisors of half_perimeter, but we need divisors of the entire boundary (2*(w+l-2)). \n\nGiven the problem constraints on the output size, we must change the approach. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to factor the entire boundary. But the provided code does not. \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200000 integers.\" \n\nSo we can change the factorization to factor the entire boundary. However, the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nBut the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n  data = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n  res = []\n  for w, l in zip(data[::2], data[1::2]):\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n      solutions = {1, 2}\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n          div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n          if mod_i != 0:\n              continue\n          for a in [i, div]:\n              mod_a = w % a\n              if mod_a <= 2:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n      res.append(f\"{len(solutions)} {' '.join(map(str, sorted(solutions)))}\")\n  print('\\n'.join(res))\n\nWe cannot change the factorization to the entire boundary because that would be a large change. \n\nAlternatively, we can extend the factorization to include the factor 2. That is, consider the entire boundary = 2 * half_perimeter. Then the divisors of the entire boundary are the divisors of half_perimeter and twice the divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut note: not exactly. The divisors of 2*half_perimeter include:\n   the divisors of half_perimeter, and \n   the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2 (if half_perimeter is even, then there might be overlap).\n\nBut we can do:\n\n   total = 2 * half_perimeter\n   divisors = set()\n   # get divisors of total\n   i = 1\n   while i * i <= total:\n        if total % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(total//i)\n        i += 1\n\n   for a in divisors:\n        if a < 1: continue\n        # check one of the four conditions\n\nBut then we wouldn't need the initial set {1,2} and the factorization of half_perimeter.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code, not to rewrite the entire loop.\n\nGiven the dilemma, I suspect that the intended solution in the provided code is to only consider the divisors of half_perimeter and then also consider the factor 2 separately. \n\nIn fact, the initial set has 1 and 2. Then the loop considers divisors of half_perimeter (which are >=2). For each divisor i of half_perimeter, we consider a=i and a= half_perimeter//i. Then for each a, we check if w % a <= 2. If so, we then also check if the other condition on l holds? \n\nThe TODO part might be to check the condition on l and then add a to the set.\n\nBut what condition on l? \n\nWe have four conditions. We could check:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 or w % a == 1 or w % a == 2) and (l % a == 0 or l % a == 1 or l % a == 2) and ... \n\nBut that is not the four conditions.\n\nAlternatively, we can check the four conditions explicitly in the TODO part:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: a might be 1 or 2, which are already in the set, but adding them again is harmless.\n\nHowever, the condition `mod_a = w % a <= 2` is already checked. This condition is necessary because the residues we care about are 0,1,2. But it is not sufficient. We must also check the condition on l.\n\nTherefore, the TODO part might be:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the condition (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1) is not covered by `w % a <= 2` and `l % a` might be anything? We are not checking l % a in the if condition above the TODO. \n\nAlternatively, we can remove the `if mod_a <= 2` and then do the four conditions. But the problem says to output only the missing code.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the condition `mod_a = w % a <= 2` is already there. It is an optimization to avoid checking the four conditions for every divisor? Because if w % a > 2, then none of the conditions can hold? \n\nLet's see the conditions:\n\n   condition1: w % a == 0 -> requires mod_a=0.\n   condition2: w % a == 0 -> mod_a=0.\n   condition3: (w-2) % a == 0 -> which is equivalent to (w % a - 2) % a == 0, but if w % a = r, then (r-2) mod a = 0 means r=2? \n        because if r-2 is divisible by a, and 0<=r<a, then r-2 must be 0 -> r=2.\n   condition4: w % a == 1.\n\nSo the residues we care about are 0, 1, 2. Therefore, if w % a > 2, then none of the conditions can hold. So the initial check `if mod_a <= 2` is a filter.\n\nThen in the TODO part, we can check the four conditions and add a if any holds.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the condition for (w-2) % a == 0 is equivalent to w % a == 2? (if a>2, then w % a=2 implies (w-2) % a=0). But if a<=2, then we have to be cautious. However, a>=2 because the loop starts at i>=2, and then a can be 1 if we consider the entire boundary? But wait, we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter, and a>=2. And the initial set already has 1 and 2. So a>=2 in the loop. Therefore, for a>=2, (w-2) % a == 0 if and only if w % a == 2.\n\nSo we can also write:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or (w % a == 2 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the condition (l-2) % a == 0 is equivalent to l % a == 2 (for a>=2) only if a>2. If a=2, then (l-2) % 2 = l % 2. But we can write in terms of residues.\n\nHowever, the condition as stated is clear.\n\nBut there is one more issue: the entire boundary must be divisible by a? In the provided code, we are only iterating over divisors of half_perimeter, and then a divides half_perimeter, so 2*(w+l-2) is divisible by a? \n   Since a divides half_perimeter, then half_perimeter = k * a, so 2 * half_perimeter = 2 * k * a -> divisible by a.\n\nTherefore, the divisibility of the boundary by a is guaranteed.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the condition (l-2) % a == 0 might be written as (l % a == 2) for a>2, but for a=2, (l-2) % 2 = l % 2. So we must use the modulo operation on (l-2). Similarly, (w-2) % a == 0.\n\nWe can write:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n      (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n      ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n      (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the set `solutions` might already contain a, but that's okay.\n\nHowever, what about a=1 and a=2? They are in the initial set. The divisors we consider in the loop are at least 2 (from the range starting at 2) and then a = i or div, which are at least 2. So we won't add 1 again. And a=2 might be added again, but the set will handle duplicates.\n\nBut the sample (3,5) works: \n   a=2: \n        w%2=1, l%2=1 -> condition4: 1 and 1 -> true -> add 2 (but already there).\n   a=3:\n        condition2: w%3=0 and (l-2)%3= (5-2)=3 -> 3%3=0 -> true -> add 3.\n\nSo the set becomes {1,2,3}.\n\nAnother sample: (4,4)\n   half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6.\n   divisors: i=2: 6%2==0 -> div=3.\n   a=2: \n        w%2=0, l%2=0 -> condition1: true -> add 2 (already there).\n   a=3:\n        w%3=1, l%3=1 -> condition4: true -> add 3.\n   a=6: \n        from i= floor(sqrt(6)) is 2, so we get a=6 from div=6//2=3? no, we only get a=2 and a=3. \n        But 6 is also a divisor of 6. How do we get a=6? \n        We iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6))=2. Then we get i=2, and then a in [2, 3]. \n        We miss 6? \n\nThe code currently does:\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n        div = half_perimeter // i\n        for a in [i, div]:\n\nThis will not include the divisor 6 because i=2, then div=3, and then a=2 and a=3. But 6 is not included.\n\nWe should also include the divisor 1 and the number itself? But the initial set has 1 and 2. And we are iterating from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter). This is a standard factorization loop that gets all divisors. But note: we are not including 1 and half_perimeter itself? \n   We start at i=2, so we miss i=1. But then we would get a in [1, half_perimeter] from i=1? \n\nThe loop should start at 1. But it starts at 2. And the initial set has 1 and 2. So we have 1. And we have 2 from the initial set. But what about the divisor half_perimeter itself? \n   For half_perimeter=6, we want to consider a=6. \n   In the loop, when i=2, we get div=3, so we consider a=2 and a=3. \n   We do not consider a=6.\n\nTherefore, we should change the loop to start at 1 and go to int(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1, and then also include 1 and half_perimeter. But the initial set already has 1 and 2. And the problem says to output only the missing code.\n\nGiven the time, and since the problem sample (4,4) requires a=6? \n   For (4,4): \n        entire boundary = 2*(4+4-2)=12. \n        Conditions for a=6:\n            condition1: 4%6=4, 4%6=4 -> not 0 -> fail.\n            condition2: 4%6=4, (4-2)=2 -> 2%6=2 !=0 -> fail.\n            condition3: (4-2)=2%6=2 !=0 -> fail.\n            condition4: 4%6=4, 4%6=4 -> not 1 -> fail.\n        So a=6 is not valid.\n\nTherefore, we don't need a=6 for (4,4). \n\nBut what about a=4 for (4,4)? \n   a=4: \n        condition1: 4%4=0, 4%4=0 -> valid.\n   But how do we get a=4? \n        half_perimeter=6, and 4 is not a divisor of 6. \n   So we miss a=4.\n\nThis is the flaw: we only consider divisors of half_perimeter, but a=4 is a divisor of the entire boundary (12) and satisfies the condition, but not a divisor of half_perimeter.\n\nTherefore, the provided approach in the code is insufficient. \n\nGiven the problem constraints on the output size, we must factor the entire boundary. But the problem says to output only the missing code.\n\nWe are in a bind. \n\nPerhaps the intended solution in the provided code is to also consider the factor 2 explicitly. That is, for each divisor a of half_perimeter, we also consider 2*a? \n\nBut then we would get a=4 for (4,4) from a=2 (which is in the initial set) -> then consider 2*2=4.\n\nSo we could do:\n\n   for a in [i, div, 2*i, 2*div]:\n\nBut then we might get duplicates and also might get non-divisors of the entire boundary? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   for factor in [i, div]:\n        for mult in [1,2]:\n            a = factor * mult\n            if total_boundary % a == 0:   # which is always true if a is a divisor of half_perimeter? because then a divides half_perimeter, and then 2*half_perimeter is divisible by a only if a<=2*half_perimeter, which it is. But if mult=2, then a=2*factor, and then 2*half_perimeter = 2 * (half_perimeter) = 2 * (k * factor) = k * (2*factor) -> divisible by a.\n            then check the conditions.\n\nBut then we would get a=4 from factor=2 and mult=2.\n\nSo for (4,4): \n   half_perimeter=6, divisors: i=2 -> factor=2, then mult=2 -> a=4.\n   Then check: w=4, a=4: mod_a=0<=2 -> true.\n   Then check the conditions: condition1: 4%4=0 and 4%4=0 -> true -> add 4.\n\nSo the set becomes {1,2,4}. But we also have i=3: factor=3, then mult=2 -> a=6, which we saw is not valid, so we don't add.\n\nBut what about a=3? \n   from factor=3, mult=1: a=3 -> valid for (4,4)? \n        condition4: 4%3=1, 4%3=1 -> true -> add 3.\n\nSo the set becomes {1,2,3,4}. But is a=3 valid for (4,4)? \n   Conditions: \n        condition4: (4%3=1 and 4%3=1) -> valid.\n   And the entire boundary 12 is divisible by 3 -> valid.\n\nTherefore, the valid a for (4,4) are 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut the initial set has 1,2. Then we add 3 and 4.\n\nSo the approach is: for each divisor i of half_perimeter (starting from 1 would be better, but we start at 2), we consider a = i, half_perimeter//i, 2*i, 2*(half_perimeter//i). \n\nBut the initial set has 1 and 2. We start the loop at i=2. We miss the divisor i=1. For i=1, we would get a=1 and a=half_perimeter, and then also 2 and 2*half_perimeter. \n   a=1: already in the set.\n   a=half_perimeter: new.\n   a=2: already in the set.\n   a=2*half_perimeter: new.\n\nSo we should start the loop at i=1. But the loop currently starts at 2. \n\nWe can change the loop to start at 1. But the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nAlternatively, we can include i=1 explicitly. But the TODO part is inside the loop.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem sample (3,5) only requires a=3 and we got it, and (4,4) requires a=3 and a=4, and we can get a=4 from i=2 and mult=2, and a=3 from i=3 and mult=1, it might work.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py might be to consider both a and 2*a for each divisor found.\n\nBut note: the TODO part is inside the inner for-loop for a in [i, div]. \n\nWe can do:\n\n   for b in [a, 2*a]:\n        if we haven't considered b, and b is at least 1, and then check the conditions.\n\nBut then we might add many duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   candidates = set()\n   for i in range(2, ...):\n        if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n            div = half_perimeter // i\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                candidates.add(a)\n                candidates.add(2*a)\n\n   for a in candidates:\n        if a < 1: continue\n        if the entire boundary (2*half_perimeter) % a != 0: \n            continue\n        if w % a <= 2 and ... # the conditions\n\n But again, we are not allowed to change the structure.\n\nGiven the time, and since the problem sample (3,5) works with the current structure (without 2*a) and (4,4) requires 4 which is 2*2, and 2 is in the initial set, we might not need to change the loop. \n\nBut how do we generate a=4 in the loop for (4,4)? \n   half_perimeter=6.\n   i=2: then a in [2,3] -> then for a=2, we consider 2*a=4.\n   i=3: then a in [3,2] -> then for a=3, we consider 2*a=6.\n\n So in the TODO part, after checking a, we also consider b=2*a.\n\n Therefore, the missing code might be:\n\n   # For a\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n   # For 2*a\n   b = 2 * a\n   if (w % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 0 and (l-2) % b == 0) or ((w-2) % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 1 and l % b == 1):\n        solutions.add(b)\n\n But note: the entire boundary might not be divisible by b? \n        b = 2*a, and a is a divisor of half_perimeter, so half_perimeter = k * a.\n        Then the entire boundary = 2 * half_perimeter = 2 * k * a = k * (2*a) -> divisible by b.\n\n Therefore, it is.\n\n Let's test (4,4) for a=2 and b=4:\n   a=2: \n        condition1: 4%2=0, 4%2=0 -> true -> add 2 (already there).\n   b=4: \n        condition1: 4%4=0, 4%4=0 -> true -> add 4.\n\n For a=3 and b=6:\n   a=3: \n        condition4: 4%3=1, 4%3=1 -> true -> add 3.\n   b=6: \n        conditions: \n            4%6=4, 4%6=4 -> condition1: fail.\n            4%6=4, (4-2)%6=2 -> fail.\n            (4-2)%6=2 -> fail.\n            4%6=4, 4%6=4 -> not 1 -> fail. -> skip.\n\n So we add 3 and 4.\n\n Therefore, the set becomes {1,2,3,4} for (4,4).\n\n But note: the initial set has 1 and 2. We add 2 again (harmless) and then add 3 and 4.\n\n However, what about a=1 in the loop? We start at i=2, so we miss a=1. But we have it in the initial set.\n\n And a= half_perimeter=6? We would get it from a=3 and then b=6, but we skip 6 because it doesn't meet the conditions.\n\n Therefore, the missing code in the TODO part is:\n\n   conditions = [\n        (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0),\n        (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0),\n        ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0),\n        (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1)\n   ]\n   if any(conditions):\n        solutions.add(a)\n   # Now consider b = 2*a\n   b = 2 * a\n   conditions_b = [\n        (w % b == 0 and l % b == 0),\n        (w % b == 0 and (l-2) % b == 0),\n        ((w-2) % b == 0 and l % b == 0),\n        (w % b == 1 and l % b == 1)\n   ]\n   if any(conditions_b):\n        solutions.add(b)\n\n But note: the condition (l-2) % a == 0 might be written as (l-2) % a == 0, which is the same as l % a == 2 for a>2, but we use the modulo operation.\n\n However, for a=2, (l-2) % 2 = l % 2, because (l-2) mod 2 = l mod 2.\n\n This should be fine.\n\n Let's test (3,5) for a=2 and a=3:\n   a=2: \n        conditions for a=2:\n            condition1: 3%2=1, 5%2=1 -> not (0,0) -> false.\n            condition2: 3%2=1 -> not 0 -> false.\n            condition3: (3-2)=1 -> 1%2=1 -> not 0 -> false.\n            condition4: 3%2=1 and 5%2=1 -> true.\n        -> add 2 (already there).\n        then b=4: \n            conditions for b=4:\n                condition1: 3%4=3, 5%4=1 -> fail.\n                condition2: 3%4=3 -> fail.\n                condition3: (3-2)=1%4=1 -> fail.\n                condition4: 3%4=3, 5%4=1 -> not both 1 -> fail.\n        -> skip.\n   a=3:\n        conditions for a=3:\n            condition2: 3%3=0 and (5-2)=3 -> 3%3=0 -> true.\n        -> add 3.\n        then b=6:\n            conditions for b=6:\n                condition1: 3%6=3, 5%6=5 -> fail.\n                condition2: 3%6=3 -> fail.\n                condition3: (3-2)=1%6=1 -> fail.\n                condition4: 3%6=3, 5%6=5 -> fail.\n        -> skip.\n\n This works.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is as above.\n\n But note: the condition for condition3 is ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0), not ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) -> wait, it is written correctly.\n\n However, note that the condition for condition3 in the code is ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0). We must ensure the parentheses.\n\n So the code for the TODO part is:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n   b = 2 * a\n   if (w % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 0 and (l-2) % b == 0) or ((w-2) % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 1 and l % b == 1):\n        solutions.add(b)\n\n But note: a might be 1, then b=2. But a>=2 in the loop, so b>=4? No, a>=2, so b>=4. But the initial set has 1 and 2, so we are not worried about duplicates for b=2.\n\n However, if a=1 appears, it would be from the initial set, and we are not in the loop for a=1.\n\n This should work.\n\n But note: the divisor might be very large? For example, if half_perimeter is large, then a might be large, and 2*a might be larger than the entire boundary? \n        But the entire boundary is 2*half_perimeter, and a is a divisor of half_perimeter, so a<=half_perimeter, then 2*a<=2*half_perimeter, which is the boundary. So it is within the range.\n\n Therefore, we output this.\n\nSummary:\n\nFor program1.py: the missing line is \n   dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nFor program2.py: the missing block is:\n\n   if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n        solutions.add(a)\n   b = 2 * a\n   if (w % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 0 and (l-2) % b == 0) or ((w-2) % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 1 and l % b == 1):\n        solutions.add(b)\n\nBut note: the condition for (w-2) % a == 0 might be written as (w-2) % a == 0, which is correct.\n\nLet's write it in a way that fits in the code.\n\nHowever, note that the variable `a` might be 0? But a is at least 2 in the loop, and then b=2*a>=4, so no division by zero.\n\nWe output the code as a string.\n\nBut the problem requires JSON output.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\\n            solutions.add(a)\\n        b = 2 * a\\n        if (w % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 0 and (l-2) % b == 0) or ((w-2) % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 1 and l % b == 1):\\n            solutions.add(b)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the TODO part in program2.py is inside the inner for-loop and after the condition `if mod_a <= 2`. So the code becomes:\n\n   for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n            if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1):\n                solutions.add(a)\n            b = 2 * a\n            if (w % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 0 and (l-2) % b == 0) or ((w-2) % b == 0 and l % b == 0) or (w % b == 1 and l % b == 1):\n                solutions.add(b)\n\nBut note: the condition `mod_a = w % a <= 2` is a necessary condition for the four conditions to have a chance to hold, as explained. So it is safe to do the four conditions only when this holds.\n\nHowever, for the case of b=2*a, we do not check `w % b <= 2`. Should we? \n   The residues for b might be 0,1,2 or more. But the four conditions for b only care about residues 0,1,2 (because for condition3: (w-2) % b == 0 means w % b = 2, and condition4: residue 1). So if w % b > 2, then the conditions fail. Therefore, we could also check `if w % b <= 2` for efficiency. But the problem does not require efficiency, and the total number of divisors is not too large.\n\n We will not add that filter for b.\n\n Therefore, the above is the missing code.\n\n But note: the condition for b might be heavy if b is large, but the total number of divisors is limited.\n\n Let's output the code."
