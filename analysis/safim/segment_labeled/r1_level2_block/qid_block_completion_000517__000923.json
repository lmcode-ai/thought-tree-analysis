Actually, we are building the pattern from white.\n\n Alternate approach: we can think of the process as starting from white and applying a series of operations that set two adjacent cells to either (R,B) or (B,R). But note that if we stamp a cell multiple times, it flips: \n   For example, if we stamp a cell that is currently R with a stamp that puts B on it, then it becomes B. But note: the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So the operations are not independent.\n\n However, note constraints: total n over test cases <= 10^5. We need an efficient solution.\n\n Insight: \n   - The entire process can be broken down by contiguous non-white segments. Why?\n   - Because white cells are never stamped, so they break the picture into independent segments.\n\n Steps:\n   Split the string s by 'W'. Then each contiguous segment of non-white (which may be R and B) must be independently checkable.\n\n For a contiguous segment (without any W) of length L:\n   What are the necessary conditions?\n   - Since we start with white, and we can only stamp adjacent pairs, the entire segment must be built by overlapping stamps.\n\n   Note: the stamp operation always changes two adjacent cells. Moreover, the entire segment must be covered by stamps (if we ignore the possibility of multiple stamping on the same cell, but note that we can overstamp).\n\n   However, note that we can overstamp. So the problem becomes: can we assign to each cell a sequence of stamp operations such that the final color is achieved?\n\n   Another insight: \n     Consider the entire segment. The stamping operation is linear? Actually, we can model the color as a state that flips with each stamp? \n\n   Let's assign a variable to each cell: the number of times the stamp covers the cell (mod 2) for red and blue? But note: the stamp always applies two colors: one red and one blue. However, the color of a cell is determined by the parity of the number of times it has been stamped as red and blue? Actually, the stamp operation on a pair (i, i+1) does:\n        cell i: if it was stamped as the first color (say R) then that operation contributes R to i and B to i+1? But note the stamp can be applied in two ways: \n          Way1: (i: R, i+1: B)\n          Way2: (i: B, i+1: R)\n\n   So we can think: let x_i be the number of times the stamp has been applied starting at i (so covering i and i+1) and also the type? Actually, we can model the color at position i as:\n        color_i = (number of stamps that start at i-1 and are applied as BR? plus stamps that start at i and are applied as RB? ...) -> too messy.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the problem is symmetric in R and B? Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n   Let f(i) be the number of times a stamp has covered the cell i (regardless of the orientation). Then the color of the cell i is:\n        If we start with white (which we can consider as 0), then:\n          Each stamp that covers i and is applied as (R on i, B on i+1) or (B on i, R on i+1) will flip the color of i.\n\n        But note: the stamp that starts at i-1 (covering i-1 and i) and the stamp that starts at i (covering i and i+1) both cover i.\n\n        However, the color is determined by the parity of the total number of stamps that cover i? And also the orientation? Actually, if we let:\n          Let a_i be the number of stamps that start at i (so covering i and i+1) and are applied as BR (so i becomes B, i+1 becomes R) and b_i the number of stamps that start at i and are applied as RB (so i becomes R, i+1 becomes B).\n\n        Then the color at i is:\n          Initially: W (which we can think of as 0 mod 2 for both R and B? but we have two colors)\n\n        Actually, we can assign:\n          Let x_i = (number of stamps that start at i-1 and are applied as BR) \n                  + (number of stamps that start at i-1 and are applied as RB) \n                  ... but wait, the two types have opposite effects? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a two-state system. However, note that the problem is known and there is a simpler combinatorial condition.\n\n   Known solution for similar problems: \n        Conditions for a contiguous segment (without W) to be valid:\n          1. The segment must have at least two cells? Actually, a segment of length 1: can we make a single non-white cell? \n             - The stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So we cannot stamp a single cell. Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible? \n             - But note: we can stamp a segment that includes the single cell and a neighbor? However, the segment is contiguous non-white and we are considering independently. But if we have a segment of length 1, then that cell must be white? because we never stamped it? But wait: the segment is non-white. So if we have a segment of length 1 that is non-white, it's invalid.\n\n          2. Actually, the problem states: \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells\" meaning we can only stamp two adjacent cells that are entirely within the array. So we cannot stamp a single cell.\n\n        Therefore, any contiguous non-white segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n        What about longer segments?\n          We note that the entire segment must be covered by stamps? But note: we can stamp multiple times and overlapping arbitrarily.\n\n        Alternate known solution (from known problems like this, e.g., Codeforces problems):\n          - The entire string must be broken into segments by W. For each segment:\n            * If the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n            * Also, we must be able to assign the colors in the segment. The necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n                + The segment must have at least one red and one blue? Actually, no: consider \"RR\" -> is that valid?\n                How to form \"RR\": \n                  Start with WW -> we can stamp the two: \n                    If we stamp as BR: then we get B R -> not RR.\n                    If we stamp as RB: then we get R B -> not RR.\n                  Then we stamp again? But note we can stamp the same pair again: \n                    Stamping the same pair again: \n                      If we stamp the pair (which is currently R and B) as RB: \n                         The first cell: originally R, then we stamp with RB: the stamp sets the first cell to R? But wait, the stamp operation sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. So if we stamp again, we can change the colors arbitrarily? \n\n                  Actually, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells\". So if we stamp a pair that is currently (R, B) with the stamp RB, then we set the first to R and the second to B. So it remains the same. \n                  If we stamp with BR: then we set the first to B and the second to R. So we get (B, R). \n\n                  Then if we stamp again with BR: we set the first to B and the second to R? but wait, we can also stamp overlapping? \n\n                  How to get RR? \n                    We have two adjacent cells. We can do:\n                      Step1: stamp the two as RB: becomes (R, B)\n                      Step2: then stamp the first cell with the left neighbor? But the left neighbor might be outside the segment? \n\n                  Actually, we can only stamp within the segment? But note: the segment is contiguous non-white. We can stamp any two adjacent within the segment.\n\n                  How about: \n                    We have two cells: [0,1]\n                    We stamp at position 0 as RB: [R, B]\n                    Then we stamp at position 0 again as BR: [B, R] -> then we have B and R, not RR.\n\n                  Alternatively, we can do:\n                    We have two cells: \n                      Stamp at 0 as RB: [R, B]\n                    Then we stamp at 0 as RB again: [R, B] -> same.\n\n                  It seems we cannot get two R's? \n\n          Therefore, we must have at least one R and one blue? \n\n          But consider: \n            \"RR\" -> invalid? \n            \"BB\" -> invalid?\n            \"RB\" -> valid? (one stamp)\n            \"BR\" -> valid? (one stamp)\n            \"RBR\" -> valid? \n              How: \n                We can do:\n                  Start: WWW\n                  Stamp the first two as RB: R B W\n                  Stamp the last two as BR: R B (then stamp the last two: but note we want RBR) -> if we stamp the last two as BR: then the second becomes B and the third becomes R -> so we have R B R -> which is RBR? \n\n          Actually, we can also do:\n            Stamp the middle two? but we have three cells: positions 0-1 and 1-2.\n\n          How about \"RRB\":\n            We can do:\n              Stamp at 1 (covering index1 and 2) as RB: then we have W, R, B -> then we stamp at 0 (covering 0 and 1) as RB: then we get R, B, B -> not RRB.\n\n          Alternatively, \n            Stamp at 0 as RB: R, B, W\n            Stamp at 1 as BR: R, R, B -> that's RRB.\n\n          So \"RRB\" is valid.\n\n          What is the pattern? \n            In a contiguous segment, we can achieve any coloring as long as:\n              - The segment length is at least 2? (so no segment of length 1)\n              - And the entire segment is not all the same color? Actually, we just saw \"RRB\" is valid and has two R's and one B. But what about \"RRR\"?\n\n          How to get \"RRR\" (three R's)? \n            We have three cells: \n              We can do:\n                Step1: stamp at 0 as RB: [R, B, W]\n                Step2: stamp at 1 as RB: [R, R, B] -> then we have R, R, B -> not RRR.\n                Step3: then stamp at 1 again as BR: [R, B, R] -> not RRR.\n                Step4: then stamp at 0 as BR: [B, R, R] -> then stamp at 0 again as RB: [R, B, R] -> still not.\n\n          Alternatively:\n            Step1: stamp at 0 as RB: [R, B, W]\n            Step2: stamp at 0 as RB again: [R, B, W] -> same as step1.\n\n          How about:\n            Step1: stamp at 1 as BR: [W, B, R]\n            Step2: stamp at 0 as RB: [R, B, R] -> then we have R, B, R -> not RRR.\n\n          It seems we cannot get three R's? \n\n          But note: we can overstamp arbitrarily. However, the operation is linear? \n\n          Actually, we can model the problem as a system of linear equations mod 2? \n\n          Let the segment be of length L. We have L cells. We have L-1 possible stamp positions (from 0 to L-2). \n          For each stamp position i, we can choose two types: \n            Type0 (RB): sets cell i to R, cell i+1 to B.\n            Type1 (BR): sets cell i to B, cell i+1 to R.\n\n          But note: we are starting from white (which we can consider as 0) and then each stamp operation adds (mod 2) a vector? \n\n          However, the colors are not additive. Actually, the stamp operation overwrites the color? The problem says \"recolors\", meaning it sets the color to the stamp's color. \n\n          But note: we can stamp multiple times. The final color of a cell is the color from the last stamp that covered it? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify the order of stamping? And stamps can overlap arbitrarily. \n\n          Actually, the problem is equivalent to: we can assign to each stamp position an integer (nonnegative) for type0 and type1? But that would be too many variables.\n\n   Known solution from Codeforces: \n        After reading the note: \n          \"In the first test case, ...\" and the examples, and known similar problems (e.g., \"Stamp Painting\" but not exactly), a known solution is:\n\n          We break the string by 'W'. For each contiguous segment of non-W:\n            - If the segment length is 1, then it's impossible -> return \"NO\".\n            - Also, if the segment has only one type of color (only R or only B), then it's impossible? \n\n          Why? Because the stamp always produces one R and one B in each application. Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one R and one B.\n\n          But wait: we can have multiple stamps. However, if we have a segment of all R's, then consider:\n            Each stamp operation must cover two adjacent cells. In the entire segment, every stamp operation must have been applied an even number of times? because if a stamp operation is applied an odd number of times, then it would introduce a B? \n\n          Actually, if we have a segment of all R's, then for each stamp operation (say at position i) we must have applied it an even number of times? because if we apply a stamp operation at i an odd number of times, then the two cells i and i+1 would be set to either (R,B) or (B,R) an odd number of times. But if we apply the same stamp operation twice, then the net effect is zero? because the first sets (R,B) and the second (if same type) sets (R,B) again? no, the second time it sets the same: so if we apply the same stamp operation twice, the cells become the stamp color twice: so the last one wins? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify the order. But note: the stamp operations can be in any order and they overwrite? \n\n          However, the known solution in Codeforces for the same problem (problem B of a contest) is: \n            - Split by W\n            - For each segment, if the segment is non-empty:\n                if the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n                else: if the segment has at least one R and at least one B -> valid, else invalid.\n\n          Why? \n            Because if the entire segment is of the same color, say R, then we must have had an even number of stamps on each edge? but actually, the stamp operation always changes two adjacent cells. The key is: the first stamp in the segment must introduce both colors? and then subsequent stamps can change the colors arbitrarily? \n\n          But from the examples: \n            \"RR\" -> invalid? \n            \"RB\" -> valid.\n\n          Actually, the known solution for Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem F? or similar: \n            We can note:\n              - The stamp always changes two adjacent cells to one R and one B. Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for a contiguous non-white segment is:\n            - The segment must have at least two cells and must contain at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'.\n\n          Then the overall solution:\n            For each test case:\n              n = int(input())\n              s = input().strip()\n\n              We split s by 'W' -> segments = s.split('W')\n              Then for each segment in segments:\n                 if segment == \"\": skip.\n                 else:\n                    if len(segment) == 1:\n                         invalid -> break out and mark as NO for the test case.\n                    else:\n                         if 'R' not in segment or 'B' not in segment:\n                             invalid -> break and mark as NO.\n\n              If we didn't find any invalid segment, then YES.\n\n          However, consider the example: \n            Example 1: \"RRB\" -> valid? \n              segment = \"RRB\" -> has both R and B -> valid.\n\n          Example 2: \"RR\" -> invalid? \n              segment = \"RR\" -> has no B -> invalid.\n\n          Example 3: \"R\" -> invalid (by length).\n\n          Example 4: \"W\" -> skip (so valid? because no non-white segment? then the entire picture is white -> valid? but note: we can have no stamp -> valid).\n\n          Example 5: \"WW\" -> valid.\n\n          Example 6: \"RWR\" -> \n              segments: ['R', 'R'] -> both segments are of length 1 -> invalid.\n\n          Therefore, we must output \"NO\" for \"RWR\".\n\n          But the sample test cases in the problem:\n\n          Sample:\n            Input: \n              12\n              2\n              RB\n              ... (and 11 more)\n\n          The sample outputs:\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            ... \n\n          The first test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> YES -> our method: segment \"RB\" -> length>=2 and has both -> YES.\n\n          Second test case: n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> YES? \n            Our method: segment \"RBR\" -> has both R and B -> YES.\n\n          But the sample output for the second test case is \"NO\"? \n\n          Wait, the problem states:\n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          The second test case in the problem input? The problem says the first test case is explained. Then:\n\n          The input has 12 test cases? Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The first line contains an integer t (1<=t<=10000)\" and then the total n<=100000.\n\n          The sample input in the note is:\n\n            Input:\n              12\n              2\n              RB\n              3\n              RBR\n              2\n              BB\n              3\n              BBR\n              2\n              BR\n              3\n              RRR\n              3\n              BBB\n              3\n              BRB\n              5\n              BRBRB\n              5\n              BBBRB\n              5\n              BRRBR\n              5\n              RBRBR\n\n          And the expected output is:\n\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n\n          So the second test case: n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> output \"NO\", but our method would say YES? \n\n          Why is \"RBR\" invalid? \n\n          Let me try to build \"RBR\" from \"WWW\":\n            We have three cells: [0,1,2] initially WWW.\n\n            Possibility 1:\n              Stamp at 0: we can choose either RB or BR. \n                If RB: then [R, B, W]\n                Then stamp at 1: we can choose either RB or BR.\n                  If we choose RB: then [R, R, B] -> then we have RRB -> not RBR.\n                  If we choose BR: then [R, R, B] -> same? because at position1: \n                    BR: sets cell1 to B and cell2 to R? -> [R, B, R] -> that's RBR.\n\n            So we can do it in two stamps: \n              Step1: stamp at0 as RB -> [R, B, W]\n              Step2: stamp at1 as BR -> [R, B, R] -> RBR.\n\n          Therefore, it should be YES.\n\n          But the sample output for the second test case is \"NO\". \n\n          Wait, the problem says: \n            \"The second, third, and fourth test cases\" are NO. The second test case in the sample input is \"RBR\", which is the second test case? \n\n          Actually, the sample input has 12 test cases. The first one is \"RB\" (n=2) -> YES, the second is \"RBR\" (n=3) -> but the problem says the second, third, and fourth are NO? \n\n          The problem states: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          But note: the sample input has 12 test cases. The problem says the first test case is explained (which is the first one: \"RB\"). Then the next three (test cases 2,3,4) are NO. \n\n          In the sample input, the second test case is \"RBR\", the third is \"BB\", the fourth is \"BBR\". \n\n          But we just saw that \"RBR\" is possible? \n\n          Let me check the problem statement again: \n            \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8.\" -> that's a different example? \n\n          Actually, the problem has two parts: the first part is about the store and the second part is about the stamp. The sample input for the stamp problem is the 12 test cases.\n\n          The problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          What does \"stamp a single cell\" mean? It means that the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So if the entire picture has only one non-white cell? \n\n          But in the second test case: \"RBR\" has three non-white cells. \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"In the second test case, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\" -> meaning that the entire picture has no contiguous segment of two non-white cells? \n\n          Actually, the second test case in the sample input is \"RBR\", which has three non-white cells? \n\n          I see the confusion: the problem says \"the second, third, and fourth test cases\" in the note refer to the examples in the note? \n\n          The note says:\n            \"In the first query, ... \n             In the second query, ...\"\n\n          And the input for the second query: \n            The second query: n=3, and the customer purchases at least x items? but wait, the note is about the first problem? \n\n          Actually, the problem has two parts: \n            The first part: the store problem (program1.py) and the second part: the stamp problem (program2.py) ? \n\n          But wait, the problem we are solving is the stamp problem? \n\n          The problem description: \n            \"The store sells ... \" -> that's the first problem? \n            Then the next problem: \"A row of n cells ... \" -> that's the second problem? \n\n          But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          And the code we are given for program1.py is about the store problem? and program2.py is about the stamp problem? \n\n          Actually, the problem statement we are reading now is for the stamp problem? \n\n          The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and then the description of the stamp problem.\n\n          And the sample input for the stamp problem is:\n\n            Input:\n              12\n              2\n              RB\n              3\n              RBR\n              2\n              BB\n              3\n              BBR\n              2\n              BR\n              3\n              RRR\n              3\n              BBB\n              3\n              BRB\n              5\n              BRBRB\n              5\n              BBBRB\n              5\n              BRRBR\n              5\n              RBRBR\n\n          And the expected output:\n\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n\n          So the second test case is \"RBR\" -> output \"NO\", but we just constructed it? \n\n          Why is it \"NO\"? \n\n          Let me reexamine the construction for \"RBR\":\n            Step1: stamp at0: \n                We can choose: \n                  Option1: RB -> [R, B, W]\n                  Option2: BR -> [B, R, W]\n            Step2: \n                If we did Option1: then we have [R, B, W]. Now we stamp at1: \n                  Option1: RB -> [R, R, B] -> R R B -> not RBR.\n                  Option2: BR -> [R, B, R] -> that's RBR.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n          But the sample output says \"NO\" for the second test case? \n\n          I see: the problem says the second test case in the sample input is the second one: \"RBR\", and the expected output is the second line: \"NO\". \n\n          However, the problem note says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          But the second test case is \"RBR\", which we can do. \n\n          There is a known issue: the problem says \"it is not possible to stamp a single cell\", meaning that the entire picture has only one non-white cell? \n\n          But \"RBR\" has three non-white cells. \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"The second test case\" in the note might be the second example in the note? \n\n          The note has:\n            \"In the first query, ... \" (which is the store problem) and then \"In the second query, ...\" (also the store problem). \n\n          Then it says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases\" (of the stamp problem) ... \n\n          But the sample input for the stamp problem has 12 test cases. The problem says the second, third, and fourth test cases (in the entire input) are the ones that are NO? \n\n          The sample input:\n\n            Test case 1: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> YES\n            Test case 2: n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> NO\n            Test case 3: n=2, s=\"BB\" -> NO\n            Test case 4: n=3, s=\"BBR\" -> NO\n            Test case 5: n=2, s=\"BR\" -> YES\n            Test case 6: n=3, s=\"RRR\" -> YES\n            Test case 7: n=3, s=\"BBB\" -> YES\n            Test case 8: n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> YES\n            Test case 9: n=5, s=\"BRBRB\" -> YES\n            Test case 10: n=5, s=\"BBBRB\" -> NO\n            Test case 11: n=5, s=\"BRRBR\" -> NO\n            Test case 12: n=5, s=\"RBRBR\" -> YES\n\n          Why is \"RBR\" (test case 2) NO? \n\n          Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free\" -> that's the store problem, not the stamp problem.\n\n          We are solving the stamp problem. \n\n          The stamp problem: \n            \"The store's management is going to hold a promotion\" ... but then the problem we are solving is the stamp problem: \n            \"A row of n cells is given, all initially white. ... \"\n\n          And the sample input for the stamp problem is the 12 test cases.\n\n          Why is \"RBR\" impossible? \n\n          I see: the problem says the stamp must completely fit on the n cells. And we are allowed to stamp any two adjacent cells arbitrarily many times. \n\n          But note: the entire picture is of length 3. We can stamp at position0 and then at position1. \n\n          However, there is a known solution that passes: \n            We break the string by 'W'. For the stamp problem, the sample \"RBR\" has no 'W', so one segment \"RBR\". \n            Conditions: \n              - Length>=2: yes (3>=2)\n              - Contains at least one R and one B: yes.\n\n          But the expected answer is \"NO\". \n\n          What's the catch? \n\n          I see: the problem says \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells (it cannot be partially outside the cells)\". That means when we stamp, the entire stamp must be within the array. That is not an issue for \"RBR\": we can stamp at0 and then at1.\n\n          Another possibility: the stamping operations are not independent? \n\n          Let me simulate on \"RBR\" again:\n\n            Step0: [W, W, W]\n            Step1: stamp at0 as BR: [B, R, W] -> but we want R at0? \n            Step1: stamp at0 as RB: [R, B, W] -> then step2: stamp at1 as BR: [R, B, R] -> done.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          But the sample output says \"NO\". \n\n          I recall: in the problem statement, the example outputs for the 12 test cases are:\n\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO\n            YES\n\n          And the second one is \"NO\" for \"RBR\". \n\n          There is a known solution in Codeforces for a problem titled \"Stamp Coloring\" or similar? \n\n          After checking: actually, the problem is from Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4), problem F: https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/F\n\n          But that is about eating candies. \n\n          Alternatively, it might be from a more recent contest. \n\n          I see: the sample input test case 2 is \"RBR\", and the expected output is \"NO\", but we can do it. \n\n          Another possibility: the problem has a constraint that we cannot stamp the same cell twice? But the problem says \"The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\"\n\n          Or: the stamping operations must be done in a way that the entire segment is covered? But we did cover the entire segment.\n\n          I see the issue: the problem says \"for the given values of x and y\" in the store problem, but we are solving the stamp problem.\n\n          We are definitely solving the stamp problem. \n\n          Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"Given a final picture, is it possible to make it using the stamp zero or more times?\"\n\n          And the sample input for the stamp problem is the 12 test cases.\n\n          Why is \"RBR\" impossible? \n\n          I see: the sample input for the second test case is \"RBR\", but the expected output is \"NO\". \n\n          There is a known solution that uses the following:\n\n            def solve():\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    # Split by W\n                    arr = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for seg in arr:\n                        if seg == '':\n                            continue\n                        if len(seg) == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        # Check if the segment has at least one 'R' and one 'B'\n                        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n          But this would output for \"RBR\": \n              seg = \"RBR\" -> has both R and B -> valid = True -> output \"YES\"\n\n          But expected is \"NO\". \n\n          What if we change the condition: \n            We require that the segment has at least two of each color? \n\n          But \"RBR\" has two R's and one B -> that's not two of each.\n\n          Or: we require that the number of R's and B's must be at least one and the segment length>=2? \n\n          I see: the known solution from a Codeforces submission for the same problem (problem B of a contest) is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                s = input().strip()\n                s = s.split('W')\n                bad = False\n                for i in s:\n                    if i == \"\":\n                        continue\n                    l = len(i)\n                    r = i.count('R')\n                    b = l - r\n                    if r == 0 or b == 0:\n                        bad = True\n                        break\n                print(\"NO\" if bad else \"YES\")\n\n          This is the same as above.\n\n          But it turns out that in the sample input, the second test case is not \"RBR\" but something else? \n\n          Let me double-check the sample input:\n\n            The first test case: \n              2\n              RB -> YES\n\n            The second test case:\n              3\n              RBR -> but the sample output for the second test case is \"NO\", but our simulation says YES.\n\n          I found the actual contest problem: Codeforces Round #827 (Div. 4), problem F: https://codeforces.com/contest/1742/problem/F\n\n          But that is about a different problem.\n\n          Alternatively, the problem might be from an educational round. \n\n          I see: the sample test case 2 is \"RBR\", and the expected output is \"NO\", but we can do it. \n\n          There is a possibility: the problem has a constraint that the stamp cannot be applied to a cell that has been stamped before? But the problem says \"The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\"\n\n          Or: the stamp must be applied to contiguous segments that are initially white? But the problem does not say that.\n\n          After rethinking: the known solution that is accepted in Codeforces for the problem \"Stamp the Grid\" or similar might be different.\n\n          I found a solution online for a problem with the sample input/output we have:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n\n            int main() {\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) {\n                    int n;\n                    cin >> n;\n                    string s;\n                    cin >> s;\n                    bool hasR = false, hasB = false;\n                    bool ans = true;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        if (s[i] == 'R') hasR = true;\n                        else if (s[i] == 'B') hasB = true;\n                        else {\n                            if (hasR || hasB) {\n                                if (!(hasR && hasB)) {\n                                    ans = false;\n                                }\n                            }\n                            hasR = false;\n                            hasB = false;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (hasR || hasB) {\n                        if (!(hasR && hasB)) {\n                            ans = false;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    cout << (ans ? \"YES\" : \"NO\") << endl;\n                }\n            }\n\n          This solution: \n            It iterates by each cell. When it meets a 'W', it checks the segment since the last 'W': \n               if in that segment there was at least one color, then it requires both R and B to have appeared.\n            Then it resets hasR and hasB for the next segment.\n            At the end, it checks the last segment.\n\n          How does it work for \"RBR\" (n=3, s=\"RBR\")? \n            There is no 'W' in \"RBR\", so we go through the entire string without resetting by W.\n            At the end, we check: hasR and hasB are true (because we set hasR=true at the first 'R', hasB=true at the 'B', and hasR=true again at the last 'R').\n            So the last segment: hasR=true and hasB=true -> valid.\n\n          Then why sample output is \"NO\"? \n\n          Unless the sample input for the second test case is not \"RBR\" but something else? \n\n          The problem says the second test case in the sample input is the one with n=3 and s=\"RBR\", and the expected output is the second line: \"NO\".\n\n          But the above code would output \"YES\" for \"RBR\".\n\n          I see: the sample input has 12 test cases, and the second test case is not \"RBR\" but the third test case in the sample input is \"RBR\"? \n\n          Let me list the sample input as provided in the problem:\n\n            Input:\n              12\n              2\n              RB\n              3\n              RBR\n              2\n              BB\n              3\n              BBR\n              2\n              BR\n              3\n              RRR\n              3\n              BBB\n              3\n              BRB\n              5\n              BRBRB\n              5\n              BBBRB\n              5\n              BRRBR\n              5\n              RBRBR\n\n          The first test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> output \"YES\"\n          The second test case: n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> output \"NO\"\n          The third test case: n=2, s=\"BB\" -> output \"NO\"\n          The fourth test case: n=3, s=\"BBR\" -> output \"NO\"\n          The fifth: n=2, s=\"BR\" -> \"YES\"\n          sixth: n=3, s=\"RRR\" -> \"YES\"\n          seventh: n=3, s=\"BBB\" -> \"YES\"\n          eighth: n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> \"YES\"\n          ninth: n=5, s=\"BRBRB\" -> \"YES\"\n          tenth: n=5, s=\"BBBRB\" -> \"NO\"\n          eleventh: n=5, s=\"BRRBR\" -> \"NO\"\n          twelfth: n=5, s=\"RBRBR\" -> \"YES\"\n\n          So the second test case is \"RBR\" -> \"NO\".\n\n          How can \"RBR\" be impossible? \n\n          I see: the problem might have a constraint that the stamp must be applied to contiguous groups? or that the entire purchase must be contiguous? \n\n          But the problem says: \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free\" -> that's the store problem, not the stamp problem.\n\n          We are solving the stamp problem. \n\n          The stamp problem: \n            \" determine the maximum total value of items received for free, if a customer makes one purchase.\" -> no, that's the store problem output.\n\n          The stamp problem is: given a string s, can we form it from all white using the stamp operations? \n\n          I see: the problem has two different problems: program1.py and program2.py. \n\n          The user's request: \n            \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n          And the code provided for program1.py is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          And for program2.py is not provided? \n\n          But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          So we are to complete both? \n\n          The output format is: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n          So we have to complete both programs.\n\n          Let me read the first problem (program1.py) description:\n\n          Description: The store sells n items, the price of the i-th item is p_i. The store's management is going to hold a promotion: if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free. The management has not yet decided on the exact values of x and y. Therefore, they ask you to process q queries: for the given values of x and y, determine the maximum total value of items received for free, if a customer makes one purchase.\n\n          Input Specification: The first line contains two integers n and q (1<=n,q<=200000) \u2014 the number of items in the store and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ... , p_n (1<=p_i<=10^6), where p_i \u2014 the price of the i-th item. The following q lines contain two integers x_i and y_i each (1<=y_i<=x_i<=n) \u2014 the values of the parameters x and y in the i-th query.\n\n          Output Specification: For each query, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum total value of items received for free for one purchase.\n\n          Notes: \n            In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8.\n\n          Example: \n            Input: \n              6 5\n              5 3 2 5 3 3\n              3 2\n              2 1\n              2 2\n              4 3\n              4 4\n\n            Output:\n              8\n              5\n              5\n              8\n              5\n\n          How to solve program1.py:\n            We have to answer q queries. In each query (x,y): \n              The customer can choose any set of at least x items. Then, the y cheapest items in that set are free. The goal is to maximize the total value of the free items.\n\n            Note: the free items are the y cheapest in the purchased set. To maximize the sum of the free items, we want the free items to be as expensive as possible. But they are the cheapest in the set, so to make them expensive, we want to avoid including very cheap items.\n\n            Strategy:\n              - We are forced to take at least x items, and then we get the y cheapest for free.\n              - To maximize the sum of the free items, we want the set to include as many expensive items as possible, but note: the free items are the cheapest in the set. So we want the y cheapest in the set to be as large as possible.\n\n            How to do that?\n              - Sort the prices in descending order. \n              - But note: if we choose a set, the free items are the y cheapest in the set, which are the smallest in the set. To make these small ones as large as possible, we should choose a set that has the largest possible values for the smallest items.\n\n            Insight: \n              - The optimal strategy is to choose exactly x items, because if you choose more than x, then you might be forced to include some very cheap items that will be in the free part? or not necessarily.\n\n            Let's example: \n              n=6, prices = [5,3,2,5,3,3] -> sort in ascending order: [2,3,3,3,5,5]\n              Query: (3,2): \n                 We must buy at least 3 items. We get the 2 cheapest free.\n                 If we buy the three most expensive: [5,5,3] -> the two cheapest are 3 and 5? -> sorted: [3,5,5] -> free: 3+5 = 8.\n                 If we buy [5,5,5] -> but there are only two 5's. \n                 If we buy [5,5,3] -> free: 3 and the next cheapest is 5? -> but wait, the set has [5,5,3]: sorted is [3,5,5] -> free: 3 and 5 -> 8.\n                 If we buy [5,3,3]: sorted [3,3,5] -> free: 3+3=6.\n                 If we buy [5,5,3,3]: then the two cheapest are 3 and 3 -> 6.\n\n              So the maximum free sum is 8.\n\n            How to achieve it: \n              - We must choose at least x items. In the chosen set, the free items are the y smallest. \n              - To maximize the sum of the y smallest, we want the y smallest in the set to be as large as possible.\n\n            Therefore, we can try to choose a set that has the largest possible values for the smallest y items in the set. \n\n            Idea: \n              - We can only use each item once.\n              - We want to choose a set of size at least x, but note that if we choose more than x, then the set will include additional items that are even larger, which might push the y-th smallest to be larger? \n\n            However, note: the free items are exactly the y smallest, regardless of the total size. If we choose more than x items, then the y smallest might be very small if we add a very small item.\n\n            Therefore, the optimal is to choose exactly x items. Why?\n              - If we choose more than x items, then the set has more items, and the y smallest might include some very small item that we added. \n\n            But consider: \n              We have sorted array in ascending order: a0<=a1<=...<=a_{n-1}\n              If we choose a set of size x: then the free items are the y smallest in the set, which are a0, a1, ... , a_{y-1} in the set. \n              But we can choose which x items to take. \n\n            How to choose the set of size x to maximize the sum of the y smallest in that set?\n              - We want the y smallest in the set to be as large as possible. \n              - The y smallest in the set will be at least as large as the y-th smallest item in the entire array only if we avoid the smallest items? \n\n            Actually, we can do:\n              - We will take the largest x items, but then the smallest y in these x items might be small if the largest x items include some small ones.\n\n            Example: \n              [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], x=5, y=2.\n              If we take the largest 5: [6,7,8,9,10] -> the two smallest are 6 and 7 -> sum=13.\n              If we take [5,6,7,8,9] -> the two smallest are 5 and 6 -> sum=11.\n              If we take [10,9,8,7,1] -> the two smallest are 1 and 7 -> sum=8.\n\n            So taking the largest x items might not be optimal for the free part? \n\n            But note: the free part is the y smallest in the set. To maximize the sum of the y smallest, we want to avoid including very small items. \n\n            Therefore, the optimal set should avoid the smallest items as much as possible. \n\n            How about: \n              - We will take the largest x items, but then the smallest y in this set are the first y of these x items (when sorted in increasing order). \n\n            In the example: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], x=5, y=2: \n              largest x = [6,7,8,9,10] -> sorted: [6,7,8,9,10] -> free = 6+7 = 13.\n\n            Can we do better? \n              If we take a set that does not include the smallest among the largest x, but includes a larger item and excludes a small item within the set? \n              But the set must have size x. If we replace the smallest in the set (which is 6) with the next largest (11) but there is no 11. \n\n            So the largest x items give the largest possible values for the smallest in the set? \n\n            However, consider: \n              [1,2,3,4,5,6] and x=3, y=2.\n              Option1: largest 3: [4,5,6] -> free: 4+5 = 9.\n              Option2: [3,5,6] -> free: 3+5 = 8.\n              Option3: [2,5,6] -> free: 2+5 = 7.\n\n            So indeed, taking the largest x items gives the free sum = (the sum of the smallest y in the largest x items) = the sum of the items from the (n-x)th to the (n-x+y-1)th in the sorted (ascending) array.\n\n            But wait, in sorted array (ascending) a[0] ... a[n-1]:\n              The largest x items are a[n-x] to a[n-1].\n              The y smallest in this set are a[n-x] to a[n-x+y-1].\n\n            Example: n=6, x=3, then the largest 3 are a[3],a[4],a[5]. The y=2 smallest are a[3] and a[4].\n\n            In the example: \n              prices sorted: [2,3,3,3,5,5] \n              Query (3,2): \n                 n=6, x=3, y=2.\n                 The largest 3: [3,5,5] -> but in sorted array: \n                    sorted: [2,3,3,3,5,5] -> indices 0..5.\n                    largest 3: indices 3,4,5: values 3,5,5.\n                 The smallest 2 in this set: 3 and 5 -> sum=8.\n\n            Query (2,1): \n                 x=2, y=1.\n                 largest 2: [5,5] -> the smallest 1 in this set is 5.\n                 output 5.\n\n            Query (2,2): \n                 x=2, y=2.\n                 largest 2: [5,5] -> smallest 2: 5+5=10? but wait, the set has only two, so both are free? \n                 output 10? but the example output is 5.\n\n            Wait, the example output for (2,2) is 5.\n\n            Why? \n              The free items are the y cheapest in the purchased set. In the set [5,5], the cheapest is 5, and there are two of them, but we only get the y=2 cheapest? -> then we get both for free: 5+5=10? \n\n            But the example output is 5.\n\n            Let me read the example: \n              \"In the second query, a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5\"\n\n            The problem says: \"the y cheapest of them are free\", and y=2, so both should be free. \n\n            But the example says \"the cheapest of them is 5\", and then it says \"the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\" for the first query. \n\n            In the second query: \n              \"a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5\"\n\n            It says \"the cheapest of them is 5\", but there are two items both 5, so the two cheapest are both 5. \n\n            The example output for the second query is 5? \n\n            The sample output for the queries:\n              8\n              5\n              5\n              8\n              5\n\n            The second query (x=2, y=1): output 5.\n            The third query (x=2, y=2): output 5? -> but that would be 5, not 10.\n\n            This is a contradiction.\n\n          I see: the problem says in the second query: \"determine the maximum total value of items received for free\"\n\n          In the second query (x=2, y=1): \n             The customer can choose any set of at least 2 items. \n             To maximize the free part (which is the y=1 cheapest), we want the cheapest item in the set to be as expensive as possible.\n             The best is to choose two items of 5. Then the cheapest in the set is 5, so free=5.\n\n          In the third query (x=2, y=2): \n             The customer must choose at least 2 items, and then the 2 cheapest are free.\n             If the customer chooses two items of 5, then both are free: 5+5=10.\n             But the example output is 5.\n\n          This is a mistake in the example? \n\n          Let me read the example input again: \n            \"3 2\" -> wait, the example input for the queries:\n\n              3 2   -> x=3, y=2 -> output 8\n              2 1   -> output 5\n              2 2   -> output 5\n              4 3   -> output 8\n              4 4   -> output 5\n\n          For the query (2,2): \n             The example says: \"In the second query, a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5\"\n             But that example is for y=1, not y=2.\n\n          For the query (2,2): \n             The example does not provide an explanation.\n\n          How can the free sum be 5 for (2,2)? \n             If the customer chooses two items of 5, then free sum=5+5=10.\n             If the customer chooses more than 2 items, say three items: then the two cheapest in the three items might be smaller.\n\n          To maximize the free sum for (2,2), we would choose the two most expensive: 5+5=10.\n\n          But the example output is 5.\n\n          There is a misunderstanding: the problem says \" the maximum total value of items received for free\"\n\n          In the set of items purchased, the customer gets the y cheapest for free. So for a set S, free = sum of the y smallest in S.\n\n          For (2,2): \n             We must choose at least 2 items. The free sum = sum of the 2 smallest in the chosen set.\n             If we choose exactly 2 items, then free = sum of both.\n             If we choose 3 items, then free = sum of the 2 smallest among the 3.\n\n          Example: \n             If we choose [5,5] -> free=10.\n             If we choose [5,3] -> free=3+5=8.\n             If we choose [3,3] -> free=6.\n             If we choose [5,5,3] -> free=3+5=8.\n             If we choose [5,3,3] -> free=3+3=6.\n\n          So the maximum free sum is 10.\n\n          But the example output is 5.\n\n          Unless the example has a typo. \n\n          Looking at the sample input and output provided in the problem for the store problem:\n\n            Input: \n              6 5\n              5 3 2 5 3 3\n              3 2\n              2 1\n              2 2\n              4 3\n              4 4\n\n            Output:\n              8\n              5\n              5\n              8\n              5\n\n          This implies that for (2,2) the answer is 5.\n\n          How can it be 5? \n            The only way is if the free sum is the sum of the y cheapest, but then for a set of two 5's, the sum is 10, not 5.\n\n          Unless the problem means that the free item is only one of the two? \n\n          Read the problem: \" if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free\"\n\n          \" are free\" (plural) -> then it should be the sum of the y cheapest.\n\n          But the example output for (2,1) is 5, for (2,2) is 5, for (4,4) is 5.\n\n          This suggests that for (2,2) the answer is 5, which is not 10.\n\n          I see: the problem might mean that the customer gets the y-th cheapest item for free, not the y cheapest items. \n\n          But the problem says: \"y cheapest of them are free\", and in the example: \" the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n\n          So it is the sum of the y cheapest.\n\n          The example output for (2,2) is 5, which is not 10. \n\n          There is a known issue in the problem statement. \n\n          Alternatively, the example output for (2,2) is 5 because the customer can choose to buy only one item? \n\n          But the problem says \"at least x items\", and x=2, so at least 2.\n\n          After checking online: the sample output for the store problem is indeed:\n            8\n            5\n            5\n            8\n            5\n\n          And the sample input is as given.\n\n          How to achieve 5 for (2,2): \n            If the customer chooses a set of two items: [3,3] -> then the two cheapest are 3 and 3, sum=6.\n            or [3,5] -> 3+5=8.\n            or [5,5] -> 5+5=10.\n\n          None is 5.\n\n          If the customer chooses more than 2 items, say 3 items: \n            [3,3,5] -> the two cheapest are 3 and 3 -> 6.\n            [3,5,5] -> the two cheapest are 3 and 5 -> 8.\n            [2,3,5] -> the two cheapest are 2 and 3 -> 5.\n\n          Ah! So if the customer chooses the set {2,3,5} (at least 2 items), then the two cheapest are 2 and 3, sum=5.\n\n          But is 5 the maximum free sum? \n            We can get 10 by {5,5} -> so 10>5.\n\n          unless the customer cannot choose the same item twice? and there are only two 5's.\n\n          The set {5,5} is allowed because there are two items with price 5.\n\n          So why would the answer be 5? \n\n          The problem says: \"determine the maximum total value of items received for free\"\n\n          So we should be able to get 10.\n\n          Unless the problem has a constraint: the customer cannot choose more than x items? \n\n          The problem says: \" if a customer purchases at least x items\", so they can purchase more.\n\n          But then 10 is achievable.\n\n          There is a known solution for the store problem: \n            Sort the array in ascending order: a[0]<=a[1]<=...<=a[n-1]\n            For a query (x,y): \n               The answer = the minimum over k>=x of (sum of the y smallest in the chosen set of size k) \n               but wait, no: we want the maximum free sum.\n\n          Actually, we want: \n             free = sum of the y smallest in the set S, and we want to maximize free over all S with |S|>=x.\n\n          So for a fixed set S, free = sum of the y smallest in S.\n\n          To maximize free, we should choose a set S that has the largest possible y smallest items.\n\n          How to do that? \n            - We can choose any set. \n            - The optimal set will be exactly the largest possible items, but then the y smallest in that set might be small if we include a small item.\n\n          Insight: \n            - The free sum for a set S is at most the sum of the y largest items in the entire array, but that might not be achievable if we are forced to take at least x items.\n\n          Example: \n            In the array [2,3,3,3,5,5], the y=2 largest items are 5+5=10. \n            Can we achieve 10? \n               We can if we choose a set that contains the two 5's and no item that is cheaper than 5. \n               The set {5,5} has size 2>=2, and the two cheapest are 5 and 5 -> sum=10.\n\n          Therefore, the answer for (2,2) should be 10.\n\n          But the example output is 5.\n\n          I see: the sample output provided in the problem for the store problem is:\n\n            8\n            5\n            5\n            8\n            5\n\n          for the input queries:\n            (3,2) -> 8\n            (2,1) -> 5\n            (2,2) -> 5\n            (4,3) -> 8\n            (4,4) -> 5\n\n          How can (2,2) be 5? \n\n          Unless the problem is: the customer gets the y-th cheapest item for free, not the sum of the y cheapest.\n\n          But the example: \" the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\" -> so it is the sum.\n\n          After checking a known solution for the store problem (which is common in Codeforces as \" promotion of the store\"):\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            typedef long long ll;\n\n            int main() {\n                ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n                cin.tie(0);\n\n                int n, q;\n                cin >> n >> q;\n                vector<ll> p(n);\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    cin >> p[i];\n                }\n                sort(p.begin(), p.end(), greater<ll>());\n                vector<ll> pre(n+1);\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    pre[i+1] = pre[i] + p[i];\n                }\n                while (q--) {\n                    int x, y;\n                    cin >> x >> y;\n                    // We are to choose at least x items, but note: we can choose exactly x items.\n                    // The free items are the y cheapest in the set.

So to maximize that, we choose two 5's: then the 2nd cheapest is 5.\n             In a set of three: the 2nd cheapest is the middle one. The best is to choose [5,5, anything] -> the 2nd cheapest is 5.\n             so free=5.\n\n          For (2,1): \n             the 1st cheapest (the cheapest) in the set, and we want to maximize that. \n             The best is to choose two 5's: the cheapest is 5.\n\n          For (4,4): \n             the 4th cheapest in the set of at least 4 items. In a set of 4, the 4th cheapest is the largest. \n             To maximize that, we choose the largest 4 items: [5,5,3,3] -> the 4th cheapest is 5.\n             free=5.\n\n          For (4,3): \n             the 3rd cheapest in the set. In the set of 4 [5,5,3,3] sorted: [3,3,5,5] -> the 3rd cheapest is 5.\n             free=5, but expected 8.\n\n          not matching.\n\n          For (4,3): if we choose exactly 4 items, the 3rd cheapest is 5, but the example output is 8.\n\n          So it must be the sum of the y cheapest.\n\n          Given the time, I will assume the following for the store problem (program1.py) is the intended solution:\n\n            Sort the array in descending order.\n            Then for a query (x,y): \n               // We will choose the largest x items.\n               // The free items are the y cheapest in this set, which are the last y in the sorted (descending) array among the x items.\n               // In 0-indexed, they are at positions x-y to x-1 in the sorted array.\n               // So free sum = sum of a[x-y] to a[x-1] in the sorted array.\n\n            But then for (4,3): \n               sorted (descending): [5,5,3,3,3,2] (n=6)\n               x=4, y=3: positions from 4-3=1 to 3: a[1] to a[3] = 5,3,3 -> sum=11, not 8.\n\n          unless we sort in ascending order and do:\n\n            sorted in ascending: [2,3,3,3,5,5]\n            // the largest x=4 items: [3,3,5,5] (indices 2 to 5)\n            // the y=3 cheapest in this set: the first 3 of these 4: [3,3,3] -> sum=9, not 8.\n\n          or the last y in the chosen set in the sorted (ascending) array: \n            the chosen set: [3,3,5,5] -> sorted is the same, the 3 cheapest are the first 3: 3,3,3 -> sum=9.\n\n          How to get 8 for (4,3): \n            if we choose the set {5,5,3,2} (the largest 4 including the smallest among the largest 4 and the next)? \n            sorted: [2,3,5,5] -> the 3 cheapest: 2+3+5=10.\n\n          or {5,3,3,3} -> sorted: [3,3,3,5] -> 3+3+3=9.\n\n          or {5,5,3,3} -> sorted: [3,3,5,5] -> 3+3+5=11.\n\n          None is 8.\n\n          I see: the sample input for the store problem has the prices: [5,3,2,5,3,3] \n          sorted: [2,3,3,3,5,5]\n\n          for (4,3): \n             if we choose the set of 4: the largest 4: [3,3,5,5] -> the 3 cheapest are 3,3,3 (wait, there are three 3's) -> sum=9.\n             if we choose a set that includes the 2: [2,3,5,5] -> the 3 cheapest: 2+3+5=10.\n             if we choose [2,3,3,5] -> 2+3+3=8.\n\n          So if we choose [2,3,3,5] (which is not the largest 4, because we left out a 3 and took the 2) then the free sum=8.\n\n          Therefore, the optimal set is not necessarily the largest x items.\n\n          How to solve it then? \n            We want to choose a set S of at least x items to maximize the sum of the y smallest in S.\n\n            Note: the free sum = sum of the y smallest in S.\n\n            We can try to choose exactly x items, because if we choose more, we might be forced to include a very small item that will be in the free part, reducing the sum.\n\n            So assume we choose exactly x items.\n\n            Then we want to maximize the sum of the y smallest in a set of x items.\n\n            This is equivalent to: \n               maximize_{S, |S|=x} { sum_{i in S and i is among the y smallest in S} }\n\n            = maximize_{S, |S|=x} { sum of the y smallest in S }\n\n            How to compute that for many queries (up to 200000) and n up to 200000?\n\n            We can try: \n               Sort the array in ascending order.\n               Let a[0..n-1] sorted ascending.\n               We are to choose x items. The y smallest in the set will be the first min(y, x) items in the set if we sort the set in ascending order.\n\n            But we can choose any x items. To maximize the sum of the y smallest, we want these y smallest to be as large as possible.\n\n            Therefore, we should include the largest possible items in the set, but then the smallest in the set might be small.\n\n            However, the y smallest in the set will be the smallest items in the set. To make them large, we should avoid very small items.\n\n            The optimal: \n               We will take the largest x items, but then the smallest in that set might be small. \n               We can try to replace some of the larger items that are not in the free part with smaller items that are larger than the smallest in the set? \n\n            Actually, we can do: \n               The free part is the y smallest in the set. To maximize the sum of the free part, we want to maximize the entire set's small items. \n               We can choose the x items as the largest x items, but then the free part is the smallest y in these x, which are a[n-x] to a[n-x+y-1] (in the sorted array).\n\n            But we saw that for (4,3) in the example, we can achieve 8 by [2,3,3,5] (sorted: [2,3,3,5]), free=2+3+3=8, while the largest 4 is [3,3,5,5] -> free=3+3+3=9? -> wait, in [3,3,5,5] the three smallest are the three 3's, sum=9, which is >8.\n\n            So 9 is better than 8. \n\n            Why is the sample output for (4,3) 8 then? \n\n            The sample output is 8 for (4,3) in the example provided in the problem.\n\n            In the example, the free sum for (4,3) is 8.\n\n            How to achieve 8: \n               [2,3,3,5] -> free=2+3+3=8.\n               [3,3,5,5] -> free=3+3+3=9? -> but wait, in [3,3,5,5] there are only two 3's and two 5's. The three smallest are the two 3's and the smallest 5? -> 3+3+5=11? \n               sorted [3,3,5,5] -> the three smallest: the first three: 3,3,5 -> sum=11.\n\n            So 11 is even bigger.\n\n            Then the maximum free sum for (4,3) is 11.\n\n            But the sample output is 8.\n\n          Given the complexity and the time, and that the problem has two programs and we are to output the missing code for both, and the sample output for the stamp problem is also not matching, I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the sample output.\n\n          Since the user's request is to output the missing code for both program1.py and program2.py so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly, and the sample output for the store problem is provided as 8,5,5,8,5, and for the stamp problem as the 12 test cases, I will assume the following:\n\n          For program1.py (store problem) we output the following for each test case (each query) in the provided code structure:\n\n            We are given: \n              for s in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n            This means: \n              The first two lines are the first line (n,q) and the second line ( the prices), then the next q lines are the queries.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              n, q = map(int, first_line.split())\n              prices = list(map(int, second_line.split()))\n              # then for each query in the next q lines\n\n            But the loop is over [2::2], which means it is taking every other line starting from index 2, and then within the loop, s is a line from the input, but it is the second line of the test case? \n\n          Actually, the input is:\n\n            Line0: t (for the stamp problem) or for the store problem: the first line is n and q.\n            Line1: the prices\n            Line2 to Line1+q: the queries.\n\n          In the code for program1.py: \n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]: \n            This is iterating over the queries, but only the even-indexed ones (0-indexed: the first query is at index2, then index4, etc) -> not what we want.\n\n          We should change the loop.\n\n          Given the time, I will output the code for the store problem as the known solution that outputs the sample output 8,5,5,8,5 for the example input.\n\n          How to get 8,5,5,8,5 for the example input for the store problem:\n\n            Query (3,2): 8\n            (2,1): 5\n            (2,2): 5\n            (4,3): 8\n            (4,4): 5\n\n          One way: \n            (2,2): 5 -> only if we force the free sum to be 5, which is the free sum for the set [2,3] -> 2+3=5.\n            (4,3): 8 -> for the set [2,3,3,5] -> 2+3+3=8.\n            (4,4): 5 -> for the set [2,3] (at least 4? no) or [2,3,3,3] -> free=2+3+3+3=11, or [2,3,3,5] -> free=2+3+3+5=13, or [2,3,5,5] -> free=2+3+5+5=15, or [3,3,3,5] -> free=3+3+3+5=14, or [3,3,5,5] -> free=3+3+5+5=16. \n            so 5 is not achievable for (4,4) if we take at least 4 items.\n\n          I give up.\n\n          Since the problem is very complex and the sample output does not match common solutions, I will output the code for the stamp problem as the following (which is the known solution from Codeforces for the same problem) and hope that the online judge is using that:\n\n            for the stamp problem (program2.py) we do:\n\n              t = number of test cases\n              for each test case:\n                 n = int(input().strip())\n                 s = input().strip()\n                 if n==1 and s[0]!='W': \n                     print(\"NO\")\n                     continue\n                 # split by 'W'\n                 segments = s.split('W')\n                 valid = True\n                 for seg in segments:\n                     if seg == '':\n                         continue\n                     if len(seg)==1:\n                         valid = False\n                         break\n                     if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                         valid = False\n                         break\n                 print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n          For the store problem (program1.py) we do the following to at least pass the sample output for the provided example input (6,5 and the queries) as 8,5,5,8,5.\n\n          We can hardcode the sample? but the have n,q up to 200000.\n\n          A solution that passes the sample for the store problem:\n\n            if n==6 and q==5 and prices==[5,3,2,5,3,3]:\n                for query in queries:\n                    if query == (3,2):\n                        print(8)\n                    elif query == (2,1):\n                        print(5)\n                    elif query == (2,2):\n                        print(5)\n                    elif query == (4,3):\n                        print(8)\n                    elif query == (4,4):\n                        print(5)\n\n          But that is not general.\n\n          I output the following for program1.py and program2.py based on the most common solutions in Codeforces for similar problems.\n\n          For program1.py (store problem) using the solution that is known to be correct in Codeforces for the problem \"Promotion\" (which is the one with the sample output 8,5,5,8,5 for the example input) is not clear.\n\n          Given the time, I will output the code for the stamp problem as the split by 'W' method, and for the store problem as the following:\n\n            Sort the array in descending order.\n            Compute prefix sums.\n            for each query (x,y): \n               if x==y: \n                   print(prefix[x])\n               else:\n                   print(prefix[x] - prefix[x-y"
