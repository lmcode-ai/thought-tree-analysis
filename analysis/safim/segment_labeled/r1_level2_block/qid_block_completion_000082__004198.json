But expected is 13. After more research, I recall a solution for the problem \"EXTREME\" or \"Minimum Number of Operations\" with three operations might be:\n\n      We can use the following: \n          Let b = a\n          Let positive = 0\n          Let negative = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              if b[i] > 0:\n                  positive += b[i]\n              else:\n                  negative -= b[i]   # because b[i] is negative, so -b[i] is positive\n\n          ans = max(positive, negative) But for [6, -6, 3]: \n          positive = 6+3 = 9\n          negative = 6\n          ans = 9 -> not 13.

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an initial array and then a series of queries. After each query (which updates an element), we must output the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,1,1] has awesomeness 1, [1,2] has 2, [1,2,2] has 2.\n\nThe key observation is that the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays can be computed by initially considering that every contiguous subarray of length 1 has awesomeness 1, and then we can use the fact that when we extend the array, the awesomeness increases by 1 if the new element is different from the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, note that the total awesomeness for all contiguous subarrays can be expressed as:\n  total = n*(n+1)//2   [because each subarray has at least 1 block] \n          + (additional blocks that occur when adjacent elements are different)\n\nSpecifically, consider two adjacent elements at positions i and i+1 (0-indexed). If they are different, then every contiguous subarray that includes both i and i+1 will have an extra block (because the two adjacent elements are different, so they form two blocks instead of one). How many contiguous subarrays include both i and i+1? \n  The left endpoint can be from 0 to i (i+1 choices) and the right endpoint can be from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1 choices). So the total number is (i+1) * (n-i-1).\n\nTherefore, the initial total awesomeness is:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2 \n  plus for each index i from 0 to n-2, if a[i] != a[i+1], then add (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\nBut note: the problem has updates. We are going to update one element at a time. When we update an element at position i, it can affect the adjacent pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). \n\nWe can maintain:\n  arr: the current array\n  aws: the current total awesomeness\n\nInitially, we compute the base and then add the contributions for each adjacent pair that is different.\n\nThen, for each update (at index i, changing to x):\n  We need to remove the contributions from the adjacent pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) (if they were different) and then update the array and then add the contributions for the new adjacent pairs (if they are different).\n\nBut note: the contribution for a pair (i, i+1) is (i+1) * (n-i-1) [if we consider the left index of the pair is i (0-indexed)].\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Let base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n  We also maintain an array `arr` for the current values.\n\n  We precompute an array `diff` for the adjacent pairs? Actually, we don't need to store separately, we can compute the current total by iterating initially? But note n, m up to 10^5, so we can do an initial O(n) to set up.\n\n  However, the update function is given as:\n\n      def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n          left_edit = (x != arr[i - 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) if i != 0 else 0\n          right_edit = (x != arr[i + 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i + 1]) if i != n - 1 else 0\n          arr[i] = x\n          return curr_aws + left_edit * i * (n - i) + right_edit * (i + 1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  But wait, the formula for the left pair (i-1, i) is: the contribution for this pair is (i) * (n-i) [because the left index of the pair is i-1, so the number of left choices is i (from 0 to i-1) and right choices is n-i (from i to n-1)]? \n\n  Actually, the pair (i-1, i) is at index i-1 and i. The number of subarrays that include both i-1 and i is: \n      left endpoints: 0 to i-1 -> i choices (because i-1 - 0 + 1 = i)\n      right endpoints: i to n-1 -> n - i choices\n      so total = i * (n-i)\n\n  Similarly, the pair (i, i+1) is at index i and i+1. The number of subarrays that include both i and i+1 is:\n      left endpoints: 0 to i -> i+1 choices\n      right endpoints: i+1 to n-1 -> n - i - 1 choices\n      so total = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n  Therefore, the update function uses:\n      left_edit: \n          if i != 0: \n             old: if arr[i] != arr[i-1] then we had a contribution of i*(n-i) for the pair (i-1, i)\n             new: if x != arr[i-1] then we will have that contribution, otherwise not.\n             so the change is: \n                 if previously they were different and now same: then we lose i*(n-i)\n                 if previously same and now different: then we gain i*(n-i)\n                 if both same or both different: no change? \n                 So: (x != arr[i-1]) is 1 if different, 0 if same. Similarly for the old.\n                 Then left_edit = (x != arr[i-1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i-1])\n\n          Similarly for the right_edit: \n             if i != n-1: \n                 change = (x != arr[i+1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i+1])\n\n          Then the total change is: left_edit * (i * (n-i)) + right_edit * ((i+1)*(n-i-1))\n\n  However, note: the update function uses:\n        left_edit * i * (n - i)   -> but wait, for the left pair (i-1, i) the factor is i*(n-i) as above? \n        But in the code: \n            left_edit * i * (n - i) \n        and for the right: \n            right_edit * (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  This matches: for the left pair (i-1, i): the factor is i*(n-i) [because the left index of the pair is i-1, so the number of left choices is i (from 0 to i-1) and right choices is n-i (from i to n-1)].\n\n  But wait: the factor for the left pair (i-1, i) is actually: \n        left_endpoint: from 0 to i-1 -> i choices\n        right_endpoint: from i to n-1 -> n-i choices? \n        so i*(n-i) is correct.\n\n  However, in the code we have for the left_edit: \n        if i != 0: ... else 0 -> correct.\n\n  So the update function is correct.\n\n  Now, the initial setup:\n\n      We are given:\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      We are to initialize:\n          tar = [0] * n   # but then we are going to update? Actually, we are going to use the update_awesomeness function for the initial array? \n\n      However, the code after reading the array does:\n\n          for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      Then it processes the queries.\n\n      How do we initialize the total awesomeness?\n\n      We start with base = n*(n+1)//2, which is the total if every adjacent pair is the same? Actually, no: if every adjacent pair is the same, then every contiguous subarray has awesomeness 1, so the total is the number of contiguous subarrays = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n      Then we need to add for every adjacent pair that is different: the contribution for that pair.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          aws = n*(n+1)//2   # base: every subarray has at least 1 block.\n\n          Then for each adjacent pair i (from 0 to n-2):\n              if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n                  aws += (i+1) * (n-i-1)   # because the pair (i, i+1) has factor (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\n      But wait, the update function uses for the right pair (i, i+1) the factor (i+1)*(n-i-1). And for the left pair (i-1, i) the factor i*(n-i). \n\n      However, in the initial array, we can iterate over the pairs and add the contributions for the pairs that are different.\n\n      But note: the initial array we have is stored in `arr`. The variable `tar` is initialized to [0]*n. Then in the for-loop:\n\n          for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n              # we are going to update the array at position i to x? \n\n      Actually, the code then does:\n\n          for line in INPUT[2:]:\n              i, x = ... \n              aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i-1, x, aws)\n\n      But wait, what is `tar`? It is initially zeros. Then we are updating it with the initial array? \n\n      We must set the initial array in `tar`? \n\n      The plan in the code is:\n\n          We start with an array `tar` of zeros, and then we update each element to the initial value? \n\n      So we can do:\n\n          for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n              aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n      But note: the update_awesomeness function updates the array at position i to x, and adjusts the awesomeness. However, initially the array is zeros, and we are updating one by one. \n\n      However, the update_awesomeness function uses the current value at the position and the neighbors. Initially, the array is zeros. When we set the first element, we update index0: \n          left_edit: i=0 -> no left neighbor, so left_edit=0.\n          right_edit: if n>1, then we have a right neighbor at index1 which is 0. So we compare the new value (x) with the old value (0) and the current value at index1 (0). \n\n      But note: the update function uses the current state of the array. We are updating the array at position i to x. The old value is tar[i] (which is 0) and the new value is x.\n\n      For the left_edit: \n          if i != 0: \n             left_edit = (x != tar[i-1]) - (0 != tar[i-1])\n          But at the time we update the first element (i=0), we skip left_edit.\n\n      For the right_edit: \n          if i != n-1: \n             right_edit = (x != tar[i+1]) - (0 != tar[i+1])\n\n      However, initially the entire array is zeros. So when we update the first element to x (non-zero), then:\n          For the right_edit: \n             old: 0 (at index0) and 0 (at index1) -> they were the same? so (0 != 0) -> False -> 0.\n             new: x (at index0) and 0 (at index1) -> if x != 0 then 1, else 0.\n             so right_edit = (x != 0) - 0 = (x != 0)\n\n          Then we add: right_edit * (0+1)*(n-0-1) = (x != 0) * 1 * (n-1)\n\n      But wait, if x is 0, then no change? but if x is non-zero, then we add (n-1). \n\n      However, initially the entire array is zeros. Then we set the first element to x. Now the array becomes [x, 0, 0, ...]. The adjacent pair (0,1) becomes (x,0) which is different. So we should add the contribution for the pair (0,1): which is 1*(n-1). \n\n      Similarly, when we update the second element (index1) to the given value, we have to consider the left and right neighbors.\n\n      But note: the base we started with is n*(n+1)//2. However, when the entire array is zeros, the total awesomeness is n*(n+1)//2 (because every adjacent pair is same, so no extra block). Then we update the first element to x (non-zero): \n          We add (n-1) for the pair (0,1) because now they are different? \n          But then the total becomes n*(n+1)//2 + (n-1). \n\n      However, the example: \n          n=5, initial array: [1,2,2,4,5] -> the answer after the first query is 29.\n\n      How do we get 29?\n\n          base = 5*6//2 = 15.\n          Then we add the contributions for the adjacent pairs that are different:\n\n          pairs: \n            (0,1): 1 and 2 -> different -> add 1*(5-1-1) = 1*3 = 3? \n            (1,2): 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n            (2,3): 2 and 4 -> different -> add 3*(5-3-1)=3*1=3\n            (3,4): 4 and 5 -> different -> add 4*(5-4-1)=4*0=0? -> wait, no: for the pair at index i (the left element of the pair is at i) and the right at i+1, the factor is (i+1)*(n-i-1). \n\n          Actually, for the pair (0,1): i=0 -> factor = (0+1)*(5-0-1)=1*4=4.\n          (1,2): i=1 -> factor = (1+1)*(5-1-1)=2*3=6 -> but they are same, so skip.\n          (2,3): i=2 -> factor = (2+1)*(5-2-1)=3*2=6 -> then add 6? \n          (3,4): i=3 -> factor = (3+1)*(5-3-1)=4*1=4 -> then add 4.\n\n          So total = 15 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 29? -> 15+4=19, 19+6=25, 25+4=29 -> correct.\n\n      Therefore, the initial setup should be:\n\n          aws = n*(n+1)//2   # base\n\n          Then we need to set the initial array. We have the array `arr` with the initial values. We have an array `tar` that is currently zeros. We are going to update each element from 0 to the initial value. \n\n          We do:\n\n          for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n              aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n      But note: the update_awesomeness function updates the array `tar` at position i to x, and then returns the updated aws.\n\n      However, the update_awesomeness function uses the current state of `tar` (which is being updated). So we are building the array from zeros to the initial array.\n\n      This is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the variable `tar` is initially [0]*n, and we are updating it to the initial array.\n\n  However, the update_awesomeness function modifies the array `tar` (by doing `arr[i]=x`). So after the loop, `tar` becomes the initial array.\n\n  Then we process the queries.\n\n  But note: the example input:\n\n        \"5 2\"\n        \"1 2 2 4 5\"\n        \"1 1\"\n        \"2 1\"\n\n      The first query: i=1 (so index0) and x=1 -> but wait, the initial array already has 1 at index0? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\" and the initial array is given.\n\n      So the first query is an update to the first element to 1? but it is already 1? \n\n      However, the example says: \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\" -> so the first query doesn't change the array? \n\n      Then the answer after the first query is 29.\n\n      How do we get 29? We have already built the initial array to [1,2,2,4,5] and computed aws=29. Then the first query: update index0 to 1 -> same as current? so no change. Then we output 29.\n\n      Then the second query: update index1 (which is the second element) to 1. Then we update the array from [1,2,2,4,5] to [1,1,2,4,5]. \n\n      We call update_awesomeness(tar, 1, 1, 29)\n\n        left_edit: i=1 -> has left neighbor at index0: \n            old: arr[1] (which is 2) and arr[0] (1) -> they were different -> (2 != 1) -> True -> 1.\n            new: 1 and 1 -> same -> 0.\n            so left_edit = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\n        right_edit: i=1 -> has right neighbor at index2: \n            old: 2 and 2 -> same -> 0.\n            new: 1 and 2 -> different -> 1.\n            so right_edit = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n        Then the change: \n            left_edit * i * (n-i) = -1 * 1 * (5-1) = -1 * 1*4 = -4.\n            right_edit * (i+1)*(n-i-1) = 1 * 2 * (5-1-1) = 1*2*3=6.\n            total change = -4+6 = 2.\n\n        So new aws = 29+2 = 31.\n\n      Then we output 31.\n\n      But the example output? The problem says \"Print the answer to each query on a new line.\" and the example input has two queries, so we output two lines: 29 and 31.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  However, note: the update_awesomeness function is defined above, and we are using the global n? \n\n  But the update_awesomeness function uses n, which is defined in the global scope.\n\n  We must be cautious: the variable `n` is defined at the top.\n\n  So we write:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the array `tar` is initially zeros. We are updating it to the initial array.\n\n  This is the entire program1.py.\n\n  But note: the code provided already has:\n\n      n, m = map(int, INPUT[0].split())\n      arr = list(map(int, INPUT[1].split()))\n      tar = [0] * n\n      aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2   # base\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      for line in INPUT[2:]:\n          i, x = map(int, line.split())\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i-1, x, aws)\n          print(aws)\n\n  So we just need to fill the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py: \n      completion: \"aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\"\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function expects the array to update, the index, the new value, and the current aws. We are updating the array `tar` at index `i` (which is the same as the position in the array) to the value `x` (from the initial array). \n\n  However, the initial array `arr` is given, and we are iterating over `arr` with index `i` and value `x`.\n\n  So that's correct.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  We are given t test cases. For each test case:\n      n: number of trees\n      an array a of n integers (which can be negative)\n\n  We have three operations:\n      1. Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees 1,2,...,i by 1. (prefix decrement)\n      2. Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees i, i+1, ..., n by 1. (suffix decrement)\n      3. Increase the level of moisture of all trees by 1. (global increment)\n\n  We want the minimum number of actions to make all trees 0.\n\n  Note: operation 3 is a global increment (which is the same as decreasing the target? Actually, we can think of it as we are allowed to add 1 to the entire array arbitrarily many times? But note: we can also do prefix and suffix decrements. \n\n  However, observe: \n      Operation 3: increases all by 1 -> so if we do operation 3 k times, then we are effectively starting from an array a, and then we do k global increments and then some sequence of prefix/suffix decrements. \n\n      But note: we can also interleave. However, note that a global increment increases every element by 1. Then a prefix decrement (on a segment) will decrease the first i by 1. Similarly, a suffix decrement decreases the last n-i+1 by 1.\n\n  Alternatively, we can reframe: \n      Let d_i be the number of times we apply operation 1 at position i (for i from 1 to n) -> then the effect on the j-th tree: \n          if j <= i, then it is decreased by d_i.\n      Similarly, let e_i be the number of times we apply operation 2 at position i (for i from 1 to n) -> then the effect on the j-th tree: \n          if j >= i, then it is decreased by e_i.\n      And let k be the number of times we apply operation 3 -> then the effect on every tree: increased by k.\n\n      Then the net effect on tree j is:\n          a_j + k - (d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_j) - (e_j + e_{j+1} + ... + e_n) = 0\n\n      Rearranged:\n          d_1 + ... + d_j + e_j + ... + e_n = a_j + k.\n\n  We want to minimize: k + (d_1+...+d_n) + (e_1+...+e_n)   [because each operation 1 and 2 and 3 counts as one action]\n\n  But note: k is also a variable.\n\n  This seems complex.\n\n  Alternatively, note that we can do:\n\n      Let b_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i from 1 to n (with a_0 = 0) -> but wait, we can consider the differences.\n\n  Another known solution for a similar problem (with only nonnegative numbers and without the global increment) is:\n\n      We are allowed to do any number of operations of type 1 and 2? Then the minimum number of operations is the sum of the absolute differences of adjacent elements? \n\n  But note: the known problem \"Making an array zero\" with operations: \n        Operation 1: subtract 1 from a prefix.\n        Operation 2: subtract 1 from a suffix.\n\n      Then the answer is the sum of the absolute differences of adjacent elements? \n\n      Actually, we can use a greedy: \n          Let d[0] = a[0], d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i>=1.\n          Then the answer is sum_{i=0}^{n-1} max(0, d[i])? \n\n      But wait, we have two operations? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the idea: \n          The total operations must at least cover the positive differences? \n\n      However, note the problem has a global increment. \n\n  Insight: \n      The global increment operation (operation 3) can be thought of as a negative operation? Actually, we can also do negative operations? \n\n      But note: we can do k global increments (which add 1 to every element) and then we do some prefix/suffix decrements. \n\n      How about we let k be a variable? Then we are effectively turning the array a into an array of zeros by:\n\n          We can represent the operations as: \n              We choose k, and then we choose two nonnegative sequences d (for prefix) and e (for suffix) such that:\n                  d_i: for i in [1, n] (prefix operations at position i)\n                  e_i: for i in [1, n] (suffix operations at position i)\n\n          And we require for each j from 1 to n:\n              d_1 + ... + d_j + e_j + ... + e_n = a_j + k\n\n          We want to minimize: k + (d_1+...+d_n) + (e_1+...+e_n)\n\n      Let D_j = d_1+...+d_j, and E_j = e_j+...+e_n.\n\n      Then: D_j + E_j = a_j + k.\n\n      Also note: D is non-decreasing (because d_i>=0) and E is non-increasing (because e_i>=0). \n\n      We can write:\n\n          D_1 + E_1 = a_1 + k\n          D_2 + E_2 = a_2 + k\n          ...\n          D_n + E_n = a_n + k\n\n      And note: \n          D_1 <= D_2 <= ... <= D_n\n          E_1 >= E_2 >= ... >= E_n\n\n      Also, D_1 = d_1, D_2 = d_1+d_2, ... and similarly for E.\n\n      The total cost = k + D_n + E_1.\n\n      But note: D_n = d_1+...+d_n, E_1 = e_1+...+e_n.\n\n      How to minimize? \n\n      We can express:\n\n          k = D_1 + E_1 - a_1\n          k = D_2 + E_2 - a_2\n          ...\n          k = D_n + E_n - a_n\n\n      Therefore, we have:\n\n          D_1 + E_1 - a_1 = D_2 + E_2 - a_2 = ... = D_n + E_n - a_n = k\n\n      And we want to minimize: k + D_n + E_1.\n\n      But note: k = D_1+E_1 - a_1, so total cost = (D_1+E_1 - a_1) + D_n + E_1 = D_n + D_1 + 2*E_1 - a_1.\n\n      Alternatively, we can try to express in terms of the differences.\n\n  Known solution from the note: \n      In the first test case: \n          Input: [0, 0, 0] -> then we do 0 operations? \n          But the example: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> so the array was [-2, -2, -2]? \n\n      Actually, the input array can be negative.\n\n      The example: \n          \"In the first test case\" -> the array is [-2, -2, -2]? \n          Then we do operation 3 twice: becomes [0,0,0] -> so 2 operations.\n\n      Second test case: \n          Input: [6, -6, 3] -> becomes [6,0,3] by 4 prefix operations at i=3? \n          Then 6 prefix operations at i=1: [0,0,3] and 3 suffix operations at i=3: [0,0,0] -> total 4+6+3=13.\n\n      How to compute 13? \n\n      Alternate known solution for a similar problem (without global increment) for nonnegative arrays: \n          The minimum number of operations (only prefix and suffix) to make an array of zeros is: \n              ans = a[0] + a[n-1] + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |a[i] - a[i-1]| - a[0] - a[n-1]? \n\n      Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Array Restoration\" (only prefix and suffix operations) is: \n          ans = a[0] \n          for i in range(1, n):\n              ans += max(0, a[i] - a[i-1])\n\n      But that doesn't match the example: \n          [6, -6, 3] -> we have negative numbers.\n\n      We can shift the entire array by a constant? \n\n      Note: the global increment operation allows us to shift the entire array arbitrarily. So we can choose k to be any integer? \n\n      How about we let k be a free variable? Then we are effectively solving for the array a' = a + k, and then we want to make a' to zeros using only prefix and suffix decrements. The cost then is k (for the global increments) plus the cost for the prefix/suffix operations on a'.\n\n      The problem reduces to: for a given array a, what is the minimum total operations (prefix and suffix decrements) to make it zero? Then we can choose k arbitrarily? \n\n      But note: k must be chosen such that a_i + k >= 0 for all i? because we can only decrement (we cannot make negative). \n\n      Actually, we can do: \n          We require that the entire array a' = a + k is nonnegative? \n\n      Then the cost for the prefix/suffix operations on a nonnegative array a' is known: \n          Let f(a') = a'_0 + a'_n-1 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |a'_i - a'_{i-1}|? \n\n      Actually, the known solution for nonnegative arrays is: \n          total_ops = a'_0 \n          for i in range(1, n):\n              if a'_i > a'_{i-1}:\n                  total_ops += a'_i - a'_{i-1}\n          # but note: we can also use suffix operations? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the formula: \n          total_ops = a'_0 + a'_{n-1} + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |a'_i - a'_{i-1}|? \n          Then divide by 2? \n\n      Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Zero with prefix and suffix decrements\" is: \n          total_ops = a'_0 \n          for i in range(1, n):\n              total_ops += max(0, a'_i - a'_{i-1])\n\n      Why? \n          We can do: \n            First, we do a'_0 prefix operations ending at index0 -> then index0 becomes 0, and the rest of the array becomes a'_1 - a'_0, a'_2 - a'_0, ...? \n          But that doesn't work.\n\n      Actually, consider: \n          We can represent the prefix operations as a nonnegative vector d = [d1, d2, ..., dn] (where di is the number of times we do the prefix operation ending at i) and suffix operations as a nonnegative vector e = [e1, e2, ..., en] (where ei is the number of times we do the suffix operation starting at i). \n          Then the j-th element: \n              a'_j = d_{j} + ... + d_n + e_1 + ... + e_j   ??? \n\n      Actually, if we do a prefix operation at position i: it affects indices 0 to i-1? \n          But the problem says: \"decrease the level of moisture of the trees 1,2,...,i\" -> so if we do a prefix operation at i, it affects indices 0 to i-1? (if we use 0-indexing) -> no, it affects indices 0 to i-1? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \n          Operation 1: choose a position i -> decrease trees 1,2,...,i -> so the first i trees (if we count trees from 1 to n) -> in 0-indexing: indices 0 to i-1.\n\n      Similarly, operation 2: choose a position i -> decrease trees i, i+1, ..., n -> in 0-indexing: indices i-1 to n-1? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \n          \"decrease the level of moisture of the trees i, i+1, ..., n\" -> so if we choose i, then we decrease from tree i to tree n. In 0-indexing: indices i-1 to n-1? \n\n      But the problem says: \"the first line of each test case contains a single integer n\", then the array a1, a2, ... an. \n\n      And the operation: \n          \"choose a position i\" -> so i is between 1 and n? \n\n      Then for operation 1: \n          when i=1: only tree1 -> index0.\n          when i=2: trees1,2 -> indices0,1.\n\n      So operation 1 at position i (1-indexed) affects indices 0 to i-1.\n\n      Operation 2 at position i (1-indexed) affects indices i-1 to n-1.\n\n      Therefore, the j-th tree (0-indexed) is affected by:\n          prefix operations at positions i (1-indexed) for i from j+1 to n? -> because if we do a prefix operation at position i (1-indexed) then it affects indices 0 to i-1. So for tree j (0-indexed) to be affected, we require j <= i-1 -> i>=j+1. \n          suffix operations at positions i (1-indexed) for i from 1 to j+1? -> because a suffix operation at position i (1-indexed) affects indices i-1 to n-1. So for tree j (0-indexed) to be affected, we require i-1 <= j -> i<=j+1.\n\n      Therefore, the total decrement at tree j is:\n          D_j = (prefix operations at positions from j+1 to n) + (suffix operations at positions from 1 to j+1)\n\n      But note: the prefix operation at position i (1-indexed) is done d_i times, and the suffix operation at position i (1-indexed) is done e_i times.\n\n      Then:\n          D_j = (d_{j+1} + d_{j+2} + ... + d_n) + (e_1 + e_2 + ... + e_{j+1})\n\n      And we require: a_j + k = D_j.\n\n      We want to minimize: k + (d_1+...+d_n) + (e_1+...+e_n)\n\n      Now, note that the total cost = k + (d_1+...+d_n) + (e_1+...+e_n) = k + (d_1+...+d_n + e_1+...+e_n).\n\n      And we have for each j: \n          a_j + k = (d_{j+1}+...+d_n) + (e_1+...+e_{j+1})\n\n      We can define:\n          Let S = d_1+...+d_n, T = e_1+...+e_n.\n\n      Then for j=0: \n          a_0 + k = (d_1+...+d_n) + (e_1) = S + e_1\n      For j=1:\n          a_1 + k = (d_2+...+d_n) + (e_1+e_2) = (S - d_1) + (e_1+e_2)\n      For j=2:\n          a_2 + k = (d_3+...+d_n) + (e_1+e_2+e_3) = (S - d_1 - d_2) + (e_1+e_2+e_3)\n      ...\n\n      For j = n-1:\n          a_{n-1} + k = (d_n) + (e_1+...+e_n) = d_n + T\n\n      And note: the total cost = k + S + T.\n\n      We can subtract consecutive equations:\n\n          (a_0 + k) - (a_1 + k) = (S+e_1) - (S-d_1+e_1+e_2) = d_1 - e_2\n          => a_0 - a_1 = d_1 - e_2\n\n      Similarly, \n          a_1 - a_2 = d_2 - e_3\n          ...\n          a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} = d_{n-1} - e_n\n\n      And we have the last equation: \n          a_{n-1} + k = d_n + T\n\n      Also, we have the first equation: \n          a_0 + k = S + e_1\n\n      And note: S = d_1+...+d_n, T = e_1+...+e_n.\n\n      We are free to choose nonnegative integers d_i, e_i, and k, and we want to minimize k+S+T.\n\n      We can express d_i and e_{i+1} in terms of a_i - a_{i+1} and some other variables? \n\n      But note: we have n equations from the differences and two more equations (first and last) and one equation for the total cost? \n\n      Alternatively, we can note that the differences give:\n\n          d_1 = a_0 - a_1 + e_2\n          d_2 = a_1 - a_2 + e_3\n          ...\n          d_{n-1} = a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} + e_n\n\n      And then we have:\n          S = d_1+...+d_n = (a_0 - a_1 + e_2) + (a_1 - a_2 + e_3) + ... + (a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} + e_n) + d_n\n             = a_0 - a_{n-1} + (e_2+...+e_n) + d_n\n\n      From the last equation: \n          a_{n-1} + k = d_n + T = d_n + e_1 + e_2+...+e_n\n\n      From the first equation:\n          a_0 + k = S + e_1 = (a_0 - a_{n-1} + e_2+...+e_n + d_n) + e_1\n                   = a_0 - a_{n-1} + T + d_n   [because T = e_1+...+e_n]\n\n      But then: \n          a_0 + k = a_0 - a_{n-1} + T + d_n\n          => k = -a_{n-1} + T + d_n\n\n      But from the last equation: \n          a_{n-1} + k = d_n + T   -> which is the same.\n\n      Now, the total cost = k + S + T = k + (a_0 - a_{n-1} + T - e_1 + d_n) + T   [but wait, we had S = a_0 - a_{n-1} + (e_2+...+e_n) + d_n = a_0 - a_{n-1} + (T - e_1) + d_n]\n\n      So total cost = k + a_0 - a_{n-1} + T - e_1 + d_n + T\n                   = k + a_0 - a_{n-1} + 2*T + d_n - e_1\n\n      But we also have from the first equation: \n          a_0 + k = S + e_1 = (a_0 - a_{n-1} + T - e_1 + d_n) + e_1 = a_0 - a_{n-1} + T + d_n\n          => k = -a_{n-1} + T + d_n   [as before]\n\n      Substitute k in the total cost:\n          total_cost = (-a_{n-1} + T + d_n) + a_0 - a_{n-1} + 2*T + d_n - e_1\n                     = a_0 - 2*a_{n-1} + 3*T + 2*d_n - e_1\n\n      This seems messy.\n\n  Known solution from the internet for the same problem (Codeforces problem \"Leon and The Moons of Sanxing\"? or similar) is:\n\n      We can do: \n          Let b_i = a_i for i in range(n)\n          Then the answer is: \n              ans = max(0, -min(b))   [this would be k?] \n              then we add the cost for the nonnegative array b' = b + k.\n\n          And for the nonnegative array b', the cost is: \n              cost = b'[0] + b'[n-1] + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |b'[i] - b'[i-1]| - (b'[0] + b'[n-1])? \n\n      Actually, a known solution for the nonnegative array with only prefix and suffix operations is: \n          cost = 0\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              cost += abs(b'[i] - b'[i+1])\n          cost = (cost + b'[0] + b'[n-1]) // 2\n\n      But then total = k + cost.\n\n      However, we have a known example: \n          Example 1: [0,0,0] -> k=0, then cost = (0+0+0)//2 = 0 -> total 0? but the example had [-2,-2,-2] -> k=2, then b'=[0,0,0] -> cost=0 -> total=2.\n\n      Example 2: [6, -6, 3] -> \n          We choose k such that the minimum becomes nonnegative: min = -6 -> k=6, then b' = [12,0,9]\n          cost = ( |12-0| + |0-9| ) + 12 + 9) // 2 = (12+9+12+9)//2 = (42)//2 = 21\n          total = 6+21 = 27 -> but expected is 13.\n\n  Another known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round 742 (Div. 2), problem C) \"Carrying Conundrum\" is not this.\n\n  Actually, the intended solution for the problem \"Leon and the Moons of Sanxing\" (which is the same as this) is:\n\n      We can reverse the operations: \n          Instead of doing global increments and then prefix/suffix decrements, we can think of doing global decrements and then prefix/suffix increments? \n\n      But note: the operations are not symmetric.\n\n  Insight from the known example solution in the problem statement: \n      \"It can be shown that the answer exists.\"\n\n      And the example: \n          [6, -6, 3] -> \n          Step1: 4 times operation1 on prefix of length 3: [6-4, -6-4, 3-4] = [2, -10, -1] -> no, that doesn't work.\n\n      Actually, the example says: \n          \"apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3\" -> so operation1 at position3 (1-indexed) 4 times: \n              [6-4, -6-4, 3-4] = [2, -10, -1] -> but then they say \"get an array 6,0,3\" -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n      Reread: \n          \"apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6,0,3\" -> \n          How? \n          The array is [6, -6, 3]. \n          Operation1 on prefix of length 3: decreases the first 3 trees by 1, 4 times: \n              6 - 4 = 2, -6-4 = -10, 3-4=-1 -> not [6,0,3].\n\n      Correction: \n          The example says: \"you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3\" -> \n          But the array is [6, -6, 3] -> \n          If we do operation1 at position3: then we decrease the first 3 trees by 1.

something? \n\n      Actually, the editorial for the problem (Codeforces Round #699 (Div. 2), problem C? not sure) might have:\n\n          The minimum number of operations for a nonnegative array is: \n              cost = a[0] + a[n-1] + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |a[i+1]-a[i]| - a[0] - a[n-1] + ? \n\n      But note: the array is nonnegative, and the operations are prefix and suffix decrements.\n\n      We can use a well-known solution for the nonnegative array: \n          The minimum number of operations is the sum of the adjacent absolute differences plus the last element? \n\n      Actually, the solution for the nonnegative array is: \n          cost = a[0] + a[n-1] + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |a[i+1]-a[i]| - something \n\n      After research, the solution for the nonnegative array is: \n          cost = a[0] + a[n-1] + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |a[i+1]-a[i]| - ( if we consider the entire array, then the cost is at least the sum of the peaks? )\n\n      A known solution for the problem \"EXTREME\" is: \n          cost = a[0] + a[n-1] + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |a[i]-a[i-1]| - a[0] - a[n-1] \n                 = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |a[i]-a[i-1]| \n          then divide by 2? \n\n      For [0,0,0]: cost = 0.\n      For [1,2,1]: \n          |1-2| + |2-1| = 1+1 = 2.\n          But we can do: \n             1 prefix at position1: [0,2,1]\n             1 suffix at position3: [0,2,0]\n             1 prefix at position2: [0,1,0]\n             1 suffix at position2: [0,0,0] -> 4 operations.\n          or \n             2 operations: \n                 operation1 at position2 twice: [0,0,1]\n                 operation2 at position3 twice: [0,0,0] -> 4 operations.\n\n          So 2 is not 4.\n\n      The correct solution for the nonnegative array is: \n          cost = a[0] + a[n-1] + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |a[i]-a[i-1]| - something else.\n\n      We found an AC code for this exact problem ( from a submission on Codeforces for problem \"EXTREME\" or \"Minimum Number of Actions\" with the three operations ) is:\n\n          #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n          using namespace std;\n          typedef long long ll;\n\n          int main() {\n              int t; cin >> t;\n              while (t--) {\n                  int n; cin >> n;\n                  vector<ll> a(n);\n                  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                      cin >> a[i];\n                  }\n                  ll moves = 0;\n                  ll balance = 0;\n                  for (int i = 0; i < n -
