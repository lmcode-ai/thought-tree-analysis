Looking at the code again: \n    for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # so if a[:i] is [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}], then reversed is [a_{i-1}, a_{i-2}, ..., a0]\n\n    Then for the first k = a_{i-1}:\n        d = ceil((t+1)/k)   # t=0 -> ceil(1/k) -> 1\n        t = k * d = a_{i-1} * 1 = a_{i-1}\n        p += d   # so p=1 Then next k = a_{i-2}:\n        d = ceil((t+1)/k) = ceil((a_{i-1}+1)/a_{i-2})\n        t = a_{i-2} * d\n        p += d\n\nBut note: we are setting the value for the element to be t?",

Then for each k in a[i+1:] (from left to right). We want to set the values for the right part: \n    b_{i+1} > b_i = 0\n    b_{i+2} > b_{i+1}\n    ... So for the first element to the right (at index i+1): we require b_{i+1} > 0. The smallest positive multiple of a_{i+1} is a_{i+1} (so one move: add once). Then for the next, we require b_{i+2} > b_{i+1} = a_{i+1}. So we set b_{i+2} to the smallest multiple of a_{i+2} that is greater than a_{i+1}. How? We want d such that d * a_{i+2} > a_{i+1}. The smallest d (positive) is floor(a_{i+1} / a_{i+2]) + 1? But then the value is d * a_{i+2}. But note: the moves for that index is d. So the algorithm for the right part: \n    Let current = 0   # the value of b_i (fixed to 0) Then for each k in a[i+1:]: We want the smallest integer d (d>=1) such that d * k > current. Then the new current becomes d * k. And we add d to p. But note: d = ceil((current+1)/k) ? Example: \n    current = 0, k=1 -> d = ceil((0+1)/1)=ceil(1)=1 -> then new current=1, moves=1. Then next k=1: d = ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2 -> then new current=2, moves=1+2=3. But we want: \n    b0=0, b1=1, b2=2 -> but that requires 1+2=3 moves? but we can do b2=1? but 1 is not greater than 1. So we need 2. But the minimal d for the second element: we require d*1>1 -> d>=2 -> so d=2. So the formula d = ceil((current+1)/k) is correct? current=1, k=1: ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2 -> correct. Another example: \n    current=2, k=3: d = ceil((2+1)/3)=ceil(3/3)=ceil(1)=1 -> then new current=3, which is >2 -> correct. But what if current=3, k=2: \n    d = ceil((3+1)/2)=ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2 -> then new current=4 -> which is >3 -> correct. But what if current=3, k=5:\n    d = ceil(4/5)=ceil(0.8)=1 -> then new current=5 -> which is >3 -> correct. So the formula for the right part is: d = ceil((current+1)/k)\n    current = k * d\n    p += d But note: in the code, the variable t is used as current. So for the TODO in program2.py for the right part:\n\n    for k in a[i+1:]: d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\nBut note: we must import math if we haven't already (the code already imported math).",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The current code has a while loop that uses two pointers (i and j) and two sums (lsum for Alice and rsum for Bob). The goal is to find the maximum total number of candies eaten such that the total weight eaten by Alice (from the left) equals that eaten by Bob (from the right).\n\nThe current code has a TODO in the condition when rsum < lsum. We should handle that similarly to the lsum < rsum case.\n\nAlso note: the current code updates the best only when the sums are equal. However, note that the problem says that the total number of candies eaten is the sum of the candies from the left (by Alice) and from the right (by Bob). In the code, when the sums are equal, we set:\n    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\nWhy +2? Because i is the current left index (0-indexed) and j is the current right index (0-indexed). The number of candies Alice has eaten is i+1 (because she started at 0 and has moved to i, inclusive). Similarly, Bob has eaten (n-1 - j + 1) = (n - j) candies. But note: in the code, when we are at index i and j, we have already added arr[i] and arr[j]. So the total candies eaten is (i+1) + (n - j). And note that i+1 + n - j = i + (n - j) + 1. However, the code does i + (n-1-j) + 2 = i + n - 1 - j + 2 = i + n - j + 1 -> which is the same.\n\nBut note: the current code then does:\n    i += 1\n    lsum += arr[i]\n\nThis breaks the condition because we are moving one more step to the left and then we continue. However, we must note that after setting best, we move the left pointer and then the loop continues. But what if there is a possibility of having a longer sequence? We must continue to check.\n\nHowever, the problem is that we are only updating best when the sums are equal. We must also break the loop appropriately.\n\nBut note the example: \n    For the second test case: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6] -> the answer is 6? Actually the example says: \n        For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6.\n\nBut wait, the example input is not provided. However, the note says: \n    For the fourth test case: [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10] -> answer is 7.\n\nLooking at the code, we have a while loop that runs while i < j. We start with:\n    i=0, j=n-1\n    lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n\nThen we enter the loop. We have three conditions:\n\n1. lsum < rsum: then we move i to the right and add the next candy to lsum.\n2. rsum < lsum: then we should move j to the left and add the next candy to rsum. (This is the missing part)\n3. else (equal): then we record the current total candies (if it's the best so far) and then we move the left pointer (and add the next candy). Why move the left? We could also move the right? But note: we must continue to check for other possibilities. However, we can move either one. But if we move only the left, we might miss moving the right? Actually, we can break symmetry by moving one of them. However, the problem is that we want to maximize the total number of candies. \n\nBut note: when the sums are equal, we have a candidate. Then we move the left pointer (so we break the current equality) and then we continue. We might find another equality later? \n\nHowever, the problem is that the current code does not handle the case when rsum < lsum. We must complete that.\n\nSo for the missing part in program1.py:\n\n    elif rsum < lsum:\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because j is the current right pointer. We are moving j to the left (so j becomes j-1) and then we add arr[j] (which is the new j-th candy) to rsum.\n\nHowever, the current code for the equal case does:\n    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n    i += 1\n    lsum += arr[i]\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move the left pointer and then the next step we have an equality again? That would be a new candidate. But note: we are moving the left pointer and then the loop continues. This is acceptable.\n\nBut there is a problem: when we move the left pointer in the equal case, we are not checking if i becomes >= j? Actually, we do: after moving i, we then check the condition at the top of the loop. Similarly for the right.\n\nHowever, the current code does not update best in the other two conditions. Why? Because the problem is that we are only updating best when we have equality. And we are moving the pointers until they meet.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move the left pointer and then the sums become unequal? Then we continue until we get another equality? That is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the example [1,1] should yield 2. Let's simulate:\n\n    n=2, arr=[1,1]\n    i=0, j=1 -> lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0 + (2-1-1) + 2 = 0+0+2 = 2 -> then i becomes 1, lsum becomes 1+arr[1]=2. Then the loop condition: i=1, j=1 -> i<j fails -> loop ends. Then we print 2.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> we want 6? Because Alice eats [1,2,3] and Bob eats [1,2,3] -> total 6.\n\n    i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0 + (6-1-5) + 2 = 0 + (0) + 2 = 2? That's not 6.\n\nWait, let me recalc: \n    i=0 -> index0: 1\n    j=5 -> index5: 1\n    Then we set best = 0 + (6-1-5) + 2 = 0 + (0) + 2 = 2 -> then we move i to 1, lsum becomes 1+2=3.\n\nThen we have i=1, j=5: lsum=3, rsum=1 -> so we move j? No, because rsum < lsum -> so we do j=4, rsum=1+2=3. Now i=1, j=4: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> equal -> best = 1 + (6-1-4) + 2 = 1 + (1) + 2 = 4? But we want 6.\n\nWe see the problem: the formula for the total candies is (i+1) + (n - j). \n    When i=1 and j=4: \n        Alice has eaten candies at indices 0 and 1 -> 2 candies.\n        Bob has eaten candies at indices 5 and 4 -> 2 candies.\n        Total = 4.\n\nBut we want 6: meaning Alice eats the first 3 and Bob the last 3. How do we get that?\n\nWe must continue:\n\n    After the second equality, we set best=4, then we move i to 2, lsum=3+3=6.\n    Then i=2, j=4: lsum=6, rsum=3 -> so we move j: j=3, rsum=3+3=6.\n    Then i=2, j=3: lsum=6, rsum=6 -> equal -> best = 2 + (6-1-3) + 2 = 2 + (2) + 2 = 6.\n\nSo we get 6.\n\nTherefore, the code for the equal case is correct: we update best and then we move the left pointer (we could also move the right, but moving one is enough because we want to continue and check for a longer sequence? Actually, we are not necessarily getting a longer sequence by moving both? But note: we are only moving one at a time. And we are updating best every time we have an equality.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So we want the maximum total candies over the entire process.\n\nTherefore, the missing part for program1.py is:\n\n    elif rsum < lsum:\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we must be cautious of the index. We are using j as the current right pointer. When we subtract 1, we are moving j to the left. Then we add arr[j] (which is the candy at the new j) to rsum.\n\nHowever, what if j-1 is less than i? We break the loop condition at the top. So it's safe.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move the left pointer and then i becomes j? Then we break. So it's okay.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000. So the two-pointer approach is efficient.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are to complete the code for the increasing array problem. The problem: we start with an array b of zeros. We can perform operations: for each index i, we can add or subtract a_i any number of times. We want to make b strictly increasing (b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}) with the minimum total number of moves.\n\nThe current code sets up:\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list of n integers\n\nThen we have:\n    c = None   # will store the minimum moves\n    d = 0      # not used yet\n\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        p = 0   # total moves for this i? \n        t = 0   # some temporary variable\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        t = 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k*d\n            p += d\n\n        if c == None or p < c:\n            c = p\n\n    print(c)\n\nBut note: the problem is asking for the minimum number of moves. The current code iterates for each index i (from 0 to n-1). For each i, it does two loops: one for the right part (a[i+1:]) and one for the left part (a[:i] in reverse). Then it sets p as the total moves for this i? and then takes the minimum over i.\n\nWhat is the idea? \n\nWe note that we can choose the operations arbitrarily. The moves for each index i are independent. However, the constraints on b are:\n    b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\nWe can let b_i = c_i * a_i, where c_i is an integer (positive or negative). But note: we can do multiple moves on the same index? The problem says: in one move we can choose an integer i and add OR subtract a_i. So we can do multiple moves on the same index. Therefore, the value of b_i is a multiple of a_i (could be zero, positive, negative).\n\nThe goal is to assign to each i an integer c_i (which is the number of moves on i, but note: if we do 3 moves on i, then we have added or subtracted a_i three times, so the value is 3*a_i or -3*a_i, etc). However, the moves can be mixed: we can do 2 adds and 1 subtract -> then the net is +a_i. So the value is (number of adds - number of subtracts) * a_i. Let x_i = (number of adds - number of subtracts). Then the value is x_i * a_i.\n\nBut note: the total moves for index i is |x_i|? Because each move is either add or subtract.\n\nSo we want to choose integers x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1} such that:\n    x_0 * a_0 < x_1 * a_1 < ... < x_{n-1} * a_{n-1}\n\nand minimize the total moves: |x_0| + |x_1| + ... + |x_{n-1}|.\n\nHowever, the problem is complex. The note gives examples:\n\nExample 1: n=5, a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> we can do: \n    b0 = -1, b1=0, b2=1, b3=2, b4=3 -> then moves: \n        for index0: subtract once -> 1 move\n        for index1: 0 moves? but wait, we can leave it at 0? but then we have -1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 -> but note: we can also set index1 to 0 without any move? Actually, the problem says initially b_i=0. So we don't have to do anything for index1? But then we have -1 and 0: that's increasing. Then for index2: we need to set it to 1 -> one add. Similarly, index3: two adds? no, we can set it to 2 by two adds? but wait, we can also set it to 1? but then 1 is not greater than 1? so we need 2. Similarly, index4: 3. But wait, the example says 4 moves: subtract at index0, then add at index2, index3, index4 -> 4 moves.\n\nBut the example says: \n    \"The final array will be [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves\" -> wait, that doesn't match. They set index2 to 3? \n\nActually, the example says: \n    \"Example 1: you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively. The final array will be [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\"\n\nBut note: the array a is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]? Then:\n    b1: subtract a1 -> becomes -1? but the array index: they say b1 (which is index0?) -> then b0=-1.\n    Then they add a3 to b3: so b3 becomes 1 (from 0) -> one move.\n    Then add a4 to b4: becomes 1 -> then add again? to become 2? but they say 4 moves. Actually, they did:\n        b0: subtract -> 1 move -> becomes -1.\n        b2: add three times? to become 3 -> 3 moves? total 4? but then b1 is 0 (unchanged) and b3: add once -> 1, b4: add once -> 1? that doesn't give [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWait, the example input is not given. The example says: \n    \"Example 1: you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively.\"\n\nBut note: the array a has indices: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. So the array a is [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]. They are subtracting a1 from b1 -> meaning the first element of b (which is b1) is set to -a1? and then they add a3 to b3, a4 to b4, a5 to b5. So the array b becomes:\n    b1 = -a1\n    b2 = 0 (unchanged)\n    b3 = a3\n    b4 = a4\n    b5 = a5\n\nBut then the array is [-a1, 0, a3, a4, a5]. For this to be increasing:\n    -a1 < 0 -> true if a1>0.\n    0 < a3 -> true.\n    a3 < a4 -> true? not necessarily, but if a is [1,1,1,1,1] then we have [-1,0,1,1,1] -> but then 1 is not strictly greater than 1.\n\nSo they must have done multiple moves on the same index? \n\nThe example says: \"The final array will be [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5]\". So they set:\n    b0 = -1\n    b1 = 0\n    b2 = 3\n    b3 = 4\n    b4 = 5\n\nHow? \n    b0: subtract once -> -1 (1 move)\n    b1: leave at 0 (0 moves)\n    b2: add three times -> 0+3=3 (3 moves)\n    b3: add four times? but a3=1 -> 4 moves? then total moves would be 1+3+4+5? \n\nActually, the example says 4 moves. So they must have set:\n    b0: subtract once -> 1 move -> -1\n    b1: 0 (0 moves)\n    b2: add three times -> 3 moves -> 3\n    b3: add once? -> 1 move -> 1? but then 3>1 -> not increasing.\n\nAlternatively, they set b2 to 3 by three moves, then b3 to 4 by one more move (so 3+1=4 moves) and then b4 to 5 by one more move? but that would be 5 moves. \n\nBut the example says 4 moves. So they did:\n    b0: subtract -> 1 move\n    b2: add three times -> 3 moves\n    b3: add once? but then b3=1 -> not 4.\n\nI think the example might have a different array a. The example says: \n    \"Example 1: you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively.\"\n\nBut note: the array a might be [1, 0, 3, 4, 5]? but the problem says a_i are positive integers. \n\nAlternatively, the example might be: \n    a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> but then to get b2=3, we need 3 moves (add three times). Then to get b3=4, we need one more move (so total 4 moves for the last two? but then total moves 1+3+1+1=6?).\n\nI think the example is not matching. But the note says: \n    Example 1: ... The final array will be [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\n\nSo the array a must be [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]? Then:\n    b0: subtract a0 (which is 1) -> becomes -1 (1 move)\n    b1: 0 (0 moves)\n    b2: add a2 (which is 3) once -> becomes 3 (1 move) -> but then 3 is the value? but they say 3,4,5 -> so then:\n    b3: add a3 (4) once -> becomes 4 (1 move)\n    b4: add a4 (5) once -> becomes 5 (1 move)\n    Total moves: 1+1+1+1 = 4.\n\nBut then the array b: [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5] -> which is increasing.\n\nSo a = [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]? \n\nBut the problem says: the array a is given. So the example input might be that.\n\nNow, the problem: we are to compute the minimum moves.\n\nThe current code iterates over each index i. What is i? It seems that the code is considering that the element at position i is fixed at 0? But note: the example: we left b1 at 0. So perhaps the idea is to fix one index to be 0? and then compute the moves for the rest? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require any index to be 0. We can set any multiples.\n\nThe current code for the left part (reversed(a[:i])):\n    for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n        d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n        t = k*d\n        p += d\n\nWhat is t? It is initialized to 0 for the left part. Then for each element k (from the element immediately to the left of i going leftwards), we compute d = ceil((t+1)/k), then set t = k*d, and add d to p.\n\nWhat does this do? \n\nConsider: we want the sequence to be increasing. So if we fix b_i = 0, then the element to the left (at index i-1) must be less than 0. How much? It must be at most -1? But we can set it to any multiple of a[i-1]. The minimal absolute value? We want to minimize moves. So we set b_{i-1} to the largest multiple of a[i-1] that is less than 0? Actually, we want it to be as close to 0 as possible (but negative). The largest negative multiple? That would be -a[i-1]? But then we have -a[i-1] < 0 -> which is true. But what if we have two to the left? Then we require b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} = -a[i-1]. So we set b_{i-2} to the largest multiple of a[i-2] that is less than -a[i-1]. \n\nBut note: we are going backwards from i to the left. So we start at i and go left. The current value at i is 0. Then for the element at i-1: we set it to -d1 * a[i-1] for some positive integer d1? But we want the smallest d1 such that -d1 * a[i-1] < 0? The smallest d1 is 1 -> then we set it to -a[i-1]. Then for i-2: we require b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} = -a[i-1]. So we set b_{i-2} to the next multiple of a[i-2] that is less than -a[i-1]. How? \n\nWe require: \n    x * a[i-2] < -a[i-1]\n\nWe want the smallest |x| (which is x, since x is negative) but we want the minimal number of moves? Actually, the moves for that index is |x|. But note: we can set x to be negative. So we are looking for the largest integer x (negative) such that x * a[i-2] < -a[i-1]. But note: the largest (closest to zero) that is still less than -a[i-1] is not necessarily minimal in |x|. \n\nAlternatively, we can set x to be the smallest integer (in absolute value) such that x * a[i-2] < -a[i-1]. But note: we can set x to be the floor? \n\nActually, the code does:\n    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n\nBut note: t is the value of the next element to the right (which we just set). In the left part, we are going from i-1 to 0. But in the loop we are going from the element immediately left of i (which is at index i-1) and then to the left. And we set t to the value we set for that element? \n\nIn the first iteration for the left part (closest to i on the left): \n    k = a[i-1]\n    t = 0 (from the initialization for the left part)\n    d = ceil((0+1)/k) = ceil(1/k). Since k>=1, then 1/k <= 1. So ceil(1/k)=1 if k>=1? \n    Then we set t = k * d = a[i-1] * 1 = a[i-1]? but wait, we are setting the value for the left element to be a[i-1]? but that is positive? we need it to be negative.\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be setting the value for the left element to be -d * k? Then the condition: we require -d * k < t (which is the next element to the right, which is the one we set after). But note: we are going from right to left. So the next element to the right (which is the one we just set) is at index i-1, and we are setting the element at i-2. \n\nBut the code uses:\n    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n\nand then sets t = k * d.\n\nBut if we are setting the element at i-1 to be -d1 * a[i-1]? then the value for the element at i-1 is negative. Then for the element at i-2, we require b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} = -d1 * a[i-1]. \n\nSo we set b_{i-2} = -d2 * a[i-2] for some positive integer d2, and we require:\n    -d2 * a[i-2] < -d1 * a[i-1]\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\n    d2 * a[i-2] > d1 * a[i-1]\n\nWe want the smallest d2 (to minimize moves) such that d2 * a[i-2] > d1 * a[i-1]. The smallest d2 is floor(d1 * a[i-1] / a[i-2]) + 1? \n\nBut note: the code does:\n    d = ceil((t+1)/k)\n\nHere, k is a[i-2] (the current element we are setting) and t is the value of the element to the right (which is b_{i-1} = -d1 * a[i-1]). But wait, the code sets t to 0 initially for the left part. Then it uses t in the computation. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the code again: \n    for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # so if a[:i] is [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}], then reversed is [a_{i-1}, a_{i-2}, ..., a0]\n\n    Then for the first k = a_{i-1}:\n        d = ceil((t+1)/k)   # t=0 -> ceil(1/k) -> 1\n        t = k * d = a_{i-1} * 1 = a_{i-1}\n        p += d   # so p=1\n\n    Then next k = a_{i-2}:\n        d = ceil((t+1)/k) = ceil((a_{i-1}+1)/a_{i-2})\n        t = a_{i-2} * d\n        p += d\n\nBut note: we are setting the value for the element to be t? and then we use that for the next left element? \n\nBut we require the sequence to be increasing from left to right. So if we are going from right to left, we require:\n    ... < b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} < b_i = 0.\n\nSo we set b_{i-1} to be -a_{i-1}? (because d=1 -> then value = -1 * a_{i-1}? but the code sets t = a_{i-1} (positive) and then uses that in the next iteration? \n\nThis suggests that the code is not storing the actual value of b but the magnitude of the negative value? \n\nAlternatively, the code is setting the absolute value of the gap? \n\nBut the problem is: the code for the left part is already written. We only need to complete the right part.\n\nThe right part: \n    for k in a[i+1:]:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are iterating over the elements to the right of i. We start with p=0 and t=0. Then for each k in a[i+1:] (from left to right). \n\nWe want to set the values for the right part: \n    b_{i+1} > b_i = 0\n    b_{i+2} > b_{i+1}\n    ...\n\nSo for the first element to the right (at index i+1): we require b_{i+1} > 0. The smallest positive multiple of a_{i+1} is a_{i+1} (so one move: add once). Then for the next, we require b_{i+2} > b_{i+1} = a_{i+1}. So we set b_{i+2} to the smallest multiple of a_{i+2} that is greater than a_{i+1}. \n\nHow? \n    We want d such that d * a_{i+2} > a_{i+1}. The smallest d (positive) is floor(a_{i+1} / a_{i+2]) + 1? But then the value is d * a_{i+2}. \n\nBut note: the moves for that index is d.\n\nSo the algorithm for the right part: \n    Let current = 0   # the value of b_i (fixed to 0)\n    Then for each k in a[i+1:]:\n        We want the smallest integer d (d>=1) such that d * k > current.\n        Then the new current becomes d * k.\n        And we add d to p.\n\nBut note: d = ceil((current+1)/k) ? \n\nExample: \n    current = 0, k=1 -> d = ceil((0+1)/1)=ceil(1)=1 -> then new current=1, moves=1.\n    Then next k=1: d = ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2 -> then new current=2, moves=1+2=3.\n\nBut we want: \n    b0=0, b1=1, b2=2 -> but that requires 1+2=3 moves? but we can do b2=1? but 1 is not greater than 1. So we need 2.\n\nBut the minimal d for the second element: we require d*1>1 -> d>=2 -> so d=2. \n\nSo the formula d = ceil((current+1)/k) is correct? \n    current=1, k=1: ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2 -> correct.\n\nAnother example: \n    current=2, k=3: d = ceil((2+1)/3)=ceil(3/3)=ceil(1)=1 -> then new current=3, which is >2 -> correct.\n\nBut what if current=3, k=2: \n    d = ceil((3+1)/2)=ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2 -> then new current=4 -> which is >3 -> correct.\n\nBut what if current=3, k=5:\n    d = ceil(4/5)=ceil(0.8)=1 -> then new current=5 -> which is >3 -> correct.\n\nSo the formula for the right part is: \n    d = ceil((current+1)/k)\n    current = k * d\n    p += d\n\nBut note: in the code, the variable t is used as current. \n\nSo for the TODO in program2.py for the right part:\n\n    for k in a[i+1:]:\n        d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\nBut note: we must import math if we haven't already (the code already imported math).\n\nHowever, the code already has a loop for the right part and then a loop for the left part. And then we take the minimum p over i.\n\nBut what is the meaning of i? The code is iterating i from 0 to n-1. For each i, we fix b_i=0? Then we compute the moves for the entire array: \n    For the left part (indices < i): we set them to be decreasing (so that they are less than 0) and we use the algorithm for the left part (which we already have) and for the right part (which we just completed) we set them to be increasing (greater than 0).\n\nBut note: the problem does not require any index to be 0. However, by setting one index to 0 we might reduce the total moves? \n\nBut why is this valid? Because we can choose the operations arbitrarily. We can set one index to 0 without any move (if we do nothing) and then adjust the others. But note: we are allowed to do moves on every index arbitrarily. \n\nHowever, the problem does not require that we leave any index at 0. But by setting one index to 0 we are not increasing the moves? Actually, we are saving moves on that index. \n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to do moves on the same index multiple times. So we can set any index to 0 by doing nothing? if we start at 0. \n\nTherefore, the idea is: we choose an index i to leave at 0 (so 0 moves for that index) and then we adjust the left part to be strictly decreasing (from left to right) and the right part to be strictly increasing (from left to right). Then the entire array is strictly increasing.\n\nBut note: the left part must be increasing? Actually, the entire array must be increasing: \n    ... < b_{i-1} < b_i = 0 < b_{i+1} < ...\n\nSo the left part (indices < i) must be strictly increasing? But wait: the condition is that the array b is increasing from index0 to index_{n-1}. So if we have:\n    b0, b1, ..., b_{i-1}, 0, b_{i+1}, ... \n    we require: \n        b0 < b1 < ... < b_{i-1} < 0 < b_{i+1} < ... \n\nSo the left part is increasing? But the values are negative? and increasing means: b0 < b1 < ... < b_{i-1} (which is negative and increasing to 0). \n\nBut the algorithm for the left part: we are going from i-1 down to 0. We set the value for i-1 first, then i-2, then ... \n\nThe algorithm for the left part (as given) is:\n    t = 0\n    for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # k goes from a_{i-1} to a0\n        d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\nBut what is t? In the left part, we start at the element i-1 (which is the closest to i). We set d = ceil((0+1)/k) = 1, then t = k. Then for the next (i-2): d = ceil((k+1)/a_{i-2})? \n\nBut we require: \n    b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} = -k?   [because we set b_{i-1} to -k? but the algorithm sets t to k (positive) and then uses that as the magnitude?]\n\nActually, the algorithm for the left part is similar to the right part but in the negative direction. We want to set the left elements to negative values. The condition: \n    b_{i-1} must be less than 0 -> so we set it to -d1 * a_{i-1] for the smallest d1 (which is 1) -> so -a_{i-1}.\n    Then b_{i-2} must be less than b_{i-1} = -a_{i-1}. So we set it to -d2 * a_{i-2] such that -d2 * a_{i-2] < -a_{i-1] -> d2 * a_{i-2] > a_{i-1]. The smallest d2 is ceil(a_{i-1] / a_{i-2])? \n\nBut note: the algorithm does:\n    d = ceil((t+1)/k)   # here t is the previous value of the magnitude? but in the first step t=0, so d=ceil(1/k)=1.\n    then t = k * d = a_{i-1] * 1 = a_{i-1]\n\n    Then for the next: \n        k = a_{i-2]\n        d = ceil((a_{i-1] + 1) / a_{i-2])\n\nThis matches: we require d2 such that d2 * a_{i-2] >= a_{i-1] + 1? \n    Then the value set for b_{i-2] is -d2 * a_{i-2] which is less than -a_{i-1] (because d2 * a_{i-2] >= a_{i-1]+1 > a_{i-1] -> so -d2 * a_{i-2] <= - (a_{i-1]+1) < -a_{i-1]).\n\nSo the algorithm for the left part is: \n    We are storing in t the absolute value of the next element to the right (which is the one we just set) in the left part. Then for the current element (with value k), we set d = ceil((t+1)/k) -> which is the smallest integer d such that d*k >= t+1. Then the value we set for the current element is -d*k. Then we update t = d*k (the absolute value) for the next (more left) element.\n\nTherefore, the entire code for program2.py is:\n\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        p = 0\n        t = 0\n        # Right part: from i+1 to end\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)   # because we require the next value to be at least t+1 (so strictly greater than t, the previous value)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n        t = 0\n        # Left part: from i-1 down to 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n        if c is None or p < c:\n            c = p\n\n    print(c)\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: n up to 5000, and we are iterating over i (n iterations) and each iteration does O(n) work. So total O(n^2) which is 25e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? But 25e6 iterations might be borderline in Python. However, the problem says n>=2 and <=5000, so 5000*5000=25e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in C++ but in Python it might be borderline. But we must hope.\n\nBut note: the problem says the array a has positive integers. So we are safe from division by zero.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is the inner loop for the right part.\n\nBut note: the code already has a line after the right part loop: \n    t = 0\n    for k in reversed(a[:i]): ... \n\nSo we only need to complete the first inner loop (the right part).\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = math.ceil((t+1) / k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\nBut note: we must use integer arithmetic? But k and t are integers. However, (t+1)/k might be fractional. The math.ceil works for floats. But if t and k are large, we might have floating point precision issues. \n\nAlternative: we can compute d without floating point:\n\n    d = (t + 1 + k - 1) // k   # because ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1 + k - 1) // k\n\nBut note: \n    ceil(x) = (x-1)//1 + 1? \n    Actually: \n        if (t+1) % k == 0: then d = (t+1)//k\n        else: d = (t+1)//k + 1\n\nSo we can do:\n    if (t+1) % k == 0:\n        d = (t+1) // k\n    else:\n        d = (t+1) // k + 1\n\nBut the problem: k can be very large (up to 10^9) and t can be large too. But we are doing integer arithmetic. However, the code uses math.ceil, which is acceptable? But the problem says a_i can be up to 10^9, and t is the product of d and k from the previous step, which might be huge. But we are using floating point for ceil? that might lose precision.\n\nTo avoid floating point, we can use integer arithmetic. But the problem does not specify the constraints on the total moves. However, the problem says the minimum number of moves, which might be large, but we are storing it in p.\n\nBut the problem: the example with n=7 and a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> the answer is 10? \n\nBut if we fix i=3 (the middle) then:\n    left part: [1,1,1] (from index0 to index2) -> \n        reversed: [1,1,1] (from index2 to index0)\n        k=1: d = ceil((0+1)/1)=1 -> t=1 -> moves=1\n        k=1: d = ceil((1+1)/1)=2 -> t=2 -> moves=1+2=3\n        k=1: d = ceil((2+1)/1)=3 -> t=3 -> moves=6\n    right part: [1,1,1,1] (from index4 to index6) -> \n        k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1 -> t=1 -> moves=1\n        k=1: d=ceil((1+1)/1)=2 -> moves=3\n        k=1: d=ceil((2+1)/1)=3 -> moves=6\n        k=1: d=ceil((3+1)/1)=4 -> moves=10\n    total p = 6+10 = 16.\n\nBut the example says 10 moves for [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n\nWait, the example says: \n    \"Example 2: you can reach [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves.\"\n\nSo if we fix i=3 (the middle) at 0, then:\n    left part: \n        index2: -1 (1 move)\n        index1: -2 (1 more move: subtract twice? but wait, we can do two moves: subtract twice -> then value = -2 -> total moves=2 for index1? \n        index0: -3 (3 moves: subtract three times) -> moves=3\n        total left moves = 1+2+3 = 6?\n    right part:\n        index4: 1 (1 move)\n        index5: 2 (1 move: add twice? then moves=2)\n        index6: 3 (1 move: add three times? moves=3)\n        total right moves = 1+2+3 = 6\n    total = 12.\n\nBut the example says 10. How? \n    They did: \n        b0: -3: 3 moves\n        b1: -2: 1 move (because we subtract once from 0? but then we get -1, so we need two moves? to get -2: subtract twice -> 2 moves)\n        b2: -1: 1 move\n        b3: 0: 0 moves\n        b4: 1: 1 move\n        b5: 2: 1 move (add twice? 2 moves) \n        b6: 3: 1 move (add three times? 3 moves)\n\n    Total = 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12? \n\nAlternatively, they did:\n    b0: subtract 3 times -> 3 moves -> -3\n    b1: subtract 2 times -> 2 moves -> -2\n    b2: subtract 1 time -> 1 move -> -1\n    b3: 0\n    b4: add 1 time -> 1 move -> 1\n    b5: add 2 times -> 2 moves -> 2\n    b6: add 3 times -> 3 moves -> 3\n    total = 3+2+1+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nBut the example says 10 moves. \n\nI see: the example says: \n    \"Example 2: you can reach [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves.\"\n\nHow 10? \n    b0: -3: 3 moves\n    b1: -2: 1 move? (because we can do: from 0, subtract 2 at once? but we can only add or subtract a_i at a time. But a_i is 1 for all. So each move is 1. So we must do 3 moves for b0, 2 for b1, 1 for b2, 0 for b3, 1 for b4, 2 for b5, 3 for b6 -> total 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nI think the example might be using a different a. The problem says: \n    \"Example 2: ... in 10 moves\"\n\nwithout giving the array a. \n\nAlternatively, the example might be: \n    a = [3,2,1,1,1,2,3]? \n    Then:\n        b0: -3: 1 move (because a0=3: subtract once -> -3)\n        b1: -2: 1 move (a1=2: subtract once -> -2)\n        b2: -1: 1 move (a2=1: subtract once -> -1)\n        b3: 0: 0\n        b4: 1: 1 move (a4=1: add once)\n        b5: 2: 1 move (a5=2: add once)\n        b6: 3: 1 move (a6=3: add once)\n        total = 1+1+1+0+1+1+1 = 6.\n\nThat is not 10.\n\nAlternatively, a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] and they did:\n    b0: -3: 3 moves\n    b1: -2: 1 move (but wait, we can do: at b1, we start at 0. We subtract once -> -1, then subtract again -> -2: 2 moves)\n    b2: -1: 1 move\n    b3: 0\n    b4: 1: 1 move\n    b5: 2: 2 moves\n    b6: 3: 3 moves\n    total = 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says: \n    \"in one move you can choose an integer i (1<=i<=n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\"\n\nSo each move is one operation on one index. \n\nThe example says 10 moves. How? \n    They might have done:\n        b0: subtract 3 times -> 3 moves\n        b1: subtract 2 times -> 2 moves\n        b2: subtract 1 time -> 1 move\n        b3: 0\n        b4: add 1 time -> 1 move\n        b5: add 1 time -> 1 move? but then b5=1, but we need 2 -> so then add again -> 2 moves\n        b6: add 1 time -> 1 move? then 3? so then add two more times? 3 moves? \n        total = 3+2+1+1+2+3 = 12.\n\nI think the example might be for a different array. Let me check the sample test cases.\n\nThe problem says: \n    Example 1: n=5, a = [1, 1, 3, 4, 5] -> 4 moves.\n\nBut our algorithm for i=1 (so b1=0) for the array [1,1,3,4,5]:\n    left part: a[:1] = [1] -> reversed: [1]\n        k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1 -> p=1, t=1.\n    right part: a[2:] = [3,4,5]\n        k=3: d=ceil((0+1)/3)=ceil(1/3)=1 -> p=1, t=3\n        k=4: d=ceil((3+1)/4)=ceil(4/4)=1 -> p=2, t=4\n        k=5: d=ceil((4+1)/5)=ceil(5/5)=1 -> p=3, t=5\n    total p = 1 (left) + 3 (right) = 4.\n\nSo that matches.\n\nExample 2: the 10 moves example. The array might be [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n    We try i=3 (the middle) -> then:\n        left: [1,1,1] -> \n            k=1: d=ceil(1/1)=1 -> t=1, p=1\n            k=1: d=ceil((1+1)/1)=2 -> t=2, p=3\n            k=1: d=ceil((2+1)/1)=3 -> t=3, p=6\n        right: [1,1,1,1] -> \n            k=1: d=ceil(1/1)=1 -> p=1, t=1\n            k=1: d=ceil(2/1)=2 -> p=3, t=2? wait, no: \n                first: d=ceil(1/1)=1 -> t=1 -> p=1\n                second: d=ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2 -> t=1*2=2 -> p=1+2=3\n                third: d=ceil((2+1)/1)=3 -> t=3 -> p=6\n                fourth: d=ceil((3+1)/1)=4 -> t=4 -> p=10\n        total p = 6+10 = 16.\n\nBut the example says 10 moves. \n\nWhat if we choose a different i? \n    i=0: \n        left: none -> p=0\n        right: a[1:]=[1,1,1,1,1,1] -> \n            k=1: d=ceil(1/1)=1 -> t=1, p=1\n            k=1: d=ceil(2/1)=2 -> t=2, p=3\n            k=1: d=ceil(3/1)=3 -> t=3, p=6\n            k=1: d=ceil(4/1)=4 -> t=4, p=10\n            k=1: d=ceil(5/1)=5 -> t=5, p=15\n            k=1: d=ceil(6/1)=6 -> t=6, p=21\n        total=21.\n\n    i=1:\n        left: a[0:1]=[1] -> p=1 (as above)\n        right: a[2:]=[1,1,1,1,1] -> \n            k=1: ceil(1/1)=1 -> p=1, t=1\n            k=1: ceil(2/1)=2 -> p=3, t=2\n            k=1: ceil(3/1)=3 -> p=6, t=3\n            k=1: ceil(4/1)=4 -> p=10, t=4\n            k=1: ceil(5/1)=5 -> p=15, t=5\n        total = 1 (left) + 15 = 16.\n\n    i=2:\n        left: a[0:2]=[1,1] -> \n            reversed: [1,1] -> \n                k=1: ceil(1/1)=1 -> t=1, p=1\n                k=1: ceil(2/1)=2 -> t=2, p=3\n            right: a[3:]=[1,1,1,1] -> \n                k=1: ceil(1/1)=1 -> p=1, t=1\n                k=1: ceil(2/1)=2 -> p=3, t=2\n                k=1: ceil(3/1)=3 -> p=6, t=3\n                k=1: ceil(4/1)=4 -> p=10, t=4\n            total = 3+10=13.\n\n    i=4:\n        left: a[0:4]=[1,1,1,1] -> \n            reversed: [1,1,1,1] -> \n                k=1: ceil(1/1)=1 -> p=1, t=1\n                k=1: ceil(2/1)=2 -> p=3, t=2\n                k=1: ceil(3/1)=3 -> p=6, t=3\n                k=1: ceil(4/1)=4 -> p=10, t=4\n            right: a[5:]=[1,1] -> \n                k=1: ceil(1/1)=1 -> p=1, t=1\n                k=1: ceil(2/1)=2 -> p=3, t=2\n            total=10+3=13.\n\n    i=5: symmetric to i=1 -> 16.\n    i=6: 21.\n\nThe minimum is 13? but the example says 10.\n\nWhat if we do not fix any index at 0? The problem does not require that. But our algorithm fixes one index at 0. \n\nBut the example solution: \n    They reached [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> which has a 0. So they fixed the middle at 0.\n\nBut our algorithm for i=3 (the middle) gave 16 moves.\n\nWhat is the intended solution for the 10 moves example? \n    The example says: 10 moves.\n\nAfter checking known problems: This is problem B from a Codeforces round. The intended solution is dynamic programming. \n\nBut the problem: we are given a code structure. We must complete the code as given.\n\nGiven the code structure, we must complete the inner loop for the right part as described.\n\nBut the example [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] might be intended to be solved by a different i? \n\nWait, the example says 10 moves. How can they achieve 10 moves? \n    They might not fix any index at 0? \n\nBut the problem: the initial b is zeros. We can change arbitrarily. \n\nThe intended solution: \n    Let b0 be any multiple of a0, b1 any multiple of a1, ... such that b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}. \n    We want to minimize |b0|/a0 + |b1|/a1 + ... but wait, the moves for index i is |x_i|, and b_i = x_i * a_i, so |x_i| = |b_i|/a_i. But b_i is an integer multiple of a_i.\n\n    We can use dynamic programming: \n        dp[i][j] = minimum total moves for the prefix ending at i such that b_i = j * a_i. \n    But j can be very large.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy with two pointers? \n\nBut the given code structure is:\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        p = 0\n        t = 0\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            ... # we complete this\n        t = 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            ... # already given\n        update c = min(c, p)\n\nSo we must complete the right part as described.\n\nGiven the sample [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] and i=3 yields 16, but the minimum over i might be 13 (at i=2 and i=4) and the example says 10, there is a discrepancy.\n\nBut the example says: \n    \"Example 2: you can reach [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves.\"\n\nSo they are indeed using i=3 (the middle) and the moves for the left part: \n    to get -3,-2,-1: \n        b0: -3: 3 moves\n        b1: -2: 2 moves\n        b2: -1: 1 moves\n        total left = 6\n    right part:\n        b4: 1: 1 move\n        b5: 2: 2 moves\n        b6: 3: 3 moves\n        total right = 6\n    total = 12.\n\nBut they say 10. \n\nUnless they are not doing the moves independently per index? The problem allows multiple moves on the same index. But the moves are counted per operation. \n\nI see the issue: the example says 10 moves, but our count is 12. \n\nAfter checking a known solution for the problem (Codeforces round 727, problem B): \n    The intended solution is to use a different approach: \n        We let b0 be any integer, then b1 = b0 + 1, b2 = b1+1, ... but wait.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use: \n        b_i = b_{i-1} + 1 + k * a_i, for some k>=0? \n\n    But the known solution uses:\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            # We need b[i] > b[i-1]\n            # Let b[i] = b[i-1] + 1 + x * a[i] for some x>=0? \n            # But we can also set b[i] = any multiple of a[i] that is > b[i-1]. \n            # The smallest such multiple is: \n            #   if b[i-1] < 0, then we can set b[i] to be the smallest multiple of a[i] that is > b[i-1] (which might be negative or positive)\n            #   if b[i-1] >=0, then we set b[i] to be the smallest multiple of a[i] that is > b[i-1].\n\n        But then the moves for index i is |x_i| = |b[i]/a[i]|.\n\n    However, the known solution in C++:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        typedef long long ll;\n\n        int main() {\n            int n;\n            cin >> n;\n            vector<ll> a(n);\n            for (ll& x : a) cin >> x;\n            ll ans = 1e18;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                ll last = 0;\n                ll cur = 0;\n                for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {\n                    ll k = last/a[j] + 1;\n                    cur += k;\n                    last = k * a[j];\n                }\n                last = 0;\n                for (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n                    ll k = last/a[j] + 1;\n                    cur += k;\n                    last = k * a[j];\n                }\n                ans = min(ans, cur);\n            }\n            cout << ans << '\\n';\n        }\n\n    This is the same as our algorithm! \n\n    Let me test this on [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] for i=3:\n        left part (j=2,1,0):\n            j=2: last=0 -> k = 0+1 = 1, cur=1, last=1\n            j=1: k = last/a[1] + 1 = 1/1+1 = 2, cur=3, last=2\n            j=0: k = 2/1+1 = 3, cur=6, last=3\n        right part (j=4,5,6):\n            j=4: last=0 -> k=1, cur=7, last=1\n            j=5: k=1/1+1=2, cur=9, last=2\n            j=6: k=2/1+1=3, cur=12, last=3\n        total=12.\n\n    But the known solution outputs 12 for this array? \n\n    However, the example says 10 moves for the array that yields [-3,-2,...,3]. \n\n    I see: the example might be for a different array. The example says: \n        \"Example 2: ... in 10 moves\"\n\n    without giving the array. \n\n    In the sample test of the problem, there might be: \n        Input: \n            2\n            5\n            1 1 1 1 1\n            7\n            1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n        Output:\n            4\n            12\n\n    But the problem statement example says 10 moves for example 2. \n\n    After checking the official problem: \n        Example 1: n=5, a=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> 4 moves?

The known solution in C++ is the same as our algorithm. We trust the code structure.\n\n    Therefore, for program2.py, we complete the right part with:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n    But note: floating point might be an issue for large numbers. We can use integer arithmetic for ceil division: \n        d = (t) // k + 1   if (t+1) % k != 0, but wait, ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1 + k - 1) // k = (t+k) // k\n\n    But note: \n        ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1 + k - 1) // k = (t+k) // k   only if we are using integer floor division for nonnegative numbers.\n\n    Because: \n        ceil(m/n) = (m+n-1)//n   for positive integers m,n.\n\n    Here, m = t+1, n = k.\n    So: d = (t+1 + k - 1) // k = (t+k) // k.\n\n    But note: t and k are nonnegative.\n\n    So we can do: \n        d = (t + k) // k   [because (t+1 + k-1) = t+k]\n\n    But wait: \n        If (t+1) is divisible by k, then ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1)//k.\n        (t+k)//k = t//k + 1.\n        And (t+1)//k = t//k + 1 when (t+1) is divisible by k? only if t+1 is divisible by k, then t%k = k-1, so t//k = (t+1)//k - 1, then (t+k)//k = (t//k) + 1 = ( (t+1)//k - 1 ) + 1 = (t+1)//k.\n\n        If not, then ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1)//k + 1, and (t+k)//k = t//k + 1 = (t+1)//k (if t+1 is not divisible, then (t+1)//k = floor((t+1)/k) = floor(t/k) because t is integer) -> but not exactly.\n\n    Let me test:\n        t=0, k=3: \n            ceil(1/3)=1.\n            (0+3)//3 = 3//3=1 -> matches.\n        t=1, k=3:\n            ceil(2/3)=1.\n            (1+3)//3 = 4//3=1 -> matches.\n        t=2, k=3:\n            ceil(3/3)=1.\n            (2+3)//3 = 5//3 = 1 -> matches.\n        t=3, k=3:\n            ceil(4/3)= ceil(1.33)=2.\n            (3+3)//3=6//3=2 -> matches.\n\n    So the formula d = (t+k) // k is the same as ceil((t+1)/k) for nonnegative t and positive integer k.\n\n    Therefore, to avoid floating point, we can use integer arithmetic:\n\n        d = (t + k) // k\n\n    But the code already has: \n        import math\n\n    and uses math.ceil. Given the constraints (k up to 10^9, t up to 10^9 * something) then t might be up to 10^18, and floating point might not have enough precision.\n\n    So we should use the integer arithmetic.\n\n    Therefore, for program2.py, we can do:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            d = (t + k) // k   # because (t+1) might be very large, and this is integer arithmetic\n            # But note: (t+1) might be > (t+k) in some cases? \n            # Let me check: \n            #   We want d such that d >= (t+1)/k, and d is the smallest integer.\n            #   (t+k)//k = t//k + 1, and ceil((t+1)/k) might be t//k+1 in most cases, but is it always?\n            #   We have: \n            #       (t+k) // k = floor((t+k)/k) = floor(t/k + 1) = floor(t/k) + 1.\n            #   And ceil((t+1)/k) = floor((t+1+k-1)/k) = floor((t+k)/k) = floor(t/k)+1.\n            #   So they are the same.\n\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n    But note: the integer division in Python for nonnegative numbers is safe.\n\n    However, the given code for the left part uses math.ceil. We can change that to integer arithmetic as well for consistency, but the problem says to complete only the missing part.\n\n    Since the TODO is only for the right part, we do as above.\n\n    But the left part is already given and uses math.ceil. We might also change it to integer arithmetic to avoid floating point, but the problem does not require that.\n\n    Given the constraints, we should use integer arithmetic to avoid floating point precision issues.\n\n    Therefore, for program2.py, we use:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = (t + k) // k\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n    But note: the left part in the given code uses math.ceil. We are not allowed to change that because the problem says to complete the missing part.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\"\n\n    and the given code for the left part might be vulnerable to floating point. But the problem does not require us to change the given part.\n\n    Since the sample test cases are small, and the constraints are that a_i>=1, and the total n<=5000, the values of t might be at most around 10^9 * 5000? which is 5e12, and floating point can represent integers exactly up to 2^53, which is about 9e15, so it is safe for the given constraints (t up to 5e12) because 5e12 < 9e15.\n\n    So we can use math.ceil. But to be safe from floating point, the known solution in C++ uses integer arithmetic.\n\n    Given the option, and since the problem does not specify, we will use the integer arithmetic method for the right part to be safe.\n\n    But the problem says: do not output the entire program, only the missing part.\n\n    So for the right part, we output:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = (t + k) // k\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n    But note: the left part is using math.ceil. We are not changing that.\n\n    However, the problem does not require to change the left part.\n\n    Let me test the integer arithmetic for the right part with the example [1,1,1,1,1] for the right part when i=0 and t=0:\n        k=1: d = (0+1)//1 = 1, t=1, p=1\n        k=1: d = (1+1)//1 = 2, t=2, p=3\n        k=1: d = (2+1)//1 = 3, t=3, p=6\n        k=1: d = (3+1)//1 = 4, t=4, p=10\n\n    which is the same as using math.ceil.\n\n    Therefore, we use the integer arithmetic.\n\n    But the problem: the given code for the left part uses math.ceil. We are not changing that.\n\n    We only complete the missing part.\n\n    So for program2.py, the missing part is:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = (t + k) // k\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n    However, the problem says: the given code for program2.py has:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    and then after that, it sets t=0 and does the left part.\n\n    So we output the three lines.\n\nSummary:\n\nprogram1.py: \n    We complete the elif block with:\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nprogram2.py:\n    We complete the for loop for the right part with:\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = (t + k) // k\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\nBut note: the problem says to output in JSON format.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"d = (t + k) // k\\n        t = k * d\\n        p += d\"\n}\n\nBut note: the code in program1.py has an indentation of 8 spaces for the block inside the while loop. We use 8 spaces for the two lines.\n\nIn program2.py, the existing code uses 4 spaces for indentation. The TODO is inside a for loop that is indented by 4 spaces. So the inner block should be 8 spaces. But the given left part uses 8 spaces. So we use 8 spaces for the three lines in program2.py.\n\nBut the problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\n\nWe output the string exactly as it should appear.\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the existing code for the if block (lsum < rsum) is:\n\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nWe do the same for the elif block.\n\nIn program2.py, the existing code for the left part is:\n\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\nWe do similarly for the right part, but with integer arithmetic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
