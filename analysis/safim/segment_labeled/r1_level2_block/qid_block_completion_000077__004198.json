  },
  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\nThe initial idea: note that the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1].\nTherefore, the awesomeness for [l, r] = 1 + (# of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i] != a[i+1]).\nThen the total sum over all contiguous subarrays is:\n  Sum_{l=1 to n} Sum_{r=l to n} [1 + (# of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i]!=a[i+1])]\n= (number of contiguous subarrays) + Sum_{i=1 to n-1} [ (number of subarrays that include the segment [i, i+1] and for which the condition a[i]!=a[i+1] matters) ]\n\nBut note: the condition a[i]!=a[i+1] only matters when the subarray includes both a[i] and a[i+1]. The number of subarrays that include the segment [i, i+1] is i * (n - i) [because the left end can be any from 1 to i, and the right end can be any from i+1 to n].\n\nTherefore, the total sum = (n*(n+1)//2) + Sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * (i * (n-i)) ]\n\nHowever, note the example: \n  n=5, a = [1,2,2,4,5] (after the first query in the example)\n  Then the total number of subarrays = 15.\n  Then we add for each adjacent pair:\n    i=1: 1!=2 -> True -> add 1*(5-1) = 1*4 = 4\n    i=2: 2==2 -> 0\n    i=3: 2!=4 -> True -> add 3*(5-3)=3*2=6\n    i=4: 4!=5 -> True -> add 4*(5-4)=4*1=4\n  Total = 15 + 4+0+6+4 = 29 -> matches.\n\nBut note: the provided initial code in program1.py does:\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i\n\nLet's check: \n  For i=1: (a[1]!=a[2]) -> 1!=2 -> True -> 1 * (n-2+1) * 1 = 1 * (5-2+1)=4 -> 4\n  For i=2: (a[2]!=a[3]) -> 2==2 -> 0\n  For i=3: (a[3]!=a[4]) -> 2!=4 -> 1 * (5-4+1)*3 = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6\n  For i=4: (a[4]!=a[5]) -> 4!=5 -> 1 * (5-5+1)*4 = 1*1*4=4\n  For i=5: (a[5]!=a[6]) -> 5!=0? -> but note: we have a[0]=0 and a[6]=0? Actually the code inserted 0 at the beginning and appended 0.\n\nBut the above loop runs for i from 1 to n (which is 5). Then we have:\n  i=5: a[5]=5, a[6]=0 -> 5!=0 -> True -> 1 * (n-6+1)*5 -> but n=5, so (5-6+1)=0 -> 0.\n\nSo the initial ans = 4+0+6+4+0 = 14? But then we need 15 (from the base) plus 14? -> 29? \nBut wait: the base (the 15) is not added in the initial code? \n\nActually, the total sum of awesomeness is:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2   [because each subarray has at least 1 block] \n  plus the contributions from adjacent pairs.\n\nBut the initial code does not have the base? \n\nLet me reexamine: \n  The awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] = 1 + (# of indices i in [l, r-1] such that a[i]!=a[i+1]).\n  Then the total = (# of subarrays) + (# of adjacent pairs (i, i+1) that are different and that are included in the subarray).\n\nBut note: the base is the number of subarrays = n*(n+1)//2.\n\nIn the initial code, we are only adding the adjacent pairs? Then we are missing the base.\n\nBut wait: the example calculation: \n  The base is 15, and the adjacent pairs add 4+6+4=14 -> total 29.\n\nSo the initial code only adds the adjacent pairs? Then we must add the base separately.\n\nHowever, the initial code does not add the base. It only has:\n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i \n\nThis computes the adjacent pairs: for an adjacent pair at (i, i+1), the number of subarrays that include this pair is i * (n - i) [because the left end can be from 1 to i (i choices) and the right end from i+1 to n (n-i choices)]? \n\nBut note: the expression: (n - (i+1) + 1) = n - i. Then multiplied by i -> i*(n-i). \n\nSo the initial ans is the sum of the adjacent pairs contributions. Then we must add the base? \n\nBut the example: after the first query, the answer is 29. The base is 15 and the adjacent pairs add 14 -> 29.\n\nTherefore, we must have:\n  total_ans = base + (adjacent pairs contributions) = n*(n+1)//2 + (the sum we computed)\n\nBut the initial code does not add the base? \n\nLooking at the initial code: \n  n, m = ... \n  a = ... \n  a.insert(0,0); a.append(0)\n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      ans += ... \n\nThen we are going to process m queries. \n\nSo we must start by having:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  plus the adjacent pairs: for i from 1 to n-1: (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * i * (n-i) \n  but note: the loop in the code runs for i from 1 to n (including n) and uses a[i] and a[i+1]. For i=n, we have a[n] and a[n+1] (which is 0) -> so we get an extra term at the end? \n\nActually, we have two extra adjacent pairs: (0, a1) and (an, 0). \nBut the problem only considers the array from index 1 to n. The adjacent pairs we care about are (a1, a2), (a2, a3), ... (a_{n-1}, a_n). \n\nSo the loop should run for i from 1 to n-1? But the code runs for i from 1 to n. \n\nIn the example, the last term (i=5) was 0 because (5,0) is different but (n-i) = 0. So it doesn't matter? \n\nBut what about the first adjacent pair (a0, a1) = (0, a1)? \n  i=0: not in the loop? The loop starts at 1.\n\nSo the loop from 1 to n: \n  i=1: (a1, a2) -> which is the first adjacent pair of the original array? \n  i=2: (a2, a3)\n  ...\n  i=n: (a_n, a_{n+1}) -> which is (a_n, 0)\n\nBut the problem does not consider the boundaries with 0. The subarrays are only from the original array. \n\nHowever, note: the adjacent pair (a0, a1) is not included in any subarray? because the subarray starts at index>=1. Similarly, the adjacent pair (a_n, a_{n+1}) is not included? \n\nBut the adjacent pair (a1, a2) is included only in subarrays that start at 1 and end at at least 2. \n\nSo the term for i=1: (a1 != a2) * 1 * (n-1) -> which is the same as the formula.\n\nBut the term for i=0: (a0, a1) is not included in any subarray? because the subarray starting at 1 does not include a0. So we don't want to count it.\n\nSimilarly, the term for i=n: (a_n, a_{n+1}) is not included? because the subarray ending at n does not include a_{n+1}. \n\nTherefore, the loop from 1 to n is actually including two boundaries that are not in the original array? \n\nBut note: the adjacent pair (a0, a1) is at index0 and index1. The subarray [1,1] does not include the adjacent pair (a0, a1) because it only has a1. Similarly, the adjacent pair (a1, a2) is at index1 and index2: the subarray [1,2] includes it, but the subarray [1,1] does not.\n\nSo the loop from 1 to n: \n  i=1: adjacent pair (a1, a2) -> which is the first one we care about? \n  i=2: (a2, a3)\n  ...\n  i=n-1: (a_{n-1}, a_n)\n  i=n: (a_n, a_{n+1}) -> which we don't care about? \n\nBut the condition at i=n: (a_n != a_{n+1]) -> (a_n != 0) -> which is true for positive a_n? Then we get a term: (n - (n+1) + 1) * n = (n - n) * n = 0. \n\nSo it doesn't add anything. \n\nSimilarly, the adjacent pair (a0, a1) is at i=0? but we don't run i=0. \n\nTherefore, the initial loop only adds the adjacent pairs from i=1 to i=n-1? because for i=n, the term is 0. \n\nSo the initial ans is the sum of the adjacent pairs for the original array? \n\nBut wait: the adjacent pair (a0, a1) is at index0 and index1. The code does not consider i=0. \n\nSo the initial ans is the total adjacent pairs contribution for the original array? \n\nTherefore, the total answer for the array is: base (which is the number of subarrays) + the adjacent pairs contributions? \n\nBut the initial code does not add the base? \n\nIn the example: \n  base = 15\n  adjacent pairs: 4+0+6+4 = 14 -> total 29.\n\nBut the initial code sets ans=0 and then adds 4+0+6+4+0=14. \n\nSo we must add the base? \n\nBut the problem: after each query we update an element and then output the total. \n\nSo we must start by computing the base and the adjacent pairs. \n\nTherefore, we should do:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  adj = 0\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          adj += i * (n-i)\n  total_ans = base + adj\n\nBut the initial code does not do that. It only has a loop from 1 to n (including n) and then sets ans to the adjacent pairs. \n\nSo we must adjust: we can consider that the base is constant? because the number of subarrays is always n*(n+1)//2. \n\nTherefore, we can do:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  # Then we maintain the adjacent pairs contributions.\n\nBut note: the adjacent pairs contributions change when we update an element. \n\nWe have to update the adjacent pairs that involve the updated element. \n\nSpecifically, when we update the element at position i (1-indexed), we affect:\n  the adjacent pair (i-1, i) and (i, i+1)\n\nSo we have to subtract the old contributions of these two adjacent pairs and then add the new contributions.\n\nBut note: the adjacent pairs are at indices: \n  left: between i-1 and i (if i>1)\n  right: between i and i+1 (if i<n)\n\nIn the code, we have stored the array a (with 1-indexed positions: a[1] to a[n], and a[0]=0, a[n+1]=0).\n\nWe maintain a global variable 'ans' that is the total adjacent pairs contributions (which we then add to base to get the total answer).\n\nBut note: the base is constant. So we can precompute base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\nThen, we maintain:\n  total_ans = base + (adjacent pairs contributions)\n\nBut the adjacent pairs contributions are stored in a variable, say 'adj'.\n\nWe also have the array a.\n\nIn the initial setup, we compute adj by iterating from i=1 to n (but note: the adjacent pairs are at i=1 to n-1, and the last one at i=n is not included because it gives 0). So we can compute adj by iterating from 1 to n-1? \n\nBut the initial code does a loop from 1 to n. Since the last term is 0, we can do the same: we can compute adj for i from 1 to n, and then we have the correct value (because the last term is 0). \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  adj = 0\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      adj += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\nBut note: for i=n, the term is (a[n]!=a[n+1]) * n * (n-n) = ... * n * 0 = 0.\n\nSo it's the same as if we did for i=1 to n-1.\n\nNow, when updating:\n\n  We are given a query: (i, x) -> update the element at position i (1-indexed) to x.\n\n  We are going to change a[i] to x. This will affect:\n      the adjacent pair (i-1, i) -> which is at index i-1? Actually, the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is stored at index i-1? \n      But in our representation, the adjacent pair between a[i-1] and a[i] is at index i-1? \n\n  However, in our loop we considered the adjacent pair at position i (which is between a[i] and a[i+1]) and the adjacent pair at position i-1 (which is between a[i-1] and a[i]). \n\n  Specifically, the adjacent pair (a[i-1], a[i]) is at index i-1? \n  But in our formula, the adjacent pair (a[i-1], a[i]) is stored at index i-1? because the formula for the adjacent pair at index j (for j from 1 to n) is between a[j] and a[j+1]. \n\n  Therefore, the adjacent pair (a[i-1], a[i]) is at index i-1? \n      Actually, no: \n          adjacent pair at index j: (a[j], a[j+1])\n          So the adjacent pair (a[i-1], a[i]) is at index i-1? \n          And the adjacent pair (a[i], a[i+1]) is at index i.\n\n  So we have two adjacent pairs: at positions i-1 and i.\n\n  Steps for update at position i (1-indexed):\n\n      Let the current value at i be old = a[i] (we have stored it).\n\n      We are going to set a[i] = x.\n\n      Then we update the adjacent pairs:\n\n          For the adjacent pair at index i-1 (if i>=2): \n              Old state: (a[i-1], old) -> we had a contribution: (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1)) \n              New state: (a[i-1], x) -> new contribution: (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n\n          For the adjacent pair at index i (if i<=n-1):\n              Old state: (old, a[i+1]) -> contribution: (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n              New state: (x, a[i+1]) -> contribution: (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\n      So we subtract the old contributions and add the new ones.\n\n      Also, note: if i==1, then there is no adjacent pair at index0? because we have a[0]=0 and a[1]=old, but we don't consider the adjacent pair at index0? because our loop runs from 1 to n. The adjacent pair at index0 is (a0, a1) -> which we don't care about? because it's not included in any subarray? \n\n      Similarly, if i==n, then the adjacent pair at index n is (a[n], a[n+1]) -> which we don't care about? because it's not included? But note: the adjacent pair at index n-1 (if n>=2) is (a[n-1], a[n]) -> which we do care about? \n\n      However, in our representation, the adjacent pair at index i-1 is only defined for i>=2? and the adjacent pair at index i is only defined for i<=n-1? \n\n      But note: the adjacent pair at index n is (a[n], a[n+1]) -> which we don't care about? and in our formula, the term for index n is 0? because (n - n) = 0. \n\n      So we can safely update:\n\n          if i>=2:\n              subtract: (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n              add: (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n\n          if i<=n-1:\n              subtract: (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n              add: (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\n      Then update a[i] = x.\n\n      Then the total answer for the query is base + adj (after updating adj).\n\n  But note: we must also update the adjacent pair at index i-1 and i? and we have stored the entire array. \n\n  However, we must note: the adjacent pair at index i-1 is stored in our adj variable? and we are going to update it.\n\n  We maintain adj as the current total adjacent pairs contributions.\n\n  So the plan:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2   [constant]\n\n      We precomputed adj initially.\n\n      Then for each query:\n\n          i, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n          # We are updating position i (1-indexed)\n\n          old = a[i]\n\n          # Update the adjacent pairs that involve i: at positions i-1 and i.\n\n          # For the adjacent pair at index i-1 (if exists): \n          if i >= 2:\n              # The adjacent pair at index i-1: (a[i-1], a[i]) -> which was (a[i-1], old)\n              # We subtract the old contribution for index i-1.\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n              # Now we set a[i] to x, so we add the new contribution for index i-1: (a[i-1] != x)\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n\n          # For the adjacent pair at index i (if exists): \n          if i <= n-1:\n              # The adjacent pair at index i: (a[i], a[i+1]) -> which was (old, a[i+1])\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n\n          # Also, we must update the adjacent pair at index i-1? we did above? \n          # And we update the array: set a[i] = x.\n\n          a[i] = x\n\n          # Then the total answer for the query is base + adj.\n\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: what if the update affects the adjacent pair at index i-2? or i+1? \n      Only the adjacent pairs that involve the updated element: that is the one to the left (i-1 and i) and to the right (i and i+1). \n\n  However, the adjacent pair at index i-2 is (a[i-2], a[i-1]) -> not affected.\n\n  So we are good.\n\n  But note: the array a has been extended: a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. \n\n  Also, when updating a[1] (i=1): \n      we only update the adjacent pair at index 1? (if n>=2) -> because i=1: \n          i>=2 -> false, so skip the left.\n          i<=n-1 -> if n>=2 then true, so update the adjacent pair at index1: (a[1], a[2])\n\n  Similarly, when updating a[n] (i=n):\n      update the adjacent pair at index n-1? (if n>=2) -> because i>=2: true, so update the adjacent pair at index n-1: (a[n-1], a[n])\n      and the adjacent pair at index n: (a[n], a[n+1]) -> but we don't care? because the term for index n is 0? and also we don't update it? because i<=n-1: n<=n-1 -> false.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  However, note: the adjacent pair at index n is (a[n], a[n+1]) -> which we never update? and we don't care? because it's not included in any subarray? \n\n  But what if we update a[n]? then the adjacent pair at index n-1 (if exists) is updated? and the adjacent pair at index n? \n      We update the adjacent pair at index n-1? (if n>=2) -> because i=n>=2 -> true, so we update the left adjacent pair (at index n-1) and the right adjacent pair (at index n) is not updated? because i<=n-1 -> false.\n\n  But the adjacent pair at index n is (a[n], a[n+1]) -> which we don't care about? because it's not included in any subarray? \n\n  However, what if we update a[1] and then update a[2]? \n      When updating a[1]: we update the adjacent pair at index1 (if n>=2) -> which is (a[1], a[2]).\n      Then when updating a[2]: we update the adjacent pairs at index1 (which is (a[1], a[2])) and at index2 (if n>=3) -> which is (a[2], a[3]).\n\n  So the adjacent pair at index1 is updated twice? but that's because it is affected by both updates.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py:\n\n      We precompute base = n*(n+1)//2\n      We precompute adj by iterating from i=1 to n (which includes the adjacent pairs from 1 to n, but the last one is 0 so it doesn't matter).\n\n      Then for each query:\n          read i, x\n          old = a[i]\n          if i>=2:\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n          if i<=n-1:\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n          a[i] = x\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: the problem says the array is 1-indexed? and we have a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. \n\n  However, the input: the array is given as a1, a2, ... an. We inserted 0 at the beginning and appended 0. So a[1] is the first element, a[2] the second, ... a[n] the last.\n\n  The query: i is given (1-indexed) so we update a[i].\n\n  Example: first query: \n      Input: n=5, m=?\n      Array: [1,2,3,4,5] -> but wait, the example says after the first query the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5]. \n      Actually, the initial array is given? and then the first query.\n\n  The example input: \n      \"5 5\"\n      \"1 2 3 4 5\"\n      then the first query: \"3 2\"\n\n      So we update index 3 to 2.\n\n      Then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] -> and we output 29.\n\n  Let's simulate:\n\n      Precomputation:\n\n        base = 5*6//2 = 15.\n\n        a = [0, 1,2,3,4,5,0]   (after inserting 0 at the beginning and appending 0)\n\n        adj = 0\n        for i in range(1,6): \n          i=1: (a1=1, a2=2) -> 1!=2 -> True -> add 1*(5-1)=1*4=4 -> adj=4\n          i=2: (2,3) -> True -> 2*(5-2)=2*3=6 -> adj=10\n          i=3: (3,4) -> True -> 3*(5-3)=3*2=6 -> adj=16\n          i=4: (4,5) -> True -> 4*(5-4)=4*1=4 -> adj=20\n          i=5: (5,0) -> True -> 5*(5-5)=5*0=0 -> adj=20.\n\n        So initial total_ans = base + adj = 15+20 = 35? but the example after the first query is 29.\n\n        What's the initial array? the problem says the first query updates the array to [1,2,2,4,5]. So the initial array is [1,2,3,4,5]? and then we update index3 to 2.\n\n        So we are going to update index3 (1-indexed) to 2.\n\n        Steps for update:\n\n          i=3, x=2.\n\n          old = a[3] = 3.\n\n          i>=2: true -> update adjacent pair at index2: (a[2], a[3]) -> which is (2,3) -> becomes (2,2) [after update].\n\n          For index2 (i-1=2? but note: the adjacent pair at index i-1 is index2? because i=3 -> adjacent pair at index2: (a[2], a[3]) -> which is (2,3) -> becomes (2,2).\n\n          Subtract: (a[2]!=a[3]) -> (2!=3) -> True -> 2*(5-2)=2*3=6 -> so adj becomes 20-6=14.\n          Add: (2!=2) -> False -> 0 -> adj=14.\n\n          Then update adjacent pair at index i=3: (a[3], a[4]) -> which was (3,4) -> becomes (2,4).\n\n          Subtract: (3!=4) -> True -> 3*(5-3)=3*2=6 -> adj=14-6=8.\n          Add: (2!=4) -> True -> 3*2=6 -> adj=8+6=14.\n\n          Then set a[3]=2.\n\n          Then total_ans = base + adj = 15+14=29 -> matches.\n\n        Then we output 29.\n\n        Then the next query? we don't know, but we output 29 for the first query.\n\n  Therefore, we must precompute the base and adj initially.\n\n  But note: the initial code does not precompute base? it only has:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.insert(0,0)\n      a.append(0)\n      ans = 0 \n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i \n\n  Here, 'ans' is the adjacent pairs contributions? and we are missing the base.\n\n  So we must add base = n*(n+1)//2 to the initial ans? \n\n  Then we set adj = ans.\n\n  Then we do the queries.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans   # because the initial loop computed the adjacent pairs contributions\n\n      Then for each query:\n\n          data = input().split()\n          if not data: \n              break\n          i = int(data[0])\n          x = int(data[1])\n\n          # We update the element at position i (1-indexed)\n\n          old = a[i]\n\n          # Update adjacent pairs: left (if exists) and right (if exists)\n\n          # For the adjacent pair at index i-1 (if i>=2)\n          if i >= 2:\n              # subtract the old contribution for the adjacent pair at index i-1: (a[i-1], old)\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n              # add the new contribution for (a[i-1], x)\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n\n          # For the adjacent pair at index i (if i<=n-1)\n          if i <= n-1:\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n\n          # Update the array\n          a[i] = x\n\n          # The total answer for the query is base + adj\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: the problem says m queries, and we are in a while(m) loop? \n\n  The initial code has:\n\n      while(m):\n          # TODO\n\n  We can do:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans   # because the initial loop computed the adjacent pairs\n\n      for _ in range(m):\n          # read the query and update\n\n  However, the initial code has:\n\n      n, m = ... \n      a = ... \n      a.insert(0,0); a.append(0)\n      ans = 0 \n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          ans += ... \n\n      while(m):\n          # TODO\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans   # the initial adjacent pairs contributions\n\n      while m:\n          m -= 1\n          # read the query\n          data = input().split()\n          i = int(data[0]); x = int(data[1])\n          # ... update as above\n\n  But note: the variable 'ans' was used for the adjacent pairs? and then we reassign adj = ans? and then we use adj for the adjacent pairs? and then we output base+adj.\n\n  Alternatively, we can reuse the variable 'ans'? but the initial code already computed the adjacent pairs in 'ans'. \n\n  So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans   # the initial adjacent pairs contributions\n\n      while m:\n          m -= 1\n          i, x = map(int, input().split())\n          old = a[i]\n          if i >= 2:\n              # subtract the old left adjacent pair (i-1, i) with old value\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)   # but wait: (n - (i-1)) = n - i + 1? \n              # Actually: (n - (i-1)) = n - i + 1 -> yes.\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n          if i <= n-1:\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n          a[i] = x\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: the expression for the left adjacent pair: (i-1) * (n - (i-1)) = (i-1)*(n-i+1) -> which is the same as (i-1)*(n - i + 1).\n\n  However, the initial loop used: (n - (i+1) + 1) * i = (n - i) * i.\n\n  For the left adjacent pair: we use (i-1) * (n - (i-1)) = (i-1)*(n-i+1) -> which is the same as the initial formula for the adjacent pair at index j: j*(n-j) but with j = i-1.\n\n  So it's consistent.\n\n  But note: the adjacent pair at index i-1: the index j = i-1, so the formula is j*(n-j) = (i-1)*(n - (i-1)) = (i-1)*(n-i+1).\n\n  Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the expression (n - i + 1) is the same as (n - (i-1))? yes.\n\n  So the missing code for program1.py is the while loop body.\n\n  But note: the initial code has:\n\n      while(m):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we replace the TODO with:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans   # because the initial loop computed the adjacent pairs\n\n      while m:\n          m -= 1\n          data = input().split()\n          if not data: \n              break\n          i = int(data[0])\n          x = int(data[1])\n          old = a[i]\n          # update left adjacent pair (if exists)\n          if i >= 2:\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n          # update right adjacent pair (if exists)\n          if i <= n-1:\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n          a[i] = x\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: the initial code does not have base and adj defined? so we must define them before the while loop.\n\n  Therefore, the entire program1.py after the initial loop should be:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans   # the initial adjacent pairs\n\n      while m:\n          m -= 1\n          i, x = map(int, input().split())\n          old = a[i]\n          if i >= 2:\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n          if i <= n-1:\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n          a[i] = x\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: the initial code has a while(m) loop? and we are using m as the loop counter? we can do m times.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      for _ in range(m):\n          ...\n\n  But the initial code has while(m): and then we do m-=1.\n\n  So we do as above.\n\n  However, the initial code has:\n\n      while(m):\n          # TODO\n\n  We replace the TODO with the above code? but note: the TODO is inside the while(m) loop? \n\n  Actually, the initial code has:\n\n      while(m):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must not run the while loop without the body? we must fill the body.\n\n  But the above code does the entire processing for m queries? so we put the entire block inside the while loop? \n\n  However, we must define base and adj only once? not in every iteration.\n\n  Therefore, we must define base and adj before the while loop.\n\n  So the code after the initial loop should be:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans   # the initial adjacent pairs\n\n      while m:\n          m -= 1\n          i, x = map(int, input().split())\n          old = a[i]\n          if i >= 2:\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n          if i <= n-1:\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n          a[i] = x\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: the initial variable 'ans' was used for the adjacent pairs? and then we set adj = ans? and then we update adj? and then we output base+adj.\n\n  This should be correct.\n\n  Let me test with the example: \n      Initial: base=15, adj=20? then we update and get adj=14 -> output 29.\n\n  So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      adj = ans\n      while m:\n          m -= 1\n          i, x = map(int, input().split())\n          old = a[i]\n          if i >= 2:\n              adj -= (a[i-1] != old) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n              adj += (a[i-1] != x) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n          if i <= n-1:\n              adj -= (old != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n              adj += (x != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n          a[i] = x\n          print(base + adj)\n\n  But note: the expression (n - i + 1) is the same as (n - (i-1))? yes.\n\n  However, the initial loop for adj used: (n - (i+1) + 1) * i = (n - i) * i for the adjacent pair at index i? \n      For the adjacent pair at index i (which is between a[i] and a[i+1]), the formula is i*(n-i) -> which we use in the update for the right adjacent pair.\n\n  For the left adjacent pair (at index i-1) we use (i-1)*(n - (i-1)) = (i-1)*(n-i+1).\n\n  So it's consistent.\n\n  Now, for program2.py:\n\n  Description: \n      We have an array a of length n (with possibly negative numbers) and three operations:\n        1. Choose a position i and decrease the prefix [1,2,...,i] by 1.\n        2. Choose a position i and decrease the suffix [i, i+1, ..., n] by 1.\n        3. Increase the entire array by 1.\n\n      We want to make the entire array zeros with minimum number of operations.\n\n  Note: \n      Operation 1: decreases a prefix by 1 (so subtracts 1 from the first i elements).\n      Operation 2: decreases a suffix by 1 (so subtracts 1 from the last n-i+1 elements).\n      Operation 3: increases the entire array by 1.\n\n  We can think of operation 3 as adding 1 to every element. \n\n  How to solve?\n\n  Let me denote:\n      Let d1[i] = number of times we apply operation 1 ending at i (so we apply the operation on prefix [1..i]).\n      Let d2[i] = number of times we apply operation 2 starting at i (so we apply the operation on suffix [i..n]).\n      Let d3 = number of times we apply operation 3.\n\n  Then the net effect on element j is:\n      a_j - (d1[j] + d1[j+1] + ... + d1[n]) - (d2[1] + d2[2] + ... + d2[j]) + d3 = 0\n\n  But note: \n      Operation 1: if we apply d1[i] times on prefix ending at i, then element j is decreased by d1[i] for every i>=j.\n      Operation 2: if we apply d2[i] times on suffix starting at i, then element j is decreased by d2[i] for every i<=j.\n      Operation 3: we add d3 to every element.\n\n  So: \n      a_j - (d1_j + d1_{j+1} + ... + d1_n) - (d2_1 + d2_2 + ... + d2_j) + d3 = 0\n\n  Rearranged:\n      a_j + d3 = (d1_j + ... + d1_n) + (d2_1 + ... + d2_j)\n\n  We want to minimize: \n      total_ops = (d1_1+...+d1_n) + (d2_1+...+d2_n) + d3\n\n  How to model? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a known solution for this problem: \n      This problem is known as \"Minimum Operations to Make Array Zero\" with the given operations.\n\n  Known solution: \n      We can consider the differences. Let d[0] = a[0], and for i from 1 to n-1: d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1].\n\n      Then the operations:\n        Operation 1: at position i: \n            It subtracts 1 from the prefix [0..i-1] (if we use 0-indexed) -> so it adds -1 to d[0] and then for j from 1 to i-1: d[j] remains the same? \n            Actually, if we subtract 1 from the prefix [0..i-1], then:\n                d[0] becomes d[0]-1, and d[i] becomes d[i]+1? \n        Operation 2: at position i: \n            Subtract 1 from the suffix [i..n-1]: \n                Then d[i] becomes d[i]-1, and d[n] (if exists) becomes d[n]+1? but we don't have d[n] (because d has length n-1) -> actually, we can define d for indices 0 to n-1: d[0]=a[0], d[i]=a[i]-a[i-1] for i=1..n-1, and then we have an extra term for the last element? \n\n      Actually, we can define an array d of length n: \n          d0 = a0\n          d1 = a1 - a0\n          ...\n          d_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}\n          and then we need to account for the last element? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use a well known solution: \n\n      We can reframe the problem: \n        Operation 1: subtract 1 from a prefix -> this is like adding a decreasing function that is 1 from 0 to i-1 and 0 beyond? \n        Operation 2: subtract 1 from a suffix -> this is like adding a decreasing function that is 0 from 0 to i-1 and 1 from i to n-1? \n        Operation 3: add 1 to the entire array -> this is like adding a constant 1.\n\n      We can think of the entire array as a function f(i) = a_i.\n\n      We want to represent f as a linear combination of:\n          Basis functions: \n            For operation1: for each i (from 0 to n-1) we have a function g_i(j) = 1 for j<=i, 0 otherwise? but then we subtract? so negative.\n            For operation2: for each i (from 0 to n-1) we have a function h_i(j) = 1 for j>=i, 0 otherwise? \n            For operation3: a constant function 1.\n\n      But note: we can also use positive and negative? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use a greedy method:\n\n      We note that operation 3 is the only one that can increase the array. So we can think of d3 as a variable that we can set to a nonnegative integer? but note: if the array has negative numbers, we might need to use operation3 to increase them? \n\n      Actually, we can consider the absolute value? \n\n      Known solution from similar problems (like CodeForces problems) is:\n\n          Let b_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i from 1 to n-1, and let b0 = a0, and we don't have a_n? \n\n      But note: the problem has a known solution: \n\n          total_ops = |a0| + |a1 - a0| + ... + |a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}| + |a_{n-1}| \n          ??? \n\n      But the example: \n          First test case: \n              n=1, a=[-2] -> \n                  |a0| = 2 -> but the answer? \n                  We can do: \n                      Operation3: 2 times -> then becomes [0] -> so 2 operations? \n                  So total_ops = 2.\n\n          The formula: |a0| = 2 -> then |a0|? but the formula above for n=1: |a0| + |a0|? -> 2+? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          Let d0 = a0, d1 = a1 - a0, d2 = a2 - a1, ... , d_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}, and then we also have the last element? \n\n      Actually, we can define an array d of length n: \n          d[0] = a[0]\n          for i in range(1, n): d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n      Then the operations:\n\n          Operation1 at position i (0-indexed, meaning prefix [0..i]): \n              This will: \n                  decrease a[0] by 1 -> so d[0] -= 1\n                  and for j from 1 to i: a[j] is decreased by 1, but a[j-1] is also decreased by 1 -> so d[j] = a[j]-a[j-1] remains the same.\n                  but at j=i+1: a[i] is decreased by 1, but a[i+1] is not -> so d[i+1] += 1? \n\n          Similarly, operation2 at position i (0-indexed, meaning suffix [i..n-1]):\n              This will:\n                  for j from i to n-1: a[j] is decreased by 1 -> \n                  at j=i: d[i] = a[i]-a[i-1] -> if i>0 then a[i] is decreased by 1, but a[i-1] is not -> so d[i] -= 1.\n                  for j from i+1 to n-1: both a[j] and a[j-1] are decreased by 1 -> so d[j] remains the same.\n                  and the last element: no effect beyond? \n                  but at the beginning: if i=0, then d[0] -= 1.\n\n          Operation3: \n              increases every element by 1 -> \n                  d[0] += 1\n                  and for j from 1 to n-1: d[j] remains the same? because both a[j] and a[j-1] are increased by 1.\n\n      So we see that the operations affect the differences in a specific way.\n\n      We want to make all a[i] = 0 -> then d[0]=0, and for i>=1: d[i]=0.\n\n      How to minimize the total operations? \n\n      We can use operation3 to adjust the entire array? \n\n      Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n          Let x = d3 (the number of operation3).\n\n          Then the equation for the first element:\n              a0 + x = (d1_0 + ... + d1_{n-1}) + (d2_0)   [because for j=0: the operation2 part is only d2_0?]\n\n          For the second element:\n              a1 + x = (d1_1+...+d1_{n-1}) + (d2_0+d2_1)\n\n          We see that the system is coupled.\n\n      Known solution from the note: \n          In the note: \n              First test case: n=1, a=[-2] -> output 2.\n              Second test case: n=3, a=[4,-2,5] -> output 13? but the example says 13.\n\n          The example provided a solution: \n              It's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times -> for [0]? but the array was [-2] -> becomes [0] with 2 operations? \n\n          The example also says: \n              In the second test case: \n                  [4, -2, 5] -> \n                  Apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 -> becomes [0, -6, 1] -> then 6 times on the prefix of length 1 -> [ -6, -6, 1] -> then 3 times on the suffix of length 1? -> that doesn't seem to match.\n\n          Actually, the example solution: \n                  Apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3: \n                      [4-4, -2-4, 5-4] = [0, -6, 1]\n                  Then apply the operation of decreasing 6 times on the prefix of length 1: \n                      [0-6, -6, 1] = [-6, -6, 1] -> then 3 times on the suffix of length 1: \n                      [-6, -6, 1-3] = [-6, -6, -2] -> not zero.\n\n          Correction: \n                  The operations are:\n                    Operation1: decrease a prefix by 1: so if we do 4 times on prefix of length 3: \n                        4 becomes 4-4=0, -2 becomes -2-4=-6, 5 becomes 5-4=1.\n                    Then operation1: 6 times on prefix of length 1: \n                        0 becomes 0-6 = -6, the rest unchanged? -> [-6, -6, 1]\n                    Then operation2: 3 times on suffix of length 1: \n                        This means: the suffix starting at index3 (the last element) is decreased by 3: \n                        so the last element becomes 1-3 = -2, the others unchanged?

but expected 13.\n\n      Another known solution from a similar problem (CodeForces 1661C - Water the Trees) is different.\n\n      Insight: \n          We can consider the following: \n            Let x = number of operation3 (which add 1 to every element).\n            Then we need to cancel out the array a by using operation1 and operation2, but note that operation1 and operation2 can only decrease.\n\n          So we require: \n            a_i + x = (number of operation1 that cover i) + (number of operation2 that cover i)\n\n          And we want to minimize: x + (total operation1) + (total operation2)\n\n          Let u_i = number of operation1 that cover i (which is the number of operation1 applied to a prefix that includes i) = sum_{j>=i} d1_j.\n          Let v_i = number of operation2 that cover i = sum_{j<=i} d2_j.\n\n          Then: a_i + x = u_i + v_i.\n\n          Also, note that the total operation1 = sum_i d1_i = u_0 (if we consider 0-indexed) -> but actually u_0 = d1_0 + d1_1 + ... + d1_{n-1} = total operation1.\n          Similarly, total operation2 = sum_i d2_i = v_{n-1}.\n\n          And the total operations = u_0 + v_{n-1} + x.\n\n          We have for each i: u_i + v_i = a_i + x.\n\n          We can express:\n              u_i = u_{i+1} + d1_i   for i from 0 to n-2, and u_{n-1} = d1_{n-1}.\n              v_i = v_{i-1} + d2_i   for i from 1 to n-1, and v_0 = d2_0.\n\n          We want to minimize: u_0 + v_{n-1} + x.\n\n          And we have for each i: u_i + v_i = a_i + x.\n\n          How to minimize? \n\n          We can try to express everything in terms of u_0 and v_0? \n\n          But note: \n              u_0 = u_1 + d1_0 = u_2 + d1_0 + d1_1 = ... = d1_0+...+d1_{n-1}\n              v_{n-1} = v_{n-2} + d2_{n-1} = ... = d2_0+...+d2_{n-1}\n\n          And we have:\n              For i=0: u_0 + v_0 = a_0 + x.\n              For i=1: u_1 + v_1 = a_1 + x.\n              But u_1 = u_0 - d1_0, and v_1 = v_0 + d2_1.\n\n          This becomes complex.\n\n      Known solution from a CodeForces editorial for a similar problem (CodeForces 1661C) is not exactly the same.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a greedy solution from known submissions for the problem \"Three Operations\" (which is this problem) on CodeForces: \n\n          We can do: \n              Let b = [0] * n\n              Let ans = 0\n              for i in range(n-1):\n                  ans += abs(a[i] - b[i])\n                  b[i+1] += (a[i] - b[i])\n                  b[i] = a[i]\n              ans += abs(a[-1]-b[-1])\n\n          But the example: \n              n=1: a=[-2] -> \n                  for i in range(0,0): no loop.\n                  then ans += abs(a[0]-b[0]) = abs(-2-0)=2 -> output 2.\n\n              n=3, a=[4,-2,5]:\n                  i=0: \n                      ans += abs(4-0)=4\n                      b[1] += (4-0)=4 -> b[1]=4\n                      b[0]=4\n                  i=1:\n                      ans += abs(-2 - 4) = 6 -> total=10\n                      b[2] += ( -2 - 4 ) = -6 -> b[2]= -6\n                      b[1]= -2\n                  then ans += abs(5 - (-6)) = 11 -> total=21.\n\n          But expected is 13.\n\n      Another known solution from a submission for the problem \"Three Operations\" (CodeForces problem) is:\n\n          for _ in range(int(input())):\n              n = int(input())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              ans = 0\n              for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                  ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])\n              print(ans + abs(a[0]) + abs(a[-1]) - something) \n\n      But the example: \n          n=1: \n              for i in range(0,0,-1): nothing.\n              then ans = 0, then add abs(a[0])+abs(a[0])?

\n\n      This is not matching.\n\n  Let me think of a different approach:\n\n      We can consider the effect of operations on the array as a whole. \n\n      Note that operation1 and operation2 are subtraction on a prefix/suffix, and operation3 is addition on the whole array.\n\n      We can simulate the process from left to right:\n\n          We want to make the first element 0. How? \n              If the first element is positive, we can use operation1 (on prefix that includes only the first element) to reduce it to 0. \n              If it is negative, we can use operation3 (which increases the whole array) until it becomes 0? but then the whole array becomes increased.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a known solution from the note: \n\n          In the first test case: \n              It's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\n\n          In the second test case: \n              The answer is 13.\n\n          The provided example solution: \n                  Apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 -> then the array becomes [0, -6, 1] \n                  Then apply the operation of decreasing 6 times on the prefix of length 1 -> then the array becomes [-6, -6, 1]\n                  Then apply the operation of decreasing 3 times on the suffix of length 1 -> then the array becomes [-6, -6, -2] -> not zero.\n\n          This is not matching.\n\n      Correction: the operations are:\n\n          Operation1: choose a position i and decrease the prefix [1..i] by 1.\n          Operation2: choose a position i and decrease the suffix [i..n] by 1.\n          Operation3: increase the entire array by 1.\n\n      In the second test case: \n          a = [4, -2, 5]\n\n          The example says: \n              \"apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3\" -> \n                  a[0] = 4-4 = 0\n                  a[1] = -2-4 = -6\n                  a[2] = 5-4 = 1\n\n          Then \"apply the operation of decreasing 6 times on the prefix of length 1\" -> \n                  a[0] = 0-6 = -6\n                  a[1] = -6 (unchanged)\n                  a[2] = 1 (unchanged)\n\n          Then \"apply the operation of decreasing 3 times on the suffix of length 1\" -> \n                  This means: choose i=3 (1-indexed) -> then only a[2] is decreased by 3 -> a[2]=1-3=-2.\n\n          Then the array is [-6, -6, -2] -> not zero.\n\n          But the example says the answer is 13, and the operations used are 4+6+3=13.\n\n          However, the array is not zero.\n\n      I see the mistake: the operations are not applied in the way I described. \n\n          When we apply operation1 on prefix of length i, we decrease the first i elements.\n          When we apply operation2 on suffix of length i, we decrease the last n-i+1 elements.\n\n          In the example: \n              After the first step: [0, -6, 1]\n              Then apply operation1 on prefix of length 1: only the first element is decreased by 6 -> becomes [0-6, -6, 1] = [-6, -6, 1]\n              Then apply operation2 on suffix of length 1: only the last element is decreased by 3 -> becomes [-6, -6, 1-3] = [-6, -6, -2]\n\n          This is not zero.\n\n      The example says: \n              \"It can be shown that it's impossible to perform less actions to get the required array, so the answer is 13.\"\n\n      But the array is not zero. \n\n      Re-read the example: \n          \"In the second test case you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3\"\n\n          This is not the array [0, -6, 1] but [6,0,3]? \n\n      How can [4,-2,5] become [6,0,3] by decreasing the prefix of length 3 by 4? \n          4-4=0, not 6.\n\n      There is a known solution for this problem: \n          The answer is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between consecutive elements, plus the absolute value of the first element, and then minus the minimum absolute value of the first element and the last element? \n\n      But the example: \n          n=3, a=[4,-2,5]: \n              consecutive differences: |4-(-2)| = 6, | -2-5| = 7 -> sum=13.\n              then plus |4| = 4 -> 17, then minus min(|4|,|5|)=4 -> 13.\n\n      So: \n          ans = |a0| + |a1| + ... + |a_{n-1}|? -> no.\n\n      Alternatively, \n          ans = |a0| + |a_{n-1}| + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |a_{i+1}-a_i| - something?\n\n      Let me try: \n          |a0| = |4| = 4\n          |a_{n-1}| = |5| = 5\n          sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |a_{i+1}-a_i| = | -2-4| + |5-(-2)| = 6+7=13\n          then 4+5+13 = 22.\n\n      Another try: \n          ans = |a0| + |a_{n-1}| + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |a_{i+1}-a_i| - |a0| - |a_{n-1}|? -> then we get the sum of differences.\n\n      We know that in many array problems, the sum of absolute differences is the answer for some minimization.\n\n      But the example: \n          n=1: a=[-2] -> \n              sum of differences = 0 (since no consecutive) -> then plus |a0| = 2 -> 2.\n          n=3: a=[4,-2,5] -> \n              sum of differences = | -2-4| + |5-(-2)| = 6+7=13.\n\n      So output 13 for the second test case.\n\n      Therefore, the answer for a test case is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.\n\n      But wait, the first test case: \n          n=1: then there are no consecutive elements, so sum=0? but we output 2.\n\n      So that's not matching.\n\n      Unless we also include the first and last? \n\n      How about: \n          ans = |a0| + |a_{n-1}| + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |a_{i+1}-a_i| - |a0+a_{n-1}|?

wait, not exactly) \n\n      Actually, \n          f(1) = total operation1, because every operation1 (prefix) must include the first element.\n          g(n) = total operation2, because every operation2 (suffix) must include the last element.\n\n      But note: \n          f(i) = f(i+1) + (operation1 applied to prefix of exactly i) \n          so f(1) = total operation1.\n\n          Similarly, g(1) = total operation2? \n          operation2 applied to a suffix starting at i: then it covers i, i+1, ... , n.\n          So g(1) = operation2 applied to a suffix that includes 1? which is every operation2? because every suffix must include at least the first element only if the suffix starts at 1. \n          But if the suffix starts at 2, then it does not cover the first element.\n\n      So we should define:\n          Let f1_i = number of operation1 applied to prefix ending at i.\n          Let f2_i = number of operation2 applied to suffix starting at i.\n\n      Then the element at i is: \n          a_i - (sum_{j<=i} f1_j) - (sum_{j>=i} f2_j) + h = 0\n\n      The total cost = sum_i f1_i + sum_i f2_i + h.\n\n      We then have for each i: \n          sum_{j<=i} f1_j + sum_{j>=i} f2_j = a_i + h.\n\n      This is a system with n+1 variables (f1_1..f1_n, f2_1..f2_n, h) and n equations.\n\n      We want to minimize the total cost.\n\n      This is a linear programming problem.\n\n  Given the complexity, and the constraints (n up to 200,000) and the fact that the sum of n over test cases is 200,000, we need an efficient solution.\n\n  Known solution from a AC submission for this problem (CodeForces) is:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              ans += abs(a[i+1] - a[i])\n          if n == 1:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              m = min(a[0] - a[1], a[-1] - a[-2])\n              for i in range(1, n-1):\n                  m = min(m, a[i] - max(a[i-1], a[i+1]))\n              if m > 0:\n                  ans -= 2 * m\n              print(ans)\n\n  This doesn't match the sample.\n\n  After more research, the correct solution is: \n\n      tot = 0\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          tot += abs(a[i] - a[i+1])\n      print(tot + abs(a[0]) + abs(a[-1]) - (abs(a[0]) if a[0] > 0 else 0) - (abs(a[-1]) if a[-1] > 0 else 0) + min(abs(a[0]), abs(a[-1])))\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  Finally, a known solution from an AC submission for the exact problem (CodeForces problem with the sample) is:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          print(sum(abs(i) for i in [a[0]] + [a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n)] + [-a[-1]]))\n\n  Let me test:\n      n=1: \n          [a0] = [-2] -> list: [-2] and then range(1,1) is empty, and then [-a0] = [2] -> list: [-2, 2] -> sum(abs(i) for i in [-2,2]) = 2+2=4.\n\n      n=3: a=[4,-2,5]\n          [a0] = [4]\n          [a[1]-a[0] = -2-4 = -6, a[2]-a[1]=5-(-2)=7]\n          [-a[-1]] = [-5]\n          list: [4, -6, 7, -5] -> sum of abs: 4+6+7+5 = 22.\n\n  not 2 and 13.\n\n  Another AC solution:\n\n      import sys\n      input = sys.stdin.readline\n\n      t = int(input())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          b = [0] * n\n          b[0] = a[0]\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              b[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]\n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              if b[i] < 0:\n                  ans -= b[i]\n                  if i < n-1:\n                      b[i+1] += b[i]\n                  b[i] = 0\n              else:\n                  ans += b[i]\n          print(ans)\n\n  Test:\n      n=1: a=[-2] -> b=[-2] -> \n          i=0: b[0]<0 -> ans = 0 - (-2) = 2; then if i<0: no; then b[0]=0.\n          print(2) -> matches.\n\n      n=3: a=[4,-2,5] -> \n          b[0]=4\n          b[1]=-2-4 = -6\n          b[2]=5-(-2)=7\n          i=0: b[0]=4>=0 -> ans=0+4=4, b[0]=0?
