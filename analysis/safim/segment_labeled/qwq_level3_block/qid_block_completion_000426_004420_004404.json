Let's start with program1.py. **Program1.py:** The problem is to determine if a given array can be obtained through specific operations. The operations involve moving a pointer and incrementing/decrementing elements. The key constraints are that the pointer must end on the first element, and the operations can be done in any order. Looking at the code provided, the loop is iterating over the elements of the array (n). The variables s, f, m are being tracked. The code seems to be checking some conditions related to the cumulative sum (s). The line with the TODO is inside the loop where if s < 0, something needs to be done. Hmm, the problem's note mentions that after operations, the pointer must be on the first element. The approach here might involve tracking the path of the pointer. Let me think: each operation moves the pointer either forward or backward. The total movement must end at the start.",

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. I need to figure out the missing code parts for each so that when they're run in sequence via pipes, everything works correctly. Let's start with program1.py.\n\n**Program1.py:**\nThe problem is to determine if a given array can be obtained through specific operations. The operations involve moving a pointer and incrementing/decrementing elements. The key constraints are that the pointer must end on the first element, and the operations can be done in any order.\n\nLooking at the code provided, the loop is iterating over the elements of the array (n). The variables s, f, m are being tracked. The code seems to be checking some conditions related to the cumulative sum (s). The line with the TODO is inside the loop where if s < 0, something needs to be done. \n\nHmm, the problem's note mentions that after operations, the pointer must be on the first element. The approach here might involve tracking the path of the pointer. Let me think: each operation moves the pointer either forward or backward. The total movement must end at the start. \n\nWait, the operations are such that each move either increases the current element and moves right, or decreases and moves left. The pointer starts at position 0. To end at 0, the total number of left and right moves must balance out. But how does this relate to the array's elements?\n\nAnother thought: the sum of all elements must be 0? Because each operation either adds 1 to an element (when moving right) or subtracts 1 (when moving left). Wait, but each right move adds 1 to the current element and moves right. Each left move subtracts 1 from current and moves left. The total sum would be the net of all these operations. Let's see:\n\nEach right move (type 1) adds 1 to the current element. Each left move (type 2) subtracts 1 from current. But the total sum would be the number of right moves minus the number of left moves. Because each right move contributes +1, each left move contributes -1. But the total displacement of the pointer must be zero (since it starts and ends at first element). The displacement is (number of right steps) - (number of left steps) = 0. So the total right steps equals left steps. Therefore, the sum of all elements must be equal to (right steps - left steps) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, each right move is a step to the right, but each left move is a step to the left. The total displacement is (right steps - left steps) = 0. So right steps = left steps. \n\nBut the sum of the array elements is equal to (sum of all right moves' increments) minus (sum of all left moves' decrements). Wait, each right move adds 1 to the current element. Each left move subtracts 1 from the current element. So the total sum of the array is (number of right moves) - (number of left moves). But since right steps = left steps, the total sum must be zero. Wait, that's a key point. So if the sum of the array isn't zero, then it's impossible. But looking at the code, the variables s, f, m are being tracked. The code's initial approach might be checking for some other condition.\n\nWait, the code in program1.py has a loop over the elements of the array. The variable s is the cumulative sum. Let me see:\n\nThe code starts with s=0, f=0, m=0. For each i in n (the array elements):\n\ns += i. \n\nThen, if s <0: ... (TODO). \n\nThen, if s ==0, set f=1. \n\nThen, if f is set and s>0, set m=1 and break. \n\nThe output is \"YNEOS\" with some slicing. The idea here is probably that the cumulative sum must never be negative, and after reaching zero, it can't go back up. \n\nWait, the problem's operations have constraints. Let me think of the path of the pointer. The pointer starts at 0. Each right move (type1) increases the current element and moves right. Each left move (type2) decreases current and moves left. The pointer must end at 0. \n\nThe path of the pointer can be thought of as a walk on the array indices. The walk starts at 0, ends at 0, and each step is either +1 or -1 (but can't go beyond 0 or n-1). \n\nThe array's elements are the net number of times each position was incremented minus decremented. \n\nWait, each time you move right (type1), you add 1 to the current position before moving. So for example, moving right from position i adds 1 to a[i], then moves to i+1. \n\nSimilarly, moving left (type2) subtracts 1 from current position (a[i] is decreased by 1) and moves to i-1. \n\nThe total for each position a[i] is equal to the number of times you moved right from that position minus the number of times you moved left into it. \n\nAlternatively, the net for each position can be thought of as the difference between the number of times you entered from the left (right moves) and exited to the right (left moves). \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the cumulative sum must be non-negative. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. The cumulative sum s here is the sum of the array elements up to that point. Wait, maybe the code is tracking the path's movement. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to track the cumulative sum s. The variable f is a flag that becomes 1 when s reaches zero. The variable m is set if after f is set (i.e., after s has been zero), s becomes positive again. \n\nThe output is \"Yes\" if either m is not set (so after f is set, s never goes positive again) and f is set (so s reaches zero at the end). Wait, the code's print line is \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. Let's see: \n\nThe string is \"YNEOS\". The slice is [ (m or not f) : : 2 ]\n\nIf (m or not f) is 0, then the slice starts at 0, step 2: Y, E, O \u2192 but the step is 2, so first character is Y, then N, then E, etc. Wait, perhaps the code is using a trick to get \"Yes\" or \"No\". Let me see:\n\nSuppose the condition is that the answer is \"Yes\" only if m is 0 and f is 1. \n\nThe expression (m or not f) would be 1 if either m is true (so m is 1) or f is 0. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code's print line is \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. \n\nLet me think of possible values:\n\nIf the answer is \"Yes\", then the index should be 0, so that the slice starts at 0, and taking every 2nd character gives \"Y\" followed by \"S\" etc. Wait, perhaps the code is using a string where the correct indices give the right letters. Let me see:\n\nThe string is \"YNEOS\". Let's see the indices:\n\n0: Y\n\n1: N\n\n2: E\n\n3: O\n\n4: S\n\nSuppose the code wants to return \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nIf the condition is met (so answer is \"Yes\"), then the index should be 0, so the slice is [0::2], which would take Y, E, S \u2192 but that's not right. Wait, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the code is using a string where the correct indices give the first two letters. For example, \"YNEOS\" is 5 characters. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a trick where \"Yes\" is at index 0 and \"No\" at index 1. Let me see:\n\nThe code's print statement is \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. \n\nSuppose (m or not f) is 0 \u2192 then the slice starts at 0, step 2 \u2192 the first character is Y, then the next is E, then O. But the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\". Hmm, maybe the code is using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using a string where the correct indices are 0 and 2. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is structured such that when the condition is met (answer is \"Yes\"), the index is 0, so the slice is [0::2], which would take Y, E, O (but that's three letters). Alternatively, maybe the code is using a different string. Wait, the code's print line is written as \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the code is trying to get \"Yes\" or \"No\" by slicing. Let's see:\n\nIf the condition is met (answer is \"Yes\"), then the index is 0. The slice [0::2] would take characters 0, 2, 4 \u2192 Y, E, S \u2192 but that's \"YES\". But the problem allows any case, so maybe that's okay. But the problem requires \"Yes\" or \"No\". Alternatively, maybe the code is using a different string. Wait, perhaps the code's string is \"YNEOS\", and the correct indices are 0 and 1. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's print line is \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. Let's see:\n\nSuppose (m or not f) is 0 \u2192 then the slice starts at 0, step 2 \u2192 the first two characters are Y and E, but the step is 2, so the first character is Y, then the next is E (index 2?), no. Wait, the slice [0::2] would be every second character starting at 0: indices 0,2,4 \u2192 Y, E, S \u2192 \"YES\".\n\nIf (m or not f) is 1 \u2192 then the slice starts at 1, step 2 \u2192 indices 1,3 \u2192 N and O \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the code is using the string \"YNEOS\" to get \"YES\" or \"NO\" by taking the first two letters of the slice. Wait, but the code's output is \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2], which would give a substring. But the problem requires outputting \"Yes\" or \"No\". Hmm, maybe the code is using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using a string where the first two characters of the slice are the answer. For example, if the slice starts at 0, the first two letters are Y and N \u2192 but that's not right. Wait, perhaps the code is using a different string. Maybe the original code had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using a string like \"YNEOS\" and the correct indices are 0 and 1. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the following logic: the output is \"Yes\" if (m is 0 and f is 1), else \"No\". The condition (m or not f) would be 1 if either m is true (so m is 1) or f is 0. So when (m or not f) is 1, the code returns the substring starting at 1, which would be \"NO\" (since the first two letters would be N and E?), but I'm getting confused here. Maybe the code is written in a way that the correct answer is when (m is 0 and f is 1). \n\nThe variables s, f, m are tracking the cumulative sum. Let me think of the algorithm's logic. The code is looping through the array elements, accumulating s (sum of the array elements so far). \n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nInitially, s starts at 0. For each element in the array (n), s += i. \n\nWait, but the array is the input array. The problem requires that the array is the result of the operations. The code is trying to check some conditions on the array's elements. \n\nThe key idea here is that the path of the pointer must form a certain pattern. Let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. The pointer starts at 0, ends at 0. The sum of all elements must be equal to the number of right moves minus left moves. But since the total displacement is zero (right steps = left steps), the sum of the array must be zero. Wait, that's a necessary condition. So if the sum of the array isn't zero, then it's impossible. But in the code, the sum s is being tracked as the cumulative sum of the array elements. Wait, but the code's s is the cumulative sum of the array elements. Wait, the code's first line after input is:\n\ninput() \u2192 probably skipping the n? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait the code for program1 starts with:\n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n    input()\n    n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n    s,f,m = 0,0,0\n    for i in n:\n        s +=i\n        if s <0: # TODO\n        if s ==0: f=1\n        if f and s>0: m=1;break\n    print(...)\n\nWait, the first input() after the loop is probably reading the test case's n. Because the first line of each test case is n. So the code is:\n\nThe first input() after the for loop is reading the n (since the first line of each test case is the n). Then the next line reads the array. \n\nWait, the code's first line after the for loop is input() \u2192 which reads the n. Then the next line reads the array. \n\nSo the array is stored in n (but n is a list here, which is a problem because n was supposed to be the size. Wait, that's a mistake in the code. Wait, the code says:\n\ninput() \u2192 reads the n (the first line of the test case). Then the next line is n = list(map(...)), which is the array. So the variable n is actually the array. The actual size is the length of that list. \n\nSo the code is using n as the array, but the variable name is confusing. \n\nAnyway, the code is looping over each element in the array (the elements are the a_i's). The s is the cumulative sum of the array elements. \n\nThe problem requires that the array can be formed by the operations. The key constraints are:\n\n1. The sum of all elements must be zero. Because each right move adds 1 to an element, and each left move subtracts 1. The total right moves equal left moves (since the pointer ends where it started). So the total sum is (right moves - left moves) = 0. So if the sum of the array isn't zero, it's impossible. \n\nBut in the code, the sum s is the cumulative sum of the array elements. Wait, but the code is looping through the array elements and adding each to s. So s is the total sum of the array. Wait, no, because the loop is for each element in the array (the list n), so s is the sum of all elements. \n\nWait, the code's variables s, f, m are initialized to 0. Then for each element i in the array (n), s +=i. So after the loop, s is the total sum. But the code is checking during the loop. Wait, no, the code is looping through each element and adding to s each time. So s is the cumulative sum up to that point. Wait, no, the code is for each element in the array, adding to s. So after the first element, s is a[0], then after second, a[0]+a[1], etc. So s is the prefix sum. \n\nAh, that's crucial. The code is tracking the prefix sum. \n\nThe problem's operations must form a path where the pointer starts and ends at 0. The path's movement must correspond to the array's elements. \n\nThe key idea here is that the path of the pointer must form a certain pattern. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Each step is either moving right (adding 1 to current and moving) or left (subtracting 1 and moving). \n\nThe array's elements are the net number of times each position was incremented minus decremented. \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. The cumulative sum of the array's elements must be zero (as before). \n\nBut there's another condition: the path must never go below zero. Wait, perhaps the prefix sum must be non-negative? Or some other condition. \n\nAlternatively, the path's movement must form a Dyck path-like structure. \n\nWait, the code's approach is to track the prefix sum s. The variables f and m are flags. \n\nThe code's logic is:\n\n- For each element in the array, add to s (so s is the current prefix sum). \n\n- If s <0, then it's impossible (so we can return 'No'). \n\nWait, the first TODO is in the line if s <0: # TODO. So perhaps here, if s becomes negative, we can immediately return 'No' (set m to 1 or something). \n\nWait, the code's variables f and m are flags. Let me see:\n\nInitially, s starts at 0. \n\nFor each element in the array:\n\ns += i \n\nIf s <0 \u2192 then this is impossible, so the answer is 'No'. So perhaps here, we can set m to 1 and break, or return early. \n\nWait, the code's current structure is:\n\nif s <0: # TODO: Your code here\n\nThen, after that, if s ==0 \u2192 set f=1. \n\nThen, if f is set (meaning we've hit zero before) and s>0 \u2192 set m=1 and break. \n\nThe final condition is whether m is set or not. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to check two conditions:\n\n1. The prefix sum never goes negative. \n\n2. After the first time the prefix sum reaches zero, it doesn't go positive again. \n\nWait, let's think of the path. The pointer starts at 0. Each right move increases the current element and moves right. Each left move decreases current and moves left. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe array's elements are the net increments/decrements. \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of steps. The key is that the path must form a valid walk that starts and ends at 0, and the array's elements must correspond to the net changes. \n\nThe prefix sum s here is the current position's value? Or perhaps the cumulative sum up to that point. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is that the path must have a non-negative prefix sum at all times, and after reaching zero, it can't go back up. \n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\n- f is set when s reaches zero. \n\n- m is set if after f is set (i.e., after s has been zero), s becomes positive again. \n\nSo if m is set, then the answer is 'No'. \n\nThe code's print statement uses (m or not f) \u2192 so if m is true (meaning after reaching zero, s went positive again), or f is not set (meaning s never reached zero, so the total sum isn't zero?), then the answer is 'No'. \n\nWait, the total sum must be zero. Because the sum of all elements is s after processing all elements. So if the total sum isn't zero, then s would not be zero at the end. \n\nWait, the code's loop processes all elements, so after the loop, s is the total sum. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for each element in the array (the list n). So after processing all elements, s is the sum of all elements. \n\nSo, if the total sum is not zero, then s would not be zero at the end, so f would not be set (since the last element's addition would make s not zero). \n\nWait, but the code's f is set whenever s reaches zero during the loop. So if the total sum is not zero, then after processing all elements, s is not zero, so f may or may not have been set before. \n\nWait, the code's f is set to 1 whenever s reaches zero. So if the total sum is not zero, then the final s is not zero, but f could have been set to 1 if during the loop s reached zero at some point. \n\nBut the problem requires that the total sum must be zero. So the code must check that the total sum is zero. \n\nAh, so the code's current approach is missing that check. \n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nAfter the loop, s is the total sum. \n\nThe code's print statement uses (m or not f). \n\nBut if the total sum is not zero, then s after the loop is not zero, so f may not have been set (if the sum never reached zero during the loop). \n\nWait, but the code's f is set whenever s reaches zero. So if the total sum is not zero, then the final s is not zero, but f could have been set if during the loop s reached zero. \n\nBut the total sum must be zero for the problem's condition. \n\nTherefore, the code must also check that the total sum is zero. \n\nBut in the current code, the variables don't track that. \n\nHmm, so the code's current logic is missing the check for the total sum being zero. \n\nWait, but the code's f is set to 1 when s reaches zero. So if the total sum is zero, then s will be zero at the end, so f will be set. \n\nWait, the code's loop runs through all elements. So after processing all elements, s is the total sum. \n\nIf the total sum is zero, then s will be zero at the end, so f will be set (since s reaches zero at the end). \n\nTherefore, the code's f will be 1 only if the total sum is zero. \n\nWait, no. Suppose the total sum is zero, but during the loop, s never reaches zero until the end. Then f would be set to 1 at the end. \n\nSo the code's f is 1 if the total sum is zero. \n\nTherefore, the code's condition (m or not f) would be true if either m is set (meaning after reaching zero, s went positive again) or f is not set (total sum not zero). \n\nSo the code's logic is correct in that case. \n\nNow, the first TODO is in the line if s <0: ... \n\nThe problem requires that the path never goes below zero. Because the pointer can't move left from the first position. \n\nWait, the pointer can't move left when it's on the first element. So during the operations, whenever the pointer is at position 0, it can't do a left move. \n\nThe path's movement must ensure that the pointer never goes beyond the array's bounds. \n\nBut how does this relate to the prefix sum? \n\nAlternatively, the code's s is the cumulative sum of the array elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the s here represents the current position of the pointer? Or maybe the cumulative sum must be non-negative. \n\nWait, the code's logic is that whenever the cumulative sum (s) becomes negative, it's impossible. So the first TODO is to set m to 1 and break, or return 'No'. \n\nSo the missing code here is probably:\n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, after that, there's an if s ==0: f=1. \n\nAlternatively, the code should immediately return 'No' if s becomes negative. \n\nSo the code's first TODO line should be:\n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, after that, the code continues. \n\nAlternatively, the code should set m to 1 and break, so that m is set, leading to the output being 'No'. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nWait, but in the code's loop, after that, the code checks if s ==0 (sets f=1), then checks if f and s>0 (sets m=1 and breaks). \n\nHmm, but if s becomes negative, then the code would set m to 1, and break, so the loop stops. \n\nAlternatively, the code could set m to 1 and break, so that the final condition (m or not f) would be true, leading to 'No'. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is:\n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, after the first if s <0, the code proceeds to check if s ==0 (sets f=1), then the next condition. \n\nWait, but if s is negative, then the code would set m to 1 and break, so the rest of the loop is skipped. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is:\n\n- If at any point the cumulative sum s becomes negative, then it's impossible (so m is set to 1, and the loop breaks). \n\n- Then, after that, if the cumulative sum reaches zero (f is set), and later becomes positive again (m is set), then it's also impossible. \n\n- The total sum must be zero (so f is set at the end). \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct with that missing line. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is:\n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the code after the if s <0 is the next condition. So the code would have to break out of the loop early. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo program1's missing code is the line:\n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the code is:\n\nfor i in n:\n    s +=i\n    if s <0: # TODO\n    if s ==0: f=1\n    if f and s>0: m=1;break\n\nWait, the code's structure is that after the first if (the TODO), there are two more conditions. So the code's indentation is important. \n\nWait, the code's code is written as:\n\nfor i in n:\n    s +=i\n    if s <0: # TODO: Your code here\n    if s ==0: f=1\n    if f and s>0: m=1;break\n\nWait, the code's indentation is unclear here. Are the three conditions (the TODO, the s==0, and the f and s>0) all part of the same loop iteration? \n\nAssuming that the code is structured as:\n\nfor each element in n:\n    s +=i\n    if s <0: ... (the TODO)\n    if s ==0: set f=1\n    if (f is set) and (s>0): set m and break\n\nSo the code's first condition (the TODO) is the first check. \n\nThe missing code here is to set m to 1 and break if s <0. \n\nTherefore, the code for the first program's missing part is:\n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nSo that's the first part. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\n**Program2.py:**\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make all elements in at least one copy of the array equal. The operations are cloning an array (which increases the number of copies by 1) and swapping elements between any two copies (any positions). \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of operations. \n\nThe code provided is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThe code reads the input, splits into elements, counts the maximum frequency m. The loop is while m <n: ... \n\nWait, the minimal number of operations is needed. Let me think of the approach. \n\nThe key idea is that the best candidate is to make all elements in a copy equal to the most frequent element. Because that requires the least swaps. \n\nThe number of clones needed is (k-1), where k is the number of copies required. Because each clone adds a copy. \n\nWait, the process is: \n\nInitially, there is 1 copy. \n\nEach clone operation increases the number of copies by 1. \n\nTo get a copy where all elements are equal, we can use the following approach: \n\nSuppose the most frequent element occurs m times. \n\nWe need to have at least one copy where all elements are that element. \n\nThe minimal steps would involve:\n\n- The number of clones needed is (desired copies -1). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are (number of clones) plus the number of swaps. \n\nWait, the swaps can be done between any copies. So to get all elements in one copy to be the target element, we can use the existing copies. \n\nThe minimal steps would be: \n\nLet the target element be the one with maximum frequency m. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (number of clones needed) + (number of swaps needed). \n\nWait, but swaps don't cost operations. The operations are cloning and swaps. Wait, the problem says:\n\nEach operation is either cloning (cost 1) or swapping (cost 1). Wait, no, the problem says:\n\nYou can do operations of two types:\n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. This is one operation. \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe same copy). This is one operation. \n\nWait, the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies on any positions\". Each swap is one operation. \n\nWait, but the problem requires to find the minimal number of operations (clones + swaps) to get at least one copy where all elements are equal. \n\nHmm, the minimal steps would be to find the minimal number of clones and swaps needed. \n\nThe optimal approach is to use the most frequent element. Let's say the target element is x with frequency m. \n\nThe minimal steps would be: \n\nThe number of clones needed is (k-1), where k is the number of copies. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (n - m) per copy. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be calculated as follows: \n\nSuppose we have c copies. \n\nThe total number of elements of x across all copies is m * c. \n\nTo have one copy with all x's, we need at least n elements of x in that copy. \n\nThe total available x's across all copies is m * c. \n\nSo, to have one copy with all x's, we need m * c >= n. \n\nThe minimal c is ceil(n/m). \n\nThe number of clones needed is (c -1). \n\nThen, the number of swaps needed is (n - m) per copy? Or perhaps the swaps can be done in a way that requires (n - m) swaps. \n\nWait, the swaps can be done between any copies. \n\nSuppose we have c copies. \n\nThe total number of x's is m * c. \n\nWe need to have at least n x's in one copy. \n\nThe minimal c is ceil(n/m). \n\nThe number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThen, the swaps needed would be (n - m) * (ceil(n/m) -1) ? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) clones plus (n - m) swaps. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the array is [0,0,0,1,2], so m=3 (frequency of 0). n=5. \n\nTo have a copy with all 0's, we need at least 5 0's. \n\nThe current copies have 3 0's. \n\nSo we need to clone once (c=2 copies \u2192 total 6 0's). \n\nThen, in the second copy, we can swap the non-0 elements with 0's from other copies. \n\nWait, but how many swaps are needed? \n\nIn the first copy, there are 3 zeros and 2 non-zeros. \n\nThe second copy (clone) also has 3 zeros and 2 non-zeros. \n\nTo make one copy all zeros, we need to replace the 2 non-zeros in one copy with zeros from the other copy. \n\nEach swap can exchange a non-zero with a zero from another copy. \n\nEach swap can fix one element. \n\nSo for 2 non-zeros, need 2 swaps. \n\nTotal operations: 1 clone + 2 swaps \u2192 total 3. \n\nBut according to the formula (ceil(5/3) -1) + (5-3) \u2192 (2-1) +2 \u2192 3, which matches. \n\nAnother example: the second test case in the note. The array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The maximum frequency is 2 (0 appears twice). n=6. \n\nTo get a copy with all 0's, need ceil(6/2) =3 copies. \n\nClones needed: 2 (since starting with 1, need 3 copies \u2192 2 clones). \n\nThen, the swaps needed would be 6-2 =4 per copy? Or total swaps? \n\nWait, the total number of 0's across 3 copies is 2*3=6. So exactly enough. \n\nTo make one copy all 0's, you need to move all non-0 elements from that copy to other copies. \n\nEach non-0 element in the target copy must be swapped with a 0 from another copy. \n\nIn the original array, there are 2 zeros. \n\nAfter 2 clones, there are 3 copies, each with 2 zeros. \n\nTotal zeros: 6. \n\nTo make one copy all zeros, the other two copies must give up their non-zero elements. \n\nEach non-zero in the target copy (which has 4 non-zeros) must be swapped with a zero from another copy. \n\nEach swap can fix one element. So 4 swaps. \n\nTotal operations: 2 clones +4 swaps \u2192 6, which matches the note's example. \n\nSo the formula seems to be: \n\nThe minimal operations are (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, but in the first example, ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 (2-1) + (5-3) =1+2=3. \n\nIn the second example, ceil(6/2)=3 \u2192 (3-1) + (6-2)=2+4=6. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSo the minimal operations are (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, but what if m >=n? Then ceil(n/m) is 1, so (0) + (n -m). But if m >=n, then the array already has enough elements. Wait, if m is the maximum frequency, then if m >=n, then all elements are the same. So the answer is 0. \n\nWait, when m ==n, then the array is already all the same. So the formula would give (1-1) + (n -n) \u2192 0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nNow, looking at the code provided for program2.py:\n\nThe code reads the array, computes m as the maximum frequency. \n\nThen, the loop is while m <n: ... \n\nWait, the code's loop is while m <n: ... \n\nWait, but the code's variables are:\n\nr is initialized to 0. \n\nThe loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, the code needs to compute the required steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps. \n\nWait, the code's current structure is:\n\nr is the result. \n\nThe code has m as the maximum frequency. \n\nThe loop is while m <n: \n\nWait, but the loop condition is m <n. But m is the maximum frequency. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of clones needed. \n\nWait, the code's current code is incomplete. The TODO is inside the while loop. \n\nThe code's current code is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThe loop is while m <n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, but how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute the minimal number of clones needed (c = ceil(n/m) -1), and then the swaps needed (n - m). \n\nSo the total is c + (n - m). \n\nBut how to compute ceil(n/m). \n\nCeil(n/m) can be written as (n + m -1) // m. \n\nSo the code can compute c = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\nThen, the total is c + (n - m). \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the loop is while m <n. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of clones needed. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of clones such that m * (c+1) >=n. \n\nWait, the number of copies after c clones is (1 + c). \n\nThe total number of x's is m*(c+1). \n\nWe need m*(c+1) >=n \u2192 c+1 >= ceil(n/m). \n\nSo c = ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThus, the code can compute c = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\nThen, the swaps needed are (n - m) \n\nThus, the total is c + (n - m). \n\nBut the code's current structure is a loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is trying to find the minimal r. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps. \n\nThe code's variables:\n\nInitially, r is 0. \n\nThe loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of operations by incrementally increasing m. \n\nWait, but m is the maximum frequency. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal number of clones needed. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones (c) and then the swaps. \n\nThe code's current code is missing the calculation of r. \n\nThe correct code for the TODO part would be to compute r as (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nBut how to do that in the code. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is not needed. The code can compute it directly. \n\nWait, the code's loop is while m <n: \n\nBut m is the maximum frequency. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of operations by considering that after each clone, the maximum frequency increases. \n\nWait, but each clone increases the number of copies, but the maximum frequency per copy remains the same. \n\nWait, no. The maximum frequency is the count of the most frequent element in the original array. Cloning doesn't change the frequency of elements in the copies. \n\nWait, the maximum frequency m is the count of the most frequent element in the original array. \n\nCloning doesn't change that. \n\nThus, the code's loop is unnecessary. \n\nThe correct code would be to compute c = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\nThen, r = c + (n - m) \n\nBut if m >=n, then r is 0. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    c = (n + m -1) // m -1\n    r = c + (n - m)\n    print(r)\n\nBut the given code has a loop while m <n: \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of operations by considering that after each clone, the maximum frequency can be increased. \n\nWait, but that's not possible. The maximum frequency is fixed as the count in the original array. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of operations by considering other elements as the target. \n\nWait, the current code uses m as the maximum frequency. But maybe there's a better target element with a different frequency. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to take the maximum frequency, which is correct. \n\nThus, the code's loop is unnecessary. \n\nThe missing code in the TODO section is probably not needed, but the code's structure has a loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps in the loop. \n\nWait, the code's loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones (c) and then the swaps. \n\nWait, the code's variables are r=0. \n\nThe code's loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones (c) and then add to r. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake, and the correct code is to compute the formula directly. \n\nGiven that the code's current structure has a loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake, and the correct code is to compute the formula directly. \n\nThe problem's note says that in the second test case, the answer is 6. \n\nLet me see what the code would do with the second test case. \n\nThe array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. \n\nm is 2 (0 appears twice). \n\nn is 6. \n\nc = (6 +2-1)//2 -1 \u2192 (7//2)=3 \u2192 3-1=2. \n\nr = 2 + (6-2) \u2192 2+4=6 \u2192 correct. \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nr = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m) \n\nBut the code's current structure has a loop. \n\nThe code's loop is while m <n: \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones incrementally. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones (c) as the minimal c where m*(c+1) >=n. \n\nThe minimal c is ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThus, the code can compute c as (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\nBut the code's loop is while m <n: \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones by incrementally increasing m. \n\nWait, but m is fixed. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake and should be removed. \n\nThe correct code for program2's missing part is to compute the formula and set r accordingly. \n\nBut the code's current structure has a loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of operations as follows:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is (number of clones) + (number of swaps). \n\nThe number of clones is (c = ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThe number of swaps is (n - m). \n\nThus, the code can compute r = c + (n - m). \n\nSo the code's missing part is not needed, and the loop should be removed. \n\nBut the code's current structure has the loop. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps in the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake and should be replaced with the formula. \n\nThe correct code for program2's missing part is to compute r as (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    c = (n + m -1) // m -1\n    r = c + (n - m)\n    print(r)\n\nBut the given code has a loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute r as (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nBut the code's current structure has a loop. \n\nWait, the code's loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps. \n\nBut since m is fixed, the loop will run indefinitely if m <n. \n\nThus, the code's loop is incorrect and should be removed. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for program2 is to compute the formula and print it. \n\nHence, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing lines in the given code. \n\nThe given code has a loop while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, the code needs to compute the required steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps incrementally. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to remove the loop and compute the formula. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing code in the given code structure. \n\nThe given code's loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, the code must do something. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps. \n\nWait, the code's variables are r=0. \n\nThe loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones (c) as follows:\n\nEach clone increases the number of copies by 1. \n\nThe number of copies needed is c+1, where c is the number of clones. \n\nThe total number of x's is m*(c+1). \n\nWe need m*(c+1) >=n \u2192 c+1 >= ceil(n/m). \n\nThus, the minimal c is ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (n - m). \n\nThus, the total is c + (n -m). \n\nBut how to compute this in the code. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is not needed. \n\nThe correct code for program2's missing part is to compute the formula and set r to that value. \n\nThus, the code's loop is unnecessary and should be replaced with the formula. \n\nBut since the problem requires to fill in the missing code in the given structure, perhaps the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to compute the formula outside the loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to remove the loop and compute the formula. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute the formula and set r accordingly. \n\nBut the code's current structure has a loop. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to remove it. \n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor a in ...:\n    ... \n    m = max(...)\n    r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO\n    print(r)\n\nThe correct code would be to compute r as (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n -m) when m <n. \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nif m <n:\n    c = (n + m -1) // m -1\n    r = c + (n -m)\nprint(r)\n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is not needed, and the loop should be replaced with this. \n\nBut since the problem requires to fill in the missing code in the given structure, perhaps the loop is a mistake and the code should be written as:\n\nThe code's loop is not needed. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is to compute the formula and set r. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is to compute the formula and set r. \n\nBut the code's structure has a loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is trying to compute the required number of clones and swaps incrementally. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones (c) as follows:\n\nInitially, c is 0. \n\nThe required number of copies is (c+1). \n\nThe total x's is m*(c+1). \n\nWe need to find the minimal c where m*(c+1) >=n. \n\nThus, c is the minimal integer such that c+1 >= ceil(n/m). \n\nThus, c = ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThe code can compute this as (n + m -1) // m -1. \n\nThus, the code can compute this and set r = c + (n -m). \n\nThus, the code's loop is not needed. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is to compute the formula and set r. \n\nBut the code's structure has a loop. \n\nPerhaps the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to remove it. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute the formula and set r. \n\nNow, moving to program3.py. \n\n**Program3.py:**\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of seconds to infect all nodes in a rooted tree. \n\nThe process each second involves two steps: \n\n1.

The root is 1. \n\nThe code's first step is to count the number of nodes at each level. \n\nThe code loops over the parent array (a) and increments counter[ai]. \n\nWait, but the parent array's elements are the parents of the nodes 2 to n. \n\nThe root is 1, so its parent is not in the array. \n\nThe code's counter is counting the number of children each node has. \n\nWait, for each node i (from 2 to n), its parent is p_i. \n\nThus, for each p_i in the parent array, the node p_i has a child. \n\nThus, the counter[ai] counts the number of children each node has. \n\nThe count list is the list of the number of children for each node. \n\nThen, the code sorts the count list. \n\nThen, for each i in 0..num_level-1, count[i] is set to max(count[i] - i -2, 0). \n\nHmm, not sure what this is doing. \n\nThe code then sets L and R as 0 and max(count). \n\nThe check function is to see if a certain k can be the minimal required. \n\nThe binary search is between L and R. \n\nThe missing code is in the else clause of the binary search loop. \n\nThe code's binary search is trying to find the minimal R such that check(R) is true. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nif check(mid):\n\n    R = mid\n\nelse:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else clause should set L = mid. \n\nThus, the missing code is L = mid. \n\nWait, the binary search is looking for the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nThe loop is while R - L >1. \n\nIf check(mid) is true \u2192 R = mid (trying to find a smaller R). \n\nElse \u2192 need to increase L. \n\nThus, the missing code is L = mid. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nelse:\n\n    L = mid\n\nThus, the code's binary search is correct. \n\nThe final return is num_level +1 + R. \n\nThe code's approach is based on the levels of the tree and the number of children. \n\nThe problem's solution likely involves the maximum number of children at each level, and the minimal time is related to the levels and the required steps. \n\nThe code's logic is probably correct, and the missing part is simply setting L = mid in the else clause. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is:\n\nelse:\n    L = mid\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe three missing parts are:\n\nProgram1: \n\nif s <0:\n    m = 1\n    break\n\nProgram2: \n\nThe code's loop is unnecessary. The correct code should compute the formula directly. But since the problem requires to fill in the missing code in the given structure, perhaps the loop is a mistake and the code should be written as:\n\nWait, the code's loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps. \n\nBut since m is fixed, the loop will run indefinitely. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is to compute the formula and set r. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing code in the given structure. \n\nThe given code's loop is while m <n: \n\nInside the loop, the code must do something. \n\nPerhaps the code is
