So for each program, the completion is the code that replaces the TODO part. \n\nFor program1.py, the missing part is in the for loop:\n\n    for i in range(20):\n        if (sz >> i) & 1 == 1:\n            if dist is None:\n                dist = jump[i][s]\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n                dist = merge(dist, jump[i][s])\n            s += (1 << i)\n\nSo the completion for program1 is the line 'dist = merge(dist, jump[i][s])'.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing part is in the elif block after checking >=1600. The code should print Division 2. So the completion is 'print('Division 2')'.\n\nFor program3.py, the missing line is in the else clause (when p is 0 and the run length is odd). The code is 'p = i'.\n\nSo the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"dist = merge(dist, jump[i][s])\",\n    \"program2\": \"print('Division 2')\",\n    \"program3\": \"p = i\"\n}\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos. Let me check again.\n\nProgram1's code: The loop is over i in 20, and when the bit is set, and dist is not None, the code merges the current dist with jump[i][s]. The merge function takes two tuples and returns a new one. So yes, that line is correct.\n\nProgram2: The code after the first if is an elif for >=1600, so the print statement is correct.\n\nProgram3: The code in the else block (when p is 0) sets p to the current index (i). That's correct.\n\nYes, that should be it."
