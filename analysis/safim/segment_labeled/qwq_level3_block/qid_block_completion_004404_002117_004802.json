Because in binary search, if the mid doesn't satisfy, we need to search higher. So the missing line here is L = mid. That's straightforward. Next, program2.py. The problem is to reconstruct array a from the last column of matrix b. The code is trying some bitwise operations. The note example shows that the a array can be derived through XOR operations. The code loops over bits and uses some bitwise XOR. The TODO is in a loop where for each j and i, they check l = j ^ (1<<i). If some condition (k ^ (l < j)) is true, then there's code missing. Hmm, the code is probably trying to compute a[j] based on the given b array. The approach might involve using the properties of XOR and the way the matrix is built.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about finding the minimal number of seconds to infect all nodes in a tree. The approach given in the code seems to involve some kind of BFS or level-based calculation. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe solve function takes an array a, which I assume is the list of parents for each node. The code uses a counter to count something, maybe the number of nodes at each level? Then it sorts the counts and does some processing. The check function is part of a binary search, probably to find the minimal time. \n\nWait, the code has a TODO in the binary search loop. The loop is between L and R, and in the else clause, it's missing code. The current code has:\n\nwhile R - L >1:\n    mid = ...\n    if check(mid): R=mid else: #TODO\n\nThe else part should probably set L to mid, right? Because in binary search, if the mid doesn't satisfy, we need to search higher. So the missing line here is L = mid. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, program2.py. The problem is to reconstruct array a from the last column of matrix b. The code is trying some bitwise operations. The note example shows that the a array can be derived through XOR operations. The code loops over bits and uses some bitwise XOR. The TODO is in a loop where for each j and i, they check l = j ^ (1<<i). If some condition (k ^ (l < j)) is true, then there's code missing. \n\nHmm, the code is probably trying to compute a[j] based on the given b array. The approach might involve using the properties of XOR and the way the matrix is built. The loops over bits (like 19 iterations for 2^19) suggest that each bit is being handled separately. The code might be using the fact that each bit in a can be determined by the bits in the given b array. The line where l = j ^ (1<<i) is probably part of a bitwise inclusion-exclusion approach. The missing code might be something like a[j] ^= a[l], or similar. Since the problem requires reconstructing a from the last column, perhaps the code is using the fact that each a_j is the XOR of certain elements in the b array. \n\nWait, looking at the note example, the given b's last column is [0,2,1], and the a array is [1,2,3]. Let me see how that works. The matrix construction is such that each b[i][j] is the XOR of b[i][j-1] and b[i-1][j]. The last column elements are b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n. The code is trying to reverse-engineer a from these. \n\nThe code loops over k in 0,1. Maybe trying two possibilities? Or perhaps it's a way to handle some parity. The inner loops over i (bit positions) and j (indices). The line l = j ^ (1<<i) suggests that for each bit position, they are flipping that bit in j's binary representation. The condition k ^ (l < j) might be checking some ordering. The missing code is probably an XOR assignment between a[j] and a[l], or similar. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the fact that a_j can be computed as the XOR of b_{j,n} and some other terms. Since the problem requires that any valid a is acceptable, perhaps the code is trying to compute a through some bitwise operations. The exact line might be a[j] ^= a[l], but I need to think carefully. \n\nLooking at the code structure, the a array is initialized as the input list. Then, for each bit i, and for each j, they compute l as j XOR (1<<i). If the condition holds, then perhaps they are updating a[j] with a[l]. The final print is reversed(a), so maybe the a array is being built in reverse? \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the fact that a_j is equal to the XOR of b_{j,n} and some combination of previous elements. Since the problem allows any valid a, perhaps the code is trying to compute a through a bitwise Gray code approach. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the correct line is a[j] ^= a[l], but I'm not sure. Let me think of the example. For the note example, n=3, the given b's last column is [0,2,1]. The a array is [1,2,3]. Let's see how that would work. \n\nSuppose for j=2 (since indices are 0-based?), but maybe the code is 1-based. Wait, the input a is the list from the second line, which is the b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n. So the code's a is the list of those values. \n\nWait the code starts with a = [*map(int, ...)], so a is the list of the given b_{i,n} values. Then, the loops are trying to compute the a array (the original a) from this. \n\nThe code's final line is print(*reversed(a)), so perhaps the a array is being modified in place, and the reversed is because of some order. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the fact that a_j can be computed as the XOR of the current a[j] and a[l], where l is j with a bit flipped. The loops over bits and flipping bits might be part of a process to decompose the problem into each bit. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute a as the XOR of certain elements. For instance, the a array can be derived by a[j] = b_{j,n} XOR a_{j-1} or something. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the fact that the last column's elements can be expressed in terms of the a array. Let me think of the recurrence. \n\nThe matrix b is built such that b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] XOR b[i-1][j]. The last column is for j =n. \n\nLooking at the last column, for each row i, the value b_{i,n} is the XOR of all paths from (0, n) to (i, n) moving left or up? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the value b_{i,n} is the XOR of a_1 XOR a_2 ... XOR a_i? Or some combination. \n\nWait, in the note example, the a array is [1,2,3]. The last column for i=1 is 0. Let's see:\n\nThe matrix for the note example is given as:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,2,3\n\nRow 1:0,1,3,0\n\nRow 2:0,1,2,2\n\nRow3:0,1,3,1\n\nWait the last column (j=3) for rows 1,2,3 are 0,2,1. \n\nLooking at row 1's last element (0), which is b_{1,3}. How is that computed? \n\nThe recurrence for b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] XOR b[i-1][j]. \n\nFor row 1, j=3:\n\nb[1][3] = b[1][2] XOR b[0][3]. \n\nb[1][2] is 3 (from the example's row1, third element?), and b[0][3] is 3. So 3 XOR3 is 0. \n\nHmm, but how does this relate to the a array? \n\nThe a array is the first row (since b_{0,i} = a_i). \n\nThe problem requires to find a such that the given last column elements are correct. \n\nThe key is to find a such that for each i from 1 to n, the value b_{i,n} is computed correctly based on the a array. \n\nThe approach in the code might be to compute a via some bitwise operations. The loops over bits and flipping bits suggest that each bit of a's elements can be determined independently. \n\nThe code's loops are for k in 0,1 (maybe trying two possibilities?), then for each bit i (up to 19, since 2^19 is over 5e5), and for each j in 0..n-1. \n\nThe line l = j ^ (1<<i) is flipping the i-th bit of j. \n\nThe condition k ^ (l < j) is a bit unclear. Let me see: k is either 0 or 1. The ^ here is bitwise XOR. So if l < j, then (l<j) is 1, so k ^1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to process the bits in a way that for each bit position, it's considering the bits in the a array. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the fact that a_j can be computed as the XOR of the given b_{i,n} and some combination of previous a's. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute a as the XOR of the given array elements in a certain way. \n\nWait, the code's final line is print(*reversed(a)), so perhaps the a array is being built in reverse. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the fact that a_j is equal to the XOR of the current a[j] and a[l], where l is j with a bit flipped. \n\nMaybe the missing line is a[j] ^= a[l]. \n\nLet me think of the example. Suppose for the note example, the given a array (the input) is [0,2,1]. \n\nThe code loops over k in 0 and 1. Let's see for k=0 first. \n\nFor each bit i from 0 to 18 (since 19 iterations), and for each j from 0 to 2 (since n=3). \n\nTake i=0 (bit 0), j=0: l = 0 ^1<<0 =1. \n\nCheck if k (0) ^ (l<j) (1<0 is false, so 0). So 0 ^0 is 0. So the condition is true? Wait the code's condition is \"if k^(l<j) and l <n\". Wait the code's line is:\n\nif k^(l<j) and l <n:\n\nWait the code's line is written as:\n\nif k^(l<j) and l <n:\n\nWait, the code's line is:\n\nif k^(l<j) and l <n:\n\nWait, the first part is k XOR (l <j). The second part is l <n. \n\nWait, the code's line is:\n\nif k ^ (l < j) and l <n:\n\nWait, the first condition is (k) XOR (l <j). The second is l <n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to process the bits in a way that for each j, and for each bit, it's flipping bits and updating a[j] based on a[l], where l is j with a bit flipped. \n\nSuppose the code is doing something like a[j] ^= a[l], but only when certain conditions are met. \n\nIn the note example, let's see for j=2 (the third element, since n=3, indices 0,1,2). \n\nSuppose for i=1 (bit 1), j=2. \n\nl = 2 ^ (1<<1) = 2 ^ 2 =0. \n\nThen, l <j is 0 <2 \u2192 true (1). \n\nk is 0. So 0 XOR 1 \u2192 1. \n\nSo the condition is (1) and (0 <3 \u2192 yes). So the condition is true. \n\nThen, the missing code would be something like a[j] ^= a[l]. \n\nIf that's the case, then for j=2, l=0, so a[2] ^= a[0]. \n\nInitially, a[0] is 0 (from the input's first element, which is b_{1,n}=0?), but wait the input is the list of b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n. So for the note example, the input a is [0,2,1]. So a[0] is 0 (b_{1,n}=0), a[1]=2 (b_{2,n}=2), a[2]=1 (b_{3,n}=1). \n\nSo for j=2, l=0, the code would do a[2] ^= a[0] \u2192 1 ^0 \u2192 remains 1. \n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute a as the XOR of the given array elements in a way that reconstructs the original a array. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the fact that a_j can be computed as the XOR of the given b_{j,n} and some combination of previous a's. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the fact that the a array can be derived by reversing the process. Since the last column's elements are built from the a array, perhaps each a_j is equal to the XOR of the current a[j] and some other terms. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the fact that the a array can be found by taking the given array and applying some bitwise transformations. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe the correct line is a[j] ^= a[l], so the missing code is a[j] ^= a[l]. \n\nLet me proceed with that assumption for now. \n\nNow moving to program3.py. The problem is to check if a string is perfectly balanced. The condition is that for every substring, any two characters in the substring must have counts differing by at most 1. \n\nThe code given starts by checking if the number of unique characters is 1 or the string has all unique characters (so length equals unique count). Those cases are handled with 'YES'. \n\nElse, it loops from i=1 to a (the length of the string). For each i, if the current character is in the previous substring (s[:i]), then it creates a string w by repeating s[:i] up to a length a, then checks if s equals w. If so, print 'YES', else 'NO'. \n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me think of the test cases. \n\nThe first example is \"aba\", which is perfectly balanced. The code would check for i=1: s[1] is 'b', which is not in s[0], so the loop continues. Then i=2: s[2] is 'a', which is in s[:2] (since 'a' is present). Then w is (s[:2] * a)[:a]. s[:2] is 'ab', a is 3. So 'abab'[:3] is 'aba', which matches s, so output 'YES'. \n\nThe second example is 'abb'. The first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2 (s[2] is 'b', which is in 'ab'). Then s[:2] is 'ab', repeated to 3 gives 'aba', which is not equal to 'abb', so output 'NO'. \n\nThe third example 'abc' has all unique, so the code returns 'YES' via the a==b condition. \n\nSo the code's approach is to check if the string is a repetition of some prefix. Because if the string is a repetition, then any substring would have characters with counts differing by at most 1. \n\nWait, but how does that ensure the condition? For example, if the string is 'abab', then a substring like 'abab' has counts 2 and 2, which is okay. But a substring like 'aba' has a:2, b:1. The difference is 1, which is okay. \n\nBut the code's logic is that if the string can be formed by repeating a prefix, then it's okay. \n\nHowever, the problem requires that for every possible substring and every pair of characters in the substring, their counts differ by at most 1. \n\nThe code's current approach may not cover all cases. For example, a string like 'abac' might not be covered. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, if the string is not a repetition of a prefix, then it returns 'NO'. \n\nWait, the code's else clause is when the number of unique characters is more than 1 and the length is not equal to the unique count. Then, it loops through each i from 1 to a-1. If at any point the current character is in the previous substring, then it checks if the entire string is a repetition of s[:i]. If yes, then 'YES', else 'NO'. \n\nBut if the string is not a repetition of any prefix, then it would output 'NO'. \n\nThis approach might work because if the string is not a repetition of a prefix, then there exists some substring where two characters have counts differing by more than 1. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find if the string is periodic, and if so, then it's balanced. \n\nBut the problem requires that all substrings meet the condition. \n\nThe code's current approach may not handle all cases. For example, consider the string 'abba'. The unique characters are 2, length 4. The first i where s[i] is in s[:i] is i=2 (s[2] is 'b', which is in 'ab'). Then s[:2] is 'ab', repeated to 4 gives 'abab', which is not equal to 'abba', so the code would output 'NO'. But the actual string 'abba' may not be perfectly balanced. Let's see: the substring 'bb' has counts a:0, b:2. The difference is 2, so it's invalid. So the code's output is correct. \n\nAnother example: 'abcab'. The code would check for i=3 (s[3] is 'a', which is in s[:3] = 'abc'). Then s[:3] is 'abc', repeated to 5 gives 'abcab', which matches the string. So the code would output 'YES'. But let's see if that's correct. Take substring 'abcab' itself: counts a:2, b:2, c:1. The difference between a and c is 1, which is okay. But any substring like 'abca' has a:2, b:1, c:1. The difference between a and others is 1. So maybe it's okay. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct. \n\nThe code's missing part is in the else clause of the loop. The current code has:\n\nif s == w: print(\"YES\") else: # TODO: Your code here break\n\nThe 'break' is after the else, so if the check fails, it breaks the loop and proceeds to print 'NO'? \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor i in range(1, a):\n    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n        w = (s[:i] *a)[:a]\n        if s ==w:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            # TODO\n        break\n\nWait, the loop breaks after the first i where s[i] is in s[:i]. So if the first such i doesn't form a repeating prefix, then the code would go to the else part and then break, but then what? \n\nWait, the code is inside the else clause of the original condition (when b !=1 and a !=b). The code loops over i from 1 to a-1. The first i where s[i] is in s[:i], it creates w and checks. If s equals w, then print 'YES' and break. Else, the code does the TODO and breaks. \n\nBut after the break, the loop exits, and since it's inside the for loop, the code would proceed to the next part. But since the for loop is inside the else clause, after breaking, the code would exit the for loop and then what? The code is missing the print statement for the 'NO' case. \n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor _ in ...:\n    s = ... \n    a = len(s)\n    b = len(set(s))\n    if b ==1 or a ==b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        for i in ...:\n            if ...:\n                ... \n                if s ==w:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    # TODO\n                break\n        # after loop, need to print \"NO\" ?\n\nWait, the code's structure is that after the for loop, if none of the i's worked, then it should print \"NO\". But currently, the code only has the print(\"YES\") in the if, and the else part (the TODO) is inside the loop. \n\nWait, the code's current structure is:\n\nIn the else block (when not b==1 or a==b):\n\nfor i in 1 to a-1:\n\n   if s[i] in s[:i]:\n\n       compute w, check if s equals w.\n\n       if yes: print YES and break.\n\n       else: \n\n           # TODO code here\n\n           break \n\n   else: continue?\n\nWait, the code's loop breaks after the first i where s[i] is in s[:i]. So if that first i's check fails (s !=w), then the code does the TODO and breaks. \n\nBut after breaking, the code exits the for loop, and then what? The code is missing the print(\"NO\") in that case. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is probably to print \"NO\" and break, but the code structure is such that after the loop, it needs to print \"NO\". \n\nAlternatively, the code should, after the loop, print \"NO\". But the current code doesn't have that. \n\nWait, the code's current code after the for loop (inside the else clause) has no print statement. So after the loop, it would just end, but the problem requires to print for each test case. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is probably to print \"NO\" after the loop. \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nInside the else clause (when not the first two conditions):\n\n   for i in ...:\n\n       if condition:\n\n           ... \n\n           if s ==w: print YES and break\n\n           else: \n\n               # TODO: probably print NO and break?\n\n           break \n\n   # after loop, need to print NO?\n\nWait, the code's loop breaks when it finds the first i where s[i] is in s[:i]. So after that, the loop is exited. \n\nIf the first such i's check passes, then it prints YES and breaks. \n\nIf it doesn't pass, then the code does the TODO (which is missing) and breaks. \n\nBut after breaking, the code is outside the loop, and there's no print statement. \n\nHence, the code is missing a print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code should, after the loop, print \"NO\". \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is probably not needed, but the code after the loop must have a print(\"NO\"). \n\nWait, the code's current code after the loop is nothing. So the code would not print anything for cases where the first i's check fails. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to, after the loop, print \"NO\". \n\nBut the code's current structure is:\n\nAfter the for loop, there's no print. So the code is missing that. \n\nHence, the missing code in the TODO is not needed, but the code after the loop should have a print(\"NO\"). \n\nWait, but the problem says to output only the missing lines. The code's TODO is in the else clause of the if s==w check. \n\nThe code's current code is:\n\nelse:\n\n    for i in ...:\n\n        if s[i] in s[:i]:\n\n            w = ... \n\n            if s ==w:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            break\n\n    # after loop, nothing\n\nSo the code is missing the print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nHence, the correct code would be to add a print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing lines. The code's TODO is in the else clause of the if s==w. \n\nWait, the code's structure is that after the for loop, if the loop didn't find any i where s[i] is in s[:i], then the code would not execute the inner block, and thus, after the loop, it should print \"NO\". \n\nBut in the code, the loop breaks only when it finds such an i. So if there is no such i, the loop completes, and then the code should print \"NO\". \n\nHence, the code needs to have a print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the program3.py is to add a print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's TODO is to add a print(\"NO\") there, but the code's structure requires that after the loop, the code must print \"NO\". \n\nWait, the code's current code after the loop is nothing. So the code is missing that. \n\nHence, the correct completion for program3 is to add a print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing line in the binary search loop is L = mid. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing line is a[j] ^= a[l]. \n\nFor program3.py, the missing code is to add a print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nWait, but the code's structure for program3's else clause is:\n\nelse:\n\n    for ...:\n\n        ... \n\n    print(\"NO\") ?\n\nYes, that's probably the case. \n\nSo the code for program3 should have after the for loop, a print(\"NO\"). \n\nHence, the missing code for program3 is the print(\"NO\") after the loop. \n\nSo the code for program3's missing part is to add that line. \n\nNow, putting all together in the required JSON format."
