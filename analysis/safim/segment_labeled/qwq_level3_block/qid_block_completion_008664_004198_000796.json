So the min function can be used here. Wait, the code currently has:\n\nres = min(res, candidate) But in the code, the initial res is set to INF (n+1, n).

Let\u2019s denote for each position i:\n\nLet\u2019s let P_i be the number of prefix operations (type1) that include i.

Wait, P_i is the sum of p_j for j >=i. So p_i = P_i - P_{i+1} \n\nSimilarly, S_i is the sum of s_j for j <=i. So s_i = S_i - S_{i-1} Therefore, the total type1 operations is sum_{i=1 to n} p_i = sum_{i=1 to n} (P_i - P_{i+1}) ) = P_1 - P_{n+1} \n\nBut P_{n+1} is 0, so it's P_1. Similarly, the total type2 operations is sum s_i = S_n - S_0 (assuming S_0 =0). Hmm, this might not be the easiest path. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows. Let\u2019s think of the variables P_i and S_i. The equations are P_i + S_i = a_i + x for all i. We need to find P_i and S_i such that:\n\nP_i is non-decreasing? Because P_i = sum_{j >=i} p_j, so P_i = P_{i+1} + p_i. So P_i >= P_{i+1} \n\nSimilarly, S_i is non-decreasing? Because S_i = S_{i-1} + s_i. So S_i >= S_{i-1} \n\nWait, S_i is the sum of s_j for j <=i. So S_i = S_{i-1} + s_i. So S_i is non-decreasing. Similarly, P_i is the sum of p_j for j >=i. So P_i = P_{i+1} + p_i. So P_i >= P_{i+1}. Therefore, the P array is non-increasing, and the S array is non-decreasing. The total operations are sum p_i + sum s_i + x \n\nExpressed in terms of P and S:\n\nsum p_i = P_1 (since p_i = P_i - P_{i+1}, so telescoping sum gives P_1 - P_{n+1} = P_1)\n\nsum s_i = S_n (since s_i = S_i - S_{i-1}, so telescoping sum gives S_n - S_0 = S_n) Thus total operations is P_1 + S_n + x \n\nWe need to minimize this.

Wait, for example, if all a_i are positive, then x can be 0. If some a_i are negative, then x must be at least the maximum of (-a_i) for those a_i. Thus, the minimal x is max(0, max( -a_i for all i where a_i <0 )). Let me denote this minimal x as x_min. Then, for x =x_min, we can compute the required D_i = a_i +x_min.

Let me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can compute P and S as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s first compute the D array as D_i = a_i +x_min. We need to find P and S such that P[i] + S[i] = D_i for all i, P is non-increasing, S is non-decreasing. The total is P[1] + S[n] +x_min. To minimize this, we need to choose P and S such that P[1] and S[n] are as small as possible. Let me think of the following way to construct P and S: \n\nLet\u2019s first compute the minimal possible P array. Since P is non-increasing, the minimal P[1] is achieved when P is as small as possible. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal P and S can be found by setting P[i] as the minimum possible given the constraints. Alternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array. Let\u2019s set P[i] = D_i - S[i].

Doing this 4 times: \n\n4 \u2192 4-4=0 \n\n0 \u21920-4 =-4 \n\n3 \u21923-4 =-1 Then they do 6 type1 operations on i=1 (each reduces first element by 1). So first element becomes 0-6 =-6 Then they do 3 type2 operations on i=3 (each reduces the last element by 1 \u2192 the third element is -1-3 =-4. The total steps are 4+6+3 =13. The final array after all operations: \n\nThe type3 operations are 0.

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about finding pairs of substrings of length w such that when multiplied by a given substring and added, the result mod 9 equals k_i. The code provided has some parts missing, especially in the loops where they check possible v1 and v2 values. \n\nLooking at the code structure, the main idea is to precompute all possible values of the substrings of length w mod 9 and store their starting indices. Then, for each query, compute the value of the given l_i to r_i substring mod 9 (vlr), and find v1 and v2 such that (v1 * vlr + v2) mod9 equals k_i. The challenge is to find the minimal L1 and L2.\n\nIn the current code, for each possible v1 and v2, they check if the condition holds. If v1 == v2, they need at least two indices in that list. Otherwise, pick one from v1's list and another from v2's. The problem is how to efficiently find the minimal L1 and L2.\n\nThe missing part in the code is the part where they need to select the best possible L1 and L2 when v1 != v2. The code currently has a comment where it says \"# TODO: Your code here\". The idea here is to pick the smallest possible L1 from v1's list and the smallest L2 from v2's list, then compare to find the minimal pair. \n\nSo, for each v1 and v2 that satisfy the equation, we can get the first element of indices[v1] (smallest L1) and first of indices[v2] (smallest L2). Then, check if they are different. If so, this pair is a candidate. We need to track the minimum (L1, L2) pair across all valid (v1, v2) pairs. \n\nThe code should loop through all possible v1 and v2 (0-8 each), check if (v1 * vlr + v2) mod9 is k. For each such pair, if there are entries in both indices[v1] and indices[v2], then take the first elements (smallest L1 and L2). Then, compare this pair with the current minimum. Also, need to ensure L1 != L2. \n\nWait, but the problem states that the substrings must be different, so L1 can't equal L2. So when v1 == v2, we need to pick two different indices. So in that case, if the list has at least two elements, take the first two. \n\nSo in the code, for the case when v1 != v2, the code should check if indices[v1] and indices[v2] are non-empty. Then, take the first element of v1's list as L1, and first of v2's list as L2. But also, need to ensure L1 != L2. Wait, but even if they are the same starting index? Because the substrings are of length w, so if L1 and L2 are the same, then the substrings are the same. So in that case, that pair is invalid. So when v1 and v2 are different, but their first elements are the same, then that's not allowed. So in that case, perhaps we need to pick the first element from v1 and the second from v2? Or maybe the first from v2? Hmm, but that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, when v1 != v2, the indices lists are separate, so their first elements could be different. But maybe not. For example, if two different v values have the same starting index. But in that case, the substrings would be the same (since they start at the same L and have same length w). Wait no, because their values mod9 are different. Wait, no. Wait, the value mod9 is v1 and v2. So if two different v's have the same starting index, that's impossible because the same substring can't have two different mod9 values. So that can't happen. So when v1 != v2, the indices lists are for different substrings, so their first elements can't be the same. So L1 and L2 will be different. \n\nTherefore, when v1 != v2, taking the first elements from each list gives a valid pair. \n\nSo the code for the v1 != v2 case would be:\n\nif indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n    l1 = indices[v1][0]\n    l2 = indices[v2][0]\n    if l1 != l2:  # which they should be, but maybe check?\n        candidate = (l1, l2)\n        compare with current res.\n\nBut how to track the minimal pair. The current res is stored as a tuple, and we can compare tuples lex order. Since (L1, L2) is considered smaller if L1 is smaller, or same L1 and L2 smaller. \n\nSo for each valid (v1, v2), compute possible candidates and track the minimum. \n\nIn the code, the current loop is:\n\nfor v1 in 0..8:\n    for v2 in 0..8:\n        if (v1 * vlr + v2) mod9 ==k:\n            if v1 ==v2:\n                if len(indices[v1]) >=2:\n                    candidate is (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\n                    compare with res\n            else:\n                if indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n                    candidate is (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\n                    compare with res\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is to handle this. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nelse:\n    if len(indices[v1]) > 0 and len(indices[v2]) > 0:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code needs to get the first elements of each list and form a candidate pair, then compare with the current res. \n\nSo the code here would be something like:\n\nl1 = indices[v1][0]\nl2 = indices[v2][0]\ncandidate = (l1, l2)\nif candidate < res:\n    res = candidate\n\nBut also, since the problem requires L1 < L2? No, the problem says L1 != L2, but the order between them doesn't matter except that we have to choose the minimal L1 first, then minimal L2. So the pair (L1, L2) must have L1 as small as possible, and L2 as small as possible given L1. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"find a pair where L1 is as small as possible. If there are many matching pairs in this case, then minimize L2.\"\n\nSo the priority is first to have the smallest possible L1, then the smallest possible L2. \n\nThus, when comparing candidates, the tuple (L1, L2) is considered better if it's lex smaller. So (2,4) is better than (2,5), and (1,5) is better than (2,4). \n\nTherefore, the code can track the minimal candidate by comparing tuples. \n\nSo the code for the else case (v1 != v2) would be:\n\nl1 = indices[v1][0]\nl2 = indices[v2][0]\ncandidate = (l1, l2)\nif candidate < res:\n    res = candidate\n\nBut also, since the problem requires that the two substrings are different, but since v1 != v2, their starting indices can't be the same (as explained before), so the pair is valid. \n\nSo putting this into code, the missing part is:\n\nl1 = indices[v1][0]\nl2 = indices[v2][0]\ncandidate = (l1, l2)\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nWait, but the initial res is set to INF (n+1, n). So comparing with that would work. \n\nSo the code for the TODO part would be:\n\nl1 = indices[v1][0]\nl2 = indices[v2][0]\ncandidate = (l1, l2)\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nBut also, need to make sure that the two indices are different. Wait, but as discussed earlier, since v1 != v2, their indices can't be the same. So no need to check. \n\nSo that's the code for the else part. \n\nNow, for the v1 == v2 case, when there are at least two elements in the list, the minimal L1 and L2 would be the first two elements. So the candidate is (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1]). \n\nThus, in the code for the v1 ==v2 case:\n\nif len(indices[v1]) >1:\n    candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\n    res = min(res, candidate)\n\nSo putting all together, the code inside the loops would be:\n\nfor v1 in range(9):\n    for v2 in range(9):\n        if ((v1 * vlr + v2) %9 +9) %9 ==k:\n            if v1 ==v2:\n                if len(indices[v1]) >=2:\n                    candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\n                    if candidate < res:\n                        res = candidate\n            else:\n                if indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n                    candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0])\n                    if candidate < res:\n                        res = candidate\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial res is set to INF. So the min function can be used here. \n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nBut in the code, the initial res is set to INF (n+1, n). So the min between the current res and the candidate will pick the smaller one. \n\nSo the code for the else part (v1 !=v2) would be:\n\nif indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n    l1 = indices[v1][0]\n    l2 = indices[v2][0]\n    candidate = (l1, l2)\n    if candidate < res:\n        res = candidate\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is:\n\nl1 = indices[v1][0]\nl2 = indices[v2][0]\ncandidate = (l1, l2)\nres = min(res, candidate)\n\nWait, but the code has to check if indices[v1] and indices[v2] are non-empty. So the code inside the else block (the TODO part) is:\n\nif indices[v1] and indices[v2]:\n    l1 = indices[v1][0]\n    l2 = indices[v2][0]\n    candidate = (l1, l2)\n    res = min(res, candidate)\n\nSo that's the code to fill in the TODO part. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make all a_i zero using three operations. \n\nThe operations are:\n\n1. Choose i, decrease a_1..a_i by 1. (prefix)\n2. Choose i, decrease a_i..a_n by 1. (suffix)\n3. Increase all by 1. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal steps. \n\nHmm, the key is to model the operations. Let's think of the operations as variables. Let me think of the problem in terms of how many times each operation is used. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet x be the number of times operation 3 is used. Each time we do operation 3, all elements are increased by 1. So to reach zero, the total increase must be offset by the other operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as follows. \n\nSuppose we perform operation 3 exactly x times. Then, the net effect on each a_i is:\n\na_i + x - (number of prefix operations affecting it) - (number of suffix operations affecting it) = 0 \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nEach prefix operation (type 1) on position i reduces a_1..a_i by 1. \n\nEach suffix operation (type 2) on position j reduces a_j..a_n by 1. \n\nEach type 3 operation increases all by 1. \n\nThe total for a_i is:\n\noriginal a_i + (number of type3) - (number of type1 ops where i <= their position) - (number of type2 ops where i >= their position) = 0 \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let x be the number of type3 operations. \n\nLet\u2019s let p_i be the number of type1 operations on position i. \n\nSimilarly, s_i be the number of type2 operations on position i. \n\nThen for each position i:\n\na_i + x - (sum_{j=1 to i} p_j) - (sum_{j=i to n} s_j) = 0 \n\nWe need to find p_i, s_i, x such that all equations are satisfied, and the total operations (sum p_i + sum s_i + x) is minimized. \n\nHmm, this seems complex. Maybe there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the required steps. \n\nSuppose we decide the order of operations. Since operation 3 affects all elements, perhaps it's better to do all type3 operations first? Or last? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the cumulative effect. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required steps for each position. \n\nLet\u2019s consider the required number of times each position is covered by the prefix and suffix operations. \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i:\n\nLet\u2019s let P_i be the number of prefix operations (type1) that include i. So P_i = sum_{j >=i} p_j \n\nSimilarly, S_i is the number of suffix operations (type2) that include i. So S_i = sum_{j <=i} s_j \n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\na_i + x - (P_i + S_i) = 0 \n\n=> P_i + S_i = a_i + x \n\nThe total operations are sum p_j (type1) + sum s_j (type2) + x \n\nBut how to express sum p_j and sum s_j in terms of P and S? \n\nWait, P_i is the sum of p_j for j >=i. So p_i = P_i - P_{i+1} \n\nSimilarly, S_i is the sum of s_j for j <=i. So s_i = S_i - S_{i-1} \n\nTherefore, the total type1 operations is sum_{i=1 to n} p_i = sum_{i=1 to n} (P_i - P_{i+1}) ) = P_1 - P_{n+1} \n\nBut P_{n+1} is 0, so it's P_1. \n\nSimilarly, the total type2 operations is sum s_i = S_n - S_0 (assuming S_0 =0). \n\nHmm, this might not be the easiest path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows. \n\nLet\u2019s think of the variables P_i and S_i. \n\nThe equations are P_i + S_i = a_i + x for all i. \n\nWe need to find P_i and S_i such that:\n\nP_i is non-decreasing? Because P_i = sum_{j >=i} p_j, so P_i = P_{i+1} + p_i. So P_i >= P_{i+1} \n\nSimilarly, S_i is non-decreasing? Because S_i = S_{i-1} + s_i. So S_i >= S_{i-1} \n\nWait, S_i is the sum of s_j for j <=i. So S_i = S_{i-1} + s_i. So S_i is non-decreasing. \n\nSimilarly, P_i is the sum of p_j for j >=i. So P_i = P_{i+1} + p_i. So P_i >= P_{i+1}. \n\nTherefore, the P array is non-increasing, and the S array is non-decreasing. \n\nThe total operations are sum p_i + sum s_i + x \n\nExpressed in terms of P and S:\n\nsum p_i = P_1 (since p_i = P_i - P_{i+1}, so telescoping sum gives P_1 - P_{n+1} = P_1)\n\nsum s_i = S_n (since s_i = S_i - S_{i-1}, so telescoping sum gives S_n - S_0 = S_n)\n\nThus total operations is P_1 + S_n + x \n\nWe need to minimize this. \n\nThe constraints are:\n\nFor all i: P_i + S_i = a_i + x \n\nAlso, P is non-increasing, S is non-decreasing. \n\nWe can think of x as a variable to choose, and then find P and S arrays that satisfy the constraints. \n\nThe idea is to choose x such that the minimal total is achieved. \n\nLet me see if we can express P and S in terms of x. \n\nLet me rearrange the equation: \n\nP_i = a_i + x - S_i \n\nBut since P_i must be non-increasing and S_i non-decreasing, perhaps we can find for a given x, the minimal possible P_1 + S_n. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each x, the minimal possible total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the optimal x by considering the possible x values. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the variables in terms of the minimal steps. \n\nLet me consider that for each position i, the minimal possible P_i + S_i is a_i +x. \n\nBut since P is non-increasing and S is non-decreasing, perhaps the optimal way is to set P_i and S_i such that they form the \"best\" possible non-increasing and non-decreasing sequences. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be found by considering the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s consider that for each position i, the minimal possible P_i and S_i must satisfy P_i + S_i = a_i +x. \n\nTo minimize P_1 + S_n, given that P is non-increasing and S is non-decreasing. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s define for each i, the minimal possible P_i and S_i. \n\nSuppose we fix x. Then, for each i, P_i = a_i +x - S_i. \n\nSince P must be non-increasing, and S non-decreasing, \n\nfor all i < j: \n\nP_i >= P_j \n\n=> (a_i +x - S_i) >= (a_j +x - S_j) \n\n=> a_i - S_i >= a_j - S_j \n\n=> (a_i - a_j) >= (S_i - S_j) \n\nBut since S is non-decreasing, S_i - S_j <=0 when i <j. \n\nHmm, this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal P and S can be determined by considering the following: \n\nLet\u2019s define for each i, the minimal possible P_i and S_i. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s let S be a non-decreasing sequence. \n\nThen, for each i, P_i = a_i +x - S_i \n\nSince P must be non-increasing, \n\nfor all i < j: \n\na_i +x - S_i >= a_j +x - S_j \n\n=> a_i - S_i >= a_j - S_j \n\n=> (a_i - a_j) >= (S_i - S_j) \n\nBut since S is non-decreasing, S_j >= S_i when j>i. \n\nThus, S_i - S_j <=0. \n\nSo the inequality becomes a_i - a_j >= (S_i - S_j). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be found by choosing x such that the required P and S sequences can be formed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s consider that the minimal steps would be achieved when x is chosen such that the required P and S sequences are as small as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s define for each position i, the minimal possible P_i and S_i. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample input. \n\nSample Input 2: \n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nThe sample output is 13. \n\nWait, the second test case in the note is:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=3, a = [4, 0, 3]\n\nThe solution uses 4 prefix operations on i=3 (so each time, the first 3 elements are decreased by 1, but since it's prefix up to 3, which is the entire array. Wait, the note says: \n\nIn the second test case, they applied the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 (so each time, the first 3 elements are decreased by 1. So after 4 times, the array becomes (4-4, 0-4, 3-4) \u2192 but that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operations. \n\nWait the first operation is choosing a position i and decrease the first i elements by 1. So for i=3, the first 3 elements are decreased by 1. \n\nThe note says: \n\nThey applied 4 times on the prefix of length 3 (so each time, the first 3 elements are decreased by 1. So after 4 times, the first three elements are each decreased by 4. \n\nThen the array becomes (4-4=0, 0-4= -4, 3-4= -1). Then they applied 6 times on the prefix of length 1 (so each time, the first element is decreased by 1. So after 6 times, the first element is 0-6 = -6. Then they applied 3 times on the suffix of length 1 (so the last element is decreased by 3, so 3-4 (from first step) -3 \u2192 but I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s think of the problem as follows. \n\nThe total number of operations is the sum of all prefix operations (type1), suffix operations (type2), and type3. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let x be the number of type3 operations. \n\nThen, for each position i, the total decrease from type1 and type2 must be exactly a_i +x. \n\nThe type1 operations contribute to the first i elements, and type2 to the last j elements. \n\nAlternatively, the total decrease for position i is (number of type1 ops with i' >=i) + (number of type2 ops with j' <=i). \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i:\n\nD_i = (number of type1 ops with i' >=i) + (number of type2 ops with j' <=i) \n\nThen D_i must equal a_i +x. \n\nThe total operations are:\n\nsum_{i=1 to n} (number of type1 ops at i) + sum_{i=1 to n} (number of type2 ops at i) + x \n\nWe need to minimize this. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let p_i be the number of type1 ops at position i. \n\nSimilarly, s_i for type2. \n\nThen D_i = sum_{k=i}^n p_k + sum_{k=1}^i s_k \n\nThe total operations are sum p_i + sum s_i +x \n\nWe need to minimize this. \n\nThe constraints are D_i = a_i +x for all i. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. \n\nLet me think of variables p_i and s_i. \n\nBut this might be too complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal steps by considering the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s consider that the minimal steps would be achieved when x is chosen such that the required D_i = a_i +x can be formed with minimal p and s. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s define for each position i, the minimal possible D_i. \n\nWait, but D_i must be exactly a_i +x. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by choosing x such that the required D_i can be formed with the minimal possible p and s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s consider that the minimal steps would be the sum of the maximum of the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nLet\u2019s compute two arrays:\n\nLet\u2019s compute for each position i the prefix maximum up to i, and the suffix maximum from i. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the following: \n\nLet\u2019s define for each position i, the required D_i = a_i +x. \n\nThe D array must satisfy that the prefix sum of p's and suffix sum of s's can form it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by choosing x such that the D array can be split into a non-increasing and non-decreasing part. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note: \n\nThe minimal steps can be found by considering the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the prefix array P where P[i] is the number of type1 operations affecting position i. \n\nSimilarly, the suffix array S where S[i] is the number of type2 operations affecting position i. \n\nThen, P[i] + S[i] = a[i] +x \n\nThe total operations are sum(P) + sum(S) +x \n\nBut P must be non-increasing (since each type1 operation on i affects all positions up to i, so the count for position i is the number of type1 ops at i and higher). \n\nWait, perhaps P[i] is the number of type1 operations with position >=i. \n\nSimilarly, S[i] is the number of type2 operations with position <=i. \n\nThen, P is a non-increasing sequence (since P[i] = P[i+1] + p_i), so each step can only decrease or stay the same. \n\nSimilarly, S is a non-decreasing sequence (since S[i] = S[i-1] + s_i). \n\nThe total operations are P[1] (sum of all p_i) + S[n] (sum of all s_i) +x \n\nWe need to minimize this. \n\nThe constraints are P[i] + S[i] = a[i] +x for all i. \n\nLet me think of x as a variable. For a given x, can we find P and S sequences that satisfy the constraints and are non-increasing/non-decreasing? \n\nThe minimal total would be the minimal over all possible x of (P[1] + S[n] +x). \n\nTo find the minimal, perhaps we can find x such that the required P and S sequences can be formed. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nFor each possible x, compute the minimal possible P[1] + S[n]. \n\nBut how to choose x? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps x can be determined by the following: \n\nThe minimal x is such that the required D_i = a_i +x must be at least the minimal possible D_i given the constraints on P and S. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s define for each position i, the minimal possible P[i] and S[i]. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s compute for each position i the minimal possible P[i] and S[i] such that P[i] + S[i] = a[i] +x, and the sequences are non-increasing and non-decreasing. \n\nThe minimal total is achieved when P and S are as small as possible. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\n1. Choose x such that for all i, a[i] +x >=0. Because P and S are non-negative (since they are counts of operations). \n\n2. The minimal steps would be when P and S are as small as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by setting x to be the minimal possible value such that a_i +x >=0 for all i. \n\nWait, but x can be negative? Because type3 operations can be done multiple times, but if x is negative, that would mean doing type3 operations a negative number of times, which isn't allowed. \n\nWait, the problem says that the operations can be applied any number of times, but the count must be non-negative. So x must be non-negative. \n\nWait, no. The problem says \"number of actions\" so all counts must be non-negative. \n\nThus, x must be non-negative. \n\nWait, the type3 operation is to increase all by 1. So doing it x times adds x to each a_i. \n\nThus, the total decrease from type1 and type2 must be exactly a_i +x. \n\nThus, for each i, the total decrease (P[i] + S[i]) must be exactly a_i +x. \n\nSince P and S are non-negative, this requires that a_i +x >=0 for all i. \n\nThus, x must be at least the minimal (-a_i) over all i. \n\nWait, if any a_i is negative, then x must be at least -a_i to make a_i +x >=0. \n\nBut the problem's input allows a_i to be negative. \n\nWait the input says a_i can be as low as -1e9. \n\nHmm, but then if a_i is negative, then to have a_i +x >=0, x must be at least -a_i. \n\nBut if x is chosen as the maximum of (-a_i) for all i where a_i <0, then that would ensure that all a_i +x are non-negative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is the maximum between 0 and the minimal required to make all a_i +x non-negative. \n\nWait, but x can be any value as long as it's chosen such that a_i +x >=0 for all i. \n\nThe minimal steps would be achieved when x is as small as possible. \n\nThus, the minimal possible x is the maximum between 0 and the minimal required to make all a_i +x >=0. \n\nWait, the minimal x to satisfy a_i +x >=0 for all i is x = max(0, max(-a_i for all i where a_i <0)). \n\nWait, no. Let me think: \n\nSuppose some a_i is negative. To have a_i +x >=0, x must be at least -a_i. \n\nThus, the minimal x is the maximum of ( -a_i for all i where a_i <0 ), but if that is negative, then x can be 0. \n\nWait, for example, if all a_i are positive, then x can be 0. \n\nIf some a_i are negative, then x must be at least the maximum of (-a_i) for those a_i. \n\nThus, the minimal x is max(0, max( -a_i for all i where a_i <0 )). \n\nLet me denote this minimal x as x_min. \n\nThen, for x =x_min, we can compute the required D_i = a_i +x_min. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding P and S sequences such that P[i] + S[i] = D_i for all i, with P non-increasing and S non-decreasing, and the total steps (P[1] + S[n] +x_min) is minimized. \n\nThus, the problem now is to find such P and S sequences with minimal total. \n\nNow, how to compute P and S sequences for this x_min? \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can compute P and S as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s first compute the D array as D_i = a_i +x_min. \n\nWe need to find P and S such that P[i] + S[i] = D_i for all i, P is non-increasing, S is non-decreasing. \n\nThe total is P[1] + S[n] +x_min. \n\nTo minimize this, we need to choose P and S such that P[1] and S[n] are as small as possible. \n\nLet me think of the following way to construct P and S: \n\nLet\u2019s first compute the minimal possible P array. \n\nSince P is non-increasing, the minimal P[1] is achieved when P is as small as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal P and S can be found by setting P[i] as the minimum possible given the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array. \n\nLet\u2019s set P[i] = D_i - S[i]. \n\nBut since S is non-decreasing, perhaps we can find S in terms of P. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array. \n\nLet\u2019s start from the first position. \n\nP[1] can be as small as possible, but since P is non-increasing, P[1] must be >= P[2] >= ... >= P[n]. \n\nAlso, S must be non-decreasing. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nInitialize S as an array of zeros. \n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n: \n\nS[i] = D[i] - P[i] \n\nBut since S must be non-decreasing, S[i] >= S[i-1]. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array. \n\nLet\u2019s iterate from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, P[i] can be as small as possible, but must be >= P[i+1], and S[i] = D[i] - P[i] must be >= S[i-1]. \n\nHmm, this might be a way to compute it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array. \n\nLet\u2019s set P[i] = min(D[i], P[i-1]) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's constraints: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array such that P is non-increasing and S is non-decreasing. \n\nLet\u2019s compute P as follows: \n\nP[i] = min(D[i], P[i-1]) \n\nWait, but this might not work. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following: \n\nThe minimal total is achieved when P[1] is as small as possible and S[n] is as small as possible. \n\nTo minimize P[1], we can set P[1] as small as possible, but subject to the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal P and S can be computed by setting P[i] = D[i] - S[i], and ensuring that S is non-decreasing and P is non-increasing. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nInitialize S as an array. \n\nLet\u2019s start with S[1] = 0. \n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n: \n\nS[i] must be >= S[i-1], and P[i] = D[i] - S[i] must be >= P[i+1]. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array. \n\nLet\u2019s compute P as the minimum possible non-increasing sequence such that for each i, P[i] <= D[i], and S[i] = D[i] - P[i] is non-decreasing. \n\nTo find such a P array, we can proceed as follows: \n\nInitialize S array as non-decreasing. \n\nLet\u2019s compute S as the minimal possible non-decreasing array such that S[i] <= D[i], and then P[i] = D[i] - S[i] is non-increasing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible S array. \n\nLet\u2019s compute S as the minimal non-decreasing array such that S[i] <= D[i], and then P[i] = D[i] - S[i] is non-increasing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can be used: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible total steps by considering that the minimal steps are the sum of the maximum between the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach is correct: \n\nThe minimal steps can be computed as follows: \n\nCompute the prefix array P where P[i] is the maximum number of type1 operations affecting position i. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach is correct: \n\nLet\u2019s compute two arrays: \n\nLet\u2019s compute for each position i the minimal possible P[i] and S[i]. \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal possible P array as follows: \n\nP[i] = min(D[i], P[i-1]) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample input 2: \n\nThe minimal steps can be computed as follows: \n\nThe minimal steps is the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix maximum and suffix maximum. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach is correct: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the prefix array: \n\nprefix[i] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i] \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be computed by considering the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal steps as the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's note: \n\nThe minimal steps can be computed by considering that the type1 and type2 operations can be used to cover the required D_i. \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal steps as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal steps as the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach is correct: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal steps as follows: \n\nThe minimal steps is the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix maximum and suffix maximum. \n\nWait, perhaps the following steps can be taken: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the prefix array P where P[i] is the maximum number of type1 operations affecting the first i elements. \n\nSimilarly, the suffix array S where S[i] is the maximum number of type2 operations affecting the last i elements. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be computed as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s compute the minimal steps as the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the sample input 2. \n\nSample Input 2: \n\nn=3, a = [4,0,3]. \n\nThe minimal x is 0 (since all a_i are non-negative). \n\nThus D_i = a_i +0 = [4,0,3]. \n\nWe need to find P and S such that P[i] + S[i] = D_i for all i, P is non-increasing, S is non-decreasing. \n\nThe total steps are P[1] + S[3] +0. \n\nWe need to minimize P[1] + S[3]. \n\nLet\u2019s see the sample solution: \n\nThey used 4 type1 on i=3 (so P[3] +=4, P[2] +=4, P[1] +=4. \n\nThen 6 type1 on i=1 (so P[1] +=6, P[2] and P[3] not affected. \n\nWait, no. Each type1 operation on i=1 adds 1 to P[1], but not to P[2] or P[3]. \n\nWait, the type1 operation on i=1 affects the first 1 elements. So for each such operation, P[1] increases by 1, but P[2] and P[3] remain the same. \n\nWait, the P array is the count of type1 operations affecting each position. \n\nWait, for each type1 operation at position j, it affects all positions up to j. So for each such operation, P[1..j] each get +1. \n\nThus, the total P[i] is the number of type1 operations with j >=i. \n\nSo P is a non-increasing sequence. \n\nSimilarly, S[i] is the number of type2 operations with j <=i. \n\nSo S is non-decreasing. \n\nIn the sample solution, the steps were: \n\n4 type1 on i=3 \u2192 each of these contributes to P[1], P[2], P[3]. \n\nSo after 4 operations, P[1] =4, P[2]=4, P[3]=4. \n\nThen 6 type1 on i=1 \u2192 each adds 1 to P[1]. So P[1] becomes 4+6=10, P[2] remains 4, P[3] remains4. \n\nThen 3 type2 on i=3 \u2192 each adds 1 to S[3], so S[3] =3. \n\nWait, but the type2 operations on i=3 would affect positions 3 to n (3 in this case). So each such operation adds 1 to S[3]. \n\nThus, S[1] is the number of type2 operations with j <=1 \u2192 which is 0. \n\nS[2] is the number of type2 operations with j <=2 \u2192 also 0. \n\nS[3] is the number of type2 operations with j <=3 \u2192 3. \n\nThus, the S array is [0,0,3]. \n\nNow, check the D_i: \n\nFor i=1: P[1] + S[1] =10 +0 =10 \u2192 but D_1 is 4. \n\nWait, this doesn't add up. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's sample explanation. \n\nThe sample explanation says that after 4 prefix operations on i=3, the array becomes 6,0,3 \u2192 but I'm confused. \n\nWait the initial a is [4,0,3]. \n\nEach type1 operation on i=3 reduces the first 3 elements by 1. \n\nDoing this 4 times: \n\n4 \u2192 4-4=0 \n\n0 \u21920-4 =-4 \n\n3 \u21923-4 =-1 \n\nThen they do 6 type1 operations on i=1 (each reduces first element by 1). \n\nSo first element becomes 0-6 =-6 \n\nThen they do 3 type2 operations on i=3 (each reduces the last element by 1 \u2192 the third element is -1-3 =-4. \n\nThe total steps are 4+6+3 =13. \n\nThe final array after all operations: \n\nThe type3 operations are 0. \n\nThe total decrease for each position: \n\nFor position 1: \n\ntype1 ops on i=3 (4 times) \u2192 contributes 4 \n\ntype1 ops on i=1 (6 times) \u2192 contributes 6 \n\nTotal decrease: 10 \u2192 so D_1 =4 (original a_i) +0 (x) =4 \u2192 10 =4 \u2192 no, that's not possible. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's understanding. \n\nWait the problem says that the three operations are: \n\n1. Choose i and decrease the first i elements by 1. \n\n2. Choose i and decrease the elements from i to n by 1. \n\n3. Increase all elements by 1. \n\nThe goal is to make all elements zero. \n\nThe sample input 2's solution uses 4 operations of type1 on i=3 (each reduces first 3 elements by 1 \u2192 total decrease of 4 for each of the first three elements). \n\nThen 6 type1 on i=1 (each reduces first element by 1 \u2192 total decrease of 6 for first element). \n\nThen 3 type2 on i=3 (each reduces elements 3 to 3 (just third) by 1 \u2192 total decrease of 3 for third element. \n\nThe total decrease for each element: \n\nFirst element: 4 (from first type1) +6 (from second type1) \u2192 10 \n\nSecond element:4 (from first type1) \n\nThird element:4 (from first type1) +3 (from type2) \u21927 \n\nThe original a was [4,0,3]. \n\nSo the total decrease must equal the original a_i plus x (type3 operations). \n\nWait, but type3 operations are not used here (x=0). \n\nThus, the total decrease for first element must be 4 \u2192 but it's 10 \u2192 this is impossible. \n\nHmm, this suggests that I misunderstood the problem's operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the type3 operation is applied first. \n\nWait the sample explanation says: \n\n\"In the second test case you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3. After that apply the operation of decreasing 6 times on the prefix of length 1 and 3 times on the suffix of length 1. In total, the number of actions will be 4 +6+3=13.

I see now. The type3 operations are used to increase all elements. \n\nSo the total steps are the sum of all three operations. \n\nThe total decrease from type1 and type2 must be exactly a_i +x. \n\nWait, the equation is: \n\na_i +x - (type1 and type2 decreases) =0 \u2192 \n\ntype1 and type2 decreases = a_i +x \n\nThus, in the sample explanation, the final array after all operations is zero. \n\nThe total decrease for first element is 10 (from type1) \n\nThe type3 operations are x. \n\nThus, 4 (original a_i) +x -10 =0 \u2192 x=6 \n\nAh! So the type3 operations are done 6 times. \n\nThus, the total steps are 4 (type1) +6 (type1) +3 (type2) +6 (type3) \u2192 total 19? But the sample says the answer is 13. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait the sample explanation says the total actions are 4+6+3 =13. \n\nAh! The type3 operations are not counted in the sample explanation's total. \n\nWait the problem says the three operations are counted in the total. \n\nWait the problem says: \n\n\"the minimum number of actions he needs to perform to make the moisture of each tree equal to 0\". \n\nEach operation (type1, type2, type3) is counted as one action. \n\nIn the sample explanation, they applied 4 type1, 6 type1, 3 type2 \u2192 total 13 actions. \n\nBut how does that make the array zero? \n\nAh, because they also used type3 operations. \n\nWait the sample explanation says: \n\n\"In the second test case you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3.

Increase the level of moisture of all trees by 1. \n\nThe sample explanation says that the total actions are 4+6+3 =13. \n\nThis suggests that the type3 operations are not used in this case. \n\nBut how does the array become zero? \n\nThe final array after the operations described is [-6, -4, -4]. \n\nTo reach zero, they must have done type3 operations. \n\nBut the sample explanation says the answer is 13, which implies that the type3 operations are not used. \n\nThis suggests that I misunderstood the problem's operations. \n\nWait perhaps the type3 operation is applied first. \n\nWait the problem says that the operations can be applied in any order. \n\nPerhaps the sample explanation uses type3 operations in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation's steps are: \n\nThey applied 4 type1 on i=3 \u2192 first three elements reduced by 4 each. \n\nThen 6 type1 on i=1 \u2192 first element reduced by 6. \n\nThen 3 type2 on i=3 \u2192 third element reduced by 3. \n\nThe total decrease for first element is 4+6 =10 \n\nSecond element:4 \n\nThird:4+3=7 \n\nThe original a_i are 4,0,3. \n\nThus, the total decrease must be a_i +x. \n\nTo reach zero: \n\nFor first element: 4 +x -10 =0 \u2192 x=6 \n\nSecond:0 +x -4 =0 \u2192 x=4 \n\nThird:3 +x -7 =0 \u2192x=4 \n\nThis is impossible since x must be the same for all. \n\nThus, this approach won't work. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the sample explanation must have used type3 operations. \n\nBut the sample says the total actions are 13. \n\nThus, the type3 operations must be part of the steps. \n\nWait perhaps the sample explanation's steps are: \n\nThey applied 4 type1 on i=3 \u2192 first three elements reduced by 4 each. \n\nThen 6 type1 on i=1 \u2192 first element reduced by 6. \n\nThen 3 type2 on i=3 \u2192 third element reduced by 3. \n\nThen, they applied 6 type3 operations. \n\nTotal actions:4+6+3+6=19. \n\nBut the sample says the answer is 13. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nAh!

It can be shown that it's impossible to perform less actions to get the required array, so the answer is 13.\"\n\nWait the first step after applying 4 times type1 on i=3 gives the array 6,0,3? \n\nWait the initial array is [4,0,3]. \n\nAfter applying 4 times type1 on i=3: \n\nEach type1 operation reduces first 3 elements by 1. \n\nSo after 4 times: \n\n4-4=0, 0-4 =-4, 3-4 =-1 \u2192 but the sample says the array becomes 6,0,3. \n\nThis suggests that I misunderstood the operations. \n\nAh! Perhaps the type1 operation is to decrease the first i elements by 1, but the type3 operation is applied first. \n\nWait the sample explanation says that after applying the 4 type1 operations, the array is 6,0,3. \n\nThis implies that the initial array was 4,0,3. \n\nAfter 4 type1 operations on i=3, the first three elements are reduced by 4 each. \n\n4-4=0, 0-4 =-4, 3-4 =-1 \u2192 but the sample says it's 6,0,3. \n\nThis is impossible unless the type3 operations were applied first. \n\nAh! Perhaps the type3 operations are applied first. \n\nSuppose they first applied x type3 operations. \n\nThen, the initial a_i is increased by x. \n\nThen, the type1 and type2 operations are applied. \n\nThe total steps are x (type3) + type1 + type2. \n\nThe sample explanation's first step: \n\nAfter applying 4 type1 on i=3, the array becomes 6,0,3. \n\nThis suggests that the initial a_i plus x minus the type1 operations equals the new array. \n\nLet me see: \n\nSuppose they applied x type3 operations first. \n\nThen the initial a_i becomes 4+x, 0+x, 3+x. \n\nThen applying 4 type1 on i=3:

note has a mistake, but I must proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the type3 operation is applied after the type1 and type2. \n\nWait the problem's note says that after applying the operations, the array becomes zero. \n\nThe sample explanation's steps: \n\n4 type1 on i=3 \u2192 first three elements reduced by 4 each. \n\n6 type1 on i=1 \u2192 first element reduced by 6. \n\n3 type2 on i=3 \u2192 third element reduced by 3. \n\nTotal decrease for first element:4+6=10 \n\nSecond:4 \n\nThird:4+3=7 \n\nThe original a_i are 4,0,3. \n\nThus, the total decrease must be a_i +x. \n\nTo reach zero: \n\n4 +x -10 =0 \u2192x=6 \n\n0 +x -4 =0 \u2192x=4 \n\n3 +x -7 =0 \u2192x=4 \n\nThis is impossible. \n\nThus, the only way this works is if the type3 operations are not used. \n\nBut then the array can't be zero. \n\nThis suggests that I must have misunderstood the problem's operations. \n\nPerhaps the type3 operation is applied first. \n\nSuppose they first apply x type3 operations. \n\nThen the a_i becomes a_i +x. \n\nThen apply the type1 and type2 operations. \n\nThe total steps are x + type1 + type2. \n\nThe final array is (a_i +x) - (type1 and type2 decreases) =0. \n\nThus, the type1 and type2 decreases must equal a_i +x. \n\nIn the sample explanation's steps: \n\nAfter applying 4 type1 on i=3, the array becomes 6,0,3. \n\nThis suggests that the initial a_i plus x minus the type1 operations equals the new array. \n\nSuppose the initial a_i is 4,0,3. \n\nAfter x type3 operations, it becomes 4+x,0+x,3+x. \n\nThen applying 4 type1 on i=3: \n\nEach reduces first 3 elements by 1 \u2192 total reduction of 4 per element. \n\nThus, the new values are: \n\n4+x-4 =0+x \u21920+x \n\n0+x-4 \u2192-4+x \n\n3+x-4 \u2192-1+x \n\nThe sample says this results in 6,0,3.

perhaps the type1 and type2 operations are applied in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the type1 operation is applied to the suffix. \n\nNo, the problem says type1 is prefix. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the type2 operation is applied to the prefix. \n\nNo, the problem says type2 is suffix. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following approach for program2.py: \n\nThe minimal steps can be computed as follows: \n\nThe minimal steps is the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach is correct: \n\nThe minimal steps is the sum of all a_i plus the maximum between the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample
