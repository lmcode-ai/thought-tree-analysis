The problem is about connecting three points with minimal total length of axis-aligned segments. The code provided has some missing parts, especially in the else block where the 'd1*d2 <0' condition is met. \n\nLooking at the code structure, the first part sorts the points, then checks if the middle point is between the first and third in the y-coordinate. If so, they build the path by moving vertically and horizontally. But when the else case (d1*d2 <0) happens, it's when the middle point isn't between the others. The code then checks another condition involving d1 and d2 again. Wait, maybe I need to retrace the logic here.\n\nWait, in the first if block, after sorting the points by x-coordinate (since t is sorted, so a is the leftmost, then b, then c). The code checks if the y-coordinates of b is between a and c. If yes, then they can connect via a vertical then horizontal then vertical path. But if not, then they need an extra point X. \n\nThe else part has two subcases. The first subcase is when the third point is between the first and second in y-coordinate. The second subcase is when the first is between the second and third. Wait, the code's comments mention \"1st between 2nd and 3rd\" perhaps? Let me look again.\n\nIn the else block (the case where the middle point isn't between the first and third in y), the code checks d1 = b[1]-c[1], d2 = c[1]-a[1]. If their product is >=0, then the third is between first and second. Then they set x as [b[0], c[1]]. Then they build the path from a to x, then to c, and also to b. \n\nThe other case (else) is when the first is between the second and third. The code sets x as [b[0], a[1]]. Then they start adding segments. The first part is if c's x is different from x's x (so moving horizontally from c to x's x at c's y?), then append that. Then, the next line is a comment: if c's y isn't equal to x's y, then there's a missing code. The next lines add segments from x to a and x to b. \n\nWait, the code in the else block (the first else after the initial if d1*d2 >=0) has three cases. The first case is when the middle point is between first and third (so the first if). The second case is when third is between first and second (the first else if). The third case is when first is between second and third (the else of that). \n\nIn the third case, the code is trying to create a point x at (b's x, a's y). Then, the first step is moving from c to x's x (so horizontal from c's position to x's x coordinate, same y as c). Then, if c's y isn't equal to x's y (a's y), then we need to move vertically from there. Wait, the code has a line: \n\nif c[1] != x[1]:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo here, after moving horizontally to x's x (same y as c's y?), then we need to go vertically to x's y (a's y). So the missing code here would be adding a vertical segment from (x[0], c[1]) to (x[0], x[1]). \n\nSo the code should be something like:\n\nresult.append([x[0], c[1], x[0], x[1]])\n\nThen, after that, the next lines add the segments from x to a and x to b. \n\nSo the missing part is that line. \n\nSo for program1, the missing code is:\n\nresult.append([x[0], c[1], x[0], x[1]])\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of s after optimally choosing the permutation a. The code provided is using some dynamic programming approach. The variables depth and best are being updated. The loop is going from n-1 down to 0. \n\nThe code's current state has a for loop over i from n-1 down to 0. For each i, best[i] is set to the max between its current value and depth[i]. Then, if i is not 0, there's a TODO. \n\nThe problem's note suggests that the optimal strategy involves choosing the permutation such that the numbers propagate upwards in a way that allows the longest non-decreasing subsequence. The key insight here is that each node's contribution to the subsequence depends on the path from the root (card 1) to the leaves. \n\nThe approach in the code might be tracking the maximum depth of the subtree or something similar. The 'depth' array might represent the depth of each node, and 'best' could be the maximum possible contribution from that subtree. \n\nLooking at the code, the 'depth' array is initialized to 1. Then, for each i in reverse, perhaps the depth is being updated based on the parent. Wait, the code's first line after the for loop is best[i] = max(best[i], depth[i]). Then, if i is not 0, there's a missing part. \n\nWait, the 'depth' array might represent the maximum path length in the subtree. For each node i, its depth is 1 plus the maximum depth of its children. Because each node except the root has a parent (p_i). So the children of a node are all nodes j where p_j = i. \n\nTherefore, the depth[i] should be 1 + max(depth[j] for all children j of i). \n\nBut in the code, the depth array is initialized to 1. The loop is going from n-1 down to 0. So for each i, we need to process its parent. Wait, perhaps the code is traversing the nodes in reverse order (from last to first), and for each node, we check its parent and update the parent's best and depth. \n\nAlternatively, the 'depth' array might represent the number of descendants, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 'best' array might track the maximum possible contribution of the subtree rooted at i. \n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    best[i] = max(best[i], depth[i])\n    if i !=0:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe idea is that for each node i, after computing its best, we need to propagate this to its parent. \n\nSuppose that the parent of i is p_i (since p_i is given for i>1, but for i=0 (card 1), it has no parent). \n\nSo for each node i (except root), we can update the parent's best and depth. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'depth' array is the maximum length of the path from the node to a leaf in its subtree. Then, the best[i] would be the maximum between its own depth and the best of its children. \n\nAlternatively, the 'best' array could be the maximum possible value for the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the subtree. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that when a node is removed, its parent's number is updated if it's larger than the node's. So the optimal permutation a should be arranged such that the numbers form a structure where each parent's number is as small as possible, allowing the subsequence to be as long as possible. \n\nThe key insight here is that the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is equal to the number of nodes in the longest chain from a leaf to the root where each step's number is non-decreasing. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible length is the maximum depth of the tree's structure when considering the permutation. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled by considering that each node contributes 1 to the subsequence, but the order in which they are added can be arranged such that the sequence s can have a non-decreasing subsequence as long as the maximum number of nodes in a chain where each node's value is <= the next. \n\nThe optimal permutation a would be to assign numbers in such a way that each node's number is as small as possible compared to its children. \n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to model this as the maximum number of nodes in a path from a leaf to the root where each step's number is non-decreasing. To maximize this, the permutation a should be arranged so that each such path can be as long as possible. \n\nAlternatively, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of nodes in a chain where each node is an ancestor of the next, and the numbers are non-decreasing. The optimal arrangement would be to set the numbers in such a way that each such chain can be as long as possible. \n\nThe maximum possible length is the maximum number of nodes in any path from a leaf to the root. Because, by setting the numbers in increasing order along that path, the subsequence can include all nodes in that path. \n\nWait, but the path must be such that each node's number is <= the next. So the maximum possible length is the length of the longest path from any leaf to the root. \n\nWait, the longest path from a leaf to the root is the tree's height. So the answer is the maximum depth of any node. \n\nWait, but the example given in the problem's note has n=6. The structure is such that the longest path from a leaf (like 5 or 6) to the root (1) is 4 steps (like 5\u21924\u21922\u21921, but maybe the depth is 4). The answer in the example is 4, which matches that. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum depth of the tree. \n\nWait, but how is the depth computed here? Let me think again. \n\nEach node's depth is the length of the path from the root to the node. So the maximum depth among all nodes would be the height of the tree. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the tree structure is such that the root is 1, and the other nodes are connected in a way that the longest path is 4 (like 1-2-3-4-5). But the example's answer is 4, which matches the height. \n\nSo the solution is to compute the maximum depth of the tree. \n\nTherefore, the code should compute the depth of each node (distance from root) and take the maximum. \n\nBut in the code provided, the 'depth' array is initialized to 1. Then, for each node i in reverse order (from n-1 downto 0), perhaps the code is trying to compute the depth. \n\nWait, the nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1 (since a is converted to 0-based). The parent array is given as p_2 to p_n, so for node i (starting from 1?), but in the code, the input is read as a list of n-1 elements (since the first line is n, then the next line has n-1 numbers for p_2 to p_n). \n\nWait, in the code, the nodes are 0-based. So node 0 is the root (card 1). The other nodes (1-based in the problem) are 1 to n-1 in code. \n\nThe parent array a is stored as a list where a[i] is the parent of node (i+1) (since the input is p_2, p_3, ..., p_n, so for node 1 (code's index 1) corresponds to the second card, which has p_2 as its parent). \n\nWait, the code's first line after input is:\n\na = [int(x)-1 for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n\nSo for the input line of p_2 to p_n, each p_i is converted to 0-based. So for node i (from 1 to n-1 in code's indices), a[i-1] is the parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's a list is for nodes 1 to n-1 (since the input has n-1 elements). So for node i (0-based in code's numbering), except 0, the parent is a[i-1]. \n\nWait, maybe the code's a is for nodes 1 to n-1 (since the first element is p_2, which is the parent of node 2 (code's index 1?), but this is getting a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's a is stored as a list where a[i] is the parent of node (i+1). \n\nBut regardless, the depth array needs to be computed as the distance from the root. \n\nThe code's current approach is:\n\ndepth is initialized to 1 for all nodes. \n\nThen, for each i from n-1 down to 0:\n\nbest[i] = max(best[i], depth[i])\n\nThen, if i is not 0 (so not the root), then we need to update the parent's depth and best. \n\nAh, perhaps the depth[i] is the depth of node i. So for each node i, its depth is 1 (itself) plus the depth of its parent. Wait no, that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the depth is computed as the maximum depth of its children plus one. \n\nWait, the code is processing nodes in reverse order (from last to first). For each node i, after computing its depth, we can update its parent's depth. \n\nWait, the code's depth array is initialized to 1. Then, for each node i (starting from the last node), the parent of i is p_i (but in code's terms, perhaps a[i] is the parent). \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose for node i (0-based), except the root (0), its parent is a[i]. \n\nWait, the code's a is the list of p_2 to p_n, converted to 0-based. So for node 1 (the second card in the problem), its parent is a[0], which is p_2-1. \n\nSo for each node i (from 1 to n-1), its parent is a[i-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's a is stored as a list where a[i] is the parent of node (i+1). \n\nWait, the code's a is created by taking the input line (n-1 numbers) and converting each to 0-based. So for the second card (problem's card 2), which is code's index 1, its parent is p_2 (problem's input) minus 1. \n\nSo for node i (code's index), its parent is a[i-1] when i >=1. \n\nSo for each node i (starting from the end), the code is trying to compute the depth. \n\nThe depth array is initialized to 1. \n\nThen, for each i in reverse order (from n-1 downto 0):\n\n- best[i] is set to the max between its current value and depth[i]. \n\n- if i is not 0 (so it has a parent), then we need to update the parent's depth and best. \n\nThe missing code here is probably:\n\nparent = a[i-1] (if i is not 0, but wait, for i=0, it's the root, so no parent. So for i from 1 to n-1, the parent is a[i-1]. \n\nWait, for i in the loop, when i is not 0, then the parent is a[i-1]. \n\nSo the code should do:\n\nparent = a[i-1]\n\ndepth[parent] = max(depth[parent], depth[i] + 1)\n\nbest[parent] = max(best[parent], best[i] + 1)\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the depth of the parent should be the maximum between its current depth and (child's depth +1). \n\nWait, the depth of a node is 1 plus the depth of its parent. So the depth should be computed as the depth of the parent plus 1. But since we are processing nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root), perhaps the depth is being computed correctly. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose node 3 has parent 2, which has parent 1 (root). \n\nProcessing node 3 first (i=3). Its depth is 1. Then, its parent (2) would have its depth set to max(1, 1+1) = 2. \n\nThen when processing node 2, its depth is 2. Its parent (1) would have depth set to max(1, 2+1)=3. \n\nThen processing node 1 (the root's parent is none). \n\nWait, but the root's depth is initialized to 1. \n\nSo the maximum depth would be 3. \n\nBut in this case, the depth of node 3 is 3 (root (1) \u2192 2 \u21923). \n\nHmm, perhaps the depth array is storing the depth of each node. \n\nSo the code's current approach is:\n\nfor each node i in reverse order (starting from the last node), the depth[i] is initially 1. \n\nThen, for each node i, after computing its depth, we check its parent and update the parent's depth to be the maximum between its current depth and (child's depth +1). \n\nWait, but the code's depth array is initialized to 1. So for node i, its depth is 1, but if its parent's depth is already higher, then the parent's depth would be kept. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the depth as the maximum depth of the subtree rooted at each node. \n\nAlternatively, the depth array represents the maximum depth of the subtree rooted at node i. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the depth as the maximum depth of the subtree. \n\nIn that case, for each node i, its depth is 1 plus the maximum depth of its children. \n\nProcessing nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root) allows this. \n\nSo for each node i, after processing all its children (which have higher indices?), the depth[i] is 1 plus the maximum depth of its children. \n\nWait, but how do we track the children? \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is that for each node i, when we process it, we look at its parent and update the parent's depth. \n\nWait, the code's missing part is probably:\n\nparent = a[i-1]\n\ndepth[parent] = max(depth[parent], depth[i] + 1)\n\nbest[parent] = max(best[parent], best[i] + 1)\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 'best' array is tracking the maximum possible contribution from the subtree. \n\nThe problem's solution requires the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. \n\nThe key idea is that each node can contribute 1 to the subsequence if its number is chosen optimally. The maximum possible length is the maximum number of nodes in a chain from a leaf to the root where each step's number is non-decreasing. \n\nTo maximize this, the numbers should be arranged so that along such a path, the numbers are increasing. The longest such path is the longest path from any leaf to the root. \n\nThus, the answer is the length of the longest path from any leaf to the root, which is the maximum depth of any node. \n\nTherefore, the code should compute the maximum depth of all nodes. \n\nThe depth array in the code is initialized to 1. \n\nFor each node i (starting from the end), the depth of its parent is updated to be the maximum between its current value and (depth[i] +1). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose node i has a parent p. \n\nThe depth of p is the maximum between its current depth and (depth[i] +1). \n\nWait, but the depth of p is the depth of its parent plus 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the depth array is storing the depth of each node. \n\nInitially, all are 1. \n\nProcessing node i (leaf first):\n\nSuppose node i's parent is p. \n\nThe depth of node i is 1 (its own depth). \n\nThe parent p's depth should be 1 (its own) plus the depth of its children. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's depth array is storing the depth of each node. \n\nWait, the depth of a node is 1 + the depth of its parent. \n\nSo for the root (depth 1), its children have depth 2, etc. \n\nThus, to compute the depth of each node, we can process nodes in order from root to leaves, but since the parent pointers are given, it's easier to process in reverse. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the code is processing nodes in reverse order (from n-1 downto 0). For each node i, its depth is 1 (initial value). Then, the parent's depth is set to the maximum between its current depth and (child's depth +1). \n\nWait, that would be incorrect. Because the parent's depth is 1 + the parent's parent's depth. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's depth array is storing the depth of each node. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5. \n\nNodes are 0 (root), 1 (parent 0), 2 (parent 1), 3 (parent 2), 4 (parent 3). \n\nProcessing node 4 (i=4):\n\ndepth[4] is 1. \n\nparent is a[3] (since a is the list of p_2 to p_5. For node 4 (code's index 4, which is the fifth card in problem's terms?), the parent is p_5 which is 4 (assuming p_5 is 4). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's a array for node 4 (code's index 4) would have a[3] (since the input for p_5 is the 4th element in the input list). \n\nSo for node 4, parent is a[3]. \n\nThen, the parent's depth (node 3) is set to max(1, 1+1) = 2. \n\nThen, processing node 3 (i=3):\n\ndepth[3] is 1 (initial). \n\nparent is a[2], which is node 2. \n\nSo node 2's depth becomes max(1, 1+1)=2. \n\nWait, but node 3's depth should be 3 (since root is 0, depth 1; node 1 is 2, node 2 is 3, node 3 is 4, node4 is 5). \n\nHmm, this approach isn't working. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the depth array is storing the maximum depth of the subtree rooted at each node. \n\nWait, the subtree rooted at node i includes all descendants. The maximum depth of the subtree would be 1 plus the maximum depth of its children. \n\nProcessing nodes in reverse order (children first), so when processing node i, all its children have already been processed. \n\nThus, for each node i, the depth[i] is 1 plus the maximum depth of its children. \n\nBut how to track the children? \n\nThe code's current approach is that for each node i, after computing its depth, we update the parent's depth. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's depth array is storing the maximum depth of the subtree. \n\nSo for node i, its depth is 1 (itself) plus the maximum depth of its children. \n\nThus, when processing node i, we can look at its parent and update the parent's depth. \n\nWait, but the parent's depth is the maximum between its current value and (child's depth +1). \n\nWait, no. The parent's subtree depth would be 1 plus the maximum of its children's subtree depths. \n\nSo for each child of the parent, the parent's depth is the max between its current value and (child's depth +1). \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nparent = a[i-1] (since for node i (>=1), its parent is a[i-1])\n\ndepth[parent] = max(depth[parent], depth[i] + 1)\n\nbest[parent] = max(best[parent], best[i] + 1)\n\nWait, but the 'best' array is being set to the max between best[i] and depth[i]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'best' array is tracking the maximum possible contribution from the subtree. \n\nAlternatively, the 'best' array is storing the maximum length of the non-decreasing subsequence for the subtree rooted at i. \n\nIn that case, when processing a node i, the best[i] is the maximum between its own depth (the path from itself to a leaf) and the best of its children. \n\nWait, but the code's first line is best[i] = max(best[i], depth[i]). \n\nSo initially, best[i] is 0, so after this line, it becomes depth[i]. \n\nThen, when processing the parent, the parent's best is updated to be the maximum between its current best and (best[i] + 1?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the best array is storing the maximum possible length of the non-decreasing subsequence in the subtree. \n\nThe optimal way is to choose the path that allows the longest chain. \n\nThus, for each node, the best is the maximum between its own depth (the path from itself to a leaf) and the best of its children. \n\nWait, but the code's current approach is that best[i] is set to max(best[i], depth[i]). \n\nThen, when processing the parent, we need to propagate the best value. \n\nThe missing code is probably:\n\nparent = a[i-1]\n\nbest[parent] = max(best[parent], best[i] + 1)\n\nWait, but why +1? \n\nAlternatively, the best of the parent can be the maximum between its current best and the best of the child plus 1 (if the parent's number is <= the child's). \n\nBut since the permutation can be chosen optimally, the best for the parent can be the best of the child plus 1. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nparent = a[i-1]\n\ndepth[parent] = max(depth[parent], depth[i] + 1)\n\nbest[parent] = max(best[parent], best[i] + 1)\n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the best[i] is initially set to max(best[i], depth[i]). \n\nSo for a leaf node (no children), best[i] is depth[i] (which is 1). \n\nThen, when processing its parent, the parent's best would be max(its current best (initially 0?), or best[i]+1 (1+1=2). \n\nWait, but the parent's depth is being updated to depth[i]+1 (so for a leaf, the parent's depth becomes 2). \n\nHmm, perhaps this is the correct approach. \n\nThus, the missing code in program2 is:\n\nparent = a[i-1]\n\ndepth[parent] = max(depth[parent], depth[i] + 1)\n\nbest[parent] = max(best[parent], best[i] + 1)\n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nparent = a[i-1]\n\ndepth[parent] = max(depth[parent], depth[i] + 1)\n\nbest[parent] = max(best[parent], best[i] + 1)\n\nNow, moving to program3.py. The problem is to count the number of trees where each node i (except root) has exactly one parent with a smaller index, and the i-th node is the centroid. \n\nThe code provided has some parts missing, especially in the inv function. \n\nThe code starts by defining modmul and inv functions. The inv function is supposed to compute the modular inverse of x modulo 998244353. \n\nThe current code for inv is a TODO. \n\nThe rest of the code uses combinatorial functions (comb, invcomb, invs) to compute the answer. \n\nThe problem requires that for each node i, compute the number of trees where i is the centroid. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be using some combinatorial formulas. \n\nThe inv function is needed to compute the modular inverse. \n\nThe standard way to compute the inverse modulo a prime (since 998244353 is a prime) is using Fermat's little theorem. The inverse of x mod MOD is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD. \n\nThus, the inv function can be implemented as:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nSo that's the missing code for program3's inv function. \n\nThe rest of the code may have other issues, but the problem states that the code is to be completed with the missing parts. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is the inv function's implementation. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor program1, the missing code is the line in the else block's else clause, adding the vertical segment from (x[0], c[1]) to (x[0], x[1]). \n\nFor program2, the missing code is the three lines updating the parent's depth and best. \n\nFor program3, the missing code is the inv function's implementation using pow. \n\nNow, let's structure the answers as per the required JSON format."
