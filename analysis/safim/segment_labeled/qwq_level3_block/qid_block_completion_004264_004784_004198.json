Wait, perhaps the problem is that the required terms for some i may be higher than the required terms for i+1. Wait, for example, suppose that S_i / t is higher than S_{i+1}/t. Wait, let's see. Suppose S_i is 10, S_{i+1} is 12, and t is 3. Then ceil(10/3)=4, ceil(12/3)=4. So the maximum is 4. But for i+1, the required is 4. But if the sum up to i is 4, then the sum up to i+1 must be at least 4. So that's okay. Another example: suppose S_i is 5, S_{i+1} is 4, and t is 3. Wait, but S_{i+1} can't be less than S_i. Because S_{i+1} = S_i + v_{i+1}, and v_{i+1} is at least 1. Ah right, because v_i are given as 1<=v_i. So S_i is strictly increasing. Therefore, the required terms (ceil(S_i/t)) are non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum is the last term, ceil(S_n/t). Wait, because S_i is increasing, so S_i/t is increasing, so ceil(S_i/t) is non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum is ceil(S_n/t). Wait, that's a key insight! Because S_i is strictly increasing, the required terms ceil(S_i/t) are non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum is the last term, ceil(S_n/t). Therefore, the minimal number of pipes is exactly ceil(S_n / t_j). Wait, but that can't be right. Because in the first example's note, the first query's answer is -1. Let me think of an example where this would be the case. Suppose n=1, v_1=5, t_j=3. Then S_n is 5. ceil(5/3)=2. So the minimal pipes is 2. But according to the problem's first example's note, in some cases it's impossible. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-read the problem statement. Ah!",

But the way the water flows may require that the constraints for each i are met. Wait, the constraints are that for each i, the sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j > = S_i. Because the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of x_j * t_j (since each pipe is open for t_j seconds) minus the sum of v_1 to v_{i-1} (since those locks can only hold their v_i, so the excess flows to the next). Wait, the total water in lock i is (sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j) - (sum_{k=1}^{i-1} v_k). This must be >= v_i. Rearranged: sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j > = sum_{k=1}^i v_k. So the constraints are exactly that for each i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j >= ceil(S_i / t_j). But since S_i is increasing, the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) is ceil(S_n/t_j). Therefore, the minimal sum of x_j is exactly ceil(S_n/t_j). Wait, but then why in the first example's note, some queries are impossible? Ah! Because if the required sum (ceil(S_n/t_j)) multiplied by t_j is less than S_n, then it's impossible. Wait, no. Because ceil(S_n/t_j) is the minimal integer such that ceil(S_n/t_j)*t_j >= S_n. Therefore, the minimal sum is exactly ceil(S_n/t_j), and that ensures that all constraints are satisfied. Wait, but then why in the first example's note, the first query (probably with t_j=3) gives -1? Hmm, perhaps I need to look at the problem's first example's note again.

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about finding the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled within t_j seconds. The code provided has some parts missing. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe first part initializes n, then reads the v array. Then there's a loop over each i and v in the input. The TODO is there. The next part handles queries: for each t, it checks if t is >= m, then computes (p + t -1)//t, else -1. \n\nHmm, the variables p and m are initialized to 0. The loop over the v array must compute some values. The variable m is probably the minimal time required, and p is some cumulative value. Wait, in the output line, when t >= m, the answer is (p + t -1)//t. That formula looks like ceiling(p / t). But why?\n\nWait, the problem requires that all locks are filled within t_j seconds. The minimal number of pipes needed would be determined by the constraints on each lock. Let me think: each pipe adds 1 liter per second. The total water added after t seconds is (number of pipes) * t. But the water flows through the locks. Each lock i must have at least v_i liters, but the water can overflow to the next. \n\nThe key is to model the required minimum number of pipes such that after t seconds, the total water in each lock is at least v_i. The way the water flows is that any excess from lock i goes to i+1. So the critical point is that for each lock i, the total water that reaches it (from its own pipes plus the overflow from previous locks) must be at least v_i. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of pipes required is determined by the constraints on each position. Let me think of it as for each position i, the number of pipes opened up to i (i.e., the sum of pipes opened at positions 1..i) must be such that after t seconds, the total water in i is at least v_i. But how exactly?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model the required minimum number of pipes as follows: For each lock i, the minimal number of pipes that must be opened before or at i to ensure that by time t, the lock i is filled. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering that each lock i must receive at least v_i liters. The water comes from the pipes opened at positions 1 to i. Because any water that flows into i from previous locks can only help, but the critical constraint is that the total water from the pipes opened at positions 1..i must be enough to cover v_i plus any overflow that might be needed for the next locks. Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of pipes required is determined by the maximum over all i of ceil( (v_i - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (pipes_j) * t) ) / t ), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled by considering that for each position i, the total water that reaches it is the sum of the pipes opened at positions 1..i multiplied by t, minus the sum of the v_j for j < i. Wait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the key idea is that the minimal number of pipes required is the minimal k such that for all i, the sum of the pipes opened up to i multiplied by t must be at least the cumulative required up to i. \n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: Let\u2019s denote the number of pipes opened at position i as x_i. The total water after t seconds is x_i * t for each pipe. But the water flows through the system. The total water in lock i is the sum of all x_j for j \u2264 i multiplied by t minus the sum of v_1 to v_{i-1} (since any excess from previous locks flows to the next). Wait, perhaps not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of all x_j (for j \u2264 i) multiplied by t, minus the sum of v_1 to v_{i-1}. Because each previous lock can only hold up to v_j, so any excess beyond that flows to the next. So for lock i to be filled, the total water that reaches it must be at least v_i. \n\nWait, let me think step by step. Let's consider the first lock. The total water in it after t seconds is x_1 * t. To have it filled, this must be at least v_1. So x_1 * t >= v_1. \n\nThe second lock: the total water that reaches it is (x_1 + x_2)*t minus the v_1 (since the first lock can only hold v_1, so the excess (x_1*t - v_1) flows to the second). So the total in the second lock is (x_1 + x_2)*t - v_1. This must be >= v_2. \n\nSimilarly, for the third lock, the total water is (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)*t - (v_1 + v_2) >= v_3. \n\nContinuing this way, for the i-th lock, the total water is (sum_{j=1}^i x_j)*t - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} v_j >= v_i. \n\nRearranging this inequality for each i:\n\nsum_{j=1}^i x_j * t >= sum_{j=1}^i v_j \n\nSo for all i from 1 to n, the sum of x_j up to i multiplied by t must be at least the sum of v_j up to i. \n\nTherefore, the minimal total x (sum x_j) is the minimal k such that for all i, (sum_{j=1}^i x_j) * t >= sum_{j=1}^i v_j. \n\nBut since we want to minimize the total number of pipes (sum x_j), we can model this as follows: \n\nThe constraints are for each i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j >= (sum_{j=1}^i v_j)/t \n\nBut since x_j are non-negative integers, the minimal sum x_j is the maximum over all i of ceil( (sum_{1..i} v_j) / t ). \n\nWait, because the sum x_j up to i must be at least the ceiling of (sum_v_i)/t. \n\nWait, the minimal possible sum x_1 + ... +x_i is the ceiling of (sum_v_i)/t. But since the x's are cumulative, the minimal total x is the maximum of these ceilings for all i. \n\nWait, because for each i, the sum up to i must be at least ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ), but also, the sum up to i must be at least the sum up to i-1. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let S_i = sum_{j=1}^i v_j. \n\nThen for each i, the sum of x_1 to x_i must be >= ceil(S_i / t). \n\nBut the sum up to i must also be at least the sum up to i-1. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible sum x_1 + ... +x_i is the maximum between the previous sum and ceil(S_i/t). \n\nTherefore, the minimal total x is the maximum over all i of ceil(S_i / t). \n\nAh! So the minimal number of pipes required is the maximum of ceil(S_i / t) for all i from 1 to n. \n\nTherefore, for each query t_j, the answer is the maximum of ceil(S_i / t_j) for all i, provided that the total sum S_n <= t_j * (max_val). Wait, no. Wait, the total sum S_n must be <= t_j * (max_val), but actually, the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) must be such that the sum x_j must be at least the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j). \n\nWait, but the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) over all i is exactly the minimal required sum of x_j. Because for each i, the sum up to i must be at least ceil(S_i/t_j). The maximum of these values across all i will ensure that all previous constraints are satisfied. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum of ceil(S_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nBut if the total required sum (the maximum) multiplied by t_j must be at least S_n. Wait, no. Because the maximum is already the maximum of all the ceil(S_i/t_j). So the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). So the total sum x must be at least ceil(S_n/t_j). \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum over all i of ceil(S_i / t_j). \n\nBut if the total S_n > t_j * (max_val), then it's impossible. Wait, no. Because the maximum is ceil(S_i/t_j) for each i. The maximum for i =n is ceil(S_n/t_j). So if S_n > t_j * (max_val), then that would require that the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). But if t_j is less than S_n / (max_val), then it's impossible. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum must be at least ceil(S_n/t_j). So if t_j is less than S_n divided by the maximum, then it's impossible. Wait, perhaps the condition is that the maximum must be at least ceil(S_n/t_j). But if t_j is less than S_n divided by the maximum, then it's impossible. \n\nWait, actually, the problem says that all locks must be filled no later than t_j seconds. So the total required is that the sum of x_j must be at least the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) for all i. \n\nBut if the maximum is such that the maximum * t_j >= S_n, then it's okay. Wait, the maximum is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) for all i. So the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). Therefore, the maximum * t_j >= S_n. So the condition for possibility is that the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). But since the maximum is the maximum over all i, including i =n, then the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). Therefore, the only condition for possibility is that the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). But that's always true. Wait, no. Wait, if t_j is less than S_n, then ceil(S_n/t_j) would be greater than S_n/t_j. But if t_j is less than S_n, then it's impossible. Because even if you open all possible pipes, the total water after t_j seconds is (sum x_j)*t_j. The minimal sum x_j is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j). But the maximum for i =n is ceil(S_n/t_j). So the total required is that sum x_j must be at least ceil(S_n/t_j). But the total water would be sum x_j * t_j >= ceil(S_n/t_j)*t_j >= S_n. So that's okay. Wait, but if t_j is less than S_n, then ceil(S_n/t_j) is at least 1, but the required sum x_j would be that. But the total water would be sum x_j * t_j >= S_n. So it's possible. Wait, but the problem says that if it's impossible, output -1. \n\nWait, when is it impossible? Let me think. Suppose that even if you open all possible pipes (i.e., open a pipe at every lock), then the total water after t_j seconds is n * t_j. If n * t_j < S_n, then it's impossible. Because even with all pipes open, you can't get enough water. \n\nAh! So the condition for possibility is that the total required sum x_j (the maximum) must satisfy sum x_j * t_j >= S_n. But the maximum is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) for all i. So the maximum * t_j must be >= S_n. \n\nWait, but the maximum is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) for all i. The maximum for i =n is ceil(S_n/t_j). So the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). Therefore, maximum * t_j >= ceil(S_n/t_j)*t_j >= S_n. So it's always possible? No, because ceil(S_n/t_j) is the minimal x such that x*t_j >= S_n. So if the maximum is at least that, then yes. \n\nWait, but the maximum is the maximum over all i of ceil(S_i/t_j). So the maximum is at least ceil(S_n/t_j). Therefore, the maximum * t_j is at least S_n. So it's always possible as long as the maximum is defined. Wait, but if t_j is less than S_n, then the maximum would be ceil(S_n/t_j), which requires that the total x_j is at least that. But the total x_j can be that, so it's possible. \n\nWait, but the problem says that in some cases it's impossible. For example, in the first example's first query, the answer is -1. Let me check the first example's note. \n\nThe first example's first query is when t_j is 3. The note says that in queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says that the initial state is all locks empty and all pipes closed. Then, some pipes are opened simultaneously. The water flows as per the rules. After exactly t_j seconds, all locks must be filled. \n\nWait, the key point is that the total water after t_j seconds must be exactly the sum of all v_i. Because each lock must be filled to exactly v_i. Wait, no. The problem says \"filled no later than after t_j seconds\". So after t_j seconds, each lock must have at least v_i liters. But the total water is sum x_j * t_j. Because each pipe adds 1 per second, so each x_j is the number of pipes opened at position j. \n\nWait, the total water after t_j seconds is exactly (sum x_j) * t_j. Because each pipe contributes t_j liters. \n\nThe total required is that the sum of all v_i must be <= (sum x_j)*t_j. \n\nBut also, for each i, the sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j must be >= sum_{k=1}^i v_k. \n\nWait, that's the key. Because the first i locks must have received enough water so that after distributing, each of them is filled. \n\nSo the constraints are for all i: sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j >= sum_{k=1}^i v_k. \n\nThe minimal sum x_j is the minimal value such that for all i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j >= ceil( (sum_{k=1}^i v_k)/t_j ). \n\nWait, but the minimal sum is the maximum of ceil( (sum_{k=1}^i v_k)/t_j ) for all i. \n\nWait, because the sum up to i must be at least that value, and the sum up to i+1 must be at least the value for i+1. So the minimal possible is the maximum of all those ceil terms. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum over all i of ceil( S_i / t_j ), where S_i is the prefix sum up to i. \n\nBut the problem requires that the total sum of x_j must be at least the maximum of these terms. \n\nHowever, the total sum of x_j must also satisfy that the sum x_j * t_j >= S_n (the total required). \n\nWait, but the maximum of the ceil(S_i/t_j) terms for all i includes the term for i =n, which is ceil(S_n/t_j). So the maximum is at least that. Therefore, the total sum x_j (the maximum) multiplied by t_j is at least S_n. \n\nTherefore, the only case when it's impossible is when even the maximum possible (when all pipes are opened) can't reach the required. Wait, but the maximum possible is when all pipes are opened. The maximum possible sum x_j is n (if you open one pipe at each lock). Then the total water is n * t_j. \n\nSo if n * t_j < S_n, then even with all pipes open, it's impossible. \n\nWait, but according to the constraints, the minimal required is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j). So if that maximum is such that the maximum * t_j >= S_n, then it's possible. \n\nWait, but the maximum is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) for all i. The maximum for i =n is ceil(S_n/t_j). So the maximum is at least that. Therefore, the maximum * t_j is at least S_n. \n\nTherefore, the only case when it's impossible is when even the minimal required (the maximum) is not possible? No, that can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose n=1, v_1 =5, and t_j=3. \n\nThen S_1 =5. The required is ceil(5/3)=2. So the minimal x is 2. The total water is 2*3=6 >=5. So possible. \n\nBut according to the problem's first example's note, in some cases it's impossible. \n\nWait, the first example's note says that in the first query (t_j=3), the answer is -1. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem's first example. \n\nWait the problem's first example's note says that in the first query (probably t_j=3?), the answer is -1. \n\nWait, perhaps the example is different. Let me think of the first example's first test case. \n\nWait the problem's first example's note says that in the first test case, there are 6 queries. For queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. \n\nSuppose the first test case has n=3, and v = [2, 3, 4]. \n\nWait, let's see. Let's say for t_j=3. \n\nThe S_i are 2, 5, 9. \n\nThe required for each i: \n\nceil(2/3) =1 \n\nceil(5/3)=2 \n\nceil(9/3)=3 \n\nThe maximum is 3. So the minimal pipes is 3. \n\n3*3=9 >=9. So possible. So why would the answer be -1? \n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait the problem says that the locks must be filled no later than t_j seconds. So after exactly t_j seconds, all must be filled. \n\nWait, but the way the water flows might require that the constraints are met. \n\nWait, perhaps the constraints are not just the sum up to i multiplied by t must be >= S_i, but also that the sum up to i must be at least the sum up to i-1. \n\nWait, the minimal x_j's must form a non-decreasing sequence? Because the sum up to i must be at least the sum up to i-1. \n\nWait, the x_j's can be any non-negative integers, but the sum up to i must be at least the required value for i. \n\nWait, the minimal sum is the maximum of the required terms. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the required terms for some i may be higher than the required terms for i+1. \n\nWait, for example, suppose that S_i / t is higher than S_{i+1}/t. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose S_i is 10, S_{i+1} is 12, and t is 3. \n\nThen ceil(10/3)=4, ceil(12/3)=4. So the maximum is 4. \n\nBut for i+1, the required is 4. \n\nBut if the sum up to i is 4, then the sum up to i+1 must be at least 4. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nAnother example: suppose S_i is 5, S_{i+1} is 4, and t is 3. \n\nWait, but S_{i+1} can't be less than S_i. Because S_{i+1} = S_i + v_{i+1}, and v_{i+1} is at least 1. \n\nAh right, because v_i are given as 1<=v_i. So S_i is strictly increasing. \n\nTherefore, the required terms (ceil(S_i/t)) are non-decreasing. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is the last term, ceil(S_n/t). \n\nWait, because S_i is increasing, so S_i/t is increasing, so ceil(S_i/t) is non-decreasing. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is ceil(S_n/t). \n\nWait, that's a key insight! \n\nBecause S_i is strictly increasing, the required terms ceil(S_i/t) are non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum is the last term, ceil(S_n/t). \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of pipes is exactly ceil(S_n / t_j). \n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because in the first example's note, the first query's answer is -1. Let me think of an example where this would be the case. \n\nSuppose n=1, v_1=5, t_j=3. \n\nThen S_n is 5. ceil(5/3)=2. So the minimal pipes is 2. \n\nBut according to the problem's first example's note, in some cases it's impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nAh! The problem says that the locks must be filled no later than t_j seconds. So after t_j seconds, each lock must have at least v_i. But the way the water flows may require that the constraints for each i are met. \n\nWait, the constraints are that for each i, the sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j >= S_i. \n\nBecause the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of x_j * t_j (since each pipe is open for t_j seconds) minus the sum of v_1 to v_{i-1} (since those locks can only hold their v_i, so the excess flows to the next). \n\nWait, the total water in lock i is (sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j) - (sum_{k=1}^{i-1} v_k). \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nRearranged: sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j >= sum_{k=1}^i v_k. \n\nSo the constraints are exactly that for each i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j >= ceil(S_i / t_j). \n\nBut since S_i is increasing, the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) is ceil(S_n/t_j). \n\nTherefore, the minimal sum of x_j is exactly ceil(S_n/t_j). \n\nWait, but then why in the first example's note, some queries are impossible? \n\nAh! Because if the required sum (ceil(S_n/t_j)) multiplied by t_j is less than S_n, then it's impossible. \n\nWait, no. Because ceil(S_n/t_j) is the minimal integer such that ceil(S_n/t_j)*t_j >= S_n. \n\nTherefore, the minimal sum is exactly ceil(S_n/t_j), and that ensures that all constraints are satisfied. \n\nWait, but then why in the first example's note, the first query (probably with t_j=3) gives -1? \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look at the problem's first example's note again. \n\nThe note says: \"In the first example test, there are 6 queries. In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes. In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3,4...\" \n\nWait, the first example's first query must have a t_j that is less than the minimal required time. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal required time is the maximum of (S_i) for all i. \n\nWait, the minimal time required is the minimal t such that the minimal number of pipes is 1. \n\nWait, the minimal possible time is the maximum S_i. Because if you open all pipes (so x_j =1 for all j), then the time needed is ceil(S_i / (sum x_j)). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible time is the maximum S_i. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example's first case. \n\nSuppose the first example's first case has n=3, and v = [2, 3, 4]. \n\nThen S_1=2, S_2=5, S_3=9. \n\nThe minimal time required (without any constraints) is the maximum of S_i. \n\nWait, the minimal time required is the maximum of S_i. Because if you open all pipes (x_j=1 for all j), then the time needed is the maximum S_i divided by the number of pipes. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible time is the maximum S_i. \n\nWait, for example, if you have to fill the first lock in time t, then t must be at least S_1. \n\nSimilarly, the second lock requires that the total water up to it is at least S_2, so the time must be at least S_2 divided by the number of pipes opened up to it. \n\nBut the minimal time required is the maximum of S_i. \n\nWait, if you open all pipes (x_j=1 for all j), then the time needed is the maximum S_i. \n\nBecause for each i, the required time is S_i / (sum_{j=1}^i x_j). \n\nTo minimize the time, you can choose x_j's such that for each i, the sum up to i is as large as possible. \n\nThe minimal possible time is the minimal t such that there exists x_j's with sum_{j=1}^i x_j >= S_i / t for all i. \n\nThe minimal t is the minimal t where the maximum of (S_i / x_i_sum) <= t. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible time is the maximum S_i. Because if you open only the first pipe, then the first lock takes S_1 time, but the second requires S_2 time, etc. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible time is the maximum of the S_i. \n\nBecause if you open all pipes, then the time needed is the maximum S_i divided by the number of pipes. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible time is the maximum S_i. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose you have n=1, v_1=5. The minimal time is 5 seconds (if you open one pipe). \n\nIf you open two pipes, then the time is 3 seconds (ceil(5/2)=3). \n\nSo the minimal possible time is 5 (when you have only one pipe). \n\nWait, but the minimal time is when you open as many pipes as possible. \n\nAh, the minimal possible time is the minimal t such that there exists x_j's with sum x_j * t >= S_n and for all i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t >= S_i. \n\nThe minimal possible t is the minimal t where the maximum of (S_i / x_i_sum) <= t. \n\nThe minimal t is the minimal t such that there exists x_j's with sum x_j * t >= S_n and for each i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t >= S_i. \n\nThe minimal possible t is the minimal t where the maximum of (ceil(S_i / x_i_sum)) <= t. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nBack to the problem's first example's note. \n\nThe note says that in the first query, the answer is -1. \n\nSuppose the first query's t_j is 3. \n\nThe minimal required pipes would be ceil(S_n / t_j). \n\nIf S_n is 9, then 9/3=3, so ceil(9/3)=3. So the answer is 3. \n\nBut the note says it's -1. \n\nHmm, so my previous reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's constraints. \n\nWait the problem says that the locks must be filled no later than t_j seconds. \n\nThe way the water flows is that any excess from lock i flows to i+1. \n\nSo the total water after t_j seconds is sum x_j * t_j. \n\nBut each lock i must have at least v_i. \n\nThe way the water flows is that the first lock gets x_1 * t_j water. \n\nIf that's more than v_1, the excess (x_1*t_j - v_1) flows to the second lock. \n\nThe second lock's total is x_2*t_j + (excess from first). \n\nSo the total in second lock is x_1*t_j +x_2*t_j - v_1. \n\nThis must be >= v_2. \n\nSo the total for second lock is (x_1 +x_2)*t_j - v_1 >= v_2 \n\n=> (x_1 +x_2)*t_j >= v_1 +v_2 \n\nSimilarly for third lock: \n\n(x_1 +x_2 +x_3)*t_j - (v_1 +v_2) >= v_3 \n\n=> (sum x_j up to 3)*t_j >= v_1 +v_2 +v_3 \n\nSo the constraints are exactly the same as before. \n\nThus, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum of ceil(S_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nBut in the first example's first query, the answer is -1. \n\nSo perhaps the problem requires that the total water after t_j seconds must be exactly the sum of v_i. \n\nWait, no. The problem says \"filled no later than after t_j seconds\". So after t_j seconds, each lock must have at least v_i. \n\nThe total water is sum x_j * t_j. \n\nThe total required is sum v_i <= sum x_j * t_j. \n\nBut the constraints for each i are sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t_j >= S_i. \n\nThe minimal sum x_j is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j). \n\nSo the only case when it's impossible is when even the maximum of ceil(S_i/t_j) multiplied by t_j is less than S_n. \n\nWait, but the maximum is ceil(S_n/t_j), so that can't happen. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting with the problem's note. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the time must be at least the maximum of the S_i. \n\nWait, for example, in the first example's first query, maybe the minimal required time is 4 seconds. \n\nSuppose the first lock has v_1=4. \n\nThen, to fill it in t_j seconds, you need x_1 * t_j >=4. \n\nIf t_j is 3, then x_1 must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6 >=4). \n\nBut then the total for the first lock is 6, which is more than v_1, so the excess flows to the next. \n\nBut the second lock's v_2 may require more. \n\nWait, perhaps the first example's first case has v_1=4, and the first query's t_j is 3. \n\nThen, the minimal required pipes would be ceil(4/3)=2 for the first lock. \n\nBut the second lock's S_2 is 4 + v_2. \n\nSuppose v_2 is 3, then S_2 is 7. \n\nThen ceil(7/3)=3. \n\nThe third lock's S_3 is 10, ceil(10/3)=4. \n\nThe maximum is 4. \n\nSo the minimal pipes is 4. \n\n4*3=12 >=10. \n\nSo it's possible. \n\nBut the note says that in the first query, the answer is -1. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait the problem's first example's note says that in the first query, the answer is -1 because \"we need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes\". \n\nAh! So the minimal time required to fill the first lock is 4 seconds. \n\nWait, if the first lock has v_1=4, then even if you open all pipes (x_1=1), then the time needed is 4 seconds. \n\nSo if the query's t_j is 3, then it's impossible. \n\nAh! So the minimal time required is the maximum of the S_i. \n\nBecause the first lock requires at least S_1 seconds if you open only one pipe. \n\nWait, the minimal time required is the maximum of the S_i. \n\nBecause if you open only one pipe (the first one), then the time needed is S_1. \n\nIf you open more pipes, you can reduce the time. \n\nThe minimal possible time is the minimal t such that there exists a set of pipes to open so that the constraints are met. \n\nThe minimal possible time is the minimal t where the maximum of (ceil(S_i / x_i_sum)) <= t. \n\nBut the minimal possible time is the maximum S_i. \n\nBecause if you open only the first pipe, then the time needed is S_1. \n\nIf you open more pipes, you can reduce the time. \n\nThe minimal possible time is the minimal t such that there exists x_j's with sum x_j * t >= S_n and for all i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j * t >= S_i. \n\nThe minimal possible time is the minimal t where the maximum of (S_i / (sum_{j=1}^i x_j)) <= t. \n\nTo minimize t, we can choose x_j's such that for each i, sum_{j=1}^i x_j is as large as possible. \n\nThe minimal possible time is the minimal t such that there exists x_j's with sum x_j * t >= S_n and
