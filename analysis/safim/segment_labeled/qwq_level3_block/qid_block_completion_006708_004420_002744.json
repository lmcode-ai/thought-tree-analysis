(n -m) is 4. \n\n4//2 =2 \u2192 which matches the required clones (2). Thus, the total would be (4) +2 \u21926. Another example where n=5, m=3 \u2192 (5-3)=2 \u2192 2//3=0 \u2192 total 2+0=2. Wait, but the required clones is (5+3-1)/3 \u2192 (7//3)=2 \u2192 clones_needed is 2-1=1. Thus, the formula (n-m)//m gives 0, but the correct clones_needed is 1. Thus, this approach is incorrect. Hmm, perhaps the code is supposed to compute r as (n - m) // m. \n\nWait, but in the first example, (6-2)/2 =2 \u2192 which is correct. In the second example (n=5, m=3), (5-3)/3 =0.666 \u2192 floor is 0. But the required clones is 1. Thus, this approach is incorrect. Alternatively, the code should compute r as (n - m + m -1) // m \u2192 (n-1)//m. Wait, (n-1)//m \u2192 (5-1)/3 =4/3=1 \u2192 which is correct. Thus, the required clones is (n-1)//m. Wait, let's see:\n\nclones_needed = (n-1) // m \n\nWait, for n=6, m=2 \u2192 (5)//2 =2 \u2192 correct. For n=5, m=3 \u21924//3=1 \u2192 correct. Yes! Thus, the required clones_needed is (n-1) // m. \n\nThus, the total is (n -m) + ( (n-1)//m ). Wait, let's test:\n\nExample 1: n=6, m=2 \u2192 (6-1)//2 =5//2=2 \u2192 total 4+2=6. Example 2: n=5, m=3 \u2192 (4//3)=1 \u2192 total 2+1=3. Another example where m=1 and n=5 \u2192 (5-1)//1 =4 \u2192 total (5-1)+4=8. Which would be correct: To have 5 copies (since 1*5=5), so clones needed 4. Swaps needed 4 (since n-m=4). Total 8. Yes. Thus, the formula is total = (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ). Thus, the code can compute this. Thus, the code's missing part is to compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ). Thus, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    arr = a.split()\n    n = len(arr) m = max(Counter(arr).values()) if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n    print(r) Thus, the missing code for program2 is to compute r as this value.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. I need to find the missing code parts for each so that when they're run in sequence through pipes, they work correctly. Let's start with program1.py.\n\nLooking at program1.py's problem: We need to determine if we can make all elements of an array equal by applying certain operations. The operation allows selecting an element and adding its mod 10 value to itself any number of times. \n\nThe code provided has a solve function. Let me read through it. The function checks for mod 10 of each element. It tracks if there's a 2 mod 10 (has_2) or 0 mod 10 (has_0). There's a loop where if the mod isn't 2 or 0, it keeps adding mod_10 until it becomes 2 or 0. \n\nWait, the problem says that each time you apply the operation, you add the current a_i mod 10. So for example, if a_i is 47, mod is 7, so adding 7 gives 54. Then mod is 4, so add 4 to get 58, mod 8, add 8 to get 66 mod 6, etc. But the code here is trying to get mod 10 to be 2 or 0. Hmm, maybe the key is that the possible end values depend on the mod 10. \n\nThe code's logic seems to be that after processing each element, they should end up with mod 2 or 0. But there's a condition where if both has_0 and has_2 are true, return NO. Because maybe those can't be made equal? \n\nWait, let's think. Suppose an element ends with mod 0, like 10. Applying the operation adds 0, so it stays. So elements ending with 0 can't be changed further. Similarly, elements ending with 2 can be modified until they reach 0 or 2 mod 10? Wait, the code's loop is while mod_10 is not 2 or 0. So it's trying to get each element to end with 0 or 2. \n\nThe problem is that if some elements end with 0 and others with 2, then they can't be made equal. Because elements ending with 0 can't change (since adding 0 does nothing), and elements ending with 2 can be modified further. Wait, but elements ending with 2 can be modified. Let's see: 2 mod 10 is 2, so adding 2 gives 4, then mod 4, so adding 4 gives 8, mod 8, adding 8 gives 16 mod 6, etc. Wait, but the code's loop stops when mod is 2 or 0. Wait, the code's loop is: while mod_10 is not 2 or 0, then add mod_10 again. Wait, but in the code, the loop is:\n\nfor each element:\n    mod_10 = a[i]%10\n    while mod_10 is not 2 or 0:\n        add mod_10 to a[i], then compute new mod_10.\n\nWait, but the condition is while mod_10 != 2 and mod_10 !=0? Because the code says:\n\nwhile mod_10 != 2 and mod_10 !=0:\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code has:\n\nwhile mod_10 != 2 and mod_10 != 0:\n\nWait, the code's loop is while mod_10 is neither 2 nor 0. So it keeps adding mod_10 until it reaches 2 or 0. \n\nSo after processing, each element's mod 10 is either 0 or 2. \n\nNow, the code checks if has_0 and has_2 are both true. If so, return NO. Because elements ending with 0 can't be changed further, and those ending with 2 can be modified. But if there are elements ending with 0 and 2, then they can't be made equal. Because the 0 mod elements can't change, but the 2 mod elements can be modified further. Wait, but maybe they can reach a common value?\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose an element is 10 (mod 0). It can't change. Another element is 2 (mod 2). Applying the operation on it: 2 \u2192 4 (mod4?), but wait, the code's loop would have stopped when mod is 2. Wait, no. Wait, the loop stops when mod is 2 or 0. So for the element 2, mod is 2, so the loop doesn't run. So the element remains 2. So if there's a 10 and a 2, they can't be made equal. So the code's logic is correct here. \n\nThen, after that, if has_2 is true, the code does arr[i] = arr[i] %20. Wait why 20? Because the note mentions that for 2, the cycle is 20. Like 2 \u21924 \u21928 \u219216 \u2192 22 (mod 2 gives 2 again?), but perhaps the cycle length is 20. So the maximum possible value before it cycles is 20? Or perhaps the possible values for elements ending with 2 can be represented modulo 20. \n\nThe code then checks if all elements modulo 20 are the same. If so, return YES. \n\nWait, but how does this work? Let me think of the example given in the problem: [6,11]. \n\nOriginal elements: 6 mod10 is 6. So the loop runs. 6 mod10 is 6, so add 6 \u219212. mod10 is 2. So now it stops. So the element becomes 12. The second element is 11 mod10 is 1. So add 1 \u219212 mod10 is 2. So now both elements are 12 mod20 (since 12 mod20 is 12). So when the code does arr[i]%20, they are 12 and 12, so set is size 1 \u2192 YES. \n\nAnother example: if elements are 2 and 4. 2 mod10 is 2, so stays. 4 mod10 is 4 \u2192 add 4 \u21928 mod10 is 8 \u2192 add 8 \u219216 mod10 is 6 \u2192 add 6 \u219222 mod10 is 2. So now mod10 is 2. So the element becomes 22. Then mod20 of 22 is 2. The first element is 2 mod20 is 2. So they can be made equal? Wait, but 2 can be modified further. Let's see: 2 can be added 2 \u21924, then 4 \u21928, etc. So the code's approach of taking mod20 may not capture all possibilities. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that for elements ending with 2, their possible values can be represented modulo 20. Because after some steps, they cycle. For example, 2 \u21924 \u21928 \u219216 \u219222 (mod10 is 2 again). 22 mod20 is 2. So adding mod10 (2) again gives 24 mod20 is 4. So the cycle is 20. So the possible values mod20 are 2,4,8,16, 2 (mod20?), but perhaps the maximum possible is 20? \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible value for elements ending with 2 is 20? Or maybe the possible values can be represented modulo 20. So when you process the elements, you can take their value mod20, and check if all are the same. \n\nSo the code's approach is: after processing each element to reach mod10 0 or 2, then if there are elements with mod10 0, they can't be changed further. So if any element is mod0, then all elements must be mod0. Because otherwise, elements with mod2 can be modified to reach mod0? Wait, no. Because once an element is mod2, you can keep adding mod10 (which is 2, then 4, etc.) until you reach mod0? \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose an element is 2 mod10. Applying the operation once gives 4 mod10. Then again, add 4 \u21928 mod10. Then add 8 \u219216 mod6 \u2192 mod10 is 6? Wait, no. Wait 16 mod10 is 6. So then adding 6 gives 22 mod10 is 2 again. So the cycle is 2 \u21924 \u21928 \u219216 \u219222 (mod10 2 again). So the mod10 cycles every 4 steps. \n\nHmm, so the possible values for elements ending with 2 can be 2,4,8,16, 22 (mod20?), but mod20 of 22 is 2. So mod20 cycles every 20 steps. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach of taking mod20 for elements ending with 2 is correct. \n\nNow, looking at the code's solve function. The problem is in the part where mod_10 is 0. The code has:\n\nif mod_10 == 2:\n    has_2 = True\n\nif mod_10 ==0:\n    has_0 = True\n\nThen, inside the loop, after adding mod_10 again, it checks again. \n\nWait, but in the loop, after adding mod_10, the code checks mod_10 again. So for example, when mod_10 becomes 2, the has_2 is set again. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nwhile mod_10 !=2 and mod_10 !=0:\n    arr[i] += mod_10\n    mod_10 = arr[i]%10\n    if mod_10 ==2:\n        has_2 = True\n    if mod_10 ==0:\n        has_0 = True\n\nWait, but the code's initial part for mod_10 is arr[i]%10. Then, after the loop, the mod_10 is either 2 or 0. \n\nWait, the code's loop is: while mod_10 is not 2 or 0, so it runs until mod_10 is 2 or 0. \n\nSo after the loop, mod_10 is either 2 or 0. \n\nThen, the code checks if mod_10 is 2 or 0, but the code's has_2 and has_0 are set during the loop. \n\nWait, but in the code's initial part, before the loop, it checks mod_10 (the original mod). So for example, if the element was already mod 2, then the loop doesn't run, so the has_2 is set. \n\nBut in the loop, after each step, it checks mod_10 again. So for example, if during the loop, the mod becomes 2, then has_2 is set. \n\nWait, but the code's loop is inside the for loop over each element. \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each element in arr:\n\n    mod_10 = arr[i]%10\n\n    if mod_10 is 2 \u2192 set has_2 to True\n\n    if mod_10 is 0 \u2192 set has_0 to True\n\n    then, while mod_10 is not 2 or 0:\n\n        add mod_10 to arr[i], compute new mod_10\n\n        if mod_10 is 2 \u2192 set has_2 to True\n\n        if mod_10 is 0 \u2192 set has_0 to True\n\nWait, but the code's loop is inside the for loop. So for each element, after processing, the mod_10 is either 2 or 0. \n\nBut the problem is that when mod_10 becomes 0 during the loop, then has_0 is set. \n\nHowever, the code's logic for has_0 and has_2 is that if any element can reach mod 0, then has_0 is true. But perhaps the code is trying to track whether any element in the array can reach mod 0 or 2. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that all elements can be made equal. So the code's approach is to process each element to their possible mod 2 or 0, then check if all can reach the same value. \n\nWait, but the code's final check is after processing all elements, if has_0 and has_2 are both true \u2192 return NO. Because elements can't be made equal if some are mod0 and others mod2. \n\nThen, if has_2 is true (so no mod0 elements?), then the code takes each element mod20 and checks if all are same. \n\nWait, but if there are elements with mod0, then has_0 is true. So in that case, if has_0 and has_2 are both true \u2192 return NO. \n\nOtherwise, if has_0 is true (so all elements are mod0?), then their mod20 would be their value mod20. But since mod10 is 0, mod20 can be 0,10, etc. Wait, but mod10 is 0, so mod20 can be 0, 10, 20 mod20 is 0, etc. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is that for elements ending with 0, their value can't be changed, so they must all be the same. \n\nWait, but the code's logic after has_2 is true (so no mod0 elements?), then it takes mod20. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is missing some parts. Let me look at the code again. \n\nThe code's solve function:\n\ndef solve(arr: typing.List[int]):\n    has_2 = False\n    has_0 = False\n    \n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        mod_10 = arr[i] % 10\n        \n        if mod_10 == 2:\n            has_2 = True\n            \n        if mod_10 == 0:\n            has_0 = True\n                \n        while mod_10 != 2 and mod_10 != 0:\n            arr[i] += mod_10\n            mod_10 = arr[i] % 10\n            \n            if mod_10 == 2:\n                has_2 = True\n            \n            if mod_10 == 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code has a comment here: the line after checking mod_10 ==0 in the loop. The code is missing the setting of has_0 here. \n\nAh! That's the missing part. The code inside the loop after adding mod_10 and computing mod_10 again, if mod_10 is 0, then has_0 should be set to True. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif mod_10 ==0:\n    has_0 = True\n\nSo the code inside the loop after mod_10 is updated should check for mod_10 being 0 and set has_0. \n\nSo the missing part in program1.py is adding:\n\n            if mod_10 ==0:\n                has_0 = True\n\nSo the code block inside the while loop after mod_10 is updated should have both checks. \n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is:\n\nIn the loop's code block:\n\n            if mod_10 == 2:\n                has_2 = True\n            if mod_10 == 0:\n                has_0 = True\n\nWait, but in the code, after the while loop's condition, the code inside the loop does:\n\nafter adding mod_10, mod_10 is computed again. Then, the code checks if mod_10 is 2 \u2192 set has_2. Then, the code has an if mod_10 ==0: but the code is missing the setting of has_0. \n\nSo the code's current code inside the loop is:\n\n            arr[i] += mod_10\n            mod_10 = arr[i] % 10\n            \n            if mod_10 == 2:\n                has_2 = True\n            \n            if mod_10 == 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code is to set has_0 to True here. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\n            if mod_10 == 0:\n                has_0 = True\n\nSo the missing part for program1 is adding that line. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make one copy of the array have all elements equal. The operations are cloning and swapping elements between any copies. \n\nThe code provided is:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nWait, the input is read as lines from open(0). The code is processing each test case's array (since the first line is t, then each test case has two lines: n and the array. The code is taking every second line starting from index 2 (since [2::2] would be the second line of each test case, which is the array). \n\nThe code splits the array into a list, then uses Counter to find the maximum frequency m of any element. \n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal number of operations. The note's example shows that when the maximum frequency is m, the minimal operations are (n - m) + (something). \n\nThe minimal operations would be: \n\nThe idea is that the best element to target is the one with the highest frequency, m. Because you can start with that element's count. \n\nEach clone adds a copy. Each swap can move elements between copies. \n\nThe minimal steps would be: \n\nThe number of clones needed is (number of copies needed) minus 1. Because each clone adds one copy. \n\nWait, the process is: \n\nInitially, there is 1 copy. \n\nEach clone increases the number of copies by 1. \n\nTo get k copies, you need (k-1) clone operations. \n\nThen, the swaps can distribute the elements. \n\nThe minimal steps would be: \n\nSuppose the target element is x with frequency m. \n\nWe need to have at least one copy where all elements are x. \n\nThe total number of x's available across all copies is m * (number of copies). \n\nWait, but each copy is a separate array. So the total x's in all copies is m * copies. \n\nWait, no. The initial array has m x's. Each clone duplicates the current copies. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are (n - m) + (number of clones needed). \n\nWait, the example given in the note: \n\nTest case 2: array [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The maximum frequency is 2 (0 appears twice). The answer is 6. \n\nThe steps were: \n\n- Clone once (now 2 copies). \n\n- Then swap elements between copies to collect all 0s into one array. \n\n- Then clone again (now 3 copies?), but the example's explanation is a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, the formula might be (n - m) + (something). \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (n - m) + (number of clones needed). \n\nWait, the minimal steps would be: \n\nThe minimal steps are (n - m) + (number of clones needed to have enough copies). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are (n - m) + (ceil((n - m)/m) -1). \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nThe problem requires that in at least one copy, all elements are equal. \n\nThe best element to choose is the one with maximum frequency m. \n\nThe number of copies needed is such that the total number of x's in all copies is at least n. \n\nWait, each copy has n elements. So to have one copy with all x's, you need that the total number of x's across all copies is at least n. \n\nThe initial array has m x's. Each clone doubles the number of copies. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are: \n\nThe number of clones needed is the minimal k such that m * (k+1) >= n. \n\nWait, because each clone doubles the number of copies. Wait no, each clone adds a copy. \n\nWait, the number of copies after k clones is (1 + k). \n\nThe total x's available is m * (1 + k). \n\nWe need m*(1 +k) >= n \u2192 (1 +k) >= ceil(n/m). \n\nThus, k = ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThe number of clone operations is k. \n\nThen, the swaps needed are (n - m) because each non-x element in the target copy must be swapped with an x from another copy. \n\nWait, but the swaps can be done between any copies. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of operations is (number of clones) + (number of swaps). \n\nBut the problem counts each clone and each swap as an operation. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\nEach operation is either a clone (counts as 1) or a swap (counts as 1). \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\nYou can do operations of two types: \n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy. \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of operations (clones + swaps) to have at least one copy where all elements are equal. \n\nThe minimal steps would be: \n\nLet m be the maximum frequency of any element. \n\nThe minimal steps are (number of clones) + (number of swaps needed). \n\nThe clones are needed to have enough copies to get enough x's. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are (n - m) + (number of clones needed). \n\nWait, let's see the example given in the note: \n\nTest case 2: n=6, m=2 (the 0's). \n\nThe required number of clones is ceil(6/2) -1 \u2192 3-1=2 clones. \n\nThen, the swaps needed are 6-2 =4? But the example's answer is 6. \n\nHmm, that doesn't add up. \n\nWait the example's answer is 6. \n\nIn the example, the steps were: \n\n- Clone once (1 clone \u2192 2 copies. 2 operations? Wait, each clone is one operation. So first clone: 1 operation. \n\nThen, after swapping, they made another clone? \n\nThe example's explanation says the total operations were 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is (n - m) + (number of clones). \n\nIn the example, n-m is 4, plus clones needed (2?), total 6. \n\nYes, that would fit. \n\nSo the formula would be (n - m) + (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nceil(6/2) is 3 \u2192 3-1=2 clones. \n\nSo 4 +2 =6 \u2192 matches the example. \n\nAnother example: if m =n, then the answer is 0 (no clones, no swaps). \n\nIf m =n-1, then ceil(n/(n-1)) is 2 \u2192 clones needed 1. \n\nThen (n - (n-1)) +1 \u2192 1+1=2. \n\nSo that makes sense. \n\nThus, the minimal operations are (n - m) + (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nBut how to compute ceil(n/m) -1? \n\nAlternatively, the number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThus, the total is (n - m) + (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nWait, but how to compute ceil(n/m) in code. \n\nIn Python, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b. \n\nSo ceil(n/m) is (n + m -1) // m. \n\nThus, the number of clones is ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1. \n\nThe total operations would be (n - m) + ( ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 ). \n\nWait, let's test with the example: \n\nn=6, m=2 \u2192 (6+2-1)//2 =7//2=3 \u2192 3-1=2. \n\nThen (6-2) +2 \u21924+2=6 \u2192 correct. \n\nAnother test case where m=3 and n=5: \n\nceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 clones needed 1. \n\nTotal operations: (5-3)+(2-1) \u21922+1=3. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code needs to compute this. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program2.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n = len(a.split())\n    m = max(Counter(a).values())\n    r =0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(r)\n\nWait, the code is in a loop while m <n. But that's not the right approach. \n\nThe correct formula is (n - m) + ( ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 ). \n\nWait, but how to compute this in code. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute the required number of clones as ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1. \n\nThen the total is (n - m) + (clones). \n\nWait, but the code's current approach is to have a loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute the required value directly. \n\nThe code's current code is:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n = len(a.split())\n    m = max(Counter(a).values())\n    r =0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(r)\n\nWait, the loop is while m <n. But m is the maximum frequency. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones as (required_copies -1), where required_copies is ceil(n/m). \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute the required number of clones as ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1. \n\nThen the total operations would be (n - m) + (clones). \n\nSo the code should compute that. \n\nThe code currently has a loop that runs while m <n. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones by incrementally increasing m? \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is incorrect, and the missing code is to compute the formula. \n\nThe code's current code is:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n = len(a.split())\n    m = max(Counter(a).values())\n    r =0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(r)\n\nThe loop is while m <n. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones by multiplying m by the number of copies. \n\nWait, each clone doubles the number of copies. Wait no, each clone adds one copy. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the number of clones needed so that m * (copies) >=n. \n\nThe number of copies after k clones is (1 +k). \n\nSo m*(1 +k) >=n \u2192 k >= (n/m -1). \n\nThus, the minimal k is ceil( (n/m) -1 ). \n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute the required number of clones as ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1. \n\nThen the total operations is (n -m) + (clones). \n\nSo the code can compute this as:\n\nclones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\ntotal = (n - m) + clones_needed\n\nThus, the code can replace the loop with this calculation. \n\nThe current code has a loop that runs while m <n. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones by incrementally increasing m. \n\nWait, but m is the maximum frequency. \n\nAlternatively, the code is missing the calculation of the formula. \n\nThe code's current code has a loop that runs while m <n. \n\nInside the loop, the code needs to compute how many clones are needed. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones by multiplying m by the number of copies. \n\nWait, the code's loop is while m <n. \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is adding clones and increasing m. \n\nWait, but m is the maximum frequency. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the required number of clones as (n - m) // m. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is missing the formula. \n\nThe correct code for program2.py would be:\n\nThe code should compute the required number of clones as ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1, then the total is (n -m) + clones_needed. \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n    arr = a.split()\n    n = len(arr)\n    cnt = Counter(arr)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >= n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    clones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n    total = (n - m) + clones_needed\n    print(total)\n\nWait, but the code in the problem's program2.py is written as:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nSo the missing code is to compute the required value. \n\nThe code's current variables are n, m, r. \n\nThe code needs to compute r as (n - m) + (clones_needed). \n\nThe clones_needed is ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1. \n\nThus, the code can compute that and set r to the total. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute the required value directly. \n\nThe code's loop is while m <n. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones by incrementally adding clones. \n\nWait, each clone increases the number of copies. \n\nWait, the number of copies after k clones is (1 +k). \n\nThe total x's available is m * (1 +k). \n\nWe need m*(1 +k) >=n \u2192 1 +k >= ceil(n/m) \u2192 k = ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThus, the code can compute clones_needed as (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThus, the code can compute this and set r = (n -m) + clones_needed. \n\nSo the missing code in the loop is not needed. The loop is probably a mistake. \n\nThe code should instead compute the formula and set r to the total. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nBut the problem says to fill in the missing lines. The code has a while loop that runs while m <n. \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be fixed by removing the loop and computing the formula. \n\nBut given the code's structure, perhaps the code is supposed to compute the required number of clones by incrementing r until m * (copies) >=n. \n\nWait, let's think of the loop as:\n\nInitially, copies =1 (since we start with one array). \n\nEach clone increases copies by 1. \n\nThe number of x's available is m * copies. \n\nWe need m * copies >=n \u2192 copies >= ceil(n/m). \n\nThe required copies is ceil(n/m). \n\nThe number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThus, the code can compute this and set r = (n -m) + (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    arr = a.split()\n    n = len(arr)\n    m = max(Counter(arr).values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    copies_needed = (n + m -1) // m\n    clones = copies_needed -1\n    swaps = n - m\n    total = clones + swaps\n    print(total)\n\nSo the code for program2.py's missing part is to compute this. \n\nBut the original code has a loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake, and the correct code is to compute the formula. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing lines. The code's current line is:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones by incrementing r until m * (copies) >=n. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, copies is 1. \n\nEach clone increases copies by 1. \n\nThe number of x's available is m * copies. \n\nWe need m * copies >=n \u2192 copies >= ceil(n/m). \n\nThe required number of clones is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThus, the code can compute the required number of clones as (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nBut how to compute that in the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the loop can be:\n\nwhile m * (copies) <n:\n\n    copies +=1\n\n    clones +=1\n\nBut the code's variables are m and r. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute the required number of clones as ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1. \n\nThus, the code can compute that and set r to (n -m) + (clones). \n\nBut the code's current structure has a loop. \n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to compute the required number of clones by incrementing r until m*(1 + r) >=n. \n\nBecause each clone adds one copy. \n\nThus, the number of clones needed is the minimal r where m*(1 + r) >=n. \n\nSo solving for r: \n\nr >= (n/m -1). \n\nThus, r = ceil( (n/m) -1 ). \n\nWait, but in code, it can be written as:\n\nrequired_clones = 0\n\nwhile m * (1 + required_clones) <n:\n\n    required_clones +=1\n\nThus, the code can compute required_clones in a loop. \n\nThen, the total is (n -m) + required_clones. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to compute required_clones in the loop. \n\nThe code's current variables are r (which is initialized to 0). \n\nThe loop is while m <n. \n\nWait, but m is fixed. \n\nWait, the loop condition is while m <n. \n\nBut m is the maximum frequency. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of clones as (n -m) + (required_clones). \n\nWait, the code's loop is while m <n. \n\nInside the loop, perhaps the code is adding clones and increasing m. \n\nWait, but m is the maximum frequency. \n\nAlternatively, the code is wrong and the correct approach is to compute the formula. \n\nGiven the problem's time constraints, perhaps the correct code for program2 is to compute the formula and set r to the total. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing lines in the existing code. \n\nThe code's current line is:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to compute the required number of clones by incrementing r until m*(1 + r) >=n. \n\nThus, inside the loop:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    r +=1\n\n    if m * (1 + r) >=n:\n\n        break\n\nWait, but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the loop can be:\n\nwhile m * (1 + r) <n:\n\n    r +=1\n\nThus, the code's loop condition should be while m*(1 + r) <n. \n\nBut the current loop is while m <n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's loop is incorrect and the correct code is to compute the formula. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the formula approach. \n\nThus, the code for program2's missing part is to compute the required value and set r to (n -m) + (clones_needed). \n\nThe code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    arr = a.split()\n    n = len(arr)\n    m = max(Counter(arr).values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    clones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n    total = (n -

m) // m. \n\nWait, let's see the example where n=6, m=2. \n\n(n -m) is 4. \n\n4//2 =2 \u2192 which matches the required clones (2). \n\nThus, the total would be (4) +2 \u21926. \n\nAnother example where n=5, m=3 \u2192 (5-3)=2 \u2192 2//3=0 \u2192 total 2+0=2. \n\nWait, but the required clones is (5+3-1)/3 \u2192 (7//3)=2 \u2192 clones_needed is 2-1=1. \n\nThus, the formula (n-m)//m gives 0, but the correct clones_needed is 1. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is supposed to compute r as (n - m) // m. \n\nWait, but in the first example, (6-2)/2 =2 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nIn the second example (n=5, m=3), (5-3)/3 =0.666 \u2192 floor is 0. \n\nBut the required clones is 1. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the code should compute r as (n - m + m -1) // m \u2192 (n-1)//m. \n\nWait, (n-1)//m \u2192 (5-1)/3 =4/3=1 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nThus, the required clones is (n-1)//m. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nclones_needed = (n-1) // m \n\nWait, for n=6, m=2 \u2192 (5)//2 =2 \u2192 correct. \n\nFor n=5, m=3 \u21924//3=1 \u2192 correct. \n\nYes! \n\nThus, the required clones_needed is (n-1) // m. \n\nThus, the total is (n -m) + ( (n-1)//m ). \n\nWait, let's test:\n\nExample 1: n=6, m=2 \u2192 (6-1)//2 =5//2=2 \u2192 total 4+2=6. \n\nExample 2: n=5, m=3 \u2192 (4//3)=1 \u2192 total 2+1=3. \n\nAnother example where m=1 and n=5 \u2192 (5-1)//1 =4 \u2192 total (5-1)+4=8. \n\nWhich would be correct: \n\nTo have 5 copies (since 1*5=5), so clones needed 4. \n\nSwaps needed 4 (since n-m=4). \n\nTotal 8. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the formula is total = (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ). \n\nThus, the code can compute this. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ). \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    arr = a.split()\n    n = len(arr)\n    m = max(Counter(arr).values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n    print(r)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute r as this value. \n\nBut the original code has a loop. \n\nThe code's current line is:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThus, the code inside the loop must compute r. \n\nAlternatively, the loop is not needed, and the code can compute r directly. \n\nThe problem requires to fill in the missing lines. \n\nThe code's current code is:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThus, the missing code inside the loop is to compute r. \n\nBut the loop is while m <n. \n\nWait, m is fixed. \n\nThus, the loop will run indefinitely unless the code inside changes m. \n\nThis suggests that the loop is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to compute the required number of clones by incrementing r until m*(1 + r) >=n. \n\nThus, inside the loop:\n\nwhile m * (1 + r) <n:\n\n    r +=1\n\nBut the loop condition is while m <n. \n\nThus, the code can't use that. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to compute r as (n-1)//m + (n -m). \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to set r = (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ). \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    arr = a.split()\n    n = len(arr)\n    m = max(Counter(arr).values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n        continue\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n    print(r)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute r as that. \n\nNow moving to program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum possible bitwise AND of all c_i, where c_i = a_i XOR b_i after reordering b. \n\nThe code provided has a solve function that uses a bitmask approach. \n\nThe code's solve function is trying to compute the maximum possible AND by checking each bit from highest to lowest. \n\nThe code uses a list of possible partitions (ps) which track possible pairs of indices from a and b. \n\nThe code's current code has a loop over bits from 30 down to 0. \n\nFor each bit k, it processes the current partitions (pa and pb) and splits them into a0, a1 (based on whether a's element has the bit set), and similarly for b0 and b1. \n\nThen, if the number of a0 elements equals the number of b1 elements, then this bit can be set in the result. \n\nWait, the code's logic is trying to decide whether the current bit can be part of the maximum AND. \n\nThe code's current code has a TODO in the part where it splits the b elements into b0 and b1. \n\nThe code has:\n\nfor pbi in pb:\n\n    if b[pbi] & (1<<k) ==0: b0.append(pbi) \n\n    else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nThus, the missing code is to append to b1 when the bit is set. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nelse:\n\n    b1.append(pbi)\n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is to append to b1 when the bit is set. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nelse:\n\n    b1.append(pbi)\n\nThus, the code for program3's missing part is to add that line. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFor program1, the missing code is in the loop after mod_10 is updated. \n\nThe code inside the while loop after mod_10 is computed should set has_0 to True if mod_10 is 0. \n\nThus, the code is:\n\n            if mod_10 == 0:\n                has_0 = True\n\nFor program2, the missing code is to compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ). \n\nThus, the code after the loop (but the loop is not needed) would be:\n\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n    print(r)\n\nBut the original code has a loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is not needed and the correct code is to compute r directly. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing lines in the existing code. \n\nThe code's current line is:\n\nwhile m <n:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThus, the code inside the loop must compute r. \n\nBut since m is fixed, the loop will run indefinitely unless the code breaks. \n\nThis suggests that the loop is incorrect and the code should compute r directly. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2 is to compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ), so the missing code is to set r to that value. \n\nBut the code's structure has a loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to compute r directly. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ), so the code after the loop (but the loop is not needed) would be:\n\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n    print(r)\n\nThus, the code's missing part is to compute r and print it. \n\nFinally, program3's missing code is to append to b1 when the bit is set. \n\nThus, the three missing parts are:\n\nprogram1: \n\nIn the loop inside the for loop over elements, after mod_10 is updated, check if mod_10 is 0 and set has_0 to True. \n\nprogram2: \n\nThe code should compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ), so the missing code is to set r to that value. \n\nprogram3: \n\nThe missing code is to append to b1 when the bit is set. \n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\nprogram1's missing code is the line:\n\n            if mod_10 == 0:\n                has_0 = True\n\nprogram2's missing code is to compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ), so the code after the loop (but the loop is not needed) would be:\n\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n    print(r)\n\nBut since the code has a loop, perhaps the correct approach is to compute r directly. \n\nprogram3's missing code is:\n\nelse:\n    b1.append(pbi)\n\nThus, the JSON output would be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            if mod_10 == 0:\\n                has_0 = True\",\n    \"program2\": \"    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\",\n    \"program3\": \"                else:\\n                    b1.append(pbi)\"\n}\n\nWait, but for program2, the code's current structure has a loop. \n\nThe original code for program2 is:\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nThe missing code is to compute r as (n -m) + ( (n-1) // m ), so the code after the loop (but the loop is not needed) would be:\n\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n    print(r)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with this line. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing lines in the existing code. \n\nThe code's loop is while m <n, which is always true unless m >=n. \n\nThus, the loop is incorrect and the code should compute r directly. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is to set r to the computed value. \n\nThus, the code for program2's missing part is:\n\n    r = (n - m) + ( (n-1) // m )\n\nHence, the JSON entries are as above."
