  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about finding all possible values of 'a' such that the boundary of the bathroom can be tiled with 1\u00d7a tiles. The bathroom's interior is already covered by 1x1 tiles, so the remaining area is the perimeter. The perimeter's length is calculated as (w + l - 2)*2, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says the boundary uses tiles of 1\u00d7a. The boundary is the outer edge. The total length of the boundary would be the perimeter of the rectangle minus the corners? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. \n\nThe problem states that the boundary tiles must form a perimeter. The total length of the boundary is the perimeter of the rectangle minus the inner part. Wait, the interior is (w-2)*(l-2), so the boundary is the remaining area. Wait, actually, the total area is w*l. The interior is (w-2)*(l-2), so the boundary area is w*l - (w-2)(l-2) = 2w + 2l -4. But since the tiles are 1\u00d7a, arranged along the boundary, the total length of the boundary's edges must be divisible by a. Wait, the boundary is the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is 2*(w + l) - 4? Because the corners are counted twice? Wait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + l), but when considering the tiles along the edges, each corner is part of two edges. So the total length of the boundary edges (the path around the rectangle) is 2*(w + l) - 4, since the four corners are counted once each, but each edge's length is (w-1) and (l-1) for the sides. Wait, maybe the total length of the boundary is (2*(w + l) - 4). Because each side's length is (w) and (l), but when you walk around the perimeter, each side is length (w-1) steps for the edges? Hmm, perhaps the correct way is that the boundary's total length is 2*(w + l) - 4. Because the four corners are each part of two edges, so subtracting 4 to avoid double-counting? Not sure. Alternatively, the problem says that the boundary uses tiles of 1\u00d7a. The tiles can be rotated, so the a can be along either direction. The total length of the boundary's edges must be divisible by a. Wait, the problem says that the boundary must be covered by tiles of 1\u00d7a. So the total length of the boundary's edges must be a multiple of a. Wait, the tiles are 1\u00d7a, so each tile covers a length of a along one direction. Since the tiles can be rotated, the a can be in either direction. So the total length of the boundary's edges must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, the problem says the boundary is the perimeter. The perimeter's total length is 2*(w + l) - 4? Let me think again. The bathroom is a rectangle of w by l. The inner part is (w-2)*(l-2), so the boundary is the area around it. The boundary's area is the total area minus the inner area. But the problem is about tiling the boundary with 1\u00d7a tiles. The tiles are placed along the edges. The perimeter's length is the total length of all edges. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + l). But each edge is a line of length w or l. However, when considering the tiles along the edges, each edge's length is (w) for the length, but the tiles are placed along the edges. Wait, perhaps the total length of the boundary's edges is 2*(w + l) - 4. Because each corner is counted in two edges, so subtract 4 to avoid overlapping? Or maybe the actual path around the perimeter is 2*(w + l) - 4. For example, in a 3x5 bathroom, the perimeter would be 2*(3+5) = 16, but subtracting 4 gives 12. Let me check the first example. The first test case is 3 and 5. The output says a can be 1,2,3. The half_perimeter in the code is w + l -2, which for 3+5-2=6. So the code uses half_perimeter = w + l -2. So the total length of the boundary is 2*(w + l -2). Wait, 2*(w + l -2) would be 2*(3+5-2)=12, which matches the example. So the code's half_perimeter is actually half of the total boundary length. Because the total boundary length is 2*(w + l -2). So the total length is 2*(w + l -2). Therefore, the a must divide this total length. So the possible a's are the divisors of the total length (2*(w + l -2)), but also must satisfy some conditions related to the dimensions. \n\nWait, the code in program1.py has a variable called half_perimeter which is w + l -2. So the total length is 2*half_perimeter. So the a must divide 2*(w + l -2). But there's more constraints. The problem says that the tiles can be rotated, so the a can be placed along either direction. But how does that affect the constraints? \n\nThe code's current approach is trying to collect all divisors of the half_perimeter (since the code uses half_perimeter = w + l -2, but the total length is 2*half_perimeter). Wait, no. Wait, the code is using the half_perimeter as the value to find divisors. Let me look at the code again. \n\nIn the code, the half_perimeter is set to w + l -2. Then, the code is looping over divisors of half_perimeter. Wait, but the total length is 2*(half_perimeter). So the a must divide 2*(half_perimeter). But the code is considering divisors of half_perimeter. That might be a mistake. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to collect possible a's that divide the half_perimeter. But according to the problem, the a must divide the total boundary length (2*(w + l -2)), so the a must be a divisor of that. So the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is wrong here. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that the boundary can be tiled with 1\u00d7a tiles. The total length of the boundary is 2*(w + l -2). So the a must divide this total length. So the possible a's are all divisors of 2*(w + l -2). But there's an additional constraint: the tiles must fit along the edges. For example, the tiles can be placed along the edges, so the length of each edge must be divisible by a or by the other dimension (since the tiles can be rotated). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering that the a must divide the half_perimeter (w + l -2), but that's not correct. Let me see the first example. \n\nIn the first test case, w=3, l=5. The total boundary length is 2*(3+5-2) = 12. The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The sample output includes 1,2,3. So why are 4,6,12 excluded? \n\nLooking at the sample explanation, the valid a's are 1,2,3. Let's see why 4 is invalid. \n\nSuppose a=4. The total length is 12, so 12/4=3 tiles. But how would they fit? The edges are of lengths 3,5,3,5. The perimeter is made up of four sides: two of length w and two of length l. Wait, no. Wait, the perimeter is 2*(w + l) but subtracting 4? Or perhaps the edges are (w-1) and (l-1) each? Wait, perhaps the edges are of length w and l, but when you walk around the perimeter, each side's length is w and l. So the four sides are: top (length l), right (w), bottom (l), left (w). But the total is 2*(w + l). But the problem's code uses half_perimeter as w + l -2, so the total length is 2*(w + l -2). So in the first example, 3+5-2=6, so total length 12. \n\nNow, for a=4, the total length is divisible by 4 (12/4=3). But how to arrange the tiles. Let's see. The tiles are 1\u00d7a. So each tile is either 1x4 or 4x1. The tiles can be placed along the edges. For example, along the top edge (length 5), the tiles must fit. The length of the edge must be divisible by a or by 1 (since the tile can be rotated). Wait, the tile's length can be a or 1. Wait, the tile is 1\u00d7a, so when rotated, it's a\u00d71. So the tile's length along the edge can be either a or 1. So for each edge of length s, the length s must be divisible by a or by 1. But since a is at least 1, the 1 is always possible. Wait, but the tiles must be placed along the edges. So for each edge of length s, the edge's length must be divisible by a. Because the tiles can be placed either direction. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nEach edge has a certain length. The tiles must be placed along the edge. The tiles can be placed in any orientation, so the length of the edge must be divisible by a. Because the tile's length along the edge must be exactly a. Wait, no. For example, if the edge is of length 5 and a is 4, then you can't fit 4 into 5. So the edge length must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, the tiles are 1\u00d7a. So when placed along an edge of length s, the tiles must be arranged such that their length (either a or 1) matches the edge's direction. For example, if the edge is along the length l (horizontal), then the tiles can be placed horizontally (so their length is a) or vertically (so their length is 1). But the edge's length is l, so the tiles placed along that edge must have their length (either a or 1) divide the edge's length. \n\nWait, perhaps the edge's length must be divisible by a or by 1. But since a is at least 1, the 1 is always possible. But that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles must be placed such that their a-length side is along the edge. So the edge's length must be divisible by a. Because the tiles are placed in a line along the edge. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that all edges' lengths must be divisible by a. Because each edge is part of the boundary, and the tiles must cover the entire edge. \n\nWait, the problem says that the boundary is tiled with 1\u00d7a tiles. So each edge must be covered by tiles whose length (either a or 1) divides the edge's length. \n\nWait, the edge's length must be divisible by a or by 1. But since a is at least 1, the 1 is always possible. But that would mean that any a that divides the total length would work, but the sample shows that this isn't the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the tiles can be arranged such that all edges are covered. So for each edge of length s, s must be divisible by a or by 1. But since a can be rotated, the edge can be covered by tiles of length a or 1. Wait, but the tiles are 1\u00d7a. So when placed along an edge of length s, the tiles must be placed such that their length (either a or 1) divides s. \n\nWait, the tiles can be placed in any orientation, so for each edge of length s, s must be divisible by a or by 1. But since a is at least 1, the 1 is always possible. So the only constraint is that the total length is divisible by a. But in the first example, a=4 is a divisor of 12 (total length), but it's not in the sample's answer. \n\nWait the sample's first case has a=4 not being a valid option. Let's see why. \n\nIn the first test case, w=3, l=5. The edges are: top (5), right (3), bottom (5), left (3). The total length is 5+3+5+3 = 16? Wait, but according to the code's half_perimeter, it's 3+5-2=6, so total length 12. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's boundary. \n\nWait the problem says that the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). So the boundary is the area around it. The boundary's area is the total area minus the interior. The area of the boundary is w*l - (w-2)(l-2) = 2w + 2l -4. But the problem is about tiling the boundary's edges with tiles of 1\u00d7a. The tiles are placed along the edges. The edges form a perimeter. The perimeter's length is 2*(w + l) -4. Because each side's length is (w-1) and (l-1). Wait, perhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). For example, the top edge is length l, but the interior is (w-2)*(l-2), so the top edge's length is l, but the interior's top edge is l-2. So the boundary's edges are the outer edges. \n\nAlternatively, the perimeter's length is 2*(w + l) -4. Let me compute that for the first example: 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12, which matches the code's half_perimeter *2. \n\nSo the total length is 12. So a must divide 12. The divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the sample output includes 1,2,3. So why are 4,6,12 excluded? \n\nLet me think for a=4. The total length is 12, so 12/4=3 tiles. But each edge must be covered by tiles of length a (4) or 1. Let's see the edges. The edges are: \n\nTop edge length l=5. So 5 must be divisible by 4 or 1. 5 mod4 is 1, so it's not divisible by 4. So the tiles can't be placed along the top edge with a=4. So a=4 is invalid. \n\nAh! So the problem requires that each edge's length must be divisible by a or by 1. Wait, but the tiles can be rotated, so the edge's length must be divisible by a or by 1. But since a is at least 1, the 1 is always possible. Wait, but the tiles must be placed along the edge. For example, if the edge is of length 5 and a is 4, then the tiles can be placed with their 1-unit side along the edge. So each tile contributes 1 unit to the edge's length. So the edge's length must be divisible by 1, which it is. But then why is a=4 invalid in the sample? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says that the boundary is to be tiled with tiles of size 1\u00d7a, which can be rotated. So each tile can be placed as 1\u00d7a or a\u00d71. The tiles must cover the entire boundary. \n\nThe boundary is the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter is made up of four edges. Each edge has a certain length. The tiles must be arranged along these edges. \n\nEach edge's length must be divisible by either a or 1. Because the tiles can be placed in either orientation. For example, if the edge is of length s, then s must be divisible by a (if the tiles are placed with their a-length side along the edge) or by 1 (if placed with the 1-length side along the edge). But since 1 divides any s, the only constraint is that the total length of the perimeter must be divisible by a. Wait, but that can't be, because in the first example, a=4 divides 12, but the edge lengths are 5 and 3. \n\nWait, the edge lengths are 5 (top and bottom) and 3 (left and right). Let's see for a=4. \n\nThe top edge is 5 units long. To cover it with tiles of a=4, you can place tiles in the 1\u00d7a orientation (so their length along the edge is 1). So each tile contributes 1 unit. So 5 tiles of 1 unit each. That works. Similarly for the bottom edge. The left and right edges are 3 units. Again, using tiles with 1-unit length. So each edge can be covered. So why is a=4 not allowed in the sample? \n\nHmm, this suggests that my understanding is wrong. The sample says a=4 is not valid. So there must be another constraint. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their a-length side is along the edge. Because otherwise, the tiles would be placed in the 1\u00d7a orientation, but then the other dimension (the 1) would have to fit into the other direction. \n\nWait, the tiles are placed along the edge, but they also have to form a continuous tiling. Maybe the problem requires that the tiles are placed in such a way that their a-length is along the edge. Because otherwise, the tiles would extend into the interior. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their a-length is along the edge's direction. For example, the edge is along the length l, so the tiles must be placed with their a-length along that direction. \n\nWait, the problem says that the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. So the tiles can be placed in either orientation. But the tiles must form a continuous tiling along the edge. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the entire boundary is covered by tiles arranged in such a way that their a-length is along the edge. Because otherwise, the tiles would have to be placed in a way that their 1-unit side is along the edge, but then the other dimension (a) would have to fit into the other direction. \n\nWait, the tiles are 1\u00d7a. If placed along an edge of length s, then the tiles can be placed either with their a side along the edge (so the length along the edge is a, so s must be divisible by a) or with their 1 side along the edge (so the length along the edge is 1, so s must be divisible by 1, which it is). But in the latter case, the tiles would extend into the interior. But the problem states that the interior is already covered by 1x1 tiles. So perhaps the boundary tiles must be placed such that their a-length is along the edge. \n\nWait, the problem says that the boundary uses tiles of 1\u00d7a. The interior is already covered by 1x1. So the boundary tiles must be placed along the perimeter, but not overlapping with the interior. So each boundary tile must be placed such that their a-length is along the edge. Because otherwise, if they are placed with the 1 side along the edge, their a-length would extend into the interior, which is already covered by 1x1 tiles. \n\nAh! That makes sense. So the tiles must be placed such that their a-length is along the edge. Therefore, each edge's length must be divisible by a. \n\nTherefore, for each edge of length s (the edges are of lengths w, l, w, l), but wait, the edges are actually of lengths (w-1) and (l-1) because the corners are counted once. Wait, perhaps the edges are of length w and l. Let me think again. \n\nThe perimeter is made up of four edges: two of length w and two of length l. Wait, no. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + l). Each side's length is w or l. For example, the top edge is length l, the right edge is length w, etc. So each edge's length is either w or l. \n\nWait, but in the first example, w=3, l=5. The edges are 5 (top), 3 (right), 5 (bottom), 3 (left). So each edge's length is either w or l. \n\nTherefore, for each edge of length s (either w or l), s must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but in the first example, a=4. The edges have lengths 3 and 5. 3 mod4 is 3, 5 mod4 is 1. So neither is divisible by 4. So a=4 is invalid. That's why it's excluded. \n\nAh! So the correct constraints are that a must divide both w and l, or divide one of them and the other edge's length? Wait no. Wait, the edges are of lengths w and l. So for all edges of length w (there are two edges of length w and two of l), each must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, no. The edges of length w (the vertical edges) are of length w. So for those edges, their length must be divisible by a. Similarly, the edges of length l (horizontal edges) must also be divisible by a. \n\nWait, no. Because the edges of length w are vertical, so their length is w. So for those edges, their length must be divisible by a. The edges of length l must also be divisible by a. \n\nWait, that's the key! So a must divide both w and l? No, because in the first example, a=2 is allowed. Let's see: \n\nIn the first example, w=3, l=5. \n\na=2: \n\nCheck edges: \n\nEdges of length 3 (w) must be divisible by 2? 3 mod2 is 1. So that's not divisible. \n\nWait, but a=2 is in the sample's valid answers. So this contradicts the previous conclusion. \n\nHmm, so my reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the edges are not of length w and l. Let me think again. \n\nThe bathroom is a rectangle of width w and length l. The perimeter is 2*(w + l). But the problem's code uses half_perimeter = w + l -2. So the total length is 2*(w + l -2). \n\nWait, perhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). Because the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). So the edges are the outer edges. \n\nWait, the edges of the boundary are the outer edges. The vertical edges (left and right) have length w, but the interior is (w-2) in width. So the vertical edges (left and right) have length l. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between width and length. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). For example, the top edge is length l, but the interior's top edge is (l-2). So the boundary's top edge is the outer edge, which is length l. The vertical edges (left and right) are of length w. \n\nWait, perhaps the edges are of length w and l. So for a to be valid, all edges must have lengths divisible by a. \n\nBut in the first example, a=2 is allowed. Let's see: \n\nEdges of length 3 (w) and 5 (l). \n\n3 mod2 is 1, so not divisible. 5 mod2 is 1. So why is a=2 allowed? \n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. \n\nWait the sample says a=2 is valid. Let me think of how that could work. \n\nIf a=2, then the tiles are 1\u00d72. \n\nThe edges of length 3 (vertical edges) must be covered by tiles of length 2. But 3 is not divisible by 2. So how can that be? \n\nWait maybe the tiles can be placed in a way that their 1-unit side is along the edge. Wait, but earlier reasoning said that the tiles must have their a side along the edge. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tiles can be placed in either orientation, so the edge length must be divisible by a or by 1. \n\nWait, if the edge length is 3, and a=2, then the edge can be covered by tiles placed with their 1-unit side along the edge. Each tile contributes 1 unit. So 3 tiles of 1-unit length. So the edge length is divisible by 1, which it is. \n\nAh! So the edge length must be divisible by a or by 1. Since 1 divides any number, the only constraint is that the total length of the perimeter is divisible by a. \n\nWait, but then why in the first example a=4 is invalid? \n\nWait the total length is 12, which is divisible by 4. So according to this, a=4 should be allowed. But the sample says it's not. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait the sample's first case has a=4 not allowed. Let me think of the edges again. \n\nThe edges are of lengths 3 and 5. \n\nIf a=4, then the edges of length 3 and 5 must be covered by tiles. \n\nFor the edges of length 3 (vertical edges), the tiles can be placed with their 1-unit side along the edge (so each contributes 1 unit). So 3 tiles. \n\nFor the edges of length 5 (horizontal edges), similarly, 5 tiles of 1-unit length. \n\nSo all edges can be covered. So why is a=4 not allowed in the sample? \n\nThis suggests that my understanding is wrong. \n\nWait the problem says that the tiles are 1\u00d7a. So each tile covers an area of a. The total area of the boundary is 2*(w + l -2). So the total number of tiles must be (2*(w + l -2)) / a. \n\nBut the problem requires that the tiles can be arranged along the edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their a-length is along the edge. Because otherwise, the tiles would extend into the interior. \n\nWait, the interior is already covered by 1x1 tiles. So the boundary tiles must be placed along the perimeter, but not overlapping with the interior. \n\nSo each boundary tile must be placed such that their a-length is along the edge. Because if they are placed with the 1-unit side along the edge, then their a-length would extend into the interior, which is already covered. \n\nAh! That's the key. So the tiles must be placed with their a-length along the edge. Therefore, each edge's length must be divisible by a. \n\nSo for each edge of length s (either w or l), s must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but in the first example, a=2 is allowed. Let's see: \n\nEdges of length 3 (w) and 5 (l). \n\n3 mod2 is 1, so not divisible. So why is a=2 allowed? \n\nHmm, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait maybe the edges are not of length w and l. Let me think again. \n\nThe bathroom has width w and length l. The edges are the four sides. The vertical edges (left and right) have length l. The horizontal edges (top and bottom) have length w. \n\nWait, no. The vertical edges (left and right) are along the width. So their length is the length of the bathroom, which is l. The horizontal edges (top and bottom) are along the length, so their length is w. \n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up width and length. Let me clarify: \n\nSuppose the bathroom has width w (horizontal) and length l (vertical). \n\nThen the top and bottom edges are of length w. The left and right edges are of length l. \n\nSo in the first example, w=3, l=5. \n\nThe top and bottom edges are length 3. The left and right edges are length 5. \n\nSo for a=2: \n\nThe edges of length 3 (top and bottom) must be divisible by a=2. 3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 not divisible. \n\nSo a=2 shouldn't be allowed. But the sample says it is. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). \n\nWait, the problem says the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). So the boundary is the outer layer. The edges would then be of length (w) and (l), but subtracting 2 for the corners? \n\nAlternatively, the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). \n\nWait, perhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). For example, the top edge is length w, but the interior's top edge is (w-2). So the boundary's top edge is the outer edge, which is length w. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the first example. \n\nSample input 1: w=3, l=5. \n\nThe bathroom is 3 cm wide and 5 cm long. \n\nThe interior is (3-2)*(5-2) = 1*3 = 3 tiles. \n\nThe boundary area is 3*5 - 3 = 12. \n\nThe boundary's perimeter length is 12. \n\nThe sample says a=2 is allowed. \n\nIf a=2, then the tiles are 1\u00d72. \n\nThe total number of tiles is 12/2 =6. \n\nNow, how to arrange them. \n\nThe edges are: \n\nTop edge (length 3), bottom edge (3), left (5), right (5). \n\nEach edge must be covered by tiles of length a=2. \n\nThe top edge is 3 units long. 3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 not divisible. So can't be covered by tiles of length 2. \n\nBut the sample says it's allowed. \n\nThis suggests that my assumption is wrong. \n\nPerhaps the tiles can be placed in a way that their a-length is perpendicular to the edge. \n\nWait, maybe the tiles are placed along the edge's direction, but their a-length can be in any direction. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles can be placed in such a way that their a-length is along the edge's direction or perpendicular. \n\nWait, the problem says the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. So the tiles can be placed in any orientation. \n\nThe key is that the entire boundary must be covered by tiles of size 1\u00d7a. \n\nThe boundary is a closed loop. The total length of the boundary is 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThe tiles must be arranged such that their combined length along the boundary equals this total. \n\nEach tile contributes a length of a (if placed along the direction) or 1 (if placed perpendicular). \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles are placed along the perimeter path. Each tile covers a segment of the perimeter path. The tiles can be placed in any orientation, but their length along the path must be either 1 or a. \n\nWait, the perimeter is a path of length L = 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThe tiles must be placed along this path such that each tile's length along the path is either 1 or a. \n\nThe total length must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but the tiles can be placed in any combination of 1 and a lengths as long as the total is divisible by a. \n\nWait, no. Because each tile must be either 1 or a in length along the path. \n\nWait, the tiles are 1\u00d7a. So when placed along the path, the length they cover along the path can be either 1 or a. \n\nThe total length must be exactly equal to the sum of the lengths of all tiles. \n\nThe total number of tiles is (total length) / (average length per tile). \n\nBut the problem requires that the entire path is covered by tiles of 1\u00d7a. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in any way as long as the total length is divisible by a. Because each tile contributes either 1 or a units. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that all tiles are of size 1\u00d7a. So each tile must be placed such that its length along the path is either 1 or a. \n\nThe total length must be equal to the sum of the lengths of all tiles. \n\nThe total length is L = 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThe sum of the tiles' lengths must be L. \n\nEach tile contributes either 1 or a. \n\nThe total number of tiles is (number of 1-length tiles) + (number of a-length tiles). \n\nThe total length is 1*(x) + a*(y) = L, where x + y is the total number of tiles. \n\nBut the problem requires that all tiles are of size 1\u00d7a. So each tile must be placed in such a way that their length along the path is either 1 or a. \n\nBut the problem allows any combination of these as long as the total length is L. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the tiles must be used to cover the boundary. So the total length must be exactly L. \n\nThe problem requires that there exists a way to choose some number of tiles with lengths 1 or a such that their sum is L. \n\nBut since the tiles can be arranged in any way, the only constraint is that L must be divisible by the greatest common divisor of 1 and a, which is 1. So any a is possible as long as the total length is divisible by a? \n\nWait, no. Because the tiles can be of length 1 or a. So the total length must be expressible as a combination of 1's and a's. \n\nThe minimal way to achieve this is to use as many a's as possible. \n\nThe total length L must be expressible as k*a + m*1, where k and m are non-negative integers. \n\nBut since 1 divides any number, this is always possible. So the only constraint is that a must divide L. \n\nWait, but then why in the first example a=4 is allowed? \n\nWait the first example's L is 12. 12 is divisible by 4. So a=4 should be allowed. But the sample says it's not. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing another constraint. \n\nThe problem says that the tiles must be placed along the boundary. The tiles are 1\u00d7a. So each tile must be placed such that its length along the boundary is either 1 or a. \n\nBut the tiles must also fit into the space perpendicular to the boundary. \n\nThe tiles are 1 unit in one dimension and a in the other. \n\nThe boundary is the perimeter of the rectangle. The tiles must be placed along the perimeter's path, but also must not overlap with the interior. \n\nThe tiles placed along the boundary must have their a-length perpendicular to the boundary's direction. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their a-length is perpendicular to the edge. \n\nFor example, along the top edge (length w), the tiles are placed such that their a-length extends downward into the boundary area. \n\nThe boundary area is one tile thick. So the a-length must be 1. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look at the code provided and see what it's doing. \n\nThe code in program1.py has the following: \n\nThe half_perimeter is w + l -2. \n\nThe code initializes solutions with {1,2}. \n\nThen loops over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nWait, the code is considering divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), not of the total length (2*(w + l -2)). \n\nIn the first example, half_perimeter is 3+5-2=6. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. \n\nThe code starts with solutions {1,2}. \n\nThen for each divisor i up to sqrt(6) (which is ~2.449, so i=2). \n\nFor i=2, the div is 6/2=3. \n\nThen for a in [i, div] (2 and 3). \n\nThen for each a, it checks mod_a = w % a. \n\nWait, the code has: \n\nmod_a = w % a \n\nif mod_a <= 2: \n\n    # TODO \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find a such that a divides the half_perimeter (since the total length is 2*half_perimeter, so a must divide that. So a must divide 2*(w + l -2). \n\nBut the code is looping over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nThe problem requires that a divides the total length (2*(w + l -2)). \n\nSo the correct approach is to find all divisors of 2*(w + l -2), then for each such a, check whether it can be used to tile the boundary. \n\nThe additional constraints are that for each edge length s (either w or l), s mod a must be 0 or 1? Or perhaps the edges must be divisible by a or 1. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to loop over divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2). \n\nBut the total length is 2*(half_perimeter). So the divisors of the total length are the divisors of 2*(half_perimeter). \n\nSo the code should be finding all divisors of 2*(w + l -2). \n\nBut the code is using half_perimeter's divisors. \n\nSo the first step is to correct the code to find divisors of the total length (2*(w + l -2)). \n\nBut the code's current approach is to loop over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nSo the first missing part is to compute the total length as 2*(w + l -2), then find all its divisors. \n\nThe code's current half_perimeter is w + l -2, so the total length is 2*half_perimeter. \n\nSo the code should be finding divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\nBut the code is looping over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nSo the first mistake is that the code is using the wrong value. \n\nThe code's current loop is for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1). \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the total length as total_length = 2*(w + l -2), then find all its divisors. \n\nSo the first step is to change the half_perimeter variable to total_length = 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThen, the code should find all divisors of total_length. \n\nThe code's current solutions set starts with {1,2}. \n\nBut perhaps the initial set is wrong. \n\nThe code's current code has: \n\nsolutions = {1, 2} \n\nBut why 1 and 2? \n\nMaybe the code is trying to include all divisors of the total_length, but the initial set is incorrect. \n\nThe code's loop is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter (which is not the correct value). \n\nSo the first step is to correct the code to use the total_length. \n\nLet me try to think of the correct approach. \n\nThe steps are: \n\n1. Compute total_length = 2*(w + l -2). \n\n2. Find all divisors of total_length. \n\n3. For each divisor a of total_length, check if it can be used to tile the boundary. \n\nThe check for a is that for each edge length s (either w or l), s mod a must be 0 or 1? Or perhaps the edges must be divisible by a or 1. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the tiles can be placed along the edges. \n\nEach edge has length s (either w or l). \n\nThe tiles must be placed along the edge such that their a-length is along the edge. \n\nWait, no. The tiles can be placed in any orientation. \n\nThe key is that the tiles must cover the entire boundary. \n\nThe boundary is a closed loop of length total_length. \n\nThe tiles can be placed in any orientation, so the length along the path can be 1 or a. \n\nThe total length must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that all tiles are of size 1\u00d7a. \n\nEach tile contributes either 1 or a units to the total length. \n\nThe total length must be exactly equal to the sum of the lengths of all tiles. \n\nThe minimal way to achieve this is to use as many a-length tiles as possible. \n\nThe total length must be divisible by a. \n\nSo the only constraint is that a divides the total_length. \n\nBut the sample shows that this is not the case. \n\nIn the first example, a=4 divides 12 (total_length=12), but it's not allowed. \n\nSo there must be another constraint. \n\nAh! The problem says that the tiles are placed on the boundary. The boundary is the perimeter of the rectangle. The tiles must be placed such that they form a continuous path along the perimeter. \n\nEach tile must be placed such that its length along the perimeter is either 1 or a. \n\nBut the tiles must also fit into the space perpendicular to the perimeter. \n\nThe tiles are 1\u00d7a. So when placed along the perimeter, their other dimension (the 1 or a) must be perpendicular to the perimeter's direction. \n\nThe boundary is one tile thick. So the perpendicular dimension must be 1. \n\nWait, the boundary is the outer edge of the bathroom. The tiles must be placed along the perimeter, but their thickness must be 1. \n\nSo the tiles must be placed such that their 1-unit side is perpendicular to the perimeter's direction. \n\nTherefore, the length along the perimeter must be a. \n\nThus, each edge's length must be divisible by a. \n\nAh! This is the missing constraint. \n\nEach edge's length (either w or l) must be divisible by a. \n\nBecause the tiles are placed along the edge with their a-length along the edge. \n\nThe perpendicular dimension is 1, which fits into the boundary's thickness. \n\nSo the constraints are: \n\na must divide the total_length (2*(w + l -2)), \n\nand \n\na must divide both w and l. \n\nWait, no. Because the edges are of length w and l. \n\nWait, the edges are of length w and l. \n\nWait, the vertical edges (left and right) have length l. \n\nThe horizontal edges (top and bottom) have length w. \n\nSo for each edge of length s (either w or l), s must be divisible by a. \n\nThus, a must divide both w and l. \n\nWait, but in the first example, w=3 and l=5. \n\nThe divisors of 3 are 1,3. \n\nThe divisors of 5 are 1,5. \n\nThe common divisors are 1. \n\nBut the sample includes a=2 and 3. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my understanding is still incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). \n\nFor example, the top edge is length w, but the interior is (w-2) in width. So the boundary's top edge is of length w, but the tiles must be placed along the edge's length. \n\nWait, perhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). \n\nIn the first example, w=3, l=5. \n\nThe edges would be 2 and 4. \n\nThen a must divide both 2 and 4. \n\nThe divisors of 2 are 1,2. \n\nThe divisors of 4 are 1,2,4. \n\nCommon divisors are 1,2. \n\nBut the sample includes a=3. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nPerhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). \n\nWait, the problem's first example's valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\nThe total_length is 12. \n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n\nThe valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\nSo the additional constraint is that a must also divide (w-1) or (l-1) or something else. \n\nWait, let's see for a=3 in the first example: \n\nThe edges are of length 3 and 5. \n\n3 mod3 is 0 \u2192 okay. \n\n5 mod3 is 2 \u2192 not divisible. \n\nBut a=3 is allowed. \n\nSo this suggests that the edges don't have to be divisible by a. \n\nHmm, this is really confusing. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look at the sample explanation. \n\nThe first sample's valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\nFor a=3: \n\nThe total_length is 12 \u2192 12/3=4 tiles. \n\nThe edges are 3 and 5. \n\nThe edges of length 3 are divisible by 3. \n\nThe edges of length 5 are not. \n\nBut how can they be tiled? \n\nPerhaps the tiles are placed with their 1-unit side along the edge. \n\nFor the edges of length 5: \n\nEach tile contributes 1 unit. So 5 tiles. \n\nThe total length would be 3 (from the 3-length edges) *2 (two edges) \u2192 6, plus 5*2 (two edges) \u2192 10 \u2192 total 16? No, that doesn't add up. \n\nWait, the total length is 12. \n\nIf a=3, then the total number of tiles is 12/3 =4. \n\nEach tile must contribute 3 units. \n\nSo all tiles must be placed with their a-length along the edge. \n\nThe edges of length 3 can be covered by one tile each (3/3=1). \n\nThe edges of length 5 must be covered by 5/3 tiles, which is not an integer. \n\nSo this is impossible. \n\nBut the sample says a=3 is valid. \n\nThis suggests that my understanding is completely wrong. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the boundary's area is divisible by a. \n\nThe boundary's area is 2*(w + l -2). \n\nWait, no. The boundary's area is the total area minus the interior. \n\nThe area is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2w + 2l -4. \n\nThe tiles are 1\u00d7a, so each tile has area a. \n\nThe total number of tiles must be (2w + 2l -4)/a. \n\nThis must be an integer. \n\nSo a must divide the boundary's area. \n\nThe sample's first case has boundary area 12. \n\n12 divided by a must be an integer. \n\nThe valid a's are 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n\nBut the sample includes 1,2,3. \n\nSo there must be another constraint. \n\nAh! The tiles are placed along the boundary's perimeter, but the tiles must also fit into the space perpendicular to the perimeter. \n\nThe tiles are 1\u00d7a. \n\nThe boundary is one tile thick. So the perpendicular dimension must be 1. \n\nThus, the tiles must be placed such that their a-length is along the perimeter's direction. \n\nTherefore, the length of each edge must be divisible by a. \n\nBut in the first example, a=3: \n\nThe edges of length 3 are divisible by 3. \n\nThe edges of length 5 are not. \n\nSo a=3 can't be used. \n\nBut the sample says it is allowed. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nPerhaps the edges are of length (w-1) and (l-1). \n\nIn the first example, w=3 \u2192 w-1=2, l=5 \u2192 l-1=4. \n\nThe edges are 2 and 4. \n\nFor a=3: \n\n2 mod3 is 2, 4 mod3 is 1 \u2192 neither divisible. \n\nSo a=3 is not allowed. \n\nBut the sample says it is. \n\nThis is really confusing. \n\nPerhaps I should look at the code provided and see what it's doing. \n\nThe code in program1.py has: \n\nsolutions = {1,2} \n\nThen loops over divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2). \n\nFor each divisor i, it checks div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i). \n\nThen for a in [i, div], it checks mod_a = w % a. \n\nIf mod_a <=2, then add a to solutions. \n\nWait, the code is checking whether w mod a is <=2. \n\nPerhaps the condition is that the remainder when dividing w by a is at most 2. \n\nBut why? \n\nThe code's logic is: \n\nFor each divisor a of the half_perimeter (which is w + l -2), \n\ncheck if w mod a is <=2. \n\nIf so, add a to the solutions. \n\nSimilarly, perhaps also check for l mod a? \n\nThe code is incomplete. \n\nThe current code has a comment: \n\n# TODO: Your code here \n\nThe code is in the loop over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nThe code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter, then for each divisor a, check if w mod a is <=2. \n\nBut why? \n\nPerhaps the condition is that the remainder when dividing the edge length by a must be small enough to allow the tiles to be placed with some 1-unit tiles. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to ensure that the remainder when dividing the edge length by a is small enough to allow the tiles to be placed with some 1-unit tiles. \n\nFor example, if the edge length is s, then s mod a must be 0 or 1 or 2. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe sample's first case has w=3, l=5. \n\nThe half_perimeter is 6. \n\nThe divisors are 1,2,3,6. \n\nThe code starts with solutions {1,2}. \n\nThen for i=2 (since sqrt(6) is ~2.449, so i runs up to 2). \n\nFor i=2, div is 3. \n\nSo a can be 2 or 3. \n\nFor a=2: \n\nmod_a = 3%2 =1. \n\n1 <=2 \u2192 yes. So add 2 to solutions. \n\nFor a=3: \n\nmod_a =3%3=0 \u2192 yes. Add 3. \n\nThen the loop continues. \n\nThen for i=3 (since the loop is up to floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2, so it won't reach 3). \n\nSo the solutions are {1,2,3}. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nFor a=6: \n\nIt's a divisor of 6. \n\nBut since the loop only goes up to sqrt(6) ~2, the code would not process it. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1). \n\nSo for half_perimeter=6, sqrt(6) is ~2.449 \u2192 floor is 2. \n\nSo the loop runs from 2 to 2. \n\nThus, the divisors found are 2 and 3 (from i=2). \n\nThe divisor 6 is not processed. \n\nSo the code's current approach is to find all divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), and for each divisor a, check if w mod a is <=2. \n\nBut why is this the condition? \n\nPerhaps the condition is that the remainder when dividing the width by a must be small enough to allow the tiles to be placed with some 1-unit tiles. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to ensure that the remainder when dividing the edge length by a is small enough to allow the tiles to be placed with some 1-unit tiles. \n\nThe code's current logic is: \n\nThe half_perimeter is (w + l -2). \n\nThe total length is 2*(half_perimeter). \n\nThe code is finding divisors of half_perimeter, but the total length is twice that. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach should be to find divisors of the total_length (2*(w + l -2)), and then for each such a, check whether the remainder of w mod a and l mod a are small enough. \n\nBut the code is using half_perimeter's divisors. \n\nSo the first mistake is that the code should be using the total_length instead of half_perimeter. \n\nThe code's half_perimeter should be replaced with total_length = 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThen, the loop should find divisors of total_length. \n\nThe current code's loop is for divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nSo the first step is to change the half_perimeter variable to total_length. \n\nThen, the code's loop should be over the divisors of total_length. \n\nBut how to compute all divisors of total_length? \n\nThe code's current approach is to loop up to sqrt(half_perimeter), but with the new variable, it should loop up to sqrt(total_length). \n\nThe code's current code has: \n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2 \n\nsolutions = {1,2} \n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1): \n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i) \n\n    if mod_i !=0: continue \n\n    for a in [i, div]: \n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2: \n\n            # add to solutions \n\n            solutions.add(a) \n\nBut this is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is: \n\ntotal_length = 2*(w + l -2) \n\nsolutions = set() \n\nthen find all divisors of total_length. \n\nFor each divisor a of total_length: \n\n    check if (w mod a) <=2 and (l mod a) <=2 \n\n    or some other condition. \n\nWait, the sample's first case has a=3. \n\nFor a=3, total_length is 12. \n\n3 divides 12. \n\nw mod a is 3 mod3=0, l mod a is5 mod3=2. \n\nBoth are <=2. \n\nSo the condition would be satisfied. \n\nFor a=4: \n\nw mod4 is 3 mod4=3>2 \u2192 not allowed. \n\nThus, the condition is that both w mod a and l mod a must be <=2. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nThe code's current condition is only checking w mod a. \n\nBut it should also check l mod a. \n\nSo the missing code is to also check l mod a. \n\nThe current code has: \n\nmod_a = w % a \n\nif mod_a <=2: \n\n    # add to solutions \n\nBut it should also check l mod a. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nmod_a_w = w % a \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a_w <=2 and mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nThus, the missing code is to also check the remainder of l mod a. \n\nSo the code's current line after mod_a = w%a is missing the check for l mod a. \n\nThe code's current line is: \n\nif mod_a <=2: \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe correct code would be to also check l mod a. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nWait, but the code is inside a loop over divisors of half_perimeter (which should be total_length). \n\nBut the current code is using half_perimeter = w + l -2. \n\nSo the first step is to change the half_perimeter to total_length = 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThen, the code should loop over the divisors of total_length. \n\nBut the current code is using the half_perimeter's divisors. \n\nSo the first correction is to set total_length = 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThen, the loop should be over the divisors of total_length. \n\nBut the code's current loop is for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1). \n\nSo the first step is to replace half_perimeter with total_length. \n\nThen, the code's loop will find all divisors of total_length. \n\nThen, for each divisor a, check if both w mod a and l mod a are <=2. \n\nThus, the missing code is to also check l mod a and add the condition. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nmod_a = w % a \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a <=2 and mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nThus, the missing code is to compute mod_a_l and add the condition. \n\nThe current code has only the mod_a check. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nWait, but the code is inside a loop over divisors of the total_length. \n\nWait, the code's current code is: \n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1): \n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i) \n\n    if mod_i !=0: continue \n\n    for a in [i, div]: \n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2: \n\n            # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe missing code is to also check l mod a. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nmod_a = w % a \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a <=2 and mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nThus, the missing code is to compute mod_a_l and add the condition. \n\nTherefore, the code's missing part is: \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nWait, but the code is inside the loop over a in [i, div]. \n\nSo the complete code for the TODO is: \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a <=2 and mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nThus, the missing code is to add the check for l mod a and the condition. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nmod_a = w % a \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a <=2 and mod_a_l <=2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the lines to compute mod_a_l and the condition. \n\nNow, the second program (program2.py) is about finding the minimal number of operations to make all elements in a copy of the array equal. \n\nThe problem allows cloning arrays and swapping elements between any copies. \n\nThe minimal operations are needed. \n\nThe code provided is: \n\nfrom collections import* \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0 \n\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here \n\n        print(r) \n\nThe code reads the input, and for each test case, it splits the array, counts the maximum frequency of any element (m), and then enters a loop while m < n. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of operations. \n\nThe minimal operations would involve cloning and swapping. \n\nThe key is that the minimal steps are based on the maximum frequency of an element. \n\nSuppose the maximum frequency is m. \n\nTo make a copy where all elements are the same, we can choose the element with frequency m. \n\nThe number of clones needed is such that the total number of copies allows us to gather enough of that element. \n\nEach clone increases the number of copies by 1. \n\nEach swap can transfer an element from one copy to another. \n\nThe minimal steps would be: \n\nThe number of clones needed is (required_copies -1), where required_copies is the smallest integer such that m * required_copies >= n. \n\nBecause each copy has m elements of the desired type. \n\nThe required_copies is ceil(n/m). \n\nThe number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nBut each clone costs 1 operation. \n\nThen, the swaps are needed to move the elements into one copy. \n\nBut the problem allows swapping between any copies, so the swaps can be done in 0 cost? Or is there a cost for swaps? \n\nThe problem says the cost is the number of operations. Each clone is one operation. Each swap is one operation. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\nThe operations are: \n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. This costs 1 operation. \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. This costs 1 operation. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of operations. \n\nThe minimal way is to first clone until we have enough copies to have enough of the desired element. \n\nSuppose the desired element has count m in the initial array. \n\nTo get a copy with all elements equal to this element, we need to have at least n copies of this element across all copies. \n\nThe initial count is m. \n\nEach clone doubles the number of copies (since each clone adds a new copy). \n\nWait, no. Each clone increases the number of copies by 1. \n\nWait, initially there is 1 copy. \n\nEach clone adds one more copy. \n\nThe total number of copies after k clones is 1 + k. \n\nThe total number of desired elements is m * (1 + k). \n\nWe need m*(1+k) >= n. \n\nThe minimal k is ceil( (n/m) -1 ). \n\nThe number of clones needed is k = ceil( (n/m) -1 ). \n\nBut each clone costs 1. \n\nThen, the swaps are needed to move all desired elements into one copy. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (total_desired - n) ? \n\nWait, the desired is to have one copy with all elements equal to the desired element. \n\nThe total desired elements must be at least n. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of elements that are not the desired element in the final copy. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is: \n\nThe number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (n - m) ? \n\nNo, perhaps the swaps can be done in 0 cost if we can move elements between copies. \n\nWait, the problem allows swapping elements between any copies. \n\nTo form a single copy with all elements desired, we can: \n\n- Clone until we have enough copies to have enough desired elements. \n\n- Then, in the final step, we can swap all non-desired elements out of the target copy into other copies. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of non-desired elements in the target copy. \n\nBut this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. \n\nBut the problem requires the minimal total operations. \n\nThe optimal approach is to first clone until the total number of desired elements is at least n. \n\nThe number of clones needed is k = ceil( (n/m) ) -1. \n\nThe total number of desired elements is m*(k+1). \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (m*(k+1) - n) because we need to have exactly n desired elements in one copy. \n\nBut each swap can move one non-desired element out of the target copy. \n\nThe number of non-desired elements in the target copy is (n - m*(k+1) + n) ? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed to move the excess desired elements into the target copy. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nThe sample input 2 has an example where the answer is 6. \n\nThe sample explanation says that they made 6 operations. \n\nThe code's current approach is to compute m as the maximum frequency. \n\nThe loop is while m <n: \n\nBut the code is incomplete. \n\nThe correct formula for the minimal operations is: \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, the sample input 2 has n=6, m=2 (assuming the array has two 0's). \n\nThe required copies is ceil(6/2) =3. \n\nClones needed: 2 (since 1+2=3 copies). \n\nThen, the number of swaps needed is 6-2 =4? \n\nTotal operations: 2+4=6, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the formula is: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) \n\nBut when m >=n, the answer is 0. \n\nThus, the code should compute this. \n\nThe code's current loop is while m <n: \n\nBut the code needs to compute the required operations. \n\nThe code's current code has: \n\nr=0 \n\nwhile m <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nThe code should compute the required operations as (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, but the formula may be different. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nThus, the code should compute this and return it. \n\nThe code's current loop is not needed. \n\nThe code should compute: \n\nif m >=n: \n\n    print(0) \n\nelse: \n\n    k = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\n    swaps = n - m \n\n    total = k + swaps \n\n    print(total) \n\nBut the sample's case where m=2 and n=6: \n\nk = (6+2-1)//2 -1 \u2192 (7//2)=3 \u2192 3-1=2. \n\nswaps =6-2=4 \u2192 total 6. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nAnother example: if m=3 and n=5: \n\nk = (5+3-1)//3 -1 \u21927//3=2 \u21922-1=1. \n\nswaps=5-3=2 \u2192 total 3. \n\nThus, the code should compute this. \n\nThe code's current loop is not needed. \n\nThe code should compute this formula. \n\nThus, the missing code is to compute this formula and return it. \n\nThe code's current loop is while m <n: \n\nBut the code should compute the formula and return it. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nfrom collections import* \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(a:=a.split()) \n\n    cnt = Counter(a) \n\n    m = max(cnt.values()) \n\n    if m >=n: \n\n        print(0) \n\n    else: \n\n        k = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\n        swaps = n -

m \n\n    print(k + swaps) \n\nprogram3: \n\ndef inv(x): \n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \n\nBut the code for program2's current structure is different. \n\nThe original code for program2 has: \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0 \n\n    while m <n:# TODO: Your code here \n\n        print(r) \n\nThe correct code should replace the loop with the formula. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute the formula and print it. \n\nThe code should be: \n\nfrom collections import* \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(a:=a.split()) \n\n    cnt = Counter(a) \n\n    m = max(cnt.values()) \n\n    if m >=n: \n\n        print(0) \n\n    else: \n\n        k = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\n        swaps = n -

m \n\n    print(k + swaps) \n\nBut the code's current structure has variables like r=0 and a loop. \n\nThe code's current code has: \n\nr=0 \n\nwhile m <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nThe code should compute the formula and print it. \n\nThus, the missing code is to compute the formula and print it, replacing the loop. \n\nThe code's current loop is not needed. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to compute the formula and print it. \n\nThe final answers are: \n\nprogram1: \n\nmod_a_l = l % a \n\nif mod_a <= 2 and mod_a_l <= 2: \n\n    solutions.add(a) \n\nprogram2: \n\nif m >=n: \n\n    print(0) \n\nelse: \n\n    k = (n + m -1) // m -1 \n\n    swaps = n -
