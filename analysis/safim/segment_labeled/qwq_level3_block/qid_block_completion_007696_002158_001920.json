Alternatively, the maximum possible value is the maximum of all possible numbers formed by any substring. To compute this efficiently, we can track for each position the current value as we extend the substring. Here's an idea: iterate through the string, and whenever we encounter a '1', start a new substring from that position.

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the maximum sum a bishop can attack by placing it on any cell. The code provided has some incomplete parts. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe code loops through each cell (i,j) and tries to calculate the sum of all cells the bishop can attack from that position. The current code has four directions: the diagonals. The first while loop handles the top-left direction (decrementing both p and q). The second direction is probably the top-right, but the code is incomplete there. The third and fourth directions are bottom-left and bottom-right, maybe?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nAfter initializing s with l[i][j], they subtract l[p][q] (which is the current cell's value, since p and q start at i,j). Then they move p and q in the direction. Wait, maybe the code is trying to avoid adding the current cell multiple times. Let me see:\n\nThe first loop for the top-left direction: they start at i,j, subtract the current cell (since s was initialized with it?), then move up-left. Wait, the code for the first direction is:\n\ns = l[i][j]\np, q = i,j; s -= l[p][q] \u2192 so s becomes 0 here? Then they loop while p >=0 and q >=0, adding l[p][q] each step. Wait, that might not be right. Because the initial cell is subtracted, but then the loop adds all cells moving up-left. But the bishop's path includes the starting cell. Hmm, maybe the code is structured such that each direction's loop adds all cells except the starting one, so the initial s is the cell's value, then subtract it again, then add all directions. Not sure, but the problem is in the second direction.\n\nThe second direction's code is incomplete. The code after the first direction (top-left) is:\n\np,q = i,j; s -= l[p][q] \u2192 again subtracting the current cell. Then the while loop is for moving up-right (p decreases, q increases?), but the condition is p >=0 and q < m. Wait, the code for the second direction is:\n\nThe code after the first direction's loop is:\n\np,q = i,j; s -= l[p][q]\nwhile p >=0 and q < m:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the current code for the second direction is missing. The first direction was top-left (p and q decreasing). The second direction should be top-right (p decreasing, q increasing). The loop's condition is p >=0 and q < m. So in each step, they move up and right. But the code inside the loop is missing. The existing code after that has the third and fourth directions (bottom-left and bottom-right). \n\nThe problem is that in the second direction's loop, the code is not there. The original code for the first direction's loop adds s += l[p][q], then p and q are decremented. So for the second direction, the loop should do the same: add the current cell's value, then move p -=1 and q +=1. But the code is missing here. So the missing part is:\n\nInside the while loop for the second direction (top-right), the code should be:\n\ns += l[p][q]\np -=1\nq +=1\n\nWait, but the initial p and q are i,j. So when we start, p and q are the current cell. But since we subtracted l[p][q] (the current cell's value) before entering the loop, then in the loop, we add each cell as we move. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe first direction's code after the initial setup:\n\ns starts as l[i][j], then subtract l[p][q] (so s becomes 0?), then the loop adds each cell moving up-left. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code for the first direction (top-left):\n\ns = l[i][j] \u2192 initial sum is the cell's value.\n\nThen p and q are set to i,j, and s -= l[p][q], so s becomes 0. Then the loop starts moving up-left, adding each cell's value. So the first direction's loop adds all cells in the top-left diagonal except the starting cell. But the bishop's attack includes the starting cell. So this approach might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the code is structured such that each direction's loop adds all cells in that direction except the starting cell, and the starting cell is added once. But perhaps the code is adding all four directions, but overlapping at the starting cell. Hmm, maybe the code is incorrect here, but the problem is to fix the missing parts.\n\nThe second direction's loop is missing. The code for the second direction (top-right) should be similar to the first direction. The loop is:\n\nwhile p >=0 and q < m:\n    s += l[p][q]\n    p -=1\n    q +=1\n\nWait, but the initial p and q are i,j. So the first step would add l[i][j], but since we subtracted it earlier, that's okay. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe code for the second direction:\n\nAfter setting p,q to i,j and subtracting l[p][q], the loop starts. The loop adds l[p][q], then moves p down (since p is being decremented) and q up (incremented). Wait, no, p is being decremented (so moving up) and q is being incremented (moving right). So each step adds the cell's value, then moves up-right. So the loop would add all cells in the top-right direction from (i,j), excluding the starting cell (since we subtracted it before the loop). \n\nSo the missing code for the second direction's loop is the lines inside the while loop. The code should be:\n\ns += l[p][q]\np -=1\nq +=1\n\nSo that's the first missing part. Then, the third and fourth directions are already handled. Let me check the third direction's code:\n\nThe third direction is bottom-left (p increases, q decreases):\n\np,q = i,j; s -= l[p][q]\nwhile p <n and q >=0:\n    s += l[p][q]; p +=1; q -=1 \u2192 yes, that's correct.\n\nThe fourth direction is bottom-right (p and q increase):\n\np,q = i,j; s -= l[p][q]\nwhile p <n and q <m:\n    s += l[p][q]; p +=1; q +=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the missing part in program1 is the second direction's loop code. So the code for program1's missing part is the lines inside the while loop for the second direction. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to choose two substrings of a binary string, compute their OR, and find the maximum possible value. The code given starts by reading the input, converting n to an integer (but that's probably a mistake, since the first line is n, the second is the string). Wait, looking at the code:\n\nThe first line is input(), which reads the first line (n). Then n is set to int(input(),2). Wait, that's wrong. Because the first input line is the integer n, but the code is converting it as a binary string. That's a mistake. The second line is the string s. So the code is incorrect here. But the problem says to complete the code, so perhaps the first line is read as s, but the code is wrong. However, the user's code may have errors, and we need to fix the missing parts. \n\nThe code for program2 starts with:\n\ninput()  # reads the first line (n)\nn = int(input(),2)  # which is wrong, because the second line is the string s. So this line is incorrect. But perhaps the code is supposed to read the string s. \n\nWait, the problem says the first line is n, the second is s. So the code should read s as the second line. The code's first line is input() which reads the first line (n), but then the next line is n = int(input(),2) which reads the second line (the string s) as a binary number. That's wrong. So the code is incorrect here, but perhaps the user's code has other missing parts. \n\nThe code's next part is:\n\nans=0\nfor i in range(1,64):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum OR of two substrings. The maximum possible OR would be the maximum possible value achievable by any two numbers formed by the substrings. Since the OR of two numbers can be as high as the maximum possible number formed by any substring. Because if one substring is the maximum possible number, then OR with anything else won't decrease it. So the maximum possible OR is simply the maximum possible value of any single substring. Because choosing that substring twice would give the same value, and OR with another can't exceed it. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible OR is the maximum possible value of any substring, because if you have a substring with value X, then choosing that and any other substring (including itself) will have OR at least X. So the maximum possible OR is the maximum possible value of any substring. \n\nWait, but the problem says to choose two substrings. So the maximum OR is the maximum between all pairs of substrings. But the maximum possible OR would be the maximum of all possible pairs. However, the maximum possible value of a single substring is the maximum possible, so the OR of that with any other (including itself) would be that value. So the maximum OR is the maximum value of any substring. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of any substring, then outputting that in binary. \n\nSo the code can be simplified to find the maximum substring value. \n\nBut the code given is trying to loop over bits. Let me think. The code's approach might be to track the bits set in any substring. The maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible bits set in any substring. Because if any substring has a bit set, then choosing that substring and another that has that bit set would contribute to the OR. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible bits present in any substring. Because if any substring has a bit set, then choosing that substring and another (even the same) would have that bit set in the OR. So the maximum possible OR is the OR of all bits present in any substring. \n\nWait, but a substring can be any contiguous part of the string. So the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible numbers formed by any substring. The maximum possible value is the maximum possible number in the string, but the OR of all possible numbers would be the bitwise OR of all possible numbers. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example. Suppose the string is '101'. The substrings are '1', '0', '1', '10', '01', '101'. Their values are 1,0,1,2,1,5. The OR of all these is 7 (binary 111). But the maximum possible OR between two substrings would be 5 | 5 =5, but 5 | 2 is 7. So the maximum OR is 7. \n\nAh, so the maximum OR is the OR of all possible bits that appear in any substring. Because if any substring has a bit set, then there exists two substrings (the one with that bit and another that has it) such that their OR includes that bit. So the maximum possible OR is the OR of all bits present in any substring. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible OR is the bitwise OR of all possible numbers formed by any substring. Wait, no. Wait, the OR of all possible numbers would be the same as the OR of all bits that are set in any substring. Because if any substring has a bit set, then that bit is present in the OR. \n\nSo the maximum possible OR is the bitwise OR of all possible bits set in any substring. \n\nTherefore, the approach is to compute all the bits that are set in any substring, and the maximum OR is the OR of all those bits. \n\nTo compute this, we can track for each bit position whether it is present in any substring. \n\nAlternatively, for each position in the string, we can consider all possible substrings starting at that position and compute their values, then track the bits set. \n\nBut for large n (like 1e6), this approach would be too slow. \n\nThe problem's constraints for program2 have test cases with n up to 1e6, so we need an O(n) or O(n log something) solution. \n\nHmm, the code given in program2 has a loop over i from 1 to 63 (since 64 is the max bits for 1e6 length). The idea might be to track for each bit whether it can be set in some substring. \n\nAlternatively, for each bit position, determine if there exists a substring that has that bit set. The maximum possible OR is the OR of all such bits. \n\nSo for each bit from 0 to 60 (since 2^60 is over 1e18, which is manageable), check if there's a substring where that bit is set. \n\nHow to do that efficiently?\n\nFor a given bit k (like 2^k), we can look for a substring where the substring's value has that bit set. \n\nThe substring's value is the binary number formed by the substring. The bit k is set in the value if the substring has a '1' in the (k+1)th position from the end (since the substring's value is the binary number). \n\nAlternatively, the substring must have a '1' in some position such that the distance from the end of the substring is at least k. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to check for a bit k is to see if there exists a substring of length at least (k+1) where the (k+1)th character from the end is '1'. \n\nAlternatively, for a bit k (value 2^k), the substring must have a '1' in the (position) such that the substring's length is at least (k+1), and the (length - k -1)th character is '1'? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible value of a substring is the maximum possible number formed by any substring. The maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible bits set in any substring. \n\nTo find all bits that are set in any substring, we can note that for a bit position b (like 2^b), there exists a substring where the substring's value has that bit set. \n\nTo check this, we can look for a '1' in the string such that there are at least b zeros to the right (or left?) to form a substring of length b+1. \n\nAlternatively, for each position where there is a '1', the maximum possible bit that can be set in a substring starting at that position is determined by the length of the substring. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible bit for any substring is the maximum possible length of a substring starting at a '1'. \n\nWait, for example, if there is a '1' at position i, then the substring starting at i and of length L will have a value of at least 2^{L-1}. So the maximum possible bit is the maximum (L-1) over all possible substrings starting with '1'. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible OR is the bitwise OR of all bits up to the maximum possible length of a substring starting with '1'. \n\nWait, but the maximum possible bit is the maximum (length of a substring starting with '1') minus 1. \n\nSo the maximum possible OR is (2^max_length -1). \n\nWait, for example, if the maximum possible substring length starting with '1' is L, then the maximum value is 2^{L} -1 (if the substring is all 1's). But the maximum possible bit would be L-1. \n\nWait, the maximum possible value of a substring is the maximum over all substrings of their numeric value. The maximum possible OR is the maximum possible value of any substring, because choosing that substring and any other (including itself) will give that value. \n\nWait, that's correct. Because if there's a substring with value X, then choosing that substring twice gives X | X = X. So the maximum possible OR is the maximum value of any substring. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of any substring of the input string. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows: iterate over all possible substrings, compute their numeric value, track the maximum. \n\nBut for n=1e6, this is O(n^2), which is way too slow. \n\nHmm, so the problem requires an O(n) or O(n log something) solution. \n\nWait, the maximum possible value of a substring is the maximum value of all possible prefixes of the string starting at each position. \n\nWait, the maximum value is achieved by the longest possible substring starting with a '1', because the longer the substring, the higher the value. \n\nWait, for example, the substring '1' is 1, '10' is 2, '100' is 4, etc. So the maximum value is the maximum between all possible substrings. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum value is the maximum of all possible numbers formed by the substrings. \n\nThe maximum possible value is the maximum between all possible substrings. To find this efficiently, note that the maximum value is the maximum of all possible prefixes of the string starting at each position. \n\nWait, because the maximum value for a substring starting at position i is the value of the substring s[i..j], which is maximized when the substring is as long as possible starting with '1'. \n\nWait, but even if the substring is longer but has a '0' in the first position, it won't contribute. \n\nWait, the maximum value for a substring starting at position i is the value of the substring s[i..i + L -1], where L is the length. The maximum value for that starting position is when the substring is as long as possible, but only if the first character is '1'. \n\nSo for each position i where s[i] is '1', the maximum possible value starting at i is the value of the substring from i to the end of the string. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value is the maximum among all possible substrings starting with '1' and of maximum possible length. \n\nWait, but even a shorter substring starting with '1' might have a higher value if the bits are set. For example, '111' is 7, but '1000' is 8. So the longer substring starting with '1' may not always be better. \n\nHmm, so the maximum value is the maximum of all possible substrings. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAn efficient way is to note that the maximum value is the maximum of all possible prefixes of the string starting at each position. \n\nWait, for each position i where s[i] is '1', the substring starting at i can be as long as possible. The value of the substring s[i..j] is the binary number formed by those bits. \n\nThe maximum value for a substring starting at i is the value of the entire substring from i to the end. \n\nWait, but even if the substring is longer, but the bits after are 0, it might not be better. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible value is the maximum of all possible numbers formed by any substring. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can track for each position the current value as we extend the substring. \n\nHere's an idea: iterate through the string, and whenever we encounter a '1', start a new substring from that position. For each such starting position, we can compute the value of the substring as we extend it to the right. \n\nBut for n=1e6, this would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum possible value is the maximum between all possible prefixes of the string starting at each position. \n\nWait, the maximum possible value is the maximum of all possible numbers formed by any substring. \n\nThe maximum possible number is the maximum between all possible substrings. \n\nThe maximum possible number is the maximum between all possible substrings. \n\nThe maximum possible number is the maximum between all possible substrings. \n\nWait, the maximum possible number is the maximum of all possible numbers formed by any substring. \n\nThe maximum possible number is the

This chessboard is a grid $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns with each cell having a non-negative integer written on it. Timur's challenge is to place a bishop on the board such that the sum of all cells attacked by the bishop is maximal. The bishop attacks in all directions diagonally, and there are $$$f(v, u)$$$ for the number of values that appear exactly once on the edges of a simple path between vertices $$$v$$ and $$$u$$$.Calculate the sum of all possible placements of the bishop.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$ \u2014 the number of test cases.
