  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the minimum number of operations to turn all elements in the array to zero. The operations allow selecting two different elements. If they are equal, one becomes zero. Otherwise, both become the minimum of the two. \n\nLooking at the code provided, the initial part reads the input. The code has a loop that processes the array a. The while loop pops elements from a, and checks if the current element q is present elsewhere. The TODO is inside this loop. The existing code seems to be trying to count something, but I'm not sure exactly what.\n\nWait, the code's structure is a bit confusing. Let me think about the problem again. The key is to find the minimal steps. Let's think of the approach. \n\nThe problem requires that all elements become zero. The operations can either reduce two equal elements (turning one to zero) or when they are different, set both to the min. The optimal strategy probably involves reducing the larger elements first. \n\nHmm, maybe the minimal steps depend on the number of non-zero elements and their frequencies. For example, if all elements are the same, then each pair requires one operation to reduce their count by one (since each operation on two equal elements reduces one to zero). But when there are different elements, merging them into the smaller one might help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by the maximum element's count? Or maybe the number of operations is the sum over each element's contribution. \n\nWait, looking at the sample input given in the problem's note: the first example has [1, 2, 3]. The steps were 4. Let's see how that works. \n\nThe approach taken in the code might be trying to track the number of non-zero elements and how they can be paired. The code's current structure is a bit unclear. Let me look at the code again. \n\nThe code starts with for n in [*open(0)][2::2], which reads every second line starting from the second line (since the first line is the number of test cases). Then, for each test case, it splits the line into a list a. Then, b is the length of a, c is the count of zeros. \n\nThen, while a is not empty, it pops q (the last element). If a.count(q) >0 (meaning there's another occurrence of q in the remaining a?), then the TODO is here. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to count the number of pairs needed? Or maybe the code is trying to compute how many operations are needed for each element. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the number of operations required based on the frequency of each number. \n\nWait, the final print statement is print(b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c). Hmm, that's a bit cryptic. Let's see. The initial code's logic might be incorrect, and the TODO is part of the loop that's supposed to compute some variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of operations as the sum of (frequency of each non-zero number minus 1), but that might not be right. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum over all elements (excluding zeros) of (count of each number divided by 2?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that all elements become zero. Let's think of the process. Each time two elements are equal, you can turn one into zero. So for a group of k elements with the same value, you need (k-1) operations to turn them all into zero. Because each operation reduces the count by one (since you pair two, turn one to zero). So for k elements, you need k-1 operations. \n\nBut when elements are different, you can pair them to turn them into the minimum. So perhaps the strategy is to first process the largest elements first, so that they can be reduced to smaller ones. \n\nWait, the problem allows choosing any two elements. So when you have elements of different values, you can pair them to turn both into the smaller one. This way, you can reduce the larger elements into smaller ones, which can then be paired again. \n\nThe key idea might be that the minimal steps are the sum over all elements (non-zero) of (their value divided by the minimal element?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps required would be the sum of (each element's value divided by the minimal element in the array) minus something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by the number of elements and the minimal element. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the process as follows: \n\nThe minimal element in the array is m. All elements must eventually be turned into m, then paired to turn into zero. \n\nWait, but when you pair two elements a and b where a < b, you set both to a. So, to reduce all elements to m, you can do this by pairing larger elements with m. \n\nSuppose the minimal element is m. Then, all elements can be reduced to m by pairing with m. Each such operation reduces the larger element to m. \n\nOnce all elements are m, then you need (count of m -1) operations to turn them all to zero. \n\nSo the total steps would be (sum over (each element - m) // m) + (count_m -1). \n\nWait, but each time you pair a larger element with m, you turn both into m. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a pair where one is m and the other is larger, then since they are not equal, you set both to min(m, a) which is m. So each such operation reduces the larger element to m, but the m remains as m. \n\nSo for each element a_i > m, you need (a_i - m) / m steps? Or perhaps (a_i // m) steps? \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose m is the minimal element. For an element a_i which is larger than m, how many operations are needed to reduce it to m? \n\nWait, each time you pair it with m, it becomes m. So actually, you can do it in one step. Because pairing a_i (which is larger than m) with m, you set both to m. So the a_i becomes m, and the m stays as m. \n\nSo for each element a_i > m, you need one operation to reduce it to m. \n\nTherefore, the total steps would be: \n\n(number of elements greater than m) + (count_m -1). \n\nWait, but the count_m includes the original m's. \n\nWait, the count_m is the number of elements equal to m (including the original ones). \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\nFor all elements not equal to m, each requires one operation to turn into m. So that's (total elements - count_m) steps. \n\nThen, once all elements are m, you need (count_m -1) steps to turn them all into zero. \n\nSo total steps: (total elements - count_m) + (count_m -1) = total elements -1. \n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because in the sample input given in the problem's note, the first test case is [1,2,3]. The minimal element is 1. \n\nSo according to this formula, the steps would be (3-1) + (1-1) = 2 +0 =2, but the sample answer is 4. \n\nHmm, so that approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my reasoning must be incorrect. Let me re-examine the sample. \n\nSample input 1: [1,2,3]. The steps taken were 4. \n\nLet me see the steps again. \n\nFirst operation: pick 1 and 2. Since they are not equal, set both to 1. Now the array is [1,1,3]. \n\nSecond operation: since two 1's, one becomes 0. Now [0,1,3]. \n\nThird operation: 0 and 1. Since they are not equal, set both to 0. Now [0,0,3]. \n\nFourth operation: 0 and 3. Set both to 0. Now all zeros. \n\nWait, but according to the steps I thought, the first step reduces 2 to 1, so after first step, the array has two 1's and a 3. \n\nThen, the third step is between 0 and 1. So the 1 becomes 0. \n\nHmm, so the formula I thought of is not correct. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps required. \n\nEach operation can either: \n\n- If two elements are equal, turn one into 0. This takes 1 operation and reduces the count of that number by 1. \n\n- If they are different, turn both into the minimum. This takes 1 operation and may create more elements of the minimum. \n\nThe goal is to turn all elements to zero. \n\nThe key is to find the minimal steps. \n\nLet me think of the process as follows: \n\nThe minimal steps would be the sum over all elements (excluding zeros) of (their value divided by the minimal element in the array?), but perhaps not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be determined by the number of elements and the minimal element. \n\nWait, in the sample input, the minimal element is 1. The steps needed were 4. \n\nThe formula (n-1) + (sum (a_i / m) -1) ? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element. \n\nIn the sample, sum is 6, divided by 1 gives 6, but the answer is 4. So that's not it. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the process as needing to eliminate all non-zero elements. \n\nEach time you can either: \n\n- When two elements are equal, you can eliminate one (turn it to zero). \n\n- When they are different, you can turn both into the smaller one. \n\nThe optimal strategy would be to first reduce all elements to the minimal element, then eliminate them. \n\nWait, but how to reduce elements to the minimal. \n\nSuppose the minimal element is m. \n\nFor any element a_i > m, you can pair it with m, turning both into m. So each such a_i requires one operation to become m. \n\nOnce all elements are m, then you need (count_m -1) operations to turn them all to zero. \n\nSo total steps would be (number of elements greater than m) + (count_m -1). \n\nIn the sample, the elements greater than m (1) are 2 and 3. So 2 elements. count_m is 1 (the initial 1). \n\nSo steps would be 2 + (1-1) = 2. But the sample answer is 4. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, so that approach is wrong. \n\nWait, in the sample, after the first step, the array becomes [1,1,3]. So the count_m (1) is now 2. \n\nThen, the third element (3) is still there. So perhaps the process requires more steps. \n\nWait, after the first step, the 3 is still there. So to reduce that 3 to 1, you need another operation. \n\nWait, in the first step, the 2 was turned into 1, but the 3 remains. \n\nSo to reduce the 3 to 1, you need to pair it with the existing 1. \n\nSo that would take another operation. \n\nSo for the 3, you need two operations: first with the original 1 (turning into 1), then with another 1 (turning into 1 again?), but that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nThe third element is 3. To turn it into 1, you can pair it with one of the 1's. \n\nPairing 3 and 1 (since they are not equal), so both become 1. That takes one operation. \n\nSo for the 3, it takes one operation. \n\nSo the elements greater than m (1) are 2 and 3. Each requires one operation. \n\nSo total steps for reducing to m: 2 (for 2 and 3) plus the 3's step? Wait, no, the 3 is handled in one step. \n\nWait, the 2 and 3 each take one step. So total steps to get all to m (1) is 2 (for 2 and 3). \n\nThen, the count_m is now 3 (the original 1, the converted 2, and the converted 3). \n\nSo then, to eliminate all 1's, you need (3-1) = 2 steps. \n\nTotal steps: 2 + 2 =4, which matches the sample. \n\nAh! So the formula is correct. \n\nWait, so the formula is: \n\nsteps = (number of elements greater than m) + (count_m_after_reduction -1). \n\nWait, but count_m_after_reduction is the original count_m plus the number of elements greater than m. \n\nBecause each element greater than m is turned into m. \n\nSo count_m_after_reduction = original_count_m + (n - original_count_m) (since all elements except original m's are turned into m). \n\nWait, no. The elements greater than m are turned into m, so the total count_m_after is original_count_m + (number of elements greater than m). \n\nSo the total steps would be: \n\n(number of elements greater than m) + (original_count_m + (number of elements greater than m) -1) \n\n= (number of elements greater than m) + (original_count_m + (n - original_count_m) -1) \n\nWait, because the number of elements greater than m is (n - original_count_m - zeros). Wait, but zeros are already zero. \n\nWait, the problem's input includes zeros. So the initial array has some zeros. \n\nWait, the problem says that the initial array can have zeros. \n\nHmm, so the formula needs to account for the existing zeros. \n\nWait, the zeros can be used in operations. \n\nWait, in the problem's first sample, the initial array is [1,2,3], so no zeros. \n\nThe minimal element is 1. \n\nThe number of elements greater than m (1) is 2 (2 and 3). \n\nOriginal count_m is 1. \n\nSo steps: 2 (for converting 2 and 3 to 1) plus (1+2 -1) = 2 + 2 =4. \n\nWhich matches. \n\nAnother example: suppose the array is [2,2]. \n\nThe minimal element is 2. \n\nNumber of elements greater than m: 0. \n\nOriginal count_m is 2. \n\nSteps: 0 + (2-1) =1. \n\nWhich is correct: one operation to turn one into zero. \n\nAnother example: [3,3,3]. \n\nOriginal count_m is 3. \n\nSteps: 0 (no elements greater than m) + (3-1) =2. \n\nYes, two operations: first pair two 3's, turn one to zero. Then pair the remaining two (3 and 0?), but wait, after first operation, you have two 3's and one zero? \n\nWait, no. Let's see. \n\nFirst operation: pick two 3's. Since they are equal, turn one to zero. Now array is [3,3,0]. \n\nSecond operation: pick the two 3's again. Turn one to zero. Now array is [3,0,0]. \n\nThird operation: pick the 3 and a zero. They are not equal, so set both to 0. Now all zeros. \n\nWait, that's three steps. But according to the formula, it would be 0 + (3-1) =2. \n\nHmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait, what's wrong here? \n\nWait, in the case of three 3's. \n\nThe minimal element is 3. \n\nSo according to the formula, steps would be 0 (no elements greater than m) plus (3-1) =2. \n\nBut the actual steps needed are 3. \n\nHmm, so the formula is incorrect. \n\nWait, let's see the steps again. \n\nFirst, the three 3's. \n\nFirst operation: pick two 3's. They are equal, so turn one to zero. Now array is [3,3,0]. \n\nSecond operation: pick the two 3's again. Turn one to zero. Now [3,0,0]. \n\nThird operation: pick the remaining 3 and a zero. They are not equal, so set both to 0. Now all zeros. \n\nTotal steps: 3. \n\nBut according to the formula, it should be 2. \n\nHmm, so the formula is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my previous reasoning is flawed. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the process for the case of all elements equal to m. \n\nSuppose there are k elements of m. \n\nEach operation on two of them reduces the count by 1. \n\nSo to turn all to zero, you need (k-1) operations. \n\nBut in the case of three elements, that would be 2 steps. But in reality, it takes 3 steps. \n\nWait, why? \n\nWait, let's see again. \n\nThree elements: [3,3,3]. \n\nFirst operation: pick two, turn one to zero. Now [3,3,0]. \n\nSecond operation: pick the two 3's again, turn one to zero. Now [3,0,0]. \n\nThird operation: pick the remaining 3 and a zero. They are not equal, so set both to 0. \n\nWait, but in the third operation, the 3 and 0 are not equal, so they become min(3,0) which is 0. So both become zero. \n\nSo that's one operation. \n\nWait, so after the second operation, the array is [3,0,0]. \n\nThird operation: pick the 3 and any zero. \n\nThey are not equal, so both become 0. \n\nSo that's one operation. \n\nTotal steps: 2 (first two steps) +1 (third) =3. \n\nHmm, so the formula (k-1) is not sufficient. \n\nWait, the problem is that when you have a single element left (the 3 in the third step), you can pair it with a zero. \n\nWait, but the zero is already there. \n\nSo the formula for the case when all elements are m is (k-1) steps? \n\nWait, in the case of three elements, the first two steps reduce to one 3 and two zeros. Then, the third step uses the remaining 3 and a zero. \n\nSo that's 3 steps. \n\nHmm, so the formula is not (k-1). \n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is (k-1) plus the number of zeros? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps when all elements are m is (k-1) + (number of zeros?), but I'm not sure. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the number of operations required to turn all elements into zero. \n\nEach operation can either: \n\n- If two elements are equal, turn one into zero. This reduces the count of that number by 1. \n\n- If they are different, turn both into the smaller one. This can be used to decrease the value of elements. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to first reduce all elements to the minimal value, then eliminate them. \n\nLet me re-calculate the steps for the three 3's case. \n\nThe minimal element is 3. \n\nSo, to reduce all elements to m (3), there are no elements greater than m, so that part is 0 steps. \n\nThen, to eliminate the three 3's: \n\nEach operation on two 3's reduces the count by 1. \n\nSo for three elements, first operation reduces to two 3's and a zero. \n\nSecond operation reduces to one 3 and two zeros. \n\nThird operation: the remaining 3 and a zero. \n\nWait, but in the third operation, since they are not equal, you set both to 0. So that's one operation. \n\nSo total steps for elimination: 2 (from the first two steps) plus 1 (third step) =3. \n\nHmm, so the formula for elimination is (k) steps when k is the count of m? \n\nWait, for k elements of m, the steps needed are (k-1) + 1? \n\nWait, no. Let me see for k=2: \n\nTwo elements of m. \n\nFirst operation: turn one to zero. So one step. \n\nTotal steps: 1. Which is (2-1) =1. \n\nSo that works. \n\nFor k=3: \n\nFirst two steps (each reduces by one) gives 2 steps, but then the third step is needed. \n\nWait, that's 3 steps. \n\nHmm, so the formula for elimination is (k-1) + (if there are other elements?) \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elimination steps are (k-1) plus the number of zeros? \n\nNot sure. \n\nHmm, perhaps the elimination steps are (k-1) when there are no other elements except the m's. \n\nWait, in the three 3's case, after two steps, you have one 3 and two zeros. \n\nThen, the third step is needed to eliminate the last 3. \n\nSo that's (3-1) +1? \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the elimination steps are (k-1) plus the number of zeros? \n\nWait, in the three 3's case, after two steps, there are two zeros. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps required. \n\nThe minimal steps can be calculated as follows: \n\nThe minimal element m. \n\nThe total steps are: \n\n(number of elements greater than m) + (sum over all elements (a_i / m) -1) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the steps needed to reduce all elements to m is (sum (a_i - m) / m) ? \n\nWait, for each element a_i > m, you need (a_i - m)/m steps? \n\nWait, in the first sample, a_i's are 1,2,3. m=1. \n\nThe elements greater than m are 2 and 3. \n\nEach requires (2-1)/1 =1 step. So total 2 steps. \n\nThen, the elimination steps for 3 elements (1+2 converted to 1, plus original 1) is 3 elements of 1. \n\nElimination steps: 3-1 =2 steps. \n\nTotal steps 2+2=4. Which matches. \n\nIn the three 3's case, m=3. \n\nElements greater than m: none. \n\nElimination steps: 3-1=2 steps. \n\nBut in reality, it takes 3 steps. \n\nHmm, discrepancy again. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not working. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the process of elimination. \n\nWhen you have k elements of m, you can pair them in pairs. Each pair reduces the count by 1. \n\nSo for k elements, you need (k-1) operations. \n\nBut in the three 3's case, that would be 2 steps. \n\nBut in reality, you need three steps. \n\nWait, why? \n\nWait, let's see again. \n\nThree 3's: \n\nStep 1: pair two 3's \u2192 one becomes 0. Now two 3's and one 0. \n\nStep 2: pair the two 3's \u2192 one becomes 0. Now one 3 and two 0's. \n\nStep 3: pair the remaining 3 with a 0. Since they are not equal, both become 0. \n\nSo that's three steps. \n\nAh, so the third step is not part of the elimination of the m's, but is part of the process of eliminating the last m. \n\nWait, but the third step is using a zero. \n\nHmm, so the elimination steps for the m's are (k-1) steps, but then you have to do an extra step for each remaining m? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is (number of elements greater than m) + (k) where k is the count of m. \n\nWait, in the first sample: 2 +3 \u2192 5? No, that's not right. \n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern or find a different approach. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. \n\nThe minimal steps required is the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element, but subtract something. \n\nWait, in the first sample, sum is 6, divided by 1 gives 6. But the answer is 4. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are (sum of all elements) minus (the minimal element) multiplied by the number of elements. \n\nWait, 6 - 1*3 =3. Not matching. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the number of operations needed to turn all elements into zero. \n\nEach operation can either: \n\n- When two elements are equal, reduce one to zero. \n\n- When different, turn both into the smaller. \n\nThe key is to minimize the steps. \n\nThe optimal way is to first reduce all elements to the minimal element m. \n\nEach element a_i > m requires one operation to turn into m (by pairing with m). \n\nOnce all elements are m, then the number of operations needed is (count_m -1). \n\nWait, but in the three 3's case, count_m is 3. So (3-1)=2 steps. But the actual steps needed are 3. \n\nHmm, so that formula is wrong. \n\nWait, but in the three 3's case, after reducing to all m (3), the count is 3. \n\nThen, to eliminate them: \n\nFirst operation: pair two 3's \u2192 one becomes 0. Now two 3's and one 0. \n\nSecond operation: pair the two 3's \u2192 one becomes 0. Now one 3 and two 0's. \n\nThird operation: pair the remaining 3 with a 0 \u2192 both become 0. \n\nSo total steps for elimination: 3 steps. \n\nAh, so the formula (count_m -1) is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is (count_m) steps? \n\nWait, 3 steps for count_m=3. \n\nYes, but for count_m=2, it would be 2 steps? \n\nWait, two elements of m: \n\nFirst operation: pair them \u2192 one becomes 0. So one step. \n\nSo (count_m -1) is correct here. \n\nHmm, so why the discrepancy for count_m=3? \n\nWait, when count_m is 3, the steps needed are 2 (from the first two steps) plus one more step (third step). \n\nThe third step is because there's an odd number of elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is ceil(count_m / 1) -1? No. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is (count_m -1) + (count_m % 2). \n\nWait, for count_m=3 \u2192 2 +1=3. \n\ncount_m=2 \u21921+0=1. \n\ncount_m=1 \u21920+0=0. \n\nHmm, that works. \n\nSo the total steps would be: \n\nsteps = (number of elements greater than m) + (count_m -1) + (count_m % 2). \n\nWait, but in the first sample, count_m after reduction is 3 (original count was 1, plus 2 elements greater than m). \n\ncount_m is 3 \u2192 (3-1) +1 =3. \n\nAdding the 2 steps for the elements greater than m gives 2+3=5, which is not correct. \n\nHmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for elimination is (count_m) steps. \n\nThen for three elements, it's 3 steps. \n\nBut for two elements, it's 2 steps, which is wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the elimination steps as follows. \n\nEach time you have a pair of m's, you can eliminate one. \n\nSo for k elements of m, you need (k-1) steps. \n\nBut when there's an odd number of m's, the last one has to be paired with a zero. \n\nWait, but the zero is already present. \n\nWait, in the three m's case: \n\nAfter two steps, you have one m and two zeros. \n\nThe third step is to pair the m with a zero. \n\nThis is an operation where the two are not equal, so they become min(m,0) \u2192 0. \n\nSo this step is not part of the elimination of the m's, but is needed to eliminate the last m. \n\nSo the total steps for elimination are (k-1) +1 =k. \n\nWait, but in the case of two m's: \n\nAfter one step, you have one m and one zero. \n\nThen, you need to pair them, which takes one more step. \n\nTotal steps: 2. \n\nBut according to the formula (k) steps, that would be 2 steps. Which matches. \n\nWait, but in the two m's case, the first step reduces to one m and one zero. \n\nThen, the second step pairs them, turning both to zero. \n\nSo total steps for elimination is 2 steps. \n\nWhich is indeed k steps (k=2). \n\nAh! So the formula for elimination steps is k steps. \n\nWait, so for k elements of m, the elimination steps are k steps. \n\nWait, but in the case of one m: \n\nYou have one m. To eliminate it, you need to pair it with another element. But there are no other elements. \n\nWait, but the problem states that n \u22652. \n\nWait, if there's only one m and the rest are zeros, then you can pair the m with a zero. \n\nSo for one m: \n\nPair with a zero \u2192 both become zero. \n\nSo one step. \n\nWhich is k=1 \u2192 steps 1. \n\nSo the formula holds. \n\nSo the elimination steps are exactly k steps. \n\nWait, so for k elements of m, the steps needed are k steps. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThree m's: \n\nSteps needed to eliminate them: \n\nFirst step: pair two m's \u2192 one becomes 0. Now two m's (wait, no, after first step, you have one m and one zero, and the third m? \n\nWait, initial three m's: \n\nStep 1: pair two m's \u2192 one becomes 0. Now two m's? No, after the operation, the two m's become one 0 and one m? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, when you have two m's and you perform an operation on them (since they are equal), you turn one into zero. So after first step, you have two m's? No, one m and one zero. \n\nWait, three m's: \n\nStep 1: pick two m's \u2192 turn one to zero. Now you have two m's and one zero? No, wait, the two m's become one m and one zero. \n\nWait, the two m's are selected. Since they are equal, you choose one to turn into zero. So after step 1, you have two m's? No, one m and one zero. \n\nWait, the initial three m's: \n\nAfter first operation (pair two m's), you have one m (the other becomes zero). So the array is [m, m, 0] \u2192 no, wait, the two m's are turned into one m and one zero. \n\nWait, the two m's are selected. The operation reduces one to zero. So the two m's become one m and one zero. So the array after first step is [m, 0, m]? \n\nWait, the third m is still there. \n\nAh, right! The third m is still present. \n\nWait, the three m's are all m. \n\nWhen you pick two of them (say first and second), you turn one into zero. So the array becomes [0, m, m]. \n\nThen, step 2: pick the two m's (second and third). Turn one into zero. Now array is [0,0, m]. \n\nStep 3: pair the remaining m with a zero. \n\nSo three steps. \n\nSo for three m's, it's three steps. \n\nSo the formula is indeed k steps. \n\nSo the total steps are: \n\nsteps = (number of elements greater than m) + (count_m_after_reduction). \n\nWait, count_m_after_reduction is the total number of m's after reducing all elements to m. \n\nWhich is equal to the original count_m plus the number of elements greater than m. \n\nBecause each element greater than m is turned into m. \n\nSo count_m_after = original_count_m + (n - original_count_m - zeros). \n\nWait, but zeros are already zero. \n\nWait, the elements greater than m are those not zero and not equal to m. \n\nSo the number of elements greater than m is (total non-zero elements - original_count_m). \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to compute count_m_after as (original_count_m + (total elements - original_count_m - zeros_count)). \n\nWait, zeros are already zero, so they are not counted in the elements greater than m. \n\nWait, the elements greater than m are those a_i > m and a_i !=0. \n\nSo the number of elements greater than m is (total non-zero elements - original_count_m). \n\nThus, count_m_after = original_count_m + (number of elements greater than m) \n\n= original_count_m + (total_non_zero - original_count_m) \n\n= total_non_zero. \n\nWait, because the elements greater than m are turned into m, so all non-zero elements become m. \n\nSo count_m_after = (original_count_m + (total_non_zero - original_count_m)) \n\n= total_non_zero. \n\nSo the count_m_after is the number of non-zero elements in the original array. \n\nWait, because all non-zero elements are either m or greater than m. \n\nSo after reduction, all non-zero elements become m. \n\nThus, count_m_after = (original_count_m + (total_non_zero - original_count_m)) \n\n= total_non_zero. \n\nSo the elimination steps are count_m_after steps. \n\nThe steps to reduce to m are the number of elements greater than m (since each requires one step). \n\nThus total steps = (number of elements greater than m) + count_m_after \n\n= (number of elements greater than m) + (total_non_zero) \n\nWait, because count_m_after is total_non_zero. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIn the first sample: \n\nOriginal array [1,2,3]. \n\nm=1. \n\nnumber of elements greater than m: 2 (2 and 3). \n\ntotal_non_zero is 3. \n\nSo steps: 2+3 =5. But the sample answer is 4. \n\nHmm, that's not correct. \n\nHmm, so this approach is also wrong. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps required. \n\nThe minimal steps required is the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element, but subtract the number of zeros. \n\nWait, in the first sample, sum is 6, m=1. 6/1 =6. Subtract zeros (0) \u21926. Not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are (sum of all elements) divided by m, but subtract the number of elements. \n\n6/1 =6 \u21926-3=3. Not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. \n\nEach operation can either: \n\n- When two elements are equal, reduce one to zero. This takes 1 step and reduces the count of that number by 1. \n\n- When they are different, turn both into the smaller. This takes 1 step and may increase the count of the smaller. \n\nThe goal is to turn all elements to zero. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the sum of (each element's value divided by the minimal element) minus the number of elements. \n\nWait, in the first sample: 6/1 -3 =3. Not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the sum of (each element's value divided by the minimal element) minus the number of elements plus something. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element, but subtract the number of elements. \n\nWait, 6/1 -3 =3. Not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern in the sample. \n\nSample 1: \n\nSteps:4. \n\nThe elements are 1,2,3. \n\nThe minimal element is 1. \n\nThe steps needed to reduce all to 1: 2 steps (2 and 3 each take one step). \n\nThen, the count of 1's is 3. \n\nElimination steps:3 steps. \n\nTotal 2+3=5. But sample answer is4. \n\nHmm, discrepancy. \n\nWait, perhaps the elimination steps are (count_m_after -1). \n\n3-1=2. \n\n2+2=4. \n\nAh! That matches the sample. \n\nWait, so maybe the elimination steps are (count_m_after -1). \n\nIn the three 3's case: \n\ncount_m_after is 3. \n\nElimination steps: 3-1=2. \n\nBut earlier calculation required 3 steps. \n\nHmm, discrepancy again. \n\nWait, let's re-calculate the three 3's case with this formula. \n\nSteps to reduce to m:0. \n\nElimination steps:3-1=2. \n\nTotal steps:2. \n\nBut actual steps needed are3. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is really confusing. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: \n\nThe minimal steps required is the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element, but subtract the number of elements. \n\nWait, in the first sample: 6/1 -3 =3. Not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element minus the number of elements plus the number of zeros. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element minus the number of elements plus the number of zeros. \n\nIn the first sample: 6/1 -3 +0 =3. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. \n\nThe minimal steps required is the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element, but subtract the number of elements. \n\nWait, in the first sample, that gives 6-3=3. Not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different way to model the problem. \n\nLet me think of the process of reducing all elements to zero. \n\nEach time you can choose any two elements. \n\nThe key is to find the minimal steps. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe minimal steps required is the sum of all elements divided by the minimal element, but subtract the number of elements. \n\nWait, in the first sample, 6/1 -3 =3.

minimal element in the array.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to zero.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first test case, one of the possible ways to change all numbers in the sequence to zero is the following:\nIn the first operation, the two numbers are not equal, so change both to the minimum of the two numbers.\nNow the sequence is [0, 0, 0].\nSo the minimum number of operations is 4.\n\nThe code:\n\nfor n in [*open(0)][2::]:\n    *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0);while a:\n        q=a.pop()\n        if a.count(q)>0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c)"
