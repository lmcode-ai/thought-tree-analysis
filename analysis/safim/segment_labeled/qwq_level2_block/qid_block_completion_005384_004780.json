  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve two programming problems here. Let's start with the first one, program1.py. The problem is about finding the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment in an array. The beauty is calculated as the difference between the max and min of the elements outside the subsegment plus the difference between the max and min of the subsegment itself. \n\nHmm, the key here is to efficiently compute these max and min values for the parts outside and inside the subsegment. Since the array can be up to 1e5 elements, a brute-force approach checking all possible subsegments would be way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think: For any subsegment from l to r, the outside part is the array excluding l to r. The max and min of the entire array except that subsegment. Wait, but how do I compute that quickly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe precompute the maximum and minimum arrays for prefixes and suffixes. Like, for each position, the maximum from the start up to that point, and similarly for the end. Wait, but that might not directly help. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the outside part's max is the maximum between the prefix up to l-1 and the suffix from r+1 onwards. Similarly for the min. So maybe precompute for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right?\n\nAlternatively, precompute for each index the maximum and minimum from the start up to that index, and from the end to that index. Then, for any l and r, the outside's max would be the max of the prefix up to l-1 and the suffix from r+1. Similarly for the min. But how to compute that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, precompute for each position the global max and min. Wait, but the outside part's max could be the global max if it's not in the subsegment. Hmm, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty can be up to (global_max - global_min) + (max_subsegment - min_subsegment). But the maximum possible would be when the subsegment's max and min are as large as possible, but the outside's max and min are also contributing. Wait, but maybe the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. But that might not be correct because the subsegment's exclusion might affect the outside's max and min. Wait, but if the subsegment is a proper subsegment, then the outside must have at least one element. So the outside's max and min are determined by the elements not in the subsegment. \n\nHmm, maybe the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. Because if the subsegment doesn't include the global max or min, then the outside's max and min would be the global ones. So in that case, the first part would be global_max - global_min, and the second part would be the max_sub - min_sub. So the total would be their sum. So the maximum beauty would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) over all possible subsegments. \n\nWait, but is that always possible? Let's see the example given. In the first test case, the optimal subsegment's outside's max and min are 6 and 1, so their difference is 5. The subsegment's max and min are 5 and 1, difference 4. Sum is 9. The global max and min of the entire array must be 6 and 1, so their difference is 5. The subsegment's max - min is 4. So 5+4=9, which matches. So that works here. \n\nAnother example: the second test case's optimal subsegment gives (100-2) + (200-1) = 98 + 199 = 297. The global max and min of the entire array must be 200 and 1 (assuming the array includes those). Wait, but the outside part's max is 100, which is less than the global max. So in that case, the first part isn't the global difference. Hmm, so my previous idea might not hold here. \n\nWait, in the second example's case, the outside part's max is 100, which is part of the array outside the subsegment. The global max of the entire array would be 200, but if the subsegment includes the 200, then the outside's max would be 100. So in that case, the first part (outside's max - min) is 100-2, which is 98. The subsegment's max is 200, min 1, so their difference is 199. So total is 297. \n\nBut the global max minus min would be 200 - 1 = 199. The subsegment's difference is 199, so adding them would give 398, which is higher than the actual. So that approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my initial idea is incorrect. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible subsegment [l, r], the beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). To compute this efficiently, perhaps precompute for all possible intervals the max and min, and also precompute the max and min for the outside regions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, note that the outside's max is the maximum of the entire array except the subsegment. Similarly for the min. So the outside's max is the maximum between the prefix up to l-1 and the suffix from r+1. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, to compute the outside's max and min for a given l and r, we can have precomputed arrays for prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min.\n\nLet me think of the following precomputations:\n\n- prefix_max[i] = maximum of a[0..i-1] (assuming 0-based)\n- prefix_min[i] = minimum of a[0..i-1]\n- suffix_max[i] = maximum of a[i..n-1]\n- suffix_min[i] = minimum of a[i..n-1]\n\nThen, for a subsegment from l to r (assuming 1-based?), the outside's max would be the maximum between prefix_max[l] and suffix_max[r+1]. Similarly, the outside's min is the minimum between prefix_min[l] and suffix_min[r+1].\n\nWait, let's clarify indices. Let's say the array is 0-based. Then for a subsegment from l to r (inclusive), the outside is the elements before l and after r. So the prefix up to l (exclusive) and the suffix from r+1 onwards. \n\nSo, the outside's max is the maximum between the prefix_max[l] and suffix_max[r+1]. Similarly for min.\n\nSo, with these precomputed arrays, for any l and r, we can compute the outside's max and min in O(1) time. \n\nThe inside's max and min can be found using a 2D array for ranges, but that would be O(n^2) space which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So how else can we compute the max and min of the subsegment [l, r] quickly?\n\nWe can use a segment tree or a sparse table for range max and min queries. That way, each query for a subsegment's max and min can be done in O(1) or O(logn) time. \n\nYes, that's a better approach. So the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays.\n\n2. Build a sparse table for range max and min queries.\n\n3. Iterate over all possible subsegments [l, r], but that's O(n^2) which is too slow for n=1e5.\n\nWait, that's the problem. We can't check all possible l and r. So we need a smarter way to find the maximum beauty without iterating all possible subsegments.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty can be found by considering certain candidates for l and r. For example, the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) plus (max_outside - min_outside). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus (max_sub - min_sub) for some subsegment that doesn't include the global max or min. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). To maximize this, we can think of the terms:\n\nThe first term (outside's max - min) can be as large as possible, and the second term (inside's max - min) can also be as large as possible. But they are dependent on the subsegment chosen.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum possible value occurs when the subsegment is such that the outside has a large max-min, and the inside also has a large max-min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the global_max - global_min plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. But in the second example, the global_max - global_min would be 200-1=199, and the subsegment's max - min is 199 (200-1). So total would be 398, but the correct answer is 297. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that idea is invalid. Need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty can be obtained by considering the entire array except for a single element. Because when you exclude one element, the outside is the entire array except that element. Wait, but the subsegment has to be a proper subsegment, so the entire array is not allowed. So the maximum could be when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the subsegment is from 1 to n-1. Then the outside is the nth element. The outside's max and min are just the nth element. So the first term is 0. The second term is (max of the first n-1 elements minus their min). But maybe that's not the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except for the first element. Then the outside is the first element, so the first term is 0. The second term is the max and min of the rest. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of some subsegment minus its min), but only when the subsegment doesn't include either the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right), where the subsegment is split into two parts. Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another angle.\n\nThe beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). Let's denote this as (A - B) + (C - D), where A is the outside's max, B the outside's min, C the inside's max, D the inside's min.\n\nThe total is (A - B) + (C - D). \n\nNow, note that the outside and inside are complementary. The entire array's max is the maximum between A and C, and the entire array's min is the minimum between B and D. \n\nSo the total can be written as (A - B) + (C - D) = (A + C) - (B + D). \n\nHmm, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible value of (A - B) + (C - D) is equal to (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub), but only when the subsegment's max and min don't interfere with the outside's max and min. \n\nWait, if the subsegment doesn't include the global max or the global min, then the outside's max and min would be the global ones. So then the first term would be (global_max - global_min), and the second term would be (max_sub - min_sub). So the total would be their sum. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible beauty would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all subsegments that do not include the global max or the global min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is achieved when the subsegment excludes either the global max or the global min, so that the outside retains the global max or min. \n\nHmm, but how do I find such a subsegment?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. Because even if the subsegment includes the global max or min, the outside's max or min might still be the global ones. \n\nWait, for example, if the subsegment includes the global max but not the global min, then the outside's min would still be the global min, so the first term would be (global_max - global_min) minus the part where the max is not the global max. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment. Because even if the subsegment includes the global max, the outside's max could still be the global max if the subsegment doesn't include it. Wait, no. If the subsegment includes the global max, then the outside's max would be the maximum of the remaining elements, which could be less than the global max. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to find a way to compute the maximum possible value efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum beauty can be up to (global_max - global_min) + (global_max - global_min), but that's only possible if there exists a subsegment where the inside's max and min are also global_max and global_min. But that would require the subsegment to include all elements, which is not allowed as it's a proper subsegment. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment that doesn't include the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of some subsegment minus its min), but only when the subsegment doesn't include the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). To compute this efficiently, perhaps we can find for each possible position the best possible contribution.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the terms:\n\nThe first term (max_outside - min_outside) can be as big as possible when the outside has a large spread. The second term (max_inside - min_inside) can also be large. \n\nPerhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is such that the outside has a large spread and the inside also has a large spread. \n\nHmm, but how to find that?\n\nAnother Idea: Let's precompute for all possible positions the maximum and minimum to the left and right. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty can be found by considering the following candidates:\n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the first element. Then the outside is the first element, so the first term is 0. The second term is the max and min of the rest.\n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the last element. Similarly.\n\n- The subsegment is the first element. Then the outside is the rest, so the first term is (global_max - global_min) (if the first element is not part of the outside). Wait, no, the outside would be the rest of the array. So the first term would be (max of the rest) minus (min of the rest). The second term is the first element's max and min (so 0). So total is (max_rest - min_rest).\n\n- The subsegment is the last element. Then the first term is (max of the first n-1 elements minus their min), and the second term is 0.\n\n- The subsegment is the first two elements. Then the outside includes the rest, so first term is (max of the rest) - (min of the rest). The second term is (max of first two) - (min of first two).\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum among all possible subsegments of length 1 (i.e., single elements) or the entire array except one element. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of some subsegment minus its min), but only when the subsegment doesn't include either the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the first part minus min of the first part) plus (max of the second part minus min of the second part), where the array is split into two parts. \n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Suppose we split the array into two parts: left and right. The subsegment is the left part, so the outside is the right part. Then the beauty would be (max_right - min_right) + (max_left - min_left). Alternatively, if the subsegment is the right part, then the outside is the left part, so the same value. \n\nSo the maximum over all possible splits (i.e., for all possible split points between 1 and n-1) of (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right). \n\nWait, this is a good point! Because when you split the array into two parts, the subsegment can be either the left or the right part. The beauty would be the sum of the max-min of each part. \n\nSo the maximum beauty could be the maximum over all possible splits of (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right). \n\nIs this always the case?\n\nLet me check the examples.\n\nFirst example: the optimal subsegment is l=7, r=8. The outside is the first 6 elements and the 9th (assuming n is 9?), but the split idea would consider splitting at 7 or 8. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the array is of length 8? Not sure. Let me think of the first example's note: the optimal subsegment gives (6-1) + (5-1) = 9. The 6-1 is the outside's max minus min, and 5-1 is the inside's. \n\nIf the split is between the first 6 elements and the last 2, then the left part's max and min would be the first 6 elements, and the right part's max and min would be the subsegment. So the sum would be (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right). \n\nAlternatively, the split between 6 and 7 would give the left part up to 6, and the right part from 7. The outside would be the left part plus the right part? Wait, no. Wait, the split idea is that the subsegment is one of the parts, so the outside is the other part. So the beauty is (max of the outside part) - (min of the outside part) plus (max of the subsegment part) - (min of the subsegment part). \n\nSo for a split at position k (the subsegment is the first k elements, then the outside is the rest), the beauty would be (max of the rest - min of the rest) + (max of first k - min of first k). \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is the rest, then the outside is the first k, so the same value. \n\nThus, the maximum over all possible splits (k from 1 to n-1) of (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right) would give the maximum possible beauty. \n\nWait, but what about subsegments that are not the entire left or right part? Like a middle segment. For example, a subsegment from l to r where l>1 and r <n. \n\nIn that case, the outside is the combination of the left part (before l) and the right part (after r). The max of the outside is the max between the left and right parts, and the min is the min between them. So the first term would be (max(left_part and right_part) - min(left_part and right_part)), and the second term is (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment). \n\nThis could potentially be larger than any split into two parts. \n\nHmm, so the split idea might not capture all possibilities. \n\nBut maybe the maximum is achieved by a split into two parts. Let me see the second example. \n\nIn the second example's optimal subsegment (l=2, r=4), the outside is the first element and the elements after 4. Let's say the array has elements like [2, ... 200, ...]. The outside's max is 100 (from the first part?), and the min is 2 (from the first element?), so their difference is 98. The subsegment's max is 200 and min 1, so their difference is 199. Total 297. \n\nIf we split between the first element and the rest (split at 1), then the left part is [2], right part is the rest. The left's max - min is 0, right's max - min is (200 - 1) = 199. Sum is 199, which is less than 297. \n\nAnother split: between position 1 and 2. The left part is [2], right part is the rest. The sum is 0 + (max of the rest - min of the rest). The max of the rest includes 200, min includes 1. So 199. \n\nAnother split between position 4 and 5: the left part up to 4 includes the subsegment's elements. The right part is after 4. The left's max and min would include the subsegment's elements. The right's max and min would be the elements after 4. \n\nHmm, perhaps the split idea is not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is indeed achieved by a split into two parts. Let me think of the first example's optimal case. The split between 6 and 7 would give left part up to 6, right part from 7. The left's max and min would be the first 6 elements, and the right's max and min would be the subsegment (elements 7 and 8). The sum would be (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right). \n\nSuppose the first 6 elements have a max of 6 and min of 1 (assuming the outside's max is 6 and min 1). Then the right part (subsegment) has max 5 and min 1. So the sum is (6-1)+(5-1)=5+4=9, which matches the example. \n\nSo in this case, the split gives the correct maximum. \n\nThe second example's optimal case: the subsegment is from 2 to 4. The outside is the first element (2) and the elements after 4. Let's say the elements after 4 have a max of 100 and min of 2. The first element is 2. So the outside's max is 100, min is 2. The subsegment's max is 200 and min 1. So the total is (100-2)+(200-1) = 98+199=297. \n\nBut how would this be captured by a split? The split would have to be between 1 and 2, but that gives the left part as [2], right part as the rest. The right part's max is 200, min is 1. So the sum would be (2-2) + (200-1) = 199, which is less than 297. \n\nHmm, so the split idea doesn't capture this case. So the maximum beauty can be higher than any split into two parts. \n\nHmm, so that approach won't work. \n\nAlternative Idea: The maximum beauty can be obtained by considering the entire array except for a single element. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the subsegment is the entire array except the first element. The outside is the first element, so the first term is 0. The second term is the max and min of the rest. \n\nAlternatively, the subsegment is the entire array except the last element. The first term is (max of first n-1 elements - min of first n-1 elements), and the second term is the last element's max and min (0). \n\nAlternatively, the subsegment is the entire array except the middle element. The outside is the two parts around it. The first term is the max of the two parts minus the min of the two parts. The second term is the middle element's max and min (0). \n\nHmm, but in the second example's case, the optimal subsegment excludes the first element (assuming the first element is 2?), but also includes elements up to 4. So the outside includes the first element and the elements after 4. \n\nSo the first term is (max(2, elements after 4) - min(2, elements after 4)). \n\nThe second term is the max of the subsegment (2 to 4) minus its min. \n\nSo the total is (max(2, elements after 4) - min(2, elements after4)) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThis could be higher than any split into two parts. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible single-element exclusions, or over all possible two-element exclusions, but that might not be feasible for large n. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum over all possible splits into two parts (as before), and \n\n- The maximum over all possible single-element exclusions (i.e., subsegments of length n-1), and \n\n- The maximum over all possible subsegments of length n-2 (but that's still O(n) time?).\n\nWait, but for n up to 1e5, even O(n) is manageable. \n\nWait, let's think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering the following candidates:\n\n1. All possible splits into two parts (left and right), which gives O(n) candidates.\n\n2. All possible subsegments of length n-1 (i.e., excluding one element). There are n such subsegments. \n\n3. All possible subsegments of length n-2 (excluding two elements). But this would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nSo maybe considering the first two cases is sufficient. \n\nLet me see:\n\nIn the second example's case, the optimal subsegment is of length 3 (assuming n is 5?), but perhaps in their example, the subsegment is of length 3 (positions 2-4). The outside includes the first and the rest after 4. \n\nBut how would that be captured in the first two cases?\n\nThe first case (splits into two parts) would not capture this, but the second case (excluding one element) might not either. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum is achieved by a subsegment that is not a split into two parts or a single-element exclusion. \n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe I need to find a way to compute the maximum efficiently using some precomputed arrays and range queries. \n\nLet me think again of the initial approach with precomputed prefix and suffix arrays and a sparse table for range max and min. \n\nThe steps would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nprefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i-1], so for i from 0 to n.\n\nSimilarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1], for i from 0 to n.\n\nSame for min arrays.\n\n2. Build a sparse table for range max and min queries. \n\n3. Iterate over all possible l and r (but this is O(n^2), which is too slow). \n\nHmm, but n is up to 1e5, so this is impossible. \n\nAlternative Idea: The maximum beauty can be expressed as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nLet me think of the terms:\n\nmax_outside is the maximum between the prefix_max[l] and suffix_max[r+1].\n\nmin_outside is the minimum between the prefix_min[l] and suffix_min[r+1].\n\nmax_inside is the max of a[l..r].\n\nmin_inside is the min of a[l..r].\n\nSo the total is (max(prefix_max[l], suffix_max[r+1]) - min(prefix_min[l], suffix_min[r+1])) + (max(a[l..r]) - min(a[l..r])).\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum can be found by considering certain candidates for l and r. \n\nFor example, the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) is the global_max - global_min. But that requires the subsegment to include all elements except one, but then the outside would have a smaller max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except for the global min. Then the outside's max is the global_max, and the min is the min of the remaining elements (excluding the global min). \n\nHmm, but this requires knowing where the global min is located. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that doesn't include the global max or min. \n\n- The maximum over all possible splits into two parts (as before). \n\n- The maximum over all possible single-element exclusions. \n\nIf I can compute these efficiently, then perhaps I can find the maximum among them. \n\nLet me try to compute these candidates:\n\nFirst, compute the global_max and global_min of the entire array. \n\nThen, compute the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all subsegments that do not include the global_max or the global_min. \n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all possible subsegments can be found using a sparse table. \n\nThe maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment can be found by iterating over all possible subsegments, but that's O(n^2). \n\nHmm, but perhaps the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment is simply the global_max - global_min. But that would require the subsegment to include all elements, which is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) for a proper subsegment is the global_max - global_min, but only if there exists a subsegment that includes all elements except one. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. \n\nWait, let's think of the following: the beauty can be written as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe maximum of this expression can be found by considering that the two terms are related. \n\nSuppose we choose a subsegment such that the outside has a large max-min and the inside also has a large max-min. \n\nThe maximum possible value would be when both terms are as large as possible. \n\nTo find this, perhaps the best is to consider all possible subsegments where the outside's max and min are as large as possible, and the inside's max and min are also as large as possible. \n\nBut how to find this efficiently?\n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the first example's solution:\n\nThe maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of some subsegment minus its min), but only when the subsegment doesn't include the global max or min. \n\nWait, in the first example, the global max is 6 and min is 1. The subsegment excludes the global max (since the outside includes it). The subsegment's max is 5 and min 1. So the total is (6-1)+(5-1)=9. \n\nIn the second example, the global max is 200 and min is 1. The subsegment includes the global max (200) but excludes the global min (1). The outside's min is 2 (from the first element?), so the first term is (100-2) = 98. The subsegment's max is 200 and min is 1 (so the subsegment includes the global min?), which would mean the outside's min is 2. \n\nWait, in that case, the subsegment includes the global min (1), so the outside's min is 2. \n\nSo the first term is (100-2) = 98, and the second term is (200-1) = 199. Total 297. \n\nSo the first term is (max_outside - min_outside) = (100 - 2) = 98. The second term is (max_inside - min_inside) = 199. \n\nThe global_max - global_min is 199. So the total is 98+199 = 297. \n\nSo in this case, the first term is not the global_max - global_min, but the second term is. \n\nHmm, so the maximum beauty can be the sum of two terms where one of them is the global_max - global_min. \n\nSo perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment that doesn't include the global_max or global_min. \n\n- (max_sub - min_sub) + (global_max - global_min) for any subsegment that doesn't include the global_min or global_max. \n\nWait, but how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right, and then find the best possible combination. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty can be found by considering the following four cases:\n\n1. The subsegment excludes the first element. \n\n2. The subsegment excludes the last element. \n\n3. The subsegment excludes the global_max. \n\n4. The subsegment excludes the global_min. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum over all possible splits into two parts (left and right), giving (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right).\n\n- The maximum over all possible single-element exclusions (subsegments of length n-1), giving (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside).\n\n- The maximum over all possible two-element exclusions (but this is too much).\n\nHmm, let's try to compute the first two cases. \n\nFor the splits into two parts:\n\nThe maximum over all splits can be computed in O(n) time using precomputed prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nFor the single-element exclusions:\n\nThere are n possible subsegments (each excluding one element). For each such subsegment, the outside is the rest of the array (excluding that element). \n\nThe outside's max is the global_max unless the excluded element is the global_max. Similarly for the min. \n\nThe inside's max and min are the max and min of the subsegment (which is the entire array except the excluded element). \n\nSo for each element a[i], the beauty when excluding it is:\n\noutside_max = max(global_max (if a[i] != global_max), else the next highest max)\n\nWait, no. The outside is the array without a[i], so the max is the maximum of the entire array except a[i]. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum of the array excluding that element. \n\nHow?\n\nWe can precompute prefix_max and suffix_max arrays. \n\nFor each position i, the max excluding a[i] is the maximum between prefix_max[i] and suffix_max[i+1]. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nSo for each i in 0..n-1:\n\noutside_max = max(prefix_max[i], suffix_max[i+1])\n\noutside_min = min(prefix_min[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\ninside_max = max of the array excluding a[i]. Which is the same as the outside_max. \n\nWait, no. The inside is the subsegment excluding a[i], so the inside is the entire array except a[i]. So the inside's max is the outside_max. \n\nWait, no. The inside is the subsegment which is the entire array except a[i]. So the inside's max is the outside_max. \n\nWait, the inside is the subsegment excluding a[i], so the inside's max is the maximum of the array excluding a[i], which is the outside_max. \n\nSimilarly, the inside's min is the outside_min. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the inside is the subsegment excluding a[i], so the inside's max is the maximum of the array excluding a[i], which is the same as the outside's max. \n\nSo the beauty for excluding a[i] is:\n\n(outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min) \n\nBut inside_max is the same as outside_max, and inside_min is the same as outside_min. So this would be (A-B) + (A-B) = 2*(A-B). \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nWait, no. The inside is the subsegment excluding a[i], so the inside's max and min are the same as the outside's max and min. \n\nSo the beauty would be (outside_max - outside_min) + (inside_max - inside_min) = (A-B) + (A-B) = 2*(A-B). \n\nBut that's not possible. \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused between the terms. \n\nThe outside is the part not in the subsegment. Wait no, the subsegment is the inside. \n\nWait, when the subsegment is the entire array except a[i], then the outside is just the element a[i]. \n\nWait, no! The subsegment is the entire array except a[i]. So the outside is the element a[i]. \n\nAh! Right. So the outside is the element a[i]. \n\nSo the outside's max and min are a[i]. \n\nThe inside is the rest of the array. \n\nSo the beauty is (max_inside - min_inside) + (a[i] - a[i]) = (max_inside - min_inside) + 0. \n\nSo the beauty for excluding a[i] is simply the max_inside - min_inside of the rest of the array. \n\nAh! That's a crucial mistake I made earlier. \n\nSo for the case where the subsegment is the entire array except a single element (i), the outside is just that element. So the first term (outside's max - min) is zero. The second term is the max and min of the rest of the array. \n\nSo the beauty is (max_rest - min_rest). \n\nSo for each i, the beauty when excluding a[i] is (max_rest_i - min_rest_i), where max_rest_i is the maximum of the array excluding a[i], and similarly for min. \n\nTo compute this for all i efficiently:\n\nWe can precompute prefix_max, suffix_max, prefix_min, suffix_min arrays. \n\nFor each i, the max_rest_i is max(prefix_max[i], suffix_max[i+1]). \n\nSimilarly, min_rest_i is min(prefix_min[i], suffix_min[i+1]). \n\nSo the beauty for excluding a[i] is (max_rest_i - min_rest_i). \n\nThe maximum among all these is a candidate for the maximum beauty. \n\nSo the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum over all splits into two parts (left and right) of (max_left - min_left) + (max_right - min_right).\n\n- The maximum over all single-element exclusions (i.e., the max_rest_i - min_rest_i for each i).\n\n- Also, perhaps other cases like excluding two elements, but that might not be necessary. \n\nSo combining these two cases might give the correct maximum. \n\nLet me check the second example's case. \n\nIn the second example's optimal case, the subsegment is from 2 to 4 (assuming 1-based indices). The outside includes the first element and the elements after 4. \n\nThe outside's max is the maximum between the first element and the elements after 4. Let's say the first element is 2, and the elements after 4 have a max of 100. So the outside's max is 100, min is 2. \n\nThe inside's max is 200 (the max of the subsegment), min is 1 (the min of the subsegment). \n\nSo the beauty is (100-2)+(200-1) = 98+199=297. \n\nThis case is not captured by the split into two parts or the single-element exclusion. \n\nHmm, so this approach would miss this case. \n\nSo what's the split that would give this value? \n\nThe split would have to be between the first element and the rest. But then the left part is [2], right part is the rest. The beauty would be (2-2) + (max_right - min_right). The max_right includes 200 and 1, so max_right - min_right is 199. So total is 199, which is less than 297. \n\nThe single-element exclusion case would be when excluding the first element (2). The outside is just 2, so the first term is 0. The inside's max and min are the max and min of the rest (which includes 200 and 1). So the beauty is 199. \n\nExcluding the element 1 (the global min), the outside is 1. The inside's max and min are the max and min of the rest (which includes 200 and 2). So the beauty is (200-2) = 198. \n\nExcluding the element 200 (the global max), the outside is 200. The inside's max and min are the max and min of the rest (which includes 1 and 2). So the beauty is (2-1) = 1. \n\nSo none of the single-element exclusions or splits give the 297. \n\nThus, this approach is insufficient. \n\nHmm, so what's the way to capture this case?\n\nThe subsegment in the second example is not a single-element exclusion nor a split into two parts. \n\nSo I need to find another way. \n\nAlternative Idea: The maximum beauty can be found by considering all possible subsegments where the outside's max and min are determined by two separate parts (left and right of the subsegment). \n\nThe beauty is (max(left_part and right_part) - min(left_part and right_part)) + (max(subsegment) - min(subsegment)). \n\nTo maximize this, perhaps the best is to find a subsegment where the left and right parts have a large spread (max - min), and the subsegment also has a large spread. \n\nBut how to find this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of the following:\n\n(max_left_part, max_right_part) \u2192 the max of the outside is the maximum of the left and right parts' max.\n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nThe left part is a[0..l-1], the right part is a[r+1..n-1]. \n\nThe max of the outside is max( max_left, max_right ), where max_left is the max of the left part, max_right the max of the right part. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nThe inside's max and min are the max and min of a[l..r]. \n\nSo the beauty is (max(max_left, max_right) - min(min_left, min_right)) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nTo compute this for all possible l and r efficiently, we need to find for each possible l and r the max_left, min_left, max_right, min_right, and the inside's max and min. \n\nThis requires O(1) or O(logn) time per query. \n\nTo do this, we can precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nThen, for any l and r:\n\nmax_left = prefix_max[l]\n\nmin_left = prefix_min[l]\n\nmax_right = suffix_max[r+1]\n\nmin_right = suffix_min[r+1]\n\nmax_outside = max(max_left, max_right)\n\nmin_outside = min(min_left, min_right)\n\nThe inside's max and min can be found using a range max and min query over a[l..r]. \n\nThus, the beauty can be computed in O(1) time per query if we have a sparse table for range max and min. \n\nThe problem is that there are O(n^2) possible subsegments, which is too much. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved by certain candidates, such as:\n\n- The subsegment that includes the global_max and global_min. \n\n- The subsegment that excludes the global_max or global_min. \n\n- The subsegment that is the entire array except for the first or last element. \n\n- The subsegment that is the first or last element. \n\n- The subsegment that is the first or last two elements. \n\n- The subsegment that is the middle element. \n\nBut this is not exhaustive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved when the subsegment is such that the outside's max and min are the global max and min (excluding the subsegment). \n\nTo achieve this, the subsegment must not include the global max or the global min. \n\nIn that case, the first term is global_max - global_min. \n\nThe second term is the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nThus, the total is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this over all subsegments not containing global_max or global_min would be a candidate. \n\nSo the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment not containing global_max or global_min.\n\n- The maximum over all splits into two parts.\n\n- The maximum over all single-element exclusions.\n\n- The maximum over other cases like the second example's case. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe first term requires finding the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that exclude both global_max and global_min. \n\nThis can be done by finding the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) over all possible subsegments that do not include the global_max or global_min. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment can be found using a sparse table. \n\nThe maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) over all subsegments is the global_max - global_min, but that requires the subsegment to include all elements except one. \n\nBut if the subsegment excludes both global_max and global_min, then the max_sub - min_sub could be up to (global_max - global_min) minus some value. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the only way to proceed is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays and the sparse tables, then iterate over all possible candidates for l and r that could potentially give the maximum beauty. \n\nFor example, the candidates could be:\n\n- All possible splits into two parts (l from 1 to n-1).\n\n- All possible single-element exclusions (each i from 0 to n-1).\n\n- The subsegments that exclude the global_max or global_min.\n\n- The subsegments that include the global_max but not the global_min, or vice versa. \n\nBut even this might not be feasible for large n. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following three values:\n\n1. The maximum over all splits into two parts.\n\n2. The maximum over all single-element exclusions.\n\n3. The maximum over all possible subsegments that exclude both the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut how to compute the third term?\n\nAlternatively, the third term can be computed as (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) of any subsegment not containing global_max or global_min. \n\nBut how to find that maximum?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment is the global_max - global_min. But that requires the subsegment to include all elements except one. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: the beauty can be written as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe maximum possible value of this expression is the maximum over all possible subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is such that the outside has the maximum possible (max_outside - min_outside), and the inside has the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nBut these two terms are not independent. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) plus (max_inside - min_inside) for all possible subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right, and also the maximum and minimum of the subsegment. \n\nBut with the help of sparse tables, we can compute the max and min of any subsegment in O(1) time. \n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\n2. Build a sparse table for range max and min queries. \n\n3. Iterate over all possible l and r (but this is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e5). \n\nThis is not feasible. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a smarter way to find the maximum. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum over all possible splits into two parts (left and right), which can be computed in O(n) time.\n\n- The maximum over all possible single-element exclusions (O(n) time).\n\n- The maximum over all possible two-element exclusions (but this is O(n^2), which is not feasible).\n\n- The maximum over all possible subsegments that exclude the global_max or global_min (but how?).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the first two cases (splits and single exclusions) plus the case where the subsegment is the entire array except for two elements. \n\nBut this is still not feasible for large n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal subsegment is either a single-element exclusion or a split into two parts. \n\nIn the second example's case, the optimal subsegment is not a single-element exclusion or a split. So this approach would fail. \n\nBut maybe the second example's case can be captured by a split into three parts? \n\nWait, the split into two parts would require the subsegment to be one of the two parts. \n\nThe second example's optimal subsegment is a middle segment. So the outside is the first part and the third part. \n\nThus, the split into two parts would not capture this. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for hints or think of the problem differently. \n\nThe beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe maximum possible value of this expression is the maximum over all possible subsegments. \n\nLet me think of the following: the maximum possible value of (max_outside - min_outside) is the global_max - global_min, which occurs when the subsegment excludes both the global_max and global_min. \n\nThe maximum possible value of (max_inside - min_inside) is also global_max - global_min, but that requires the subsegment to include both global_max and global_min. \n\nThus, the maximum possible beauty would be (global_max - global_min) + (global_max - global_min) = 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nBut this requires the subsegment to exclude both global_max and global_min (so the outside has global_max and global_min) and also include them (inside has them). Which is impossible. \n\nThus, the maximum possible beauty is less than this. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between:\n\n- (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub) where the subsegment does not include global_max or global_min. \n\n- (max_sub - min_sub) + (global_max - global_min) where the subsegment does not include global_min or global_max. \n\n- The maximum over splits and single exclusions. \n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following:\n\n1. The maximum over all splits into two parts.\n\n2. The maximum over all single-element exclusions.\n\n3. The maximum over all possible subsegments that exclude the global_max or global_min. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between the first two cases (splits and single exclusions) plus the case where the subsegment excludes the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the first two cases and see if that passes the examples. \n\nIn the first example, the optimal case is captured by a split between 6 and 7 (assuming the array length is 8 or 9). \n\nIn the second example, the optimal case is not captured by the first two cases. \n\nHmm, so this approach would fail the second example. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute the maximum over all possible splits into three parts? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible splits into two parts plus the maximum over all possible subsegments that are the union of two splits. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: the beauty can be written as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe maximum of this expression can be found by considering that the outside and inside are complementary. \n\nThe maximum possible value is the maximum over all possible subsegments of (max of the entire array excluding the subsegment) - (min of the entire array excluding the subsegment) + (max of the subsegment) - (min of the subsegment). \n\nThis is the same as (max of the entire array excluding the subsegment minus min of the entire array excluding the subsegment) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). \n\nThe maximum of this expression can be found by considering that the two terms are related. \n\nPerhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is such that the outside has a large spread and the inside also has a large spread. \n\nTo find this efficiently, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between the following two terms:\n\n- The maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) over all possible subsegments plus the maximum of (max_inside - min_inside) over all possible subsegments. \n\nBut this is not necessarily correct because the two terms are not independent. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum is the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside) for all possible subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right, and also the maximum and minimum of the subsegment. \n\nBut with the help of sparse tables, we can compute the max and min of any subsegment in O(1) time. \n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\n2. Build a sparse table for range max and min queries. \n\n3. Iterate over all possible l and r (but this is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e5). \n\nThis is not feasible. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a way to find the maximum without iterating all possible subsegments. \n\nLet me think of the following: the maximum beauty can be obtained by considering the following candidates:\n\n- The subsegment that excludes the first element.\n\n- The subsegment that excludes the last element.\n\n- The subsegment that excludes the global_max.\n\n- The subsegment that excludes the global_min.\n\n- The subsegment that excludes both the global_max and global_min.\n\n- The subsegment that includes the global_max but not the global_min.\n\n- The subsegment that includes the global_min but not the global_max.\n\n- The subsegment that includes both
