Let me think:\n\nThe number of consecutive 0's pairs is the number of times two 0's are adjacent. Similarly for 1's. The minimal steps is the maximum of these two counts plus 1. In the first example, there are no such pairs, so 0+1=1.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe first problem requires processing multiple queries on a string of digits. The task is, for each query, find two substrings of length w such that when multiplied by a certain value and added, their sum mod 9 equals k_i. The key here is to precompute the possible values of all possible substrings of length w mod 9. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, the current approach is to precompute the prefix sums mod 9. Then, for each substring of length w, compute its value mod 9 and store the starting indices in a dictionary. \n\nThe missing part is in the loop where they check all possible v1 and v2. The code has a comment for when v1 == v2. In that case, we need to ensure there are at least two different starting indices. So, if the list for v1 has more than one element, the minimal L1 and L2 would be the first two elements. But how to handle that in the code?\n\nThe current code for the v1 != v2 case is setting res to the minimum between the current res and (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0]). But for the v1 == v2 case, when there are at least two elements, we need to take the first two elements. So the code should be something like:\n\nif v1 == v2:\n    if len(indices[v1]) >=2:\n        res = min(res, (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1]))\n\nBut also, since the problem requires L1 < L2, but the indices are stored in order, so the first two elements would be the minimal possible. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the current code uses a cache for (vlr, k), but the cache is not properly filled for all cases. For example, when v1 and v2 are different, the code checks if their lists are non-empty and then takes the first elements. But maybe there's a better pair with smaller L1 and L2. However, since we are iterating over all possible v1 and v2, and taking the minimum, this should be okay.\n\nWait, but the code loops through all v1 and v2 from 0 to 8, which is 81 possibilities. For each pair that satisfies the equation (v1 * vlr + v2) mod9 ==k, it checks if the indices exist and then updates the res. The minimal (L1, L2) is tracked by comparing tuples, which is correct because tuples are compared lex order. \n\nSo the missing code for the v1 == v2 case is:\n\nif len(indices[v1]) >=2:\n    res = min(res, (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1]))\n\nSo that's the part to fill in the TODO.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is about finding the minimal number of operations to delete a substring of a binary string by removing substrings where consecutive characters are different. Each operation can remove a substring t where all consecutive characters in t are different. The minimal steps required to delete the entire substring from l to r.\n\nThe code provided is trying to precompute some prefix arrays. The idea is that the minimal steps depend on the number of transitions between 0 and 1 in the substring. For example, a string like 0101 would have transitions every step, so each operation can remove a single character, leading to O(n) steps. But perhaps the minimal steps are related to the number of transitions divided by 2 or something similar.\n\nLooking at the code, they have pre0 and pre1 arrays. The code for pre0[i] and pre1[i] is being filled. The current code for pre0[i] is being updated when two consecutive 0s are found. Similarly, for pre1, when two 1s are found. Wait, maybe the approach is to count the number of runs? Or perhaps the number of times the same character repeats consecutively?\n\nWait the note in the problem says that for the substring \"101\", the minimal steps are 1. Let's see: the entire string is 1,0,1. To delete it, you can remove the entire string in one operation because the substring must have consecutive differing characters. Wait, the operation requires that in the substring t, every consecutive pair is different. So for the entire string \"101\", the substring t can be the entire string, since each adjacent pair is different. So deleting it in one step. \n\nAnother example: \"11011\". The first example in the note says that after some steps, it takes 3 steps. Let me see. The first operation could be removing the middle '0', but that's part of a substring where the next characters are 1. Wait, perhaps the minimal steps are (number of transitions +1)/2 ?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps required is equal to the number of transitions between 0 and 1 divided by 2, rounded up? Or maybe the number of runs divided by 2?\n\nWait, let's think of the example \"101\" (transitions between 1-0 and 0-1, so 2 transitions). The number of runs is 3 (1,0,1). The minimal steps here is 1. So (3 runs) / 2 rounded up? 3/2 is 1.5 \u2192 ceil gives 2, but the answer is 1. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the ceiling of (number of runs)/2. For 3 runs, that would be 2, but the example shows 1. So that's not it.\n\nWait the example \"101\" can be removed in one step by taking the entire string as t. Because the substring t must have all consecutive differing. The entire string is 1,0,1. Each adjacent pair is different, so it's allowed. So removing it in one step. So the number of transitions is 2 (since between 1-0 and 0-1). The number of runs is 3. So perhaps the minimal steps is (number of runs +1)/2 ?\n\nWait 3 runs \u2192 (3+1)/2 = 2, but the answer is 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: \"011\" \u2192 the substring is 0,1,1. The transitions are 0\u21921 (one transition). The runs are 0, then 11 \u2192 two runs. The minimal steps here is 2. The first step removes the first two characters (0 and 1, since they are different), leaving '1', then another step to remove that. So total 2 steps. The formula (runs) \u2192 2 runs \u2192 (2)/1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. For 3 runs (like 101), 3/2 \u2192 2, but the answer is 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of transitions divided by 2, rounded up. For 101, transitions are 2 \u2192 2/2 =1 \u2192 correct. For 011, transitions are 1 \u2192 1/2 \u2192 1, but the answer is 2. So that's not right.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of transitions plus 1, divided by 2. Let's see:\n\nFor 101 (transitions 2 \u2192 (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 ceil to 2? No, but the answer is 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the ceiling of (number of transitions +1)/2. For 101: (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 ceil to 2, but answer is 1. Not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. Let's see:\n\nFor 101 (3 runs \u2192 3/2 \u2192 2, but answer is 1. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: each operation can remove a substring where all consecutive characters are different. So the substring t must be a sequence where each adjacent pair is different. So the maximum possible t is the entire string if it alternates between 0 and 1. So in that case, you can remove it in one step. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the number of \"blocks\" of same characters divided by 2, rounded up? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the example \"11011\" (the second note example). The string is 1,1,0,1,1. The runs are 11 (run1), 0 (run2), 11 (run3). So three runs. The minimal steps are 3? Wait the note says the answer is 3 steps. Let me see the note's explanation:\n\nThey do one operation on s[2,4] (indices 2-4 in 1-based?), which is the substring \"101\". Removing that leaves \"11\" and \"11\"? Wait the original substring is 11011. After removing the middle part (positions 2-4?), which is \"101\", the remaining parts would be the first '1' and the last two '1's? Not sure. The note says after that, they have \"11\", then two more steps. So total 3 steps. \n\nHmm, the number of runs here is 3. So 3 runs \u2192 steps 3? Or 3 runs \u2192 (3 +1)/2 = 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is equal to the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. For 3 runs \u2192 2 steps? But the example requires 3 steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of runs. For the first example (3 runs \u2192 3 steps?), but the first example's answer is 1. So that's not.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. Let me see:\n\nFirst example (3 runs \u2192 2 steps? But the answer is 1. So that's not.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal steps is the number of transitions between 0 and 1 plus 1, divided by 2. Let's see:\n\nFirst example has 2 transitions \u2192 (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 ceil to 2? No, but the answer is 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the ceiling of (number of transitions +1)/2. For 2 transitions \u2192 (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 ceil to 2, but the answer is 1. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's think of the problem as follows: each operation can remove a substring where all consecutive characters are different. So the best way is to remove as much as possible in each step. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of such operations needed to delete the entire string.\n\nThe key insight here is that each operation can remove a substring that is a maximal alternating sequence. For example, in \"101\", the entire string is such a substring, so one step. In \"011\", the first two characters form an alternating pair (0 and 1), so you can remove them in one step, leaving the last '1', which requires another step. So total 2 steps. \n\nThe number of steps required is equal to the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. Let's see:\n\nIn \"101\" (3 runs \u2192 3/2 = 1.5 \u2192 ceil to 2? But the answer is 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait the runs in \"101\" are 1,0,1 \u2192 three runs. So the number of runs is 3. The minimal steps would be ceil(3/2) = 2, but the correct answer is 1. So that's not.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up, but subtract 1 if even? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. Let me see the second example:\n\nThe string \"11011\" has three runs. 3/2 \u2192 2 steps? But the note says the answer is 3. So that's not.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is the number of runs. Let me see:\n\nFirst example: 3 runs \u2192 3 steps? No, the answer is 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of the problem differently. Let's think of the minimal steps as the number of transitions between 0 and 1 plus 1, divided by 2. \n\nWait, transitions are the number of times the character changes. For \"101\", transitions are 2. (1\u21920, 0\u21921). So (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 ceil to 2? No, but the answer is 1. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is (number of transitions +1) // 2. For 2 transitions \u2192 (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 1.5 floored to 1.5? Not sure. \n\nWait, let's think of the transitions as the number of times the character changes. For a string of length m, the number of transitions is (number of runs -1). Because each run after the first starts a new transition. \n\nSo for \"101\", runs are 3 \u2192 transitions are 2. \n\nThe minimal steps would be (transitions +1) // 2. \n\nFor transitions 2 \u2192 (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 floor gives 1.5 \u2192 but integer division would be 1.5 \u2192 1.5 rounded up to 2? Not sure. \n\nWait let's see the examples:\n\nFirst example: transitions 2 \u2192 (2+1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 ceil gives 2? But the answer is 1. Hmm.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal steps is (number of runs +1) // 2. \n\nFor 3 runs \u2192 (3+1)/2 = 2 \u2192 but the answer is 1. \n\nHmm, not working.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait for the first example (3 runs \u2192 2 steps?), but the correct answer is 1. So that's not.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: each operation can remove a substring that is a maximal alternating sequence. The minimal steps would be the number of such maximal sequences needed. \n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. Let me think of the first example again. 3 runs \u2192 2 steps? But the answer is 1. So that's not.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up, but when the number of runs is odd, it's (runs +1)/2. \n\nWait for 3 runs \u2192 (3+1)/2 = 2 steps, but the first example requires 1. So that's not.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the problem in terms of the following: each operation can remove a substring that is a sequence of alternating characters. The best way is to remove the entire string in one step if possible. Otherwise, split into parts.\n\nWait, the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. Let me see the second example:\n\nThe string \"11011\" has three runs (11, 0, 11). So runs =3 \u2192 steps 2. But the note says the answer is 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait the note says for the second example, the answer is 3 steps. Let me see the explanation:\n\nThey first remove s[2,4] (assuming 1-based indices). The substring is \"101\" (from positions 2-4?), which is part of the original string \"11011\". After removing that, the remaining parts are the first '1' and the last two '1's. So the remaining string is \"1\" and \"11\", but how? Maybe the remaining parts are \"1\" (from first position) and \"11\" (from the last two). So the total after first step is \"1\" + \"11\" \u2192 \"111\". Then, they need to remove each '1' in two steps. So total steps 1+2=3. \n\nHmm, so the first step removes the middle part, but the remaining parts are two separate runs. So the total steps are 1 (for the middle) plus steps for the remaining parts. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of runs. For the second example, 3 runs \u2192 3 steps. That matches the note's answer. \n\nFirst example has 3 runs \u2192 3 steps? But the note says the first example's answer is 1. So that's conflicting. \n\nWait the first example's string is \"101\" (3 runs). The minimal steps is 1, which is less than the number of runs. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the ceiling of (number of runs)/2. \n\nFirst example: 3 \u2192 2 steps? No, but the answer is 1. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nThe operation allows you to delete any substring t where in t, every consecutive pair is different. So t can be any substring that is an alternating sequence. The goal is to delete the entire substring in as few steps as possible.\n\nThe minimal steps would be the minimal number of such operations needed to cover the entire string, with each operation's substring being non-overlapping? Or can they overlap?\n\nWait, the operation deletes the substring t from the current string. So each step reduces the string by removing t. The next steps are applied to the remaining parts. \n\nThe key is to find the minimal steps to delete the entire string. \n\nLet me think of the first example \"101\" (3 runs). The entire string is an alternating sequence (1-0-1), so you can delete it in one step. So steps =1. \n\nSecond example \"11011\" (3 runs). The first run is two 1's, then 0, then two 1's. The first step can remove the middle '0' (but that's a single character, so allowed). But then the remaining parts are \"11\" and \"11\", which can be removed in two steps (each \"11\" can be removed in one step each, but each requires two steps? Wait, \"11\" can be removed in one step by taking the entire substring (since it's length 2, but the two characters are same, so the substring can't be taken. Wait, the substring must have consecutive differing characters. So for \"11\", the only possible substrings are single characters. So to delete \"11\", you need two steps (each '1' is removed individually). \n\nSo the first step removes the '0', leaving two '11's. Then each '11' requires two steps each. So total steps 1 + 2 + 2 = 5? But the note says the answer is 3. \n\nHmm, the note's explanation says that after removing the substring s[2,4] (which is \"101\"), the remaining parts are \"1\" and \"11\". So the first step removes the middle part (positions 2-4?), which is \"101\", leaving the first '1' and the last two '1's. Then, the remaining parts are \"1\" and \"11\". \n\nThe \"1\" can be removed in one step, and the \"11\" requires two steps (each '1' individually). So total steps 1 (first step) + 1 (for the first '1') + 2 (for the two '1's) \u2192 total 4? But the note says the answer is 3. \n\nWait the note's explanation says after removing the middle part, the remaining is \"11\". Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the indices. Let me recheck the note's example:\n\nThe second query's substring is \"11011\". The first operation is on s[2,4], which in 1-based indices would be positions 2,3,4. The original string is 1 (pos1), 1 (pos2), 0 (pos3), 1 (pos4), 1 (pos5). So the substring from 2-4 is \"101\". Removing that leaves the first '1' (pos1) and the last '1' (pos5). So the remaining string is \"1\" and \"1\", but separated. So the remaining parts are two '1's. So after first step, you have two '1's. Each can be removed in one step each. So total steps 1+2=3. That's correct. \n\nAh, so the first step removes the middle part, leaving two separate '1's. So the total steps are 3. \n\nSo the key is to find the best way to split the string into as few as possible such substrings. \n\nThe minimal steps is equal to the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait for the first example (3 runs \u2192 2 steps?), but the answer is 1. So that's not. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait 3 runs \u2192 ceil(3/2) = 2 steps. But the first example's answer is 1. So that's not. \n\nHmm, maybe the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up, but when the number of runs is odd, it's (runs +1)/2. \n\nWait 3 runs \u2192 (3+1)/2 = 2 steps. But the first example requires 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is (number of runs +1) // 2. \n\nFor 3 runs \u2192 (3+1)/2 = 2 steps. But the first example's answer is 1. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe minimal steps required is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait for the first example (3 runs \u2192 2 steps?), but the answer is 1. So that's not. \n\nWait maybe the minimal steps is the ceiling of (number of runs -1)/2. \n\n3 runs \u2192 (3-1)/2 =1 \u2192 correct. \n\nSecond example (3 runs \u2192 (3-1)/2 =1 \u2192 but the answer is 3. No, that's not. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait the second example has 3 runs \u2192 2 steps. But the answer is 3. So that's not. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of the problem differently. Let's think of the minimal steps as the number of transitions between runs divided by 2 plus 1. \n\nWait transitions are runs-1. So (runs-1)/2 +1 \u2192 (runs+1)/2. \n\nFor first example: (3+1)/2 = 2 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait first example: 3 \u2192 2 steps. But the correct answer is 1. \n\nHmm, maybe the correct formula is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up, but when the number of runs is odd, subtract 0.5? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait the first example has 3 runs \u2192 2 steps. But the correct answer is 1. So that's not. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of runs divided by 2, rounded up, but when the entire string can be removed in one step (if it's alternating), then it's 1. \n\nWait the first example can be removed in one step, so that's the case. \n\nThe second example has 3 runs. The first run is two 1's, so the entire string can't be removed in one step. So the minimal steps would be (3+1)/2 = 2? But the note says 3 steps. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think of the code provided. \n\nThe code for program2.py has pre0 and pre1 arrays. The current code is:\n\npre0[i] is incremented when two consecutive 0's are found. Similarly for pre1 when two 1's are found. \n\nThe final answer is max(pre0[r-1] - pre0[l-1], pre1[r-1] - pre1[l-1]) +1. \n\nWait, let's see what this does. \n\nSuppose the code is counting the number of times two same characters appear consecutively. \n\nFor example, in the first example \"101\", the transitions are between 1 and 0, then 0 and 1. So there are no two same characters in a row. So pre0 and pre1 would be 0. The max is 0, so the answer is 0+1=1, which matches the first example. \n\nThe second example \"11011\" (the substring is \"11011\"). The first two characters are '1's \u2192 so pre1 increments by 1. Then between 0 and 1 (no same), then between 1 and 1 (the last two '1's \u2192 pre1 increments again. So the total pre1 for the substring would be 2. The pre0 would be 0. So the max is 2 \u2192 2+1=3, which matches the note's answer. \n\nThe third example \"011\" \u2192 the first two characters are '0' and '1' (no increment), then '1' and '1' \u2192 pre1 increments by 1. So the max is 1 \u2192 1+1=2, which matches the note's answer. \n\nAh! So the formula is correct. \n\nThe idea is that the minimal steps is equal to the maximum between the number of consecutive 0's pairs and consecutive 1's pairs, plus 1. \n\nWait why? Let me think:\n\nThe number of consecutive 0's pairs is the number of times two 0's are adjacent. Similarly for 1's. \n\nThe minimal steps is the maximum of these two counts plus 1. \n\nIn the first example, there are no such pairs, so 0+1=1. \n\nIn the second example, there are two such pairs (the two 1's at the start and the two 1's at the end \u2192 two pairs of 1's \u2192 pre1 is 2 \u2192 2+1=3. \n\nThird example has one pair of 1's \u2192 1+1=2. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nThe missing part in the code is the line for when the two consecutive characters are '1's. \n\nIn the code's loop:\n\nfor i in range(1,n):\n    c1,c2 = s[i-1], s[i]\n    pre0[i], pre1[i] = pre0[i-1], pre1[i-1]\n    if c1 == c2 == '0':\n        pre0[i] +=1\n    elif c1 == c2 == '1':\n        # TODO: Your code here\n        pre1[i] +=1\n\nSo the missing line is adding to pre1 when the two are '1's. \n\nSo the code for the '1's case is pre1[i] +=1. \n\nSo the completion for program2.py is to add that line. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code in the v1 == v2 case is:\n\nif len(indices[v1]) >=2:\n    res = min(res, (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1]))\n\nFor program2.py, the missing line is:\n\nelif c1 == c2 == '1':\n    pre1[i] +=1\n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nprogram1's missing part is the code for the v1 == v2 case.\n\nprogram2's missing part is the line for the '1's case."
