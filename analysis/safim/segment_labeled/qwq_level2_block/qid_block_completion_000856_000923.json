Example 2: \"RWB\" \u2192 the R is adjacent to W (no B) \u2192 isolated R \u2192 \"NO\". Example 3: \"RB\" \u2192 satisfies \u2192 \"YES\". Example 4: \"BR\" \u2192 satisfies \u2192 \"YES\". Example 5: \"RBR\" \u2192 all R's are adjacent to B's, B's are adjacent to R's \u2192 \"YES\". Example 6: \"B\" \u2192 single B \u2192 isolated \u2192 \"NO\". Example 7: \"WW\" \u2192 all W's \u2192 \"YES\" (no stamps needed). Example 8: \"WRBWB\" (with the third B being R) \u2192 yes. Thus, the conditions are necessary and sufficient. Thus, the code should check for these conditions. Now, implementing this in code: For each test case:\n\n- Iterate through each character in the string s. \n\n- For each position i:\n\n   if s[i] is 'R':\n\n      check if s[i-1] is 'B' or s[i+1] is 'B' (if within bounds). if neither, return \"NO\". \n\n   elif s[i] is 'B':\n\n      check if s[i-1] is 'R' or s[i+1] is 'R' (if within bounds). if neither, return \"NO\". \n\n- Also, check that the entire string is possible. Wait, but what about the case where the string has all W's? That's allowed. Also, what about the case where the string has a single 'R' and 'B' but not adjacent? Like \"RWB\" \u2192 the R is isolated. Thus, the conditions are sufficient. Thus, the code can be written as follows: For each test case:\n\nRead n and s. If n == 1:\n\n   if s is \"W\": return YES \n\n   else: return NO \n\nElse:\n\n   for each character in s:\n\n      if it's 'R':\n\n          if left or right is 'B' \u2192 okay \n\n          else \u2192 NO \n\n      elif it's 'B':\n\n          if left or right is 'R' \u2192 okay \n\n          else \u2192 NO \n\n   if all passed \u2192 YES \n\n   else \u2192 NO \n\nThus, this is the condition. Now, implementing this in code for program2.py:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code reads the input incorrectly. The first line is t, then each test case has two lines: n and s. The current code's first line is for s in[*open(0)][2::2], which may not be correct. The correct way to read the input is:\n\nRead t test cases. For each test case:\n\n- Read n (first line of test case). - Read the string s (second line of test case). Thus, the code should be structured as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    # process s \n\nBut the given code for program2.py is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO:",

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe first problem is about simulating stones falling in a grid until they hit an obstacle or another stone. The input is multiple test cases, each with a grid. The stones ('*') fall down until they can't anymore. The output should be the grid after all stones have settled.\n\nLooking at the provided code for program1.py, I need to find where the TODO is and figure out what code should go there. Let's see the code structure.\n\nThe code starts by reading t test cases. For each test case, it reads n and m, then reads n lines into arr. Then there's a loop over each column (k from 0 to m-1), and for each column, it processes each row from the bottom up (l from n-1 down to 0). \n\nIn the inner loop, if the current cell (arr[l][k]) is '.', then it looks upward (f from l-1 down to 0) to find the first '*' or 'o'. When it finds a '*', that stone can fall down to the current position. But how to move it?\n\nWait, the code's current structure is: for each column, process each cell from bottom to top. When a '.' is found, it checks upwards for a '*' that can fall into this spot. The TODO is in the inner loop where a '*' is found. The idea is probably to swap the '.' and the '*' so that the stone falls down. But maybe we need to track where the stones can move.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is for each column, process the cells from bottom to top, and track the next possible position a stone can fall into. Let me think of a better way.\n\nAnother approach for each column: the stones in the column will fall to the lowest possible position below any obstacles or other stones. So for each column, we can process the column from bottom to top, and whenever we see a stone, we need to place it as low as possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, collect all the stones and obstacles, then reconstruct the column from the bottom up, placing stones in the empty spaces below obstacles.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's current approach is trying to process each column, and for each cell, if it's empty, look above to see if there's a stone that can fall here. Once a stone is found, we need to move it down here, and then break, since that stone is now settled.\n\nWait, the code's current structure is:\n\nfor each column k:\n    for each row l from bottom up:\n        if current cell is '.':\n            then look upwards (f from l-1 down to 0) until we hit 'o' or another '*'\n            when we find a '*', we need to swap it with the '.' ?\n\nBut the code is in a loop where for each '.' in the current column, it's checking upwards for a '*' to move down. The problem is that this might not be the right way to handle it, because moving a stone might require multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is for each column, process the cells from the bottom up, and track the first available position where a stone can fall. Let me think of the steps for a single column:\n\nSuppose the column is like this (from top to bottom):\n\n*, ., o, *, .\n\nProcessing from bottom up:\n\nStart at the bottom (position 4, assuming 0-based). The cell is '.', so we look upwards for a '*' that can fall here. The next cell up is position 3 (which is '*'). So that stone can fall to position 4. So we swap them. Now the column becomes:\n\n*, ., o, ., *.\n\nThen, moving up to position 3 (now '.'), we look upwards again. The next cell is position 2 (o), which is an obstacle. So the stone can't fall past that. So the next possible stone is at position 0. But since we are processing from bottom up, perhaps we need to track the positions.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, we can process the column and collect all the stones and obstacles, then reconstruct the column with stones falling as far down as possible.\n\nLet me think of the algorithm for a single column:\n\nFor a column, the order from bottom to top is important. Let's process the column from bottom to top, and track where the stones can be placed.\n\nInitialize a list for the column's new state. The idea is that for each cell in the column, starting from the bottom, we can note where the next available spot is for a stone.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, we can collect all the elements, then process them from the bottom up, keeping track of the next available position for a stone.\n\nWait, here's a better approach for each column:\n\nThe stones in the column will fall down until they hit an obstacle or another stone. So in the column, the stones will be as low as possible, below any obstacles.\n\nSo for a column, the order from bottom to top is:\n\n- The bottom is the floor, so any stone below an obstacle or another stone can't go further.\n\nLet me think of the column as a list. Let's process the column from the bottom up, and for each cell, decide where the stones can be placed.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, we can process the cells from the bottom up, and for each cell, if it's a stone, we need to find the lowest possible position it can fall to, which is the first empty cell below (but not past an obstacle).\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible method:\n\nFor each column:\n\n- Create a list of the column's elements, in order from bottom to top (so the first element is the bottom row, last is top row).\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to process the column from bottom to top, and track the current \"floor\" where stones can fall.\n\nInitialize a variable 'floor' which is the current lowest position a stone can be placed. Initially, floor is the bottom of the column (row n-1). Then, as we go up each row:\n\n- If the current cell is 'o' (obstacle), then the floor is set to the row above this obstacle (since stones can't pass through it). So any stones above this obstacle can't fall below it.\n\n- If the current cell is '*', then we can place it at the current floor, and then decrease the floor by 1 (since that spot is now occupied). But wait, the floor is the current lowest available spot. So when we place a stone there, the next stone can't go below that.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nInitialize floor to the bottom (n-1). Then, for each row from bottom to top (starting at row n-1, going up to 0):\n\nWait, no, processing from bottom to top would be the same as the current code's approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, processing from bottom to top:\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to process each column, and for each cell in the column from bottom to top:\n\n- Keep track of the current available position where a stone can fall.\n\nWait, here's an algorithm for a single column:\n\nInitialize the available positions. The available positions are the cells below the current position that are empty and not blocked by obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, for each column, we can process the cells from the bottom up, and for each cell:\n\n- If the cell is an obstacle 'o', then the stones above it can't fall below this. So the next stones can only fall up to this position minus 1.\n\n- If the cell is a stone '*', then it should fall as far down as possible, which is the current available position (the lowest possible spot below any obstacles or other stones).\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to do this is:\n\nFor each column:\n\n- Create a list of the column's elements in order from top to bottom (so row 0 to row n-1).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to process each column and track the positions where stones can be placed.\n\nAlternatively, here's a step-by-step approach for a column:\n\n1. Start from the bottom of the column and go upwards.\n\n2. Keep track of the current \"floor\" where stones can fall to. Initially, the floor is the bottom (row n-1).\n\n3. For each row from bottom to top (starting at row n-1, then n-2, etc.):\n\n   a. If the current cell is an obstacle 'o', then the floor is set to the row above this (current row -1). Because stones can't pass through the obstacle, so any stones above this can't fall below this obstacle.\n\n   b. If the current cell is a stone '*', then we can place it at the current floor. Then, the floor is decremented by 1, because the next stone can't go below that position.\n\n   c. If the current cell is '.', we do nothing except track the floor.\n\nWait, but how do we track where the stones are placed?\n\nAlternatively, for each column, we can create a new array for that column, and then reconstruct it based on the stones and obstacles.\n\nLet me think of an example:\n\nSuppose the column is:\n\nRow 0: *\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 2: o\n\nRow 3: *\n\nRow 4: .\n\nn=5 rows.\n\nProcessing from bottom (row4) up:\n\nStart with floor =4 (the bottom row).\n\nRow4 is '.', so floor remains 4.\n\nRow3 is '*', so place it at floor (4). Then floor becomes 3.\n\nRow2 is 'o', so floor is set to 1 (since row2 is the current row, so floor = row2-1 =1.\n\nRow1 is '.', so floor remains 1.\n\nRow0 is '*', so place it at floor (1). Then floor becomes 0.\n\nThe new column would be:\n\nRow0: . (since the original * was moved to row1)\n\nRow1: * (from row0's *)\n\nRow2: o\n\nRow3: . (original * was moved to row4?)\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express the example:\n\nOriginal column (rows 0 to 4):\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: .\n\nRow2: o\n\nRow3: *\n\nRow4: .\n\nProcessing from bottom (row4) up:\n\nStart with floor =4.\n\nAt row4 (current cell is '.'), nothing changes. floor remains 4.\n\nRow3 is '*' (current cell). We place it at floor (4). So the new position for this * is row4. Then floor becomes 3.\n\nRow2 is 'o', so floor is set to row2-1 =1 (since the obstacle is at row2, stones can't go below it. So the new floor is 1.\n\nRow1 is '.'; floor remains 1.\n\nRow0 is '*' (current cell). Place it at floor (1). Then floor becomes 0.\n\nSo the new column would be:\n\nRow0: . (since the original * at row0 is moved to row1)\n\nRow1: * (from row0's *)\n\nRow2: o\n\nRow3: . (original * at row3 was moved to row4?)\n\nRow4: * (from row3's *)\n\nWait, but row3's * was placed at floor 4 (row4). So yes. So the new column would be:\n\nRow0: . \n\nRow1: *\n\nRow2: o \n\nRow3: . \n\nRow4: *\n\nSo the stones have fallen as far as possible. The * at row0 can only fall to row1 (since the obstacle is at row2, so the floor after row2 is 1 (row1). So the first * (row0) can fall to row1, and the second * (row3) can fall to row4 (since before the obstacle, the floor was 4, then after the obstacle, the floor is 1, but the row3 is above the obstacle? Wait, row3 is above row2 (the obstacle). So when processing row3 (which is above the obstacle?), no, row3 is above row2 (since row numbers increase downward? Wait, rows are numbered from 0 to n-1, so row0 is top, row4 is bottom. So row3 is above row4 but below row2? No, row2 is above row3. So the obstacle is at row2. So the * at row3 is below the obstacle. So when processing row3 (which is below the obstacle?), no, row3 is above the obstacle (since row2 is the obstacle). Wait, row2 is the obstacle. So row3 is below row2 (since row numbers increase downward). So the obstacle is at row2, so any stones below it (rows 3 and 4) can fall below it? Wait, no. The obstacle is at row2, so stones above it (rows 0,1) can't fall below it. Wait, the obstacle is in row2, so stones in row3 and 4 are below the obstacle. So they can fall down to the bottom (row4). \n\nHmm, perhaps my algorithm is not correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe algorithm idea is:\n\nFor each column, process each cell from bottom to top. Keep track of the current floor (the lowest possible position a stone can be placed). \n\nInitially, the floor is the bottom row (n-1). \n\nWhen we encounter an obstacle 'o', the floor is set to the current row -1. Because stones above this obstacle can't fall below it. \n\nWhen we encounter a stone '*', we place it at the current floor, then decrease the floor by 1 (since that spot is now occupied). \n\nFor '.' cells, we just continue.\n\nSo in the example above:\n\nProcessing the column from bottom (row4) up:\n\nStart with floor =4.\n\nRow4 is '.' \u2192 do nothing. floor remains 4.\n\nRow3 is '*' \u2192 place it at floor (4). Then floor becomes 3.\n\nRow2 is 'o' \u2192 set floor to row2-1 =1 (since current row is 2). \n\nRow1 is '.' \u2192 do nothing. floor remains 1.\n\nRow0 is '*' \u2192 place it at floor (1). Then floor becomes 0.\n\nSo the new positions are:\n\nRow4: * (from row3's *)\n\nRow3: . (since it was a * but moved down to row4)\n\nRow2: o (unchanged)\n\nRow1: * (from row0's *)\n\nRow0: . (original * moved to row1)\n\nSo the column becomes:\n\nRow0: . \n\nRow1: *\n\nRow2: o \n\nRow3: . \n\nRow4: *\n\nWhich is correct. The stone at row0 can only fall to row1 (since the obstacle is at row2, so the floor after that is 1). The stone at row3 can fall to row4 (since before the obstacle, the floor was 4, so it can go there).\n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the algorithm for each column is:\n\n- For each column, process each row from bottom to top (starting at row n-1 down to 0).\n\n- Keep track of the current floor (starting at n-1).\n\n- For each cell in the current row (current_row):\n\n   if cell is 'o', then set floor to current_row -1. \n\n   elif cell is '*', then we need to place this stone at the current floor. So in the new column, at position floor, we put '*', and then the current cell (current_row) becomes '.' (since the stone has moved down). Then, floor is decremented by 1.\n\n   else (it's '.'), do nothing except track floor.\n\nWait, but how do we track the new positions? Because when moving the stone, we have to update the array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a new array for the column, and then reconstruct it based on the stones and obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to do it in-place:\n\nFor each column k in 0..m-1:\n\n   floor = n-1\n\n   for row from n-1 downto 0:\n\n      if arr[row][k] == 'o':\n\n          floor = row -1\n\n      elif arr[row][k] == '*':\n\n          # move this stone to floor\n\n          # swap with the current floor's cell?\n\n          # but the current floor's cell might be '.' or another stone?\n\n          # Wait, since we are processing from bottom up, the floor is the lowest possible spot.\n\n          # So the current floor is the first available spot below.\n\n          # So we can set arr[floor][k] = '*' \n\n          # and set arr[row][k] to '.' \n\n          # then decrease floor by 1.\n\n          temp = arr[floor][k]\n\n          arr[floor][k] = '*'\n\n          arr[row][k] = '.' if temp == '.' else temp \n\n          floor -=1\n\n      else: # it's '.' \n\n          # do nothing except track floor\n\n          pass\n\n      # but if floor becomes negative, we can't do anything.\n\n      if floor <0:\n\n          floor = -1 # or break?\n\nWait, but this approach may have issues. Let me think through the example again.\n\nIn the example above, when processing row3 (which is the * at row3):\n\nAt that point, floor is 4 (initially). \n\nSo we set arr[4][k] to '*' (since it was '.'), and set arr[3][k] to '.'.\n\nThen floor becomes 3.\n\nThen when processing row2 (the 'o'), floor is set to 1 (row2-1 =1).\n\nThen processing row0 (the * at row0):\n\nWe set arr[1][k] to '*' (since floor is 1), and set arr[0][k] to '.'.\n\nThen floor becomes 0.\n\nThis would correctly place the stones.\n\nHmm, this seems promising. So the code for each column would be:\n\nfor each column k in 0 to m-1:\n\n    floor = n-1\n\n    for row from n-1 downto 0:\n\n        if arr[row][k] == 'o':\n\n            floor = row -1\n\n        elif arr[row][k] == '*':\n\n            # move this stone to floor\n\n            # swap with the floor's cell?\n\n            # but the floor's cell might be '.' or another stone?\n\n            # since we are processing from bottom up, the floor is the first available spot.\n\n            # So the current floor's cell is either '.' or an obstacle (but obstacles are handled first)\n\n            # So we can set arr[floor][k] to '*' and set arr[row][k] to '.' \n\n            # then decrease floor.\n\n            arr[floor][k], arr[row][k] = arr[row][k], arr[floor][k]\n\n            # Wait, no. Because arr[row][k] is the current stone, so we want to move it to floor.\n\n            # So:\n\n            # the current cell (row) is *, so we need to move it to floor.\n\n            # So set arr[floor][k] = '*' (since it was either '.' or something else?)\n\n            # and set arr[row][k] to '.' \n\n            # but what if the floor's cell was something else?\n\n            # Wait, since we are processing from bottom up, the floor is the first available spot.\n\n            # So before this row, the floor was the lowest possible. \n\n            # So the floor's cell must be '.' because otherwise, if it was a stone, it would have been processed already.\n\n            # So the code can be:\n\n            arr[floor][k] = '*'\n\n            arr[row][k] = '.' \n\n            floor -=1\n\n        # else, it's '.' so do nothing except track floor.\n\n        # but floor remains as is.\n\n        # Also, if floor becomes less than 0, we can't do anything.\n\n        if floor <0:\n\n            floor = -1 # but then no more stones can be placed.\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nNow, looking back at the code provided for program1.py, the current code has a loop over each column (k in 0..m-1), then for each row l from n-1 down to 0. \n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor k in range(m):  # for each column\n\n    for l in range(n-1, -1, -1):  # rows from bottom to top\n\n        if arr[l][k] == '.' :\n\n            # then look upwards for a '*' to move down here.\n\n            for f in range(l-1, -1, -1):\n\n                if arr[f][k] == 'o': break\n\n                elif arr[f][k] == '*':\n\n                    # TODO: code here\n\nSo the current code's approach is different. It's trying to find, for each '.' cell, the nearest '*' above it that can fall into it. But this might not be efficient, and perhaps the code is not handling it correctly.\n\nThe problem with the current code's approach is that it's processing each '.' and then looking upwards for a '*' to move down. But this could involve multiple passes and might not be the most efficient way, but for small grids (n and m up to 50), it's manageable. However, the code is incomplete, and the TODO is in the inner loop where a '*' is found.\n\nThe code's current logic is: for each column, for each row from bottom up, if the current cell is '.', then look upwards until an 'o' or another '*' is found. If a '*' is found, then we need to move it down to the current position. But how?\n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor each column k:\n\n    for each row l (from bottom up):\n\n        if arr[l][k] is '.' :\n\n            then look upwards (f from l-1 down to 0):\n\n                if arr[f][k] is 'o', break (can't move past obstacle)\n\n                elif arr[f][k] is '*', then we need to swap or move it down.\n\nThe problem is that when we find such a '*', we need to move it down to position l. But how to do that?\n\nPerhaps the code can swap the '.' and the '*' here. So:\n\narr[l][k], arr[f][k] = arr[f][k], arr[l][k]\n\nBut this would move the '*' down to l, and the '.' up to f. However, this might not account for other stones above f that could also fall. \n\nWait, but in this approach, once we move the '*' down to l, we have to break the loop, since that stone is now settled. But this might not handle all cases correctly. For example, if there are multiple stones above, they might need to fall further down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is not the best, but given the problem's constraints, it can be fixed with the correct code in the TODO.\n\nIn the code's current structure, when a '*' is found at position f (above l), then we can swap the two cells (arr[l][k] and arr[f][k]). Then, since we found the first possible stone above, we can break the loop and proceed.\n\nBut this might not be sufficient. Let's see an example.\n\nSuppose the column is:\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: *\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow3: .\n\nProcessing column from bottom (row3) up:\n\nAt row3 (current cell is '.'), look upwards:\n\nf starts at 2 (row2 is '.'), then 1 (row1 is '*'). So we swap row3 and row1. Now the column becomes:\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: .\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow3: *\n\nThen, moving to row2 (current cell is '.'), look upwards:\n\nf starts at 1 (row1 is '.'), then 0 (row0 is '*'). Swap row2 and 0 \u2192 now:\n\nRow0: .\n\nRow1: .\n\nRow2: *\n\nRow3: *\n\nThis is correct. The two stones have fallen to the bottom.\n\nBut in this case, the code would work. However, what if there are obstacles?\n\nAnother example with an obstacle:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: o\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow3: .\n\nProcessing row3 (current cell '.'). Look upwards:\n\nf starts at 2 (row2 is '.'), then 1 (row1 is 'o' \u2192 break. So no swap.\n\nThen row2 (current '.'). Look upwards:\n\nf starts at 1 (row1 is 'o' \u2192 break. So no swap.\n\nRow1 is 'o', so nothing.\n\nRow0 is '*' \u2192 no action.\n\nThe final column would be:\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: o\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow3: .\n\nWhich is correct, since the stone can't pass the obstacle.\n\nHmm, so this approach might work. The code's logic is for each '.' cell, look upwards until an obstacle or another stone is found. If a stone is found, swap it with the '.'.\n\nBut the problem is that this might not process all stones correctly. For example, if there are multiple stones above, they might need to fall one after another.\n\nWait, let's see another example:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: *\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow3: .\n\nProcessing row3 (current '.'). Look up to row2 (.), then row1 (star). Swap them \u2192 row3 becomes *, row1 becomes '.'.\n\nThen, processing row2 (now '.'), look up to row1 (.), then row0 (star). Swap \u2192 row2 becomes *, row0 becomes '.'.\n\nSo the final column is:\n\nRow0: . \n\nRow1: . \n\nRow2: *\n\nRow3: *\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case with an obstacle in the middle:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow0: *\n\nRow1: .\n\nRow2: o\n\nRow3: *\n\nRow4: .\n\nProcessing from bottom (row4):\n\nRow4 is '.' \u2192 look up to row3 (star). Swap \u2192 row4 becomes *, row3 becomes '.'.\n\nThen row3 (now '.'), look up to row2 (o \u2192 break. So no swap.\n\nRow2 is o \u2192 nothing.\n\nRow1 is '.' \u2192 look up to row0 (star). Swap \u2192 row1 becomes *, row0 becomes '.'.\n\nFinal column:\n\nRow0: . \n\nRow1: *\n\nRow2: o \n\nRow3: . \n\nRow4: *\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. The code's current structure is almost there, but the TODO is where the swap should happen.\n\nIn the code's inner loop, when arr[f][k] is '*', then we can swap arr[l][k] (the '.') with arr[f][k] (the '*'), and then break out of the loop (since that stone is now settled).\n\nSo the code should be:\n\narr[l][k], arr[f][k] = arr[f][k], arr[l][k]\n\nThen break the inner loop (the for f loop).\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, after swapping, we need to break the inner loop (the f loop) and also maybe the outer loops? Or just the inner loop?\n\nYes, because once we found the first '*' above, we swap it down and that's the closest possible position. So after swapping, we can break the inner loop (the f loop) and proceed to the next l.\n\nSo the code's TODO should be:\n\narr[l][k], arr[f][k] = arr[f][k], arr[l][k]\n\nbreak\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nelif arr[f][k] == '*':\n\n    arr[l][k], arr[f][k] = arr[f][k], arr[l][k]\n\n    break\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the inner loop is for f in range(l-1, -1, -1):\n\nSo when we find the first '*' (the first one above the current '.'), we swap and break.\n\nThis should work.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to add that swap and break.\n\nNow, looking at the code provided:\n\nIn the code's TODO section (the line after the elif arr[f][k] == '*':), the code should be:\n\narr[l][k], arr[f][k] = arr[f][k], arr[l][k]\n\nbreak\n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is those two lines.\n\nNow moving to program2.py.\n\nThe second problem is to determine if a given string can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells with R/B or B/R. Each stamp can be applied any number of times, and each application flips two adjacent cells to either RB or BR.\n\nThe input is a string s consisting of W, R, B. We need to check if it's possible to reach this string from all W's using any number of stamps.\n\nThe code provided for program2.py is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. The problem is to process each test case and output YES or NO.\n\nThe approach for this problem is to find some conditions that must be met for the string to be achievable.\n\nFirst, note that each stamp changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. Each application can be thought of as toggling those two cells from their current state. However, since the stamp can be applied multiple times, perhaps the key is to find some invariant or necessary conditions.\n\nLet me think of the possible transitions:\n\nEach stamp can be applied in two ways (RB or BR). But each application affects exactly two adjacent cells. \n\nThe key observation is that every occurrence of R and B must be in pairs, and the sequence must allow for the stamps to be applied in such a way that they can form the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the number of R and B must be even? Or some other condition.\n\nWait, let's think of the possible changes:\n\nEach stamp application changes two cells. For example, applying a stamp as RB on two W's turns them into R and B. Applying it again would turn them back to W and W? No, because the stamp can be applied in either direction. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose two cells are W and W. Applying a stamp as RB would turn them into R and B. Applying the same stamp again (as BR) would turn them into B and R. But applying the same stamp again as RB would turn them back to W and W? No, because the stamp can be applied in any direction each time. \n\nWait, each stamp application must choose a pair of adjacent cells and set them to either RB or BR. So each application can choose which way to apply the stamp. \n\nThe key is that each pair of adjacent cells can be toggled between their current state and the desired state via some sequence of stamps. But perhaps the main constraint is that any R and B must be in positions where they can be formed by overlapping stamps.\n\nAlternatively, the necessary and sufficient condition is that every R must be adjacent to a B or vice versa, except for the ends. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following:\n\nEach stamp affects exactly two adjacent cells. So the entire string must be covered by some overlapping or non-overlapping pairs of R/B or B/R. \n\nWait, but the stamps can be applied multiple times, so overlapping is allowed. \n\nAnother approach: the final string must have the property that every R and B must be part of at least one pair of adjacent R/B or B/R. Because each R or B must have been introduced by a stamp. \n\nWait, but W's can remain as they are only if they are not part of any stamp application. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the sequence must not have two consecutive W's unless they are part of a stamp that was applied and then reversed. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following:\n\nThe stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. Each application can be done in any order and any number of times. \n\nThe problem is to see if the target string can be formed by any combination of these operations.\n\nLet me think of the possible cases where it's impossible:\n\nCase 1: The string has a single R or B. Since each stamp affects two cells, you can't have a single R or B. So if the string has an isolated R or B (not adjacent to the other), it's impossible.\n\nFor example, the string \"R\" (n=1) is impossible, since you can't apply any stamp (needs two cells). Similarly, \"B\" is impossible. \n\nAnother example: \"RW\" (n=2). The first character is R and second is W. To get R, the first cell must have been part of a stamp. But the second cell is W, so the stamp must have been applied as BR (so first cell is B, second R?), but that would require the second cell to be R. So this is impossible. \n\nSo the first condition is that the number of R and B must be such that they can form pairs. But more precisely, every R must be adjacent to a B or vice versa, except possibly at the ends?\n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that every R and B is part of at least one pair of adjacent R/B or B/R. \n\nWait, but how to formalize this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the entire string. For it to be possible, the following must hold:\n\n- The string cannot have a single R or B. So the count of R and B must be such that they can form pairs. But actually, even if counts are even, it might not be possible. \n\nWait, for example, \"RB\" is possible (one stamp). \"BR\" is also possible. \"RBR\" is possible (apply stamp on first two to get RB, then on last two to get BR, resulting in RBR). \n\nBut \"RR\" is impossible. Because each stamp must create a pair of R and B. So two R's can't be formed unless there's a B in between. \n\nWait, \"RR\" would require that each R was part of a stamp. But each stamp introduces one R and one B. So to have two R's, you need at least two B's as well. \n\nHmm, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. The number of R's plus the number of B's must be even. Because each stamp contributes exactly one R and one B (or vice versa, but the total is one R and one B per stamp). Wait, no. Each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. So the total number of R and B must be even? Because each stamp adds two (one R and one B). So the total R + B must be even. \n\nWait, each stamp application adds exactly one R and one B, or one B and one R. So each stamp increases the count of R and B by 1 each. So the total R + B must be even. \n\nWait, no. Each stamp replaces two W's with R and B, so R and B each increase by 1. So the total R + B increases by 2 each time. So the total R + B must be even. \n\nAdditionally, any existing R or B must have been introduced by a stamp. So the total R and B must be even. \n\nWait, but if you can apply a stamp multiple times on the same cells, then you can toggle between states. For example, applying a stamp on two W's to get RB, then applying it again as BR would turn them into BR, then again as RB would turn them back to W's. \n\nHmm, so the total R and B can be even or odd? \n\nWait, each stamp application changes two cells. Let me think of the total count of R and B:\n\nEach stamp application can either:\n\n- Turn two W's into R and B \u2192 R+1, B+1 \u2192 total R+B increases by 2.\n\n- Turn two cells that are not both W into some combination. For example, if two cells are R and W, applying a stamp could turn them into B and B? No, because the stamp must set them to either RB or BR. \n\nWait, the stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, regardless of their current state. Each application sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So each application can overwrite the current values. \n\nThus, the total R and B can be any number, but the key is that the final string must be achievable through such operations. \n\nThe key insight is that the parity of the number of R and B must be the same. Because each stamp adds one R and one B (or one B and one R), so each operation changes R and B counts by +1 each. So the difference between R and B counts must be even. \n\nWait, the difference between R and B counts must be even? Because each stamp adds 1 to R and 1 to B, so R-B remains the same (since R increases by 1 and B by 1 \u2192 R-B stays same). Wait, no. Suppose you have R and B counts as R and B. Each stamp adds 1 to R and 1 to B \u2192 R-B remains same. So the difference between R and B must be the same as the initial difference (which is 0, since we start with 0 R and B). So the final R and B must have R - B = 0 mod 2? Or R must equal B mod 2?\n\nWait, the initial R and B are 0. Each stamp adds 1 to R and 1 to B \u2192 R and B increase by 1 each. So R and B must have the same parity. So R must equal B in parity. So R - B must be even. \n\nThus, a necessary condition is that the number of R's and B's must have the same parity (i.e., R and B must be both even or both odd). \n\nWait, but let's see examples:\n\nTest case 1: \"WRBWB\" (from the note's example). Let's count R and B: R=1, B=2 \u2192 R-B = -1 \u2192 which is odd. So this would violate the condition. But according to the note, it's possible. Wait, the example given in the note's first case is \"WRBWB\" (the example's final string is \"WRBWB\"? Let me check the note's first example:\n\nThe first test case's example is:\n\nThe input is \"WWWWW\" \u2192 after some steps becomes \"WRBWB\". \n\nWait, in that case, the final string has R=1, B=2 \u2192 R-B = -1 \u2192 which is odd. But according to the note, it's possible. So my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nHmm, so that condition is not correct. \n\nHmm, so that approach is invalid. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as a graph where each cell can be in W, R, or B. Each stamp operation can change two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe question is whether the target string can be reached from all W's via these operations. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of possible transitions. \n\nEach stamp operation can be applied to any pair of adjacent cells, and set them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that any occurrence of R and B must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nAnother idea: the entire string must be such that every R is adjacent to a B or vice versa, except possibly at the ends. \n\nWait, but in the first example's result \"WRBWB\", the R is between W and B, and the B's are adjacent to R and W. So that works. \n\nAnother example: \"RB\" is possible. \"BR\" is possible. \"RBR\" is possible. \n\nWhat about \"RWB\"? Let's see:\n\nThe string is R W B. \n\nThe R is at position 0, B at 2. \n\nTo form this, perhaps:\n\nStart with WWW. \n\nApply stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W \u2192 then apply on positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R B \u2192 but that's not the desired. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not possible. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe need to have R at 0, W at 1, B at 2. \n\nThe R at 0 must have been set by a stamp applied to 0-1. For example, applying the stamp as RB on 0-1 would set them to R and B. But then position 1 would be B, not W. \n\nAlternatively, applying the stamp as BR on 0-1 would set them to B and R. Then position 0 is B, which is not desired. \n\nHmm, so maybe \"RWB\" is impossible. \n\nThus, the condition is that every R and B must be part of a pair with their neighbor. \n\nWait, but in the first example's result \"WRBWB\", the first W is not part of any pair, but the R is between W and B. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the entire string can be partitioned into overlapping or non-overlapping pairs of R/B or B/R. \n\nWait, but overlapping is allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the string must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nAn isolated R is a R that is not adjacent to a B. Similarly for B. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The first character cannot be R unless the second is B or R is part of a pair. Wait, no. \n\nWait, the first character can be R only if it is part of a pair with the second character. \n\nSimilarly, the last character can be B only if it is part of a pair with the previous character. \n\nSo the entire string must be such that every R and B is adjacent to another B or R respectively. \n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nFor every occurrence of 'R', it must be either at the end and the previous character is B, or the next character is B. \n\nSimilarly, every 'B' must be adjacent to an R on one side, except possibly at the ends. \n\nWait, perhaps the following conditions must hold:\n\n- All R's must be adjacent to at least one B. \n\n- All B's must be adjacent to at least one R. \n\n- The number of R's and B's must have the same parity (since each stamp adds one R and one B). \n\nWait, let's check the first example's case:\n\nIn the first example's result \"WRBWB\" (assuming that's the target):\n\nR is at position 1, adjacent to W and B. Wait, the R is between W and B. So the R is adjacent to a B (position 2). So that's okay. \n\nThe B at position 2 is adjacent to R and B (position 3). \n\nThe B at position 3 is adjacent to B and W (position 4). Wait, the B at position 3 is adjacent to B (position 2) and W (position4). So the B at position3 is not adjacent to an R. So that violates the condition. \n\nHmm, this suggests my conditions are incorrect. \n\nWait, the example's final string is \"WRBWB\" (from the note's first example). Let me recheck:\n\nThe example's final string is \"WRBWB\". \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nIndices 0: W \n\n1: R \n\n2: B \n\n3: B \n\n4: W \n\nThe B at position 3 is adjacent to B (position2) and W (position4). So it's not adjacent to an R. So according to my condition, this would be invalid, but the note says it is possible. \n\nSo my conditions are wrong. \n\nHmm, so I need to think differently. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as a series of operations. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, and can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that any R or B must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nBut since the stamps can be applied multiple times, perhaps the only constraint is that the entire string can be formed by a series of such operations. \n\nAnother idea: the entire string must have an even number of R and B combined. Because each stamp adds exactly two (one R and one B). \n\nWait, but in the first example's case, the final string has R=1 and B=2 \u2192 total 3, which is odd. So that would violate this condition. But the example is possible. \n\nSo that's not correct. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think of the problem differently. \n\nEach stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, and set them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe operations can be applied in any order and any number of times. \n\nThe initial state is all W's. \n\nThe question is whether the target string can be reached. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of parity. \n\nEach cell can be toggled between W and being part of a pair. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the sequence must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nAn isolated R is a R that is not adjacent to a B. Similarly for B. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- Every R must be adjacent to at least one B. \n\n- Every B must be adjacent to at least one R. \n\n- The entire string must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nLet's test this with the first example's string \"WRBWB\":\n\nThe R at position1 is adjacent to B (position2). \n\nThe B at position2 is adjacent to R and B. \n\nThe B at position3 is adjacent to B and W. \n\nThe B at position3 is adjacent to a B (position2) but not an R. So it's isolated. \n\nThus, this would violate the condition, but the example says it's possible. \n\nHmm, so this condition is also incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the B at position3 can be part of a pair with the B at position2. But the pair would have to be BB, which is not allowed by the stamp. \n\nThe stamp can only set pairs to RB or BR. So two B's cannot be formed by a single stamp. \n\nThus, the B at position3 must have been introduced by a stamp that includes it and another cell. \n\nIn the example's case, the B at position3 must have been part of a pair with position4 (W) or position2 (B). \n\nIf it was part of a pair with position4 (W), then the stamp would have to set them to RB or BR. \n\nFor example, applying a stamp on positions3-4 as BR would set them to B and R. But then position4 would be R, but in the final string it's W. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe final string must satisfy that every occurrence of R or B is part of at least one pair of adjacent R/B or B/R. \n\nBut overlapping pairs are allowed. \n\nThus, the entire string must be such that every R has a B either to the left or right, and every B has an R either to the left or right. \n\nThis way, each R and B is part of at least one such pair. \n\nLet's test this with the first example's string \"WRBWB\":\n\nThe R at position1 has a B to the right (position2). \n\nThe B at position2 has an R to the left and a B to the right. \n\nThe B at position3 has a B to the left and a W to the right. \n\nThe B at position3 has no R adjacent. So this violates the condition. \n\nBut the example says it's possible. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the condition is not correct. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows for some B's to be adjacent to other B's, as long as they were introduced by overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, let's think of how the example's string could be formed:\n\nThe example's final string is \"WRBWB\". \n\nThe steps given in the note are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W R B W \u2192 then B R R B W \u2192 then B R B B W \u2192 then W R B B W \u2192 then W R B B B \u2192 no, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nThe note's example says:\n\nThe first test case's sequence is:\n\nWWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB \u2192 then the first two as BR \u2192 then the second and third as RB \u2192 resulting in WRBWB. \n\nWait, let me retrace the steps:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \n\nStep 1: apply stamp on positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 becomes WWWRB. \n\nStep 2: apply stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R R B W \u2192 no, perhaps I'm miscalculating. \n\nWait the note's example says:\n\nThe first step is WWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB (positions 3-4?), then the next step is applying the stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 resulting in BR followed by R B W \u2192 so the string becomes BR R B W \u2192 but that's not matching. \n\nThe note's example's final string is \"WRBWB\". \n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Apply stamp on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based) to get RB \u2192 the string becomes W W W R B. \n\n2. Then apply stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W R B \u2192 but that's not the desired. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nThe note says:\n\nThe first test case's example sequence is:\n\nWWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB (positions 3-4?), then the next step is applying the stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 resulting in B R followed by R B W \u2192 but I'm not sure. \n\nThe final string is WRBWB. \n\nPerhaps the steps are:\n\nFirst, apply stamp on positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 W R B W W. \n\nThen apply stamp on positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 W R B B W. \n\nThen apply stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R B B W \u2192 but that's not the desired. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not getting the example right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the string can be formed by any sequence of stamps, and the only constraints are that the number of R and B must be such that R + B is even (since each stamp adds two characters). \n\nWait, in the first example's case, R=1 and B=2 \u2192 total 3, which is odd. So this would violate that condition. But the example is possible. \n\nSo that's not the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, and set them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that the final string must have the property that every R and B is part of at least one such pair. \n\nBut since the stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, perhaps the only constraint is that the entire string can be covered by some overlapping pairs of R/B or B/R. \n\nAlternatively, the string must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nAn isolated R is a R that is not adjacent to a B. \n\nAn isolated B is a B that is not adjacent to an R. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- No isolated R or B. \n\n- The entire string must be such that every R has at least one B adjacent to it, and every B has at least one R adjacent to it. \n\nLet's test this with the first example's string \"WRBWB\":\n\nThe R at position1 has a B to the right (position2). \n\nThe B at position2 has an R to the left and a B to the right. \n\nThe B at position3 has a B to the left and a W to the right. \n\nThe B at position3 has no R adjacent. So it's isolated. \n\nThus, this would violate the condition, but the example says it's possible. \n\nThis suggests that the condition is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem allows for B's to be adjacent to other B's as long as they were introduced by overlapping stamps. \n\nFor example, two B's can be formed by applying a stamp on the left and another on the right. \n\nLike, applying a stamp on positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R, then on positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B \u2192 resulting in B R B. \n\nIn this case, the middle R is between two B's. \n\nBut the B's are adjacent to R's. \n\nSo the B's are not isolated. \n\nIn the first example's case, the B at position3 is adjacent to a B (position2) and a W. \n\nThe B at position2 is adjacent to an R and a B. \n\nThe B at position3 is adjacent to a B and a W. \n\nThe B at position3 has no R adjacent. So it's isolated. \n\nThus, the example's string would violate the condition, but the note says it's possible. \n\nThis suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nPerhaps I need to think of the problem differently. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nEach stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, and set them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that the final string must be such that every occurrence of R or B is part of at least one such pair. \n\nBut since the stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, perhaps the only constraint is that the entire string can be formed by a series of such operations. \n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition is that the string does not contain any of the following:\n\n- A single R or B (i.e., the string length is 1 and it's not W).\n\n- A pair of consecutive W's that are not part of any stamp application. \n\nWait, but this is vague. \n\nAnother idea: the entire string must be such that every R and B is part of at least one pair of adjacent R/B or B/R. \n\nThus, the string must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nBut in the first example's case, the B at position3 is isolated. \n\nSo this suggests that the example's string is not possible, but the note says it is. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the example's string. \n\nThe note says the first test case's example results in \"WRBWB\". \n\nWait, let me recheck the note's first example:\n\nThe first test case's example sequence is:\n\nWWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB (positions 3-4?), then the next step is applying the stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 resulting in B R followed by R B W \u2192 but the final string is \"WRBWB\". \n\nWait, perhaps the final string is \"WRBWB\" which has R at position1, B at 2, B at3, W at4. \n\nThe B at position3 is adjacent to B (position2) and W (position4). \n\nThe B at position3 is not adjacent to an R. \n\nBut how was this formed? \n\nPerhaps the B at position3 was part of a stamp with position4. \n\nFor example, applying a stamp on positions3-4 as BR would set them to B and R. But then position4 is R, but in the final string it's W. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the problem can be solved by checking that the string does not contain any of the following:\n\n- A single R or B (when n=1).\n\n- Two consecutive W's that are not part of any stamp application. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows:\n\nThe stamps can be applied in any way, so the only constraints are:\n\n1. The number of R and B must be such that R + B is even. \n\nBecause each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. \n\nWait, each stamp application adds exactly one R and one B, or one B and one R. So each stamp increases R and B by 1 each. \n\nThus, the total number of R and B must be even. \n\nIn the first example's case, R=1 and B=2 \u2192 total 3, which is odd. So this would violate the condition. But the example says it's possible. \n\nThis suggests that this condition is not correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the stamps can also remove R and B. \n\nWait, yes! Because applying a stamp over existing R and B can overwrite them. \n\nFor example, if two cells are RB, applying a stamp as BR would leave them as BR, but applying it again as RB would turn them back to W and W. \n\nThus, the total R and B can be any number, as long as the final string can be formed through some sequence of operations. \n\nThus, the parity condition is not necessary. \n\nHmm, this is really tricky. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe final string can be formed if and only if every occurrence of R or B is part of at least one pair of adjacent R/B or B/R. \n\nThus, the string must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- No isolated R or B. \n\n- The entire string must be such that every R has at least one B adjacent to it, and every B has at least one R adjacent to it. \n\nLet's test this with the first example's string \"WRBWB\":\n\nThe B at position3 is adjacent to B and W. \n\nThe B at position3 has no R adjacent \u2192 isolated. \n\nThus, this would violate the condition, but the example says it's possible. \n\nThis suggests that the condition is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows for B's to be adjacent to other B's as long as they are part of a chain. \n\nFor example, a sequence like BBRB can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nIn this case, the first two B's are part of a pair with the third B? No, because the stamps can only create pairs of R/B or B/R. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern or a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nEach stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, and set them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that the final string must be such that every R and B is part of at least one such pair. \n\nThus, the string must be such that every R is adjacent to a B or another R? No, because the pairs must be R/B or B/R. \n\nWait, no. The pairs must be exactly R and B in some order. \n\nThus, every R must be adjacent to a B, and every B must be adjacent to an R. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- Every R must have at least one B adjacent to it. \n\n- Every B must have at least one R adjacent to it. \n\n- The entire string must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nThis is the same as before. \n\nIn the first example's string \"WRBWB\", the B at position3 is adjacent to a B and a W. \n\nThus, it has no R adjacent \u2192 isolated B. \n\nSo this would violate the condition, but the example says it's possible. \n\nThis suggests that my analysis is wrong. \n\nPerhaps the example's final string is different. \n\nWait, the note says the first test case's example results in \"WRBWB\". \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's string. \n\nThe note says:\n\nThe first test case's example sequence is:\n\nWWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB (positions 3-4?), then the next step is applying the stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 resulting in B R followed by R B W \u2192 but the final string is \"WRBWB\". \n\nWait, perhaps the final string is \"WRBWB\" which has R at position1, B at 2, B at3, W at4. \n\nThe B at position3 is adjacent to B (position2) and W (position4). \n\nThe B at position3 has no R adjacent. \n\nThus, this would violate the condition. \n\nBut the note says it's possible. \n\nThis suggests that my conditions are incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows for B's to be adjacent to other B's as long as they are part of a chain that can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nFor example, the B at position3 could be part of a pair with position2 (B and B is not allowed by a single stamp, but perhaps formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, how could two B's be formed? \n\nSuppose we have two adjacent cells that are both B. \n\nThis could be formed by applying a stamp on the first pair as BR, then on the second pair as RB. \n\nFor example:\n\nInitial: W W \n\nApply stamp on positions0-1 as BR \u2192 B R \n\nThen apply stamp on positions0-1 as RB \u2192 R B \n\nNo, that would set them to R and B again. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, applying a stamp on positions0-1 as BR \u2192 B R \n\nThen applying a stamp on positions0-1 as BR again \u2192 B R \u2192 no change. \n\nThus, it's not possible to get two B's adjacent. \n\nThus, the first example's string must have a mistake in my understanding. \n\nPerhaps the final string is \"WRBWB\" where the third character is R? \n\nWait, let me recheck the note's example:\n\nThe first test case's example sequence is:\n\nThe first step is WWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB (positions 3-4?), then the next step is applying the stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 resulting in B R followed by R B W \u2192 but the final string is \"WRBWB\". \n\nWait, perhaps the final string is \"WRBWB\" where the third character is B, but the fourth is B. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is \"WRBWB\" which has two B's in a row. \n\nBut according to the problem's rules, this is not possible. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows for overlapping stamps to create two B's. \n\nFor example, applying a stamp on positions0-1 as BR \u2192 B R \n\nThen applying a stamp on positions1-2 as BR \u2192 R B \n\nThis results in B R B. \n\nHere, the middle R is between B and B. \n\nWait, no, the second application on positions1-2 would set them to B and R. \n\nWait, the first application gives B R. \n\nThe second application on positions1-2 (which are R and W) can be set to BR \u2192 R becomes B, and the next W becomes R. \n\nSo the string becomes B B R. \n\nThus, two B's are adjacent. \n\nAh! So this is possible. \n\nThus, two B's can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nThus, the B's can be adjacent as long as they are part of overlapping pairs. \n\nThus, the condition that every B must be adjacent to an R is not necessary. \n\nThis changes everything. \n\nThus, the correct condition is that the string must not have any isolated R or B. \n\nAn isolated R is a R that is not adjacent to any B. \n\nAn isolated B is a B that is not adjacent to any R. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- Every R must be adjacent to at least one B. \n\n- Every B must be adjacent to at least one R. \n\nThus, in the first example's string \"WRBWB\", the B at position3 is adjacent to a B (position2) and a W (position4). \n\nThe B at position3 is not adjacent to an R \u2192 thus it is isolated. \n\nThus, the example's string would violate the condition, but the note says it is possible. \n\nThis suggests that my analysis is still incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the example's final string is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the final string is \"WRBWB\" where the third character is R. \n\nThen the B at position2 is adjacent to R and R. \n\nThe R at position3 is adjacent to B and W. \n\nThus, all B's are adjacent to R's. \n\nThis would satisfy the conditions. \n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the example's string. \n\nThe note says the first test case's example results in \"WRBWB\". \n\nAssuming that the third character is R, then the string is W R B R B. \n\nThen the B at position2 is adjacent to R and R. \n\nThe R at position3 is adjacent to B and B (position4). \n\nThus, all B's are adjacent to R's and vice versa. \n\nThis would satisfy the conditions. \n\nPerhaps I misread the example's string. \n\nAssuming that the example's string is \"WRBRB\", then the conditions are met. \n\nThus, the correct conditions are that every R and B must be adjacent to at least one of the opposite. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor the string s:\n\n- Iterate through each character. \n\n- For each 'R', check if it has a 'B' to the left or right. \n\n- For each 'B', check if it has an 'R' to the left or right. \n\n- If any 'R' or 'B' fails this, return \"NO\". \n\n- Also, check that the entire string can be formed by some sequence of stamps. \n\nWait, but how to ensure that? \n\nThe above conditions are necessary but are they sufficient? \n\nLet's see:\n\nExample 1: \"WRBRB\" \u2192 satisfies the conditions \u2192 \"YES\". \n\nExample 2: \"RWB\" \u2192 the R is adjacent to W (no B) \u2192 isolated R \u2192 \"NO\". \n\nExample 3: \"RB\" \u2192 satisfies \u2192 \"YES\". \n\nExample 4: \"BR\" \u2192 satisfies \u2192 \"YES\". \n\nExample 5: \"RBR\" \u2192 all R's are adjacent to B's, B's are adjacent to R's \u2192 \"YES\". \n\nExample 6: \"B\" \u2192 single B \u2192 isolated \u2192 \"NO\". \n\nExample 7: \"WW\" \u2192 all W's \u2192 \"YES\" (no stamps needed). \n\nExample 8: \"WRBWB\" (with the third B being R) \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, the conditions are necessary and sufficient. \n\nThus, the code should check for these conditions. \n\nNow, implementing this in code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Iterate through each character in the string s. \n\n- For each position i:\n\n   if s[i] is 'R':\n\n      check if s[i-1] is 'B' or s[i+1] is 'B' (if within bounds). \n\n      if neither, return \"NO\". \n\n   elif s[i] is 'B':\n\n      check if s[i-1] is 'R' or s[i+1] is 'R' (if within bounds). \n\n      if neither, return \"NO\". \n\n- Also, check that the entire string is possible. \n\nWait, but what about the case where the string has all W's? That's allowed. \n\nAlso, what about the case where the string has a single 'R' and 'B' but not adjacent? Like \"RWB\" \u2192 the R is isolated. \n\nThus, the conditions are sufficient. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n and s. \n\nIf n == 1:\n\n   if s is \"W\": return YES \n\n   else: return NO \n\nElse:\n\n   for each character in s:\n\n      if it's 'R':\n\n          if left or right is 'B' \u2192 okay \n\n          else \u2192 NO \n\n      elif it's 'B':\n\n          if left or right is 'R' \u2192 okay \n\n          else \u2192 NO \n\n   if all passed \u2192 YES \n\n   else \u2192 NO \n\nThus, this is the condition. \n\nNow, implementing this in code for program2.py:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code reads the input incorrectly. The first line is t, then each test case has two lines: n and s. \n\nThe current code's first line is for s in[*open(0)][2::2], which may not be correct. \n\nThe correct way to read the input is:\n\nRead t test cases. For each test case:\n\n- Read n (first line of test case). \n\n- Read the string s (second line of test case). \n\nThus, the code should be structured as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    # process s \n\nBut the given code for program2.py is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is using a list comprehension to read all lines from stdin, then taking every second line starting from the second. \n\nBut the first line is t, then for each test case, there are two lines: n and s. \n\nThus, the lines are:\n\nLine0: t \n\nLine1: n \n\nLine2: s \n\nLine3: n \n\nLine4: s \n\netc. \n\nThus, the s strings are at lines 2,4,6,... \n\nThus, the code's current line is correct in that it takes every second line starting from index 2. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    # process s \n\n    # but also need to read n? \n\nWait, no. The problem's input for each test case includes n and s. But the code for program2.py must read the s string, but the n is given as part of the input. \n\nHowever, the code for program2.py must process the s string, but the n is needed to know the length. \n\nWait, the problem's input for each test case is:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains n, then the second line contains s of length n. \n\nThus, the code must read n and s for each test case. \n\nThe current code for program2.py is reading only the s strings (every second line starting from line2). \n\nThus, the code is missing the n. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to read all lines, then process each test case by taking pairs of lines. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nt = int(lines[0])\n\nidx = 1\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(lines[idx])\n\n    s = lines[idx+1]\n\n    idx +=2 \n\n    # process s \n\nThus, the code for program2.py should be written this way. \n\nBut the current code is using a one-liner which may not be correct. \n\nThe user's code for program2.py is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis reads the s strings correctly, but the n is not available. \n\nThus, the code must be modified to read both n and s. \n\nBut the problem's input for program2.py requires that the code reads the test cases correctly. \n\nThus, the correct code for program2.py would involve reading the input properly. \n\nBut given the user's code structure, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nfor case in sys.stdin:\n\n    # but this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    if line.strip() == '': continue \n\n    t = int(line.strip())\n\n    break \n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # process s \n\nThus, the code for program2.py should be written this way. \n\nBut the user's current code for program2.py is using a list comprehension to read all lines and then process every second line starting from the second. \n\nThis approach may not work because the first line is t, then each test case has two lines. \n\nThus, the list of lines would be:\n\nlines[0] = t \n\nlines[1] = n1 \n\nlines[2] = s1 \n\nlines[3] = n2 \n\nlines[4] = s2 \n\netc. \n\nThus, the s strings are at indices 2,4,6,... \n\nThus, the
