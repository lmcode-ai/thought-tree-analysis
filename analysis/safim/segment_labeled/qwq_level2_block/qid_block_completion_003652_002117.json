The problem statement says that the matrix b is built as follows:\n\n- b_{i,0} =0 for all i. \n\n- b_{0,i} = a_i for i >=1. \n\n- For 1<=i,j <=n, b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}. We are given the values of b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}, and need to find any possible a array, or output -1 if impossible. The approach here is to find a way to express a in terms of the given b values. Looking for patterns or recurrence relations. Let me think of small examples.",

      "text": "Take the sample input given in the note: \n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\nThe a array is [1,2,3], and the last column of b is [0,2,1]. Looking at the sample, the b matrix is built as follows. The first row (i=0) is [0,1,2,3]. Then for each i and j, the recurrence is b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] XOR b[i-1][j]. Wait, the problem says that the matrix is (n+1)x(n+1). So for n=3, the matrix is 4x4. The sample's b matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,2,3 (since b_{0,i} = a_i for i from 1 to 3). Row 1: 0, 1, 1^0=1, 2^1=3, then the last element (b_{1,3}) is 3 XOR 2 (since previous j-1 is 2, and i-1 is 0, j=3: b_{0,3}=3. So for i=1, j=3: b_{1,2} (which is 1) XOR b_{0,3} (3) \u2192 1 XOR3 = 2. Wait the sample's last column for row 1 is 0? Wait the sample says the output is [0,2,1]. Hmm, perhaps I need to recheck the sample. The note says that the sample a is [1,2,3], and the last column (b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n) is [0,2,1]. Wait for n=3, the last column is the 4th column (since indices are 0-based). Looking at row 1, column 3 (n=3):\n\nThe value is 0. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of the recurrence again. Let me try to compute the sample's b matrix. Sample a is [1,2,3], so n=3. The matrix is 4x4. Row 0: [0,1,2,3]\n\nRow 1: \n\nb_{1,0}=0 \n\nb_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} \u2192 0 XOR1 =1 \n\nb_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} \u21921 XOR2 =3 \n\nb_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} \u21923 XOR3 =0 So the last element of row1 is 0. Row2: b_{2,0}=0 \n\nb_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} \u21920 XOR1 =1 \n\nb_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} \u21921 XOR3 =2 \n\nb_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} \u21922 XOR0 = 2 \n\nWait but the sample says the second element (i=2) is 2, which matches. Row3:\n\nb_{3,0}=0 \n\nb_{3,1} =0 XOR b_{2,1} \u21920 XOR1 =1 \n\nb_{3,2} =1 XOR b_{2,2} \u21921 XOR2 =3 \n\nb_{3,3} =3 XOR b_{2,3} \u21923 XOR2 =1 So the last column for rows 1,2,3 are 0,2,1, which matches the sample. So the problem is to find a such that when building the matrix, the last column matches the given values. The key is to find a recurrence that allows us to compute a from the given b's last column. Let me think of the recurrence for the last column. The last column is for j =n. For each row i from 1 to n, the value b_{i,n} is computed as b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n}. Wait, but for j =n, the recurrence is:\n\nb_{i,n} = b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n} But this is a recursive formula. Let me see for the last column. Let me denote the given values as B[i] = b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n. \n\nWe need to find a such that when building the matrix, the B array is as given.",

      "text": "Let me see if there's a pattern or a way to express B in terms of a. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between the B array and the a array. Let me consider the last column. For row i, the value B[i] = b_{i,n} can be expressed in terms of previous rows. Let me try to find a pattern for small n. \n\nLet me try n=1. Then, the matrix is 2x2. a has one element a1. The last column (j=1) for row 1 is B[1] = b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} \u21920 XOR a1 = a1. So B[1] must equal a1. Thus, a1 = B[1]. So for n=1, the solution is straightforward. For n=2: \n\nThe B array has two elements B1 and B2. Let me see how they relate to a1 and a2. The matrix is 3x3. \n\nRow0: 0, a1, a2 \n\nRow1: 0, b11, b12, B1 = b13 (but n=2, so j=2 is the last column). Wait for n=2, the last column is j=2.

So to find a1 and a2, given B1 and B2: \n\nWe have B2 = a2 \u2192 a2 = B2 \n\nThen B1 = a1 XOR B2 \u2192 a1 = B1 XOR B2 \n\nThus, the solution is a1 = B1 XOR B2, a2 = B2. Hmm, interesting. For n=3, let's see. The B array is [B1, B2, B3]. We need to find a1, a2, a3. Let me see the relationships. From the sample, when a is [1,2,3], B is [0,2,1]. Let me see how the B values are computed. B3 = a3 \n\nBecause for row3, the last element is b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} Wait, let me compute step by step. Row3's last element (j=3):\n\nb_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} \n\nBut b_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2} \n\nb_{3,1} = b_{3,0} XOR b_{2,1} \u21920 XOR (b_{2,1} which is a1) \u2192 a1 \n\nb_{2,2} is a2 (from previous step for n=2). So b_{3,2} = a1 XOR a2 \n\nb_{2,3} is B2 (from row2's last element). Thus, b_{3,3} = (a1 XOR a2) XOR B2 But B2 is a2 (from n=2 case). Wait, in the sample, B2 is 2, which is a2. So substituting, B3 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a2 \u2192 a1. Wait in the sample, B3 is 1, which is a1. Yes, so B3 = a1. Wait, so for n=3, B3 = a1. Hmm, so for n=3, the B array is [B1, B2, B3], where B3 = a1. Wait, but in the sample, B3 is 1 which is a1. So for n=3, the last element B3 is a1. Hmm, so perhaps there's a pattern here. Looking at the examples:\n\nFor n=1: B1 = a1 \n\nn=2: B2 = a2 \n\nn=3: B3 = a1 \n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the pattern is that B_i = a_{n - i +1} for some i? Wait in n=3, B3 is a1, which is a_{3 -3 +1} = a1. B2 is a2 (a_{3-2+1}=a2). B1 is a1 XOR a2 (which is a1 XOR a2). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed in terms of the a array in a way that allows us to compute a from B. \n\nLooking at the n=3 case:\n\nWe have:\n\nB1 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3 \n\nWait no, in the sample, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3. B1 is 0, which is 1 XOR2 XOR3? 1+2+3=6, but XOR is 1^2=3, 3^3=0. Yes, so B1 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3 \u2192 (1^2)=3, then 3^3=0. Wait, but how does that fit into the pattern? Alternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed as the cumulative XOR of certain elements. Alternatively, let's think recursively. Let me see for general n. \n\nSuppose we have the B array for n elements. Let me see for each B_i (the i-th element in the given array, which is b_{i,n}). We can try to find a recurrence for B_i in terms of a and previous B's. Let me think of the last column. The value B_i = b_{i,n} can be expressed as follows:\n\nLooking at the recurrence for b_{i,n}:\n\nb_{i,n} = b_{i, n-1} XOR b_{i-1, n} \n\nBut b_{i-1,n} is B_{i-1} (since it's the (i-1)th row's last element). So B_i = b_{i,n-1} XOR B_{i-1} But what is b_{i,n-1}? Hmm, perhaps we can find a way to express b_{i,n-1} in terms of a and previous B's. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where B_i is the XOR of a certain subset of the a array. Looking at the examples:\n\nFor n=1: B1 = a1 \n\nn=2: B1 = a1 XOR a2, B2 = a2 \n\nn=3: B1 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3, B2 = a2 XOR a3, B3 = a1 \n\nWait, in the sample for n=3, B2 is 2, which is a2. But according to this, B2 would be a2 XOR a3 (2 XOR3=1), which doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps my previous assumption is wrong. Wait in the sample for n=3, B2 is 2. Looking back, for row2's last element (B2):\n\nb_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} \n\nb_{2,2} is a2 (from n=2 case), and b_{1,3} is B1 (0). So 2 XOR0 =2 \u2192 which matches. So B2 = a2 XOR B1. Wait, B1 is 0, so a2 XOR0 = a2 \u2192 yes. Hmm, so B2 = a2 XOR B1. Similarly, B1 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3. Wait, but how to express this in terms of a and B's. Alternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed as follows:\n\nLet me think of the B array as B[1], B[2], ..., B[n]. We can try to find a recurrence for B[i] in terms of a and previous B's. Let me see for n=3:\n\nB3 = a1 \n\nB2 = a2 XOR B1 \n\nB1 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3 \n\nHmm, but how to get a1 from B3. Alternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed as the cumulative XOR of a's in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps the a array can be derived by reversing the B array and applying some operations. Looking at the sample for n=3:\n\nB array is [0,2,1]. The a array is [1,2,3]. If we reverse the B array, we get [1,2,0]. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the a array can be computed as follows:\n\na_i = B_{n} XOR B_{n-1} XOR ... XOR B_{n -i +1} Wait, let's see for the sample:\n\nFor a1 =1, which is B3 (1). a2 =2 \u2192 B3 XOR B2 \u2192 1 XOR2 =3 \u2192 no. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps a_i = B_{i} XOR B_{i-1} ... Wait for n=3:\n\na3 = B1 XOR B2 XOR B3? \n\n0 XOR2 XOR1 =3 \u2192 yes. a2 = B2 XOR B3 \u2192 2 XOR1 =3 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's think of the B array as a binary representation and see if there's a pattern. Another approach: Let's try to find a recurrence for a_i in terms of the B array. Suppose we have the B array for n elements. We can try to express a_i in terms of B's. Let me consider the last element of the B array, B_n. Looking at the sample for n=3, B3 is a1. Similarly, for n=2, B2 is a2. For n=1, B1 is a1. So perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)}? Not sure. Wait, for n=3, B3 = a1. For n=2, B2 = a2. For n=1, B1 =a1. Hmm, so B_n = a_{n - (n-1)}? Not sure. Wait, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3. Yes. So B_n = a1 for n=3, B_n = a2 for n=2, B_n =a1 for n=1. Wait, no, for n=2, B2 is a2. Hmm, so B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. Hmm, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2.

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nHmm, the problem is to find the minimum possible cost of an array p where each p_i is between 1 and k. The cost is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the floor(a_i/p_i) for all i. \n\nLooking at the code provided, the approach seems to involve some sliding window or binary search. The code initializes an array of sets s, where s[x] contains the indices i where a_i//k equals x. Wait, no, actually in the code, for each a_i and possible p_i (from 1 to K), they compute a_i//k and add the index to s's corresponding set. Wait, but the loop is for k in 1..K, so for each a_i, and each possible p_i (k here is p_i?), then the floor(a_i / p_i) is stored in s. But that might be O(nk) time, which for n and k up to 3000 would be 9e6, which is manageable. \n\nBut then the code proceeds to try to find the minimal window [l, r] such that for all indices, there exists a p_i where a_i//p_i is between l and r. The idea is that if all the possible floor values can be covered within some interval [l, r], then the cost would be r - l. The minimal such r-l is the answer. \n\nWait, the code is trying to find the minimal possible maximum minus minimum. So the minimal possible difference between the max and min of the floor values. To minimize this, we need to choose p_i such that all floor(a_i/p_i) are as close as possible. \n\nThe approach here is to find the smallest possible window [L, R] such that for every a_i, there exists a p_i (<=k) where floor(a_i/p_i) is in [L, R]. The minimal R-L over all such possible windows is the answer. \n\nThe code in program1.py seems to be trying a sliding window approach. The s array is probably storing for each possible value of the floor, the indices that can reach that value. But I'm not sure how exactly the code is structured. \n\nLooking at the code's solve function:\n\nThey have s as an array of sets, where s[v] is the set of indices i where a_i//p_i equals v for some p_i. Wait, no, actually, for each a_i and each possible p_i (from 1 to K), they compute the floor value and add the index to s's corresponding set. Wait, but that would mean that for each a_i, for each possible p_i (from 1 to K), the floor(a_i/p_i) is computed, and the index is added to s's entry for that value. So s[v] is the set of all indices i for which there exists a p_i (<=k) such that a_i//p_i = v. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because for each a_i and p_i, the floor is computed, and the index is added to s's set for that floor value. So s[v] is the set of all indices i where there exists some p_i (between 1 and k) such that a_i//p_i equals v. \n\nSo, for each possible v, s[v] contains all the indices i that can have their floor(a_i/p_i) equal to v for some p_i. \n\nThe next part is trying to find the minimal window [l, r] such that for all indices i, there exists some v in [l, r] where i is in s[v]. Because that would mean that for each i, there's a p_i such that floor(a_i/p_i) is in [l, r], so the max and min would be within that window, so the cost is r-l. \n\nThe code then uses a sliding window approach where l starts at 0, and r expands until all indices are covered. Then, it tries to move l forward to find the minimal window. \n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is for l in range(len(s)), but len(s) is 3005, which is the maximum possible a_i (since a_i is up to 3000). The maximum possible floor(a_i/p_i) would be when p_i is 1, so a_i//1 = a_i. So the maximum possible value is 3000. So s is an array of size 3005, which is okay. \n\nThe code initializes ans to a very large number. Then, for each l starting from 0, it tries to find the smallest r where all indices are covered. \n\nWait, but the code's current approach is a bit confusing. Let me look at the code again. \n\nThe code has:\n\nans = a very big number.\n\nr starts at 0. \n\nThen, for each l in range(len(s)):\n\n    while the current freq (number of indices covered?) is less than N, and r < len(s):\n\n        for each v in s[r], add to freq. \n\n        r +=1 \n\n    if the freq has all N indices, then compute the current window (r - l -1?), and update ans. \n\nWait, but the code's logic here is a bit unclear. The freq is a dictionary where the keys are the indices, and the values are counts? Or maybe the freq is tracking how many times each index is covered in the current window. \n\nWait, the code's freq is a dictionary. For each l in the loop, they start with freq empty. Then, for each r starting from the current r, they add all the elements in s[r] (the indices that can have floor value r). For each v in s[r], they add to freq[v], incrementing their count. \n\nWait, but the code's loop is structured as:\n\nfor l in ...:\n\n    while len(freq) < N and r < len(s):\n\n        for v in s[r]:\n\n            if v not in freq: freq[v] =0 \n\n            freq[v] +=1 \n\n        r +=1 \n\n    if len(freq) < N: break \n\n    ans = min(ans, r - l -1 )\n\n    then, for the elements in s[l], they decrement their count in freq. \n\nWait, but the freq is tracking how many times each index is present in the current window. Wait, no, perhaps the freq is a set of indices that have at least one occurrence in the current window. Because when you add a v (index) to s[r], you are adding that index's possibility of being in the window. \n\nWait, perhaps the freq is a dictionary where the keys are the indices, and the value is the number of times they have been covered in the current window. But the condition is len(freq) < N, which would mean that not all indices are covered. \n\nWait, the code's logic is that for the current window [l, r), the s[r] is the set of indices that can have their floor value at r. So when you include all the s[r] elements, you are adding those indices to the coverage. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track for each index, whether it has at least one possible floor value in the current window [l, r]. \n\nWait, the code's approach is that the current window is [current_l, current_r], and for each index, there must be at least one value in that window such that the index is in s[v] (i.e., there exists a p_i where floor(a_i/p_i) = v in [l, r]). \n\nSo the code is trying to find the minimal window [L, R] such that for every index i, there exists some v between L and R where i is in s[v]. \n\nThe sliding window approach here is to expand the window until all indices are covered, then try to shrink the left to find the minimal window. \n\nBut the code's current implementation has some issues. Let me see:\n\nThe code starts with r=0, and for each l in the loop, it tries to expand r until all indices are covered. \n\nWait, but the code's loop for l is over all possible l (from 0 to len(s)), but the way it's structured, the r is being incremented each time, but not reset. That might not be correct. \n\nWait, the code's variables r and freq are not being reset for each l. So the first time l is 0, the code expands r until all indices are covered. Then, when l increments to 1, the code continues from the previous r, but that might not be correct. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. The sliding window should have r start from the previous position each time l increases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a sliding window where l starts at 0, and r is the current maximum. But the way it's written, the code is not properly resetting the freq and r for each l. \n\nThis might be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to use a sliding window where the window is [current_l, current_r], and for each l, we move r forward as needed. \n\nBut the code's current structure is not handling that correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a two-pointer approach where l starts at 0, and r is the current maximum. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track all the indices covered by the current window [l, r], and when moving l forward, it subtracts the elements in s[l], so that the freq counts are adjusted. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor l in range(len(s)):\n\n    while len(freq) < N and r < len(s):\n\n        for v in s[r]:\n\n            if v not in freq: freq[v] =0 \n\n            freq[v] +=1 \n\n        r +=1 \n\n    if len(freq) < N: break \n\n    ans = min(ans, r - l -1 )\n\n    for v in s[l]:\n\n        if freq[v] ==1: del freq[v]\n\n        else: freq[v] -=1 \n\nWait, but the freq is a dictionary where the keys are the indices, and the value is the count of how many times they have been added in the current window. \n\nWait, but the condition len(freq) < N means that not all indices are covered. So when the loop runs, for each l, it expands r until all indices are covered. \n\nWait, but the freq is tracking the count of each index's occurrences in the current window. But the problem requires that each index has at least one occurrence in the window. So, for each index, as long as it's present in at least one of the s[v] for v in [l, r], then it is covered. \n\nTherefore, the freq should track whether each index has been covered (i.e., has at least one occurrence in the window). \n\nBut in the code, the freq is counting the number of times each index is present in the current window. So, for example, if an index is in s[v] for multiple v's in the window, its count would be higher. \n\nBut the condition len(freq) < N is checking whether all indices are present (i.e., their count is at least 1). \n\nWait, yes. Because if an index is present in any of the s[v] in the window, then its count in freq would be at least 1, so it would be in the keys of freq. \n\nTherefore, the freq's keys are exactly the indices that are covered by the current window. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct in that sense. \n\nSo, the code is trying to find the minimal window [l, r) such that all indices are in the union of s[v] for v from l to r. \n\nThe problem is that the code's loop for l is over all possible l, and for each l, it tries to find the minimal r where the window [l, r) covers all indices. \n\nThe code's sliding window approach is correct in that way. \n\nHowever, the code's current implementation has a problem in the loop for l. Because when l increases, the code is not resetting r. Instead, r is moving forward each time. \n\nWait, the code's variables r and freq are not reset for each l. So, for example, when l is 0, the code expands r to some value. Then, when l becomes 1, the code continues from the previous r. \n\nThis is correct because once you have found that for l=0, the required r is some value, then for l=1, you can start from that r and see if you can move r further or not. \n\nWait, but the code's loop for l is in a for loop over all possible l. For each l, the code tries to expand r as needed. \n\nWait, but the code's initial r is 0. Let me see:\n\nInitially, r is 0. \n\nFirst iteration of l=0:\n\nThe while loop runs until len(freq) < N. So it adds all s[0], then s[1], etc., until all indices are covered. \n\nThen, after that, ans is updated. \n\nThen, the code subtracts the elements in s[l] (s[0]) from freq. \n\nWait, the code's loop for l is in a for loop, and for each l, after processing, it subtracts the elements in s[l] from the freq. \n\nWait, the code's code after the ans calculation is:\n\nfor v in s[l]:\n\n    if freq[v] ==1: del freq[v]\n\n    else: freq[v] -=1 \n\nThis is to remove the contribution of the current l from the window. Because when l increases by 1, the window is now [l+1, r], so the elements in s[l] are no longer part of the window. \n\nAh, right. So the code is using a sliding window approach where for each l, it first expands r as needed, then subtracts the s[l] elements from the freq. \n\nThis way, the next iteration of l (l+1) can start from the current r. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nNow, the problem is in the code's current implementation. Let me look at the code again. \n\nWait, in the code's solve function, the variables r and freq are declared inside the solve function. So for each test case, they are reinitialized. \n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\n\n    N, K = ... \n\n    A = ... \n\n    s = [set() for i in range(3005)]\n\n    for i in range(N):\n\n        for k in range(1, K+1):\n\n            v = A[i] //k \n\n            s[v].add(i)\n\n    ans = ... \n\n    r =0 \n\n    freq = {} \n\n    for l in range(len(s)):\n\n        while len(freq) < N and r < len(s):\n\n            for v in s[r]:\n\n                if v not in freq: freq[v] =0 \n\n                freq[v] +=1 \n\n            r +=1 \n\n        if len(freq) < N: break \n\n        ans = min(ans, r - l -1 )\n\n        for v in s[l]:\n\n            if freq[v] ==1: del freq[v]\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\n                freq[v] -=1 \n\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, the problem is in the line where the code says:\n\nelse: # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe current code has a comment here, but the code is incomplete. \n\nThe code is supposed to subtract 1 from freq[v], but in the current code, the else clause is missing. \n\nThe code's current line is:\n\n            if freq[v] ==1: del freq[v]\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code here is to subtract 1 from freq[v]. \n\nTherefore, the completion for program1 is to replace the TODO with:\n\nfreq[v] -=1 \n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is:\n\nelse: freq[v] -=1 \n\nNow, moving on to program2.py. \n\nThe problem here is to reconstruct array a from the given b's last column elements. \n\nThe problem statement says that the matrix b is built as follows:\n\n- b_{i,0} =0 for all i. \n\n- b_{0,i} = a_i for i >=1. \n\n- For 1<=i,j <=n, b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}. \n\nWe are given the values of b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}, and need to find any possible a array, or output -1 if impossible. \n\nThe approach here is to find a way to express a in terms of the given b values. \n\nLooking for patterns or recurrence relations. \n\nLet me think of small examples. \n\nTake the sample input given in the note: \n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\nThe a array is [1,2,3], and the last column of b is [0,2,1]. \n\nLooking at the sample, the b matrix is built as follows. \n\nThe first row (i=0) is [0,1,2,3]. \n\nThen for each i and j, the recurrence is b[i][j] = b[i][j-1] XOR b[i-1][j]. \n\nWait, the problem says that the matrix is (n+1)x(n+1). So for n=3, the matrix is 4x4. \n\nThe sample's b matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,2,3 (since b_{0,i} = a_i for i from 1 to 3). \n\nRow 1: 0, 1, 1^0=1, 2^1=3, then the last element (b_{1,3}) is 3 XOR 2 (since previous j-1 is 2, and i-1 is 0, j=3: b_{0,3}=3. So for i=1, j=3: b_{1,2} (which is 1) XOR b_{0,3} (3) \u2192 1 XOR3 = 2. \n\nWait the sample's last column for row 1 is 0? Wait the sample says the output is [0,2,1]. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to recheck the sample. \n\nThe note says that the sample a is [1,2,3], and the last column (b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n) is [0,2,1]. \n\nWait for n=3, the last column is the 4th column (since indices are 0-based). \n\nLooking at row 1, column 3 (n=3):\n\nThe value is 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the recurrence again. \n\nLet me try to compute the sample's b matrix. \n\nSample a is [1,2,3], so n=3. \n\nThe matrix is 4x4. \n\nRow 0: [0,1,2,3]\n\nRow 1: \n\nb_{1,0}=0 \n\nb_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} \u2192 0 XOR1 =1 \n\nb_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} \u21921 XOR2 =3 \n\nb_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} \u21923 XOR3 =0 \n\nSo the last element of row1 is 0. \n\nRow2:\n\nb_{2,0}=0 \n\nb_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} \u21920 XOR1 =1 \n\nb_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} \u21921 XOR3 =2 \n\nb_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} \u21922 XOR0 =2 \n\nWait but the sample says the second element (i=2) is 2, which matches. \n\nRow3:\n\nb_{3,0}=0 \n\nb_{3,1} =0 XOR b_{2,1} \u21920 XOR1 =1 \n\nb_{3,2} =1 XOR b_{2,2} \u21921 XOR2 =3 \n\nb_{3,3} =3 XOR b_{2,3} \u21923 XOR2 =1 \n\nSo the last column for rows 1,2,3 are 0,2,1, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the problem is to find a such that when building the matrix, the last column matches the given values. \n\nThe key is to find a recurrence that allows us to compute a from the given b's last column. \n\nLet me think of the recurrence for the last column. \n\nThe last column is for j =n. \n\nFor each row i from 1 to n, the value b_{i,n} is computed as b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n}. \n\nWait, but for j =n, the recurrence is:\n\nb_{i,n} = b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n} \n\nBut this is a recursive formula. \n\nLet me see for the last column. \n\nLet me denote the given values as B[i] = b_{i,n} for i from 1 to n. \n\nWe need to find a such that when building the matrix, the B array is as given. \n\nLet me see if there's a pattern or a way to express B in terms of a. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between the B array and the a array. \n\nLet me consider the last column. \n\nFor row i, the value B[i] = b_{i,n} can be expressed in terms of previous rows. \n\nLet me try to find a pattern for small n. \n\nLet me try n=1. \n\nThen, the matrix is 2x2. \n\na has one element a1. \n\nThe last column (j=1) for row 1 is B[1] = b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} \u21920 XOR a1 = a1. \n\nSo B[1] must equal a1. \n\nThus, a1 = B[1]. \n\nSo for n=1, the solution is straightforward. \n\nFor n=2: \n\nThe B array has two elements B1 and B2. \n\nLet me see how they relate to a1 and a2. \n\nThe matrix is 3x3. \n\nRow0: 0, a1, a2 \n\nRow1: 0, b11, b12, B1 = b13 (but n=2, so j=2 is the last column). \n\nWait for n=2, the last column is j=2. \n\nLet me compute B1 = b_{1,2} \n\nb_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} \n\nb_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} \u21920 XOR a1 =a1 \n\nThus, b_{1,2} = a1 XOR a2 \u2192 B1 = a1 XOR a2 \n\nB2 = b_{2,2} \n\nb_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2} \n\nb_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} \u21920 XOR a1 =a1 \n\nThus, b_{2,2} = a1 XOR (a1 XOR a2) \u2192 (a1 XOR a1) XOR a2 \u2192 0 XOR a2 \u2192 a2 \n\nSo B2 = a2 \n\nThus, for n=2, the B array is [a1 XOR a2, a2]. \n\nSo to find a1 and a2, given B1 and B2: \n\nWe have B2 = a2 \u2192 a2 = B2 \n\nThen B1 = a1 XOR B2 \u2192 a1 = B1 XOR B2 \n\nThus, the solution is a1 = B1 XOR B2, a2 = B2. \n\nHmm, interesting. \n\nFor n=3, let's see. \n\nThe B array is [B1, B2, B3]. \n\nWe need to find a1, a2, a3. \n\nLet me see the relationships. \n\nFrom the sample, when a is [1,2,3], B is [0,2,1]. \n\nLet me see how the B values are computed. \n\nB3 = a3 \n\nBecause for row3, the last element is b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} \n\nWait, let me compute step by step. \n\nRow3's last element (j=3):\n\nb_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3} \n\nBut b_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2} \n\nb_{3,1} = b_{3,0} XOR b_{2,1} \u21920 XOR (b_{2,1} which is a1) \u2192 a1 \n\nb_{2,2} is a2 (from previous step for n=2). \n\nSo b_{3,2} = a1 XOR a2 \n\nb_{2,3} is B2 (from row2's last element). \n\nThus, b_{3,3} = (a1 XOR a2) XOR B2 \n\nBut B2 is a2 (from n=2 case). \n\nWait, in the sample, B2 is 2, which is a2. \n\nSo substituting, B3 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a2 \u2192 a1. \n\nWait in the sample, B3 is 1, which is a1. \n\nYes, so B3 = a1. \n\nWait, so for n=3, B3 = a1. \n\nHmm, so for n=3, the B array is [B1, B2, B3], where B3 = a1. \n\nWait, but in the sample, B3 is 1 which is a1. \n\nSo for n=3, the last element B3 is a1. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a pattern here. \n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFor n=1: B1 = a1 \n\nn=2: B2 = a2 \n\nn=3: B3 = a1 \n\nWait, that's inconsistent. \n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that B_i = a_{n - i +1} for some i? \n\nWait in n=3, B3 is a1, which is a_{3 -3 +1} = a1. \n\nB2 is a2 (a_{3-2+1}=a2). \n\nB1 is a1 XOR a2 (which is a1 XOR a2). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed in terms of the a array in a way that allows us to compute a from B. \n\nLooking at the n=3 case:\n\nWe have:\n\nB1 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3 \n\nWait no, in the sample, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3. \n\nB1 is 0, which is 1 XOR2 XOR3? 1+2+3=6, but XOR is 1^2=3, 3^3=0. \n\nYes, so B1 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3 \u2192 (1^2)=3, then 3^3=0. \n\nWait, but how does that fit into the pattern? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed as the cumulative XOR of certain elements. \n\nAlternatively, let's think recursively. \n\nLet me see for general n. \n\nSuppose we have the B array for n elements. \n\nLet me see for each B_i (the i-th element in the given array, which is b_{i,n}).\n\nWe can try to find a recurrence for B_i in terms of a and previous B's. \n\nLet me think of the last column. \n\nThe value B_i = b_{i,n} can be expressed as follows:\n\nLooking at the recurrence for b_{i,n}:\n\nb_{i,n} = b_{i, n-1} XOR b_{i-1, n} \n\nBut b_{i-1,n} is B_{i-1} (since it's the (i-1)th row's last element). \n\nSo B_i = b_{i,n-1} XOR B_{i-1} \n\nBut what is b_{i,n-1}? \n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a way to express b_{i,n-1} in terms of a and previous B's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where B_i is the XOR of a certain subset of the a array. \n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFor n=1: B1 = a1 \n\nn=2: B1 = a1 XOR a2, B2 = a2 \n\nn=3: B1 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3, B2 = a2 XOR a3, B3 = a1 \n\nWait, in the sample for n=3, B2 is 2, which is a2. But according to this, B2 would be a2 XOR a3 (2 XOR3=1), which doesn't match. \n\nHmm, perhaps my previous assumption is wrong. \n\nWait in the sample for n=3, B2 is 2. \n\nLooking back, for row2's last element (B2):\n\nb_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} \n\nb_{2,2} is a2 (from n=2 case), and b_{1,3} is B1 (0). \n\nSo 2 XOR0 =2 \u2192 which matches. \n\nSo B2 = a2 XOR B1. \n\nWait, B1 is 0, so a2 XOR0 = a2 \u2192 yes. \n\nHmm, so B2 = a2 XOR B1. \n\nSimilarly, B1 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3. \n\nWait, but how to express this in terms of a and B's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed as follows:\n\nLet me think of the B array as B[1], B[2], ..., B[n]. \n\nWe can try to find a recurrence for B[i] in terms of a and previous B's. \n\nLet me see for n=3:\n\nB3 = a1 \n\nB2 = a2 XOR B1 \n\nB1 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3 \n\nHmm, but how to get a1 from B3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the B array can be expressed as the cumulative XOR of a's in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array can be derived by reversing the B array and applying some operations. \n\nLooking at the sample for n=3:\n\nB array is [0,2,1]. \n\nThe a array is [1,2,3]. \n\nIf we reverse the B array, we get [1,2,0]. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array can be computed as follows:\n\na_i = B_{n} XOR B_{n-1} XOR ... XOR B_{n -i +1} \n\nWait, let's see for the sample:\n\nFor a1 =1, which is B3 (1). \n\na2 =2 \u2192 B3 XOR B2 \u2192 1 XOR2 =3 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a_i = B_{i} XOR B_{i-1} ... \n\nWait for n=3:\n\na3 = B1 XOR B2 XOR B3? \n\n0 XOR2 XOR1 =3 \u2192 yes. \n\na2 = B2 XOR B3 \u2192 2 XOR1 =3 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the B array as a binary representation and see if there's a pattern. \n\nAnother approach: Let's try to find a recurrence for a_i in terms of the B array. \n\nSuppose we have the B array for n elements. \n\nWe can try to express a_i in terms of B's. \n\nLet me consider the last element of the B array, B_n. \n\nLooking at the sample for n=3, B3 is a1. \n\nSimilarly, for n=2, B2 is a2. \n\nFor n=1, B1 is a1. \n\nSo perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)}? Not sure. \n\nWait, for n=3, B3 = a1. \n\nFor n=2, B2 = a2. \n\nFor n=1, B1 =a1. \n\nHmm, so B_n = a_{n - (n-1)}? Not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3. \n\nYes. \n\nSo B_n = a1 for n=3, B_n = a2 for n=2, B_n =a1 for n=1. \n\nWait, no, for n=2, B2 is a2. \n\nHmm, so B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nHmm, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nWait, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nHmm, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nHmm, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nHmm, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nHmm, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nHmm, perhaps B_n = a_{n - (n-1)} \u2192 a1 for n=3, but for n=2, it's a2. \n\nHmm,
