  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to decode a string t back to the original s. The encoding process works by converting each character in s to its position in the alphabet. If the position is a single digit (like 1-9), it's written as is. If it's two digits (10-26), then it's written followed by a 0. So for example, 'c' (3) becomes '3', 'o' (15) becomes '150', etc. The task is to reverse this process given the encoded string t.\n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, there's a loop that processes the string s (which is the input t reversed). The code uses a deque to build the original numbers. The current code has a condition where if the current character is '0', it appends the next two characters (reversed again?), but the else part is missing.\n\nWait, let me think. The code starts by reversing the input string s. So for example, if the input t is '315045', then s here would be '540513' (since it's reversed). The code processes this reversed string from the start. \n\nThe loop is at:\n\nwhile i < n:\n    if s[i] == \"0\":\n        d.appendleft(int(s[i + 1:i + 3][::-1]))\n        i += 3\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nHmm. Let's see. The current approach is to process the reversed string. Let's think through an example. Let's take the first test case's example where t is '315045', which reversed becomes '540513'.\n\nProcessing this reversed string:\n\nInitially, i is 0. The first character is '5', which is not 0. So the else clause is hit. The code here needs to capture the digits that form a single-digit number. Since the original encoding for single digits is just the number, but when reversed, perhaps we need to take one digit here. Wait, but how do we know when to stop?\n\nWait, maybe the approach here is to process the reversed string from the end, but the code is processing from the start. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to parse the reversed string by looking for the '0's that come after two-digit numbers. Because in the encoding, two-digit numbers are followed by a 0. So in the original encoding, a two-digit number like 15 becomes '150', so in the reversed string, that part would be '051' (since the entire string is reversed). So when processing the reversed string, whenever we see a '0', that might indicate that the previous two digits (in the reversed string) form part of a two-digit number. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to parse the reversed string by looking for the '0's that are part of the two-digit numbers. Let me think of the example where the code is '315045' (original example). The reversed string is '540513'. Let's walk through the code's steps:\n\nInitially, i=0. The first character is '5', not 0. So the else clause is hit. The code here needs to process this as a single-digit number. So perhaps in the else case, we take the current digit as a single-digit number, add it to the deque, and increment i by 1. But how do we know when to take two digits?\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to process the reversed string in reverse order. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to process the reversed string from the start, but the logic is a bit tricky. Let me think of the example again.\n\nWait, the code is processing the reversed string. Let's take the example where the original code is '315045', which is the encoded string. The reversed string is '540513'. Let's see how the code would process this:\n\nThe loop starts at i=0. The first character is '5', so else clause. The code here needs to capture the single-digit numbers. Since the original encoding for single digits are just their digits, but in the reversed string, they would be individual digits. So perhaps in the else case, we take the current digit as a single-digit number, add it to the deque, and move i by 1. But then, when we hit a '0', that's part of a two-digit number. Wait, but in the example, after the first '5', the next characters are '4', '0', etc. Let's see:\n\nWait, let's think of the example where the code is '315045' (original example). The reversed string is '540513'. Let's process each step:\n\ni starts at 0. The first character is '5', so else clause. The code here should take this as a single-digit (5), so append 5 to the deque. Then i becomes 1.\n\nNext, i=1: the character is '4', so again else clause. Append 4, i becomes 2.\n\nAt i=2, the character is '0'. So enter the if clause. Then, the code takes s[i+1:i+3], which is from index 3 to 4 (since i is 2, so i+1 is 3, up to but not including 5?), so s[3] is '0' (wait, let me check the reversed string again. Wait the original code is 315045, reversed is '540513'? Let me see:\n\nOriginal t is '315045', which is the encoded string. Let's write it as characters: '3','1','5','0','4','5'. Reversed, it's '5','4','0','5','1','3'. So the reversed string s is '540513'.\n\nSo when i is 2 (third character), s[i] is '0'. Then the code takes s[i+1 : i+3], which is from index 3 to 5 (exclusive?), so indices 3 and 4. The substring from 3 to 5 (exclusive) is s[3] and s[4], which are '5' and '1'. So the substring is '51', then reversed again (since [::-1] is applied). So '51'[::-1] is '15', so the number is 15. So that's correct because the original two-digit number was 15 (for 'o'), which in the encoded string is '150', so in the reversed string, the '0' comes after the '5' and '1'? Wait, the original '150' becomes '051' in the reversed part. So when processing the '0' at position 2, the next two characters (indices 3 and 4) are '5' and '1', so the substring s[3:5] is '51', reversed gives '15', so the number is 15. Then i increases by 3 (so i becomes 5). \n\nContinuing, at i=5, the character is '3', so else clause. Append 3, i becomes 6, loop ends. \n\nThe deque would have the numbers 5,4,15,3. Wait, but when we appendleft, the order would be reversed. Wait, the deque is being built in reverse order? Let me see:\n\nWait, the code appends to the left. Let's see the steps:\n\nFirst, when i=0 (5), else clause: the code would append 5 to the deque. So deque is [5].\n\nThen i=1 (4), else clause: append 4 to the left? Wait, no, the code in the else part is missing. The current code has the else part as a TODO. So the code in the else part needs to handle the single-digit case.\n\nAh right, the code in the else clause is missing. So the problem is to fill in the else part. \n\nThe else clause is for when the current character is not '0', so it's part of a single-digit number. So in that case, we can take the current digit as the number, add it to the deque, and move i by 1. \n\nSo the code for the else part would be something like:\n\nd.appendleft(int(s[i]))\ni +=1\n\nWait, but the digits are in the reversed string. Wait, the original code is built by appending the numbers in order. For example, the 'o' (15) is encoded as '150', so in the reversed string, the '0' comes first? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the original encoded string is built by appending each character's code. For example, 'c' (3) is '3', 'o' (15) is '150', 'd' (4) is '4', 'e' (5) is '5'. So the entire code is '3' + '150' + '4' + '5' = '315045'. The reversed string is '540513'.\n\nThe code processes the reversed string from the start. The first digits are '5', '4', '0', etc. \n\nIn the else clause (when current character is not '0'), the code should take the current digit as a single-digit number. So for example, the first '5' is part of the 'e' (5), so the code appends 5 to the deque. Then the next '4' is part of the 'd' (4), so append 4. Then comes the '0', which triggers the if clause, which processes the next two digits (5 and 1) to form 15 (the 'o'). \n\nSo the else clause's code is indeed to append the current digit as a single-digit number, then increment i by 1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the else block is:\n\nd.appendleft(int(s[i]))\ni += 1\n\nSo that's the code for program1.py's missing part.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of seconds to infect all nodes in a rooted tree (root is 1). Each second, two steps: spreading and injection. \n\nThe spreading step allows infecting at most one child of each infected parent (but only if the child was previously infected in a previous step?), or maybe the spreading is that for each infected parent, you can spread to one child that's already a child but not yet infected? Wait, the problem says: during spreading, for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe spreading operation: for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice. \n\nWait, so during spreading, for each v, if any of its children are already infected (from previous steps?), then you can choose to infect one more child of v. But how does that work? The spreading happens each second. So during the spreading phase, for each v, if any of its children are already infected (from the previous steps, including the injection from the previous second?), then you can choose to infect one more child of v. \n\nThe injection phase allows you to choose any healthy vertex to infect. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of seconds to infect all nodes. \n\nThe approach here is to model the problem in terms of the depth of the nodes and the required steps. \n\nThe given code for program2.py seems to be trying to compute some kind of levels. Let me look at the code:\n\nThe code reads the input, for each test case, the code is in the solve function. The code uses a defaultdict counter. For each a in the input (the p_i's?), it increments the count for the parent. Then, the counts are stored in a list, sorted, and modified. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of children at each level. But I'm not sure. Let me think through the code step by step.\n\nThe code for program2.py:\n\nThe code starts with a defaultdict counter. The solve function takes 'a' as an input, which is the list of parents for nodes 2 to n. \n\nWait, the code says for a in [*open(0)][2::2], which suggests that the input is read in lines, and every second line (starting from the second line) is the parents. \n\nWait, the code for program2 is probably incorrect, and the user needs to fill in the missing part. \n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal number of seconds. The approach might involve determining the maximum depth of the tree and some other factors. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled by considering that each node can be infected either via injection or via spreading. The key is to determine the minimal time by considering the layers of the tree. \n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe infection process can be thought of in terms of layers. The root (1) must be infected first. Since initially all are healthy, the first second must involve injecting the root. Wait, no. Wait, the first second's injection can be any node. But the root is the only node with no parent except itself. \n\nWait, the process starts with all nodes healthy. Each second, first spreading, then injection. \n\nWait, the first second: \n\n- Spreading: since no nodes are infected yet, nothing happens. \n\n- Then, injection: choose any node to infect. Let's say we choose the root (1). \n\nThen, in the next seconds, the spreading can start. \n\nThe minimal time is determined by the structure of the tree. \n\nThe key idea is that each node can be infected either by being injected, or by spreading from its parent. \n\nThe spreading can only infect one child per parent per second. So, for a node at depth d, the earliest it can be infected is d seconds (if the path is a straight line). But with the injection steps, you can speed this up. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to the problem where you need to cover the tree with the minimal number of steps, considering that each step you can choose to inject a node, and also spread from existing nodes. \n\nThe minimal time is determined by the maximum number of children at any level in the tree's hierarchy. \n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to compute the maximum number of children at any node's level, and then the answer is the ceiling of (max_children + 1)/2 or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled by considering the levels of the tree. Let me think of the example given in the note. \n\nThe first test case's image shows that the minimal time is 3 seconds. The tree structure is probably a chain. \n\nAlternatively, the solution requires finding the maximum number of nodes at any depth, and then the answer is the ceiling of (max_depth + 1)/2 or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering that each node can be infected either by injection or via spreading. The spreading can only infect one child per parent per second. \n\nThe minimal time is determined by the maximum number of children in any node's subtree. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each node the number of children it has. Then, the required time is the maximum between the depth of the tree and the ceiling of (max_children + 1)/2). \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires considering the maximum number of children in any node's subtree. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nEach node except the root has a parent. The infection process can be thought of as layers. The root must be infected first. \n\nThe key is to find the minimal number of seconds by choosing which nodes to inject and when. \n\nThe minimal time is determined by the maximum number of children in any node's subtree. \n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to compute the maximum number of children any node has. Let's call this 'max_children'. Then the minimal time is the ceiling of (max_children) / 1, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to the problem where each node can have multiple children, and the spreading can only handle one child per parent per second. So, for a node with k children, you need at least ceil(k / 1) seconds? No, perhaps the number of children determines how many injections are needed. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal time is the maximum between the depth of the tree and the maximum number of children in any node. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe minimal time required is the maximum between the depth of the tree and the ceiling of (the maximum number of children of any node) divided by 1, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires considering that for each node, the number of children it has determines how many steps are needed to spread to all of them. Since each second, you can spread to one child. So for a node with m children, you need m steps to spread to all of them via spreading. But you can also inject some of them to reduce the time. \n\nWait, the spreading can only spread to one child per parent per second. So for a node with m children, you need at least m seconds to spread all of them via spreading. But if you inject some of them, you can reduce the required time. \n\nThe minimal time would be the maximum over all nodes of the number of children they have. Because for a node with m children, you can choose to inject some of them, but the spreading can only handle one per second. So the minimal time required for that node's children is m, but if you inject some, then the required time is ceil(m / 1) but perhaps the maximum over all nodes' children counts. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal time is the maximum between the depth of the tree and the maximum number of children any node has. \n\nWait, let's look at the sample input. \n\nThe first test case's note says the answer is 3. The image probably shows a tree where the root has two children, and one of them has two children. The maximum number of children any node has is 2 (the root has two children, and one child has two children). The depth is 3 (root is level 1, its child is level 2, and the grandchild is level 3). The maximum between 2 and 3 would be 3, which matches the sample's answer. \n\nAnother example: if a node has 5 children, then the minimal time would be 5, since each second you can spread one, so you need 5 seconds unless you inject some. But if you inject one of them, then you can spread the remaining 4, but that would take 4 more seconds. So total 5. \n\nThus, the minimal time is the maximum between the depth of the tree and the maximum number of children any node has. \n\nWait, but the depth is the number of levels. For example, a root with a chain of nodes (each node has one child), the depth is n, but the maximum children per node is 1. So the minimal time would be the depth. \n\nSo the minimal time is the maximum between the depth and the maximum number of children in any node. \n\nTherefore, the approach is to compute for each test case:\n\n- The depth of the tree (the maximum distance from root to any node).\n\n- The maximum number of children any node has.\n\nThe answer is the maximum of these two values. \n\nWait, but let's see the first sample. Suppose the tree has depth 3 and max children 2. The maximum is 3, which matches the sample's answer of 3. \n\nAnother example: if a node has 5 children, then the maximum between 5 and the depth (assuming depth is 2) would be 5, which would be the answer. \n\nSo the code needs to compute these two values and return the maximum. \n\nNow, looking at the given code for program2.py, the code is incomplete. Let's see what it's doing. \n\nThe code for solve(a) is:\n\ndef solve(a):\n    for ai in a:\n        counter[ai] += 1\n    count = list(counter.values())\n    num_level = len(count)\n    count.sort()\n\n    for i in range(num_level):\n        count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n    \n    L = 0; R = max(count)\n\n    if R == 0:\n        return num_level + 1\n\n    def check(k):\n        b = count.copy()\n        for i in range(len(b)):\n            b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n        if sum(b) <= k:\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    while R - L > 1:\n        mid = (R + L) // 2\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    return num_level + 1 + R\n\nHmm, this code is trying to compute something with binary search. The variables L and R are set to 0 and max(count). The check function is trying to see if a certain k is sufficient. \n\nThe code's approach is unclear to me. Perhaps the code is trying to model the problem in terms of the maximum number of children per level. \n\nAlternatively, the code may have a different approach. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal time T such that all nodes can be infected within T seconds. \n\nEach second, during the spreading phase, for each node v, if any of its children are already infected (from previous steps), you can choose to infect one more child of v. \n\nThe injection phase allows you to choose any healthy node to infect. \n\nThe key is to model how the infection spreads. \n\nThe minimal time T must satisfy that for each node, the time it is infected is at most T. \n\nThe root must be infected by injection in the first second (since initially nothing is infected). \n\nSuppose the root is infected at time 0 (the first injection). \n\nThen, for its children, they can be infected either by injection or via spreading. \n\nThe spreading can only infect one child per parent per second. \n\nThe problem is similar to scheduling the infection such that for each node, the time it is infected is at most T. \n\nThe approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nEach node has a depth d (distance from root). The earliest time a node can be infected is d, but this can be reduced by injections. \n\nAlternatively, the time required is determined by the maximum between the depth of the tree and the ceiling of (the maximum number of children of any node) divided by 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum between the depth and the maximum number of children of any node. \n\nBut how to compute depth and max_children. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py is trying to compute something else. Let me see:\n\nThe code reads the parents of nodes 2 to n. For each parent, it counts how many children each node has. \n\nWait, the code uses a defaultdict counter. For each ai in a (the list of parents for nodes 2 to n), the counter[ai] is incremented. So, for each node, the count is the number of children it has. \n\nSo, count is a list of the number of children each node has. \n\nThen, the code sorts count, and then for each i in 0..num_level-1, it does count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0). \n\nHmm, not sure what this is doing. \n\nThen, the binary search is between L=0 and R = max(count). \n\nThe check function takes a k and checks if the sum of (count[i] -k) if positive, summed over all i, is <=k. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe required time is the maximum between the depth and the ceiling of (max_children +1)/2. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the minimal T such that for each level, the number of children can be handled within T steps. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to model the problem as a scheduling problem where each node's children require some time. \n\nThe code's binary search is trying to find the minimal R such that the required conditions are met. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that for each node with m children, the time needed is ceil(m/1) because each second you can spread one child. But if you can inject some, then the required time is the maximum between the depth and the maximum number of children. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to compute the maximum between the depth of the tree and the maximum number of children any node has. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to compute these two values. \n\nSo, to implement this, for each test case:\n\n1. Compute the depth of the tree. \n\n2. Compute the maximum number of children any node has. \n\nThe answer is the maximum of these two. \n\nNow, how to compute these in code. \n\nFirst, for the maximum number of children: \n\nWe can count for each node how many children it has. The maximum of these counts is the max_children. \n\nFor the depth: \n\nWe can perform a BFS or DFS to compute the maximum distance from the root (node 1). \n\nSo, the steps for each test case are:\n\nRead n, then the list of parents p_2 ... p_n. \n\nBuild the tree structure. \n\nCompute the depth of each node, then find the maximum depth. \n\nCompute the number of children for each node, then find the maximum. \n\nThe answer is the maximum between the two. \n\nNow, looking at the given code for program2.py, it's not doing this. The code is using a different approach, perhaps incorrect. \n\nThe code's solve function is given a list a (the parents of nodes 2 to n). \n\nThe code counts the number of children each node has (since for each parent in a, the count[ai] +=1). \n\nThen, the count list is sorted. \n\nThen, for each i in 0 to len(count)-1, count[i] = max(count[i] - i -2, 0). \n\nThis part is unclear. \n\nThen, the binary search is between 0 and max(count). \n\nThe check function is trying to see if a certain k can handle the sum. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to model the problem in terms of the levels. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required time as the maximum between the depth and the ceiling of (max_children +1)/2. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe required time is the maximum between the depth and the ceiling of (max_children) / 1. \n\nBut the code's current approach is not doing that. \n\nGiven that the code is incomplete, the user needs to fill in the missing part. \n\nLooking at the code's binary search loop:\n\nwhile R - L >1:\n\n    mid = (R+L)//2\n\n    if check(mid):\n\n        R = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else clause is missing. The code should set L = mid +1? \n\nYes, in a binary search, when the condition is not met, you need to move the lower bound up. \n\nSo the missing code in the else clause is:\n\nL = mid\n\nWait, no. Let me think. \n\nThe binary search is looking for the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nThe loop is structured as:\n\nwhile R - L >1:\n\n    mid = (R+L)//2\n\n    if check(mid):\n\n        R = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        L = mid \n\nWait, no. The standard binary search for minimal R would set L = mid +1 if the condition is not met. \n\nWait, the code's variables are L and R, with R being the upper bound. \n\nSuppose the check function returns True when k is sufficient. \n\nWe are trying to find the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nInitially, L is 0, R is the maximum possible. \n\nIf check(mid) is true, then we can try to find a smaller R, so set R = mid. \n\nIf not, then we need to increase L to mid +1. \n\nWait, the code's current code in the else clause (when check(mid) is false) should set L = mid. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the correct answer is 5. \n\nSuppose L is 0, R is 10. \n\nmid is 5. \n\nIf check(5) is false, then we need to set L to mid +1 (6). \n\nWait, the code's current code in the else clause (when check is false) should set L = mid +1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nL = mid \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe code's current code in the else clause (when check(mid) is false) should set L = mid +1. \n\nBecause if the current mid is not sufficient (check returns false), then the minimal R must be larger than mid. So the new L should be mid +1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nL = mid \n\nWait, no. Let me think of the standard binary search structure. \n\nSuppose we are searching for the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nInitialize L = 0, R = max_val. \n\nWhile L < R:\n\n    mid = (L + R) //2 \n\n    if check(mid):\n\n        R = mid \n\n    else:\n\n        L = mid +1 \n\nAt the end, L == R is the minimal value. \n\nIn the given code's loop, the condition is while R-L>1. \n\nSo when R-L is 1, the loop stops. \n\nSuppose the loop is:\n\nwhile R - L >1:\n\n    mid = (R+L)//2 \n\n    if check(mid):\n\n        R = mid \n\n    else:\n\n        L = mid \n\nWait, but that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is structured to find the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nSuppose the code's current code in the else clause is missing the L = mid +1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nL = mid \n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose L=0, R=5. \n\nmid is 2. \n\nIf check(2) is false, then the minimal R must be >2. So set L to 3. \n\nThus, the code should set L = mid +1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nL = mid +1 \n\nSo the code in the else clause is L = mid +1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is to set L = mid +1 in the else clause of the binary search loop. \n\nSo the code for the missing part is:\n\nL = mid + 1\n\nThus, the two missing parts are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nIn the else clause:\n\nd.appendleft(int(s[i]))\ni +=1\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nIn the else clause of the binary search loop:\n\nL = mid +1 \n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"d.appendleft(int(s[i]))\\n        i +=1\",\n  \"program2\": \"L = mid + 1\"\n}"
