The problem says:\n\nYou can do operations of two types:\n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy of the chosen array. 2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. You need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal. Each operation is either a clone or a swap. So each swap is an operation. But in the example's note, the answer is 6. Let's see:\n\nThe example's steps:\n\n- First clone (1 operation).\n\n- Then swap elements (how many swaps? Let's see, the first array has two copies. To get all zeros in one array, they need to move the non-zero elements from the first array to the second. The first array after cloning has two copies. The original array has two zeros.

Thus, the minimal k_3 is ceil(b_2 /a_3). Wait, because 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceil gives 2. Thus, the minimal k_3 is ceil(b_2 /a_3). Thus, the formula is k_i = ceil( (b_{i-1}) / a_i ) +1? No, it's ceil( (b_{i-1}) / a_i ) gives the minimal integer k_i such that k_i *a_i >= b_{i-1} +1. Wait, let me see:\n\nWe need k_i *a_i > b_{i-1} => k_i > b_{i-1}/a_i \n\nThe smallest integer k_i is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. Which is equal to ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). Alternatively, ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ) may be sufficient. Wait, let me see:\n\nIf b_{i-1} is exactly divisible by a_i, then ceil(b_{i-1}/a_i) = b_{i-1}/a_i. Then k_i must be greater than that, so the minimal k_i is (b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. Thus, the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1? No, because if b_{i-1} is not divisible by a_i, then ceil(b_{i-1}/a_i) is already the minimal integer greater than b_{i-1}/a_i. Thus, the minimal k_i is ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ). Wait, let me test with b_{i-1}=5, a_i=3. ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 which is correct. If b_{i-1}=6, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(6/3)=2 \u2192 but 2*3=6 is not greater than 6. So need 3. Ah, right. Thus, when b_{i-1} is divisible by a_i, then the minimal k_i is (b_{i-1}/a_i)+1.

But if b_{i-1} mod a_i ==0 \u2192 then ceil(b_{i-1}/a_i) = b_{i-1}/a_i \u2192 but then k_i must be larger than that, so k_i = (b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. Thus, the minimal k_i is ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ) if there is a remainder, else ceil(...) +1. Alternatively, the minimal k_i is floor( b_{i-1}/a_i ) +1. Yes, because:\n\nIf b_{i-1} = q*a_i + r, where 0<=r <a_i. Then floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) = q. Thus, q+1 is the minimal k_i. Thus, the formula is k_i = floor( b_{i-1}/a_i ) +1.

At each step i, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, and the corresponding k_i is chosen to minimize the sum. But how to compute this efficiently. Let me think of the following approach inspired by the code given in program2.py. The code given for program2.py has a loop over t1 from 0 to m-1 (where m is n). Inside, there's a loop over t2 =t1, then another loop. The code seems to be trying all possible starting points and calculating the required moves. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimal moves by ensuring that each b_i is at least the previous b_{i-1} plus 1. Wait, the sequence must be strictly increasing, so b_i must be at least b_{i-1}+1. Thus, the minimal possible b_i is b_{i-1}+1. But b_i must be a multiple of a_i. Thus, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. This is the same as the greedy approach. The corresponding k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1}+1)/a_i ). The sum of the absolute values of these k_i's is the minimal possible. Thus, this approach would give the minimal sum. But in the previous example where a = [5,1,1], this approach would give:\n\nb_1 =0 \u2192 k_1=0. \n\nb_2 must be >0 \u2192 minimal is 1 \u2192 k_2=1 \u2192 sum 1. b_3 must be >1 \u2192 minimal is 2 \u2192 k_3=2 \u2192 sum 3. Total 3. But the alternative approach of choosing k_1 =-1 gives a total of 2. Thus, this approach is not optimal. Thus, the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i is not optimal. This suggests that the problem requires a different approach.",

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make one of the array copies have all elements equal. The operations allowed are cloning an array and swapping elements between any copies. \n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out for each possible target value (the value all elements should become), what's the minimal operations required. Then choose the minimum among all those.\n\nFirst, for each possible target value in the array, we need to calculate how many elements are already present. Because each clone adds more elements, but swaps can move elements around. Wait, but swaps can exchange elements between any copies. So the idea is that the total number of a certain value in all copies must be at least the size of the array (since we need one array of that size with all elements equal). \n\nWait, the target array must be of length n. So for a target value x, the total count of x in the original array is c. To form one array of n elements all x, we need at least n copies of x. But each clone increases the total count. Wait, no. Wait, each clone creates a new copy of the current array. So the total number of copies after k clones is (k+1) (since starting with 1). But each element in the original array is present in each copy. So the total count of x across all copies is (number of copies) * (original count of x). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem requires that after some operations, there exists at least one copy (array) where all elements are equal to some value. The operations are cloning and swapping elements between any copies. \n\nThe minimal steps would involve:\n\n1. Choose a target value x which has the maximum frequency in the original array. Because that would require fewer swaps and clones.\n\nWait, but how do the operations work? Let's see:\n\nEach clone increases the number of arrays by 1. Each swap can exchange any two elements in any arrays. So the swaps can move elements between arrays, but the total count of each element across all arrays is fixed (since each clone just duplicates the current arrays). \n\nWait, actually, when you clone an array, you get another copy of it. So the total count of each element in all arrays is multiplied by the number of copies. For example, if the original array has a count of c for x, then after k clones (so total copies is k+1), the total x's across all arrays is (k+1)*c. \n\nTo have at least one array of n elements all x, we need that (k+1)*c >= n. Because that array must have n elements, all x. So the minimal k needed for a given x is ceil(n/(c)) -1. Because (k+1) must be at least ceil(n/c). So k is ceil(n/c) -1. \n\nWait, but that's the number of clones needed. But each clone is an operation. However, the swaps are needed to arrange the elements. But the problem counts the number of operations as the total number of clone and swap operations. Wait, no, the problem says the output is the minimal number of operations (clones and swaps) needed. Wait, the problem says \"find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal\". \n\nWait, the problem's operations are two types:\n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. This adds a new copy. Each clone is one operation.\n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe same copy) on any positions. Each swap is one operation?\n\nWait, the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. You need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\"\n\nWait, but the problem's description of operations is a bit ambiguous. Are the swaps counted as individual operations, or is a swap considered a single operation regardless of how many elements are swapped? Because the problem says \"swap two elements\" as one operation. So each swap is one operation. \n\nBut this complicates things because the number of swaps needed could be large. However, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the minimal number of operations needed to create at least one copy where all elements are equal.\" The operations are cloning and swapping. So each clone is one operation, each swap is one operation. \n\nHmm, but how do we minimize the total operations? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps can be done in a way that requires minimal steps. Wait, but maybe the swaps can be done in bulk. For example, after cloning enough times, you can arrange the elements with some swaps. But the problem counts each swap as an operation, so that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps are not counted as individual operations. Wait, the problem's note in the first example says that in the second test case, the answer is 6 operations. Let me look at the note:\n\nIn the second test case, after cloning, they do some swaps, then another clone, and some swaps again. The total operations are 6. Let me see:\n\nThe note says:\n\nThey first clone the array (operation 1?), then swap elements (how many swaps?), then clone again (operation 2?), but the total is 6. Wait the note says the total is 6 operations. The example's explanation might have steps like:\n\n- Clone (1 operation)\n\n- Then some swaps (each swap is an operation?), but that would add a lot. So perhaps the swaps are not counted as individual operations. Wait, maybe the problem counts the swap operations as a single operation for all swaps done in some way. That can't be. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the second example, the answer is 6. Let me read the note again:\n\nIn the second test case, the steps are:\n\n1. Create a copy (clone) \u2192 1 operation.\n\n2. Then swap elements so that all zeros are in one array. How many swaps? The example says after that, they have two arrays. The first array has three zeros and the second has some others. Then they clone again (second clone, total 2 operations?), then swap again. The final total is 6 operations. \n\nHmm, perhaps the swaps are not counted as individual operations. Maybe the problem counts the swap operations as a single operation for all swaps needed. Or perhaps the problem counts the swaps as not contributing to the operation count. \n\nWait the problem's description says \"you can do operations of two types: choose any array and clone it (operation 1), or swap two elements from any two copies (operation 2). So each swap is an operation. \n\nWait that can't be, because in the example, the answer is 6. Let me see the example's explanation:\n\nThe example's steps:\n\n- First clone (1 operation).\n\n- Then swap elements in a way so all zeros are in one array. How many swaps? Let's see the original array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. After cloning, there are two copies. To get all zeros into one array, perhaps they need to swap the 1 and 3 and 7 with the other array's elements. But each swap is an operation. But the example's total is 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem counts the swaps as not contributing to the operation count. Because otherwise, the number of swaps could be very large. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps can be done in a way that the number of swaps needed is (number of elements not equal to the target in the desired array). Because each swap can fix two elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. But that would be hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps can be done in a way that the number of swaps is not part of the operation count. Wait, the problem's note says that in the first test case, all elements are already equal, so the answer is 0. So no clones or swaps needed. \n\nIn the second example, the answer is 6. Let me see the steps:\n\nThe example's explanation says:\n\nThey first clone (1 operation). Then after swapping, they have two arrays. Then they clone again (second clone, so 2 operations so far). Then they swap again. The total is 6. \n\nWait the example's explanation says that the total is 6 operations. The steps mentioned are:\n\n- Clone (1 operation).\n\n- Then swap elements (how many swaps? Let's see, the first array after cloning has two copies. To get all zeros in one array, perhaps they need to swap the 1 and 3 and 7 with the other array's elements. Each swap is an operation. But the example's total is 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem counts the swaps as not contributing to the operation count. Because otherwise, the example's explanation would have a lot more steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the swap operations as a single operation for all swaps done in a step. Or perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. \n\nWait the problem's description says \"the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal\". The two types of operations are cloning and swapping. So each swap is an operation. \n\nBut in the example, the answer is 6. Let me see the example's steps again:\n\nThe example's explanation says:\n\nAfter cloning, they have two copies. Then they swap elements so that all zeros are in one array. Then they clone again (so that's two clones so far?), and then swap again. The total is 6 operations. \n\nWait the example's explanation says that the total is 6. Let me see the steps:\n\nThe first clone is 1 operation. Then, after that, they do some swaps. Let's say they need to move the 1 and 3 and 7 from the first array to the second. Each swap would take one operation. But how many swaps are needed? \n\nSuppose the first array has elements [0,1,3,3,7,0], and the second is the same. To get all zeros in the first array, they need to swap the 1 with a 0 from the second array, the 3s with 0s, etc. \n\nEach element that is not a zero in the first array must be swapped with a zero from another array. The number of non-zero elements in the first array is 4 (the 1, 3,3,7). So each of these needs to be swapped with a zero from another array. Each swap can handle two elements. So for 4 elements, that would be 2 swaps. \n\nThen, after that, the first array has all zeros except maybe some? Wait the example's first array after swaps is [0,0,0,3,7,0]. Wait, that's not all zeros. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. Because the problem's note says that the total is 6, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nWait the example's explanation says that the total is 6 operations. Let me count the steps in the example's explanation:\n\nThey first clone (1 operation). \n\nThen they swap elements so that all zeros are in one array. Let's say that takes some swaps. \n\nThen they create a copy of the first array (second clone, so 2 operations so far). \n\nThen they swap elements again to get all zeros in the first array. \n\nThe total steps mentioned in the example's explanation are:\n\n- Clone (1)\n\n- Swap elements (some steps)\n\n- Clone again (2)\n\n- Swap again (some steps)\n\nThe total is 6. So perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the swap operations as a single operation for all swaps done in a step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's note says that the answer is 6, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nWait the problem's note says that the answer is 6. Let me see the example's steps:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\n1. Clone the array (1 operation).\n\n2. After that, there are two copies. They perform swaps to arrange the elements so that the first array has all zeros except some, but the second array has the other elements. \n\n3. Then they clone the first array again (second clone, so 2 operations so far).\n\n4. Then they perform swaps again to make the first array all zeros. \n\nThe total operations would be 2 clones plus the swaps. But the total is 6. So perhaps each swap is an operation, but the number of swaps needed is 4, plus the two clones gives 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of swaps needed is (number of non-target elements in the desired array). Because each swap can fix two elements. \n\nWait, let's think differently. The minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps can be done in a way that the number of swaps is not part of the operation count. Because the problem's note says that the answer is 6, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's note says that the answer is 6, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the second test case, the answer is 6. The steps mentioned in the note are:\n\n- Clone (1 operation).\n\n- Then swap elements so that all zeros are in one array. \n\n- Then clone again (2 operations so far).\n\n- Then swap again to get all zeros in the first array. \n\nThe total is 6. So perhaps each swap is an operation. \n\nWait, but how many swaps are there? Let's see:\n\nThe first array after cloning has two copies. The first array has 2 zeros (original array has two zeros). The second array also has two zeros. To get all zeros in one array, you need to move the other zeros from the second array into the first. \n\nWait, the original array has two zeros. After cloning, there are two copies, so total of 4 zeros. To have an array of 6 elements all zeros, you need 6 zeros. So the total zeros available is 4, which is less than 6. So you need to clone again. \n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal number of clones needed so that the total count of the target x across all copies is at least n. Then, the number of clones is (ceil(n / count_x) - 1). \n\nWait, let's think of it this way: \n\nSuppose the target is x, which occurs c times in the original array. \n\nThe number of clones needed is k such that (k+1)*c >= n. \n\nThe minimal k is ceil(n/(c)) -1. \n\nEach clone is an operation. \n\nBut then, after that, you can arrange the elements via swaps. The swaps are needed to move the x's into one array. But how many swaps are needed? \n\nWait, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. Because the problem's note's example has 6 operations, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's note says that the answer is 6, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the second test case, the answer is 6. Let me see the example's steps again. \n\nThe example's explanation says that after cloning, they have two copies. Then they swap elements so that all zeros are in one array. Then they clone again (so two clones so far?), and then swap again. The total is 6 operations. \n\nHmm, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. Because the example's steps have two clones and four swaps (total 6). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the swap operations as a single operation for all swaps done in a step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's note's example's answer is 6, which is the number of clones plus some other steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts only the number of clones as the operations. But in the first example, the answer is 0, which makes sense. The second example's answer is 6, but that would require 6 clones, which doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's operations. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says:\n\nYou can do operations of two types:\n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy of the chosen array. \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. \n\nYou need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal. \n\nEach operation is either a clone or a swap. So each swap is an operation. \n\nBut in the example's note, the answer is 6. Let's see:\n\nThe example's steps:\n\n- First clone (1 operation).\n\n- Then swap elements (how many swaps? Let's see, the first array has two copies. To get all zeros in one array, they need to move the non-zero elements from the first array to the second. \n\nThe first array after cloning has two copies. The original array has two zeros. So each copy has two zeros. \n\nThe desired array must have 6 zeros. So the total zeros available after k clones is (k+1)*2. \n\nTo have 6 zeros, (k+1)*2 >=6 \u2192 k+1 >=3 \u2192 k=2. So two clones (so two operations). \n\nBut the example's answer is 6. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait the example's input is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The target is 0. The count of 0 is 2. \n\nTo have an array of 6 zeros, the total zeros needed is 6. \n\nThe total zeros after k clones is (k+1)*2. \n\nWe need (k+1)*2 >=6 \u2192 k+1 >=3 \u2192 k=2. So two clones (operations). \n\nBut the example's answer is 6. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the problem requires more than just the clones. \n\nWait the problem requires that after some operations, there exists at least one copy (array) where all elements are equal. \n\nThe swaps are needed to arrange the elements. \n\nThe number of swaps needed would be the number of elements not equal to the target in the desired array. \n\nWait, for example, if the desired array has n elements all x, then the number of non-x elements in that array must be zero. \n\nThe total number of x's across all arrays is (k+1)*c. \n\nTo form one array with n x's, the other arrays can have the remaining x's. \n\nThe minimal number of swaps needed would be the number of non-x elements in the desired array. Because each non-x element must be swapped with an x from another array. \n\nEach swap can exchange one non-x with an x. So for m non-x elements in the desired array, you need m swaps. \n\nWait, but each swap can exchange two elements. So for each non-x in the desired array, you can swap it with an x from another array. Each such swap removes one non-x from the desired array. So the number of swaps needed is exactly the number of non-x elements in the desired array. \n\nThus, the total operations would be the number of clones (k) plus the number of swaps (m). \n\nBut how to compute m? \n\nWait, the desired array has n elements, all x. The total x's available is (k+1)*c. \n\nThe desired array uses n of them, so the remaining (k+1)*c -n must be >=0. \n\nThe number of non-x elements in the desired array is (original array's length) * (number of copies) minus the total x's? No, perhaps the desired array is one of the copies. \n\nWait, the desired array is one of the copies. The other copies can have the remaining x's. \n\nThe number of non-x elements in the desired array is zero. \n\nWait, but how do you get there? \n\nThe total x's available is (k+1)*c. \n\nThe desired array must have exactly n x's. The other arrays can have the remaining (k+1)*c -n x's. \n\nThe number of non-x elements in the desired array is (n - (number of x's in desired array)). But since desired array has all x's, that's zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the swaps are needed to move the x's into the desired array. \n\nWait, the problem allows swapping any two elements between any copies. So to form the desired array, you can take all the x's from all copies and put them into one array. \n\nThe number of non-x elements in that array would be (n - (number of x's in that array)). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of swaps is (n - (number of x's in the original array)) * something. \n\nAlternatively, the number of swaps needed is (n - c) * (something). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. Because otherwise, the example's answer would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's note says that the answer is 6, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem counts only the number of clones as the operations. But in the example, the required clones would be 2 (since 2 clones gives 3 copies, so 3*2=6 zeros, which is exactly needed). So the answer would be 2, but the example's answer is 6. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. \n\nLet me think of the example again. \n\nThe example's input array has two zeros. \n\nTo get an array of 6 zeros, you need 3 copies (so 2 clones). \n\nThe total zeros are 3*2=6. \n\nNow, to arrange those 6 zeros into one array, you need to move all the zeros into one array. \n\nThe other arrays can have the remaining elements. \n\nThe number of swaps needed would be the number of non-zero elements in the desired array. \n\nWait, the desired array must have all zeros. So the other arrays can have the non-zero elements. \n\nThe original array has 6 elements. Each copy has 6 elements. \n\nAfter 2 clones, there are 3 copies. \n\nThe total elements across all copies are 3*6 = 18. \n\nThe desired array (one of the copies) has 6 zeros. The other two copies have the remaining elements. \n\nThe non-zero elements in the desired array must be zero. \n\nTo achieve this, the non-zero elements in the desired array must be swapped with zeros from other copies. \n\nThe number of non-zero elements in the desired array initially is 4 (since original array has 2 zeros and 4 non-zeros). \n\nEach copy has the same elements. So after cloning, each copy has 2 zeros and 4 non-zeros. \n\nThe desired array (one of the copies) has 6 elements. To turn all into zeros, you need to replace the 4 non-zeros with zeros from other copies. \n\nEach swap can exchange a non-zero in the desired array with a zero from another array. \n\nEach such swap reduces the number of non-zeros in the desired array by 1. \n\nSo to eliminate 4 non-zeros, you need 4 swaps. \n\nThus, the total operations would be 2 clones + 4 swaps = 6, which matches the example's answer. \n\nAh! So the total operations are the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. \n\nSo the formula for the minimal operations for a target x with count c is:\n\nclones_needed = ceil(n / c) - 1 \n\nswaps_needed = (n - c) \n\nWait, no. Wait, the number of non-x elements in the desired array is (original array's length) * (number of copies) - (total x's) ? \n\nWait, the desired array has n elements, all x. \n\nThe total x's available is (clones_needed +1)*c. \n\nThe desired array uses n of them. \n\nThe other arrays can have the remaining. \n\nThe number of non-x elements in the desired array is (n - (number of x's in desired array)). But since desired array has all x's, that's zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the swaps needed are the number of non-x elements in the desired array before any swaps. \n\nWait, the desired array starts as a copy of the original array. So initially, it has c x's and (n - c) non-x elements. \n\nTo turn all into x's, you need to replace each of the (n - c) non-x elements with an x from another array. \n\nEach swap can replace one non-x with an x. \n\nThus, the number of swaps needed is exactly (n - c). \n\nWait, but after cloning, the total x's are (k+1)*c. \n\nThe desired array must have n x's, so the other arrays can have ( (k+1)*c - n ) x's. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (n - c_initial_in_desired_array). \n\nWait, the desired array is one of the copies. Initially, each copy has c x's. \n\nAfter k clones, there are (k+1) copies. \n\nThe desired array (one of them) has c x's. To get to n x's, you need to bring in (n - c) x's from other copies. \n\nEach x brought in requires a swap with a non-x element from the desired array. \n\nEach such swap takes one operation. \n\nThus, the number of swaps needed is (n - c). \n\nWait, but the total x's available is (k+1)*c. \n\nWe need (k+1)*c >= n. \n\nThe minimal k is ceil(n/c) -1. \n\nThus, the total operations for x is (k) + (n - c). \n\nWait, but when you have k clones, the number of copies is (k+1). \n\nWait, the swaps needed are (n - c) because each non-x in the desired array must be swapped with an x from another array. \n\nSo the total operations for x is (number of clones) + (number of swaps). \n\nThus, the formula is:\n\noperations = (ceil(n/c) -1) + (n - c) \n\nWait, but let's test this with the example. \n\nIn the example, the target is 0, c=2, n=6. \n\nceil(6/2) -1 = 3-1 =2 clones. \n\nswaps needed: 6-2 =4. \n\nTotal 2+4=6, which matches the example. \n\nAnother test case where all elements are already equal (first example). \n\nc =n, so ceil(n/n) -1 =1-1=0 clones. \n\nswaps needed: n -n =0. \n\nTotal 0, which matches. \n\nAnother example: if n=3, and c=1. \n\nceil(3/1) -1 =3-1=2 clones. \n\nswaps needed: 3-1=2. \n\nTotal 2+2=4. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. \n\nSo the formula is for each candidate x (the value we want to turn into all elements), compute the operations as (ceil(n/c) -1) + (n - c). \n\nWe need to find the x with the maximum c (since that would minimize the operations). \n\nWait, but maybe there's a better x with a lower c but a better total. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose n=5, and the array has elements [1,1,2,2,2]. \n\nc for 1 is 2, for 2 is 3. \n\nFor x=2: \n\nceil(5/3) -1 = 2-1=1 clone. \n\nswaps needed:5-3=2. \n\nTotal 3. \n\nFor x=1: \n\nceil(5/2) -1 =3-1=2 clones. \n\nswaps needed:5-2=3. \n\nTotal 5. \n\nSo choosing x=2 is better. \n\nThus, the minimal operations is achieved by choosing the x with the maximum c. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Count the frequency of each element in the array. \n\n- Find the maximum frequency, say max_freq. \n\n- The minimal operations would be (ceil(n / max_freq) -1) + (n - max_freq). \n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements with the same max_freq? \n\nWe can choose any of them, since they give the same result. \n\nThus, the minimal operations is (ceil(n / max_freq) -1) + (n - max_freq). \n\nWait, but let me check another example. \n\nSuppose n=4, and the array is [1,1,2,2]. \n\nmax_freq is 2. \n\nceil(4/2) -1 =2-1=1 clone. \n\nswaps needed:4-2=2. \n\nTotal 3. \n\nAlternatively, if we choose x=1, then:\n\nclones: ceil(4/2) -1 =1. \n\nswaps:4-2=2 \u2192 total 3. \n\nSame for x=2. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: n=5, array [3,3,3,4,4]. \n\nmax_freq is 3. \n\nceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 clones needed 1. \n\nswaps:5-3=2 \u2192 total 3. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py is to compute for each test case the maximum frequency of any element, then compute (ceil(n/c) -1) + (n - c). \n\nNow, how to implement this in Python. \n\nThe code given starts with:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nInside the loop, we need to read n and the array. \n\nThen compute the frequency with Counter. \n\nFind the maximum frequency. \n\nThen compute the formula. \n\nWait, but how to compute ceil(n / c). \n\nIn Python, ceil can be done via (n + c -1) // c. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, then the array. \n\ncounts = Counter(arr).values()\n\nmax_freq = max(counts)\n\nclones = (n + max_freq -1) // max_freq -1 \n\nswaps = n - max_freq \n\ntotal = clones + swaps \n\nprint(total)\n\nThus, the code for program1.py's missing part is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nfreq = Counter(a)\nmax_freq = max(freq.values())\nclones = (n + max_freq -1) // max_freq -1\nswaps = n - max_freq\nprint(clones + swaps)\n\nSo that's the code for program1.py. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. \n\nThe moves allowed are for each i, add or subtract a_i to b_i. \n\nInitially, all b_i are 0. \n\nWe need to choose for each i, some number of additions or subtractions of a_i, such that the resulting b array is strictly increasing. \n\nThe minimal number of moves is the sum of the absolute values of the changes divided by a_i? Wait, no. \n\nWait each move for i is either adding or subtracting a_i once. So each move contributes +a_i or -a_i to b_i. \n\nThe total moves for b_i is the number of times you add or subtract a_i. \n\nThe goal is to choose for each b_i a value such that b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n, and the sum of the absolute values of (b_i / a_i) is minimized. \n\nWait, no. Because each move for i is either adding or subtracting a_i once. So the total moves for b_i is the number of steps taken. \n\nThe value of b_i is equal to k_i * a_i, where k_i can be any integer (positive or negative), and the total moves for b_i is |k_i|. \n\nWait, no. Because each move is either adding or subtracting a_i once. So the total moves for b_i is the number of times you add or subtract. \n\nThus, the value of b_i is (number of adds - number of subtracts) * a_i. \n\nThe total moves for b_i is (number of adds + number of subtracts). \n\nThus, to reach a certain b_i, the minimal moves is |b_i / a_i|, but only if a_i divides b_i. \n\nWait, since each move contributes \u00b1a_i, the total b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nThus, b_i = k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer. \n\nThe number of moves for b_i is |k_i|. \n\nWait, no. Because each move is either adding or subtracting a_i once. So each move contributes +a_i or -a_i. \n\nThe total number of moves for b_i is the number of steps taken. \n\nSuppose you add a_i m times and subtract a_i n times. Then the total is m + n moves, and the value is (m -n)*a_i. \n\nThe minimal moves to reach a certain value is the minimal (m + n) such that (m -n)*a_i = target. \n\nThe minimal m + n is |target| / a_i + (something?) \n\nWait, let's see. Let target = k * a_i. \n\nThen m - n = k. \n\nWe want to minimize m + n. \n\nExpressed as m = n +k. \n\nThen m +n = 2n +k. \n\nTo minimize this, n should be as small as possible. \n\nIf k is positive: \n\nn can be 0 \u2192 m =k \u2192 total moves k. \n\nIf k is negative: \n\nLet k = -|k|. \n\nThen m -n = -|k|. \n\nWe can set n = m + |k|. \n\nThen m +n = m + (m + |k|) = 2m + |k|. \n\nTo minimize this, set m as small as possible. \n\nThe minimal is when m=0 \u2192 n = |k|. \n\nTotal moves |k|. \n\nThus, the minimal moves for a given k_i is |k_i|. \n\nThus, the total moves is the sum of |k_i| for all i. \n\nThe problem is to choose integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nb_i = k_i * a_i \n\nand \n\nb_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n \n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nWe need to find the minimal sum of |k_i| under these constraints. \n\nThe approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem or find a greedy approach. \n\nLet me think of the constraints. \n\nWe need b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n. \n\nEach b_i = k_i * a_i. \n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\n\nk_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 \n\nk_2 * a_2 < k_3 * a_3 \n\nand so on. \n\nThe variables are the k_i's. \n\nThe goal is to choose integers k_i to minimize sum |k_i|. \n\nHmm, this seems challenging. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to choose the minimal steps such that each b_i is at least b_{i-1} +1 (since strictly increasing). \n\nWait, but the b_i can be any real numbers as long as they are strictly increasing. But since they are multiples of a_i, perhaps we can model it step by step. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the previous term. \n\nWe can process the array from left to right. \n\nFor each i, we need to choose k_i such that:\n\nk_i * a_i > b_{i-1} \n\nwhere b_{i-1} is the value of the previous term. \n\nBut since b_{i-1} = k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}, \n\nthe constraint is:\n\nk_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1} \n\nWe need to choose k_i as small as possible (in absolute terms) to satisfy this. \n\nBut how to track this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this greedily. \n\nLet me think of the minimal possible k_i given the previous constraints. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nWe can track the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints. \n\nLet me see. \n\nInitialize b_1 can be any multiple of a_1. To minimize |k_1|, the best is to set k_1 =0, so b_1=0. \n\nBut then for the next term, b_2 must be >0. \n\nBut b_2 =k_2 *a_2. \n\nThus, k_2 must be at least 1 (if a_2 is positive). \n\nWait, but a_i can be any positive integer (given in the input). \n\nWait the problem says \"array a consisting of n positive integers\". \n\nYes, a_i are positive. \n\nThus, a_i is positive. \n\nThus, for each term, the minimal possible k_i is such that the current b_i is just above the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nLet me denote the previous term's value as prev. \n\nFor the current term i, we need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nWe want to choose the minimal |k_i| possible. \n\nBut since a_i is positive, k_i can be as small as possible. \n\nWait, but to minimize the total moves (sum |k_i|), we want to choose the smallest possible k_i in absolute terms. \n\nThus, for each i, given the previous b_{i-1}, we need to choose the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and |k_i| is as small as possible. \n\nBut how to choose this? \n\nLet me think of the minimal possible k_i. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nSince a_i is positive, k_i can be ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, because:\n\nWe need k_i * a_i > b_{i-1} \n\n=> k_i > b_{i-1}/a_i \n\nThe minimal integer k_i is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. \n\nBut since k_i can be negative, but that might not help. \n\nWait, but if we choose a negative k_i, then the current term would be negative, which might not satisfy the previous constraints. \n\nFor example, if previous term was 0, then current term must be >0. So k_i must be positive. \n\nThus, for each step, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1}/a_i). \n\nThus, k_i = ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose b_{i-1} is 5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen k_i must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6>5). \n\nSo ceil(5/3) =2. \n\nThus, k_i =2. \n\nThus, the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1}) /a_i ) +1? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i *a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo k_i must be > b_{i-1}/a_i. \n\nThus, the minimal integer k_i is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the minimal k_i is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. \n\nBut this gives the minimal k_i in terms of being the smallest possible integer. \n\nHowever, this may not be the minimal in terms of |k_i|. \n\nWait, but since the previous terms are built up, and the current term must be larger than the previous, the k_i must be positive. \n\nBecause if previous terms are positive, then current term must be larger. \n\nWait, the first term can be zero (k_1=0). \n\nThen the second term must be positive. \n\nThus, for the second term, k_2 must be at least 1. \n\nThus, in general, all k_i must be non-negative? \n\nWait, no. Suppose the first term is set to a negative value. \n\nFor example, if a_1 is 2, then setting k_1 =-1 gives b_1 =-2. \n\nThen the second term can be 0 (k_2=0), but that would not be larger than -2. \n\nWait, but the second term must be larger than the first. \n\nThus, if the first term is -2, the second term must be >-2. \n\nSo k_2 can be 0 (0> -2). \n\nThus, it's possible to have negative k_i's. \n\nBut choosing negative k_i's might allow for smaller total moves. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total moves is achieved by choosing the minimal possible k_i's in a way that each step is just barely larger than the previous. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nWe can model the minimal required b_i as follows. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the minimal possible b_i such that the sequence is increasing and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nWe can process the array from left to right, keeping track of the minimal possible b_i and the corresponding k_i. \n\nLet me try to formalize this. \n\nInitialize for the first element:\n\nThe minimal |k_1| is 0 (k_1=0 \u2192 b_1=0). \n\nThen for the second element, we need b_2 >0. \n\nThe minimal |k_2| is 1 (k_2=1 \u2192 b_2 =a_2). \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. \n\nWait, but if a_2 is very large, then choosing k_2=1 gives a large b_2, but maybe we can choose a smaller k_2 if possible. \n\nWait, no. Because b_2 must be greater than 0. \n\nThus, the minimal k_2 is 1. \n\nProceeding to the third element, we need b_3 > b_2. \n\nThe minimal k_3 is ceil(b_2 /a_3) +1? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the minimal k_3 is the smallest integer such that k_3 *a_3 > b_2. \n\nThe minimal k_3 is ceil(b_2 /a_3) +1? \n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLet\u2019s say b_2 is 5, a_3 is 3. \n\nThen k_3 must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6>5). \n\nThus, ceil(5/3) =2 \u2192 so k_3=2. \n\nThus, the minimal k_3 is ceil(b_2 /a_3). \n\nWait, because 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceil gives 2. \n\nThus, the minimal k_3 is ceil(b_2 /a_3). \n\nThus, the formula is k_i = ceil( (b_{i-1}) / a_i ) +1? \n\nNo, it's ceil( (b_{i-1}) / a_i ) gives the minimal integer k_i such that k_i *a_i >= b_{i-1} +1. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWe need k_i *a_i > b_{i-1} \n\n=> k_i > b_{i-1}/a_i \n\nThe smallest integer k_i is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. \n\nWhich is equal to ceil( (b_{i-1} +1)/a_i ). \n\nAlternatively, ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ) may be sufficient. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf b_{i-1} is exactly divisible by a_i, then ceil(b_{i-1}/a_i) = b_{i-1}/a_i. \n\nThen k_i must be greater than that, so the minimal k_i is (b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. \n\nThus, the minimal k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1})/a_i ) +1? \n\nNo, because if b_{i-1} is not divisible by a_i, then ceil(b_{i-1}/a_i) is already the minimal integer greater than b_{i-1}/a_i. \n\nThus, the minimal k_i is ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ). \n\nWait, let me test with b_{i-1}=5, a_i=3. \n\nceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nIf b_{i-1}=6, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(6/3)=2 \u2192 but 2*3=6 is not greater than 6. So need 3. \n\nAh, right. \n\nThus, when b_{i-1} is divisible by a_i, then the minimal k_i is (b_{i-1}/a_i)+1. \n\nThus, the formula is:\n\nk_i = ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ) \n\nif b_{i-1} mod a_i !=0 \u2192 then ceil gives the correct value. \n\nBut if b_{i-1} mod a_i ==0 \u2192 then ceil(b_{i-1}/a_i) = b_{i-1}/a_i \u2192 but then k_i must be larger than that, so k_i = (b_{i-1}/a_i) +1. \n\nThus, the minimal k_i is ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ) if there is a remainder, else ceil(...) +1. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is floor( b_{i-1}/a_i ) +1. \n\nYes, because:\n\nIf b_{i-1} = q*a_i + r, where 0<=r <a_i. \n\nThen floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) = q. \n\nThus, q+1 is the minimal k_i. \n\nThus, the formula is k_i = floor( b_{i-1}/a_i ) +1. \n\nThus, the minimal k_i is floor( (b_{i-1}) /a_i ) +1. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize prev =0 (since b_1 can be 0). \n\nsum_moves =0 \n\nfor i from 1 to n:\n\n    if i ==1:\n\n        k_i =0 \n\n        prev =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        required_k = (prev // a[i-1]) +1 \n\n        # because a is 1-based in the input? \n\n        # Wait, the array a is 0-based in code. \n\n        # Let me think in code terms. \n\n        # Suppose a is stored as a list from 0 to n-1. \n\n        # For i from 2 to n (since first is handled separately):\n\n        # For the second element (i=2 in 1-based, index 1 in 0-based):\n\n        # a[i-1] is a[1]. \n\n        # So for the ith element (1-based), the a is a[i-1]. \n\n        # So for the current step (i-th element in 1-based):\n\n        a_i = a[i-1]\n\n        required_k = (prev // a_i) +1 \n\n        k_i = required_k \n\n    sum_moves += abs(k_i) \n\n    prev = k_i * a_i \n\nWait, but this is for the first element. \n\nWait, let's reindex properly. \n\nLet me think in code terms. \n\nThe code given for program2.py is:\n\nm=int(input())\na=[int(i)for i in input().split()]\nt1,min=0,10**20\nwhile(t1<m):\n    t2=t1\n    k,t=0,0\n    while(t2<m-1):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    t2=t1\n    k=0\n    while(t2>0):\n        t+=(k//a[t2-1]+1)\n        k=a[t2-1]*(k//a[t2-1]+1)\n        t2-=1\n    if(min>t):\n        min=t\n    t1+=1\nprint(min)\n\nHmm, this code is quite confusing. \n\nThe problem requires to find the minimal number of moves. \n\nThe code given has a loop over t1 from 0 to m-1 (since while t1 <m). \n\nInside, there's a loop over t2 =t1, then another loop. \n\nThis seems like a brute-force approach, but for n up to 5000, this would be O(n^2), which might be acceptable. \n\nBut the code is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to choose k_1, k_2,...,k_n such that:\n\nk_1*a_1 < k_2*a_2 < ... <k_n*a_n \n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nThe minimal sum is achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i's. \n\nThe key is to choose each k_i as small as possible given the previous constraints. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nInitialize prev =0 (since b_1 =k_1*a_1 must be as small as possible. \n\nThe first term can be set to 0 (k_1=0). \n\nThen for the second term, we need k_2*a_2 >0 \u2192 minimal k_2 is 1. \n\nThen for the third term, k_3*a_3 must be >k_2*a_2. \n\nThe minimal k_3 is ceil( (k_2*a_2) /a_3 ) +1? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the minimal k_3 is the smallest integer such that k_3*a_3 > prev. \n\nprev is the previous term's value. \n\nThus, for each step i (starting from 2 to n):\n\nprev = previous term's value \n\na_i is the current a's value \n\nk_i = ceil( (prev) /a_i ) +1? \n\nNo, as before, the minimal k_i is floor(prev /a_i) +1. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nprev =0 \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor i from 1 to n:\n\n    if i ==1:\n\n        k_i =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        k_i = (prev // a[i-1]) +1 \n\n    total += abs(k_i) \n\n    prev = k_i * a[i-1] \n\nWait, but this is for the first element. \n\nWait, for the first element (i=1), the code sets k_i=0. \n\nThen for the second element (i=2), a[i-1] is a[1]. \n\nWait, but in the first iteration (i=2), the previous value is 0. \n\nThus, k_2 = (0 // a[1]) +1 \u2192 0 +1 =1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThen prev becomes 1*a[1]. \n\nFor the third element (i=3), a[i-1] is a[2]. \n\nk_3 = (prev // a[2]) +1 \n\nprev is a[1]. \n\nThus, this would give the minimal k_3. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nBut what about the first element? \n\nSuppose the first element's a_1 is 5. \n\nThen k_1=0 \u2192 b_1=0. \n\nBut what if we choose k_1 =-1 \u2192 b_1 =-5. \n\nThen the second term can be 0 (k_2=0), which is larger than -5. \n\nThis would give a smaller total (1 move for first term, but 0 for second \u2192 total 1, which is better than 1 for second term (total 1). \n\nWait, in this case, choosing k_1 =-1 and k_2=0 gives total moves 1+0=1, which is better than the previous approach's total of 1 (k_2=1 gives total 1). \n\nThus, the previous approach is not optimal. \n\nAh, so the greedy approach of setting k_i as small as possible may not be optimal. \n\nThus, the problem requires a different approach. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nThe problem requires that the sequence is strictly increasing. \n\nThe minimal moves is the sum of |k_i|. \n\nWe need to choose k_i such that:\n\nk_1*a_1 < k_2*a_2 < ... <k_n*a_n \n\nand sum |k_i| is minimized. \n\nThis is an optimization problem with constraints. \n\nPerhaps the optimal solution is to set each k_i as small as possible, but allowing negative values where possible. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables. \n\nLet me denote b_i =k_i *a_i. \n\nThe constraints are b_1 <b_2 < ... <b_n. \n\nWe need to minimize sum |k_i|. \n\nThis is an integer programming problem. \n\nBut for n up to 5000, we need an O(n) or O(n^2) solution. \n\nPerhaps the optimal solution can be found by greedily choosing the minimal possible b_i at each step. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can track the minimal possible b_i such that the sequence is increasing and the sum is minimized. \n\nWe can process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, we choose the smallest possible b_i such that b_i > b_{i-1}, and b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nThe minimal b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nThis would give the minimal possible b_i, thus allowing the next terms to be as small as possible. \n\nThis approach would minimize the required b_i's, thus possibly leading to smaller k_i's. \n\nLet me see with the previous example where a_1=5, a_2=1. \n\nThe first term can be 0 (k_1=0). \n\nThe second term must be >0. The smallest multiple of 1 greater than 0 is 1 \u2192 k_2=1 \u2192 total moves 1. \n\nAlternatively, if we set k_1 =-1 \u2192 b_1 =-5. \n\nThen the second term can be 0 \u2192 k_2=0 \u2192 total moves 1. \n\nWhich is better. \n\nThus, the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i may not be optimal. \n\nThus, the problem requires a different approach. \n\nPerhaps the optimal solution is to set each b_i to be the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, but allowing negative values where possible. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by setting each b_i to be the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, but using the minimal k_i. \n\nWait, but how to choose between different options. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming. \n\nLet\u2019s define dp[i] as the minimal sum of moves up to the i-th element, and the value of b_i. \n\nBut since b_i can be any value, this is not feasible for large n. \n\nAlternatively, we can track the minimal possible b_i and the corresponding sum. \n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nInitialize for the first element:\n\nThe possible choices are any k_1, but to minimize the sum, we choose k_1=0 \u2192 b_1=0, sum=0. \n\nFor the second element:\n\nWe need b_2 >0. \n\nThe minimal possible b_2 is a_2 (k_2=1 \u2192 sum +=1). \n\nAlternatively, if a_2 is large, maybe a smaller k_2 is possible if we choose a negative k_1. \n\nWait, but for the first element, choosing k_1 =-1 gives b_1 =-a_1. \n\nThen for the second element, b_2 can be 0 (k_2=0), which is larger than -a_1. \n\nThe sum would be 1 (for k_1) +0 =1. \n\nWhich is better than the previous approach's sum of 1. \n\nThus, this is better. \n\nThus, the optimal solution may require choosing negative k_i's for earlier terms to allow smaller k_i's for later terms. \n\nThis suggests that the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i at each step may not be optimal. \n\nThus, we need a different approach. \n\nPerhaps the optimal solution can be found by ensuring that each b_i is just larger than the previous b_{i-1}, but using the minimal possible k_i. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can track the minimal possible b_i such that b_i is the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nTo do this, we can compute for each step the minimal possible b_i given the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nThe corresponding k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1}+1)/a_i ). \n\nThis would give the minimal possible b_i, thus allowing the next terms to be as small as possible. \n\nThis approach would give the minimal possible b_i sequence, which might lead to the minimal sum. \n\nLet me test this with the previous example where a_1=5, a_2=1. \n\nFirst step: b_1=0 (k_1=0). \n\nSecond step: minimal b_2 is 1 (k_2=1 \u2192 sum 1). \n\nTotal sum is 1. \n\nAlternatively, choosing k_1=-1 gives b_1=-5. \n\nThen the minimal b_2 is 0 (k_2=0 \u2192 sum 1). \n\nTotal sum is 1. \n\nSame result. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSuppose a = [3,1,2]. \n\nThe first approach:\n\nb_1=0 \u2192 k_1=0. \n\nb_2 must be >0 \u2192 minimal is 1 (k_2=1 \u2192 sum 1). \n\nb_3 must be >1 \u2192 minimal is 2 (k_3=1 \u2192 sum 0+1+1=2). \n\nTotal sum 2. \n\nAlternatively, choosing k_1 =-1 \u2192 b_1 =-3. \n\nThen b_2 can be 0 (k_2=0 \u2192 sum 1). \n\nThen b_3 must be >0 \u2192 minimal is 2 (k_3=1 \u2192 sum 1+0+1=2). \n\nSame total. \n\nAnother example where choosing negative k_i's is better: \n\nSuppose a = [2, 3]. \n\nOption 1: \n\nb_1=0 \u2192 k_1=0. \n\nb_2 must be >0 \u2192 minimal is 3 (k_2=1 \u2192 sum 1). \n\nTotal 1. \n\nOption 2: \n\nk_1 =-1 \u2192 b_1 =-2. \n\nb_2 can be 0 \u2192 k_2=0 \u2192 sum 1. \n\nSame total. \n\nAnother example where choosing negative k_i's is better: \n\nSuppose a = [5, 1, 1]. \n\nOption 1: \n\nb_1=0 \u2192 k_1=0. \n\nb_2 must be >0 \u2192 1 (k_2=1 \u2192 sum 1). \n\nb_3 must be >1 \u2192 2 (k_3=2 \u2192 sum 3). \n\nTotal 3. \n\nOption 2: \n\nk_1 =-1 \u2192 b_1 =-5. \n\nb_2 can be 0 (k_2=0 \u2192 sum 1). \n\nb_3 must be >0 \u2192 1 (k_3=1 \u2192 sum 2). \n\nTotal 1+0+1=2. \n\nThis is better. \n\nThus, the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i may not be optimal. \n\nThus, the optimal solution requires that we choose the minimal possible b_i such that the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nThis suggests that we need to track the minimal possible sum up to each step, considering all possible previous b_{i-1} values. \n\nBut this is computationally infeasible for large n. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, but with some constraints. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's note. \n\nThe example given in the problem's note says that for the second example, the answer is 10. \n\nThe input is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. \n\nThe optimal solution is to have b as [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]. \n\nThe moves are: \n\nFor the first element: -3 \u2192 k_1 =-3 \u2192 moves 3. \n\nSecond: -2 \u2192 k_2 =-1 \u2192 moves 1. \n\nThird: -1 \u2192 k_3 =-0.333? No, but a_3 is 3 \u2192 k_3 =-1/3? No, k must be integer. \n\nWait, the example's note says the final array is [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]. \n\nThe a array must be such that each b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, the example's note says the a array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. \n\nThus, for the first element (a_1=1), b_1 =-3 \u2192 k_1 =-3 \u2192 moves 3. \n\nSecond element (a_2=2): b_2 =-2 \u2192 k_2 =-1 \u2192 moves 1. \n\nThird (a_3=3): b_3 =-1 \u2192 not possible since -1 is not divisible by 3. \n\nAh, perhaps the example's a array is different. \n\nThe note says example 2's input is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], and the final b array is [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]. \n\nWait, for the third element (a_3=3), b_3 must be a multiple of 3. \n\n-1 is not a multiple of 3. \n\nThus, perhaps the example's a array is different. \n\nThe note says example 2's answer is 10. \n\nThe example's explanation says the final array is [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]. \n\nThe a array must be such that each b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nFor example, a_3 must be 1, but that's not the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's a array is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. \n\nThen the b array can be as described. \n\nBut the problem's note says the example's a array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. \n\nThus, the example's explanation must have a different a array. \n\nRegardless, the problem requires an efficient algorithm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nWe can track the minimal possible value of b_i such that the sequence is increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nAt each step i, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, and the corresponding k_i is chosen to minimize the sum. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the code given in program2.py. \n\nThe code given for program2.py has a loop over t1 from 0 to m-1 (where m is n). \n\nInside, there's a loop over t2 =t1, then another loop. \n\nThe code seems to be trying all possible starting points and calculating the required moves. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimal moves by ensuring that each b_i is at least the previous b_{i-1} plus 1. \n\nWait, the sequence must be strictly increasing, so b_i must be at least b_{i-1}+1. \n\nThus, the minimal possible b_i is b_{i-1}+1. \n\nBut b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nThus, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nThis is the same as the greedy approach. \n\nThe corresponding k_i is ceil( (b_{i-1}+1)/a_i ). \n\nThe sum of the absolute values of these k_i's is the minimal possible. \n\nThus, this approach would give the minimal sum. \n\nBut in the previous example where a = [5,1,1], this approach would give:\n\nb_1 =0 \u2192 k_1=0. \n\nb_2 must be >0 \u2192 minimal is 1 \u2192 k_2=1 \u2192 sum 1. \n\nb_3 must be >1 \u2192 minimal is 2 \u2192 k_3=2 \u2192 sum 3. \n\nTotal 3. \n\nBut the alternative approach of choosing k_1 =-1 gives a total of 2. \n\nThus, this approach is not optimal. \n\nThus, the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i is not optimal. \n\nThis suggests that the problem requires a different approach. \n\nPerhaps the optimal solution is to choose the minimal possible k_i such that the sequence is increasing, but allowing previous terms to be as small as possible (even negative). \n\nThe key is to choose the minimal possible k_i such that the sequence is increasing, but the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nThis can be modeled as follows: \n\nWe can track the minimal possible b_i such that b_i is the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nTo do this, we can compute for each step the minimal possible b_i and the corresponding sum. \n\nThe algorithm would be: \n\nInitialize prev =0 \n\nsum =0 \n\nfor i from 2 to n: \n\n    # compute the minimal possible b_i such that b_i > prev \n\n    # and b_i is a multiple of a[i-1] \n\n    # and the sum of |k_i| is minimized \n\n    # the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a[i-1] greater than prev \n\n    # but this may not be optimal \n\n    # alternatively, we can choose the smallest possible k_i such that k_i*a_i > prev \n\n    # and the sum is minimized \n\n    # the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i*a_i > prev \n\n    # and the absolute value is minimized \n\n    # thus, k_i can be either ceil(prev/a_i) or floor(prev/a_i)+1 \n\n    # but need to choose the one with minimal absolute value \n\n    # but this requires considering both options \n\n    # this seems complicated \n\nAlternatively, the optimal solution is to set each b_i to be the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, but allowing negative values for previous terms. \n\nThis requires that we choose the minimal possible k_i such that the sequence is increasing. \n\nThe minimal sum is achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i in absolute terms. \n\nThus, for each step, we can choose the smallest possible k_i such that k_i*a_i > b_{i-1}, and the absolute value of k_i is as small as possible. \n\nThis can be done by choosing k_i as the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nThus, the possible candidates for k_i are: \n\nk_candidate = ceil( (b_{i-1}) /a_i ) \n\nor \n\nk_candidate = floor( (b_{i-1}) /a_i ) +1 \n\nBut also possibly negative values. \n\nWait, for example, if b_{i-1} is very large, then k_i must be large positive. \n\nBut if b_{i-1} is negative, then k_i can be zero or positive. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe minimal number of moves is the sum of the minimal required increments for each element to ensure the sequence is increasing. \n\nThe minimal moves can be computed by ensuring that each b_i is at least b_{i-1}+1, and the minimal k_i is chosen to achieve this with minimal moves. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nprev =0 \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor i in 1 to n: \n\n    if i ==1: \n\n        k_i =0 \n\n    else: \n\n        required = prev +1 \n\n        # find the smallest k_i such that k_i *a_i >= required \n\n        # and the absolute value is minimized \n\n        # the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i*a_i >= required \n\n        # and the absolute value is minimal \n\n        # possible candidates are ceil(required/a_i) and floor(required/a_i) \n\n        # but need to choose the one with minimal absolute value \n\n        # compute the minimal k_i \n\n        # compute the minimal k_i \n\n        # the minimal k_i is the smallest integer >= required/a_i \n\n        # but also possibly negative if required is negative \n\n        # but required is prev+1, and prev is the previous b_i \n\n        # which is at least the previous required \n\n        # thus required is positive \n\n        # thus, k_i must be positive \n\n        k_i = ceil(required /a_i) \n\n    total += abs(k_i) \n\n    prev = k_i *a_i \n\nThis approach ensures that each b_i is at least prev+1, thus strictly increasing. \n\nThis would give the minimal possible b_i sequence. \n\nLet me test this with the previous example where a = [5,1,1]. \n\nFirst element: k_1=0 \u2192 b_1=0. \n\nSecond element: required =0+1=1. \n\na_2=1 \u2192 k_2=1 \u2192 b_2=1. \n\nThird element: required =1+1=2. \n\na_3=1 \u2192 k_3=2 \u2192 b_3=2. \n\nTotal moves:0+1+2=3. \n\nBut the alternative approach of choosing k_1 =-1 gives a better total of 2. \n\nThus, this approach is not optimal. \n\nHmm, this is frustrating. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal moves is the sum of the minimal required increments for each element, but allowing previous terms to be as small as possible. \n\nThe optimal solution is to set each b_i to be the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, but allowing negative values for previous terms. \n\nThis requires that we choose the minimal possible k_i such that the sequence is increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nThe key is to choose the smallest possible k_i in absolute terms. \n\nThus, for each step, we can choose the smallest possible k_i such that k_i*a_i > b_{i-1}, and the absolute value of k_i is minimized. \n\nThis can be done by considering both positive and negative k_i's. \n\nFor example, if b_{i-1} is negative, then k_i can be zero or positive. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nprev =0 \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor i from 1 to n: \n\n    if i ==1: \n\n        k_i =0 \n\n    else: \n\n        #

but this requires computation \n\n            # perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i_val \n\n            # which is the same as the previous approach \n\n            k_i = (prev // a_i_val) +1 \n\n    total += abs(k_i) \n\n    prev = k_i * a_i_val \n\nThis approach would handle the previous example where a = [5,1,1]. \n\nFor the second element (i=2): \n\nprev is 0. \n\na_i_val is 1. \n\nk_i =0 is not possible because 0*1 =0 is not >0. \n\nThus, k_i =1 \u2192 sum 1. \n\nThird element (i=3): \n\nprev is 1. \n\na_i_val is 1. \n\nk_i must be >1 \u2192 2 \u2192 sum 3. \n\nTotal 3. \n\nBut the alternative approach of choosing k_1 =-1 gives a better total. \n\nThus, the algorithm is not optimal. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to allow previous terms to be as small as possible, even negative. \n\nThus, the first element can be set to a negative value to allow the second element to have a smaller k_i. \n\nThe algorithm must consider this possibility. \n\nThis suggests that the problem requires a dynamic programming approach where we track the minimal sum for each possible b_i value. \n\nBut for large n, this is not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to set each b_i to be the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, but allowing negative values for previous terms. \n\nThis can be done by choosing the minimal possible k_i such that the sequence is increasing, and the sum is minimized. \n\nThe minimal k_i for each step is the smallest possible integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nThus, for each step, we can compute the minimal possible k_i as follows: \n\nCompute the minimal k_i such that k_i*a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) satisfying this. \n\nTo find this, we can consider the following candidates: \n\n1. The smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\n2. The largest integer less than or equal to prev/a_i, but such that k_i*a_i > prev. \n\nWait, but if prev is negative, then a negative k_i might be possible. \n\nFor example, if prev is -5 and a_i is 3, then k_i can be -1 \u2192 -3 >-5. \n\nThus, this is better than k_i=0 (0> -5 \u2192 yes, but k_i=0 has smaller absolute value. \n\nThus, the minimal k_i is 0. \n\nThus, the algorithm should first check if k_i=0 is possible. \n\nIf yes, choose it. \n\nElse, choose the smallest possible k_i in absolute terms. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nprev =0 \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor i from 1 to n: \n\n    if i ==1: \n\n        k_i =0 \n\n    else: \n\n        a_i_val = a[i-1] \n\n        # check if k_i=0 is possible \n\n        if 0*a_i_val > prev: \n\n            k_i =0 \n\n        else: \n\n            # find the minimal k_i in absolute terms such that k_i*a_i > prev \n\n            # compute the minimal possible k_i \n\n            # the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i_val \n\n            # but also check if there is a smaller k_i with negative values \n\n            #
