The main loop for each query checks if the vertical and horizontal differences are divisible by k. That's necessary because each command moves exactly k steps. If not, it's immediately \"NO\". Then, they compute the maximum blocked cell between the start and finish columns. The code uses the sparse table to find the maximum a_i in the range between the two columns. The condition is checking if that maximum is less than some value derived from the start's y-coordinate. Wait, the code has a line like highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think. Wait, the variables in the code might be mixed up. Let me parse the code again. The first line of input is read as y, x_ = input().split(). Oh, that's probably a mistake. Because the first line of input is n and m. So the code is probably misreading the first line. Like, maybe the first line is n and m, but the code is splitting into y and x_, which would be wrong. That's a problem. So the first line should be n, m = map(int, input().split()), but in the code, it's stored as y and x_, which might be causing errors. But since the user says to complete the code, maybe that's part of the missing code? Wait, but the user's instruction is to output the missing lines.

So that's a mistake. So in the code, the variables n and m are not properly read. So that's a bug.

Then, the code computes smaller and bigger as the min and max of the columns (s[1] and s[3]). Then, the code uses a loop to find the maximum exponent for the sparse table. The code for the sparse table's query is probably correct. The highest variable is the maximum a_i between the two columns.

Wait, but current is x_s. Wait, if x_s >= required \u2192 then R can be x_s, but only if x_s mod k is congruent to itself (which it is). Wait, but required is highest+1. So if x_s >= required \u2192 then R can be x_s, but only if x_s mod k is congruent to x_s mod k \u2192 yes. Wait, but in that case, R is x_s, which is >= required. Wait, but required is highest+1.

The number of such swaps is equal to the number of targets we need to move into the target array. The target array initially has m targets. We need to have n targets. Thus, the number of targets to move in is n -m. Each such target requires a swap. Thus, the number of swaps is (n -m). Thus, total operations: c (clones) + (n -m) (swaps). Wait, this makes sense. Let me test this with the example. Example 2: \n\nm=2, n=6. c = ceil(6/2) -1 \u2192 3-1=2 clones. Thus, clones: 2. \n\nSwaps needed: 6-2 =4. Total operations: 2+4=6 \u2192 which matches the example's answer. Yes!

Another example: \n\nn=5, m=3 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 c=1. Swaps needed 5-3=2 \u2192 total 3. Yes. Thus, the formula is: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) But this can be simplified: \n\nceil(n/m) is the minimal c+1 such that (c+1)*m >=n \u2192 c+1 = ceil(n/m). Thus, the formula is: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n -m) \n\n= ceil(n/m) -1 + n -m \n\n= n -m + ceil(n/m) -1 But perhaps there's a better way to write it. Alternatively, the minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). Thus, the code needs to compute this.

Then, n is the length of the array. m is the maximum frequency. The loop is while m <n: \n\nBut the code is incomplete. The correct approach is to compute the formula: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) But how to compute ceil(n/m) in Python. Ceil(n/m) can be written as (n + m -1) // m \n\nThus, ceil(n/m) = (n + m -1) // m \n\nThus, the formula becomes: \n\noperations = ((n + m -1) // m -1) + (n -m) \n\nSimplify: = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n -m) \n\nLet me compute this for the example: \n\nn=6, m=2 \u2192 (6+2-1)//2 =7//2=3 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 2 + (6-2)=6 \u2192 correct.

The robot moves in commands that are executed k times each. We need to determine for each query if it's possible to get from the start to the finish cell using such commands.\n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, it seems like they're building some sort of sparse table for the blocked cells. The first part initializes a list2 which is probably for range maximum queries. The block array holds the a_i values, which are the number of blocked cells in each column. The sparse table is built for maximums, which makes sense because when moving vertically, the robot can't go below the blocked cells. \n\nThe main loop for each query checks if the vertical and horizontal differences are divisible by k. That's necessary because each command moves exactly k steps. If not, it's immediately \"NO\". \n\nThen, they compute the maximum blocked cell between the start and finish columns. The code uses the sparse table to find the maximum a_i in the range between the two columns. The condition is checking if that maximum is less than some value derived from the start's y-coordinate. Wait, the code has a line like highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think.\n\nWait, the variables in the code might be mixed up. Let me parse the code again. The first line of input is read as y, x_ = input().split(). Oh, that's probably a mistake. Because the first line of input is n and m. So the code is probably misreading the first line. Like, maybe the first line is n and m, but the code is splitting into y and x_, which would be wrong. That's a problem. So the first line should be n, m = map(int, input().split()), but in the code, it's stored as y and x_, which might be causing errors. But since the user says to complete the code, maybe that's part of the missing code?\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is to output the missing lines. So perhaps in program1.py, the first line is wrong. Let me see the code again:\n\nOriginal code for program1.py:\n\nimport math\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\ny, x_ = input().split()\nblock = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\nlist2 = [[0] *20 for i in range( len(block))]\nfor a in range(len(block)):\n    list2[a][0] = block[a]\n    \nz, x = 0, 1\nwhile (1 << x) <= len(block):\n    z = 0\n    while (z + (1 << x) - 1) < len(block):\n        list2[z][x] = (max(list2[z][x - 1], list2[z + (1 << (x - 1))][x - 1]))\n        z += 1\n    x += 1\n    \n \nfor i in range(int(input())):\n    s = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n    if abs(s[0] - s[2]) % s[-1] != 0 or abs(s[1] - s[3]) % s[-1] != 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        smaller = min(s[1], s[3])\n        bigger = max(s[1], s[3])\n        k = 0\n        while (1 << (k + 1)) <= bigger - smaller + 1:\n            k += 1\n        highest = max(list2[smaller - 1][k], list2[bigger - (1 << k)][k])\n        if highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the first line after reading input is y, x_ = input().split(). But the first line of input is n and m. So that's a problem. The variables are named incorrectly. So the first line should be n, m = map(int, input().split()), but here it's stored as y and x_. So that's a mistake. So in the code, the variables n and m are not properly read. So that's a bug. But since the user wants us to fill in the missing parts, perhaps the first line is part of the missing code. Wait, but the user says \"output the missing code, not as markdown code. Output the json with the structure\". So the code given is the existing code, and we have to fill in the missing parts. So the first line is wrong, but maybe the user expects us to correct that. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in\". So perhaps the first line is part of the missing code. Let me see the code again. The first line after the imports is:\n\ny, x_ = input().split()\n\nBut the first line of input is n and m. So that's wrong. So the first line should be n, m = map(int, input().split()), but in the code it's stored as y and x_. So that's a mistake. So the first line is part of the missing code. So in the program1's missing code, we need to fix that line. \n\nWait, but the code after that uses block which is read as the next line. The second line of input is m integers a_1 to a_m. So the code's second line is correct. \n\nThen, the list2 is built as a sparse table for the maximum a_i. The code for building the sparse table seems okay, but maybe there's an off-by-one error. For example, the indices for the columns are 1-based or 0-based? The problem says columns are numbered from 1 to m. So the a_i for column i is stored in block[i-1]. \n\nIn the query processing part, the variables s is the list of the query's parameters. The query's input is x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f, k. Wait, the input for each query is five integers: x_s, y_s, x_f, y_f, k. So s[0] is x_s (row of start), s[1] is y_s (column of start), s[2] is x_f (row of finish), s[3] is y_f (column of finish), s[4] is k. \n\nThe code checks if the vertical difference (x_s - x_f) is divisible by k. Wait, the code uses abs(s[0] - s[2]) % s[-1] !=0. Since s[-1] is the last element, which is k. So that's correct. \n\nThen, the code computes smaller and bigger as the min and max of the columns (s[1] and s[3]). Then, the code uses a loop to find the maximum exponent for the sparse table. The code for the sparse table's query is probably correct. \n\nThe highest variable is the maximum a_i between the two columns. \n\nThe condition in the if statement is: highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]. Wait, the variable y here is from the first line, which was read as y, x_ = input().split(). But that was supposed to be n and m. So the code is using y as the first variable, which is n. So (int(y) - s[0]) would be (n - x_s). Wait, but x_s is the row of the start cell. The problem says that the start cell is unblocked, so x_s must be greater than a_{y_s}. \n\nWait, the code's condition is checking whether the maximum blocked cell in the path between the two columns is less than some value. Let me think: the robot's path must move vertically in steps of k. The vertical movement must end exactly at x_f. \n\nThe robot can move up or down, but each command is executed k times. So the total vertical displacement must be a multiple of k. Which is checked first. \n\nNow, the robot's path must not go below any blocked cells. So when moving between columns, the robot can only move horizontally, but each horizontal move is a command that moves exactly k steps. Wait, no, the robot can move in any direction, but each command is executed k times. So for example, moving right would move k columns to the right, but only if the path is possible. \n\nWait, the problem says the robot can send commands to move up, right, down, left. Each command is executed k times. So each command moves exactly k steps in that direction. \n\nSo the robot can only move in steps of k in each direction. So the path must consist of a sequence of moves, each of which is a direction, and each contributes k steps in that direction. \n\nThe key is that the robot must end exactly at the finish cell. \n\nThe vertical displacement between start and finish must be a multiple of k, and similarly for the horizontal. \n\nThe code checks that. \n\nNow, the vertical movement: the robot can move up or down. The total vertical displacement must be (x_f - x_s) which must be divisible by k. \n\nThe horizontal displacement is (y_f - y_s), which must also be divisible by k. \n\nWait, no, the horizontal displacement is (y_f - y_s) must be divisible by k? Wait, no. Because moving right or left moves in the horizontal direction. Each command moves exactly k steps. So the total horizontal displacement must be a multiple of k. \n\nWait, the horizontal displacement between start and finish columns is (y_f - y_s). So the absolute difference must be divisible by k. \n\nWait, the code checks abs(s[1] - s[3]) % s[-1] !=0. So that's correct. \n\nNow, the next part is ensuring that the path is possible. \n\nThe robot can move horizontally between columns, but when moving vertically, it can't go into blocked cells. \n\nWait, the robot's path must not go into blocked cells. So when moving vertically, the robot must stay in unblocked cells. \n\nWait, the robot can move in any direction, but each command is executed k times. So for example, moving right k times would move the robot k columns to the right. But during that movement, the robot must not step into blocked cells. \n\nWait, the problem says that if the robot attempts to move into a blocked cell or outside the grid, it explodes. So each step of the command must be valid. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nThe robot's path must consist of a sequence of commands, each of which is a direction, and each command's movement must not step into blocked cells. \n\nBut how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the robot can move in any way as long as the total displacement is correct, and the path doesn't go through blocked cells. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the robot can move in straight lines, but each command must be in a single direction. \n\nWait, the problem says the robot can send commands in any order. Each command is executed k times. So for example, the robot can first move right k steps, then up k steps, etc. \n\nThe robot's path must be such that each step of each command is valid. \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nThe approach in the code seems to be considering the vertical and horizontal displacements, and then checking the blocked cells in the columns between the start and finish. \n\nWait, the code is using the sparse table to find the maximum a_i between the start and finish columns. \n\nThe maximum a_i in that range must be less than the starting row minus some value. \n\nWait, the code's condition is: \n\nif highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]:\n\nWait, the variable y here is the first input variable, which was supposed to be n. So (int(y) is n. \n\nWait, let's parse this expression. \n\nThe term (n - s[0]) // k is the number of steps the robot can move up from the start. Because moving up k steps each time. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the robot can move vertically first, then horizontally, or some combination. \n\nAlternatively, the robot must be able to move vertically in such a way that it doesn't hit any blocked cells. \n\nWait, the robot's vertical movement must not go below any blocked cells in the columns it passes through. \n\nWait, the robot can move vertically in its current column, but when moving horizontally, it must move in steps of k columns. \n\nHmm, perhaps the robot can first move vertically to a certain row, then move horizontally, then vertically again. \n\nThe key is that when moving horizontally between columns, the robot must be at a row that is high enough so that in all the columns it passes through, the blocked cells (a_i) are below that row. \n\nWait, for example, suppose the robot is moving from column y_s to y_f. The path between them must be such that in every column between them, the blocked cells (a_i) are less than the current row. \n\nWait, but the robot can move in any direction. So perhaps the robot can first move vertically to a certain row, then move horizontally, then vertically again. \n\nThe maximum a_i in the columns between the start and finish must be less than the row the robot is at when moving horizontally. \n\nSo the robot must choose a row such that when moving horizontally between the columns, it's at a row higher than all a_i in those columns. \n\nThe vertical displacement must be such that the robot can reach the finish's row. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal required row when moving horizontally. \n\nThe code's condition is checking that the maximum a_i between the two columns is less than some value. \n\nThe expression (n - s[0]) // k gives how many steps up the robot can take. \n\nWait, let me think of the robot's path. \n\nSuppose the robot starts at (x_s, y_s). To move to (x_f, y_f), the robot can do the following steps: \n\n1. Move vertically to some row R. \n\n2. Move horizontally to the target column. \n\n3. Move vertically again to x_f. \n\nThe vertical movement must be such that the total vertical displacement is (x_f - x_s). \n\nAlternatively, the robot can move horizontally first, but that requires being at a row high enough for all columns in between. \n\nThe key is that when moving horizontally between columns, the robot must be at a row R such that for all columns between y_s and y_f, a_i < R. \n\nThe maximum a_i in that range is highest. So R must be > highest. \n\nThe robot can reach such a row R by moving up from the start. \n\nThe vertical movement must allow the robot to reach R, then move horizontally, then move down to x_f. \n\nThe total vertical displacement must be (x_f - x_s) = (R - x_s) + (x_f - R) = (x_f - x_s). \n\nWait, but the vertical movement must be in steps of k. \n\nSo the vertical movement to R must be a multiple of k steps. \n\nSimilarly, the vertical movement from R to x_f must also be a multiple of k steps. \n\nAlternatively, the total vertical displacement must be (x_f - x_s) = (R - x_s) + (x_f - R) = (x_f - x_s). \n\nBut the robot can choose R such that R is reachable via steps of k. \n\nWait, perhaps the robot can first move up as much as possible, then move horizontally, then move down. \n\nThe required R must be at least the maximum a_i in the path columns. \n\nThe robot can move up from x_s to R, which requires that (R - x_s) is a multiple of k. \n\nThen, after moving horizontally, it can move down from R to x_f, which requires (R - x_f) is a multiple of k. \n\nSo the total vertical displacement is (R - x_s) + (x_f - R) = x_f - x_s, which must be a multiple of k. \n\nWait, but the code already checks that (x_f - x_s) is divisible by k. \n\nSo the robot can choose R such that R is congruent to x_s mod k, and also congruent to x_f mod k? \n\nWait, R must be such that (R - x_s) is divisible by k, and (x_f - R) is divisible by k. \n\nWhich implies that (x_f - x_s) must be divisible by k, which is already checked. \n\nSo R can be any value such that R \u2261 x_s mod k and R \u2261 x_f mod k. \n\nBut since (x_f - x_s) is divisible by k, then R can be any value between x_s and x_f (or vice versa) that is congruent mod k. \n\nWait, but R must be at least the maximum a_i in the path columns. \n\nSo the minimal R that satisfies R >= highest and R \u2261 x_s mod k (since moving up from x_s to R must be a multiple of k steps). \n\nWait, the robot can move up or down. So R can be either higher or lower than x_s, but must be such that the path to R is possible. \n\nAlternatively, the robot can choose to move up to R, then move horizontally, then move down to x_f. \n\nThe R must be at least the maximum a_i in the columns between the start and finish. \n\nThe minimal R that is >= highest and congruent to x_s mod k (since moving up from x_s to R must be a multiple of k steps). \n\nWait, the vertical movement to R must be a multiple of k steps. So (R - x_s) must be a multiple of k (if moving up) or (x_s - R) must be a multiple of k (if moving down). \n\nBut R must be such that when moving horizontally, the robot is at R, which must be above all a_i in the path columns. \n\nSo the minimal R is the maximum between the highest a_i and (x_s + (k - (x_s - (x_s % k))) %k )? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the robot can choose R as the starting row plus some multiple of k steps up, so that R is as high as needed. \n\nThe maximum a_i in the path is highest. So R must be at least highest +1? \n\nWait, the blocked cells are the bottom a_i cells. So the unblocked cells in column i are from row a_i+1 to n. \n\nSo to move horizontally through column i, the robot must be in a row > a_i. \n\nThus, R must be > highest. \n\nWait, the maximum a_i in the path is highest. So R must be > highest. \n\nSo the robot must be able to reach a row R such that R > highest, and R is reachable via vertical steps of k. \n\nThe starting row is x_s. \n\nThe robot can move up or down. \n\nThe minimal R that is >= highest +1 and congruent to x_s mod k. \n\nWait, but moving up increases the row number (since rows are numbered from bottom to top, so higher rows are up). \n\nWait, rows are numbered from 1 (bottom) to n (top). So moving up increases the row number. \n\nSo to reach R, the robot can move up (R - x_s) steps, which must be a multiple of k. \n\nAlternatively, moving down would decrease the row, but that might not help. \n\nSo the robot can choose to move up to R, where R is at least highest +1, and (R - x_s) must be divisible by k. \n\nThe minimal such R is the smallest R >= highest +1 such that (R - x_s) mod k ==0. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible R is n. \n\nWait, but the robot can choose any R as long as it can reach it via steps of k. \n\nThe question is whether there exists an R such that: \n\nR >= highest +1 \n\nand \n\n(R - x_s) is divisible by k \n\nand \n\n(x_f - R) is divisible by k \n\nWait, because the total vertical displacement must be (x_f - x_s) = (R -x_s) + (x_f - R) \n\nSo (R -x_s) must be a multiple of k (since moving up to R requires that), and (x_f - R) must also be a multiple of k (since moving down from R to x_f requires that). \n\nWait, but (x_f - R) must be a multiple of k as well. \n\nWait, the total vertical displacement is (x_f - x_s) must be divisible by k, which is already checked. \n\nSo (R -x_s) + (x_f - R) = x_f -x_s must be divisible by k. \n\nSo the individual terms can be any multiples as long as their sum is. \n\nBut for the robot to reach R from x_s via vertical movement, (R -x_s) must be a multiple of k (if moving up) or (x_s - R) must be a multiple of k (if moving down). \n\nWait, the robot can choose to move up or down. \n\nSuppose the robot moves up to R: then R must be >= x_s, and (R -x_s) must be divisible by k. \n\nThen, moving down from R to x_f requires that (R - x_f) must be divisible by k. \n\nSo (R -x_s) mod k ==0 \n\nand (R -x_f) mod k ==0 \n\nWait, no, moving down would require that (R - x_f) is a multiple of k. \n\nWait, the vertical movement from R to x_f must be a multiple of k steps. \n\nSo (R - x_f) must be divisible by k (if moving down) or (x_f - R) must be divisible by k (if moving up). \n\nWait, the direction depends on whether R is above or below x_f. \n\nAlternatively, the robot can choose any R such that (R -x_s) is divisible by k (if moving up) or (x_s - R) divisible by k (if moving down). \n\nThen, the movement from R to x_f must also be a multiple of k steps. \n\nSo the total vertical displacement must be (x_f -x_s) = (R -x_s) + (x_f - R) \n\nWhich is okay as long as the total is divisible by k. \n\nBut the individual steps must be multiples of k. \n\nWait, perhaps the robot can choose R such that R \u2261 x_s mod k and R \u2261 x_f mod k. \n\nBut since (x_f -x_s) is divisible by k, then x_f \u2261x_s mod k. So R can be any value congruent to x_s mod k. \n\nThus, R can be any value such that R \u2261x_s mod k, and R >= highest +1. \n\nSo the question is: is there any R such that R \u2261x_s mod k, R >= highest +1, and R can be reached from x_s via vertical steps (so R is either >=x_s or <=x_s, but moving in steps of k). \n\nWait, but R can be any value as long as the difference is a multiple of k. \n\nThe minimal R that is >= highest +1 and congruent to x_s mod k. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible R is n. \n\nSo the minimal R is the smallest R >= highest +1 such that (R -x_s) is divisible by k. \n\nAlternatively, the robot can go up as much as possible, so R can be up to n. \n\nSo the condition is whether there exists an R such that R >= highest +1, and R \u2261x_s mod k, and also (x_f - R) must be divisible by k. \n\nWait, but (x_f - R) must be divisible by k because the robot has to move from R to x_f. \n\nWait, the robot can choose to move down from R to x_f, so (R -x_f) must be divisible by k. \n\nSo (R -x_f) mod k ==0 \n\n=> R \u2261x_f mod k \n\nBut since x_f \u2261x_s mod k (because their difference is divisible by k), then R must be \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nSo R must satisfy R \u2261x_s mod k, and R >= highest +1. \n\nAdditionally, R must be between x_s and x_f (or vice versa) such that the total displacement is correct. \n\nWait, but the robot can choose any R as long as the vertical steps can reach it. \n\nThe key is that there exists an R such that R \u2261x_s mod k, R >= highest +1, and (x_f -x_s) = (R -x_s) + (x_f - R) \n\nWhich is automatically true. \n\nWait, but the robot can choose R such that R is any value congruent to x_s mod k, as long as R is >= highest +1. \n\nSo the question is: is there any R such that R \u2261x_s mod k, R >= highest +1, and also R can be reached via vertical steps (so R can be any value as long as the difference from x_s is a multiple of k). \n\nWait, the robot can move up or down. So R can be any value congruent to x_s mod k, as long as it's between 1 and n. \n\nThus, the minimal R is the smallest R >= highest +1 such that R \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum R is the largest R <=n such that R \u2261x_s mod k and R >= highest +1. \n\nIf such an R exists, then the answer is yes. \n\nSo the condition is whether the minimal R (the smallest R >= highest +1 and R \u2261x_s mod k) is <=n, and also that the vertical displacement from R to x_f is possible. \n\nWait, but the vertical displacement from R to x_f must also be a multiple of k. \n\nWait, since (x_f -x_s) is divisible by k, then (R -x_s) + (x_f - R) = x_f -x_s is divisible by k. \n\nSo (x_f - R) must be congruent to (x_f -x_s) - (R -x_s) mod k. \n\nBut since (x_f -x_s) is divisible by k, then (x_f - R) must be congruent to -(R -x_s) mod k. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. \n\nThe key is that as long as there exists an R such that R \u2261x_s mod k, R >= highest +1, and R can be reached via vertical steps (so R can be any such value between 1 and n), then the answer is yes. \n\nSo the condition is whether the minimal R (the smallest R >= highest +1 and R \u2261x_s mod k) is <=n. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum between highest +1 and x_s can be adjusted. \n\nWait, the minimal R is the first R >= highest +1 where R \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nThe minimal R can be calculated as: \n\ncurrent = x_s \n\nwhile current < highest +1: \n\n    current +=k \n\nIf current exceeds n, then no. \n\nElse, yes. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal R is the smallest R >= highest +1 such that R \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nThe formula for that is: \n\nbase = x_s \n\ndelta = (highest +1 - base) \n\nif delta <=0: \n\n    then R can be base (if base >= highest+1) \n\nelse: \n\n    remainder = delta %k \n\n    if remainder ==0: \n\n        R = base + delta \n\n    else: \n\n        R = base + delta + (k - remainder) \n\nWait, but this might be overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal R is the smallest R >= highest +1 where R \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nThe minimal R can be written as: \n\nR = highest +1 + ((base - (highest +1)) %k) \n\nWait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal R is the first number >= highest +1 congruent to x_s mod k. \n\nLet me think numerically. \n\nSuppose highest is 5, x_s is 3, k is 2. \n\nThen highest +1 is 6. \n\nWe need R >=6, and R \u22613 mod 2 \u2192 R must be odd. \n\nThe smallest R is 7. \n\nBut if highest is 5, and x_s is 5, then R can be 5 (if 5 >=6? No. So 5 is less than 6, so need to go to 7. \n\nAlternatively, if highest is 4, then highest+1 is 5. \n\nx_s is 3, k=2. \n\nThen R can be 5 (since 5 mod2 is 1, but 3 mod2 is 1. So yes. \n\nSo R=5 is acceptable. \n\nSo the minimal R is the first R >= highest+1 where R \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nThe question is whether such an R exists (i.e., R <=n). \n\nSo the condition is: \n\nthe minimal R (as above) must be <=n. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum between (highest +1) and (x_s) can be adjusted. \n\nWait, but R can be any value congruent to x_s mod k, as long as it's >= highest+1 and <=n. \n\nSo the minimal R is the smallest R >= highest+1 such that R \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nThe maximum possible R is n. \n\nSo the question is whether the minimal R is <=n. \n\nThe minimal R can be computed as follows: \n\nLet required = highest +1 \n\ncurrent = x_s \n\nif current >= required and current mod k ==x_s mod k \u2192 then current is acceptable. \n\nWait, but current is x_s. \n\nWait, if x_s >= required \u2192 then R can be x_s, but only if x_s mod k is congruent to itself (which it is). \n\nWait, but required is highest+1. \n\nSo if x_s >= required \u2192 then R can be x_s, but only if x_s mod k is congruent to x_s mod k \u2192 yes. \n\nWait, but in that case, R is x_s, which is >= required. \n\nWait, but required is highest+1. \n\nSo if x_s is already >= highest+1, then R can be x_s. \n\nSo the minimal R is the minimum between x_s (if it's >= required) or the next possible R. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal R is the first R >= required where R \u2261x_s mod k. \n\nThe formula for that is: \n\ndelta = required - x_s \n\nif delta <=0 \u2192 then R = x_s (if x_s >= required) \n\nelse: \n\n    remainder = delta %k \n\n    if remainder ==0 \u2192 R = x_s + delta \n\n    else \u2192 R = x_s + delta + (k - remainder) \n\nWait, but delta is (required -x_s). \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nrequired = highest +1 \n\ncurrent = x_s \n\nif current >= required \u2192 then R = current \n\nelse: \n\n    steps_needed = ceil( (required - current) /k ) \n\n    R = current + steps_needed *k \n\n    if R >n \u2192 no \n\n    else \u2192 yes \n\nWait, that's better. \n\nSo steps_needed is the number of steps (each of k steps) needed to reach at least required. \n\nSo steps_needed = ceil( (required - current)/k ) \n\nThen R = current + steps_needed *k \n\nIf R <=n \u2192 yes \n\nElse \u2192 no \n\nSo in code, the condition is whether (current + steps_needed *k) <=n \n\nBut required is highest +1 \n\ncurrent is x_s \n\nSo required = highest +1 \n\nif x_s >= required \u2192 R =x_s \n\nelse: \n\nsteps_needed = ceil( (required -x_s)/k ) \n\nR =x_s + steps_needed *k \n\nif R >n \u2192 no \n\nelse \u2192 yes \n\nSo in code, the condition is whether such an R exists. \n\nThe code in the given program1.py has the condition: \n\nif highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]: \n\nWait, let's parse this. \n\nint(y) is n (since the first line was y, x_ = input().split() which was supposed to be n and m). \n\nSo (n - s[0]) //k \u2192 that's the number of steps up the robot can take from s[0] to n. \n\nMultiply by k \u2192 gives (n - s[0]) //k *k \u2192 which is the maximum multiple of k steps up from s[0], not exceeding n. \n\nAdding s[0] gives s[0] + ((n - s[0])//k)*k \u2192 which is the maximum R that can be reached by moving up from s[0], without exceeding n. \n\nWait, but that's the maximum possible R. \n\nThe code's condition is highest < (that value). \n\nWait, so the code is checking whether the maximum a_i in the path is less than the maximum possible R (the highest possible R achievable by moving up as much as possible). \n\nBut that's not sufficient. Because even if the maximum R is higher than highest, but the required R (highest+1) is less than that maximum R, then it's okay. \n\nWait, the code's condition is highest < (max possible R). \n\nBut the required R is highest+1. \n\nSo if the max possible R is >= highest+1 \u2192 then yes. \n\nBecause then there exists an R (like highest+1) that can be reached. \n\nWait, the maximum possible R is s[0] + ((n - s[0])//k)*k \u2192 which is the largest R <=n congruent to s[0] mod k. \n\nSo the code's condition is highest < (max R). \n\nWhich would mean that the max R is at least highest+1 \u2192 so yes. \n\nWait, because if highest < max R \u2192 then max R is at least highest+1. \n\nSo the condition is correct. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose highest is 5, and max R is 7 \u2192 then 5 <7 \u2192 yes. \n\nIf highest is 6 and max R is 7 \u2192 yes. \n\nIf highest is 7 and max R is 7 \u2192 then 7 <7 \u2192 no. \n\nWait, but in that case, the required R is highest+1 =8, which is beyond max R (7). \n\nSo the code's condition would return \"YES\" only if the max R is greater than highest. \n\nWait, but the required R is highest+1. \n\nSo the max R must be at least highest+1. \n\nThe code's condition is highest < max R \u2192 which is equivalent to max R > highest \u2192 which means that max R is at least highest+1. \n\nSo the condition is correct. \n\nThus, the code's \"if highest < ... \" is correct. \n\nBut in the else clause, the code is supposed to print \"NO\". \n\nWait, but in the code given, the else clause is a comment. \n\nWait, the code currently has: \n\nif highest < ... \u2192 print YES \n\nelse: \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nSo the missing code is to print \"NO\" in that else case. \n\nWait, but that's not all. \n\nWait, the code's condition is correct, but there's another case where even if the max R is sufficient, but the vertical displacement can't be achieved. \n\nWait, no, because the code already checked that the vertical displacement is divisible by k. \n\nWait, the code first checks that the vertical and horizontal differences are divisible by k. \n\nThen, the code checks whether the max a_i in the path is less than the maximum possible R (the highest possible R achievable by moving up from the start). \n\nIf yes \u2192 then there exists an R (like the max R) which is >= highest+1 (since max R is > highest). \n\nThus, the robot can move up to max R, then move horizontally, then move down to x_f. \n\nWait, but moving down from max R to x_f must also be possible. \n\nWait, the vertical displacement from max R to x_f must be a multiple of k. \n\nBut since the total vertical displacement (x_f -x_s) is divisible by k, and the path to R is (R -x_s) divisible by k, then (x_f - R) must also be divisible by k. \n\nBecause (x_f -x_s) = (R -x_s) + (x_f - R). \n\nSince both terms are multiples of k, their sum is also. \n\nThus, the code's condition is sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to print \"NO\" in the else clause. \n\nWait, but the code's current structure is: \n\nif highest < ... \u2192 print YES \n\nelse: \n\n    # TODO \n\nSo the missing code is to print \"NO\" there. \n\nBut also, there are other possible errors in the code. \n\nWait, the first line of the code is wrong. \n\nThe first line reads y, x_ = input().split(). \n\nBut the first line of input is n and m. \n\nSo the code should read n, m = map(int, input().split()). \n\nThus, the first line is part of the missing code. \n\nSo the missing code for program1.py includes fixing the first line. \n\nWait, the user says to output the missing lines. \n\nThe code given for program1.py starts with: \n\nimport math\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\ny, x_ = input().split()\nblock = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\nlist2 = [[0] *20 for i in range( len(block))]\nfor a in range(len(block)):\n    list2[a][0] = block[a]\n    \nz, x = 0, 1\nwhile (1 << x) <= len(block):\n    z = 0\n    while (z + (1 << x) - 1) < len(block):\n        list2[z][x] = (max(list2[z][x - 1], list2[z + (1 << (x - 1))][x - 1]))\n        z += 1\n    x += 1\n    \n \nfor i in range(int(input())):\n    s = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n    if abs(s[0] - s[2]) % s[-1] != 0 or abs(s[1] - s[3]) % s[-1] != 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        smaller = min(s[1], s[3])\n        bigger = max(s[1], s[3])\n        k = 0\n        while (1 << (k + 1)) <= bigger - smaller + 1:\n            k += 1\n        highest = max(list2[smaller - 1][k], list2[bigger - (1 << k)][k])\n        if highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the first line is wrong. The first line should be n, m = map(int, input().split()), but it's written as y, x_ = input().split(). \n\nSo the first line is part of the missing code. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1.py includes: \n\nFirst line: \n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, the block array is read as the next line (m elements). \n\nThen, in the code, the variable y was supposed to be n. \n\nWait, in the code, the line: \n\nhighest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]\n\nHere, y is the first variable from the first line, which was read as y, x_ = input().split(). \n\nBut if we fix the first line to n, m = map(int, ...), then the variable y is not defined. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nAh, right! So the code has a bug here. \n\nThe code's first line is wrong, so the variables n and m are not properly assigned. \n\nSo the first line must be fixed to read n and m. \n\nThus, the first line's missing code is to replace the first line with n, m = map(int, input().split()). \n\nThen, in the code, the variable y was used as n. \n\nWait, in the code's condition, the term (int(y) - s[0]) is using y, which was the first variable from the first line. \n\nBut after fixing the first line, y is not defined. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the original code's first line was y, x_ = input().split(). \n\nSo y is a string (since input().split() returns strings). \n\nThen, in the condition, they do int(y). \n\nBut after fixing the first line to n, m = map(int, input().split()), then the variable y is not present. \n\nSo the code's condition is using y which is not defined. \n\nThus, the code has multiple errors. \n\nThis means that the code provided has several mistakes that need to be fixed. \n\nSo the first line must be fixed to read n and m. \n\nThen, in the block array, the second line is block = [int(x) for x in input().split()]. \n\nWhich is correct, since the second line of input is m integers. \n\nThen, in the code's condition, the term (int(y) - s[0]) is using y which was the first variable from the first line. \n\nBut after fixing the first line, y is not present. \n\nSo the code's condition is using a variable that no longer exists. \n\nThus, the code's condition must be adjusted to use n instead of y. \n\nWait, the original code's first line was y, x_ = input().split(). \n\nSo y is the first number (n), stored as a string. \n\nThen, in the condition, they do int(y) to get n. \n\nSo after fixing the first line to n, m = map(int, input().split()), then the variable n is the correct value. \n\nThus, the code's condition should use n instead of y. \n\nSo the line: \n\nhighest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]\n\nShould be changed to: \n\nhighest < s[-1] * ((n - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]\n\nThus, the missing code includes fixing the first line and also replacing y with n in that condition. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nSo the first line is part of the missing code. \n\nThe code's first line is wrong, so the missing code for program1.py includes replacing the first line with n, m = map(int, input().split()). \n\nAdditionally, in the condition, the variable y is replaced with n. \n\nBut how to represent that in the code? \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nif highest < s[-1] * ((int(y) - s[0]) // s[-1]) + s[0]:\n\nThis line must be changed to use n instead of y. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1.py includes: \n\n- The first line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\n- The line in the condition: replace y with n. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output the missing code, not the entire program. \n\nHmm, the user says: \n\n\"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in. Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo the code given for program1.py has the first line wrong, and the else clause missing. \n\nThe missing parts are: \n\n1. The first line must be replaced with n, m = map(int, input().split()) \n\n2. The line with the condition must have y replaced with n. \n\n3. The else clause must print \"NO\". \n\nBut how to represent this in the code? \n\nThe user wants the missing code as a completion. \n\nThe original code's first line is: \n\ny, x_ = input().split()\n\nThe correct first line is: \n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nSo the first line is part of the missing code. \n\nThe code's condition line has a reference to y, which should be replaced with n. \n\nBut since the code is given as a string, perhaps the missing code for program1 is the first line and the else clause. \n\nWait, the code's else clause is missing the print(\"NO\"). \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is: \n\nIn the first line, replace the existing line with n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nIn the condition line, replace int(y) with n. \n\nIn the else clause, add print(\"NO\"). \n\nBut how to represent this in the JSON? \n\nThe user's instruction says to output the missing code as a completion. \n\nThe program1's code has the first line wrong, so the completion for program1 is the corrected first line. \n\nAdditionally, the code has an else clause missing the print statement. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is: \n\nThe first line should be replaced with n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, in the condition line, the part with y should be replaced with n. \n\nBut since the code is given as a string, perhaps the missing code is the first line and the else clause. \n\nAlternatively, the user might expect that the first line is part of the missing code. \n\nThe problem is that the user's given code for program1 has several errors, and the missing code must fix those. \n\nThus, the correct missing code for program1 is: \n\nThe first line is replaced with n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, in the condition line, the term (int(y) - s[0]) must be replaced with (n - s[0]). \n\nBut since the code is given as a string, perhaps the missing code is the first line and the else clause. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended that the first line is correct, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first line is correct, but the variables are named differently. \n\nWait, perhaps the first line is correct, but the variables are named y and x_, but the code later uses them as n and m. \n\nWait, the first line is y, x_ = input().split(). \n\nThen, the second line is block = [int(x) for x in input().split()]. \n\nThe second line's input is m numbers, so the first line's second variable x_ is m. \n\nThus, the code has variables y (n) and x_ (m). \n\nBut in the code, the variable n is not defined. \n\nWait, the code uses y as the first variable (n). \n\nIn the condition line, the code uses int(y) to get n. \n\nThus, the first line is correct in terms of reading the variables, but the variables are named y and x_. \n\nThus, the first line is okay, but the variables are named y and x_. \n\nThus, the first line is not part of the missing code. \n\nAh! That's possible. \n\nThe first line reads the first two numbers into y and x_, which are n and m. \n\nThen, the second line reads the block array (m elements). \n\nThus, the first line is okay, but the variables are named y and x_. \n\nThus, the first line is not part of the missing code. \n\nThen, the code's condition uses int(y) which is correct (since y is the string read from input, so converting to int gives n). \n\nThus, the first line is okay. \n\nThen, the only missing code is the else clause, which should print \"NO\". \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is to add print(\"NO\") in the else clause. \n\nSo the missing code for program1 is: \n\nIn the else clause after the if highest < ... condition, add print(\"NO\"). \n\nThus, the program1's missing code is the print(\"NO\") in the else clause. \n\nThe other parts are correct. \n\nSo the first line is okay. \n\nThe code's variables are named y (n) and x_ (m). \n\nThus, the only missing code is the else clause's print statement. \n\nSo the program1's completion is the print(\"NO\") in the else clause. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of operations to make all elements in at least one array copy equal. \n\nThe operations are: \n\n1. Clone any array. \n\n2. Swap elements between any two copies (could be the same array). \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of operations to have at least one array where all elements are equal. \n\nThe input is multiple test cases. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py is: \n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe code reads the test cases, but the loop is over the test cases. \n\nThe first line is: \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\nWait, the test cases are read as every second line starting from the second line? \n\nHmm, the input for each test case is two lines: the first line is n, then the next line is the array. \n\nThe first line of the input is t, the number of test cases. \n\nThen, for each test case, two lines: n and the array. \n\nThus, the code's approach is to read all lines from the input, then take every second line starting from index 2 (since [2::2] would be lines 2,4,6 etc. assuming 0-based). \n\nBut perhaps the code is trying to read the array lines. \n\nThe code's first line is: \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\nThis would iterate over every second line starting from the third line (since index 2 is the third line). \n\nBut the first line is t, then each test case has two lines. \n\nSo the first test case's array is on line 2, then the next test case's array is on line 4, etc. \n\nThus, the code is iterating over the array lines. \n\nThen, for each a (the array line), it splits into a list, and computes n as the length. \n\nThen, m is the maximum frequency of any element. \n\nThe code then enters a loop while m <n, and the TODO is there. \n\nThe output is r, which is initialized to 0. \n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal number of operations. \n\nThe operations are: \n\n- Clone (cost 1) \n\n- Swap elements between any two copies (cost 0, since it's free). \n\nThe goal is to have at least one copy where all elements are equal. \n\nThe minimal steps: \n\nThe key is to find the element with the maximum frequency, say m. \n\nThe minimal steps would involve: \n\n- The number of clones needed plus the swaps. \n\nBut swaps are free. \n\nThe minimal steps are determined by how many clones are needed. \n\nThe strategy is to have enough copies so that we can gather all instances of the most frequent element into one copy. \n\nSuppose the most frequent element has count m. \n\nTo have a copy with all elements equal to this element, we need to have at least m copies of the array. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, each clone increases the number of copies by 1. \n\nInitially, there is 1 copy. \n\nEach clone adds 1. \n\nThe total number of copies after c clones is 1 + c. \n\nThe swaps can move elements between any copies. \n\nTo get a single copy with all elements equal to the target element, we need to have enough copies so that the total number of target elements across all copies is at least the size of the array. \n\nThe total number of target elements is m. \n\nEach copy has some number of target elements. \n\nThe total across all copies is m * (number of copies). \n\nWait, no. \n\nEach copy is a copy of the original array. \n\nWait, when you clone, you get another copy of the current array. \n\nWait, the initial array is the original. \n\nEach clone creates a new copy of the current array. \n\nWait, no, the problem says: \n\n\"Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy of the chosen array.\" \n\nSo each clone creates a new copy of the chosen array. \n\nThus, all copies are independent except when you perform swaps. \n\nThe swaps allow you to exchange elements between any two copies. \n\nThus, the elements can be rearranged between copies. \n\nThe minimal steps: \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of clones needed plus the number of swaps? \n\nNo, swaps are free. \n\nThe cost is only the number of clones. \n\nBecause each clone costs 1, swaps are free. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of clones needed so that it's possible to have one copy with all elements equal to some value. \n\nThe key is to find the minimal number of clones required. \n\nThe optimal approach is to choose the element with the maximum frequency, say m. \n\nThe minimal number of clones needed is ceil( (n - m) / (m) ) \n\nWait, let me think. \n\nSuppose the target element has m occurrences in the original array. \n\nEach clone can give another copy with m elements. \n\nThe total number of target elements across all copies is m * (number of copies). \n\nWe need at least n target elements in one copy. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the goal is to have at least one copy where all elements are the target. \n\nTo achieve this, we can gather all the target elements from all copies into one copy. \n\nThe total number of target elements across all copies is m * c, where c is the number of copies (initial plus clones). \n\nWe need m * c >= n. \n\nBecause we can move all the target elements into one copy. \n\nThus, the minimal c such that m * c >=n. \n\nThe number of clones needed is (c -1). \n\nBecause initial copies is 1, so clones needed is c-1. \n\nThus, c is the smallest integer where m * c >=n \u2192 c = ceil(n/m). \n\nThus, the number of clones needed is ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nBut wait, the initial copy has m elements. \n\nIf m >=n \u2192 then no clones needed (since m >=n \u2192 already possible). \n\nWait, m is the maximum frequency. \n\nWait, m can't exceed n. \n\nSo if m ==n \u2192 answer is 0. \n\nElse, the minimal clones is ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nWait, let's see examples. \n\nExample 1: \n\nTest case where all elements are the same (m =n \u2192 0 clones needed. \n\nExample 2 from the note: \n\nThe array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. \n\nThe frequencies are 0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1. \n\nMax frequency is 2 (for 0 and 3). \n\nn=6. \n\nSo m=2. \n\nceil(6/2) =3 \u2192 clones needed 3-1=2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 6 operations. \n\nWait, this contradicts. \n\nWait the example's answer is 6 operations. \n\nHmm, so my reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait the example's explanation says that the answer is 6. \n\nWait, according to my formula, it would be 2 clones (since 3 copies needed, so 2 clones). \n\nBut the example's answer is 6. \n\nSo my approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I need to think again. \n\nThe example's explanation: \n\nThey first clone the array (1 operation). \n\nNow there are two copies. \n\nThen they perform swaps to move all 0's into one array. \n\nThen clone again (2nd clone), then swap again, etc. \n\nThe total operations are 6. \n\nWait, perhaps my formula is missing something. \n\nThe problem requires that the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps? \n\nNo, the problem states that the operations are: \n\nEach clone is one operation. \n\nSwaps are free. \n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is the number of clones needed. \n\nBut in the example, the answer is 6, which is higher than my formula's 2. \n\nSo my formula is wrong. \n\nHmm, so I must have misunderstood the problem. \n\nLet me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \n\nYou can do operations of two types: \n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy of the chosen array. \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. \n\nYou need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal. \n\nThe operations are counted as: each clone is one operation. Swaps are free. \n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is the number of clones needed. \n\nThe example's answer is 6, but according to my formula, it would be 2. \n\nSo there's a mistake in my reasoning. \n\nLet me look at the example: \n\nTest case 2: \n\nThe array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 2 (for 0 and 3). \n\nn=6. \n\nSo m=2. \n\nThe formula says ceil(6/2) =3 \u2192 clones needed 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 6. \n\nSo clearly my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, what's the correct approach? \n\nThe example's explanation: \n\nThey first clone the array (1 operation). \n\nNow there are two copies. \n\nThey swap elements between the two copies to move all 0's into one array. \n\nThen they clone that array (second clone, total 2 operations). \n\nThen they swap again to get more 0's. \n\nWait, the example's explanation says the answer is 6 operations. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nThe example's note says: \n\nIn the second test case, the answer is 6 operations. \n\nThe steps are: \n\n1. Clone the array (1 operation). \n\nNow two copies. \n\n2. Swap elements to get all 0's in one array. \n\n3. Clone that array (2nd clone, total 2 operations). \n\n4. Swap again to get more 0's. \n\nWait, but the example's explanation says the total is 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nLet me think differently. \n\nThe minimal number of clones needed is (required copies -1). \n\nThe required copies is the minimal number of copies such that the total number of target elements across all copies is at least n. \n\nThe total target elements is m * c, where c is the number of copies. \n\nWe need m * c >=n \u2192 c >= ceil(n/m). \n\nThus, the number of clones is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nIn the example, m=2, n=6 \u2192 ceil(6/2)=3 \u2192 clones needed 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 6. \n\nSo this suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the swaps are not free? \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\nYou can do operations of two types: \n\n1. Clone (cost 1) \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (cost 0). \n\nThus, swaps are free. \n\nThus, the example's answer must be 2, but the note says 6. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nWait, the example's note says: \n\n\"In the second test case it is possible to create a copy of the given array. After that there will be two identical arrays [...] After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array [...] Finally, we made a copy where all elements are equal and made 6 operations.\" \n\nWait, the example's explanation says that they did 6 operations. \n\nBut according to my formula, it should be 2 clones (operations). \n\nSo what's wrong here? \n\nAh! The example's explanation might be counting the number of swaps as operations, but according to the problem statement, swaps are free. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\n\"the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\" \n\nThe operations are only the clones. \n\nThe swaps are not counted. \n\nThus, the example's answer must be 2, but the note says 6. \n\nThis suggests that I misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait, the example's note says: \n\n\"In the second test case it is possible to create a copy of the given array. After that there will be two identical arrays [...] After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array [...] Finally, we made a copy where all elements are equal and made 6 operations.\" \n\nWait, the example's answer is 6, but according to the problem's description, the swaps are free. \n\nSo why are they counting 6 operations? \n\nAh! The example's explanation might be counting the number of swaps as operations. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the only operations are clones. \n\nThus, there must be a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\n\"you can do operations of two types: \n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy of the chosen array. \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. \n\nYou need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal. \n\nThe operations are counted as each clone and each swap is an operation? \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\n\"the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\" \n\nThe operations are the two types: cloning and swapping. \n\nEach clone is one operation. \n\nEach swap is also one operation. \n\nAh! That's the key. \n\nI misread the problem. \n\nThe problem says that each swap is an operation. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"You can do operations of two types: \n\n1. Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy of the chosen array. \n\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. \n\nYou need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal. \n\nThus, each swap is an operation. \n\nThus, the total operations are the number of clones plus the number of swaps. \n\nThis changes everything. \n\nThus, the problem requires minimizing the total number of operations (clones + swaps). \n\nNow, the example's answer of 6 makes sense. \n\nThe example's explanation: \n\nThey first clone (1 operation). \n\nThen they perform swaps to move all 0's into one array. \n\nThe number of swaps needed would be the number of non-0 elements in that array. \n\nWait, but how many swaps are needed? \n\nThe initial array has two 0's. \n\nAfter cloning, there are two copies. \n\nTo move all 0's into one array, you need to swap the 0's from the second copy into the first. \n\nEach 0 in the second copy can be swapped with a non-0 in the first. \n\nThere are 4 non-0 elements in the first array. \n\nTo move both 0's from the second to the first, you need two swaps. \n\nThen, the first array has 4 zeros, and the second has 0. \n\nWait, but the first array has 6 elements. \n\nWait, the initial array has two 0's. \n\nAfter cloning, each has two 0's. \n\nTo get all 4 zeros into one array, you need to swap the two 0's from the second array into the first. \n\nEach swap can move one 0. \n\nThus, two swaps. \n\nThen, the first array has 4 zeros, but needs 6. \n\nThus, you need to clone again (second clone, total 2 clones). \n\nNow there are three copies. \n\nThe third copy has two zeros. \n\nSwap those into the first array. \n\nTwo more swaps. \n\nNow the first array has 6 zeros? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, after three copies (two clones), the total zeros are 2 *3 =6. \n\nThus, you can move all 6 zeros into one array with 6 swaps (each zero from the other copies must be moved into the first array). \n\nThus, the total operations would be 2 clones + 6 swaps \u2192 total 8. \n\nBut the example's answer is 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a better way. \n\nThe example's explanation says they did 6 operations. \n\nThe example's explanation says: \n\nAfter cloning, they have two copies. \n\nThey swap elements so all zeros are in one array. \n\nThen they clone that array (second clone, total 2 operations so far). \n\nThen they swap again to get more zeros. \n\nWait, perhaps the example's explanation is not the minimal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is calculated as follows: \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (number of clones) + (number of swaps needed to gather all target elements into one array). \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in the target array. \n\nWait, let's think of the optimal approach. \n\nSuppose the target element has frequency m. \n\nThe minimal number of clones needed is c = ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThe total number of copies is c+1. \n\nThe total number of target elements is m*(c+1). \n\nWe need to gather all of them into one array. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in that array. \n\nInitially, each copy has m targets and (n-m) non-targets. \n\nAfter gathering all targets into one array, that array has m*(c+1) targets, which is exactly n. \n\nThe other arrays can have any elements. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in the target array. \n\nInitially, the target array has (n-m) non-targets. \n\nEach other copy contributes m targets and (n-m) non-targets. \n\nTo move all targets into the target array, we need to move m from each other copy. \n\nEach target from another copy requires a swap with a non-target from the target array. \n\nThus, for each of the other c copies, we need to swap m targets into the target array. \n\nEach swap can move one target in and one non-target out. \n\nThus, for each of the other c copies, we need m swaps. \n\nTotal swaps: c * m. \n\nThus, total operations: clones (c) + swaps (c*m). \n\nWait, but this may not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, the number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in the target array after all targets are moved there. \n\nThe target array must have exactly n elements, all targets. \n\nThe other arrays can have anything. \n\nThe total number of non-target elements in all copies is (n - m)*(c+1). \n\nBut after moving all targets to the target array, the non-target elements are distributed among the other arrays. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in the target array before the swaps. \n\nInitially, the target array has (n -m) non-targets. \n\nEach other copy has (n -m) non-targets. \n\nTo move all targets into the target array, we need to move m from each other copy. \n\nEach such move requires swapping a target from another copy with a non-target from the target array. \n\nEach such swap reduces the non-target count in the target array by 1 and increases the target count. \n\nTo get all m*(c) targets into the target array (since the initial has m), we need m*c targets. \n\nEach of these requires a swap with a non-target from the target array. \n\nThus, the number of swaps needed is m*c. \n\nThus, total operations: c (clones) + m*c (swaps) = c*(m+1). \n\nWait, but this may not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in the target array after all targets are moved in. \n\nThe target array must have n elements, all targets. \n\nThe total number of non-target elements in all copies is (n - m)*(c+1). \n\nAfter moving all targets into the target array, the non-target elements are distributed among the other copies. \n\nThe target array has 0 non-targets. \n\nThe other copies have their non-targets plus whatever was swapped out. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements that were in the target array initially plus the number of non-target elements that were moved out. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of swaps is the number of non-target elements in the target array after all possible swaps. \n\nTo have the target array have all targets, the number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in it initially plus the number of non-target elements that were moved in from other arrays. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of swaps is (n - m) + (number of non-targets in other arrays that are moved into the target array). \n\nThis is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps there's a better way to model this. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the minimal number of clones plus swaps needed to gather all the target elements into one array. \n\nThe minimal number of clones is c = ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is the number of non-target elements in the target array after all possible swaps. \n\nThe target array must have exactly n elements, all targets. \n\nThe total number of target elements available is m*(c+1). \n\nWe need m*(c+1) >=n \u2192 which is why c is chosen as ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nThe number of non-target elements in the target array is initially (n -m). \n\nEach swap can replace a non-target in the target array with a target from another array. \n\nEach such swap requires one operation (swap). \n\nThe number of such swaps needed is (n -m) + (number of non-targets in other arrays that are moved into the target array). \n\nWait, no. \n\nActually, to get all targets into the target array, we need to move all targets from other arrays into it. \n\nEach target from another array requires a swap with a non-target from the target array. \n\nThe number of such swaps is equal to the number of targets we need to move into the target array. \n\nThe target array initially has m targets. \n\nWe need to have n targets. \n\nThus, the number of targets to move in is n -m. \n\nEach such target requires a swap. \n\nThus, the number of swaps is (n -m). \n\nThus, total operations: c (clones) + (n -m) (swaps). \n\nWait, this makes sense. \n\nLet me test this with the example. \n\nExample 2: \n\nm=2, n=6. \n\nc = ceil(6/2) -1 \u2192 3-1=2 clones. \n\nThus, clones: 2. \n\nSwaps needed: 6-2 =4. \n\nTotal operations: 2+4=6 \u2192 which matches the example's answer. \n\nYes! \n\nThus, the formula is: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n -m) \n\nBut wait, let's see: \n\nThe number of clones is c = ceil(n/m) -1 \n\nThe number of swaps is (n -m). \n\nThus total is c + (n -m) \n\nWait, in the example: \n\nc=2, n-m=4 \u2192 total 6. \n\nAnother example: \n\nIf m =n \u2192 then c=0, swaps needed 0 \u2192 total 0. \n\nAnother example: \n\nn=5, m=3 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 c=1. \n\nSwaps needed 5-3=2 \u2192 total 3. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the formula is: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) \n\nBut this can be simplified: \n\nceil(n/m) is the minimal c+1 such that (c+1)*m >=n \u2192 c+1 = ceil(n/m). \n\nThus, the formula is: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n -m) \n\n= ceil(n/m) -1 + n -m \n\n= n -m + ceil(n/m) -1 \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to write it. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nThus, the code needs to compute this. \n\nNow, the code provided for program2.py is: \n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n        print(r)\n\nThe code reads the array lines (a is the array string). \n\nThen, n is the length of the array. \n\nm is the maximum frequency. \n\nThe loop is while m <n: \n\nBut the code is incomplete. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the formula: \n\noperations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) \n\nBut how to compute ceil(n/m) in Python. \n\nCeil(n/m) can be written as (n + m -1) // m \n\nThus, ceil(n/m) = (n + m -1) // m \n\nThus, the formula becomes: \n\noperations = ((n + m -1) // m -1) + (n -m) \n\nSimplify: \n\n= ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n -m) \n\nLet me compute this for the example: \n\nn=6, m=2 \u2192 (6+2-1)//2 =7//2=3 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 2 + (6-2)=6 \u2192 correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5, m=3 \u2192 (5+3-1)//3 =7//3=2 \u2192 2-1=1 \u2192 1 + (5-3)=3 \u2192 correct. \n\nThus, the formula is correct. \n\nThus, the code should compute this value. \n\nThe code currently has a loop while m <n: \n\nBut that's not needed. \n\nThe code should compute the formula and print it. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n        print(r)\n\nThe correct code should compute the formula and print it. \n\nThus, the missing code is to replace the loop with the formula calculation. \n\nThe code should be: \n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \n        clones = c -1\n        swaps = n -m \n        print(clones + swaps)\n\nBut the given code is structured differently. \n\nThe given code reads the input as: \n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\nThis is a way to read all the array lines. \n\nEach a is the array line. \n\nThen, a.split() gives the elements. \n\nThus, the code can be written as: \n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][1::2]: # assuming the first line is t, then each test case has two lines: n and array. \n\nWait, the input format is: \n\nFirst line: t \n\nThen for each test case: \n\n- a line with n \n\n- a line with the array \n\nThus, the array lines are every second line starting from the second line (since first line is t, then test case 1's n is line 2, array is line3, test case 2's n is line4, array line5, etc. \n\nThus, the array lines are at indices 3,5,7 etc. \n\nThus, the code's current loop is iterating over the array lines (every second line starting from index 2). \n\nThus, the code can be written as: \n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \n        clones = c-1\n        swaps = n -m \n        print(clones + swaps)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula calculation. \n\nThe original code has a loop while m <n: which is not needed. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nThe code's current line after the m is computed is: \n\nr=0 \n\nwhile m <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nprint(r) \n\nThus, the missing code is to compute the formula and print it. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \n        res = (c-1) + (n -m)\n        print(res)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula calculation. \n\nThe original code's variables are: \n\nn = len(a) \n\nm = max(Counter(a).values()) \n\nThen, the code has r=0 and a loop while m <n. \n\nThe missing code is to compute the formula and print it. \n\nThus, the completion for program2 is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nThe code's current line after m is computed is: \n\nr=0 \n\nwhile m <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nprint(r) \n\nThus, the missing code is to compute the formula and print it. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nfrom collections import*\n\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    a = a.split()\n    n = len(a)\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \n        res = (c-1) + (n -m)\n        print(res)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the part after m is computed, replacing the loop with the formula. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output the missing code as a completion. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the code that computes the formula and prints it, replacing the loop. \n\nThe original code's line after m is computed is: \n\nr=0 \n\nwhile m <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nprint(r) \n\nThe missing code is to replace this with the formula. \n\nThus, the completion for program2 is the code that calculates the formula and prints it. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the missing code for program1 and program2. \n\nFor program1, the missing code is the print(\"NO\") in the else clause. \n\nFor program2, the missing code is the part after m is computed, replacing the loop with the formula. \n\nThus, the JSON is: \n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\",\n    \"program2\": \"    if m >=n:\\n        print(0)\\n    else:\\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \\n        res = (c-1) + (n -m)\\n        print(res)\"\n}\n\nWait, but the code for program2 must be inserted into the existing code. \n\nThe existing code for program2 is: \n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n        print(r)\n\nThe missing code is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nThe code after the m is computed is: \n\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \n        res = (c-1) + (n -m)\n        print(res)\n\nThus, the completion for program2 is the code that replaces the loop and the print(r). \n\nThe original code has: \n\n    while m <n:\n        # TODO \n    print(r)\n\nThe missing code is to replace this with the if-else block. \n\nThus, the completion for program2 is the code block after m is computed. \n\nThe code for program2's completion is: \n\n    if m >=n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \n        res = (c-1) + (n -m)\n        print(res)\n\nThus, the JSON entries are: \n\nprogram1's missing code is the print(\"NO\") in the else clause. \n\nprogram2's missing code is the code block replacing the loop and print(r). \n\nThus, the final answer is: \n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\",\n    \"program2\": \"    if m >=n:\\n        print(0)\\n    else:\\n        c = (n + m -1) // m \\n        res = (c-1) + (n -m)\\n        print(res)\"\n}"
