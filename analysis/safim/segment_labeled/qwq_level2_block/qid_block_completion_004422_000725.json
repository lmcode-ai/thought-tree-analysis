To get to n x's, we need (n - c) more x's. Each swap can bring in one x from another array. Each such swap requires taking an x from another array and swapping it with a non-x in the target array. Each such swap contributes one x to the target array. So the number of swaps needed is exactly (n - c). Wait, but that's only possible if there are enough x's in other copies. Since m is chosen such that m*c >=n, so (m*c - c) > = (n -c). So yes, there are enough x's in other copies. Therefore, for a given x with count c, the total operations required would be:\n\nclones_needed = (m - 1), where m is the minimal integer such that m*c >=n.\n\nswaps_needed = (n - c)\n\nTotal operations: clones_needed + swaps_needed = (m-1) + (n - c) We need to find the minimal total over all possible x's in the array.

The answer is that minimal value. Wait, but what if c is zero? That can't happen because x must be present in the array. Since the array has elements, so for each x in the array, c is at least 1. Wait, but if the array has all elements the same, then c =n, so m=1, so total_ops is 0 + (n -n)=0, which is correct. Another example: the second test case in the problem's note. Let's see:\n\nSample Input 2 (from the note):\n\nSuppose the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. So n=6. The elements are 0,1,3,3,7,0. The frequencies are:\n\n0: 2\n\n1:1\n\n3:2\n\n7:1\n\nSo for x=0, c=2. We need m such that m*2 >=6 \u2192 m=3. So clones_needed = 3-1=2. swaps_needed =6-2=4. Total_ops: 2+4=6, which matches the sample's answer of 6. So that works. Another example: if the array has all elements the same, then c =n, so m=1, clones 0, swaps 0 \u2192 total 0. So the approach seems correct.

Another example, if n=5 and c=2 \u2192 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 ceiling is 3 \u2192 (5+2-1)/2 \u21926/2=3. So that formula works.

But if m is more than 1, then the total x's across all copies is m*c. To get all x's into one array, you need to move (m*c - c) x's from other copies into the target array. But each swap can exchange a non-x from the target array with an x from another array. \n\nEach such swap can replace one non-x in the target array with an x. So, the number of swaps needed is (n - (number of x's in the target array initially)). \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose we have m copies. The target array is one of them. The total x's across all copies is m*c. To have all x's in the target array, the target array must have n x's, and the other arrays can have the remaining (m*c - n) x's. \n\nThe initial target array has c x's. To get to n x's, we need (n - c) more x's. Each swap can bring in one x from another array. Each such swap requires taking an x from another array and swapping it with a non-x in the target array. \n\nEach such swap contributes one x to the target array. So the number of swaps needed is exactly (n - c). \n\nWait, but that's only possible if there are enough x's in other copies. Since m is chosen such that m*c >=n, so (m*c - c) >= (n -c). So yes, there are enough x's in other copies. \n\nTherefore, for a given x with count c, the total operations required would be:\n\nclones_needed = (m - 1), where m is the minimal integer such that m*c >=n.\n\nswaps_needed = (n - c)\n\nTotal operations: clones_needed + swaps_needed = (m-1) + (n - c)\n\nWe need to find the minimal total over all possible x's in the array. \n\nSo the steps for each test case would be:\n\n1. For each test case, read the array, count the frequency of each element.\n\n2. For each frequency c of each element x:\n\n   a. compute the minimal m where m*c >=n. m = ceil(n/c). \n\n   b. compute total_ops = (m-1) + (n - c)\n\n3. Find the minimal total_ops among all x's.\n\n4. The answer is that minimal value.\n\nWait, but what if c is zero? That can't happen because x must be present in the array. Since the array has elements, so for each x in the array, c is at least 1. \n\nWait, but if the array has all elements the same, then c =n, so m=1, so total_ops is 0 + (n -n)=0, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: the second test case in the problem's note. Let's see:\n\nSample Input 2 (from the note):\n\nSuppose the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. So n=6. The elements are 0,1,3,3,7,0. \n\nThe frequencies are:\n\n0: 2\n\n1:1\n\n3:2\n\n7:1\n\nSo for x=0, c=2. \n\nWe need m such that m*2 >=6 \u2192 m=3. \n\nSo clones_needed = 3-1=2. \n\nswaps_needed =6-2=4. \n\nTotal_ops: 2+4=6, which matches the sample's answer of 6. \n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother example: if the array has all elements the same, then c =n, so m=1, clones 0, swaps 0 \u2192 total 0. \n\nSo the approach seems correct. \n\nNow, the code for program1.py:\n\nWe need to process each test case. For each array, compute the frequencies, then for each frequency, compute m and the total_ops, then take the minimum. \n\nBut how to compute m? Since m is the ceiling of n/c. \n\nIn Python, ceiling can be done as (n + c -1) // c. \n\nYes, because for example, 6/2 \u2192 3 \u2192 (6+2-1)/2 \u21927//2=3. \n\nAnother example, if n=5 and c=2 \u2192 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 ceiling is 3 \u2192 (5+2-1)/2 \u21926/2=3. \n\nSo that formula works. \n\nSo the code steps for program1.py:\n\nInside the loop over each test case:\n\nRead n, then the array. \n\ncounts = Counter(array).values()\n\nmin_ops = infinity\n\nfor c in counts:\n\n    m = (n + c -1) // c \n\n    total = (m-1) + (n - c)\n\n    if total < min_ops:\n\n        min_ops = total\n\nThen print min_ops. \n\nWait, but what if the array is empty? No, n is at least 1. \n\nSo that's the code. \n\nNow, looking at the code skeleton given for program1.py:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nif True:\n    from collections import Counter\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo inside the loop for each test case, we need to read n, then the array. \n\nSo the missing code for program1.py would be:\n\nRead n, then the array. \n\nThen compute the counts, loop through each count, compute m and total, track the minimum. \n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncounts = Counter(a).values()\nmin_ops = float('inf')\nfor c in counts:\n    m = (n + c -1) // c\n    total = (m-1) + (n - c)\n    if total < min_ops:\n        min_ops = total\nprint(min_ops)\n\nSo that's the code for program1.py. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to determine which division a given rating falls into. The divisions are:\n\nDivision 1: rating >=1900\n\nDivision 2: 1600 <= rating <=1899\n\nDivision3: 1400 <= ... <=1599\n\nDivision4: <=1399\n\nThe input is t test cases, each with a rating. For each, output \"Division X\".\n\nThe code skeleton is:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][1:]:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is reading from standard input. The first line is t, then the next t lines are the ratings. \n\nThe code uses [open(0)] which reads all lines. The first line is the t, so the rest are the test cases. \n\nSo the loop is over the lines after the first. \n\nEach line is a string, so for each line in the list starting from index 1 (since [open(0)] includes all lines, including the first which is t). Wait, the code is written as for n in [*open(0)][1:], so the first element is the first line (t), but we skip it, and then the rest are the test cases. \n\nWait, the first line is t, then each test case's line is next. So the code is correct. \n\nFor each line in the lines after the first, we process the rating. \n\nThe code needs to read the integer from the line, then decide which division. \n\nSo for each line:\n\nrating = int(n.strip())\n\nthen check:\n\nif rating >=1900: division1\n\nelif 1600 <= rating <=1899 \u2192 division2\n\nelif 1400 <= ... \u2192 division3\n\nelse division4. \n\nSo code:\n\nfor line in [*open(0)][1:]:\n    rating = int(line.strip())\n    if rating >=1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif 1600 <= rating <=1899:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif 1400 <= rating <=1599:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nAlternatively, the order can be checked from highest to lowest. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is the code inside the for loop. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the missing parts for each program. \n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the part inside the for _ in ... loop. \n\nThe original code skeleton for program1.py has:\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code to fill is:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncounts = Counter(a).values()\nmin_ops = float('inf')\nfor c in counts:\n    m = (n + c -1) // c\n    total = (m-1) + (n - c)\n    if total < min_ops:\n        min_ops = total\nprint(min_ops)\n\nFor program2.py, the code inside the for loop over the lines is:\n\nrating = int(line.strip())\nif rating >=1900:\n    print(\"Division 1\")\nelif 1600 <= rating <=1899:\n    print(\"Division 2\")\nelif 1400 <= rating <=1599:\n    print(\"Division 3\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Division 4\")\n\nWait, but the code in program2.py's skeleton is:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][1:]:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the variable 'n' here is each line (as a string). So the code would need to process that line. \n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nline = n.strip()\nrating = int(line)\nthen the checks. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nfor line in [*open(0)][1:]:\n    rating = int(line)\n    ... \n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nrating = int(line.strip())\nif ... \n\nWait, but in the code skeleton, the loop variable is named 'n', which is each line. So the code would be:\n\nfor n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n    rating = int(n.strip())\n    if ... \n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nrating = int(n.strip())\nif rating >=1900:\n    print(\"Division 1\")\nelif 1600 <= rating <=1899:\n    print(\"Division 2\")\nelif 1400 <= rating <=1599:\n    print(\"Division 3\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Division 4\")\n\nSo putting all together, the JSON should have the two code blocks as strings. \n\nNow, the user wants the output to be a JSON with \"program1\" and \"program2\" keys, each with the completion strings. \n\nSo the program1's completion is the code inside the for loop of the test cases. \n\nThe program2's completion is the code inside the for loop over the lines. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"n = int(input())\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ncounts = Counter(a).values()\\nmin_ops = float('inf')\\nfor c in counts:\\n    m = (n + c -1) // c\\n    total = (m-1) + (n - c)\\n    if total < min_ops:\\n        min_ops = total\\nprint(min_ops)\",\n    \"program2\": \"rating = int(n.strip())\\nif rating >=1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif 1600 <= rating <=1899:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif 1400 <= rating <=1599:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n}\n\nWait, but in the program2 code, the variable is 'n' (the loop variable). So the code uses 'n' as the line. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nI need to make sure that the code is properly indented and uses the correct variables. \n\nAlso, in the program1 code, the Counter is imported, so that's okay. \n\nYes, the code should work."
