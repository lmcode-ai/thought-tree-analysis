So if a and b cross again with a higher total, it would be okay, but if they cross again with a lower total, it would set ans to a lower value. So the code is incorrect here.

Therefore, the code needs to be adjusted here. Wait, but the problem is that the code's current structure may not account for this. Hmm, but the user's code is given as:\n\nThe code in program1.py has a loop, and inside the else clause (when a <= b), the code is missing.

But the problem is that ans is being set each time, not taking the maximum. So the code's ans is being overwritten each time a and b are equal, which might not give the maximum. So to fix that, the code should set ans to the maximum between the current ans and the new value. Therefore, the line should be:\n\nif a == b:\n    current = l + (n - h -1)\n    ans = max(ans, current) But in the code, it's written as:\n\nif(a==b):\n    ans=l+n-h-1 So that's a problem.

The minimal moves would be achieved by setting each b_i to the smallest possible value that is a multiple of a_i and greater than b_{i-1}. Wait, but since it has to be strictly increasing, b_i must be > b_{i-1}. So for each i, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. The moves required for this b_i is (b_i)/a_i, since starting from 0. So the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize b[0] as the smallest multiple of a[0] that is >=0 (which is 0). Then for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nb[i] must be the smallest multiple of a[i] such that b[i] > b[i-1]. The minimal such b[i] is ceil( (b[i-1] +1)/a[i] ) * a[i].

This suggests that the problem requires dynamic programming or some other approach. Alternatively, the minimal moves can be computed by greedily choosing the smallest possible b[i] at each step. Let me try this approach with the first example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]. We want to find the minimal moves. The example's solution is [-1,0,3,4,5], with moves 1 (for first element: -1 \u2192 1 move), 0 (second element 0 \u2192 0 moves), 3/3=1 move (third), 4/4=1, 5/5=1 \u2192 total 4 moves.

Hmm, so the greedy approach gives the same result. Another example: \n\nExample 2 from the problem's note:\n\nInput n=7, a = [3,2,1,4,5,6,7]. The example's solution requires 10 moves. Using the greedy approach:\n\nb[0] =0 (a=3 \u2192 0 is allowed). b[1] must be >0. The smallest multiple of 2 is 2 \u2192 moves +=1. \n\nb[2] must be >2 \u2192 smallest multiple of 1 is 3 \u2192 moves +=3 (3/1). b[3] must be >3 \u2192 smallest multiple of4 is4 \u2192 moves +=1. b[4] must be>4 \u21925 \u2192 moves +=1 (5/5). b[5] must be>5 \u21926 \u2192 moves +=1 (6/6). b[6] must be>6 \u21927 \u2192 moves +=1 (7/7).

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is about Alice and Bob eating candies such that their total weights are equal, and we need to maximize the total number of candies they eat. The given code has a loop where they are trying to adjust how much each eats. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe code initializes l and h as the left and right pointers. a and b are the sums for Alice and Bob. The loop runs while l <= h. Inside, if a > b, Bob takes the next right candy (h decreases, b increases). Else, the code is missing here. The idea is probably that when a <= b, Alice takes the next left candy (so l increases, a increases). Then, whenever a equals b, we calculate the current total candies eaten (l + (n - h) - 1? Wait, maybe the ans is being updated here. Wait, the current code's ans is set to l + (n - h -1). Let me think: the number of candies Alice has eaten is l (since starting from 0, each step l increments by 1?), and Bob has eaten (n - h -1) because h is the current right index. So total is l + (n - h) but maybe the formula is l + (n - h) -1? Not sure, but the code's current line is ans = l + n - h -1. Hmm.\n\nThe problem is in the else clause where a <= b. The code should add the current left candy to a, then move l forward. So the missing code would be something like:\n\na += l1[l]\nl += 1\n\nThen, after each step, check if a == b and update the answer. But the current code's ans is being set each time a and b are equal. However, maybe the code is not tracking the maximum correctly. Because the current code's ans is overwritten each time a and b are equal, but maybe we need to track the maximum possible. Wait, the problem requires the maximum number of candies. So whenever a and b are equal, the current total is l (number of candies Alice has taken, since she starts at 0 and increments l each time) plus (n - h -1) (since Bob has taken from h+1 to end). Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the initial l is 0, h is n-1. So when Alice takes the first candy (l increments to 1), Bob hasn't taken any yet (h is still n-1, so he hasn't taken anything). Wait, no. Let me think again. The code's variables:\n\nInitially, l is 0, h is n-1. The a and b start at 0. The loop runs while l <= h. \n\nIn each iteration, if a > b, then Bob takes the h-th element (so adds l1[h] to b, then h decreases by 1. So Bob's count is (n - h -1) because h is now at h-1, so the number of candies he has taken is (original h - current h) = 1, etc. \n\nIn the else clause (a <= b), Alice takes the l-th element (so adds l1[l] to a, then l increases by 1. So the number of candies Alice has taken is l (since starting from 0, each step l increments by 1). \n\nSo when a and b are equal, the total is (l) + (n - h -1) because Bob has taken (n - h -1) candies (since h is the current index, so the number of candies Bob has taken is (original h - current h) = (n-1 - h) +1? Wait, maybe the formula is l (Alice's count) plus (n - h) (since Bob has taken from h+1 to the end, which is n - h elements). Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose h is at position h. The number of candies Bob has taken is (n -1 - h) +1? Because from h+1 to n-1 is (n-1 - (h+1) +1) = n - h -1. So when h is at current position, the number of candies Bob has taken is (n -1 - h) +1? Wait, no. Let me think of an example. Suppose n=3, and h is 1 (so the rightmost element is index 2, but h is 1, so Bob hasn't taken that yet. Wait, maybe the initial h is n-1 (the last element). So when Bob takes the h element, he subtracts 1 from h. So the number of candies Bob has taken is (original h - current h) = (n-1 - h) +1? Because each time he takes one. So the total is (n-1 - h) +1? So the total is (n - h). \n\nWait, for example, if h starts at 2 (n=3), and after taking once, h becomes 1. So he took 1 candy (the 2nd index). So the count is 1, which is (2 -1) +1? 2-1 is 1, plus 1 gives 2? No. Hmm, maybe the count is (original h - current h). Because each step, h decreases by 1. So the number of steps Bob has taken is (original h - current h). So the total candies Bob has taken is (original h - current h). \n\nWait, original h is n-1. So when h is now h, the number of candies Bob has taken is (n-1 - h). \n\nSo the total candies Alice has taken is l (since she starts at 0, and each step l increases by 1). Bob's is (n-1 - h). \n\nSo the total is l + (n-1 - h). \n\nWait, in the code's current line, ans = l + n - h -1. Let me see: l + (n-1 - h) = l + n -1 -h. Which is the same as the code's expression. So that part is okay. \n\nBut the problem is in the else clause. The code's else clause is where a <= b, so Alice takes the next left candy. So the missing code is:\n\na += l1[l]\nl +=1\n\nSo that's the first part. \n\nNow, the code's loop continues until l <= h. But when a and b are equal, the code updates ans each time. However, the maximum might be the maximum of all such possibilities. But the current code's ans is being set each time a == b, so it might not track the maximum. Wait, the code initializes ans as 0. Then, whenever a == b, it sets ans to the current value. So if a and b cross each other multiple times, the last time they are equal would be the ans. But that might not be the maximum. \n\nWait, for example, suppose in some step, a and b are equal, giving a total of 5, then later they become equal again with a total of 3. The code would set ans to 3, which is worse. So the code is incorrect here. \n\nHmm, so the code's logic is flawed. The current approach may not track the maximum. \n\nWait, the problem requires the maximum number of candies they can eat while their sums are equal. So whenever a and b are equal, we need to record the current total (l + (n-1 - h)), and keep the maximum of all such values. \n\nThe current code's ans is being overwritten each time a and b are equal, so it might not capture the maximum. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified to track the maximum. \n\nWait, looking at the code again:\n\nInitially ans is 0. \n\nInside the loop, whenever a == b, ans is set to l + n - h -1. \n\nBut this would overwrite the previous value. So if a and b cross again with a higher total, it would be okay, but if they cross again with a lower total, it would set ans to a lower value. \n\nSo the code is incorrect here. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach would be to compute the maximum between the current ans and the new value. \n\nSo the line should be:\n\nif a == b:\n    current_total = l + (n -1 - h)\n    ans = max(ans, current_total)\n\nBut in the given code, the line is:\n\nif(a==b):\n    ans=l+n-h-1\n\nSo that's a problem. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to be adjusted here. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the code's current structure may not account for this. \n\nHmm, but the user's code is given as:\n\nThe code in program1.py has a loop, and inside the else clause (when a <= b), the code is missing. So the first step is to fill in the missing code in the else clause. \n\nThe missing code in the else clause (when a <= b) is adding the current left candy to a, then moving l forward. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nelse:\n    a += l1[l]\n    l += 1\n\nThen, after that, check if a == b and update the ans. \n\nWait, but the code's current structure has the 'if a == b' check inside the loop. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nwhile(l<=h):\n    if(a > b):\n        b += l1[h]\n        h -=1\n    else:\n        # add a's part here\n    if(a == b):\n        ans = l + n - h -1\n\nWait, the 'if a == b' is after the if-else. So after either adding to a or b, check if they are equal. \n\nSo after adding to a (in the else clause), then check if a == b. \n\nSo the code's structure is okay in that sense. \n\nBut the problem is that ans is being set each time, not taking the maximum. \n\nSo the code's ans is being overwritten each time a and b are equal, which might not give the maximum. \n\nSo to fix that, the code should set ans to the maximum between the current ans and the new value. \n\nTherefore, the line should be:\n\nif a == b:\n    current = l + (n - h -1)\n    ans = max(ans, current)\n\nBut in the code, it's written as:\n\nif(a==b):\n    ans=l+n-h-1\n\nSo that's a problem. \n\nTherefore, the code is incorrect here. \n\nBut the user's problem is to fill in the missing code in the else clause. The rest of the code may have issues, but perhaps the problem expects us to fix only the missing parts. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Output only the missing code so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py' runs correctly.\" So perhaps the code's other parts are correct except for the missing lines. \n\nWait, the problem's sample input 1:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1 1\n\nSample Output is 2. \n\nLet me see how the code would handle that. \n\nTest case 1: n=2, weights [1,1]\n\nInitially l=0, h=1. a=0, b=0. \n\nFirst iteration: since a <= b (0 <=0), enter else clause. \n\nAdd l1[0] (1) to a \u2192 a becomes 1. l becomes 1. \n\nNow check if a == b (1 vs 0 \u2192 no). \n\nNext, loop continues. Now l is 1, h is 1. \n\nCheck a (1) vs b (0). Since a > b, so add l1[1] (1) to b \u2192 b becomes 1. h becomes 0. \n\nNow check a == b (1 ==1 \u2192 yes). \n\nans is set to l (1) + n (2) - h (0) -1 \u2192 1 +2 -0 -1 = 2. \n\nThen loop continues? Because l (1) <= h (0) \u2192 no. So loop ends. \n\nSo the answer is 2, which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: second sample input where the answer is 6. Let's see. \n\nSample Input 2: \n\n3\n\n6\n\n1 2 4 3 2 3 \n\nWait, the sample says the second test case's answer is 6. \n\nWait, the sample input for the second case is n=6, and the weights are such that Alice takes first 3 (sum 1+2+4=7), Bob takes last 3 (3+2+3=8? Wait no, the sample says 7 each. Wait the example says the third test case's input is [1,2,3,4,5], but maybe the second case's input is different. \n\nBut perhaps the code works correctly for the first sample. \n\nThe problem with the code is that when a and b cross again, the ans is overwritten. \n\nSuppose in a scenario where the first time a and b are equal gives a total of 5, then later they become equal again with a total of 6. The code would set ans to 6, which is correct. \n\nBut if they first reach 6, then later reach 5, the code would set ans to 5, which is worse. \n\nHmm, so the code's current approach may not capture the maximum. \n\nWait, but the code's ans is initialized to 0. So if the first time they are equal gives 2, then later a higher value, it would set ans to the higher. But if the first time is higher, then later a lower, it would overwrite. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the problem requires that the code is written in a way that the ans is correctly tracked. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's logic is correct. Let me think again. \n\nThe loop proceeds in a way that Alice and Bob take turns adding to their sums. The process is such that they are trying to balance the sums. \n\nWait, the approach is similar to a two-pointer approach where Alice takes from the left and Bob from the right, and they adjust their sums. \n\nThe idea is that whenever a is less than or equal to b, Alice takes the next left candy. Otherwise, Bob takes the next right. \n\nThis way, the sums are kept as balanced as possible. \n\nAt each step where a equals b, the current total is considered. \n\nBut the maximum possible is the maximum of all such points where a equals b. \n\nThe code's current approach may not track the maximum, but perhaps the way the loop proceeds ensures that the last time a and b are equal is the maximum possible. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the process is such that the total candies eaten increases as the pointers move inward. So the last time a and b are equal would have the maximum possible total. \n\nIs that the case? \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the candies are [3, 1, 1, 3]. \n\nThe optimal is Alice takes first 3 (sum 3), Bob takes last 3 (sum 3). Total 2. \n\nAlternatively, if Alice takes first 3 and 1 (sum 4), Bob takes last 3 (sum 3). Not equal. \n\nAlternatively, Alice takes first 3, Bob takes last two (sum 1+3=4). Not equal. \n\nAnother scenario: \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 1]. \n\nThe process would be:\n\nInitially a=0, b=0. \n\nSince a <= b, Alice takes first 1 \u2192 a=1, l=1. \n\nNow a (1) vs b (0). Since a > b, Bob takes last 1 \u2192 b=1, h=2. \n\nNow a and b are equal (1 each). The total is l (1) + (4 - h (2) -1) \u2192 1 + (4-2-1) \u2192 1+1=2. \n\nThen, next iteration: l=1, h=2. \n\nCheck a (1) vs b (1). So Alice takes next (3). a becomes 4, l=2. \n\nNow a (4) > b (1). So Bob takes h=2 (3). b becomes 4, h=1. \n\nNow check a == b (4 ==4). The total is l (2) + (4 - h (1) -1) \u2192 2 + (4-1-1) \u2192 2+2=4. \n\nNow l=2 and h=1 \u2192 loop ends. \n\nSo the ans would be 4, which is correct. \n\nIn this case, the code would set ans to 2 first, then to 4. So the code's approach of overwriting ans each time works here. \n\nAnother example where the maximum is not the last occurrence. \n\nSuppose the array is [2, 2, 2, 2]. \n\nPossible steps:\n\nInitially a=0, b=0. \n\nAlice takes first 2 \u2192 a=2, l=1. \n\nNow a (2) vs b (0). Bob takes last 2 \u2192 b=2, h=2. \n\nNow a and b equal \u2192 total is 1 + (4-2-1) \u2192 1 +1=2. \n\nNext step: l=1, h=2. \n\na and b are equal (2 each). \n\nNow, since a <= b, Alice takes next (2 \u2192 a becomes 4, l=2). \n\nNow a (4) > b (2). Bob takes h=2 (2 \u2192 b becomes 4, h=1. \n\nNow a and b are equal (4 each). The total is l=2 + (4-1-1) \u2192 2 +2=4. \n\nSo the code would set ans to 4, which is correct. \n\nAnother scenario where the maximum is in the middle. \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 1, 3, 3]. \n\nThe process:\n\nStart with a=0, b=0. \n\nAlice takes first 1 \u2192 a=1, l=1. \n\na (1) vs b (0). Bob takes last 3 \u2192 b=3, h=2. \n\nNow a (1) < b (3). Alice takes next 1 \u2192 a=2, l=2. \n\nNow a (2) < b (3). Alice takes next (3 \u2192 a=5, l=3. \n\nNow l=3, h=2 \u2192 loop ends. \n\nWait, but in this case, the only time a and b were equal was at the first step (0 and 0?), but the initial a and b were 0, so the first step would have set ans to 0+0? \n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nInitial step: l=0, h=3 (since n=4). \n\nFirst iteration:\n\na=0, b=0 \u2192 enter else clause (a <= b). \n\nAdd l1[0] (1) to a \u2192 a=1, l=1. \n\nThen check if a == b (1 vs 0 \u2192 no). \n\nNext iteration: l=1, h=3. \n\na=1 vs b=0 \u2192 a > b? No, 1>0 \u2192 yes? Wait, a is 1, b is 0 \u2192 a > b \u2192 so Bob takes h=3 (3 \u2192 b becomes 3, h becomes 2. \n\nNow check a (1) vs b (3). \n\nNow, since a (1) < b (3), Alice takes next (l=1 \u2192 the second element (1). \n\nWait, the next step is the loop continues. \n\nWait, after Bob takes the 3 (h becomes 2), the next iteration is l=1, h=2. \n\nNow a is 1, b is 3. \n\nSince a < b \u2192 Alice takes next (l=1's element, which is 1 \u2192 a becomes 2, l becomes 2. \n\nCheck a (2) vs b (3). Still a < b \u2192 Alice takes next (element 2 (3?), since l is now 2. \n\nWait, the array is [1,1,3,3]. \n\nAfter Alice takes the first 1 (l=1), then after Bob takes the last 3 (h becomes 2), the next step is l=1, h=2. \n\nAlice takes the next (element at index 1, which is 1 \u2192 a becomes 1+1=2, l becomes 2. \n\nNow a=2 vs b=3 \u2192 a < b \u2192 Alice takes next (element at index 2 (3 \u2192 a becomes 5, l=3. \n\nNow l=3, h=2 \u2192 loop ends. \n\nThe only time a and b were equal was at the start (0 and 0 \u2192 ans would be 0+ (4-3 -1) \u2192 0 + (0) \u2192 0? Or initial step? \n\nWait, the initial a and b are 0 and 0. \n\nIn the first iteration, after adding the first candy (a becomes 1), the check after the if-else is whether a == b (1 vs 0 \u2192 no). \n\nSo the initial a and b were 0 and 0, but the code didn't check that before the first step. \n\nWait, the loop starts with l=0 and h = n-1. \n\nThe first step is:\n\nInside the loop, the first check is a > b (0 vs 0 \u2192 no). So enter else clause. \n\nAdd the first element (1) to a \u2192 a becomes 1, l becomes 1. \n\nThen check if a == b (1 vs 0 \u2192 no). \n\nSo the initial a and b being equal (0 and 0) is not considered. \n\nHmm, so the code's initial ans is 0, but the first time a and b are equal is when they are both zero, but the code doesn't account for that. \n\nWait, the problem requires that they eat some candies. So if they eat zero, that's allowed? The output specification says to print 0 if there's no way. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total while satisfying the condition\". The condition is that their total weights are equal. \n\nIf they eat zero candies, their sums are zero, so that's valid. But the problem's sample input 3 has an output of 0 because there's no way to have a non-zero sum. \n\nWait, but in the first test case, the sample output is 2, which is better than 0. \n\nSo the code's initial ans is 0, which would be correct if there's no other possibility. \n\nBut in the case where the entire array can be split such that a and b are equal, but the code's approach might miss the maximum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's logic is correct, and the missing part is just the else clause. \n\nSo the missing code in the else clause is:\n\na += l1[l]\nl +=1\n\nSo that's the first part. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing, where each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. \n\nThe code given is trying to find the minimal moves. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be trying all possible starting points (the for loop over i in range(len(a))). For each i, it sets t as an array, and then calculates the required moves for the elements before and after i. \n\nWait, the code's structure is a bit unclear. Let me read the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires that the array b is strictly increasing. Each b_i can be adjusted by adding or subtracting multiples of a_i. \n\nThe minimal number of moves is the sum of the absolute changes divided by a_i (since each move adds or subtracts a_i once). \n\nWait, each move for b_i can add or subtract a_i once. So the number of moves needed to reach a certain value is the absolute difference between the target and the initial (which is zero) divided by a_i. Because each move contributes \u00b1a_i. \n\nWait, the initial b_i is zero. To reach a target value x, the minimal moves are |x| / a_i, but only if x is a multiple of a_i. Because each move adds or subtracts a_i. So the minimal steps are ceil(|x| / a_i). Wait, no. \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach x from 0 is exactly |x| / a_i, but only if x is a multiple of a_i. Otherwise, it's impossible. But since the problem allows any moves, but the target must be such that x is a multiple of a_i? \n\nWait, no. Because each move adds or subtracts a_i. So the total change must be a multiple of a_i. So the target b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, the problem says \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\" So each move changes b_i by \u00b1a_i. So the final b_i must be equal to the initial (0) plus some multiple of a_i. So b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nTherefore, the problem requires that the array b is strictly increasing, and each b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nThe minimal number of moves is the sum over all i of |b_i| / a_i. \n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing b_i such that:\n\nb_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n,\n\neach b_i is a multiple of a_i,\n\nand the sum of |b_i| / a_i is minimized. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be trying to fix a certain position (i) and compute the required moves for the elements before and after. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe outer loop is for i in range(len(a)). \n\nThen, for each i, it initializes t (maybe the current b array?), but perhaps it's not needed. \n\nThe code initializes temp as 0. \n\nThen, for the elements before i (j from i-1 down to 0), it calculates some x. \n\nThe code for the j loop (before i):\n\nprev is the previous b's value. \n\nx is ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] )\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nHmm, perhaps this is to ensure that b[j] < prev (the next element's b). \n\nWait, the idea is that for each position j before i, we need to choose b[j] such that it is less than b[j+1], and also as small as possible to minimize the moves. \n\nWait, let's think of the process for the elements before i. \n\nSuppose we are fixing the current position i, and for the elements before i, we need to set their b values in a way that they form an increasing sequence up to the current i's value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each possible i as the \"pivot\" point, and then compute the minimal moves for the left and right parts. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is similar to dynamic programming, where for each position i, we compute the minimal moves required for the first i elements, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute for each possible i as the \"current\" position, and then compute the required moves for the left and right parts. \n\nLooking at the code's first part (for the elements before i):\n\nprev starts at 0 (since initially, before the first element, there's nothing). \n\nWait, the code's j starts at i-1 and goes down to 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing the elements in reverse order. \n\nWait, let me think of the elements before i. \n\nSuppose we are processing the elements from i-1 down to 0. \n\nFor each j (starting from i-1 down to 0), we need to choose b[j] such that it is less than b[j+1], and also as small as possible. \n\nWait, but the code's approach for the left part (elements before i) is:\n\nprev is the value of b[j+1]. \n\nWe need to choose b[j] such that b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nThe minimal possible b[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than b[j+1]. \n\nWait, but to minimize the moves, we want b[j] to be as large as possible (but still less than b[j+1]). \n\nWait, the minimal moves would be achieved by choosing the largest possible b[j] that is less than b[j+1], and a multiple of a[j]. \n\nSo the maximum possible b[j] is floor( (b[j+1] -1)/a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nSuppose b[j+1] is known. \n\nWe need b[j] < b[j+1], and b[j] must be a multiple of a[j]. \n\nThe largest possible b[j] is the maximum multiple of a[j] less than b[j+1]. \n\nSo that would be ( (b[j+1] -1) // a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nThe required moves for this b[j] is ( (b[j+1] -1) // a[j] ) * a[j] / a[j] \u2192 ( (b[j+1] -1) // a[j] ). \n\nWait, but the code uses ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] ), which may not be the same. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose prev is the value of b[j+1]. \n\nWe need b[j] < prev. \n\nThe maximum possible b[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] less than prev. \n\nLet me denote that as m = floor( (prev-1)/a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nThe required moves for this is |m| / a[j] \u2192 since m is the target. \n\nBut since the initial b[j] is 0, the moves are |m| / a[j]. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves would be to choose the largest possible b[j] less than prev, so that the moves are minimized. \n\nWait, but the code's approach is to compute x = ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] ), then set prev = a[j] *x. \n\nWait, that seems to be going in the opposite direction. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal required b[j] such that b[j] < b[j+1], but in a way that the moves are minimized. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal required moves for the left side. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose a[j] is 2, and prev (b[j+1]) is 3. \n\nWe need b[j] <3. \n\nThe largest multiple of 2 less than 3 is 2. \n\nThe moves needed are 2/2 =1. \n\nThe code's calculation would be:\n\nprev is 3 (from the next element). \n\nx = ceil( (3 +1)/2 ) \u2192 ceil(4/2)=2. \n\nprev becomes 2*2=4. \n\nWait, but that's larger than prev (3). That can't be right. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal required b[j] such that b[j] < b[j+1], but in a way that the moves are minimized. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal possible b[j] such that it is as large as possible but still less than b[j+1]. \n\nWait, the code's approach for the left part (elements before i) is:\n\nprev starts at 0 (for the first element in the left processing). \n\nWait, no. Let me see the code again. \n\nThe code for the left part (elements before i):\n\nprev is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, no. Looking at the code:\n\nprev is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, the code's code for the left part:\n\nprev =0 \n\nWait, no. Let me look again. \n\nThe code's code:\n\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n\n    t=[0]*n\n\n    temp=0\n\n    j=i-1\n\n    prev =0 \n\n    while j>=0:\n\n        x=ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] )\n\n        temp +=x \n\n        prev = a[j] *x \n\n        j -=1 \n\nWait, so for the left part (elements before i), the code starts with prev=0. \n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because for the first element (the leftmost element), the previous element (non-existent) would have to be less than it. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing the elements in reverse order. \n\nWait, the code is processing the elements from i-1 down to 0. \n\nSuppose i is the current pivot. \n\nThe first element processed in the left loop is j = i-1. \n\nprev is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, but that would mean that for the first element (j = i-1), the next element (j+1) is i, which hasn't been processed yet. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to set the current i's b value to 0, and then compute the required values for the left and right parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to set the current i's b value to some value, and then compute the required moves for the left and right parts. \n\nWait, the code's outer loop is for each i in range(len(a)), which might be trying to set the i-th element as the starting point. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each possible i as the \"current\" position, and then compute the minimal moves for the left and right parts. \n\nThe code's approach for the left part (elements before i) is:\n\nprev starts at 0. \n\nThen, for each j from i-1 down to 0:\n\nWe need to choose b[j] such that b[j] < prev (the next element's b value). \n\nWait, but prev is the value of b[j+1], which is being computed in reverse. \n\nWait, the code's logic for the left part is:\n\nWe start with prev =0 (the value of b[i], since we are processing elements before i). \n\nWait, no. Let me think step by step. \n\nSuppose i is fixed. \n\nThe code is trying to compute the minimal moves for the left part (elements before i) and the right part (elements after i). \n\nThe left part is processed from j = i-1 down to 0. \n\nFor each j, the next element (j+1) has a b value of prev. \n\nWe need to choose b[j] such that b[j] < prev. \n\nThe minimal moves would be to choose the largest possible b[j] that is less than prev and a multiple of a[j]. \n\nThe largest such b[j] is floor( (prev-1)/a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nThe required moves are (b[j] -0)/a[j] \u2192 since we start from 0. \n\nWait, but the code is doing:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose prev is the value of b[j+1]. \n\nWe need b[j] < prev. \n\nThe maximum possible b[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] less than prev. \n\nLet me compute that as m = ( (prev-1) // a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nThe required moves are m / a[j]. \n\nBut the code is using x = ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] ), then prev becomes a[j] *x. \n\nWait, that would give a value larger than prev. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal required b[j] such that b[j] < b[j+1], but in a way that the moves are minimized. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal possible b[j] such that it is as large as possible but still less than b[j+1]. \n\nWait, the code's x is ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] ), which would give the smallest multiple of a[j] that is greater than or equal to (prev+1)/a[j]. \n\nWait, let's see with an example. \n\nSuppose a[j] is 2, and prev (b[j+1]) is 3. \n\nThen (prev+1)/a[j] = (3+1)/2 = 2 \u2192 ceil(2) is 2. \n\nx is 2 \u2192 so b[j] = 2 *2 =4? \n\nBut that's larger than prev (3), which violates the condition. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code's approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal required b[j] such that b[j] < b[j+1], but in a way that the moves are minimized. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal possible b[j] such that it is as large as possible but still less than b[j+1]. \n\nWait, the correct approach for the left part is:\n\nFor each j from i-1 down to 0:\n\nWe need b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nThe minimal moves for b[j] is achieved by setting it to the largest possible multiple of a[j] that is less than b[j+1]. \n\nThe required moves are (b[j] -0)/a[j] = b[j]/a[j]. \n\nThe largest possible b[j] is floor( (b[j+1] -1)/a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nSo the moves would be ( (b[j+1] -1) // a[j] ) \n\nBut the code is doing:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[j] )\n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nWait, this seems to be the opposite. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal required b[j] such that b[j] < b[j+1], but in a way that the moves are minimized. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal required b[j] such that b[j] is as small as possible but still allows the next elements to be larger. \n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. \n\nThe problem requires that the array is strictly increasing. \n\nThe minimal moves would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible b array that is strictly increasing and each b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nThe approach is to process the array from left to right, ensuring that each b_i is at least b_{i-1} +1, and also a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, that makes sense. \n\nLet me think of the optimal approach. \n\nThe minimal moves would be achieved by setting each b_i to the smallest possible value that is a multiple of a_i and greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but since it has to be strictly increasing, b_i must be > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo for each i, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nThe moves required for this b_i is (b_i)/a_i, since starting from 0. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize b[0] as the smallest multiple of a[0] that is >=0 (which is 0). \n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nb[i] must be the smallest multiple of a[i] such that b[i] > b[i-1]. \n\nThe minimal such b[i] is ceil( (b[i-1] +1)/a[i] ) * a[i]. \n\nThe moves for this step are (b[i]/a[i]). \n\nThe total moves is the sum of all these. \n\nWait, but this would give the minimal moves. \n\nWait, let's see an example. \n\nExample 1 from the problem's note:\n\nInput: n=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nThe desired b array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nWait, but according to the algorithm:\n\nb[0] must be the smallest multiple of 1 >=0 \u2192 0. \n\nThen for i=1 (a=2):\n\nb[1] must be >0. The smallest multiple of 2 is 2. \n\nBut the example's b[1] is 0, which is not greater than 0. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not correct. \n\nWait, the example's solution has b[1] =0, which is not greater than b[0] =-1. \n\nAh, right, the first element can be negative. \n\nSo the algorithm must allow b[i] to be any multiple of a_i, but must be strictly increasing. \n\nSo the minimal moves would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible b array that is strictly increasing. \n\nThe approach is to process from left to right, and for each i, set b[i] to the smallest possible multiple of a_i that is greater than b[i-1]. \n\nBut the initial b[0] can be any multiple of a[0], but to minimize the moves, we can set it to the smallest possible (which is 0 if possible). \n\nWait, but if a[0] is 1, then b[0] can be 0, which is the minimal. \n\nThen for the next element, a[1] is 2. \n\nWe need b[1] >0. The smallest multiple of 2 greater than 0 is 2. \n\nBut in the example, the first element is -1 (which is a multiple of 1). \n\nAh, so the minimal moves would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible b array, but allowing negative values. \n\nSo the algorithm should allow b[i] to be as small as possible, but still strictly increasing. \n\nThe minimal moves would be achieved by setting each b[i] to the smallest possible value (could be negative) such that it is a multiple of a[i], and greater than b[i-1]. \n\nWait, but how to compute this? \n\nThe minimal moves would be the sum of |b_i| / a_i. \n\nTo minimize this sum, we want each b_i to be as close to zero as possible while still maintaining the strictly increasing condition. \n\nSo the optimal approach is to set each b_i to the smallest possible value (could be negative) such that b_i > b_{i-1}, and b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nThe way to do this is:\n\nStart with b[0] =0 (since it's the smallest possible multiple of a[0], and allows minimal moves). \n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nWe need b[i] to be the smallest multiple of a[i] that is greater than b[i-1]. \n\nThe smallest such multiple is:\n\nIf b[i-1] mod a[i] ==0 \u2192 then the next multiple is b[i-1] + a[i]. \n\nElse \u2192 the next multiple is ceil( (b[i-1]+1)/a[i] ) * a[i]. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose b[i-1] is 0, a[i] is 2. \n\nThe smallest multiple of 2 greater than 0 is 2. \n\nBut in the example, the first element is -1 (a[0]=1), so b[0] can be -1. \n\nAh, so the initial choice of b[0] can be negative. \n\nSo the minimal moves would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible b array, which may involve negative values. \n\nThe algorithm must choose for each b[i] the smallest possible value (could be negative) such that it is a multiple of a[i], and greater than b[i-1]. \n\nThe minimal moves would then be the sum of the absolute values divided by a[i]. \n\nSo the approach is to process from left to right, and for each i, compute the minimal possible b[i] given the previous b[i-1]. \n\nThe problem is that this requires a greedy approach, but the initial choice of b[0] can be any multiple of a[0], so we need to choose the best possible starting point. \n\nWait, but how do we choose the initial b[0]? \n\nThe minimal moves would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible b[0], but that might not be possible because subsequent elements may require larger values. \n\nThis suggests that the problem requires dynamic programming or some other approach. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves can be computed by greedily choosing the smallest possible b[i] at each step. \n\nLet me try this approach with the first example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nWe want to find the minimal moves. \n\nThe example's solution is [-1,0,3,4,5], with moves 1 (for first element: -1 \u2192 1 move), 0 (second element 0 \u2192 0 moves), 3/3=1 move (third), 4/4=1, 5/5=1 \u2192 total 4 moves. \n\nFollowing the greedy approach:\n\nStart with b[0] =0 (minimal possible). \n\nThen for i=1 (a=2):\n\nWe need b[1] >0. The smallest multiple of 2 is 2 \u2192 moves +=1 (2/2). \n\nThen for i=2 (a=3):\n\nNeed b[2] >2 \u2192 smallest multiple is 3 \u2192 moves +=1 (3/3). \n\ni=3 (a=4): need >3 \u2192 4 \u2192 moves +=1. \n\ni=4 (a=5): need >4 \u21925 \u2192 moves +=1. \n\nTotal moves: 0 (first) +1+1+1+1 \u2192 total 4, which matches the example. \n\nBut the example's solution uses b[0] =-1 (which requires 1 move), but the total is the same. \n\nHmm, so the greedy approach gives the same result. \n\nAnother example: \n\nExample 2 from the problem's note:\n\nInput n=7, a = [3,2,1,4,5,6,7]. \n\nThe example's solution requires 10 moves. \n\nUsing the greedy approach:\n\nb[0] =0 (a=3 \u2192 0 is allowed). \n\nb[1] must be >0. The smallest multiple of 2 is 2 \u2192 moves +=1. \n\nb[2] must be >2 \u2192 smallest multiple of 1 is 3 \u2192 moves +=3 (3/1). \n\nb[3] must be >3 \u2192 smallest multiple of4 is4 \u2192 moves +=1. \n\nb[4] must be>4 \u21925 \u2192 moves +=1 (5/5). \n\nb[5] must be>5 \u21926 \u2192 moves +=1 (6/6). \n\nb[6] must be>6 \u21927 \u2192 moves +=1 (7/7). \n\nTotal moves: 0+1+3+1+1+1+1 =8. But the example says 10. \n\nHmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait the example's note says the second example's answer is 10. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nThe second example's note says:\n\nExample 2: you can reach [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves. \n\nThe moves for each element:\n\n-3 \u2192 3 moves (3 steps of -3/3 =1 move? Wait, each move is adding or subtracting 3. To get to -3, you subtract once \u2192 1 move. \n\nWait, the first element's a is 3. \n\nTo get to -3: subtract once \u2192 1 move. \n\nSecond element a=2 \u2192 -2 \u2192 subtract once \u2192 1 move. \n\nThird a=1 \u2192 -1 \u2192 subtract once \u21921. \n\nFourth a=4 \u21920 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 moves. \n\nFifth a=5 \u21921 \u2192 add once \u21921 move. \n\nSixth a=6 \u21922 \u2192 add once \u21921. \n\nSeventh a=7 \u21923 \u2192 add once \u21921. \n\nTotal moves: 1+1+1+0+1+1+1 =6. But the example says 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nWait the example says the second example's input is not given, but the output is 10. \n\nWait the problem's note says:\n\nExample 2: you can reach [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves. \n\nWait, let's compute the moves for each element:\n\nFor the first element (a=3):\n\nb[0] =-3 \u2192 requires 1 move (subtract 3 once). \n\nSecond element (a=2): b[1]=-2 \u2192 subtract once \u21921 move. \n\nThird (a=1): b[2]=-1 \u2192 subtract once \u21921. \n\nFourth (a=4): b[3]=0 \u2192 0 \u21920 moves. \n\nFifth (a=5): b[4]=1 \u2192 add once \u21921. \n\nSixth (a=6): b[5]=2 \u2192 add once \u21921. \n\nSeventh (a=7): b[6]=3 \u2192 add once \u21921. \n\nTotal moves: 1+1+1+0+1+1+1 =6. \n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's input is different. \n\nWait the problem's note says:\n\nExample 2's input is not given, but the output is 10. \n\nPerhaps the example's input is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's solution requires more moves. \n\nWait, maybe the example's input is a = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7], but the desired array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. \n\nThe moves for each element:\n\nFirst element: -3 \u2192 subtract 3 once \u21921 move. \n\nSecond: -2 \u2192 subtract 2 once \u21921. \n\nThird: -1 \u2192 subtract 1 once \u21921. \n\nFourth:0 \u21920 \u21920. \n\nFifth:1 \u2192 add 5 once \u21921. \n\nSixth:2 \u2192 add 6 once \u21921. \n\nSeventh:3 \u2192 add 7 once \u21921. \n\nTotal is 6. \n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's input is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's solution requires more steps. \n\nWait, maybe the example's input is a = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7], but the desired array is [ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. \n\nThe moves are correct as 6. \n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's input is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's input is a = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7], but the desired array is [ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. \n\nWait, the moves are 1+1+1+0+1+1+1 =6. \n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nThe problem says each move is adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. \n\nSo for the first element (a=3), to get to -3, you need to subtract 3 once \u2192 1 move. \n\nYes. \n\nSecond element (a=2) to -2: subtract 2 once \u21921 move. \n\nThird (a=1) to -1: subtract 1 once \u21921. \n\nFourth (a=4) to 0: 0 moves. \n\nFifth (a=5) to 1: add 5 once \u21921. \n\nSixth (a=6) to 2: add 6 once \u21921. \n\nSeventh (a=7) to 3: add 7 once \u21921. \n\nTotal is 6. \n\nBut the example says 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's input is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's input is a = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7], but the desired array is [ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. \n\nWait, the example's note says the second example's answer is 10. \n\nPerhaps the example's input is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's input is a = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7], but the desired array is [ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. \n\nBut the moves are 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's input is a = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7], and the minimal moves are 10. \n\nWait, maybe the greedy approach isn't optimal. \n\nLet me try another approach. \n\nSuppose we choose b[0] =-3 (1 move). \n\nb[1] must be >-3. The smallest multiple of 2 greater than -3 is -2 (since -2 is greater than -3). \n\nTo get to -2 from 0: subtract 2 once \u21921 move. \n\nb[2] must be >-2. The smallest multiple of 1 is -1 \u2192 subtract 1 once \u21921 move. \n\nb[3] must be >-1. The smallest multiple of4 is 0 \u21920 moves. \n\nb[4] must be>0.

TODO: Your code here \n\nThe code's right part is missing. \n\nThe problem is to fill in the missing code in the right part. \n\nThe code's current structure for the right part is:\n\nk =i+1 \n\nprev =0 \n\nwhile k < len(a):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe code's left part for the elements before i is computed, and now the right part (elements after i) needs to be computed. \n\nThe right part should be similar to the left part but in the forward direction. \n\nThe left part's code for j from i-1 down to 0:\n\nprev starts at 0 (the value of b[i], which is assumed to be 0?), and then for each j, we compute the required b[j] such that it is less than the next element. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is assuming that the current i's b value is 0, and then computes the left and right parts based on that. \n\nThe code's approach is to try all possible i as the position where b[i] is set to 0, and then compute the minimal moves for the left and right parts. \n\nThe minimal among all these is the answer. \n\nThe left part's code is for elements before i, ensuring that they are less than the next element (which is part of the left processing). \n\nThe right part's code should be for elements after i, ensuring that they are greater than the previous element (which is part of the right processing). \n\nThe right part's code should be similar to the left part but in the forward direction. \n\nThe left part's code for each j (processing from i-1 down to 0):\n\nprev is the value of the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nWe need to choose b[j] such that it is less than prev. \n\nThe code computes x as the minimal number of steps to reach the largest possible b[j] that is less than prev. \n\nThe code's approach for the right part should be:\n\nprev is the value of the previous element (b[k-1]). \n\nWe need to choose b[k] such that it is greater than prev. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to choose the smallest possible b[k] that is a multiple of a[k] and greater than prev. \n\nThe minimal such b[k] is ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] ) * a[k]. \n\nThe number of steps is (b[k]/a[k]). \n\nSo the code for the right part should be:\n\nprev =0 \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the right part starts with prev being the value of b[i], which is assumed to be 0. \n\nThen for each k from i+1 to n-1:\n\nWe need b[k] > prev. \n\nThe minimal b[k] is the smallest multiple of a[k] greater than prev. \n\nThe minimal steps are (b[k]/a[k]). \n\nThe code should compute this. \n\nSo the code for the right part would be:\n\nprev =0 \n\nwhile k < len(a):\n\n    # compute the minimal b[k] > prev \n\n    # the minimal b[k] is ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] ) * a[k]\n\n    x = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[k] *x \n\n    k +=1 \n\nSo the missing code in the right part is:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nk +=1 \n\nWait, but the code's loop is while k < len(a):\n\nInside the loop, the code needs to compute the required x for the current k. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nk +=1 \n\nBut the code's loop is a while loop, so after processing k, we need to increment k. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nwhile k < len(a):\n\n    x = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[k] *x \n\n    k +=1 \n\nThus, the missing code for the right part is the block inside the while loop. \n\nSo the code for program2.py's missing part is:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nk +=1 \n\nBut since the loop is while k < len(a), the code must be inside the loop. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nk +=1 \n\nBut the code's loop is already written as while k < len(a):, so the missing code is the four lines inside the loop. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is the block inside the while loop for the right part. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code for program1.py is the else clause's code, and for program2.py is the right part's loop body. \n\nNow, to format the answer as JSON with the missing code for each program. \n\nFor program1.py's missing code:\n\nThe else clause is:\n\nelse:\n\n    a += l1[l]\n\n    l +=1 \n\nSo the code is:\n\nelse:\n    a += l1[l]\n    l +=1\n\nFor program2.py's missing code:\n\nThe right part's loop body is:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nk +=1 \n\nSo the code is:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\ntemp +=x\nprev = a[k] * x\nk +=1\n\nThus, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"a += l1[l]\\n    l +=1\",\n    \"program2\": \"x = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\\ntemp +=x\\nprev = a[k] * x\\nk +=1\"\n}\n\nWait, but in Python, the code must be indented properly. \n\nIn program1's else clause, the code is inside the else block, which is indented under the while loop. \n\nThe existing code has:\n\nelse:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\na += l1[l]\nl +=1\n\nWhich is indented with four spaces. \n\nFor program2's missing code, the while loop is:\n\nwhile k<len(a):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code inside the loop must be indented with four spaces. \n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\ntemp +=x\nprev = a[k] * x\nk +=1\n\nEach line indented with four spaces. \n\nThus, the JSON should have the code strings with the proper indentation. \n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"a += l1[l]\\n    l += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"x = ceil( (prev + 1)/a[k] )\\n    temp += x\\n    prev = a[k] * x\\n    k += 1\"\n}\n\nWait, but in the code for program2, the ceil function is imported from math. \n\nThe code has from math import ceil, so that's okay. \n\nAlso, in the code for program2, the variables are named correctly. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the final answer is as above."
