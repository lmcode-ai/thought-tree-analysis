  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp must turn one into R and the other into B. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects exactly two adjacent cells. The key here is to find out if the given string can be achieved through such operations.\n\nLooking at the provided code for program1.py, the current approach is trying to process the string by stripping leading and trailing W's, then splitting the remaining parts by W. The loop over the temp list (which contains non-W segments) checks each segment. The code is incomplete where it says 'if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: ... TODO'.\n\nHmm, the idea here is probably that any non-W segment must have both R and B. Because each stamp operation on two cells must turn one into R and the other into B. So if a segment (a group of non-W characters) has only R or only B, then it's impossible. Because you can't have a single R or B without the other in that segment. Because every time you stamp, you have to have one R and one B in that pair. So any isolated R or B in a segment would be invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Let me think. Suppose a segment is \"RRBB\". How would that be possible? Let's see. Each stamp must create a pair of R and B. So maybe overlapping stamps can lead to such a combination. But the key is that in any segment between W's, the characters must alternate in some way? Or perhaps the entire segment must have an even number of characters? Or maybe the sequence must have pairs where each pair is either RB or BR?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string (after removing leading and trailing W's) must be such that every pair of consecutive non-W characters must form a valid transition. Wait, maybe the problem is that each non-W segment must have an even length? Because each stamp affects two cells, but overlapping can complicate things. Wait, but the stamps can be applied multiple times. Hmm, maybe the key is that in any non-W segment, every character must be part of a pair of R and B. So for example, a segment like \"RB\" is okay, but \"RR\" is not, because you can't get two R's in a row without a B. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think of the stamping process. Each stamp on two cells turns one into R and the other into B. So each application affects exactly two cells, turning them into R and B in some order. But when you apply a stamp over existing cells, you can overwrite previous colors. So for example, if you have a cell that was previously R, you can stamp over it again to turn it into B, as part of a new pair.\n\nBut the problem is to see if the final string can be achieved through any number of such operations. The key observation here is that in the final string, any two adjacent non-W cells must form a pair that can be part of some stamp. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps the entire non-W segments must have certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string (after trimming W's) must have an even length. Because each stamp operation affects two cells, but overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, but the length could be even or odd? Let me think of examples.\n\nTake the example given in the problem statement: the final string is B R B B W. Wait, the example's final string is \"B R B B W\" (but the actual example's final string is \"BRBBW\", but after trimming leading and trailing W's, it's \"BRBB\". The length here is 4, which is even. So that works. Another example: if the string is \"RBRB\", that's okay. But if a segment is of length 3, like \"RBR\", then that's a problem. Because each stamp must cover two cells, so the total number of non-W cells must be even? Because each stamp contributes two cells, but overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, no. Because you can apply the stamp multiple times on overlapping regions. For instance, a segment of length 3 could be formed by overlapping stamps. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the initial is WWW. Let's say we stamp positions 1-2 (assuming 0-based?), making them RB. Then stamp positions 2-3, making them BR. The result would be R B B. So the segment is RBB, which is length 3. Wait, but that's possible. So the length can be odd?\n\nHmm, so the length of the non-W segments can be odd? That complicates things. So the initial approach of checking that each segment has both R and B is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is that in any non-W segment, the colors must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. But overlapping stamps can create sequences where the colors alternate. Wait, but in the example I just thought of (RBB), the second and third are both B. So that's not alternating. So that approach might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W segment must have an even number of characters. Because each stamp adds two, but overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, but in the example I had earlier, the segment RBB is length 3, which is odd. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that in the final string, every pair of adjacent non-W cells must be either RB or BR. Because each stamp can be applied in either direction. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. So adjacent B's. That's allowed? Wait, but how?\n\nWait the example given in the problem's first test case is the sequence that ends up as BRBBW. Let me see the steps:\n\nThe example's final string is \"B R B B W\". The steps were:\n\nStart with WWWWW.\n\nFirst stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), turning them into RB. So the string becomes WW RB W.\n\nThen stamp at 0-1, turning into BR. So the first two are BR, then R B, then W. So the string is BR R B W.\n\nWait, then the third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the R and R?), which would turn them into either RB or BR. Wait, but the third step in the example's explanation is stamping positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would turn them into either RB or BR. Wait, but in the example's third step, they stamp positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but the result is B R followed by R B? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. The example's final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. So adjacent B's. How is that possible?\n\nAh, because when you stamp over existing cells, you can overwrite them. For instance, in the third step of the example, they stamp positions 2-3 (the R and B?), turning them into BR or RB. Wait, maybe I need to think of the example again.\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: W W W W W\n\nFirst stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), resulting in W W W R B.\n\nSecond stamp at 0-1, turning into B R, so the first two are B R, then the third is W (wait no, the third step in the example's explanation is a bit unclear. Maybe the example's steps are:\n\nFirst stamp: positions 3-4 (so the last two) \u2192 becomes RB. So the string is WW RB W.\n\nSecond stamp: positions 0-1 \u2192 BR. So the first two are BR, then the third is W? Wait, but the example's second step leads to B R R B W? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. The example's explanation says:\n\nThe second step is stamping the first two cells (positions 0-1?), turning them into BR. So the first two are BR, followed by R B (from the first stamp?), then W. Wait, perhaps the example's steps are:\n\nAfter first stamp: positions 3-4 \u2192 the string is WW followed by RB, then W. So the string is \"WWRBW\".\n\nSecond stamp: positions 0-1 \u2192 stamping there, so they become BR. So the first two are BR, then the third is W? Wait, but the third character was W before. So after the second stamp, the string becomes BR followed by W, then RB, then W. So the string is BRWRBW? Not sure. The example's final string after the second step is \"BR R B W\" (maybe the third character is R?), but perhaps the example's explanation is a bit different.\n\nIn any case, the final string in the example has two B's in a row. So that's allowed. So adjacent B's are possible. So the previous idea that adjacent must be R and B is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition here?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the stamp operations. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, and each time it changes two adjacent cells to R and B in either order. The key is that every cell's color must be the result of an even or odd number of stamps affecting it, but since each stamp affects exactly two cells, perhaps there's some parity condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must satisfy that every run of non-W characters has even length? Because each stamp contributes two cells, but overlapping can allow for longer runs. Wait, but in the example's final string, the non-W part is BRBB (length 4, even). So that works. Another example: if the string is \"RBRB\", that's even. But what about a string like \"RRBB\"? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is RRBB. Let's see if that can be formed.\n\nFirst, stamp positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B ... but then the first two are R and B. But the desired is RR. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible through multiple stamps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that in the final string, every pair of adjacent non-W cells must have at least one of them being part of a pair that can be formed by a stamp. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W segments must have an even length. Because each stamp affects two cells, but overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, but in the example where the segment is length 3 (like RBB), that's odd. But earlier I thought that was possible. Wait, but in that case, how?\n\nWait, let me think of the example where the segment is RBB (length 3). Let's see:\n\nSuppose we start with three W's: WWW.\n\nStamp positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nThen stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 so the second and third become B and R? Wait, no. Wait, when you stamp positions 1-2, you can choose to make them either RB or BR. Let's say you choose BR. So the second becomes B (overwriting the previous B?), and third becomes R. So the result would be R B R. Hmm, that's not RBB. Alternatively, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nThen stamp 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R W. Then stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R B. So the result is B R B. That's length 3, but all are non-W. So that's allowed. So the length can be odd. So the even length idea is not correct.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition here?\n\nAnother thought: Each time you apply a stamp, you are effectively toggling the colors of two adjacent cells. Wait, no, because each stamp sets them to R and B in some order. So each application can overwrite previous colors. So the final colors must be achievable through some combination of these operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every occurrence of a non-W character must be part of at least one pair of adjacent cells that are R and B in some order. Because each stamp must have been applied to some pair, and each application affects exactly two cells. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must have the property that between any two non-W cells, there's a way to form pairs such that each pair is either RB or BR. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the final string must be such that every non-W segment can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each cell's color must be determined by the stamps applied to it. Each stamp affects two cells. The final color of each cell is the result of all the stamps applied to it. Since each stamp can set it to either R or B, depending on the direction of the stamp. So for each cell, the number of times it was part of a stamp's R or B side must be such that the final color is determined.\n\nWait, perhaps each cell's color must be either R or B (since W is only allowed if it's not part of any stamp). Wait, no, because W is allowed in the final string only if it's not part of any stamp. Wait, no, the problem says that the stamp can be applied multiple times, but each application must be on two neighboring cells. So any cell that is W in the final string must have never been part of any stamp. Because every time a stamp is applied to a cell, it changes its color to either R or B. So if a cell is W in the final string, it must have never been stamped on. Therefore, all the W's in the final string must be in positions that are not covered by any stamp's application.\n\nTherefore, the non-W segments must be such that they can be formed by overlapping stamps, and the W's must be in regions that are not covered by any stamp.\n\nWait, but the problem allows the stamps to be applied multiple times. So even if a cell is part of a stamp, it can be overwritten again. But if a cell is W in the end, that means it was never part of any stamp. Because every time a stamp is applied to it, it would have been set to R or B. So the W's must be in regions that are not covered by any stamp's application.\n\nTherefore, the non-W segments must be contiguous and form a region where all the cells in that region are covered by at least one stamp. But how does that help?\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that in the non-W segments, every pair of adjacent cells must be part of at least one stamp. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W segments must have the property that every cell except possibly the first and last can be part of a pair with their neighbors. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of parity. Each stamp affects two cells. Let's model the colors as follows: each cell can be R, B, or W. For non-W cells, their color must be determined by an odd number of stamps (since each stamp changes their color from W to either R or B, but subsequent stamps can flip them again). Wait, but each stamp sets the color, not toggles. So each time a stamp is applied to a cell, it's set to either R or B, depending on the direction of the stamp. So the final color of a cell is the last stamp that was applied to it. So the order of stamps matters.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Let's consider the final string. For it to be possible, the following must hold:\n\n1. All non-W segments must be such that they can be formed by some sequence of stamps. Since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the entire non-W segments must be covered by some overlapping pairs of R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the non-W segments, every pair of adjacent cells must be either R and B or B and R. Because each stamp can only create such a pair. But overlapping stamps can allow for longer sequences. Wait, but in the example given in the problem's first test case, the final string has two B's in a row. So that contradicts this idea.\n\nHmm, so that's not the case. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the entire non-W segments. Each time you apply a stamp, you can choose to set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The final colors must be achievable through some combination of these operations. The key is that for any two adjacent cells in the final string, if they are both non-W, then they must have been set by some stamp. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, perhaps the order allows for any combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W segment must have an even number of R and B? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W segment must have an even number of characters. Because each stamp contributes two, but overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, but in the example where the segment is length 3 (like RBB), that's odd. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that in the non-W segments, every cell except the first and last can be part of a pair with their neighbors. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the final string, the colors must alternate between R and B, except for the possibility of W's. But again, the example has two B's in a row.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the final string can be formed if and only if every non-W segment has an even number of characters, and each such segment can be partitioned into pairs of R and B in some order. Wait, but the example's segment is length 4 (even), so that works. The RBB part in my earlier example (length 3) would be invalid, but in that case, the example I thought of (RBB) would not be allowed. Wait, but earlier I thought that it was possible to get RBB. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWait, in the example where the final string is RBB (length 3):\n\nSuppose we start with three W's: WWW.\n\nFirst stamp positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nSecond stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 so the second and third become B and R? Wait, no. Wait, when you stamp positions 1-2, you can choose to set them to RB or BR. Let's choose BR. So the second becomes B (overwriting the previous B?), and third becomes R. So the result is R B R. Not RBB.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nThen stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R. So the second and third become B and R. So the string becomes R B R. Still not RBB.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not possible to get RBB. So perhaps my earlier thought was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, to get RBB:\n\nSuppose first stamp 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nThen stamp 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nThen stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. So the second and third become R and B. So the string becomes B R B. So the third character is B. So the final string is B R B. That's three characters, all non-W. So that's allowed. So the length is 3 (odd). So the even length idea is not correct.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition here?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as each stamp must contribute exactly one R and one B. So the total number of R's and B's in the final string must be equal? Because each stamp adds one R and one B. But overlapping can cause some to be overwritten. Wait, no. Because each stamp can overwrite previous colors. So the total count of R and B can vary.\n\nWait, for example, in the first example's final string, the counts are B:2, R:1, B:1, so total B's are 3 and R is 1. So that's not equal. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think of the problem differently. Let's consider that each stamp can be applied in either direction (RB or BR). The key is that every non-W cell must have been part of at least one stamp. Because otherwise, it would remain W. So the non-W segments must be covered by the stamps' applications. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W segments must form a sequence where every pair of adjacent cells can be part of a stamp. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every non-W segment must have an even number of characters. Because each stamp covers two cells, but overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, but in the example I had earlier (B R B), that's three characters (odd). So that contradicts that idea.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that the entire non-W segment can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W segments must have the property that every pair of adjacent cells in the segment must be either R and B or B and R. Because each stamp can only create such a pair, and overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, but in the example of B R B, the pairs are BR and RB, which are allowed. So that works. So the entire segment must alternate between R and B. So the colors must alternate between R and B in the non-W segments. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B, so overlapping stamps must alternate.\n\nAh! That's probably the key. So in any non-W segment, the colors must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B, and overlapping stamps must alternate. So the entire non-W segment must be an alternating sequence of R and B. So for example, RBRB is okay, BRBR is okay, but RBB is not, because the second and third are both B. Wait, but in the example I thought of earlier (B R B), that's allowed. Because it alternates B R B. So that's okay. So the non-W segments must alternate between R and B. So any two adjacent non-W cells must be different. So the entire non-W segment must be an alternating sequence of R and B. \n\nWait, but in the first example's final string, the segment is B R B B W. Wait, the third and fourth characters are B and B. So that's two B's in a row. Which would violate the alternating condition. But according to the problem's example, that is a valid case. So this suggests that my current hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, the example's final string is \"B R B B W\". Wait, the third and fourth are B and B. So that's two B's in a row. Which would not alternate. So that contradicts the idea that they must alternate. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so what's going on here. Let me re-examine the example given in the problem statement.\n\nThe example's final string is \"B R B B W\". The steps are:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp (positions 3-4) \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 then stamp 0-1 \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 then stamp 1-2 (positions 1-2, which are R and R?), but the third step's stamp is applied to positions 1-2 (the R and R?), which would turn them into either RB or BR. Wait, but the result after the third step is B R B B W. So the first two are B R, then R B \u2192 but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. Let me read the example again:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\n1. WWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB (positions 3-4?), then W.\n\n2. Then stamp the first two cells (0-1?), turning them into BR. So the first two are BR, then the third is W (from the first step's third character?), then the fourth and fifth are RB and W. Wait, perhaps the second step's result is BR followed by R B W. So the third character is R (from the first stamp's first character?), then the fourth is B, fifth W. So the string after second step is B R R B W.\n\nThen the third step is stamping positions 2-3 (the R and B?), turning them into BR or RB. Let's say they choose BR. So the third and fourth become B and R. So the string becomes B R B R W. But the example's final string is B R B B W. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third step's stamp is applied to positions 2-3 (the R and B?), turning them into RB. So the third becomes R and fourth B. But that would give B R R B W. Not sure. The example's final string is B R B B W. So the third and fourth are B and B. How is that possible?\n\nAh, maybe the third step's stamp is applied to positions 2-3 (the R and B?), but the stamp is applied as BR. So the third becomes B and fourth R. Wait, but that would give B R B R W. Not matching the example's final string.\n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is a typo, but according to the problem's description, it's allowed. So there must be a way to get two B's in a row.\n\nWait, maybe the example's final string is \"B R B B W\" (so the third and fourth are B and B). How can that be formed?\n\nLet me think of another approach. Suppose the first stamp is applied to positions 2-3 (third and fourth cells?), turning them into RB. Then another stamp applied to positions 1-2 (second and third cells?), which are W and R. So the second becomes B and third R. So the third cell is now R, but the fourth was B. Then another stamp on positions 3-4 (third and fourth?), turning them into BR. So third becomes B and fourth R. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's final string is allowed because the two B's are part of overlapping stamps. Let me think of the example's final string: B R B B W. The third and fourth are B and B. How can that be formed?\n\nSuppose the first stamp is applied to positions 1-2 (second and third cells?), turning them into RB. So the string becomes W B R W W.\n\nThen another stamp on positions 2-3 (third and fourth?), turning them into BR. So third becomes B and fourth R. So the string is W B B R W.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two B's are the result of overlapping stamps that set them both to B. Wait, but each stamp must set one to R and the other to B. So how can two adjacent cells both be B?\n\nAh! Wait a second. Each stamp must set one to R and the other to B. So for two adjacent cells to both be B, there must be a way that their colors were set by different stamps. For example:\n\nSuppose first stamp on positions 0-1: set to RB \u2192 R B.\n\nThen another stamp on positions 1-2: set to BR \u2192 so the second becomes B (overwriting the previous B?), and third becomes R. So the string is R B R.\n\nThen another stamp on positions 1-2 again, this time as BR \u2192 so the second becomes B and third R again. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B.\n\nSecond stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThird stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 so the second and third become B and R. So the string is B B R. Now the first two are B and B. So that's two B's in a row. So that's possible.\n\nAh! So that's how it can happen. So the two B's are the result of overlapping stamps. The first stamp set the first to R and second to B. The second stamp set the first to B and second to R. The third stamp set the second to B and third to R. So the first two are B and B. So the two B's are allowed.\n\nSo the key is that the two B's are not part of the same stamp's application. Each was set by different stamps. So the two B's can be adjacent as long as their colors were set by different stamps.\n\nSo the previous idea that the non-W segments must alternate between R and B is incorrect. So what's the correct condition?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that in the non-W segments, every pair of adjacent cells must be part of at least one stamp's application. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W segment must have an even number of characters. Because each stamp contributes two, but overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Wait, in the example where the segment is B B (two B's), that's even length. So that works. The example's final string has a segment of length 4 (B R B B \u2192 4 characters). So that's even. The earlier example of B B R (length 3) is odd, so that would be invalid. But in the example I thought of earlier (B B R), that's length 3, which is odd. So that would not be allowed. But in the example where the two B's are part of a length 2 segment, that's allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the non-W segments must have even length. Because each stamp covers two cells, and overlapping can allow for longer even-length segments. Let me see:\n\nIn the example's final string, the non-W segment is length 4 (even). The example where two B's are adjacent (length 2) is allowed. The case of three B's (length 3) would be invalid. So the condition is that all non-W segments must have even length.\n\nAh! That makes sense. Because each stamp covers two cells, and any non-W segment must be covered by some combination of stamps. The minimal way to cover a segment of length L requires that L is even. Because each stamp covers two cells, but overlapping can allow for longer even lengths. For example, a segment of length 4 can be covered by two overlapping stamps (positions 0-1 and 1-2 and 2-3?), but the total length must be even.\n\nWait, but how does that work for the example where the segment is two B's (length 2). That's even, so allowed. The example's final string's segment is length 4, which is even. The case of three B's (length 3) is odd, so not allowed.\n\nSo the condition is that all non-W segments must have even length, and also that each segment contains at least one R and one B. Because if a segment is all R's or all B's, then it can't be formed by stamps, since each stamp must have one R and one B.\n\nWait, but in the case of two B's, how can that be formed? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the segment is BB. To form this, you need to have two B's. But each stamp must have one R and one B. So how can two B's be formed?\n\nAh, here's the thing: the two B's must have been set by different stamps. For example:\n\nFirst stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nSecond stamp on positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B.\n\nWait, but that would result in R B. Not BB.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach:\n\nSuppose first stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThen another stamp on 0-1 as BR again \u2192 B R again. So the first two are B and R. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThen stamp on 1-2 (but that's beyond the two cells). Wait, the segment is two cells. So the only way to get two B's is:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThen stamp on 0-1 as BR again \u2192 B R again. No change.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. How can two B's be formed?\n\nWait, perhaps it's impossible. So the example's final string must have a segment of length 4, but the two B's are part of a longer sequence where other characters are present.\n\nWait, in the example's final string, the two B's are part of a segment of length 4. Let's see:\n\nThe segment is B R B B. The first two are B and R (from a stamp), then the third and fourth are B and B. How can that be formed?\n\nHmm, perhaps the first stamp is applied to positions 0-1 (B R), then another stamp on positions 2-3 (B B?), but that's not possible because a stamp must set one to R and the other to B. So the third and fourth can't both be B unless they were set by different stamps.\n\nWait, maybe the third and fourth were set by overlapping stamps. For example:\n\nStamp 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) as BR \u2192 so position 1 becomes B and 2 becomes R.\n\nThen stamp 2-3 as BR \u2192 position 2 becomes B and 3 becomes R. So the third and fourth (positions 2 and 3) are B and R. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the problem's conditions again.\n\nThe problem requires that the final string can be formed by any number of stamp applications. Each stamp must be applied to two adjacent cells, and each application sets one to R and the other to B. The order of the stamp (which is R and which is B) can be chosen each time.\n\nThe key is that for any non-W segment, the length must be even. Because each stamp covers two cells, and overlapping can allow for longer even-length segments. So the first condition is that all non-W segments have even length.\n\nThe second condition is that in each non-W segment, there must be at least one R and at least one B. Because if a segment is all R's or all B's, then it can't be formed by any combination of stamps, since each stamp contributes one R and one B.\n\nWait, but in the case of two B's, that would require that the segment has both R and B. But two B's would violate that. So such a segment would be invalid. So the example's final string must have at least one R in the segment.\n\nAh! So the two conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W segments must have even length.\n\n2. Each non-W segment must contain at least one R and at least one B.\n\nSo in the example's final string, the segment is B R B B (length 4). It contains R and B, so that's okay. The two B's are allowed as long as there's at least one R.\n\nSo the code for program1.py should check these two conditions.\n\nNow looking back at the provided code for program1.py:\n\nThe code starts by stripping leading and trailing W's, then splits the remaining string into parts separated by W. The temp list contains the non-W segments.\n\nThen, for each segment in temp:\n\nif the segment is not empty (i.e., it's a non-W segment):\n\n    if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i \u2192 then it's invalid (so return NO)\n\n    else \u2192 continue?\n\nWait, the code currently has a loop over temp, and for each i in temp (the segments):\n\nif i is not empty:\n\n    if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i \u2192 then the segment has only one color \u2192 so return NO.\n\n    else \u2192 continue?\n\nBut the code also needs to check the length of the segment is even.\n\nSo the missing code in the first program is to check the length of each segment is even. So in the loop over temp:\n\nfor i in temp:\n\n    if i:\n\n        if len(i) % 2 != 0 \u2192 then return NO.\n\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i \u2192 return NO.\n\nSo the code should check both conditions.\n\nThe current code has the 'B' and 'R' check, but not the length check.\n\nSo the missing part is adding the length check.\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor i in temp:\n\n    if i:\n\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code needs to also check the length of i is even. So perhaps the code should first check the length, then check the presence of both colors.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor i in temp:\n\n    if i:\n\n        if len(i) % 2 != 0:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            break\n\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        ... (but the else is not needed here)\n\nWait, but the code structure is:\n\nfor i in temp:\n\n    if i:\n\n        if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, the code's structure is a bit confusing.

Using a stamp, you can stamp any two adjacent cells such that one becomes red and the other becomes blue. The stamp can be rotated, i.e. you can choose to stamp any cell in either way.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$\u00a0\u2014 the final string you need to make.
