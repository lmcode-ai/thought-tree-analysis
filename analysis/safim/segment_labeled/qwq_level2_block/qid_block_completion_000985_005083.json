Another approach: since the sequence must be strictly increasing, each x_i must be at least x_{i-1} + 1. So for each i, x_i must be at least x_{i-1} + 1. But x_i must also be a multiple of a_i. So perhaps we can model this as a chain of constraints. Let me think of the problem in terms of the previous term. Let's denote x_{i} must be at least x_{i-1} + 1, and x_i must be a multiple of a_i. So for each i, given x_{i-1}, the minimal possible x_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than x_{i-1} + 1. Alternatively, the minimal x_i could be the first multiple of a_i that is larger than x_{i-1} + 1.

Alternatively, if we set x_1 to 0 (steps 0), then x_2 must be at least 1. The minimal x_2 is 2 (k=1, steps 1). Then x_3 must be >2. The minimal is 3 (steps 1). x_4 must be >3, so 4 (steps 1). x_5 must be >4, so 5 (steps 1). Total steps 0+1+1+1+1 =4. Same total. Hmm, so in this case, both approaches give the same total. Another example: suppose a = [3, 1]. The minimal steps would be?\n\nPossible options:\n\nOption 1: x1 =0 (steps 0). Then x2 must be >0. The minimal is 1 (steps 1). Total steps 1. \n\nOption 2: x1 =-3 (steps 1). x2 must be >-3. The minimal is 0 (steps 0). Total steps 1. Either way, the total is 1. Hmm, so perhaps the minimal steps can be achieved by choosing x_i as the minimal possible (either positive or negative) as long as it's just above the previous x_{i-1}. So the key is to choose x_i as the smallest possible multiple of a_i that is greater than x_{i-1}. This way, each step is as small as possible, leading to minimal steps. So the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number). For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   Find the minimal x_i such that x_i is a multiple of a_i, and x_i > x_prev. The minimal steps for this step is |x_i / a_i|. Update x_prev to x_i. Wait, but how do we compute x_i? The minimal x_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than x_prev. So, the minimal x_i is ceil( (x_prev + 1)/a_i ) * a_i. Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose x_prev is 0, a_i is 2. Then the minimal x_i is 2 (since 2>0). Yes, ceil( (0+1)/2 ) = 1, so 1*2=2. Another example: x_prev is 1, a_i is 3. Then the minimal x_i is 3 (since 3>1). Yes, ceil( (1+1)/3 ) = ceil(2/3) =1 \u2192 3. Another example: x_prev is 4, a_i is 3. Then minimal x_i is 6 (since 6>4). Yes, ceil( (4+1)/3 ) = ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 2*3=6. Hmm, that formula works. So the minimal x_i is ceil( (x_prev +1)/a_i ) * a_i. Wait, but what if x_prev is negative? Suppose x_prev is -5, a_i is 3. Then the minimal x_i is 0 (since 0 >-5). Wait, 0 is a multiple of 3 (0 =0*3). So, (x_prev +1) is -4 \u2192 divided by 3 \u2192 -1.333..., ceil is -1 \u2192 -1 *3 =-3. But -3 is still greater than -5. Wait, but that's better. Wait, let's compute:\n\nx_prev =-5, a_i=3. We need x_i >-5. The minimal multiple of 3 greater than -5 is -3 (since -3 is greater than -5). So, the formula would be:\n\nceil( (x_prev +1)/a_i ) \u2192 ( -5 +1 ) /3 \u2192 -4/3 \u2248-1.333 \u2192 ceil is -1 \u2192 -1 *3 =-3. Which is correct. Another example: x_prev =-6, a_i=3. Then x_i must be >-6. The minimal is -3 (since -3 is the first multiple of 3 after -6). Using the formula: ( -6 +1 ) /3 \u2192 -5/3 \u2248-1.666 \u2192 ceil is -1 \u2192 -1*3 =-3. Yes. Another case: x_prev =-3, a_i=3. Then x_i must be >-3. The minimal is 0 (0 is a multiple of 3 and greater than -3). Formula: ( -3 +1 ) /3 \u2192 -2/3 \u2192 ceil is -0.666 \u2192 ceil is -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0*3=0. Wait, (x_prev +1) is -2 \u2192 divided by 3 \u2192 -0.666..., ceil is -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0*3=0. Yes. So the formula works. Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number, like -infinity). Wait, but for the first element, the previous is -infinity. Wait, for the first element (i=1), the minimal x_i is the smallest multiple of a_1 that is greater than -infinity. But that's any multiple. To minimize steps, we need to choose the closest to zero. Wait, but according to the formula, for the first element, x_prev is -infinity. Wait, perhaps we need to handle the first element specially.",

So for the first element, required is -infinity +1 \u2192 which is still -infinity. Hmm, so for the first element, the formula would not work. Hence, the first element must be handled separately. The first element can be set to 0 (k=0, steps 0). Then, for the second element, required is 0+1 =1. So for the second element, a_i is a[1], and so on.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b increasing. The moves allowed are adding or subtracting a_i from b_i each time. Wait, but initially all b_i are zero. So each move on i either adds or subtracts a_i to b_i. The goal is to have b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n with the least number of moves.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves dynamic programming or some greedy method. Let me think. Since each step can adjust b_i by \u00b1a_i, but each move counts as one step. So for each position, we need to choose how much to add or subtract such that the sequence is increasing, and the total steps (sum of absolute changes divided by a_i?) Wait, no. Wait, each move is a single addition or subtraction. So for each b_i, the total moves needed would be the number of times you add or subtract a_i. Wait, no. Wait, each time you choose to add or subtract a_i, each such choice is a move. So for example, if you add a_i once, that's one move. Subtract twice, that's two moves. So the total moves for b_i is the absolute value of (b_i's final value divided by a_i?), but since each step is adding or subtracting a_i, the total moves for b_i is |(final b_i - initial 0)/a_i|. Because each step contributes \u00b1a_i. So the total moves for each b_i is |b_i| / a_i, but since each step is a single move, the total moves is exactly |b_i| / a_i? Wait, no. Wait, each move is either adding or subtracting a_i once. So the total number of moves for b_i is the number of times you added or subtracted. So if the final b_i is k * a_i, then the number of moves is |k|. Because each step contributes \u00b1a_i, so to reach k*a_i, you need |k| steps. So the total moves is the sum over all i of |k_i|, where k_i is the number of times you added (positive) or subtracted (negative) a_i. \n\nBut the problem is to choose these k_i such that the resulting b_i = sum_{steps} (each step's contribution) must form an increasing sequence. Since each step for i can be adding or subtracting, but the total for each i is k_i * a_i. So the problem reduces to choosing integers k_1, k_2,...,k_n such that:\n\nb_1 = k_1 * a_1 < b_2 = k_2 * a_2 < ... < b_n = k_n * a_n,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nHmm, how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track the minimal steps required up to each position, given the previous value.\n\nLet me think of the constraints. For each i, the current b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. Since the initial b is all zero, but we can adjust each b_i by multiples of a_i. Let's see.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required b array. Let's denote the desired b array as x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, where each x_i must be equal to some multiple of a_i (since each move adds or subtracts a_i, so x_i must be a multiple of a_i). Wait, no. Wait, each move on i adds or subtracts a_i once. So the total for x_i is the initial 0 plus the sum of all the moves (each move contributes \u00b1a_i). So x_i must be equal to (k_i) * a_i, where k_i is an integer (could be positive or negative). So yes, x_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nTherefore, the problem is to choose integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nk_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 < ... < k_n * a_n,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding such a sequence of k_i's with minimal sum of absolute values, under the constraints that each term is strictly increasing.\n\nHmm, how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can model this greedily, starting from the first element and moving forward, adjusting each k_i to satisfy the constraints while keeping the sum minimal.\n\nAlternatively, dynamic programming might be the way to go. Let's think of DP[i][v] as the minimal steps up to the i-th element, where the i-th element's value is v. But since a_i can be up to 1e9, this is not feasible for large n (n up to 5000). So that's probably not the way.\n\nAnother approach: since the sequence must be strictly increasing, each x_i must be at least x_{i-1} + 1. So for each i, x_i must be at least x_{i-1} + 1. But x_i must also be a multiple of a_i. So perhaps we can model this as a chain of constraints.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the previous term. Let's denote x_{i} must be at least x_{i-1} + 1, and x_i must be a multiple of a_i. So for each i, given x_{i-1}, the minimal possible x_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than x_{i-1} + 1. Alternatively, the minimal x_i could be the first multiple of a_i that is larger than x_{i-1} + 1. But since we can choose to go higher, but that would require more steps, so to minimize the total steps, we need to choose the minimal possible x_i that satisfies the constraints.\n\nWait, but the steps are the sum of |k_i|. So the k_i's can be positive or negative. So perhaps the minimal steps would be achieved by choosing x_i as close as possible to x_{i-1} + 1, but also as close to zero as possible (since that reduces |k_i|).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the first example given in the problem:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output: 4.\n\nThe example's solution is to set b1 = -1 (so k1 = -1, steps 1), b2=0 (k2=0, steps 0), b3=3 (k3=1, steps 1), b4=4 (k4=1, steps 1), b5=5 (k5=1, steps 1). Total steps 1+0+1+1+1 =4. \n\nWait, but how does that sequence work? Let's see:\n\n-1 < 0 < 3 <4 <5. Yes. The steps are indeed 1 (for k1), 0 (k2), 1 (k3), 1 (k4), 1 (k5). Sum is 4.\n\nSo the approach here was to set each x_i as the minimal possible value that is just above the previous, but also trying to keep the k_i as small as possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to model this is to work backwards. Let me think of the last element. Since the sequence must be increasing, the last element can be as small as possible, but each previous element must be less than it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this by starting from the end and working backwards, ensuring that each step is as small as possible. \n\nLet me think of the problem in reverse. Let's start from the end and go backward. \n\nSuppose we have the last element x_n. To minimize the total steps, we want x_n to be as small as possible, but also such that x_{n-1} < x_n, and so on. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution can be found by greedily choosing each x_i as the minimal possible value that satisfies the constraints given the previous x_{i-1}.\n\nWait, but how do we track this?\n\nLet me think of the process step by step. Let's start with x_1. Since there's no prior element, x_1 can be any multiple of a_1. But to minimize steps, we want x_1 as close to 0 as possible. However, the next elements must be larger than x_1. \n\nWait, but the next elements have their own constraints. So perhaps the best way is to model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each position i, we track the minimal steps required given that the current x_i is at least some value. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: \n\nWe can model the problem by ensuring that for each i, x_i is the minimal possible value that is at least x_{i-1} + 1 and a multiple of a_i. But since x_i can be negative, perhaps we need to adjust this.\n\nWait, but the minimal steps would require that x_i is as close as possible to x_{i-1} + 1, but also as close to zero as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x_i is the smallest possible value that is greater than x_{i-1} and a multiple of a_i. But since x_i must be strictly greater than x_{i-1}, the minimal x_i would be the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than x_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me see:\n\nSuppose x_{i-1} is 0, and a_i is 3. Then the minimal x_i would be 3 (so k_i=1, steps 1). But if x_{i-1} is 1, then the minimal x_i would be 3 (since 3>1). \n\nAlternatively, if a_i is 2 and x_{i-1} is 1, then the minimal x_i is 2 (k_i=1, steps 1). \n\nHmm, but this approach would work if we can set each x_i to the minimal possible value given the previous x_{i-1}. But how do we track the minimal steps?\n\nWait, but the steps are the sum of |k_i|. So if x_i is as small as possible, but also as close to zero as possible, that might be better. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system of inequalities and then solved with some greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of the variables:\n\nWe need x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n, where x_i = k_i * a_i.\n\nThe goal is to minimize sum |k_i|.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nStart from the first element. Let's set x_1 as close to 0 as possible. But then x_2 must be greater than x_1, so x_2 must be at least x_1 + 1. But x_2 must be a multiple of a_2. So the minimal x_2 would be the smallest multiple of a_2 that is greater than x_1. \n\nBut this depends on x_1. So perhaps we can model this as a chain of constraints, and find the minimal steps by choosing each x_i in a way that minimizes the total steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by working backwards. Let me think of the last element first. \n\nSuppose we start from the end. Let's denote that x_n can be any multiple of a_n. To minimize steps, we want x_n as close to zero as possible, but also considering the constraints from the previous elements. \n\nWait, but the previous elements must be less than x_n. So perhaps the optimal approach is to set x_n to be as small as possible, but then x_{n-1} must be less than x_n, and so on. \n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let me think of the problem in terms of the minimal required increments.\n\nAnother idea: Let's model the problem by considering that each x_i must be at least x_{i-1} + 1. So the minimal possible x_i is x_{i-1} + 1. But since x_i must be a multiple of a_i, the minimal x_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is >= (x_{i-1} + 1). \n\nBut this would give us a way to compute x_i step by step, starting from x_1. However, this might not be optimal in terms of the total steps, because choosing a larger x_i might allow for smaller steps in later terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are achieved by choosing each x_i as the minimal possible value given the previous x_{i-1}, but this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system where we can express each x_i in terms of x_{i-1}, and then find the minimal steps through dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the minimal steps required up to the i-th element, along with the value of x_i. But since x_i can be very large, this is not feasible for n=5000. \n\nHmm, but maybe we can track the minimal steps and the current x_i in a way that allows us to represent it with some variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by greedily choosing each x_i as the minimal possible value given the previous x_{i-1}, but adjusted to minimize the steps. \n\nWait, here's another approach inspired by the problem's constraints. Let's consider that for each i, the minimal steps would be achieved by choosing x_i as close as possible to x_{i-1} + 1, but also as close to zero as possible. \n\nWait, but how do we balance between the two? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nWe can model the required x_i as follows. Let's start from the first element. Let x_1 can be any multiple of a_1. To minimize steps, we want x_1 as close to 0 as possible. But then x_2 must be at least x_1 +1, and a multiple of a_2. \n\nSuppose we choose x_1 as 0 (if possible). Then x_2 must be at least 1. The minimal x_2 would be the smallest multiple of a_2 >=1. \n\nBut if a_2 is 2, then x_2 can be 2 (steps 1). \n\nBut then x_3 must be at least 3, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing x_1 as negative could allow for smaller steps in later terms. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too vague. Let me think of the problem in terms of the required constraints and how to model it.\n\nLet me think of the variables:\n\nWe have x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n, with x_i = k_i * a_i.\n\nThe total steps are sum |k_i|.\n\nWe need to minimize this sum.\n\nLet me consider the variables k_i. \n\nThe constraints are:\n\nk_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 < ... < k_n * a_n.\n\nWe can rewrite each inequality as:\n\nk_{i} * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1} \n\nfor all i from 2 to n.\n\nWe need to find integers k_i (can be positive or negative) that satisfy these inequalities, and minimize the sum of |k_i|.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem where for each step, we track the minimal steps and the current value of x_i. \n\nLet me think of DP[i][v] as the minimal steps up to the i-th element, where the current x_i is v. But since v can be very large, this is not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track the minimal steps and the current x_i in terms of the previous x_{i-1}. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints. Let's process the elements from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, given the previous x_{i-1}, we need to choose x_i such that x_i > x_{i-1}, and x_i is a multiple of a_i. The minimal steps would be the minimal |k_i| for x_i, plus the previous steps. \n\nBut how do we track this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the state as the current x_i, but since x_i can be large, this is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to model this with some mathematical formula. Let me think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps for each position given the previous x_{i-1}.\n\nSuppose we have x_{i-1} fixed. Then, the minimal steps for x_i would be the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i > x_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i such that k_i * a_i > x_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but k_i can be positive or negative. \n\nWait, the minimal |k_i| would be achieved by the closest multiple of a_i to x_{i-1} + 1, but greater than x_{i-1}. \n\nWait, let me think of the possible k_i. \n\nWe need k_i * a_i > x_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the ceiling of (x_{i-1} +1)/a_i (if a_i is positive, which it is) and the floor of (x_{i-1} +1)/a_i, but that might not be positive. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > x_{i-1}. \n\nSo, the minimal k_i is ceil( (x_{i-1} +1)/a_i ), but since a_i is positive, this is the minimal k_i. \n\nWait, but k_i can be negative. For example, if x_{i-1} is very negative, then even a negative k_i could satisfy the condition. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i in absolute value such that k_i * a_i > x_{i-1}. \n\nSo, for each possible x_{i-1}, we can compute the minimal k_i and the corresponding steps. \n\nBut how do we track this over all steps?\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that the optimal solution can be found by greedily choosing each x_i as the minimal possible value that satisfies the constraints, which would minimize the steps. \n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nStart with x_0 = -infinity (since there's no element before the first). \n\nFor the first element, x_1 must be a multiple of a_1. To minimize steps, we choose x_1 as close to 0 as possible. \n\nWait, but the first element has no constraints except that it must be less than x_2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first element can be set to 0 (if possible), but then x_2 must be at least 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are achieved by setting each x_i as the minimal possible value given the previous x_{i-1}, but also as close to zero as possible. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's sample:\n\nLet me think of the process as follows:\n\nWe can model the problem by starting from the first element and moving forward, keeping track of the minimal steps and the current x_i. \n\nAt each step i, given the previous x_{i-1}, we need to choose x_i such that x_i > x_{i-1}, and x_i is a multiple of a_i. The minimal steps for this step would be the minimal |k_i| where k_i = x_i / a_i. \n\nTo minimize the total steps, we need to choose the x_i that is the closest possible to x_{i-1} + 1, but also as close to zero as possible. \n\nWait, but how do we balance between the two? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are achieved by choosing x_i as the smallest possible multiple of a_i that is greater than x_{i-1}. \n\nThis way, each step is as small as possible, which would minimize the steps. \n\nLet me see with the first example:\n\nSample Input 1: a = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nStarting with x_0 = -infinity (since there's no previous element before the first). \n\nFor the first element (i=1), since there's no previous, x_1 can be any multiple of 1. To minimize steps, set x_1 as close to 0 as possible. The minimal steps would be 0 (k=0). But then x_2 must be >0. \n\nWait, but in the sample solution, they set x_1 to -1 (k=-1, steps 1). \n\nHmm, so maybe that approach isn't correct. \n\nWait, in the sample solution, the first element is set to -1. Let's see why that might be better. \n\nSuppose for the first element, choosing x_1 = -1 (k=-1, steps 1). Then x_2 must be >-1. The minimal x_2 would be 0 (k=0, steps 0). Then x_3 must be >0. The minimal x_3 is 3 (k=1, steps 1). Then x_4 must be >3, so 4 (k=1, steps 1). x_5 must be >4, so 5 (k=1, steps 1). Total steps 1+0+1+1+1 =4. \n\nAlternatively, if we set x_1 to 0 (steps 0), then x_2 must be at least 1. The minimal x_2 is 2 (k=1, steps 1). Then x_3 must be >2. The minimal is 3 (steps 1). x_4 must be >3, so 4 (steps 1). x_5 must be >4, so 5 (steps 1). Total steps 0+1+1+1+1 =4. Same total. \n\nHmm, so in this case, both approaches give the same total. \n\nAnother example: suppose a = [3, 1]. \n\nThe minimal steps would be?\n\nPossible options:\n\nOption 1: x1 =0 (steps 0). Then x2 must be >0. The minimal is 1 (steps 1). Total steps 1. \n\nOption 2: x1 =-3 (steps 1). x2 must be >-3. The minimal is 0 (steps 0). Total steps 1. \n\nEither way, the total is 1. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal steps can be achieved by choosing x_i as the minimal possible (either positive or negative) as long as it's just above the previous x_{i-1}. \n\nSo the key is to choose x_i as the smallest possible multiple of a_i that is greater than x_{i-1}. \n\nThis way, each step is as small as possible, leading to minimal steps. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number). \n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n   Find the minimal x_i such that x_i is a multiple of a_i, and x_i > x_prev. \n\n   The minimal steps for this step is |x_i / a_i|. \n\n   Update x_prev to x_i. \n\nWait, but how do we compute x_i?\n\nThe minimal x_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than x_prev. \n\nSo, the minimal x_i is ceil( (x_prev + 1)/a_i ) * a_i. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose x_prev is 0, a_i is 2. \n\nThen the minimal x_i is 2 (since 2>0). \n\nYes, ceil( (0+1)/2 ) = 1, so 1*2=2. \n\nAnother example: x_prev is 1, a_i is 3. \n\nThen the minimal x_i is 3 (since 3>1). \n\nYes, ceil( (1+1)/3 ) = ceil(2/3) =1 \u2192 3. \n\nAnother example: x_prev is 4, a_i is 3. \n\nThen minimal x_i is 6 (since 6>4). \n\nYes, ceil( (4+1)/3 ) = ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 2*3=6. \n\nHmm, that formula works. \n\nSo the minimal x_i is ceil( (x_prev +1)/a_i ) * a_i. \n\nWait, but what if x_prev is negative?\n\nSuppose x_prev is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen the minimal x_i is 0 (since 0 >-5). \n\nWait, 0 is a multiple of 3 (0 =0*3). \n\nSo, (x_prev +1) is -4 \u2192 divided by 3 \u2192 -1.333..., ceil is -1 \u2192 -1 *3 =-3. But -3 is still greater than -5. \n\nWait, but that's better. \n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nx_prev =-5, a_i=3. \n\nWe need x_i >-5. \n\nThe minimal multiple of 3 greater than -5 is -3 (since -3 is greater than -5). \n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nceil( (x_prev +1)/a_i ) \u2192 ( -5 +1 ) /3 \u2192 -4/3 \u2248-1.333 \u2192 ceil is -1 \u2192 -1 *3 =-3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: x_prev =-6, a_i=3. \n\nThen x_i must be >-6. The minimal is -3 (since -3 is the first multiple of 3 after -6). \n\nUsing the formula: ( -6 +1 ) /3 \u2192 -5/3 \u2248-1.666 \u2192 ceil is -1 \u2192 -1*3 =-3. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: x_prev =-3, a_i=3. \n\nThen x_i must be >-3. The minimal is 0 (0 is a multiple of 3 and greater than -3). \n\nFormula: ( -3 +1 ) /3 \u2192 -2/3 \u2192 ceil is -0.666 \u2192 ceil is -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0*3=0. \n\nWait, (x_prev +1) is -2 \u2192 divided by 3 \u2192 -0.666..., ceil is -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0*3=0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the formula works. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number, like -infinity). \n\nWait, but for the first element, the previous is -infinity. \n\nWait, for the first element (i=1), the minimal x_i is the smallest multiple of a_1 that is greater than -infinity. \n\nBut that's any multiple. To minimize steps, we need to choose the closest to zero. \n\nWait, but according to the formula, for the first element, x_prev is -infinity. \n\nWait, perhaps we need to handle the first element specially. \n\nWait, the first element has no constraints except that it must be less than x_2. \n\nBut to minimize steps, the first element's x_1 should be as close to zero as possible. \n\nWait, but according to the formula, when x_prev is -infinity, then (x_prev +1)/a_1 is -infinity, so ceil(-infinity) is -infinity, but that's not helpful. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the first element's x_1 can be chosen as 0 (if possible). \n\nWait, but the first element can be any multiple of a_1. \n\nThe minimal steps for the first element is |k_1|, so the minimal is 0 (k=0). \n\nSo x_1 =0. \n\nThen, for the second element, x_2 must be greater than 0. \n\nSo the formula would work for the second element. \n\nBut in the first example, the sample solution chose x_1 as -1 (steps 1) instead of 0 (steps 0). \n\nWait, but in that case, the total steps were the same. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the first element can be set to 0, but then the second element's steps would be higher. \n\nWait, let's see the first example again. \n\nIf first element is 0 (steps 0), then second element must be >0. \n\na_2 is 2. \n\nThe minimal x_2 is 2 (steps 1). \n\nThen third element must be >2. a_3 is 3 \u2192 minimal x_3 is 3 (steps 1). \n\nFourth element must be >3 \u21924 (steps 1). \n\nFifth must be >4 \u21925 (steps 1). \n\nTotal steps: 0+1+1+1+1 =4, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the first approach works. \n\nSo the algorithm can proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number like -1e18). \n\nWait, but for the first element, the minimal x_i is the smallest multiple of a_1 that is greater than x_prev (which is -infinity). \n\nThe minimal multiple would be the closest to zero. \n\nWait, but the minimal multiple in terms of absolute value would be 0. \n\nSo for the first element, x_1 is 0 (k=0, steps 0). \n\nThen proceed as per the formula for the rest. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number like -1e18). \n\nsteps =0 \n\nfor i from 1 to n:\n\n    a_i = a[i]\n\n    if i ==1:\n\n        x_i =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        required = x_prev +1 \n\n        # find the minimal multiple of a_i greater than required \n\n        # compute k = ceil( (required) / a_i )\n\n        # since a_i is positive, \n\n        k = (required + a_i -1 ) // a_i \n\n        x_i = k * a_i \n\n    steps += abs( x_i / a_i )\n\n    x_prev = x_i \n\nWait, but division here must be integer division. \n\nWait, x_i must be exactly k * a_i. \n\nWait, the formula for k is ceil( (required)/a_i ), where required is x_prev +1. \n\nSo required = x_prev +1 \n\nk = ceil( required / a_i )\n\nx_i = k * a_i \n\nYes. \n\nSo for the first element, required is -infinity +1 \u2192 which is still -infinity. \n\nHmm, so for the first element, the formula would not work. \n\nHence, the first element must be handled separately. \n\nThe first element can be set to 0 (k=0, steps 0). \n\nThen, for the second element, required is 0+1 =1. \n\nSo for the second element, a_i is a[1], and so on. \n\nWait, but in code, the indices might be 0-based or 1-based. \n\nAssuming the array a is 0-based, then for i from 0 to n-1:\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number like -1e18). \n\nsteps =0 \n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    a_i = a[i]\n\n    if i ==0:\n\n        x_i =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        required = x_prev +1 \n\n        k = ceil( required / a_i )\n\n        x_i = k * a_i \n\n    steps += abs( x_i // a_i )\n\n    x_prev = x_i \n\nWait, but in code, how to compute ceil( required / a_i )?\n\nIn Python, ceil(a/b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b when b is positive. \n\nYes. \n\nSo required = x_prev +1 \n\nk = (required + a_i -1) // a_i \n\nx_i = k * a_i \n\nYes. \n\nSo this would work. \n\nNow, let's test this with the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0 (a_i=1):\n\nx_i =0 \n\nsteps +=0 \u2192 steps=0 \n\nx_prev =0 \n\ni=1 (a_i=2):\n\nrequired =0+1=1 \n\nk = (1 +2-1)/2 \u2192 (2)/2 =1 \u2192 x_i=2 \u2192 steps +=1 \u2192 steps=1 \n\nx_prev=2 \n\ni=2 (a_i=3):\n\nrequired =2+1=3 \n\nk = (3+3-1)/3 \u21925/3=1.666 \u2192 floor is 1 \u2192 but wait, (3+3-1)=5 \u21925//3=1.666 \u2192 integer division gives 1. \n\nWait, 5//3 is 1. So k=1 \u2192 x_i=3 \u2192 steps +=1 \u2192 steps=2 \n\nx_prev=3 \n\ni=3 (a_i=4):\n\nrequired =3+1=4 \n\nk=(4+4-1)/4 \u21927//4=1.75 \u21921 \u2192 1*4=4 \u2192 steps +=1 \u2192 steps=3 \n\nx_prev=4 \n\ni=4 (a_i=5):\n\nrequired=4+1=5 \u2192 (5+5-1)/5 \u21929//5=1.8 \u21921 \u2192 5 \u2192 steps +=1 \u2192 total 4. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSample Input 2: \n\nn=3, a = [3,1,2]\n\nWait, but the sample output for example 2 is not given, but let's see. \n\nWait, the second example's note says that there are 24 possible trees, but that's for the second problem. \n\nHmm, perhaps I can think of another example. \n\nSuppose n=2, a = [2,3]. \n\nThe minimal steps would be:\n\nFirst element can be 0 (steps 0). \n\nSecond must be >0. The minimal is 3 (steps 1). Total steps 1. \n\nAlternatively, first element could be -2 (steps 1), then second can be 0 (steps 0). Total steps 1. \n\nEither way, the minimal is 1. \n\nThe algorithm would choose first element 0, second 3 \u2192 steps 1. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: a = [5, 1]. \n\nFirst element 0. \n\nSecond must be >0 \u2192 minimal is 1 (steps 1). Total steps 1. \n\nAlternatively, first element could be -5 (steps 1), second 0 (steps 0). Total steps 1. \n\nEither way, the algorithm's approach gives the correct result. \n\nSo this approach seems correct. \n\nNow, looking at the code provided for program1.py, it's a bit unclear. The code has functions f, e, c, and some loops. \n\nThe code given for program1.py is:\n\ndef f(b, i):\n    return e(b[::-1], i)\n\ndef e(b, i):\n    if b == []:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    ggg = [0] * len(b)\n    for i in range(len(b)):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    return count\n\ndef c(b, i):\n    return e(b[i + 1:], 0) + f(b[:i], 0)\n\na = int(input())\nb = input().split()\nfor i in range(a):\n    b[i] = int(b[i])\nd = c(b, 1)\nfor i in range(2, a - 1):\n    d = min(d, c(b, i))\nprint(d)\n\nHmm, this code is quite confusing. The functions f and e are supposed to compute something, but the code is incomplete. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of moves. The code's structure suggests that it's trying to compute some kind of split, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering different splits of the array. \n\nThe function c(b, i) calls e on the part after i and f on the part before i. \n\nThe function f is e with the reversed array. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering different possible starting points. \n\nBut given that the correct approach is the greedy one I outlined earlier, perhaps the code provided is not the right approach, and the user is supposed to fill in the missing parts with the correct algorithm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to implement a dynamic programming approach, but it's not clear. \n\nGiven that the user's task is to fill in the missing code in program1.py and program2.py, I need to look at the code structure and see where the missing parts are. \n\nLooking at program1.py's code:\n\nIn the function e(b, i), there's a loop over i in range(len(b)), but the variable i is shadowing the parameter i. That's probably a mistake. \n\nThe code for e is incomplete. The loop is supposed to compute something, but the code is missing. \n\nThe function c(b, i) returns e(b[i+1:],0) + f(b[:i],0). \n\nThe main code calls c(b,1) and then iterates over other i's to find the minimal d. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to split the array into two parts and compute the minimal steps for each part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering different possible positions where the sequence can be adjusted. \n\nBut given that the correct approach is the greedy one, perhaps the code provided is not the right way to go, and the user is supposed to fill in the missing parts with the correct algorithm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem in reverse. \n\nWait, the function f(b, i) calls e on the reversed array. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps in both directions and combine them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem as a two-pointer approach. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the greedy algorithm I outlined earlier. \n\nBut how to fit that into the existing code structure? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is completely wrong and the user is supposed to rewrite it. \n\nBut the problem says to fill in the missing lines or blocks. \n\nLooking at the code for program1.py:\n\nThe code has functions f, e, c. \n\nThe main code reads the array a, then calls c(b,1), then iterates over other indices to find the minimal d. \n\nThe function c(b,i) returns e(b[i+1:],0) + f(b[:i],0). \n\nThe function f is e with the reversed array. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to split the array into two parts at position i, compute the minimal steps for the left part and the right part, then sum them. \n\nBut the minimal steps would be the sum of the left and right parts. \n\nBut how does this relate to the problem? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the i-th element as a pivot, and then compute the minimal steps for the left and right parts. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering different possible starting points. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem in a way that requires dynamic programming, and the missing parts are the DP transitions. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the greedy algorithm in the code. \n\nBut the existing code structure doesn't seem to align with that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by working backwards. \n\nLet me think of the code's structure again. \n\nThe function e(b, i) is supposed to compute something. The loop in e is over the elements of b, but the code is missing. \n\nThe function f is e applied to the reversed array. \n\nThe function c(b,i) splits the array into two parts: the part after i and the part before i (up to i). \n\nThe main code computes the minimal over different i's. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering different possible splits where the first part is processed in one way and the second in another. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem as a two-part problem where the first part is processed forward and the second part backward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem in a way that requires the array to be split into two parts, and the minimal steps are the sum of the two parts' steps. \n\nBut without knowing the intended approach of the code, it's hard to fill in the missing parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps using dynamic programming, where e and f are DP functions. \n\nThe function e(b, i) might be a DP function that computes the minimal steps for the array b starting from index i. \n\nBut the code is incomplete. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by greedily adjusting each element to be just above the previous one, but the code structure is not clear. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the correct algorithm and see how to implement it in the given code structure. \n\nThe correct algorithm is the greedy approach I outlined earlier. \n\nSo, to implement this, the code should process the array from left to right, keeping track of the previous x value and accumulating the steps. \n\nBut the existing code's structure doesn't seem to allow this. \n\nPerhaps the code is completely wrong and the user is supposed to rewrite it. \n\nBut the problem states that the user must fill in the missing lines or blocks. \n\nLooking at the code for program1.py:\n\nThe function e(b, i) has a loop over i in range(len(b)), but the parameter is also named i. That's a mistake. \n\nThe loop is supposed to compute something, but the code is missing. \n\nThe function e is supposed to return a count, which is the number of steps. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for the array b starting from index i. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for the array b in reverse. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for the array b in a way that requires dynamic programming. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to see the correct path here, perhaps I should proceed to the second problem and come back. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to count for each vertex i the number of trees where i is a centroid. \n\nThe tree is such that each node i (except root) has exactly one parent with a smaller index. So the tree is a rooted tree where each node's parent has a smaller index. \n\nThe centroid is a node whose removal leaves all subtrees with size \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nThe answer must be modulo 998244353. \n\nThe input is an odd n (3 \u2264 n < 2e5). \n\nThe output is n numbers, each the count for vertex i. \n\nThe code provided has some functions, but the inv function is missing. \n\nThe code starts by defining modmul, inv, and some precomputed factorials and inverse factorials. \n\nThe code then defines comb and invcomb functions. \n\nThe main part initializes out as an array of zeros. \n\nThen, for i in range((n+1)//2), it computes base as fact[n-1], and frac as modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)). \n\nThen, out[i] is set to modmul(base, frac). \n\nThen, there's a loop to compute rem and update out[i]. \n\nThe final output is printed. \n\nThe problem is to fill in the missing inv function. \n\nThe inv function is supposed to compute the modular inverse of x modulo 998244353. \n\nThe code for inv is missing. \n\nThe code for inv can be implemented using Fermat's little theorem, since MOD is a prime. \n\nThe inverse of x mod MOD is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD. \n\nSo the inv function can be written as:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut in Python, the pow function can handle this with three arguments. \n\nSo the missing code for inv is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nThat's straightforward. \n\nNow, back to program1.py. \n\nThe problem requires filling in the missing code in the functions e and f. \n\nThe code's structure is unclear, but perhaps the correct approach is to implement the greedy algorithm in the existing functions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem in a way that requires dynamic programming. \n\nThe function e(b, i) is supposed to compute something. \n\nThe code for e has a loop over the elements of b, but the code is missing. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for the array b starting from index i. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by working backwards. \n\nLet me think of the greedy approach again. \n\nThe algorithm is straightforward: \n\nInitialize x_prev = -infinity (or a very small number like -1e18). \n\nsteps =0 \n\nfor each a_i in the array a:\n\n    if it's the first element:\n\n        x_i =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        required = x_prev +1 \n\n        k = ceil(required / a_i) \n\n        x_i = k * a_i \n\n    steps += abs(k) \n\n    x_prev =x_i \n\nreturn steps \n\nThis is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 5000. \n\nSo the code for program1.py should implement this. \n\nBut the existing code's structure is different. \n\nThe code has functions f and e, which are supposed to compute parts of the solution. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by splitting the array into two parts and combining the results. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps in a way that requires dynamic programming. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to rewrite the code to implement the greedy algorithm. \n\nBut the problem requires filling in the missing parts of the given code. \n\nLooking at the code again:\n\nThe function e(b, i) has a loop over the elements of b. \n\nThe code for e is supposed to compute the minimal steps for the array b starting from index i. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for the array b in reverse. \n\nThe function f(b, i) calls e on the reversed array. \n\nThe function c(b, i) splits the array into two parts: the part after i and the part before i. \n\nThe main code computes the minimal over different i's. \n\nThis suggests that the code is trying to find the minimal steps by considering different split points. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem as a two-part problem where the first part is processed forward and the second part backward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps by considering the problem in a way that requires dynamic programming, and the missing code in e is the DP transition. \n\nBut without more information, it's hard to proceed. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for the array b starting from the end. \n\nThe function e(b, i) might be a DP function that returns the minimal steps for the subarray b starting at index i. \n\nThe loop in e is supposed to compute this. \n\nThe code for e is missing the part where it computes the steps. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for the subarray b starting at index i. \n\nThe loop in e is over the elements of b, but the code is missing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for the subarray b in reverse. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed to fill in the inv function for program2.py and then make an educated guess for program1's missing code. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing inv function is as I mentioned. \n\nFor program1.py, the missing code in the e function's loop is probably the core of the algorithm. \n\nThe function e(b, i) is supposed to compute the minimal steps for the array b starting from index i. \n\nThe loop in e is over the elements of b. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for the subarray b starting at index i. \n\nThe code for e might be something like:\n\ndef e(b, i):\n    if not b:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    prev = -float('inf')\n    for num in b:\n        required = prev + 1\n        k = (required + num - 1) // num\n        current = k * num\n        count += abs(k)\n        prev = current\n    return count\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to compute the steps for the array b in reverse. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the greedy algorithm in the existing functions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for the array in reverse, and the function e is for forward processing and f for backward. \n\nThe function e(b, i) might be processing the array from the start, and f is processing from the end. \n\nThe function c(b, i) splits the array into two parts and sums the steps from both parts. \n\nThe main code then tries different split points to find the minimal total steps. \n\nThis suggests that the minimal steps can be found by splitting the array into two parts at some index i, compute the steps for the left part forward and the right part backward, then sum them. \n\nThe minimal over all possible splits is the answer. \n\nThis approach might be necessary if the greedy approach isn't correct, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the greedy approach is correct and the code's structure is wrong, but the user is supposed to fill in the missing parts with the correct code. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to see the correct path, I'll proceed to fill in the inv function for program2.py and make an educated guess for program1's missing code. \n\nFor program1's missing code in the e function's loop:\n\nThe loop is supposed to compute the steps for the array b. \n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to track the previous value and accumulate the steps. \n\nThe code might look like this:\n\ndef e(b, i):\n    if not b:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    prev = -float('inf')\n    for num in b:\n        required = prev + 1\n        k = (required + num - 1) // num\n        current = k * num\n        count += abs(k)\n        prev = current\n    return count\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the previous element in the array. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this assumption. \n\nSo the missing code for program1's e function's loop is:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor num in b:\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nBut in the code's function e, the loop is over i in range(len(b)), but the parameter is also named i. \n\nWait, the function e has parameters (b, i), and inside the loop, it's using i as the loop variable. \n\nThis is a mistake. \n\nThe loop should be over the elements of b. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\ndef e(b, i):\n    if not b:\n        return 0\n    count =0\n    prev = -float('inf')\n    for num in b:\n        required = prev +1\n        k = (required + num -1) // num\n        current = k * num\n        count += abs(k)\n        prev = current\n    return count\n\nBut in the given code, the loop is written as:\n\nfor i in range(len(b)):\n\nso the loop variable is i, which shadows the parameter i. \n\nThis is a mistake. \n\nThe correct loop should iterate over the elements of b. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor num in b:\n\nBut the existing code uses a loop over indices. \n\nSo perhaps the code is:\n\nfor idx in range(len(b)):\n\n    num = b[idx]\n\n    # compute required, k, etc.\n\nThus, the missing code in the loop would be:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor idx in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[idx]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor idx in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[idx]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nBut the initial code has the loop as for i in range(len(b)), so the variable is i. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor i in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[i]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor i in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[i]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nBut the initial code's e function has count initialized to 0, and the loop is over i in range(len(b)), so this would fit. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1's e function is the loop's code. \n\nThe function f is e applied to the reversed array. \n\nThe function c(b,i) splits the array into two parts and sums the steps from both parts. \n\nThe main code then tries different split points to find the minimal total steps. \n\nThis approach might be correct. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1's e function is the loop's code as above. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code for program1 is the loop's code inside e, and for program2 is the inv function. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nFor program1's missing code in e's loop:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor i in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[i]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nBut in the code's e function, the initial code has:\n\ndef e(b, i):\n    if b == []:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    ggg = [0] * len(b)\n    for i in range(len(b)):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    return count\n\nSo the missing code is the loop's body. \n\nThe code inside the loop should be:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor i in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[i]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nBut the initial code has 'ggg' which is unused. \n\nPerhaps the code can be written as:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor i in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[i]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nThus, the missing code for program1's e function is the loop's body as above. \n\nThe function f is e applied to the reversed array. \n\nThe function c(b,i) splits the array into two parts and sums the steps from both parts. \n\nThe main code then tries different split points to find the minimal total steps. \n\nThis approach might be correct. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nFor program1's missing code in e's loop:\n\nprev = -float('inf')\ncount =0\nfor i in range(len(b)):\n    num = b[i]\n    required = prev +1\n    k = (required + num -1) // num\n    current = k * num\n    count += abs(k)\n    prev = current\n\nAnd for program2's inv function:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nThus, the JSON output would be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"prev = -float('inf')\\n    count = 0\\n    for i in range(len(b)):\\n        num = b[i]\\n        required = prev + 1\\n        k = (required + num - 1) // num\\n        current = k * num\\n        count += abs(k)\\n        prev = current\",\n    \"program2\": \"def inv(x):\\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}"
