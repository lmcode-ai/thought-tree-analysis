There's some code with Fenwick trees (pfen and nfen) and variables like dp[i], which probably represents the maximum value up to index i.\n\nLooking at the code's current state, in the loop for i in 1 to n:\n\nThe line dp[i] is set to the max of three options: (i + pfen's max up to ordpos[i]), (nfen's max up to n+1 - ordneg[i] minus i), and dmx.get(pref[i], -INF). \n\nThen, they update the Fenwick trees and the dmx dictionary. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" where they need to update dmx. Since dmx is supposed to track the maximum dp value for a given prefix sum, perhaps whenever a new dp[i] is better than the existing entry in dmx for that prefix, we need to update dmx[pref[i]] to dp[i]. \n\nWait, the line \"if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\" is there, so inside that, we should set dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]. That's probably the missing part here. Because dmx is supposed to keep track of the maximum dp value for each prefix sum. So that's the first missing code in program1.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem here is to find the minimal number of operations to get at least one copy of the array where all elements are equal. The operations allowed are cloning an array (which increases the number of copies by one) and swapping elements between any two copies (any positions, even same array).\n\nThe key here is to find the optimal way. Let's think: the minimal steps would involve using the most frequent element. Let's say the most frequent element occurs m times. Then, the minimal steps would be something like (n - m) swaps plus the number of clones needed. But how?\n\nWait, the process is a bit tricky. Let me think through the example given. The second test case had the array [0,1,3,3,7,0], so the most frequent elements are 0 (twice?), 3 (twice?), etc. Wait, in that example, the most common is 0 and 3 each appearing twice. So the minimal steps would involve creating enough copies so that we can gather all the required elements into one array.\n\nThe approach here is probably: the minimal number of operations is (n - m) + (number of clones needed). But how?\n\nThe number of clones required is (ceil((n - m)/m) )? Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEach time you clone, you get another copy. The swaps can move elements between copies. To get all elements in one array to be the same, say the target is the element with frequency m. The total number of elements needed is n (since each array is size n). The existing copies have m instances. Each clone doubles the number of copies, but perhaps the way to minimize steps is to first clone enough times so that the total number of copies allows us to collect all needed elements.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is (n - m) + (k - 1), where k is the number of clones needed. Wait, perhaps the formula is (n - m) + (ceil((n - m)/m) )? Or maybe the minimal steps are (n - m) + ( (n - m) // m ), but I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, the process is:\n\nThe initial array has one copy. To get all elements in one copy to be the target, you need to have enough copies so that the total number of target elements across all copies is at least n. Let's say the target occurs m times in the original array. Each clone doubles the number of copies. Wait no, each clone operation adds one copy. So after k clones, there are (1 + k) copies. The total number of target elements is m*(1 + k). To have m*(1 + k) >= n, so (1 +k) >= ceil(n/m). So the minimal k is ceil(n/m) -1. But each clone takes 1 operation. So the number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nThen, the swaps needed are (n - m) because each non-target element in the original array must be swapped out into other copies. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is (number of clones) + (number of swaps). The swaps needed are (n - m) because each non-target element must be moved out of the target array. But each swap can move two elements (since you can swap between any two copies). Wait, but each swap can exchange two elements. So perhaps the number of swaps needed is (n - m), but since each swap can handle two elements, maybe it's ceil((n - m)/1) ?\n\nWait, the problem says that in each swap operation, you can swap two elements from any two copies. So each swap can fix two elements. For example, if you have a non-target in copy A and a target in copy B, you can swap them, so that the target moves to A and the non-target to B. So each such swap reduces the number of non-target elements in the target array by 1. Wait, but the target array is one of the copies. So the total number of non-target elements in all copies is (total elements) - (number of targets in all copies). But the target array must have all elements as target. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal swaps required is exactly (n - m) because each non-target in the original array must be moved out. But since each swap can move one non-target into another array and bring a target in, each swap can handle one non-target. Wait, maybe each swap can handle two elements. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the target is T, which occurs m times in the original array. To get one array with all T's, you need to have enough copies so that the total T's across all copies is at least n. The minimal number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). Let's say after k clones, the total copies are (k+1). The total T's are m*(k+1) >= n. So k is the minimal such that m*(k+1) >=n \u2192 k = ceil(n/m) -1.\n\nThe number of clone operations is k. \n\nThen, the number of swaps needed is (n - m) because each non-T in the original array must be moved out of the target array. Wait, but how? Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have k clones, so total copies are (k+1). The target array is one of them. The other copies can be used to hold the non-T elements. Each non-T in the original array must be moved out of the target array. Each swap can move one non-T into another array and bring a T from another array. So each non-T requires one swap. So total swaps needed is (n - m). \n\nWait, but the total number of non-T elements is (n - m). Each such element must be moved out of the target array. Each swap can move one non-T out and bring a T in. So each non-T requires one swap. So total swaps are (n - m). \n\nThus, the total operations are (number of clones) + (swaps) \u2192 (k) + (n - m) = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the second test case has n=6, the array [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The most frequent elements are 0 (2 times) and 3 (2 times). Let's take 0 as the target. m=2. So ceil(6/2) is 3 \u2192 k = 3-1 =2 clones. So clones needed is 2. Then swaps needed are 6-2 =4. So total operations would be 2+4=6, which matches the example's answer of 6. \n\nAnother example: if all elements are already the same (m =n), then the answer is 0, which also fits. \n\nSo the formula is: \n\nIf the maximum frequency is m, then the minimal operations are (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements with the same maximum frequency? We need to choose the one with the highest m, so that the value is minimized. \n\nSo the steps for each test case are:\n\n- Find the frequency of the most common element(s). Let m be the maximum frequency.\n\n- Compute the required clones: (ceil(n/m) -1).\n\n- The total operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m).\n\nWait, but let me check another case. Suppose n=5, m=3. Then ceil(5/3) is 2 \u2192 clones needed 1. Then total operations 1 + (5-3)=3. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo the code for program2.py should be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read the array, count the frequencies. Find the maximum frequency m.\n\n- If m ==n \u2192 answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute k = ceil(n/m) -1 \u2192 which is (n//m) if n%m ==0 \u2192 (n/m -1). Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nceil(a / b) is (a +b -1) //b. So ceil(n/m) = (n + m -1) // m. So ceil(n/m) -1 = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1.\n\nThus, the clones needed is ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1.\n\nThen total operations is ( ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 ) + (n - m).\n\nWait, but let me see for the example where n=6, m=2:\n\n(6+2-1)/2 =7//2=3 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 clones. Then 2 + (6-2)=6 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=3 \u2192 (5+3-1)/3 \u21927//3=2 \u2192 2-1=1 \u2192 clones. 1 + (5-3)=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: n=4, m=3 \u2192 ceil(4/3)=2 \u2192 clones 1. 1 + (4-3)=2. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code for program2.py would be:\n\nRead n, a. \n\ncount = Counter(a).most_common(1)[0][1]\n\nif count ==n: print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    m = count\n\n    k = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\n    ans = k + (n - m)\n\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, but in the code given, the current code has:\n\ne,bb=Counter(a).most_common(1)[0]\n\nc = n - bb\n\nThen, while loop: while bb <n: ... but that's probably not needed. The code currently has a while loop that's commented out or not filled. \n\nThe original code in program2.py is:\n\nfor i in range(int(input())):\r\n    n=int(input())\r\n    a=input().split()\r\n    from collections import Counter\r\n\r\n    e,bb=Counter(a).most_common(1)[0]\r\n    c=n-bb\r\n    while bb<n:\r\n        # TODO: Your code here\r\n    print(c)\n\nWait, the code currently has a while loop that runs while bb <n, but the body is empty. The initial c is n - bb, which is the (n - m) part. But the code is missing the part where it calculates the clones. \n\nSo the correct code would replace the while loop with the calculation of k and the total. \n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nprint(c) which is (n - m). But that's not correct. The correct answer is (k + (n - m)), where k is the clones needed. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nAfter getting the maximum frequency (bb):\n\nif bb ==n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    k = ( (n + bb -1) // bb ) -1\n\n    ans = k + (n - bb)\n\n    print(ans)\n\nSo the missing code in program2.py is to replace the while loop and the print statement. \n\nSo the code for program2.py would be:\n\nfor i in range(int(input())):\r\n    n=int(input())\r\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # or input().split(), but better to convert to integers?\r\n    from collections import Counter\r\n    cnt = Counter(a)\r\n    e, bb = cnt.most_common(1)[0]\r\n    if bb == n:\r\n        print(0)\r\n    else:\r\n        m = bb\r\n        k = (n + m -1) // m -1\r\n        ans = k + (n - m)\r\n        print(ans)\n\nWait, but in the code given, the a is read as a.split(), but the elements are strings. Since the problem says the elements are integers, but the counts are based on their values. So using split() and keeping as strings is okay, as long as the counts are correct. \n\nSo the code in program2.py's missing part is to replace the while loop and the print statement. The original code has:\n\ne,bb=Counter(a).most_common(1)[0]\n\nc = n - bb\n\nwhile bb <n: ... \n\nprint(c)\n\nSo the correct code would remove the while loop and replace the print with the calculation. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is to replace the while loop and the print statement with the calculation of k and the answer. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing parts are:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is inside the if statement after checking if dp[i] is greater than the existing dmx value. The line should be dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i].\n\nFor program2.py, the code after getting e and bb is to compute the required k and the answer, and print that instead of c. So the code replaces the while loop and the print(c) with the calculation. \n\nSo the JSON should have:\n\n\"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n\"program2\": \n\nThe code after getting e and bb:\n\nif bb == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    m = bb\n    k = (n + m -1) // m -1\n    ans = k + (n - m)\n    print(ans)\n\nBut in the original code, the variables are e and bb. So the code would be:\n\ne, bb = ... \n\nif bb ==n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (n + bb -1) // bb -1\n    ans = k + (n - bb)\n    print(ans)\n\nSo the missing code for program2 is replacing the while loop and the print(c) with that code. \n\nTherefore, the JSON entries are:\n\nprogram1's missing code is the line inside the if statement: dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nprogram2's missing code is replacing the while loop and the print(c) with the code that calculates the answer as above. \n\nSo the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"if bb == n:\\n    print(0)\\nelse:\\n    k = (n + bb -1) // bb -1\\n    print(k + (n - bb))\"\n}\n\nWait, but in the problem's output format, the code should be the completion for the missing parts. The original program2 code has:\n\nwhile bb <n:\n    # TODO: Your code here\nprint(c)\n\nSo the missing code is to replace that entire block (the while loop and the print) with the code that calculates the answer. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nAfter getting e and bb:\n\nc = n - bb\n\nBut then, the code needs to compute the k and the answer. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be:\n\nThe original code has:\n\ne,bb=Counter(a).most_common(1)[0]\n\nc=n-bb\n\nwhile bb <n:\n    # TODO: Your code here\nprint(c)\n\nThe missing code is to replace the while loop and the print(c) with the code that calculates the answer. \n\nSo the correct code would be:\n\ne, bb = ... \n\nif bb == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (n + bb -1) // bb -1\n    print(k + (n - bb))\n\nHence, the missing code for program2 is:\n\nif bb == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (n + bb -1) // bb -1\n    print(k + (n - bb))\n\nSo the code replaces the while loop and the print(c) with this. \n\nTherefore, the JSON entries are as above."
