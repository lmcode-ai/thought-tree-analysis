For operation 1 on a non-special array:\n- Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+1].

Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is to replace G with B in both k and j. So the code for the first TODO (the part after if k == \"G\") is to set k to \"B\". Hence, the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\" So the code for the first if statement (k == G) is to set k to B. \n\nTherefore, the code for program2.py's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\" So the code after the first if k == \"G\" is to set k to B. So the code for the first part is:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    k = \"B\"\n\nThe second part (the j's G to B is already handled in the existing code. Wait, the existing code for j is:\n\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for the first part (k's G) is missing.

So putting it all together, the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\" So the code for the first if statement (k == G) is to set k to B. \n\nTherefore, the two missing parts are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nInside the loop over the elements of each array, the code computes the sum of x * (current+1), and increments current.

So the code inside the loop for x is:\n\nfor x in map(...):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nYes. So the code for program1's missing part is that loop. Now, to structure the answer as per the output format. The user wants the missing code for program1 and program2 as strings in a JSON. For program1.py, the missing code is inside the loop over the elements of each array. The code is:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nWait, but in the code given, the loop is written as:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code to fill in is the two lines inside the loop. So the code for program1's missing part is:\n\ntotal += x * (current + 1)\ncurrent += 1\n\nWait, but the loop is over x in the list. So the code inside the loop for each x is those two lines. Therefore, the code to be filled in is:\n\ntotal += x * (current + 1)\ncurrent += 1 So the code for program1's missing part is those two lines. For program2's missing part, the code is in the first if statement (k == G). The code is:\n\nk = \"B\" So the code for program2's missing part is that line. Therefore, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    total += x * (current + 1)\\n    current += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"        k = 'B'\"\n}\n\nWait, but the code for program2's missing part is inside the first if statement. The existing code has:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    # TODO: Your code here\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code to add is k = 'B' (with proper indentation). In the code given, the loop is indented under the for loop, which is inside the for i in test cases loop. The code for program2's missing part is the line k = 'B' inside the first if condition. So the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = 'B' But in Python, the string should have quotes. Since the code is inside a string, the single quotes need to be escaped or use double quotes. Wait, but in the code, the existing code uses single quotes. Looking at the existing code in program2.py:\n\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code uses double quotes. Alternatively, the code can use single quotes. The code for the first if statement (k == G) is:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    k = \"B\"\n\nSo the missing code is the line k = \"B\" inside the if block. Therefore, the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\" So the code to be filled in is that line. Therefore, the JSON entries are:\n\nprogram1's code is the two lines inside the for x loop. program2's code is the line k = \"B\" inside the first if block. Now, formatting the code as strings. For program1's code:\n\nThe lines are indented under the for x loop. The existing code has:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code to add is two lines, each indented with four spaces. The code would be:\n\n    total += x * (current + 1)\n    current += 1\n\nWait, but in the code given, the variables current and total are initialized before the loop. Yes. So the code for program1 is those two lines. For program2's code, the line is inside the first if block. The existing code has:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    # TODO: Your code here\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code to add is the line k = \"B\" inside the first if block. The line would be:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nWith proper indentation (four spaces). So the code for program2 is \"    k = \\\"B\\\"\" (with escaped quotes if using double quotes). Alternatively, since the existing code uses double quotes for the strings, the code can be written as:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is \"    k = \\\"B\\\"\". Putting it all together, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    total += x * (current + 1)\\n    current += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"    k = \\\"B\\ \"\"\n}\n\nWait, but in Python, the code for program2's line is inside the if block. The existing code's if block has no code, so adding the line k = \"B\" there. Yes. Therefore, the final answer is as above. Now, checking for any possible mistakes. For program1, the code computes the sum correctly.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first. \n\nThe problem is about finding the special array and the number of operation 2 used on it. The key here is to understand how the operations affect the arrays. \n\nSo, Eric starts with array b and creates n copies. The special array (c_k) uses operation 2, others use operation 1. Each operation modifies the array in a specific way. The challenge is to reverse-engineer which array is special and how many times op2 was applied.\n\nHmm, the operations for non-special arrays (op1) and special (op2) must leave some invariant or a difference that we can track. Let's think about the effect of each operation on some properties of the array.\n\nFor operation 1 on a non-special array (c_i where i\u2260k):\n- Choose i and j (2 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m-1)\n- Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+1]\nSo, the total sum of the array remains the same because we subtract 2 and add 2. But maybe some other sum or difference?\n\nFor operation 2 on the special array (c_k):\n- Choose i and j (2 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m-2)\n- Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+2]\nAgain, total sum remains same. But the difference here is that the j+2 part affects a different position compared to op1.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find some invariant that's different between the two operations. Let's think of some linear combination of the array elements that changes in a predictable way for each operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the sum of certain positions. Let me think of the effect on the array's differences or some cumulative sum.\n\nAnother approach: Since all arrays start from the same b, the differences between the arrays must be due to the operations applied. The key is that the special array uses op2, others use op1. Each operation on a non-special array (op1) affects positions i-1, i, j, j+1. For the special array's op2, it affects i-1, i, j, j+2.\n\nHmm, perhaps looking at the differences between the arrays. Let's think of each array's elements as being modified from the original b. The problem is to find which array's modifications can only be done via op2, and the count of those operations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of certain terms can help. Let me think of the sum of elements multiplied by some coefficients. For example, maybe considering the sum of elements multiplied by their indices, or some other pattern.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider the sum of the array elements multiplied by their positions. Let me see how each operation affects this sum.\n\nLet's denote S = sum_{x=1 to m} (c[x] * x). \n\nFor operation 1 on a non-special array:\n- Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+1].\nThe change in S would be:\n+1*(i-1) + 1*(j+1) - 1*i -1*j \n= (i-1 + j+1) - (i + j) \n= (i + j) - (i + j) = 0. So the sum S remains the same for op1.\n\nFor operation 2 on the special array:\n- Subtract 1 from c[i] and c[j], add 1 to c[i-1] and c[j+2].\nThe change in S would be:\n+1*(i-1) + 1*(j+2) -1*i -1*j \n= (i-1 + j+2) - (i + j) \n= (i + j +1) - (i + j) = +1. \n\nSo each op2 increases the sum S by 1. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So for the special array, each op2 adds 1 to S. But for non-special arrays, their op1 doesn't change S. \n\nBut all arrays started from the same b. So the original S for all arrays was the same. \n\nNow, after all operations, the non-special arrays have their S equal to the original S (since op1 doesn't change it). But the special array's S is original S plus the number of op2 operations (since each op2 adds 1). \n\nTherefore, the special array will have a higher S than the others. The difference between the special array's S and others' S is exactly the number of op2 operations. \n\nSo the plan is: For each array, compute S = sum(c[i] * i). The array with the maximum S is the special one, and the difference between its S and the minimum S (or others) gives the count of op2. Wait, but wait, the non-special arrays have S equal to the original S. The special array's S is original + op2_count. So the difference between the special array's S and any non-special array's S is exactly the op2_count. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute for each array the value of S (sum of c[i] * i). The array with the maximum S is the special one. The difference between its S and any other array's S (since others are same as original) is the number of op2 operations. \n\nWait, but how do we know that all non-special arrays have the same S? Because they started from the same b and their operations (op1) don't change S. So yes, all non-special arrays have S equal to the original S. The special array's S is original + op2_count. \n\nTherefore, the maximum S among all arrays is the special array's S. The difference between that and any non-special array's S is the op2 count. \n\nSo in code, for each test case, we can compute for each array the sum of (c[i] * (i's position)). The array with the maximum sum is the special one. The difference between that maximum and the minimum (or any other array's sum) is the count. \n\nWait, but the minimum could be the same as others. So the maximum is the special array. The difference between the maximum and any non-special array's sum is the count. \n\nTherefore, in the code for program1.py, inside the loop over the arrays, for each array, compute the sum of (element * its index). Then track the maximum sum and the array index. The special array is the one with the maximum sum, and the count is (max_sum - other_sum), where other_sum is any non-special array's sum. \n\nBut how do we get other_sum? Well, since all non-special arrays have the same sum, we can just take the minimum sum (since the non-special arrays all have the same sum, which is the original S, and the special array's sum is higher). Wait, no. The non-special arrays have the same S as each other. The special array's S is higher. So the minimum would be the S of non-special arrays. Wait, no. The minimum would be the same as all non-special arrays. So the maximum is the special array's S, and the minimum is the S of non-special arrays. So the difference between max and min is exactly the op2 count. \n\nTherefore, in code, for each array, compute the sum. Find the array with the maximum sum (that's the special one, k). The count is (max_sum - min_sum). \n\nWait, but the problem says that the special array is unique. So the maximum will be unique? Because if two arrays had higher sums, that would imply they are both special, but the problem states that there is exactly one. So the code can proceed this way. \n\nSo in the code for program1.py, the missing part is to compute the sum for each array. \n\nLooking at the code given for program1.py:\n\nIn the solve function, for each of the n arrays, they read the elements, and for each x in the array, they have a loop. The current code has a 'current' and 'total' variables, but the code inside the loop for x is missing. \n\nThe code is supposed to compute the sum of (element * its position). Wait, the positions are 1-based? Because in the problem statement, the arrays are 1-based. For example, in the first sample input, the array elements are given as c_{i,1}, c_{i,2}, etc. So the first element is index 1, second 2, etc. \n\nTherefore, for each element in the array (the list of m numbers), the position is from 1 to m. So for each element x in the array, the term is x * (its position). \n\nSo in the code, for each array, the total is the sum over all elements multiplied by their 1-based index. \n\nSo in the code, for each array's elements, the code should loop through the elements, and for each x (the element), multiply by its position (starting at 1), and accumulate that into total. \n\nWait, in the code's current structure, for each array (i in 0..n-1), they read the elements, and for each x in the list, they have a loop. The variables current and total are initialized to 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum for each array. Let me see:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current, total = 0, 0\n    for x in map(int, input().split()):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    mx = max(mx, (total, i))\n    mn = min(mn, (total, i))\n\nSo, the 'total' variable is supposed to hold the sum for that array. \n\nTherefore, the missing code inside the loop over x (each element in the array) should compute the sum of x multiplied by their 1-based index. \n\nWait, but how to track the index? Because in the loop, for each x in the list, the index (starting at 1) can be tracked by a counter. \n\nWait, in the inner loop, for each x in the list, the position is 1, 2, ..., m. So perhaps in the code, for each x in the list, we can track the position via a variable, like a counter starting at 1. \n\nAlternatively, since the elements are read in order, we can use enumerate. \n\nWait, in Python, when you loop over the elements with enumerate, you can get the index. But note that the first element is index 0 in the list, but the position is 1. So:\n\nfor idx, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):\n    pos = idx + 1\n    total += x * pos\n\nSo that's the code needed. \n\nTherefore, the missing code inside the loop over x is:\n\nfor idx, x in enumerate(map(...)):\n    pos = idx +1\n    total += x * pos\n\nBut in the current code, the loop is written as:\n\nfor x in map(...):\n    # code here\n\nSo to track the index, perhaps we need to have a variable that increments each time. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\npos = 1\nfor x in ...:\n    total += x * pos\n    pos +=1\n\nYes, that's better. \n\nSo inside the loop over the elements of the array (the for x in ... loop), the code should track the position. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncurrent, total = 0, 0\npos = 1\nfor x in map(...):\n    total += x * pos\n    pos +=1\n\nWait, but in the code given, the variables current and total are initialized to 0, but current is not used. Maybe current is a leftover variable. \n\nSo the code inside the loop for each array would be:\n\npos = 1\ntotal =0\nfor x in ...:\n    total += x * pos\n    pos +=1\n\nThen, the total is the sum for that array. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    total += x * pos\n    pos +=1\n\nWait, but how to track pos? Because in the code as written, the loop is:\n\nfor x in ...:\n    # code here\n\nSo the code needs to have a variable pos that starts at 1 and increments each time. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop for the array's elements would be:\n\npos = 1\ntotal =0\nfor x in map(...):\n    total += x * pos\n    pos +=1\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the variables current and total are initialized to 0. Maybe current is not needed. \n\nLooking back at the code given for program1.py:\n\nThe code inside solve() is:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current, total = 0, 0\n    for x in map(int, input().split()):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    mx = max(mx, (total, i))\n    mn = min(mn, (total, i))\n\nSo the 'total' variable is being used. So the code needs to compute the sum of x * pos for each element. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop over x should be:\n\npos = 1\ntotal =0\nfor x in ...:\n    total += x * pos\n    pos +=1\n\nWait, but in the code, the 'current' variable is initialized but not used. So perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nfor x in ...:\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nAh, that's better. Because current starts at 0, so current+1 gives the position. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncurrent, total = 0,0\nfor x in map(...):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nYes, that way, current starts at 0, so first element is 1, then 2, etc. \n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is:\n\ncurrent, total = 0,0\nfor x in map(...):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nWait, but in the code given, the variables current and total are already initialized to 0. So the code inside the loop for x would be:\n\nfor x in ...:\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py's missing part is:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nWait, but the loop is over x, and current is being used here. So the code inside the loop for each x is:\n\ncurrent starts at 0. For the first x (position 1), current is 0, so (current+1) is 1. Then current becomes 1. Next x is position 2, etc. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSo that's the code for program1.py. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to determine if two rows of a grid are considered the same by Vasya, who can't distinguish G and B. So, for each column, the two cells must be either the same, or one is G and the other is B (or vice versa). \n\nThe approach is to check for each column whether the two characters are either the same, or one is G and the other is B. \n\nWait, more precisely: For each position in the two rows, the two characters must be considered the same by Vasya. \n\nVasya can't tell G and B apart. So, for each column, the two cells must be either:\n\n- Both R, or \n\n- One is G and the other is B (since he sees both as the same), or \n\n- Both are G, or both B, or one G and the other B. \n\nWait, actually, any combination where if either is G or B, they are considered the same as long as they are both in the G/B group. So, for each column, the two characters must be either:\n\n- Both R, \n\n- Or both are G or B (so same in their group), \n\n- Or one is G and the other is B (since he can't tell them apart). \n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that Vasya can't distinguish G from B. So for him, G and B are the same. So, for each column, the two cells must be such that when we replace all G and B with a common symbol (like 'GB'), then the two rows are the same. \n\nSo, for each column, the two characters must be either:\n\n- Both R, \n\n- Or both are G or B (so same in their group), \n\n- Or one is G and the other is B. \n\nWait, actually, any combination where the two are either both R, or both in {G,B}. \n\nWait, more precisely, for each pair of characters (a, b) in the two rows' columns:\n\nIf a is R, then b must also be R. \n\nOtherwise (a is G or B), then b can be G or B. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nVasya sees G and B as the same. So for each column, the two cells must be such that when you replace G and B with the same symbol, the two rows are identical. \n\nSo, for each column, the two cells must be either:\n\n- Both R, \n\n- Or both are G or B (regardless of which exactly). \n\nWait, no. For example, if one is G and the other is B, then Vasya would see them as the same. So that's acceptable. \n\nSo the condition is: for each column, either:\n\n- Both are R, \n\nOR \n\n- At least one of them is G or B, and the other is also G or B. \n\nWait, more precisely, the two cells must be either both R, or both in {G,B}. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of examples. \n\nCase 1: first row's cell is G, second is B \u2192 acceptable. \n\nCase 2: first is G, second is G \u2192 acceptable. \n\nCase3: first is B, second is B \u2192 yes. \n\nCase4: first is R and second is G \u2192 no. \n\nSo the condition is: for each column, either both are R, or neither is R (i.e., both are G or B). \n\nSo for each pair (a, b) in the two rows' columns:\n\nif a == 'R' then b must be 'R'\n\nif b == 'R' then a must be 'R'\n\nOtherwise, it's okay (since they are G/B). \n\nAlternatively, the pair must satisfy that either (a == 'R' and b == 'R') or (a is not R and b is not R). \n\nSo the code for program2.py needs to check for each column whether this holds. \n\nThe code given for program2.py is:\n\nimport sys\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_arr = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    tc = int(input_arr[0])\n    pos = 1\n    for i in range(tc):\n        n, row1, row2 = input_arr[pos:pos + 3]\n        row1n, row2n = [], []\n        for k,j in zip(row1, row2):\n            if k == \"G\":\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            if j == \"G\":\n                j = \"B\"\n            row1n.append(k)\n            row2n.append(j)\n        print(\"YES\" if row1n == row2n else \"NO\")\n\n        pos += 3\n\nWait, the code is trying to process each test case. The variables n, row1, row2 are read from the input. \n\nBut the code has a loop over k and j in zip(row1, row2). For each pair of characters (k from row1, j from row2):\n\nThe code checks if k is G, but then does nothing. Then, if j is G, it sets j to B. \n\nWait, the idea here is probably to replace G with B in both rows so that they are considered the same. \n\nWait, the problem says that Vasya can't distinguish G and B, so perhaps we can replace all G's with B's (or vice versa) in both rows and then check if the rows are equal. \n\nAlternatively, for each character in the rows, we can map G and B to the same value (like 'B'), and then compare. \n\nSo, for each character in row1 and row2, replace G with B (or some common symbol), then check if the modified rows are equal. \n\nSo the code should process each row by replacing G with B (or B with G, but it doesn't matter as long as both are treated the same). \n\nLooking at the code given, in the loop over k and j (each pair of characters from the two rows):\n\nThe code has:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    # TODO: Your code here\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nThen appends k and j to row1n and row2n. \n\nWait, but the code is not modifying k. So for row1n, it's appending the original k. For row2n, it's replacing j's G with B. \n\nThis is not correct. \n\nThe correct approach is to replace all G's in both rows with B (or another symbol, but same for both). \n\nAlternatively, for each character in row1 and row2, we can map G to B, so that when comparing, G and B are treated the same. \n\nSo for each character in row1 and row2, we can do:\n\nk_modified = k if k == 'R' else 'B' \n\nSimilarly for j. \n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nFor each character in row1 and row2, we can replace G with B (or B with G, but the same for both). \n\nSo for row1's character k:\n\nif k is G \u2192 becomes B \n\nif it's B \u2192 stays B \n\nif R \u2192 stays R \n\nSimilarly for row2's j. \n\nThen, compare the modified rows. \n\nAlternatively, for each character, we can map G and B to the same value, like 'B', so that any G or B becomes B. \n\nSo the code should process each character in both rows as follows:\n\nfor k, j in zip(row1, row2):\n\n    # process k:\n    if k == 'G':\n        k_mod = 'B'\n    else:\n        k_mod = k \n\n    # process j similarly:\n    if j == 'G':\n        j_mod = 'B'\n    else:\n        j_mod = j \n\n    then append to row1n and row2n. \n\nThen, check if the modified rows are equal. \n\nAlternatively, the code can do this in a list comprehension. \n\nLooking back at the code's current structure, the code is trying to do something with G in row1 and row2. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor k,j in zip(row1, row2):\n    if k == \"G\":\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    if j == \"G\":\n        j = \"B\"\n    row1n.append(k)\n    row2n.append(j)\n\nSo the code is only replacing G in j (row2's character) with B. But not in k (row1's character). \n\nSo the missing code is to also replace G in k with B. \n\nTherefore, the code should have:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    k = \"B\"\n\nSimilarly for j. \n\nSo the code inside the loop should be:\n\nfor k,j in zip(row1, row2):\n    if k == 'G':\n        k = 'B'\n    if j == 'G':\n        j = 'B'\n    row1n.append(k)\n    row2n.append(j)\n\nThen, compare row1n and row2n. \n\nAlternatively, the code can process each character by replacing G with B. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO is to set k to 'B' when it's G. \n\nSo the code for the first part (k == G) is:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    k = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for program2.py's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo putting it all together, the code inside the loop for k and j would be:\n\nfor k,j in zip(row1, row2):\n    if k == \"G\":\n        k = \"B\"\n    if j == \"G\":\n        j = \"B\"\n    row1n.append(k)\n    row2n.append(j)\n\nThen, comparing the two lists. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program2.py is to replace G with B in both k and j. \n\nSo the code for the first TODO (the part after if k == \"G\") is to set k to \"B\". \n\nHence, the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for the first if statement (k == G) is to set k to B. \n\nTherefore, the code for program2.py's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code after the first if k == \"G\" is to set k to B. \n\nSo the code for the first part is:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    k = \"B\"\n\nThe second part (the j's G to B is already handled in the existing code. \n\nWait, the existing code for j is:\n\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for the first part (k's G) is missing. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to add the line k = \"B\" under the first if condition. \n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for the first TODO is to set k to B when it's G. \n\nTherefore, the code for program2's missing part is that line. \n\nSo putting it all together, the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for the first if statement (k == G) is to set k to B. \n\nTherefore, the two missing parts are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nInside the loop over the elements of each array, the code computes the sum of x * (current+1), and increments current. \n\nThe code for program1's missing part is:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nWait, but in the code given, the variables current and total are initialized to 0. So the code inside the loop for x is:\n\nfor x in map(...):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nYes. \n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is that loop. \n\nNow, to structure the answer as per the output format. \n\nThe user wants the missing code for program1 and program2 as strings in a JSON. \n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is inside the loop over the elements of each array. The code is:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    total += x * (current +1)\n    current +=1\n\nWait, but in the code given, the loop is written as:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code to fill in is the two lines inside the loop. \n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is:\n\ntotal += x * (current + 1)\ncurrent += 1\n\nWait, but the loop is over x in the list. So the code inside the loop for each x is those two lines. \n\nTherefore, the code to be filled in is:\n\ntotal += x * (current + 1)\ncurrent += 1\n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is those two lines. \n\nFor program2's missing part, the code is in the first if statement (k == G). The code is:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is that line. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    total += x * (current + 1)\\n    current += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"        k = 'B'\"\n}\n\nWait, but the code for program2's missing part is inside the first if statement. The existing code has:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    # TODO: Your code here\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code to add is k = 'B' (with proper indentation). \n\nIn the code given, the loop is indented under the for loop, which is inside the for i in test cases loop. \n\nThe code for program2's missing part is the line k = 'B' inside the first if condition. \n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = 'B'\n\nBut in Python, the string should have quotes. Since the code is inside a string, the single quotes need to be escaped or use double quotes. Wait, but in the code, the existing code uses single quotes. \n\nLooking at the existing code in program2.py:\n\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code uses double quotes. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use single quotes. \n\nThe code for the first if statement (k == G) is:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    k = \"B\"\n\nSo the missing code is the line k = \"B\" inside the if block. \n\nTherefore, the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code to be filled in is that line. \n\nTherefore, the JSON entries are:\n\nprogram1's code is the two lines inside the for x loop. \n\nprogram2's code is the line k = \"B\" inside the first if block. \n\nNow, formatting the code as strings. \n\nFor program1's code:\n\nThe lines are indented under the for x loop. The existing code has:\n\nfor x in map(int, input().split()):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code to add is two lines, each indented with four spaces. \n\nThe code would be:\n\n    total += x * (current + 1)\n    current += 1\n\nWait, but in the code given, the variables current and total are initialized before the loop. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code for program1 is those two lines. \n\nFor program2's code, the line is inside the first if block. The existing code has:\n\nif k == \"G\":\n    # TODO: Your code here\nif j == \"G\":\n    j = \"B\"\n\nSo the code to add is the line k = \"B\" inside the first if block. \n\nThe line would be:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nWith proper indentation (four spaces). \n\nSo the code for program2 is \"    k = \\\"B\\\"\" (with escaped quotes if using double quotes). \n\nAlternatively, since the existing code uses double quotes for the strings, the code can be written as:\n\nk = \"B\"\n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is \"    k = \\\"B\\\"\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    total += x * (current + 1)\\n    current += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"    k = \\\"B\\\"\"\n}\n\nWait, but in Python, the code for program2's line is inside the if block. The existing code's if block has no code, so adding the line k = \"B\" there. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is as above. \n\nNow, checking for any possible mistakes. \n\nFor program1, the code computes the sum correctly. \n\nFor program2, the code now replaces G with B in both rows, so that when comparing, G and B are treated the same. \n\nYes, that should work. \n\nAnother test case example: \n\nIn the third test case's note, all cells are G in one row and B in the other. After replacing G with B, both rows become all B, so they are equal \u2192 output YES. \n\nAnother example: if row1 is \"G\" and row2 is \"B\", after replacement, both are B \u2192 same \u2192 YES. \n\nIf row1 is \"R\" and row2 is \"G\", then after replacement, row1's R stays, row2 becomes B \u2192 different \u2192 NO. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nTherefore, the JSON is correct."
