Alternatively, we can track the minimal possible value of b_i given the previous constraints. Let me think of the following greedy approach:\n\nWe can process the elements from left to right, and for each step, choose the smallest possible b_i that is a multiple of a_i and greater than the previous b_{i-1}. This would minimize the current b_i, thus possibly leading to a minimal total. Let me see with the first example:\n\na = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nProcessing first element:\n\nb_1 can be 0 (x=0). Second element must be >0 and multiple of 2. The smallest is 2 (x=1). Third must be >2 and multiple of 3 \u2192 3 (x=1). Fourth must be >3 and multiple of4 \u21924 (x=1). Fifth must be >4 and multiple of5 \u21925 (x=1). Total moves: 0 +1 +1 +1 +1 \u2192 total 4. Which matches the example. So this approach works for the first example.

The minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than prev. The minimal x_i is ceil(prev / a_i) + 1? Wait, let's compute it properly. The smallest multiple of a_i greater than prev is:\n\nif prev % a_i ==0 \u2192 then next multiple is prev + a_i \n\nelse \u2192 ceil(prev / a_i) * a_i \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nLet prev be the previous b_{i-1}.

For example, if prev is 2 and a_i is 3 \u2192 then k_min is 1 (since 3>2). Yes. So k_min = floor(prev / a_i) +1. Thus, b_i = k_min * a_i.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe first problem is about finding the minimal number of seconds to infect the entire tree. The process involves spreading and injection each second. The key here is to model how the infection spreads optimally. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, it seems like they're trying to use a binary search approach. The variables 'resposta' and 'r' suggest that they're searching for the minimal time. The tree array is being sorted, which probably represents the number of children each node has. Wait, the initial code for tree: they have a list of size n, and for each p_i (the parent of i+1?), they increment the parent's count. So tree[i] is the number of children of node (i+1)? Or maybe node i? Because p is given for 2 to n, so p_2 is the parent of 2, etc. So for each p_i in p (which is p_2 to p_n), the parent is p_i, so the tree array counts how many children each node has. So tree is an array where tree[v] is the number of children of node v+1? Or maybe node v? Because the indices are from 0 to n-1. Let me think: for example, if p_2 is 1, then node 1 has a child 2, so tree[0] (since 1-1=0) would be incremented. So yes, tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1). Wait, no, the node numbers are 1-based. So p_i is the parent of i. So for each i from 2 to n, the parent is p_i. So for each such i, the parent's index in the tree array is p_i -1 (since nodes are 1-based). So tree[p_i-1] is incremented by 1. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1). Wait, no, the node's index in the array is v, which corresponds to node v+1? No, the node's number is v+1? Wait, no. Let me see: the parent of node 2 is p_2. So for each node i (starting from 2), its parent is p_i. So for each such i, the parent's index in the array is p_i -1 (since the array is 0-based). So tree[p_i-1] +=1. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1)? No, the node's number is (v+1)? No, the array is for all nodes. For example, node 1's children are counted in tree[0]. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1)? No, node v+1? Wait, no. The index v in the array corresponds to node (v+1)? No, the node numbers are 1-based. So the array is of size n, and for node 1, its index is 0. So tree[0] is the number of children of node 1. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1)? No, node v+1? Wait, no. The node's number is (v+1)? No, the index v is for node (v+1)? No, the index is 0-based. So node 1 is at index 0, node 2 at 1, etc. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1)? No, node (v+1) would be index v. Wait, no. The node's number is (v+1) when the index is v? No, the index is the node number minus 1. So node 1 is index 0, node 2 is index 1, etc. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1)? No, it's the number of children of node (v+1)? Wait, no. For example, if node 1 has children 2 and 3, then p_2 is 1, p_3 is 1. So for each of those, tree[0] (since p_i-1 is 0) is incremented by 1 each time. So tree[0] would be 2, which is correct. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1)? No, node (v+1) is the node at index v? Wait, no. The node's number is (v+1) when the index is v? No, the index is node number minus 1. So node 1 is index 0, so tree[0] is the number of children of node 1. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1)? No, node (v+1) is the node at index v? No, the node's number is v+1? No, the index is v, so the node number is v+1? Wait, no. The index is v, so the node number is v+1? For example, index 0 is node 1, index 1 is node 2, etc. So yes, the node number is v+1. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1). \n\nThe code then sorts the tree array. So the children counts are sorted in non-decreasing order. \n\nThe binary search part is trying to find the minimal m (the time) such that it's possible to infect all nodes in m seconds. The variables s and c are being used in a loop. The loop is going from n-1 down to 0 (since the for loop is written as for i in range(n + neg1, neg1, neg1), where neg1 is -1. So range(n-1, -1, -1) would be from n-1 down to 0. \n\nThe code inside the loop is incomplete. The line \"if tree[i] == 0:\" has a comment TODO. So what's the logic here?\n\nThe problem requires that each second, during spreading, for each node v, if any child is infected, you can choose to infect at most one other child. Then, during injection, you can choose any healthy vertex to infect. The goal is to find the minimal time to infect all nodes.\n\nThe approach here is likely to model the maximum required time based on the depth and the number of children. The binary search is over the possible m (the time), and for each m, we check if it's possible to infect all nodes in m steps.\n\nThe code's logic for checking a given m is probably based on the children counts. The sorted tree array is processed in reverse (from deepest nodes upwards?), and for each node's children count, we track how many infections can be done via spreading and injection.\n\nLooking at the code's loop:\n\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    if tree[i] == 0:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    aux = tree[i] + s - m\n    c += max(0, aux)\n    s += 1\n\nHmm. Let's think: the tree array is sorted. Since it's sorted, the nodes with more children come later in the sorted array? Wait, no. The code sorts the tree array, so after sorting, the elements are in non-decreasing order. So the first elements are smaller, and the last elements are larger. But since the loop is going from the end (n-1) to 0, the largest elements are first in the loop.\n\nWait, the tree array is sorted, so after sorting, tree[0] is the smallest number of children, tree[n-1] is the largest. But the loop is going from the end (n-1) to 0, so first processing the largest elements. \n\nThe variables s and c are being tracked. The 's' variable starts at 0, and increments by 1 each iteration. The 'c' starts at 1. \n\nThe 'aux' is tree[i] + s - m. Then, c increases by max(0, aux). \n\nHmm, perhaps this is trying to model the required number of injections needed. Let me think: For each node's children count (tree[i]), the number of children that can be infected via spreading is limited by the time m. The 's' variable might represent the number of steps available so far? Or maybe the accumulated steps?\n\nAlternatively, the idea is that for each node with k children, the minimal time required to spread to all children is ceil(k / 1) per step? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the approach is similar to the problem where you have to find the minimal m such that for all nodes, the number of children that need to be handled via injection plus spreading can be done within m steps. \n\nWait, the code's condition after the loop is: if m - s >= c, then set r = m-1, else move resposta up. \n\nHmm, perhaps the logic is that the total required steps (c) must be <= m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the minimal m where the required number of steps (c) is <= m. \n\nThe loop is processing each node's children count in the sorted array. The 's' variable is accumulating some value, and 'c' is accumulating the required extra steps. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the tree has nodes with children counts sorted as [3,2,1]. \n\nSuppose m is 2. \n\nProcessing the largest first (3):\n\naux = 3 + s (0) - 2 \u2192 1 \u2192 so c +=1 \u2192 c becomes 1+1=2? Wait initial c is 1. \n\nWait initial c is set to 1 each time. \n\nWait in the code, for each m, the loop starts with s=0, c=1. \n\nFirst iteration (i = n-1, which is the largest element):\n\ntree[i] is 3. \n\naux = 3 + 0 (s) - m (say m=2) \u2192 3+0-2=1 \u2192 max(0,1)=1 \u2192 c becomes 1+1=2. \n\nThen s +=1 \u2192 s becomes 1. \n\nNext iteration (i = n-2, which is 2):\n\naux = 2 +1 (current s) -2 \u2192 2+1-2=1 \u2192 add 1 to c \u2192 c becomes 3. \n\ns becomes 2. \n\nNext i=0 (the 1):\n\naux =1 +2 -2 \u21921 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 c becomes 4. \n\ns becomes 3. \n\nThen after the loop, check if m (2) - s (3) >= c (4). 2-3 = -1 >=4? No. So the condition is false, so we set resposta = m+1. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the required number of injections. \n\nThe key idea might be that for each node, the number of children that can't be handled by spreading must be covered by injections. \n\nThe spreading can handle one child per second. So for a node with k children, the minimal time required to spread all of them is k steps. But since spreading can be done in parallel with other nodes, perhaps the maximum over all the required steps for each node's children, but considering the dependencies. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as the maximum between the depth of the node and the number of children along some path. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal time is the maximum between the height of the tree and the maximum number of children in any node. \n\nWait, but the problem allows choosing which child to spread each second. So for a node with k children, you need at least k seconds to spread all of them via spreading. But since spreading can be done in any order, but each second you can spread one child. So the time required for a node's children is the number of children. \n\nBut since the spreading can be done in parallel with other nodes, the total time is the maximum over all the required times along the paths. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal time is the maximum between the depth of the deepest node and the maximum number of children in any node. \n\nWait, let's think of the first example in the problem's note. The first test case's tree is probably a chain. Let's say the tree is 1-2-3-4-5. The depth of the deepest node (5) is 4. The maximum number of children is 1 (each node except the last has one child). So the maximum between 4 and 1 is 4. But according to the note, the example's image shows that it takes 4 seconds. So that would fit. \n\nAnother example: if a node has 3 children. The spreading would take 3 seconds for that node's children. So the time would be at least 3. \n\nSo the minimal time is the maximum between the maximum number of children in any node and the height of the tree minus 1 (since the root is at depth 0). \n\nWait, the height would be the maximum depth. For example, a root with 3 children: the depth of each child is 1, so the height is 1. The maximum children is 3. So the time would be 3. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the root's three children, you can only spread one each second. So you need 3 seconds for spreading. \n\nSo the minimal time is the maximum between the maximum number of children in any node and the height of the tree. \n\nWait, but how do we compute the height? The height is the maximum depth of any node. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- For each test case, compute two values: the maximum number of children any node has (max_children), and the maximum depth of any node (max_depth). \n\nThen the answer is the maximum of these two. \n\nWait, but let's see another example. Suppose a root with two children, each of those has two children. The max_children is 2 (root has two children). The depth of the leaves is 2. So the maximum between 2 and 2 is 2. \n\nHow would the infection proceed? \n\nInitially, all are healthy. \n\nSecond 1: \n\nInjection: choose one of the root's children (say A). \n\nSpreading: none, since the root's other child is not infected yet. \n\nSecond 2: \n\nInjection: choose another child (B). \n\nSpreading: Now, the root has two infected children (A and B). But during spreading, you can choose to spread to one of their children. Wait, but the spreading is for each node, if any child is infected, you can spread to one other child. \n\nWait, the spreading step allows for each node v, if at least one child is infected, you can choose to infect one other child (that is healthy). \n\nWait, the spreading is per node. For each node v, if any of its children are already infected (from previous steps), then during spreading, you can choose to infect one more child of v. \n\nSo for the root with two children (A and B):\n\nAt second 1: inject A. \n\nThen, during spreading, since A is a child of root and is infected, you can choose to spread to another child (B). But B is not infected yet. Wait, but the spreading can only infect one child of v (the root) that is not already infected. \n\nWait, the spreading step allows you to infect at most one other child of v (that is healthy) for each v where at least one child is already infected. \n\nSo in the first second:\n\nAfter injection, A is infected. \n\nThen during spreading, the root has one infected child (A). So you can choose to spread to B. So B is infected via spreading. \n\nSo after first second, both A and B are infected. \n\nThen, in the second second:\n\nInjection can be used on one of their children. \n\nSpreading: For each of A and B, since they have children, you can spread to one of their children each. \n\nSo in second 2:\n\nInjection: choose one child of A (say C). \n\nThen during spreading, for A (which has one infected child (C?), wait no. Wait, after injection, C is infected. Then during spreading, since A has C as a child (infected), you can spread to another child (D, if A has two children). \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. \n\nBut according to the initial idea, the maximum between max_children and max_depth would give the correct answer. \n\nIn the first example where the tree is a chain of 5 nodes (depth 4), the max_children is 1 (each node except the last has one child). The maximum between 4 and 1 is 4, which matches the example. \n\nAnother example: a root with three children. Max_children is 3, depth is 1. So the answer is 3. \n\nAnother example: a root with two children, each of which has two children. Max_children is 2 (root has two, each child has two). Max depth is 2. So the answer is 2. \n\nWait, but let's see how that would work. \n\nThe root has two children (A and B). Each has two children (A1, A2 and B1, B2). \n\nThe maximum between 2 (max_children) and 2 (depth) is 2. \n\nCan it be done in 2 seconds?\n\nLet's see:\n\nSecond 1:\n\nInjection: choose A. \n\nSpreading: root has A infected, so can spread to B. Now both A and B are infected. \n\nSecond 2:\n\nInjection: choose A1. \n\nSpreading: A has A1 infected, so can spread to A2. \n\nAlso, B has no infected children yet, so can't spread. \n\nBut B's children can be handled via injection. \n\nWait, but in the second second's injection, you can choose B1. \n\nThen during spreading, since B has B1 infected, you can spread to B2. \n\nSo after second 2:\n\nAll nodes are infected. \n\nYes, that works. So the answer is 2, which matches the maximum. \n\nSo the approach is to compute the maximum between the maximum number of children any node has and the maximum depth of any node. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py needs to compute these two values. \n\nLooking back at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code is trying to do a binary search. But perhaps the correct approach is to compute the two values and take the maximum. \n\nWait, but the code given is using a binary search approach, which suggests that the problem is more complex. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the binary search is trying to find the minimal m where m is the maximum between the two values. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required m via binary search, but the current code is incomplete. \n\nThe code's tree array is the number of children per node, sorted. \n\nThe loop is going through the sorted tree array in reverse (from largest to smallest). \n\nThe variables s and c are being tracked. \n\nThe 's' variable starts at 0, and increments by 1 each step. \n\nThe 'c' starts at 1. \n\nThe 'aux' is tree[i] + s - m. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that for each node with k children, the number of required injections is max(0, k - (m - s)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to model the required number of injections. \n\nWait, let's think of the sorted array in non-decreasing order. \n\nThe largest number of children is the last element. \n\nSuppose the maximum number of children is K. \n\nThen, the minimal m must be at least K. \n\nThe depth is the maximum depth of any node. \n\nSo the minimal m is the maximum between K and the depth. \n\nTherefore, the code should compute these two values and output the maximum. \n\nBut how to compute the depth? \n\nThe depth of a node is the distance from the root (node 1). \n\nTo compute the maximum depth, we can perform a BFS or DFS. \n\nWait, but the given code for program1.py doesn't do that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the depth in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is different. \n\nWait, the code's tree array is the number of children per node. \n\nThe maximum depth can be found by traversing the tree and calculating the depth for each node. \n\nBut given the input is the parents array, perhaps we can compute the depth for each node. \n\nLet me think of the steps needed for program1.py:\n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\n- Read n and the parents array p_2 to p_n. \n\n- Build the tree structure. \n\n- Compute for each node its depth. \n\n- Find the maximum depth (max_depth). \n\n- Find the maximum number of children any node has (max_children). \n\n- The answer is the maximum of these two. \n\nSo the code needs to compute these two values. \n\nBut the current code for program1.py is not doing that. \n\nLooking at the code provided:\n\nThe code initializes tree as [0]*n. Then for each p_i in p (which is p_2 to p_n), it increments tree[p_i-1] by 1. So tree[v] is the number of children of node (v+1). \n\nThen, the tree is sorted. \n\nThen, the binary search is over m. \n\nThe loop over the sorted tree array in reverse. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the required m as the maximum between the maximum children and the depth. \n\nWait, the maximum depth can be found by traversing the tree and calculating the depth for each node. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is different. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to model the required m as the minimal value such that for all nodes, the number of children plus some accumulated value is within m. \n\nAlternatively, the code's binary search is trying to find the minimal m where the following condition holds: \n\nThe sum over all nodes of max(0, (number of children - (m - depth))) is <= m. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is based on the following idea: \n\nThe time required is determined by the path with the most nodes, but also considering the branching. \n\nAlternatively, the code's binary search is trying to find the minimal m where the following holds: \n\nFor each node in the tree, the number of children that can't be handled by spreading in m steps must be covered by injections. \n\nThe sorted array of children counts is processed in reverse order (from largest to smallest). \n\nThe 's' variable represents the number of steps available so far. \n\nThe 'c' variable accumulates the required number of injections. \n\nWait, let's think of the code's loop:\n\nInitially, s =0, c=1. \n\nFor each node in the sorted tree array (from largest to smallest):\n\naux = tree[i] + s - m \n\nc += max(0, aux) \n\ns +=1 \n\nWait, perhaps the 's' is the number of steps available so far. \n\nWait, the 's' starts at 0, and increments by 1 each step. \n\nThe 'tree[i]' is the number of children of a node. \n\nThe 'aux' is tree[i] + s - m. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that for a node with k children, the number of children that can't be handled by spreading in m steps is (k - (m - s)), but only if that's positive. \n\nWait, maybe the 's' is the number of steps before the current node's level. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to model the required number of injections needed for each node's children. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is that for each node's children count (k), the minimal number of injections required for that node is max(0, k - (m - (current depth))). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the minimal m such that the sum over all nodes of max(0, (children count - (m - depth))) is <= m. \n\nBut how to compute depth? \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to model the problem as a binary search over m, and for each m, check if it's possible to infect all nodes in m steps. \n\nThe check is done by processing the nodes in order of decreasing children count. \n\nThe 's' variable might represent the number of steps available up to that point. \n\nThe 'c' variable accumulates the required number of injections. \n\nThe condition after the loop is if m - s >= c, then it's possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct except for the missing part in the loop. \n\nLooking at the code's loop:\n\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n\n    if tree[i] ==0:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    aux = tree[i] + s - m \n\n    c += max(0, aux)\n\n    s +=1 \n\nWait, the 'tree' array is sorted. So the nodes with more children come later in the sorted array. \n\nWait, no, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. So the first elements are smaller, and the last elements are larger. \n\nSo when we process from the end (n-1) to 0, we are processing the largest first. \n\nThe 'tree[i]' is the number of children of some node. \n\nThe 's' starts at 0 and increments by 1 each step. \n\nThe 'aux' is tree[i] + s - m. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 's' represents the number of steps available so far. \n\nWait, the 's' is initialized to 0, and each iteration adds 1. \n\nSuppose m is the current candidate. \n\nFor each node in the sorted list (starting from largest children count), the number of children that can't be handled by spreading in m steps is (children count) - (m - s). \n\nWait, but why? \n\nAlternatively, the 's' is the number of steps before the current node's level. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to model that for each node, the number of children that must be infected via injection is max(0, children_count - (m - s)), and the total of these must be <= m. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe code's condition after the loop is: \n\nif m - s >= c: \n\n    possible \n\nElse: not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'c' is the total required injections. \n\nThe 'm - s' is the remaining steps? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the minimal m where the required injections (c) is <= m. \n\nWait, the code's condition is if m - s >= c \u2192 then set r = m-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal m where the required injections (c) is <= m. \n\nBut the code's logic is a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, the missing part in the loop is when tree[i] is zero. \n\nThe code has an 'if tree[i] ==0' block with a TODO. \n\nWhat should happen there? \n\nIf a node has zero children, then it's a leaf. \n\nPerhaps in that case, the code can skip processing it, since leaves don't contribute to spreading. \n\nAlternatively, the code should handle leaves by not adding anything. \n\nSo the code inside the 'if tree[i] ==0' block could be a 'continue' or something. \n\nWait, but the code proceeds to compute aux even if tree[i] is zero. \n\nWait, the code's current code for the loop is:\n\nif tree[i] ==0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\naux = tree[i] + s - m \n\nSo if tree[i] is zero, then aux would be 0 + s - m. \n\nBut perhaps for leaves (zero children), they don't contribute to the required injections. \n\nHence, the code should skip processing them. \n\nSo the missing code is to add a 'continue' statement. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif tree[i] ==0:\n\n    continue \n\nThus, the line to add is 'continue' inside the if block. \n\nThat's probably the missing code for program1.py. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. \n\nEach move allows adding or subtracting a_i to/from b_i. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of moves. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py has a function f(l) which is called on parts of the array. The main code is trying to find the minimal over all possible splits. \n\nThe function f is supposed to compute something, but the loop inside is incomplete. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be trying to split the array into two parts, compute something for each part, and then take the sum. \n\nThe example given in the problem's note: \n\nExample 1: \n\nInput array a is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. \n\nThe solution subtracts a_1 (1) from b_1, and adds a_3, a_4, a_5 to their respective b's. \n\nThe resulting b array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. \n\nThe moves are 1 (subtract 1 from first) plus 3 (add 3,4,5). Total 4. \n\nThe function f is called on l[i+1:] and l[:i][::-1]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the function f is designed to compute the minimal moves for a non-decreasing sequence, but in reverse? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to model the problem by splitting the array into two parts, and for each part, compute the minimal moves required to make it non-decreasing (or increasing). \n\nThe function f(l) is supposed to compute the minimal moves for a certain part. \n\nLooking at the code for f(l):\n\ndef f(l):\n\n    cur = 0 \n\n    n =0 \n\n    for i in l:\n\n        # TODO: code here \n\n    return n \n\nThe variables 'cur' and 'n' are initialized. \n\nThe loop over elements in l. \n\nThe idea is probably to track the minimal required value for each position, and compute the required moves. \n\nThe minimal moves can be found by ensuring that each b_i is at least b_{i-1} +1. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the array b is strictly increasing. \n\nThe approach for such problems is often to greedily adjust each element to be just above the previous one. \n\nLet me think of the standard approach for this problem. \n\nSuppose we have to make the array b strictly increasing with minimal moves. \n\nEach b_i can be adjusted by adding or subtracting multiples of a_i. \n\nWait, no. The problem allows each move to add or subtract a_i to b_i. So each move on b_i changes it by \u00b1a_i. \n\nThe minimal number of moves to reach a desired value for b_i is the absolute difference between the desired value and the initial 0 (since b starts at 0) divided by a_i, but only if the difference is a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because each move can add or subtract a_i. So the minimal number of moves to reach a target value x for b_i is |x| / a_i, but only if x is a multiple of a_i. Otherwise, it's impossible. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any moves, so the target must be such that b_i can be reached via adding or subtracting a_i any number of times. \n\nThus, the target must be congruent to 0 mod a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because each move adds or subtracts a_i. So the total change is k * a_i, where k is any integer (positive or negative). So the final b_i must be equal to k * a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because each move is adding or subtracting a_i. So the total change is an integer multiple of a_i. \n\nThus, the final b_i must be equal to some multiple of a_i. \n\nBut the problem requires that the entire array is strictly increasing. \n\nThis complicates things because the choices for each b_i are constrained to multiples of a_i. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"make b increasing\". The example given in the problem's note has b arrays like [-1,0,3,4,5], which for the first element, -1 is not a multiple of a_1=1 (but -1 is a multiple of 1). So that's okay. \n\nWait, the first example's a array is [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nThe first element's b is -1, which is -1 * 1 \u2192 so one move (subtract 1). \n\nThe second is 0 \u2192 0 * 2 \u2192 0 moves. \n\nThird is 3 \u2192 1 *3 \u2192 one move. \n\nFourth is 4 \u2192 1 *4 \u2192 one move. \n\nFifth is 5 \u2192 1 *5 \u2192 one move. \n\nTotal moves: 1+0+1+1+1 =4. \n\nSo the approach must find a sequence of b_i's that are multiples of a_i, and strictly increasing, with minimal total |b_i| / a_i (since each move contributes \u00b1a_i, so the number of moves for b_i is |b_i| / a_i). \n\nWait, the number of moves for b_i is exactly |b_i| / a_i, since each move changes it by a_i. \n\nThus, the total moves is the sum over all i of |b_i| / a_i. \n\nThe problem is to choose b_i such that:\n\nb_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n \n\nand for each i, b_i is a multiple of a_i (since each move adds/subtracts a_i, so b_i must be a multiple of a_i). \n\nWe need to find such a sequence with minimal total |b_i| / a_i. \n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem. \n\nThe standard approach for such problems is to model it as a dynamic programming problem, but with the constraints of multiples. \n\nAlternatively, we can model it greedily. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can represent each b_i as x_i * a_i, where x_i is an integer. \n\nThe condition is x_1 * a_1 < x_2 * a_2 < ... < x_n * a_n. \n\nWe need to choose x_i's such that this holds, and the sum of |x_i| is minimized. \n\nThe problem reduces to finding such x_i's with minimal sum of |x_i|. \n\nThis seems challenging. \n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem by ensuring that each b_i is at least the previous b_{i-1} +1, and also a multiple of a_i. \n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nWe can track the minimal possible value for b_i given the constraints. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity. \n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\nWe need to choose b_i such that:\n\nb_i > prev \n\nb_i is a multiple of a_i \n\nand |b_i| is minimized. \n\nBut how to choose this? \n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can compute the minimal possible b_i given the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nLet me think of the first element. \n\nFor the first element, the minimal |x_1| is 0 (b_1=0), but then the next element must be >0. \n\nBut perhaps it's better to set b_1 to a lower value. \n\nWait, but the first element can be any multiple of a_1. \n\nThe minimal |x_1| is 0, so b_1=0. \n\nThen for the second element, it must be >0 and a multiple of a_2. \n\nThe minimal possible is the smallest multiple of a_2 greater than 0. That is, a_2 *1. \n\nBut then the third must be greater than a_2, etc. \n\nBut this may not be optimal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nWe can track the minimal possible value of b_i such that it is the smallest possible multiple of a_i that is greater than the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nBut this may not always give the minimal sum. \n\nAlternatively, we can model this with dynamic programming. \n\nLet me think of the DP approach. \n\nLet dp[i] be the minimal total moves up to the i-th element, with the last b_i being exactly some value. \n\nBut the state would be too large. \n\nAlternatively, we can track the minimal possible value of b_i given the previous constraints. \n\nLet me think of the following greedy approach:\n\nWe can process the elements from left to right, and for each step, choose the smallest possible b_i that is a multiple of a_i and greater than the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nThis would minimize the current b_i, thus possibly leading to a minimal total. \n\nLet me see with the first example:\n\na = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nProcessing first element:\n\nb_1 can be 0 (x=0). \n\nSecond element must be >0 and multiple of 2. The smallest is 2 (x=1). \n\nThird must be >2 and multiple of 3 \u2192 3 (x=1). \n\nFourth must be >3 and multiple of4 \u21924 (x=1). \n\nFifth must be >4 and multiple of5 \u21925 (x=1). \n\nTotal moves: 0 +1 +1 +1 +1 \u2192 total 4. Which matches the example. \n\nSo this approach works for the first example. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSuppose a = [3,1,2]. \n\nThe first element can be 0. \n\nSecond must be >0 and multiple of 1 \u2192 1 (x=1). \n\nThird must be >1 and multiple of 2 \u2192 2 (x=1). \n\nTotal moves: 0+1+1 =2. \n\nBut what if we choose b_2 as 2 (x=2), then b_3 can be 2 (but must be >2 \u21924). \n\nThat would give 0+2+2 \u21924, which is worse. \n\nSo the greedy approach of choosing the smallest possible b_i each time seems to work. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nExample 2 from the problem's note: \n\nThe example's output is 10. \n\nSuppose the a array is [3,2,1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nWait, the example's input isn't given, but the output is 10. \n\nAssuming the example's a array is such that the minimal moves are 10. \n\nThe greedy approach would choose the minimal possible b_i each time. \n\nBut perhaps there are cases where choosing a larger b_i earlier allows for smaller total moves. \n\nHmm, but I can't think of such a case. \n\nThus, the greedy approach of choosing the smallest possible b_i each time may be correct. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity. \n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    a_i is the current a's element. \n\n    We need to choose b_i such that:\n\n        b_i is a multiple of a_i \n\n        b_i > prev \n\n    We want to choose the smallest possible b_i (to minimize |b_i| / a_i). \n\n    The minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than prev. \n\n    The minimal x_i is ceil(prev / a_i) + 1? \n\nWait, let's compute it properly. \n\nThe smallest multiple of a_i greater than prev is:\n\nif prev % a_i ==0 \u2192 then next multiple is prev + a_i \n\nelse \u2192 ceil(prev / a_i) * a_i \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nLet prev be the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nWe need b_i = k * a_i, where k is an integer, and k*a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal k is ceil(prev / a_i) + 1? \n\nWait, no. \n\nLet me compute k_min = floor(prev / a_i) +1. \n\nFor example, if prev is 2 and a_i is 3 \u2192 then k_min is 1 (since 3>2). \n\nYes. \n\nSo k_min = floor(prev / a_i) +1. \n\nThus, b_i = k_min * a_i. \n\nThe number of moves for this is |k_min * a_i| / a_i = |k_min|. \n\nBut since k_min is positive (because b_i must be greater than prev, which is at least -infinity but in practice, after first steps, it's positive), the moves are k_min. \n\nWait, but if k_min is negative? No, because we need b_i to be greater than prev. \n\nWait, the first element can be zero. \n\nWait, for the first element (i=0), prev is -infinity. \n\nSo the minimal b_0 can be 0 (k=0). \n\nThen for the next elements, we proceed. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor each a in the array:\n\n    if prev == -infinity: \n\n        # first element \n\n        b =0 \n\n        total +=0 \n\n        prev =0 \n\n    else: \n\n        # compute minimal k such that k*a > prev \n\n        k_min = (prev // a) +1 \n\n        if prev %a ==0: \n\n            k_min +=1 \n\n        b = k_min *a \n\n        total +=k_min \n\n        prev =b \n\nWait, but what if a is negative? No, the problem states a_i are positive. \n\nWait, the problem says a_i are positive integers. \n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows. \n\nBut the problem requires that the array is strictly increasing. \n\nWait, the code above ensures that each b_i is greater than the previous. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the total moves would be the sum of the k's. \n\nBut what about cases where choosing a larger b_i could allow smaller k's later? \n\nHmm, perhaps not. Because choosing the smallest possible b_i each time minimizes the current k, and also leaves the smallest possible value for the next step, which might allow smaller k's in the future. \n\nThus, the greedy approach should work. \n\nNow, the code provided for program2.py has a function f(l) which is supposed to compute this. \n\nThe function f is called on l[i+1:] and l[:i][::-1], and the main code takes the minimum over all possible splits. \n\nWait, why is there a split? \n\nThe code's main line is: \n\nprint(min(f(l[i+1:]) + f(l[:i][::-1]) for i in range(n)))\n\nThis suggests that the function f is supposed to compute the minimal moves for a non-decreasing sequence, but the code is trying to split the array into two parts and compute the sum. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function f is designed to compute the minimal moves for a non-increasing sequence, and the main code is trying to find the best split point where the left part is non-increasing and the right is non-decreasing. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, the function f is supposed to compute the minimal moves for a sequence that is non-decreasing, but in reverse. \n\nWait, perhaps the function f is designed to compute the minimal moves for a sequence that must be non-decreasing, but the code is trying to split the array into two parts and compute the sum of their minimal moves. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect and the correct solution is to implement the greedy approach I described. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py has a function f(l) which is supposed to compute something. \n\nThe loop inside f is incomplete. \n\nThe code's current function f(l) has:\n\ndef f(l):\n\n    cur =0 \n\n    n =0 \n\n    for i in l:\n\n        # TODO: code here \n\n    return n \n\nThe variables 'cur' and 'n' are initialized. \n\nThe loop is over elements in l. \n\nThe 'cur' variable likely tracks the previous b value. \n\nThe 'n' is the total moves. \n\nThe code should implement the greedy approach. \n\nThus, the code inside the loop should be:\n\nfor a in l:\n\n    if cur == -infinity: \n\n        # first element \n\n        b =0 \n\n        moves =0 \n\n    else: \n\n        k_min = (cur // a) +1 \n\n        if cur %a ==0: \n\n            k_min +=1 \n\n        b = k_min *a \n\n        moves =k_min \n\n    n += moves \n\n    cur = b \n\nWait, but initially, 'cur' is set to 0. \n\nWait, the initial 'cur' is set to 0. \n\nWait, the initial 'cur' is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, in the code, 'cur' is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, the code's initial 'cur' is 0. \n\nWait, the first element's previous is -infinity, but in the code's current setup, 'cur' starts at 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code should initialize 'cur' to -infinity. \n\nWait, the code's initial 'cur' is 0. \n\nWait, the code's function f is supposed to compute the minimal moves for the list l. \n\nThe code's current setup is:\n\ncur =0 \n\nn=0 \n\nfor a in l: \n\n    ... \n\nThus, for the first element, the previous 'cur' is 0. \n\nBut that's incorrect because the first element has no previous. \n\nAh, so the code's initial 'cur' should be set to -infinity. \n\nWait, but in Python, we can't have -infinity. So perhaps we can set it to a very small number like -1e18. \n\nAlternatively, handle the first element specially. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\ndef f(l):\n\n    if not l:\n\n        return 0 \n\n    total =0 \n\n    prev = -float('inf')\n\n    for a in l:\n\n        if prev == -float('inf'):\n\n            #
