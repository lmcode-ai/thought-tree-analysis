Wait, the swap for a given k is a permutation that can be represented as follows: For each i from 1 to 2^n, if i mod (2^{k+1}) is less than 2^k, then swap with i + 2^k. Wait, let me think of an example. Take the example given in the problem: \n\nOriginal array: [-3,5,-3,2,8,-20,6,-1]\n\nWhen k=1 (2^1=2), the swaps are between i and i+2. The loop runs from i=1 to 2^3 - 2^1 = 8-2=6 (since 2^3 is 8). i=1: not swapped, swap with 3 \u2192 elements 1 and 3 are swapped. i=2: not swapped, swap with 4 \u2192 elements 2 and 4 are swapped. \n\ni=3: already swapped (from i=1), so skip. i=4: already swapped (from i=2), so skip. i=5: not swapped, swap with 7 \u2192 elements 5 and 7 are swapped. i=6: not swapped, swap with 8 \u2192 elements 6 and 8 are swapped. So the permutation for k=1 is swapping pairs (1,3), (2,4), (5,7), (6,8). The pattern here is that for each block of size 2^{k+1}, the first half is swapped with the second half. So for a given k, the permutation swaps elements in pairs separated by 2^k, but only for the first half of each block of size 2^{k+1}. Therefore, the permutation for k can be represented as follows: For any position i, if i mod (2^{k+1}) < 2^k, then the swapped position is i + 2^k. Otherwise, it's i - 2^k. Wait, let's see: For k=1, 2^{k+1}=4. i mod 4 can be 0,1,2,3. If i mod 4 is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1?), then swap with i+2. Wait, for i=1 mod4=1 <2 \u2192 swap with 3. i=2 mod4=2 which is not less than 2 \u2192 so it would be swapped with 0? No, that's not right. Hmm, perhaps the correct way is that for each block of size 2^{k+1}, the first 2^k elements are swapped with the next 2^k elements. So for a block starting at position s, the elements s to s+2^k-1 are swapped with s+2^k to s+2^{k+1}-1. Therefore, for any position i in the block, if it is in the first half (i < s+2^k), then it is swapped with i + 2^k. Otherwise, it is swapped with i - 2^k. Therefore, the permutation for k can be represented as follows: \n\nFor any position i, the new position after applying the permutation for k is: \n\nif (i-1) & (2^{k+1} -1) < 2^k \u2192 then new_i = i + 2^k \n\nelse \u2192 new_i = i - 2^k \n\nWait, perhaps the permutation can be represented as a function that for each position i, the swapped position is i ^ (2^k). Wait, let's see for the example: \n\nFor k=1, 2^k is 2. \n\ni=1 (binary 01) \u2192 XOR with 10 (2) gives 11 (3). i=3 (11) \u2192 XOR with 10 gives 01 (1). i=2 (10) \u2192 XOR with 10 gives 00 (0?), but indices start at 1. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the permutation for k is a bitwise XOR with 2^k. Wait, for the example, when k=1 (2^1=2), the swap pairs are (1,3), (2,4), (5,7), (6,8). The XOR of 1 and 3 is 2 (binary 01 ^ 11 = 10). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the permutation for k can be represented as follows: \n\nThe permutation for k is a transposition of pairs (i, i + 2^k) for all i where i mod 2^{k+1} < 2^k. Therefore, the permutation can be represented as a function that for any position i, if i is in the first half of a block of size 2^{k+1}, then it is swapped with the corresponding position in the second half.",

Let me think of the permutation for each k as a function. For a given k, the permutation function P_k is defined as follows: \n\nFor any position i (1-based), P_k(i) is: \n\nif (i-1) & (2^{k+1} -1) < 2^k \u2192 then P_k(i) = i + 2^k \n\nelse \u2192 P_k(i) = i - 2^k \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe block size is 2^{k+1}. The first half of the block is positions 1 to 2^k, the second half is 2^k+1 to 2^{k+1}. So for any i in the first half of its block, it is swapped with the corresponding position in the second half.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first. \n\nThe problem for program1 is about processing queries on an array. Each query involves swapping elements in a specific way and then computing the maximum subarray sum. The code provided uses a segment tree approach with some structure (Node) to track necessary information for the maximum subarray. The build function is incomplete, so I need to figure out what's missing there.\n\nLooking at the build function, it's supposed to construct a segment tree. The current code for build has a loop that's incomplete. The merge function combines two nodes, so during the build, each node should be built by merging left and right children. The existing code for build is trying to loop over some elements but the inner loop is missing. Wait, the code says:\n\nfor _ in range(2):\n    for i in range((r - l) // 2):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    vl, vr = vr, vl\n\nHmm, maybe this is part of a process where they are combining the left and right segments in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the build function is supposed to create a binary tree structure where each node is a combination of left and right. But I'm not sure exactly what the code is trying to do here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the build function is supposed to create a segment tree where each node stores the necessary information (best, suf, pref, sum) by merging the left and right children. The current code for build is trying to build the tree recursively, but the merging part is missing. \n\nWait, the build function is written in a way that for a leaf node (when l+1 == r), it returns a list containing a single node (the single element). For non-leaf nodes, it splits into left and right, then loops over some steps. The problem is that the code inside the loops is missing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the build function is supposed to combine the left and right segments in a way that allows for the segment tree to be built. The current code's structure is a bit unclear. Let me think about the standard approach for a segment tree for maximum subarray sum.\n\nThe standard approach for a segment tree to compute maximum subarray sum uses nodes that store four values: the maximum subarray sum in the segment, the maximum prefix sum, the maximum suffix sum, and the total sum. Each node is built by merging the left and right children. The merge function combines these values as per the problem's logic. \n\nIn the given code, the build function is trying to do something with vl and vr (the left and right children's segment trees?), but the loops are incomplete. The code for building the nodes might be missing the actual merging steps. \n\nWait, the build function returns a list. For a leaf node, it returns a list with a single Node. For non-leaf nodes, it builds left and right, then loops over some steps. The loop runs twice, and in each iteration, it loops over (r-l)//2 elements. But the code inside is missing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the build function is trying to precompute all possible segment tree nodes for different configurations based on the current query's K. But that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current approach is using a binary indexed tree or some other structure. Alternatively, the problem's approach might involve bitmasking for the queries. The variable curr is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a certain swap has been done. The tree is indexed by curr, so for each query, the current state is tracked via a bitmask. \n\nWait, looking at the main code:\n\ncurr is initialized to 0. For each query K, curr ^= (1 << K). Then, the answer is tree[curr].best. So the tree is a dictionary or array where each key is a bitmask representing the set of swaps applied so far, and the value is the segment tree node for that state. \n\nAh, that's an interesting approach. The idea is that each query toggles a bit in the curr bitmask, and the tree stores the current state of the array after all swaps corresponding to the set bits. But how does the build function work here? \n\nWait, the build function is called with parameters (0, 0, M), where M is 2^n. The build function is supposed to construct the segment tree for the initial array. But the way the code is structured, the tree is built once, and then for each query, the curr is updated, and the tree is accessed via that bitmask. But that doesn't make sense because the tree would need to be updated after each swap. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach here is that each swap operation can be represented as a bitmask, and the current state of the array can be determined by the bits set in curr. The swaps are such that each k corresponds to a certain swap pattern, and the order of applying the swaps can be represented by the bitmask. \n\nWait, the problem requires that for each query, you perform a series of swaps based on k. The swaps are done in a specific way: for each i from 1 to 2^n - 2^k, if not swapped yet, swap a[i] and a[i + 2^k]. The key is that each swap is done only once per element. \n\nBut how can this be represented with a bitmask? The curr variable is a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a k value. Each time a query with k is made, the bit is toggled. The idea is that the swaps for a particular k are applied when the bit is set. \n\nWait, perhaps the swaps for a given k are applied exactly once when the bit is set. So the order of queries doesn't matter because each k is either applied or not. But the problem states that the queries are applied in sequence, so the order does matter. However, the bitmask approach here might be incorrect because the swaps for a particular k may depend on previous swaps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps for a given k can be represented as a permutation of the array elements, and the current permutation is the composition of all the permutations corresponding to the set bits in curr. \n\nAh, that's a possible approach. Each k corresponds to a certain permutation of the array. When you toggle the k-th bit, you apply that permutation. The permutations can be precomputed, and the current array is the composition of all permutations corresponding to the set bits. \n\nBut how to represent this efficiently? Since n can be up to 18, the number of possible permutations is 2^18 which is 262k, but that's manageable? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the swaps for a given k can be represented as a bitmask where each element's position is determined by the current bitmask. \n\nWait, the swap for a given k is done in a specific way. For each i from 1 to 2^n - 2^k, if not swapped yet, swap a[i] and a[i+2^k]. The swapping is done in order, so each element is swapped at most once per query. \n\nBut the problem requires that after each query, the array is modified permanently. So each query's swaps are applied to the current array. \n\nThe key is that each query's swaps can be represented as a permutation, and the current array is the result of applying all the permutations from previous queries. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the order of applying permutations matters. So the bitmask approach may not work unless the permutations commute, which they probably don't. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's swap operations for a given k can be represented as a permutation that is its own inverse. Because applying the same k twice would revert the swaps. \n\nWait, let's think: when you process a query with k, you perform swaps between i and i+2^k for certain i's. If you process the same k again, the same swaps would be done again, but since the elements were already swapped, they would be swapped back. \n\nWait, the problem says that during a query, you process each i in order, and if the element hasn't been swapped yet, you swap it. So, for example, if you have a query with k, then another query with the same k, the second time, the elements would have already been swapped, so they wouldn't be swapped again. \n\nWait, no. Because the first time you process k, you swap some elements. The second time, when you process the same k, you start again from i=1. The first element (i=1) may have been swapped in the first query, so in the second query, it would be skipped. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"if the i-th element was already swapped with some other element during this query, skip it\". Wait, the \"during this query\" part is important. So each query is processed independently. So when you process a query with k again, you start fresh, and the swaps are done again. \n\nWait, the problem's description says: \"for every i in [1, 2^n - 2^k] in ascending order, do the following: if the i-th element was already swapped with some other element during this query, skip it; otherwise, swap a_i and a_{i+2^k};\" \n\nAh, so during a single query, each element is considered once. So when you process the same k again, the swaps are done again, but the array's state is modified from the previous queries. \n\nThis complicates things because the order of queries matters. \n\nThe current code's approach with a bitmask may not work because the same k can be applied multiple times, and each time it would have a different effect depending on the current array. \n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is using a bitmask to track which k's have been applied, but that's incorrect because applying the same k again would not be the same as toggling the bit. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is probably wrong, but the user is asking to complete the given code. \n\nLooking back at the code provided for program1.py, the build function is supposed to build a segment tree. The problem is that the build function's code is incomplete. Let me think again about the build function. \n\nThe build function is called recursively. For a leaf node (when l+1 == r), it returns a list with a single node (the single element). For non-leaf nodes, it splits into left and right, then loops over some steps. The code inside the loops is missing. \n\nWait, the code for the non-leaf case is:\n\nvl = build(2*v+1, l, m)\nvr = build(2*v+2, m, r)\nans = []\nfor _ in range(2):\n    for i in range((r - l) // 2):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    vl, vr = vr, vl\nreturn ans\n\nHmm, perhaps the loops are trying to interleave the left and right segments in some way. The (r-l) is the length of the current segment. Since the array is of size 2^n, the segments are always powers of two. \n\nWait, the loop runs twice, and in each iteration, it loops over (r-l)//2 elements. The (r-l) is the length of the current segment. So (r-l)//2 would be half of that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to merge the left and right segments in two different ways, such as left first then right, and vice versa. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is trying to precompute all possible segment tree nodes for different configurations. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to build the segment tree in a way that allows for the swaps to be represented as bitmask operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the build function is supposed to create a segment tree where each node is built by merging the left and right children. The missing code in the loops is supposed to perform the merging. \n\nWait, the merge function takes two nodes and returns a new node. So for a non-leaf node, the left and right children are built, and then the current node is the merge of left and right. But in the current code, the build function is returning a list. \n\nWait, the build function returns a list. For a leaf node, it returns a list with a single node. For non-leaf nodes, after building left and right, the code loops and tries to combine them. \n\nWait, perhaps the build function is building a list of nodes for the current segment. The left and right are built as lists, and then the current list is formed by merging elements from left and right in some way. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to build a segment tree where each node is a list of possible merged nodes. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach where the segment tree is built in a way that allows for the swaps to be represented as bitmask operations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a binary indexed tree approach, but I'm not sure. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the problem again. The main issue is that the code's build function is incomplete. The problem requires that after each query, the array is modified by swapping certain elements, and then the maximum subarray sum is computed. \n\nThe current code uses a segment tree to track the maximum subarray sum. The segment tree nodes store the necessary information (best, suf, pref, sum). The build function is supposed to construct this tree. \n\nThe build function for a segment tree typically works as follows: \n\ndef build(l, r):\n    if l == r:\n        return Node containing the single element\n    mid = (l + r) // 2\n    left = build(l, mid)\n    right = build(mid+1, r)\n    return merge(left, right)\n\nBut in the given code, the build function is returning a list. The current code's build function for non-leaf nodes is trying to do something with vl and vr (the left and right children's lists?), and then loops over some steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a different approach where the segment tree is stored as an array, and the build function is constructing it. But the current code's structure is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to precompute all possible segment trees for different swap configurations. Since each swap is determined by a k, and the swaps can be represented as a bitmask, the tree is a dictionary where each key is a bitmask, and the value is the current segment tree. \n\nBut the build function is called with parameters (0, 0, M), which suggests it's building the initial segment tree. Then, for each query, the curr is updated, and the tree is accessed via that bitmask. But how does the tree get updated when a query is processed? \n\nWait, the code's main loop is:\n\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    K = int(input())\n    curr ^= (1 << K)\n    print(tree[curr].best)\n\nThis suggests that the tree is precomputed for all possible bitmasks, which is impossible because the number of bitmasks is 2^18 (since n can be up to 18), which is around 262k. But even that might be manageable if each node is small. \n\nWait, but how is the tree built? The build function is called once, and the tree is stored in a variable called tree. The initial call to build(0, 0, M) would return a list, but the code says tree = build(0, 0, M). \n\nHmm, perhaps the build function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a bitmask, and the value is the corresponding segment tree node. But the current code's build function is returning a list. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach where the swaps are represented as a bitmask, and each bit corresponds to a certain swap operation. The current array is determined by the bitmask, and the segment tree for each possible bitmask is precomputed. \n\nBut precomputing all possible 2^18 segment trees is impossible because each segment tree for an array of size 2^18 would take O(2^18) space, leading to O(2^18 * 2^18) which is way too big. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let me think of the swap operations. \n\nEach query with k swaps elements in pairs of distance 2^k. The swaps are done in a way that each element is swapped at most once per query. \n\nThe key observation here is that the swaps for a given k can be represented as a permutation of the array. Each time you apply the same k, the permutation is applied again. \n\nWait, but applying the permutation twice would revert the array to its original state. Because swapping twice cancels the effect. \n\nWait, let's see: suppose you have elements a and b. If you swap them once, they are swapped. If you swap them again, they return to their original positions. \n\nIn the problem's swap process for a query with k, the swaps are done in a way that each pair (i, i+2^k) is swapped exactly once during the query. So applying the same k again would swap them again, reversing the previous swap. \n\nTherefore, each k corresponds to a permutation that is its own inverse. So applying the permutation twice cancels it. \n\nTherefore, the current state of the array can be represented by a bitmask where each bit indicates whether the permutation for that k has been applied an odd number of times. \n\nTherefore, the total number of possible states is 2^n, which for n=18 is 262,144. That's manageable. \n\nTherefore, the idea is to precompute for each possible bitmask (state) the current array, and build a segment tree for each state. But even that is impossible because for n=18, the array has 2^18 elements (262,144), and each segment tree would take O(2^18) nodes, leading to 2^18 * 2^18 nodes, which is way too big. \n\nHmm, so that approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternative idea: the swaps for a given k can be represented as a bitmask, and the current array can be represented as a permutation of the original array. The permutation can be computed as the composition of all the permutations corresponding to the set bits in the current bitmask. \n\nThe key is to find a way to represent the current array's permutation efficiently. \n\nEach permutation for a given k can be represented as a bitmask. For example, the permutation for k is a function that swaps elements at positions i and i+2^k for certain i's. \n\nWait, the swap for a given k is done in a specific way. For each i from 1 to 2^n - 2^k, if the element hasn't been swapped yet in this query, swap it with i+2^k. \n\nWait, but during a query, the swaps are done in order. So for each i in order, if the element hasn't been swapped yet, swap it. \n\nThis means that for a given k, the swaps form pairs of elements. Each element is part of exactly one swap (since once swapped, it's marked as swapped). \n\nWait, the process for a query with k is: \n\nLoop over i from 1 to 2^n - 2^k. \n\nFor each i, if it hasn't been swapped yet, swap it with i+2^k. \n\nThis effectively pairs elements into groups of two, where each pair is (i, i+2^k). \n\nThe order of processing ensures that each element is only swapped once. \n\nTherefore, the swap for a given k is a permutation that swaps pairs (i, i+2^k) for all i not yet swapped. \n\nWait, but the way it's done is that for each i in order, if not swapped, swap with i+2^k. \n\nThis results in swapping all pairs (i, i+2^k) where i is odd in the current block. \n\nWait, perhaps the swap for a given k is a permutation that swaps elements in pairs separated by 2^k. \n\nThe key is that the permutation for a given k is a fixed permutation, and applying it twice cancels it. \n\nTherefore, the current array can be represented as the original array permuted by the composition of all permutations corresponding to the set bits in the current bitmask. \n\nThe problem is to compute, for each bitmask, the current array's permutation, and then compute the maximum subarray sum. \n\nBut storing the array for each bitmask is impossible for n=18. \n\nAlternative idea: the permutation for each k can be represented as a bitmask, and the current permutation can be computed as the XOR of the individual permutations. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the permutation for a given k can be represented as a function that can be applied in O(1) time. \n\nWait, perhaps the permutation for a given k can be represented as a bitmask where each bit indicates whether the element is swapped. \n\nAlternatively, the permutation can be represented as a function that can be applied incrementally. \n\nWait, the swap for a given k is a permutation that can be represented as follows: \n\nFor each i from 1 to 2^n, if i mod (2^{k+1}) is less than 2^k, then swap with i + 2^k. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. \n\nTake the example given in the problem: \n\nOriginal array: [-3,5,-3,2,8,-20,6,-1]\n\nWhen k=1 (2^1=2), the swaps are between i and i+2. \n\nThe loop runs from i=1 to 2^3 - 2^1 = 8-2=6 (since 2^3 is 8). \n\ni=1: not swapped, swap with 3 \u2192 elements 1 and 3 are swapped. \n\ni=2: not swapped, swap with 4 \u2192 elements 2 and 4 are swapped. \n\ni=3: already swapped (from i=1), so skip. \n\ni=4: already swapped (from i=2), so skip. \n\ni=5: not swapped, swap with 7 \u2192 elements 5 and 7 are swapped. \n\ni=6: not swapped, swap with 8 \u2192 elements 6 and 8 are swapped. \n\nSo the permutation for k=1 is swapping pairs (1,3), (2,4), (5,7), (6,8). \n\nThe pattern here is that for each block of size 2^{k+1}, the first half is swapped with the second half. \n\nSo for a given k, the permutation swaps elements in pairs separated by 2^k, but only for the first half of each block of size 2^{k+1}. \n\nTherefore, the permutation for k can be represented as follows: \n\nFor any position i, if i mod (2^{k+1}) < 2^k, then the swapped position is i + 2^k. \n\nOtherwise, it's i - 2^k. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFor k=1, 2^{k+1}=4. \n\ni mod 4 can be 0,1,2,3. \n\nIf i mod 4 is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1?), then swap with i+2. \n\nWait, for i=1 mod4=1 <2 \u2192 swap with 3. \n\ni=2 mod4=2 which is not less than 2 \u2192 so it would be swapped with 0? No, that's not right. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is that for each block of size 2^{k+1}, the first 2^k elements are swapped with the next 2^k elements. \n\nSo for a block starting at position s, the elements s to s+2^k-1 are swapped with s+2^k to s+2^{k+1}-1. \n\nTherefore, for any position i in the block, if it is in the first half (i < s+2^k), then it is swapped with i + 2^k. \n\nOtherwise, it is swapped with i - 2^k. \n\nTherefore, the permutation for k can be represented as follows: \n\nFor any position i, the new position after applying the permutation for k is: \n\nif (i-1) & (2^{k+1} -1) < 2^k \u2192 then new_i = i + 2^k \n\nelse \u2192 new_i = i - 2^k \n\nWait, perhaps the permutation can be represented as a function that for each position i, the swapped position is i ^ (2^k). \n\nWait, let's see for the example: \n\nFor k=1, 2^k is 2. \n\ni=1 (binary 01) \u2192 XOR with 10 (2) gives 11 (3). \n\ni=3 (11) \u2192 XOR with 10 gives 01 (1). \n\ni=2 (10) \u2192 XOR with 10 gives 00 (0?), but indices start at 1. Hmm, maybe not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation for k is a bitwise XOR with 2^k. \n\nWait, for the example, when k=1 (2^1=2), the swap pairs are (1,3), (2,4), (5,7), (6,8). \n\nThe XOR of 1 and 3 is 2 (binary 01 ^ 11 = 10). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the permutation for k can be represented as follows: \n\nThe permutation for k is a transposition of pairs (i, i + 2^k) for all i where i mod 2^{k+1} < 2^k. \n\nTherefore, the permutation can be represented as a function that for any position i, if i is in the first half of a block of size 2^{k+1}, then it is swapped with the corresponding position in the second half. \n\nTherefore, the permutation can be represented as a bitmask where each bit corresponds to whether the permutation for that k has been applied. \n\nThe key insight is that the permutation for each k is an involution (applying it twice cancels it), so the current permutation is the composition of all permutations corresponding to the set bits in the current bitmask. \n\nThe problem now is to represent the current permutation efficiently so that we can compute the current array's elements quickly. \n\nThe current array's elements can be computed as follows: \n\nFor each position i in the original array, the current position after applying all permutations is determined by the bitmask. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nThe permutation for each k can be represented as a function that can be applied in O(1) time. \n\nSuppose we have a function that, given a current position and a k, returns the new position after applying the permutation for k. \n\nThen, the current position can be computed by applying all the permutations corresponding to the set bits in the bitmask. \n\nHowever, applying all permutations for each query would be too slow for large n and q. \n\nAlternative idea: the permutations for different k's commute. \n\nWait, if the permutations for different k's commute, then the order of applying them doesn't matter, and the current permutation can be represented as the composition of all individual permutations. \n\nIf that's the case, then the current permutation can be computed as the XOR of the individual permutations. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose we have two different k values, say k1 and k2. \n\nThe permutation for k1 swaps pairs of elements separated by 2^k1. \n\nThe permutation for k2 swaps pairs separated by 2^k2. \n\nIf k1 and k2 are different, then the order of applying them doesn't matter. \n\nFor example, applying k1 then k2 is the same as applying k2 then k1. \n\nIs this true? \n\nLet me take an example. \n\nSuppose n=2 (array size 4). \n\nk1=0 (swap distance 1), k2=1 (swap distance 2). \n\nOriginal array indices 1,2,3,4. \n\nApplying k1 first: \n\nFor k=0, 2^0=1. The swaps are between i and i+1 for i up to 3. \n\nWait, the process for k=0 would be: \n\nLoop i from 1 to 4-1=3. \n\ni=1: swap with 2 \u2192 array becomes [2,1,3,4]. \n\ni=2: already swapped (since it was swapped in i=1?), no. Wait, the problem says during the query, if the element was swapped during this query, skip. \n\nWait, for k=0, the swap distance is 1. \n\nThe loop runs from i=1 to 4-1=3. \n\ni=1: not swapped yet \u2192 swap with 2 \u2192 elements 1 and 2 are swapped. \n\ni=2: now, the element at position 2 was just swapped (it was originally at position 1), so it has been swapped during this query \u2192 skip. \n\ni=3: not swapped \u2192 swap with 4 \u2192 elements 3 and 4 are swapped. \n\nSo after k=0, the array is [2,1,4,3]. \n\nThen applying k=1 (swap distance 2): \n\nLoop i from 1 to 4-2=2. \n\ni=1: not swapped \u2192 swap with 3 \u2192 elements 1 and 3 are swapped \u2192 array becomes [4,1,2,3]. \n\ni=2: not swapped \u2192 swap with 4 \u2192 elements 2 and 4 are swapped \u2192 array becomes [4,3,2,1]. \n\nNow, applying k=1 first then k=0: \n\nFirst k=1: \n\nLoop i from 1 to 2. \n\ni=1: swap with 3 \u2192 array becomes [3,2,1,4]. \n\ni=2: swap with 4 \u2192 array becomes [3,4,1,2]. \n\nThen k=0: \n\nLoop i from 1 to 3. \n\ni=1: swap with 2 \u2192 array becomes [4,3,1,2]. \n\ni=2: was swapped (from i=1?), so skip. \n\ni=3: swap with 4 \u2192 array becomes [4,3,2,1]. \n\nSo the final array is the same as when applying k0 then k1. \n\nSo the order doesn't matter. \n\nTherefore, the permutations for different k's commute. \n\nThis is a crucial observation. \n\nTherefore, the current permutation can be represented as the composition of all permutations corresponding to the set bits in the bitmask, and the order of applying them doesn't matter. \n\nTherefore, the current permutation can be represented by the bitmask, and the current array can be computed as the original array permuted by the composition of all the permutations for the set bits. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute the current array's elements based on the bitmask. \n\nThe key is to find a way to compute the current position of each element efficiently. \n\nLet me think of the permutation for each k as a function. \n\nFor a given k, the permutation function P_k is defined as follows: \n\nFor any position i (1-based), P_k(i) is: \n\nif (i-1) & (2^{k+1} -1) < 2^k \u2192 then P_k(i) = i + 2^k \n\nelse \u2192 P_k(i) = i - 2^k \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe block size is 2^{k+1}. \n\nThe first half of the block is positions 1 to 2^k, the second half is 2^k+1 to 2^{k+1}. \n\nSo for any i in the first half of its block, it is swapped with the corresponding position in the second half. \n\nThe block for i is determined by (i-1) divided by 2^{k+1}. \n\nThe position within the block is (i-1) mod 2^{k+1}. \n\nIf this position is less than 2^k \u2192 then it is in the first half \u2192 swapped with position + 2^k. \n\nElse \u2192 swapped with position - 2^k. \n\nTherefore, the permutation for k can be represented as: \n\nP_k(i) = i ^ (2^k) \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFor example, when k=1 (2^k=2), \n\ni=1 \u2192 binary 01 \u2192 XOR with 10 (2) gives 11 (3). \n\ni=3 \u2192 11 XOR 10 \u2192 01 (1). \n\ni=2 \u2192 10 XOR 10 \u2192 00 \u2192 but that's 0, but indices start at 1. Hmm, maybe not exactly. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is i ^ (2^k). \n\nWait for k=0 (2^0=1), \n\ni=1 \u2192 1 XOR 1 = 0 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, maybe the correct formula is (i-1) ^ (2^k) +1. \n\nLet me see: \n\nFor k=1, 2^k=2. \n\ni=1 \u2192 (0) ^ 2 = 2 \u2192 +1 \u2192 3 \u2192 correct. \n\ni=3 \u2192 (2) ^2 = 0 \u2192 +1 \u2192 1 \u2192 correct. \n\ni=2 \u2192 (1) ^2 = 3 \u2192 +1 \u21924 \u2192 but for k=1, the swap for i=2 is with 4. \n\nYes, that works. \n\ni=2 \u2192 (2-1)=1 \u2192 1 XOR 2 (2^1) is 3 \u2192 3+1=4. \n\nYes. \n\nSimilarly for k=0 (2^0=1): \n\ni=1 \u2192 (0) XOR 1 \u2192 1 \u2192 +1 \u2192 2 \u2192 which is correct (swap with 2). \n\ni=2 \u2192 (1) XOR 1 \u21920 \u2192 +1 \u21921 \u2192 correct. \n\nYes, this seems to work. \n\nTherefore, the permutation for k can be represented as: \n\nP_k(i) = ( (i-1) ^ (2^k) ) +1 \n\nTherefore, applying the permutation for k is equivalent to flipping the (k+1)-th bit in the binary representation of (i-1). \n\nTherefore, the composition of multiple permutations can be represented by XORing all the 2^k terms corresponding to the set bits in the bitmask. \n\nWait, because each permutation is an involution (applying it twice cancels it), the overall permutation is the XOR of all the 2^k terms for the set bits. \n\nSo, the current permutation is determined by the bitmask. \n\nLet me explain: \n\nSuppose the current bitmask has bits set for k1, k2, ..., km. \n\nThe overall permutation is the composition of P_{k1}, P_{k2}, ..., P_{km}. \n\nSince each P_k is an involution and the permutations commute, the order doesn't matter. \n\nThe composition can be represented as: \n\nFor each position i, the final position after applying all permutations is: \n\nfinal_i = ( (i-1) ^ (sum of 2^k for each set bit k) ) +1 \n\nWait, because each P_k corresponds to XOR with 2^k. \n\nYes! Because each permutation P_k is equivalent to XORing (i-1) with 2^k. \n\nTherefore, the overall permutation is the XOR of all the 2^k terms for the set bits. \n\nTherefore, the current position of the original element at position i is: \n\ncurrent_pos = ( (i-1) ^ mask ) +1 \n\nwhere mask is the sum of 2^k for all set bits in the bitmask. \n\nWait, mask is the sum of 2^k for each k in the set bits. \n\nWait, the mask is the bitmask itself. Because each bit in the bitmask corresponds to a k. \n\nWait, the bitmask is a number where the k-th bit is set if the permutation for k has been applied. \n\nSo mask = curr (the bitmask variable in the code). \n\nWait, the code uses curr as a bitmask where each bit represents whether the permutation for that k has been applied an odd number of times. \n\nTherefore, the current position of the original element at position i is: \n\ncurrent_pos = ( (i-1) ^ curr ) +1 \n\nWait, because each set bit in curr corresponds to a permutation P_k, which is an XOR with 2^k. \n\nTherefore, the overall permutation is the XOR of all the 2^k terms for the set bits, which is exactly the value of curr. \n\nTherefore, the current array can be computed as follows: \n\nfor each position j in the current array, the element at j is the original array's element at position ( (j-1) ^ curr ) +1 \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nSuppose the current permutation is mask = curr. \n\nThe current array's element at position j is the original array's element at position ( (j-1) ^ mask ) +1. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the current array can be computed on the fly for any bitmask. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute the maximum subarray sum for the current array after each query. \n\nThe maximum subarray sum can be computed using Kadane's algorithm in O(n) time. \n\nBut for n up to 18 (array size 2^18 = 262,144), and q up to 2e5, this would be O(q * 2^18) which is way too slow (2e5 * 262k = ~5e10 operations). \n\nThis is not feasible. \n\nTherefore, we need a more efficient way. \n\nThe key is to precompute for all possible masks the segment tree nodes, but storing all 2^18 segment trees is impossible. \n\nAlternative idea: the maximum subarray sum can be computed using a segment tree that can be updated efficiently. \n\nBut how to represent the current array's elements in a way that allows the segment tree to be updated quickly. \n\nWait, the current array is a permutation of the original array. The elements are the same as the original array, just reordered. \n\nThe maximum subarray sum depends on the order of the elements. \n\nThe problem requires that after each query, we compute the maximum subarray sum of the current permutation. \n\nThe maximum subarray sum can be computed using a segment tree that stores for each interval the necessary information (best, suf, pref, sum). \n\nThe segment tree can be built dynamically, but for each query, the permutation changes, so the segment tree would need to be rebuilt each time, which is O(N) per query, which is too slow. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternative idea: since the permutation is a bitwise XOR of the mask, perhaps the segment tree can be represented in a way that allows for the current permutation to be applied without rebuilding the entire tree. \n\nAlternatively, the segment tree can be built on the original array, and the current permutation can be applied by reordering the elements in the leaves of the segment tree. \n\nBut the segment tree's nodes are built based on the leaves' order. So changing the order of leaves would require rebuilding the entire tree. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: since the permutation is a bitwise XOR of the mask, the current array can be viewed as the original array indexed by ( (i-1) ^ mask ) +1. \n\nTherefore, the current array is a permutation of the original array, and the maximum subarray sum can be computed using a segment tree that can be queried in a way that accounts for the permutation. \n\nBut I'm not sure how to do that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum subarray sum can be computed using a dynamic programming approach that can be updated efficiently. \n\nThe maximum subarray sum can be computed using the following recurrence: \n\nmax_ending_here[i] = max( a[i], max_ending_here[i-1] + a[i] )\n\nmax_so_far = max( max_so_far, max_ending_here[i] )\n\nThis is O(N) per query, which is too slow for large N and q. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the problem constraints are n up to 18 (so array size 2^18 = 262,144) and q up to 2e5. \n\n262,144 * 2e5 = 5e10 operations, which is way too big. \n\nThis suggests that the intended solution must have a smarter approach. \n\nLet me think again about the problem's swap operations. \n\nEach query corresponds to applying a permutation P_k, which is an involution and commutes with other permutations. \n\nThe current permutation is the XOR of all the applied permutations. \n\nThe maximum subarray sum depends on the current permutation's arrangement of the array. \n\nThe key insight is that the maximum subarray sum can be computed using a segment tree that can be updated incrementally. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the maximum subarray sum can be represented in a way that allows for the permutation to be applied as a bitmask. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum subarray sum can be precomputed for all possible masks. \n\nThe number of masks is 2^18, which is about 262k. \n\nFor each mask, we can precompute the maximum subarray sum. \n\nThis would require O(2^18 * N) time, which is 262k * 262k = ~6.8e10 operations. That's way too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative idea: the maximum subarray sum can be computed using the current permutation's mask. \n\nThe current array is a permutation of the original array. The maximum subarray sum is the same as the maximum subarray sum of the original array permuted by the mask. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum subarray sum can be computed using a segment tree that is built on the original array, and the current permutation is applied by reordering the leaves. \n\nBut the segment tree's nodes are built based on the leaves' order. So changing the order of leaves would require rebuilding the entire tree. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the maximum subarray sum is computed after each query. \n\nThe maximum subarray sum can be computed using a segment tree that is built dynamically. \n\nBut for each query, the permutation changes, so the segment tree must be rebuilt each time. \n\nThis is O(N) per query, which is too slow for large N and q. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the problem's sample code uses a segment tree with nodes storing best, suf, pref, sum. The build function is incomplete. \n\nThe code's main loop uses a bitmask curr, and for each query, it toggles the bit corresponding to k and then accesses tree[curr].best. \n\nThis suggests that the tree is a dictionary where each key is a bitmask, and the value is the segment tree node for the current array's state. \n\nBut how is this possible? \n\nThe build function must precompute all possible segment trees for all possible masks. \n\nThe number of masks is 2^18, which is about 262k. \n\nEach segment tree for an array of size 2^18 would require O(2^18) nodes. \n\n262k * 262k is way too big (around 6.8e10 nodes). \n\nThis is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach must be different. \n\nLooking back at the code provided for program1.py: \n\nThe build function is called with parameters (0, 0, M), where M is 2^n. \n\nThe build function returns a list. \n\nThe main code initializes tree = build(0, 0, M). \n\nThen, for each query, it toggles the bit and accesses tree[curr].best. \n\nThis suggests that the tree is a list indexed by the bitmask curr. \n\nBut the build function must have precomputed all possible segment trees for all possible masks. \n\nBut this is impossible for n=18. \n\nTherefore, there must be a different approach. \n\nPerhaps the build function is not building a segment tree for each mask, but instead building a segment tree that can be updated based on the current bitmask. \n\nWait, the code's build function is written in a way that suggests it's building a segment tree for the initial array. \n\nThe merge function combines two nodes. \n\nThe build function for a leaf node returns a list with a single node. \n\nFor non-leaf nodes, it builds left and right children, then loops over some steps. \n\nThe code inside the loops is missing. \n\nPerhaps the build function is building a segment tree that can be used to compute the maximum subarray sum for any permutation corresponding to a bitmask. \n\nThe key is that the permutation is a bitwise XOR of the mask, and the segment tree can be queried in a way that accounts for the permutation. \n\nAlternatively, the segment tree is built in such a way that each node contains information for all possible masks. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is building a segment tree where each node contains information for all possible masks. \n\nBut this is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to represent the current array as a bitmask and use a segment tree that can be updated with the current permutation. \n\nBut I'm stuck. \n\nLet me look at the code's build function again. \n\nThe build function for a non-leaf node: \n\nvl = build(2*v+1, l, m) \n\nvr = build(2*v+2, m, r) \n\nans = [] \n\nfor _ in range(2): \n\n    for i in range((r-l)//2): \n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\n    vl, vr = vr, vl \n\nreturn ans \n\nThe loops are trying to combine vl and vr in some way. \n\nThe vl and vr are the left and right children's segment trees. \n\nThe loop runs twice, and in each iteration, it loops over (r-l)//2 elements. \n\nThe (r-l) is the length of the current segment. \n\nThe (r-l)//2 is half of that. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to interleave the left and right segments in some way. \n\nThe code inside the loop is missing. \n\nThe goal is to build the current segment's nodes by merging the left and right children's nodes. \n\nThe merge function takes two nodes and returns a new node. \n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to merge the left and right children's nodes in pairs. \n\nFor example, for each i in 0 to (r-l)//2 -1, the current node's ith element is the merge of vl[i] and vr[i]. \n\nBut the code is incomplete. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is trying to create a list of nodes for the current segment by merging the left and right children's nodes in a certain way. \n\nThe loop runs twice, and in each iteration, it loops over (r-l)//2 elements. \n\nPerhaps the first iteration merges the left and right in one way, and the second iteration in another way. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to build the segment tree in a way that allows for the permutation to be applied by XORing the mask. \n\nThe missing code might be something like: \n\nfor i in range((r-l)//2): \n\n    ans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to build the segment tree nodes for all possible masks. \n\nThe build function for a leaf node returns a list with a single node. \n\nFor non-leaf nodes, the left and right children are built, and then the current nodes are formed by merging left and right in all possible ways. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is building a segment tree where each node contains information for all possible masks up to that level. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look at the second problem first, which might be easier. \n\nProgram2.py's problem is to count the number of ways to partition n into sums of palindromic numbers, with the answer modulo 1e9+7. \n\nThe code provided is: \n\ng=10**9+7 \n\nv=[1]+[0]*40001 \n\nfor i in range(1,40001): \n\n    if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]: \n\n        for j in range(i,40001): \n\n            # TODO: Your code here \n\nfor n in[*open(0)][1:]: \n\n    print(v[int(n)]%g) \n\nThe code initializes v[0] =1, and for each i from 1 to 4e4, if i is a palindrome, then for j from i to 4e4, update v[j] += v[j-i]. \n\nThis is the standard dynamic programming approach for counting the number of partitions into palindromic numbers. \n\nThe missing code inside the inner loop should be v[j] += v[j-i], then mod g. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nfor j in range(i,40001): \n\n    v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g \n\nYes. \n\nSo the completion for program2 is to fill in that line. \n\nNow back to program1. \n\nThe build function's missing code is likely to be merging the left and right children's nodes. \n\nThe build function for a non-leaf node is supposed to return a list of merged nodes. \n\nThe code inside the loop for _ in range(2): \n\n    for i in range((r-l)//2): \n\n        # merge vl[i] and vr[i] \n\n        ans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\n    vl, vr = vr, vl \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to build the segment tree in a way that allows for the permutation to be applied via bitmask. \n\nThe build function might be building a segment tree where each node contains information for all possible masks. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is building a segment tree for the initial array, and the tree variable is a single segment tree. \n\nThe curr variable is a bitmask that represents the current permutation. \n\nThe maximum subarray sum is computed by traversing the segment tree in a way that accounts for the permutation. \n\nBut how? \n\nThe current array is a permutation of the original array. The segment tree stores information about the original array's segments. \n\nTo compute the maximum subarray sum for the current permutation, we need to traverse the segment tree in the order dictated by the permutation. \n\nThis would require a way to traverse the segment tree in the order of the current permutation's indices. \n\nBut this is complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the segment tree is built in such a way that the permutation can be applied by XORing the mask. \n\nThe nodes store information for all possible masks. \n\nBut this is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the build function is building a segment tree where each node contains information for all possible masks up to that level. \n\nThe merge function combines the left and right nodes' information. \n\nThe build function's loops are trying to combine the left and right in two different ways. \n\nThe code inside the loop is missing, but perhaps it's merging the left and right nodes in pairs. \n\nThe code for the build function's missing part is likely to be: \n\nfor i in range((r-l)//2): \n\n    ans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to build the segment tree nodes by merging the left and right children's nodes in a way that allows for the permutation to be applied via bitmask. \n\nThe loops are there to handle the two possible directions of merging. \n\nThe code inside the loop is missing, but the correct code would be to merge the left and right nodes. \n\nThe build function for a non-leaf node should return a list of merged nodes. \n\nThe code inside the loop would be: \n\nfor i in range((r-l)//2): \n\n    ans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\nThen, after swapping vl and vr, the second iteration would merge the other way. \n\nWait, but why two iterations? \n\nPerhaps the first iteration merges left and right in the normal order, and the second iteration merges them in the reverse order. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is building a segment tree that can handle the permutation by XORing the mask. \n\nThe mask is a bitmask of the applied k's. \n\nThe segment tree nodes store information for all possible masks. \n\nBut this is unclear. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct completion for program1's build function is to merge the left and right nodes in the loop. \n\nThe missing code inside the loop is: \n\nans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\nSo the code would be: \n\nfor _ in range(2): \n\n    for i in range((r - l) // 2): \n\n        ans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\n    vl, vr = vr, vl \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code is supposed to alternate between left and right. \n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is supposed to return the merged node of left and right. \n\nBut the current code returns a list. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the build function is supposed to return a list of nodes for the current segment. \n\nFor a leaf node, it's a single node. \n\nFor non-leaf nodes, the left and right are built, then merged in pairs. \n\nThe loops are there to handle the merging in both directions. \n\nThe code inside the loop is missing the merging step. \n\nThe correct code would be to append the merged node of vl[i] and vr[i]. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\nThus, the completion for program1's build function is to add this line inside the inner loop. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is the line inside the loop. \n\nThe program2's missing code is the line inside the inner loop, which is v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g. \n\nSo the final answers are: \n\nFor program1: \n\nThe missing code in the build function's loop is ans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i])) \n\nFor program2: \n\nThe missing code is v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g \n\nThus, the JSON output should be: \n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"ans.append(merge(vl[i], vr[i]))\",\n  \"program2\": \"v[j] = (v[j] + v[j - i]) % g\"\n}"
