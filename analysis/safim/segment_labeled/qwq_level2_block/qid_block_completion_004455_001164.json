      "text": "The problem requires finding four positive integers a, b, c, d such that their sum is n, and gcd(a, b) equals the lcm(c, d). The code provided has some cases filled in based on n mod 4. Let's see what's missing. Looking at the existing code:\n\nFor n divisible by 4, they set all four numbers to m = n//4. That makes sense because 1+1+1+1=4 when n=4, etc. The gcd(1,1) is 1, and lcm(1,1) is 1, so that works. When n mod4 is 2, they use 2m-1, 2m+1, 1,1. Let's check for example n=6 (mod4=2). m would be 1 (6//4=1). So 2*1-1=1, 2*1+1=3. So a=1, b=3, sum a+b is 4, plus c=1 and d=1 gives total 6. The gcd(1,3) is 1, and lcm(1,1)=1. So that works. For n mod4=3, the code uses 2, 4m-2, 2,1. Let's see n=7 mod4=3. m is 1 (7//4=1). So 4m-2 is 2. So a=2, b=2 (wait, no, 4m-2 would be 2, so the numbers are 2, 2 (since 4*1-2=2?), then c=2 and d=1. Sum is 2+2+2+1=7. The gcd(2,2)=2, and lcm(2,1)=2. That works. Now the missing part is when n mod4 is 1. Let's think of an example. Take n=5. The required sum is 5. Let's see what the code should output. The current code for mod4=1 has a TODO. Hmm, what's the approach here? Let's think of possible a, b, c, d. Let's see the sample input's second case was n=7 (mod4=3), which worked with 2,2,2,1. For n=5 mod4=1, maybe we can find a pattern. Let me think of possible values. Let's try to set a and b such that their gcd is some value, and c and d's lcm is that same value. Suppose we choose a=1 and b=1. Then their gcd is 1. So the lcm(c,d) must be 1. So c and d must both be 1. Then the sum a+b+c+d is 1+1+1+1=4, but n is 5. So we need an extra 1. Maybe adjust the numbers. Alternatively, maybe set a=1, b=2. Their gcd is 1. Then c and d must have lcm 1, so again 1 and 1. Then total sum is 1+2+1+1=5. That works. So the numbers would be 1,2,1,1. But how to generalize this? Alternatively, perhaps for mod4=1, the code can set a=1, b=1, c=1, and d = n-3. But then the sum is 1+1+1 + (n-3) = n. But then the gcd(a,b)=1, and lcm(c,d) must be 1. So c and d must both be 1. But d would be n-3, which would have to be 1. So that only works when n-3=1, i.e. n=4, but n mod4=0 in that case. So that approach won't work. Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think of the case when n mod4 is 1. Let's see the example given in the problem's first test case where n=4 (mod0) works with all 1s. For n=5 mod1, maybe set a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2. Then sum is 5. The gcd(1,1)=1, and lcm(1,2)=2. Not equal. So that's bad. Wait, need to have gcd(a,b) equal to lcm(c,d). Let's think of a case where the gcd is 1 and the lcm is 1. Then c and d must be 1. So the sum would be a + b + 2 = n. So a + b = n-2. Since a and b must have gcd 1. For example, n=5, a=1, b=2 (sum 3, so total 5). Then yes, that works. So in this case, the numbers would be 1,2,1,1. So how to code this? Alternatively, maybe set a=1, b=2, c=1, d = n-4. Wait, but then the sum is 1+2+1 + (n-4) = n. The gcd(1,2)=1, and lcm(1, d) must be 1. So d must be 1. So that would require n-4=1 \u2192 n=5. So for n=5, that works. But for n=9 mod4=1 (since 9 mod4 is 1?), wait 9 mod4 is 1? 4*2=8, 9-8=1. Yes. So for n=9, this approach would set d=5 (9-4=5). But then lcm(1,5)=5, which must equal gcd(1,2)=1. Not equal. So that's bad. Hmm, so maybe the approach for mod4=1 is different. Let's think of another way. Let's see the sample input's second case (n=7 mod3) uses a=2, b=2 (gcd 2), and c=2, d=1 (lcm 2). So the key is to have the gcd and lcm equal. Perhaps for mod4=1, we can set a and b such that their gcd is 1, and then set c and d to 1 and 1, but then the sum would be a + b + 2 = n. So a + b = n-2. Since a and b must have gcd 1, we can choose a=1 and b = n-3. Then their gcd is 1 (since 1 and any number have gcd 1). Then c and d are 1 and 1, so their lcm is 1. So the total sum is 1 + (n-3) + 1 +1 = n. That works. Wait, let's test this for n=5. Then a=1, b=2 (since 5-3=2). Then sum is 1+2+1+1=5. The gcd(1,2)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1. So that works. For n=9 mod4=1 (since 9 mod4 is 1?), yes. Then a=1, b=6 (9-3=6). Their gcd is 1. Then c and d are 1 and 1. The sum is 1+6+1+1=9. The gcd is 1, lcm is 1. So that works. Another example: n=1 mod4? Wait n must be at least 4. The first possible n mod4=1 is 5, then 9, etc. So this approach seems to work. So in code, for the case when n%4 ==1, the code can set a=1, b = n-3 - (c +d). Wait, but c and d are 1 and 1. So the code would be:\n\nprint(1, n-3-2, 1, 1) \u2192 no, wait a + b + c +d = 1 + (n-3) + 1 +1 = n. So b is n-3 - (1+1)? No, the sum of a and b is (n-2) because c and d are 2 (each 1). So a is 1, b is (n-2 -1) = n-3. So the code would be:\n\nprint(1, n-3, 1, 1) Wait, but in the code structure of program1.py, the existing code for mod4=1 has a TODO. Let me see the code structure again:\n\nThe code for mod4==1 is in the elif block. The code for mod4==2 and 3 have their own print statements. So for mod4==1, the code needs to be filled in. So the code for that case would be:\n\nelif n%4 ==1:\n    print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ') Wait, but let me check for n=5. That would give 1,2,1,1 \u2192 sum 5. Correct. For n=9, 1,6,1,1 \u2192 sum 9. Correct. But what about n=1 mod4 but larger? Let's see n=13. Then 1+10 +1+1 =13. gcd(1,10)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. So that works. So that's the solution for the mod4==1 case. Now moving to program2.py. The problem is to find all possible a's such that the border tiles can be tiled with 1xa tiles (rotatable). The bathroom has dimensions w and l. The interior is (w-2)*(l-2) 1x1 tiles. The border area is the remaining. The border area must be exactly divisible by a, since each border tile is 1xa (or ax1, rotated). The border area is total area (w*l) minus the interior (w-2)*(l-2). Let's compute that:\n\nTotal area: w*l\n\nInterior area: (w-2)*(l-2)\n\nBorder area: w*l - (w-2)(l-2) = w*l - [wl -2w -2l +4] = 2w + 2l -4 = 2*(w + l -2). So the border area is 2*(w + l -2). This must be divisible by a. So a must be a divisor of 2*(w + l -2). But also, the tiles must fit along the edges. Wait, the tiles are placed along the border. The border is the perimeter minus the corners? Or perhaps the border is the outer edge. The problem says the border uses tiles of 1xa. The tiles can be placed either horizontally or vertically.",

The code should compute all divisors of border_area. The code can do this by iterating up to sqrt(border_area). The code's current loop is using half_perimeter instead of border_area. So the code's loop should be:\n\nborder_area = 2*(w + l -2)\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nsolutions = set()\n\nfor i in range(1, int(border_area**0.5)+1): if border_area %i ==0:\n\n        a1 = i \n\n        a2 = border_area//i \n\n        for a in [a1, a2]:\n\n            if a <= max_edge:\n\n                solutions.add(a) Then, after collecting all such a's, sort them and output. But the current code's structure is different. The current code's loop is:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i) if mod_i ! =0: continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter, but that's not the border area. The code's current approach is incorrect. The correct code should compute all divisors of border_area (2*(w + l -2)), then filter those divisors to be <= max_edge. Thus, the missing code in program2.py's TODO section is to add the valid divisors. The current code's loop is inside the for i in ... loop. The code's current loop is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter. The code's current code has:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1): if half_perimeter %i ==0:\n\n        div = half_perimeter//i \n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n\n            mod_a = w % a \n\n            if mod_a <=2:\n\n                # add to solutions?",

Thus, the code should also check if 2*a is a divisor of border_area (which it is) and whether it is <= max_edge. Thus, the code should add both a and 2*a (if applicable).

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem requires finding four positive integers a, b, c, d such that their sum is n, and gcd(a, b) equals the lcm(c, d). The code provided has some cases filled in based on n mod 4. Let's see what's missing.\n\nLooking at the existing code:\n\nFor n divisible by 4, they set all four numbers to m = n//4. That makes sense because 1+1+1+1=4 when n=4, etc. The gcd(1,1) is 1, and lcm(1,1) is 1, so that works.\n\nWhen n mod4 is 2, they use 2m-1, 2m+1, 1,1. Let's check for example n=6 (mod4=2). m would be 1 (6//4=1). So 2*1-1=1, 2*1+1=3. So a=1, b=3, sum a+b is 4, plus c=1 and d=1 gives total 6. The gcd(1,3) is 1, and lcm(1,1)=1. So that works.\n\nFor n mod4=3, the code uses 2, 4m-2, 2,1. Let's see n=7 mod4=3. m is 1 (7//4=1). So 4m-2 is 2. So a=2, b=2 (wait, no, 4m-2 would be 2, so the numbers are 2, 2 (since 4*1-2=2?), then c=2 and d=1. Sum is 2+2+2+1=7. The gcd(2,2)=2, and lcm(2,1)=2. That works.\n\nNow the missing part is when n mod4 is 1. Let's think of an example. Take n=5. The required sum is 5. Let's see what the code should output. The current code for mod4=1 has a TODO.\n\nHmm, what's the approach here? Let's think of possible a, b, c, d. Let's see the sample input's second case was n=7 (mod4=3), which worked with 2,2,2,1. For n=5 mod4=1, maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nLet me think of possible values. Let's try to set a and b such that their gcd is some value, and c and d's lcm is that same value.\n\nSuppose we choose a=1 and b=1. Then their gcd is 1. So the lcm(c,d) must be 1. So c and d must both be 1. Then the sum a+b+c+d is 1+1+1+1=4, but n is 5. So we need an extra 1. Maybe adjust the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set a=1, b=2. Their gcd is 1. Then c and d must have lcm 1, so again 1 and 1. Then total sum is 1+2+1+1=5. That works. So the numbers would be 1,2,1,1. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for mod4=1, the code can set a=1, b=1, c=1, and d = n-3. But then the sum is 1+1+1 + (n-3) = n. But then the gcd(a,b)=1, and lcm(c,d) must be 1. So c and d must both be 1. But d would be n-3, which would have to be 1. So that only works when n-3=1, i.e. n=4, but n mod4=0 in that case. So that approach won't work.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think of the case when n mod4 is 1. Let's see the example given in the problem's first test case where n=4 (mod0) works with all 1s. For n=5 mod1, maybe set a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2. Then sum is 5. The gcd(1,1)=1, and lcm(1,2)=2. Not equal. So that's bad.\n\nWait, need to have gcd(a,b) equal to lcm(c,d). Let's think of a case where the gcd is 1 and the lcm is 1. Then c and d must be 1. So the sum would be a + b + 2 = n. So a + b = n-2. Since a and b must have gcd 1. For example, n=5, a=1, b=2 (sum 3, so total 5). Then yes, that works. So in this case, the numbers would be 1,2,1,1. So how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set a=1, b=2, c=1, d = n-4. Wait, but then the sum is 1+2+1 + (n-4) = n. The gcd(1,2)=1, and lcm(1, d) must be 1. So d must be 1. So that would require n-4=1 \u2192 n=5. So for n=5, that works. But for n=9 mod4=1 (since 9 mod4 is 1?), wait 9 mod4 is 1? 4*2=8, 9-8=1. Yes. So for n=9, this approach would set d=5 (9-4=5). But then lcm(1,5)=5, which must equal gcd(1,2)=1. Not equal. So that's bad.\n\nHmm, so maybe the approach for mod4=1 is different. Let's think of another way. Let's see the sample input's second case (n=7 mod3) uses a=2, b=2 (gcd 2), and c=2, d=1 (lcm 2). So the key is to have the gcd and lcm equal. \n\nPerhaps for mod4=1, we can set a and b such that their gcd is 1, and then set c and d to 1 and 1, but then the sum would be a + b + 2 = n. So a + b = n-2. Since a and b must have gcd 1, we can choose a=1 and b = n-3. Then their gcd is 1 (since 1 and any number have gcd 1). Then c and d are 1 and 1, so their lcm is 1. So the total sum is 1 + (n-3) + 1 +1 = n. That works. \n\nWait, let's test this for n=5. Then a=1, b=2 (since 5-3=2). Then sum is 1+2+1+1=5. The gcd(1,2)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1. So that works. For n=9 mod4=1 (since 9 mod4 is 1?), yes. Then a=1, b=6 (9-3=6). Their gcd is 1. Then c and d are 1 and 1. The sum is 1+6+1+1=9. The gcd is 1, lcm is 1. So that works. \n\nAnother example: n=1 mod4? Wait n must be at least 4. The first possible n mod4=1 is 5, then 9, etc. So this approach seems to work. \n\nSo in code, for the case when n%4 ==1, the code can set a=1, b = n-3 - (c +d). Wait, but c and d are 1 and 1. So the code would be:\n\nprint(1, n-3-2, 1, 1) \u2192 no, wait a + b + c +d = 1 + (n-3) + 1 +1 = n. So b is n-3 - (1+1)? No, the sum of a and b is (n-2) because c and d are 2 (each 1). So a is 1, b is (n-2 -1) = n-3. So the code would be:\n\nprint(1, n-3, 1, 1)\n\nWait, but in the code structure of program1.py, the existing code for mod4=1 has a TODO. Let me see the code structure again:\n\nThe code for mod4==1 is in the elif block. The code for mod4==2 and 3 have their own print statements. So for mod4==1, the code needs to be filled in. \n\nSo the code for that case would be:\n\nelif n%4 ==1:\n    print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nWait, but let me check for n=5. That would give 1,2,1,1 \u2192 sum 5. Correct. For n=9, 1,6,1,1 \u2192 sum 9. Correct. \n\nBut what about n=1 mod4 but larger? Let's see n=13. Then 1+10 +1+1 =13. gcd(1,10)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. So that works. \n\nSo that's the solution for the mod4==1 case. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to find all possible a's such that the border tiles can be tiled with 1xa tiles (rotatable). The bathroom has dimensions w and l. The interior is (w-2)*(l-2) 1x1 tiles. The border area is the remaining. The border area must be exactly divisible by a, since each border tile is 1xa (or ax1, rotated). \n\nThe border area is total area (w*l) minus the interior (w-2)*(l-2). Let's compute that:\n\nTotal area: w*l\n\nInterior area: (w-2)*(l-2)\n\nBorder area: w*l - (w-2)(l-2) = w*l - [wl -2w -2l +4] = 2w + 2l -4 = 2*(w + l -2). \n\nSo the border area is 2*(w + l -2). This must be divisible by a. So a must be a divisor of 2*(w + l -2). But also, the tiles must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, the tiles are placed along the border. The border is the perimeter minus the corners? Or perhaps the border is the outer edge. The problem says the border uses tiles of 1xa. The tiles can be placed either horizontally or vertically. \n\nThe border area is 2*(w + l -2). So the total area of the border must be divisible by a. So a must divide 2*(w + l -2). But also, the tiles must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, the tiles are placed along the border. For example, the perimeter's edges must be covered by tiles of length a. Let me think of the border as the perimeter's tiles. The border is the outer edge, which has a perimeter of 2*(w + l) -4 (since the four corners are counted twice). But the area of the border is 2*(w + l -2). \n\nWait, the border area is 2*(w + l -2). So the total border area must be divisible by a. So a must be a divisor of that value. \n\nBut the problem requires that the tiles can be arranged along the edges. For example, the tiles of size 1xa can be placed either horizontally or vertically. So for each side of the border, the length must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must fit along the edges. Let me think again. The border is the outer edge. The four sides (excluding the corners) must be covered by tiles of length a. \n\nWait, the border is the perimeter minus the inner part. The border's tiles are arranged along the edges. For example, the top and bottom edges (excluding the corners) have length (l-2) each, and the left and right edges (excluding corners) have (w-2) each. But the tiles are placed along these edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in any way as long as the total area is divisible by a. But the problem's note says that a can be 1, which works because 1 divides any number. \n\nWait the problem says that the border tiles can be of size 1xa, which can be rotated. So each tile is either 1xa or ax1. So the tiles can be placed along the edges in any orientation. \n\nThe key is that the total border area must be divisible by a. So a must divide 2*(w + l -2). \n\nWait, but the problem's sample input first case is 3x5. The border area is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. The valid a's are 1,2,3. 12 is divisible by all of them. \n\nYes, in the sample, the valid a's are 1,2,3. 12's divisors include those. So the solution is to find all divisors of 2*(w + l -2), but also considering that a can be any positive integer that divides that value. \n\nWait, but the problem's output requires that the a's are the divisors of the border area. So the code should compute all divisors of 2*(w + l -2). \n\nWait, but the code in program2.py has some existing code. Let me look at the code provided:\n\nThe code starts by reading all data except the first t. Then for each w and l, they compute half_perimeter = w + l -2. The border area is 2*(half_perimeter). So the border area is 2*(w + l -2). So the a must divide this value. \n\nThe code initializes solutions as {1,2}. Then loops over divisors of half_perimeter (since 2*(half_perimeter) = 2*(w+l-2)), but perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of 2*(half_perimeter). \n\nWait, the code's half_perimeter is w + l -2. The border area is 2 * half_perimeter. So the a must divide 2*half_perimeter. \n\nThe code is trying to find all divisors of 2*half_perimeter. But the code's current approach is looping up to sqrt(half_perimeter). Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\nWait, but the border area is 2*half_perimeter. So the divisors of 2*half_perimeter are needed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the divisors of the border area (2*(w + l -2)), but the code is using half_perimeter (w + l -2) and then considering divisors of that. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2\n\nThen, the code is looping over divisors of half_perimeter, but multiplied by 2? Or perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\nWait, the code's loop is over i from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter). For each i that divides half_perimeter, it adds i and div (the pair) to the possible a's. But then, since the border area is 2*half_perimeter, the a must divide that. So the divisors of 2*half_perimeter are needed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect here. Let me think again. \n\nThe correct approach is to find all divisors of 2*(w + l -2). \n\nSo the code should compute all divisors of that number. \n\nThe code in program2.py is trying to do that, but perhaps the approach is wrong. Let's see:\n\nThe code starts with solutions = {1,2}. \n\nThen, for each i from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter):\n\nWait, half_perimeter is (w + l -2). So the border area is 2 * half_perimeter. \n\nThe code is looping over divisors of half_perimeter. Because for each i in 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter), if i divides half_perimeter, then it adds i and div (the pair) to the solutions. \n\nWait, but the code is considering divisors of half_perimeter, but the required a must divide 2*half_perimeter. \n\nSo the code is missing the factors that come from multiplying by 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code should instead compute all divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is incorrect. Let me think of the sample input. \n\nSample input 1: w=3, l=5. \n\nhalf_perimeter = 3+5-2 =6. \n\nborder area is 12. \n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n\nThe sample's valid a's are 1,2,3. Wait why not 4,6,12?\n\nWait the sample says the answer is 1,2,3. So why are 4,6,12 not valid?\n\nAh, perhaps there's an additional constraint. The tiles must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, the problem says that the tiles can be placed along the boundary. The tiles are 1xa or ax1. So for example, the tiles must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, the border is made up of the perimeter's edges. Let me think of the four sides:\n\nThe top and bottom edges (excluding the corners) have length (l-2). The left and right edges (excluding corners) have (w-2). \n\nThe tiles must be placed along these edges. So for each edge, the length must be divisible by a (since the tiles are placed along the edge). \n\nWait, no. Because the tiles can be placed in any orientation. For example, a tile of size 1xa can be placed along the edge in such a way that the a side is along the edge. \n\nWait, the tiles are placed on the border. The border's edges have certain lengths. For example, the top edge (excluding corners) is length (l-2). The tiles must cover this edge. \n\nEach tile placed along this edge must have one side aligned with the edge. Since the tiles can be rotated, the length of the edge must be divisible by either a or 1. \n\nWait, the tile is 1xa. So when placed along the edge, the length of the edge must be divisible by either a (if placed with the a side along the edge) or 1 (if placed with the 1 side along the edge). But since a is a positive integer, the 1 side is always possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in any way as long as the total area is covered. But the problem's note says that a can be 1, which works. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem's constraints are only that the border area is divisible by a. Because the tiles can be arranged in any way. For example, if a is 4 and the border area is 12, then 12/4=3 tiles. But how to arrange them? Maybe the tiles can be placed in different orientations. \n\nWait the sample input's first case has a=3. The border area is 12, so 12/3=4 tiles. Each tile is 1x3. So they can be placed along the edges. \n\nBut why isn't a=4 allowed? Let's see. The border area is 12, so 12/4=3. So 3 tiles of 1x4. But how to arrange them along the edges. \n\nThe edges have lengths:\n\nTop and bottom edges (excluding corners) are l-2 =5-2=3. So each has length 3. \n\nLeft and right edges (excluding corners) are w-2=3-2=1. \n\nSo the total border edges are:\n\nTop: 3 units, bottom:3, left:1, right:1. \n\nThe total border area is 2*(3+5-2) = 12. \n\nIf a=4, then each tile is 1x4. The tiles must cover the edges. \n\nThe top edge is 3 units long. To cover that with 1x4 tiles, rotated to 4x1, but the length is 3, which is less than 4. So that's impossible. \n\nAh! So the problem requires that the tiles can be placed along the edges such that their lengths fit. \n\nSo the a must divide the length of each edge. \n\nWait, the edges have lengths (l-2) and (w-2). \n\nWait, the edges are:\n\nThe top and bottom edges (excluding corners) have length (l-2). \n\nThe left and right edges (excluding corners) have length (w-2). \n\nEach of these edges must be covered by tiles placed along them. \n\nThe tiles can be placed in any orientation, so for each edge of length s, the length of the edge must be divisible by either a or 1 (since the tile can be rotated). \n\nWait, the tile is 1xa. So when placed along the edge, the side along the edge can be either 1 or a. \n\nThus, for each edge of length s, s must be divisible by either a or 1. Since 1 divides everything, the only constraint is that s must be divisible by a or a must divide s. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the edge has length s. The tiles placed along this edge must have their length (either 1 or a) along the edge. \n\nSo for each edge of length s, s must be divisible by either 1 or a. \n\nBut since 1 divides any s, the only constraint is that s must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, no. Because the tiles can be placed in either orientation. So for example, if the edge length is 3 and a is 4, then you can't place a tile of length 4 along it. But you can place tiles with the 1 side along the edge. \n\nWait, the tile is 1xa. If placed with the 1 side along the edge, then the length along the edge is 1, so the edge length must be divisible by 1 (which it is). But then the tiles would be placed in such a way that their a side is perpendicular to the edge. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in any way as long as their total area covers the border. The problem's note says that a can be 1, which works. \n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. The problem requires that the border area is divisible by a, but also that the tiles can be arranged along the edges. \n\nWait, the problem's note says that in the first test case (3x5), a=3 is allowed. Let's see:\n\nThe border edges are:\n\nTop and bottom edges (length 3 each). Left and right edges (length 1 each). \n\nFor a=3:\n\nThe tiles are 1x3. \n\nAlong the top edge (length 3), placing tiles with the 3 side along the edge would require 3/3 =1 tile. That works. \n\nThe left edge (length 1) can be covered by a tile placed with the 1 side along the edge (so the tile is 3x1, but rotated). \n\nSo the tiles can be arranged. \n\nBut for a=4, the border area is 12, so 12/4=3 tiles. \n\nThe top edge is 3 units. To cover that with tiles of a=4, you can't place them with the 4 side along the edge (since 3 <4). But you can place them with the 1 side along the edge. So each tile would contribute 1 unit along the edge. So 3 tiles along the top edge (each 1 unit along the edge, 4 units in the other direction). But the other direction would extend beyond the border? \n\nWait, the tiles are placed on the border. The border is the outer edge. The tiles must fit within the border's area. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's constraints are only that the border area is divisible by a. The sample's first case includes a=3, which divides 12, so that's okay. \n\nBut why isn't a=4 allowed? Because the edges' lengths must be covered by the tiles. \n\nWait, the tiles can be placed in any orientation, but the edges must be covered. \n\nThe tiles are placed along the border. For each edge, the length must be covered by the tiles' sides. \n\nSuppose a=4. The top edge is 3 units long. The tiles can be placed with their 1 side along the edge. So each tile contributes 1 unit along the edge. So 3 tiles would cover the 3 units. But each such tile would have a length of 4 in the perpendicular direction. But the border's width is only 1 unit (since it's the outer edge). \n\nWait, the border is the outer edge, so the tiles must fit within the border's area. The border is 1 unit thick. So the tiles placed along the edge must have their 1 side along the edge and the other side (a) perpendicular to it, but that would extend into the interior. But the interior is already covered by 1x1 tiles. \n\nAh, right! The border is the perimeter's area. The tiles must be placed on the border, which is 1 unit thick. So the tiles must fit within that 1 unit. \n\nWait, the border is the outer edge, so the tiles must be placed such that their dimensions fit within the border's thickness. \n\nWait, the border is the outer edge of the bathroom. The border's width is 1 unit. So the tiles placed on the border must have one dimension of 1 (since the border is 1 unit thick). \n\nWait, the tiles are 1xa. So when placed along the border, one of their dimensions must be 1 (the thickness of the border). \n\nThus, the tiles must be placed such that their 1 side is along the border's thickness. So the other dimension (a) must be along the length of the edge. \n\nTherefore, for each edge of length s, the length s must be divisible by a. \n\nAh! That's the key constraint. \n\nSo for each edge of length s (either (l-2) or (w-2)), the length s must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, the edges are:\n\nTop and bottom edges (excluding corners) have length (l-2). \n\nLeft and right edges (excluding corners) have length (w-2). \n\nEach of these edges must be covered by tiles placed along them. Since the tiles are 1xa, the a side must be along the edge's length. \n\nThus, the length of each edge must be divisible by a. \n\nTherefore, a must divide both (l-2) and (w-2), or divide one of them and the other can be divided by 1? \n\nWait, no. Because the tiles must be placed along the edge. For example, the top edge has length (l-2). The tiles placed along it must have their a side along that edge. So (l-2) must be divisible by a. Similarly, the left edge has length (w-2), so (w-2) must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but the tiles can be placed in either orientation. Wait, the tile is 1xa. To cover the edge's length, the a side must be along the edge. So the length of the edge must be divisible by a. \n\nThus, a must divide both (l-2) and (w-2). \n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case is w=3, l=5. \n\nThen l-2 =3, w-2=1. \n\nSo a must divide both 3 and 1. The divisors of 1 are 1. So a must be 1. But the sample includes a=2 and 3. \n\nHmm, this contradicts. \n\nWait, in the sample input first case, the valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\nLet me see:\n\nFor a=2:\n\nThe edges:\n\nl-2=3 must be divisible by a=2? 3/2 is 1.5 \u2192 no. \n\nWait that's a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the edge lengths. \n\nWait the top edge is length l-2. For w=3, l=5, the top edge (excluding corners) is 5-2=3 units. \n\nIf a=2, then 3 must be divisible by 2 \u2192 no. So why is a=2 allowed in the sample?\n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nThe sample's first case allows a=2. Let's see why. \n\nThe problem's note says that in the first test case, the valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\nSo for a=2, how does it work?\n\nThe border area is 12, so 12/2=6 tiles. \n\nThe edges:\n\nTop and bottom edges (3 units each). Left and right edges (1 unit each). \n\nFor a=2, the tiles are 1x2. \n\nThe top edge is 3 units. To cover this with tiles of length 2 along the edge, you can't. But perhaps the tiles are placed in a different orientation. \n\nWait, the tiles can be placed with the 1 side along the edge. So the a side (2) is perpendicular to the edge. But the border is only 1 unit thick, so the perpendicular direction can't be 2. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the edges are considered as part of the border's area, and the tiles can be arranged in any way as long as their total area is correct. \n\nThe problem's note says that a=2 is allowed. So there must be a way to arrange the tiles. \n\nMaybe the tiles are placed in such a way that they cover the border's area without requiring each edge's length to be divisible by a. \n\nPerhaps the tiles can be arranged in any orientation as long as the total area is divisible by a. \n\nIn that case, the only constraint is that a divides the border area (2*(w + l -2)). \n\nBut then why in the sample case a=4 is not allowed? Because 12 is divisible by 4. \n\nWait the sample's first case's valid a's are 1,2,3. 4 divides 12, but it's not in the list. \n\nSo there must be another constraint. \n\nAh! The problem says that the tiles are of size 1xa. So each tile has area a. The border area must be divisible by a. \n\nBut also, the tiles must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed along the edges such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nWait, but the edges are part of the border. The border is the outer edge, so the tiles must be placed along the edges. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles can be placed anywhere in the border area, not necessarily along the edges. \n\nThe problem's description says: \"On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1\u00d7a for some positive integer a. The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees.\" \n\nThe \"floor boundary\" is the border area. So the tiles can be placed anywhere in that border area, not necessarily along the edges. \n\nThus, the only constraint is that the border area is divisible by a. \n\nBut then why in the sample case a=4 is not allowed? \n\nWait the sample's first case has border area 12. 12 is divisible by 4. So why isn't a=4 allowed? \n\nThe sample's first case's valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\nHmm, this suggests that there's another constraint. \n\nWait the problem says that the tiles are of size 1\u00d7a. So each tile must have one side of length 1. \n\nThe border area is 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThe tiles must be arranged to cover this area. \n\nThe tiles can be placed in any orientation (rotated 90 degrees), so they can be 1\u00d7a or a\u00d71. \n\nThe total area must be divisible by a. \n\nBut perhaps the tiles must also be placed such that their dimensions fit within the border's dimensions. \n\nThe border is a frame around the interior. The border's width is 1 unit. \n\nWait, the border is the outer edge, so its width is 1 unit. So the tiles placed in the border must have one dimension of 1. \n\nThus, the tiles can be placed in the border as long as their dimensions are 1\u00d7a or a\u00d71, but since the border is 1 unit thick, the other dimension (a) must be along the length of the border. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) is along the length of the border's edges. \n\nBut the border is a rectangular frame. The tiles can be placed anywhere in the border area. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the tiles can be arranged to cover the border area without overlapping and without gaps. \n\nThe only constraint is that the border area is divisible by a. \n\nBut then why in the sample case a=4 is not allowed? \n\nThe sample's first case has border area 12. 12 mod4=0. So a=4 should be allowed. \n\nBut the sample's answer includes a=1,2,3. \n\nThis suggests that there's another constraint. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that a must be at least 1, but also that the tiles can be placed along the edges. \n\nWait, the problem's note says that a can be 1. \n\nLet me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \"On the interior of the floor she wants to use the 1\u00d71 tiles. She needs exactly (w-2)(l-2) of these. On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1\u00d7a for some positive integer a. The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees. For which values of a can Bethany tile the bathroom floor as described?\"\n\nThe key is that the boundary tiles must be placed in the boundary area. The boundary area is the border. \n\nThe tiles must be placed in such a way that they cover the entire boundary area. \n\nThe tiles can be placed in any orientation, but their dimensions must be 1\u00d7a or a\u00d71. \n\nThe total area of the boundary is 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThus, the only requirement is that a divides this area. \n\nBut then why in the sample case a=4 is not allowed? \n\nWait the sample's first case has w=3, l=5. \n\nThe border area is 2*(3+5-2) = 12. \n\nThe valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\n12 is divisible by 4, so why isn't 4 allowed? \n\nAh! Because the tiles must be placed in the border area. The border is a frame of 1 unit width. \n\nThe tiles of size 1\u00d7a must fit within this frame. \n\nThe maximum possible length of a tile in the border is the length of the border's edges. \n\nFor example, the top edge is length 3 (l-2=3). So a tile placed along that edge can have a length of up to 3. \n\nThus, a must be \u2264 the maximum edge length. \n\nWait, but the tiles can be placed anywhere in the border. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles must be placed such that their a dimension does not exceed the length of any edge. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles can be placed in any orientation, but the a must be \u2264 the length of the border's edges. \n\nThe border has edges of lengths (l-2) and (w-2). \n\nThus, a must be \u2264 both (l-2) and (w-2), or at least one of them? \n\nNo, because the tiles can be placed in any orientation. \n\nWait, the tiles can be placed in any orientation, so the a can be along any direction. \n\nBut the border is 1 unit thick. So the tiles must have one dimension of 1. \n\nThe other dimension (a) can be any length, but must fit within the border's length. \n\nFor example, in the sample case, the border has edges of length 3 and 1. \n\nA tile of a=4 would have a dimension of 4. But the border's edges are only 3 and 1 units long. So the tile of length 4 can't be placed along the edges. \n\nThus, the a must be \u2264 the maximum edge length. \n\nWait, but the tiles can be placed in the corners or other parts of the border. \n\nAlternatively, the a must be \u2264 the length of the longest edge in the border. \n\nThe longest edge in the sample case is 3 (the top and bottom edges). \n\nThus, a must be \u22643. \n\nAh! That's the missing constraint. \n\nSo the valid a's are the divisors of the border area (2*(w + l -2)) that are \u2264 the minimum of (l-2) and (w-2) or something else? \n\nWait, the maximum possible a is the maximum edge length. \n\nThe border has edges of lengths (l-2) and (w-2). \n\nThe maximum edge length is max(l-2, w-2). \n\nThus, a must be \u2264 max(l-2, w-2). \n\nWait, but in the sample case, the maximum edge length is 3 (since l-2=3, w-2=1). \n\nThus, a must be \u22643. \n\nSo the valid a's are the divisors of 12 (border area) that are \u22643. \n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n\nThose \u22643 are 1,2,3 \u2192 which matches the sample. \n\nAh! So the constraints are:\n\na must divide the border area (2*(w + l -2)), and a must be \u2264 the maximum of (l-2, w-2). \n\nWait, no. Because the maximum edge length is the maximum between (l-2) and (w-2). \n\nThus, a must be \u2264 the maximum of (l-2, w-2). \n\nWait, but in the sample case, the maximum is 3. So a can be up to 3. \n\nThus, the valid a's are the divisors of the border area that are \u2264 the maximum edge length. \n\nWait, but what about the other edges? \n\nFor example, if a is 3, then the edge of length 1 (w-2=1) must be covered. \n\nThe tiles placed along that edge must have a dimension of 1. \n\nThe tiles can be placed with the 1 side along the edge. \n\nSo the a=3 is allowed because the border area is divisible by 3, and a is \u22643. \n\nThus, the constraints are:\n\na must divide the border area (2*(w + l -2)), and a must be \u2264 the maximum of (l-2, w-2). \n\nWait, but what if the maximum edge length is smaller than a? \n\nFor example, if a is 3 and the maximum edge length is 2, then a can't be used. \n\nThus, the correct conditions are:\n\na must be a divisor of the border area (2*(w + l -2)), and a must be \u2264 the maximum of (l-2, w-2). \n\nWait, but the maximum edge length is the maximum between (l-2) and (w-2). \n\nThus, the a must be \u2264 that maximum. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the border area: area = 2*(w + l -2)\n\nCompute max_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nFind all divisors of area that are \u2264 max_edge. \n\nThese are the valid a's. \n\nSo the code needs to compute all divisors of the border area (2*(w + l -2)), then filter those divisors to be \u2264 max_edge. \n\nNow, looking back at the provided code for program2.py:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2\n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nThe code initializes solutions as {1,2}. \n\nThen loops over i from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter). \n\nWait, but the code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter, not the border area. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to find all divisors of border_area (2*(w + l -2)), then filter them to be \u2264 max_edge. \n\nSo the code should compute all divisors of border_area, then filter them. \n\nThe current code's approach is incorrect. \n\nThe code's current loop is iterating up to sqrt(half_perimeter), but the border area is twice that. \n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted to find divisors of border_area. \n\nLet me think of how to code this. \n\nThe steps for program2.py:\n\nFor each test case (w, l):\n\n1. Compute border_area = 2*(w + l -2)\n\n2. Compute max_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\n3. Find all divisors of border_area. \n\n4. Collect all divisors a where a <= max_edge. \n\n5. Sort them and output. \n\nThe problem is to compute all divisors of border_area efficiently. \n\nThe code provided starts with solutions = {1,2}, but that's not correct. \n\nThe code's current approach is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), but that's not the border area. \n\nSo the code needs to be rewritten. \n\nThe correct approach would be:\n\nborder_area = 2*(w + l -2)\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nCompute all divisors of border_area. \n\nThen filter those divisors to be <= max_edge. \n\nThe code can compute the divisors by iterating up to sqrt(border_area). \n\nSo the code should be:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nThen, for each divisor in divisors:\n\nif a <= max_edge, include it. \n\nBut in the current code's structure, the code is using a loop over i up to sqrt(half_perimeter). \n\nThe code's current code has:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2\n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0: continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO \n\nWait, this seems incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute all divisors of border_area. \n\nThe code should be rewritten to compute all divisors of border_area. \n\nThe code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nThe code's current code has a solutions set initialized to {1,2}. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to find divisors of border_area, but the loop is incorrect. \n\nLet me think of how to fix the code. \n\nThe code should compute all divisors of border_area. \n\nThe code can do this by iterating up to sqrt(border_area). \n\nThe code's current loop is using half_perimeter instead of border_area. \n\nSo the code's loop should be:\n\nborder_area = 2*(w + l -2)\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nsolutions = set()\n\nfor i in range(1, int(border_area**0.5)+1):\n\n    if border_area %i ==0:\n\n        a1 = i \n\n        a2 = border_area//i \n\n        for a in [a1, a2]:\n\n            if a <= max_edge:\n\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nThen, after collecting all such a's, sort them and output. \n\nBut the current code's structure is different. \n\nThe current code's loop is:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0: continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter, but that's not the border area. \n\nThe code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code should compute all divisors of border_area (2*(w + l -2)), then filter those divisors to be <= max_edge. \n\nThus, the missing code in program2.py's TODO section is to add the valid divisors. \n\nThe current code's loop is inside the for i in ... loop. \n\nThe code's current loop is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nThe code's current code has:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    if half_perimeter %i ==0:\n\n        div = half_perimeter//i \n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n\n            mod_a = w % a \n\n            if mod_a <=2:\n\n                # add to solutions?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of border_area (2*half_perimeter) by considering factors of half_perimeter and multiplying by 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of border_area by considering factors of half_perimeter and then multiplying by 2. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute all divisors of border_area. \n\nThe code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nThe code's TODO section is inside a loop that is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to find divisors of border_area by considering factors of half_perimeter and then multiplying by 2. \n\nFor example, if border_area is 2*half_perimeter, then any divisor of half_perimeter is also a divisor of border_area. \n\nAdditionally, the divisors of border_area include those of half_perimeter multiplied by 2. \n\nBut this is getting too involved. \n\nThe correct way to compute all divisors of border_area is to loop up to sqrt(border_area). \n\nThus, the code should be rewritten. \n\nBut given the current code structure, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of border_area by considering factors of half_perimeter and then adding 2*i etc. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nThe problem requires that the code for program2.py must be completed. \n\nThe current code's loop is:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0:\n\n        continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code's current approach is to loop over divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), and for each divisor a (i or div), check if w mod a is <=2. \n\nThis seems unrelated to the problem's constraints. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to find a such that a divides the border area (2*half_perimeter), and also a divides (w-2) or (l-2). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is incorrect and needs to be replaced. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach for the code is to compute all divisors of border_area, then filter them to be <= max_edge. \n\nThus, the code for program2.py should be:\n\nfrom math import sqrt, floor\n\nfrom sys import stdin\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n)) +1):\n\n        if n %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return divisors\n\ndata = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n\nres = []\n\nfor w, l in zip(data[::2], data[1::2]):\n\n    border_area = 2 * (w + l -2)\n\n    max_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(border_area)\n\n    valid = []\n\n    for a in divisors:\n\n        if a <= max_edge:\n\n            valid.append(a)\n\n    valid.sort()\n\n    res.append(f\"{len(valid)} {' '.join(map(str, valid))}\")\n\nprint('\\n'.join(res))\n\nBut the original code uses a different approach. \n\nThe original code's code has:\n\nsolutions = {1,2}\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0:\n\n        continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            #

TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code's current approach is to add a to solutions if mod_a <=2. \n\nBut this is not the correct condition. \n\nThe correct condition is that a must be a divisor of border_area and a <= max_edge. \n\nThus, the code should add a to solutions if a divides border_area and a <= max_edge. \n\nBut since border_area is 2*half_perimeter, and a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then a also divides border_area. \n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nfor a in [i, div]:\n\n    if a <= max_edge:\n\n        solutions.add(a)\n\n    # Also check 2*a?\n\n    # Because border_area is 2*half_perimeter, so 2*a may also be a divisor.\n\n    # For example, if a divides half_perimeter, then 2*a divides border_area.\n\n    # So we need to also consider 2*a.\n\n    # Thus, the code should also check 2*a.\n\n    # So:\n\n    a2 = 2*a \n\n    if a2 <= max_edge and border_area % a2 ==0:\n\n        solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code should compute all divisors of border_area. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct code for the TODO section is to add a to the solutions set if a is a divisor of border_area and a <= max_edge. \n\nBut since the current loop is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter, the code can add a and 2*a. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nsolutions.add(a)\n\nif 2*a <= max_edge and border_area % (2*a) ==0:\n\n    solutions.add(2*a)\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current loop is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nThus, for each such divisor a, it is also a divisor of border_area (since border_area is 2*half_perimeter). \n\nThus, the code can add a to the solutions if a <= max_edge. \n\nAdditionally, 2*a is also a divisor of border_area (since border_area is 2*half_perimeter). \n\nThus, the code should also check if 2*a is a divisor of border_area (which it is) and whether it is <= max_edge. \n\nThus, the code should add both a and 2*a (if applicable). \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2*a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge and border_area % a2 ==0:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut border_area is 2*half_perimeter, so a2 divides border_area if a divides half_perimeter. \n\nThus, the condition border_area % a2 ==0 is redundant. \n\nThus, the code can be:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2*a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nThus, the code's missing part is to add these lines. \n\nBut the current code's loop is inside the for i in ... loop. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut also, the code should consider the other divisors. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is not sufficient. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the correct code for the missing parts. \n\nFor program1.py's missing part (n mod4 ==1):\n\nThe code should print 1, n-3, 1, 1. \n\nFor program2.py's missing part (the TODO section):\n\nThe code should add a to the solutions set if a is a divisor of border_area and a <= max_edge. \n\nBut since the current loop is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter, the code can add a and 2*a. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nThus, the code's TODO section should have these lines. \n\nBut the current code's loop is inside the for i in ... loop. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut also, the code should compute max_edge and border_area. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to add these lines. \n\nBut the current code's variables are:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2 \n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nThus, the code's missing part is to add the above lines and the conditions. \n\nBut the code's current code has:\n\nmod_a = w % a \n\nif mod_a <=2:\n\n    # TODO \n\nThis condition is not needed. \n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO section is to add the a and 2*a to the solutions if they are <= max_edge. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nThus, the code's missing part for program2.py is to add these lines. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe missing code for program1.py is the case when n mod4 ==1:\n\nprint(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nFor program2.py's missing part:\n\nThe code's TODO section should have:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut also, the code needs to compute max_edge and border_area. \n\nWait, the code's current code has:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2 \n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nThese variables are needed. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to add these lines before the loop. \n\nBut the current code's code does not have these variables. \n\nThe current code's code has:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2 \n\nsolutions = {1,2}\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0:\n\n        continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThus, the code's current code does not compute max_edge or border_area. \n\nThus, the code's missing part must include the computation of max_edge and border_area. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge and border_area % a2 ==0:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut since border_area is 2*half_perimeter, and a divides half_perimeter, then a2 divides border_area. \n\nThus, the condition can be omitted. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut the code's current code does not have these variables. \n\nThus, the code's missing part must include these variables and the conditions. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the final answer based on the above analysis. \n\nThe final answer for program1.py's missing part is the case when n mod4 ==1:\n\nprint(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nFor program2.py's missing part, the code's TODO section should add a and 2*a to the solutions if they are <= max_edge. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut also, the code must compute max_edge and border_area. \n\nThus, the code's missing part includes:\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nBut since the code's current code does not have these variables, the code must be modified. \n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe code's current code for program2.py has the loop:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0:\n\n        continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code here is to add a to the solutions if it is a divisor of border_area and <= max_edge. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nif a <= max_edge and border_area % a ==0:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\nBut since a is a divisor of half_perimeter, border_area % a ==0 is true. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nThus, the code's missing part for program2.py is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut also, the code must compute max_edge and border_area. \n\nThus, the code's missing part includes adding these variables before the loop. \n\nBut since the user requires only the missing lines for the TODO section, the code's missing part is the lines inside the loop's condition. \n\nThus, the code's missing part for the TODO section is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut the code must have max_edge defined. \n\nThus, the code's missing part also includes adding:\n\nmax_edge = max(l-2, w-2)\n\nborder_area = 2 * half_perimeter \n\nBut since the code's current code does not have these variables, the code must be modified. \n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThus, the code's missing part for program2.py is the lines inside the loop's condition. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe missing code for the elif n%4==1 block is:\n\nprint(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\n\nFor program2.py's TODO section:\n\nThe missing code is:\n\nif a <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\na2 = 2 * a \n\nif a2 <= max_edge:\n\n    solutions.add(a2)\n\nBut also, the code must compute max_edge and border_area. \n\nThus, the code's missing part includes adding these variables before the loop. \n\nBut since the user requires only the missing lines for the TODO section, the code's missing part is the lines inside the loop's condition. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"print(1, n-3, 1, 1, end=' ')\",\n  \"program2\": \"if a <= max_edge:\\n    solutions.add(a)\\n    a2 = 2 * a\\n    if a2 <= max_edge:\\n        solutions.add(a2)\"\n}"
