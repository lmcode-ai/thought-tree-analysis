  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first. \n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum possible MEX of the set formed by the bitwise AND prefixes of a walk between two nodes. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The challenge is to process multiple queries efficiently given the constraints.\n\nLooking at the provided code for program1.py, it seems like it's using some form of Union-Find (disjoint set) structures. The code has a Dsu (Disjoint Set Union) class. The incomplete parts are in the loops where they process edges for different bits. \n\nThe first missing part is in the loop for the 'd' DSU array. The comment says to do something when the weight's ith bit is set. The code is inside a loop over each bit (i from 0 to 29?), and for each edge, if the weight has the ith bit set, they might be trying to union the nodes. Wait, the code in the first loop for 'd' is:\n\nfor i in range(30):\n    for j in range(m):\n        u, v, w = edges[j]\n        if (w >> i & 1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nHmm, perhaps here they are trying to group nodes where the path between them can have edges with that bit set. Maybe for each bit, they are creating a DSU where nodes are connected if there's a path where all edges have that bit set. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, the problem requires that the MEX is determined by the AND prefixes. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set of all prefix ANDs. \n\nThe key insight here is that the minimal MEX is determined by the smallest missing integer in the set of all possible prefix ANDs. To minimize the MEX, we want the set to include 0, 1, 2, etc., up to some point. The minimal possible MEX would be the first missing integer. \n\nThe approach in the code seems to be trying to find for each bit whether it can be part of the path. For example, if there's a path where the AND of the edges includes a certain bit, then that bit can contribute to the set. \n\nLooking at the code's 'd' DSUs: perhaps for each bit i, d[i] is a DSU where two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them where all edges have the ith bit set. Because if such a path exists, then the AND of the edges along that path would have the ith bit set. Wait, but the AND of the edges along the path would have the bit set only if all edges in the path have that bit set. So, if there's a path between u and v where all edges have the ith bit set, then the AND of that path's edges would have the ith bit set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the DSU for d[i] is grouping nodes that can reach each other via edges that have the ith bit set. So, if two nodes are in the same set in d[i], then there exists a path between them where all edges have the ith bit set. \n\nThe code then checks for each query whether u and v are in the same set in d[0]. Because if they are, then the path's edges all have the 0th bit set, so the AND of the entire path would have the 0th bit set. The set of prefix ANDs would include that, so the MEX could be 0? Wait, no. Wait, the MEX is the smallest non-present number. If the set includes 0, then the MEX would be the next missing. \n\nWait, the code's answer function has a loop over i from 0 to 29. For each bit i, if u and v are in the same set in d[i], then the answer is 0? Because the MEX would be 0 only if 0 is not present. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code's logic here. Let me look at the code's answer part:\n\nIn the code's answer function for each query:\n\nans = 2 (initially)\nfor i in 0..29:\n    if d[i].find(u) == d[i].find(v):\n        ans = 0\n        break\n\nWait, so if for any bit i, there's a path between u and v where all edges have the ith bit set, then the answer is 0? That can't be right. Because the MEX would depend on the set of all prefix ANDs. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal possible MEX. The minimal possible MEX is 0 if 0 is not in the set. Wait, the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set. So if the set contains 0, then the MEX could be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to find the minimal possible MEX by considering different scenarios. Let me think again. \n\nThe minimal possible MEX is 0 only if 0 is not present in the set. To have 0 not present, the set must not contain 0. But how can that happen? The set is the collection of all prefix ANDs. The first element is the first edge's weight. So if the first edge's weight is non-zero, then 0 is not in the set. But then the MEX would be 0. \n\nWait, for example, if the path has edges with weights 1, 3, then the prefixes are 1, 1&3=1. The set is {1}, so MEX is 0. \n\nAlternatively, if the path has edges with weights 2 (binary 10), then the set is {2}, so MEX is 0. \n\nSo the minimal possible MEX is 0 if there exists a path where the first edge's weight is non-zero, and the AND of all edges along the path does not include 0. Wait, but the MEX is the smallest non-present. So if the set includes 0, then the MEX can't be 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is trying to find whether there exists a path where the AND of all edges along the path has a certain bit set. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic for the first part (the 'ans' being 0) is checking if there exists a path between u and v where all edges have the ith bit set. If so, then the AND of the entire path would have that bit set, so the set of prefix ANDs would include that bit. \n\nWait, but the MEX is the smallest missing. So if the set includes all numbers from 0 up to some k, then the MEX is k+1. \n\nThe minimal possible MEX is 0 only if 0 is not in the set. To get 0 in the set, there must be a prefix where the AND is 0. \n\nAlternatively, the code's first check is for whether there exists a path where all edges have the 0th bit set. Because if so, then the AND of the path would have the 0th bit set, so the set would include that, but maybe not 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal possible MEX by considering different cases. \n\nLooking at the code's 'ans' variable: initially set to 2. Then, if any of the d[i] DSUs have u and v in the same set, then ans is set to 0. \n\nWait, maybe the idea is that if there exists a path where all edges have a certain bit set, then the MEX can be 0. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal possible MEX by considering the bits. Let me think of the possible scenarios:\n\nThe minimal possible MEX can be 0, 1, or higher. \n\nThe minimal possible MEX is 0 if 0 is not present in the set. To have 0 not present, the set must not contain 0. \n\nHow can the set not contain 0? The set is the collection of all prefix ANDs. The first element is the first edge's weight. So if the first edge's weight is non-zero, then 0 is not in the set. \n\nWait, but the first edge's weight could be 1, so the first element is 1. The next edges could be 3, so the next AND is 1 & 3 = 1. So the set is {1}, so MEX is 0. \n\nSo in that case, the MEX is 0. \n\nAlternatively, if the first edge's weight is 0, then the set contains 0, so the MEX would be 1 if 1 is missing, etc. \n\nSo the minimal possible MEX is 0 if there exists a path where the first edge's weight is non-zero, and the entire path's ANDs never reach 0. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal MEX can be 0, so the code's first check is whether there exists a path where the edges have some bit set such that the MEX can be 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal MEX by considering the bits. \n\nLooking at the code's 'd' DSUs: for each bit i, the DSU groups nodes that can be connected via edges that have the ith bit set. \n\nWait, the code for 'd' is:\n\nfor i in range(30):\n    for j in range(m):\n        u, v, w = edges[j]\n        if (w >> i & 1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nAh, the condition is checking if the ith bit of w is set. So for each edge with that bit set, we need to union u and v in the DSU for that bit. \n\nWait, so for each bit i, the DSU d[i] connects all nodes that can be reached via edges that have the ith bit set. So, if two nodes are in the same set in d[i], then there exists a path between them where all edges along the path have the ith bit set. \n\nTherefore, if u and v are in the same set in d[i], then there exists a path between them where all edges have the ith bit set. The AND of all edges along that path would have the ith bit set. \n\nThe first part of the code's query processing checks for each bit i whether u and v are in the same set in d[i]. If so, then the MEX can be 0? Because the set of prefix ANDs would include the ith bit. \n\nWait, but how does that lead to MEX being 0? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal possible MEX. Let me think of the possible scenarios:\n\nThe minimal possible MEX is 0 if there exists a path where the set of prefix ANDs does not include 0. \n\nTo have 0 not in the set, the first edge's weight must be non-zero, and all subsequent ANDs must also not be zero. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal MEX can be 0, 1, or higher. \n\nThe code's first check is for any bit i where u and v are connected in d[i]. If so, then the MEX can be 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is that if there exists a path where all edges have a certain bit set, then the MEX can be 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to find the minimal possible MEX by considering the bits. \n\nAlternatively, the code's first part (the loop over i in 0 to 29) is checking if there exists a path between u and v where all edges have the ith bit set. If so, then the AND of the entire path would have that bit set, so the set of prefix ANDs would include that bit. \n\nWait, but the MEX is the smallest missing. So if the set includes all numbers up to some k, then the MEX is k+1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is that the minimal possible MEX is the smallest bit that is not present in the set of all possible ANDs. \n\nAlternatively, the code's first check is for whether there exists a path where the edges have a certain bit set. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's first part (the loop over i) is checking if there exists a path between u and v where all edges have the ith bit set. If so, then the AND of the entire path would have that bit set, so the set of prefix ANDs would include that bit. \n\nBut how does that help in determining the MEX? \n\nAlternatively, the code's first part is trying to see if there's a path where the AND of all edges along the path has a certain bit set. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal MEX is 0 if there exists a path where the first edge's weight is non-zero, and the entire path's ANDs never reach 0. \n\nAlternatively, the code's first part is trying to find if there exists a path where the AND of all edges along the path has a certain bit set. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's first part is trying to find whether there exists a path between u and v where the AND of all edges along the path has a certain bit set. \n\nWait, the code's first part for the query is:\n\nfor i in 0..29:\n    if d[i].find(u) == d[i].find(v):\n        ans = 0\n        break\n\nSo if for any bit i, there exists a path between u and v where all edges have the ith bit set, then the answer is 0. \n\nWait, but why would that make the MEX 0? \n\nSuppose the path has edges with the ith bit set. The first edge's weight has that bit set, so the first prefix is that weight. The AND of all edges along the path will have that bit set. So the set of prefix ANDs will include numbers with that bit set. \n\nThe MEX would be the smallest non-present number. For example, if the set includes 1 (bit 0 set), then the MEX is 0 if 0 is not present. \n\nWait, but if the first edge's weight is 1 (bit 0 set), then the first prefix is 1. The next edges could be 3 (binary 11), so the next AND is 1 & 3 = 1. The set is {1}, so the MEX is 0. \n\nSo in that case, the MEX is 0. \n\nSo the code's first check is correct in that case. \n\nTherefore, the first part of the code's query processing is correct. \n\nNow, the code's next part is when ans is still 2 (meaning none of the bits have a path between u and v with all edges having that bit set). Then, it checks for the 'value' array. \n\nLooking at the code for the 'zero' DSUs and 'value' array:\n\nThe 'zero' DSUs are for bits from 1 to 29. The code loops over edges and if the edge's weight has the 0th bit set (since w & 1 is true) and also has the ith bit set (w >> i & 1), then it unions u and v in zero[i]. \n\nWait, the code for 'zero' is:\n\nfor i in range(1, 30):\n    for j in range(m):\n        u, v, w = edges[j]\n        if (w & 1) and (w >> i & 1):\n            zero[i].union(u, v)\n\nWait, the condition is that the 0th bit (since w &1) is set, and the ith bit is also set. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is for edges that have both the 0th and ith bits set. \n\nThen, the 'value' array is initialized to 2 for all. Then, for each edge, if the node u is part of a set where zeronotset[u] is true (which is set if the node is connected via edges with even weights?), then the value[i][zero[i].find(u)] is set to 1. \n\nWait, the 'zeronotset' array is initialized as [False, ...], and for each edge with even weight (w &1 ==0), then u and v's zeronotset is set to True. \n\nWait, the code for zeronotset:\n\nzeronotset = [False]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(m):\n    u, v, w = edges[i]\n    if w &1 ==0: # even weight\n        zeronotset[u] = True\n        zeronotset[v] = True\n\nSo, for any node that is part of an edge with even weight, their zeronotset is set to True. \n\nThen, for each i from 1 to 29, the value[i][zero[i].find(u)] is set to 1 if zeronotset[u] is True. \n\nWait, the code for value:\n\nfor i in range(1, 30):\n    for j in range(m):\n        u, v, w = edges[j]\n        if zeronotset[u]:\n            value[i][zero[i].find(u)] = 1\n        if zeronotset[v]:\n            value[i][zero[i].find(v)] = 1\n\nHmm, perhaps the 'value' array is indicating whether in the DSU for zero[i], the component has a node that is connected via an edge with even weight. \n\nThe idea might be that if there's a path between u and v in the zero[i] DSU (which requires that the path has edges with both 0th and ith bits set), and also that component has a node connected via an even edge, then the MEX can be 1. \n\nThe code's second part in the query processing is:\n\nif ans ==2:\n    for i in 1..29:\n        if value[i][zero[i].find(u)] ==1:\n            ans =1\n            break\n\nSo, if there exists a bit i (from 1 to 29) where the component of u in zero[i]'s DSU has a value of 1 (meaning that component has a node connected via an even edge), then the answer is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the minimal MEX can be 1 in such cases. \n\nPutting this all together, the code's logic is trying to find the minimal possible MEX by checking for different conditions. \n\nNow, the missing code in the first part (the 'd' DSUs) is in the loop for d[i]. The code for 'd' is:\n\nfor i in range(30):\n    for j in range(m):\n        u, v, w = edges[j]\n        if (w >> i &1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nAh, right, the code here is supposed to union u and v in the d[i] DSU if the edge's weight has the ith bit set. \n\nWait, the condition is (w >> i) &1, which checks if the ith bit is set. So for each edge with that bit set, we need to union u and v in d[i]'s DSU. \n\nTherefore, the missing code here is:\n\nd[i].union(u, v)\n\nSo, the code for that part is:\n\nd[i].union(u, v)\n\nSo that's the first missing part. \n\nNow, looking at the second program (program2.py), the problem is to determine if array a can be transformed into array b by applying any number of operations where each operation subtracts 1 from every non-zero element. \n\nThe code for solve(a, b) is incomplete. The function is supposed to check if it's possible. \n\nThe approach here is to find a certain 'd' which is the number of operations. For each element a[i], after d operations, the value would be a[i] - d if a[i] >=d, else 0. So, for the array to reach b, for each i, either:\n\nb[i] = a[i] - d (if a[i] >=d), or b[i] =0 (if a[i] <d). \n\nAdditionally, all elements of b must be <= a[i]. \n\nMoreover, the minimal possible d is the maximum (a[i] - b[i]) for all i where b[i]>0. Because for those elements, d must be exactly a[i] - b[i]. For elements where b[i] is 0, d can be any value >= a[i]. \n\nWait, but for elements where b[i] is 0, the required d must be >= a[i]. Because after d steps, a[i] -d must be <=0. \n\nSo, the minimal possible d is the maximum between (a[i] - b[i]) for all i where b[i]>0, and the a[i] for all i where b[i] is 0. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose for some i where b[i] is 0, then d must be >= a[i]. \n\nFor elements where b[i] is positive, d must be exactly a[i] - b[i]. \n\nSo, the required d must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. For all i where b[i] >0: d = a[i] - b[i]\n\n2. For all i where b[i] =0: d >= a[i]\n\nSo, the first condition requires that all a[i] - b[i] (for b[i]>0) must be equal. Let's call this value d_candidate. \n\nThen, the second condition requires that d_candidate >= a[i] for all i where b[i] is 0. \n\nAdditionally, all b[i] must be <= a[i], otherwise it's impossible. \n\nSo, the steps for the solve function should be:\n\n- Check if any b[i] > a[i]. If yes, return NO. \n\n- Collect all the (a[i] - b[i]) for elements where b[i] >0. \n\n- If there are no such elements (all b[i] are 0), then it's possible (since d can be any value >= max(a[i])). \n\nWait, but in that case, the required d must be at least the maximum a[i], because for each element with b[i]=0, d must be >= a[i]. \n\nWait, if all b[i] are zero, then d must be >= all a[i]. So the minimal possible d is the maximum a[i]. \n\nBut the problem allows any number of operations, so as long as d is >= max(a[i]), then it's possible. \n\nSo, in that case, the answer is YES. \n\nBut in the code's current solve function, the first loop is:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if b[i] >0:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code is trying to find the minimal d. \n\nThe code's current approach is to set d as the minimal possible. \n\nThe code's initial 'd' is set to inf. \n\nThen, for each i where b[i] >0, the required d is a[i] - b[i]. So the minimal possible d is the maximum of all (a[i] - b[i]) for those i. \n\nWait, no. Because all those (a[i] - b[i]) must be equal. \n\nWait, no. The problem requires that for all elements with b[i]>0, the d must be exactly a[i] - b[i]. So all those a[i] - b[i] must be the same. \n\nAh, right! That's a crucial point. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if any b[i] > a[i]. If yes, return NO. \n\n2. Collect all the (a[i] - b[i]) for elements where b[i] >0. \n\n3. If there are any such elements, check if all of them are equal. Let that value be d_candidate. \n\n4. Then, check that for all elements where b[i] is 0, a[i] <= d_candidate. \n\n5. Also, check that d_candidate is non-negative (since b[i] can't be more than a[i], but since we already checked that, it's okay). \n\n6. If all these conditions are met, then return YES. \n\nAlternatively, if there are no elements with b[i]>0 (all b[i] are 0), then d must be at least the maximum a[i]. So in that case, it's possible (since you can choose d as the maximum a[i], or higher). \n\nSo, the code's current approach is trying to compute d as the minimal possible. \n\nLooking at the code's current code:\n\ndef solve(a, b):\n    inf = 2 * 10 ** 6\n    d, n = inf, len(b)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if b[i] >0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    # b[i] > a[i]\n    if d <0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    # All elements of b are 0s\n    if d == inf:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        return\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] - b[i] > d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        if b[i] >0 and a[i] - b[i] < d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    # all a[i] - b[i] == d\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nHmm, the code's initial 'd' is set to inf. \n\nThe first loop is for elements where b[i] >0. \n\nThe code needs to compute d as the required value. \n\nThe current code's first loop is incomplete. \n\nThe correct approach is:\n\n- For all elements where b[i] >0, collect their (a[i] - b[i]). \n\n- If any of these values are different, then it's impossible. \n\n- So, the first loop should find the first such value and then check all others against it. \n\nAlternatively, the code can set d to the first (a[i] - b[i]) and then check all others. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute the minimal d as the maximum of (a[i] - b[i]) for all b[i]>0. Wait no, because all must be equal. \n\nWait, the required d must be exactly equal to a[i] - b[i] for all elements where b[i]>0. So all those a[i] - b[i] must be the same. \n\nTherefore, the code should:\n\nInitialize d as None. \n\nFor each i where b[i] >0:\n\n    if d is None: d = a[i] - b[i]\n\n    else: if current (a[i] - b[i]) != d \u2192 return NO. \n\nThen, after that, check for all elements with b[i] ==0: a[i] <=d. \n\nAlso, check that d is non-negative (but since we already checked b[i] <=a[i], this is okay). \n\nSo, the code's first loop should be:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if b[i] >0:\n        current = a[i] - b[i]\n        if d == inf:\n            d = current\n        else:\n            if current != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the first loop is inside the function. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize d as None. \n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n    if b[i] >0:\n\n        if d is None:\n\n            d = a[i] - b[i]\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a[i] - b[i]) != d \u2192 return NO\n\nThen, after that, check for all elements with b[i] ==0 \u2192 a[i] <=d. \n\nAlso, check that d is non-negative (but since b[i] <=a[i], this is okay). \n\nAdditionally, if there are elements with b[i]>0, then d must be >=0. \n\nSo, the code's first loop should be handling this. \n\nIn the current code's first loop, the code is:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if b[i] >0:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code here is to compute d. \n\nSo, the code should be:\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if b[i] >0:\n            current = a[i] - b[i]\n            if d == inf:\n                d = current\n            else:\n                if current != d:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n    # After the loop, check if d is still inf (all b are zero)\n    # Then, proceed. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, 'd' is initialized to inf. \n\nSo, the code's first loop would set d to the first a[i]-b[i], then check others. \n\nThen, after the loop, if there were any elements with b[i]>0, then d is set. \n\nThen, the code checks if d <0 \u2192 but since we already checked that b[i] <=a[i], this can't happen. \n\nWait, but the code's first check after the loop is:\n\nif d <0 \u2192 print NO. \n\nBut since b[i] can't be greater than a[i], then a[i] -b[i] is non-negative. So d can't be negative. \n\nSo that check is redundant. \n\nThen, the code proceeds. \n\nThe next part is:\n\nif d == inf \u2192 all elements are zero \u2192 then answer is YES. \n\nElse, check for all elements:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if a[i] - b[i] >d \u2192 which would be for elements where b[i] is zero \u2192 a[i] must be <=d. \n\n    So, if a[i] -b[i] (which is a[i] since b[i] is zero) >d \u2192 then a[i] >d \u2192 which violates the condition. \n\n    So, in that case, return NO. \n\n    Also, for elements where b[i]>0, a[i] -b[i] must equal d \u2192 so if a[i] -b[i] <d \u2192 which would mean that the current a[i] -b[i] is less than d, which can't happen because we already checked that all are equal. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the second condition is:\n\nif b[i] >0 and a[i] -b[i] <d \u2192 which would only be possible if there was a discrepancy in the first loop. \n\nBut since the first loop already ensures that all a[i]-b[i] for b[i]>0 are equal to d, this condition can't be true. \n\nTherefore, the code's second loop is checking two things:\n\n- For elements with b[i] ==0 \u2192 a[i] must be <=d. \n\n- For elements with b[i]>0 \u2192 their a[i]-b[i] must equal d. \n\nThe first part (a[i] -b[i] >d) \u2192 for b[i] ==0 \u2192 a[i] must be <=d. \n\nThe second part (b[i]>0 and a[i]-b[i] <d) \u2192 but since a[i]-b[i] is exactly d, this can't happen. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct. \n\nSo, the missing code in the first loop is to set d and check for equality. \n\nTherefore, the code for the first loop in solve(a, b) should be:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if b[i] >0:\n        current = a[i] - b[i]\n        if d == inf:\n            d = current\n        else:\n            if current != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\nSo, that's the missing code. \n\nPutting it all together, the missing parts are:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nIn the first loop for d[i], the code should union u and v in d[i]. \n\nThe missing line is:\n\nd[i].union(u, v)\n\nSo, the code for that part is:\n\nfor i in range(30):\n    for j in range(m):\n        u, v, w = edges[j]\n        if (w >> i) & 1:\n            d[i].union(u, v)\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nIn the first loop of the solve function, the code needs to set d and check for equality. \n\nThe missing code is:\n\ncurrent = a[i] - b[i]\nif d == inf:\n    d = current\nelse:\n    if current != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\nSo, the code for the first loop is:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if b[i] >0:\n        current = a[i] - b[i]\n        if d == inf:\n            d = current\n        else:\n            if current != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nFor program1.py's missing part: the line d[i].union(u, v)\n\nFor program2.py's missing part: the code inside the first loop as above. \n\nNow, formatting the answers as per the required JSON structure. \n\nThe program1's missing code is in the first loop for d[i], so the code to add is:\n\nd[i].union(u, v)\n\nThe program2's missing code is in the first loop over the elements where b[i]>0, so the code to add is the block:\n\ncurrent = a[i] - b[i]\nif d == inf:\n    d = current\nelse:\n    if current != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\nSo, putting it all into the JSON format as specified."
