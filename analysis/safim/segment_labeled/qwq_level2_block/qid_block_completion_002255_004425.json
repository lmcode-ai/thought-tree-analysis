  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a set of vertices in a tree forms a passable set. A passable set means there exists a path in the tree that goes through all the vertices in the set without traversing any edge more than once. The key here is that the path must be a simple path (so it can't loop), and the set's vertices must lie along this path.\n\nHmm, how do I check this? Well, the path in a tree between any two nodes is unique. So, for the set to be passable, all the selected nodes must lie on some path between two nodes. That path's endpoints would be the two farthest nodes in the set. So the idea is: find the minimum and maximum in the set's BFS order, or maybe the two endpoints of the diameter of the induced subtree? Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimum and maximum in terms of their positions along some path, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the set must form a subtree that is a path. So the subtree induced by the set must be a path. So the subtree must be a straight line. So, the subtree's structure must be a path. To check this, the subtree must have exactly two nodes of degree 1 (the endpoints) and the rest of degree 2. Except if there's only one node, then it's okay.\n\nWait, but the subtree induced by the set might not be connected. Wait, no, because the original tree is connected. So the induced subtree is connected. So the induced subtree must be a path. So the subtree must be a path. So the subtree must have exactly two leaves (degree 1 in the subtree) and all others have degree 2. Except if the subtree is a single node, which is okay.\n\nSo the approach would be: take the set of nodes, find their induced subtree. Check if that subtree is a path. How to do this efficiently?\n\nBut for each query, the set can be up to n nodes, but n is 2e5 and q is 5, so it's manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the induced subtree's structure?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal and maximal distance from some node? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the set is passable if the path between the two farthest nodes in the set (the diameter of the induced subtree) includes all other nodes. So, the diameter's endpoints are two nodes in the set, and all other nodes lie on the path between them.\n\nSo, to check this, first find the two nodes in the set that are the farthest apart (the diameter endpoints). Then, check if all other nodes in the set lie on the path between these two.\n\nSo steps for each query:\n\n1. Find the two nodes in the set with maximum distance between them (u and v).\n2. Find the path between u and v. Check if all nodes in the set are on this path.\n\nIf yes, then it's passable. Otherwise, no.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, for a given set S, how do I find the two nodes with maximum distance?\n\nIn a tree, the diameter is the longest path between any two nodes. So for the induced subtree (which is a tree), the diameter's endpoints are the two nodes with maximum distance. So first, pick any node in S, BFS to find the farthest node in S, then BFS again from that node to find the farthest node in S. Those two are the endpoints of the diameter.\n\nOnce we have u and v, the path between them is the unique path in the tree. Then, all nodes in S must lie on this path.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each query:\n\n- Collect all the nodes in the set S.\n- If the set is empty, trivial yes? But according to input constraints, k is at least 1.\n- Find the two nodes u and v in S that are the endpoints of the diameter of the induced subtree.\n- Find the path between u and v. Check if all nodes in S are on this path.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFirst, the problem is that for each query, the set can be up to n nodes, but with q=5, it's manageable.\n\nBut for each query, the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the two farthest nodes in S (u and v). To do this:\n\n   a. Pick any node in S, say s0. BFS to find the farthest node in S from s0 (call it u).\n\n   b. Then BFS from u to find the farthest node in S (call it v). The distance between u and v is the diameter.\n\n2. Then, find the path between u and v. All nodes in S must be on this path.\n\nBut how to check if all nodes in S are on the path between u and v?\n\nThe path between u and v can be found via BFS or DFS, but perhaps a better way is to track the parent pointers during BFS from u, then trace back to v.\n\nAlternatively, once we have the path, we can collect all nodes along it and check if every node in S is in that path.\n\nBut for large n, this could be O(n) per query, but since q is small (5), it's okay.\n\nSo the plan for program1.py is:\n\nFor each query:\n\n- Read the set S.\n\n- If the set has 0 or 1 elements, output YES.\n\nElse:\n\n   Find u and v as the two endpoints of the diameter of the induced subtree.\n\n   Find the path between u and v.\n\n   Check if all elements of S are on this path.\n\n   If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code?\n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code has a function f(x, pre) which seems to be a DFS or BFS. The code is incomplete. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe code starts with:\n\ndef f(x, pre):\n    global flg; dp=[0]*(n+1)\n    q=deque([(x,pre)]); R=[]\n    while q:\n        u,p = q.popleft()\n        R.append(u)\n        for v in g[u]:\n            if v != p: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code is trying to traverse the tree, but the loop is incomplete. The for loop over v in g[u] is missing the part where it adds to the queue. The original code's TODO is here. So perhaps the code is supposed to perform a BFS here, adding the children (excluding parent) to the queue.\n\nSo the code is building a list R of nodes in some traversal order. Then, after the BFS, it processes the nodes in reverse order (R[::-1]).\n\nThe variables dp[u] is being tracked. The code is trying to compute something here. The function f is called with (1,0), which is the root (assuming 1-based nodes). The code then sets flg (a global variable) to 1, and s is the set of the current query.\n\nThe code's logic is unclear. Maybe the approach in the code is different from what I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check if the set forms a path by ensuring that in the subtree induced by the set, each node (except the ends) has exactly two neighbors in the set, and the ends have one.\n\nWait, the code's function f is trying to compute some DP. Let me see:\n\nIn the code's function f:\n\nAfter the BFS, for each node in R reversed (so from leaves to root?), it's setting dp[u] to 1 if u is in the set s. Then, for each neighbor v, it's adding the dp[v] to dp[u], and tracking the number of paths (path variable). The flg is set to flg and (path <=1 or path ==2 and k == dp[u]).\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that for each node, the number of children in the set must be at most 1, except for the endpoints which can have 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to check that the set forms a path. The DP might be counting the number of nodes in the set along the path. The condition path <=1 or path ==2 and k == dp[u] might be ensuring that each node has at most two directions (so forming a path).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Since the code is incomplete, perhaps the missing part is in the BFS loop.\n\nLooking at the code's first loop (the BFS part):\n\nThe code is doing a BFS starting at x (initially 1), with parent pre. For each node u, it loops through its neighbors v. If v is not the parent, then the code is missing the part where it adds v to the queue. So the code should have something like q.append( (v, u) ), so that the BFS proceeds.\n\nSo the missing code in the first TODO is:\n\nq.append( (v, u) )\n\nSo that the BFS proceeds.\n\nThen, after the BFS, the code processes the nodes in reverse order (R[::-1]). The R list is the order of nodes visited in BFS, so reversed would be from the last node to the first. Not sure why that's done.\n\nThe next part of the code:\n\nfor u in R[::-1]:\n    path = 0\n    dp[u] += 1 if u in s else 0\n    for v in g[u]:\n        if v != p: # Wait, p is the parent from the BFS? Or is p here the parent in the current traversal?\n        # Wait, in the loop, p is the parent from the BFS. But here, in this loop, the code is looping over all neighbors v of u. So for each neighbor except the parent (since in the BFS, we track parent), but here, the code may not be checking that.\n\nWait, the code's for v in g[u] loop here is in the processing after the BFS. So for each neighbor v of u, regardless of whether it's the parent or not. But in the DP step, perhaps we need to consider only the children in the BFS tree.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute for each node u, the sum of dp[v] over its children (excluding parent). The path variable counts how many children have non-zero dp[v], which would indicate directions where the path can go.\n\nThe condition flg = flg and (path <=1 or path ==2 and k == dp[u]) is trying to ensure that each node has at most two directions (so forming a path). The path variable is the number of children (excluding parent?) that have dp[v] >0. So for a node in the middle of the path, it can have two children (so path=2?), but only if the total dp[u] equals the sum of the children plus 1 (if it's in the set). Wait, maybe the logic is that each node can have at most two children in the path, and the total count must be consistent.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the code's approach is to check that the set forms a path by ensuring that the nodes form a connected path where each node (except the ends) has exactly two neighbors in the set, and the ends have one. The DP approach might be trying to track this.\n\nBut regardless, the first missing part is in the BFS loop where the code needs to add the child to the queue. So the first TODO is to add q.append( (v, u) ).\n\nNow, looking at the code's main loop:\n\nfor each query:\n\n   k = int(input()); flg =1; s = set of the query's nodes.\n\n   f(1,0) is called. Then, print based on flg.\n\nWait, but the function f is called with (1,0), which is the root. The function f is supposed to compute whether the set is a path. The flg is a global variable that is set to 1 initially, and during the function, it's updated based on the conditions.\n\nBut perhaps the function f is supposed to traverse the tree and check the conditions. However, the code may have some errors. For example, the initial call to f(1,0) may not be the best starting point. Maybe the root should be chosen as part of the set S? Or perhaps the code is not handling the case where the set is not connected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is to check that the set forms a path by ensuring that the entire set is connected and that the induced subtree is a path. The DP approach might be trying to track the number of nodes in the set along each path.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct missing code for program1.py is just adding the q.append in the first loop.\n\nSo the first TODO is to add the line:\n\nq.append( (v, u) )\n\nNow moving to program2.py.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make all elements in some copy of the array equal. The operations allowed are cloning an array (which increases the number of copies by one) and swapping elements between any two copies (any positions).\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of operations (clones plus swaps) needed to have at least one copy where all elements are the same.\n\nThe note example shows that for [0,1,3,3,7,0], the minimal operations are 6. Let's see how that works.\n\nThe approach here is to find the optimal target value (the one that requires the least operations). For each possible target value, compute the minimal operations needed to turn one of the copies into all that value, then choose the minimal among all targets.\n\nThe key is to find for each value x in the array, the minimal number of operations required to have all elements in some copy be x.\n\nThe operations allowed are:\n\n1. Cloning: each clone adds a new copy. Each clone costs 1 operation.\n\n2. Swaps between any two copies. Each swap can exchange two elements between any two copies. The swaps can be done any number of times, but each swap is an operation? Wait, no, the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies on any positions. You can do this any number of times, but each swap is an operation. Wait, the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies on any positions. You need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\nWait, the problem says the operations are:\n\n- Choose any array and clone it. This is one operation.\n\n- Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe same copy) on any positions. Each swap is an operation?\n\nWait, the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions. You need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\nWait, the problem's note example says that in the second test case, the answer is 6. Let me see:\n\nThe array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The minimal steps are:\n\n- Clone the array (1 operation). Now there are two copies.\n\n- Then perform swaps between the two copies to move all 0s into one array. The note's explanation says that after swapping, one array has all 0s. But how many swaps?\n\nWait, the note's example says that after cloning, they can swap elements so that all 0s are in one array. The first array becomes [0,0,0,0,7,0], but that's not all 0s. Wait, perhaps the example's explanation is a bit different. The note's example's final step is after creating a copy of the first array again, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose the target is x. Let's say the original array has m occurrences of x. To create a copy with all x's, you need to have enough copies so that the total number of x's across all copies is at least the length of the array. Because each element in the target array must come from some copy's element.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that each element in the target array must be an x from some copy. So the total number of x's across all copies must be at least n (the length of the array). Because each of the n positions in the target array must have an x, and each x can come from any copy.\n\nThe number of copies starts at 1. Each clone adds a copy. So after c clones, there are c+1 copies. The total number of x's is (c+1)* (count_x) (assuming all copies have the same count of x as the original array? Wait no, because when you clone, you get an exact copy. So each clone adds a copy with the same count of x as the original. So the total x's across all copies is (original_count_x) * (number of copies).\n\nWait, the original array has count_x elements of x. Each clone adds a copy with the same count. So after c clones, there are (c+1) copies, each with count_x x's. So total x's is (c+1)*count_x.\n\nTo have at least n x's, we need (c+1)*count_x >= n. The minimal c needed is ceil(n/(count_x)) -1. Because (c+1) must be at least ceil(n/count_x). So c = ceil(n/count_x) -1.\n\nBut then, once you have enough copies, you can arrange the x's into one array via swaps. The number of swaps needed would be (n - count_x) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the swaps can move the x's into one array. The number of swaps required would be the number of non-x elements in that array. Because each non-x element must be swapped with an x from another copy. But each swap can exchange one non-x with an x. So the number of swaps needed is (n - count_x) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the swaps can be done in (n - count_x) steps. Because for each non-x in the target array, you need to replace it with an x from another copy. Each swap can fix one element. So the number of swaps is exactly (n - count_x).\n\nBut the total operations would be the number of clones (c) plus the number of swaps (s). So total_ops = c + s.\n\nBut c is ceil(n/count_x) -1, and s is (n - count_x). Wait, but when you have enough copies, the total x's is (c+1)*count_x >=n. So the minimal c is ceil(n/count_x) -1.\n\nWait, let me see with the example in the note:\n\nThe array is [0,1,3,3,7,0], so n=6. The count of 0 is 2. So count_x=2.\n\nThen c = ceil(6/2) -1 = 3-1=2? Wait, ceil(6/2) is 3, so c=2. So clones needed: 2.\n\nThen the number of swaps would be 6-2 =4? But the note's answer is 6. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait the note's example's answer is 6. Let's see:\n\nThe example's explanation says that they did 6 operations. Let's see:\n\nThe steps in the note's explanation:\n\n1. Clone the array (1 operation). Now two copies.\n\n2. Swap elements between the two copies to get one array with all 0s. But how?\n\nWait, the first array after cloning has two copies. The first array has two 0s. To get a copy with all 0s, you need to have 6 0s. So the total x's (0's) across all copies must be at least 6. The original count is 2. So (c+1)*2 >=6 \u2192 c+1 >=3 \u2192 c=2. So two clones (total copies 3). Then the total 0's are 3*2=6. So then, you can arrange all 0's into one array via swaps. The number of swaps needed would be (6-2) per copy? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of swaps needed is (n - count_x) multiplied by the number of copies? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is (number of clones) + (number of swaps). The swaps can be done in (n - count_x) steps, but perhaps the clones are needed first.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me re-calculate for the note's example:\n\nThe target is 0. The count_x is 2.\n\nThe minimal number of clones needed is ceil(6/2) -1 = 3-1=2 clones. So after 2 clones, there are 3 copies. Total 0's: 3*2=6. So to get one array with all 0's, you need to take one array and replace all non-0 elements with 0's from other copies. Each non-0 element in that array must be swapped with a 0 from another copy. The number of non-0 elements in the target array is 4 (since original array has 2 zeros, so in the target array, initially it has 2 zeros, but we need to replace the other 4 elements with zeros from other copies). Each swap can replace one element. So 4 swaps. So total operations: 2 clones +4 swaps =6, which matches the example. So that works.\n\nAnother example: if the target is 3, which has count 2 (positions 3 and 4). Then:\n\nceil(6/2) -1 = 2 clones (total copies 3). Total 3*2=6 3's. So swaps needed: 6-2 =4. Total 2+4=6. But maybe there's a better target?\n\nWait, what if the target is 3? The count is 2. So same as 0. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, if the target is 1, count is 1. Then ceil(6/1) -1 =5 clones (so 6 copies). Then swaps needed 5. Total 5+5=10, which is worse.\n\nSo the minimal is indeed 6.\n\nSo the formula for a target x with count m is:\n\nclones_needed = max(0, ceil(n/m) -1 )\n\nswaps_needed = n - m\n\ntotal_ops = clones_needed + swaps_needed\n\nWait, but wait: the clones_needed is ceil(n/m) -1 ?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nclones_needed = (ceil(n/m) -1). Because the number of copies needed is ceil(n/m). So the number of clones is (ceil(n/m) -1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each x in the array, compute this total_ops, and choose the minimal among all x's.\n\nBut what if m=0? Then x is not present in the array, so it's impossible. But the problem says the array has elements, so m can't be zero.\n\nWait, the problem allows any target, but the target must be present in the array. Because otherwise, you can't get any x's. So the target must be one of the existing elements.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Find the frequency of each element in the array.\n\n- For each element x with frequency m:\n\n   compute required_clones = ceil(n/m) -1\n\n   required_swaps = n - m\n\n   total_ops = required_clones + required_swaps\n\n- The minimal total_ops over all x is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait: required_swaps is n - m? Or is it (n - m) * something?\n\nWait, the swaps needed would be the number of non-x elements in the target array. Each such element must be replaced with an x from another copy. Each swap can replace one element. So the number of swaps needed is exactly (n - m). Because each non-x in the target array must be swapped with an x from another copy. Each swap can handle one such element. So yes, swaps_needed is (n - m).\n\nThus, the formula is correct.\n\nSo the code for program2.py should:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read the array, count the frequency of each element.\n\n- For each x in the frequency dictionary:\n\n   m = count[x]\n\n   if m ==0: skip (but can't happen)\n\n   compute clones_needed = ceil(n/m) -1\n\n   total_ops = clones_needed + (n - m)\n\n- Find the minimal total_ops among all x's.\n\nNow, the code provided for program2.py is:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, the code is reading lines from the input. The input is multiple test cases. The code is using [2::2], which suggests that the input lines are being read, but perhaps the code is not correctly parsing the test cases.\n\nWait, the code's first line is for li in [*open(0)][2::2]. That's probably incorrect. Because the input has multiple test cases, each with two lines: the first line is n, then the array. So the code is trying to read the array lines (the second line of each test case), but perhaps the code is not handling the test cases properly.\n\nAlternatively, the code is written in a way that for each test case, the array is read as li, split into elements, and then the code proceeds.\n\nBut the current code's logic is:\n\nans = n - m (where m is the maximum frequency). Then, it enters a loop while m <n, but the loop is empty. So the code is incorrect.\n\nThe correct approach is to compute for each x in the array's elements, the required_ops, then take the minimum.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead each test case:\n\nRead n, then the array.\n\nCompute the frequency counts.\n\nFor each x in the counts:\n\n   m = count[x]\n\n   required_clones = (ceil(n/m) -1)\n\n   total_ops = required_clones + (n - m)\n\n   keep track of the minimum.\n\nThus, the code needs to be rewritten.\n\nThe provided code's current structure is incorrect. Let's see:\n\nThe code is written as:\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nThis is probably wrong. The [2::2] is taking every second line starting from index 2, which may not be correct. Also, the code is not handling the test cases properly.\n\nThe correct code should process each test case as follows:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   read n.\n\n   read the array (as a list of elements).\n\n   compute frequencies.\n\n   compute for each x in frequencies:\n\n      compute the required_ops.\n\n   take the minimum.\n\nThus, the code should be structured as:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    cnt = Counter(a)\n    min_ops = float('inf')\n    for x, m in cnt.items():\n        if m ==0:\n            continue\n        clones = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1  # ceil(n/m) is (n +m-1)//m\n        swaps = n - m\n        total = clones + swaps\n        if total < min_ops:\n            min_ops = total\n    print( min_ops )\n\nWait, yes. Because ceil(n/m) is (n + m -1) // m.\n\nSo the code for program2.py should be written like this.\n\nBut the given code's structure is different. The user's code for program2.py is:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nThis code is trying to process each test case's array line (assuming that the first line is t, then each test case has two lines: n and the array, so the array lines are every second line starting from the second line). But the code is using [2::2], which would start at the third line (index 2) and take every second line. That's probably wrong.\n\nThe correct way to read the input is to read all lines, then process each test case properly. But given the code's current structure, perhaps the user's code is trying to process each array line (the second line of each test case) as li, and then compute the answer.\n\nBut the code's current approach is to take the maximum frequency m, then compute ans =n -m, but that's only considering the case where the target is the most frequent element. Which is not correct, because sometimes a less frequent element may have a better total_ops.\n\nFor example, in the note's example, the maximum frequency is 2 (for 0,3, etc). So ans would be 6-2=4, but the correct answer is 6. So the code is wrong.\n\nThus, the code needs to loop over all possible x's and compute the minimal total_ops.\n\nThe missing code in the TODO section is to compute the minimal over all x's.\n\nThe current code's structure is incorrect. The user's code is supposed to complete the code, so perhaps the code should be rewritten.\n\nBut given the problem's instruction, the user's code for program2.py has a TODO in the while loop. The code currently has:\n\nwhile(m <n):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut the code's logic is flawed. The correct approach is to compute for all x's, not just the maximum frequency.\n\nThus, the correct code would replace the entire block with the correct logic. But given the code's current structure, perhaps the user's code is supposed to compute the minimal over all x's, but the code is written in a way that the TODO is in a loop that's not needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to compute for each x, but the current code is using the maximum frequency and then trying to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is to compute the minimal operations as (n - m) + (ceil(n/m) -1). But the code is not doing that.\n\nThe correct code would need to loop over all elements in the Counter and compute the minimal.\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to replace the entire code with the correct approach. But given the problem's instruction, the user must output only the missing lines.\n\nLooking back at the problem's instruction for program2.py's code:\n\nThe code provided is:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nThe code is trying to process each test case's array (li is the array's elements as a list). The current code computes m as the maximum frequency. Then ans is n - m (the swaps needed if we have enough clones). But the clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). So the total_ops would be (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n -m).\n\nWait, the current code's ans is n -m, but that's only the swaps part. The clones part is missing.\n\nSo the code's ans is wrong. The correct ans should be (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n -m). But the code is using ans =n -m, which is only part of it.\n\nThe while loop is while m <n, but that's not helpful. So the code is incorrect.\n\nThe correct code should compute for each x in the Counter, then take the minimum.\n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO section is to replace the entire block with the correct logic. But since the user must output only the missing lines, perhaps the code should be modified to loop over all elements.\n\nAlternatively, the code's current structure is wrong, and the correct code would need to be written from scratch, but the problem requires to fill in the missing parts.\n\nThe problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for each program. So the user must fill in the missing parts in the given code.\n\nLooking at the code for program2.py:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nThe code is processing each test case's array (li is the array elements as a list). The variable m is the maximum frequency. The ans is set to n -m (the swaps part). The while loop is while m <n, but it's empty. The code then prints ans, which is wrong.\n\nThe correct approach is to compute the total_ops for the maximum frequency element, but that may not be the minimal. So the code is incorrect.\n\nThe correct code should compute for all elements, not just the maximum.\n\nThus, the code's TODO section is in the while loop, but that's not the right place. The correct code should replace the entire block with the correct logic.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, perhaps the code can be fixed by replacing the while loop with the correct calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should compute the minimal over all possible x's. So the code should loop through all elements in the Counter and compute the minimal.\n\nThus, the missing code would be to replace the code after m = max(...) with a loop over all elements.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing lines. The code's current structure has a while loop that is not needed. So the correct code would be to remove the while loop and compute the minimal over all elements.\n\nBut how to do that in the given code's structure?\n\nAlternatively, the code can be rewritten as follows:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor li in ...:\n\n    n = len(...)\n\n    m = max(...)\n\n    ans = n -m\n\n    while (m <n):\n\n        # TODO\n\n    print(ans)\n\nThe correct code should instead compute for all elements in the Counter.\n\nThus, the missing code would be to replace the entire block with:\n\n    cnt = Counter(li)\n    min_ops = float('inf')\n    for x, freq in cnt.items():\n        required_clones = ( (n + freq -1) // freq ) -1\n        total = required_clones + (n - freq)\n        if total < min_ops:\n            min_ops = total\n    ans = min_ops\n    print(ans)\n\nThus, the code's TODO section is in the while loop, but the correct code would replace the entire block from m = max(...) onward.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing lines. The user must output the code to fill in the TODO sections.\n\nThe first TODO in program1.py is to add the q.append( (v, u) ) in the first loop.\n\nThe second TODO in program2.py is to replace the while loop with the correct code.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing lines. For program2.py's code, the missing code is the part inside the while loop, but the while loop itself is not needed. So perhaps the correct approach is to replace the while loop with the code that loops over all elements.\n\nBut the problem's instruction says to output the missing code, not the entire program. So for program2.py's code, the missing code is the part inside the while loop, but the code is structured incorrectly. So perhaps the correct code for the TODO is to compute the minimal over all elements, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is to compute the maximum frequency m, then compute the required clones as (ceil(n/m) -1), and then the total_ops is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n -m). But the code currently has ans =n -m, which is only the swaps part. So the missing code is to compute the clones part and add it to ans.\n\nThus, the code inside the while loop (which is not needed) can be replaced with:\n\nclones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\nans = clones_needed + (n - m)\n\nBut the while loop is not needed. So perhaps the code should remove the while loop and compute that.\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation of clones_needed and ans.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing lines. The code's current structure has a while loop with a TODO. So the missing code would be to replace the while loop with the code that calculates the clones_needed and ans.\n\nBut the problem says to output the missing code, not the entire program. So for program2.py's code, the missing code is the part inside the while loop, but the code is incorrect. So perhaps the correct code for the TODO is to compute the clones_needed and ans, but the while loop is not needed. So the code should be:\n\nThe code's current line after m = max(...) is:\n\nans =n -m\n\nThen, the while loop is:\n\nwhile(m <n):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code inside the while loop should compute the clones_needed and add it to ans. But the while loop is not needed. So perhaps the correct code is to remove the while loop and compute:\n\nclones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\nans = clones_needed + (n - m)\n\nBut then, the code would be:\n\nfor li in ...:\n\n    n = len(...)\n\n    cnt = Counter(li)\n\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n\n    clones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\n    ans = clones_needed + (n - m)\n\n    print(ans)\n\nBut this would only consider the maximum frequency element, which may not be optimal. For example, in the note's example, the maximum frequency is 2 (for 0 and 3), so the code would compute clones_needed = (6+2-1)//2 -1 \u2192 (7//2)=3 \u2192 3-1=2. ans = 2 +4 \u21926, which is correct. But if there is another element with a lower frequency but better total_ops, it would not be considered. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct code must consider all elements, not just the maximum frequency one.\n\nTherefore, the code must loop over all elements in the Counter and compute the minimal.\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to replace the entire block from m = max(...) onward with the code that loops over all elements and computes the minimal.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing lines. The code's current structure has a while loop with a TODO. So the correct code for the TODO is to compute the minimal over all elements, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is wrong and the correct code must be written from scratch. But the problem requires to fill in the missing parts in the given code.\n\nPerhaps the code's current structure is incorrect, but the user must fill in the missing parts. The code's current structure is:\n\nfor each array line (li):\n\n    n = len(li)\n\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n\n    ans = n -m\n\n    while (m <n):\n\n        # TODO\n\n    print(ans)\n\nThe code's ans is n -m (swaps part). The while loop is not needed. The missing code is to compute the clones_needed and add it to ans.\n\nThus, the code inside the while loop (which is not needed) can be replaced with:\n\nclones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\nans += clones_needed\n\nThen, the while loop can be removed. But the while loop is there, so perhaps the code should have:\n\nThe code's current line after m = max(...) is:\n\nans =n -m\n\nThen, the while loop is:\n\nwhile(m <n):\n\n    # compute clones_needed and add to ans?\n\nWait, but m is fixed as the maximum frequency. So the while loop is redundant. So the code should compute clones_needed as (ceil(n/m) -1), then ans += clones_needed.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nclones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\nans += clones_needed\n\nBut the while loop is not needed. So the code should remove the while loop and add this code.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nfor li in ...:\n\n    n = len(...)\n\n    cnt = Counter(li)\n\n    m = max(cnt.values())\n\n    clones_needed = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n\n    ans = clones_needed + (n - m)\n\n    print(ans)\n\nThis would compute the required_ops for the maximum frequency element, but not the minimal.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. The correct code must consider all elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct code for program2.py is to loop over all elements in the Counter and compute the minimal.\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to replace the entire block from m = max(...) onward with the code that loops over all elements and computes the minimal.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing lines. The code's current structure has a while loop with a TODO. So the correct code for the TODO is to compute the minimal over all elements, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is wrong and the correct code must be written, but the problem requires to fill in the missing parts.\n\nPerhaps the code's current structure is incorrect, but the user must fill in the missing parts. The code's current code has a while loop that is not needed. The correct code would replace the while loop with a for loop over all elements.\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\nThe code after m = max(...) is:\n\n    min_ops = float('inf')\n    for x, freq in Counter(li).items():\n        clones = ( (n + freq -1) // freq ) -1\n        total = clones + (n - freq)\n        if total < min_ops:\n            min_ops = total\n    ans = min_ops\n    print(ans)\n\nThus, the missing code for the TODO section (inside the while loop) is not applicable, but the code must be rewritten. Since the problem requires to output the missing code, perhaps the correct answer is to replace the while loop with the for loop.\n\nBut the problem's instruction says to output only the missing lines. The code's current structure has a while loop with a TODO. So the missing code is to replace the while loop with the code that loops over all elements and computes the minimal.\n\nThus, the code for program2.py's missing part is:\n\nThe code inside the for loop (for each test case) should be:\n\n    cnt = Counter(li)\n    min_ops = float('inf')\n    for x, freq in cnt.items():\n        clones_needed = ( (n + freq -1) // freq ) -1\n        total = clones_needed + (n - freq)\n        if total < min_ops:\n            min_ops = total\n    ans = min_ops\n    print(ans)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to replace the existing code from m = max(...) onward with this code.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing lines. The existing code has:\n\nm = max(Counter(li).values())\nans =n-m\nwhile(m<n):\n    # TODO: Your code here\nprint(ans)\n\nThe missing code is to replace the while loop and the lines before it with the code that loops over all elements. So the code to fill in the TODO is to replace the entire block with the correct code. But since the problem requires to output the missing lines, perhaps the correct answer is to output the code that replaces the while loop with the for loop.\n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is the code that loops over all elements and computes the minimal.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the line q.append( (v, u) ) in the first loop.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the code that loops over all elements in the Counter and computes the minimal total_ops.\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\nprogram1's missing code is the line to add to the first loop's if condition:\n\nq.append( (v, u) )\n\nprogram2's missing code is the code that replaces the while loop and computes the minimal over all elements. The code inside the for loop (for each test case) should be:\n\ncnt = Counter(li)\nmin_ops = float('inf')\nfor x, freq in cnt.items():\n    clones_needed = ( (n + freq -1) // freq ) -1\n    total = clones_needed + (n - freq)\n    if total < min_ops:\n        min_ops = total\nans = min_ops\nprint(ans)\n\nThus, the JSON output should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"q.append((v, u))\",\n  \"program2\": \"    cnt = Counter(li)\\n    min_ops = float('inf')\\n    for x, freq in cnt.items():\\n        clones_needed = ( (n + freq -1) // freq ) -1\\n        total = clones_needed + (n - freq)\\n        if total < min_ops:\\n            min_ops = total\\n    ans = min_ops\\n    print(ans)\"\n}\n\nWait, but the program2's code's existing code has:\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nThe missing code is to replace the lines from m = max(...) onward with the new code. So the code after n = len(...) should be:\n\n    cnt = Counter(li)\n    min_ops = float('inf')\n    for x, freq in cnt.items():\n        clones_needed = ( (n + freq -1) // freq ) -1\n        total = clones_needed + (n - freq)\n        if total < min_ops:\n            min_ops = total\n    ans = min_ops\n    print(ans)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the code that replaces the existing lines from m = max(...) onward. So the code to fill in the TODO is to replace the while loop and the preceding lines with the new code. But since the problem requires to output only the missing lines, perhaps the code to be filled in the TODO section is the entire block of code that replaces the existing code.\n\nBut the problem's instruction says to output the missing code, not the entire program. So the code for program2's missing part is the code that replaces the existing code from m = max(...) onward. Thus, the code to be filled in the TODO section (which is inside the while loop) is not applicable, but the correct code is to replace the entire block.\n\nHowever, the problem's instruction says to output the missing code, so perhaps the correct answer is to output the code that replaces the while loop and the preceding lines.\n\nThus, the program2's completion is the code block that replaces the existing code from m = max(...) onward.\n\nSo the program2's completion is:\n\n    cnt = Counter(li)\n    min_ops = float('inf')\n    for x, freq in cnt.items():\n        clones_needed = ( (n + freq -1) // freq ) -1\n        total = clones_needed + (n - freq)\n        if total < min_ops:\n            min_ops = total\n    ans = min_ops\n    print(ans)\n\nThus, the JSON should have this as the program2's completion.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are as above."
