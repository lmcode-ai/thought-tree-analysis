The key here is understanding how each B_k contributes to C. Each B_k is the array where the first k elements of A are sorted, and the rest remain as in A. The sum C is the element-wise sum of all these B arrays. Hmm, so for each position i in C, the value c_i is the sum of the i-th elements of all B_1 to B_n. Let's think about how each element in A contributes to the sum. Wait, for each position j in A, how many times does a[j] appear in the B arrays? Let's see. For B_k where k >= the position's index (assuming 1-based?), or maybe 0-based? Let me clarify the indices. Let's assume the array is 0-based for simplicity. Suppose the original array is A[0..n-1].",

  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe problem for program1 is to find the original binary array A given the sum array C. The key here is understanding how each B_k contributes to C. Each B_k is the array where the first k elements of A are sorted, and the rest remain as in A. The sum C is the element-wise sum of all these B arrays.\n\nHmm, so for each position i in C, the value c_i is the sum of the i-th elements of all B_1 to B_n. Let's think about how each element in A contributes to the sum. \n\nWait, for each position j in A, how many times does a[j] appear in the B arrays? Let's see. For B_k where k >= the position's index (assuming 1-based?), or maybe 0-based? Let me clarify the indices. Let's assume the array is 0-based for simplicity. \n\nSuppose the original array is A[0..n-1]. For B_k (the result of f(k, A)), the first k elements are sorted. So for each position i (0-based), in B_k, the element at i is part of the sorted first k elements if k > i. Otherwise, if k <=i, then it's the original A[i]. Wait no, no. Wait, when k is the parameter for f(k,A), the first k elements are sorted. So for B_k, the first k elements are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the rest are as in A. \n\nSo for each B_k, the element at position i is:\n\n- if i < k: part of the first k elements sorted, so it's the i-th element in the sorted first k elements of A.\n\n- else: same as A[i].\n\nTherefore, the sum C[i] is the sum over all k from 1 to n of the value at position i in B_k.\n\nHmm, the challenge is to reconstruct A from C. \n\nThe approach probably involves figuring out the positions where A has 0 or 1, such that when all the B_k arrays are summed, they give C. \n\nLet me think of the example given. The example input C was [2,4,2,4], and the correct A was [1,1,0,1]. Let's see how that works. \n\nWait in the example explanation, the B arrays are:\n\nB_1: [1,1,0,1] (sorted first 1 elements: just the first element, so [1], so the first element is 1, others same as A. Wait the original A in that example was [1,1,0,1], so B_1 is [1,1,0,1]. \n\nB_2: first two elements sorted. The first two elements of A are [1,1], so sorted is same, so B_2 is same as A. \n\nB_3: first three elements sorted. The first three elements of A are [1,1,0], sorted becomes [0,1,1], so the third element becomes 1. So B_3 is [0,1,1,1]. \n\nWait the example's C is [2,4,2,4]. Let me see the sum:\n\nFor position 0 (assuming 0-based?), the first element in each B:\n\nB_1: 1, B_2:1, B_3:0, B_4:0. Sum is 1+1+0+0 = 2. Which matches the first element of C. \n\nHmm, so the key is to find A such that for each position i, the sum over all k from 1 to n of the value in B_k's i-th position equals C[i].\n\nNow, how to reverse-engineer this. Let's think of each position i in A. Let's denote A[i] as a binary variable (0 or 1). \n\nThe contribution of A[i] to C[i] comes from all B_k where k <=i. Because when k <=i, the i-th element in B_k is the original A[i], since the first k elements are sorted, but the i-th element is beyond the first k elements. Wait no, when k is the parameter, the first k elements are sorted. So for B_k, the element at position i is part of the sorted first k elements only if i <k. Wait, no. Wait, the first k elements are sorted, so the i-th element (for i <k) is part of the sorted first k elements. The elements from i >=k are as in A. \n\nWait, for B_k, the first k elements are sorted, so the i-th element (for i <k) is part of the sorted array. The rest (i >=k) are as in A. \n\nTherefore, for each position i in the array, the value in B_k's i-th position is:\n\n- if k <i: then the i-th element is A[i], since it's beyond the first k elements. \n\n- if k >=i: then the i-th element is part of the first k elements sorted. \n\nWait, but the first k elements are sorted, so the i-th element (for i <k) is in the sorted array. So the value at position i in B_k is the i-th element of the sorted first k elements of A. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the contribution of each A[i] to the sum C. Let's think of each A[i] as 0 or 1, and see how it contributes to each C[j].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the sorted prefixes. Let me think of the process in reverse. \n\nSuppose we want to find A such that when we compute all B_k arrays and sum them, we get C. \n\nLet me think of the elements of A in reverse order. Let's start from the end. \n\nThe last element (position n-1) is only affected by B_k where k >=n (since when k is n, the entire array is sorted, so the last element is part of the sorted array. Wait, but for B_n, the entire array is sorted, so the last element is the nth element of the sorted array. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the example again. \n\nIn the example where A is [1,1,0,1], the C array is [2,4,2,4]. \n\nLooking at the first element (index 0):\n\nIn B_1, it's 1 (since the first element is sorted, so it's the same as A[0]). \n\nIn B_2, it's the first element of the first two elements sorted. Since A[0] and A[1] are 1 and 1, so sorted gives 1, so B_2[0] is 1. \n\nIn B_3, the first three elements are [1,1,0], sorted to [0,1,1], so B_3[0] is 0. \n\nIn B_4, the entire array is sorted to [0,1,1,1], so B_4[0] is 0. \n\nSo the sum for index 0 is 1+1+0+0 = 2. \n\nHmm, so the first element's contribution comes from when k is 1 and 2, but when k is 3 and 4, it's part of the sorted first k elements. \n\nThe problem is to find A such that for each position i, the sum over all B_k's i-th elements equals C[i]. \n\nAn alternative approach: Let's think of the contribution of each A[i] to the sum. \n\nWait, for each position i in A, the value A[i] contributes to the sum C[j] for j >=i? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the sorted prefixes. Let me think of the sorted array up to k elements. \n\nSuppose we have the array A. Let's denote S_k as the sorted array of the first k elements of A. \n\nThen, for each B_k, the first k elements are S_k, and the rest are as in A. \n\nThe sum C is the sum over all B_1 to B_n. \n\nSo for each position i in 0..n-1, the value C[i] is the sum over all k from 1 to n of (B_k[i]). \n\nBreaking this down:\n\nFor each i, the B_k[i] is:\n\n- if k <i: then B_k[i] is A[i], since the first k elements are sorted, but i is beyond k, so it's A[i].\n\n- if k >=i: then B_k[i] is the i-th element of the sorted first k elements of A. \n\nWait, when k >=i, the first k elements are sorted, so the i-th element in B_k is the i-th element of the sorted first k elements. \n\nHmm, so for each i, the contribution to C[i] is:\n\nsum_{k=1 to i-1} A[i] (since for k <i, B_k[i] = A[i])\n\nplus sum_{k=i to n} (the i-th element of S_k, where S_k is the first k elements sorted). \n\nSo the total is (i-1)*A[i] (since for k from 1 to i-1, there are (i-1) terms) plus the sum over k from i to n of S_k[i]. \n\nWait, but S_k is the sorted array of the first k elements. The i-th element of S_k (since k >=i) is the i-th element in the sorted list of the first k elements. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this with the number of 1's in the first k elements. Let me think of the sorted array S_k. Since all elements are 0 or 1, the sorted array will have all 0's first, then 1's. So the number of 1's in the first k elements is the count of 1's in A[0..k-1]. Let's denote cnt[k] as the number of 1's in the first k elements of A. \n\nThen, the sorted array S_k will have (k - cnt[k]) 0's followed by cnt[k] 1's. \n\nTherefore, for any position i (0-based) in the first k elements (i <k), the value S_k[i] is 0 if i < (k - cnt[k]), else 1. \n\nWait, because the first (k - cnt[k]) elements are 0, then the rest are 1. \n\nSo for position i in the first k elements (i <k), S_k[i] is 0 if i < (k - cnt[k]), else 1. \n\nHmm, so the i-th element of S_k is 1 if i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nAlternatively, the i-th element is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is greater than or equal to (i +1 - (k - cnt[k]))? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the position where the 0's end is at (k - cnt[k]) -1. So for i >= (k - cnt[k]), the element is 1. \n\nSo S_k[i] = 1 if i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nTherefore, for each i and k >=i, the contribution to C[i] from B_k is 1 if i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nHmm, but how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached greedily. Let's think of building the array A from right to left. \n\nSuppose we process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me think of the last element (position n-1). \n\nFor this position, the contribution to C[n-1] comes from all B_k where k <n (since when k <n, the element is A[n-1], and when k >=n, it's part of the sorted first n elements. \n\nWait, when k =n, the entire array is sorted, so the last element is the nth element of the sorted array. Since all elements are 0 or 1, the last element of the sorted array is 1 if there's at least one 1 in the array. \n\nHmm, but this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the contribution of A[i] to C[i]. \n\nThe first part of the contribution is (i) * A[i], since for k from 1 to i, the element is part of the first k elements when k >=i? Wait no. Wait for k from 1 to i-1, the element is A[i], so the count is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nWait, for position i, the contribution from k <i is (i terms? Wait, for k from 1 to i-1, there are (i-1) terms, each contributing A[i]. \n\nThen, for k >=i, the contribution is the sum over k from i to n of S_k[i], where S_k is the sorted first k elements. \n\nHmm, but how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that the sum C[i] can be expressed in terms of the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nWait, let's think of the sorted array S_i. The first i elements of B_i are S_i. So for B_i, the i-th element is S_i[i-1] (assuming 0-based). Wait, maybe I need to clarify indices again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the optimal A can be constructed by greedily setting each bit based on the current C array. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can start by initializing A as all 1's, then adjust based on the C array. \n\nWait, the code given in program1.py starts with ret = [1]*n. Then, in a loop over i from 0 to n-1, it does some operations. \n\nLooking at the code's current state:\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    num = list(map(int , input().split()))\n    ret = [1]*n\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = num[i]\n        if j == 0 or ret[i] == 0:\n            j += i\n        if j < n:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    print(*ret)\n\nHmm, the code is trying to set the elements of ret (the A array) based on the C array. \n\nThe initial approach is to set all to 1, then for each position i, perhaps adjust based on the current value. \n\nThe loop is over each i from 0 to n-1. \n\nThe variable j is initialized as num[i], which is the C[i] value. \n\nThen, if j is 0 or ret[i] is 0 (but initially ret[i] is 1, so this condition would only trigger if j is 0), then j +=i. \n\nWait, perhaps this is part of some calculation. \n\nThe code is incomplete, so the TODO is where the missing code is. \n\nThe problem is to find the correct code to fill in the missing parts. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to track the number of 1's in the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following idea: \n\nThe sum C[i] can be written as the sum over all k from 1 to n of B_k[i]. \n\nFor each position i, the contribution from B_k where k <i is A[i] multiplied by (i terms?), but actually for k from 1 to i-1, so (i-1) terms. \n\nThen, for k >=i, the contribution is the value of the i-th element in the sorted first k elements. \n\nThe total is (i-1)*A[i] + sum_{k=i}^n (S_k[i] where S_k is the first k elements sorted). \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that the sum for each position i can be expressed in terms of the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nWait, let's think of the sorted array S_k. The first k elements sorted. The number of 1's in the first k elements is cnt[k]. \n\nThe i-th element in S_k (for k >=i) is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (k - cnt[k]))? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the i-th element in S_k is 1 if the count of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (number of 0's in first k elements)). \n\nWait, the first (k - cnt[k]) elements are 0, so the i-th element is 1 if i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nSo S_k[i] = 1 if i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nTherefore, for each k >=i, the contribution to C[i] is 1 if i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nHmm, but how to compute this sum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total contribution from the terms where k >=i is equal to the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i +1 - (k - cnt[k]))? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following: \n\nThe sum over k from i to n of S_k[i] is equal to the number of k in [i, n] where the i-th element in the sorted first k elements is 1. \n\nWhich is equivalent to the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i +1 - (k - cnt[k]))? \n\nAlternatively, the condition is that the number of 1's in the first k elements (cnt[k]) is >= (i +1 - (k - cnt[k]))? \n\nWait, the i-th element in S_k is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (number of 0's in first k elements)). \n\nWait, the number of 0's in first k elements is (k - cnt[k]). So the position where the 0's end is at (k - cnt[k]) -1. So the i-th element is 1 if i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nSo the condition is i >= (k - cnt[k]). \n\nRearranged, this is cnt[k] >= (k -i). \n\nSo for each k >=i, the contribution is 1 if cnt[k] >= (k -i). \n\nTherefore, the total contribution from the terms where k >=i is the number of k in [i, n] where cnt[k] >= (k -i). \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the sum C[i] must equal (i-1)*A[i] + the number of k >=i where cnt[k] >= (k -i). \n\nBut this seems difficult to compute. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this with the following approach: \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning. Let's think of the last element first. \n\nFor the last element (position n-1), the contribution to C[n-1] comes from all B_k where k <n (since for those, the element is A[n-1], and for k =n, it's part of the sorted array. \n\nWait, for k =n, the element is the nth element of the sorted array. Since all elements are 0 or 1, the last element of the sorted array is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the array. \n\nHmm, but this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following approach inspired by the sample code. \n\nThe code starts with ret (the A array) as all 1's. \n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-1, it does some calculation. \n\nThe variable j is initialized as num[i], which is the C[i] value. \n\nThen, if j is 0 or ret[i] is 0 (but initially ret[i] is 1, so this condition is only true if j is 0), then j +=i. \n\nWait, perhaps this is part of a calculation to determine how many times the element is 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nWait, let's think of the following idea: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each position i, the current value of A[i] (ret[i]) can be determined based on the current C[i] and the previous counts. \n\nLet me think of the contribution of A[i] to the C array. \n\nThe contribution of A[i] to C[i] is (i) * A[i] (since for k from 1 to i, when k <i, the element is A[i], and when k =i, the element is part of the sorted first i elements. Wait, no. \n\nWait, for position i, the contribution from B_1 to B_{i-1} is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThen, for B_i to B_n, the contribution depends on the sorted first k elements. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that the sum C[i] must be equal to (i-1)*A[i] plus the number of k >=i where the i-th element in the sorted first k elements is 1. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the sum C[i] must be equal to the number of times the i-th element is 1 in all B_k arrays. \n\nEach B_k array's i-th element is 1 if either:\n\n- k <i: then it's A[i], so contributes 1 if A[i] is 1.\n\n- k >=i: then it's part of the sorted first k elements. The i-th element in the sorted array is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (number of 0's in first k elements)). \n\nAlternatively, the i-th element in the sorted first k elements is 1 if the count of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (k - count_1)). \n\nWait, count_1 is the number of 1's in first k elements. \n\nThe number of 0's is k - count_1. \n\nThe position where the 0's end is at (k - count_1) -1. \n\nSo the i-th element is 1 if i >= (k - count_1). \n\nRearranged, count_1 >= (k -i). \n\nSo for each k >=i, the contribution is 1 if count_1 (first k elements) >= (k -i). \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the sum C[i] must be equal to the number of k in [1, n] where either:\n\n- k <i and A[i] is 1, or \n\n- k >=i and the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i). \n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to model this with a greedy approach. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the sample code. \n\nThe code starts with all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i, it checks if the current C[i] is less than the current contribution. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet's denote the current count of 1's in the first i elements as cnt. \n\nInitially, since all are 1's, cnt = i+1 (for the first i elements). \n\nWait, but perhaps the code is trying to adjust the array so that the sum C[i] is satisfied. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process each position i from 0 to n-1. \n\nAt each step, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nThe decision must ensure that the sum C[i] is satisfied. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the contribution of A[i] to the C array. \n\nThe contribution of A[i] to C[i] is (i) * A[i] plus some terms from the sorted arrays. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the sum C[i] must be at least the number of times A[i] is counted in the first part (i terms) plus the contributions from the sorted arrays. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nWe can process the array from right to left. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet's track the number of 1's in the suffix. \n\nWait, perhaps the following idea: \n\nThe last element (position n-1) can only be 0 or 1. \n\nThe contribution to C[n-1] is: \n\nFor all k from 1 to n-1: the element is A[n-1], so contributes A[n-1] * (n-1) terms. \n\nPlus, for k =n, the element is the nth element of the sorted array. \n\nThe sorted array of all elements will have all 0's first, then 1's. So the last element is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the array. \n\nSo the contribution from k =n is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the array. \n\nHmm, but this is hard to track. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach is better: \n\nThe sum C[i] can be written as the sum over all k from 1 to n of B_k[i]. \n\nLet me think of the contribution of A[i] to C[i]. \n\nFor k <i: the contribution is A[i]. \n\nFor k >=i: the contribution depends on the sorted first k elements. \n\nThe total contribution from k <i is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from k >=i is the number of k in [i, n] where the i-th element in the sorted first k elements is 1. \n\nLet me denote this as S. \n\nSo C[i] = (i-1)*A[i] + S. \n\nWe need to choose A[i] (0 or 1) such that this holds. \n\nBut how to compute S. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that S can be expressed in terms of the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nWait, let's think of the first i elements. \n\nSuppose the first i elements have m 1's. \n\nThen, for any k >=i, the first k elements have at least m 1's. \n\nWait, but the first k elements include the first i elements plus others. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. \n\nLet me think of the sample code again. \n\nThe code starts with all 1's. \n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nj = num[i] (C[i])\n\nif j ==0 or ret[i] is 0 (but initially ret[i] is 1, so this is only true if j is 0):\n\nthen j +=i \n\nthen, if j <n, do something. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nSuppose that the current count of 1's in the first i elements is cnt. \n\nThen, the contribution from the sorted arrays for k >=i would be the number of k where the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i). \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to adjust the array so that the current C[i] is satisfied. \n\nSuppose that the current A[i] is 1. \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*1 = i-1. \n\nThe contribution from the second part (sorted arrays) is S. \n\nSo total is (i-1) + S = C[i]. \n\nIf this is not possible, then we need to set A[i] to 0. \n\nBut how to compute S. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a greedy approach where it sets A[i] to 0 if the current C[i] is too small. \n\nWait, let's think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nThe decision must ensure that the current C[i] can be achieved. \n\nSuppose we have already decided the first i-1 elements. \n\nThe contribution to C[i] from the first part (k <i) is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part (k >=i) depends on the sorted arrays. \n\nBut this is hard to track. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nThe sum C[i] must be at least the number of times the element is 1 in the first part (i-1 terms) plus the minimal possible contribution from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal possible contribution from the second part is 0 (if all sorted arrays have 0 in position i). \n\nThe maximum possible contribution is (n -i +1) (if all sorted arrays have 1 in position i). \n\nSo the total must be between (i-1)*A[i] and (i-1)*A[i] + (n -i +1). \n\nBut how to use this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following idea: \n\nThe total contribution from the second part (k >=i) is the number of k in [i, n] where the first k elements have at least (i) 1's. \n\nWait, because the i-th element in the sorted first k elements is 1 if the number of 1's in first k elements is at least (i) (since the first (k - cnt) elements are 0, so the i-th element is 1 if i >= (k - cnt) \u2192 cnt >= (k -i). \n\nWait, the count of 1's in first k elements is cnt. \n\nSo cnt >= (k -i) \u2192 cnt +i >=k \u2192 i + cnt >=k. \n\nHmm, but this is for each k. \n\nAlternatively, for each k >=i, the condition is cnt_k (number of 1's in first k elements) >= (k -i). \n\nThe number of such k is the contribution from the second part. \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the minimal possible contribution from the second part is 0 (if all first k elements have cnt_k < (k-i)), and the maximum is (n -i +1). \n\nBut this doesn't directly help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach is used in the code: \n\nThe code starts with all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i, it checks whether the current C[i] is less than the current contribution. \n\nIf so, it needs to set A[i] to 0. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the initial A is all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i, the contribution from the first part (k <i) is (i-1)*1 = i-1. \n\nThe contribution from the second part (k >=i) would be the number of k where the first k elements (all 1's up to i) have cnt_k (which is k) >= (k -i). \n\nWhich is always true, since k >= (k -i) \u2192 i >=0. \n\nSo the contribution from the second part is (n -i +1). \n\nThus, the total contribution would be (i-1) + (n -i +1) = n. \n\nSo for each i, the initial C[i] would be n. \n\nBut in the sample input, the C array is [2,4,2,4], which for n=4, the initial would be 4 for each position. \n\nBut the sample's C is different. \n\nSo this suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to adjust the array by setting some elements to 0 to reduce the total contribution. \n\nSuppose that for each position i, the current contribution (with A[i] =1) is too high. \n\nThen, setting A[i] to 0 would reduce the contribution from the first part by (i-1), and also affect the second part. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach is used: \n\nThe code is trying to track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet's denote the current count of 1's in the first i elements as cnt. \n\nInitially, cnt starts at 0. \n\nWait, but the code starts with all 1's. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nSuppose that for each i, the current count is cnt. \n\nThen, the contribution from the first part (k <i) is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i). \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the following idea: \n\nThe total contribution to C[i] must be exactly the given value. \n\nThe code starts with all 1's, and then for each position i, it checks whether the current contribution is too high. \n\nIf so, it sets A[i] to 0 and adjusts the count. \n\nBut how to compute the current contribution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the following approach: \n\nThe contribution from the first part (k <i) is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the first k elements have at least (i) 1's. \n\nWait, because the condition is cnt_k >= (k -i). \n\nRearranged, cnt_k +i >=k \u2192 cnt_k >= (k -i). \n\nBut the number of 1's in first k elements is cnt_k. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of 1's in the first i elements and then compute the required contribution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the correct approach for the first problem: \n\nThe key is to realize that the sum C[i] can be written as the number of times the i-th element is 1 in all B_k arrays. \n\nEach B_k array's i-th element is 1 if either: \n\n- k <i and A[i] is 1, or \n\n- k >=i and the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i +1 - (k - cnt_k)), but this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following observation is key: \n\nThe sum C[i] is equal to the number of k in [1, n] where the i-th element in B_k is 1. \n\nThe i-th element in B_k is 1 if: \n\nEither k <i and A[i] is 1, \n\nOR \n\nk >=i and the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i +1 - (k - cnt_k)), but this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the i-th element in B_k is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (number of 0's in first k elements)). \n\nThe number of 0's is (k - cnt_k). \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (i+1 - (k - cnt_k)) \u2192 cnt_k >= (i+1 -k + cnt_k) \u2192 0 >= (i+1 -k) \u2192 k >=i+1. \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. \n\nLet me re-calculate: \n\nThe i-th element in B_k (when k >=i) is part of the first k elements sorted. \n\nThe sorted array has all 0's first, then 1's. \n\nThe position i (0-based) in the first k elements is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the first (k - cnt_k) elements are 0's. \n\nThe remaining cnt_k elements are 1's. \n\nSo the i-th element is 1 if i >= (k - cnt_k). \n\nRearranged, this is cnt_k >= (k -i). \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (k -i). \n\nWhich can be rewritten as cnt_k +i >=k \u2192 i + cnt_k >=k. \n\nSo for each k >=i, the i-th element is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements plus i is at least k. \n\nHmm, but how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, the condition can be rewritten as cnt_k >= (k -i). \n\nSo for each k >=i, the contribution is 1 if the number of 1's in first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nThe total contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where cnt_k >= (k -i). \n\nNow, the total contribution to C[i] is (i-1)*A[i] + the count of such k. \n\nWe need to choose A[i] (0 or 1) such that this equals the given C[i]. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can be used: \n\nWe can process the array from right to left. \n\nLet's track the number of 1's in the suffix. \n\nWait, let's think of the following variables: \n\nLet's denote the current count of 1's in the first i elements as cnt. \n\nWe can process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nThe decision must ensure that the contribution to C[i] is correct. \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where cnt_k (the count of 1's in first k elements) >= (k -i). \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the key insight: \n\nThe contribution from the second part for position i is equal to the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nThis can be rewritten as the number of k where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nLet me denote this as S_i. \n\nThe total contribution to C[i] is (i-1)*A[i] + S_i. \n\nWe need this to equal the given C[i]. \n\nBut how to compute S_i. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can be used: \n\nWe can track the number of 1's in the first i elements as we go. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nThe decision must ensure that the current contribution to C[i] is correct. \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i). \n\nBut this seems hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following observation can be made: \n\nThe contribution from the second part for position i is the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nThis can be rewritten as the number of k where the number of 1's in the first k elements plus i is at least k. \n\nWhich is equivalent to (number of 1's in first k elements) +i >=k \u2192 (number of 1's in first k elements) >= (k -i). \n\nThis is the same as the count of 1's in first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nNow, the count of 1's in first k elements is the sum of A[0] to A[k-1]. \n\nHmm, but this is hard to track. \n\nPerhaps the following approach is used in the code: \n\nThe code starts with all 1's. \n\nThen, for each position i, it checks whether the current contribution (with A[i] =1) is too large. \n\nIf so, it sets A[i] to 0. \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements (with A[i] set to 1) is >= (k -i). \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the following idea: \n\nThe contribution from the second part for position i is (n -i +1) minus the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements is < (k -i). \n\nBut this is still not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the following approach: \n\nThe total contribution to C[i] must be exactly the given value. \n\nThe code starts with all 1's, and then for each position i, it checks whether the current contribution is too high. \n\nIf so, it sets A[i] to 0 and adjusts the count. \n\nBut how to compute the current contribution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the correct approach for the first problem: \n\nThe key is to realize that the sum C[i] can be written as the number of k in [i, n] where the first k elements have at least (k -i) 1's, plus (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nWe can process the array from right to left. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet's track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nAt each step i, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nThe decision must ensure that the contribution to C[i] is correct. \n\nThe contribution from the first part (k <i) is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i). \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the correct approach: \n\nThe contribution from the second part for position i is the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nThis can be rewritten as the number of k where the number of 1's in the first k elements plus i is at least k. \n\nWhich is equivalent to (number of 1's in first k elements) +i >=k \u2192 (number of 1's in first k elements) >= (k -i). \n\nNow, the number of 1's in first k elements is the sum of A[0..k-1]. \n\nBut this is hard to track. \n\nPerhaps the following idea is used: \n\nThe contribution from the second part for position i is the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nThis can be rewritten as the number of k where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i). \n\nLet me denote this as S_i. \n\nThe total contribution to C[i] is (i-1)*A[i] + S_i = C[i]. \n\nWe need to choose A[i] (0 or 1) such that this holds. \n\nBut how to compute S_i. \n\nPerhaps the following approach is used: \n\nWe can track the number of 1's in the first i elements as we go. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nThe decision must ensure that the contribution to C[i] is correct. \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i). \n\nBut this is hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the correct approach for the first problem: \n\nThe key is to realize that the sum C[i] must be equal to the number of times the i-th element is 1 in all B_k arrays. \n\nThe i-th element in B_k is 1 if either: \n\n- k <i and A[i] is 1, or \n\n- k >=i and the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (k - cnt_k)), but this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the i-th element in B_k is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (number of 0's in first k elements)). \n\nThe number of 0's is (k - cnt_k). \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (i+1 - (k - cnt_k)) \u2192 cnt_k >= (i+1 -k + cnt_k) \u2192 0 >= (i+1 -k) \u2192 k >=i+1. \n\nWait, this would mean that the condition is k >=i+1. \n\nBut that can't be right. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. \n\nLet me re-calculate: \n\nThe i-th element in B_k (when k >=i) is part of the first k elements sorted. \n\nThe sorted array has all 0's first, then 1's. \n\nThe i-th element is 1 if the number of 0's in the first k elements is less than i. \n\nThe number of 0's is (k - cnt_k). \n\nSo the condition is (k - cnt_k) <i \u2192 cnt_k > (k -i). \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (k -i +1). \n\nWait, no: \n\nIf the number of 0's is less than i \u2192 (k - cnt_k) <i \u2192 cnt_k > k -i \u2192 cnt_k >= (k -i +1). \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (k -i +1). \n\nHmm, this changes things. \n\nSo the i-th element in B_k is 1 if the number of 1's in first k elements is at least (k -i +1). \n\nSo the contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where cnt_k >= (k -i +1). \n\nThen the total contribution to C[i] is (i-1)*A[i] + the count of such k. \n\nThis must equal the given C[i]. \n\nNow, the problem is to choose A[i] (0 or 1) such that this holds. \n\nBut how to compute the count of such k. \n\nThis seems difficult, but perhaps there's a way to model this with a greedy approach. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can be used: \n\nWe can process the array from right to left. \n\nLet's track the number of 1's in the suffix. \n\nWait, let's think of the following variables: \n\nLet's denote the current count of 1's in the first i elements as cnt. \n\nWe can process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each step i, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nThe decision must ensure that the contribution to C[i] is correct. \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i +1). \n\nBut this is still hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the correct approach: \n\nThe contribution from the second part for position i is the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (k -i +1). \n\nThis can be rewritten as the number of k where the number of 1's in the first k elements plus (i-1) is at least k. \n\nWhich is equivalent to (number of 1's in first k elements) + (i-1) >=k \u2192 (number of 1's in first k elements) >= (k - (i-1)). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the correct approach for the first problem: \n\nThe code in program1.py is using the following approach: \n\nThe initial array is all 1's. \n\nFor each position i from 0 to n-1: \n\nThe current contribution to C[i] is (i-1)*1 (from the first part) plus the number of k in [i, n] where the first k elements (all 1's up to i) have enough 1's. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet's denote the current count of 1's in the first i elements as cnt. \n\nInitially, cnt = i (since all are 1's). \n\nThe contribution from the second part for position i is the number of k in [i, n] where cnt_k (the count of 1's in first k elements) >= (k -i +1). \n\nBut with all 1's, the count of 1's in first k elements is k. \n\nSo the condition is k >= (k -i +1) \u2192 i >=1. \n\nWhich is always true for k >=i. \n\nSo the contribution from the second part is (n -i +1). \n\nThus, the total contribution is (i-1) + (n -i +1) = n. \n\nBut the sample input has C values less than n. \n\nSo this suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using a different approach. \n\nLooking back at the code given for program1.py: \n\nThe code starts with ret = [1]*n. \n\nThen, for each i in range(n): \n\nj = num[i] \n\nif j ==0 or ret[i] ==0: \n\n    j +=i \n\nif j <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nThe code is trying to do something with j. \n\nPerhaps the idea is that the current contribution is too high, so we need to set A[i] to 0. \n\nThe variable j is initialized as the C[i] value. \n\nIf j is 0, then the contribution must be zero. \n\nSince the initial contribution is (i-1)*1 + (n-i+1) = n, which is way larger than zero. \n\nSo in this case, we need to set A[i] to 0. \n\nBut how to adjust the code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nThe variable j is being used to track some value. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of 1's in the first i elements. \n\nFor example, the required number of 1's in the first i elements is such that the contribution to C[i] is correct. \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThe contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the count of 1's in first k elements is >= (k -i +1). \n\nBut this is hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is the correct approach for the first problem: \n\nThe key is to realize that the sum C[i] must be equal to the number of times the i-th element is 1 in all B_k arrays. \n\nThe i-th element in B_k is 1 if either: \n\n- k <i and A[i] is 1, or \n\n- k >=i and the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1 - (number of 0's in first k elements)). \n\nThe number of 0's is (k - cnt_k). \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (i+1 - (k - cnt_k)) \u2192 cnt_k >= (i+1 -k + cnt_k) \u2192 0 >= (i+1 -k) \u2192 k >=i+1. \n\nWait, this would mean that the condition is k >=i+1. \n\nSo the i-th element in B_k is 1 if either: \n\n- k <i and A[i] is 1, or \n\n- k >=i+1. \n\nThis would mean that the contribution from the second part is (n -i). \n\nBecause for k from i+1 to n, the condition is always true. \n\nBut this can't be right because in the sample input, the contribution for position 0 (i=0) would be (0-1)*A[0] (which is -1*A[0], but that's not possible). \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. \n\nLet me re-calculate the condition for the i-th element in B_k when k >=i: \n\nThe i-th element is 1 if the number of 1's in first k elements is at least (i+1 - (number of 0's in first k elements)). \n\nThe number of 0's is (k - cnt_k). \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (i+1 - (k - cnt_k)) \u2192 cnt_k >= (i+1 -k + cnt_k) \u2192 0 >= (i+1 -k) \u2192 k >=i+1. \n\nSo the condition is k >=i+1. \n\nThis means that for k >=i+1, the i-th element is 1. \n\nFor k =i, the condition is whether the number of 1's in first i elements is at least (i+1 - (i - cnt_i)). \n\nWait, for k =i, the number of 0's is (i - cnt_i). \n\nThe condition is cnt_i >= (i+1 - (i - cnt_i)) \u2192 cnt_i >= (1 + cnt_i) \u2192 0 >=1 \u2192 false. \n\nSo for k =i, the i-th element is 0. \n\nThus, the contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i+1, n]. \n\nSo the contribution from the second part is (n -i). \n\nThe contribution from the first part is (i-1)*A[i]. \n\nThus, the total contribution to C[i] is (i-1)*A[i] + (n -i) = C[i]. \n\nThis is a key insight! \n\nThis simplifies everything. \n\nSo the equation is: \n\nC[i] = (i-1)*A[i] + (n -i) \n\nWe can solve for A[i]: \n\nA[i] = (C[i] - (n -i)) / (i-1) \n\nBut since A[i] must be 0 or 1, this must be an integer and either 0 or 1. \n\nWait, but this is only valid when i !=1. \n\nWait, let's re-arrange the equation: \n\nC[i] = (i-1)*A[i] + (n -i) \n\n=> (i-1)*A[i] = C[i] - (n -i) \n\n=> A[i] = (C[i] - (n -i)) / (i-1) \n\nBut this is only valid when i !=1. \n\nFor i=0: \n\nThe equation would be C[0] = (0-1)*A[0] + (n-0) \u2192 C[0] = -A[0] +n \u2192 A[0] = n - C[0]. \n\nBut since A[0] must be 0 or 1, this requires that n - C[0] is 0 or 1. \n\nBut the problem states that a valid array exists, so this must be possible. \n\nFor i=1: \n\nThe equation is C[1] = (1-1)*A[1] + (n-1) \u2192 C[1] = 0 + (n-1) \u2192 C[1] must be n-1. \n\nBut this is not necessarily the case. \n\nWait, this suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this indicates that my earlier analysis is wrong. \n\nWait, let's re-examine the condition. \n\nThe condition for the i-th element in B_k (k >=i) being 1 is that k >=i+1. \n\nThis would mean that for k =i+1, the i-th element is 1. \n\nBut this would mean that the contribution from the second part is (n -i). \n\nBut in the sample input: \n\nSample input C is [2,4,2,4], n=4. \n\nFor i=0: \n\nC[0] = 2. \n\nAccording to the equation: \n\nC[0] = (0-1)*A[0] + (4-0) \u2192 2 = -A[0] +4 \u2192 A[0] = 2 \u2192 which is invalid. \n\nThis suggests that my previous analysis is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so there must be a mistake in the earlier analysis. \n\nLet me re-calculate the condition for the i-th element in B_k when k >=i. \n\nThe i-th element in B_k is part of the first k elements sorted. \n\nThe sorted array has all 0's first, then 1's. \n\nThe i-th element is 1 if the number of 1's in the first k elements is at least (i+1). \n\nBecause the first (k - cnt_k) elements are 0's. \n\nThe i-th element is 1 if the number of 0's is less than i \u2192 (k - cnt_k) <i \u2192 cnt_k >k -i \u2192 cnt_k >=k -i +1. \n\nSo the condition is cnt_k >= (k -i +1). \n\nThus, the contribution from the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where the number of 1's in first k elements is at least (k -i +1). \n\nThis changes things. \n\nSo the equation is: \n\nC[i] = (i-1)*A[i] + (number of k in [i, n] where cnt_k >= (k -i +1)). \n\nThis is more complex. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe number of 1's in the first k elements is cnt_k. \n\nThe condition is cnt_k >= (k -i +1) \u2192 cnt_k +i -1 >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k +i -1) >=k \u2192 (cnt_k
