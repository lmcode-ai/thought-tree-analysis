  "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two problems one by one. Starting with program1.py first.\n\nThe first problem is about determining if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp turns one into R and the other into B. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each application affects exactly two adjacent cells. The key here is to find out the conditions under which the target string is achievable.\n\nHmm, let's think about the constraints. Each stamp application changes two adjacent cells. Since each stamp can be either BR or RB, the order matters but the pair must be adjacent. Also, since the stamp can be applied multiple times, overlapping is allowed. But how do we model the possible transitions?\n\nWait, maybe the key is to look at the sequence of colors and see if there's any impossible pattern. For example, if there's a single R or B not part of a pair? Or maybe the parity of some counts?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that every time you stamp, you're creating a pair of R and B. But since you can stamp over existing cells, maybe the final string must satisfy certain properties. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake the sample input given. The example's final string is BRB BW. The steps show that each stamp application adds a pair. But when overlapping, the colors can change. However, the key might be that any two adjacent cells can't both be the same non-white unless they are part of a pair that can be formed through some sequence of stamps.\n\nWait, perhaps the main observation is that any two adjacent cells must not both be the same non-white color. Because each stamp application on those two would have to set them to different colors. Wait, no, because you can stamp over them again. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled by looking at the transitions between colors. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the final string has a sequence like R B R. How could that be formed? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first stamp is at positions 0-1 (R B), then another at 1-2 (maybe B R?), but that would flip the second and third. Wait, but each stamp must set one to R and the other to B. So each stamp's application must result in exactly one R and one B in those two positions. So overlapping stamps can flip the colors again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every pair of adjacent cells must not both be the same non-white color. Because if they are, then there's no way to have applied a stamp there. Wait, no. Because maybe they were set by a previous stamp and then another stamp over them. Wait, for example, if two adjacent cells are both R, that's impossible because each stamp on them would have set one to R and the other to B. Unless they were set by different stamps in a way that cancels out?\n\nWait, let's think of a simple case. Suppose the target is \"RR\". Can that be achieved?\n\nNo, because to get two R's, you would have to have applied a stamp in some way. Let's see: the only way to get two R's would be if you applied a stamp that set one to R and the other to B, but then another stamp that somehow changes them again. Wait, but each stamp must set exactly one to R and the other to B. So if you first stamp positions 0-1 as RB, then the first is R and second B. Then, if you stamp again on 0-1, you can choose to set them to BR, so first B and second R. But you can't get both R's. So \"RR\" is impossible. So any two adjacent non-white cells must be different. So that's a necessary condition.\n\nWait, but what about a sequence like R B R? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first stamp is positions 0-1 (R B). Then, stamp positions 1-2 as B R (so the second and third become B and R). Wait, but the second position was B from the first stamp, so after the second stamp, it would be B (from the first) turned into R? Or wait, each stamp overwrites both cells. So the first stamp gives positions 0: R, 1: B. Then, stamping positions 1-2 (assuming there's a third cell) as B R would set position 1 to B and 2 to R. Wait, but the first stamp's effect on position 1 is B, then the second stamp on 1-2 would set position 1 to B (if the stamp is BR) or R (if the stamp is RB). Wait, the stamp can be either way. So for the second stamp on positions 1-2, if you choose BR, then position 1 becomes B and 2 becomes R. But that would leave position 1 as B (same as before), so the result would be R B R. So that's possible. So the adjacent pairs here are R-B and B-R, which are okay.\n\nSo the necessary condition is that any two adjacent non-white cells must be different. Because if two adjacent cells are the same non-white, then there's no way to have applied a stamp there. Because any stamp on those two would have set them to different colors. So the only way they can be the same is if they were set by different stamps in a way that cancels out? But that's impossible because each stamp on those two cells would set them to different colors. So if two adjacent cells are both R or both B, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, but what about a cell that's white? Then, it can be part of a stamp with a non-white neighbor. For example, if the target is \"WB\", then you can stamp the first two cells (positions 0 and 1) as RB, but then the first is R and second B. But the target is WB, so that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the target can have W's. The stamp can be applied anywhere, but when you apply a stamp, the two cells under it are set to either RB or BR. So any W in the target must have been left untouched, or overwritten by a stamp. So for example, if a cell is W in the target, that means that no stamp was applied to it in a way that would have changed it. Wait, no. Because a stamp can be applied to it and its neighbor, which would set it to either R or B. So the only way a cell remains W is if no stamp was ever applied to it or its neighbor. Wait, no. Because if a stamp is applied to a pair that includes this cell, then the cell's color is set to either R or B. So the only way a cell is W in the final string is if no stamp was ever applied to it or its adjacent cells. Because any stamp that covers it would have set it to R or B.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So for any cell that is W in the target, it must not have been part of any stamp application. Because any stamp that covers it would have set it to R or B. Therefore, all W's must be isolated in such a way that they are not part of any pair that was stamped. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the W's can only exist in positions where they are not part of any stamped pair. But since the stamps can be applied anywhere, the presence of a W in the target requires that no stamp was applied to that position or its neighbors. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that every non-W cell must be part of at least one stamp application. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the constraints again. Let's consider the following:\n\nThe final string must satisfy that for every pair of adjacent cells, they cannot both be non-white and the same. Because if they are, then there's no way to have applied a stamp there. Because any stamp on those two would have set them to different colors. So the only way they can be the same is if they were set by different stamps in a way that cancels, but that's impossible. So the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W cells must be different.\n\nWait, but what about a sequence like R W B? The W is between R and B. The R and B are not adjacent, so their colors can be different. The W is allowed. But how would that be formed?\n\nHmm, perhaps the W can be part of a stamp with its left or right neighbor. For example, the R could be part of a stamp with the W (but then the W would have been set to B or R, so that's not possible). Wait, so the W must not be part of any stamp. So in the example R W B, the W must not be part of any stamp. So the R must have been set by a stamp to its left (if there is a cell before it), or the B must have been set by a stamp to its right. But the W itself must not be part of any stamp. So the R and B must have been set by stamps that don't include the W.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the W can only exist in positions where they are not part of any stamped pair. So the presence of a W in the target requires that neither it nor its neighbors were part of any stamp. But that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Check that all non-W adjacent pairs are different (i.e., no two same non-W adjacent).\n\n2. Additionally, any W must not be adjacent to a non-W of the same color? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the W's can be anywhere, but whenever there is a non-W, it must be part of a pair that was stamped. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be considered as a sequence where every non-W must be part of at least one stamp. But since stamps can overlap, this is complicated.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to model the problem as follows: each stamp application affects two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. The order of applications doesn't matter because each application overwrites the previous colors. So the final colors are determined by the last stamp applied to each cell, or if no stamp was applied, it remains W.\n\nWait, no. Because each stamp application overwrites both cells. So for example, if a cell is part of multiple stamps, its final color depends on the last stamp applied to it. So the problem is to find a sequence of stamps such that after all applications, the colors match the target.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let's think of the target string and see what conditions must hold.\n\nLet me think of the target string s. For each position i:\n\n- If s[i] is W, then no stamp was applied to either i or i-1 (since applying a stamp to i-1 and i would set s[i] to R or B). Wait, no. If a stamp is applied to positions i-1 and i, then s[i] would be set to either R or B. So for s[i] to be W, there must be no stamp applied to either (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). Because any stamp covering i would set it to R or B. So the only way s[i] is W is if no stamp was applied to either of the pairs (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). Wait, but if a stamp is applied to (i-2, i-1), that doesn't affect i. So the W can exist as long as no stamp covers it.\n\nTherefore, for a cell to be W, it must not be part of any stamp application. So all stamps must be applied in regions that don't include this cell. So the W's must form regions where they are not covered by any stamp.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's think of the problem in terms of the target string's constraints.\n\nFirst, any two adjacent non-W must be different. Because if they are the same, then there's no way to have applied a stamp there. Because any stamp on those two would have set them to different colors. So the only way they can be the same is if no stamp was applied to them. But then they would have to be W, which they are not. So that's impossible. So the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W must be different.\n\nSecond, any W must not be part of any stamp. So the W's must be in positions where they are not covered by any stamp. So the stamps must be applied in regions that don't include any W's. Wait, but the stamps can be applied anywhere except overlapping with W's? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of a W in the target requires that no stamp was applied to that position or its adjacent positions. Because otherwise, the stamp would have set it to R or B. So for a W at position i, the stamps applied must not include (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). So the W must be isolated in such a way that the regions around it are not stamped.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nThe target string must satisfy:\n\n1. All adjacent non-W characters are different.\n\n2. All W's are not part of any stamp application. So the stamps must be applied in regions that don't include any W's. So the non-W regions must form a sequence where each pair is either R/B or B/R, and the W's are in between such regions.\n\nWait, perhaps the W's can be considered as separators between regions of non-W's. Each non-W region must be a sequence of alternating R and B, starting with either R or B, and of even length? Or maybe not necessarily even?\n\nWait, let's think of a non-W region. Since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the non-W regions must be formed by a series of stamps. Each stamp adds a pair of R and B. So the non-W regions must be of even length? Because each stamp contributes two cells. Wait, not exactly, because overlapping stamps can extend regions. For example, a stamp on positions 0-1, then another on 1-2 would form a three-cell region. But the middle cell (position 1) is part of both stamps, so its color depends on the last stamp. Hmm, but the total length can be odd?\n\nWait, let's see an example. Suppose the target is R B R. That's three characters. The first and third are R, the middle is B. How can this be formed?\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1: R B. Then stamp on 1-2 as B R (so the second and third become B and R). The result is R B R. So the length is 3, which is odd. So the non-W regions can be of any length, as long as they can be formed by overlapping stamps.\n\nHmm, so the length doesn't have to be even. So the first condition is that adjacent non-W must alternate between R and B. So the non-W regions must form an alternating sequence of R and B. So the entire non-W regions must be a sequence like R B R B..., or B R B R..., etc. So the non-W regions must be such that they form an alternating pattern.\n\nAdditionally, the W's must be in positions where they are not part of any stamp. So between two non-W regions separated by a W, the regions must be independent.\n\nPutting this all together, the steps to check for a \"YES\" answer are:\n\n- Check that all adjacent non-W characters are alternating (i.e., no two same in a row).\n\n- Also, check that any W is not part of any stamp. Wait, but how do we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, the W's can be anywhere, but whenever there is a W between two non-W regions, those regions must be separated by the W, and the stamps must not have covered the W.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the entire string can be partitioned into segments of non-W's, each of which is an alternating sequence of R and B, and the W's are between these segments. Additionally, each such non-W segment can be formed by some sequence of stamps.\n\nWait, but how do the segments form? Each non-W segment must be an alternating sequence of R and B. So for example, \"RBRB\" is okay, \"RBR\" is okay (length 3), \"B\" is not allowed (since it's a single non-W, which can't be formed by any stamp). Wait, a single non-W is impossible. Because to have a single R or B, you would have to have a stamp that covers it and its neighbor, but then the neighbor would also be set to the opposite color. So a single non-W is impossible. So any non-W segment must have length at least 2? Or can it be of length 1?\n\nWait, let's think: can a single non-W exist?\n\nSuppose the target has a single R in the middle of W's. Like \"WWRW\". The R is at position 2. To have that R, there must be a stamp applied to positions 1-2 or 2-3. But applying a stamp to 1-2 would set position 1 to either R or B and position 2 to the other. So if the target has position 2 as R, then position 1 must be B (if the stamp was BR) or R's neighbor must be B. But then position 1 would be B, so the target would have B at position 1 and R at 2. But the target has W at 1. So that's impossible. So a single non-W is impossible. So all non-W regions must have even length? Or at least length 1 is impossible.\n\nWait, the problem's note says that for the second, third, and fourth test cases, it's not possible to stamp a single cell. So those test cases probably have a single non-W. So the conclusion is that any non-W region must have length at least 2, and the entire non-W regions must form an alternating sequence.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem's first test case has a final string of length 5 (BRBBW). The last character is W, so the non-W part is the first four. Let's see: the first four are B R B B. Wait, that's B followed by R, then B, then B. The third and fourth are both B, which are adjacent non-W and same. That would violate the first condition. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the final string is BRBBW. Wait, the example's explanation says that the final string is B R B B W. Wait, but that has two B's adjacent. That would be invalid according to the first condition. But the problem says that this is a possible example. So my earlier reasoning must be wrong.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Let me re-examine the example given in the problem statement.\n\nThe example's final string is \"BRBBW\". Let's look at the steps:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nStart with WWWW W (assuming n=5?), then after first stamp on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), resulting in W W W R B. Then next stamp on 0-1 (B R?), making B R R B W. Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. The example's explanation says:\n\nThe first step is WWWW \u2192 WW followed by underlined RB (positions 3-4?), then next step adds BR at 0-1, so the first two become BR, then third step stamps positions 1-2 (R B?), leading to B R B B W. Wait, the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2. The previous state was B R R B W. Applying a stamp on 1-2 (positions 1 and 2, which are R and R). The stamp can be either BR or RB. If they choose RB, then position 1 becomes R and 2 becomes B. Wait, but that would turn the two R's into R and B. So the result would be B R B B W. So the third and fourth characters are B and B. So adjacent B's. But according to the problem's example, this is a valid final string. So my earlier conclusion that adjacent non-W's must alternate is wrong.\n\nHmm, so my initial approach is incorrect. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the parity of the number of times each cell is stamped. Each stamp on a pair (i, i+1) toggles both cells between their current state and the new colors. Wait, but each stamp sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So each application overwrites the previous colors. So the final color of each cell depends on the last stamp applied to it. Because any previous stamps are overwritten.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. Because each stamp on a pair (i, i+1) sets both cells to either RB or BR. So the final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. For example, if a cell is part of multiple stamps, only the last one's choice (RB or BR) determines its color.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: can we choose a set of intervals (each of length 2) and for each interval, choose either RB or BR, such that when you apply all these (overwriting each time), the final colors match the target.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, the final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp that covers it. So for each cell, the color must be either R or B (unless it's W, which requires that no stamp covers it).\n\nWait, but W can only be present if no stamp covers the cell. Because any stamp covering it would set it to R or B. So for a cell to be W, it must not be covered by any stamp. So the W's must form regions where no stamp is applied to any of their positions or adjacent positions?\n\nWait, no. For example, if a cell is W, then no stamp can have been applied to it or its left or right neighbor. Because a stamp on (i-1, i) would set cell i to R or B. Similarly, a stamp on (i, i+1) would set cell i to R or B. So for cell i to be W, there must be no stamp applied to (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). So the W's must be in positions where neither of those pairs were stamped.\n\nTherefore, the W's must be isolated in such a way that they are not part of any stamped pair. So the non-W regions must be separated by W's, and each non-W region must be covered by some stamps.\n\nNow, considering the non-W regions. Each non-W region must be covered by some stamps. Each stamp covers two adjacent cells. So the non-W regions can be of any length, but the stamps must form a way to set the colors.\n\nLet me think of the non-W regions. Each such region must be a sequence of R and B where each pair of adjacent cells can be explained by some stamp. But since each stamp can choose between RB or BR, the sequence must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp's pair must be either RB or BR, so adjacent cells in the non-W region must alternate between R and B. Otherwise, there's no way to have a stamp that sets them to that.\n\nWait, that's the key! Because each pair of adjacent cells in the non-W region must be either RB or BR. So the entire non-W region must be an alternating sequence of R and B. So the entire non-W region must be a sequence like R B R B..., or B R B R..., etc. So any two adjacent non-W cells must be different. So the first condition is that all adjacent non-W cells are different. That's necessary.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem statement, the final string is B R B B W. Wait, the third and fourth characters are B and B. So that's two B's adjacent, which are non-W. That would violate the condition. But according to the problem's example, this is a valid case. So there's a contradiction here. So my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, let me recheck the example. The problem's first test case's example is:\n\nThe final string is B R B B W. Wait, the third and fourth are B and B. So adjacent non-W's that are the same. But according to the problem's note, this is a valid case. So my previous conclusion is wrong. So what's wrong with my reasoning?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's final string. Let me recheck the problem's description.\n\nThe problem says: \"one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W\".\n\nWait, the final string is B R B B W. Let's look at the steps:\n\nFirst step: stamp on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), resulting in the last two being R and B. So the string becomes WWWRB W (assuming n=5? The example's final string is length 5). Then the second step is stamping on 0-1 as BR, so the first two become B and R. So the string is BR R B W. Wait, the third character is R (from the first two steps?), then the third step is stamping on positions 1-2 (the second and third characters, which are R and R). The stamp can be either BR or RB. Let's say they choose RB. Then the second becomes R and third becomes B. So the third character becomes B. So the string becomes B R B B W. So the third and fourth are B and B. So adjacent B's. But according to the problem's example, this is allowed. So my previous conclusion that adjacent non-W must alternate is wrong. So what's the correct condition?\n\nHmm, so the problem allows adjacent non-W's to be the same. So my previous approach is incorrect. Need to think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, and each application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The final colors are the result of all these applications, with the last stamp on each cell determining its color. So for each cell, its color is determined by the last stamp that covered it. If no stamp covered it, it remains W.\n\nSo for a cell to be R or B, it must be covered by at least one stamp. The color depends on the last stamp's choice (RB or BR) for that pair.\n\nNow, the key is to find a way to choose the stamps and their orientations such that the final colors match the target.\n\nLet me think of the target string. For each position i:\n\n- If s[i] is W: then no stamp can have covered i. So the pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) must not have been stamped.\n\n- If s[i] is R or B: then it must be covered by at least one stamp. The last stamp covering it must have set it to its current color.\n\nNow, the problem is to find a set of intervals (each of length 2) and for each interval, choose an orientation (RB or BR), such that:\n\n- For every W in the target, the cell is not covered by any interval.\n\n- For every non-W cell, the last interval covering it must have set it to its color.\n\nAdditionally, the intervals can be applied in any order, but overlapping intervals will overwrite previous settings.\n\nHmm, this seems complex. Let's think of the constraints that must be satisfied for the target to be possible.\n\nFirst, for any two adjacent cells i and i+1:\n\nIf both are non-W, then the pair (i, i+1) must have been covered by at least one stamp. Because otherwise, they would remain W. Wait, no. If they are non-W, then they must have been set by some stamp. So the pair (i, i+1) must have been covered by at least one stamp. Because otherwise, they would be W. So for any two adjacent non-W cells, the pair must have been stamped at least once. But the stamp could have been in either direction.\n\nWait, but if the two are non-W, then they must have been set by some stamp. So the pair (i, i+1) must be part of at least one stamp. So the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W cells must have been part of a stamp. But how does that affect their colors?\n\nSuppose the pair (i, i+1) was stamped with RB. Then their colors are R and B. If they were stamped again with BR, then they become B and R. So the final colors depend on the last stamp applied to them.\n\nSo for the pair (i, i+1), the final colors must be either RB or BR, depending on the last stamp. So the pair's colors must be either RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. So the colors of adjacent non-W cells must be different. So that's the first condition.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem's first test case, the final string has B and B adjacent. So that contradicts this. Wait, the example's final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. So adjacent non-W's that are the same. So this would violate the condition. But according to the problem's example, this is a valid case. So there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's final string. Let me recheck the problem's description.\n\nThe problem says: \"one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W\".\n\nWait, the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2 (the second and third characters, which were R and R). The stamp can be either BR or RB. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2, and they choose BR. Then the second becomes B and third becomes R. So the string after third step would be B B R B W. But that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which were R and B). Wait, the second step's result was BR R B W. So the third and fourth are R and B. Then the third step's stamp is on positions 2-3 (third and fourth). Choosing BR would set them to B and R. So the fourth character becomes R. So the string would be B R B R W. But the example's final string is B R B B W. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2 (R and R). Choosing RB would set them to R and B. So the second character remains R, third becomes B. So the string becomes B R B B W. So the third and fourth are B and B. But that would mean the pair (2,3) (third and fourth) are B and B. Which are adjacent non-W and same. So this violates the condition that adjacent non-W must be different. But according to the problem's example, this is allowed. So my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem allows adjacent non-W's to be the same, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the two B's are not adjacent in the final string. Wait no, they are adjacent. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping stamps that can set adjacent cells to the same color. Let me think of the pair (i, i+1) being stamped with RB, then another stamp on (i+1, i+2) with BR. Then the i+1 cell is set to B (from first stamp) then to R (from second stamp). So the final colors would be R (i), B (i+1 from first), then R (i+1 from second?), no. Wait, the second stamp is on (i+1, i+2). The first stamp set i+1 to B. The second stamp can choose BR or RB. If it chooses BR, then i+1 becomes B and i+2 becomes R. So the i+1 would be B again. So the pair (i, i+1) is R and B (from first stamp), then the second stamp doesn't affect i. So the final colors would be R B (from first) and then the second stamp's effect on i+1 and i+2. So the i+1 is B (from first) then set to B again (if the second stamp chooses BR for i+1 and i+2). So the final colors would be R B B R. So the second and third are B and B. So adjacent non-W's can be the same. So my previous condition is wrong.\n\nSo the initial condition that adjacent non-W must alternate is not correct. So what is the correct condition?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the entire string can be partitioned into pairs of adjacent cells, each of which is either RB or BR. But overlapping pairs are allowed. So the final string must be such that every pair of adjacent cells is part of at least one such pair (RB or BR), but overlapping is allowed.\n\nWait, but how does that work? For example, in the case of B B, the pair (i, i+1) must be either RB or BR. But B B is neither. So that would be impossible. But the example in the problem's first test case has such a case. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping stamps such that the final colors can be the same. Let me think of the example's final string B R B B W.\n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B. So the pair (3,4) is BB. But that can't be formed by any single stamp. So how is this possible?\n\nAh! Because the last stamp applied to that pair must have set them to either RB or BR. So the only way for them to be BB is if there were no stamp applied to that pair, but that would mean they are W. But they are B. So this is impossible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding of the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the example's final string is not B R B B W but something else. Let me recheck the problem's description.\n\nThe problem says: \"one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W\".\n\nWait, the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2 (the second and third characters, which were R and R). The stamp can be either BR or RB. Let's say they choose BR. Then the second becomes B and third becomes R. So the string after third step would be B B R B W. But that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which were R and B). Choosing BR would set them to B and R. So the fourth character becomes R. So the string would be B R B R W. But the example's final string is B R B B W. So I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, and the third step's stamp is on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which were R and B). Choosing RB would set them to R and B. So the third becomes R and fourth B. So the string would be B R R B W. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is on positions 0-1 again. Let's see:\n\nAfter the second step, the string is B R R B W. Then applying a stamp on positions 1-2 (R and R) with BR would set them to B and R. So the string becomes B B R B W. The third and fourth are R and B. So the final string would be B B R B W. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. Maybe the third step's stamp is on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which were R and B). Choosing BR would set them to B and R. So the third becomes B and fourth R. So the string is B R B R W. But the example's final string is B R B B W. So I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, and the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2 (R and R) with RB. Then the second becomes R and third B. So the string becomes B R B B W. So the third and fourth are B and B. But how is that possible? The pair (2,3) (third and fourth) must have been stamped with something. The last stamp on them would have to be either RB or BR. But that would set them to R and B or B and R. So the only way they are both B is if there was no stamp applied to them. But then they would be W. So this is impossible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is not B R B B W but B R B B W with the fourth character being W? No, the problem says the final string is B R B B W (length 5). So this is a contradiction. So perhaps the example is correct and my reasoning is wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. I need to think of another way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the parity of the number of times each cell is stamped. Each stamp on a pair (i, i+1) can choose to set them to RB or BR. The final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp applied to it. So for each cell, the final color must be either R or B (unless it's W, which requires no stamps).\n\nLet me consider the entire string and see what conditions must be met.\n\nFor a cell to be W: no stamps cover it. So the pairs (i-1,i) and (i,i+1) must not be stamped.\n\nFor a cell to be R or B: it must be covered by at least one stamp. The last stamp covering it must have set it to its current color.\n\nNow, the key is to find a way to choose the stamps and their orientations such that all these conditions are met.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe entire string can be divided into segments where each segment is a sequence of R and B, and between these segments are W's. Each segment must be formed by a series of stamps.\n\nEach segment must be such that it can be formed by a sequence of stamps. For example, a segment like R B R B can be formed by applying stamps in a way that alternates.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the key is that in any non-W segment, the colors must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp covers two adjacent cells and sets them to either RB or BR. So overlapping stamps can extend the sequence, but the colors must alternate.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose we have a segment of length 3: R B R. This can be formed by first stamping positions 0-1 as RB, then stamping positions 1-2 as BR. The first stamp gives R B, then the second stamp on 1-2 sets them to B R. So the final sequence is R B R. So the colors alternate. So the sequence must alternate between R and B.\n\nSimilarly, a segment of length 4: R B R B can be formed by two stamps: 0-1 (RB) and 2-3 (RB). Or overlapping stamps.\n\nSo the non-W segments must be alternating sequences of R and B. So any two adjacent non-W cells must be different. So the first condition is that all adjacent non-W cells are different. But the example in the problem's first test case contradicts this. So what's wrong?\n\nAh! Wait, in the example's final string B R B B W, the third and fourth characters are B and B. So they are adjacent non-W and same. This would violate the condition. But according to the problem's example, this is allowed. So there must be a mistake in my understanding of the example.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's final string. Let me recheck the problem's description again.\n\nThe problem says: \"one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W\".\n\nWait, the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2 (the second and third characters, which were R and R). The stamp can be either BR or RB. Let's say they choose BR. Then the second becomes B and third becomes R. So the string after third step would be B B R B W. The third and fourth are R and B. So the final string is B B R B W. But the problem's example says the final string is B R B B W. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which were R and B). Choosing BR would set them to B and R. So the fourth becomes R. So the string is B R B R W. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is very confusing. Perhaps the example's final string is different. Maybe it's B R B B W, but the third and fourth are B and B. How is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps the third step's stamp is on positions 0-1 again. Let's see:\n\nAfter the second step, the string is B R R B W. Then applying a stamp on positions 0-1 as BR would set them to B and R. So the first two are B and R. Then the third character is R. So the string is B R R B W. Then applying a stamp on positions 2-3 (R and B) as RB would set them to R and B. So the third and fourth become R and B. So the string is B R R B B W? No, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, and the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2 (R and R) with RB. Then the second becomes R and third B. So the string becomes B R B B W. The third and fourth are B and B. But how did the fourth become B? The fourth was B from the second step. So the third step's stamp on positions 1-2 doesn't affect the fourth. So the fourth remains B. So the third and fourth are B and B. But the pair (2,3) (third and fourth) must have been stamped. The last stamp on them would have to be either RB or BR. But that would set them to R and B or B and R. So the only way they are both B is if there was no stamp applied to them. But then they would be W. So this is impossible. So the example must have a mistake, or my understanding is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping stamps such that the final colors can be the same. For example, if a pair is stamped with RB, then another stamp on the same pair with BR. The final colors would be B and R (from the second stamp). So the first stamp's effect is overwritten.\n\nBut in the example's case, the third and fourth are B and B. So the last stamp applied to them must have set them to B and B, which is impossible. So this suggests that the example's final string is not possible, but the problem says it is. So I must be missing something.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the W's can be anywhere, but the non-W regions must form alternating sequences. So the example's final string must have a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, but the fourth character is W. Then the third is B and fourth is W. That would be allowed. But the problem says the final string is B R B B W.\n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to find another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as follows. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, and each application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The final colors are the result of all these applications, with the last one overwriting previous ones.\n\nThe key is that for any two adjacent cells, their colors must be either RB, BR, or both W. Because if they are non-W, then the last stamp applied to them must have set them to either RB or BR. So the pair must be either RB or BR. So the only allowed pairs are:\n\n- Both W.\n\n- One W and the other non-W: this is allowed only if the non-W is part of a stamp that covers it with its other neighbor.\n\nWait, no. For example, if a cell is W and its neighbor is R, then the R must have been set by a stamp that covers it with its other neighbor. The W cell must not be part of any stamp.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. For any two adjacent cells:\n\n   a. If both are non-W, then they must form either RB or BR.\n\n   b. If one is W and the other is non-W, then the non-W must be part of a stamp that covers it with its other neighbor (not the W).\n\n   c. If both are W, then no stamps cover them.\n\n2. For any non-W cell, it must be covered by at least one stamp.\n\n3. For any W cell, it must not be covered by any stamp.\n\nSo the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W cells must be RB or BR. So the example's final string B R B B W has the third and fourth as B and B, which violates this condition. So the example must be incorrect, but the problem states it is valid. So I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for a single non-W cell. For example, if a cell is R and its neighbor is W, then the R must be part of a stamp with its other neighbor (not the W). But the W must not be part of any stamp. So the R must be part of a stamp with its other neighbor. So the R must have a non-W neighbor on the other side.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern or a way to model this.\n\nAnother idea: the entire string must be such that every non-W cell is part of at least one pair of adjacent non-W cells that form RB or BR. But this is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, the entire string can be viewed as a sequence of alternating R and B, with W's separating them. Each non-W segment must be an alternating sequence of R and B. So the non-W segments must be of even length? Or can be any length as long as they alternate.\n\nWait, the example's first test case's final string has a non-W segment of length 4: B R B B. But this is not alternating. So this contradicts that idea.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nThe final string must satisfy that for every position i (0-based), if s[i] is not W, then there exists at least one stamp that covers it, and the last such stamp's choice (RB or BR) must set it to its current color.\n\nAdditionally, any W must not be covered by any stamp.\n\nNow, the key is to find whether such a set of stamps exists.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nFor any two adjacent non-W cells, they must form either RB or BR. Because the last stamp applied to them must have set them to that. So the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W cells must be different.\n\nThis is the key condition. So the example's final string must have a mistake. But according to the problem's example, it is valid. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth are B and B. So they are adjacent non-W and same. This violates the condition. So the example must be incorrect. But the problem says it is valid. So I'm missing something.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the fourth character is W. Then the third is B and fourth is W. That would be allowed. But the problem's example says the final string is B R B B W. So the fourth is B. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, but the fourth character is W. Then the third is B and fourth is W. That would be allowed. But the problem's description says the final string is B R B B W. So I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the initial condition that adjacent non-W must alternate. So the code would check for that.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Iterate through the string, checking that any two adjacent non-W are different.\n\n- Also, check that any W is not adjacent to a non-W of the same color? Not sure.\n\nWait, no. The W can be adjacent to any non-W, as long as the non-W is part of a stamp with its other neighbor.\n\nWait, the W can be between two non-W segments. For example, R B W B R is allowed. The W is between two alternating segments.\n\nSo the main condition is that all adjacent non-W pairs are alternating.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n and s.\n\n    possible = True\n\n    for i in range(n-1):\n\n        a = s[i]\n\n        b = s[i+1]\n\n        if a != 'W' and b != 'W':\n\n            if a == b:\n\n                possible = False\n\n    # Also, check that any non-W cell is not isolated (i.e., has at least one non-W neighbor?)\n\n    # Wait, no. A single non-W is impossible.\n\n    # Also, check that any non-W cell is part of a pair.\n\n    # For example, if a single non-W exists, it's impossible.\n\n    # So also check that there are no isolated non-W cells.\n\n    # So for each non-W cell, at least one of its neighbors is non-W.\n\n    # So for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    # if s[i] is not W, then either i-1 or i+1 is also non-W.\n\n    # Because otherwise, it's isolated.\n\n    # So:\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if s[i] != 'W':\n\n            if (i ==0 and s[1] == 'W') or (i ==n-1 and s[i-1] == 'W') or (s[i-1] == 'W' and s[i+1] == 'W'):\n\n                possible = False\n\n    if possible:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but this might not cover all cases. For example, a single non-W cell would be caught by the second loop.\n\nBut let's see the example's first test case's final string B R B B W. The third and fourth are B and B. So the first loop would catch that they are the same and set possible to False. But the problem says it's valid. So this approach would incorrectly return NO for the example. So this is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So the initial condition is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the problem allows for adjacent non-W to be the same, but only if they are part of overlapping stamps.\n\nWait, but how can two adjacent non-W be the same? For example, if the pair is stamped with RB, then another stamp on the same pair with BR. The final colors would be B and R. So they are different. So the only way to have two same non-W adjacent is if they are not part of any stamp. But then they would be W. So this is impossible.\n\nSo the example's final string must be invalid, but the problem says it is valid. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nPerhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, but the fourth character is W. Then the third is B and fourth is W. That would be allowed. But the problem's description says it's B R B B W. So I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for a single non-W cell. For example, if the string is \"R\", then it's possible? No, because you can't stamp a single cell. So the answer would be NO.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: the problem can be viewed as follows. Each stamp application can be considered as a choice of a pair and a direction (RB or BR). The final colors are the result of all these choices. The problem is to see if there exists a set of such choices that results in the target string.\n\nThe key is that for each cell, its final color is determined by the last stamp that covers it. So for each cell i:\n\n- If it's W: no stamps cover it.\n\n- Else: it must be covered by at least one stamp, and the last stamp's choice must set it to its current color.\n\nNow, for two adjacent cells i and i+1:\n\n- If both are non-W: the last stamp covering them must have set them to either RB or BR. So their colors must be different.\n\n- If one is W and the other is non-W: the non-W must be covered by a stamp that doesn't include the W. So the non-W must have another neighbor (non-W) to form a pair.\n\n- If both are W: no stamps cover them.\n\nSo the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W must be different.\n\nThe second condition is that any non-W cell must have at least one non-W neighbor. Because otherwise, it would be isolated and cannot be part of any stamp.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck that:\n\n1. All adjacent non-W pairs are different.\n\n2. No non-W cell is isolated (i.e., every non-W cell has at least one non-W neighbor).\n\nIf both conditions are met, then output YES, else NO.\n\nLet's test this with the example's first test case's final string B R B B W.\n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B. So they are adjacent non-W and same \u2192 condition 1 fails \u2192 output NO. But the problem says it's valid. So this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is frustrating. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the problem's note:\n\nThe problem's note says that for the second, third, and fourth test cases, it's not possible to stamp a single cell. So those test cases must have a single non-W cell. So the conditions must include that there are no isolated non-W cells.\n\nSo the second condition is that every non-W cell has at least one non-W neighbor.\n\nThe first condition is that adjacent non-W are different.\n\nSo for the example's first test case's final string B R B B W:\n\nThe third and fourth are B and B \u2192 adjacent non-W and same \u2192 condition 1 fails \u2192 output NO. But the problem says it's valid. So this is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the example's final string is different. Maybe it's B R B R W. Then the third and fourth are B and R \u2192 okay.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the example's final string. Let me recheck the problem's description.\n\nThe problem says: \"one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W\".\n\nThe third step's stamp is on positions 1-2 (R and R). Choosing BR would set them to B and R. So the string becomes B B R B W. The third and fourth are R and B \u2192 okay. So the final string would be B B R B W. But the problem's example says the final string is B R B B W. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example's description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, but the third and fourth are B and B. This would violate the conditions, but the problem says it's valid. So I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows for a non-W cell to be adjacent to a W. For example, the string R W B is allowed. The R and W are adjacent. The R must be part of a stamp with its other neighbor (which is W's other side). But the W cannot be part of any stamp. So the R must be part of a stamp with its other neighbor (the first cell's left neighbor, which doesn't exist). So this is impossible. So the string R W B is invalid.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. I think I need to proceed with the initial conditions and see.\n\nThe code for program1.py would be:\n\nCheck that:\n\n- All adjacent non-W are different.\n\n- No non-W is isolated.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n and s.\n\n    possible = True\n\n    # Check adjacent non-W are different.\n\n    for i in range(n-1):\n\n        a = s[i]\n\n        b = s[i+1]\n\n        if a != 'W' and b != 'W' and a == b:\n\n            possible = False\n\n    # Check no non-W is isolated.\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if s[i] != 'W':\n\n            has_neighbor = False\n\n            if i > 0 and s[i-1] != 'W':\n\n                has_neighbor = True\n\n            if i < n-1 and s[i+1] != 'W':\n\n                has_neighbor = True\n\n            if not has_neighbor:\n\n                possible = False\n\n    print(\"YES\" if possible else \"NO\")\n\nThis should handle the conditions.\n\nNow, let's test this with the example's first test case's final string B R B B W:\n\nThe third and fourth are B and B \u2192 adjacent non-W and same \u2192 first condition fails \u2192 possible is False \u2192 output NO. But the problem says it's valid. So this code would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the example's final string must be different. Perhaps the example's final string is B R B R W. Then the third and fourth are B and R \u2192 okay. Then the code would return YES.\n\nPerhaps the example's final string was mistyped. Assuming that the example is correct, then my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the problem allows for a non-W cell to be adjacent to a W, but the non-W must be part of a stamp with its other neighbor.\n\nFor example, the string R W B is allowed. The R must be part of a stamp with its other neighbor (the first cell's left neighbor doesn't exist). So this is impossible. So the string is invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are:\n\n- All non-W cells form a single contiguous block.\n\n- The block is an alternating sequence of R and B.\n\n- The length of the block is at least 2.\n\n- The W's are only at the ends or between such blocks.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the problem allows for any non-W sequence as long as it can be formed by overlapping stamps. For example, the sequence B B can be formed by first stamping positions 0-1 as BR (B and R), then stamping positions 0-1 again as RB (R and B). The final colors would be R and B. So this doesn't help.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I'll proceed with the initial code and see.\n\nNow, moving to program2.py.\n\nThe second problem is about dividing a binary string into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments where each subsegment has all the same characters, and all subsegments have even length. We need to find the minimum number of changes required to achieve this, and the minimum number of subsegments possible with that minimum changes.\n\nThe input is a binary string, and we can change any character to 0 or 1.\n\nThe output is the minimum changes and the minimum number of subsegments.\n\nThe example given is the first test case where the string is \"1110000000\" (or something like that). The solution changes three characters to get \"1100000000\", which is divided into two subsegments of even lengths.\n\nThe approach for this problem is to model it as follows:\n\nThe string must be divided into even-length subsegments of the same character. To minimize changes, we need to find the optimal way to partition the string into such segments with minimal changes.\n\nThe key is to find the best way to partition the string into even-length blocks of same characters, and compute the minimal changes required.\n\nThe approach is dynamic programming. Let's think of the DP state as dp[i] = (min_changes, min_segments) up to position i.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e5, a O(n) solution is needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can model it by considering the current position and the parity of the current segment length.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track possible states. For each position, we can decide whether to end a segment here or continue.\n\nThe state can be represented by the current segment's length modulo 2, and the current character.\n\nBut this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that each segment must be even-length. So the string must be partitioned into segments of even length, all of the same character.\n\nTo minimize changes, we can try to extend the current segment as much as possible.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track the current segment's length and character. Whenever the current segment's length reaches an even number, we can decide to split here or continue.\n\nBut this might not be optimal.\n\nAnother idea is to consider that each segment must be even-length. So the entire string must be partitioned into even-length segments. The minimal changes would be the sum of the minimal changes for each segment.\n\nTo find the optimal partition, we can use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the minimal changes up to position i, and the number of segments.\n\nThe state can be represented as follows:\n\ndp[i] = (min_changes, min_segments)\n\nFor each position i, we can look back to previous even positions (i-2, i-4, etc.) and see what's the best way to split.\n\nBut this would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nHmm, so we need a linear approach.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe optimal partition can be built by greedily choosing the best possible segment ending at each position.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can track the best possible state when the current segment has length 0 mod 2 or 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can track two possible states for each position:\n\n- The current segment is even-length (so we can end it here if the current character matches the previous).\n\n- The current segment is odd-length.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following:\n\nAt any position i, the current segment must have even length. So whenever the current segment's length reaches even, we can choose to split here.\n\nThe minimal changes up to position i can be computed based on the previous positions.\n\nLet me try to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet's define dp[i] as a tuple (min_changes, min_segments) up to position i.\n\nFor each position i, we can consider the previous positions j where i-j is even, and the substring from j+1 to i is all the same character (or can be made so with minimal changes).\n\nBut this is still O(n^2).\n\nHmm, perhaps we can track for each position the best possible state when the current segment has length even or odd.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nWe can track two variables:\n\n- even: the minimal changes and segments up to position i, where the current segment has even length.\n\n- odd: the minimal changes and segments up to position i, where the current segment has odd length.\n\nAt each step, we can decide to extend the current segment or split.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can track for each position i the best possible state when the current segment has length even or odd.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe can have two arrays:\n\n- dp_even[i]: the minimal changes and segments up to position i, with the current segment having even length.\n\n- dp_odd[i]: the minimal changes and segments up to position i, with the current segment having odd length.\n\nBut this might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can track the current state using variables that track the current segment's length and character.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nWe can track for each position the best possible state when the current segment has even or odd length.\n\nAt each step, for each possible state (even or odd), we can decide to continue the current segment or split.\n\nBut this requires tracking the current character of the segment.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal changes required to make the first i characters into a valid partition can be computed by considering the last possible split point.\n\nFor example, for position i, the last split must be at position i-2k for some k, such that the substring from i-2k+1 to i is all the same character (or can be made so with minimal changes).\n\nThe minimal changes would be the minimal changes up to i-2k plus the changes needed for the current segment.\n\nTo find the optimal k, we can track the best possible option.\n\nBut this requires for each position to look back even steps, which is O(n^2).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, we can track for each position the best possible option when the current segment is of even length.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and for each position i, track the best possible state when the current segment ends at i with even length.\n\nAt each step, we can decide whether to start a new segment here or extend the previous one.\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\nWe can track two variables:\n\n- best_even: the minimal changes and segments up to position i, where the current segment has even length.\n\n- best_odd: the minimal changes and segments up to position i, where the current segment has odd length.\n\nAt each step i:\n\n- If we are at position i, and the current character is the same as the previous segment's character (assuming we are extending the current segment):\n\n   - If the current segment length is even, then we can choose to split here (making it even length) or continue.\n\n   - Or, if the current segment length is odd, then extending it would make it even.\n\nBut this requires knowing the previous character and the current segment's length.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nPerhaps the following approach is better:\n\nWe can track for each position the best possible state when the current segment has even or odd length.\n\nAt each step, for each possible state (even or odd), we can decide to continue the current segment or split.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nWe can have two states:\n\n- State 0: current segment has even length.\n\n- State 1: current segment has odd length.\n\nFor each position i, we can track the minimal changes and segments for each state.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\nFor state 0 (even length):\n\n- We can choose to start a new segment here. The new segment starts at i+1, so the previous segment ends at i. The new segment's length is 0 (so state 1 for the next character).\n\n- Or, we can continue the current segment by adding the current character. But this would require that the current character matches the previous segment's character. If not, we need to change it.\n\nWait, this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the following approach is better:\n\nWe can track for each position the best possible option when the current segment has even or odd length.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\n- dp[i][0] = (min_changes, min_segments) up to position i, with current segment even length.\n\n- dp[i][1] = (min_changes, min_segments) up to position i, with current segment odd length.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\nFor position i:\n\n- To reach state 0 (even length) at i:\n\n   This means that the current segment ended at i with even length. So the previous state could have been state 1 (odd length) at i-1, and we added the current character to make it even. The current character must match the previous segment's character.\n\n   Or, we could have split at i-2, and the current segment is of length 2 (even).\n\n   Hmm, this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the transitions can be:\n\nTo compute dp[i][0], we can consider:\n\n- The previous state was dp[i-1][1], and we added the current character to make the length even. The current character must match the previous segment's character. The changes required would be whether the current character matches the previous character.\n\n   Or, we can split here, but that would require the previous segment to end at i-1 with odd length, and then start a new segment of length 1 (but that would be odd, so not allowed).\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe string must be divided into even-length segments of the same character. To minimize changes, we can greedily choose the best possible partition.\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track the current segment's length and character. Whenever the current segment's length reaches an even number, we can decide to split here or continue.\n\nBut this requires backtracking.\n\nAlternatively, we can use dynamic programming with the following state:\n\ndp[i] = (min_changes, min_segments) up to position i.\n\nFor each position i, we can look back to previous even positions j (i-2, i-4, etc.) and compute the changes needed for the substring j+1 to i to be all the same character.\n\nThe minimal changes would be the minimal between all possible j's plus the previous dp[j] changes.\n\nBut this is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the optimal partition can be made by ensuring that each segment is as long as possible. This way, the number of changes is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal changes can be computed by considering that each segment must be even-length and all characters the same. So for each possible even-length segment ending at position i, we can compute the minimal changes required for that segment and add it to the previous best.\n\nTo do this efficiently, we can track for each position the best possible previous split point.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and for each position i, track the best possible split point j (even distance from i) such that the substring j+1 to i can be made into a single character with minimal changes.\n\nThe minimal changes for the substring j+1 to i is the minimum between the number of 0's or 1's in that substring.\n\nThe total changes would be the previous best up to j plus this minimal changes.\n\nThe minimal segments would be the previous segments plus 1.\n\nTo do this efficiently, we can track for each position the best possible j (even distance) and compute the required changes.\n\nBut how to track this efficiently?\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums for the number of 0's and 1's up to each position.\n\nThen, for each position i, we can look back to i-2, i-4, etc., and compute the changes needed for each possible even-length segment ending at i.\n\nBut this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps we can track for each position the best possible option when the current segment has even length.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nWe can track the current best for even and odd lengths.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- best_even: the minimal changes and segments up to position i where the current segment has even length.\n\n- best_odd: the minimal changes and segments up to position i where the current segment has odd length.\n\nAt each step i:\n\n- For best_even:\n\n   This can be achieved by either:\n\n   a) Extending the previous best_odd by adding the current character. This requires that the current character matches the previous segment's character. The changes needed would be 0 if it matches, or 1 if it doesn't. But this is not straightforward.\n\n   Or:\n\n   b) Starting a new segment here. But this would require the previous segment to end at i-1 with even length, and then starting a new segment of length 1 (which is odd, so not allowed).\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the optimal partition can be formed by ensuring that every even position is a split point or not.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal changes can be computed by considering that each segment must be even-length. So the entire string must be partitioned into even-length segments. The minimal changes is the sum of the minimal changes for each segment.\n\nTo find the minimal changes, we can greedily choose the best possible segment lengths.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and for each position i, track the best possible option up to i.\n\nWe can track two variables:\n\n- prev_even: the minimal changes and segments up to position i where the current segment has even length.\n\n- prev_odd: the minimal changes and segments up to position i where the current segment has odd length.\n\nAt each step i:\n\n- The current character is s[i].\n\n- For the current segment length:\n\n   If the current segment length is even (prev_even):\n\n      We can choose to split here, ending the segment. This would require that the current segment's length is even. The new segment would start at i+1.\n\n      Or, we can continue the segment by adding the current character. This would make the length odd. The changes required would be whether the current character matches the previous segment's character.\n\n   This is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the following approach is better:\n\nWe can track for each position the best possible state when the current segment has even or odd length.\n\nThe state includes the current character of the segment and the number of changes made so far.\n\nBut this would require tracking too many states.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea inspired by the example:\n\nThe minimal changes are achieved by making the string into a sequence of even-length segments of the same character. The minimal changes for a segment of length L is the minimum between the number of 0's or 1's in that segment.\n\nTo minimize the total changes, we want to maximize the length of each segment, as longer segments have lower changes per character.\n\nThus, the optimal partition is to make the longest possible segments.\n\nThis suggests a greedy approach: whenever possible, extend the current segment to the maximum even length possible.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and whenever the current segment's length is even, decide whether to split here or continue.\n\nAlternatively, we can track the current segment's length and character. Whenever the length reaches an even number, we can choose to split or continue.\n\nBut this requires backtracking.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the following approach can work:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and for each position i, track the best possible option up to i.\n\nWe can track two possibilities:\n\n- The current segment has even length.\n\n- The current segment has odd length.\n\nFor each of these, we track the minimal changes and the number of segments.\n\nAt each step, we can decide to continue the current segment or split.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- best_even = (infinity, infinity)\n\n- best_odd = (infinity, infinity)\n\nAt position 0:\n\n- We can start a new segment of length 1 (odd). The changes needed are 0 (if we choose the current character as the segment's character) or 1 (if we change it). But since we can choose the character, the minimal changes is 0 (we can choose to keep it as is).\n\nWait, the changes are the number of changes needed to make the segment all the same character. So for a segment of length 1, the changes are 0 (since it's already one character).\n\nSo for position 0:\n\nbest_odd = (0 changes, 1 segment).\n\nbest_even is still infinity.\n\nAt position 1:\n\nWe can extend the previous segment (which was length 1, odd) to length 2 (even). The changes needed for this segment are the number of changes to make both characters the same. The minimal changes is min(0 (if both are same), 1 (if different)).\n\nSo the new best_even would be best_odd's changes + the changes for this segment.\n\nThe segments count would be best_odd's segments count.\n\nAlternatively, we can split at position 0, making two segments of length 1 each (but they must be even, so this is not allowed).\n\nSo the only option is to extend to even length.\n\nThus:\n\nbest_even[1] = (changes for first two characters, 1 segment).\n\nbest_odd[1] can be updated by starting a new segment of length 1 at position 1. The changes would be 0, and segments count 2.\n\nBut this is worse than the best_even option.\n\nSo the best_even is the better option.\n\nContinuing this way, we can track for each position the best_even and best_odd.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\nFor each position i:\n\ncurrent_char = s[i]\n\nFor best_even[i]:\n\n   This can be achieved by extending the previous best_odd[i-1] by adding current_char. The changes needed for the current segment (which was previously odd length) is the minimal changes to make the first (i) characters the same as the current segment's character.\n\n   Or, we can split at i-1 and start a new segment of length 1 (but that would be odd, so not allowed).\n\n   Alternatively, the best_even can also be achieved by continuing a previous even segment and adding current_char, making it odd.\n\n   This is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps the following approach is better:\n\nWe can track for each position the best possible state when the current segment has even or odd length.\n\nThe state includes:\n\n- The current character of the segment.\n\n- The number of changes made so far.\n\n- The number of segments.\n\nAt each step, we can update these states based on the previous states.\n\nBut this requires tracking multiple states, which may be manageable.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nWe can track two states:\n\n- even: the best state when the current segment has even length.\n\n- odd: the best state when the current segment has odd length.\n\nEach state contains:\n\n- the current character of the segment (0 or 1).\n\n- the minimal changes.\n\n- the minimal segments.\n\nAt each step i:\n\ncurrent_char = s[i]\n\nFor the new even state:\n\nThis can be achieved by extending the previous odd state by one character. The new length is odd + 1 = even.\n\nThe new character must be the same as the previous segment's character. If current_char is different, we need to change it.\n\nThe changes would be previous changes + (current_char != previous_char).\n\nThe segments count remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the previous even state and start a new segment of length 1 (but that would be odd, so not allowed).\n\nSo the new even state is only possible by extending the previous odd state.\n\nFor the new odd state:\n\nThis can be achieved by extending the previous even state by one character. The new length is even + 1 = odd.\n\nThe changes would be previous changes + (current_char != previous_char).\n\nThe segments count remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can start a new segment here. The new segment's length is 1 (odd), so it's not allowed. So this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the new odd state can also be achieved by starting a new segment here, but that would require the previous segment to end at i-1 with even length, and then starting a new segment of length 1 (which is odd, so not allowed).\n\nThus, the new odd state can only be achieved by extending the previous even state.\n\nAdditionally, we can also consider starting a new segment at this position, but that would require the previous segment to end at i-1 with even length, and then starting a new segment of length 1 (which is odd, so not allowed).\n\nThus, the transitions are:\n\nnew_even = previous_odd extended by current_char.\n\nnew_odd = previous_even extended by current_char.\n\nAdditionally, we can also consider splitting the previous even state and starting a new segment of length 1 (but that's not allowed).\n\nHmm, this seems promising.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nInitialize:\n\neven = None (no even segment possible at position -1)\n\nodd = (current_char, 0 changes, 1 segment) at position 0.\n\nWait, at position 0:\n\nThe current segment is length 1 (odd). The changes are 0 (since we can choose to keep it as is).\n\nSo initial state:\n\neven = None\n\nodd = (s[0], 0, 1)\n\nAt position 1:\n\ncurrent_char = s[1]\n\nnew_even can be formed by extending the previous odd state:\n\nThe previous odd state has character c, changes 0, segments 1.\n\nThe new length is 2 (even).\n\nThe new character must be c. If current_char != c, we need to change it.\n\nchanges = previous changes + (current_char != c ? 1 : 0)\n\nsegments = previous segments.\n\nSo new_even is (c, changes, segments).\n\nThe new_odd can be formed by extending the previous even state (which is None), so it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the new_odd can be formed by starting a new segment at position 1, but that would be length 1 (odd), which is not allowed.\n\nThus, the new_odd is not possible.\n\nSo after position 1:\n\neven = (c, changes, 1)\n\nodd = None (since new_odd can't be formed)\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps the following code structure can work:\n\nWe'll track for each state (even or odd) the best possible options.\n\nWe can represent the states as tuples (current_char, changes, segments).\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_even = None\n\nprev_odd = (s[0], 0, 1)\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1:\n\n    current_char = s[i]\n\n    new_even = None\n\n    new_odd = None\n\n    # Try to extend previous odd to even:\n\n    if prev_odd is not None:\n\n        c, changes, seg = prev_odd\n\n        if current_char == c:\n\n            new_even = (c, changes, seg)\n\n        else:\n\n            new_even = (c, changes + 1, seg)\n\n    # Try to extend previous even to odd:\n\n    if prev_even is not None:\n\n        c, changes, seg = prev_even\n\n        if current_char == c:\n\n            new_odd_candidate = (c, changes, seg)\n\n        else:\n\n            new_odd_candidate = (c, changes + 1, seg)\n\n        # Also, can we start a new segment here?\n\n        # To start a new segment, the previous must have been even, and we split here.\n\n        # The new segment would be length 1 (odd), which is not allowed.\n\n        # So no.\n\n        # So new_odd is new_odd_candidate.\n\n        new_odd = new_odd_candidate\n\n    # Also, can we start a new segment here?\n\n    # To start a new segment, the previous must have been even, and we split here.\n\n    # The new segment would be length 1 (odd), which is not allowed.\n\n    # So no.\n\n    # Now, choose the best between new_even and new_odd.\n\n    # But we need to track both possibilities.\n\n    # So the new states are new_even and new_odd.\n\n    prev_even, prev_odd = new_even, new_odd\n\nWait, this is not correct because we need to track all possible options.\n\nAlternatively, for each step, we can compute the new_even and new_odd based on the previous states.\n\nAt each step, the new_even can be formed by extending the previous_odd, and the new_odd can be formed by extending the previous_even.\n\nAdditionally, we can also consider splitting the previous_even and starting a new segment of length 1 (but that's not allowed).\n\nThus, the transitions are as above.\n\nAt the end, the answer is the best between the final even state and the final odd state (but the final segment must be even length).\n\nThus, the final answer must be the even state at position n-1.\n\nIf there is no even state, then it's impossible (but the problem says the string is even length, so it must be possible).\n\nWait, the problem states that n is even, so the entire string must be partitioned into even-length segments.\n\nThus, the final state must be even.\n\nThus, the minimal changes is the changes in the final even state, and the segments count is the segments count.\n\nBut this approach may not track all possibilities.\n\nHmm, this is getting too time-consuming. I'll proceed with the code for program1.py based on the initial conditions and see.\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe code would be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n and s.\n\n    possible = True\n\n    # Check adjacent non-W are different.\n\n    for i in range(n-1):\n\n        a = s[i]\n\n        b = s[i+1]\n\n        if a != 'W' and b != 'W' and a == b:\n\n            possible = False\n\n    # Check no non-W is isolated.\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if s[i] != 'W':\n\n            has_neighbor = False\n\n            if i > 0 and s[i-1] != 'W':\n\n                has_neighbor = True\n\n            if i < n-1 and s[i+1] != 'W':\n\n                has_neighbor = True\n\n            if not has_neighbor:\n\n                possible = False\n\n    print(\"YES\" if possible else \"NO\")\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe code needs to find the minimal changes and segments.\n\nThe code provided in the problem's template has some parts missing. The current code is:\n\nfor s in inp[2::2]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    res = 0\n\n    mseg = 1\n\n    prebit = None\n\n    for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n\n        if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n\n            res += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            if prebit is None:\n\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n            else:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(res, mseg)\n\nThe current code is trying to process the string in pairs of two characters. For each pair, if they are different, no changes are needed (since they can be part of a segment). If they are the same, then a change is needed.\n\nBut this approach is incorrect because the segments can be longer than two characters.\n\nThe correct approach is to find the minimal changes by ensuring that each segment is even-length and all characters are the same.\n\nThe minimal changes for a segment of length L is the minimum between the number of 0's or 1's in that segment.\n\nTo minimize the total changes, we can greedily choose the best possible partition.\n\nThe optimal way is to make each segment as long as possible.\n\nThe code can be implemented using dynamic programming.\n\nThe following approach can be used:\n\nWe can track the minimal changes and segments up to each position.\n\nWe can use a dynamic programming array where dp[i] stores the minimal changes and segments up to position i.\n\nThe transitions are:\n\nFor each position i, we can look back to previous even positions j (i-2, i-4, etc.) and compute the changes needed for the substring j+1 to i.\n\nThe minimal changes would be the minimum between all possible j's plus the previous dp[j].\n\nThe minimal segments would be the previous segments plus 1.\n\nTo do this efficiently, we can track the best option for each possible parity.\n\nHere's the code:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = ... \n\n    s = ... \n\n    prefix0 = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    prefix1 = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        prefix0[i+1] = prefix0[i] + (s[i] == '0')\n\n        prefix1[i+1] = prefix1[i] + (s[i] == '1')\n\n    dp = [ (float('inf'), float('inf')) ]*(n+1)\n\n    dp[0] = (0,0)\n\n    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):\n\n        min_changes = float('inf')\n\n        best_segments = float('inf')\n\n        for j in range(i-2, -1, -2):\n\n            # segment from j to i-1 (length i-j)\n\n            # must be even length.\n\n            # compute changes needed for this segment.\n\n            cnt0 = prefix0[i] - prefix0[j]\n\n            cnt1 = prefix1[i] - prefix1[j]\n\n            changes = min(cnt0, cnt1)\n\n            prev_changes, prev_segments = dp[j]\n\n            total_changes = prev_changes + changes\n\n            total_segments = prev_segments + 1\n\n            if total_changes < min_changes or (total_changes == min_changes and total_segments < best_segments):\n\n                min_changes = total_changes\n\n                best_segments = total_segments\n\n        dp[i] = (min_changes, best_segments)\n\n    print(dp[n][0], dp[n][1])\n\nBut this is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nThus, we need a better approach.\n\nThe optimal solution can be found using a greedy approach with a sliding window.\n\nWe can iterate through the string and track the current window's best option.\n\nThe following approach can work:\n\nInitialize:\n\nmin_changes = 0\n\nsegments = 0\n\ncurrent_char = None\n\ncurrent_length = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if current_length % 2 == 0:\n\n        # start new segment\n\n        current_char = s[i]\n\n        current_length = 1\n\n        segments +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        if s[i] == current_char:\n\n            current_length +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # decide whether to change this character or split\n\n            # option 1: change to current_char: changes +=0, length increases\n\n            # option 2: split here, but the current segment must be even length.\n\n            # current_length is odd, so can't split here.\n\n            # thus, must change.\n\n            current_length +=1\n\n    # compute changes for current segment.\n\n    # but this is not straightforward.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother idea inspired by the problem's note:\n\nThe minimal changes is the number of pairs where the two characters are different divided by 2.\n\nWait, no.\n\nThe example's first test case has the string \"1110000000\" (length 10). The optimal solution changes three characters to get \"1100000000\". The changes are 3.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n11, 10, 00, 00, 00, 00.\n\nThe first pair is 11 (same), so no changes needed. The second pair is 10 (different), so one change needed. The rest are 00.\n\nTotal changes: 1 (for the second pair) plus changes for other pairs.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal changes is the number of positions where the current character differs from the majority in the current segment.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that each segment must be even-length and all characters the same. The minimal changes for a segment of length L is the minimum between the number of 0's or 1's in that segment.\n\nTo minimize the total changes, we should make each segment as long as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal partition is to make the entire string a single segment if possible. If not, split into the longest possible segments.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nIterate through the string and whenever the current segment's length is even, decide whether to split here or continue.\n\nWe can track the current segment's character and length.\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_char = s[0]\n\ncurrent_length = 1\n\nchanges = 0\n\nsegments = 1\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1:\n\n    if s[i] == current_char:\n\n        current_length +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # decide whether to change this character or split.\n\n        # if current_length is even:\n\n        #   we can split here, but the new segment starts with this character.\n\n        #   the current segment's changes are min(0, current_length - 0) ?\n\n        # This is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, whenever the current segment's length is even, we can choose to split here.\n\nThe minimal changes is the sum of the minimal changes for each segment.\n\nThus, the optimal solution is to split the string into segments of even length where each segment has the majority character.\n\nThe minimal changes for each segment is the number of minority characters.\n\nTo find the minimal total changes, we can greedily choose the best possible split points.\n\nThis can be done in O(n) time by tracking the current segment's best option.\n\nHere's the code:\n\nInitialize:\n\nmin_changes = 0\n\nsegments = 0\n\ncurrent_char = None\n\ncurrent_0 = 0\n\ncurrent_1 = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = s[i]\n\n    if current_char is None:\n\n        current_char = c\n\n        current_0 = (c == '0')\n\n        current_1 = (c == '1')\n\n        current_length = 1\n\n    else:\n\n        current_length +=1\n\n        if c == '0':\n\n            current_0 +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            current_1 +=1\n\n    if current_length % 2 == 0:\n\n        # can split here.\n\n        # compute changes for this segment.\n\n        changes_needed = min(current_0, current_1)\n\n        min_changes += changes_needed\n\n        segments +=1\n\n        # reset for next segment.\n\n        current_char = None\n\n        current_0 = 0\n\n        current_1 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        # continue.\n\n        pass\n\nprint(min_changes, segments)\n\nBut this may not be optimal because it splits every even length, which may not be the best.\n\nFor example, if a longer segment has a lower total changes.\n\nThus, this approach may not work.\n\nHmm, I'm out of time. I'll proceed with the initial code for program1.py and the following for program2.py:\n\nThe code for program2.py needs to count the number of pairs where the two characters are different, but this is not correct.
