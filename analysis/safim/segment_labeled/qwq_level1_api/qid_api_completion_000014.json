The task is to check if the word 'Boost' is present in the string. The string is \"Boost Libraries are great!\". The code has a variable 'match' which is set to regex_search(s, expr). So the missing part is defining the regex expr. The regex should look for the exact word 'Boost'.

But to actually connect and get the time, maybe they need to create a socket and perform the read. Wait, but the comment says it's setting up the resolver, so perhaps the next steps are missing? Let me think. The problem might require completing the TCP client part. The code here has the resolver's iterator, but to actually connect, you need to create a socket and connect it.
