The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" after importing the necessary modules. \n\nFirst, I remember that NLTK requires some datasets to be downloaded before they can be used. The code further down uses functions like pos_tag and ne_chunk, which depend on certain resources. For part-of-speech tagging, 'averaged_perceptron_tagger' is needed. For named entity recognition with ne_chunk, you need 'maxent_ne_chunker' and 'words' (the corpus for chunking). Also, the code uses stopwords from NLTK, so 'stopwords' should be downloaded too.\n\nLooking at the existing code, after the TODO comment, they have already included some nltk.download lines: 'averaged_perceptron_tagger', 'maxent_ne_chunker', 'words', and 'stopwords'. Wait a second, those are exactly the ones needed. Wait, but the problem says the code has missing lines that I need to fill in. Hmm, maybe the original code before the TODO didn't have those lines yet? Let me check again.\n\nThe user's code shows:\n\n# Ensure NLTK resources are downloaded\n# TODO: Your code here\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\nnltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')\nnltk.download('words')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n\nWait, so the lines after the TODO are already present. But the problem states that the code has missing lines that I must fill in. Maybe in the original problem, those lines were missing, and the user included them as part of the answer? Wait, perhaps the code provided by the user in the question actually has the TODO and the lines after are the ones to be filled in. Wait, no, looking again, the code as written in the problem includes the TODO and then the four nltk.download lines. That would mean that the code is already correct? But the user says that there are missing lines to be filled in. Maybe there's a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code in the problem had the TODO but none of the four downloads, and the user is supposed to add all four.

Therefore, the code is already correct in that part. But the problem says \"Complete the code in Python\" where the missing lines are the NLTK downloads.
