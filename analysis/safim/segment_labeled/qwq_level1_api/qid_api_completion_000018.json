The comment explains that, so this part is probably okay too.\n\nThen, Boost.DateTime: the current date is retrieved using day_clock::local_day(). That looks correct for getting today's date.

The lambda sleeps for a second, which is correct.\n\nSo the only missing part is the resolver declaration in the Asio section. That's the line I need to provide. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The rest of the code seems to have the necessary components. The Asio client might need to connect and read data, but the comment specifically mentions setting up the resolver and the query.
