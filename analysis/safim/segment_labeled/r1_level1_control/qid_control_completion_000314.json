But wait, since for a substring to be diverse, each character's count can't exceed the number of distinct characters. So the maximum possible length of a diverse substring is when you have k distinct characters, each occurring exactly k times. So for k=1, max length 1. For k=2, each can appear 2 times, total 4.
