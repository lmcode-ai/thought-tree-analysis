So for each same string pair, since they were counted twice (each contributes to two groups), we subtract 2 * C(k,2).

So the total is the sum of pairs differing in first position (same second) plus pairs differing in second position (same first). But each such pair is counted once in each applicable category.\n\nWait, for example, if two strings are \"ab\" and \"ac\", they differ in the second character. So they would be counted in the second part (same first character). So in the 'diff' map, the key would be \"#b\" and \"#c\" for their second characters. Wait, no. Let's see: the code adds \"#b\" for the second character. So for a string \"ab\", the code adds \"a#\" (for the first character part) and \"#b\" (for the second). So when two strings have the same first character, their first part (like \"a#\") would be the same.

Because, for example, two strings that are exactly the same would contribute to both the first and second counts, but such pairs should not be counted at all since they differ in zero positions.\n\nAh, right. Because if two strings are the same, then when considering the first character group, they are counted in the same first character's count. So the code first sums all the C(n,2) for each group in the 'diff' map (which counts both first and second positions). Then, for each group in the 'same' map (exact same string), they subtract twice the C(k,2) for that group. Because each pair in the same string contributes to two groups: the first character group and the second character group. So when the code sums all the pairs from the 'diff' map, those pairs that are in the same string are counted twice (once in first and once in second), but they should contribute zero. So for each same string pair, since they were counted twice (each contributes to two groups), we subtract 2 * C(k,2).\n\nSo the formula is: total_pairs = sum_over_diff_groups (C(cnt, 2)) - 2 * sum_over_same_groups (C(cnt, 2)).\n\nSo the code's logic seems to be correct.\n\nNow, the missing part is the loop that reads the n strings.
