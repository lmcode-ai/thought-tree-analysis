So the code is correct. Wait, but in the code, the loops are for x in num and y in num. So even if x and y are the same string, but they have count >=2, then when x is y, the code would check if they differ in exactly one position. But since they are the same, the condition is false.

But when x is the same as y, the condition would evaluate to (x[0] == x[0] and x[1] != x[1]) which is false, or (x[0] != x[0] and ...) which is also false.

So for example, if two ab's and two cb's are present, each ab (i) in positions 0 and 1 can pair with each cb (j) in positions 2 and 6, as long as i<j.\n\nSo let's compute the actual count for the first sample:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=7. The strings are:\n\n0: ab\n\n1: ab\n\n2: cb\n\n3: db\n\n4: aa\n\n5: cc\n\n6: cb\n\nSo the valid pairs are:\n\nCheck all i<j pairs. Between ab (0 and 1):\n\nj=2: 0-2: ab vs cb \u2192 differ in first character (a vs c). Valid.\n\nj=3: 0-3: ab vs db \u2192 first character differs (a vs d). Valid.\n\nj=4: 0-4: ab vs aa \u2192 second character differs (b vs a). Valid.\n\nj=5: 0-5: ab vs cc \u2192 both differ. Not valid. j=6:0-6: ab vs cb \u2192 first character differs. Valid. j=1: i=0 and j=1: ab vs ab \u2192 same. Not valid. So for i=0, j can be 2,3,4,6 \u2192 4 pairs. For i=1:\n\nj=2: 1-2: ab vs cb \u2192 valid. j=3: 1-3: ab vs db \u2192 valid. j=4: ab vs aa \u2192 valid. j=5: ab vs cc \u2192 no. j=6: ab vs cb \u2192 valid. So 4 pairs here. i=2:\n\nj=3: cb vs db \u2192 second character is b vs b? No. cb is c and b, db is d and b. So first character differs. Valid. j=4: cb vs aa \u2192 both characters differ. No.\n\nj=5: cb vs cc \u2192 second character differs (b vs c). Valid. j=6: cb vs cb \u2192 same. No. So 2 pairs here. i=3:\n\nj=4: db vs aa \u2192 both differ. No.\n\nj=5: db vs cc \u2192 both differ. No. j=6: db vs cb \u2192 i=3 <6: db vs cb \u2192 first character d vs c (differs), second character b vs b. Valid. So i=3 has j=6 \u2192 1 pair. i=4:\n\nj=5: aa vs cc \u2192 both differ. No. j=6: aa vs cb \u2192 both differ. No.\n\ni=5:\n\nj=6: cc vs cb \u2192 second character differs. Valid. So i=5 and j=6: valid. i=6: no j's. So now, let's count all valid pairs:\n\ni=0: 4\n\ni=1:4\n\ni=2:2\n\ni=3:1\n\ni=5:1\n\nTotal: 4+4+2+1+1=12. But the sample explanation says the answer is 5.

But wait, the letters are from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters. So for each character, there are 10 possible other letters. So for example, if the first character is 'a', there are 10 possible variations for the first character: 'b','c',...,'k'. So, to generate all variations:\n\nFor each position (0 and 1):\n\n   original_char = s[pos]\n\n   for char in 'abcdefghijk':\n\n       if char != original_char:\n\n           new_s = s[0] if pos is 1 else char + s[1]\n\n           (depending on the position) Wait, code-wise: For s in the current string:\n\nvariations = set()\n\nfor pos in 0,1:\n\n   original = s[pos]\n\n   for c in 'abcdefghijk':\n\n       if c != original:\n\n           new_str = s[:pos] + c + s[pos+1:]\n\n           variations.add(new_str) Then, for each new_str in variations:\n\n   total += freq.get(new_str, 0)\n\nThis would generate all possible variations. But generating them correctly is important. Yes, this will generate all possible strings that differ from s in exactly one position. Then, for each such string, we check how many times it has been seen before.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to count the pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position. Let's think about the problem.\n\nThe input gives a bunch of two-character strings. For each pair (i,j) where i<j, I need to check if exactly one of the two characters is different between the two strings. So for example, \"ab\" and \"ac\" would count because the second character differs. \"ab\" and \"cb\" would count because the first character differs. But \"ab\" and \"cd\" wouldn't because both characters are different, and \"ab\" vs \"ab\" would have none different, so also not counted.\n\nBut checking every possible pair directly would be O(n^2), which is way too slow for n up to 1e5. So I need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. The key idea here is that for each string s, how many other strings t exist such that s and t differ in exactly one position. Then sum all these counts and divide by 2 (since each pair is counted twice). But even this approach might be tricky because how do I efficiently find all t's that differ by exactly one character from s?\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute all possible variations of each string that differ in exactly one position. For example, for a given string \"ab\", the possible variations are:\n\n- changing first character to any other (so all a' where a' != a, followed by b)\n- changing the second character to any other (so a followed by b' where b' != b)\n\nEach such variation would be a string that differs by exactly one character. Then, for each string s in the Counter, we can look up how many of these variations exist in the Counter and sum their counts. Then, for each s, the number of pairs is count(s) multiplied by the sum of counts of all possible variations. But since each pair (s, t) is counted once for s and once for t, we need to sum all these products and then divide by 2.\n\nWait, but in this approach, for each s, we generate all possible t's that differ by exactly one character. Then for each such t that exists in the Counter, add the product of their frequencies. But how to avoid double counting?\n\nAlternatively, when processing each s, if we generate all possible t's that differ by exactly one character and are lex order greater than s, then we can multiply the counts. But that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, but the problem is to count all ordered pairs (i,j) where i<j. So the order is based on the indices, but since the input may have duplicates, perhaps the approach is to first group the strings by their count. Then, for each pair of different strings that differ by exactly one position, the number of pairs is count[x] * count[y]. For pairs where the two strings are the same (but differing in exactly one position?), but that can't happen because if two strings are same, they differ in zero positions. So, all valid pairs must be between two different strings that differ in exactly one position. Then, the total count is the sum over all x and y (x != y) where x and y differ in exactly one position of count[x] * count[y]. But since (x,y) and (y,x) would both be counted once each in this sum, but in reality we need to count each unordered pair once (since i<j). So the sum would be total pairs, and then divide by 2 (since each unordered pair is considered twice in the sum).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For all strings, count their frequencies using a Counter.\n\n2. For each string x in the Counter, generate all possible strings that differ from x by exactly one character.\n\n3. For each such generated string y, if y is present in the Counter, add count[x] * count[y] to the total.\n\n4. Finally, divide the total by 2 to account for double-counting (since x and y are considered both x to y and y to x in the loop).\n\nBut how do I generate all possible strings that differ by exactly one character from x?\n\nEach x is a two-character string. Let's take x as, say, \"ab\".\n\nFor each position (first and second), we can change the character to any of the other possible letters (from a to k) except the current one.\n\nSo for position 0 (first character), the original is 'a'. So possible variations are 'b'-'k', 10 possibilities. For each of these, the second character remains 'b'. So the strings would be [c + 'b' where c is in 'abcdefghijk' except a].\n\nSimilarly for position 1: 'b' can be changed to any other character except 'b', so 10 possibilities. The first character remains 'a'.\n\nSo for a general string x, the number of possible variations is 10 + 10 = 20 (since each position can be changed to 10 other options).\n\nBut wait, the problem says the strings consist of letters from 'a' to 'k'\u2014that's 11 letters. So each position can be changed to 10 other letters.\n\nSo for each x = c1c2, the possible variations are:\n\nFor the first character: all letters except c1, combined with c2.\n\nFor the second character: all letters except c2, combined with c1.\n\nSo for each x, there are 10 + 10 = 20 possible variations.\n\nBut generating all these variations and checking if they exist in the Counter is manageable. For each x in the Counter, generate all 20 possible y's, check if y is in the Counter, and accumulate the product.\n\nBut since in this approach, each pair (x,y) is considered twice (once when processing x and once when processing y), the total sum would be 2 * the actual desired count, so we divide by 2 at the end. But wait, when x and y are two different strings that differ in exactly one position, then when processing x, we add count[x] * count[y], and when processing y, we add count[y] * count[x], which is the same. So the total sum is 2 * (sum over x < y of count[x] * count[y] * 1 if x and y differ in exactly one position). Then, dividing by 2 gives the correct sum.\n\nYes. So the code can proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize cnt to 0.\n\nFor each x in num (the Counter):\n\n   for each possible variation y that differs in exactly one position from x:\n\n       if y is in num:\n\n           cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\nThen, the final answer is cnt // 2, since each pair was counted twice.\n\nSo the missing code is the condition to check if x and y differ in exactly one position, but in the code as written, the loops are over x and y in num. Wait, in the code provided, the loops are:\n\nfor x in num:\n\n    for y in num:\n\n        if # TODO:\n\n            cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\nSo, the code is considering all possible pairs (x, y) in the Counter. Then, the condition should check if x and y differ in exactly one position.\n\nBut that would result in O(m^2) where m is the number of unique strings. Since m can be up to 121 (since 11*11 possible two-letter combinations), this is manageable. Because 121^2 is 14641 per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nfor each x in num:\n\n   for each y in num:\n\n       if (x and y differ in exactly one position):\n\n           cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\nThen, since in the problem, we are to count pairs (i, j) where i < j, but in the code, when x and y are different and differ in one position, the code counts x and y as well as y and x. So the sum will be twice the actual answer. Hence, after the loops, the code divides cnt by 2.\n\nBut if x == y, then (x and y) differ in zero positions, so the code doesn't add anything. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are for x in num and y in num. So even if x and y are the same string, but they have count >=2, then when x is y, the code would check if they differ in exactly one position. But since they are the same, the condition is false. So for x == y, the code doesn't add anything. So all valid pairs are between different x and y that differ in exactly one position.\n\nSo the missing code is the condition to check if x and y differ in exactly one position.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nFor two two-character strings x and y, they differ in exactly one position if (x[0] == y[0] and x[1] != y[1]) or (x[0] != y[0] and x[1] == y[1]). But since we need exactly one position to differ, this is exactly the case.\n\nSo the condition is: (x[0] == y[0] and x[1] != y[1]) or (x[0] != y[0] and x[1] == y[1])\n\nBut in code, this would be:\n\nif (x[0] == y[0] and x[1] != y[1]) or (x[0] != y[0] and x[1] == y[1]):\n\nBut in Python, when x and y are strings, we can index them as such.\n\nSo the code to insert is:\n\nif (x[0] == y[0] and x[1] != y[1]) or (x[0] != y[0] and x[1] == y[1])\n\nBut wait, in the code provided, the loops are for x in num and then y in num again, so x and y can be the same string. But when x is the same as y, the condition would evaluate to (x[0] == x[0] and x[1] != x[1]) which is false, or (x[0] != x[0] and ...) which is also false. So the code correctly skips x and y when they are the same. Thus, the code will only consider pairs of different strings, but which differ in exactly one position.\n\nTherefore, inserting the condition as above would correctly count all pairs (x, y) where x and y differ in exactly one position, and then dividing by 2 gives the required count (since each unordered pair is considered twice in the sum).\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif (x[0] == y[0] and x[1] != y[1]) or (x[0] != y[0] and x[1] == y[1])\n\nBut also, the code has to check that x and y are different strings, but the condition already implies that. For example, if x and y are same, the condition would be false because in both parts: x[0] == y[0], x[1] == y[1]. So the code will not count x == y.\n\nTherefore, the correct code is the condition as above.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nFirst sample test case:\n\nInput strings: ab, ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cb\n\nSo the Counter would have:\n\nab: 2\n\ncb: 2 (since \"cb\" appears twice?)\n\nWait, the first test case's input is:\n\nn=7\n\nThe strings are:\n\nab\n\nab\n\ncb\n\ndb\n\naa\n\ncc\n\ncb\n\nSo the Counter is:\n\nab:2\n\ncb:2\n\ndb:1\n\naa:1\n\ncc:1\n\nSo the code loops over all x and y in these keys.\n\nFor example, when x is ab and y is cb:\n\nCheck if (a == c? No. Then check if (a != c and b == b). Yes. So they differ in first character. So this pair is counted. The product is 2 * 2 =4. Similarly, when x is cb and y is ab, the same condition is checked. So the code adds 2*2 again. So in the total, these two contributions sum to 8. Then, after dividing by 2, it's 4, which counts each pair (ab, cb) once for each occurrence. But since there are 2 ab's and 2 cb's, the number of pairs is 2*2=4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would correctly count all such pairs.\n\nAnother example: the first sample test case's explanation says there are 5 pairs. Wait, let me check the first sample:\n\nWait the first test case's correct answer is 5. Wait, but according to the code's approach, let's see:\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\nTest case 1:\n\n7\n\nab\n\nab\n\ncb\n\ndb\n\naa\n\ncc\n\ncb\n\nThe valid pairs are:\n\nab and cb (i=0, j=2, etc.)\n\nab and db (i=0, j=3)\n\nab and aa (i=0, j=4)\n\ncb and db (i=2, j=3)\n\ncb and cc (i=2, j=6)\n\nAlso, considering duplicates:\n\nThe two ab's would pair with each of the two cb's. So for ab vs cb, there are 2*2=4 pairs. Similarly, ab vs db is 2*1=2. ab vs aa is 2*1=2. cb vs db is 2*1=2. cb vs cc is 2*1=2. Wait, but according to the sample explanation, the answer is 5. Hmm. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait the sample explanation says for the first test case:\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n(\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\nBut in the input, there are two ab's, two cb's, etc. So how many pairs are there?\n\nEach occurrence of ab pairs with each occurrence of cb (since they are different and differ in exactly one position). So for ab and cb, the number of pairs is 2 (number of ab's) * 2 (number of cb's) =4 pairs. But the sample explanation lists (\"ab\", \"cb\") once. But perhaps the sample explanation is considering the strings as unique based on their values, but the actual problem counts all possible pairs of indices.\n\nWait the problem statement says, \"count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and the i-th and j-th string differ in exactly one position\".\n\nSo for example, if there are two ab's and two cb's, then all pairs between ab and cb would be considered. So for example, the first ab (index 0) pairs with the first cb (index 2), then index 0 with index 3 (the second cb?), wait no. Let me recheck.\n\nThe input for the first test case is:\n\n7\n\nab (index 0)\n\nab (1)\n\ncb (2)\n\ndb (3)\n\naa (4)\n\ncc (5)\n\ncb (6)\n\nSo the strings are:\n\n0: ab\n\n1: ab\n\n2: cb\n\n3: db\n\n4: aa\n\n5: cc\n\n6: cb\n\nSo the valid pairs are:\n\ni=0, j=2: ab vs cb \u2192 yes.\n\ni=0, j=3: ab vs db \u2192 yes.\n\ni=0, j=4: ab vs aa \u2192 yes.\n\ni=0, j=6: ab vs cb \u2192 yes.\n\ni=1, j=2: ab vs cb \u2192 yes.\n\ni=1, j=3: ab vs db \u2192 yes.\n\ni=1, j=4: ab vs aa \u2192 yes.\n\ni=1, j=6: ab vs cb \u2192 yes.\n\ni=2, j=3: cb vs db \u2192 yes.\n\ni=2, j=6: cb vs cb \u2192 no, same string.\n\ni=2, j=4: cb vs aa \u2192 both characters differ \u2192 no.\n\ni=2, j=5: cb vs cc \u2192 second character differs \u2192 yes. (so j=5 is index 5, which is cc. cb and cc differ in second character.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the fifth pair is (\"cb\", \"cc\"). In the input, the sixth string is cc (index 5). The seventh string is cb (index 6). So i=2 (cb) and j=5 (cc) is a valid pair (i<j?), but 2 <5 is yes. So that's a valid pair. Also, index 6 (cb) and 5 (cc) would be i=6 and j=5, which is i>j, so no. So the pair (cb, cc) is counted once (i=2, j=5).\n\nSo the valid pairs are:\n\nLooking for all pairs i<j where s_i and s_j differ in exactly one position.\n\nSo let's list all possible pairs:\n\nBetween ab (0,1) and cb (2,6):\n\n0-2: yes \u2192 1 pair.\n\n0-6: yes \u2192 1.\n\n1-2: yes \u2192 1.\n\n1-6: yes \u21921.\n\nSo for ab and cb, 2*2=4 pairs.\n\nab and db (3): 0-3 (1), 1-3 (1) \u2192 2 pairs.\n\nab and aa (4): 0-4, 1-4 \u2192 2 pairs.\n\nab and cc (5): check if they differ in exactly one position. ab vs cc: first character a vs c (diff), second b vs c (diff). So no. So not counted.\n\ncb (2) and db (3): yes. 2-3 \u21921.\n\ncb (2) and aa (4): no. Both characters differ.\n\ncb (2) and cc (5): yes. Second character b vs c. So 1.\n\ncb (6) and db (3): 6 is after 3, so i=3, j=6 is not allowed. So 3-6: i<j is no. So no.\n\ncb (6) and aa (4): j=4 <i=6: no.\n\ncb (6) and cc (5): i=6, j=5: no.\n\ndb (3) with others: check.\n\ndb and aa (4): differ in both characters? d vs a and b vs a \u2192 yes, both. So no.\n\ndb and cc: same.\n\nSo other pairs:\n\ndb (3) and cc (5): no.\n\naa (4) and others: aa and cc \u2192 differ in both positions. No.\n\nSo total pairs:\n\nab-cb:4 pairs (0-2,0-6,1-2,1-6)\n\nab-db:2 (0-3,1-3)\n\nab-aa:2 (0-4, 1-4)\n\ncb-db:1 (2-3)\n\ncb-cc:1 (2-5)\n\nSo total is 4+2+2+1+1=10. But the sample explanation says the answer is 5. Wait, this is conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! I think I made a mistake. The sample explanation lists the pairs of strings, not the pairs of indices. So even if the same pair of strings appears multiple times, each pair of indices is counted individually. So in the first sample, the answer should be 5 pairs of strings, but each occurring multiple times.\n\nWait no, no. The problem statement says to count the pairs of indices i<j where the i-th and j-th string differ in exactly one position. So for example, if two ab's and two cb's are present, each ab (i) in positions 0 and 1 can pair with each cb (j) in positions 2 and 6, as long as i<j.\n\nSo let's compute the actual count for the first sample:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=7.\n\nThe strings are:\n\n0: ab\n\n1: ab\n\n2: cb\n\n3: db\n\n4: aa\n\n5: cc\n\n6: cb\n\nSo the valid pairs are:\n\nCheck all i<j pairs.\n\nBetween ab (0 and 1):\n\nj=2: 0-2: ab vs cb \u2192 differ in first character (a vs c). Valid.\n\nj=3: 0-3: ab vs db \u2192 first character differs (a vs d). Valid.\n\nj=4: 0-4: ab vs aa \u2192 second character differs (b vs a). Valid.\n\nj=5: 0-5: ab vs cc \u2192 both differ. Not valid.\n\nj=6:0-6: ab vs cb \u2192 first character differs. Valid.\n\nj=1: i=0 and j=1: ab vs ab \u2192 same. Not valid.\n\nSo for i=0, j can be 2,3,4,6 \u2192 4 pairs.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nj=2: 1-2: ab vs cb \u2192 valid.\n\nj=3: 1-3: ab vs db \u2192 valid.\n\nj=4: ab vs aa \u2192 valid.\n\nj=5: ab vs cc \u2192 no.\n\nj=6: ab vs cb \u2192 valid.\n\nSo 4 pairs here.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=3: cb vs db \u2192 second character is b vs b? No. cb is c and b, db is d and b. So first character differs. Valid.\n\nj=4: cb vs aa \u2192 both characters differ. No.\n\nj=5: cb vs cc \u2192 second character differs (b vs c). Valid.\n\nj=6: cb vs cb \u2192 same. No.\n\nSo 2 pairs here.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=4: db vs aa \u2192 both differ. No.\n\nj=5: db vs cc \u2192 both differ. No.\n\nj=6: db vs cb \u2192 i=3 <6: db vs cb \u2192 first character d vs c (differs), second character b vs b. Valid.\n\nSo i=3 has j=6 \u2192 1 pair.\n\ni=4:\n\nj=5: aa vs cc \u2192 both differ. No.\n\nj=6: aa vs cb \u2192 both differ. No.\n\ni=5:\n\nj=6: cc vs cb \u2192 second character differs. Valid.\n\nSo i=5 and j=6: valid.\n\ni=6: no j's.\n\nSo now, let's count all valid pairs:\n\ni=0: 4\n\ni=1:4\n\ni=2:2\n\ni=3:1\n\ni=5:1\n\nTotal: 4+4+2+1+1=12.\n\nBut the sample explanation says the answer is 5. Wait, that can't be. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that for the first test case, the answer is 5 pairs. But according to our calculation, it's 12. There's a clear discrepancy. Which suggests that the code approach we're thinking of is incorrect.\n\nWait this means there's a mistake in the approach. What's the sample's correct answer for the first test case?\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nab\n\nab\n\ncb\n\ndb\n\naa\n\ncc\n\ncb\n\nSample Output 1: 5.\n\nBut according to my manual calculation, there are 12 pairs. So why is the sample output 5?\n\nWait the sample explanation lists the pairs as:\n\n(\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\nBut each of these pairs is counted for each occurrence. So for example, (\"ab\", \"cb\") appears once in the explanation, but in reality, since there are two ab's and two cb's, there are 2 * 2 =4 pairs of indices. So how does the sample explanation count 5 pairs?\n\nAh, the sample explanation is listing the distinct pairs of strings, not the actual index pairs. But the problem requires counting all pairs of indices (i,j) where the strings at i and j differ in exactly one position, regardless of whether the strings are the same as other pairs.\n\nSo this suggests that the code approach of counting all pairs of strings (x,y) and multiplying their frequencies is correct, but then the sample explanation's answer is 5 pairs of strings, but the actual answer is higher.\n\nWait no. Let's recheck the sample input.\n\nWait the sample explanation says the first test case's answer is 5. Let me read the explanation again.\n\n\"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\"\n\nWait these are 5 distinct pairs of strings. But each of these pairs can have multiple index pairs. For example, (\"ab\", \"cb\") is present multiple times because there are two ab's and two cb's.\n\nSo the total number of index pairs is:\n\nFor (\"ab\", \"cb\"): 2 * 2 =4 pairs.\n\nFor (\"ab\", \"db\"): 2 *1=2.\n\nFor (\"ab\", \"aa\"): 2 *1=2.\n\nFor (\"cb\", \"db\"): 2 *1=2 (there are two cb's? Or wait, the Counter for cb is 2, but db is 1. So the pairs between cb and db are 2 *1=2.\n\nWait no, the first test case's input is:\n\nab (count 2)\n\ncb (count 2)\n\ndb (count 1)\n\naa (count 1)\n\ncc (count 1)\n\nSo the pairs:\n\nab and cb: 2*2=4.\n\nab and db: 2*1=2.\n\nab and aa:2*1=2.\n\ncb and db: 2*1=2.\n\ncb and cc: 2*1=2.\n\nTotal pairs would be 4+2+2+2+2=12. But the sample explanation's answer is 5, but the sample output is 5. So this contradicts.\n\nWait no, the sample explanation's answer is 5, but the actual correct answer is 12. So why?\n\nAh, no. There's a misunderstanding. Let's look back at the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\n\"count the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the i-th string and the j-th string have exactly one position p (1 \u2264 p \u2264 2) such that s_i_p != s_j_p.\"\n\nSo for example, the two ab's are at indices 0 and 1. The two cb's are at 2 and 6. So the pairs (0,2), (0,6), (1,2), (1,6) are all between ab and cb. So these four pairs are counted. So that's four pairs.\n\nThe sample explanation lists (\"ab\", \"cb\") as one pair, but in reality, there are four index pairs contributing to this.\n\nBut the sample explanation's answer is 5. So how does this align?\n\nThis indicates that there's a mistake in my understanding. Let's recheck the first sample.\n\nSample input:\n\n7\n\nab\n\nab\n\ncb\n\ndb\n\naa\n\ncc\n\ncb\n\nSo the strings are:\n\n0: ab\n\n1: ab\n\n2: cb\n\n3: db\n\n4: aa\n\n5: cc\n\n6: cb\n\nThe sample explanation says the answer is 5. But according to our manual calculation, the code's approach would give (2 * 2) + (2 *1) + (2*1) + (2*1) + (2*1) =4+2+2+2+2=12. Then divided by 2 gives 6. But that's not matching.\n\nWait no. The code's approach would sum all x and y where x and y are different and differ in exactly one position. For example, for x=ab and y=cb, the code would count 2 * 2 =4. For x=cb and y=ab, the code would count 2*2=4. So the total for this pair is 8, which after dividing by 2 gives 4. Similarly for other pairs.\n\nWait the code's code is:\n\nfor x in num:\n\n    for y in num:\n\n        if condition:\n\n            cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\nSo for x=ab and y=cb, the code adds 2*2=4. For x=cb and y=ab, adds 2*2=4. So the sum is 8 for this pair. Then, when divided by 2, becomes 4.\n\nBut in reality, the number of index pairs between ab and cb is 4. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nSimilarly for other pairs:\n\nab and db: 2*1 *2 (x=ab,y=db and x=db,y=ab) \u2192 (2*1)+(1*2)=4 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 2.\n\nab and aa: 2*1 + 1*2=4 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 2.\n\ncb and db: 2*1 + 1*2=4 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 2.\n\ncb and cc: 2*1 +1*2=4 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 2.\n\nSo total code's answer would be 4 (ab-cb) + 2 (ab-db) + 2 (ab-aa) + 2 (cb-db) + 2 (cb-cc) \u2192 12. Then divided by 2 gives 6. But the sample's answer is 5. So this indicates a mistake in the code approach.\n\nBut the sample's answer is 5. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWhat's wrong here? Let me recheck the sample explanation.\n\nSample explanation:\n\nFor the first test case, the pairs that differ in exactly one position are:\n\n(\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\nEach of these is a pair of distinct strings that differ in exactly one position. So the code's approach would compute for each pair of distinct strings (x,y) where x and y differ in exactly one position, and multiply their counts.\n\nThe code would then sum for all x and y (including y and x) and divide by 2.\n\nSo for the first test case, the pairs are:\n\n1. ab and cb \u2192 count 2 * 2 =4. Summed as x=ab,y=cb and x=cb,y=ab \u2192 4+4=8 \u2192 8/2=4.\n\n2. ab and db \u2192 2 *1 =2. Summed as 2 + 1*2=4 \u21924/2=2.\n\n3. ab and aa \u2192 2 *1=2. Summed as 2+1*2=4 \u21924/2=2.\n\n4. cb and db \u21922 *1=2 \u2192 summed as 2+1*2=4 \u21924/2=2.\n\n5. cb and cc \u21922 *1=2 \u2192 summed as 2+1*2=4 \u21924/2=2.\n\nTotal is 4+2+2+2+2=12 divided by 2 \u21926. But sample's answer is 5.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 5. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait, in the sample input, the pair between cb and cc:\n\nThe code counts it as 2 *1=2 (since there are two cb's and one cc). So the code's code would add 2*1=2 when x is cb and y is cc, and 1*2=2 when x is cc and y is cb. So the sum is 4, divided by 2 gives 2. But according to the actual index pairs, how many pairs are there?\n\nThe cb's are at indices 2 and 6. The cc is at index5.\n\nSo for cb and cc:\n\ni=2 and j=5: valid. i=5 <6 is not, but j=5 is i=2 <5: yes.\n\ni=6 and j=5: no, i<j is false.\n\nSo only one pair (2,5) is valid.\n\nSo the code's approach counts 2 *1=2 (cb and cc) pairs, but in reality, there's only one such pair.\n\nSo why is there this discrepancy?\n\nBecause the code's approach counts all pairs between the two strings, but in reality, not all pairs of x and y (strings) may have i<j.\n\nWait no. The code's approach counts the number of pairs (i,j) where i<j and s_i is x and s_j is y, or s_i is y and s_j is x. For example, x is cb, y is cc.\n\nBut the code's approach would multiply count[x] * count[y], which is 2*1=2. This represents the number of pairs where i is any index of x and j is any index of y where i < j. But wait, if x comes before y in the list, then count[x] * count[y] gives the correct number of pairs. But if some instances of x are after instances of y, then multiplying counts would include pairs where i > j, which are invalid.\n\nAh! This is the mistake in the code's approach.\n\nThe code's approach assumes that for all x and y (different), the number of pairs is count[x] * count[y], which is only true if all instances of x are before all instances of y. But if x and y are the same, but have instances in different orders, the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, for example, if there are two instances of x and two instances of y, but the x's are at indices 0 and 1, and the y's are at indices 2 and 3. Then the number of pairs where x is before y is 2*2=4. But if x's are at indices 2 and 3, and y's at 0 and 1, then the count is 0. So the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo the code's approach of multiplying counts is only valid if x is a different string from y and all instances of x are before all instances of y. But in reality, the order of the strings is arbitrary. So the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo the code's current approach of using Counter to count frequencies and multiply them for pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position is incorrect. Because it counts all possible pairs of x and y, regardless of their positions.\n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. So the initial idea is wrong.\n\nThis explains why in the first sample test case, the code would output 6 (12/2), but the correct answer is 5.\n\nSo how to solve this problem correctly?\n\nThe correct approach is to process all pairs of indices i<j and check if the two strings differ in exactly one position. But for n up to 1e5, this is O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a way to count the pairs efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each string s in the list, we can generate all possible strings that differ from s in exactly one position. Then, for each such string t, check how many times t has appeared before s in the list. Sum all these counts.\n\nThis approach is O(n * 20) = O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Keep a frequency map that tracks the number of times each string has been seen so far.\n\n2. For each string s in the list, in order:\n\n   a. Generate all possible variations of s that differ in exactly one position (20 variations).\n\n   b. For each variation t, look up the current count in the frequency map (which represents the number of times t has been encountered before s).\n\n   c. Add this count to the total.\n\n   d. Then, add s to the frequency map (so that future strings can count s as a previous occurrence).\n\nThis way, for each string s, we look at all possible variations that could form a valid pair with s, and count how many times those variations have been seen before. This ensures that i<j, since s is processed in order and the frequency map only contains previous entries.\n\nFor example, in the first sample test case:\n\nFor each s in the list:\n\nProcess s0 (ab):\n\nGenerate all variations that differ in one position. For example, changing first character to any of a's other letters (10 options) and keeping the second. Or changing the second character (10 options). So 20 variations.\n\nCheck the frequency map (initially empty) for each variation. The count is 0, so no addition.\n\nAdd ab to the frequency map (count ab:1).\n\nProcess s1 (ab):\n\nGenerate variations. For each variation t, check how many times t is in the frequency map (which now has ab:1).\n\nBut the variations are the same as for s0. For example, a variation could be 'cb' (change first character to c). At this point, the frequency map has ab:1. So 'cb' is not in the map. So no counts added.\n\nAdd ab to frequency map (now ab:2).\n\nProcess s2 (cb):\n\nGenerate variations. For example, change first character to a (ab), or other letters. For the variation 'ab', which is in the frequency map (count 2). So add 2 to the total.\n\nSimilarly, other variations may or may not be in the frequency map.\n\nSo for each variation of 'cb', check if it's present.\n\nIn this case, when processing s2 (cb), the variation 'ab' is present and contributes 2.\n\nOther variations may contribute 0.\n\nSo this approach will correctly count all previous occurrences of variations that differ by exactly one position.\n\nThis approach is O(n * 20), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nInitialize a default dict or Counter to track the frequency of strings as we process them.\n\nFor each string in the input list:\n\n   generate all possible variations that differ by exactly one character.\n\n   sum the frequencies of those variations in the current frequency map.\n\n   add this sum to the total.\n\n   increment the frequency of the current string in the frequency map.\n\nThis approach ensures that we count pairs (i,j) where i<j, and j is the current string.\n\nSo how to generate all variations of a string s that differ in exactly one position.\n\nFor s = c1c2:\n\nVariations are:\n\nFor the first character, any of the 10 other possible letters (from 'a'-'k' excluding c1). Each variation is new_c1 + c2.\n\nFor the second character, any of the 10 other possible letters (excluding c2). Each variation is c1 + new_c2.\n\nSo for each s, we can generate 10 +10=20 variations.\n\nBut wait, the letters are from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters. So for each character, there are 10 possible other letters.\n\nSo for example, if the first character is 'a', there are 10 possible variations for the first character: 'b','c',...,'k'.\n\nSo, to generate all variations:\n\nFor each position (0 and 1):\n\n   original_char = s[pos]\n\n   for char in 'abcdefghijk':\n\n       if char != original_char:\n\n           new_s = s[0] if pos is 1 else char + s[1]\n\n           (depending on the position)\n\nWait, code-wise:\n\nFor s in the current string:\n\nvariations = set()\n\nfor pos in 0,1:\n\n   original = s[pos]\n\n   for c in 'abcdefghijk':\n\n       if c != original:\n\n           new_str = s[:pos] + c + s[pos+1:]\n\n           variations.add(new_str)\n\nThen, for each new_str in variations:\n\n   total += freq.get(new_str, 0)\n\nThis would generate all possible variations. But generating them correctly is important.\n\nYes, this will generate all possible strings that differ from s in exactly one position. Then, for each such string, we check how many times it has been seen before.\n\nThis approach will correctly count the number of pairs (i,j) where i<j and s_j is the current s, and s_i is a variation of s_j differing in exactly one position.\n\nThis approach is O(n * 20) operations, which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo the code should be written as follows.\n\nBut in the code provided initially, the code uses a Counter and loops over all pairs of keys. That approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the order of the strings (i<j).\n\nThus, the initial code is incorrect, and the correct approach is to process each string in order, generate variations, and sum frequencies from a Counter that accumulates previous strings.\n\nSo the correct code should be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   read n strings.\n\n   initialize a Counter (like a frequency map) as empty.\n\n   total = 0\n\n   for each string s in the list of strings:\n\n       generate all variations of s that differ in exactly one position.\n\n       sum the frequencies of those variations in the current Counter.\n\n       add this sum to total.\n\n       increment the Counter for s by 1.\n\n   print(total)\n\nSo in Python, the code would look like:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for s in strings:\n\n        variations = set()\n\n        for i in range(2):\n\n            original = s[i]\n\n            for c in 'abcdefghijk':\n\n                if c != original:\n\n                    new_s = s[:i] + c + s[i+1:]\n\n                    variations.add(new_s)\n\n        for var in variations:\n\n            total += freq[var]\n\n        freq[s] +=1\n\n    print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample test case, this code would give:\n\nProcessing each string:\n\ns0: 'ab'\n\nvariations = all possible strings differing by one position.\n\nFor i=0 (first character):\n\noriginal is 'a'. So variations are 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k' followed by 'b' \u2192 10 variations.\n\nFor i=1 (second character):\n\noriginal is 'b'. Variations are 'a', 'c', 'd', ..., 'k' \u2192 10 variations.\n\nSo variations includes 20 strings. None of them are in the freq (which is empty). So no contribution.\n\nAdd 'ab' to freq \u2192 freq['ab'] =1.\n\ns1: 'ab'\n\ngenerate variations (same as before). Check each var in the variations. freq is {'ab':1}. None of the variations are 'ab' because the variations are all differing in exactly one position. So no contribution.\n\nAdd 'ab' \u2192 freq['ab'] =2.\n\ns2: 'cb'\n\ngenerate variations:\n\nFor i=0 (c):\n\npossible characters 'a', 'b', 'd', ..., 'k' \u2192 10 variations, each with first character changed and second 'b'.\n\nFor i=1 (b):\n\npossible characters 'a', 'c', etc. \u2192 10 variations.\n\nSo variations includes 'ab' (change first character from c to a, second is b). So when checking 'ab', freq['ab'] is 2. So this contributes 2 to the total.\n\nOther variations may not be in the freq.\n\nSo total += 2.\n\nAdd 'cb' \u2192 freq['cb'] =1.\n\ns3: 'db'\n\nvariations:\n\nfor i=0 (d), generate all chars except d. So possible first chars a, b, c, e, etc. For each, second is b. So 'ab' is one of them. 'ab' is in freq, count 2.\n\nOther variations may include 'cb' (if changing first character to c), which is in freq (count 1). So for 'cb', count 1.\n\nSo how many variations of 'db' are there?\n\nFor i=0: changing 'd' to any of 10 other letters. For example, 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. So 'ab' (if i=0 is a), 'bb' (i=0 is b), etc.\n\nIn the variations of 'db' (i=0):\n\n- 'ab' is a variation (i=0 changed to 'a')? No, because 'db' is 'd' and 'b'. Changing i=0 to 'a' gives 'ab'. So yes.\n\nSo 'ab' is in variations. So when processing s3 (db), the variation 'ab' is present, which is in freq with count 2.\n\nAlso, for example, 'cb' is another variation (i=0 is 'c').\n\nSo in variations, 'ab' and 'cb' are present.\n\nSo the sum is 2 (from 'ab') + 1 (from 'cb') \u2192 total +=3.\n\nSo after processing s3, the total is 2 (from s2) +3 (from s3) =5.\n\nThen, add 'db' to freq.\n\ns4: 'aa'.\n\ngenerate variations.\n\nFor i=0 (a), change to any other letter \u2192 10 variations. Second character is a.\n\nFor i=1 (a), change to other letters \u2192 10 variations. First character is a.\n\nSo variations include 'ab' (change second character to b), 'ba' (change first character to b), etc.\n\nCheck if 'ab' is in freq (count 2). Also, 'ba' is not in freq.\n\nSo when processing 'aa', the variations include 'ab' (count 2), 'ba' (count 0), etc. So adding 2 to the total.\n\nAfter processing s4, total is 5 +2=7.\n\nAdd 'aa' to freq.\n\ns5: 'cc'.\n\ngenerate variations.\n\nFor i=0 (c), change to other letters. For example, 'a' \u2192 'ac'. 'b' \u2192 'bc', etc.\n\nFor i=1 (c), change to other letters. For example, 'a' \u2192 'ca', 'b' \u2192 'cb', etc.\n\nSo variation 'cb' (change second character to b) is one of them.\n\nCheck if 'cb' is in freq (count 1). So contribution is 1.\n\nOther variations may include 'ac' (not in freq), etc.\n\nSo total +=1 \u2192 total becomes 8.\n\nAdd 'cc' to freq.\n\ns6: 'cb'.\n\ngenerate variations.\n\nFor i=0 (c): change to other letters \u2192 'ab' (a), 'bb' (b), 'db' (d), etc.\n\nFor i=1 (b): change to other letters \u2192 'ca', 'cc', etc.\n\nSo variations include 'ab' (count 2), 'db' (count 1), 'ca' (count 0), 'cc' (count 1), etc.\n\nSum all variations in freq:\n\nFor example, 'ab' is in freq (count 2), 'db' is in freq (count 1), 'cc' is in freq (count 1).\n\nSo sum = 2 (ab) + 1 (db) + ... other variations may contribute.\n\nWait, let's list all variations of 'cb':\n\nChanging first character (c) to any other:\n\na \u2192 'ab'\n\nb \u2192 'bb'\n\nd \u2192 'db'\n\ne \u2192 'eb'\n\nf \u2192 'fb'\n\ng \u2192 'gb'\n\nh \u2192 'hb'\n\ni \u2192 'ib'\n\nj \u2192 'jb'\n\nk \u2192 'kb'.\n\nChanging second character (b) to any other:\n\na \u2192 'ca'\n\nc \u2192 'cc'\n\nd \u2192 'cd'\n\ne \u2192 'ce'\n\nf \u2192 'cf'\n\ng \u2192 'cg'\n\nh \u2192 'ch'\n\ni \u2192 'ci'\n\nj \u2192 'cj'\n\nk \u2192 'ck'.\n\nSo variations are these 20 strings.\n\nNow, check which of these are in freq:\n\nAt the time of processing s6 (cb), the freq is:\n\n'ab':2, 'cb':1, 'db':1, 'aa':1, 'cc':1.\n\nSo variations in the freq:\n\n'ab' \u2192 count 2.\n\n'db' \u2192 count 1.\n\n'cc' \u2192 when changing second character to c, variation is 'cc' (count 1).\n\nSo 'cc' is a variation of 'cb' (s6) \u2192 yes. So 'cc' is in the variations and in freq.\n\nSo sum is 2 (ab) + 1 (db) +1 (cc) \u2192 total +=4.\n\nSo after processing s6, the total is 8 (previous) +4=12.\n\nAdd 'cb' \u2192 freq['cb'] becomes 2.\n\nSo the final total is 12.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 5.\n\nThis indicates that something is wrong.\n\nBut according to the actual index pairs:\n\nThe code's approach would give 12 pairs.\n\nBut the sample's answer is 5.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh, the sample explanation's answer is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nNo. The problem's sample explanation says that for the first test case, there are 5 pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position. But the correct answer according to the problem's statement is the number of index pairs (i<j) where the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\nIn the first test case, according to the code's approach, the answer is 12. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 5. But this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, but the sample output is correct.\n\nWait the sample's first output is 5.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the answer is 12.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the answer would be 12, but according to the problem's sample, the answer is 5.\n\nThis indicates that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, the correct answer is 5, but the code's approach gives 12.\n\nThis implies that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet's recheck the first sample test case.\n\nThe sample input's first test case has 7 strings:\n\nab, ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cb.\n\nThe code's approach (the correct code) processes each string and generates variations, accumulating the frequencies.\n\nLet's track the total step by step.\n\nProcessing each string:\n\ns0: 'ab'\n\nvariations: 20 variations, none in freq (empty). total remains 0.\n\nfreq: ab \u21921.\n\ns1: 'ab'.\n\nvariations: 20 variations. None of them are in freq (which has 'ab':1). So total remains 0.\n\nfreq: ab\u21922.\n\ns2: 'cb'.\n\nvariations:\n\nFor example, 'ab' is a variation (change first character to 'a').\n\nIn freq, 'ab' is present with count 2. So add 2 to total. total=2.\n\nOther variations may not be present.\n\nfreq: cb \u21921.\n\ns3: 'db'.\n\nvariations:\n\nFor example, changing first character to 'a' gives 'ab' (count 2).\n\nChanging first character to 'c' gives 'cb' (count 1).\n\nSo sum is 2 +1=3 \u2192 total becomes 2+3=5.\n\nfreq: db \u21921.\n\ns4: 'aa'.\n\nvariations:\n\nChanging second character to 'b' gives 'ab' (count 2).\n\nChanging first character to 'b' gives 'ba' (not present).\n\nSo sum is 2 \u2192 total=5+2=7.\n\nfreq: aa \u21921.\n\ns5: 'cc'.\n\nvariations:\n\nChanging second character to 'b' gives 'cb' (count 1).\n\nSo sum is 1 \u2192 total=7+1=8.\n\nfreq: cc \u21921.\n\ns6: 'cb'.\n\nvariations:\n\n' ab' (count 2), 'db' (count 1), 'cc' (count 1).\n\nOther variations may include 'kb' (first character k \u2192 not present), 'ca' (second character a \u2192 not present), etc.\n\nSo sum is 2 (ab) +1 (db) +1 (cc) =4 \u2192 total=8+4=12.\n\nfreq: cb \u21922.\n\nSo the code's total is 12. But the sample's answer is 5.\n\nThis is a problem. So why is the sample's answer 5?\n\nThe sample's explanation must have a mistake. Because according to the problem statement, the correct answer is 12.\n\nBut according to the sample's explanation, the answer is 5. But sample explanation counts the pairs of strings, not the pairs of indices.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is the number of index pairs (i,j) with i<j and the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\nSo in the first sample test case, there are 12 such pairs. But the sample explanation's answer is 5. But the sample's output is 5.\n\nThis suggests that the sample's output is 5, but according to the problem's correct code, the output is 12.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Which can't be right.\n\nBut according to the sample input and explanation, the first test case's answer is 5. So there must be a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's explanation is not correct, but the sample's output is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample explanation:\n\nIn the first test case, the valid pairs are:\n\n1. \"ab\", \"cb\" \u2192 indices (0,2), (0,6), (1,2), (1,6) \u21924 pairs.\n\n2. \"ab\", \"db\" \u2192 (0,3), (1,3) \u21922 pairs.\n\n3. \"ab\", \"aa\" \u2192 (0,4), (1,4) \u21922 pairs.\n\n4. \"cb\", \"db\" \u2192 (2,3), (6,3) \u2192 only (2,3) is valid (since 6>3 is invalid). So 1 pair.\n\n5. \"cb\", \"cc\" \u2192 (2,5), (6,5) \u2192 only (2,5) is valid. So 1 pair.\n\nTotal pairs:4+2+2+1+1=10.\n\nSo how?\n\nWait, the sample explanation's answer is 5, but according to the problem's statement, the correct answer should be 10.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the answer is 12.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh no! I think I made a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nIn the code's approach, when generating variations for each string, it's possible that the variations are the same as the original string. For example, if the string is 'ab', and the variation is 'ab' (which is impossible, since we generate variations that differ in exactly one position). But that's not possible, since we loop through all characters except the original.\n\nBut when processing a string s, we generate variations t that differ from s in exactly one position. So t can't be s.\n\nSo when processing s2 (cb), the variation 'ab' is generated. 'ab' is present in the frequency map with count 2. So the code adds 2 to the total. This corresponds to the pairs (0,2) and (1,2) (since the two 'ab's are before 'cb').\n\nSimilarly, when processing s6 (cb), the variation 'ab' is again generated. But the 'ab's are in the frequency map with count 2. So the code adds 2 to the total. This corresponds to the pairs (0,6) and (1,6).\n\nSo in the code's approach, when processing s2 (the first 'cb'), the code adds 2 pairs (ab's before cb at index 2), and when processing s6 (the second 'cb'), the code adds another 2 pairs (ab's before cb at index6). So total of 4 pairs between ab and cb.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the total for ab and cb is 4.\n\nBut according to the code's code, the sum for these pairs is 2 (when processing s2) + 2 (when processing s6) \u2192 total of 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample's explanation, the answer is 5, which is impossible.\n\nSo why is the code's approach generating 12?\n\nLet's recheck the code's approach for each string:\n\nProcessing s0:ab \u2192 total 0.\n\nProcessing s1:ab \u2192 total 0.\n\nProcessing s2:cb \u2192 adds 2 (from 'ab') \u2192 total=2.\n\nProcessing s3:db \u2192 adds 2 (from 'ab') +1 (from 'cb') \u2192 total +=3 \u2192 total=5.\n\nProcessing s4:aa \u2192 adds 2 (from 'ab') \u2192 total=7.\n\nProcessing s5:cc \u2192 adds 1 (from 'cb') \u2192 total=8.\n\nProcessing s6:cb \u2192 adds 2 (from 'ab') +1 (from 'db') +1 (from 'cc') \u2192 total +=4 \u2192 total=12.\n\nSo the code's answer is 12, but according to the problem's sample explanation, it should be 5. But the sample's output is 5. This suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the correct answer is 12, and the sample explanation is incorrect.\n\nBut that's not possible. The problem's sample input must have an output that matches the sample explanation.\n\nSo there's a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nBut why?\n\nAh! Oh! The code's approach is generating variations for each string and adding the count of those variations in the frequency map. But when a variation is generated that differs in exactly one position, but the current string is the same as the variation, the code would add the frequency of the variation, which is the same as the current string's previous count. But that's impossible because the variation is generated to differ in exactly one position. So the variation can't be the same as the current string.\n\nBut there's a mistake in the code's generation of variations.\n\nWait, for example, the string is 'ab'. Generating a variation that changes the first character to 'a' (same as original) and second character to 'a' (different). So that would generate 'aa', which is a valid variation.\n\nBut when generating variations, the code should change exactly one position.\n\nBut the code's code is:\n\nfor i in 0,1:\n\n   original = s[i]\n\n   for c in 'abcdefghijk':\n\n       if c != original:\n\n           new_s = s[:i] + c + s[i+1:]\n\n           variations.add(new_s)\n\nThis is correct. Because for each position, we change the character to any other, thus generating exactly all possible strings that differ in exactly one position.\n\nSo the code's generation of variations is correct.\n\nBut why is the code's answer 12 for the first sample test case, but the sample's expected output is 5?\n\nThis suggests that the sample's explanation is incorrect, and the correct answer is 12. But the sample's explanation says the answer is 5, but according to the code's approach, it's 12.\n\nBut the problem's sample output for the first test case is 5. So this indicates that the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut how?\n\nAh! Wait, the sample explanation's answer is 5. But according to the code's approach, the answer is 12. So there's a contradiction.\n\nBut the sample's explanation's answer is 5, but according to the problem statement, the correct answer should be 12. So this suggests that there is a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that each string is of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'k'. So each character can be any of 11 letters.\n\nThe code's approach is correct in generating variations for each string.\n\nBut the sample's explanation lists 5 pairs of strings, but according to the code's approach, the answer is 12.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is the number of index pairs. So in the first test case, there are 12 such pairs, but the sample's output is 5.\n\nThis is impossible. So there must be a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother possibility: the code's approach counts pairs where the two strings differ in exactly one position, but the problem requires that exactly one position differs. But what if the two strings are the same? They are counted as zero differences. So the code's approach correctly ignores them.\n\nBut in the first sample test case, when processing s6 (cb), the code generates variations. One of the variations is 'cc' (by changing the second character to 'c'). 'cc' is present in the freq with count 1 (from s5). So the code adds 1 to the total. So this corresponds to the pair (5,6): 'cc' and 'cb', which differ in exactly one position. But i=5 <6, so it's valid.\n\nSo the code's approach counts this pair. So according to the code's approach, the answer includes this pair.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the fifth pair is (\"cb\", \"cc\"). This pair is present once (i=2,5). But according to the code's approach, when processing s5 (cc), the code generates variations. What variations?\n\ns5 is 'cc'.\n\nWhen generating variations:\n\nfor i=0 (c), change to any other character. For example, 'a' \u2192 'ac'.\n\nfor i=1 (c), change to any other character. For example, 'b' \u2192 'cb', 'a' \u2192 'ca', etc.\n\nSo when processing s5 (cc), the variations include 'cb' (change second character to 'b'). 'cb' is present in the freq with count 1 (from s2 and s6 is not processed yet). So when processing s5 (cc), the code adds the frequency of 'cb' which is 1 (from s2). So this is the pair (2,5), which is valid.\n\nThen, when processing s6 (cb), the code generates variations including 'cc', which is present with count 1 (from s5). So the code adds 1, which is the pair (5,6), valid.\n\nSo according to the code's approach, the pairs (2,5) and (5,6) are counted, contributing 1+1=2.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, there is only one pair (\"cb\", \"cc\"). Which corresponds to one index pair, but according to the code's approach, there are two.\n\nSo the code's approach is overcounting.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, pairs (i,j) are ordered i<j, and each such pair is counted once.\n\nSo if 'cb' appears at indices 2 and 6, and 'cc' appears at index5, the pairs (2,5) and (6,5) are considered. But (6,5) is invalid because 6>5. So only (2,5) is valid.\n\nSo the code's approach would count 'cc' as a variation of 'cb' when processing s6 (cb), and 'cc' is in the freq with count 1. But s6 is processed after s5, so when processing s6, the frequency map includes s5's 'cc'. So when processing s6, the code checks for 'cc' (a variation of 'cb') and adds the frequency of 'cc' (1), which is s5. So this contributes 1 to the total, corresponding to the pair (5,6) which is i=5<j=6.\n\nYes. So this is a valid pair.\n\nSo the code's approach correctly counts all valid pairs, including (2,5) and (5,6), which are two pairs.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the pair (\"cb\", \"cc\") is counted once.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, there are two such pairs.\n\nSo the sample's explanation is incorrect. The correct answer should be 12.\n\nBut according to the sample's output, it's 5. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut this can't be. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample's explanation says that for the first test case, the answer is 5. But according to the code's approach, it's 12. This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut how?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the problem's sample explanation. The sample explanation lists the pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position, not the number of index pairs. So the sample explanation lists 5 distinct pairs of strings, but the actual answer is the number of index pairs, which is 12.\n\nSo the sample's output must be 12, but according to the sample's input, the output is 5. This is a contradiction. So perhaps the sample's explanation and output are incorrect.\n\nBut this is impossible. So the problem statement must have a mistake, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the answer for the first test case is 12, but the sample's output is 5. So the code must be wrong.\n\nBut why?\n\nAnother possibility: the code's variation generation is incorrect.\n\nWait, the code generates variations by changing one character to any other character. For example, for 'cb', changing the first character to 'a' gives 'ab', which is in the freq.\n\nBut in the first test case, when processing s2 (cb), the code adds 2 (from 'ab's).\n\nWhen processing s6 (cb), the code adds 2 again (from 'ab's). So this is 4 pairs between 'ab' and 'cb' (i=0 and 1, j=2 and 6). Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, these pairs are considered as one pair of strings.\n\nSo the sample's explanation is incorrect. But according to the problem statement, the correct answer is 12.\n\nBut the sample's output is 5.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh! I think I've made a mistake in the code's approach. Because when processing each string, the code is generating all possible variations, including those that may differ in both positions but not the same as the original.\n\nNo. The variations are generated to differ in exactly one position.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample's explanation, the answer is 5, which is the number of distinct string pairs. But the problem requires the number of index pairs.\n\nSo the sample's explanation is incorrect. The code's approach is correct, and the sample's output must be 12.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample input, the first test case's output is 5. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut this can't be. So what's the mistake here?\n\nI must have made a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nLet's think of another approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe problem requires pairs (i,j) with i<j and exactly one position differs between s_i and s_j.\n\nThe code's approach is to count for each j, the number of i<j where s_i is a variation of s_j.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the first test case's answer is 12.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample explanation, the answer is 5.\n\nSo the code's approach must be incorrect.\n\nBut why?\n\nAh! I think I've made a mistake in the code's approach. The code's code is:\n\nfor s in strings:\n\n    generate variations.\n\n    for each variation var in variations:\n\n        total += freq[var]\n\n    freq[s] +=1\n\nBut this code is counting, for each s, the number of previous strings that are variations of s.\n\nBut the problem requires pairs where s_j is the current string, and s_i is a variation of s_j.\n\nBut the code's approach counts the number of previous s_i that are variations of s_j.\n\nBut the correct pairs are those where s_i is a variation of s_j (the current string), or s_j is a variation of s_i.\n\nWait no. The correct pairs are those where s_i and s_j differ in exactly one position. It doesn't matter which is the variation of which.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nFor example, if s_i is 'ab' and s_j is 'cb', then 'cb' is a variation of 'ab' (changing first character). So when processing s_j (cb), the code will generate 'ab' as a variation and count the frequency of 'ab' (which is 2), contributing 2 to the total. But when processing s_i (ab), the code may generate 'cb' as a variation, but at that time, the frequency of 'cb' is 0, so no contribution. So the code's approach correctly counts all pairs where the current string is s_j and s_i is a variation of s_j.\n\nBut this misses pairs where the current string is s_i and s_j is a variation of s_i. Because when processing s_i, we generate variations and count how many times they have been seen before (which may include s_j if it was processed after s_i).\n\nNo. Because s_i is processed before s_j, so when processing s_j, if s_i is a variation of s_j, the code will count it.\n\nFor example, s_i is 'ab' and s_j is 'cb'. When processing s_j (cb), the code generates 'ab' as a variation. The frequency of 'ab' is 2, so the code counts 2. This corresponds to the pairs (0, j) and (1, j).\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the first test case's answer is 12. But the sample's explanation says 5.\n\nThis suggests that the sample's explanation is incorrect, but the problem's sample input's output is 5. So the code's approach must be incorrect.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the answer is 12.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nSo what's the mistake here?\n\nAh! Perhaps I made a mistake in the code's implementation of variations.\n\nWait, in the code's code, the variations are generated as a set. So if a variation is generated multiple times for a single string, it's stored only once.\n\nBut when generating variations for a string, each possible variation is generated exactly once.\n\nFor example, when generating variations for 'ab' by changing the first character to 'c' and leaving the second as 'b', the variation is 'cb'. Changing the second character to 'a' and leaving the first as 'a' gives 'aa'.\n\nSo the code's code is correct in generating all possible variations.\n\nBut perhaps the code's code has a mistake in the way it generates variations.\n\nWait, for a string 'cb', the code generates variations by changing each character to any other letter.\n\nFor example, changing the second character of 'cb' (which is 'b') to 'c' gives 'cc'.\n\nSo variation 'cc' is generated.\n\nWhen processing 'cc' (s5), the code generates variations like 'cb' (changing the second character to 'b').\n\nSo when processing 'cc', the code checks for 'cb' in the frequency map. At that time, 'cb' has a count of 1 (from s2). So the code adds 1 to the total (the pair (2,5)).\n\nWhen processing 'cb' (s6), the code generates 'cc' as a variation, which is in the frequency map (count 1, from s5). So the code adds 1 (pair (5,6)).\n\nSo the code's approach counts both pairs (2,5) and (5,6), which are two valid pairs.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample explanation, there is only one pair (\"cb\", \"cc\"), which corresponds to one index pair.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, there are two index pairs (2,5) and (5,6).\n\nSo the code's approach is correct, and the sample explanation is incorrect.\n\nBut the sample's output is 5. So this is a problem.\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut how?\n\nI'm stuck. I need to find out why the code's approach gives 12 for the first test case but the sample's output is 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample's output is 5 because the code is incorrect.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, and the sample's explanation and output are incorrect.\n\nBut that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: the answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer. So the sample's output is 5.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the answer is 12. So this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the code's approach is incorrect because it's counting pairs (i,j) where i and j are indexes of the same string. But the code's approach allows a string to pair with itself if they are different variations. For example, if a string is 'ab', and there is another 'ab' later, the code's approach doesn't count them because they are the same string. But according to the code's approach, since 'ab' and 'ab' are the same, their variations won't include 'ab' itself. So pairs between 'ab's are not counted.\n\nBut in the first test case, there are two 'ab's. The code's approach does not count any pairs between them.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample's output, the answer is 5, but according to the code's approach, it's 12.\n\nSo there must be a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nBut I'm unable to find it.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the problem's sample explanation and output are incorrect. But this is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, and the sample's output is wrong.\n\nBut that's impossible.\n\nThus, the problem must have a mistake in the sample explanation, but the sample's output is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the sample's output is 12. But the sample's output is 5.\n\nSo there's a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the code's variation generation is wrong.\n\nLet me recheck the variation generation for 'cb' when processed as s2.\n\nWhen s2 is 'cb', the variations are:\n\nFor i=0 (c), generate 'ab', 'bb', 'db', 'eb', 'fb', 'gb', 'hb', 'ib', 'jb', 'kb'.\n\nFor i=1 (b), generate 'ca', 'cc', 'cd', 'ce', 'cf', 'cg', 'ch', 'ci', 'cj', 'ck'.\n\nSo for 'cb', the variations include 'ab', 'db', etc.\n\nWhen processing s2 (cb), 'ab' is in the freq with count 2. So adding 2 to the total.\n\nSo the code's approach counts 2 pairs between 'ab' and 'cb' at this point.\n\nThese pairs are (0,2) and (1,2), which are valid.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample's explanation, there are 5 pairs. But according to the code's approach, the answer is 12.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct, and the sample's explanation and output are wrong.\n\nBut this can't be the case. So there must be a mistake.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem's sample output is correct, but the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut how?\n\nAh! Perhaps the code's approach is counting pairs where the two strings differ in exactly one position, but the problem requires exactly one position to differ. For example, if two strings are the same except for both positions, but in reality, that's impossible. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut why is the sample's output 5?\n\nI think I'm stuck here. The correct code's approach gives 12 for the first sample, but the sample's output is 5. This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. But I can't find why.\n\nPerhaps the code's approach is generating variations that are not possible. For example, the code generates 'ab' as a variation of 'cb', but this requires changing the first character from 'c' to 'a', which is allowed.\n\nBut according to the problem's statement, this is correct.\n\nSo I'm forced to conclude that the code's approach is correct and the sample's explanation and output are incorrect. But this is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the code's variation generation.\n\nFor example, the code uses 'abcdefghijk' which is 11 letters (a to k). But perhaps the code uses a different set of letters.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the strings consist of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'k' \u2192 a total of 11 letters.\n\nThe code uses 'abcdefghijk' \u2192 letters a to k, 11 letters. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nThus, the sample's explanation and output must be wrong. But this is not possible.\n\nThe only way to resolve this is to see the correct code according to the problem's sample output.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample explanation, the answer is 5, but according to the code's approach, it's 12.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut why?\n\nPerhaps the code's approach is counting pairs where the two strings are the same but have different indices. But the code's approach only counts pairs where the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\nBut the code's approach is correct.\n\nI think the mistake is in the problem's sample explanation. The correct answer for the first test case is 12, but the sample's explanation is incorrect. However, the problem's sample output is 5, which suggests that there is a mistake in the problem's statement.\n\nBut this is unlikely.\n\nSo perhaps there is a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nAlternative idea: the code's approach is counting pairs where the two strings differ in exactly one position, but the problem requires that exactly one position is different. The code's approach is correct. But perhaps the problem's sample's output is correct, but the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect because it's generating variations that are not present in the input. For example, in the first test case, when processing 'cb' (s2), the code generates 'ab' as a variation. But 'ab' is present in the input, so the code's approach counts it. This is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 5.\n\nThis is a deadlock.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct approach is to generate variations and count previous occurrences, which is O(n) time. The initial code provided in the problem uses the incorrect approach of looping over all pairs of unique strings, which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the order of the indices.\n\nThe correct code uses the approach of processing each string in order, generating variations, and summing the frequencies of previous occurrences.\n\nThus, the correct code is as follows:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    total = 0\n    for s in strings:\n        # Generate all possible variations of s differing in exactly one position\n        variations = set()\n        for i in range(2):\n            original = s[i]\n            for c in 'abcdefghijk':\n                if c != original:\n                    new_s = s[:i] + c + s[i+1:]\n                    variations.add(new_s)\n        # Add the frequency of each variation\n        for var in variations:\n            total += freq[var]\n        # Update the frequency of the current string\n        freq[s] += 1\n    print(total)\n\nThis code will correctly compute the number of pairs (i,j) where i<j and the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\nBut according to this code, the first test case's answer is 12. But according to the sample's explanation, it's 5. Thus, there's a problem.\n\nBut since the user has provided a code snippet that uses the initial approach (looping over all pairs of unique strings and dividing by 2), which is incorrect, but the problem requires us to complete that code, the missing code is the condition to check if two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\nSo the answer to the user's question is the condition:\n\n(x[0] == y[0] and x[1] != y[1]) or (x[0] != y[0] and x[1] == y[1])\n\nBut this approach is incorrect. However, the user's code skeleton uses this approach, so the missing line is this condition."
