      "text": "Okay, I need to complete the missing condition in the C++ code. Let's see the problem description again. The divisions are based on the rating:\n\nDivision 1: 1900 or higher. Division 2: between 1600 and 1899 inclusive. Division 3: between 1400 and 1599 inclusive. Division 4: 1399 or lower. Looking at the existing code, the first condition checks if x is >=1900, which covers Division 1. Then else if 1600 <=x, which would be Division 2. But wait, wait. Because if x is 1600, that's included in Division 2 (1600 <= x <= 1899). The current condition is 1600 <=x, but since the previous condition already checked for >=1900, this else if would handle x from 1600 to 1899. So that's correct for Division 2. The next else if is for Division 3. So Division 3 is when the rating is between 1400 and 1599, inclusive. So the condition here should be x >= 1400 and x <=1599. So the missing condition is (1400 <= x && x <=1599). So in the code, the line else if(1400<=x && x<=1599) would check that. That's the part that's missing. So that's the TODO part. So replacing the comment with 1400<=x && x<=1599 would make it correct. Let's test with the examples given. For example, the fifth test case is 1400, which should be Division 3. The code checks the first two conditions (no), then the third condition (1400<=1400 and 1400 <=1599 is true), so puts Division 3. Correct. Another example: 1599 would be in Division 3. The third condition would be true. Correct.",
