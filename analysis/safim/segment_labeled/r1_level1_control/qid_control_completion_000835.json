Let's see:\n\nThe line at=[''.join(col).split('o') for col in zip(*a)] is interesting. Oh right, zip(*a) transposes the grid, so columns become rows. For each column (now as a row), they join the characters into a string and split on 'o'. Splitting on 'o' would split the column into segments between obstacles. For example, if a column is \"o*..o*\", splitting on 'o' gives ['', '*..', '*']. Then, for each of these segments, the lambda function f sorts the characters in reverse order. Wait, sorted(s, reverse=True) would sort the characters, so in each segment between obstacles (or the ends), the stones (asterisks) and dots are sorted. Since '*' has a higher ASCII value than '.', sorting in reverse would group all '*'s first, followed by '.'s. So, for a segment like '..*.*', sorting in reverse would give '**...'. Then, each split segment is transformed with f, and then joined back with 'o's between them.",
