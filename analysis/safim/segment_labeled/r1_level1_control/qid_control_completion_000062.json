The code given seems to output something based on a condition. The else part is n + m - 2 + min(n, m). But what's the condition when we output 0? Wait, maybe the initial code is missing handling some edge cases. Wait, the sample input note says in the first test case they used a certain path. Let me think about the possible scenarios. The main idea here is that using portals can save energy. For example, if they can teleport, maybe they can avoid some steps. The total energy is the sum of both their paths. Let's break down the possible scenarios. Let's consider when the grid is 1x1. Then both are already at their destinations, so energy is 0. So the condition for outputting 0 is when either n=1 and m=1, or perhaps when both are 1. So the code has a check here: if (some condition) output 0. So in the code, the missing condition is when either n == 1 or m == 1. Because if the grid is 1 row or 1 column, then the minimal path might be different. Wait, no. Let's think again. Wait, if either n or m is 1, but not both. For example, if n=1 and m=5. Then Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,5). That's 4 steps. Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,5), same path. But how do they use portals here? Because Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So in a 1x5 grid, Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,5). She leaves portals in all cells. So Stanley can teleport. For example, maybe the minimal path is for Megan to just walk her path, and Stanley uses the portals. Wait, let's calculate the sample input. Let's take the code's else part: n + m - 2 + min(n, m). Let's say n=1, m=5. So total would be 1+5-2 + 1 = 5. But what's the actual minimal energy?",
