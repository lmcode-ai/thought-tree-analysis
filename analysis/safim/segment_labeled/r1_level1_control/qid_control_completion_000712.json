Since 1300 is less than 1400, bisect would return 1. Then the calculation is -bisect(...) +5. So for 1300: -1 +5 =4. Which is correct, division 4. Another example: 1400. bisect_right by default (bisect is alias for bisect_right). So for 1400, the insertion point is 2? Wait, no. The list is [-5001,1400,1600,1900].
