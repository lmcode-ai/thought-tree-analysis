So the current code checks for Division 1 first. Then, the else if checks if n is between 1600 and 1899 inclusive for Division 2.

The existing code has the else if for Division 2 as (n <=1899 && 1600 <=n). So for Division 3, it's when the rating is between 1400 and 1599 inclusive. So the condition should be that n is >=1400 and <=1599. But how to write that. Wait, the code uses else if after checking Division 1 and 2. So after checking 1900<=n (Division 1), then else if checks if it's in 1600-1899. Then the next else if would handle Division 3, which is 1400-1599. Then the else is Division 4. So the missing condition is checking if n is between 1400 and 1599 inclusive. So the condition should be n >=1400 && n <=1599. Looking at the current code:\n\nelse if(n <= 1899 && 1600 <= n) \u2192 that's for Division 2. So the next else if is for Division 3. So the correct condition is:\n\nelse if (n >= 1400 && n <= 1599) Yes. That's the missing part. So replacing the /* TODO: ... */ with that condition.",
