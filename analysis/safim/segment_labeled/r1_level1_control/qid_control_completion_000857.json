For example, consider the startsWithCounter. The idea is that for each first character, the number of pairs where the first character is the same but the second differs. Wait, no. Maybe the calculatePairs function is handling the case where two strings have the same first character but different second characters. Because for each pair, if the first characters are the same, then the second must differ. So for all strings with the same first character, the number of pairs that differ in the second character is the total pairs possible among those strings minus the pairs that have the same second character. Wait, but the code in calculatePairs seems to be doing a different approach.\n\nLooking at calculatePairs: for each i (which represents the first character, perhaps), sum starts as counter[i], which is the total number of strings that have this first character.

So this is summing over all possible j for each i, the number of pairs where one string has i and j, and the other has i but not j. So this would give all pairs where the first character is the same, but the second differs. Because each such pair contributes once. So this function calculates the total pairs where the first character is the same, but the second is different. Similarly, the other calculatePairs call for endsWithCounter and endToStart would calculate pairs where the second character is the same, but the first is different. Then adding those two gives the total pairs that differ in exactly one position.\n\nSo the approach is correct. The code's structure is correct as long as the loops are filled in properly.\n\nSo the missing part is the loop condition in the while loop where the code reads the n strings.
