These expressions come from the maximum of (j + (a_j - m)) and ( (a_j - m) - j ), perhaps? Because when you have a_j - m = y, then for any j, the required contribution is at least y. The contribution of the i-th rain is p_i - |x_i - j|. So, p_i - |x_i - j| >= y. Rearranged, p_i > = |x_i - j| + y. But to have this hold for all j where a_j > m, we can model this as the maximum (y + j - x_i) and (y - (j - x_i)) for all j. Wait, maybe another approach: for each j where a_j > m, the required p_i must be >= (y + |x_i - j|). So, p_i must be >= max over j (y + |x_i - j|), where y is a_j - m. But this is computationally expensive. So, the code precomputes the maximum values of (j + y) and (y - j) for all j where a_j > m. Then, for each i-th rain (x_i, p_i), the condition is whether p_i > = (okX - x_i) and p_i >= (x_i + okY). Because:\n\nmax over j (y + (x_i - j) if x_i >= j) or (y + (j - x_i) if j >=x_i) is equivalent to max( y + (x_i - j), y + (j - x_i) ) for all j where a_j > m. \n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see. For a given j, the term |x_i - j| can be written as (x_i - j) if j <= x_i, or (j - x_i) if j >=x_i. Then, the required p_i >= |x_i - j| + y. The maximum of |x_i - j| + y over all j where a_j > m. \n\nBut |x_i - j| + y can be rewritten as (y + (-j) + x_i) if j <=x_i, or y + j - x_i if j >=x_i). So, for all j where a_j > m, the maximum of (x_i - j + y) and (j - x_i + y) must be <= p_i. But the maximum of (x_i - j + y) over all j (where a_j > m) is x_i + (max (y -j )) for j where a_j>m. Similarly, the maximum of (j -x_i + y) is (max (j + y )) - x_i. So, if we precompute the maximum of (y -j) and (j + y), then for each i, the required p_i >= max( x_i + max(y -j), (max(j + y) - x_i ) ). Wait, maybe that's what the code is doing. The variables okX is the maximum of (x + (height - m)), which is x + y where y is height - m. And okY is the maximum of (y - x). So, for each position x where height > m, the y is (height - m). So, j is the current position, and in the delta loop, x is j. So, during the line sweep, when the height (a_j) exceeds m, then we compute y = height - m. Then, okX is the maximum of (j + y), and okY is the maximum of (y - j). For each i-th rain (x_i, p_i), we need that p_i > = (okX - x_i) and p_i >= (x_i + okY). Because:\n\n(okX is the maximum (j + y) for all j where a_j > m. So, the maximum (j + (a_j - m)) is okX. Then, okX - x_i is (j + (a_j -m )) - x_i. But the required p_i must be >= (a_j - m) + |x_i -j|. For j in the problematic regions, |x_i - j| = max(j -x_i, x_i - j). So, (a_j - m) + |x_i -j| can be written as ( (a_j -m) + (j -x_i) ) or ( (a_j -m) + (x_i -j) ). The maximum of (a_j - m) + (j -x_i) is (max ( (a_j - m) + j )) - x_i = (okX) - x_i. The maximum of (a_j -m) + (x_i -j) is x_i + (max ( (a_j -m) -j )) = x_i + okY. \n\nSo, the required p_i must be >= max( okX - x_i, x_i + okY ). If that's the case, then the code's condition for each rain i is whether p_i >= max(okX - x_i, x_i + okY). But in the code, the output is (x + y >= okX and y -x >= okY). Wait, in the code, the variables x and y are the original x_i and p_i of the i-th rain. So, for each (x, y) in A (the original x_i and p_i), the code checks if x + y >= okX and y -x >= okY. \n\nWait, if okX is the maximum (j + (a_j -m)), then for the required condition, we need p_i > = (okX - x_i) and p_i >= (x_i + okY). So, (x_i + p_i) >= okX (since x_i + p_i >= x_i + (okX -x_i) = okX). Similarly, (p_i - x_i) > = okY (since p_i >= x_i + okY implies p_i -x_i >= okY). Wait, no: if p_i >= (x_i + okY), then (p_i -x_i) >= okY. So, the code is checking whether (x_i + p_i) > = okX and (p_i -x_i) >= okY. But how does that relate to the required p_i >= max(okX -x_i, x_i + okY)? Let's see: If p_i >= okX -x_i and p_i >= x_i + okY, then:\n\np_i >= max(okX -x_i, x_i + okY). But (x_i + p_i) >= okX is equivalent to p_i >= okX -x_i. Similarly, (p_i -x_i) >= okY is equivalent to p_i >= x_i + okY. \n\nSo, the code's condition for a rain to be valid (after removing it) is that both (x_i + p_i >= okX) and (p_i -x_i >= okY). Because if both are true, then p_i is >= the maximum of (okX -x_i, x_i + okY), which ensures that for all j where a_j > m in the original scenario, the contribution from the i-th rain (when removed) is sufficient to reduce a_j to <= m. \n\nSo, the code's logic is: compute the maximum (j + (a_j -m)) as okX, and the maximum ((a_j -m) - j) as okY. Then, for each i-th rain, check if (x_i + p_i) > = okX and (p_i -x_i) >= okY.",

Then, for each i-th rain, check if (x_i + p_i) >= okX and (p_i -x_i) >= okY. If yes, then removing that rain would eliminate all the problematic points, so output 1. Else, output 0. \n\nBut what if there are no points where a_j > m? Then, okX and okY would be -2e18 (since the initial values are set to -2e18). In that case, the condition (x_i + p_i >= okX) and (p_i -x_i >= okY) would always be true, since any number is >= -2e18. So, the code outputs all 1's in this case, which is correct because there's no flood in the original scenario, so removing any day's rain still leaves no flood. \n\nSo, the if condition in the code is checking if the current height (the accumulated rainfall) exceeds m. So, the missing code in the if statement is: height > m. \n\nBecause during the line sweep, whenever the current height (a_j) exceeds m, then we compute y = height - m, and update okX and okY with the maximum values of x + y and y -x. \n\nSo the line should be: if (height > m). \n\nYes, that's the missing condition. Because whenever the height (a_j) is greater than m, then we need to track the maximum values for okX and okY. \n\nTherefore, the code to fill in is:\n\nheight > m\n\nSo the missing line is checking if the current height is above m. If so, compute the y and update okX and okY."
