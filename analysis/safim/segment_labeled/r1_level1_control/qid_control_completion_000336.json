So to maximize the sum, we should take all the blocks, since each block's length is ceil(i/2), which increases as i increases. Wait, no. For i from 1 to n, ceil(i/2) increases. Because for i=1, it's 1; i=2, 1; i=3, 2; i=4, 2; i=5, 3, etc. So for even i, it's i/2. For odd i, (i+1)/2. So the sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2) is equal to the sum of the first n terms of the sequence 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,... etc. So the sum S(n) is the sum of the first n terms of that sequence. Let's find a formula for S(n). The sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4, etc. For even n=2k: sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) ) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). For odd n=2k+1: sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2. Let's check:\n\nn=1: 1. For k=0, (0+1)^2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: 1+1=2. For k=1, 1*2=2. Correct.\n\nn=3: 1+1+2=4. (k=1: (1+1)^2=4. Correct.\n\nn=4: 1+1+2+2=6. k=2: 2*3=6. Correct. n=5: sum is 6+3=9. k=2: (2+1)^2=9. Correct. So the sum S(n) is:\n\nIf n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) If n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as S(n) = floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). Wait, for even n=2k: (k) * (k+1). For odd n=2k+1: (k+1)^2 = (k+1)*(k+1). Which can be written as ( (n+1)/2 )^2. But perhaps there's a way to express S(n) as ( (n+1) // 2 ) * ( (n + 2) // 2 ). Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\n(n+1)//2 = (2k +1)//2 = k.\n\n(n+2)//2 = (2k + 2)//2 =k+1. Multiply: k*(k+1) \u2192 correct. For odd n=2k+1:\n\n(n+1)//2 = (2k+2)/2 =k+1.\n\n(n+2)//2 = (2k+3)/2 =k+1 (since integer division). Multiply: (k+1)*(k+1) \u2192 correct. So S(n) = ((n+1)//2) * ((n+2)//2). Wait, let me check: For n=5 (odd 5=2*2 +1):\n\n(n+1)/2=3 \u2192 floor division is 3.\n\n(n+2)/2= (5+2)/2=7/2=3.5 \u2192 floor is 3. So 3 *3=9 \u2192 correct. For n=4 even:\n\n(n+1)/2=5/2=2.5 \u2192 2.\n\n(n+2)/2=6/2=3 \u2192 3*2=6 \u2192 correct. Yes. So S(n ) = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2), using integer division (i.e., floor division). Wait, but in code, when n is even, (n+1)//2 is (2k +1) // 2 =k. Similarly, (n+2)//2 is (2k +2)/2 =k+1. So product is k*(k+1). For odd n=2k+1, (n+1)//2 is (2k+2)//2=k+1, and (n+2)//2 is (2k+3)//2= k+1 (since 2k+3 divided by 2 is k+1.5, but integer division truncates to k+1). So product is (k+1) * (k+1) = (k+1)^2. Which matches the earlier formula. So the total sum is S(n) = ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n + 2) // 2 )\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n).

Wait, but the sample input says for n=5, the sum S(n) is 9, so sqrt(9)=3. So the answer is 3. Which matches the sample. Another sample: when n=1, sum is 1, so answer 1. For n=2, sum is 2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so floor is 1. But the sample says for the second test case, n=5 gives 3. So the formula seems correct. So the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of S(n). Wait, but let's see. For example, n=3: sum is 1+1+2=4. sqrt(4)=2. So s=2. Which is correct. For n=4, sum is 6. sqrt(6) is ~2.449, so s=2. So the square is 2x2, area 4. But sum is 6, which is enough. So yes. So the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S(n). So the solution is to compute S(n) as ((n+1)//2) * ((n+2)//2), then take the square root and floor it. But how to compute that efficiently, especially for n up to 1e9? Wait, let's compute S(n) first. But for n=1e9, S(n) is ( (1e9+1)/2 ) * ( (1e9+2)/2 ). Let's compute for even n:\n\nn=1e9 (even):\n\n(n+1)//2 = 500,000,000.5 \u2192 but integer division, so 5e8 + 0.5? Wait, n is 1e9, even. So (n+1) is 1e9+1. Divided by 2: (1e9 +1)/2 = 500,000,000.5. But in integer division (truncating), it's 500,000,000. (n+2) is 1e9 +2. Divided by 2: 500,000,001.

But when taking the integer part, it's exactly 5e8. Wait, but 5e8*(5e8 +1) = (5e8)^2 +5e8. So the square is (5e8 + 0.5)^2 = 25e16 + 5e8 + 0.25. So the value S(n) is exactly (5e8 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25. So sqrt(S(n)) is slightly less than 5e8 +0.5, so the integer part is 5e8. So the maximum s is 5e8. But how to compute this in code? So the steps for each test case are:\n\n1. Compute S(n) = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2) \u2192 using integer division. 2. Compute s = floor( sqrt(S) ) But how to compute this efficiently? Wait, the product ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2) is equal to (k) * (k) when n is odd (n=2k-1) or k*(k+1) when n is even (n=2k). Wait, let's re-express S(n): If n is even: n=2k \u2192 S =k*(k+1) If n is odd: n=2k-1 \u2192 S =k^2\n\nSo for even n: S(n) =k(k+1) \u2192 find s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 k(k+1). We can see that k^2 < k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k < (k+1)^2. So the sqrt is between k and k+1. So s is k.\n\nWait, because k(k+1) is k\u00b2 +k. For example, k=2: 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449, so s=2. But wait, if n=2k is even, then S(n)=k*(k+1). So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor is k. So for even n, s is k. But k is n/2. So s= n/2. Wait, for example n=2 (even). k=1. s=1. Which is correct. n=4 (even). k=2. s=2. S(n)=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449, floor is 2. Correct.\n\nn=6: k=3. s=3. S=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 s=3. So for even n, s is k =n/2. But what if n is even and S(n) is a perfect square? Wait, n=2k even. S(n) =k(k+1). For k and k+1 being consecutive integers, their product is never a perfect square (since between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2). So for even n, s is k =n/2. For odd n=2k-1: S(n)=k^2. So sqrt(k\u00b2)=k. So s=k. For example, n=3 (2k-1=3 \u2192k=2). S(n)=4, s=2. Correct. So in code, for any n:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( (n/2)*(n/2 +1) ) ) \u2192 which is n/2. if n is odd:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( k^2 ) ) \u2192k. Where k=(n+1)/2. So overall, the maximum s is:\n\ns = ( (n+1) // 2 ) when n is odd. Wait, for n odd:\n\nk = (n+1)/2. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 s=3. Which is correct. For even n: s= n/2. But wait, how can we express this in a single formula? Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\ns= k = n/2. For odd n=2k-1:\n\ns= k = (n+1)/2. But (n+1)/2 for even n=2k is (2k+1)/2= k +0.5. But when using integer division, (n+1)/2 when n is even would be (2k +1)/2= k +0.5, but integer division in C++ truncates towards zero. Wait, no: 2k+1 divided by 2 is k.5, so integer division (using / operator) truncates towards zero. So for even n=2k: (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2= k.5 \u2192 which in integer division would be k, but (n+1) is 2k+1. So (n+1)/2 as integer division is k when even? Wait, for example n=4 (even):\n\n(n+1) =5. 5/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. So (n+1)/2=2. But for odd n=5, (n+1)/2=3. So, for even n, (n+1)/2 is k.5, but integer division truncates to k. For odd n=2k-1, ( n+1)/2= k.\n\nSo, if we compute s as (n+1)//2, then for even n:\n\ns would be (2k +1)/2, which in integer division is k. But for even n=2k, s should be k. So yes. For example, even n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Which is correct (s=2). For odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct. So for all n, s is (n+1) // 2. Wait, wait. Wait, let's test this. n=1 (odd):\n\ns= (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2 (even): s=(2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 integer division gives 1. Correct.\n\nn=3 (odd): (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4 (even): (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. Correct. n=5 (odd):3 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6 (even):3 \u2192 correct (s=3. sqrt(3*4)=sqrt(12)=3.46 \u2192 floor 3). Yes. So the maximum s is (n+1)//2. Wait, but this can't be right. Let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k, s is k. For the sum S(n) =k*(k+1). The maximum s is floor(sqrt(k*(k+1))) which is k. Because sqrt(k^2 +k) is less than k+0.5 (since (k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25). So yes, floor is k. For example, k=2: sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449, s=2. k=3: sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 s=3. So for even n, s is k =n/2. But (n+1)//2 for even n is (n+1)/2 in integer division. For even n=2k: (2k+1)/2= k.5 \u2192 integer division gives k. Which is correct. So yes, the formula s = (n+1) // 2 holds for both even and odd n.\n\nWait, but when n is odd, S(n) is k\u00b2 where k=(n+1)/2, so the square root is exactly k. So s=k. Which is (n+1)/2. So for all n, s is (n+1) divided by 2, using integer division. But how can this be? Because the sample input says when n=5, the answer is 3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Another example: n=6. (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. So s=3. Which is correct as discussed. Wait, but earlier example for even n=6, S(n)=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor is 3. Which matches s=3. So the maximum possible s is (n+1) // 2. Which is equivalent to (n+1) >>1 in binary for integers. But how does this align with the code given? The code provided currently outputs ((n + 1) >> 1). Which is (n+1)/2 using integer division.",

Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be made using n blocks. Each block i has a height of 1 and a length of ceil(i/2). So the area contributed by each block is 1 * ceil(i/2), since they can't be rotated. The total area of the square would be side^2. The sum of all the block lengths (since each contributes area as 1*length) must be at least side^2. So the maximum side is the largest s where the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n is >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the blocks can be arranged in any way, but each block is 1 unit high. So the arrangement must be such that when stacked vertically, they form a square. Since each block is height 1, the total height possible is the number of blocks stacked vertically. But wait, the problem states that the blocks can be arranged without rotating. So each block is placed in a row (height 1), and the length is added horizontally. So the total area is the sum of all the lengths of the blocks used. Because each block's height is 1, to form a square of side s, we need at least s rows, each contributing a total of s units. So the sum of the lengths of the blocks used must be >= s * s (since s rows each of s length). But also, the number of blocks used in each row can't exceed the number of rows (since each row must have at least one block). Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since each block is 1 unit high, when you arrange them, each block occupies a certain number of units in a row. The total area is sum of the lengths of all blocks. To form a square of side s, the sum must be at least s\u00b2. Because each row in the square has s units, and there are s rows, so total area is s\u00b2. But the sum of the blocks' lengths must be >= s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that the sum of the first k blocks (for some k <= n) is >= s\u00b2. And we need the maximum possible s.\n\nWait, but the blocks don't have to be used in order. So we can choose any subset of the blocks. The optimal approach would be to take the blocks that contribute the most length. So to maximize the sum, we should take all the blocks, since each block's length is ceil(i/2), which increases as i increases. Wait, no. For i from 1 to n, ceil(i/2) increases. Because for i=1, it's 1; i=2, 1; i=3, 2; i=4, 2; i=5, 3, etc. So for even i, it's i/2. For odd i, (i+1)/2. So the sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2) is equal to the sum of the first n terms of the sequence 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,... etc.\n\nSo the sum S(n) is the sum of the first n terms of that sequence. Let's find a formula for S(n).\n\nThe sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4, etc. For even n=2k: sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) ) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). For odd n=2k+1: sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2. Let's check:\n\nn=1: 1. For k=0, (0+1)^2=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: 1+1=2. For k=1, 1*2=2. Correct.\n\nn=3: 1+1+2=4. (k=1: (1+1)^2=4. Correct.\n\nn=4: 1+1+2+2=6. k=2: 2*3=6. Correct.\n\nn=5: sum is 6+3=9. k=2: (2+1)^2=9. Correct.\n\nSo the sum S(n) is:\n\nIf n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nIf n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as S(n) = floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). Wait, for even n=2k: (k) * (k+1). For odd n=2k+1: (k+1)^2 = (k+1)*(k+1). Which can be written as ( (n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to express S(n) as ( (n+1) // 2 ) * ( (n + 2) // 2 ). Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\n(n+1)//2 = (2k +1)//2 = k.\n\n(n+2)//2 = (2k + 2)//2 =k+1.\n\nMultiply: k*(k+1) \u2192 correct.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\n(n+1)//2 = (2k+2)/2 =k+1.\n\n(n+2)//2 = (2k+3)/2 =k+1 (since integer division).\n\nMultiply: (k+1)*(k+1) \u2192 correct.\n\nSo S(n) = ((n+1)//2) * ((n+2)//2).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor n=5 (odd 5=2*2 +1):\n\n(n+1)/2=3 \u2192 floor division is 3.\n\n(n+2)/2= (5+2)/2=7/2=3.5 \u2192 floor is 3.\n\nSo 3 *3=9 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor n=4 even:\n\n(n+1)/2=5/2=2.5 \u2192 2.\n\n(n+2)/2=6/2=3 \u2192 3*2=6 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes. So S(n) = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2), using integer division (i.e., floor division).\n\nWait, but in code, when n is even, (n+1)//2 is (2k +1) // 2 =k. Similarly, (n+2)//2 is (2k +2)/2 =k+1. So product is k*(k+1). For odd n=2k+1, (n+1)//2 is (2k+2)//2=k+1, and (n+2)//2 is (2k+3)//2= k+1 (since 2k+3 divided by 2 is k+1.5, but integer division truncates to k+1). So product is (k+1) * (k+1) = (k+1)^2. Which matches the earlier formula.\n\nSo the total sum is S(n) = ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n + 2) // 2 )\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n). So s is the integer part of the square root of S(n).\n\nWait, but S(n) is the sum of all the blocks, which is the maximum possible sum. So the maximum possible square side is the floor of sqrt(S(n)).\n\nWait, but the sample input says for n=5, the sum S(n) is 9, so sqrt(9)=3. So the answer is 3. Which matches the sample. Another sample: when n=1, sum is 1, so answer 1. For n=2, sum is 2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so floor is 1. But the sample says for the second test case, n=5 gives 3. So the formula seems correct.\n\nSo the maximum s is the integer part of the square root of S(n).\n\nWait, but let's see. For example, n=3: sum is 1+1+2=4. sqrt(4)=2. So s=2. Which is correct. For n=4, sum is 6. sqrt(6) is ~2.449, so s=2. So the square is 2x2, area 4. But sum is 6, which is enough. So yes.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S(n). So the solution is to compute S(n) as ((n+1)//2) * ((n+2)//2), then take the square root and floor it.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently, especially for n up to 1e9?\n\nWait, let's compute S(n) first.\n\nBut for n=1e9, S(n) is ( (1e9+1)/2 ) * ( (1e9+2)/2 ). Let's compute for even n:\n\nn=1e9 (even):\n\n(n+1)//2 = 500,000,000.5 \u2192 but integer division, so 5e8 + 0.5? Wait, n is 1e9, even. So (n+1) is 1e9+1. Divided by 2: (1e9 +1)/2 = 500,000,000.5. But in integer division (truncating), it's 500,000,000. (n+2) is 1e9 +2. Divided by 2: 500,000,001. So product is 5e8 * 5e8 +1 \u2192 5e8*(5e8 +1) = 25e16 +5e8. Which is a very large number.\n\nThe square root of S(n) would be sqrt(5e8*(5e8 +1)) \u2248 5e8 * sqrt(1 + 1/(5e8)) \u2248 5e8 + 0.5 (since sqrt(1+x) \u2248 1 + x/2 for small x). But when taking the integer part, it's exactly 5e8.\n\nWait, but 5e8*(5e8 +1) = (5e8)^2 +5e8. So the square is (5e8 + 0.5)^2 = 25e16 + 5e8 + 0.25. So the value S(n) is exactly (5e8 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25. So sqrt(S(n)) is slightly less than 5e8 +0.5, so the integer part is 5e8.\n\nSo the maximum s is 5e8.\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nSo the steps for each test case are:\n\n1. Compute S(n) = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2) \u2192 using integer division.\n\n2. Compute s = floor( sqrt(S) )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, the product ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2) is equal to (k) * (k) when n is odd (n=2k-1) or k*(k+1) when n is even (n=2k).\n\nWait, let's re-express S(n):\n\nIf n is even: n=2k \u2192 S =k*(k+1)\n\nIf n is odd: n=2k-1 \u2192 S =k^2\n\nSo for even n: S(n) =k(k+1) \u2192 find s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 k(k+1).\n\nWe can see that k^2 < k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k < (k+1)^2. So the sqrt is between k and k+1. So s is k.\n\nWait, because k(k+1) is k\u00b2 +k. For example, k=2: 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449, so s=2.\n\nBut wait, if n=2k is even, then S(n)=k*(k+1). So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor is k. So for even n, s is k. But k is n/2. So s= n/2.\n\nWait, for example n=2 (even). k=1. s=1. Which is correct.\n\nn=4 (even). k=2. s=2. S(n)=2*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449, floor is 2. Correct.\n\nn=6: k=3. s=3. S=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 s=3.\n\nSo for even n, s is k =n/2.\n\nBut what if n is even and S(n) is a perfect square?\n\nWait, n=2k even. S(n) =k(k+1). For k and k+1 being consecutive integers, their product is never a perfect square (since between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2). So for even n, s is k =n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2k-1: S(n)=k^2. So sqrt(k\u00b2)=k. So s=k. For example, n=3 (2k-1=3 \u2192k=2). S(n)=4, s=2. Correct.\n\nSo in code, for any n:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( (n/2)*(n/2 +1) ) ) \u2192 which is n/2.\n\nif n is odd:\n\ns = floor( sqrt( k^2 ) ) \u2192k. Where k=(n+1)/2.\n\nSo overall, the maximum s is:\n\ns = ( (n+1) // 2 ) when n is odd.\n\nWait, for n odd:\n\nk = (n+1)/2. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 s=3. Which is correct.\n\nFor even n: s= n/2.\n\nBut wait, how can we express this in a single formula?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\ns= k = n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2k-1:\n\ns= k = (n+1)/2.\n\nBut (n+1)/2 for even n=2k is (2k+1)/2= k +0.5. But when using integer division, (n+1)/2 when n is even would be (2k +1)/2= k +0.5, but integer division in C++ truncates towards zero. Wait, no: 2k+1 divided by 2 is k.5, so integer division (using / operator) truncates towards zero. So for even n=2k: (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2= k.5 \u2192 which in integer division would be k, but (n+1) is 2k+1. So (n+1)/2 as integer division is k when even?\n\nWait, for example n=4 (even):\n\n(n+1) =5. 5/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. So (n+1)/2=2.\n\nBut for odd n=5, (n+1)/2=3.\n\nSo, for even n, (n+1)/2 is k.5, but integer division truncates to k. For odd n=2k-1, (n+1)/2= k.\n\nSo, if we compute s as (n+1)//2, then for even n:\n\ns would be (2k +1)/2, which in integer division is k. But for even n=2k, s should be k. So yes.\n\nFor example, even n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Which is correct (s=2).\n\nFor odd n=5: (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo for all n, s is (n+1) // 2. Wait, wait.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nn=1 (odd):\n\ns= (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2 (even): s=(2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 integer division gives 1. Correct.\n\nn=3 (odd): (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4 (even): (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nn=5 (odd):3 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6 (even):3 \u2192 correct (s=3. sqrt(3*4)=sqrt(12)=3.46 \u2192 floor 3).\n\nYes. So the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, but this can't be right. Let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k, s is k. For the sum S(n) =k*(k+1). The maximum s is floor(sqrt(k*(k+1))) which is k. Because sqrt(k^2 +k) is less than k+0.5 (since (k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25). So yes, floor is k.\n\nFor example, k=2: sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449, s=2.\n\nk=3: sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 s=3.\n\nSo for even n, s is k =n/2.\n\nBut (n+1)//2 for even n is (n+1)/2 in integer division. For even n=2k: (2k+1)/2= k.5 \u2192 integer division gives k. Which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula s = (n+1) // 2 holds for both even and odd n.\n\nWait, but when n is odd, S(n) is k\u00b2 where k=(n+1)/2, so the square root is exactly k. So s=k. Which is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo for all n, s is (n+1) divided by 2, using integer division.\n\nBut how can this be? Because the sample input says when n=5, the answer is 3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. So s=3. Which is correct as discussed.\n\nWait, but earlier example for even n=6, S(n)=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor is 3. Which matches s=3.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is (n+1) // 2. Which is equivalent to (n+1) >>1 in binary for integers.\n\nBut how does this align with the code given?\n\nThe code provided currently outputs ((n + 1) >> 1). Which is (n+1)/2 using integer division. Which according to this analysis, is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but that's the case? So the answer is (n+1)/2, rounded down. But according to the problem statement, the sample input where n=5 gives 3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Another sample where n=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 1. Which is correct, since sum is 2, which can form a 1x1 square.\n\nSo why is the code provided by the user outputting ((n + 1) >>1), but the sample output for n=5 is 3, which is correct. So according to this, the code is correct as is. But the user says that the code is incomplete, specifically the loop condition in the do-while loop. So the missing code is in the loop condition.\n\nThe current code is:\n\ndo {\n    cin >> n;\n    cout << ((n + 1) >> 1) << \"\\n\";\n} while (/* TODO: Your code here */);\n\nThe loop is a do-while, which runs _tc times. The user inputted _tc as the number of test cases. So the loop needs to run exactly _tc times.\n\nBut the current code is a do-while loop. The loop condition should check if the number of iterations is less than _tc. For example, the loop would run once, then check if we have processed all test cases.\n\nWait, the loop is a do-while. So the loop runs once, then checks the condition. So to run exactly _tc times, the code should decrement _tc each time and loop while _tc is not zero.\n\nFor example:\n\ndo {\n   ... process test case ...\n} while (--_tc > 0);\n\nBecause if _tc is the number of test cases, first iteration is executed, then we decrement _tc and check if it's greater than 0. For example, if _tc is 3:\n\n- first iteration: process test case, then _tc becomes 2. Check 2>0 \u2192 loop again.\n\n- second iteration: process, _tc becomes 1. Check 1>0 \u2192 loop again.\n\n- third iteration: process, _tc becomes 0. Check 0>0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo total 3 times.\n\nSo the loop condition should be (--_tc > 0). But the initial code uses a do-while loop, which is executed at least once. So for _tc=0, which can't happen as per input constraints (t is >=1).\n\nBut according to the input specification, t is at least 1. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the missing part is (--_tc > 0).\n\nSo the code should have:\n\ndo {\n    ...\n} while (--_tc > 0);\n\nThus, the correct loop condition is to decrement _tc each time and loop while it is still positive.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is --_tc > 0.\n\nSo the answer is to fill the loop condition with --_tc > 0.\n\nLet me check the sample code:\n\nThe user's code is:\n\n#include \"bits/stdc++.h\"\nusing namespace std;\n\nusing llong = long long;\n\nint _tc;\nllong n;\n\nint main()\n{\n    cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);\n    cin >> _tc;\n    do {\n        cin >> n;\n        cout << ((n + 1) >> 1) << \"\\n\";\n    } while (/* TODO: Your code here */);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThe loop runs once for each test case. The initial code reads _tc, then enters a do-while loop. The loop must process exactly _tc test cases. So the loop runs once, then checks if there are more test cases. The variable _tc is decremented each time, and the loop continues as long as it's >0.\n\nSo the correct loop condition is (--_tc >0). Because:\n\nFor example, if _tc is 3:\n\n- after first iteration: --_tc \u2192 2. Check 2>0 \u2192 loop again.\n\nSecond iteration: --_tc \u21921. Check yes.\n\nThird: --_tc \u21920. Check 0>0 \u2192 no. Exit.\n\nSo total 3 iterations.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the missing code is --_tc > 0."
