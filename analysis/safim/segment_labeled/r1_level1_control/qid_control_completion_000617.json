Oh right, because when merging two leaves into their parent, the values would be grouped in such a way that their parent's value is the maximum divided by 2. Hmm, maybe each level up, the elements are being combined into their parent's possible values. For instance, the leaves are the permutation elements. The next level up would represent pairs of leaves, and their value would be the maximum of the two divided by 2. But considering that each swap can reverse the order.\n\nWait, the key idea here is that for each pair of nodes (left and right children), their parent's value in the next level up depends on whether we swap them. For the tree to be beautiful (leaves in increasing order), each group of two leaves must either be in order (min, max) or (max, min) if a swap is applied.
