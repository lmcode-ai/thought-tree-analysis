The sum of True/False values, which in Python are 1 and 0. So for example, if r is 1400, then the generator would check:\n\n1400 >=1400 \u2192 True (1)\n1400 >=1600 \u2192 False (0)\n1400 >=1900 \u2192 False (0) Sum is 1. So 4-1=3. Which is correct, Division 3. Another example: r is 1600. Then:\n\n1600 >=1400 \u2192 1\n1600 >=1600 \u2192 1\n1600 >=1900 \u2192 0. Sum is 2. 4-2=2. Division 2. Correct. For a rating of 1900, sum is 3 (all three conditions are true), 4-3=1. Division 1. Correct. If r is 1399, then all three conditions are false. Sum is 0. 4-0=4. Division 4. Correct.
