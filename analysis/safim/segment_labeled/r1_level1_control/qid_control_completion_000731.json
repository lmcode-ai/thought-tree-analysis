Let's check the existing conditions. The code currently checks for Division 4 if rating is <=1399. Then Division 3 if between 1400 and 1599 inclusive. Division 2 is 1600 to 1899. So the last else if should cover Division 1. The comment says to fill in the condition here. According to the problem statement, Division 1 is for ratings >=1900. So the condition here should be if the rating is 1900 or higher. So the missing condition is n >= 1900. Let me look at the code. The existing else if is checking if that's true. So the condition should be n >=1900. Because any rating that's not caught by the previous conditions and is >=1900 will be Division 1. Wait, the else if for Division 1 is currently written as else if (/* TODO */). So replacing that with n >=1900 would be correct.",
