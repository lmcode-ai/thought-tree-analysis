Therefore, the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of lengths of some subset of the blocks, and the number of blocks in that subset is >= s. But this seems complicated. How can we model this? Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula for the maximum s given n.\n\nLet me compute sum of lengths for all blocks from 1 to n.\n\nThe sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\nLet's compute this sum. For even i: i = 2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2) = k.\n\nFor odd i: i=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2) = k. So for n blocks, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's split into even and odd terms. If n is even: n=2m.\n\nThen sum is sum_{k=1 to m} (ceil((2k-1)/2) + ceil(2k/2)).\n\nceil((2k-1)/2) = k. ceil(2k/2) = k. So for each pair (2k-1, 2k), the sum is k + k = 2k. Sum from k=1 to m: sum 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). But m = n/2. So sum is (n/2)(n/2 +1). If n is odd: n=2m+1. The sum for the first 2m terms is m(m+1), as above. Then add ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1. So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Since m = (n-1)/2 \u2192 m+1 = (n+1)/2. So sum is ((n+1)/2)^2. So sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) + 1 ) * (n//2 + n%2) ) Wait, perhaps better to compute sum as follows:\n\nFor n:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nYes, that's correct. So the sum is:\n\nsum = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n mod 2 ? 0 : 1 )) ? Alternatively, perhaps there's a general formula for the sum. Wait, let's see for a few examples:\n\nn=1: ceil(1/2) = 1 \u2192 sum=1. Which is ((1+1)/2)^2 = 1. Correct.\n\nn=2: 1 +1 =2 \u2192 (2/2)*(2/2 +1) =1 * 2=2. Correct. n=3: 1 +1 +2 =4 \u2192 ((3+1)/2)^2 = 2^2=4. Correct.\n\nn=4: 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 (4/2)*(4/2+1) =2*3=6. Correct. n=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9 \u2192 ((5+1)/2)^2 =3^2=9. Correct. So sum is:\n\nsum = ( (n +1 ) // 2 ) * ( (n +1 ) // 2 + (n % 2 == 0 ) ) Alternatively, sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n mod 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0 )) But perhaps there's a better way. Let's see:\n\nFor even n=2m: sum = m*(m+1) For odd n=2m+1: sum = (m+1)^2\n\nSo for a given n, the sum is:\n\nsum = ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+1)//2 + (n%2==0) ) But maybe the sum can be written as ( (n+1) // 2 ) * ( (n + 2 ) // 2 )\n\nWait for even n=2m: (2m+1)//2= m.0.5, which for integer division would be m. But (2m+1)//2 is m. Then (2m+2)//2 is m+1. So m*(m+1), which matches. For odd n=2m+1: (2m+2)//2 = m+1, (2m+3)//2 is m+1.5 \u2192 integer division would be m+1. So (m+1)*(m+1) = (m+1)^2, which matches. Yes. So sum is ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+2)//2 ) So sum = floor( (n+1)/2 ) * floor( (n+2)/2 ) So for any n, sum is floor((n+1)/2) * floor((n+2)/2)\n\nWhich is equivalent to (ceil(n/2)) * (ceil(n/2) + (n even ? 1 : 0 )) But how does that help us find the maximum s?",

So the maximum s is the minimum between the s_max1 (the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total) and s_max2 (which is n, because you can't use more than n blocks, so s can't be larger than n). Wait, but even if s is larger than n, you can't have s rows because each row requires at least one block, so the number of blocks used must be >= s. But the maximum number of blocks available is n. So s cannot exceed n. So s is the minimum between floor(sqrt(sum_total)) and n.\n\nWait, that's possible. Let's see. For example, if n is 5:\n\nsum_total is 9. sqrt(9) is 3. So s is min(3,5) \u21923. Which matches the sample. Another example: n=1. sum is 1. sqrt(1)=1. min(1,1)=1. Correct. Another example: n=2. sum is 2. sqrt is ~1.414. floor is 1. min(1,2)=1. But wait, the sum is 2. So s\u00b2 must be <=2. So s can be 1 (1<=2) but can't be 2 (4>2). So the maximum s is 1. But according to the sample input 2, when n=5, the answer is 3. Which matches. So the formula would be s = min( floor( sqrt( sum_total ) , n ) Wait, but what if sum_total is 10, n is 4. Then sqrt(10) is ~3.16 \u2192 floor is 3. s=3. Which is <=4 (n=4). So it's allowed. But what if sum_total is 20, n=3. Then sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor 4. But n=3. So s is min(4,3) \u21923. So even though sum_total is 20 (3^2=9 <20), but you can't have s=4 since you need 4 blocks (each row requires at least one block). So the answer is 3. So the formula s = min( floor( sqrt(sum) ), n ) But sum is ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+2)//2 ) So the maximum possible s is the minimum between floor( sqrt( sum ) ) and n. But wait, is that always the case? Wait, let's test some cases. Case n=3:\n\nsum = (4//2) * (5//2) = 2 * 2 =4. sum is 4. sqrt(4)=2. So s is min(2,3) \u21922. But wait, let's think. In this case, sum is 4. So s\u00b2=4 \u2192 s=2. And the number of blocks is 3. 2 <=3. So yes. So maximum s is 2. Let's see:\n\nThe blocks are:\n\n1:1, 2:1, 3:2. Sum is 4. So you can make 2x2 square, using 2 rows. Each row must be sum 2. For example, row 1: block 3 (length 2). Row 2: blocks 1 and 2 (sum 1+1=2). So total blocks used is 3 >=2. So yes, s=2 is possible. So formula gives 2, correct. Another case: n=4. sum is (5//2)*(6//2) \u21922*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor 2. min(2,4)=2. So s=2. But sum is 6, s\u00b2=4. So 2x2. But can we make a 2x2 square? Sum is 6, so yes. But what about using more blocks?\n\nWait, but the maximum s is the largest possible. So for sum=6, the maximum possible s is 2 (since 3^2=9>6). So yes. But what if n=5, sum is 9. sqrt(9)=3. n=5. So min(3,5)=3. Correct. Another case: n=6. sum is (7//2)*(8//2)=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u21923. So min(3,6)=3. s=3. sum is 12 >=3\u00b2=9. So possible. Yes. So the formula seems to work. So the maximum possible s is the minimum between floor( sqrt( sum ) ) and n.\n\nWait, but another case: n=4. sum=6. floor sqrt is 2. But sum is 6, which is larger than 2\u00b2=4. Can we get s=2? Yes, but can we get a larger s?\n\nNo, because 3\u00b2=9>6. So the formula holds. So now, the problem reduces to: For each n, compute sum = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2) (using integer division), then compute s = min( floor( sqrt(sum) ), n ) Wait, but sum is (ceil(n/2)) * (ceil(n/2) + (n even ? 1 :0 )). So in code, sum can be computed as ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2). But in C++, since integer division truncates, (n+1)/2 is equivalent to ceil(n/2) when n is even or odd. So for n=5: (5+1)/2 =3, (5+2)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. So 3*3=9.\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=2, (4+2)/2=3 \u2192 2*3=6. So code can compute sum as ( (n+1)/2 ) * ( (n+2)/2 )\n\nBut sum could be a very large number, up to ( (1e9+1)/2 ) * ( (1e9+2)/2 ) \u2248 (5e8)^2 \u2192 2.5e17, which is within 64-bit integer's capacity. So in code, sum is ( (n+1LL)/2 ) * ( (n+2LL)/2 ) But in C++, using integers, perhaps:\n\nlong long m = (n + 1) / 2;\n\nlong long sum = m * ( (n + 2)/2 );\n\nBut then, compute s as the floor of sqrt(sum). Then take the minimum between s and n.\n\nWait, but wait, in the case where sum is a perfect square. For example, n=5 sum=9. s=3, which is min(3,5) \u21923. Correct. Another example: n=6 sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. floor is 3. min(3,6)=3. sum=12 >=3^2=9. Correct. Another example: n=2 sum=2. sqrt(2)=1.414. floor is 1. min(1,2)=1. Correct. So the code needs to compute s as the floor of sqrt(sum), then output min(s, n). But wait, in code, the formula given in the code is \"N / 2 + ( N % 2 )\". For example, for N=5: 5/2=2 + 1 \u21923, which matches. For N=6:6/2=3 + 0 \u21923. Which is the same as the s=3 in the previous example. But according to our analysis, the correct answer should be floor( sqrt( sum ) ), which for N=6 is 3. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait the code provided is:\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\" , N / 2 + ( N % 2 ) ) ; But according to the sample input where N=5, this outputs 3, which is correct. But according to our previous analysis, the answer should be min( floor(sqrt(sum)), n ). But for N=5, sum is 9, sqrt(9)=3. So min(3,5)=3. Correct. But let's see for N=6: sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. The code would output 6/2 +0=3. Which matches. For N=4: code outputs 4/2 +0=2. sum is 6. sqrt(6)=2.44 \u21922. Correct. For N=3: code outputs 1+1=2. sum is 4. sqrt(4)=2. min(2,3)=2. Correct.",

But what about the other condition, s <=n? But for even n=2k: k= n/2. So s=k. Which is 2k/2 =k <=2k \u2192 yes. For odd n=2k-1: s=k. n=2k-1. So s=k. For example, n=5 (k=3): 3 <=5 \u2192 yes. So for all n, the code's formula gives s= floor( sqrt( sum )) and also s <=n. So the code's formula is correct. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause for even n=2k: sum is k(k+1). The floor sqrt is k. So s=k. Which is 2k/2 =k. So s= k <=n.\n\nFor odd n=2k-1: sum isk\u00b2 \u2192 s=k. Which is (2k-1+1)/2 =k. And s=k <=2k-1. For k>=1, 2k-1 >=k when k>=1. So yes. So in all cases, s= floor( sqrt( sum )) = (n +1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even.",

The initial code has a while loop that runs T times. The loop condition is missing. The correct loop condition is to run T times. So the loop should be while (T--), because T is read as the number of test cases, and each iteration decrements T until it becomes zero. So the missing code is T--.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using the given blocks. Hmm.\n\nSo each block i has a height of 1 and a length of ceil(i/2). So for example, block 1 is 1x1, block 2 is 1x1, block3 is 1x2, etc. The total area of all blocks is the sum of the lengths (since each is height 1, so sum of lengths gives total area). The maximum square side length s must satisfy s^2 \u2264 total sum of lengths.\n\nWait, right. So the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that s\u00b2 is \u2264 sum of all ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nBut wait, the blocks can be arranged in any way as long as their dimensions are used properly. Because each block contributes 1 unit in height and some length. So when building the square, each block is placed horizontally, contributing 1 row (since height is 1) and some columns. So the sum of the lengths of the blocks used must be at least s * s, because each row of the square (of height 1) needs to cover s columns. But since each row can consist of multiple blocks as long as their total length is >= s. Wait, no. Wait, the square is made by placing blocks in such a way that each row in the square (height 1) must have exactly s units of length. So each row in the square is formed by one or more blocks placed horizontally, adding up to exactly s. Because otherwise, if you have more than s, you can't fit into the square's width. So the sum of all the lengths of the blocks used must be exactly s*s, and also, there must be enough blocks to cover s rows (since each row is height 1, so s rows require s blocks' heights). Wait, no. Each row in the square is a row of s units length. Since each block has height 1, you can use a single block to contribute part of a row. So to form a row of length s, you can combine multiple blocks in that row. For example, if s is 3, a row could be made by a block of length 2 and another of length 1. The total per row is the sum of the blocks' lengths in that row. So the total area is the sum of all the blocks' lengths (since each contributes 1 unit height multiplied by their length). The maximum possible s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 \u2264 total sum of all available blocks. But also, you need to have enough blocks to cover the rows. Wait, no. Because each row is a single row (height 1), but you can use multiple blocks in a row. So the total number of blocks needed is at least s, because each row uses at least one block. Wait, no. For example, if s is 3, each row can be made with 1 block of length 3 (if available), which would require 3 blocks for 3 rows. Or maybe two blocks per row, requiring 6 blocks. So the sum of the lengths is s\u00b2, but the number of blocks used must be at least s (since each row uses at least one block). Therefore, the maximum s is not only determined by the sum but also by the number of blocks available. So there are two constraints:\n\n1. s\u00b2 \u2264 total sum of lengths (sum)\n2. s \u2264 number of blocks used (each row uses at least one block, so the number of blocks used is at least s)\n\nBut the sum of the lengths of the blocks used must be exactly s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the minimum between the largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum and s \u2264 k, where k is the number of blocks used.\n\nWait, but the blocks used can be any subset. So the problem is to find the maximum s such that there exists a subset of blocks with sum of lengths >= s\u00b2, and the number of blocks in the subset >= s. Because each row in the square needs to have at least one block (since each row is a separate row, each with height 1, and each block can only be part of one row). So the number of blocks used must be >= s (since each of the s rows must use at least one block). Therefore, the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of lengths of some subset of the blocks, and the number of blocks in that subset is >= s.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula for the maximum s given n.\n\nLet me compute sum of lengths for all blocks from 1 to n.\n\nThe sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\nLet's compute this sum.\n\nFor even i: i = 2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2) = k.\n\nFor odd i: i=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2) = k.\n\nSo for n blocks, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet's split into even and odd terms.\n\nIf n is even: n=2m.\n\nThen sum is sum_{k=1 to m} (ceil((2k-1)/2) + ceil(2k/2)).\n\nceil((2k-1)/2) = k. ceil(2k/2) = k.\n\nSo for each pair (2k-1, 2k), the sum is k + k = 2k.\n\nSum from k=1 to m: sum 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1).\n\nBut m = n/2. So sum is (n/2)(n/2 +1).\n\nIf n is odd: n=2m+1.\n\nThe sum for the first 2m terms is m(m+1), as above. Then add ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1.\n\nSo total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Since m = (n-1)/2 \u2192 m+1 = (n+1)/2. So sum is ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) + 1 ) * (n//2 + n%2) )\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute sum as follows:\n\nFor n:\n\nif n is even:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nsum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nsum = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n mod 2 ? 0 : 1 )) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a general formula for the sum.\n\nWait, let's see for a few examples:\n\nn=1: ceil(1/2) = 1 \u2192 sum=1. Which is ((1+1)/2)^2 = 1. Correct.\n\nn=2: 1 +1 =2 \u2192 (2/2)*(2/2 +1) =1 * 2=2. Correct.\n\nn=3: 1 +1 +2 =4 \u2192 ((3+1)/2)^2 = 2^2=4. Correct.\n\nn=4: 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 (4/2)*(4/2+1) =2*3=6. Correct.\n\nn=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9 \u2192 ((5+1)/2)^2 =3^2=9. Correct.\n\nSo sum is:\n\nsum = ( (n +1 ) // 2 ) * ( (n +1 ) // 2 + (n % 2 == 0 ) )\n\nAlternatively, sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n mod 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0 )) \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let's see:\n\nFor even n=2m: sum = m*(m+1)\n\nFor odd n=2m+1: sum = (m+1)^2\n\nSo for a given n, the sum is:\n\nsum = ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+1)//2 + (n%2==0) )\n\nBut maybe the sum can be written as ( (n+1) // 2 ) * ( (n + 2 ) // 2 )\n\nWait for even n=2m: (2m+1)//2= m.0.5, which for integer division would be m. But (2m+1)//2 is m. Then (2m+2)//2 is m+1. So m*(m+1), which matches.\n\nFor odd n=2m+1: (2m+2)//2 = m+1, (2m+3)//2 is m+1.5 \u2192 integer division would be m+1. So (m+1)*(m+1) = (m+1)^2, which matches.\n\nYes. So sum is ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+2)//2 )\n\nSo sum = floor( (n+1)/2 ) * floor( (n+2)/2 )\n\nSo for any n, sum is floor((n+1)/2) * floor((n+2)/2)\n\nWhich is equivalent to (ceil(n/2)) * (ceil(n/2) + (n even ? 1 : 0 ))\n\nBut how does that help us find the maximum s?\n\nThe maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum and s \u2264 k, where k is the maximum number of blocks that can be used. Wait, but the sum is the sum of all blocks. So sum is the maximum possible sum (since you can use all blocks). So the maximum possible s is the largest s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 sum, and also s \u2264 n (since each row requires at least one block, so to have s rows, you need at least s blocks). Wait, but if sum is >= s\u00b2, and the number of blocks is >= s, then s is possible.\n\nWait, the problem allows using any subset of the blocks. So the sum of the subset's lengths must be >= s\u00b2, and the number of blocks in the subset must be >= s. Because each row uses at least one block, so the subset must have at least s blocks (since there are s rows each needing at least one block).\n\nBut how to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum_subset and subset has >= s blocks.\n\nBut to maximize s, it's best to take the largest possible sum_subset, which is the sum of all blocks. So sum_subset is sum_total = sum(ceil(i/2)), and the number of blocks is n. So the maximum possible s is the minimum between the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total, and s <= n.\n\nWait, no. Because sum_total could be larger than s\u00b2, but s could be larger than n. For example, if sum_total is very large but n is small. Then even if s\u00b2 <= sum_total, you can't have s rows unless you have at least s blocks.\n\nSo the maximum s is the minimum between the s_max1 (the largest s where s\u00b2 <= sum_total) and s_max2 (which is n, because you can't use more than n blocks, so s can't be larger than n). Wait, but even if s is larger than n, you can't have s rows because each row requires at least one block, so the number of blocks used must be >= s. But the maximum number of blocks available is n. So s cannot exceed n.\n\nSo s is the minimum between floor(sqrt(sum_total)) and n.\n\nWait, that's possible. Let's see.\n\nFor example, if n is 5:\n\nsum_total is 9. sqrt(9) is 3. So s is min(3,5) \u21923. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: n=1. sum is 1. sqrt(1)=1. min(1,1)=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2. sum is 2. sqrt is ~1.414. floor is 1. min(1,2)=1. But wait, the sum is 2. So s\u00b2 must be <=2. So s can be 1 (1<=2) but can't be 2 (4>2). So the maximum s is 1.\n\nBut according to the sample input 2, when n=5, the answer is 3. Which matches.\n\nSo the formula would be s = min( floor( sqrt( sum_total ) , n )\n\nWait, but what if sum_total is 10, n is 4. Then sqrt(10) is ~3.16 \u2192 floor is 3. s=3. Which is <=4 (n=4). So it's allowed.\n\nBut what if sum_total is 20, n=3. Then sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor 4. But n=3. So s is min(4,3) \u21923. So even though sum_total is 20 (3^2=9 <20), but you can't have s=4 since you need 4 blocks (each row requires at least one block). So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the formula s = min( floor( sqrt(sum) ), n )\n\nBut sum is ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+2)//2 )\n\nSo the maximum possible s is the minimum between floor( sqrt( sum ) ) and n. But wait, is that always the case?\n\nWait, let's test some cases.\n\nCase n=3:\n\nsum = (4//2) * (5//2) = 2 * 2 =4. sum is 4. sqrt(4)=2. So s is min(2,3) \u21922. But wait, let's think.\n\nIn this case, sum is 4. So s\u00b2=4 \u2192 s=2. And the number of blocks is 3. 2 <=3. So yes. So maximum s is 2. Let's see:\n\nThe blocks are:\n\n1:1, 2:1, 3:2. Sum is 4. So you can make 2x2 square, using 2 rows. Each row must be sum 2. For example, row 1: block 3 (length 2). Row 2: blocks 1 and 2 (sum 1+1=2). So total blocks used is 3 >=2. So yes, s=2 is possible. So formula gives 2, correct.\n\nAnother case: n=4. sum is (5//2)*(6//2) \u21922*3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor 2. min(2,4)=2. So s=2. But sum is 6, s\u00b2=4. So 2x2. But can we make a 2x2 square? Sum is 6, so yes. But what about using more blocks?\n\nWait, but the maximum s is the largest possible. So for sum=6, the maximum possible s is 2 (since 3^2=9>6). So yes.\n\nBut what if n=5, sum is 9. sqrt(9)=3. n=5. So min(3,5)=3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=6. sum is (7//2)*(8//2)=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u21923. So min(3,6)=3. s=3. sum is 12 >=3\u00b2=9. So possible.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nSo the maximum possible s is the minimum between floor( sqrt( sum ) ) and n.\n\nWait, but another case: n=4. sum=6. floor sqrt is 2. But sum is 6, which is larger than 2\u00b2=4. Can we get s=2? Yes, but can we get a larger s?\n\nNo, because 3\u00b2=9>6.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each n, compute sum = ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2) (using integer division), then compute s = min( floor( sqrt(sum) ), n )\n\nWait, but sum is (ceil(n/2)) * (ceil(n/2) + (n even ? 1 :0 )). So in code, sum can be computed as ((n+1)/2) * ((n+2)/2). But in C++, since integer division truncates, (n+1)/2 is equivalent to ceil(n/2) when n is even or odd.\n\nSo for n=5: (5+1)/2 =3, (5+2)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. So 3*3=9.\n\nn=4: (4+1)/2=2, (4+2)/2=3 \u2192 2*3=6.\n\nSo code can compute sum as ( (n+1)/2 ) * ( (n+2)/2 )\n\nBut sum could be a very large number, up to ( (1e9+1)/2 ) * ( (1e9+2)/2 ) \u2248 (5e8)^2 \u2192 2.5e17, which is within 64-bit integer's capacity.\n\nSo in code, sum is ( (n+1LL)/2 ) * ( (n+2LL)/2 )\n\nBut in C++, using integers, perhaps:\n\nlong long m = (n + 1) / 2;\n\nlong long sum = m * ( (n + 2)/2 );\n\nBut then, compute s as the floor of sqrt(sum). Then take the minimum between s and n.\n\nWait, but wait, in the case where sum is a perfect square. For example, n=5 sum=9. s=3, which is min(3,5) \u21923. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6 sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. floor is 3. min(3,6)=3. sum=12 >=3^2=9. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2 sum=2. sqrt(2)=1.414. floor is 1. min(1,2)=1. Correct.\n\nSo the code needs to compute s as the floor of sqrt(sum), then output min(s, n).\n\nBut wait, in code, the formula given in the code is \"N / 2 + ( N % 2 )\". For example, for N=5: 5/2=2 + 1 \u21923, which matches. For N=6:6/2=3 + 0 \u21923. Which is the same as the s=3 in the previous example. But according to our analysis, the correct answer should be floor( sqrt( sum ) ), which for N=6 is 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait the code provided is:\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\" , N / 2 + ( N % 2 ) ) ;\n\nBut according to the sample input where N=5, this outputs 3, which is correct. But according to our previous analysis, the answer should be min( floor(sqrt(sum)), n ). But for N=5, sum is 9, sqrt(9)=3. So min(3,5)=3. Correct.\n\nBut let's see for N=6: sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. The code would output 6/2 +0=3. Which matches.\n\nFor N=4: code outputs 4/2 +0=2. sum is 6. sqrt(6)=2.44 \u21922. Correct.\n\nFor N=3: code outputs 1+1=2. sum is 4. sqrt(4)=2. min(2,3)=2. Correct.\n\nWait, so in all these examples, the code's formula (N//2 + (N%2)) gives the same result as the correct answer. So perhaps the correct formula is (n +1)/2 ?\n\nWait, for N=5: (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nN=6:6/2=3. Correct.\n\nN=2:2/2=1. Correct.\n\nN=1:1/2=0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nWait, but how? How can the answer be (n +1)/2 when according to the problem analysis, the answer should be min( floor( sqrt(sum) ), n )?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's compute sum and sqrt(sum):\n\nsum = ( (n+1)//2 ) * ( (n+2)//2 )\n\nLet's denote m = (n+1)//2. Then sum = m * (m + ( (n+2) - (n+1) )//2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's compute sum as m * ( (n+2) // 2 )\n\nBut (n+2) //2 = m + ( (n is even ) ? 0 : 1 )\n\nWait, for even n: n=2k. Then (n+1)/2 = (2k +1)/2 = k.0.5 \u2192 in integer division, it's k. (n+2)/2 = (2k+2)/2= k+1. So sum is k*(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k.\n\nsqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is between k and k+1. So floor is k.\n\nBut the code's formula gives (2k)/2 +0 =k. So the code's output is k. Which is equal to the floor(sqrt(sum)).\n\nFor example, n=4: k=2. sum is 2*3=6. floor(sqrt(6))=2. code gives 4/2=2.\n\nFor n=6: k=3. sum is3*4=12. floor(sqrt(12))=3. code gives6/2=3.\n\nFor odd n=2k-1. Then m=(2k-1+1)/2= k. sum =k * ( (2k-1 +2)/2 ) \u2192 (2k+1)/2. For example, n=5 (k=3): (5+2)/2=3.5 \u2192 integer division truncates to 3. So sum is3*3=9. sqrt is3.\n\nFor n=3 (k=2): (3+2)/2=2.5 \u21922. sum=2*2=4. sqrt is 2.\n\nSo for odd n, sum is k * ( (2k+1)/2 ), but wait, n=2k-1. So (n+2) is 2k+1. (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5. Integer division would be k. So sum is k*k.\n\nFor example, n=5: k=3. sum=3*3=9.\n\nSo for odd n=2k-1:\n\nsum =k *k =k\u00b2.\n\nSo floor( sqrt(sum) ) is k.\n\nWhich is exactly (n+1)/2. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3.\n\nSo for even n=2k:\n\nsum= k(k+1). sqrt(sum) is between k and k+1. So floor is k.\n\nWhich is (n)/2. So code gives n/2 +0 =k.\n\nFor odd n=2k-1:\n\nsum=k\u00b2. floor sqrt isk. code gives (2k-1 +1)/2= k.\n\nSo in all cases, the code's formula (n//2 + (n%2)) equals k for even and odd n. Which is exactly the floor of sqrt(sum). Because sum for even n is k(k+1) \u2192sqrt is between k and k+1 \u2192 floor is k. For odd n, sum isk\u00b2 \u2192sqrt isk.\n\nBut what about the other condition, s <=n?\n\nBut for even n=2k: k= n/2. So s=k. Which is 2k/2 =k <=2k \u2192 yes.\n\nFor odd n=2k-1: s=k. n=2k-1. So s=k. For example, n=5 (k=3): 3 <=5 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo for all n, the code's formula gives s= floor( sqrt( sum )) and also s <=n. So the code's formula is correct.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause for even n=2k: sum is k(k+1). The floor sqrt is k. So s=k. Which is 2k/2 =k. So s= k <=n.\n\nFor odd n=2k-1: sum isk\u00b2 \u2192 s=k. Which is (2k-1+1)/2 =k. And s=k <=2k-1. For k>=1, 2k-1 >=k when k>=1. So yes.\n\nSo in all cases, s= floor( sqrt( sum )) = (n +1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. Which is exactly what the code computes.\n\nSo the code's formula is correct. So the problem's solution is simply (n +1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. Or, in code, n//2 + (n%2).\n\nSo the code is correct. But wait, let me test another example.\n\nn=7 (odd): sum= (7+1)/2=4, (7+2)/2=4.5 \u21924. So sum=4*4=16. sqrt(16)=4. s=4. Which is code's formula:7//2 +1 \u21923+1=4. Correct.\n\nn=8 (even): sum= (8+1)/2=4.5 \u21924, (8+2)/2=5. sum=4*5=20. sqrt(20)=4.47 \u21924. code gives 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nBut wait, sum is 20. So s=4, but 4^2=16 <=20. So it's allowed. But also, the number of blocks is 8 >=4. So correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the loop condition for the while loop.\n\nThe current code has:\n\nwhile( /* TODO: Your code here */ ) scanf(\"%d\" , &N ) , printf(\"%d\\n\" , N / 2 + ( N % 2 ) ) ; \n\nSo the loop is supposed to read T test cases. The initial code has a while loop that runs T times. The loop condition is missing.\n\nThe correct loop condition is to run T times. So the loop should be while (T--), because T is read as the number of test cases, and each iteration decrements T until it becomes zero.\n\nSo the missing code is T--.\n\nSo the completed code would have while(T--)."
