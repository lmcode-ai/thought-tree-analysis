The odd elements (1 +0) mod 2 =1. So all elements are 1 mod 2 (odd). So conditions are satisfied. Thus, the code would output YES. Another test case where even elements are not same parity: e.g., array [1,2,3,3]. Even indices are 2 and 4. a[2] is 2%2=0. a[4] is 3%2=1. So y is 0, but a[4]%2 is 1.

The problem is about determining if after any number of operations (adding 1 to even or odd indexed elements), all elements can have the same parity. So the answer is YES if possible, else NO.\n\nThe existing code reads the test cases. For each element in the array, it checks if the parity (even or odd) matches the expected parity based on their position. The variable x is the parity of the first element (index 1), and y is the parity of the second element (index 2). Then, for elements starting from index 3, if the index is odd (like 3,5, etc.), their parity is compared to x. For even indexes (like 4,6, etc.), their parity is compared to y. If any of them don't match, fg is set to 1, which makes the output NO.\n\nBut wait, why are the even indexes compared to y? Because the even indexes in the array (which are 2,4,6 etc.) are being modified by the even operations. Each even operation adds 1 to even indices, which would flip their parity each time. Similarly, odd operations add 1 to odd indices, flipping their parity each time.\n\nBut the key here is that when you perform any number of operations, you can adjust the parities of the elements. However, the problem requires that all elements end up with the same parity. So how do the operations affect this?\n\nLet me think. Let's break it down.\n\nThe parity of each element depends on their initial parity and the number of times operations are applied that affect them. For example, elements at odd indices are affected by odd operations. Each such operation adds 1, so each operation toggles their parity. Similarly for even indices and even operations.\n\nThe goal is to have all elements even or all odd. So, for each element, the parity after applying operations must be the same across all elements.\n\nBut how can the operations affect the parities?\n\nLet's model the problem. Let's say we have two types of operations: O (odd operations) and E (even operations). Each O adds 1 to all odd indices, and each E adds 1 to all even indices. The number of O and E can be any non-negative integer.\n\nEach element's final parity is determined by the initial parity plus the number of times it was modified by the operations.\n\nFor an element at position i:\n\n- If i is odd: it's modified by O operations.

Let's think about the parity of elements based on their positions.\n\nThe problem reduces to: for all odd-indexed elements, their parities (after adjusting for possible O operations) must be the same, and for even-indexed elements, their parities (after E operations) must also be the same. But how can O and E operations be chosen to achieve this?\n\nWait, the O and E operations can be applied any number of times. So, for odd indices, their parity can be adjusted by choosing k (the number of O operations). Since each O affects all odd indices, the parity of each odd element is a_i % 2 plus k mod 2.

So for the parity, it's only the parity of k that matters, not the actual count. So for example, whether you apply O once or three times, the effect on the parity is the same (since 3 mod 2 is 1). So effectively, choosing k to be 0 or 1 (mod 2) is sufficient.\n\nSo, for all odd indices, their a_i % 2 must be the same when considering that each can have their parity flipped (if k is 1).

So (x +k) and (y +m) must be equal mod 2. So (x +k - y -m) must be even. Which can be rewritten as (x - y) + (k - m) is even. Since k and m are variables (can be 0 or 1), we can choose k and m such that (k - m) mod 2 is equal to (y - x) mod 2. Because then (x - y) + (k -m) mod 2 would be zero.\n\nLet me see:\n\nWe need (x + k) \u2261 (y + m) mod 2.\n\nRearranged: x - y \u2261 m -k mod 2.\n\nWhich is the same as: (m -k) \u2261 (x - y) mod 2.\n\nBut m and k can be 0 or 1. So we can find m and k such that this equation holds.\n\nFor example, if x and y are the same (x - y is 0 mod 2), then m -k must be 0 mod 2. So m and k must have the same parity. So possible options: k=0, m=0; k=1, m=1. Then (x +k) is x, (y +m) is y, which are equal. So in this case, possible.\n\nIf x and y are different (x - y is 1 mod 2), then m -k must be 1 mod 2. So m and k must differ. For example, k=0, m=1; or k=1, m=0.\n\nSo regardless of the initial x and y, as long as all odd positions have the same parity (x) and all even positions have the same parity (y), then there exists k and m (0 or 1) such that (x +k) \u2261 (y +m) mod 2. Thus, the overall parities can be made the same.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking two conditions:\n\n1. All elements at odd indices have the same parity.\n\n2. All elements at even indices have the same parity.\n\nIf these two conditions are satisfied, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nSo the code in the existing program checks for these two conditions.\n\nIn the code, for each test case, after reading the first two elements (a[1] and a[2]), x is set to a[1]%2 and y to a[2]%2. Then, for elements from 3 to m:\n\nIf the element is at an odd index (j%2 ==1), check if a[j]%2 equals x. If not, set fg=1 (invalid). Similarly, for even indexes (j%2 ==0), check if a[j]%2 equals y. If not, set fg=1.\n\nBut in the existing code, the even index check has a TODO. The code has:\n\nif(j%2==0){\n   if(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n   fg=1;\n }\n}\n\nSo the missing condition here is whether a[j]%2 is equal to y. Because even indexes (positions 2,4, etc.) must all have the same parity (y) as a[2]. So the condition should be if a[j]%2 != y.\n\nSo the code for the even indices would be: if (a[j] %2 != y) then fg=1.\n\nSo the missing code is: a[j]%2 != y.\n\nSo replacing the TODO with a[j]%2 != y.\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example from the problem:\n\nTest case 1: array [1, 2, 1]. The indices are 1 (odd, x=1%2=1), 2 (even, y=2%2=0). Third element is index 3 (odd), value 1%2=1, which matches x. So all odds are 1, even is 0. Then, the code would output YES. But according to the note, it's possible to make all elements odd. How?\n\nBecause x is 1 (all odds have parity 1), y is 0 (even elements have parity 0). Then, choosing k=0 (no O operations), m=1 (one E operation). The even elements will have 0 +1 =1 mod 2. The odd elements (1 +0) mod 2 =1. So all elements are 1 mod 2 (odd). So conditions are satisfied.\n\nThus, the code would output YES.\n\nAnother test case where even elements are not same parity: e.g., array [1,2,3,3]. Even indices are 2 and 4. a[2] is 2%2=0. a[4] is 3%2=1. So y is 0, but a[4]%2 is 1. So condition 2 fails, fg=1, output NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is checking if a[j]%2 is not equal to y for even indices."
