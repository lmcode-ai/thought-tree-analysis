Oh, maybe the initial approach is correct. But wait, the third example says that if the sum is less than m, you don't need to restore. So the code's approach would be right. But why is that code not passing all cases?\n\nWait, maybe the code is incomplete. Because the original code's for loop is missing parts. Let me check the code again.\n\nThe code starts with int t, m, n, s, a. Then reads t. For each test case, s=0, read n and m. Then there's a for loop where the condition is missing. Then, inside the loop, a is read, added to s. Then after the loop, output max(0, s - m).\n\nSo the code sums all a_i's, subtracts m, and if the result is positive, that's the answer. Otherwise, zero. But that's the approach, but according to the problem statement, this might be correct. Because each a_i is the distance between bench i and i+1. So the total distance is sum(a_i).

So the problem with the code is that the loop is incomplete, and thus not reading all the a_i's. So the missing code is the loop's initializer, condition, and increment.\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the for loop as for(int i=0; i <n; i++).\n\nLet me check the example.
