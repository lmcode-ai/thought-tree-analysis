Let's compare:\n\n2m +n -2 < 2n +m -2 \u2192 2m +n < 2n +m \u2192 m <n. So the first formula is better when m <n. So the condition is m <n. Wait, but the sample had m=5, n=7 (m <n?), no. Wait sample input was n=7, m=5. So 5<7. So the first formula is chosen. Which gives 15. So that's correct. So the condition should be m <n? Then in that case, the first formula is used. Otherwise, the second. Wait, but let's see for m=3, n=2. Then 2m +n-2 =6+2-2=6. The other formula is 2n +m-2=4+3-2=5. So 5 is better. So when m> n, the second formula is better. So the condition in the else if would be m <=n? Or perhaps when m <n, use the first formula, else the second. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf n=2, m=3. Then m>n. So the code would use else clause and output 2n +m-2 =4+3-2=5. Which is correct. If n=3, m=3 (equal). Then 2m +n-2=6+3-2=7, the other is 2n +m-2=6+3-2=7. So same. So in the code, if the condition is m <=n, then the first formula is used. But in that case, when m equals n, either formula gives the same result. So the code's condition can be either m <=n or m <n, but since for m=n, both formulas are same, the code can choose either. But looking back at the sample input where n=7, m=5, the code used the first formula. So the condition must check whether m is less than or equal to n. Because 5<7, the condition is true. So the code's else if condition is checking if m <=n. So that's the missing condition. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The sample input uses 2m +n-2 when m=5 and n=7. So m is less than n. So the condition is (m <=n). So the code's else if condition would be (m <=n). But wait, in the code, after the first check for m==1 and n==1, the else if is (m <=n). Then the code uses the first formula. Otherwise, the else uses the second. So for the code, the missing condition in the else if is (m <=n). But wait, let's check another case where m=2 and n=1. Wait, the first condition is m==1 and n==1, which isn't the case here. Then else if (m <=n). Here, m=2 and n=1. So 2 <=1 is false. So the code would go to else, which uses 2n +m-2 =2*1+2-2=2. But what's the correct answer in that case? Wait, let's think for n=1, m=2. So it's a 1x2 grid. Stanley's path: (1,1) to (1,2). He can move right once. So 1 unit. Megan's path: (1,1) to (1,2).",

So code gives correct answer.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=3. So both are equal. The code would use the first formula: 2*3 +3-2=6+1=7. Let's see:\n\nStanley's path is from (1,1) to (3,3). The minimal steps would be 4 (2 down, 2 right). But since Megan's portals are available, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, Megan's path is from (3,1) to (1,3). Her path would be moving up twice and right twice. So 4 steps, leaving portals. Then Stanley can take the same path as before, but maybe use a portal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can meet at some portal and teleport.\n\nBut in this case, the code's formula gives 7. Let's see:\n\nStanley's initial steps: (1,1) to (3,1). That's two down steps. Then use portal to teleport to (1,3), which is 1 unit. Then move right to (3,3) is two steps. Wait, total steps: 2 steps (down) +1 (teleport) + 2 steps (right) = 5 units. Megan's path: from (3,1) to (1,3). How many steps?
