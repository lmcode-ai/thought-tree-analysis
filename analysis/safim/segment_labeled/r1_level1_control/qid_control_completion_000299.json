The score is the number of prefixes that sum to zero. And the operations allowed are changing any existing zero in the array to an arbitrary value. Hmm, looking at the existing code. The solve function reads the array and computes the prefix sums. Then there's a map p that's being used in a loop from n down to 1. The code checks if a[i] is zero and does something. The missing part is in the for loop where mx is being calculated by iterating through something. Oh right, the comment says \"Your code here\" for the loop. The idea here seems to be that when we encounter a zero in the original array, we can change it to any value. The current code is processing the array from the end.",
