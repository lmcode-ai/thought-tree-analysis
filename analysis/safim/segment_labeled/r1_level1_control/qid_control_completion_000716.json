The divisions are structured as follows:\n- Division 1: rating >= 1900\n- Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n- Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n- Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nSo, after checking if the rating is >=1900 (Division 1), the next check should be for Division 2. That division is when the rating is between 1600 and 1899 inclusive. So the condition should be whether the rating is >=1600 and <=1899. But since we're using elif statements in order, once we get past the first condition (Division 1), the next elif is for Division 2. The remaining conditions are checked only if the previous ones are false. Wait, the current code has after the first if condition, an elif (which I need to fill), then an elif checking >=1400 (Division 3), else Division 4.
