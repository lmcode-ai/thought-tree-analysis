Wait, the allowed swaps are \"ab\" to \"ba\" (so swapping a and b, which allows the 'a' to move to the right? Or the 'b' to the left?) Wait, when you have \"ab\", you can swap to \"ba\". So the 'a' moves left, or the 'b' moves right? No, the swap is between adjacent a and b. For example, if you have \"ab\", you can change it to \"ba\". So this allows the 'b' to move to the left, past the 'a'. Because if the 'b' is after an 'a', you can swap them, moving the 'b' left once. Similarly, a \"bc\" can be swapped to \"cb\", allowing the 'c' to move left past the 'b'.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: the allowed swaps are \"ab\" \u2192 \"ba\" (so swapping a and b, so a is followed by b becomes b followed by a). So the 'a' is moving to the right, and the 'b' to the left? Or maybe the other way. Wait, the original is \"ab\". When swapped to \"ba\", the 'a' is now after the 'b'. So the 'b' moves left by one position.

So a 'b' can be moved left past 'a's, and 'c's can be moved left past 'b's. But 'a's can't be moved past 'c's, etc.\n\nSo the allowed transformations are such that 'b's can be rearranged relative to 'a's and 'c's. But the order between 'a's and 'c's can't be changed. For example, if you have 'ac', you can't swap them because the allowed swaps are only 'ab' and 'bc'.\n\nThis implies that in the transformed string, the relative order of non-'b' characters (a and c) must be the same in both s and t.

For each 'a' in the processed s (which is the same as t), it checks if the position in s (v1[i]) is <= the position in t (v2[i]). Because 'a's can only move to the left via the allowed swaps. Wait, wait. Let's think again.\n\nWhen you have 'a's in s, how can they move? Let's say in the original string, an 'a' is at position i, and in the target, it's at position j. How can the 'a' get there?\n\nWait, the allowed swap for 'ab' \u2192 'ba' allows the 'b' to move left past the 'a'. But the 'a' itself can only move to the right if there's a 'b' to its right. For example, if you have 'ab', swapping to 'ba' moves the 'a' to the right. Wait, no. Original 'ab' becomes 'ba'. So the 'a' is now in position i+1, and the 'b' in position i. So the 'a' moves to the right by one. So 'a's can move to the right if they are followed by a 'b'. So through a series of swaps, an 'a' can move right past multiple 'b's, but not past any 'c's. Because 'ab' can be swapped, but 'ac' cannot.\n\nWait, for example, if you have 'aab', you can swap the 'ab' in positions 2 and 3 to get 'aba'. Then swap the 'ab' in positions 1 and 2 to get 'baa'. So the 'a's can move right as long as there are 'b's to their right. So the 'a's can end up in positions that are to the right of their original positions, but only if there are 'b's to allow their movement.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the example above, the 'a's are moving to the left. Wait, original 'aab' is positions 1:a, 2:a, 3:b. Then swapping 3 and 2 would give 'aba' (positions 3 and 2 are 'b' and 'a' now). Then swapping positions 1 and 2 (a and b) gives 'baa'. So the first 'a' (position 1) moves to position 2, then the 'b' moves to position 1. So 'a's can move right through the 'b's. Or wait, perhaps 'a's can only move right when there's a 'b' to their right. So each swap allows the 'a' to move one position to the right. So the 'a's can only move right if there are 'b's to the right of them.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the allowed moves are swapping 'ab' to 'ba' (so 'a' followed by 'b' can be swapped, allowing the 'a' to move right by one). But the 'a's can't move past 'c's. So the relative order of 'a's and 'c's must be the same in both s and t. So the code first checks that the non-'b' sequences are the same. That's why the code builds s and t by removing 'b's and checks if they are equal.\n\nNow, after that, for the 'a's in the processed s and t (which are the same), the code checks for each 'a' in s whether the original position (v1[i]) is <= the target position (v2[i]). Because if in the original s, the 'a' is at position X, and in the target t it's at position Y, then Y must be >= X. Because the 'a' can only move to the right (since each swap allows it to move right by one when followed by a 'b'). Wait, wait. Let's think: an 'a' can move to the right by swapping with a 'b' that is to its right. So for each 'a' in s, in order to reach the target position in t, the target position must be >= the original position. Because the 'a's can only move to the right. So if in the original string, the 'a' is at position 5, but in the target it's at position 3, then it's impossible. Because the 'a' can't move left. So the code checks that for each 'a' in the processed s, v1[i] <= v2[i]. That is, the original position is <= target position.\n\nSimilarly, for 'c's. The allowed move is 'bc' \u2192 'cb', which allows the 'c' to swap with a 'b' to its left. So each swap moves the 'c' to the left by one. So the 'c's can only move to the left. So for a 'c' in the original s, the target position must be <= original position. So in the code, when s[i] is 'c', the code checks if v1[i] >= v2[i]. Because the 'c' can only move left, so the target position (v2[i]) must be <= v1[i].\n\nSo that's why the code has those two conditions in the for loop over the indices of v1. If any 'a' in the original is at a position after the target, or any 'c' is at a position before the target, then it's impossible.\n\nNow, the missing code is the condition in the first if statement inside the for loop where the code is building the s string and v1 vector. The code adds characters to s and v1 when the character in c (original s) is not a 'b'. Similarly for t, it's adding characters when ch[i] is not 'b'. So the missing condition is checking if the current character in the original s (c[i]) is not 'b'. So the code is building s as the original s with 'b's removed, and t as the target with 'b's removed. Then it checks if those two are equal.\n\nSo the missing condition is c[i] != 'b'. So the code for the first if statement is checking if the current character is not 'b', and in that case, appending it to s and recording the position in v1.\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nif(c[i] != 'b') s += c[i], v1.push_back(i);\n\nBecause the code is processing each character in the original s (c), and for those that are not 'b', adds them to the s string (with 'b's removed) and records their original positions.\n\nSo the missing code is c[i] != 'b'."
