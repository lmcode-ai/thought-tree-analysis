Because any obstacle in the column will block the stones above. So the else if condition should be checking if the current cell is an obstacle. \n\nSo the missing code in the else if is m[r][c] == 'o'.\n\nSo the line would be:\n\nelse if (m[r][c] == 'o') {\n    emp = r -1;\n}\n\nYes. That makes sense. Because when you hit an obstacle, the next available position for stones is above it. So the emp is set to r-1."
