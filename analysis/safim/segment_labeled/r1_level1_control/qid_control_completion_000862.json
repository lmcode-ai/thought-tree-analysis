      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete the Java code so that it counts the number of pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position. The code provided uses a hash map to count the frequencies of each string, then compares every pair of unique strings. The missing part is the condition in the if statement where they check if two strings differ by exactly one character. So, the main problem is determining when two strings of length 2 differ in exactly one position. Each string is two characters long. Let's think: for two strings s1 and s2, the number of differing positions is 1 if (s1.charAt(0) == s2.charAt(0) and s1.charAt(1) ! = s2.charAt(1)) OR (s1.charAt(0) != s2.charAt(0) and s1.charAt(1) == s2.charAt(1)). So the condition should check whether exactly one of the two characters is different. How to implement that? Let's break it down. For the two strings, say a and b. The first character of a is a0, second a1. Similarly for b, b0 and b1. The number of differing positions is (a0 != b0 ? 1 : 0) + (a1 != b1 ? 1 : 0). We need this sum to be exactly 1. So the condition should check if the sum of the differences is 1. In code, for strings s1 and s2 (which are the j-th and k-th strings in the list), the condition would be:\n\nint diff = 0;\nif (s1.charAt(0) != s2.charAt(0)) diff++;\nif (s1.charAt(1) ! = s2.charAt(1)) diff++;\nif (diff == 1) { ... } But how to translate this into Java code in the if condition? Since in Java, you can't directly compute that in the if condition as a single line, but you can compute it inline.",
