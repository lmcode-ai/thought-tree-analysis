      "text": "Because 1600 is already covered by the previous condition. So for example, if n is 1599, it's less than 1600, so the first two conditions (1900 and 1600) are not met. Then the next condition is for Division 3. So the correct condition here would be n >=1400. Because any number that's not in the higher divisions but is >=1400 would fall into Division 3. Because 1400 <= n <=1599 is covered by checking n >=1400. Wait, but after the previous check for Division 2, which is >=1600, this elif is only checked if the previous conditions are false. So if we reach the third elif, n must be less than 1600. So the condition for Division 3 is n >=1400. Because if n is >=1400 and less than 1600, then it's Division 3. So the correct condition here is n >=1400. So the missing code is: elif n >=1400. Wait, looking at the code structure:\n\nif n >=1900:\n    division 1\nelif n >=1600 and ...:\n    division 2\nelif ...:\n    division 3\nelse:\n    division4\n\nWait, in the elif for division 2, the code checks if n is >=1600 and <1900. But actually, since we have already checked if n >=1900 in the first condition, the elif's n >=1600 part is redundant. Because if the first condition is not true (n <1900), then the elif for division 2 is n >=1600, which would cover 1600 to 1899. So the code could have been written as:\n\nif n >=1900: div1\nelif n >=1600: div2\nelif n >=1400: div3\nelse: div4.\n\nBecause in the elif chain, once a condition is met, the rest are skipped. So for example, if n is 1650, the first condition (>=1900) is false, then check if >=1600. Since yes, it's division2. The next conditions are not checked. So in the original code, the division2 condition is written as n >=1600 and n <1900. But since the first condition already checks for >=1900, the <1900 part is redundant because in the elif chain, that's only evaluated if the first condition (n >=1900) is false. So n can't be >=1900 here. So the division2 condition could have been written as elif n >=1600: print division2. So the code provided has the division2 condition as \"n >=1600 and n <1900\". But that's redundant. The correct way would be to have \"elif n >=1600: ...\" because after the first condition, we know n is less than 1900. So the current code's condition for division2 is correct but redundant. So back to the missing condition. The original code has:\n\nelif # TODO: Your code here\n    print(\"Division\",3)\n\nWe need to fill in the condition here. The division3 is 1400 <= rating <=1599. Since the division2 condition is checking for 1600 <= and <1900 (but after the first check, so actually 1600 <= n <=1899?), but the code's division2 condition is written as n >=1600 and n <1900. So for division3, after division2, we need to check if the rating is >=1400 and <1600. But how?\n\nIn the current code structure, the division3 condition comes after division2. So for example, if n is 1500: division1's condition is false, division2's condition (1600 <=1500) is false. So then check the division3 condition. So the condition for division3 should be n >=1400. Because any number that is >=1400 and less than 1600 will satisfy this. Because if it's >=1600, division2's condition would have caught it. So the code's missing condition for division3 is n >=1400. So the elif line should be: elif n >=1400:. So the missing code is elif n >=1400:. Testing some examples:\n\nTest case 5: 1400. The division2 condition is 1600 <=1400? No. So check division3's condition (1400 >=1400: yes). So it's division3. Correct. Test case 3:1300. Then division3's condition is false. So falls into else (division4). Which is correct. Another example: 1599. division3's condition is true (>=1400). So printed as division3. Correct. Another example: 1399. division3's condition is false, so else (division4). Correct. So the correct code for the missing elif condition is: elif n >=1400:.",
