So that's okay.\n\nWait, no. For example, if k=2, b=3, s=5. Then k*b=6>5. So the initial condition would output -1. But if s=6, then k*b=6, so s/k is 3, which equals b. So the code would output the array. But if s=7, then s/k is 3.5, which is greater than b. So in that case, the sum of floors can be up to 3.5 (but since sum is integer, up to 3). Wait, no. Wait, sum of floors can't exceed s/k. For example, if s=7, k=2: sum of a_i is 7. The maximum sum of floors is 3 (if a_i is 7, then 7/2=3.5, floor is 3). So in this case, sum of floors can't exceed 3.

So code proceeds to the else part.\n\nBut the required sum of floors is b=3, which is possible. So the code's approach is correct here.\n\nSo the code's structure is:\n\nIf k*b >s: impossible.\n\nElse:\n\nIf s/k equals b: then we can make all elements zero except one which is s. Because each element divided by k gives 0 except the last one, which is s/k. So sum is s/k, which equals b. So that's correct.\n\nElse, when s/k >b: Then we need to distribute the excess (s -k*b) in a way that the sum of floors does not exceed b, but wait, the sum must be exactly b.\n\nWait, the sum of floors is exactly b. But how?\n\nHmm, this is where the problem's approach comes in.\n\nThe minimal sum of a_i is k*b (when each a_i is exactly k*b_i). But the problem allows a_i to be larger than that, but the sum of their floors must still be b. So the excess (s -k*b) must be distributed in such a way that when divided by k, they contribute zero to the sum.\n\nSo each a_i can be at most (k*b_i + (k-1)). Because floor((k*b_i + (k-1))/k) is b_i. Any more than that (like k*b_i +k) would add 1 to the floor.\n\nSo, the excess s -k*b must be split into parts, each of which is at most (k-1). Because if any part is >=k, then when added to a_i, it would increase the floor by 1. So the maximum allowed excess per element is (k-1). So the total excess is (s -k*b) must be <= (n-1)*(k-1). Because we can assign all the excess to n-1 elements, each with (k-1), and the last element is k*b plus the remaining excess. Wait, no. Because the last element is part of the sum. Wait, in the code's approach, when we have (s -k*b) = remain.\n\nThe code is doing:\n\nIn the else part:\n\nremain = s -k*b.\n\nThen, there's a check if some condition is true, which would output -1.\n\nThen, the code proceeds to count how many (k-1) can be subtracted from remain. For example, each (k-1) added to an element (but not the last one). Then, the last element is k*b + last (remaining part after subtracting as many (k-1) as possible).\n\nBut the code's missing condition here. The code checks if the remaining after k*b is valid.\n\nSo, the code has:\n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n    System.out.println(-1);\n    continue;\n}\n\nSo the missing condition here is when the excess (remain) is larger than (n-1)*(k-1). Because each of the first (n-1) elements can take at most (k-1) of the excess. So the maximum allowed excess is (n-1)*(k-1). If the remain exceeds that, then it's impossible.\n\nSo the condition to check is: if (remain > (n-1)*(k-1)), then output -1.\n\nSo in the code, the missing condition is if remain > (n-1)*(k-1).\n\nSo the code's missing line should be:\n\nif (remain > (n-1)*(k-1)) {\n\nBut wait, what if k is 1? Then (k-1) is zero, which would make (n-1)*(k-1) =0. Then, the excess must be zero. But when k=1, the sum of floor(a_i/1) is sum(a_i) = s. So the sum must equal b. But in the code's initial check, if k*b <=s, then when k=1, we have b <=s. But then the sum of floors is s, which must equal b. So in that case, s must be equal to b. But the code's code after the initial check allows for s/k (which is s) to be greater than b. But when k=1, s/k is s, and if that's greater than b, then the code's code would proceed to the else part. But in that case, since k=1, the required sum of floors is s, which must equal b. So in that case, if s/k (s) is greater than b, then it's impossible. But the code's code allows for that case. Wait, but in the code's structure, after checking k*b <=s, when k=1, that's equivalent to b <=s. Then, s/k is s. So if s is greater than b, then the code proceeds to the else part. But then, the code's code would check whether the remain (s -k*b = s -b) is <= (n-1)*(k-1) = (n-1)*0 =0. So if s -b >0, then remain >0. So condition is true, output -1. Which is correct. Because when k=1, sum of floors is s, which must equal b. So in that case, if s !=b, it's impossible. So the code's structure handles that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the missing condition is checking if the remaining excess is more than (n-1)*(k-1). Because each of the first (n-1) elements can take up to (k-1) of the excess. The last element's excess is added to k*b, but since (k*b + last) divided by k is b + (last/k). But last is the remaining after subtracting (count) times (k-1), where count is the number of elements (other than the last) that take (k-1) each. Wait, the code's approach is to take as many (k-1) as possible from the remain, subtracting each (k-1) from remain. For example, each (k-1) is added to some elements (not the last). Then, the remaining after that is added to the last element.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nlong remain = s -k*b;\n\nif (remain > (n-1)*(k-1)) {\n    output -1;\n}\n\nBecause if the remaining excess is more than (n-1)*(k-1), then even if all the first (n-1) elements take (k-1) each, there's still some excess left. But adding that to the last element would make the last element's a_i exceed (k*b + (k-1)), which would cause its floor to be higher than b. So the sum would exceed b, which is not allowed. So the condition to check is whether remain exceeds (n-1)*(k-1). If yes, output -1.\n\nSo the missing condition is:\n\nremain > (n-1)*(k-1)\n\nBut in code, since remain is computed as s -k*b, and in the else block, the code has already checked that s >=k*b (since k*b <=s). So the condition is:\n\nif (remain > (n-1)*(k-1)) {\n\nSo the code's missing line should be:\n\nif (remain > (n-1)*(k-1)) {\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nremain > (n-1)*(k-1)"
