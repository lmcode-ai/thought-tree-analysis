Each block is 1 unit high and the length is ceil(i/2) for the i-th block. So, for example, when i is 1 or 2, the length is 1. For 3 and 4, it's 2, and so on. The sample code currently prints (n+1)/2. But according to the note, when n=5, the answer is 3, but (5+1)/2 is 3, which matches. Let's check another example. For n=6, (6+1)/2 is 3.5, which truncates to 3. But let's think: blocks 1-6 have lengths 1,1,2,2,3,3. The total area contributed by the blocks is sum of (1 +1 +2 +2 +3 +3) = 12. The square area would be s^2. So maximum s where s^2 <= 12. s is 3 (3^2=9), next is 4 (16, too big). So the code's output of 3 is correct here. Wait, but according to the code, for n=6, (6+1)/2 is 3.5, so integer division would give 3. So that's correct. But wait, maybe for n=5, the sum is 1+1+2+2+3 =9. So s=3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct. Hmm, but why is this formula correct? Let's think about the sum of the lengths. Each block contributes 1 unit to the height (since they are 1 high and placed vertically?), wait no.

For n=6, sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3=12. sqrt(12)=3.46, floor is 3. min(6,3) is 3. Which is correct. So the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S)), but only if S >= s^2 and n >= s. But if S >= s^2 and n >= s, then s can be up to floor(sqrt(S)). Wait, but how is the sum S computed for each n? Let's find a formula for S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let's compute this sum. Let's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor i = 1: ceil(1/2) = 1. i=2: 1\ni=3: 2\ni=4: 2\ni=5:3, etc. So for even i (i=2k), ceil(i/2) is k. For odd i (i=2k-1), ceil(i/2) is k. So for n even: n=2m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} (k (for i=2k-1) + k (for i=2k))). So for each pair (2k-1, 2k), their sum is 2k. So for m pairs, the sum is 2*(1+2+...+m) = m(m+1). For n odd: n=2m+1. Then the sum is sum for the first 2m terms (which is m(m+1)) plus the last term, which is m+1. So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Wait, let's check for n=5 (odd). m is (5-1)/2=2. So sum is (2+1)^2 =9, which matches the sample. For n=6 (even), m=3. sum is 3*4=12. Which matches.

Wait, when n is even, it's (n/2) * (n/2 +1). For example, n=2: (2/2)=1. 1*(1+1) =2, which is correct (1+1=2). So, S(n) can be written as (m)*(m + (n is even? 1 : 0)), where m = (n+1)//2. Wait, for even n=2m: sum is m*(m+1). For odd n=2m+1: sum is (m+1)^2. So the total sum is (m^2 + m) when n is even (m = n/2), and (m+1)^2 when n is odd (m = (n-1)/2). Now, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s^2 <= S(n). Because even though the number of blocks is n >= s, the sum S(n) is the maximum possible sum (using all blocks), so s can be up to floor(sqrt(S(n))).",

Because using all blocks, the vertical dimension is n, which is >= s (since s is at most floor(sqrt(S(n))) <= sqrt(S(n)) <= sqrt(n*(something)) ... but maybe n is larger than s. For example, in the case where n=5, S=9, sqrt(9)=3, and n=5 >=3. So s=3 is allowed. But let's see: when n is even. For example, n=4: sum is (4/2)*(4/2+1) = 2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.45. So s=2. But n=4 >=2, so that's allowed. But wait, the code given in the problem is outputting (n+1)/2. For example, when n=5, (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct. For n=4, (4+1)/2=2.5, but since it's integer division (as in Java), it would be 2. Which matches floor(sqrt(6))=2. So for n=4, code outputs 2, which is correct. So when n is even, (n+1)/2 is (2m +1)/2, but since n is even, (n+1)/2 is m + 0.5. Java does integer division, so (n+1)/2 for even n=4 is (5)/2=2.5 \u2192 2. Wait, for n even, (n+1)/2 would be m + 0.5 where m is n/2. So integer division would give m. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 2 as integer. But for n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Which is (n/2) =3, which is correct. Wait, for n even:\n\nsum S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) \u2192 m*(m+1) where m =n/2. So sqrt(S(n)) = sqrt(m(m+1)) \u2192 which is approximately m + 0.5, but less than m+1. So floor of that is m.\n\nSimilarly, for n odd: sum S(n) = (m+1)^2, where m = (n-1)/2. So sqrt(S(n)) is m+1. So s = m+1. So for n even, s = m =n/2. For n odd, s = m+1 = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2. Wait, so combining both cases:\n\nFor any n, s = floor( (n+1)/2 ) ? Wait, for even n:\n\n(n+1)/2 is not an integer. For example, n=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5, floor is 2. Which is equal to m=4/2=2. For n even, s is m =n/2. For n odd, s is (n+1)/2. So the formula for s is floor( (n+1)/2 ) ? Wait, let's see:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 floor is 3. Which is m=6/2=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=3 \u2192 (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 floor 2. Sum S(3) is 1+1+2=4. sqrt(4)=2. So s=2, which matches.\n\nn=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 yes. Sum is 1, s=1.\n\nn=2 \u2192 (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(2) ~1.414. So s=1. Which is correct. Wait, but for n=2, the sum is 2. So s^2 <=2. The maximum s is 1. But according to the code, (n+1)/2 for n=2 is 1.5, integer division gives 1. So code is correct. So the formula is that the maximum s is floor( (n+1)/2 ), but wait, that's not the case. Wait, for n even:\n\nsum S(n) = m*(m+1) where m =n/2. So s is floor( sqrt(m(m+1)) ). For m=2 (n=4), m(m+1) = 6, sqrt is ~2.449, floor 2. Which is m. For m=3 (n=6), 3*4=12, sqrt is ~3.464, floor 3. Which is m. So for even n, s=m= n/2. Which is (n)/2. But (n+1)/2 for even n is (even+1)/2, which is a half-integer. So floor((n+1)/2) = n/2. So yes. For n even: s = n/2. For n odd: s = (n+1)/2. So in code, s = (n +1)/2, using integer division. Because when n is even, (n+1)/2 is (even+1)/2, which is (2m +1)/2 = m + 0.5. But in Java, integer division truncates, so (n+1)/2 is m. For example, (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 2 as integer. Which is correct. When n is odd, (n+1)/2 is (2m+1 +1)/2 = (2m+2)/2= m+1. So yes. So the code's current approach of outputting (n+1)/2 (integer division) is correct. But wait, wait: for even n=6, the sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, floor is 3. Which is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3 in integer division. So yes, correct. But why does this formula work?",

For example, m=3: 3*4=12, sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. So the maximum s is m for even n, and m+1 for odd n. Which is exactly (n+1)/2 using integer division. So the code is correct.

Because the original code has:\n\nwhile (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n    int n = in.nextInt();\n    System.out.println((n+1)/2);\n}\n\nSo the missing part is the loop condition. The loop should run t times, once for each test case. The original code has t read as in.nextInt(), then the loop needs to run t times. In Java, the loop should be written as:\n\nwhile (t-- > 0) {\n\n} So the missing code is (t-- > 0). So the correct code for the while loop is to check that t is decremented each time and runs until it's zero. So the answer is to replace the TODO line with (t-- > 0).

For n=6, (6+1)/2 is 3.5, which truncates to 3. But let's think: blocks 1-6 have lengths 1,1,2,2,3,3. The total area contributed by the blocks is sum of (1 +1 +2 +2 +3 +3) = 12. The square area would be s^2. So maximum s where s^2 <= 12. s is 3 (3^2=9), next is 4 (16, too big). So the code's output of 3 is correct here.

Correct.\n\nHmm, but why is this formula correct? Let's think about the sum of the lengths. Each block contributes 1 unit to the height (since they are 1 high and placed vertically?), wait no. Wait, the blocks are arranged to form a square. Each block is 1 unit high and a certain length. So when placed vertically, they contribute 1 unit to the height, and their length adds to the width. But perhaps the problem is that the blocks can be arranged in any way as long as the total area covers a square. Wait, no. The problem says that the square is created by placing the blocks without rotating. So each block is 1 unit high and some length. So when you arrange them horizontally, each block contributes 1 unit in height and its length in width. But the square's height is determined by the number of blocks stacked vertically. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the square's side length is determined by the area. The total area of the blocks used must be at least s^2. But since each block is 1 unit high, the sum of their lengths (when arranged in a single row) would be the total area. Wait, no. If I place a block vertically, then it contributes 1xL, where L is the length. But if you arrange them horizontally, perhaps stacking them in layers. For example, each layer in the square must be exactly s units in height. Wait, perhaps the actual approach is to compute the maximum s such that the sum of all the block lengths is >= s^2. Because each block contributes 1 unit in height (so the vertical dimension is the number of blocks used, but arranged in layers of height 1 each), but the horizontal dimension is the sum of their lengths. So to form a square of side s, you need sum of lengths >= s (for the horizontal) and the number of blocks used >= s (for the vertical). So the maximum s is the minimum of (sum of lengths of selected blocks) and (number of blocks used). Wait, but the sum of the lengths would have to be >= s, and the number of blocks used (since each contributes 1 to the vertical) must be >= s. So the maximum s is the largest integer where s <= sum_lengths and s <= number_blocks_used. But since we can choose any subset of blocks, the optimal is to maximize the minimum between the sum of the lengths of the chosen blocks and the count of the blocks chosen.\n\nBut this seems complex. So perhaps the maximum possible s is the largest s where s^2 <= total_sum (sum of lengths of all blocks). Because even if you select a subset where the sum is >= s and the count is >= s, but the sum of all possible blocks might be higher. Wait, but maybe the sum of all possible blocks gives the maximum possible sum, but how to find the maximum s where s^2 <= sum. Because if sum is the total sum of all blocks, then s can be up to sqrt(sum), but s can't exceed the number of blocks, since each block contributes at least 1 to the vertical direction (since each is 1 unit high). Wait, no. Wait, if you have s blocks arranged vertically, each contributing 1 to the vertical, then the vertical dimension is s. The horizontal dimension is the sum of the lengths of those s blocks. So to form a square, you need sum_lengths >= s and vertical >= s, which implies that sum_lengths >= s and s <= vertical (number of blocks used). So the maximum s is the minimum between the sum of the lengths and the number of blocks used. But to maximize s, we need to choose a subset of blocks where the sum of their lengths is >= s, and the count is >= s. The maximum possible s is the largest such s.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible s is the largest integer s such that the sum of the s largest lengths (in terms of the sum) is >= s, and we can choose s blocks. But this may not hold. Alternatively, the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n, and then find s where s^2 <= total_sum. Because using all blocks, the vertical dimension is the number of blocks, which is n. So the sum of all lengths is S, and the maximum s is the minimum of (n, floor(sqrt(S))). But wait, S is the sum of all lengths. For example, in the first example given, n=5, the sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. So sqrt(9)=3. And n=5, so min(5,3) is 3, which matches the sample. For n=6, sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3=12. sqrt(12)=3.46, floor is 3. min(6,3) is 3. Which is correct. So the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S)), but only if S >= s^2 and n >= s. But if S >= s^2 and n >= s, then s can be up to floor(sqrt(S)).\n\nWait, but how is the sum S computed for each n? Let's find a formula for S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet's compute this sum. Let's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor i = 1: ceil(1/2) = 1.\ni=2: 1\ni=3: 2\ni=4: 2\ni=5:3, etc.\n\nSo for even i (i=2k), ceil(i/2) is k.\nFor odd i (i=2k-1), ceil(i/2) is k.\n\nSo for n even: n=2m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} (k (for i=2k-1) + k (for i=2k))). So for each pair (2k-1, 2k), their sum is 2k. So for m pairs, the sum is 2*(1+2+...+m) = m(m+1).\n\nFor n odd: n=2m+1. Then the sum is sum for the first 2m terms (which is m(m+1)) plus the last term, which is m+1. So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=5 (odd). m is (5-1)/2=2. So sum is (2+1)^2 =9, which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=6 (even), m=3. sum is 3*4=12. Which matches.\n\nSo the sum S(n) is:\n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nSo S(n) = floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). Or more precisely:\n\nS(n) = ( (n+1)/2 )^2 when n is odd.\n\nWait, when n is even, it's (n/2) * (n/2 +1). For example, n=2: (2/2)=1. 1*(1+1) =2, which is correct (1+1=2).\n\nSo, S(n) can be written as (m)*(m + (n is even? 1 : 0)), where m = (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, for even n=2m: sum is m*(m+1).\n\nFor odd n=2m+1: sum is (m+1)^2.\n\nSo the total sum is (m^2 + m) when n is even (m = n/2), and (m+1)^2 when n is odd (m = (n-1)/2).\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s^2 <= S(n). Because even though the number of blocks is n >= s, the sum S(n) is the maximum possible sum (using all blocks), so s can be up to floor(sqrt(S(n))).\n\nWait, but the sum S(n) is the sum of all blocks, which is the maximum possible sum. So the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))). Because using all blocks, the vertical dimension is n, which is >= s (since s is at most floor(sqrt(S(n))) <= sqrt(S(n)) <= sqrt(n*(something)) ... but maybe n is larger than s. For example, in the case where n=5, S=9, sqrt(9)=3, and n=5 >=3. So s=3 is allowed.\n\nBut let's see: when n is even. For example, n=4: sum is (4/2)*(4/2+1) = 2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.45. So s=2. But n=4 >=2, so that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, the code given in the problem is outputting (n+1)/2. For example, when n=5, (5+1)/2=3. Which is correct. For n=4, (4+1)/2=2.5, but since it's integer division (as in Java), it would be 2. Which matches floor(sqrt(6))=2. So for n=4, code outputs 2, which is correct.\n\nSo when n is even, (n+1)/2 is (2m +1)/2, but since n is even, (n+1)/2 is m + 0.5. Java does integer division, so (n+1)/2 for even n=4 is (5)/2=2.5 \u2192 2.\n\nWait, for n even, (n+1)/2 would be m + 0.5 where m is n/2. So integer division would give m. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 2 as integer. But for n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. Which is (n/2) =3, which is correct.\n\nWait, for n even:\n\nsum S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) \u2192 m*(m+1) where m =n/2.\n\nSo sqrt(S(n)) = sqrt(m(m+1)) \u2192 which is approximately m + 0.5, but less than m+1. So floor of that is m.\n\nSimilarly, for n odd: sum S(n) = (m+1)^2, where m = (n-1)/2. So sqrt(S(n)) is m+1. So s = m+1.\n\nSo for n even, s = m =n/2.\n\nFor n odd, s = m+1 = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, so combining both cases:\n\nFor any n, s = floor( (n+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, for even n:\n\n(n+1)/2 is not an integer. For example, n=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5, floor is 2. Which is equal to m=4/2=2.\n\nFor n even, s is m =n/2.\n\nFor n odd, s is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the formula for s is floor( (n+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=6 \u2192 (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 floor is 3. Which is m=6/2=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=3 \u2192 (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 floor 2. Sum S(3) is 1+1+2=4. sqrt(4)=2. So s=2, which matches.\n\nn=1 \u2192 (1+1)/2=1 \u2192 yes. Sum is 1, s=1.\n\nn=2 \u2192 (2+1)/2=1.5 \u2192 floor 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(2) ~1.414. So s=1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but for n=2, the sum is 2. So s^2 <=2. The maximum s is 1. But according to the code, (n+1)/2 for n=2 is 1.5, integer division gives 1. So code is correct.\n\nSo the formula is that the maximum s is floor( (n+1)/2 ), but wait, that's not the case. Wait, for n even:\n\nsum S(n) = m*(m+1) where m =n/2. So s is floor( sqrt(m(m+1)) ). For m=2 (n=4), m(m+1) = 6, sqrt is ~2.449, floor 2. Which is m. For m=3 (n=6), 3*4=12, sqrt is ~3.464, floor 3. Which is m. So for even n, s=m= n/2. Which is (n)/2. But (n+1)/2 for even n is (even+1)/2, which is a half-integer. So floor((n+1)/2) = n/2. So yes.\n\nFor n even: s = n/2.\n\nFor n odd: s = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo in code, s = (n +1)/2, using integer division. Because when n is even, (n+1)/2 is (even+1)/2, which is (2m +1)/2 = m + 0.5. But in Java, integer division truncates, so (n+1)/2 is m. For example, (4+1)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 2 as integer. Which is correct.\n\nWhen n is odd, (n+1)/2 is (2m+1 +1)/2 = (2m+2)/2= m+1. So yes.\n\nSo the code's current approach of outputting (n+1)/2 (integer division) is correct. But wait, wait: for even n=6, the sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, floor is 3. Which is (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3 in integer division. So yes, correct.\n\nBut why does this formula work? Because for even n, the sum is m*(m+1), and the floor of sqrt(m*(m+1)) is m. Because m^2 < m(m+1) < (m+1)^2. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor is m.\n\nFor example, m=3: 3*4=12, sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3.\n\nSo the maximum s is m for even n, and m+1 for odd n. Which is exactly (n+1)/2 using integer division.\n\nSo the code is correct. So why does the code in the problem statement have a comment \"TODO: Your code here\" in the while loop? Because the original code has:\n\nwhile (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n    int n = in.nextInt();\n    System.out.println((n+1)/2);\n}\n\nSo the missing part is the loop condition. The loop should run t times, once for each test case.\n\nThe original code has t read as in.nextInt(), then the loop needs to run t times.\n\nIn Java, the loop should be written as:\n\nwhile (t-- > 0) {\n\n}\n\nSo the missing code is (t-- > 0).\n\nSo the correct code for the while loop is to check that t is decremented each time and runs until it's zero.\n\nSo the answer is to replace the TODO line with (t-- > 0).\n\nSo the correct missing code is: t-- > 0"
