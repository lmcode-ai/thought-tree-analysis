So first, we need to compute the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n. Then find the largest s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. So the problem reduces to two steps:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks. 2. Find the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. But how to compute the sum efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e9? We need a formula for the sum. Let's think about the length of each block. For block i, the length is ceil(i/2). Let's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor i even: ceil(i/2) = i/2. For i odd: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. So for i from 1 to n:\n\nsum = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2)\n\nLet's compute this sum. Let's split into two cases based on whether n is even or odd. Case 1: n is even. n = 2k. Then the sum is sum from i=1 to 2k of ceil(i/2). For i=1: ceil(1/2)=1\ni=2: 1\ni=3: 2\ni=4: 2\n...\ni=2k-1: k\ni=2k: k\n\nSo for even i, each pair (2m-1, 2m) contributes m + m = 2m. The sum is 1+1 + 2+2 + ... + k +k = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). But wait, since n is 2k, k = n/2. So sum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1). Case 2: n is odd. n = 2k +1. Sum is sum up to 2k, which is k(k+1) as before, plus the next term ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So sum = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2. But k is (n-1)/2 when n is odd. So substituting, sum = ((n-1)/2 +1)^2 = ((n+1)/2)^2. Wait, let's verify with small numbers. For example, n=5 (odd). Then k = (5-1)/2 = 2. Sum is (2+1)^2 = 9. Let's compute manually:\n\ni=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2, i=5:3. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. Yes. Another example, n=3 (odd). k=1. Sum is (1+1)^2=4. Let's see: i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2. Sum 1+1+2=4. Correct. For even n=4 (k=2). Sum is 2*(2+1) =6. i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2. Sum 1+1+2+2=6. Correct. So the formula for sum is:\n\nif n is even: sum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) if n is odd: sum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, we can write this in a unified way. Let's see:\n\nLet m = floor((n+1)/2). Wait, for even n=2k, (n+1)/2 = k+0.5, so floor is k. For odd n=2k+1, (n+1)/2 =k+1, floor is k+1. Wait, perhaps it's better to express sum as m*(m + (n is even ? 0 : 1)). Wait, maybe not. Let's compute for even and odd: For even n=2k: sum = k*(k+1)\nFor odd n=2k+1: sum = (k+1)^2\n\nAlternatively, sum can be written as:\n\nsum = (ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n % 2 ==0 ? 0 : 1 )) ) Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. Wait, for n=5 (odd), ceil(n/2) is 3. So (3)^2 =9, which is correct. For n=4 (even), ceil(4/2) is 2. 2*(2+1) =6, which matches. So another way: the sum is ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n is even ? 1 : 0 )) ? Wait, no. Wait for even n, sum is (n/2) * (n/2 +1). Which is k*(k+1), where k =n/2. But ceil(n/2) is k, since n is even. So for even n, sum is k*(k+1) = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) +1) ? Yes. Because ceil(n/2) is n/2 when even. But for odd n, sum is (ceil(n/2))^2. Because for n=5, ceil(5/2)=3, sum is 3^2=9. So sum when n is odd is (ceil(n/2))^2. So sum can be written as:\n\nsum = (m) * (m + (n is even ? 1 : 0) ) where m = ceil(n/2)\n\nWait, let's see for even n=4, m=2. sum=2*(2+1) =6. Correct. For odd n=5, m=3. sum=3*3=9. Correct. So yes. So sum can be calculated as m * (m + (n even ? 1 :0)). But how to compute m?\n\nm is (n +1)//2, because ceil(n/2) is equal to (n+1) divided by 2, integer division. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5, integer division (floor) gives 2. Wait, but ceil(4/2)=2. Wait, no. For n even, ceil(n/2) is exactly n/2, which is integer. For n odd, ceil(n/2) is (n+1)/2. So m = (n +1) // 2. Yes, because (n +1) divided by 2 using integer division (which truncates towards zero) gives the correct m. So m = (n +1) // 2. Once we have m, then sum is:\n\nif n is even, sum = m * (m +1)\n\nif n is odd, sum = m * m\n\nWait, no. Wait for even n=2k: m=(2k+1)//2= k. So sum is k*(k+1) which is correct. For odd n=2k+1: m=(2k+2)//2= k+1. So sum is (k+1)^2. Yes. So sum can be written as:\n\nsum = m * (m - (n % 2)) ) Wait, let's check. For even n: n%2=0. So sum = m*(m -0) = m*m. But wait, for even n, sum is m*(m+1). So this doesn't work. Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's see:\n\nsum = m^2 + (n even ? m : 0 ) Because for even n, sum is m*(m+1) = m^2 + m. For odd n, sum is m^2. Wait, yes. So sum = m^2 + (if n is even then m else 0). Because when n is even, m is (n/2), and sum is m*(m+1) = m^2 +m.\n\nWhen n is odd, sum is m^2. So sum can be written as m^2 + (n even ? m : 0). So how to compute that. So m = (n+1)/2 (integer division). sum = m*m + (n %2 ==0 ? m : 0) Yes. So that's the formula. Once we have the sum, the next step is to find the maximum s where s^2 <= sum. So s is the floor of the square root of sum.",

So the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute sum as per the formula above, then compute s = floor(sqrt(sum)). So for example, in the sample input where n=5:\n\nsum is (5+1)/2 =3, sum=3^2=9. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3. Another sample input: n=6. sum: (6+1)/2 =3 (since (6+1)=7, divided by 2 is 3.5, integer division gives 3). But wait, wait, no. Wait for n=6, which is even. Wait, m=(6+1)//2=3.5? No, in Java, integer division is towards zero. So (6+1)=7 divided by 2 is 3 (since 7/2=3.5, truncated to 3). So m=3. Then sum is 3^2 + (6 even, so add 3). Sum=9+3=12. Then sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so s=3. But wait, in that case, the maximum square would be 3x3=9, but sum is 12. So maybe the sample for n=5 is correct. Wait, but for n=6, sum is 12. So s is 3, since 3^2=9 \u226412, 4^2=16>12. So yes, s=3. So now, the steps are: For each test case:\n\n1. Compute m = (n+1)/2 (integer division). 2. Compute sum = m*m + (if n is even, add m, else 0). 3. Compute s = floor(sqrt(sum)). So how to compute this efficiently, especially for very large n (up to 1e9)? In code, we can compute m as (n+1)/2. Then compute sum as m*m plus (n %2 ==0 ? m : 0). Then compute s as the integer part of the square root of sum. But how to compute the square root of sum when sum can be up to (1e9+1)/2 squared plus m when even. Let's compute maximum possible sum. For n=1e9, which is even. m = (1e9 +1)/2 = 500,000,000.5 but integer division (n is 1e9, even. (n+1)/2 is 500,000,000.5, but in Java (n+1) is 1e9+1, divided by 2 is 500,000,000 when even? Wait n is even. Let's see:\n\nWait, n=1e9 is even. So (n+1) is 1e9+1. Divided by 2, integer division in Java is (1e9+1)/2 =500,000,000 (since 1e9+1 is 1,000,000,001, divided by 2 gives 500,000,000.5, which truncates to 500,000,000. So sum is m*m + m. For m=5e8, sum is (5e8)^2 +5e8 = 25e16 +5e8. The square root of this is approximately 5e8 + (5e8/(2*5e8)) )?",

But according to the actual problem's sample input, for n=5, the correct answer is 3. But what about other cases? Wait, the code in the problem is not correct. For example, when n=6, according to the code's approach, the answer would be 3, but according to the correct approach:\n\nsum = m^2 + m. m= (6+1)/2=3.5 in Java? Wait no: (6+1) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5, but integer division in Java truncates towards zero, so (7)/2 is 3. So sum is 3^2 +3=9+3=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, floor is 3. So code's answer is 3, which matches. But wait, what about n=3. The correct sum is 4 (1+1+2=4). s is 2. So code's current approach for n=3 would compute ceil(3/2)=2, which is correct. Another example: n=7. sum is m= (7+1)/2=4. sum=4^2=16. sqrt(16)=4. So code's approach would take ceil(7/2)=4. Which is correct. Wait a minute, in the code's current approach, they are using ans = ceil(n/2). Which seems to match the correct answer in these examples. But why?\n\nWait, for n=5, ceil(n/2)=3. sum is 9. sqrt(9)=3. So ans is 3.\n\nn=6: ceil(6/2)=3. sum is 12, sqrt is 3.464, floor is 3. So ans=3. n=7: ceil(7/2)=4. sum is 16, sqrt=4. ans=4. n=8: ceil(8/2)=4. sum is m^2 + m. m=(8+1)/2=4.5 (Java truncates to 4). sum=4^2 +4=20. sqrt(20)=4.472..., floor is4. So code's approach gives 4, which is correct. Wait, so the code's current approach of ans=ceil(n/2) gives the correct answer for all these cases. But why?\n\nIs there a pattern where the maximum square side s equals ceil(n/2) ? Wait, let's see for n=2:\n\nsum=1+1=2. s=1. ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\nn=1: sum=1. s=1. ceil(1/2)=1. Correct.\n\nn=4: sum=2*(2+1)=6. s=2. ceil(4/2)=2. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum=4. s=2. ceil(3/2)=2. Correct. n=7: sum=16. s=4. ceil(7/2)=4. Correct.\n\nn=8: sum=20. s=4. ceil(8/2)=4. Correct.\n\nn=9: sum= (9+1)/2=5. sum=5^2=25. s=5. ceil(9/2)=5. Correct. So it seems that in all these cases, s equals ceil(n/2). But why?\n\nWhat's the relationship between sum and ceil(n/2)? Let's compute sum:\n\nsum is m^2 + (n even ? m :0), where m=ceil(n/2). But m is exactly ceil(n/2). Because m = (n+1)/2 in integer division. So sum is:\n\nm^2 + (n even ? m :0) = m(m + (n even ? 1 :0)) Now, the square of m is m\u00b2. But when n is even, sum is m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. The square of m is m\u00b2, so sum is m\u00b2 +m.\n\nThe square root of this sum is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m). Since m is an integer.\n\nsqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is less than m + 0.5, because (m +0.5)^2 =m\u00b2 +m +0.25. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) < m +0.5. Therefore, the floor of the sqrt is m-0.5? Wait no. Wait for example, m=3:\n\nsum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464..., floor is 3. But m=3. So floor is 3.\n\nWhich is m. So for even n, sum is m(m+1). The sqrt of sum is sqrt(m(m+1)) which is between m and m+1.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n wooden blocks. Each block's length is the ceiling of i/2, where i is the block's number from 1 to n. The blocks can't be rotated, so their height is 1, and length is as calculated.\n\nHmm. So the approach is to calculate how much total area we can get from these blocks, since the maximum square's area must be the largest s\u00b2 such that s\u00b2 is less than or equal to the total area of all blocks. Then s would be the maximum side length.\n\nWait, right. Because the total area of the blocks is the sum of each block's area. Each block is 1x(length), so the area is length. So the sum of all block lengths gives the total area. Then the maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 \u2264 total_sum.\n\nSo first, we need to compute the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n. Then find the largest s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 sum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two steps:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks.\n2. Find the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum.\n\nBut how to compute the sum efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e9? We need a formula for the sum.\n\nLet's think about the length of each block. For block i, the length is ceil(i/2). Let's split into even and odd i.\n\nFor i even: ceil(i/2) = i/2.\nFor i odd: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2.\n\nSo for i from 1 to n:\n\nsum = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2)\n\nLet's compute this sum. Let's split into two cases based on whether n is even or odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even.\n\nn = 2k.\n\nThen the sum is sum from i=1 to 2k of ceil(i/2).\n\nFor i=1: ceil(1/2)=1\ni=2: 1\ni=3: 2\ni=4: 2\n...\ni=2k-1: k\ni=2k: k\n\nSo for even i, each pair (2m-1, 2m) contributes m + m = 2m. The sum is 1+1 + 2+2 + ... + k +k = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1).\n\nBut wait, since n is 2k, k = n/2. So sum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1).\n\nCase 2: n is odd.\n\nn = 2k +1.\n\nSum is sum up to 2k, which is k(k+1) as before, plus the next term ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1.\n\nSo sum = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2.\n\nBut k is (n-1)/2 when n is odd. So substituting, sum = ((n-1)/2 +1)^2 = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nWait, let's verify with small numbers.\n\nFor example, n=5 (odd). Then k = (5-1)/2 = 2. Sum is (2+1)^2 = 9. Let's compute manually:\n\ni=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2, i=5:3. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. Yes.\n\nAnother example, n=3 (odd). k=1. Sum is (1+1)^2=4. Let's see: i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2. Sum 1+1+2=4. Correct.\n\nFor even n=4 (k=2). Sum is 2*(2+1) =6. i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2. Sum 1+1+2+2=6. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for sum is:\n\nif n is even: sum = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\nif n is odd: sum = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, we can write this in a unified way. Let's see:\n\nLet m = floor((n+1)/2). Wait, for even n=2k, (n+1)/2 = k+0.5, so floor is k. For odd n=2k+1, (n+1)/2 =k+1, floor is k+1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express sum as m*(m + (n is even ? 0 : 1)).\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's compute for even and odd:\n\nFor even n=2k: sum = k*(k+1)\nFor odd n=2k+1: sum = (k+1)^2\n\nAlternatively, sum can be written as:\n\nsum = (ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n % 2 ==0 ? 0 : 1 )) )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think again.\n\nWait, for n=5 (odd), ceil(n/2) is 3. So (3)^2 =9, which is correct.\n\nFor n=4 (even), ceil(4/2) is 2. 2*(2+1) =6, which matches.\n\nSo another way: the sum is ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n is even ? 1 : 0 )) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait for even n, sum is (n/2) * (n/2 +1). Which is k*(k+1), where k =n/2.\n\nBut ceil(n/2) is k, since n is even. So for even n, sum is k*(k+1) = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) +1) ?\n\nYes. Because ceil(n/2) is n/2 when even.\n\nBut for odd n, sum is (ceil(n/2))^2. Because for n=5, ceil(5/2)=3, sum is 3^2=9. So sum when n is odd is (ceil(n/2))^2.\n\nSo sum can be written as:\n\nsum = (m) * (m + (n is even ? 1 : 0) )\n\nwhere m = ceil(n/2)\n\nWait, let's see for even n=4, m=2. sum=2*(2+1) =6. Correct.\n\nFor odd n=5, m=3. sum=3*3=9. Correct.\n\nSo yes. So sum can be calculated as m * (m + (n even ? 1 :0)).\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nm is (n +1)//2, because ceil(n/2) is equal to (n+1) divided by 2, integer division.\n\nFor example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5, integer division (floor) gives 2. Wait, but ceil(4/2)=2.\n\nWait, no. For n even, ceil(n/2) is exactly n/2, which is integer. For n odd, ceil(n/2) is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo m = (n +1) // 2.\n\nYes, because (n +1) divided by 2 using integer division (which truncates towards zero) gives the correct m.\n\nSo m = (n +1) // 2.\n\nOnce we have m, then sum is:\n\nif n is even, sum = m * (m +1)\n\nif n is odd, sum = m * m\n\nWait, no. Wait for even n=2k: m=(2k+1)//2= k. So sum is k*(k+1) which is correct.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1: m=(2k+2)//2= k+1. So sum is (k+1)^2.\n\nYes. So sum can be written as:\n\nsum = m * (m - (n % 2)) )\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nFor even n: n%2=0. So sum = m*(m -0) = m*m. But wait, for even n, sum is m*(m+1). So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let's see:\n\nsum = m^2 + (n even ? m : 0 )\n\nBecause for even n, sum is m*(m+1) = m^2 + m. For odd n, sum is m^2.\n\nWait, yes. So sum = m^2 + (if n is even then m else 0).\n\nBecause when n is even, m is (n/2), and sum is m*(m+1) = m^2 +m.\n\nWhen n is odd, sum is m^2.\n\nSo sum can be written as m^2 + (n even ? m : 0).\n\nSo how to compute that.\n\nSo m = (n+1)/2 (integer division).\n\nsum = m*m + (n %2 ==0 ? m : 0)\n\nYes. So that's the formula.\n\nOnce we have the sum, the next step is to find the maximum s where s^2 <= sum.\n\nSo s is the floor of the square root of sum.\n\nWait, but sum is the total area. So the maximum possible square side is the integer part of the square root of sum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute sum as per the formula above, then compute s = floor(sqrt(sum)).\n\nSo for example, in the sample input where n=5:\n\nsum is (5+1)/2 =3, sum=3^2=9. sqrt(9)=3. So s=3.\n\nAnother sample input: n=6.\n\nsum: (6+1)/2 =3 (since (6+1)=7, divided by 2 is 3.5, integer division gives 3). But wait, wait, no. Wait for n=6, which is even.\n\nWait, m=(6+1)//2=3.5? No, in Java, integer division is towards zero. So (6+1)=7 divided by 2 is 3 (since 7/2=3.5, truncated to 3). So m=3.\n\nThen sum is 3^2 + (6 even, so add 3). Sum=9+3=12. Then sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so s=3.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the maximum square would be 3x3=9, but sum is 12. So maybe the sample for n=5 is correct.\n\nWait, but for n=6, sum is 12. So s is 3, since 3^2=9 \u226412, 4^2=16>12.\n\nSo yes, s=3.\n\nSo now, the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Compute m = (n+1)/2 (integer division).\n\n2. Compute sum = m*m + (if n is even, add m, else 0).\n\n3. Compute s = floor(sqrt(sum)).\n\nSo how to compute this efficiently, especially for very large n (up to 1e9)?\n\nIn code, we can compute m as (n+1)/2. Then compute sum as m*m plus (n %2 ==0 ? m : 0).\n\nThen compute s as the integer part of the square root of sum.\n\nBut how to compute the square root of sum when sum can be up to (1e9+1)/2 squared plus m when even. Let's compute maximum possible sum.\n\nFor n=1e9, which is even. m = (1e9 +1)/2 = 500,000,000.5 but integer division (n is 1e9, even. (n+1)/2 is 500,000,000.5, but in Java (n+1) is 1e9+1, divided by 2 is 500,000,000 when even? Wait n is even. Let's see:\n\nWait, n=1e9 is even. So (n+1) is 1e9+1. Divided by 2, integer division in Java is (1e9+1)/2 =500,000,000 (since 1e9+1 is 1,000,000,001, divided by 2 gives 500,000,000.5, which truncates to 500,000,000.\n\nSo sum is m*m + m. For m=5e8, sum is (5e8)^2 +5e8 = 25e16 +5e8. The square root of this is approximately 5e8 + (5e8/(2*5e8)) )? Not sure, but the sqrt can be computed using Java's Math.sqrt, which can handle doubles up to 1e308, which is way larger than 1e16.\n\nSo the code steps in Java:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nCompute m = (n +1)/2. Since Java does integer division as (n+1) divided by 2, which truncates towards zero.\n\nsum = m * m + (n%2 ==0 ? m : 0);\n\nThen compute s = (long) Math.sqrt(sum).\n\nWait, but Math.sqrt returns a double. Casting to long will truncate, which gives the floor of the square root if sum is a perfect square. So yes.\n\nBut wait, sum could be a perfect square, in which case Math.sqrt would return an integer, and casting to long would be correct. If not, the floor is correct.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted. The original code in the problem is:\n\nThe current code computes ans as the ceiling of x =n/2. Which is incorrect, because the initial code is not considering the sum properly.\n\nSo the original code's logic is wrong. The correct approach is to compute sum as described, then find the floor of sqrt(sum).\n\nSo the code in the Srinath class is incorrect, but the user provided code. The code needs to be fixed.\n\nLooking at the code provided:\n\npublic class Srinath{\n\n    public static void main(String[] Args){\n    \n        long t,i,j,k,n;\n        Scanner input= new Scanner(System.in);\n        t=input.nextLong();\n        while(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n            t--;\n            n=input.nextLong();\n            long ans=0;\n            double x=n;\n            x=x/2;\n            ans=(long) Math.ceil(x);\n            System.out.println(ans);\n        \n        }\n        \n        \n    }\n\n\n}\n\nSo the existing code is taking n, dividing by 2, and taking the ceiling, then outputting that. Which for the sample input where n=5, gives 3 (since 5/2=2.5, ceiling is 3), which matches the sample output. For n=6, 6/2=3, ceiling is 3. But according to the actual problem's sample input, for n=5, the correct answer is 3. But what about other cases?\n\nWait, the code in the problem is not correct. For example, when n=6, according to the code's approach, the answer would be 3, but according to the correct approach:\n\nsum = m^2 + m. m= (6+1)/2=3.5 in Java? Wait no: (6+1) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5, but integer division in Java truncates towards zero, so (7)/2 is 3. So sum is 3^2 +3=9+3=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, floor is 3. So code's answer is 3, which matches.\n\nBut wait, what about n=3. The correct sum is 4 (1+1+2=4). s is 2. So code's current approach for n=3 would compute ceil(3/2)=2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=7. sum is m= (7+1)/2=4. sum=4^2=16. sqrt(16)=4. So code's approach would take ceil(7/2)=4. Which is correct.\n\nWait a minute, in the code's current approach, they are using ans = ceil(n/2). Which seems to match the correct answer in these examples. But why?\n\nWait, for n=5, ceil(n/2)=3. sum is 9. sqrt(9)=3. So ans is 3.\n\nn=6: ceil(6/2)=3. sum is 12, sqrt is 3.464, floor is 3. So ans=3.\n\nn=7: ceil(7/2)=4. sum is 16, sqrt=4. ans=4.\n\nn=8: ceil(8/2)=4. sum is m^2 + m. m=(8+1)/2=4.5 (Java truncates to 4). sum=4^2 +4=20. sqrt(20)=4.472..., floor is4. So code's approach gives 4, which is correct.\n\nWait, so the code's current approach of ans=ceil(n/2) gives the correct answer for all these cases. But why?\n\nIs there a pattern where the maximum square side s equals ceil(n/2) ?\n\nWait, let's see for n=2:\n\nsum=1+1=2. s=1. ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\nn=1: sum=1. s=1. ceil(1/2)=1. Correct.\n\nn=4: sum=2*(2+1)=6. s=2. ceil(4/2)=2. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum=4. s=2. ceil(3/2)=2. Correct.\n\nn=7: sum=16. s=4. ceil(7/2)=4. Correct.\n\nn=8: sum=20. s=4. ceil(8/2)=4. Correct.\n\nn=9: sum= (9+1)/2=5. sum=5^2=25. s=5. ceil(9/2)=5. Correct.\n\nSo it seems that in all these cases, s equals ceil(n/2). But why?\n\nWhat's the relationship between sum and ceil(n/2)?\n\nLet's compute sum:\n\nsum is m^2 + (n even ? m :0), where m=ceil(n/2).\n\nBut m is exactly ceil(n/2). Because m = (n+1)/2 in integer division.\n\nSo sum is:\n\nm^2 + (n even ? m :0) = m(m + (n even ? 1 :0))\n\nNow, the square of m is m\u00b2.\n\nBut when n is even, sum is m(m+1) = m\u00b2 +m. The square of m is m\u00b2, so sum is m\u00b2 +m.\n\nThe square root of this sum is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m). Since m is an integer.\n\nsqrt(m\u00b2 +m) is less than m + 0.5, because (m +0.5)^2 =m\u00b2 +m +0.25. So sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) < m +0.5.\n\nTherefore, the floor of the sqrt is m-0.5? Wait no.\n\nWait for example, m=3:\n\nsum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464..., floor is 3.\n\nBut m=3. So floor is 3.\n\nWhich is m.\n\nSo for even n, sum is m(m+1). The sqrt of sum is sqrt(m(m+1)) which is between m and m+1. The floor is m.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n: sum is m\u00b2. The sqrt is m, so floor is m.\n\nSo in all cases, s is m.\n\nWait, m is ceil(n/2). So s is m.\n\nTherefore, the maximum square side length is exactly ceil(n/2).\n\nWait, this is surprising. So the code in the problem is correct, but why?\n\nBecause in all cases, the sum is m(m + (even ? 1 :0)), and the sqrt of that sum is m when even (since sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1, floor is m) and m when odd (sum is m\u00b2, sqrt is m).\n\nSo the maximum s is m.\n\nBut m is ceil(n/2).\n\nSo the code's current approach, which outputs ceil(n/2), is correct.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet me test for n=6.\n\nceil(6/2)=3. sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464..., floor is3. So s=3, which equals m.\n\nFor n=7, m=4. sum=16. sqrt is4. So s=4.\n\nYes, so s is m.\n\nSo the code's current approach of outputting ceil(n/2) is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, it's written as:\n\ndouble x =n;\n\nx=x/2;\n\nans=(long) Math.ceil(x);\n\nWhich is exactly ceil(n/2). So the code is correct.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample input where n=5, the answer is 3. Which matches.\n\nAnother sample input: when n=6, the answer is 3. Which matches.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, for the second test case (probably n=5), the answer is 3. Which the code outputs.\n\nSo why the original code is not correct?\n\nWait, perhaps there is a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the code given is missing the loop condition. The code has:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n    t--;\n    n=input.nextLong();\n    ...\n}\n\nSo the loop is supposed to run t times, but the condition is missing. So the missing code is the loop condition. The correct loop condition would be (t-- >0), or (t>0) and decrement inside.\n\nBut the user has to fill in the loop condition.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code given has missing lines or blocks. The user needs to output the missing code. The rest is correct.\n\nSo the problem's code is missing the loop condition. The rest is correct.\n\nBut the original code's approach, after filling in the loop condition, would output ceil(n/2). But according to the previous analysis, this is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=2. The sum is 1+1=2. s is1. Which is ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum 4. s=2. ceil(3/2)=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: sum 2*3=6. s=2. Correct.\n\nn=5: sum 9. s=3. Correct.\n\nBut what about n=8.\n\nsum=4*5=20. sqrt(20)=4.47. floor 4. Which is m=4. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct. The code's logic is correct. The original code is correct except for the loop condition.\n\nSo the missing code is the loop condition. Which should be (t-- >0), or something similar.\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the loop condition as t > 0.\n\nWait, in the code, t is a long, and the loop is written as while( ... ), then inside the loop, t--; So the loop should run t times. The standard way to write this is while (t-- >0).\n\nBut in the code, the loop is written as:\n\nwhile( ... ) {\n\n    t--;\n\n    ...\n\n}\n\nSo in that case, the loop condition should check t>0, and then inside, decrement t. So the loop will run t times.\n\nAlternatively, the loop can be written as while(t-- >0) { ... }, but in the code, the loop is written as:\n\nwhile( ... ) {\n\n    t--;\n\n    ... process one test case ...\n\n}\n\nSo the initial code is written with the intention of decrementing t inside the loop, but the loop condition is missing.\n\nSo the correct loop condition is (t>0). Because:\n\nInitially, t is the number of test cases. The loop runs while t>0.\n\nInside the loop, t is decremented by 1, and then the test case is processed.\n\nSo the loop condition is t>0.\n\nSo the code's missing part is the loop condition t>0.\n\nThus, the code's missing code is \"t>0\".\n\nSo the user must fill in the loop condition as t>0.\n\nSo the correct answer is to replace the while loop's condition with t>0.\n\nSo the final code, after filling in the loop condition, would be correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the code given has missing lines or blocks. The code's original approach is to output ceil(n/2), which according to our analysis is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct, except for the loop condition.\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the loop condition with t>0.\n\nSo the missing code is t>0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the correct answer is the while loop condition is t>0."
