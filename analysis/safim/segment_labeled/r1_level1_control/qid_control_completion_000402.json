  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining if a given array can be formed using specific operations. The operations are either moving forward and incrementing, or moving backward and decrementing. And after all operations, the pointer must be back on the first element.\n\nHmm. The key here is to model the constraints that these operations impose on the array. Let's think about the process.\n\nEach time you move forward, you increment the current element. So, for the pointer to reach position i, there must be some steps that involve moving forward to i. Similarly, moving back from i+1 would decrement i+1 and move back to i. But after all operations, the pointer ends up at the first element.\n\nWait, the operations are any number of times, but after all operations, the pointer must be on the first element. So the sequence of moves must end with the pointer at the first position.\n\nLet's think about the process. Let's model the steps. Each operation affects the pointer's position and the array's elements. The key is to find constraints that the array must satisfy for it to be possible.\n\nAn observation: The first element can't be zero unless all elements are zero. Because to get to the first element at the end, any operations that move forward must be balanced by moving back. But maybe not. Let's think of examples.\n\nWait, the example given in the note shows that after certain operations, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0], but the pointer is on the first element. So how was that achieved?\n\nIn that example, the steps involved moving forward and incrementing, then moving back, etc. So each time you move forward, you add 1 to the current element and move to next. When moving back, subtract 1 from current and move back.\n\nSo the process must end at position 1, but the array must be built in such a way that these steps are possible.\n\nAnother approach: Since the pointer starts and ends at the first element, the total number of forward moves and backward moves must form a certain pattern. For example, moving forward to position i requires i-1 forward steps, and moving back would require steps. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the process in reverse. Suppose we start from the final array and trace back the operations. But that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, the critical constraints are:\n\n1. The sum of all elements must be zero. Because each forward step adds 1 to the current element, and each backward step subtracts 1. But since each forward step moves to the next, and each backward step moves to the previous, the total number of forward steps must equal the total number of backward steps (since the pointer ends at the first element). Therefore, the sum of all elements is equal to (number of forward steps) - (number of backward steps). Wait, no. Because each forward step adds 1, but when you move forward, the next steps might add to the next elements. Similarly for backward steps. Wait, perhaps the sum of all elements is equal to the difference between the total number of forward steps and backward steps? Not sure.\n\nWait, each forward operation contributes +1 to the current element (then moves to next). Each backward operation contributes -1 to the current element (then moves back). Let's see: the total sum of the array would be (number of forward steps) - (number of backward steps). Because each forward step adds 1, each backward step subtracts 1. So sum = F - B. But since the pointer starts and ends at the first element, the total number of forward steps must equal the total number of backward steps. Because each forward step moves right, each backward moves left. So to end at the first element, the number of right moves must equal the number of left moves. So F = B. Therefore, sum of elements would be zero. So that's a necessary condition. But the sample input shows that sum is 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0. Which fits.\n\nSo, the first condition is that the sum of the array must be zero. But what if the array has trailing zeros? Wait, in the code provided, the code starts by popping the trailing zeros. Because trailing zeros can be ignored, as any operations to reach them can be undone. For example, if after some operations the array is [a1, a2, ..., ak, 0, 0], then the pointer can't be on those trailing zeros at the end. So the code removes the trailing zeros. Because those can be handled by the process.\n\nSo the code first trims the array by removing trailing zeros. Then, processes the remaining elements.\n\nThen, for each element from the end towards the start (since the code iterates from n-1 down to 0), it checks some condition. The sum variable is being accumulated as sum += a[i]. Then, the condition if(...) returns No.\n\nThe key is to figure out what condition must be checked here.\n\nSo, after trimming trailing zeros, the array is non-empty (unless the original array is all zeros, in which case the answer is yes). But in that case, the code would have popped all elements, and then the loop would not run, and print Yes.\n\nWait, in the code, after popping trailing zeros, n becomes the new size. Then, sum is computed by iterating from the end (n-1) to 0.\n\nSo for each i (from last element to first), sum is adding a[i], and then checking some condition. If any of those conditions are true, output No.\n\nSo what's the condition here?\n\nLet's think about the possible constraints.\n\nAnother observation: The array must start with a non-negative value, but that's not necessarily true. For example, the sample input ends with 2 as the first element.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. After trimming trailing zeros, it becomes [2, -1, -1], n=3.\n\nThen, the code checks each element from i=2 (a[i] is -1) down to 0.\n\nLet's see:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\ni=2: sum += -1 \u2192 sum is -1. Check condition. If it's not met, proceed.\n\ni=1: sum += -1 \u2192 sum is -2. Check condition.\n\ni=0: sum += 2 \u2192 sum is 0. Check condition.\n\nBut in the sample, this code would output Yes, as expected.\n\nHmm. So what's the condition here?\n\nPerhaps the sum after processing each element must be >=0. Because each time you process an element (in reverse), the sum represents something like the required number of steps that must not exceed a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, for the first element (i=0), the sum must be exactly zero. Because that's the sum of all elements (after trimming zeros). Wait, the code's sum starts at zero and adds a[i] for each element from n-1 down to 0. So sum is the sum of a[0..n-1], but in reverse order. Wait, no. Because in the code, sum is initialized to 0, then for i from n-1 downto 0: sum += a[i]. So the sum after each iteration is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1].\n\nWait, let's take the sample array after trimming: [2, -1, -1]. The code's loop starts with i=2 (a[i]=-1), sum becomes -1. Then i=1 (a[i]=-1), sum becomes -2. Then i=0 (a[i]=2), sum becomes 0. So the condition is checked for each i. So, during each iteration, sum is the sum of the elements from i to the end.\n\nBut why? Let's think about the process.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the operations as a sequence of steps. Each time you move forward, you add 1 to the current element and move right. Each time you move backward, you subtract 1 from the current element and move left. The final position must be the first element.\n\nLet's consider the order in which elements are modified. For the array to be built, each element's value is determined by the net number of times it was incremented and decremented.\n\nBut how does the movement affect the elements? For example, the first element can be modified multiple times as the pointer moves back and forth.\n\nThis seems complex. Let's try to find some invariant.\n\nAnother idea: After processing the array (trimming trailing zeros), the first element must be positive (except when all are zeros). Because when the pointer is at the first element, the only way to move forward is to increase it by 1. So the first element must be non-negative. But wait, the sample's first element is 2, which is positive. But what if the first element is zero? Then, the array must be all zeros, since otherwise, after trimming, there are non-zero elements, which would require some movement.\n\nWait, if the array is [0, a2, a3, ...], then the pointer starts at the first element. To increase a1 by 1, you have to move forward, which would require a1 being at least 1. But if the final array has a1 as 0, then during the process, any forward moves from a1 must have been balanced by backward moves. But this seems possible. For example, if you move forward once (a1 becomes 1), then move back (a2 decreases by 1, pointer moves back to a1). Then a1 is 1. Wait, but that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about the first element. Since the pointer starts here and must end here, any forward movement must be balanced by backward movements. So the first element can be zero even if other elements are non-zero. But maybe not. Let's think of a case where a1 is zero but other elements are non-zero. For example, n=2, a = [0, 0]. Trimmed to [0], then code says yes. If a = [0, 1], after trimming to [0,1], sum is 1, which is not zero, so the code would check sum. Wait, but sum in this case is 0 +1=1. So the code would output no. Which is correct, because the sum is 1, which isn't zero.\n\nSo the first condition is sum of the array (after trimming) must be zero. But in the code, the sum is accumulated from the end. Wait, in the code, sum starts at zero and adds a[i] for each i from n-1 downto 0. So after processing all elements, sum would be the sum of all a[i], but in the code, after each iteration, sum is the sum of a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[n-1]. So, the code's sum variable after processing each i is the sum of elements from i to n-1. So for each i, the condition is checking whether sum <= 0 (maybe?), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the code, after trimming, the array is non-empty (unless all zeros, which is handled by the code). Then, for each i from n-1 downto 0, sum is added a[i], and then a condition is checked.\n\nWhat's the condition that must be true for the array to be possible?\n\nLet's think in reverse. Suppose we start from the end (after all operations, the pointer is at the first element). Let's think of the process of building the array.\n\nThe last element (after trimming zeros) must have been visited only by forward steps. Because once you reach the end, you can't move further. So, the last non-zero element must be positive. Because each time you move forward to it, you add 1. So the last element can't be negative. Wait, but in the sample, the last non-zero element is -1. Wait, but in the sample after trimming, the array is [2, -1, -1]. Wait, the original array is [2,-1,-1,0], but after trimming, n=3, so the array is [2,-1,-1], which sum to 0. But the last element is -1, which is negative. That contradicts my previous thought.\n\nHmm. So perhaps that line of thinking is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: The process of moving and modifying elements must generate the array in such a way that the cumulative sum from the current index to the end is non-positive except for the first element.\n\nWait, perhaps for all elements except the first, the cumulative sum from that index to the end must be <= 0. And the sum of the entire array (after trimming) must be zero.\n\nBecause, when you process the elements in reverse order (from the end), the sum up to that point (sum) must be <=0 except for the first element.\n\nLet's see the sample:\n\nAfter trimming, array is [2, -1, -1]. Let's process each element from the end:\n\ni=2: sum += -1 \u2192 sum=-1. Check if sum >0? No. So proceed.\n\ni=1: sum +=-1 \u2192 sum=-2. Check if sum>0? No. Proceed.\n\ni=0: sum +=2 \u2192 sum=0. Check if sum <=0? No. But how?\n\nWait, maybe for all i >=1, the sum (from i to end) must be <=0. Only the sum of the entire array (i=0) must be 0.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nsum at i=1 (a[1] = -1) after adding a[i] is -1 (from i=2) plus a[1] (-1) \u2192 sum =-2. So for i=1, the sum is -2 <=0.\n\nAt i=0, sum is 0. So condition is sum must be zero? Or not.\n\nWait, the code's condition must be such that during the iteration from the end, for all elements except the first, the sum is <=0, and the first element's sum is zero.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn the code, after trimming, the code iterates from the end, accumulating sum, and checks some condition. If any of these conditions is true, output No.\n\nIn the sample, during the loop:\n\nFor i=2 (the last element in the trimmed array), sum is -1. Then, the condition is checked. If it's something like sum >=0, then this would trigger No. But in the sample, the code outputs Yes, so the condition must not trigger here.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the sum must be >=0 except for the first element? Or maybe, for the last element, the sum (which is a[i]) must be >=0. But in the sample, the last element is -1, which would not satisfy that.\n\nSo maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: For the array to be possible, the following must hold:\n\n- The sum of all elements (after trimming) is zero.\n\n- For each position i (from 1 to n-1), the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1] must be <=0.\n\n- The sum for i=0 (sum of all elements) is zero.\n\nBecause when moving through the array, each time you reach a position i, the total steps that have been made beyond i (i+1 and beyond) can't be positive. Otherwise, you can't return to the first element.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each position i (except the first), the cumulative sum from i to the end must be <=0. Because when you are at position i, any steps you take beyond this would require you to return, and during the return, you subtract from the elements. So the sum from i onwards must not be positive, except for the first element.\n\nIn the code, the sum variable represents the cumulative sum from i to the end. For each i >=1, this sum must be <=0. For i=0, it must be zero.\n\nSo the condition in the code is:\n\nif (sum > 0 || (i != 0 && sum == 0)) ?\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nFor the sample array after trimming:\n\ni=2: sum is -1. sum <=0 \u2192 okay.\n\ni=1: sum is -2 \u2192 okay.\n\ni=0: sum is 0 \u2192 okay.\n\nBut what about another case. Let's say the array is [1, -1, 0]. Trimming gives [1,-1]. sum for i=1 (a[1]=-1) is -1 <=0. sum for i=0 is 0. So yes.\n\nAnother example: [3,-1,-2]. sum for i=2 is -2 \u2192 ok. sum for i=1 is -3 \u2192 ok. sum for i=0 is 0 \u2192 ok. So possible.\n\nAnother example: [1, -1, 1, -1]. Trimming to [1,-1,1,-1]. sum is 0. For each i:\n\ni=3: sum +=-1 \u2192 sum=-1 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=2: sum +=1 \u2192 sum=0 \u2192 but i=2 is not 0. So sum is 0, which is <=0? No. Because sum must be <=0 for i>0. Wait, in this case, sum is zero for i=2. Is that allowed?\n\nIf sum is zero for i>0, that's allowed?\n\nBut according to the code, if the sum is zero for i>0, would that trigger the condition?\n\nWait, in the code, after trimming, the array is [1,-1,1,-1]. sum starts at 0.\n\ni=3: a[i] =-1 \u2192 sum= -1. check condition. If condition is sum >0, then no. So ok.\n\ni=2: a[i]=1 \u2192 sum=0. check condition. If the condition is sum >=0 and i!=0? Then 0 is >=0 but for i=2 (not zero), so the condition would trigger. But this array's sum is zero. But is this array possible?\n\nIn this case, the array [1,-1,1,-1] sum to zero. But can the operations generate this array?\n\nTo reach this array, the pointer must start at 0, and end at 0.\n\nLet's think of how to reach this array.\n\nBut perhaps it's not possible. For example, the fourth element is -1. But to reach the fourth element, you have to move forward through all elements, then move back. But each movement to the next adds 1, then moving back subtracts 1. So the fourth element can only be modified by moving to it (forward steps) and then backward steps. The net effect on the fourth element would be (number of times you passed it forward minus the number of times you passed it backward). Because each time you pass forward through it, you add 1 (if you increment it when entering), but that's not exactly right.\n\nAlternatively, each time you visit a cell during a forward move (except the first time), you have added 1. Each time you visit it during a backward move, you subtract 1. So the final value of a cell is equal to the number of times you entered it via forward moves minus the number of times you left it via backward moves.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the array in terms of the required movement.\n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. Each time you move forward, you increment the current element and move to the next. Each time you move backward, you decrement the current element and move to the previous.\n\nThe total number of forward steps and backward steps must be equal, since the pointer ends at position 0.\n\nThe sum of the array is F - B = 0, which is correct.\n\nBut how does each element's value depend on the number of times you enter and exit it?\n\nFor position 0: it's entered once at the beginning. Each time you leave it via a forward step, you have to return via a backward step (except possibly the last step? No, because the pointer must end at 0).\n\nSo for position 0, the number of forward steps leaving it is equal to the number of backward steps entering it. Each forward step from 0 adds 1 to a[0], and each backward step to 0 subtracts 1 from a[0]. But since the pointer starts at 0, the initial state is 0. So the total of a[0] is (number of forward steps from 0) - (number of backward steps to 0).\n\nBut for the pointer to end at 0, the number of forward steps from 0 must equal the number of backward steps to 0. Because each forward step from 0 must be balanced by a backward step to 0. Except for the final step, which must be a backward step to 0. Hmm, no. Wait, all steps must balance except the final step must end at 0.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of forward steps must equal the total number of backward steps, plus possibly zero. Because to return to 0, the net movement must be zero.\n\nSo for the entire array, the sum is zero. Which is correct.\n\nNow, considering each element after trimming the trailing zeros. For the array to be possible:\n\n- The first element must be non-negative. Because each time you move forward from it, you increment it. But if you have to end at it, the number of backward steps into it must equal the number of forward steps out of it. So a[0] = (forward steps from 0) - (backward steps into 0). But forward steps from 0 is the same as backward steps into 0 (since you end at 0). So a[0] is zero? No. Because in the sample, a[0] is 2. So this logic is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think again of the code.\n\nThe code removes trailing zeros. Then, for each element from the end to the beginning, it accumulates the sum and checks a condition.\n\nIn the sample, after trimming, the sum for each element is:\n\ni=2 (sum +=-1) \u2192 sum=-1.\n\ni=1 (sum +=-1) \u2192 sum=-2.\n\ni=0 (sum +=2) \u2192 sum=0.\n\nThe code checks some condition for each i. If any of these conditions are true, output No.\n\nSo what condition would cause the code to output No?\n\nPerhaps the sum must be <=0 for all i except when i=0. For i=0, sum must be zero.\n\nSo, for i>0, sum must be <=0. For i=0, sum must be zero.\n\nIn the sample, the sum for i=2 is -1 <=0, i=1 is -2 <=0, i=0 is 0. So code returns yes.\n\nAnother example: array [1, -1, 1, -1], sum is zero. Trimming gives [1,-1,1,-1]. Processing from the end:\n\ni=3: sum -1 \u2192 -1 <=0 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=2: sum +=1 \u2192 0. Since i=2>0, sum is 0. But condition is sum must be <=0. So this would trigger a No.\n\nSo the code would output No for this array.\n\nSo the condition in the code must be: sum >0 || (i !=0 && sum ==0).\n\nWait, no. If sum is zero for i>0, then it's allowed?\n\nWait, sum being zero for i>0 would mean that the cumulative sum from i to end is zero. But according to the code's logic, that's not allowed?\n\nLet's think of the example array [1,-1,0]. Trimming to [1,-1]. sum for i=1 is -1 (sum +=-1), which is ok. sum for i=0 is 0. So code returns yes. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, -1]. The sum for i=1 is -1 <=0. sum for i=0 is 0. So code returns yes. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [0, 0, 0]. Trimming to empty array, code outputs yes.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 0, 0]. Trimming to [1]. sum is 1. sum must be zero. So code checks sum for i=0. If sum is 1 !=0 \u2192 code returns no.\n\nWhich is correct because sum of array is 1, which is not zero.\n\nSo the code's condition is:\n\nfor each i in the trimmed array:\n\nsum +=a[i]\n\nif (sum <=0 && i !=0) \u2192 allowed.\n\nif (i ==0 and sum !=0) \u2192 not allowed.\n\nBut in the code, how is this checked.\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor(int i=n-1; i>=0; --i) {\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nif( condition ) {\n\ncout << \"No\\n\"; return;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nSo the code is looping from the end to the start. So the first element processed is the last element of the trimmed array.\n\nFor each i in this loop, sum is the sum of a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[n-1].\n\nThe code must check:\n\n- For all i except 0 (i>0), sum must be <=0.\n\n- For i=0, sum must be equal to zero.\n\nSo the condition inside the if statement is:\n\nif ( (i !=0 && sum >=0) ) \u2192 no, because sum must be <=0 for i>0.\n\nWait, but sum must be <=0 for i>0. So if sum is positive, then condition is true.\n\nWait, the condition is: if (sum >0) \u2192 then it's invalid.\n\nOr if sum is >=0 for i>0.\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (sum > 0) \u2192 output No.\n\nBut also, for i=0, sum must be zero. So the code must check if (sum >0 || (i ==0 && sum !=0) ).\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet's think:\n\nFor each i:\n\nIf i is not 0 and sum >0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nIf i is 0 and sum !=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif ( (i !=0 && sum >0) || (i ==0 && sum !=0) )\n\nBut how to write this in code.\n\nIn the code, the current i in the loop is from n-1 downto 0. So during the loop, the code must check for each i:\n\nsum >0 (for i>0) \u2192 invalid.\n\nOr sum !=0 when i==0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo combining:\n\nif ( (i !=0 && sum >0) || (i ==0 && sum !=0) )\n\nBut how to write this concisely.\n\nAlternatively, for all i >=0:\n\nif (sum > (i ==0 ? 0 : 0) )\n\nNo, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code can check:\n\nif (sum >0 || (i ==0 && sum !=0))\n\nYes. Because:\n\n- For i>0: sum must be <=0. So sum >0 is invalid.\n\n- For i==0: sum must be zero. So sum !=0 is invalid.\n\nSo the condition is sum >0 OR (i ==0 and sum !=0). Which can be written as (sum >0) || (i ==0 && sum !=0).\n\nBut in code, the condition can be written as:\n\nif( (sum >0) || (i ==0 && sum !=0) )\n\nBut wait, in the code, the loop starts with i =n-1 downto 0. So for each i, after adding a[i] to sum, check if sum >0 (for i>=0) or i==0 and sum !=0.\n\nWait, for i>0:\n\nsum must be <=0. If sum >0, condition is true.\n\nFor i==0:\n\nsum must be zero. If sum !=0, condition is true.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif ( (sum >0) || (i ==0 && sum !=0) )\n\nYes. So in the code's TODO line, the condition is (sum >0) || (i ==0 && sum !=0).\n\nBut wait, what about cases where i>0 and sum ==0?\n\nFor example, sum is zero for i>0. Is that allowed?\n\nYes. For example, the array [1, -1, 0]. Trimmed to [1, -1]. sum for i=1 is -1 (sum +=-1), which is <=0. Then sum for i=0 is 0. So it's allowed.\n\nAnother example: array [2, -2, 0], trimmed to [2,-2]. sum for i=1 is -2 \u2192 okay. sum for i=0 is 0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nBut what if the array is [0, 0, 0, 1, -1], which trims to [0,0,0,1,-1]. sum of the array is 0. But the first element is zero. Wait, but after trimming, the array is [0,0,0,1,-1]. But trimming removes trailing zeros, so how?\n\nWait, in the code, it's popping the back elements while they are zero.\n\nFor example, array [0,0,0,1,-1]. The last element is -1, not zero. So trimming does not pop anything. The code processes the entire array.\n\nsum is 0+0+0+1+(-1) =0.\n\nThen, for each i from 4 downto 0:\n\ni=4: sum =-1. condition: sum>0 \u2192 no. proceed.\n\ni=3: sum +=1 \u2192 sum=0. i=3>0. condition sum>0 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: sum +=0 \u2192 sum=0. condition sum>0 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: sum +=0 \u2192 sum=0. condition sum>0 \u2192 no.\n\ni=0: sum +=0 \u2192 sum=0. condition sum>0 || (i==0 && sum !=0) \u2192 false. So code returns yes.\n\nBut is this array possible?\n\nThe array is [0,0,0,1,-1].\n\nThe pointer starts at 0. The array's first element is 0. How can this be achieved?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, the initial array is all zeros. So the initial pointer is on the first element (0). But after some operations, the array becomes [0,0,0,1,-1] and the pointer must be back on 0.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach time you move forward, you add 1 to the current element and move right. To reach the fourth element (index 3, 0-based?), you need to move forward three times. Each time adding 1 to elements 0,1,2. Then move back three times, subtracting 1 from elements 3,2,1. Then move forward again to 4 steps, etc. This seems possible.\n\nSo the array [0,0,0,1,-1] is possible. So the code's condition must allow sum=0 for i>0.\n\nThus, the condition is only sum>0 for i>0, not sum >=0. Because sum=0 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the code's condition should be:\n\nif ( (sum > 0) || (i == 0 && sum != 0) )\n\nSo in the code, the missing condition is:\n\nsum > 0 || (i == 0 && sum != 0)\n\nSo the code checks whether the sum is positive (for any i>0) or the total sum is non-zero (i=0).\n\nSo in the code, the missing line is:\n\nif( sum > 0 || (i == 0 && sum !=0) )\n\nSo, putting this into the code's TODO line:\n\nif (sum >0 || (i ==0 && sum !=0)) {\n\ncout << \"No\\n\"; return;\n\n}\n\nThis condition would correctly check the required constraints."
