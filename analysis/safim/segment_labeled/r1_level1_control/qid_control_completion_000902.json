Because each stamp covers two cells, and you can't create a single cell that's non-W. So any occurrence of a single R or B surrounded by Ws is impossible.\n\nSo the steps to check are:\n\n1. Split the string into segments separated by W. For each segment:\n   a. If the segment is empty (like between two Ws), skip.\n   b. If the length of the segment is 1, then it's impossible. So return NO.\n   c. Check if the segment contains at least one R and at least one B. If it has only R's or only B's, then it's impossible. Return NO.\n\nSo in the code, after splitting the string into 'a' array (split by W), for each 'sp' in 'a', we need to check two conditions: length >= 1 (since split could give empty strings if there are leading or trailing Ws) but if the segment is non-empty, check if its length is 1 (invalid) or if it doesn't have both R and B.\n\nWait, but in the code, the split on 'W' may result in empty strings. For example, if the input is \"WBR\", then splitting on W gives [\"\", \"BR\"]. So the empty string can be ignored. But any non-empty string in 'a' must have length >=2, and contain both R and B.\n\nWait, no. For example, the split of \"RBW\" would result in [\"RB\", \"\"], but the empty string here is after the W. So the code loops through each 'sp' in 'a', which includes the empty strings. But for the empty strings, the code's current checks (like 'sp.contains(\"R\")') would not trigger, but perhaps the code is written to check only the non-empty segments.\n\nWait, in the code, for each 'sp' in 'a':\n\nif (sp is empty) then the code does nothing, because the code checks if (sp contains B or R). But in the code's current structure:\n\nThe code for each sp in a[] does:\n\nc1 is 0 if the sp does not contain B, else 1. Similarly c2 is 1 if sp contains R. Then if c1 != c2 (i.e., one is 0 and the other is 1), then res is set to NO.\n\nWait, the current code seems to check whether the presence of B and R in the segment is the same. For example, if the segment has both B and R, then c1 and c2 are both 1, so they are equal. If the segment has only B, then c1 is 1, c2 is 0: they are not equal. So that would trigger res = NO. Similarly, if the segment has only R, then c1 is 0 (assuming the missing code checks for B), so c2 is 1, which would trigger res = NO.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the code for c1 is:\n\nif (/* TODO */) c1 = 1;\n\nThe comment suggests that the missing code is checking if the sp contains B. Because the code then checks if sp contains R. Then, if c1 != c2, which would happen if one is present and the other is not, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the missing code is supposed to check if sp contains 'B'. So the condition would be sp.contains(\"B\"). Then, c1 is 1 if sp has B, else 0. c2 is 1 if sp has R. Then, if c1 != c2, meaning that the segment has either B without R or R without B, then it's invalid.\n\nBut there's another condition: each segment's length must be at least 2. So even if a segment has both B and R, but its length is 1, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the code as currently written is missing that check. Wait, no. Because in the code's loop, after splitting into a[], each 'sp' is a segment between Ws. So for example, if the original string is \"R\", then splitting on W would give [\"R\"], which is a non-empty segment. But the length of the segment is 1, which is invalid. However, in the current code, the code checks if c1 != c2, but if the segment is \"R\", then c1 is 0 (assuming the missing code checks for B), c2 is 1. So c1 != c2, which triggers res = NO. But even if the code passes the c1 == c2 check, but the length is 1, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. For example, if a segment is \"BR\", which has both B and R. Then c1 and c2 are 1 and 1. So c1 == c2. The code would not set res to NO. But the length is 2, which is acceptable. But if the segment is \"B\", then the code would check that sp has B (c1=1) and sp does not have R (c2=0). So c1 != c2, which sets res to NO. So that's correct. But if the segment is \"BB\", then c1=1 (has B) and c2=0 (no R). So c1 != c2, which is invalid. But \"BB\" is a segment of length 2 but all B's. So this code would correctly detect that. But what about a segment like \"BRB\" which has both B and R. Then c1 and c2 are 1, so c1 == c2. The code would think it's okay. But what about the length? Well, in that case, the length is 3, which is allowed.\n\nWait, but the code as written doesn't check the length of the segment. So the code would miss cases where a segment is of length 1. For example, if the input is \"R\", split into [\"R\"], which has length 1. The code would check c1 and c2. Since \"R\" has no B (c1=0) and has R (c2=1). So c1 != c2, res becomes NO. That's correct.\n\nBut what about a segment of length 1 but with a W? No, because the split is on W. So segments cannot contain W. So the code's logic here is:\n\nSegments are the parts between Ws. Each such segment must be non-empty (i.e., if the split produces an empty string, like leading or trailing Ws, then the code's loop will process them, but in those cases, sp is empty. So for sp empty, the code checks if (sp contains B) and (sp contains R). For empty sp, these are false. So c1 and c2 are 0. So c1 == c2, so no problem. So empty strings in a[] (from split) are ignored. But any non-empty string in a[] must satisfy:\n\n- has at least one B and at least one R (so c1 and c2 are 1, equal)\nAND\n- the length is at least 2.\n\nWait, but the code as written doesn't check the length. So the code could have a segment of length 1, which would have c1 != c2 (because for example, \"R\" has c1=0, c2=1). So in that case, res becomes NO. So the code handles the length 1 case through the c1 and c2 check. Because a segment of length 1 cannot have both B and R, so it will have c1 != c2, which triggers res = NO.\n\nBut wait, what if a segment is \"RB\" (length 2) and has both R and B. Then c1 and c2 are 1, so it's okay. But suppose a segment is \"BBR\" (length 3). That's allowed, but the code would check that it has B and R, so c1 and c2 are 1. So that's okay.\n\nBut what about a segment of length 2 with \"RR\"? Then, since it has no B, c1=0, c2=1, so c1 != c2, which triggers res = NO.\n\nSo the code's current logic checks two conditions:\n\nFor each segment between Ws:\n\n- The segment must have both B and R (so c1 and c2 are 1, which are equal)\nOR\n- The segment is empty.\n\nBut also, the code is not checking the length. So for example, a segment of length 0 (empty) is allowed. But non-empty segments must have at least one B and one R.\n\nBut what if a segment has length 2 but is \"RR\"? Then, c1 is 0 (no B) and c2 is 1. So c1 != c2, so res is set to NO.\n\nBut what if a segment has length 3 and is \"RRR\"? Then, same as above.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct for checking that the segment has at least one B and R. But how about the length of the segment?\n\nWait, the problem says that each stamp must cover two cells, and the stamp must be applied such that it fits completely. So any non-W segment must consist of at least two cells. So the code must also check that each non-empty segment (sp) has length >= 2.\n\nBut in the code as provided, this check is not present. So for example, if the input is \"RRB\", which is split into [\"RRB\"], which has length 3. But if the input is \"R\", split into [\"R\"], then the code correctly marks it as invalid because c1 != c2. But if the input is \"RB\", split into [\"RB\"], which is length 2 and has both, so code returns yes. That's correct.\n\nWait, but the code does not check for the length of the segment. So for example, a segment of length 0 (empty string) is allowed. But non-empty segments can't have length 1. But the code checks that a non-empty segment must have both B and R, which can't happen in a length 1. So the code's current logic automatically handles the length 1 case. Because a segment of length 1 can't have both B and R, so c1 != c2, which triggers NO.\n\nSo in that case, the code's current logic (with the missing code filled in) is sufficient. But wait, what about a segment of length 0 (empty string)? Like, if the input is \"W\", then the split would result in [\"\", \"\"]. But the code loops through each sp in a, which are the two empty strings. For each, sp is empty. So c1 and c2 are both 0 (since sp doesn't contain B or R). So c1 == c2, so res remains YES. But in this case, the entire string is W, which is allowed (since no stamps are needed). So that's correct.\n\nBut the code in the problem splits the string into a[] by splitting on W. So all non-W segments are the parts between Ws. Each such segment must be either:\n\n- Empty (if the original string starts or ends with W, or has consecutive Ws)\n- Or a group of non-W characters.\n\nBut in the code, each non-empty segment must have both B and R and have length >=2. But the code's current logic checks for the presence of B and R (so c1 and c2 are 1), which implies that the segment has at least two characters (since a single character can't have both B and R). Wait, no. For example, a segment of length 2 with \"BR\" is okay. But a segment of length 3 with \"BRB\" is also okay. But a segment of length 0 is allowed. The code's logic is:\n\nfor each sp in a:\n\n   if sp is non-empty:\n\n       check if it has B (c1) and R (c2). If either is missing, then invalid.\n\nBut the code doesn't check if the length is at least 2. Wait, but how could a non-empty sp have both B and R if its length is 1? It's impossible. So in that case, for a non-empty sp, the code's check ensures that it must have both B and R, which implies that the length is at least 2. Because in a non-empty segment, if it's length 1, then it can't have both B and R. So the code's check for B and R presence automatically ensures that the length is >=2.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because if a segment is non-empty, and it has both B and R, then it must have at least two characters. Because to have both, there must be at least one B and one R. So the length is at least 2.\n\nSo the code's current approach, by checking that each non-empty segment contains both B and R, automatically ensures that the segment's length is >=2. Because a single character can't have both. So, in this way, the code's logic is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code in the if condition is checking whether the current segment 'sp' contains 'B'. So the code is:\n\nif (sp.contains(\"B\")) c1 = 1;\n\nSo the code would check for each segment whether it contains B and R. If both are present, then c1 and c2 are 1, which is okay. Otherwise, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the missing code is sp.contains(\"B\").\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nif (sp.contains(\"B\")) c1 = 1;\n\nSo the code after splitting into segments, for each segment, checks if it has B and R. If any segment is non-empty and doesn't have both, returns NO.\n\nThus, the correct code to fill in is sp.contains(\"B\")."
