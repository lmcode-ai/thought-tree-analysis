Wait, but that might not be sufficient because of the circular arrangement. Wait, maybe the minimal required is that the sum of all (2a_i +1) < = m. But that's not exactly right because when arranged in a circle, the spacing between them can be optimized. Alternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that 2*sum(a_i) + n <= m. Wait, no, because each a_i contributes 2a_i +1, so the total would be sum(2a_i +1) = 2*sum(a_i) +n. So that total must be <= m. Because each person's block is 2a_i+1, and they can't overlap, so the sum of all their blocks must be <= m. But that's a necessary condition. But is it sufficient? Wait, let's see the sample input. For example, the second test case: n=2, m=4. The a's are 1 and 1. Sum(2a_i +1) is 2*(1+1)+2 = 6, but m is 4. Wait, that would give 6>4, but the sample output is YES. So that can't be right.

The sum is 3, which is equal to m-n (5-2=3). But the problem is that the second person requires a block of 5 chairs (2*2+1=5), which is exactly the total chairs. So there's no space for the first person. So the problem is that the largest a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, but there are other people. So the condition must also ensure that the sum of the a_i's excluding the largest is <= (m - (2a_max +1) - (n-1)). Not sure.

So that's not sufficient. Hmm, so that's not the right condition. Hmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n), and the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2, and also the sum of the top k a_i's must be <= (m - (k+1)) for all k up to n.

Hmm, so what's the problem here? The second person requires a block of 5 chairs (2*2+1=5). So placing them alone would take all chairs. But there's another person. So the condition must also ensure that the sum of all a_i's plus n is <= m. Wait, sum(a_i) +n = 3+2=5 = m. So that's okay. But the problem is that the second person's block is exactly m chairs, so there's no space for the first person. So the condition must also ensure that the largest a_i is not equal to (m-1)/2 when there are other people. Wait, in sample3, the largest a_i is 2, which is exactly (5-1)/2 =2. So when the largest a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, then there can be no other people. Because placing that person would take up exactly m chairs (since 2a_i+1 =5). So if there are other people, it's impossible. Ah! So the condition must also ensure that if the maximum a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, then there can be only one person. So the conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n). 2. The maximum a_i must be <= (m-1)/2. 3. If the maximum a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, then there must be only one person (n=1). Wait, but in sample2, the maximum a_i is 1, which is (4-1)/2 =1.5 \u2192 1 is less than that. So okay. Sample3's maximum a_i is 2, which is exactly (5-1)/2=2. So since n=2>1, it's invalid. So that would make the condition work. So the conditions are:\n\n- sum(a_i) < = (m-n).\n\n- max_a <= (m-1)/2.\n\n- if max_a == (m-1)/2 \u2192 then n must be 1. So combining these. So in code: Sort the array, compute sum, max_a. if (sum > (m-n)) \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a == (m-1)/2 and n>1 \u2192 no.\n\nElse yes. Wait, let's test sample3:\n\nsum is 3, m-n is 3 \u2192 okay. max_a is 2, which equals (5-1)/2 \u2192 yes. But n=2>1 \u2192 so condition 3 is violated \u2192 output no. Which is correct. Sample2:\n\nmax_a is 1 < (4-1)/2 \u2192 okay.\n\nSample4: a_i 1,2,3. m=9. max_a is 3. (9-1)/2 is 4 \u2192 3 <4 \u2192 okay. sum is 6. m-n=9-3=6 \u2192 sum equals \u2192 okay. So yes. Another test case where max_a is exactly (m-1)/2 and n=1 \u2192 yes. So this seems to work. So the code needs to:\n\n- Sort the array to find max_a. - Compute sum.\n\n- Check the three conditions. Wait, but the first condition is sum < = (m-n). The second is max_a <= (m-1)/2. The third is if max_a == (m-1)/2 \u2192 n must be 1. So in code: In the else block (since n is not 1):\n\nWe need to check:\n\nif (sum > (m-n)) \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a == (m-1)/2 \u2192 then since n is not 1 \u2192 no.\n\nElse yes. Wait, but what about when max_a is less than (m-1)/2? Then the other conditions are okay. So the code would be:\n\nsum = sum of a_i.\n\nmax_a = maximum a_i. if (sum > (m-n)) \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a == (m-1)/2 and n>1 \u2192 no.\n\nElse yes. So that's the condition. Now, looking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nsum=sum + b -c +n; // Not sure what this is. Probably a mistake. Wait, in the code given:\n\nsum is initialized to 0. Then, for each a in the array, they do:\n\nsum +=a.\n\nWait, in the code: Initially, sum is 0.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the condition for the else part here. Let's see the problem again. The chairs are arranged in a circle, and each person needs at least a[i] empty chairs on both sides. So for each person sitting in a chair j, the required space is 2*a[i] +1 chairs (since they take one, and a[i] on each side). But since it's a circle, the total required must fit into m chairs without overlapping.\n\nHmm, the initial code has sum=sum + b -c +n. Wait, maybe that's part of the condition. Let me think. The sum of all a[i] plus some terms... Not sure yet.\n\nThe problem requires that all people can be seated such that their required spaces don't overlap. Since the chairs are in a circle, perhaps the total required space must be less than or equal to m. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nLet me think of each person's required block. Each person i needs a block of 2*a[i] +1 chairs. But since they are arranged in a circle, the total required space must be <= m. But since they can't overlap, the sum of all (2a_i +1) must be <= m. Wait, but that might not be sufficient because of the circular arrangement. Wait, maybe the minimal required is that the sum of all (2a_i +1) <= m. But that's not exactly right because when arranged in a circle, the spacing between them can be optimized. Alternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that 2*sum(a_i) + n <= m. Wait, no, because each a_i contributes 2a_i +1, so the total would be sum(2a_i +1) = 2*sum(a_i) +n. So that total must be <= m. Because each person's block is 2a_i+1, and they can't overlap, so the sum of all their blocks must be <= m. But that's a necessary condition. But is it sufficient?\n\nWait, let's see the sample input. For example, the second test case: n=2, m=4. The a's are 1 and 1. Sum(2a_i +1) is 2*(1+1)+2 = 6, but m is 4. Wait, that would give 6>4, but the sample output is YES. So that can't be right. So my initial thought is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that approach is incorrect. So I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's arrange the people in such a way that their required spaces are as spaced as possible. Since the chairs are in a circle, perhaps the minimal required is that the sum of (2a_i +1) <= m. But in the second test case, that sum would be 2*(1+1) +2 = 6, which is more than 4. But the sample says it's possible. So that's conflicting. So that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me re-calculate. For each person, the required space is 2a_i +1. So for two people with a_i=1 each, each requires 3 chairs. So total required is 3+3 =6. But m is 4. So that can't fit. But the sample says it's possible. So clearly, my initial approach is wrong. So I need to think again.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the first person sits in chair 2, and the second in 0. Let's see:\n\nPerson 1 at chair 2 (0-based). They need at least 1 empty on each side. So the blocked chairs are (2-1) mod4=1, 2, (2+1) mod4=3. So chairs 1,2,3 are blocked. The second person is at 0. Their blocked chairs are (0-1 mod4)=3, 0, (0+1 mod4)=1. So blocked chairs 3,0,1. Wait, but overlapping here. The first person's blocked chairs include 1,2,3. The second's include 0,1,3. So overlapping at chairs 1 and 3. But how is that possible?\n\nWait, the problem states that if a person sits in j, then no one else can sit in any of the chairs from (j -a[i]) mod m up to (j+a[i]) mod m. So the entire block from (j -a[i]) to (j+a[i]) must be empty except for j. Wait, no, the problem says that no one else can sit in those chairs. So the person's own chair is allowed, but others can't be in any of those chairs. So the two people's blocked regions must not overlap except possibly at their own chairs?\n\nWait in the sample, the first person is at 2, so their blocked chairs are 1,2,3. The second is at 0, blocked chairs 3,0,1. So the blocked regions overlap at chairs 1 and 3. But that would mean that the second person's chair (0) is in the blocked area of the first (since 0 is part of the first's blocked chairs? Wait, the first's blocked chairs are (2-1)=1 mod4, up to (2+1)=3 mod4. So chairs 1,2,3. The second's chair is 0, which is not in that blocked area. But the second's blocked area includes 3, which is in the first's blocked area. But the first's blocked area includes chair 3, so the second can't be sitting in 0 if chair 3 is blocked by the first? Wait, no. The second's chair is 0, which is allowed as long as it's not in the first's blocked area. The first's blocked area is 1,2,3. The second's chair is 0, which is not in that. But the second's blocked area includes 3, which is in the first's blocked area. But that's okay because the first is already sitting there. Wait, the problem says that if someone is sitting in j, then no one else can sit in any of those chairs. So the second's blocked area includes chair 3, which is part of the first's blocked area. But the first is sitting in chair 2, so chair 3 is blocked for others. The second's chair is 0, which is allowed. But the second's blocked area includes chair 3, which is already blocked by the first. So overlapping is allowed as long as the chairs are not occupied by others. So the overlapping is okay as long as the chairs are not occupied by other people. So the total required space isn't the sum of all (2a_i +1), but perhaps the maximum required spacing?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to arrange the people in such a way that each person's required space is spaced out. Let me think of the chairs as a circle. To maximize the minimal distance between people, we can sort the a_i in non-decreasing order, then place them in a way that each requires the maximum possible spacing.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: the minimal required is that the sum of all (2a_i +1) must be <= m. But in the sample case 2, that sum is 2*(1+1) +2 = 6, which is more than 4. So that can't be. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct condition is that the sum of (2a_i) + n <= m. Let's see sample 2: 2*(1+1) +2 = 6 again. No, same problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of (2a_i) + n <= m. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: each person requires a block of 2a_i +1 chairs. But these blocks must be placed in the circle such that they don't overlap. Since it's a circle, the total required space must be <= m. So the sum of all (2a_i +1) must be <= m. But in sample 2, that sum is 3+3=6, which is more than 4. But the sample says it's possible. So that can't be right. So there's a flaw in this reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe the sample explanation is different. Let me recheck the sample 2:\n\nSample 2: n=2, m=4. a1=1, a2=1.\n\nThe first person sits at chair 2. Their required blocked chairs are (2-1)=1, 2, 3. So chairs 1,2,3 are blocked. The second sits at 0. Their blocked chairs are 3 (0-1 mod4?), 0, 1. So chairs 3,0,1. The overlapping chairs are 1 and 3. But the first's blocked area includes chair 3, so the second can't be sitting in 0 if chair 3 is blocked? Wait, no. The second's chair is 0, which is allowed. The blocked chairs for the second include 3, but that's already blocked by the first. So the second's blocked area includes chair 3, but since the first is already there, that's okay. The problem states that no one else can sit in those chairs. So the second's blocked area includes chair 3, but the first is already sitting there. So that's allowed. So the two blocks are overlapping, but the total required space is 3+3=6 chairs, but m is 4. So how is this possible?\n\nAh, because the blocks are overlapping. So the sum of their individual required spaces is more than m, but they can overlap in such a way that the total required chairs are less than m. So the sum of (2a_i +1) is not the right way to calculate it. So I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: The minimal required is that the sum of all (a_i) must be <= (m -n)/2. Because each person takes 1 chair, and between them, they need at least a_i on each side. Wait, perhaps the total required empty chairs is sum(a_i)*2, plus the n chairs for the people. So total required chairs is n + 2*sum(a_i) <= m. But in sample 2, sum(a_i) is 2, so 2*2 +2 =6, which again exceeds m=4. So that's not working.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that the maximum a_i must be <= (m-1)/2. Because if someone needs a_i chairs on each side, then the required space for that person is 2a_i +1 chairs. So that must be <= m. So the maximum a_i must be <= (m-1)/2. Otherwise, even a single person can't be seated. So that's a necessary condition. But in sample 2, the a_i is 1, and m is 4. (4-1)/2 is 1.5, so 1 is okay. So that's okay.\n\nAnother necessary condition is that the sum of all (2a_i +1) must be <= m + (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order, then check if for each i, a_i <= (m - (i)) / (n - i +1). Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea from similar problems. Let me think of arranging the people in a circle. To maximize the minimal spacing, we can sort the a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, the required spacing for each person must be at least a_i. The minimal required is that the sum of all (2a_i +1) must be <= m. But that's not the case in sample 2. So perhaps the correct approach is to arrange the people in such a way that the largest a_i is placed first, then the next, etc. So the total required is the sum of (2a_i +1) must be <= m + something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of all (2a_i) + n <= m. Let me see sample 2: 2*(1+1) +2 =6, which is more than 4. So that's not.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n). Because each person needs a_i chairs on each side, so total empty chairs needed is 2*sum(a_i). Plus the n chairs for the people. So total chairs needed is n + 2*sum(a_i) <= m. So in sample 2, 2+2*2=6>4. So that's not possible. But the sample says it is possible. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows overlapping of the required empty chairs. Like, if two people are seated such that their required empty chairs overlap, then those chairs can be counted once. So the total required chairs is not the sum of all (2a_i +1), but the maximum required spacing plus the others arranged in between.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order, then check that the sum of (2a_i +1) <= m. But that's not working for sample 2. So maybe the correct condition is that the sum of (2a_i) + n <= m. Wait, let me see sample 2 again. 2*(1+1) +2 =6, which is more than 4. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of (a_i) must be <= (m -n). Because each person needs a_i chairs on each side, but overlapping can occur. So the total required empty chairs is sum(a_i) * 2, but since they can overlap, the minimal required is sum(a_i) * 2 <= m -n. So m must be >= n + 2*sum(a_i). But sample 2 has sum(a_i)=2, so 2*2=4, so m must be >= 2+4=6. But m is 4, so that would give no, but sample says yes. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem differently. Let's imagine the chairs arranged in a circle. Each person must have at least a_i chairs on both sides. So between any two people, there must be at least a_i + a_j chairs between them? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal required is that the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2. Because if someone needs a_i chairs on each side, then the required space is 2a_i +1 chairs. So that must be <= m. So 2a_i +1 <= m \u2192 a_i <= (m-1)/2. So that's a necessary condition. But also, the sum of all (2a_i +1) must be <= m + (something). Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, for each i from 1 to n, the required is that the sum of (2a_i +1) must be <= m. But that's not the case in sample 2. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's note. The fourth test case has 3 people with a_i 1,2,3. The chairs are 9. The solution is to place them at 1,4,7. Each has required a_i chairs. Let's see:\n\nPerson 1 (a=1) at 1: needs 1 on each side. So chairs 0 and 2 must be empty. But the next person is at 4, which is 3 chairs away from 1. So between them, there are 2 chairs (chair 2 and 3). Wait, but a_i=1 requires at least 1 empty chair on each side. So between them, the distance must be at least a_i + a_j +1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal distance between two people must be at least a_i + a_j +1. Because each requires a_i chairs on their right and left. So between two people, the distance must be at least (a_i + a_j +1). But how to arrange this in a circle?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as placing n non-overlapping intervals on a circle of m chairs. Each interval for person i has length 2a_i +1. The total length of all intervals must be <= m. But since it's a circle, the intervals can be placed in a way that they don't overlap. So the sum of all (2a_i +1) must be <= m. But in sample 2, that sum is 6, which is more than 4. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but in sample 2, the two intervals are overlapping. So their total length is 6, but the actual chairs covered are 4. So the sum of their lengths is more than m, but they can overlap. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of all (a_i) must be <= (m -n)/2. Let me see sample 2: sum(a_i) is 2. (4-2)/2 =1. 2>1 \u2192 so it would say no, but sample says yes. So that's not.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of the problem as placing each person's required space in such a way that they are spaced out. Let me think of the chairs as a line first (not a circle), then wrap around. The minimal required is that the total required space (sum of (2a_i +1)) must be <= m. But in a circle, perhaps the minimal required is that the sum of (2a_i) + n <= m. Let me see sample 2: 2*(1+1) +2 =6>4 \u2192 no. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n). Because each person takes 1 chair, and each a_i requires a_i chairs on each side. But overlapping can occur. So the total required empty chairs is sum(a_i)*2. So total chairs needed is n + sum(a_i)*2 <= m. So in sample 2, 2 + 2*2 =6>4 \u2192 no. But sample says yes. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2, and the sum of all (a_i) must be <= (m -n). Let me see sample 2: sum(a_i)=2, m-n=2 \u2192 2<=2 \u2192 yes. So that would work. The maximum a_i is 1, which is <= (4-1)/2=1.5 \u2192 yes. So that would pass. Let's see another sample.\n\nSample 3: n=2, m=5. a_i are 1 and 2. The maximum a_i is 2. (5-1)/2 is 2 \u2192 okay. Sum(a_i)=3. m-n=3 \u2192 3<=3 \u2192 yes. But the sample says it's impossible. So that condition is not sufficient.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. So in sample 3, the conditions would be met but the answer is no. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so what's wrong with sample 3? Let's see. The second person needs a_i=2. So their required space is 2*2+1=5 chairs. So if they are placed alone, they need 5 chairs, which is exactly m=5. But there's another person. So the first person can't be placed anywhere. So the sum of a_i is 3, which equals m-n (5-2=3). But the maximum a_i is 2, which is allowed. But the problem is that the second person's required space is 5 chairs, which is the entire circle. So no room for the first person. So the sum of a_i being equal to m-n is not sufficient.\n\nSo the problem requires that the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2, and also that the sum of (2a_i +1) <= m + (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order, then check that for each i, a_i <= (m - (i)) / (n - i +1). Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea from the problem's solution. Let me think of the chairs arranged in a circle. To place n people such that each has at least a_i chairs on each side, the minimal required is that the sum of all (a_i) must be <= (m -n)/2. Because each person takes 1 chair, and each a_i requires a_i chairs on each side. But overlapping can occur. So the total required empty chairs is sum(a_i)*2. So total chairs needed is n + 2*sum(a_i) <= m \u2192 sum(a_i) <= (m-n)/2. But in sample 2, sum(a_i)=2, (4-2)/2=1 \u2192 2>1 \u2192 so it would say no, but sample says yes. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, so that's not the right condition. So what's different in sample 2?\n\nWait in sample 2, the two people are placed such that their required empty chairs overlap. So the total empty chairs needed is not 2*2=4, but 2 (since their blocked areas overlap). Let me see:\n\nPerson 1 at chair 2 requires chairs 1,2,3 blocked. Person 2 at 0 requires 3,0,1 blocked. The blocked chairs are 0,1,2,3 \u2192 all chairs. So the total empty chairs needed is 4-2 (since two are occupied) \u2192 2. So 2*sum(a_i) =4, but actual needed is 2. So the condition sum(a_i) <= (m-n)/2 would be 2 <= (4-2)/2 \u2192 2 <=1 \u2192 no. So that's not working.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n). Because in sample 2, 2 <= 2 \u2192 yes. Sample 3: sum is 3, m-n is 3 \u2192 yes, but the answer is no. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, so what's the correct approach here?\n\nLet me think of the problem as placing n non-overlapping intervals on a circle. Each interval for person i has length 2a_i +1. The intervals must not overlap. The total length of all intervals must be <= m. But in sample 2, the total length is 3+3=6>4. So that can't be. So how is that possible?\n\nAh, because the intervals can overlap in such a way that their combined length exceeds m, but they are arranged in a way that they fit into the circle. Wait, but how?\n\nWait in sample 2, the two intervals are 3 chairs each. But they overlap in two chairs (chair 1 and 3). So the total chairs covered by the intervals is 4 (all chairs). So the total length is 6, but the actual chairs covered is 4. So the sum of the lengths can exceed m as long as the overlapping allows the total coverage to be <= m. But how to model this?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of (2a_i +1) must be <= m + (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a greedy approach. Let me sort the a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, the minimal required is that the sum of (2a_i +1) must be <= m + (n-1). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by some research. Let me think of the problem as placing n people around the circle such that each has at least a_i chairs on each side. The minimal required is that the maximum a_i must be <= (m-1)/2. Also, the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n). Because each a_i requires a_i chairs on each side, but overlapping can reduce the total needed. Wait, but sample 2's sum is 2, m-n is 2 \u2192 okay. But sample 3's sum is 3, m-n is 3 \u2192 okay, but the answer is no. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that after sorting the a_i in non-decreasing order, for each i from 1 to n, the a_i must be <= (m - (i)) / (n - i +1). Wait, not sure. Let me think of sample 2:\n\nSort a_i as [1,1]. For i=1 (the first element, which is the largest?), no. Wait, maybe sorted in non-increasing order. Let me try:\n\nSort a in non-decreasing order. Then, for each i from 1 to n, the a_i must be <= (m - (i-1)*something)/something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's solution. The correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, the required condition is that the sum of (2a_i +1) <= m + (something). Or perhaps the sum of (a_i) must be <= (m -n)/2, and the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2. But sample 2's maximum a_i is 1, which is okay. The sum is 2, (4-2)/2 =1 \u2192 2>1 \u2192 so that would fail. But sample 2 is possible. So that's not.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of the problem as follows: arrange the people in a circle such that between any two adjacent people, there are at least (a_i + a_j) chairs. Wait, no. Because each person needs a_i chairs on both sides. So between two people, the distance must be at least a_i + a_j +1. Because each requires a_i chairs on their side. So the minimal distance between two people is a_i + a_j +1. \n\nWait, let's think of two people. Suppose person A has a_i = a, and person B has a_j = b. The minimal distance between them must be a + b +1. Because between them, there must be at least a chairs on A's right and b chairs on B's left. So the total chairs between them must be at least a + b. So the distance between their chairs must be at least a + b +1 (since the chairs are in a circle). \n\nSo for all pairs of adjacent people, the distance between them must be at least a_i + a_j +1. \n\nBut how to model this for all people?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order, then check that the sum of (a_i) + (n) <= m. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's note. The fourth test case has a_i 1,2,3. The chairs are 9. The solution is to place them at 1,4,7. The distance between each is 3 chairs. Let's see:\n\nBetween 1 and4: distance is 3 chairs (chair 2,3). The a_i for first is 1, second is 2. So required distance between them is 1+2+1=4? Wait, no. Wait the first requires 1 on each side. So between them, the distance must be at least 1 (from first's right) plus 2 (from second's left) plus 1 (their own chairs). So total distance between chairs must be at least (1+2+1) =4? But the distance between 1 and4 is 3 (since it's a circle of 9 chairs, the distance can be measured as min( (4-1), (9- (4-1)) ), but in this case, the distance is 3. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal required distance between two people is (a_i + a_j +1). So between them, there must be at least (a_i + a_j +1) chairs. So the total required chairs would be sum of (a_i) *2 + n + ... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the total required chairs must be at least the sum of all (2a_i +1) plus the gaps between them. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea from the problem's solution. The correct condition is that the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n), and the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2. But sample 2's sum is 2, m-n is 2 \u2192 okay. The maximum a_i is 1, which is okay. So that would pass. Sample 3's sum is 3, m-n is 3 \u2192 okay, but the maximum a_i is 2, which is (5-1)/2 =2 \u2192 okay. But the answer is no. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, so what's wrong with sample 3? The maximum a_i is 2, which is exactly (5-1)/2 =2. So that's okay. The sum is 3 which equals m-n. But the problem is that the second person requires 2 chairs on each side. So their required block is 5 chairs (2*2+1=5). So placing them alone would take all chairs. So there's no room for the first person. So the problem is that even though the sum is okay, the individual a_i's are too large.\n\nAh! So the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2, but also the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n). But also, the sum of the top k a_i's must be <= (m -n) - (k-1)*something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, for each i from 1 to n, the a_i must be <= (m - (i)) / (n - i +1). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's solution. The correct condition is that after sorting the a_i in non-decreasing order, the sum of the first i a_i's must be <= (m - (i+1)) for all i up to n. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible solution approach:\n\nSort the a array in non-decreasing order. Then, the required condition is that the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n), and also the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2. But sample 3 would pass both conditions but the answer is no. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, so what's the missing condition?\n\nIn sample 3, the two a_i are 1 and 2. The maximum a_i is 2, which is exactly (5-1)/2 =2. So that's okay. The sum is 3, which is equal to m-n (5-2=3). But the problem is that the second person requires a block of 5 chairs (2*2+1=5), which is exactly the total chairs. So there's no space for the first person. So the problem is that the largest a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, but there are other people. So the condition must also ensure that the sum of the a_i's excluding the largest is <= (m - (2a_max +1) - (n-1)). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that after sorting the a_i in non-decreasing order, the sum of the first (n-1) a_i's plus the largest a_i must be <= (m -n). But sample 3's sum is 1+2 =3, which equals m-n (3). But the largest a_i is 2, which requires 5 chairs. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, for each i from 1 to n, the a_i must be <= (m - (i)) / (n - i +1). Let me see:\n\nSample 2: sorted a is [1,1]. For i=1 (the first element?), no. Let me think of the sorted array in non-decreasing order. Let me index from 1 to n.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that after sorting the a_i in non-decreasing order, for each i from 1 to n, a_i <= (m - (i)) / (n - i +1). Let me see:\n\nSample 2: n=2, m=4. sorted a is [1,1].\n\nFor i=1 (the first element in the sorted array?), the condition would be a_1 <= (4 -1)/(2-1+1) \u2192 1 <= 3/2 \u2192 1.5 \u2192 yes.\n\nFor i=2: a_2 <= (4-2)/(2-2+1) \u2192 1 <= 2/1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo that would pass.\n\nSample 3: sorted a is [1,2]. n=2, m=5.\n\ni=1: a_1=1 <= (5-1)/(2) \u2192 4/2=2 \u2192 yes.\n\ni=2: a_2=2 <= (5-2)/1 \u2192 3/1=3 \u2192 yes. So the condition would pass, but the answer is no. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, so that's not the right condition.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n), and the maximum a_i must be <= (m -1)/2, and also the sum of the top k a_i's must be <= (m - (k+1)) for all k up to n. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's solution. The correct approach is to sort the a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, the required condition is that for each i from 1 to n, a_i <= (m - (i)) / (n - i +1). Let me see sample 3 again:\n\nSample3: a sorted is [1,2], n=2, m=5.\n\nFor i=1: a_1=1 <= (5-1)/(2) \u2192 4/2=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nFor i=2: a_2=2 <= (5-2)/1 \u2192 3 \u2192 yes. So the condition holds, but the answer is no. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, so what's the problem here?\n\nThe second person requires a block of 5 chairs (2*2+1=5). So placing them alone would take all chairs. But there's another person. So the condition must also ensure that the sum of all a_i's plus n is <= m. Wait, sum(a_i) +n = 3+2=5 = m. So that's okay. But the problem is that the second person's block is exactly m chairs, so there's no space for the first person. So the condition must also ensure that the largest a_i is not equal to (m-1)/2 when there are other people. \n\nWait, in sample3, the largest a_i is 2, which is exactly (5-1)/2 =2. So when the largest a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, then there can be no other people. Because placing that person would take up exactly m chairs (since 2a_i+1 =5). So if there are other people, it's impossible. \n\nAh! So the condition must also ensure that if the maximum a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, then there can be only one person. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of all a_i must be <= (m -n).\n\n2. The maximum a_i must be <= (m-1)/2.\n\n3. If the maximum a_i is exactly (m-1)/2, then there must be only one person (n=1).\n\nWait, but in sample2, the maximum a_i is 1, which is (4-1)/2 =1.5 \u2192 1 is less than that. So okay.\n\nSample3's maximum a_i is 2, which is exactly (5-1)/2=2. So since n=2>1, it's invalid. So that would make the condition work.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- sum(a_i) <= (m-n).\n\n- max_a <= (m-1)/2.\n\n- if max_a == (m-1)/2 \u2192 then n must be 1.\n\nSo combining these.\n\nSo in code:\n\nSort the array, compute sum, max_a.\n\nif (sum > (m-n)) \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a == (m-1)/2 and n>1 \u2192 no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nWait, let's test sample3:\n\nsum is 3, m-n is 3 \u2192 okay.\n\nmax_a is 2, which equals (5-1)/2 \u2192 yes. But n=2>1 \u2192 so condition 3 is violated \u2192 output no. Which is correct.\n\nSample2:\n\nmax_a is 1 < (4-1)/2 \u2192 okay.\n\nSample4: a_i 1,2,3. m=9.\n\nmax_a is 3. (9-1)/2 is 4 \u2192 3 <4 \u2192 okay.\n\nsum is 6. m-n=9-3=6 \u2192 sum equals \u2192 okay. So yes.\n\nAnother test case where max_a is exactly (m-1)/2 and n=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Sort the array to find max_a.\n\n- Compute sum.\n\n- Check the three conditions.\n\nWait, but the first condition is sum <= (m-n). The second is max_a <= (m-1)/2. The third is if max_a == (m-1)/2 \u2192 n must be 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn the else block (since n is not 1):\n\nWe need to check:\n\nif (sum > (m-n)) \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a == (m-1)/2 \u2192 then since n is not 1 \u2192 no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nWait, but what about when max_a is less than (m-1)/2?\n\nThen the other conditions are okay.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nsum = sum of a_i.\n\nmax_a = maximum a_i.\n\nif (sum > (m-n)) \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nif (max_a == (m-1)/2 and n>1 \u2192 no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nSo that's the condition.\n\nNow, looking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nsum=sum + b -c +n; // Not sure what this is. Probably a mistake.\n\nWait, in the code given:\n\nsum is initialized to 0.\n\nThen, for each a in the array, they do:\n\nsum +=a.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nInitially, sum is 0.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nfor(i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\ncin>>a;\n\nb = max(b, a); // so b is the maximum a_i.\n\nc = min(c, a); // c is the minimum a_i.\n\nsum +=a;\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, the code has:\n\nsum = sum + b -c +n; // Not sure why.\n\nWait, that line is probably a mistake. The original code's author might have been trying to compute something else, but it's incorrect.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute sum as the sum of all a_i, max_a as the maximum a_i.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo the code should:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute sum = sum of a_i.\n\nmax_a = maximum of a_i.\n\nThen check the conditions.\n\nSo in the code provided, the initial code has:\n\nsum=sum + b -c +n; // which is wrong. The sum should be the sum of a_i.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nInitially, sum is 0.\n\nThen, in the loop, they add a to sum. So after the loop, sum is correct.\n\nBut then they do sum += b -c +n. Which is adding (max_a - min_a) +n to the sum. That's wrong.\n\nSo the code's current sum is wrong. So first, we need to fix that.\n\nSo the code should have sum = sum of a_i.\n\nThen, the max_a is b.\n\nSo the code's current variables:\n\nb is the maximum a_i.\n\nc is the minimum a_i.\n\nsum is the sum of a_i plus (b -c) +n. Which is wrong.\n\nSo the first step is to remove that line.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nsum += a.\n\nThen, after the loop, sum is correct.\n\nThen, the conditions are:\n\nif (sum > (m -n)) \u2192 no.\n\nif (b > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nif (b == (m-1)/2 and n>1 \u2192 no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nSo the code's else block should have these conditions.\n\nNow, let's see the code structure.\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nelse {\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)cout<<\"YES\"<<endl;\n\nelse cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n}\n\nSo the missing code is the condition.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (sum <= (m -n) && b <= (m-1)/2 && (b < (m-1)/2 || n ==1 )) \u2192 yes.\n\nElse no.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\nif (sum > (m-n)) \u2192 no.\n\nelse if (b > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nelse if (b == (m-1)/2 && n>1 \u2192 no.\n\nelse \u2192 yes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (sum > (m -n)) {\n\n    cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n} else if (b > ( (m-1)/2 )) {\n\n    cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n} else if (b == ( (m-1)/2 ) && n>1 ) {\n\n    cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n} else {\n\n    cout<<\"YES\"<<endl;\n\n}\n\nBut since the code is in the else block (since n !=1), the third condition can be simplified.\n\nWait, in the code's else block, the n is not 1 (since the first condition is n==1).\n\nSo in the else block, n is at least 2.\n\nSo the third condition can be written as:\n\nif (b == (m-1)/2 \u2192 then no.\n\nBecause n is at least 2.\n\nSo the conditions can be:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > (m-1)/2 || (b == (m-1)/2) ) \u2192 no.\n\nWait, no. Because if b is exactly (m-1)/2, then since n >=2, it's invalid.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) \u2192 no.\n\nelse if (b > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nelse if (b == (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nelse \u2192 yes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (sum > (m -n)) {\n\n    cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n} else if (b > ( (m-1)/2 )) {\n\n    cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n} else if (b == ( (m-1)/2 )) {\n\n    cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n} else {\n\n    cout<<\"YES\"<<endl;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the case where b is exactly (m-1)/2, then even if n is 1, but in the else block, n is not 1. So yes, in the else block, if b is exactly (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code's missing condition is:\n\n(sum <= (m-n)) && (b <= (m-1)/2) && (b < (m-1)/2 || n ==1 )\n\nBut since in the else block, n is not 1, so the third condition is automatically b < (m-1)/2.\n\nWait, no. The third condition in the code's else block is that b must be strictly less than (m-1)/2. Because if it's equal, then even if n is 1, but in the else block, n is not 1, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the code's condition can be written as:\n\nif (sum <= (m-n) && b < (m-1)/2 )\n\nthen yes, else no.\n\nWait, no. Because the first two conditions are:\n\nsum must be <= (m-n).\n\nb must be <= (m-1)/2.\n\nand also, if b is exactly (m-1)/2 \u2192 then no.\n\nSo combining:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) \u2192 no.\n\nelse if (b > (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nelse if (b == (m-1)/2 \u2192 no.\n\nelse \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the code's condition is:\n\nif (sum <= (m-n) && b <= (m-1)/2 && b < (m-1)/2 )\n\nBut that's not correct. Because when b is exactly (m-1)/2, it's invalid.\n\nSo the correct condition is:\n\nif (sum <= (m-n) && b < (m-1)/2 )\n\nthen yes.\n\nElse no.\n\nWait, no. Because if b is exactly (m-1)/2, then even if sum is okay, it's invalid.\n\nSo the code's condition is:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > (m-1)/2 || (b == (m-1)/2) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nWait, no. Because when b is exactly (m-1)/2, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > (m-1)/2 || (b == (m-1)/2 && n !=1) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nBut in the else block, n is not 1, so the third term is always true when b is exactly (m-1)/2.\n\nSo the condition can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b >= (m-1)/2 )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nWait, because:\n\nb >= (m-1)/2 \u2192 includes both cases where b is equal or greater. But when b is equal, it's invalid (since n is not 1).\n\nSo yes, the condition can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > (m-1)/2 || (b == (m-1)/2) )\n\nthen no.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b >= (m-1)/2 )\n\nthen no.\n\nBecause (b == (m-1)/2) is part of b >= (m-1)/2.\n\nWait, but (m-1)/2 could be a fractional value. For example, if m is even, then (m-1)/2 is a fraction. So when comparing integers, we need to be careful.\n\nAh, right! Because m can be even or odd. So the maximum a_i must be <= floor( (m-1)/2 ), because a_i is an integer.\n\nWait, the problem states that a_i is an integer. So the maximum a_i must be <= floor( (m-1)/2 ).\n\nBecause for example, if m is 4, then (m-1)/2 is 1.5 \u2192 the maximum a_i can be 1.\n\nSo the condition is that the maximum a_i must be <= floor( (m-1)/2 ).\n\nSo in code, the condition is:\n\nb > (m-1)/2 \u2192 which is equivalent to b > floor( (m-1)/2 ), since (m-1)/2 could be a fraction.\n\nWait, for example, m=5 \u2192 (5-1)/2 =2 \u2192 so b must be <=2.\n\nm=4 \u2192 (4-1)/2 =1.5 \u2192 so b must be <=1.\n\nSo in code, the condition is:\n\nif (b > (m-1)/2 \u2192 then no.\n\nBecause if b is 2 when m=4, then 2>1.5 \u2192 yes, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the code's condition is correct.\n\nSo the code's condition can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nthen output no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nWait, but when b is exactly (m-1)/2, then it's allowed only if n==1.\n\nBut in the else block (n !=1), then it's invalid.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > ( (m-1)/2 ) || (b == (m-1)/2) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nWait, but when b is exactly (m-1)/2, then the first two conditions are not met, but the third is.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > ( (m-1)/2 ) || (b == ( (m-1)/2 )) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nBut that's redundant, because if b is exactly (m-1)/2, then the first two conditions are not met, but the third is.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b >= ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nBecause (b == (m-1)/2) is equivalent to b >= (m-1)/2 when (m-1)/2 is an integer. Wait, no. For example, if m is even, like m=4, then (m-1)/2 is 1.5. So b can be 1.5? No, because a_i is an integer. So the maximum a_i can be 1, which is less than 1.5. So when m is even, the maximum a_i can be (m-2)/2.\n\nWait, the maximum a_i must be <= floor( (m-1)/2 ), which is (m-1)/2 when m is odd, and (m-2)/2 when m is even.\n\nSo in code, the condition is:\n\nif (b > (m-1)/2 \u2192 then no.\n\nBecause when m is even, (m-1)/2 is not an integer, so the maximum a_i can be at most floor( (m-1)/2 ), which is (m-2)/2. So if a_i is (m-1)/2, it's not possible. So the condition is correct.\n\nSo the code's condition can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nthen output no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nWait, but when b is exactly (m-1)/2, then it's allowed only if n==1. But in the else block (n !=1), then it's invalid.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > ( (m-1)/2 ) || (b == (m-1)/2 && n !=1) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nBut in code, since n is not 1 in the else block, the third condition is equivalent to (b == (m-1)/2).\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > ( (m-1)/2 ) || (b == ( (m-1)/2 )) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nBut this is equivalent to:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b >= ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nthen no.\n\nBecause (b == (m-1)/2) is the same as b >= (m-1)/2 when (m-1)/2 is an integer. But when (m-1)/2 is a fraction, like 1.5, then b can't be 1.5, so the only way for b to be equal is when m is odd.\n\nWait, for example, m=5 \u2192 (m-1)/2 =2 \u2192 so if b is 2, then it's allowed only if n=1.\n\nSo in code, the condition is:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || b > ( (m-1)/2 ) || (b == ( (m-1)/2 ) && n !=1) )\n\nthen no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nSo in code, the condition can be written as:\n\nif (sum > (m-n) || (b > ( (m-1)/2 )) || (b == ( (m-1)/2 ) && n !=1) )\n\nthen output no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nSo in code, the missing condition is:\n\n(sum <= (m-n)) && (b <= ( (m-1)/2 )) && ( (b < (m-1)/2) || (n ==1) )\n\nBut since in the else block, n is not 1, the last condition reduces to (b < (m-1)/2).\n\nSo the condition is:\n\n(sum <= (m-n)) && (b < ( (m-1)/2 )) \n\nSo the code's condition is:\n\nif (sum <= (m-n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nthen yes.\n\nElse no.\n\nWait, but what about when b is exactly (m-1)/2 and n is 1?\n\nIn the first part of the code (the n==1 case), the code checks if m >= a*2+1. Which is exactly the condition for when n=1.\n\nSo the code's first part (n==1) is correct.\n\nSo in the else block (n !=1), the condition is:\n\nsum <= (m-n) and b < (m-1)/2.\n\nSo the code's missing condition is:\n\n(sum <= (m-n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nif (sum <= (m -n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nthen yes.\n\nElse no.\n\nSo putting this into code:\n\nIn the else block:\n\nif (sum <= (m -n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\n    cout<<\"YES\"<<endl;\n\nelse\n\n    cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\nSo that's the missing code.\n\nNow, let's check sample3:\n\nSample3: n=2, m=5.\n\nsum is 3, m-n=3 \u2192 3<=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nb is 2. (m-1)/2 is 2 \u2192 2 < 2 \u2192 no. So condition is false \u2192 output no. Which is correct.\n\nSample2: sum is 2, m-n=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nb is 1 < 1.5 \u2192 yes \u2192 output yes.\n\nSample4: sum is 6, m-n=6 \u2192 yes.\n\nb is 3. (9-1)/2 is 4 \u2192 3 <4 \u2192 yes \u2192 output yes.\n\nAnother test case where m=5, n=1, a=2 \u2192 a*2+1=5 \u2192 m=5 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother test case where m=5, n=1, a=3 \u2192 3*2+1=7>5 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the code's first part (n==1) is correct.\n\nAnother test case where m=5, n=2, a1=2, a2=0 \u2192 sum is 2. m-n=3 \u2192 2<=3 \u2192 yes. b is 2. (5-1)/2=2 \u2192 2 is not less than 2 \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 output no. Which is correct because the first person requires 2 chairs on each side \u2192 needs 5 chairs, but there's another person.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code's current variables:\n\nsum is the sum of a_i.\n\nb is the maximum a_i.\n\nSo in the code, after the loop, the code has:\n\nsum += b -c +n \u2192 which is wrong. So we need to remove that line.\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nsum=sum + b -c +n; // this line is wrong.\n\nSo the code should remove that line.\n\nSo the code's loop is:\n\nfor(i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    cin>>a;\n\n    b = max(b, a);\n\n    c = min(c, a);\n\n    sum +=a;\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, the code has:\n\nsum=sum + b -c +n; \u2192 which is wrong. So this line must be removed.\n\nSo the code's sum is correct after the loop.\n\nThen, the else block's condition is as above.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif (sum <= (m -n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nif( sum <= (m -n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\nSo the code's else block's condition is that.\n\nSo the final code's else block is:\n\nelse {\n\n    if( sum <= (m -n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 ) )\n\n        cout<<\"YES\"<<endl;\n\n    else\n\n        cout<<\"NO\"<<endl;\n\n}\n\nSo the missing code is the condition inside the if statement.\n\nThus, the code to fill in is:\n\nsum <= (m -n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 )\n\nBut in C++, the division is integer division. Wait, (m-1)/2 is okay as integer division?\n\nWait, in C++, when using integers, (m-1)/2 will automatically be integer division. For example, if m is 4, (4-1)/2 is 1.5 \u2192 but in integer division, it's 1.\n\nWhich is correct, because the maximum a_i must be <= floor( (m-1)/2 ), which is exactly (m-1)/2 when m is odd, and (m-2)/2 when even.\n\nSo the code's condition is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nsum <= (m -n) && b < ( (m-1)/2 )\n\nSo the code should be filled with that condition."
