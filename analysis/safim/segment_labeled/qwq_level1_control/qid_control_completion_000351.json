The current code seems to be trying to compute the answer as the ceiling of n/2. But looking at the example given: when n=5, the answer is 3. Let's see: 5/2 is 2.5, ceiling is 3, which matches. Another example: if n=2, the blocks are 1 and 1. The maximum square is 1x1, which the code would give (2/2=1). That works. What about n=3? The blocks are 1,1,2. Total area is 1+1+2=4. The maximum square would be 2x2 (area 4). The code would give ceil(3/2)=2, which is correct. Hmm, maybe the code is correct? But wait, let's think of another case. Suppose n=6. The blocks are 1,1,2,2,3,3. The total area would be 1+1+2+2+3+3 = 12. The maximum square side would be sqrt(12) ~ 3.464, so 3. The code would give 6/2=3, which is correct. Another test case: n=7. The blocks up to 7: their lengths are 1,1,2,2,3,3,4. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3+4 = 16. So the square can be 4x4. The code would compute 7/2 = 3.5, ceiling is 4. That's correct. So maybe the code is correct? Wait, but the current code uses x = n / 2, then takes the ceiling. Wait, no, the code does x = n; x = x/2; so for even n, it's exactly n/2, for odd n, it's (n)/2 which would be a float, then ceiling would round up. So for n=5, 5/2 is 2.5, ceil gives 3.

So the maximum possible side is the largest s where the sum of the first n blocks' lengths (since we can choose all up to some k, but maybe not) is >= s^2. Wait, but the sum of all blocks' lengths is the total area available. So the maximum s is the largest integer where s^2 <= sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Wait, the sum of the first n terms of ceil(i/2). Let's compute that sum. Let's see:\n\nceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n:\n\nFor i=1: 1\n\ni=2:1\n\ni=3:2\n\ni=4:2\n\ni=5:3\n\ni=6:3, etc. So the sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,... So for even i, ceil(i/2) is i/2, for odd i, (i+1)/2. The sum up to n terms can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me see, for n blocks, the sum S is sum_{k=1 to m} k * 2 terms except possibly the last term if n is odd. Wait, let's think of m as the maximum ceil(i/2) for i up to n. Since ceil(i/2) increases every two steps. For example, the first two terms (i=1,2) contribute 1 each, so total 2. The next two (i=3,4) contribute 2 each, total 4. Then 3 each for i=5,6, etc. So for m being the maximum value of ceil(i/2), which is ceil(n/2). The sum S can be written as:\n\nSuppose m = ceil(n/2). Let me see:\n\nThe sum S is 1*2 + 2*2 + ... + (m-1)*2 + (if n is odd, then add m once). Wait, let's see:\n\nLet m = ceil(n/2). Let's see:\n\nIf n is even, then n = 2m. Wait, no. Wait, for example, n=5, m is 3. Because ceil(5/2)=3. So m is exactly ceil(n/2). Let me think of n as either even or odd. Case 1: n is even. Let n = 2k. Then the terms are 1,1,2,2,...,k,k. So the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). Since m = k here (since ceil(2k/2)=k). Case 2: n is odd. Let n = 2k+1. Then the terms are 1,1,2,2,...,k,k, (k+1). So the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) + (k+1) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) + (k+1) = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. Here m = k+1 = ceil(n/2) since n=2k+1, ceil((2k+1)/2) =k+1. So the total sum S can be written as: If n is even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) If n is odd: S = ( (n+1)/2 )^2\n\nAlternatively, combining both cases, S = floor( (n+1)/2 ) * ceil( (n+1)/2 ), but perhaps there's a better way. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait for even n=2k:\n\nS = k*(k+1) = (2k/2) * (2k/2 +1) \u2192 yes. For odd n=2k+1:\n\nS = (k+1)^2 = ( (2k+1 +1)/2 )^2 \u2192 yes. So the total sum S is:\n\nS = m*(m) if n is odd (since m = (n+1)/2), but wait, no. Wait for n=5 (odd, 2k+1 where k=2), m is 3, so (k+1)^2 = 3^2 =9. Which is correct (sum 1+1+2+2+3=9). Wait, so the total sum S is m^2 when n is odd, and m*(m) when n is even? Wait no, for even n=4 (k=2), S is 2*3=6. Which is m*(m+1) where m is 2 (since m = n/2 =2). So the formula can be written as:\n\nm = ceil(n/2) \u2192 which is (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. Then, when n is even:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) \u2192 because m = n/2, so m*(m+1) = (n/2)(n/2 +1)\n\nWhen n is odd:\n\nsum = (m)^2 \u2192 since m = (n+1)/2, so m squared. Wait, but m is ceil(n/2). So m = ceil(n/2). So for even n, m = n/2, and sum is m*(m+1). For odd n, m = (n+1)/2, sum is m^2. So the total sum S can be written as:\n\nif n is even: S = m*(m+1)\n\nif n is odd: S = m^2, where m = ceil(n/2). Alternatively, combining both cases, S = m*(m + (n mod 2 ==0 ? 1 : 0)) ? Hmm, perhaps there's a better way to write this. Let me see: Wait, m = ceil(n/2). Let me see:\n\nFor even n: m = n/2 \u2192 S = m*(m+1)\n\nFor odd n: m = (n+1)/2 \u2192 S = m^2. So the total sum S is m*(m + (n even ? 1 : 0)). Alternatively, S = m^2 + (n even ? m : 0). But perhaps the key point is that the maximum square side s is the largest integer such that s^2 \u2264 S. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where s^2 \u2264 S. Since S is known, s is floor( sqrt(S) ).",

The current code computes ans as the ceiling of n/2. But according to the examples, that's correct. Wait, but let me think again. Let me see the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that the square's side length is the maximum possible such that the total area of the selected blocks is at least side^2. The blocks can be chosen any subset. So the maximum possible side is the largest s where the sum of the first n blocks' lengths (since we can choose all up to some k, but maybe not) is >= s^2. Wait, but the sum of all blocks' lengths is the total area available. So the maximum s is the largest integer where s^2 <= sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nWait, the sum of the first n terms of ceil(i/2). Let's compute that sum. Let's see:\n\nceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n:\n\nFor i=1: 1\n\ni=2:1\n\ni=3:2\n\ni=4:2\n\ni=5:3\n\ni=6:3, etc.\n\nSo the sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,... So for even i, ceil(i/2) is i/2, for odd i, (i+1)/2.\n\nThe sum up to n terms can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me see, for n blocks, the sum S is sum_{k=1 to m} k * 2 terms except possibly the last term if n is odd.\n\nWait, let's think of m as the maximum ceil(i/2) for i up to n. Since ceil(i/2) increases every two steps. For example, the first two terms (i=1,2) contribute 1 each, so total 2. The next two (i=3,4) contribute 2 each, total 4. Then 3 each for i=5,6, etc. So for m being the maximum value of ceil(i/2), which is ceil(n/2). The sum S can be written as:\n\nSuppose m = ceil(n/2). Let me see:\n\nThe sum S is 1*2 + 2*2 + ... + (m-1)*2 + (if n is odd, then add m once).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLet m = ceil(n/2). Let's see:\n\nIf n is even, then n = 2m. Wait, no. Wait, for example, n=5, m is 3. Because ceil(5/2)=3. So m is exactly ceil(n/2). Let me think of n as either even or odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even. Let n = 2k. Then the terms are 1,1,2,2,...,k,k. So the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). Since m = k here (since ceil(2k/2)=k).\n\nCase 2: n is odd. Let n = 2k+1. Then the terms are 1,1,2,2,...,k,k, (k+1). So the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) + (k+1) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) + (k+1) = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. Here m = k+1 = ceil(n/2) since n=2k+1, ceil((2k+1)/2) =k+1.\n\nSo the total sum S can be written as:\n\nIf n is even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nIf n is odd: S = ( (n+1)/2 )^2\n\nAlternatively, combining both cases, S = floor( (n+1)/2 ) * ceil( (n+1)/2 ), but perhaps there's a better way. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait for even n=2k:\n\nS = k*(k+1) = (2k/2) * (2k/2 +1) \u2192 yes.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nS = (k+1)^2 = ( (2k+1 +1)/2 )^2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the total sum S is:\n\nS = m*(m) if n is odd (since m = (n+1)/2), but wait, no. Wait for n=5 (odd, 2k+1 where k=2), m is 3, so (k+1)^2 = 3^2 =9. Which is correct (sum 1+1+2+2+3=9).\n\nWait, so the total sum S is m^2 when n is odd, and m*(m) when n is even? Wait no, for even n=4 (k=2), S is 2*3=6. Which is m*(m+1) where m is 2 (since m = n/2 =2). So the formula can be written as:\n\nm = ceil(n/2) \u2192 which is (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even.\n\nThen, when n is even:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) \u2192 because m = n/2, so m*(m+1) = (n/2)(n/2 +1)\n\nWhen n is odd:\n\nsum = (m)^2 \u2192 since m = (n+1)/2, so m squared.\n\nWait, but m is ceil(n/2). So m = ceil(n/2). So for even n, m = n/2, and sum is m*(m+1). For odd n, m = (n+1)/2, sum is m^2.\n\nSo the total sum S can be written as:\n\nif n is even: S = m*(m+1)\n\nif n is odd: S = m^2, where m = ceil(n/2).\n\nAlternatively, combining both cases, S = m*(m + (n mod 2 ==0 ? 1 : 0)) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a better way to write this. Let me see:\n\nWait, m = ceil(n/2). Let me see:\n\nFor even n: m = n/2 \u2192 S = m*(m+1)\n\nFor odd n: m = (n+1)/2 \u2192 S = m^2.\n\nSo the total sum S is m*(m + (n even ? 1 : 0)).\n\nAlternatively, S = m^2 + (n even ? m : 0).\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that the maximum square side s is the largest integer such that s^2 \u2264 S.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where s^2 \u2264 S. Since S is known, s is floor( sqrt(S) ).\n\nWait, but S is exactly the total area of all blocks. So the maximum possible square is the largest s where s^2 \u2264 S. So the answer is floor( sqrt(S) ).\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement, when n=5, S is 9 (since 1+1+2+2+3=9). sqrt(9)=3, so the answer is 3, which matches. For n=2, S is 2 \u2192 sqrt(2) ~1.414 \u2192 floor is 1. Correct. For n=3, S is 1+1+2=4 \u2192 sqrt(4)=2 \u2192 correct. For n=6, even, m=3 \u2192 S=3*4=12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3. Which matches the earlier example. For n=7 (odd, m=4), S=4^2=16 \u2192 sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 correct. So the answer is indeed floor( sqrt(S) ), which is exactly the integer part of sqrt(S). But since S is a perfect square when n is odd, and when even, it's m*(m+1), which is between m^2 and (m+1)^2. So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S) ), which is the integer part.\n\nWait, but how do we compute S?\n\nWait, the code currently computes ans as the ceiling of n/2. Let's see for n=5, that gives 3, which is correct. For n=6, ceiling(6/2)=3, which is correct. For n=7, ceiling(7/2)=4, which is correct. For n=4, ceiling(4/2)=2, which is correct (since S= 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor 2). So the code's current approach of ans = (long) Math.ceil(n/2.0) gives the correct answer. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code currently does:\n\ndouble x = n; // n is a long, but cast to double.\n\nx = x / 2;\n\nans = (long) Math.ceil(x);\n\nWait, that's equivalent to ans = (long) Math.ceil(n / 2.0). Which is exactly the same as the ceiling of n/2. But according to the previous analysis, the answer is floor( sqrt(S) ), which for the cases we checked equals the ceiling of n/2. So is that a coincidence?\n\nWait let's see for n=6:\n\nS is 12 \u2192 sqrt(12) is ~3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. The code gives 3 (ceiling(6/2)=3). Correct.\n\nn=7: S=16 \u2192 sqrt is 4 \u2192 code gives 4. Correct.\n\nn=8: even, m=4 \u2192 S=4*5=20 \u2192 sqrt(20)=4.472 \u2192 floor 4. The code gives 8/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=1: S=1 \u2192 sqrt(1)=1 \u2192 code gives 1. Correct.\n\nn=0? Not possible as per input constraints.\n\nAnother test case: n=1: code gives 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, let's see n=9 (odd). m=5 \u2192 S=5^2=25 \u2192 sqrt(25)=5 \u2192 code gives 5 (9/2=4.5 \u2192 ceil is 5). Correct.\n\nn=10 (even): m=5 \u2192 S=5*6=30 \u2192 sqrt(30)=5.477 \u2192 floor 5. The code gives 10/2=5 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, so in all these cases, the code's approach of taking the ceiling of n/2 gives exactly the floor of sqrt(S). So why is that?\n\nLet me see:\n\nWe need to prove that floor( sqrt(S) ) = ceil( n/2 )\n\nWait, let's see for even n:\n\nS = m*(m+1), where m = n/2.\n\nSo sqrt(S) = sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nThe value sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1, since m^2 < m(m+1) < (m+1)^2 ?\n\nWait m(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2?\n\nWait m\u00b2 < m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m < (m+1)^2 = m\u00b2 + 2m +1. So yes, so sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. So floor( sqrt(S) ) is m. But ceil(n/2) is m. So yes, they are equal.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nS = m\u00b2, where m = (n+1)/2. So sqrt(S) is exactly m, so floor is m. Ceil(n/2) is m. So again equal.\n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct. So the code is correct except for the loop condition.\n\nSo the problem is that the loop is not set up properly. The original code has:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nt--;\n\nn = input.nextLong();\n\n...\n\n}\n\nThe loop needs to run t times. So the loop condition should be while(t >0). So replacing the comment with \"t >0\".\n\nSo the missing code in the while loop's condition is \"t > 0\".\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nwhile(t > 0) {\n\n    t--;\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nSo the only missing part is the loop condition. The rest of the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the current code, after the while loop starts, the first line inside is t--. So the loop condition must be while(t>0). Because each iteration processes one test case, then decrements t. So the loop runs while t is positive. So the code is correct once the loop condition is fixed.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"t > 0\" in the while loop's condition."
