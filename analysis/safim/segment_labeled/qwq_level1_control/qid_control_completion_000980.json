  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. The initial b is all zeros. So, for each element in b, we can adjust it by any multiple of a_i (since adding or subtracting a_i any number of times). The key is to find the minimal steps (sum of absolute changes divided by a_i, since each step is adding or subtracting a_i once) such that the resulting b is strictly increasing.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some loops. Let me look at the code structure. The main part reads n and the array a. Then, it loops over i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, calculates a tempAns. The idea might be considering each possible \"pivot\" point, maybe where the minimal steps are determined by some condition around that index?\n\nWait, the code's inner loops are for j from i-1 down to 0 (the previous elements) and then j from i+1 to n (the next elements). The variable 'cur' is being tracked here. Let me think about what 'cur' represents here.\n\nLooking at the code's structure, perhaps 'cur' is the current minimum required value for b[j] based on the previous elements. For example, when moving backward from i, maybe we are ensuring that each previous element is less than the next one. Wait, maybe the approach is to fix the value of b[i] and then adjust the previous and next elements accordingly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute for each possible starting point (like the i-th element's value) and then compute the required steps for the rest. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me look at the code's existing conditions. For the backward loop (j from i-1 down to 0):\n\nThe code has an if statement that's missing the condition. The code inside the if block adds (cur / arr[j]) to tempAns and increments cur by 1. The else part adds (cur/arr[j] +1) and sets cur to ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is checking whether the current value can be adjusted to be just less than the next element. Let me think of the backward pass first. Suppose we are going from i backwards to 0. The 'cur' variable might represent the minimal required value for the next element (the one after j). So for each j, we need to set b[j] to be less than the next element (which is at j+1, so cur is the required value for j+1). \n\nWait, maybe the idea is that for each position j, we need to choose b[j] such that it is less than the next element (b[j+1]). The minimal steps would be determined by how much we have to adjust b[j] to satisfy this condition, given the a[j] step size.\n\nLet me think of the backward loop first. Let's say we start from some i, and set b[i] to some value. Then, for the elements before i (j from i-1 down to 0), we need to ensure that b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nSuppose we process from the end towards the start. For each j, the next element (j+1) has a certain value (cur). We need to choose the largest possible b[j] that is less than cur, but also such that b[j] can be adjusted from 0 using multiples of a[j]. \n\nWait, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of a[j] increments or decrements to reach a value that is as large as possible but still less than the next element's value. \n\nAlternatively, the steps required for b[j] would be the minimal steps to reach a value that is less than the next element's value. Let me formalize this.\n\nSuppose the next element (j+1) has a value of 'next_val'. Then, the current element (j) must be less than next_val. The best possible value for b[j] is the maximum possible value less than next_val, which is (next_val -1). But since b[j] can be adjusted in steps of a[j], the closest possible value to next_val-1 would be the maximum value less than next_val that is congruent to 0 mod a[j]? Or maybe not exactly, but the closest possible.\n\nWait, actually, the value of b[j] can be any integer (since you can add or subtract a[j] any number of times). So the possible values of b[j] are of the form k * a[j], where k is any integer (positive or negative). Wait, no, because each move adds or subtracts a_i once. So the total change is some multiple of a_i. So the final b[j] is equal to (initial 0) plus some multiple of a_j. So b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. Wait, no, because each move adds or subtracts a_j once. So the total change is an integer multiple of a_j. So yes, b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. Wait, no. Wait, each move adds or subtracts a_j once. So after m moves, the total change is m * a_j (if all additions) or -m * a_j (if all subtractions). So the total change is any integer multiple of a_j. So the final b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. Wait, no. Wait, the total change is (number of additions - number of subtractions) * a_j. So the total change is an integer multiple of a_j. So the final b[j] is equal to (initial 0) plus k * a_j, where k is any integer (positive or negative). So yes, b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. Wait, no, because k can be any integer. So the value of b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. Because k * a_j is a multiple of a_j. So yes, b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. \n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So each b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. Because every move adds or subtracts a_j, so the total change is a multiple of a_j, so the final value is 0 plus that multiple. So b[j] must be a multiple of a_j. \n\nTherefore, when building the array, each b[j] must be a multiple of a_j, and the array must be strictly increasing. \n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing multiples m_j (could be positive or negative) such that m_j * a_j < m_{j+1} * a_{j+1}, and the sum of |m_j| is minimized. \n\nHmm, so the problem is to choose m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that for all i < j, m_i * a_i < m_j * a_j, and the sum of |m_i| is as small as possible. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be trying to compute this by considering each possible \"pivot\" point. Let me see the code again. \n\nLooking at the code's loops:\n\nThe outer loop is for each i from 0 to n-1. For each i, it calculates a tempAns. The code then loops over j from i-1 down to 0 (the previous elements) and then j from i+1 to n (the next elements). \n\nThe variable 'cur' is initialized to 1 before the backward loop. Wait, in the backward loop (for j from i-1 down to 0), the code starts with cur = 1. Then, for each j, it checks some condition and updates tempAns and cur. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that for each i, we fix the value of b[i] to be 1 (since cur starts at 1?), but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to set b[i] to some minimal value and then compute the required steps for the rest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the minimal steps by considering that the current element (i) is set to a certain value, and then the previous elements must be adjusted to be less than it, and the next elements must be adjusted to be greater than it. \n\nWait, the code's backward loop (for j from i-1 down to 0) is processing the elements before i. The forward loop (j from i+1 to n) is processing the elements after i. \n\nThe variable 'cur' in the backward loop starts at 1. Let me think of the backward loop first. \n\nSuppose we are processing the elements before i. For each j (starting from i-1 down to 0), the next element (j+1) has a value of 'cur'. We need to choose the value of b[j] such that it is less than cur, and also b[j] must be a multiple of a[j]. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the minimal number of moves (i.e., |m_j| where m_j is the multiple) to reach such a value. \n\nSo for each j, the maximum possible value of b[j] that is less than cur is the largest multiple of a[j] less than cur. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let required_val be the maximum possible value of b[j] such that b[j] < cur. \n\nThe required_val is the largest multiple of a[j] less than cur. \n\nThe required_val can be written as ( (cur -1) / a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nWait, for example, if cur is 5 and a[j] is 3, then the largest multiple less than 5 is 3. \n\nSo required_val = floor( (cur-1)/a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nThe steps needed would be | required_val / a[j] |, since the initial b[j] is 0. \n\nWait, the steps are the absolute value of the multiple. So if required_val is positive, then the multiple is (required_val / a[j]), so steps are that. If required_val is negative, then the multiple is (required_val / a[j]), but absolute value. \n\nWait, but required_val must be less than cur. \n\nWait, let's see. Let me think of the steps for the backward loop. \n\nSuppose the next element (j+1) has a value of 'cur'. \n\nWe need to choose b[j] such that b[j] < cur, and b[j] is a multiple of a[j]. \n\nThe best possible b[j] is the largest possible multiple of a[j] that is less than cur. \n\nSo the maximum possible b[j] is floor( (cur-1)/a[j] ) * a[j]. \n\nThe steps needed would be the absolute value of (b[j]/a[j]). \n\nWait, but since b[j] can be negative, but the steps are the number of moves (each move adds or subtracts a_j once). So the total steps for b[j] is |m_j|, where m_j is the multiple such that m_j * a_j = b[j]. \n\nSo the steps are | (b[j]/a_j) |. \n\nSo for the required_val, the steps would be | (required_val / a_j) |. \n\nWait, but required_val is the maximum possible value less than cur. \n\nWait, let's compute required_val as ( (cur -1) // a_j ) * a_j. \n\nThen, the steps would be | required_val / a_j |. \n\nWait, but required_val could be negative. For example, if cur is 1 and a_j is 3, then required_val is 0 (since 0 <1). So steps would be 0. \n\nHmm, but in the code's backward loop, the code is doing something like:\n\nif (condition) {\n    tempAns += (cur / arr[j]);\n    cur++;\n} else {\n    tempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1;\n    cur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1;\n}\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps and adjust 'cur' to the next required value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for the previous elements such that each is less than the next. \n\nWait, let's think of the backward loop. \n\nSuppose we start with cur = 1 (the value of b[i]). \n\nThen, for j = i-1, we need to choose b[j] such that it is less than cur (which is 1). \n\nThe maximum possible b[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] less than 1. \n\nIf a[j] is 2, then the maximum is 0. \n\nThe steps would be 0 (since 0 is the initial value). \n\nWait, but the code's first step for the backward loop would be:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) {\n    tempAns += (cur / arr[j]);\n    cur++;\n} else {\n    ... \n}\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is checking whether cur is divisible by a[j]. \n\nWait, let's see. Let me think of the code's logic. \n\nSuppose the current 'cur' is the required next value (the value of the next element, which is j+1). \n\nWe need to choose b[j] such that it is less than cur. \n\nThe maximum possible b[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] less than cur. \n\nThe steps needed would be (b[j]/a[j]) if b[j] is positive, or (-b[j]/a[j]) if negative. \n\nWait, but the steps are the absolute value of the multiple. \n\nWait, the multiple m_j is (b[j]/a_j). The steps are |m_j|. \n\nSo the steps for this j would be | ( ( (cur-1) // a_j ) * a_j ) / a_j | = | (cur-1)/a_j |. \n\nWait, but (cur-1)/a_j is the quotient. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose cur is 5, a_j is 3. \n\nThen the maximum b[j] is 3 (since 3 <5). \n\nThe multiple is 1 (3/3 =1). Steps are 1. \n\nSo steps are (5-1)/3 = 4/3 = 1.333, but floor( (5-1)/3 ) = 1. \n\nSo steps would be 1. \n\nAlternatively, (cur-1)/a_j gives 4/3 = 1.333, floor is 1. \n\nSo steps are 1. \n\nSo steps = floor( (cur-1)/a_j ). \n\nWait, but in code, the code is adding (cur/arr[j]) or (cur/arr[j]+1). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps as (required_val / a_j). \n\nWait, let's see the code's first part. \n\nIn the backward loop (for j from i-1 downto 0):\n\nThe code has an if condition. Let me think of the code's logic. \n\nSuppose the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nWait, if cur is divisible by arr[j], then the maximum multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nWait, for example, if cur is 4 and arr[j] is 2, then the maximum multiple less than 4 is 2 (since 2*2=4 is not less than 4). So the maximum is 2 (2*1). \n\nSo the steps would be 1 (since 2/2=1). \n\nBut (cur/arr[j] -1) would be (4/2 -1)=1, so steps would be 1. \n\nAlternatively, if the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0), then the code would enter the else clause. \n\nWait, let's see the code's else part: \n\ntempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1; \n\nWait, in the example where cur is 4 and arr[j] is 2, then (cur/arr[j]) is 2. So adding 2+1=3? That would be wrong. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code's logic here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps to make b[j] as large as possible but still less than cur. \n\nWait, let's think of the code's code:\n\nIn the backward loop:\n\nif (condition) {\n    tempAns += (cur / arr[j]);\n    cur++;\n} else {\n    tempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1;\n    cur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1;\n}\n\nWait, the 'cur' variable here is being updated. \n\nSuppose the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nThen, in the if case, when it is divisible, then the maximum multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nThe steps would be (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nWait, but the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nHmm, that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal steps to make b[j] as large as possible but less than cur. \n\nWait, let's take an example. \n\nSuppose arr[j] is 3, and cur is 5. \n\nThen the maximum b[j] is 3 (since 3 <5). \n\nThe steps needed are 1 (since 3/3 =1). \n\nThe code's condition would check if 5 mod 3 is 0? 5 mod3 is 2, so the else clause is not taken. \n\nWait, the code's if condition is missing. Let me think of what the condition should be. \n\nThe code's if block adds (cur/arr[j]) to the tempAns and increments cur by 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is whether the current value (cur) can be achieved by the next element. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is whether the current value (cur) is achievable as the next element's value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for b[j] to be as large as possible but less than cur. \n\nThe steps would be ( (cur-1)/arr[j] ), since that's the maximum multiple of arr[j] less than cur. \n\nWait, (cur-1)/arr[j] is the quotient when (cur-1) is divided by arr[j]. \n\nSo steps would be (cur-1)/arr[j]. \n\nBut in the code, the code is adding (cur/arr[j]) or (cur/arr[j]+1). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is making a mistake here, but the problem is to figure out what the condition should be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is to track the minimal required value for the next element. \n\nWait, let's think of the backward loop. \n\nSuppose we start with cur = 1 (the value of b[i]). \n\nThen, for j = i-1, we need to choose b[j] such that it is less than cur (1). \n\nThe maximum possible b[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] less than 1. \n\nIf a[j] is 2, then that's 0. \n\nThe steps would be 0 (since 0 is the initial value). \n\nBut according to the code's logic, if the condition is met, then tempAns += (cur/arr[j]) (which is 1/2 =0.5, but since it's integer division, 0). Then cur is incremented by 1 (so becomes 2). \n\nWait, but in this case, the steps would be 0, so adding 0 is correct. \n\nThen, moving to the next j (i-2), the cur is now 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal possible value for the next element. \n\nWait, the code's 'cur' variable is being updated in each step. \n\nThe idea might be that after choosing b[j], the next element (j+1) must be greater than b[j]. So the minimal possible value for the next element (j+1) is b[j] +1. \n\nWait, that makes sense. \n\nSo, for each j in the backward loop (processing from i backwards), we need to choose b[j] as the largest possible multiple of a[j] that is less than the current 'cur' (which represents the minimal required value for the next element). \n\nOnce we choose b[j], the next element (j+1) must be at least b[j] +1. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible value for the next element (j) is b[j] +1. \n\nWait, but in the code, after choosing b[j], the 'cur' is set to the next required value. \n\nSo, in the code's backward loop:\n\nSuppose the current 'cur' is the minimal required value for the next element (j+1). \n\nWe need to choose b[j] as the largest multiple of a[j] less than 'cur'. \n\nThe steps for this j would be (b[j]/a[j]) if positive, or (-b[j]/a[j]) if negative. \n\nWait, but since b[j] is the largest possible multiple less than cur, which is non-negative? Not necessarily. \n\nWait, the initial b is zero, but we can subtract a_j multiple times. \n\nHmm, but in the code's approach, perhaps the 'cur' is being tracked as the minimal required value for the next element. \n\nLet me think of the steps again. \n\nSuppose for j, the next element (j+1) has a minimal required value of 'cur'. \n\nWe need to choose b[j] as the largest multiple of a[j] less than 'cur'. \n\nThe steps needed are the absolute value of (b[j]/a[j]). \n\nThe new 'cur' (for the previous element j-1) must be at least b[j] +1. \n\nWait, because the previous element (j-1) must be less than b[j]. \n\nWait, no, the previous element (j-1) must be less than b[j], so the next element (j) must be at least b[j] +1. \n\nWait, the elements are processed in reverse. \n\nWait, in the backward loop, we are going from i-1 down to 0. \n\nSo for each j, the next element (j+1) has a required minimal value of 'cur'. \n\nWe choose b[j] as the largest multiple of a[j] less than 'cur'. \n\nThen, the next element (j) must be at least b[j] +1. \n\nWait, no, the next element (j+1) must be greater than b[j], so the minimal possible value for the next element (j+1) is b[j] +1. \n\nTherefore, the new 'cur' (for the previous j-1) is set to b[j] +1. \n\nWait, but how is this computed in the code? \n\nLet me see the code's code again. \n\nIn the backward loop:\n\nif (condition) {\n    tempAns += (cur / arr[j]);\n    cur++;\n} else {\n    tempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1;\n    cur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1;\n}\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps and then set the new 'cur' to the minimal required value for the next step. \n\nLet me think of the case where the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nSuppose cur is divisible by arr[j]. \n\nThen, the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nThe steps would be (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nWait, but the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nHmm, that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is considering that the steps are (cur/arr[j]). \n\nWait, let's take an example. \n\nSuppose arr[j] is 3, and cur is 3. \n\nThen, the largest multiple less than 3 is 0 (since 3 is not less than 3). \n\nWait, no, 0 is a multiple of 3, but there's also 3-3=0. \n\nWait, the largest multiple less than 3 is 0. \n\nThe steps needed would be 0 (since 0 is the initial value). \n\nBut according to the code's condition (if cur%arr[j] ==0), then the code would enter the if block. \n\ncur/arr[j] is 1. \n\nSo tempAns +=1, which is incorrect. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nWait, let's try that. \n\nIn the example where cur is 3 and arr[j] is 3, then cur%arr[j] is 0, so the if condition is true. \n\nThen, the code adds (3/3)=1 to tempAns, which is wrong. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the condition is the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nWait, in the example where cur is 4 and arr[j] is 3. \n\ncur%arr[j] is 1, so the else clause is not taken. \n\nThe code would add (4/3)=1 (since integer division). \n\nThe steps would be 1 (since the maximum multiple is 3, which is 1*3). \n\nThat's correct. \n\nThen, the new cur is set to cur +1? \n\nWait, in the if block, after adding (cur/arr[j]), the code increments cur by 1. \n\nWait, in this case, after adding 1 to tempAns, cur becomes 5. \n\nWait, but the next element (j-1) must be less than b[j], which is 3. \n\nWait, no, the next element (j+1) is the current j's next, but in the backward loop, we are going from i-1 down to 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is that after choosing b[j], the next element (j-1) must be less than b[j], so the minimal required value for the previous element (j-1) is b[j] +1. \n\nWait, but in the code's backward loop, the 'cur' is being updated to the next required value. \n\nSo, after choosing b[j], the next required value (for the previous element j-1) is b[j] +1. \n\nSo, the new cur should be b[j] +1. \n\nBut how is this computed in the code? \n\nLet me see. \n\nIn the if block, when the condition is met (cur % arr[j] ==0?), then the code adds (cur/arr[j]) to tempAns. \n\nThen, cur is incremented by 1. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose cur is 3 and arr[j] is 3. \n\nThen, the maximum multiple less than cur is 0 (since 3 is not less than 3). \n\nThe steps would be 0 (since 0/3 =0). \n\nBut the code adds (3/3)=1, which is wrong. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the condition is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nWait, in the example where cur is 4 and arr[j] is 3. \n\ncur%arr[j] is 1, so the else clause is not taken. \n\nThe code adds (4/3)=1 (integer division). \n\nThe steps are correct (1). \n\nThen, the new cur is set to cur +1 (4+1=5). \n\nWait, but the next required value should be b[j]+1. \n\nIn this case, b[j] is 3 (since 3*1=3 <4). \n\nSo the next required value is 3+1=4. \n\nBut the code sets cur to 5. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's variables. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's 'cur' represents the minimal required value for the next element (j+1). \n\nWait, in the backward loop, the 'cur' starts as the value of b[i], which is 1. \n\nWait, the code initializes cur to 1 before the backward loop. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is assuming that the current element (i) is set to 1. \n\nWait, but why 1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to set the current element (i) to the minimal possible value (1?), but that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to choose the minimal possible value for b[i], but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to consider each possible i as the point where the sequence reaches a certain value, and then compute the minimal steps from there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to model the problem as follows: \n\nFor each possible i, we set b[i] to 1 (the minimal possible value?), and then compute the required steps for the previous elements to be less than it, and the next elements to be greater than it. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal steps by considering that the minimal steps would be achieved when each element is as small as possible. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires that the array b is strictly increasing. Each b[j] must be a multiple of a[j]. \n\nWe need to choose multiples m_j such that m_1 a_1 < m_2 a_2 < ... < m_n a_n, and the sum of |m_j| is minimized. \n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this greedily. \n\nLet me think of the elements in order. \n\nSuppose we process from left to right. \n\nFor each position j, we need to choose m_j such that m_j a_j > m_{j-1} a_{j-1}. \n\nWe want to choose the smallest possible m_j to minimize the sum. \n\nWait, but m_j can be negative. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible m_j such that m_j a_j > previous value. \n\nWait, but the previous value is m_{j-1} a_{j-1}. \n\nLet me think of the first element. \n\nFor the first element (j=0), there's no previous, so m_0 can be 0 (since it's the first element). \n\nWait, but then the second element must be greater than 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element can be set to the minimal possible value (0?), but then the second must be at least a_1 +1? \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nWe can represent the required condition as b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n. \n\nEach b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nWe need to choose the minimal sum of |m_i| where b_i = m_i * a_i. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the sum of |m_i|. \n\nThe constraints are m_1 a_1 < m_2 a_2 < ... < m_n a_n. \n\nThis is an optimization problem with constraints. \n\nTo find the minimal sum, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each position j, we track the minimal sum up to j given that the current value is at least some value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it greedily, choosing the smallest possible m_j given the previous constraints. \n\nLet me think of the first few elements. \n\nSuppose we have a_1, a_2, a_3. \n\nFor the first element, m_1 can be 0 (so b_1 =0). \n\nThen, for the second element, m_2 must be such that m_2 a_2 >0. \n\nThe minimal |m_2| would be 1 (if a_2 is positive, which it is). \n\nSo m_2 =1, steps +=1. \n\nThen for the third element, m_3 must be such that m_3 a_3 > a_2. \n\nThe minimal |m_3| would be ceil( (a_2 +1)/a_3 ), but depends on the sign. \n\nHmm, but this approach may not work for all cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by ensuring that each b_i is as small as possible while still being larger than the previous. \n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach. \n\nLet me think of the algorithm: \n\nInitialize previous = -infinity (or 0 for the first element). \n\nFor each i from 1 to n: \n\n   The minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than previous. \n\n   The minimal steps for this choice would be the absolute value of (b_i / a_i). \n\n   Update previous to b_i. \n\nBut this may not work because sometimes choosing a larger b_i could lead to smaller steps in the future. \n\nHmm, but since we want the minimal total steps, perhaps choosing the smallest possible b_i each time is optimal. \n\nLet me see an example. \n\nExample 1 from the problem: \n\nInput: 5 elements: 1 2 3 4 5 \n\nThe example's solution is to subtract a_1 (so m_1 =-1, steps 1), and add a_3, a_4, a_5 (so m_3=1, m_4=1, m_5=1). \n\nThe b array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. \n\nWait, but the second element (b_2) is 0. \n\nWait, the first element is -1 (a_1=1, m_1=-1). \n\nThe second element must be greater than -1. \n\nThe minimal steps for the second element would be to choose m_2=0 (since 0*2=0 >-1). Steps 0. \n\nThen third element must be >0. \n\nThe minimal steps would be m_3=1 (3*1=3). Steps 1. \n\nFourth element must be >3. \n\nm_4=1 (4*1=4). Steps 1. \n\nFifth element must be >4. \n\nm_5=1 (5*1=5). Steps 1. \n\nTotal steps: 1 (m_1) +0 +1+1+1 =4, which matches the example. \n\nSo this approach works here. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSuppose a_1=3, a_2=2. \n\nThe first element can be 0 (m_1=0). \n\nSecond element must be >0. The minimal steps is m_2=1 (2*1=2). Steps 1. \n\nTotal steps 1. \n\nAlternatively, if we set m_1 to -1 (steps 1), then m_2 can be 0 (0*2=0, but that's not greater than -3. Wait, no, the second element must be greater than the first. \n\nWait, if m_1 is -1, then b_1 is -3. \n\nThen m_2 can be 0 (0*2=0> -3). Steps 0. \n\nTotal steps 1 (from m_1) +0 =1, which is better. \n\nAh, so choosing a smaller b_1 allows the next element to have a smaller m. \n\nSo the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i (the smallest possible multiple of a_i that is greater than previous) may not be optimal. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that a greedy approach may not work. \n\nTherefore, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is needed. \n\nThe problem requires that for each i, b_i must be a multiple of a_i, and b_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nWe can model this as follows: \n\nLet dp[i][v] be the minimal steps to reach the i-th element with value v. \n\nBut since a_i can be up to 1e9, this is not feasible. \n\nHmm, so we need a smarter approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that for each position i, the minimal steps can be computed based on the previous position's value. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the previous value. \n\nSuppose we have processed up to i-1, and the previous value is prev. \n\nFor the current i, we need to choose a value b_i which is a multiple of a_i and greater than prev. \n\nThe minimal steps for this choice would be the absolute value of (b_i / a_i). \n\nWe want to choose the b_i that minimizes the total steps, considering future choices. \n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current value, but since the value can be large, we need to find a way to represent it efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track the minimal steps up to i with the current value being as small as possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily choosing the smallest possible b_i each time. \n\nWait, in the first example, that worked. \n\nIn the second example where a_1=3 and a_2=2, the greedy approach of choosing the smallest possible b_i each time would give: \n\nb_1 =0 (steps 0), then b_2 must be at least 1 (since it has to be >0). \n\nThe minimal steps for b_2 is 1 (2*0.5 is not possible, so the smallest multiple greater than 0 is 2*1=2. Steps 1. \n\nTotal steps 1. \n\nAlternatively, choosing b_1 as -3 (steps 1) allows b_2 to be 0 (steps 0), total steps 1. \n\nSo the minimal steps are the same. \n\nHmm, so maybe the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_i (the smallest possible multiple greater than previous) is optimal. \n\nWait, but in this case, both options give the same total steps. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSuppose a_1=2, a_2=3. \n\nOption 1: \n\nb_1=0 (steps 0). \n\nb_2 must be >0. The smallest multiple is 3 (steps 1). \n\nTotal steps 1. \n\nOption 2: \n\nb_1 =-2 (steps 1). \n\nb_2 can be 0 (steps 0). \n\nTotal steps 1. \n\nSame result. \n\nHmm, so maybe the minimal steps are the same regardless of the path. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by the minimal possible steps for each position given the previous choice. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be computed by greedily choosing the smallest possible b_i each time. \n\nLet me try another example where this might not hold. \n\nSuppose a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=1. \n\nThe minimal steps would be: \n\nb_1 can be 0 (steps 0). \n\nb_2 must be at least 1 (steps 1). \n\nb_3 must be at least 2 (steps 2). \n\nTotal steps 3. \n\nAlternatively, if we choose b_1 =-1 (steps 1), then b_2 can be 0 (steps 1), and b_3 can be 1 (steps 1). Total steps 3. \n\nSame result. \n\nHmm, so maybe the minimal steps are the same regardless of the path. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are always the same, and thus we can compute it greedily. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nLet me think of the general case. \n\nSuppose we have to choose m_i such that m_i * a_i > m_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the sum of |m_i|. \n\nWe want to choose the m_i's such that this sum is minimized. \n\nThe minimal sum would be achieved when each m_i is as small as possible in absolute value. \n\nTo achieve this, for each i, we can choose the smallest possible m_i such that m_i * a_i > previous value. \n\nThe previous value is m_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nSo for each i, the minimal m_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that m_i * a_i > previous. \n\nWait, but m_i can be negative or positive. \n\nHmm, but to minimize the absolute value, we want m_i to be as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo for each i, the minimal m_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that m_i * a_i > previous. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nLet prev be the previous value (m_{i-1} * a_{i-1}). \n\nWe need to find the minimal |m_i| such that m_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal m_i can be found as follows: \n\nWe want m_i to be the smallest possible in absolute value. \n\nThe minimal m_i is the smallest integer greater than prev / a_i. \n\nWait, but since m_i must be an integer, m_i must be the smallest integer greater than (prev / a_i). \n\nWait, but m_i can be negative. \n\nWait, let's think of prev as a real number. \n\nThe minimal m_i is the smallest integer m such that m * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal m is ceil( (prev + 1)/a_i ), but only if a_i is positive. \n\nWait, let me think of it as m_i must be the smallest integer such that m_i * a_i > prev. \n\nSo m_i must be greater than prev / a_i. \n\nThe minimal m_i is floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nWait, for example, if prev is 3 and a_i is 2, then prev/a_i is 1.5. So m_i must be at least 2. \n\nYes, floor(3/2)=1, so 1+1=2. \n\nAnother example: prev is 4, a_i is 3. \n\nprev/a_i is 1.333, so m_i must be at least 2. \n\nfloor(4/3)=1, so 1+1=2. \n\nYes. \n\nIf prev is negative, say prev is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen m_i can be 0 (0*3=0 >-5). \n\nSo m_i is 0. \n\nWhich is floor(-5/3) = -2 (since -5/3 is ~-1.666, floor is -2). \n\nfloor(-5/3) +1 = -2 +1 =-1. \n\nWait, but m_i can be 0 which is better. \n\nHmm, so the formula floor(prev/a_i) +1 may not work when prev is negative. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nprev =-5, a_i=3. \n\nWe need m_i such that m_i *3 >-5. \n\nThe minimal m_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that m_i*3 >-5. \n\nPossible m_i can be -1 (since -3 >-5? No, -3 is greater than -5. \n\nWait, -3 is greater than -5. \n\nWait, m_i can be -1: -1 *3 =-3 >-5. \n\nThe minimal |m_i| is 1. \n\nAlternatively, m_i=0 gives 0> -5, which is better (steps 0). \n\nAh, so the minimal m_i is 0. \n\nSo the formula floor(prev/a_i) +1 would give floor(-5/3)= -2 \u2192 -2+1 =-1. \n\nBut the optimal m_i is 0. \n\nSo the formula is not correct. \n\nHmm, so the formula needs to be adjusted. \n\nThe correct minimal m_i is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nBut to find the minimal |m_i|, we need to choose the m_i closest to zero that satisfies m_i *a_i > prev. \n\nSo the minimal m_i is the smallest integer m such that m > prev/a_i, and |m| is minimized. \n\nSo, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nBut to find the minimal |m|, we can compute m as the ceiling of (prev +1)/a_i? \n\nWait, let's think of prev as a real number. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nSo m = floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nWait, let's see with prev =-5, a_i=3. \n\nprev/a_i =-5/3 \u2248-1.666. \n\nfloor(-1.666) is -2. \n\nfloor(prev/a_i)+1 =-2+1 =-1. \n\nBut the minimal m is 0. \n\nHmm, so this formula gives -1, but 0 is better. \n\nAh, because m can be 0, which is greater than prev/a_i (since 0> -1.666). \n\nSo the formula is not correct. \n\nThe correct minimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nSo m can be any integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the smallest such m in absolute terms. \n\nSo, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i, which is the ceiling of (prev/a_i). \n\nWait, ceiling(prev/a_i) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to prev/a_i. \n\nWait, but we need strictly greater than prev/a_i. \n\nSo m must be greater than prev/a_i. \n\nThus, m must be at least ceil(prev/a_i + 1e-9). \n\nWait, perhaps m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nSo m = floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nWait, let's see with prev =-5, a_i=3. \n\nprev/a_i is -1.666..., so floor is -2. \n\nfloor(prev/a_i) +1 =-1. \n\nBut m=-1 gives -3 which is greater than -5. \n\nBut m=0 is also valid and has a smaller absolute value. \n\nAh, so the formula gives m=-1, but m=0 is better. \n\nSo the formula is not correct. \n\nHmm, so the correct approach is to find the minimal m such that m > prev/a_i, and |m| is minimized. \n\nThis can be done by considering the possible m values around prev/a_i. \n\nLet me think of prev/a_i as a real number x. \n\nWe need m to be an integer greater than x. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the integer closest to zero that is greater than x. \n\nSo, if x is negative, then m can be 0 if 0> x. \n\nFor example, x =-1.666, then m can be 0 (since 0> -1.666). \n\nSo the minimal m is 0. \n\nIf x is between -1 and 0, then m can be 0. \n\nIf x is between 0 and 1, then m must be at least 1. \n\nSo the minimal m is 1. \n\nIf x is between 1 and 2, then m can be 2. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut when x is negative, the minimal m could be 0. \n\nSo the correct formula is: \n\nm = ceil(x) if x is not an integer. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, let me think of x as prev/a_i. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nSo m = floor(x) +1. \n\nWait, let's see with x =-1.666: \n\nfloor(x) is -2 \u2192 -2+1 =-1. \n\nBut the minimal m is 0. \n\nHmm, so this formula is not working. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nSo m is the smallest integer such that m >x. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the smallest such m in absolute terms. \n\nSo, for x =-1.666, the possible m's are -1,0,1, etc. \n\nThe smallest in absolute terms is 0. \n\nSo m=0. \n\nFor x=1.2, the minimal m is 2 (since 1.2 <2). \n\nFor x=0.5, m=1. \n\nFor x= -0.5, m can be 0. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the smallest possible in absolute terms. \n\nThis can be computed as follows: \n\nIf x is negative, then the minimal m is 0 if 0> x. \n\nOtherwise, m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nWait, but when x is negative, the minimal m could be 0 or a positive integer. \n\nWait, for example, x =-2.5. \n\nThen m can be -2 (since -2 >-2.5?), no: -2 is greater than -2.5? \n\nYes, because -2 is to the right of -2.5 on the number line. \n\nSo m can be -2, which is greater than x. \n\nThe absolute value of -2 is 2, but 0 is also greater than x and has a smaller absolute value. \n\nSo the minimal m is 0. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThis can be found by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x such that m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo, the possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than x that is non-negative. \n\n- The largest integer less than or equal to zero that is greater than x. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nTo compute this, we can consider two candidates: \n\n1. The ceiling of x (smallest integer >=x). \n\nBut if ceiling(x) >x, then that's the minimal m. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut to find the one with the smallest absolute value, we can compute the following: \n\nLet m_candidate = floor(x) +1. \n\nIf m_candidate is positive, then that's the minimal m. \n\nIf m_candidate is negative, then we can check if 0 is a valid m (i.e., 0> x). \n\nIf yes, then m=0 is better. \n\nElse, m_candidate is the minimal. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nm_candidate = floor(x) +1 \n\nif m_candidate >x: \n\n   if 0> x: \n\n      then m can be 0 if 0> x. \n\n      compare between m_candidate and 0. \n\n      choose whichever has smaller absolute value. \n\n   else: \n\n      m_candidate is the minimal. \n\nWait, this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than x, and then among all such integers, choose the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThis can be done by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x such that m is closest to zero. \n\nSo, the possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest non-negative integer greater than x. \n\n- The largest non-positive integer greater than x. \n\nWe can compute both and choose the one with the smaller absolute value. \n\nFor example, when x =-1.666: \n\nThe non-negative candidate is 0 (since 0> -1.666). \n\nThe non-positive candidate is -1 (since -1> -1.666). \n\nBetween 0 and -1, 0 has smaller absolute value. \n\nSo choose 0. \n\nWhen x=1.2: \n\nNon-negative candidate is 2. \n\nNon-positive candidate is none (since x is positive). \n\nSo choose 2. \n\nWhen x=0.5: \n\nNon-negative candidate is 1. \n\nNon-positive candidate is none. \n\nChoose 1. \n\nWhen x=-0.5: \n\nNon-negative candidate is 0. \n\nNon-positive candidate is 0 (since -0.5 <0). \n\nWait, the non-positive candidate would be the largest integer <=0 that is greater than x. \n\nThe largest integer greater than -0.5 and <=0 is 0. \n\nSo between 0 and 0, same. \n\nSo choose 0. \n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nCompute the non-negative candidate: \n\nnon_neg = ceil(x) if x is not an integer. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe non-negative candidate is the smallest non-negative integer greater than x. \n\nWhich is ceil(x) if x is not an integer. \n\nWait, for x=0.5, ceil(x)=1. \n\nFor x=1.2, ceil(x)=2. \n\nFor x=-1.666, ceil(x) is -1. \n\nWait, ceil(-1.666) is -1. \n\nSo the non-negative candidate is max(ceil(x),0). \n\nWait, for x=-1.666, ceil(x) is -1, which is negative. \n\nSo the non-negative candidate is 0. \n\nThe non-positive candidate is the largest integer <=0 that is greater than x. \n\nWhich is floor(x) +1 if floor(x) +1 >x and <=0. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nTo compute this, we can consider two candidates: \n\n1. The smallest non-negative integer greater than x. \n\n2. The largest non-positive integer greater than x. \n\nThen choose whichever has the smaller absolute value. \n\nThe first candidate is ceil(x) if x is not an integer, but if ceil(x) is negative, then it's not non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the first candidate is the smallest non-negative integer greater than x. \n\nWhich is 0 if x <0. \n\nOtherwise, it's ceil(x). \n\nThe second candidate is the largest non-positive integer greater than x. \n\nWhich is floor(x)+1 if floor(x)+1 >x and <=0. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is the way to go. \n\nBut this is getting too involved for coding. \n\nPerhaps there's a simpler way. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x such that m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThis can be computed as follows: \n\nm = floor(x) +1 \n\nif m is positive, then that's the candidate. \n\nif m is negative, then check if 0 is a valid m (0> x). \n\nIf yes, then choose between m and 0. \n\nChoose whichever has smaller absolute value. \n\nElse, choose m. \n\nSo, let's code this logic. \n\nLet me try with x =-1.666: \n\nm_candidate = floor(-1.666) +1 =-2+1 =-1 \n\nsince m_candidate is negative, check if 0> x (0> -1.666 \u2192 yes). \n\nSo compare between m_candidate (-1) and 0. \n\n0 has smaller absolute value \u2192 choose 0. \n\nFor x=1.2: \n\nm_candidate =1+1=2 \u2192 positive. \n\nChoose 2. \n\nFor x=0.5: \n\nm_candidate =0+1=1 \u2192 positive. \n\nChoose 1. \n\nFor x=-0.5: \n\nm_candidate =-1+1=0 \u2192 which is non-negative. \n\nChoose 0. \n\nFor x=2.0: \n\nm_candidate =2+1=3 \u2192 but x is exactly 2.0, so m must be greater than 2.0 \u2192 3. \n\nYes. \n\nFor x=2.1: \n\nm_candidate =2+1=3 \u2192 correct. \n\nFor x= -2.5: \n\nm_candidate =-3+1 =-2. \n\nCheck if 0> x \u2192 yes. \n\nCompare between -2 and 0 \u2192 0 is better. \n\nSo this logic works. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nm_candidate = floor(x) +1 \n\nif m_candidate >x: \n\n   if m_candidate is positive: \n\n      m = m_candidate \n\n   else: \n\n      if 0> x: \n\n          m0 =0 \n\n          if |m_candidate| < m0 \u2192 no, since m_candidate is negative. \n\n          So compare between m_candidate and 0. \n\n          choose whichever has smaller absolute value. \n\n          if abs(m_candidate) < abs(0) \u2192 no, since 0 is 0. \n\n          So choose 0. \n\n      else: \n\n          m = m_candidate \n\nWait, but how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute m_candidate = floor(x) +1 \n\nthen, if m_candidate is negative and 0> x: \n\n   then compare between m_candidate and 0. \n\n   choose whichever has smaller absolute value. \n\nElse, use m_candidate. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nCompute x = prev / a_i \n\nm_candidate = floor(x) +1 \n\nif m_candidate is negative and 0> x: \n\n   m0 =0 \n\n   if m0 >x \u2192 yes \n\n   then choose between m_candidate and m0. \n\n   pick the one with smaller absolute value. \n\n   if abs(m_candidate) < abs(m0): \n\n      m = m_candidate \n\n   else: \n\n      m = m0 \n\nelse: \n\n   m = m_candidate \n\nWait, but this requires checking several conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThe minimal m can be computed as follows: \n\nm = ceil(x) \n\nif m is not an integer, then ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. \n\nSo if x is not an integer, then ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nIf x is an integer, then ceil(x) =x, but we need m> x, so m =x+1. \n\nSo the correct m is: \n\nif x is integer: \n\n   m =x+1 \n\nelse: \n\n   m =ceil(x) \n\nBut this gives the minimal m in terms of being the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut this may not give the minimal absolute value. \n\nFor example, when x =-1.666, ceil(x) is -1. \n\nWhich is better than 0? \n\nNo, because 0 has smaller absolute value. \n\nAh, so this approach would choose m=-1, but 0 is better. \n\nSo this approach is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code provided in the problem is trying to compute this in a different way. \n\nLooking back at the code's backward loop: \n\nThe code initializes cur to 1. \n\nThen for each j from i-1 down to 0: \n\n   if (condition) { \n\n      tempAns += (cur/arr[j]); \n\n      cur++; \n\n   } else { \n\n      tempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1; \n\n      cur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1; \n\n   } \n\nThe 'cur' variable represents the minimal required value for the next element (j+1). \n\nThe code is trying to compute the steps for the current j such that b[j] is the largest multiple of a[j] less than cur. \n\nThe steps are computed as (b[j]/a[j]). \n\nThen, the new cur is set to b[j]+1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is assuming that the current element's value is the largest possible multiple less than cur, and then the next element must be at least that value plus 1. \n\nLet me see with an example. \n\nExample 1: \n\nSuppose we are processing the backward loop for i=0 (the first element). \n\nWait, no, the outer loop is for each i from 0 to n-1. \n\nWait, let's take the first example from the problem: \n\nInput: 5 elements: 1 2 3 4 5 \n\nThe example's solution is 4 moves. \n\nSuppose we are considering i=0 (the first element). \n\nThe backward loop would not run (since i-1 is -1). \n\nThe forward loop would process j from 1 to 4. \n\nBut this might not be the right path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to choose the current element (i) as 1, and then compute the steps for the previous elements to be less than 1 and the next elements to be greater than 1. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to consider each possible i as the point where the sequence reaches a certain value, and then compute the minimal steps for the rest. \n\nThe code's outer loop iterates over each possible i, and for each i, it computes the steps assuming that the current element (i) is set to 1, and then the previous elements are adjusted to be less than 1, and the next elements are adjusted to be greater than 1. \n\nBut why 1? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to set the current element to the minimal possible value (1), and then compute the steps for the rest. \n\nBut this might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as follows: \n\nFor each possible i, we set b[i] to be the minimal possible value (1?), and then compute the steps required for the previous elements to be less than it and the next elements to be greater than it. \n\nThe minimal among all these possibilities is the answer. \n\nBut why 1? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to set b[i] to be the minimal possible value such that it can be the peak, and then compute the steps for the rest. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nLooking at the code's forward loop (after the backward loop): \n\nThe forward loop starts with cur=1. \n\nThen for each j from i+1 to n-1: \n\n   if (cur%arr[j]==0) { \n\n      tempAns += (cur/arr[j]); \n\n      cur++; \n\n   } else { \n\n      tempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1; \n\n      cur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1; \n\n   } \n\nThis seems similar to the backward loop's logic. \n\nThe forward loop is processing the elements after i. \n\nThe 'cur' starts at 1 (the value of b[i]). \n\nFor each j, we need to choose b[j] such that it is greater than the previous element (cur). \n\nThe steps are computed similarly. \n\nThe code's logic for the forward loop seems to be: \n\nThe current 'cur' is the minimal required value for the previous element (j-1). \n\nWe need to choose b[j] as the smallest multiple of a[j] that is greater than cur. \n\nThe steps are computed as (b[j]/a[j]). \n\nThen, the new cur is set to b[j]+1. \n\nWait, let's see with an example. \n\nSuppose cur is 1, and a[j] is 2. \n\nThe smallest multiple of 2 greater than 1 is 2. \n\nSteps: 2/2 =1. \n\nThen cur becomes 2+1=3. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: cur is 3, a[j] is 3. \n\nThe smallest multiple greater than 3 is 6 (3*2). \n\nSteps: 2. \n\nCur becomes 6+1=7. \n\nHmm, but the code's condition is checking if cur%arr[j]==0. \n\nIn this case, 3%3==0 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo the code would add (3/3)=1 to tempAns. \n\nThen cur is incremented by 1 \u2192 4. \n\nWait, but the minimal multiple is 3 (3*1=3), but that is not greater than cur (3). \n\nAh, so this is a problem. \n\nWait, the code's logic here is flawed. \n\nBecause if cur is 3 and a[j] is 3, then the minimal multiple greater than cur is 6 (3*2). \n\nBut the code's condition (cur%arr[j]==0) is true. \n\nSo it adds (3/3)=1 to tempAns. \n\nThen cur is set to 3+1=4. \n\nBut the steps should be 2 (since 6/3=2). \n\nSo the code is incorrect here. \n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is wrong. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nSo perhaps the code's logic is incorrect, and the missing condition in the backward loop is the key to fixing it. \n\nThe backward loop's condition is missing. \n\nThe code's backward loop has an if statement with a missing condition. \n\nThe code's backward loop is processing the previous elements (j from i-1 downto 0). \n\nThe code's current 'cur' is the minimal required value for the next element (j+1). \n\nWe need to choose b[j] as the largest multiple of a[j] less than cur. \n\nThe steps are the absolute value of (b[j]/a[j]). \n\nThe new cur should be set to b[j]+1. \n\nThe code's current logic for the backward loop is: \n\nif (condition) { \n\n   tempAns += (cur/arr[j]); \n\n   cur++; \n\n} else { \n\n   tempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1; \n\n   cur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1; \n\n} \n\nThe condition is likely checking whether cur is divisible by arr[j]. \n\nIf yes, then the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nThe steps would be (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nHmm, that's incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is checking whether cur mod arr[j] ==0. \n\nIf yes, then the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nSo this is off by one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps as (cur-1)/arr[j]. \n\nWhich would be the correct steps. \n\nFor example, cur=4, arr[j]=3: \n\nsteps = (4-1)/3 =1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThe code's current code adds (cur/arr[j]) \u2192 4/3=1 (integer division). \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nBut when cur is divisible by arr[j], like cur=3 and arr[j]=3: \n\nsteps would be (3-1)/3 =0.666 \u2192 floor is 0. \n\nBut the code adds (3/3)=1. \n\nWhich is incorrect. \n\nAh, so the code's logic is incorrect in this case. \n\nThe condition should be whether cur mod arr[j] ==0. \n\nIf yes, then the steps are (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nSo the condition is probably checking whether cur mod arr[j] !=0. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIf the condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0), then the else clause is executed when it is divisible. \n\nWait, let's see the code's else clause: \n\ntempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1; \n\ncur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1; \n\nIn the case where cur is divisible by arr[j], then the code would enter the else clause. \n\nFor example, cur=3 and arr[j]=3: \n\nThe else clause is executed. \n\ntempAns += (3/3)+1 \u2192 1+1=2. \n\nBut the correct steps should be 0 (since the largest multiple less than 3 is 0). \n\nSo this is also incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is really confusing. \n\nPerhaps the condition is the opposite. \n\nThe condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nThen, the if block is executed. \n\nIn the case of cur=3 and arr[j]=3: \n\nThe if block is executed. \n\ntempAns += (3/3)=1. \n\ncur is incremented by 1 \u21924. \n\nThe steps are 1, but the correct steps should be 0. \n\nSo this is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect and the missing condition is something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nThen, the if block adds (cur/arr[j]) steps. \n\nBut in the case where cur is divisible by arr[j], the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nThe steps would be (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nSo this is off by one. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is wrong, and the correct approach is different. \n\nBut since the problem requires to complete the code, I need to figure out what the missing condition is. \n\nLooking at the code's forward loop: \n\nThe forward loop's condition is if (cur%arr[j]==0). \n\nIn that case, the code adds (cur/arr[j]) steps and increments cur by 1. \n\nElse, it adds (cur/arr[j])+1 and sets cur to ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j]+1. \n\nThis seems to be correct for the forward case. \n\nFor example, in the forward loop: \n\ncur is the previous element's value. \n\nWe need to choose b[j] as the smallest multiple of a[j] greater than cur. \n\nThe steps are (b[j]/a[j]). \n\nThe new cur is b[j]+1. \n\nLet me see with cur=3 and a[j]=3: \n\nThe smallest multiple greater than 3 is 6 (3*2). \n\nSteps: 2. \n\nThe code's condition is cur%arr[j]==0 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo the code adds (3/3)=1 \u2192 incorrect. \n\nHmm, so the forward loop's logic is also incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is flawed. \n\nBut the problem requires to complete the code, so perhaps the missing condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nWait, in the backward loop's if condition, perhaps the condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nThen, the if block would be executed when cur is not divisible by arr[j]. \n\nIn that case, the largest multiple less than cur is floor( (cur-1)/arr[j] ) * arr[j]. \n\nThe steps would be floor( (cur-1)/arr[j] ). \n\nThe code's if block adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nWhich is floor( cur/arr[j] ). \n\nWhich is the same as floor( (cur-1)/arr[j] ) when cur is not divisible by arr[j]. \n\nFor example, cur=4, arr[j]=3 \u21924/3=1 \u2192 correct. \n\ncur=5, arr[j]=3 \u21925/3=1 \u2192 correct. \n\nBut when cur is divisible by arr[j], like cur=3 and arr[j]=3: \n\nThe condition is false \u2192 else clause is executed. \n\nThe else clause adds (3/3)+1 =2 \u2192 steps would be 2. \n\nBut the correct steps should be 0 (since the largest multiple less than 3 is 0). \n\nSo this is still wrong. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to assume that the current element is set to 1, and then compute the steps for the previous elements to be less than 1 and the next elements to be greater than 1. \n\nThe minimal among all these possibilities is the answer. \n\nThe missing condition in the backward loop is whether the current element can be adjusted to be just below the next element's value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nIn the backward loop's if block, when cur is divisible by arr[j], then the maximum multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nThe steps are (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nSo the code is off by one. \n\nPerhaps the code should subtract 1 in the if block's tempAns. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing condition, not to modify other parts. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nThen, the if block is executed when cur is divisible by arr[j]. \n\nIn that case, the maximum multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nThe steps are (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nSo the code is off by one. \n\nBut since the problem requires to fill in the condition, perhaps the condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nThen, the if block is executed when cur is not divisible by arr[j]. \n\nIn that case, the maximum multiple less than cur is floor( (cur-1)/arr[j] ) * arr[j]. \n\nThe steps are floor( (cur-1)/arr[j] ). \n\nWhich is equal to (cur-1)/arr[j] (integer division). \n\nThe code's if block adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nWhich is (cur divided by arr[j], integer division). \n\nFor example, cur=4, arr[j]=3 \u21924/3=1 \u2192 correct. \n\ncur=5, arr[j]=3 \u21925/3=1 \u2192 correct. \n\ncur=3, arr[j]=3 \u21923/3=1 \u2192 but the correct steps are 0. \n\nSo when cur is divisible by arr[j], the else clause is executed. \n\nThe else clause adds (cur/arr[j])+1 \u21923/3+1=2 \u2192 which is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is really tricky. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nThen, the if block is executed when cur is not divisible by arr[j]. \n\nThe steps are (cur/arr[j]). \n\nThe else clause is executed when it is divisible. \n\nIn the else clause, the steps are (cur/arr[j])+1. \n\nBut when cur is divisible by arr[j], the maximum multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j] -1)*arr[j]. \n\nSteps are (cur/arr[j] -1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j])+1 \u2192 which is wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct, but the example I'm thinking of is not the right one. \n\nPerhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nLet me think of the first example: \n\nExample 1: \n\nn=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nThe code's outer loop iterates over each i from 0 to4. \n\nLet's take i=0 (the first element). \n\nThe backward loop doesn't run (since i-1 is -1). \n\nThe forward loop starts with cur=1. \n\nProcessing j=1 (a[1]=2): \n\ncur is 1. \n\ncur%2 is 1 !=0 \u2192 if block is executed. \n\ntempAns +=1/2 \u21920 (integer division). \n\ncur is incremented to 2. \n\nThen j=2 (a=3): \n\ncur=2. \n\n2%3 !=0 \u2192 if block. \n\ntempAns +=0 (2/3=0). \n\ncur becomes 3. \n\nj=3 (a=4): \n\ncur=3. \n\n3%4 !=0 \u2192 if block. \n\ntempAns +=0 (3/4=0). \n\ncur becomes4. \n\nj=4 (a=5): \n\ncur=4. \n\n4%5 !=0 \u2192 if block. \n\ntempAns +=0 (4/5=0). \n\ncur becomes5. \n\nTotal tempAns for this i=0 is 0+0+0+0=0. \n\nBut the correct answer for this case would be 4. \n\nSo this is wrong. \n\nHmm, so the code is definitely incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is wrong, and the correct approach must be different. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nWe can model the problem as follows: \n\nWe need to choose m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that m_1*a_1 < m_2*a_2 < ... < m_n*a_n. \n\nThe goal is to minimize the sum of |m_i|. \n\nThis can be viewed as an optimization problem with constraints. \n\nTo find the minimal sum, we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each position i, we track the minimal steps required up to i with a certain value. \n\nHowever, since the values can be large, we need a way to represent this efficiently. \n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the minimal steps can be computed greedily by ensuring that each b_i is as small as possible while still being larger than the previous. \n\nThis would involve setting each b_i to the smallest possible value greater than the previous, which would minimize the steps. \n\nThe steps for each b_i would be the minimal steps to reach that value. \n\nLet me try to formalize this: \n\nInitialize previous = -infinity (or 0 for the first element). \n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1: \n\n   The minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than previous. \n\n   The steps for this choice are the absolute value of (b_i / a_i). \n\n   Update previous to b_i. \n\nThis approach would give the minimal steps. \n\nLet me see with the first example: \n\nExample 1: \n\na = [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nprevious starts at -infinity. \n\nFor i=0 (a=1): \n\nThe smallest multiple of 1 greater than -infinity is 0. \n\nSteps: 0. \n\nprevious =0. \n\ni=1 (a=2): \n\nsmallest multiple of 2 greater than 0 is 2. \n\nSteps: 2/2=1. \n\nprevious=2. \n\ni=2 (a=3): \n\nsmallest multiple of 3 greater than 2 is 3. \n\nSteps: 1. \n\nprevious=3. \n\ni=3 (a=4): \n\nsmallest multiple of 4 greater than 3 is 4. \n\nSteps:1. \n\nprevious=4. \n\ni=4 (a=5): \n\nsmallest multiple of 5 greater than4 is5. \n\nSteps:1. \n\nTotal steps:0+1+1+1+1=4. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nAnother example where the first element is set to a negative value: \n\nExample where a_1=3, a_2=2. \n\nprevious starts at -infinity. \n\ni=0: \n\nsmallest multiple of 3 greater than -inf is 0. \n\nSteps 0. \n\nprevious=0. \n\ni=1: \n\nsmallest multiple of 2 greater than 0 is 2. \n\nSteps 1. \n\nTotal steps 1. \n\nAlternatively, if we choose m_1 =-1 (steps 1), then previous is -3. \n\ni=1: smallest multiple of 2 greater than -3 is 0 (steps 0). \n\nTotal steps 1+0=1. \n\nSame result. \n\nSo the greedy approach works. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to greedily choose the smallest possible b_i each time. \n\nThe steps are computed as follows: \n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1: \n\n   b_i must be the smallest multiple of a_i greater than previous. \n\n   The steps are |b_i / a_i|. \n\n   previous = b_i. \n\nThe problem is to compute this. \n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently. \n\nThe steps for each i can be computed as follows: \n\nLet prev be the previous value. \n\nWe need to find the smallest multiple of a_i greater than prev. \n\nThe smallest such multiple is the smallest integer m such that m * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal m is ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, because m must be an integer such that m*a_i > prev. \n\nThe smallest m is ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nprev = previous value. \n\nWe need m*a_i > prev. \n\nThe smallest m is floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nYes. \n\nFor example, prev=0, a_i=2: \n\nfloor(0/2)=0 \u2192 m=1 \u2192 2>0. \n\nprev=2, a_i=3: \n\nfloor(2/3)=0 \u2192 m=1 \u21923>2. \n\nprev=3, a_i=4: \n\nfloor(3/4)=0 \u2192 m=1 \u21924>3. \n\nprev=4, a_i=5: \n\nfloor(4/5)=0 \u2192 m=1 \u21925>4. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: prev=5, a_i=3: \n\nfloor(5/3)=1 \u2192 m=2 \u21926>5. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: prev=-5, a_i=3: \n\nfloor(-5/3)= -2 \u2192 m= -1 \u2192-3> -5. \n\nBut the minimal steps would be m=0 (0> -5). \n\nAh, so this formula gives m=-1, but m=0 is better. \n\nHmm, so the formula is not correct when prev is negative. \n\nWait, the formula floor(prev/a_i) +1 gives m =-2+1 =-1. \n\nBut m=0 is better. \n\nSo the formula is incorrect in this case. \n\nThe correct m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nWhich is ceil(prev/a_i). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nprev=-5, a_i=3: \n\nprev/a_i =-5/3 ~-1.666. \n\nceil(-1.666) is -1. \n\nSo m=-1 \u2192-3> -5. \n\nBut m=0 is also valid and has smaller steps. \n\nSo the minimal m is 0. \n\nThus, the formula ceil(prev/a_i) gives m=-1, but the minimal m is 0. \n\nSo the formula is not correct. \n\nThe correct m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nWhich is the smallest integer m such that m> prev/a_i. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nThis can be written as m = floor(prev/a_i) +1 if prev is not divisible by a_i. \n\nOr m = prev/a_i +1 if it is divisible. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nprev=3, a_i=3: \n\nprev/a_i =1 \u2192 m must be >1 \u2192 m=2. \n\nBut the minimal m is 2. \n\nBut the minimal steps would be 2, but the previous value is 3, so the next must be greater than 3. \n\nYes. \n\nBut in the case of prev=-5 and a_i=3: \n\nprev/a_i =-1.666. \n\nThe smallest integer greater than this is -1. \n\nBut m=0 is also greater than -1.666 and has smaller steps. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThis is the same problem as before. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to compute the minimal m such that m*a_i > prev and |m| is minimized. \n\nThis requires considering both positive and negative m. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i with the smallest absolute value. \n\nTo compute this, we can consider the following: \n\nThe optimal m is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i such that m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nThis can be computed as follows: \n\nCompute x = prev/a_i \n\nThe candidate m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nThe minimal m is the one closest to zero among all integers greater than x. \n\nThis can be found by considering the floor and ceiling of x. \n\nThe candidate m is either floor(x)+1 or ceil(x). \n\nWait, floor(x)+1 is the same as ceil(x). \n\nYes. \n\nSo the minimal m is ceil(x). \n\nBut in the case where x is negative, this may not give the minimal steps. \n\nFor example, x =-1.666: \n\nceil(x) is -1. \n\nBut m=0 is also valid and has smaller steps. \n\nThus, the correct m is the smallest integer greater than x with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThis requires checking both ceil(x) and 0 if possible. \n\nThe algorithm is: \n\nm_candidate = ceil(x) \n\nif m_candidate is positive: \n\n   m = m_candidate \n\nelse: \n\n   if 0> x: \n\n      m0 =0 \n\n      if m0> x: \n\n          compare between m_candidate and m0. \n\n          choose whichever has smaller absolute value. \n\n          if abs(m_candidate) < abs(m0): \n\n              m = m_candidate \n\n          else: \n\n              m = m0 \n\n      else: \n\n          m = m_candidate \n\n   else: \n\n      m = m_candidate \n\nThis is quite involved. \n\nBut for the purpose of coding, perhaps the following approach can be used: \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x such that m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nThis can be computed as follows: \n\nm = floor(x) +1 \n\nif m is negative and 0> x: \n\n   then compare between m and 0. \n\n   choose whichever has smaller absolute value. \n\nElse: \n\n   m remains as computed. \n\nThis is the same as earlier. \n\nThus, the steps for each i are computed as follows: \n\nprev is the previous value. \n\nx = prev / a_i \n\nm_candidate = floor(x) +1 \n\nif m_candidate is negative and 0> x: \n\n   m0 =0 \n\n   if m0> x: \n\n      if abs(m_candidate) < m0: \n\n          m = m_candidate \n\n      else: \n\n          m = m0 \n\n   else: \n\n      m = m_candidate \n\nelse: \n\n   m = m_candidate \n\nsteps += abs(m) \n\nprev = m * a_i \n\nThis is the correct approach. \n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in the given code. \n\nThe given code's approach seems to be trying to compute this, but the backward loop's condition is missing. \n\nThe backward loop is processing the previous elements, but perhaps the code is trying to compute the steps for each possible i as the peak. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to consider each i as the point where the sequence reaches a certain value (like 1), and then compute the steps for the previous and next elements. \n\nThe missing condition in the backward loop is likely checking whether the current cur is divisible by arr[j]. \n\nThe condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nThus, the code's backward loop's if condition is: \n\nif (cur % arr[j] !=0) \n\nThen, the code's logic would be: \n\nif cur is not divisible by arr[j], then the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j])*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: cur/arr[j]. \n\ncur is then set to that multiple +1. \n\nElse, the largest multiple is (cur/arr[j]-1)*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: (cur/arr[j]-1). \n\nBut the code's else clause adds (cur/arr[j])+1. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nThen, the if block is executed when it is not divisible. \n\nThe code's if block adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nWhich is correct for non-divisible cases. \n\nThe else block adds (cur/arr[j])+1. \n\nWhich would be correct for divisible cases. \n\nFor example, when cur is divisible by arr[j], the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j]-1)*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: (cur/arr[j]-1). \n\nBut the code adds (cur/arr[j])+1. \n\nWhich is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the code's logic is incorrect, but the missing condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nThus, the missing condition is: \n\nif (cur % arr[j] !=0) \n\nSo the code's backward loop's if condition is: \n\nif (cur % arr[j] !=0) \n\nThen, the code's logic would be: \n\nif cur is not divisible by arr[j], then the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j])*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: cur/arr[j]. \n\ncur is then set to that multiple +1. \n\nElse, the largest multiple is (cur/arr[j]-1)*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: (cur/arr[j]-1). \n\nBut the code's else clause adds (cur/arr[j])+1. \n\nWhich is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's backward loop is trying to compute the steps for the previous elements to be less than cur. \n\nThe steps are computed as the number of moves needed to reach the largest multiple less than cur. \n\nThe steps are (b[j]/a[j]). \n\nThe largest multiple less than cur is ( (cur-1)/a[j] ) *a[j]. \n\nThe steps are (cur-1)/a[j]. \n\nThe code's if block adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nWhich is (cur divided by a[j], integer division). \n\nFor example, cur=4, a[j]=3: \n\n(cur-1)/3 =1 \u2192 steps 1. \n\ncur/3=1 \u2192 correct. \n\ncur=3, a[j]=3: \n\n(cur-1)/3 =0.666 \u21920. \n\nsteps 0. \n\nBut the code's if condition is (cur%arr[j] !=0). \n\nIn this case, cur%3==0 \u2192 else clause is executed. \n\nThe else clause adds (3/3)+1 =2 \u2192 which is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is wrong, but the problem requires to complete it. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nThe code's backward loop's condition is missing this. \n\nThus, the missing condition is: \n\nif (cur % arr[j] !=0) \n\nSo the code's backward loop's if condition is: \n\nif (cur % arr[j] !=0) \n\nThen, the code's logic would be: \n\nif the current cur is not divisible by arr[j], then the largest multiple less than cur is (cur/arr[j])*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: cur/arr[j]. \n\ncur is then set to that multiple +1. \n\nElse, the largest multiple is (cur/arr[j]-1)*arr[j]. \n\nSteps: (cur/arr[j]-1). \n\nBut the code's else clause adds (cur/arr[j])+1. \n\nWhich is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's forward loop's condition is correct, and the backward loop's condition is the opposite. \n\nThe forward loop's condition is if (cur%arr[j]==0). \n\nThe backward loop's condition should be the opposite. \n\nThus, the missing condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nSo the code's backward loop's if condition is: \n\nif (cur % arr[j] !=0) \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ncur % arr[j] !=0 \n\nSo the condition is cur % arr[j] !=0. \n\nThis is the most plausible answer. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ncur % arr[j] !=0 \n\nSo the if condition is checking whether cur is not divisible by arr[j]. \n\nThis would make the code's logic for the backward loop: \n\nif (cur % arr[j] !=0) { \n\n   tempAns += (cur/arr[j]); \n\n   cur++; \n\n} else { \n\n   tempAns += (cur/arr[j])+1; \n\n   cur = ((cur/arr[j])+1)*arr[j] +1; \n\n} \n\nTesting this with the example where cur=3 and arr[j]=3: \n\ncur%arr[j] is 0 \u2192 else clause is executed. \n\ntempAns += (3/3)+1 \u2192 1+1=2. \n\ncur is set to ( (3/3)+1)*3 +1 \u2192 (2)*3+1=7. \n\nBut the correct steps should be 0. \n\nThis is still incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the code's logic is correct for the forward loop but not the backward loop. \n\nThe forward loop's condition is correct. \n\nThe backward loop's condition should be the opposite. \n\nThus, the missing condition is (cur % arr[j] ==0). \n\nTesting this: \n\ncur=3 and arr[j]=3: \n\ncur%arr[j]==0 \u2192 if condition is false \u2192 else clause is executed. \n\nElse clause adds (3/3)+1 \u2192 2. \n\nStill incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the code's backward loop is trying to compute the steps for the previous elements to be less than cur. \n\nThe steps are computed as the number of moves needed to reach the largest multiple less than cur. \n\nThe largest multiple less than cur is ( (cur-1)/a[j] ) *a[j]. \n\nThe steps are (cur-1)/a[j]. \n\nThe code's if block adds (cur/arr[j]). \n\nWhich is (cur divided by a[j], integer division). \n\nFor example, cur=4, a[j]=3: \n\n(cur-1)/3 =1 \u2192 steps 1. \n\ncur/3=1 \u2192 correct. \n\ncur=3, a[j]=3: \n\n(cur-1)/3 =0.666 \u21920. \n\nsteps 0. \n\nBut the code's if condition is (cur%arr[j] !=0). \n\nIn this case, cur%3==0 \u2192 else clause is executed. \n\nElse clause adds (3/3)+1 \u21922. \n\nWhich is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut since the problem requires to complete the code, perhaps the missing condition is (cur % arr[j] !=0). \n\nThis is the most plausible answer based on the forward loop's condition. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ncur % arr[j] !=0 \n\nSo the condition is cur % arr[j] !=0. \n\nThis is the answer."
