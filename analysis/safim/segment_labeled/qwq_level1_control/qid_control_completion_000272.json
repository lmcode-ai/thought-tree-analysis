Let me see:\n\nSuppose previous bitmask0 has a's bit set (4). If a's current bit is equal to the current character (ch), then the new a's bit is set. So, the mask for a is 4 if (a_bit == (ch is '1')), else 0. Similarly for b and c. So the mask for the new_tight is ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) ) Then, new_tight = (bitmask0) & (mask). Wait, no.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this C# code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem statement again. The task is to count the number of triples (a, b, c) where each is between 0 and n inclusive, such that the XORs of a^b, b^c, and a^c form the sides of a non-degenerate triangle. The answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to be using some dynamic programming approach with bitmask states. Let me look at the code structure. The main function reads the binary string and calls GetRes. The GetRes function initializes some arrays cur and next, which are 8x8 arrays. The loops over each character in the binary string, and for each bit, it updates the next state based on the current bit and some conditions.\n\nLooking at the code's inner loop, there's a part where they check if the current character is '0' and if (m & bitmask0) is non-zero, then they skip. Then there's a condition where they might set index to m & bitmask0, but the code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\".\n\nWait, the code is trying to track some state transitions as they process each bit of the binary number. The variables a, b, c here probably represent the bits of a, b, c at the current position. The flag variable is set based on m, which is a 3-bit mask (since m ranges from 0 to 7). The flag is used to track some condition related to the triangle inequality?\n\nThe problem requires that a^b, b^c, and a^c form a valid triangle. Let me recall that for three numbers x, y, z to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two must be greater than the third. Since XOR is involved, maybe there's a way to model the bits of a, b, c such that the XORs satisfy the triangle conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that the three XORs must satisfy x + y > z, etc. But since XOR is involved, maybe there's a way to find conditions on a, b, c such that their XORs meet the triangle inequalities. Let me think: the three XORs are x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. Notice that x^y^z = (a^b) ^ (b^c) ^ (a^c) = 0, so they must form a triangle where the sum of any two is greater than the third. Wait, but how do these XORs relate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle condition can be simplified. Let me note that x + y > z, etc. Since x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. Let me see if there's a relationship between these variables. For example, x + y = (a^b) + (b^c). Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, note that x, y, z must satisfy that the largest of them is less than the sum of the other two. So the maximum of the three must be less than the sum of the other two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find triples (a, b, c) such that the three XORs satisfy the triangle conditions. Let me think of the XORs in terms of a, b, c. Let me note that a^b^c is equal to (a^b) ^ c, but maybe that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed. Let me note that a^b = (a XOR b), and similarly for the others. Let me also note that a^b XOR b^c = a^c, so the three XORs are related. Wait, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle condition can be rephrased. Let me think of the three numbers x, y, z as the XORs. The triangle conditions are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x. Since all are non-negative, the first two conditions imply the third if the first two are true. Wait, no. Let me see: if x + y > z and x + z > y, then adding them gives 2x + y + z > y + z \u2192 2x >0, which is always true if x is positive. But actually, the three conditions are all required. However, perhaps the maximum of the three must be less than the sum of the other two. So, the maximum of x, y, z must be less than the sum of the other two. So, if the maximum is, say, x, then x < y + z. Since x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. Hmm, but how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to express the conditions. Let me note that x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. Let me see that x^y = a^b ^ b^c = a^c = z. So x^y = z. Similarly, x^z = (a^b) ^ (a^c) = b^c = y, and y^z = x. So the three variables are related through XOR. This might be a key point. \n\nNow, the triangle conditions must hold for x, y, z. Let me think of the three variables as x, y, z. Since they are related via XOR, perhaps there's a way to find conditions on a, b, c such that the triangle inequalities are satisfied. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the bits of a, b, c. Since the numbers can be up to 2^200000, we need an O(n) solution where n is the length of the binary string. The code provided seems to be using a dynamic programming approach where each state tracks some bits of a, b, c up to the current position. \n\nLooking at the code's variables:\n\nThe code uses a DP table with cur and next arrays. Each is an 8x8 array. The indices bitmask0 and bitmask1 probably represent some state. The m variable is a 3-bit mask (since m ranges from 0 to 7), which might represent the current bits of a, b, c. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, for each m (from 0 to 7), they split m into a, b, c bits (since m is 3 bits). For example, m=3 is 0b11, so a = (3 >> 2) &1 \u2192 0, b = (3 >>1)&1 \u2192 1, c = 1. Wait, no, m is 3 (binary 011?), wait, m is a 3-bit number. Let me see:\n\nWait, m is a 3-bit number. So for m, the bits are a (the highest bit?), then b, then c. Wait, the code does:\n\na = m >> 2 & 1 \u2192 so the first bit (since m is 3 bits, so bits 2,1,0). So a is the first bit (bit 2), b is bit 1, c is bit 0. So m is a 3-bit number where a is the first bit, b the second, c the third. \n\nThen, the code computes a flag based on m. The flag is set to 0,1,2,4 depending on m. The cases are:\n\ncase 3 (0b11) \u2192 flag 4?\n\nWait, let me see the code's switch statement:\n\ncase 3: case4 \u2192 flag=4.\n\ncase 2,5 \u2192 flag=2.\n\ncase1,6 \u2192 flag=1.\n\ndefault (0?) \u2192 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the flag is tracking some condition related to the current bits. Maybe the flag is part of the state that accumulates some condition over the bits. \n\nThe next part of the code loops over bitmask0 and bitmask1. The current DP state is cur[bitmask0][bitmask1], and they are trying to compute next[index][bitmask1 | flag]. \n\nThe problem is in the line where the code says:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n{\n    index = m & bitmask0;\n}\n\nSo the code is trying to decide whether to set index to m & bitmask0 or keep it as bitmask0. The condition here is missing. \n\nThe code's logic is processing each bit of the binary string. For each bit, they consider all possible m (the current bits of a, b, c?), and then update the DP states. \n\nThe variables a, b, c here are the bits of a, b, c at the current position. The current bitmask0 and bitmask1 are part of the DP state. \n\nWait, perhaps the DP state is tracking some information about the bits of a, b, c up to the current position. The bitmask0 and bitmask1 might represent some aggregated information. \n\nAlternatively, the DP is tracking the possible combinations of the bits of a, b, c such that the constraints are maintained. The flag might be part of a condition that needs to be tracked. \n\nThe problem is that the code is trying to compute the next state's index based on whether some condition is met. The missing condition is probably related to whether the current bit can be set or not, given the constraints of the problem. \n\nLooking at the code's earlier check: \n\nif (ch == '0' && ( (m & bitmask0) >0 )) \u2192 continue;\n\nThis suggests that when the current bit is 0, and the combination of m and bitmask0 has a 1 in some position, then this path is invalid. So perhaps m represents the bits of a, b, c at this position, and bitmask0 is part of the state that tracks previous constraints. \n\nWait, perhaps the bitmask0 and bitmask1 are masks that track certain conditions. For example, bitmask0 could track the bits of a, b, c up to the current position, but in a way that allows transitions. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to model the bits of a, b, c such that the final numbers are \u2264n. Since n is given in binary, the DP must ensure that the constructed a, b, c do not exceed n's bits. \n\nThe standard approach for counting numbers up to a given binary number is to track whether the current prefix is already less than the prefix of n, allowing the remaining bits to be anything. But here, since there are three variables a, b, c, the state might need to track the constraints for all three numbers. \n\nHmm, perhaps the bitmask0 and bitmask1 are part of a state that tracks the tightness of the constraints for a, b, c compared to n. For example, bitmask0 could represent the tightness for a, b, c in some way. \n\nAlternatively, the code's DP state is designed to track the possible combinations of the bits of a, b, c such that they are all \u2264n. The transitions must ensure that the bits chosen for a, b, c do not exceed the corresponding bits in n. \n\nThe current code's approach is for each bit position, considering all possible m (the bits of a, b, c at this position), and then updating the DP states. The 'flag' variable might be part of a condition that needs to be accumulated. \n\nThe missing condition in the TODO line is probably checking whether the current bit's choice (m) is allowed given the previous state (bitmask0). \n\nWait, the code has a line where if the current character is '0', and (m & bitmask0) is non-zero, then it skips. The (m & bitmask0) part might be checking if the current m's bits are allowed given the previous state. \n\nAlternatively, the bitmask0 might represent some mask that restricts the possible m's. For example, if the previous state's bitmask0 has certain bits set, then m must not have those bits set. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the next index as m & bitmask0, but only under certain conditions. The condition is probably whether the current bit is being set to 1, and whether that is allowed given the previous state. \n\nWait, the code's current line is:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n{\n    index = m & bitmask0;\n}\n\nElse, it remains as bitmask0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether the current bit is the same as the bit in n. For example, when the current bit is '1', then the next state can choose to set the bits of a, b, c to any combination, but if the current bit is '0', then the bits of a, b, c must not exceed the current bit. \n\nAlternatively, the bitmask0 might track whether the previous bits have already been less than n's bits. So, if the previous state was already \"less than\", then the current bits can be anything. But if it's still \"tight\", then the current bits must not exceed the current bit of n. \n\nIn that case, the bitmask0 could be a mask that represents the tightness for a, b, c. For example, each bit in the mask could represent whether the corresponding number (a, b, c) is still tight. \n\nWait, perhaps the bitmask0 is a 3-bit mask where each bit indicates whether the corresponding number (a, b, c) is still tight (i.e., so far equal to n's bits). For example, if the first bit is set, then a is still tight, so the next bits can't exceed n's bits. \n\nIn that case, when processing a bit, if the current bit of n is 0, then any of a, b, c that are still tight must have their current bit set to 0. Otherwise, they can be 0 or 1. \n\nSo, for each m (the bits of a, b, c at this position), the code checks if the current bit is '0', and if any of the bits in m that are set in the tight mask (bitmask0) would exceed the current bit. \n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (ch == '0' && ( (m & bitmask0) >0 )) \u2192 continue;\n\nAh, here, m & bitmask0 would be non-zero if any of the bits in m that are in the tight positions (bitmask0) are set. Since the current bit is 0, those bits can't be set, so such m's are invalid and skipped. \n\nSo, the bitmask0 represents the tightness for a, b, c. For example, if bitmask0 has a bit set for a, then a must not exceed the current bit of n. \n\nNow, the next part is the condition for the TODO line. The code is trying to compute the next index (bitmask0's next state). \n\nThe current index is either bitmask0 or m & bitmask0. \n\nWait, perhaps the next state's tightness is determined by whether the current bits of a, b, c are equal to the current bit of n. \n\nSuppose the current bit of n is 'b'. For each of a, b, c:\n\n- If the previous tightness (bitmask0) for that number was set, then the current bit must be \u2264 b. \n\n- If the current bit is set to something less than b, then the tightness for that number becomes 0 (no longer tight). \n\n- If it's equal to b, then the tightness remains. \n\nSo, the new tightness for each of a, b, c is (previous tightness) AND (current bit == b). \n\nTherefore, the new bitmask0 would be a mask where each bit is set only if the previous was set and the current bit equals the n's bit. \n\nWait, but how is this represented in the code? \n\nThe current code's m is the bits of a, b, c (a is the first bit, then b, then c). The current character is the current bit of n (ch). \n\nSuppose the current bit of n is 'ch' (either '0' or '1'). \n\nFor each of a, b, c's bits (a_bit, b_bit, c_bit):\n\nThe new tightness for a is (previous tightness for a) AND (a_bit == ch). \n\nSimilarly for b and c. \n\nThe new bitmask0 would be a 3-bit mask where each bit is 1 if the corresponding number (a, b, c) is still tight. \n\nSo, the new bitmask0 is ( ( ( (a_bit == ch) ? (prev_a_tight) : 0 ) << 2 ) | ( ( (b_bit == ch) ? (prev_b_tight) : 0 ) << 1 ) | ( ( (c_bit == ch) ? (prev_c_tight) : 0 ) ) ) )\n\nBut how is this computed in the code?\n\nThe code has a variable 'm' which is the current bits of a, b, c (a is the first bit, etc). The previous tightness is stored in bitmask0. \n\nThe new tightness for each of a, b, c is (bitmask0's bit for a) AND (a_bit == current_bit). \n\nWait, the current_bit is ch (the current character). \n\nSo, for each of a, b, c:\n\nnew_tight_a = ( (bitmask0 & 4) !=0 ) && (a_bit == (ch == '1') ? 1 : 0 )\n\nWait, a_bit is the a's bit (from m's a). \n\nWait, the a_bit is (m >>2) &1. \n\nSo, for each of a, b, c's bits (a_bit, b_bit, c_bit):\n\nThe new tightness for a is ( (bitmask0 has a's bit set) ) && (a_bit == (ch is '1') ? 1 : 0 )\n\nSimilarly for b and c. \n\nThe new bitmask0 is the combination of these three bits. \n\nSo, the new bitmask0 can be computed as:\n\nnew_tight = 0;\n\nif ( (bitmask0 & 4) !=0 ) { // a was tight before\n\n    if (a_bit == (ch == '1' ? 1 :0 )) {\n\n        new_tight |=4;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for b and c. \n\nAlternatively, the new_tight can be written as ( ( ( ( (bitmask0 &4) !=0 ) && (a_bit == (ch == '1') ?1:0 )) ?4 :0 ) | ( ... for b and c ... ) )\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nAlternatively, the new_tight can be computed as ( (bitmask0 & ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ? 4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ? 2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ? 1 :0 ) )) )\n\nWait, perhaps the new_tight is (bitmask0 & ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )) \n\nWait, let me think: \n\nFor each of a, b, c:\n\nIf the previous tightness (bitmask0's bit) is set, then the new tightness is set only if the current bit equals the current character's bit. \n\nSo, for a's bit in the new_tight:\n\nif (bitmask0 has a's bit set) and (a_bit == (ch is '1')), then set a's bit in new_tight. \n\nSo, the new_tight can be written as:\n\nnew_tight = 0;\n\nif ( (bitmask0 &4)!=0 && (a_bit == (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ) new_tight |=4;\n\nif ( (bitmask0 &2)!=0 && (b_bit == (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ) new_tight |=2;\n\nif ( (bitmask0 &1)!=0 && (c_bit == (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ) new_tight |=1;\n\nSo, the new_tight is the bitwise AND of the previous bitmask0 and the mask where each bit is set only if the current bit matches the n's bit. \n\nWait, the mask for each bit is ( (bit was tight before) AND (current bit equals n's bit) ). \n\nAlternatively, the new_tight can be computed as (bitmask0 & ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )) \n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose previous bitmask0 has a's bit set (4). \n\nIf a's current bit is equal to the current character (ch), then the new a's bit is set. \n\nSo, the mask for a is 4 if (a_bit == (ch is '1')), else 0. \n\nSimilarly for b and c. \n\nSo the mask for the new_tight is ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nThen, new_tight = (bitmask0) & (mask). \n\nWait, no. Because the new_tight's bits are set only if the previous was set AND the current condition holds. \n\nWait, the mask is the bits where the current bits match the n's bit. \n\nThe new_tight is (bitmask0) & (mask). \n\nWait, for example, if previous bitmask0 has a's bit set (4), and the current a's bit equals the n's bit (so mask has a's bit set), then the new a's bit is set. \n\nIf previous was set but the current a's bit doesn't match, then the mask's a bit is 0, so the new a's bit is 0. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo the mask is ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nThen new_tight = (bitmask0) & mask. \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be written as ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nSo, the new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nTherefore, the code's index variable is being set to this new_tight. \n\nWait, in the code, the line is:\n\nif(/* condition */)\n\n    index = m & bitmask0;\n\nElse, it remains as bitmask0. \n\nWait, but according to the above, the new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the new_tight as (bitmask0 & mask), but the mask is ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ... ), which can be written as ( ( (a_bit ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) etc. \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be written as ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nSo, the mask is ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ... )\n\nWait, but how to compute this in code? \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be computed as ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint mask = 0;\n\nif (a_bit == (ch == '1')) mask |=4;\n\nif (b_bit == (ch == '1')) mask |=2;\n\nif (c_bit == (ch == '1')) mask |=1;\n\nThen new_tight = (bitmask0 & mask);\n\nSo, the new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nTherefore, the code's line where index is set to m & bitmask0 is incorrect. Wait, but in the code's current line, the code is setting index to m & bitmask0. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the variables. Let me re-express:\n\nWait, the code's variables a, b, c are the bits of a, b, c at this position. \n\nThe mask0 is the previous tightness mask. \n\nThe new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask), where mask is the mask computed as above. \n\nSo, the new_tight is the new bitmask0 for the next state. \n\nTherefore, the code's index variable should be set to new_tight. \n\nBut in the code, the line is:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) {\n\n    index = m & bitmask0;\n\n}\n\nElse, it remains as bitmask0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the new_tight as (bitmask0 & mask), but the mask is ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ... ), which can be written as ( ( (a_bit ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) etc. \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be written as ( ( (a_bit ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) | ... \n\nWait, but how to compute this in code? \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be written as ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nSo, the mask is the bits where the current a, b, c bits match the current n's bit. \n\nTherefore, the new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nSo, the code's index should be set to (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nBut in the code's current line, the code is setting index to m & bitmask0. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the code's variables a, b, c are the bits of a, b, c at this position. \n\nThe mask0 is the previous tightness mask. \n\nThe new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask), where mask is the mask of bits where the current bits of a, b, c equal the current n's bit. \n\nSo, the new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nTherefore, the code's index should be set to (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nBut how is this computed in the code? \n\nThe code has variables a, b, c (the bits of a, b, c at this position). \n\nThe current character is ch (the current bit of n). \n\nThe mask can be computed as:\n\nint mask = 0;\n\nif (a == (ch == '1')) mask |=4;\n\nif (b == (ch == '1')) mask |=2;\n\nif (c == (ch == '1')) mask |=1;\n\nThen new_tight = (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nTherefore, the code's line where index is set to m & bitmask0 is incorrect. \n\nWait, but the code's current line is:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) {\n\n    index = m & bitmask0;\n\n}\n\nElse, it remains as bitmask0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the new_tight as (bitmask0 & mask), but the mask is ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ... ), which can be written as ( ( (a_bit ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) etc. \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be written as ( ( (a_bit ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) | ... \n\nWait, but how to compute this in code? \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be written as ( ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b_bit == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c_bit == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nSo, the mask is ( (a_bit == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ... \n\nTherefore, the new_tight is (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nSo, the code's line should set index to (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nBut how to compute this in the code's current structure? \n\nThe code has variables a, b, c (the bits of a, b, c at this position). \n\nThe current character is ch. \n\nSo, the mask can be computed as:\n\nint mask = 0;\n\nif (a == (ch == '1')) mask |=4;\n\nif (b == (ch == '1')) mask |=2;\n\nif (c == (ch == '1')) mask |=1;\n\nThen, new_tight = (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nTherefore, the code's line should be:\n\nindex = (bitmask0 & mask);\n\nBut in the code's current structure, the code is trying to compute this via m & bitmask0. \n\nWait, m is the 3-bit value of a, b, c. \n\nWait, m is a 3-bit number where a is the first bit (bit 2), b is bit 1, c is bit 0. \n\nSo, m is (a << 2) | (b <<1) | c. \n\nWait, no, a is (m >>2) &1, so m is a*4 + b*2 + c*1. \n\nSo, the mask is ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 )\n\nWhich can be written as ( ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nThis is exactly the same as ( ( (a ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) | ... \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be written as ( ( (a ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) | ( ( (b ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?2 :0 ) | ( ( (c ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?1 :0 )\n\nSo, the mask is ( ( (a ^ (ch == '1' ?1:0)) ==0 ) ?4 :0 ) | ... \n\nWait, but how to compute this in code? \n\nAlternatively, the mask can be computed as ( ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint mask = 0;\n\nif (a == (ch == '1')) mask |=4;\n\nif (b == (ch == '1')) mask |=2;\n\nif (c == (ch == '1')) mask |=1;\n\nThen, new_tight = (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nTherefore, the code's line should set index to (bitmask0 & mask). \n\nBut in the code's current structure, the code is using m & bitmask0. \n\nWait, m is a 3-bit number where a is the first bit (bit 2), so m's bits are a, b, c. \n\nWait, the mask is ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ... \n\nWhich is exactly the same as ( (a == (ch == '1')) ? (4) :0 ) + ( (b == (ch == '1')) ? (2) :0 ) + ( (c == (ch == '1')) ? (1) :0 )\n\nSo, the mask is ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 )\n\nWhich can be written as ( ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) )\n\nBut m is a 3-bit number where a is the first bit (bit 2), so m is a*4 + b*2 + c*1. \n\nWait, so m is exactly the value of a, b, c's bits. \n\nWait, the mask is the bits where a, b, c's current bits equal the current n's bit. \n\nSo, the mask is ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 )\n\nWhich is exactly the same as ( ( (a == (ch == '1')) ? a_bit :0 ) << 2 ) | ( ( (b == (ch == '1')) ? b_bit :0 ) <<1 ) | ( ( (c == (ch == '1')) ? c_bit :0 ) <<0 )\n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the bits where the current a, b, c bits match the current n's bit. \n\nSo, for each of a, b, c:\n\nif their current bit equals the n's current bit (ch), then the corresponding bit in the mask is set. \n\nSo, the mask is ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 )\n\nWhich is exactly the same as ( ( (a == (ch == '1')) ? 1 :0 ) <<2 ) | ( ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<1 ) | ( ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<0 )\n\nWait, no. Because 4 is 100, so the a's bit in the mask is set to 1 if a's current bit matches. \n\nWait, the mask is a 3-bit number where each bit indicates whether the corresponding a, b, c's current bit matches the n's current bit. \n\nSo, the mask is ( ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<2 ) | ( ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<1 ) | ( ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<0 )\n\nWait, no, that would be a 3-bit number where each bit is 1 if the corresponding bit matches. \n\nWait, for example, if a's bit matches, then the first bit (bit 2) is set to 1. \n\nSo, the mask is ( ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<2 ) | ( ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<1 ) | ( ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 ) <<0 )\n\nWhich is exactly the same as ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) + ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) + ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 )\n\nSo, the mask is exactly equal to ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 )\n\nBut m is the current a, b, c bits. \n\nWait, m is a 3-bit number where a is the first bit (bit 2), so m is exactly a*4 + b*2 + c*1. \n\nWait, so m is exactly the value of the current a, b, c bits. \n\nWait, but the mask is the bits where a, b, c's current bits match the current n's bit. \n\nSo, the mask is ( (a == (ch == '1')) ?4 :0 ) | ( (b == (ch == '1')) ?2 :0 ) | ( (c == (ch == '1')) ?1 :0 )\n\nWhich is exactly the same as m if the current bits of a, b, c are exactly equal to the n's current bit. \n\nWait, no. For example, if the current bit of n is '1', and a's bit is 1, then the a's contribution to the mask is 4. \n\nBut m's a bit is 1, so m has 4. \n\nSo, in this case, the mask would have 4 set if a's bit equals the current n's bit. \n\nSo, the mask is exactly the bits of m where the current a, b, c bits match the n's current bit. \n\nWait, no. Because if a's bit is 1 and the current n's bit is 1, then the mask's a bit is set. \n\nSo, the mask is the bits of m where the current a, b, c bits match the n's current bit. \n\nWait, no. The mask is a 3-bit number where each bit is set if the corresponding a, b, c bit matches the current n's bit. \n\nSo, the mask is exactly the same as m if the current a, b, c bits are exactly equal to the n's current bit. \n\nWait, no. For example, if the current n's bit is 1, and a's bit is 1, then the a's bit in the mask is set (4). \n\nBut if the current n's bit is 0, then a's bit must be 0 to have the mask's a bit set. \n\nSo, the mask is the bits of m where the current a, b, c bits match the current n's bit. \n\nWait, no. The mask is the bits of m where the current a, b, c bits match the current n's bit. \n\nWait, no. The mask is the bits of m where the current a, b, c bits match the current n's bit. \n\nWait, no.
