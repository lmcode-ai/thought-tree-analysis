So the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nint i = 0; i < tc; i++\n\nSo putting that into the for loop. That's all. The rest of the code seems okay. Let me check the division logic. The code uses a switch expression. Let's see:\n\nvar d = r switch {\n    >=1900 => 1,\n    >=1600 =>2,\n    >=1400 =>3,\n    _ =>4\n}; Wait, the divisions are:\n\nDivision1: 1900 and above \u2192 correct, that's the first case. Division2 is 1600-1899. So if the rating is >=1600 but less than 1900, then division 2. The switch's next case is >=1600, which would catch that. Because after the first case (>=1900) isn't matched, it moves to the next. Then division3 is 1400-1599. The next case is >=1400 \u2192 which would trigger for 1400 up to 1599, since the previous case (>=1600) would have been higher. Wait, no. Wait, 1600 is higher than 1400. Wait, the order here is important. Because in a switch expression with patterns, the order matters. Let me think:\n\nThe switch evaluates the conditions in order. So first, if r >=1900 \u2192 1.\n\nElse, check if r >=1600 \u2192 2.\n\nElse check if r >=1400 \u21923. Else, 4. So for a value like 1700, it would hit the second case (>=1600 \u2192 division 2, which is correct. For 1500, it would go to the third case (>=1400 \u2192 division3, correct. For 1399, it would not hit any of the first three, so division4. Correct. So the division logic is correct.",
