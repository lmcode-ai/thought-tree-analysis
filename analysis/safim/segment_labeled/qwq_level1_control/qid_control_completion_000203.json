So the missing part is the loop's header. \n\nYes, so the answer is the for loop's header line. \n\nTherefore, the code to fill in is:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n; j++) {\n\nWait, but the code in the problem's code has the for loop's body inside the curly braces. So the missing part is the loop's header. \n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is the line:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n; j++) {\n\nWait, but the problem says to output only the missing code. The user's code has the for loop with the comment, so the missing part is the loop's header. \n\nYes, so the answer is the for loop's header line. \n\nTherefore, the code to output is:\n\nfor (int j = i; j < n; j++) {\n\nWait, but the code in the problem's code already has the opening brace. Let me check the code again:\n\nThe code in the problem's code has:\n\nfor (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n    int l = j + 1;\n    ... \n}\n\nSo the loop's header is missing. The user must provide the loop's header. \n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is the loop's header: for (int j = i; j < n; j++) \n\nSo the code to output is exactly that line. \n\nHence, the answer is the for loop's header line."
