So the existing code for Division 2's condition is >=1600. But that would include 1600 up, but then the next condition for Division 3 needs to check if it's between 1400 and 1599. However, since the previous condition already handled >=1600, the next check should be >=1400, because if it's not in Division 2 or 1, then if it's 1400 or higher, it's Division 3. Otherwise, it's Division 4. So the code for the Division 3's condition should be if the rating is >=1400. Because after passing the first two conditions (so it's less than 1600), then checking if it's >=1400 would put it into Division 3. If not, then else (which is Division 4). So the line that's missing is the condition for the third elif. The current code has:\n\nelif # TODO: Your code here So I need to replace the comment with the condition. The correct condition here is if the rating is >=1400. So converting z to integer again, but maybe better to convert once.

So for the third condition, the code should be:\n\nelif int(z) >=1400:\n\nThen the print for Division 3. And the else (which is the final part) would be Division 4. Wait, let me check the flow. Let's see:\n\nIf the rating is >=1900 \u2192 Div1. Else if >=1600 \u2192 Div2. Else if >=1400 \u2192 Div3. Else \u2192 Div4. Yes, that works.",
