The task is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. The initial b is all zeros. Hmm, the approach here probably involves dynamic programming or some greedy method. Let me think. The key is to determine the minimal steps required so that each b[i] is greater than b[i-1].

Wait, the code structure is a bit confusing. Let me see. Wait, the code has a loop for i from 0 to n-1. For each i, they set b[i] =0, then there's a loop for j starting from somewhere. The comments say \"TODO: Your code here\" for the inner loop's condition. Then, after that, there's a loop going backward from j =i-1 down to 0. Wait, maybe the idea is to try different starting points and compute the required steps. But I'm not sure. Let me think of the problem again. The problem requires that the final b array is strictly increasing. Each move on b_i can add or subtract a_i any number of times. So for each position i, the value of b_i can be written as b_i = initial (0) + k_i * a_i, where k_i is any integer (positive or negative).

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. The initial b is all zeros. \n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves dynamic programming or some greedy method. Let me think. The key is to determine the minimal steps required so that each b[i] is greater than b[i-1]. \n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a loop over i from 0 to n-1. For each i, they initialize b[i] to 0 and then compute some c (the count of moves). Then there are loops for j, but the inner loop is missing. Wait, the code structure is a bit confusing. Let me see.\n\nWait, the code has a loop for i from 0 to n-1. For each i, they set b[i] =0, then there's a loop for j starting from somewhere. The comments say \"TODO: Your code here\" for the inner loop's condition. Then, after that, there's a loop going backward from j =i-1 down to 0. \n\nWait, maybe the idea is to try different starting points and compute the required steps. But I'm not sure. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nThe problem requires that the final b array is strictly increasing. Each move on b_i can add or subtract a_i any number of times. So for each position i, the value of b_i can be written as b_i = initial (0) + k_i * a_i, where k_i is any integer (positive or negative). The goal is to choose k_i's such that the sequence is strictly increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nAh right, because each move is adding or subtracting a_i once, so the number of moves for each b_i is |k_i|. So the total moves is the sum of |k_i| for all i. We need to minimize this sum while ensuring that b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n.\n\nHmm, how do we model this? Let's think of the constraints. For each i from 2 to n, we must have b_{i} > b_{i-1}. \n\nExpressed in terms of k's: \n\nb_i = k_i * a_i \n\nb_{i-1} = k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\nSo the condition is k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\nWe need to find integers k_i (can be positive or negative) such that this holds for all i, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem where for each position, we track possible values of b_i and the minimal steps. But with n up to 5000, that might be too slow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a greedy approach. Let me think of the constraints step by step.\n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. For each position i, we need to choose k_i such that the current b_i is as small as possible but still greater than b_{i-1}. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system of inequalities and find the minimal steps by adjusting each k_i based on previous choices.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's start from the first element. For the first element, since there's no previous, we can set k_0 to any value, but since we want to minimize the total steps, perhaps we can set it to 0. But then the next elements have to be larger. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal sum of |k_i| such that for each i >=2, k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a sequence where each term must be greater than the previous. Let me think of the variables in terms of the previous terms.\n\nLet me consider the variables in terms of the required constraints. Let me denote b_0 =0, but actually, the initial b is all zeros, but after moves, they can be anything. Wait, the initial b is zero, but each move adds or subtracts a_i. So the final b_i is equal to (k_i)*a_i, where k_i is any integer (could be positive or negative). \n\nThe problem is to choose k_i's such that for all i from 1 to n-1, (k_{i} * a_i) > (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}), and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily adjusting each k_i based on the previous k_{i-1}.\n\nLet me think of the process step by step. Let's start with the first element. Since there's no prior element, the first element can be set to any value, but to minimize the steps, perhaps we can set it to 0 (k_1 =0). But then the next element must be greater than 0. \n\nWait, but maybe that's not optimal. Let me think of the example given in the problem. \n\nIn example 1, the input is a = [1, 2, 3,4,5]. The solution subtracts a_1 (so k_1 is -1, so b_1 is -1). Then for the next elements, they add a_i. So the steps are 1 (for first) plus 1 each for the others, totaling 4. \n\nHmm, so in that case, setting the first element to a lower value allows the next elements to have smaller required increments. \n\nSo perhaps the key is to adjust each k_i such that each subsequent term is as small as possible but still larger than the previous. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nWe can model the problem by starting from the first element and moving forward, ensuring that each next element is just enough to be larger than the previous. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each position i, we track the minimal steps required up to i, given that the current b_i is some value. But with n up to 5000, this might be too slow unless optimized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to compute this greedily. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right. For each position i, we need to choose k_i such that:\n\nb_i = k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}\n\nWe want to choose the minimal |k_i| possible. \n\nBut how do we choose k_i given the previous b_{i-1}?\n\nLet me think of the minimal possible k_i. Let's denote the previous b_{i-1} as prev. \n\nWe need k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i such that this inequality holds. \n\nWait, but k_i can be any integer. So the minimal |k_i| would be when k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nWait, but k_i can be negative. Wait, but if prev is very large, then even a negative k_i might not help. Hmm, perhaps the minimal steps would require that we choose the smallest possible k_i (in absolute terms) such that the condition holds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to set each b_i to be the minimal possible value that is greater than b_{i-1}, which would minimize the required k_i's. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nSuppose we have the previous value b_{i-1}. The minimal possible b_i is the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1} that can be achieved by adding or subtracting multiples of a_i. \n\nWait, but since b_i can be any multiple of a_i (since each move adds or subtracts a_i, so the total is k_i * a_i). So the possible values of b_i are all multiples of a_i. \n\nWait, no. Wait, each move adds or subtracts a_i once. So the total is the number of additions minus the number of subtractions multiplied by a_i. So the total is (add - subtract) * a_i. So the total is k_i * a_i, where k_i can be any integer (positive or negative). \n\nTherefore, the possible values of b_i are exactly the multiples of a_i. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nk_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1} for all i >=2,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nAh, this is a key insight. So the problem is to choose integers k_i such that each term is a multiple of a_i, and each term is strictly larger than the previous, with minimal sum of absolute values of k_i.\n\nNow, how do we model this?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each position i, we track the possible values of b_i (or equivalently, k_i) and the minimal steps up to that point. But with a_i up to 1e9 and n up to 5000, this might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute this greedily, moving from left to right and adjusting each k_i based on the previous.\n\nLet me think of the first element. Since there's no previous, the first term can be set to any multiple of a_1. To minimize the steps, we can set it to 0 (k_1 =0). But then the next term must be greater than 0. \n\nWait, but maybe setting it to a lower value (like negative) allows the next terms to have smaller required increments. For example, in the first example, the first term was set to -1 (k_1 =-1), which allows the next terms to start from a lower base. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the optimal approach is to choose each k_i such that the current b_i is as small as possible but still greater than the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but how do we choose that?\n\nLet me think of the process step by step. Let's denote the previous value as prev. For the current a_i, we need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev. The minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i (in absolute terms) that satisfies this inequality. \n\nWait, but the direction (positive or negative) of k_i can affect this. Let me think of possible k_i values. \n\nSuppose prev is some value. We need to find the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the minimal integer k such that k * a_i > prev. But k can be positive or negative. Wait, but if a_i is positive (as per the problem statement), then to have k_i * a_i > prev, the sign of k_i depends on prev. \n\nWait, let's think of possible cases. \n\nSuppose prev is fixed. Let me denote the required condition as k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nWe can rearrange this as k_i > prev / a_i. \n\nSince a_i is positive, the inequality direction remains the same. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than prev / a_i. \n\nWait, but k_i can be any integer greater than prev / a_i. The minimal |k_i| would be the one closest to zero. \n\nWait, but if prev is negative, then even a negative k_i could work. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal |k_i| is achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nLet me denote prev as the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nWe need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is achieved by the smallest possible k_i (closest to zero) that satisfies the inequality. \n\nSo, the minimal k_i is the ceiling of (prev / a_i) + 1? \n\nWait, let me think numerically. \n\nSuppose prev is 5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen, k_i must be > 5/3 \u22481.666. So the minimal integer k_i is 2. \n\nThe absolute value is 2. \n\nAlternatively, if prev is -2, a_i is 3. \n\nThen, k_i can be any integer greater than -2/3 \u2248-0.666. So the minimal k_i is 0 (since 0 > -0.666). \n\nSo in this case, k_i=0 gives 0*3 =0 which is greater than -2. \n\nSo the minimal |k_i| is 0. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (prev)/a_i. \n\nWait, but how do we compute that? \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer k such that k > (prev)/a_i. \n\nSo k must be at least floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nprev / a_i could be a fraction. \n\nLet me denote x = prev / a_i. \n\nThen, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nSo k_i = floor(x) +1 if x is not integer. \n\nWait, but if x is an integer, then k_i must be x +1. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, k_i = floor(prev / a_i) +1. \n\nWait, but this is only when a_i is positive, which it is. \n\nWait, but this gives the minimal k_i in terms of being the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i. \n\nBut the minimal |k_i| may not be this, because maybe a negative k_i could also satisfy the condition with a smaller absolute value. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose prev is 5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen, the minimal k_i is 2 (as before). \n\nAlternatively, if prev is 5, a_i is -3? No, a_i is positive. \n\nWait, a_i is given as a positive integer. \n\nSo, the problem is that k_i can be any integer, but a_i is positive. \n\nSo, the minimal k_i is the minimal integer greater than (prev)/a_i. \n\nWait, but if prev is negative, then even a negative k_i could work. \n\nWait, let's take an example where prev is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen, the required k_i must be greater than (-5)/3 \u2248-1.666. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is -1, since -1 > -1.666. \n\nSo k_i =-1 gives 3*(-1) =-3, which is greater than -5. \n\nThe absolute value is 1, which is better than choosing 0 (which would give 0, which is also greater than -5, but |0| is 0, which is better. Wait, wait, 0 is better. \n\nWait, in this case, k_i can be 0, which gives 0, which is greater than -5. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0, which is better. \n\nAh, so my previous approach was wrong. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nSo, the minimal |k_i| is achieved by the k_i closest to zero that satisfies the inequality. \n\nSo, how do we find that?\n\nLet me think of the possible candidates. \n\nThe required condition is k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nWe can rearrange this as k_i > prev / a_i. \n\nLet me denote x = prev / a_i. \n\nWe need k_i to be the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut also, perhaps there is a smaller k_i (in absolute terms) if we can go negative. \n\nWait, but if x is negative, then maybe a negative k_i could be better. \n\nWait, let's think of the example where prev is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nx = -5/3 \u2248-1.666. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than -1.666. \n\nThe integers greater than -1.666 are -1, 0, 1, etc. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is 0 (since 0 is greater than -1.666, and |0| is 0). \n\nSo in this case, the best is k_i=0. \n\nAnother example: prev is 2, a_i is 3. \n\nx = 2/3 \u22480.666. \n\nThe minimal k_i is 1 (since 1>0.666). \n\nThe absolute value is 1. \n\nAnother example: prev is 4, a_i is 3. \n\nx=4/3\u22481.333. \n\nSo k_i must be at least 2. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is 2, with |2|=2. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nWait, but in the first case where prev is -5 and a_i is 3, the minimal k_i is 0, which is indeed the smallest integer greater than x (since x is -1.666, so 0 is the first integer greater than x). \n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the minimal k_i is ceil(prev / a_i) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, ceil(prev/a_i) would give the smallest integer greater than or equal to prev/a_i. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (prev)/a_i. \n\nSo, if (prev)/a_i is not an integer, then it's floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nIf it is an integer, then it's (prev/a_i) +1. \n\nSo, in code terms, it's (prev / a_i) + 1 if prev is divisible by a_i, else floor(prev/a_i) +1. \n\nAlternatively, it can be written as floor(prev / a_i) +1. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nprev =5, a_i=3 \u21925/3 is 1.666, floor is 1 \u21921+1=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev= -5, a_i=3 \u2192-5/3 is -1.666, floor is -2 \u2192-2 +1 =-1 \u2192 but the correct k_i is 0. \n\nHmm, so that approach doesn't work. \n\nWait, so the problem is that when prev is negative, the floor(prev/a_i) can be lower than needed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is ceil(prev / a_i) + 1? \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nprev =-5, a_i=3 \u2192-5/3 is -1.666. The ceil of that is -1. \n\nSo ceil(prev/a_i) is -1. \n\nThen, the minimal k_i is -1 +1? No, that would be 0. \n\nWait, ceil(prev/a_i) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to prev/a_i. \n\nSo, in the case of prev=-5, a_i=3, ceil(-5/3) is -1. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than prev/a_i (which is -1.666). \n\nThe minimal integer greater than that is -1, but 0 is also greater. \n\nWait, but the minimal k_i in terms of absolute value is 0. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x (x=prev/a_i) such that the absolute value is minimized. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer k such that k > x, and |k| is as small as possible. \n\nSo, the minimal k is the one closest to zero. \n\nSo, the possible candidates are the integers just above x. \n\nLet me think of x as a real number. \n\nThe minimal k is the integer closest to zero that is greater than x. \n\nSo, for example, if x is -1.666, then the candidates are -1, 0, 1, etc. \n\nThe closest to zero is -1 (distance 1) or 0 (distance 0). \n\nWait, 0 is better. \n\nWait, but 0 is greater than x (-1.666). \n\nSo the minimal k is 0. \n\nHmm, so how do I compute that? \n\nThe minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k is the ceiling of x, but if that is not the minimal, then check lower ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one with the minimal absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one with the minimal absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer
