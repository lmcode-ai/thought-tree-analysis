Otherwise, case1 is not possible, so we can't take that path.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute the possible minimal N for case1:\n\nCompute lower_case1 = max(l1, l2)\n\nupper_case1 = min(r1, r2)\n\nif lower_case1 <= upper_case1, then case1 is possible, and the candidate is lower_case1.\n\nElse, case1 is not possible.\n\nThe candidate for case2 is l1 + l2.\n\nThe minimal N is the minimum between the case1 candidate (if possible) and case2's candidate.\n\nSo the answer is the minimum between these two options, but only considering the valid ones.\n\nWait, but what if case1 is possible and case2's candidate is smaller than case1's? Then we have to choose the smaller one. Wait no, because case2's candidate is l1 + l2, which could be smaller than case1's candidate. For example, if l1=1, l2=1, then case1's candidate is 1, which is better. But if l1=2, l2=3, then case1's candidate is 3, but case2's is 5. So in that case, case1 is better. But if the case1's candidate is 3, but the upper_case1 is 2 (so case1 is not possible), then case2's 5 is the only option.\n\nWait, let me think of an example where case2 is better. Suppose l1=3, r1=5, l2=3, r2=5. Then case1's candidate is max(3,3)=3, and upper is min(5,5)=5. So case1 is possible, so the minimal N is 3. But case2's candidate is 3+3=6, which is worse. So case1 is better.\n\nAnother example: l1=1, r1=1, l2=2, r2=2. Then case1 requires N to be between 1 and 1 (since r1=1 and r2=2, so upper is 1). But l2 is 2, so lower_case1 is max(1,2)=2. But upper is 1. So case1 is not possible. So then case2's candidate is 1+2=3. So the answer is 3.\n\nAnother example: l1=2, r1=3, l2=2, r2=3. Then case1's candidate is 2, which is within the upper (3). So the minimal N is 2. Which is better than case2's 4.\n\nSo the minimal N is the minimum between the case1 candidate (if possible) and case2's candidate.\n\nWait, but in case1, the candidate is the minimal possible N (max(l1,l2)), but in case2, the candidate is l1 + l2. So the minimal between the two would be the answer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute case1_candidate = max(l1, l2) if possible (i.e., if max(l1,l2) <= min(r1, r2)), else infinity (meaning not possible).\n\nCompute case2_candidate = l1 + l2.\n\nThe answer is the minimum between case1_candidate and case2_candidate, but if case1 is not possible, then it's case2_candidate, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but in code, how do we handle that?\n\nSo in code, for each test case:\n\nWe have l1, r1, l2, r2.\n\nCompute the possible case1:\n\nlower = Math.max(l1, l2);\n\nupper = Math.min(r1, r2);\n\nif (lower <= upper) then case1 is possible, so case1_candidate is lower.\n\nElse, case1 is not possible, so case1_candidate is infinity (or a very large number).\n\nThen case2_candidate is l1 + l2.\n\nThe minimal N is the minimum between case1_candidate and case2_candidate.\n\nBut since we need to output an integer, if case1 is possible, then the minimal is the minimum between the two candidates. Otherwise, it's case2_candidate.\n\nWait, but in code, how do we represent infinity? Well, since the maximum possible case2_candidate is 50 +50 =100, so we can set case1_candidate to 101 (or some number larger than possible) when it's not possible.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint case1_candidate = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n\nif (lower <= upper) {\n\n    case1_candidate = lower;\n\n}\n\ncase2_candidate = l1 + l2;\n\nans = Math.min(case1_candidate, case2_candidate);\n\nBut wait, the problem requires the minimal possible N. So the answer is the minimum between the two options, but only considering valid options.\n\nWait, but in the case where case1 is possible, then the minimal between case1_candidate (which is the minimal possible in case1) and case2_candidate (the minimal in case2) is the correct answer.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code needs to compute this.\n\nNow, looking at the given code skeleton:\n\nThe code reads four integers a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], which are l1, r1, l2, r2.\n\nWait, the code's array a is filled as:\n\nfor(int j=0;j<4;j++) a[j]=sc.nextInt();\n\nSo a[0] is l1, a[1] is r1, a[2] is l2, a[3] is r2.\n\nThe code then has an if statement that needs to be filled. The current code is:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) System.out.println(Math.max(a[2],a[0]));\n\nelse System.out.println(a[0]+a[2]);\n\nHmm, so the code is trying to decide between two options: either output the max of l2 and l1 (case1_candidate) or output l1 + l2 (case2_candidate). But the condition in the if statement must decide when case1 is possible and better than case2.\n\nWait, but according to our analysis, the minimal N is the minimum between case1_candidate and case2_candidate. So when is case1_candidate better than case2?\n\nOnly when case1_candidate is possible (i.e., case1 is possible) and case1_candidate <= case2_candidate.\n\nSo the code's current structure is:\n\nif (condition) then print case1_candidate (max(l1,l2)), else print case2_candidate (l1 + l2).\n\nSo the condition must be true when case1 is possible and case1_candidate is better (i.e., when case1_candidate <= case2_candidate).\n\nWait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to see if the case1 is possible and the case1_candidate is better than case2_candidate. So the condition is whether case1 is possible and (max(l1,l2) <= l1 + l2). Since max(l1,l2) is always <= l1 + l2, because l1 and l2 are at least 1. So the condition is just whether case1 is possible.\n\nWait, but in that case, when case1 is possible, then the minimal N is the minimum between case1_candidate and case2_candidate. But since case1_candidate is max(l1,l2), which is <= l1 + l2 (since l1 and l2 are at least 1), then the minimal is case1_candidate. So whenever case1 is possible, the answer is case1_candidate, else it's case2_candidate.\n\nAh! That's the key. Because when case1 is possible, then the minimal N is case1_candidate (since it's better than case2's candidate). So the condition is whether case1 is possible. If yes, then output case1_candidate (max(l1,l2)), else output case2_candidate (l1 + l2).\n\nSo the code's if condition should check whether case1 is possible. That is, whether the lower <= upper.\n\nSo the code's if condition is:\n\nif ( (max(l1, l2) <= min(r1, r2)) )\n\nthen output the case1_candidate (max(l1,l2)), else output case2_candidate (l1 + l2).\n\nSo in code terms:\n\nint l1 = a[0], r1 = a[1], l2 = a[2], r2 = a[3];\n\nint lower = Math.max(l1, l2);\n\nint upper = Math.min(r1, r2);\n\nif (lower <= upper) {\n\n    System.out.println(lower);\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(l1 + l2);\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code skeleton, the code is structured as:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) System.out.println( Math.max(a[2], a[0]) );\n\nelse System.out.println( a[0] + a[2] );\n\nSo the code's current structure is almost correct except for the condition.\n\nThe condition must be whether case1 is possible (i.e., lower <= upper).\n\nSo the code's if condition should be (lower <= upper). But how to compute that in terms of a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3].\n\nLet me see:\n\nlower = Math.max(a[0], a[2]);\n\nupper = Math.min(a[1], a[3]);\n\nSo the condition is ( Math.max(a[0], a[2]) <= Math.min(a[1], a[3]) )\n\nSo the code's if condition should be:\n\nif ( Math.max(a[0], a[2]) <= Math.min(a[1], a[3]) )\n\nThen the code would print the correct value.\n\nSo the missing code in the if statement is that condition.\n\nTherefore, the code should replace the TODO with that condition.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif( Math.max(a[0], a[2]) <= Math.min(a[1], a[3]) )\n\nSo the missing part is the condition inside the if statement.\n\nTherefore, the code's missing part is:\n\nMath.max(a[0], a[2]) <= Math.min(a[1], a[3])\n\nSo the user needs to fill that into the if condition.\n\nTesting with the examples given in the problem:\n\nFirst example from the note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first example in the note's examples is like the first example given in the problem description. Let me see the sample input and output.\n\nWait, the problem's examples in the note's \"Optimal arrays\" are examples of arrays, but the actual test cases are not given. Let me think of a test case where case1 is possible.\n\nTest case 1: l1=3, r1=5, l2=3, r2=5.\n\nThen lower is 3, upper is 5. So condition is true. So output is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case where case1 is not possible:\n\nTest case 2: l1=2, r1=3, l2=4, r2=5.\n\nlower is max(2,4)=4. upper is min(3,5)=3. 4>3 \u2192 condition is false. So output 2+4=6.\n\nAnother test case where case1 is possible but the case1 candidate is better than case2.\n\nTest case 3: l1=1, l2=1, r1=5, r2=5 \u2192 condition is true. Output 1, which is better than 2 (1+1).\n\nAnother test case where case1 is possible but the case1 candidate is better than case2.\n\nAnother case where case1 is possible but the case1 candidate is better.\n\nYes, so the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the condition in the if statement."
