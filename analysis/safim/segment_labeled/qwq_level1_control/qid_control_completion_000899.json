  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's read the problem carefully again. The task is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp turns one into R and the other into B, and the stamp can be rotated (so either RB or BR). The key is to find out the conditions under which the given string is possible.\n\nHmm, the code provided is Java, and the Solve() function is supposed to process each test case. The current code splits the input string by \"W\" into parts. Wait, why split on W? Because maybe the W's are the parts that are untouched, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the approach.\n\nThe problem requires that every non-W part must be formed by the stamps. Since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, perhaps the non-W sequences must follow certain patterns. Let me think of the constraints.\n\nEach stamp application changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. So any two consecutive non-W characters must form a valid pair, but since multiple stamps can be applied, maybe overlapping, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the entire string must satisfy that every pair of consecutive non-W characters alternates between R and B? Or perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nWait, let's think of the possible sequences. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, but each application affects two cells. The key is that every R and B in the final string must be part of some such pair. Also, since each stamp can be applied multiple times, overlapping, but each time it flips both cells. Wait, no, each stamp application sets the two cells to either RB or BR. Wait, the problem says \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" So each time you stamp, those two cells are set to either RB or BR, regardless of their previous state. So overlapping stamps can overwrite previous colors.\n\nHmm, but how can we model this? Maybe the key is that the final string must not have any two adjacent non-W characters that are the same. Because each stamp application on two cells must set them to different colors (R and B in some order). Wait, but if two adjacent non-W are the same, like RR, then that's impossible because any stamp covering them would have to set them to RB or BR, so they can't both be R. So that's a key point.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose there's a substring like \"RR\". How could that happen? Let's see. Suppose the first stamp was applied to those two cells as BR, making them B and R. Then another stamp on the same two cells as RB, which would set them to R and B. Wait, no, each time you stamp, you choose either RB or BR. So each time you stamp on those two cells, you can set them to either RB or BR. So after two stamps, they could be back to original? Not sure. Wait, the problem says each stamp \"recolors\" both cells. So each time you stamp, those two cells are set to either RB or BR, regardless of their previous state. So if you have two adjacent cells that are both R, that's impossible because any stamp covering them would have set them to either RB or BR. So the only way they can both be R is if they were never stamped? But then they would remain white. So if two adjacent non-W are the same, that's impossible. So the first condition is that in the final string, any two adjacent non-W characters must be different. So for example, \"RB\" is okay, \"BR\" is okay, but \"RR\" or \"BB\" would be invalid.\n\nWait, but what about a single non-W character? Like if the string is \"R\", then since you can't stamp a single cell, that's impossible. So any occurrence of a single R or B (not part of a pair) would be invalid. So the entire string must be such that all non-W characters form pairs where each pair alternates between R and B, and there are no isolated single R or B.\n\nWait, but the stamps can be applied multiple times. Let me think of an example. Suppose the desired string is \"BRB\". Let's see:\n\nStart with WWW. Suppose first stamp at positions 1-2 as BR: so B R W. Then stamp at positions 2-3 as RB (so R becomes B, and W becomes R). Then the result is B B R? Wait, no. Wait, the second stamp on positions 2-3 would set them to either RB or BR. Let's say we choose BR for the second stamp. Then positions 2 and 3 become B and R. So the string would be B (from first stamp's first cell), then B (from second stamp's first cell?), wait maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that the non-W parts must form sequences where every two consecutive characters alternate between R and B, and the length of any non-W segment must be even? Or maybe not exactly even, but the length can be even or odd?\n\nWait, let's think of the example given in the problem. The example's final string is B R B B W. Wait, the example's final string is \"BRBBW\". Wait, looking at the example's explanation, the final string is B R B B W. Wait, the fourth character is B, so the third and fourth are B and B. That's two adjacent B's. But according to my previous thought, that would be invalid. But the example says that it is possible. Wait, that's a problem. So my initial reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, the example's final string is B R B B W. Let me check the example's steps:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nStart with WWWWW.\n\nFirst stamp at positions 4-5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the example's explanation, the first stamp is applied to the last two W's, turning them into RB. So the string becomes W W R B W.\n\nThen the next stamp is applied to positions 0-1 (the first two W's?), turning them into BR. So the first two become B R, so the string is B R R B W. Wait, but then the third step is applying the stamp to positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would require setting them to either RB or BR. So if they were R and R, then after the stamp, they become either RB or BR. So in the third step, the example's third step is applying the stamp to positions 2-3 (the R and B?), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me recheck the example's steps.\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nFirst step: W W W W W \u2192 after stamp on last two (positions 3-4?), resulting in W W W R B.\n\nWait, maybe the example's first stamp is on positions 3 and 4 (assuming 0-based), turning them into RB. So the string becomes W W W R B.\n\nSecond step: stamp on positions 0 and 1 (the first two W's), turning them into BR. So the first two become B R, so the string is B R W R B W? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me see the example's explanation again.\n\nThe example's first step is \"WWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB underlined, then W\". So the first stamp is applied to the last two W's (positions 3 and 4?), making them RB. So the string becomes WW followed by RB and then W. So the string is \"WWRBW\".\n\nThen the second step is applying the stamp to the first two W's (positions 0 and 1), turning them into BR. So the first two become BR, so the string becomes BR followed by RB and W \u2192 B R R B W? Wait, but then the third step is applying the stamp to positions 1 and 2 (the R and R?), which can't be done because they are adjacent and same color. Wait, but the third step in the example's explanation is applying the stamp to positions 1 and 2 (the R and R?), but that would require changing them to either RB or BR. So after that, they become either RB or BR, so the two R's become different. \n\nWait, the third step in the example's explanation is: the third step is applying the stamp to positions 2-3 (the R and B?), but I'm getting confused. Let me look at the example's final result. The final string is B R B B W. So the third and fourth characters are B and B. So two adjacent B's. But according to my previous reasoning, that would be impossible. But the example says it is possible. So my initial idea that adjacent non-W must alternate is wrong. So I need to rethink.\n\nHmm, so the example's final string has two B's in a row. So that's allowed. So my previous reasoning was incorrect. So what's the correct condition?\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that any two adjacent non-W must form a valid pair (either RB or BR) when considering the stamps applied. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string must not have three consecutive same non-W characters. Or perhaps the problem is more complex.\n\nLet me think of the example's final string: B R B B W. The last two B's are adjacent. How did that happen?\n\nLooking at the example's steps:\n\nAfter the second step, the string is B R R B W. Then the third step applies the stamp to positions 1-2 (the two R's). The stamp can be applied as either RB or BR. Let's say they choose BR. Then the two R's become B and R. So the string becomes B followed by B R, then B W. So the third character is R, and the fourth is B. Wait, that would make the string B B R B W. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third step is applied to positions 2-3 (the R and B). Let me see the example's explanation again.\n\nThe example's third step is: the third step is applying the stamp to positions 2 and 3 (the R and B?), but the stamp can be rotated. So if they choose BR, then the two cells become B and R. So the third and fourth characters would be B and R. But the final string is B R B B W. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. Let me read the example again.\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nFirst step: W W W W W \u2192 WW followed by RB underlined (positions 3-4?), so the string becomes WW RB W \u2192 \"WWRBW\".\n\nSecond step: apply the stamp to the first two W's (positions 0-1), turning them into BR. So the first two become BR, so the string is BR RB W \u2192 \"BRRBW\".\n\nThird step: apply the stamp to positions 1-2 (the R and R). The stamp can be applied as BR or RB. Let's say they choose RB. Then those two R's become R and B. So the string becomes B followed by R B, then B W \u2192 \"BRB BW\". So the third character is B, fourth is B? Wait, no. Wait, the third step's stamp is applied to positions 1 and 2 (the two R's). So after applying the stamp as RB, the first R (position 1) becomes R, and the second (position 2) becomes B. So the string after second step was B R R B W. After third step, positions 1 and 2 become R and B? Wait, no, the stamp can choose either RB or BR. Let me see:\n\nIf the stamp is applied as RB, then position 1 becomes R, position 2 becomes B. So the string becomes B (position0), then R (position1), B (position2), then the existing B (position3) and W (position4). So the string is B R B B W. Which matches the final string. So the two B's at positions 2 and 3 are allowed. So how is that possible?\n\nAh, because the two B's are not adjacent in the way that they were stamped together. The first B (position2) came from the third stamp's second cell (as B), and the next B (position3) was already there from the second stamp. So they are adjacent but not part of a stamp's pair. So the key is that two adjacent B's can exist as long as they are not part of a pair that was stamped in a way that would require them to be different. Wait, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the stamps can be applied in such a way that overlapping stamps can create adjacent same colors. So the previous idea that adjacent non-W must alternate is incorrect. So I need to find another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. Each stamp application affects two cells, setting them to either RB or BR. The final string must be achievable through a series of such operations. The initial state is all W. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, any number of times, and each time it overwrites the two cells to either RB or BR.\n\nThe key is to find the conditions under which the target string can be formed.\n\nLet me think of the target string. Let's consider all the non-W characters. Each such character must be part of at least one stamp application. But since stamps can overlap, it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following must hold:\n\n- Any occurrence of a non-W character must be part of a pair with its neighbor, but since stamps can be applied multiple times, maybe the sequence can have any pattern except certain forbidden ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have three consecutive same non-W characters. Or maybe the non-W parts must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive non-W characters can be part of some stamp.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every pair of adjacent non-W must be either RB or BR. Because each time you stamp a pair, you set them to one of those two. But overlapping stamps can change this. Wait, but if two adjacent non-W are the same, like BB, then how could that happen?\n\nIn the example, the final string has BB. Let's see how that was possible. The two B's were from different stamps. The first B (position2) came from a stamp's second cell (as B), and the next B (position3) was from a previous stamp's first cell (as B). So they are adjacent but not part of the same stamp's application. So their colors can be the same.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that the two B's are not part of the same stamp's pair. So the adjacent same colors are allowed as long as they are not part of a pair that was stamped in a way that would require them to be different. But how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have three consecutive non-W characters that are the same. Or perhaps the entire string must not have three in a row of the same, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that each stamp affects two cells, so the entire string must be covered by some overlapping pairs of R and B, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the stamps as operations that can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The order of operations can be arbitrary, but each operation overwrites the cells. So the final colors depend on the last operation applied to each cell.\n\nWait, but each cell can be part of multiple stamps. For example, a cell could be part of a stamp to the left and a stamp to the right. The final color of the cell is determined by the last stamp that affected it.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: the final string must be such that for every non-W cell, it is part of at least one stamp's pair (either as the first or second cell), and the sequence of stamps can be arranged such that all the final colors are achieved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W characters alternate between R and B. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to R and B in some order, but overlapping stamps can flip them again. Wait, but in the example, there are two B's in a row. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that the non-W parts must form a sequence where every pair of adjacent non-W characters are different. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to different colors. But in the example, there are two B's adjacent. So that can't be.\n\nWait, in the example's final string, the two B's are at positions 2 and 3. Let's see their history:\n\nPosition 2 was set by the third stamp (as B), and position3 was set by the second stamp (as B). So the third stamp's application didn't affect position3. So the two B's are allowed because they were set by different stamps, and their positions are adjacent but not part of the same stamp's pair.\n\nSo the problem is that two adjacent non-W can be same, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the entire string must not have three consecutive same non-W characters. Let me see:\n\nIn the example, the two B's are allowed, but three in a row would not be. Let me think of a test case like \"BBB\". Can that be formed?\n\nSuppose n=3, target is \"BBB\".\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet's see. The initial is WWW.\n\nFirst, apply a stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nThen apply a stamp on positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B B (since the second cell was R, now becomes B, and third becomes R? Wait, no. Wait, the stamp on positions 1-2 as BR would set them to B and R. So after first stamp: B R W \u2192 then second stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 B (position0), then B (position1) and R (position2). So the string is B B R. Not BBB.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nSecond stamp on 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R \u2192 no, that would set them again to B and R. So no change. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nSecond stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W. Then third stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B becomes B R, so the third character becomes R. So the string is R B R. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe it's impossible to get three B's in a row. So perhaps the condition is that there are no three consecutive same non-W characters. But how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have three in a row of the same non-W, but also that any two same non-W must be separated by at least one W or by a different color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows: every occurrence of a non-W must be part of a pair with its neighbor, but since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, the only forbidden pattern is when two same non-W are adjacent and there's no way to have them set by different stamps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W are different. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to different colors, but overlapping stamps can flip them again. Wait, but in the example, there are two B's in a row. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's think of the problem in terms of parity or some invariant.\n\nEach stamp operation affects two cells, setting them to R and B in some order. So each stamp contributes a pair of different colors. The total number of R and B must satisfy some condition?\n\nWait, the total number of R and B must have the same parity? Because each stamp adds one R and one B. So the total count of R and B must differ by 0 or \u00b11? Wait, no. Each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. So the total number of R and B must have the same parity. Because each stamp contributes +1 to R and +1 to B, so their difference remains the same. Wait, the initial state has 0 R and 0 B, so after any number of stamps, the total R and B must have the same parity (since each stamp adds 1 to each). So the total number of R plus B must be even? Because each stamp adds 2 (1 R and 1 B). So the total R + B must be even. So if the target has an odd number of R and B combined, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Let me check the example. The example's final string is B R B B W. The non-W characters are B, R, B, B \u2192 total R:1, B:3 \u2192 total R+B is 4, which is even. So that's okay.\n\nAnother example: if the target is \"R\", then R count is 1, B 0 \u2192 total 1, which is odd \u2192 impossible. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"BBB\" \u2192 R=0, B=3 \u2192 total 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 impossible. So that's correct.\n\nSo that's one condition: the total number of R and B must be even.\n\nAnother condition: any two adjacent non-W must not be the same? Wait, but the example has two B's adjacent. So that's not the case. So that condition is not necessary.\n\nHmm, so the first condition is that the total R + B must be even.\n\nAnother condition: the non-W parts must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive non-W are either R and B or B and R. Wait, but in the example, there are two B's in a row. So that's not the case. So that's not a condition.\n\nHmm, so what's the other condition?\n\nLet me think of the example's final string: B R B B W. The two B's are adjacent. How did that happen?\n\nThe first B (position0) came from a stamp's first cell (BR), the R (position1) from the same stamp's second cell. Then the B at position2 came from a stamp's second cell (RB?), and the B at position3 came from a previous stamp's first cell (BR). So the two B's are from different stamps, so their adjacency is allowed.\n\nSo the problem is that the two B's are allowed as long as they are not part of the same stamp's pair. So the key is that the entire string can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have three consecutive same non-W characters. Let me see:\n\nIn the example, two B's are allowed, but three would not be. Let's see if three B's can be formed.\n\nSuppose target is \"BBB\". The total R+B is 3 (odd) \u2192 impossible. So that's covered by the first condition.\n\nAnother example: \"BWB\" \u2192 two B's separated by W. That's allowed. The total R+B is 2 (even). So possible?\n\nYes. Let's see:\n\nStart with WWW. Stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. Then stamp on positions 2-3 (but n=3, so positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B. So the string becomes B R B. So that's possible. So two B's separated by a W are okay.\n\nAnother example: \"BRB\" \u2192 that's allowed. The total R+B is 3 \u2192 no, wait R is 1, B is 2 \u2192 total 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 impossible. Wait, so that's a problem. Wait, \"BRB\" has R count 1, B count 2 \u2192 total 3 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 so it's impossible. But can it be formed?\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart with WWW. Stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W. Then stamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, and W becomes B. So the string becomes B (from first stamp's first cell), then R (from first stamp's second cell, then overwritten by the second stamp's first cell?), wait no. Wait, the second stamp on positions 1-2 (R and W) would set them to either RB or BR. Let's choose BR. So position1 becomes B, position2 becomes R. So the string is B B R. So that's not BRB. Alternatively, if the second stamp is applied as RB, then position1 becomes R and position2 becomes B. So the string is B R B \u2192 which is the desired \"BRB\". But the total R+B is 1+2=3 \u2192 which is odd. So that's a contradiction. So that's impossible. So the code would output \"NO\" for \"BRB\".\n\nSo the first condition (total R+B even) is necessary.\n\nAnother example: \"BRBR\" \u2192 total R+B is 4 (even). Let's see if possible.\n\nYes. Stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. Then stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. So the string is BRBR. So that's possible.\n\nSo the first condition is necessary.\n\nNow, what other conditions are needed?\n\nLet me think of another test case: \"BRRB\".\n\nTotal R+B is 4 (even). Let's see if possible.\n\nThe string is B R R B.\n\nThe two R's are adjacent. Can this be formed?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with WWWW.\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 so the string becomes B B R W.\n\nThird stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 R W \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 so the string is B B R R. Not the desired BRRB.\n\nAlternatively, different steps:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nSecond stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 W W \u2192 B R becomes B R, then the last two become B R \u2192 so the string is B R B R \u2192 not desired.\n\nHmm, trying another approach:\n\nStamp on 1-2 as RB (so R and R? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the desired string is B R R B.\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose first stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 the R and W become R and B \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B \u2192 the string becomes B R B W.\n\nThird stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B \u2192 B R \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become B and R \u2192 so the string is B B R W. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not possible. So the string BRRB would be impossible even though the total R+B is even. So there must be another condition.\n\nWhat's the problem with BRRB?\n\nThe two R's are adjacent. Let's see if they can be formed.\n\nSuppose the two R's are from two different stamps. For example, the first R (position1) comes from a stamp's second cell (as R), and the second R (position2) comes from a stamp's first cell (as R). But how?\n\nWait, each stamp must set two cells to either RB or BR. So for a cell to be R, it must be the first cell of a BR stamp or the second cell of an RB stamp.\n\nSo for the two R's at positions 1 and 2:\n\nPosition1 is R. It could be the second cell of a BR stamp (so the previous cell was B) or the first cell of an RB stamp (so the next cell is B).\n\nPosition2 is R. Similarly, it must be either the second cell of a BR stamp (so position1 was B) or the first cell of an RB stamp (so position3 is B).\n\nBut in the case of BRRB:\n\nPosition1 is R (from, say, a BR stamp on 0-1 \u2192 so position0 is B, position1 is R).\n\nPosition2 is R. To be R, it must be either the first cell of an RB stamp (so position3 must be B) or the second cell of a BR stamp (so position1 must be B). But position1 is R, so the second option is not possible. So position2 must be the first cell of an RB stamp. So the stamp on positions 2-3 must be RB, setting position2 to R and position3 to B. Which is exactly what the desired string has (position3 is B). So that's possible.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nStamp 1: positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nStamp 2: positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 W W \u2192 R B. So the string becomes B R R B. Exactly the desired string. So this is possible. So the string BRRB is possible even though there are two R's adjacent. So my previous thought that it's impossible was wrong.\n\nHmm, so the two R's are allowed. So the problem is that my previous idea of adjacent same colors being forbidden is incorrect. So what's the correct condition?\n\nHmm, so the two R's in BRRB are allowed. So the key must be something else.\n\nLet me think of the example where the string is \"BRB\". The total R+B is 3 (odd), so it's impossible. But what about \"BRBR\"?\n\nWait, let's think of another test case: \"BB\". The total R+B is 2 (even). Can this be formed?\n\nYes. Stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R \u2192 no, that gives BR. To get BB, you need to have both as B. How?\n\nWait, each stamp must set the two cells to either RB or BR. So to have both B's, you can't do it with a single stamp. Because a single stamp would set them to either RB or BR. So two B's can't be formed with a single stamp. But maybe with two stamps?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nSecond stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. So the two cells become R and B \u2192 not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nSecond stamp on 0-1 as BR again \u2192 B R \u2192 no change.\n\nHmm, so it's impossible to get \"BB\". So even though the total R+B is even (2), it's impossible. So there must be another condition.\n\nAh! So the problem is that the two B's can't be formed because each stamp can only set them to R and B in some order. So to have two B's, you need to have overlapping stamps that somehow set both to B. But each stamp can only set one of them to B and the other to R. So it's impossible to have two B's in a row unless there's a way to have overlapping stamps that flip them again.\n\nWait, let's see for \"BB\":\n\nSuppose n=2, target is \"BB\".\n\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThen stamp again on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. So the string becomes R B. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp as RB \u2192 R B.\n\nSecond stamp as BR \u2192 B R. Still no.\n\nSo it's impossible. So even though the total R+B is even (2), it's impossible. So there must be another condition.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition here?\n\nThe two B's can't be formed because each stamp can only set one of them to B and the other to R. So the only way to have two B's is if there's a way to have overlapping stamps that somehow set both to B. But each stamp can only set one to B and the other to R. So it's impossible. So the two B's can't be formed. So the condition is that the string can't have two B's in a row? But earlier example had two B's and was possible.\n\nWait, the example's final string was B R B B W. The two B's at positions 2 and 3. Let me see how that was formed.\n\nIn the example's third step, the two B's were from different stamps. The first B (position2) came from a stamp's second cell (as B), and the second B (position3) came from a previous stamp's first cell (as B). So they were set by different stamps, so their colors can be the same.\n\nAh, so the key is that the two B's are not part of the same stamp's pair. So the problem is that for two adjacent B's, there must be a way to have them set by different stamps such that their colors are B. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have two consecutive B's unless there's a W between them. Or perhaps the non-W parts must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive non-W are different, except when separated by a W.\n\nWait, but in the example's case, the two B's are consecutive and non-W. So that's allowed. So that idea is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the problem in terms of the stamps' effect.\n\nEach stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, and each application sets them to either RB or BR. The final colors are the result of all these operations, with each cell's final color being the last operation that affected it.\n\nSo for a cell to be B, it must have been the second cell of a BR stamp or the first cell of an RB stamp applied to it last.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nNow, let's think of the entire string. For each position i (0-based), let's track the last stamp that affected it. The final color of i is determined by the last stamp that covered it.\n\nSuppose we have two adjacent cells i and i+1. Their final colors must be set by their last stamps. The key is that the pair (i, i+1) must have been set by some stamp (either as BR or RB) in their last application, or one of them was set by a stamp that doesn't include the other.\n\nWait, but if the last stamp that affected i was a stamp that didn't include i+1, then the color of i+1 could be anything.\n\nHmm, this seems too vague. Maybe there's a pattern that the entire string must follow.\n\nAnother idea: the sequence of non-W characters must form a string where every pair of consecutive characters are either RB or BR, but allowing for W's in between. Wait, but the example has two B's in a row. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W characters alternate between R and B. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to different colors, but overlapping stamps can flip them again. So the final sequence must alternate between R and B, but with possible W's in between.\n\nWait, let's see the example's final string: B R B B W. The non-W sequence is B R B B. The first three are B R B (alternating), but then two B's. So that breaks the alternation. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the code provided.\n\nThe current code splits the input string by \"W\" into parts. For each part (non-W sequences), it checks some condition. If any part fails, output NO. Otherwise YES.\n\nSo the idea is that each non-W segment must satisfy a certain condition. The code is splitting the string into segments separated by W's, and each segment must be valid.\n\nSo what is the condition for each segment?\n\nIn the example's final string, the non-W segments are \"BRBB\". The code would split the string \"BRBBW\" into [\"BRBB\", \"\"], but since the split is on \"W\", the segments are the parts between W's. So the first segment is \"BRBB\", then the rest are empty (since the last character is W).\n\nSo the code is checking each non-W segment. So the condition must be that each such segment is valid.\n\nWhat makes a segment valid?\n\nLooking at the test cases mentioned in the problem's notes:\n\nThe second, third, and fourth test cases have length 1 (so the segment is a single character), which is impossible. So for a segment of length 1, it's invalid.\n\nThe fifth test case's example is \"W RB B\" (or something like that). The segments are \"RB\" and \"B\". Wait, no, the fifth test case's input is \"W R B B\" (maybe the example given in the fifth note is \"W R B B\" \u2192 the segments would be \"R\", \"B\", \"B\" \u2192 but that would be split into \"R\", \"B\", \"B\" when split on W? Wait, no. The input string is \"W R B B\" \u2192 split on W gives [\"\", \"RBB\"] (assuming the first character is W). So the segment is \"RBB\".\n\nWait, the fifth test case's example is \"WWW \u2192 becomes W RB \u2192 then BRB B\". The final string is \"BRBB\". The segments are \"BRBB\".\n\nSo the code's approach is to split the string into non-W segments, and each segment must satisfy some condition.\n\nThe problem's second test case (third and fourth) have single characters, which are invalid. So the condition for a segment is that its length is even?\n\nWait, the example's segment \"BRBB\" has length 4, which is even. The fifth test case's segment \"RB B\" (if it's \"RBB\") has length 3 \u2192 which is odd. Wait, but the fifth test case's example is possible. Wait, the fifth test case's example is:\n\nInput is \"WWW\" \u2192 becomes \"W RB\" \u2192 then \"BRB B\".\n\nThe final string is \"BRBB\" (length 4). So the segment is length 4 \u2192 even.\n\nAnother example: the first test case's segment is \"BRBB\" (length 4).\n\nThe \"BB\" case (length 2) is impossible. So the condition for a segment is that its length is even?\n\nWait, the \"BB\" segment has length 2, but it's impossible. So that can't be the condition.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition for each segment?\n\nLooking at the \"BB\" case (segment length 2):\n\nThe segment is \"BB\". To form this, you need two B's. But each stamp can only set two cells to either RB or BR. So to get two B's, you need to have overlapping stamps that somehow set both to B. But each stamp can only set one to B and the other to R. So it's impossible. So the segment \"BB\" is invalid.\n\nAnother example: the segment \"BRBB\" (length 4):\n\nThe first two characters are BR (valid from a stamp), then the next two are BB. How is that possible?\n\nThe first two are from a BR stamp. The next two B's: the third character (B) could be from a stamp's second cell (BR), and the fourth B could be from a stamp's first cell (RB). So the third and fourth characters are set by different stamps. So the segment length is even, but the two B's are allowed.\n\nSo the condition for a segment is that its length is even, and the characters alternate between R and B, but allowing for some exceptions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each segment must have even length, and the first and last characters must be different?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe segment \"BRBB\" has length 4. The first character is B, last is B \u2192 same. So that would violate that condition. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps each segment must have even length, and the characters alternate between R and B, but allowing for the possibility of overlapping stamps?\n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters are different. But in the example's segment \"BRBB\", the third and fourth are B and B \u2192 same. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Let me think of the code's current approach. The code splits the string into non-W segments. For each segment, it checks some condition. If any segment fails, output NO.\n\nThe problem is to find what condition each segment must satisfy.\n\nLet me think of the possible valid segments:\n\n- \"RB\" \u2192 valid (length 2, even).\n\n- \"BR\" \u2192 valid.\n\n- \"BRB\" \u2192 length 3 (odd) \u2192 invalid.\n\n- \"BRBB\" \u2192 length 4 even. But the last two are BB \u2192 but it's allowed in the example.\n\n- \"BB\" \u2192 length 2 even \u2192 but invalid.\n\nSo the length being even is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nWhat's the difference between \"BRBB\" and \"BB\"?\n\nIn \"BRBB\", the first two are BR (valid), then the next two could be set by a stamp on positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 which would set them to R and B. But then the third character would be R, not B. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the segment must not have two consecutive same characters. But in the example's segment, there are two B's in a row, so that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the segment must be such that the number of R's and B's are equal? Let's see:\n\nIn \"BRBB\", there are 1 R and 3 B's \u2192 total 4 (even), but counts are not equal. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, the total R+B must be even, but individual segments can have any counts as long as the total is even.\n\nHmm, perhaps each segment must have an even length, and the first and last characters are different?\n\nIn \"BRBB\" \u2192 first B, last B \u2192 same \u2192 violates this. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the segment must be such that it can be partitioned into pairs of RB or BR.\n\nFor example, \"BRBB\" can be partitioned as BR and BB \u2192 but BB can't be a pair. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, overlapping pairs?\n\nBRBB can be viewed as BR and RB (overlapping at the second and third characters). Let's see:\n\nThe first two are BR (valid), then the next two (positions 1-2: R and B \u2192 RB \u2192 valid), and the last two (positions 2-3: B and B \u2192 invalid). So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is really tricky. Let me think of the problem differently.\n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells. The final colors of those two cells must be R and B in some order. But overlapping stamps can overwrite previous colors. So the final colors of any two adjacent cells must be achievable by some sequence of stamps.\n\nWait, but for two adjacent cells, their final colors must be either R and B in some order, or one of them could be W? No, because if they are non-W, then they must have been set by a stamp.\n\nWait, no. The W's are the cells that were never stamped. So any non-W cell must have been stamped at least once. So two adjacent non-W cells must have been set by at least one stamp covering them. But the last stamp that covered them must have set them to R and B in some order. So the two adjacent non-W cells must be R and B in some order.\n\nAh! This is the key!\n\nBecause the last stamp that affected both of them must have set them to either RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W cells must be R and B in some order. So the two adjacent non-W characters must be different.\n\nThis would explain why the example's final string has two B's in a row. Wait, but in the example's final string, the two B's are adjacent and non-W. That would violate this condition. So there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, the example's final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. They are adjacent and non-W. So according to this condition, that would be invalid. But the example says it is possible. So this must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so what's the problem here?\n\nAh! Wait, the two B's are adjacent, but perhaps the last stamp that affected them did not cover both. For example, the fourth character (position3) might have been set by a stamp that didn't include the third character (position2). So the last stamp that affected position2 was a different one than the one that affected position3.\n\nIn that case, the two B's are adjacent but were not set by the same stamp's last application. So their colors can be the same.\n\nSo the condition is that for any two adjacent non-W cells, there must exist a stamp that covers them and set them to R and B in some order. But if they were set by different stamps, then their colors can be the same.\n\nWait, but the last stamp that affected both of them must have set them to R and B. Because any previous stamps that affected them could have been overwritten by later stamps.\n\nSo the final colors of two adjacent non-W cells must be R and B in some order. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nBut in the example's final string, the third and fourth characters are both B. So that would violate this condition. But the example says it is possible. So this must be wrong.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me re-examine the example's final string and steps.\n\nThe example's final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. How did that happen?\n\nLooking at the example's steps:\n\nThe third step is applying the stamp to positions 1-2 (the R and R from the previous step). The stamp is applied as RB, so the two R's become R and B. So after that, the string becomes B R B followed by B (from the second step's fourth character) and W.\n\nWait, the fourth character was already B from the second step. So the third step's stamp on positions 1-2 doesn't affect the fourth character. So the fourth character remains B. So the third and fourth characters are B and B. But the last stamp that affected the third character was the third step's stamp (position2 is the second cell of the stamp, set to B). The fourth character was set by the first stamp (position3 was set to B in the first step). So the fourth character's last stamp was the first one, and the third character's last stamp was the third one. So the two B's are adjacent but were set by different stamps. Thus, their colors are both B, but there's no stamp that covers both of them in their last application. So the condition that adjacent non-W must be R and B in some order is not required.\n\nThis suggests that the condition is not that adjacent non-W must be different. So I'm back to square one.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that each non-W segment must have even length. Because each stamp affects two cells, so the number of non-W cells must be even. But the example's segment \"BRBB\" has length 4 (even), which is okay. The \"BB\" segment has length 2 (even) but is impossible. So that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, the \"BB\" segment has length 2 even, but it's impossible. So the length being even is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: the segment must be such that the number of R's and B's are equal. Because each stamp adds one R and one B. So the total R and B must be equal in each segment?\n\nWait, in the example's segment \"BRBB\", there are 1 R and 3 B's \u2192 total R+B is 4 (even), but R and B counts are not equal. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Let me think of the code's current approach. The code splits the string into non-W segments. For each segment, it checks some condition. The code currently has a for loop over each segment, and if any segment fails the condition, output NO.\n\nThe problem is to find what condition each segment must satisfy.\n\nLooking at the test cases:\n\nTest case where the segment is \"BB\" (length 2):\n\nThis is impossible. So the condition must reject this.\n\nTest case where the segment is \"BRBB\" (length 4):\n\nThis is possible. So the condition must accept this.\n\nTest case where the segment is \"BRB\" (length 3):\n\nImpossible (odd length).\n\nTest case where the segment is \"BRBR\" (length 4):\n\nPossible.\n\nTest case where the segment is \"BRRB\" (length 4):\n\nPossible.\n\nTest case where the segment is \"RBRB\" (length 4):\n\nPossible.\n\nTest case where the segment is \"RBBR\" (length 4):\n\nPossible?\n\nYes. For example, first stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R, then on 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. So the string is BRBR. To get RBBR:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, and next W becomes R \u2192 so positions 1-2 are B R.\n\nThird stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, next W becomes R \u2192 so the string is R B B R.\n\nSo yes, possible.\n\nSo the segment \"RBBR\" is valid.\n\nNow, what's the common condition between valid segments like \"BRBB\", \"BRBR\", \"BRRB\", \"RBBR\", etc.?\n\nLooking at \"BRBB\":\n\nThe first two are BR (valid), then the next two are BB. But the last two can't be formed by a single stamp. However, the third character (B) is from a previous stamp's second cell (BR), and the fourth character (B) is from a previous stamp's first cell (BR). So the two B's are allowed because they were set by different stamps.\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is that the entire segment can be partitioned into pairs of R and B in some order, possibly overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters are either RB or BR, but allowing for some exceptions as long as the total length is even.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must have even length, and the first and last characters are different.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n\"BRBB\" \u2192 first B, last B \u2192 same \u2192 violates this.\n\n\"BRBR\" \u2192 first B, last R \u2192 different \u2192 okay.\n\n\"BRRB\" \u2192 first B, last B \u2192 same \u2192 violates.\n\nBut \"BRRB\" is possible. So that's not it.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the segment must be such that the number of R's and B's differ by zero or one? No, in \"BRBB\" it's 1 R and 3 B's \u2192 difference 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire segment must be able to be formed by a series of stamps, each of which sets two adjacent cells to RB or BR. The order of stamps can be anything, but the final result must be the segment.\n\nThis is equivalent to the segment being able to be formed by a sequence of such operations.\n\nTo model this, perhaps the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters are either RB or BR, or there exists a way to form the segment through overlapping stamps.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the segment must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B. For example, \"BRBB\" can be viewed as BR and RB (overlapping at the second and third characters). The first two are BR, the next two (positions 1-2: R and B \u2192 RB), and the last two (positions 2-3: B and B \u2192 no). So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that the first and last characters are different, and the length is even.\n\nNo, because \"BRBB\" has first and last B \u2192 same, but it's possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment has even length, and the number of R's and B's must have the same parity (which they always do since the total is even), but also that the sequence can be formed by some stamps.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that every two consecutive characters are different. Because each stamp sets two adjacent cells to different colors. But overlapping stamps can change this.\n\nWait, in the example's segment \"BRBB\", the third and fourth characters are B and B \u2192 same. So that would violate this condition. But the example is possible. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment has even length, and the first and last characters are different.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n\"BRBB\" has length 4 even, first B and last B \u2192 same \u2192 violates \u2192 but it's possible. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a graph. Each state is the current string, and edges are stamp applications. We need to see if the target is reachable. But this is impractical for large n.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of parity.\n\nEach stamp changes two cells to R and B. So the parity of the number of R's and B's must be the same (each stamp adds one R and one B).\n\nThe total R + B must be even.\n\nAdditionally, each non-W segment must have even length.\n\nBecause each stamp affects two cells, so the number of non-W cells must be even.\n\nWait, the example's segment \"BRBB\" has length 4 (even), which is okay. The \"BB\" segment has length 2 (even), but it's impossible. So even length is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nSo what else?\n\nThe segment must not have two consecutive same characters. Because each stamp sets two adjacent cells to different colors. But overlapping stamps can change this.\n\nWait, but in the example's segment, there are two B's in a row. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment has even length and the first and last characters are different.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor \"BRBB\" \u2192 first B, last B \u2192 same \u2192 violates \u2192 but it's possible. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of alternating R and B, possibly with some W's in between. But the W's are not part of the segment.\n\nWait, the segment is non-W, so no W's.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment has even length and the number of R's and B's are both even or both odd. But since their sum is even, they must have the same parity. So that's always true.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of the \"BB\" segment. It has length 2 even. The counts are B:2, R:0 \u2192 even counts. But it's impossible.\n\nSo what's the difference between \"BB\" and \"BRBB\"?\n\nIn \"BB\", the two B's can't be formed by any single stamp. Because a single stamp would set them to RB or BR. To get BB, you need to have two stamps that somehow set both to B. But each stamp can only set one to B and the other to R. So it's impossible.\n\nSo the problem is that the two B's can't be formed by any combination of stamps covering them.\n\nSo the two B's must be set by different stamps that don't cover both.\n\nBut how can that be?\n\nFor example, to get \"BB\":\n\nSuppose first stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThen stamp on positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. So the string becomes R B \u2192 not BB.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B.\n\nSecond stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R \u2192 no.\n\nHmm, no way to get BB.\n\nSo the segment \"BB\" is invalid.\n\nThe segment \"BRBB\" can be formed as follows:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nSecond stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThird stamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 R and B \u2192 R becomes R, B becomes B \u2192 so the string becomes B R B R.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of the example's steps:\n\nThe example's final string is B R B B W.\n\nThe steps were:\n\n1. Stamp on 3-4 (assuming 0-based) \u2192 positions 3 and 4 become R B \u2192 the string is WW RB W.\n\n2. Stamp on 0-1 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R followed by R B W \u2192 B R R B W.\n\n3. Stamp on 1-2 (R and R) as RB \u2192 R becomes R, next becomes B \u2192 so positions 1-2 become R B \u2192 the string becomes B R B B W.\n\nSo the third stamp is applied to positions 1-2 (R and R) as RB \u2192 which sets them to R and B. So the third character (position2) becomes B, and the fourth character (position3) was already B from the first stamp. So the fourth character remains B.\n\nThus, the two B's are at positions 2 and 3. The fourth character was set by the first stamp, and the third by the third stamp. So the two B's are allowed because they were set by different stamps.\n\nSo the key is that the two B's are not part of the same stamp's pair in their last application.\n\nThus, the condition for a segment is that it has even length, and the entire segment can be formed by a series of stamps such that every pair of adjacent characters in the segment can be explained by some stamp's application.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nPerhaps the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters are either RB or BR, or there exists a way to form the segment through overlapping stamps.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B.\n\nWait, the segment \"BRBB\" can be viewed as:\n\nBR (first two), then RB (positions 1-2: R and B), then BB (positions 2-3: B and B \u2192 no).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that the first and last characters are different, and the length is even.\n\nNo, because \"BRBB\" has first and last B \u2192 same.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment has even length and the number of R's and B's are both even or both odd. But since their sum is even, they must have the same parity. So that's always true.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the segment must be such that the number of R's and B's are equal. Because each stamp adds one R and one B. So the total R and B must be equal in the entire string. But the example's segment has 1 R and 3 B's \u2192 total 4, but R and B counts are not equal. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, the total R and B in the entire string must be even, but individual segments can have any counts as long as their sum is even.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment has even length and the first and last characters are different.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor \"BRBB\" \u2192 first B, last B \u2192 same \u2192 violates \u2192 but it's possible. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment has even length and the number of R's and B's are both even or both odd. But that's always true.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the code's current approach.\n\nThe code splits the string into non-W segments. For each segment, it checks some condition. The code currently has a for loop over each segment, and if any segment fails the condition, output NO.\n\nThe problem is to find what condition each segment must satisfy.\n\nThe example's segment \"BRBB\" is valid.
