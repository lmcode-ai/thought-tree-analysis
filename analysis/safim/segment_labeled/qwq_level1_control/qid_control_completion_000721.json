But wait, since the previous conditions have already checked for higher divisions, if we reach this elif, then n is already less than 1600. So the condition here can be simplified. Let's see:\n\nThe current code structure is:\n\nif n >=1900: Div1\nelif 1600 <= n <1900: Div2 (but written as n >=1600 and n <1900) elif ... : Div3\nelse: Div4\n\nWait, the second condition is written as \"n >=1600 and n <1900\", which is the same as 1600 <= n <= 1899. So after that, the next condition for Division3 is 1400 <= n <=1599. But since the previous condition was n <1600, the upper bound here would be 1599. So the condition for Division3 can be n >=1400. Because if it's less than 1600, and >=1400, then it's between 1400 and 1599. So the third elif should check if n is >=1400. Then, if that's true, it's Division3. Otherwise, the else (which is Division4) will handle the rest (n <1400). So the missing line is \"elif n >=1400:\". Wait, let me test this logic. Let's take the example given in the notes. For the sixth test case, 1679: that's in Div2. Let's see:\n\n1679 is >=1600 and <1900 \u2192 Div2, so that's correct. The fifth test case is 1400. So 1400 is >=1400 \u2192 so the third condition would trigger, so Div3. Correct. What about 1399? Then, the first two conditions are false, then the third condition (n >=1400) is false, so it goes to else, which is Div4. That's correct. Another example: 1500 \u2192 meets the third condition (>=1400), so Div3. Correct. And for 1300, it would go to else, Div4. So yes, that works. So the code for the third elif should be \"elif n >= 1400:\". Therefore, the missing code is \"elif n >= 1400\". So replacing the TODO line with that condition. The code would then be:\n\nelif n >= 1400:\n    print(\"Division 3\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Division 4\") So the code the user needs to fill in is the condition for the third elif. The existing code has \"elif # TODO: Your code here\" so the line should be completed with the condition. Therefore, the missing code is \"elif n >=1400:\". I think that's all. Let me check again the code structure. The existing code after the first two conditions would check the third condition. So yes, that's correct.",
