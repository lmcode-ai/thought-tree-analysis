So the problem reduces to finding the largest S such that S <= ceil(n/2) and the sum of the first n blocks' lengths is >= S\u00b2. Wait, but how do I compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks? Each block i has length ceil(i/2). Let's see:\n\nFor i from 1 to n, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). Let me compute this sum. Let's see:\n\nceil(i/2) for i=1 is 1, i=2 is 1, i=3 is 2, i=4 is 2, etc. So for even i, ceil(i/2) = i/2, for odd i, it's (i+1)/2. So the sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,... up to n terms. The sum can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me think of the terms as pairs. For each pair (2k-1, 2k), their sum is k + k = 2k. For example, terms 1 and 2 (k=1) sum to 1+1=2, which is 2*1. Terms 3 and 4 (k=2) sum to 2+2=4=2*2, etc. Suppose n is even: n=2m. Then there are m pairs, each contributing 2k for k from 1 to m. The total sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). If n is odd: n=2m+1. Then there are m pairs (summing to m(m+1)), plus the last term which is m+1 (since the next term after 2m is 2m+1, ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1). So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Wait let me check: For n=5 (odd, 2m+1 where m=2):\n\nsum is 1+1+2+2+3 = 9. (m+1)^2 = 3^2=9. Correct. For n=4 (even, m=2):\n\nsum is 1+1+2+2 =6. m(m+1)=2*3=6. Correct. So the formula for the sum S_total(n) is:\n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, since for n even, m = n/2, so m(m+1). For n odd, m = (n-1)/2, so (m+1)^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2. Alternatively, we can write it as:\n\nsum = floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2) ? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait for n even:\n\nn=2m, then (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = m*(m+1). (n+1)/2 is (2m+1)/2 = m + 0.5, so floor is m, ceil is m+1. So product is m*(m+1). So yes. For n odd, n=2m+1, then (n+1)/2 is (2m+2)/2 = m+1. So floor and ceil are same, so (m+1)^2. So yes. Therefore, the sum can be written as floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). But since floor and ceil multiply to the same as the product of the two terms when split, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nsum = ((n +1)/2) * ( (n)/2 + 1 ) ? Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute m = (n +1)/2 when n is odd, but maybe it's easier to compute it as:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) ) * ( (n+1)//2 ) Wait, let me see:\n\nFor even n=2m:\n\nn//2 is m, (n+1)//2 is m (since 2m+1 divided by 2 is m.5 floored to m). Wait no, (2m+1)//2 is m. So (n//2) is m, (n+1)//2 is m. So m * (m) ? Wait that's not right. Wait, perhaps I need to think again. Wait, let me think of m as floor(n/2). Then the sum is m*(m+1). Because for even n=2m, m = n/2, so m*(m+1). For odd n=2m+1, m = (n-1)/2, so m+1 = (n+1)/2. So the sum is (m+1)^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2. So the sum can be written as m*(m+1) when n is even, and (m+1)^2 when n is odd, where m = floor(n/2). Alternatively, the sum can be written as floor(n/2) * (floor(n/2)+1) + (n mod 2)*(floor(n/2)+1). Wait, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nWait for n even:\n\nsum = m*(m+1), where m = n/2.\n\nfor n odd:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2, where m = (n-1)/2. So, in code terms, the sum can be calculated as:\n\nm = n / 2;\n\nsum = m * (m + 1) + (n % 2) * (m + 1); Wait, let's see:\n\nFor even n:\n\nn mod 2 is 0, so sum is m*(m+1) + 0 = m(m+1). Correct. For odd n:\n\nn mod 2 is 1, so sum is m*(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1). Correct. Yes, so that formula works. So sum = m*(m+1) + (n%2)*(m+1), where m = n//2. Alternatively, sum can be written as (m + (n%2)) * (m +1). Because m + (n%2) is m+1 when n is odd, m when even. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nWait m = n//2. For even n, n%2 is 0, so (m +0)*(m+1) = m(m+1). For odd n, (m+1)*(m+1). So yes, sum = (m + (n%2)) * (m+1). Wait, no, m + (n%2) would be m +1 when n is odd (since n%2 is 1). So (m+1)*(m+1) = (m+1)^2. So yes, that works. So sum = ( (n//2) + (n%2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 ) Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute m = (n +1)//2. Then sum = m * (m - (n%1? no, perhaps not. Let me think again. Alternatively, the sum can be written as floor( (n+1)/2 ) * ceil( n/2 ), but I'm getting confused here. Maybe better to code it as:\n\nsum = (n / 2) * ( (n +1)/2 )\n\nWait let's test for n=5:\n\nn/2 is 2 (integer division), (n+1)/2 is 3. 2*3=6? But the actual sum is 9. So that's not right. Hmm, so that approach is wrong. Wait, so the correct formula is:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 ) + (n % 2)*( (n//2)+1 )\n\nWait for n=5:\n\nn//2 is 2, n%2 is 1. So 2*3 + 1*3 = 6 +3 =9. Correct. For n=4: 2*3 +0*3=6. Correct. Yes, so that formula works. So the sum of all the blocks up to n is S_total = m*(m+1) + (n%2)*(m+1), where m = n//2. Alternatively, S_total = (m + (n%2))*(m+1).",

First, the code given in the problem is:\n\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\n   int t,x;\n   cin>>t;\n   while(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n       long long int n;\n       cin>>n;\n       x = ceil((long double) n/2);\n       cout<<x<<endl;\n   }\n}\n\nWait, the loop is missing. The while loop's condition is missing. The original code probably had while(t--) but the user hasn't filled it in. So first, the loop should be while(t--) { ... } But the code currently has a variable x which is set to ceil(n/2), then outputs x. But that's not correct. Because the sample input for n=5 gives 3, which is correct (since ceil(5/2)=3). But in the sample, the answer is indeed 3. Wait, but according to the problem's first note, the first test case (probably n=1) would output 1, which is correct. So why is the code wrong?",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem correctly. Let's read the problem again carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using some of the given n rectangular blocks. Each block i has a length of ceil(i/2) and height 1. The square must be formed without rotating the blocks, so the blocks are placed such that their 1-unit height contributes to the square's height. Wait, but the square's side is the same in both dimensions. Since each block is 1 high, the total height of the arrangement can't exceed the side length. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the square's side length S must be such that the total area of the blocks used is at least S\u00b2. Because each block's area is 1 * ceil(i/2), so summing those up must be >= S\u00b2. But also, the arrangement must fit into an S x S square. However, since the blocks are 1 unit high, stacking them vertically would require that the sum of their heights (each 1) in each column doesn't exceed S. But maybe the key is to maximize S such that the total area is sufficient and the arrangement is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the largest S where the sum of the lengths of the blocks is at least S\u00b2, and also the maximum individual block's length is <= S. Because each row of the square must be covered by the blocks' lengths. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nThe square has side length S. So each row of the square must be covered by the blocks' lengths. Since each block is 1 unit high, each block can be placed in a row, contributing its length to that row. The total length in each row must be exactly S. But since we can choose which blocks to use, perhaps the problem is to arrange the blocks such that the sum of their lengths is at least S\u00b2 (since each of the S rows needs S length). But also, the maximum length of any block used must be <= S, because otherwise that block can't fit into a row of length S. Wait, no, because the block's length is the horizontal dimension. So each block's length must be <= S, otherwise it can't fit into a row. So the maximum block length in the selected set must be <= S. But the blocks are given up to n, so the maximum possible block length in the first n blocks is ceil(n/2). So S can't be larger than that. Wait, but maybe the maximum possible S is the minimum between the maximum possible based on total area and the maximum block length.\n\nHmm, so the approach is to find the largest S such that two conditions are met:\n\n1. The sum of the lengths of all blocks up to some k (maybe all n blocks) is at least S\u00b2.\n\n2. The maximum block length (ceil(i/2) for i up to n) is at least S. Wait, no, the maximum block length must be <= S, because otherwise you can't include that block. Wait, no, the maximum block length in the selected blocks must be <= S. But to maximize S, perhaps the maximum possible S is the maximum between the two constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum S is the largest integer where the sum of all the blocks' lengths (up to n) is at least S\u00b2, and also the maximum block length (ceil(n/2)) is at least S. Wait, no, the maximum block length is ceil(n/2), so S can't be larger than that. Because if S is larger than the maximum block length, then you can't have a row of length S. Because each row must be exactly S, and each block in that row contributes to the length. So the maximum block length must be <= S. Wait, no, the maximum block length can be up to S. Because if a block has length exactly S, then it can be placed in a row. But if a block's length is longer than S, then it can't be placed in any row. So the maximum block length in the set of blocks we choose must be <= S. But since the blocks are numbered up to n, the maximum possible block length is ceil(n/2). Therefore, S can't be larger than ceil(n/2). So the maximum possible S is at most ceil(n/2). But also, the total area must be at least S\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest S such that S <= ceil(n/2) and the sum of the first n blocks' lengths is >= S\u00b2.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the sum of the lengths of the first n blocks?\n\nEach block i has length ceil(i/2). Let's see:\n\nFor i from 1 to n, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet me compute this sum. Let's see:\n\nceil(i/2) for i=1 is 1, i=2 is 1, i=3 is 2, i=4 is 2, etc. So for even i, ceil(i/2) = i/2, for odd i, it's (i+1)/2.\n\nSo the sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,... up to n terms.\n\nThe sum can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me think of the terms as pairs. For each pair (2k-1, 2k), their sum is k + k = 2k. For example, terms 1 and 2 (k=1) sum to 1+1=2, which is 2*1. Terms 3 and 4 (k=2) sum to 2+2=4=2*2, etc.\n\nSuppose n is even: n=2m. Then there are m pairs, each contributing 2k for k from 1 to m. The total sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1).\n\nIf n is odd: n=2m+1. Then there are m pairs (summing to m(m+1)), plus the last term which is m+1 (since the next term after 2m is 2m+1, ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1). So total sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nFor n=5 (odd, 2m+1 where m=2):\n\nsum is 1+1+2+2+3 = 9. (m+1)^2 = 3^2=9. Correct.\n\nFor n=4 (even, m=2):\n\nsum is 1+1+2+2 =6. m(m+1)=2*3=6. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for the sum S_total(n) is:\n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, since for n even, m = n/2, so m(m+1). For n odd, m = (n-1)/2, so (m+1)^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as:\n\nsum = floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2) ?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait for n even:\n\nn=2m, then (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = m*(m+1).\n\n(n+1)/2 is (2m+1)/2 = m + 0.5, so floor is m, ceil is m+1. So product is m*(m+1). So yes.\n\nFor n odd, n=2m+1, then (n+1)/2 is (2m+2)/2 = m+1. So floor and ceil are same, so (m+1)^2. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the sum can be written as floor((n+1)/2) * ceil((n+1)/2). But since floor and ceil multiply to the same as the product of the two terms when split, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\nsum = ((n +1)/2) * ( (n)/2 + 1 ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute m = (n +1)/2 when n is odd, but maybe it's easier to compute it as:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) ) * ( (n+1)//2 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFor even n=2m:\n\nn//2 is m, (n+1)//2 is m (since 2m+1 divided by 2 is m.5 floored to m). Wait no, (2m+1)//2 is m. So (n//2) is m, (n+1)//2 is m. So m * (m) ?\n\nWait that's not right. Wait, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nWait, let me think of m as floor(n/2). Then the sum is m*(m+1). Because for even n=2m, m = n/2, so m*(m+1). For odd n=2m+1, m = (n-1)/2, so m+1 = (n+1)/2. So the sum is (m+1)^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2. So the sum can be written as m*(m+1) when n is even, and (m+1)^2 when n is odd, where m = floor(n/2).\n\nAlternatively, the sum can be written as floor(n/2) * (floor(n/2)+1) + (n mod 2)*(floor(n/2)+1). Wait, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nWait for n even:\n\nsum = m*(m+1), where m = n/2.\n\nfor n odd:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2, where m = (n-1)/2.\n\nSo, in code terms, the sum can be calculated as:\n\nm = n / 2;\n\nsum = m * (m + 1) + (n % 2) * (m + 1);\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even n:\n\nn mod 2 is 0, so sum is m*(m+1) + 0 = m(m+1). Correct.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nn mod 2 is 1, so sum is m*(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1). Correct.\n\nYes, so that formula works. So sum = m*(m+1) + (n%2)*(m+1), where m = n//2.\n\nAlternatively, sum can be written as (m + (n%2)) * (m +1). Because m + (n%2) is m+1 when n is odd, m when even. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nWait m = n//2. For even n, n%2 is 0, so (m +0)*(m+1) = m(m+1). For odd n, (m+1)*(m+1). So yes, sum = (m + (n%2)) * (m+1). Wait, no, m + (n%2) would be m +1 when n is odd (since n%2 is 1). So (m+1)*(m+1) = (m+1)^2. So yes, that works. So sum = ( (n//2) + (n%2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute m = (n +1)//2. Then sum = m * (m - (n%1? no, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the sum can be written as floor( (n+1)/2 ) * ceil( n/2 ), but I'm getting confused here. Maybe better to code it as:\n\nsum = (n / 2) * ( (n +1)/2 )\n\nWait let's test for n=5:\n\nn/2 is 2 (integer division), (n+1)/2 is 3. 2*3=6? But the actual sum is 9. So that's not right. Hmm, so that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so the correct formula is:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 ) + (n % 2)*( (n//2)+1 )\n\nWait for n=5:\n\nn//2 is 2, n%2 is 1. So 2*3 + 1*3 = 6 +3 =9. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: 2*3 +0*3=6. Correct.\n\nYes, so that formula works.\n\nSo the sum of all the blocks up to n is S_total = m*(m+1) + (n%2)*(m+1), where m = n//2.\n\nAlternatively, S_total = (m + (n%2))*(m+1). Because m + (n%2) is m+1 when n is odd, m when even. So (m + (n%2))*(m+1) would be m*(m+1) when even, (m+1)^2 when odd. Which is correct.\n\nSo S_total = ( (n//2) + (n%2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 )\n\nWait, n//2 + (n%2) is equal to ceil(n/2). Because for even n, n//2 = n/2, and n%2 is 0, so it's n/2. For odd n, n//2 is (n-1)/2, and adding 1 (since n%2 is 1) gives (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2. So yes, that's ceil(n/2). So S_total = ceil(n/2) * ( floor(n/2) +1 )\n\nHmm, but perhaps the easiest way to compute it in code is:\n\nlong long m = n / 2;\n\nlong long sum = m * (m + 1) + (n % 2) * (m + 1);\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum S such that S^2 <= sum, and S <= ceil(n/2). Because the maximum possible S can't exceed the maximum block length, which is ceil(n/2). Because the largest block is the nth one, which has length ceil(n/2). So if S is larger than that, then even that block can't fit into a row of length S. So the constraints are:\n\nS must be <= ceil(n/2), and S^2 <= sum.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible S is the minimum between the floor of sqrt(sum) and ceil(n/2). Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe maximum S is the largest integer S where S <= ceil(n/2) and S^2 <= sum.\n\nSo the maximum possible S is the minimum between the floor of sqrt(sum) and ceil(n/2). Wait, not exactly. Because maybe sqrt(sum) is larger than ceil(n/2). In that case, the maximum S is ceil(n/2). But if sqrt(sum) is smaller than ceil(n/2), then the maximum S is floor(sqrt(sum)).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose sum is 10, and ceil(n/2) is 4. Then sqrt(10) is ~3.16, so floor is 3. But since 3 <4, then S can be 3. But maybe 4^2 is 16 which is larger than 10, so no. So the maximum S is 3.\n\nAnother example: if sum is 25, and ceil(n/2) is 5. Then sqrt(25)=5, so S is 5, which is okay.\n\nAnother case: sum is 20, ceil(n/2)=4. sqrt(20) is ~4.47, floor is 4. So S can be 4, since 4^2=16 <=20 and 4 <=4. So yes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 10, ceil(n/2)=3. Then sqrt(10) is ~3.16, floor is 3. Since 3 <=3, then S is 3.\n\nWait, so the maximum S is the minimum between ceil(n/2) and floor(sqrt(sum)), but only if that floor is <= ceil(n/2). Wait, no. Because the maximum possible S is the largest S where S <= ceil(n/2) and S^2 <= sum. So the maximum S is the minimum between ceil(n/2) and floor(sqrt(sum)), but actually, it's the minimum of the two, but only if the floor is less than or equal to ceil(n/2). Wait, no. Let me think of it as the minimum between the two values, but actually, the correct S is the minimum between the two, but only if the floor is less than or equal to ceil(n/2). Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the maximum S such that S <= ceil(n/2) and S^2 <= sum. So the maximum possible S is the minimum between ceil(n/2) and floor(sqrt(sum)), but only if that floor is less than or equal to ceil(n/2). Wait, no. Let me think of it as:\n\nThe maximum S is the minimum between ceil(n/2) and floor(sqrt(sum)), but actually, it's the minimum between the two, but only if the floor is less than or equal to ceil(n/2). Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute S_max = min(ceil(n/2), floor(sqrt(sum))). But that's not correct. Because suppose sum is 25 and ceil(n/2) is 5. Then floor(sqrt(25)) is 5, so min(5,5)=5, which is correct. If sum is 24 and ceil(n/2)=5, then floor(sqrt(24)) is 4. So min(5,4)=4. Which is correct because 4^2=16 <=24, and 5^2=25>24. So yes, that works.\n\nAnother case: sum is 30, ceil(n/2)=5. sqrt(30) is ~5.47, floor is 5. So min(5,5) is 5. 5^2=25 <=30, so yes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 30, ceil(n/2)=6. Then floor(sqrt(30)) is 5. So min(6,5)=5. But 5^2=25 <=30, and 6^2=36>30. So correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 36, ceil(n/2)=6. Then floor(sqrt(36))=6. So min(6,6)=6. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 37, ceil(n/2)=6. Then floor(sqrt(37)) is 6. So min(6,6)=6. 6^2=36 <=37. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 36, ceil(n/2)=5. Then floor(sqrt(36))=6. But since ceil(n/2)=5, the maximum S is 5. Because 5^2=25 <=36, but 6 is larger than 5. So the correct S is 5. So in this case, the minimum between 5 and 6 is 5, which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula S_max = min(ceil(n/2), floor(sqrt(sum))) is correct.\n\nWait, but in the case where sum is 36 and ceil(n/2)=5, then floor(sqrt(36)) is 6, but since 6>5, the maximum S is 5. So the minimum between 5 and 6 is 5, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum S is the minimum between ceil(n/2) and floor(sqrt(sum)).\n\nWait, but how do I compute that?\n\nWait, let me think of the steps:\n\nGiven n, compute sum = m*(m+1) + (n%2)*(m+1), where m = n//2.\n\nThen compute s1 = floor( sqrt(sum) )\n\ns2 = ceil(n/2)\n\nthen the answer is the minimum of s1 and s2.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, let's take the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSample input 2: n=5.\n\nsum for n=5 is 9. ceil(5/2)=3. sqrt(9)=3. So min(3,3)=3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: first test case, perhaps n=1. Then sum is 1. ceil(1/2)=1. So min(1,1)=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2. sum is 1+1=2. ceil(2/2)=1. sqrt(2)=1.414, floor is 1. So min(1,1)=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3. sum is 1+1+2=4. ceil(3/2)=2. sqrt(4)=2. So min(2,2)=2. So the maximum S is 2. Let's see: can we make a 2x2 square? The total area is 4, which is exactly 2\u00b2. So yes. The blocks are 1,1,2. So arranging them as two rows: first row uses the 2-length block (covers 2 units), second row uses the two 1's (sum to 2). So yes, possible. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6. Let's see:\n\nsum for n=6 is m=3, so 3*4 +0=12. ceil(6/2)=3. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor is 3. So min(3,3)=3. So S=3. The area needed is 9, which is less than 12. So possible. The maximum block length is 3 (since ceil(6/2)=3). So yes, possible.\n\nAnother case: n=7. sum is m=3 (7//2=3), so 3*4 +1*(4) = 12 +4=16. ceil(7/2)=4. sqrt(16)=4. So min(4,4)=4. So S=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=8. sum is m=4, so 4*5=20. ceil(8/2)=4. sqrt(20)=4.47, floor 4. So min(4,4)=4. So S=4. The area needed is 16, which is less than 20. So possible.\n\nAnother case where sum is larger than (ceil(n/2))^2. Let's see: n=4. sum is 6. ceil(4/2)=2. 2^2 is 4 <=6. So S=2. But if n=5, sum is 9, which is exactly 3^2. So okay.\n\nWait, let's think of a case where sum is larger than (ceil(n/2))^2. For example, n=6. sum is 12. ceil(n/2)=3. 3^2 is 9. 12>9. So the maximum S is 3. But since 3^2 is 9 <=12, and the maximum block length is 3, so yes. So the answer is 3.\n\nAnother example: n=7. sum is 16. ceil(n/2)=4. 4^2 is 16. So yes, S=4.\n\nAnother case: n=9. sum is m=4 (9//2=4), so 4*5 +1*5 =20+5=25. ceil(9/2)=5. sqrt(25)=5. So min(5,5)=5. So S=5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case where sum is more than (ceil(n/2))^2. Let's see n=10. sum is m=5, so 5*6=30. ceil(10/2)=5. 5^2 is 25. So the maximum S is 5. Because even though the sum is 30, the maximum block length is 5, so you can't have a square of 6. So yes, correct.\n\nAnother case where sum is less than (ceil(n/2))^2. Let's see: n=3. sum is 4. ceil(3/2)=2. 2^2 is 4. So okay.\n\nWait, what if n=4, sum is 6. ceil(n/2)=2. 2^2 is 4. So the maximum S is 2. Which is okay.\n\nHmm, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n.\n\n2. Compute s1 = floor( sqrt( sum ) )\n\n3. Compute s2 = ceil( n / 2 )\n\n4. The answer is the minimum of s1 and s2.\n\nWait, but wait, what if s1 is larger than s2? Then the minimum would be s2, which is correct because even though the sum allows a larger S, the block lengths can't exceed s2. So yes.\n\nSo the code needs to compute sum, then compute s1 and s2, then take the minimum.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, the code given in the problem is:\n\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\n   int t,x;\n   cin>>t;\n   while(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n       long long int n;\n       cin>>n;\n       x = ceil((long double) n/2);\n       cout<<x<<endl;\n   }\n}\n\nWait, the loop is missing. The while loop's condition is missing. The original code probably had while(t--) but the user hasn't filled it in. So first, the loop should be while(t--) { ... }\n\nBut the code currently has a variable x which is set to ceil(n/2), then outputs x. But that's not correct. Because the sample input for n=5 gives 3, which is correct (since ceil(5/2)=3). But in the sample, the answer is indeed 3. Wait, but according to the problem's first note, the first test case (probably n=1) would output 1, which is correct. So why is the code wrong?\n\nAh, because the problem requires that the sum of the blocks must be at least S\u00b2. So in some cases, even if the maximum possible S (ceil(n/2)) is possible, the sum may not be enough. Wait, but according to the formula, the sum is exactly (ceil(n/2))^2 when n is odd. For example, n=5, sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So in that case, the sum is exactly enough. But for even n, the sum is m*(m+1), where m = n/2. So for n=4, sum is 12, which is 3*4. The maximum possible S is min(2, sqrt(12)=3.464 floored to 3). Wait, but ceil(n/2) for n=4 is 2. So the minimum between 2 and 3 is 2. Which is correct. Because the maximum block length is 2, so you can't have a square of 3. So the code in the problem's initial code is wrong because it just outputs ceil(n/2), which would give 2 for n=4, which is correct. Wait, but in the code given, the code is:\n\nx = ceil(n/2), which for n=4 would be 2, which is correct. But for n=6, the code would output 3, which is correct. Wait, but in the case where the sum is sufficient for a higher S but the block length is limiting, then the code is correct. Wait, but in the case where the sum is more than (ceil(n/2))^2, then the code would still output ceil(n/2), which is correct. Because even though the sum allows a higher S, the block length can't exceed ceil(n/2). So the code is correct?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's take an example where the sum is more than (ceil(n/2))^2. Let's see n=6. The sum is 12. ceil(n/2)=3. 3^2 is 9. So the maximum S is 3, which is correct. The code would output 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=7. sum is 16, which is exactly 4^2. So code outputs 4, correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8. sum is 20. ceil(n/2)=4. sqrt(20)=4.47, floor is 4. So the minimum between 4 and 4 is 4. So code outputs 4, which is correct.\n\nWait, but what about a case where the sum is more than (ceil(n/2))^2, but the maximum S is still ceil(n/2). So the code is correct.\n\nWait, but what if the sum is less than (ceil(n/2))^2? For example, let's see n=3. The sum is 4, which is exactly (2)^2. So code outputs 2, correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2. sum is 2. ceil(2/2)=1. So code outputs 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, so in all the cases I can think of, the code is correct. Wait, but that contradicts the problem's sample input. Wait, the problem's first note says \"In the first test case, you can create a 1\u00d71 square using only one of the blocks.\" So first test case is n=1, which the code would output 1, correct.\n\nWait, but according to the problem's sample input 2 (n=5), the code would output 3, which is correct. So why is the code in the problem wrong?\n\nWait, the problem's code is:\n\nx = ceil( (long double) n/2 );\n\nSo for n=5, that gives 3, which is correct. So why is the problem's code wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: the maximum possible side length of a square you can create using these blocks, without rotating any of them. Note that you don't have to use all of the blocks.\n\nAh! Oh! Wait a minute. The code in the problem's initial code is using ceil(n/2), which is the maximum possible block length. But the problem requires that the sum of the selected blocks' lengths must be at least S\u00b2. So the code is wrong because it doesn't consider the sum. For example, suppose n is very large, but the sum is sufficient for a larger S than ceil(n/2). Wait, but that's impossible because the maximum block length is ceil(n/2), so S can't exceed that. Because each row must be exactly S in length, and each block in a row must have length <= S. So the maximum possible S is indeed the minimum between ceil(n/2) and floor(sqrt(sum)). But in the code given, it's just taking ceil(n/2), which would be correct only if the sum is sufficient. Wait, but in some cases, the sum may not be sufficient even for ceil(n/2). Wait, but when is that possible?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me think of a case where the sum is less than (ceil(n/2))^2. Then the code would output ceil(n/2), but the actual maximum S would be floor(sqrt(sum)), which is less than ceil(n/2). So the code would be wrong.\n\nWait, but according to the formula for the sum, when n is even:\n\nsum = m*(m+1), where m = n/2. The maximum possible S is min( m (since ceil(n/2) is m), and floor( sqrt(m*(m+1)) ) )\n\nWait, let's take n=4. m=2. sum is 2*3=6. ceil(n/2)=2. sqrt(6)=2.449, floor is 2. So min(2,2)=2. So code is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. m=3. sum=3*4=12. ceil(n/2)=3. sqrt(12)=3.464, floor 3. So min(3,3)=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5 (odd). sum is 3^2=9. ceil(n/2)=3. sqrt(9)=3. So correct.\n\nAnother case: n=7 (odd). sum is 4^2=16. ceil(n/2)=4. sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\nHmm, so when is the sum less than (ceil(n/2))^2?\n\nWait, let's see n=1. sum is 1. ceil(1/2)=1. 1^2=1. So okay.\n\nn=2: sum is 2. ceil(2/2)=1. 1^2=1. So sum is 2 >=1. So the maximum S is 1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but what about n=3. sum is 4. ceil(3/2)=2. 2^2 is 4. So okay.\n\nWait, so in all cases, the sum is exactly equal to or greater than (ceil(n/2))^2?\n\nWait, let's see for n=1: sum is 1, which equals (1)^2.\n\nn=2: sum is 2, which is greater than 1^2=1.\n\nn=3: sum is 4 equals 2^2.\n\nn=4: sum is 6, which is greater than 2^2=4.\n\nn=5: sum 9 equals 3^2.\n\nn=6: sum 12>3^2=9.\n\nn=7: sum 16=4^2.\n\nn=8: sum 20>4^2=16.\n\nSo in all cases, the sum is at least (ceil(n/2))^2. Because for even n=2m, sum is m(m+1). The ceil(n/2) is m. So m(m+1) is m\u00b2 +m, which is greater than m\u00b2. So the sum is more than (ceil(n/2))^2. So the floor of sqrt(sum) is at least m. So the minimum between m and floor(sqrt(sum)) is m. So the code's approach of outputting ceil(n/2) is correct.\n\nWait, but for even n=2m, the maximum possible S is m, since the maximum block length is m. So even though the sum is m(m+1) which is more than m\u00b2, the maximum S is m. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, so in all cases, the sum is sufficient to allow S = ceil(n/2). Because the sum is always at least (ceil(n/2))\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=2:\n\nceil(2/2)=1. sum is 2. 1^2 is 1. 2 >=1. So yes.\n\nn=4: sum 6 >= 2\u00b2=4.\n\nn=6: sum 12 >=3\u00b2=9.\n\nYes. So the sum is always sufficient to allow S = ceil(n/2). Because for even n=2m, sum is m(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m. Which is m\u00b2 + m >= m\u00b2. So sqrt(m(m+1)) is sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) which is greater than m. So floor of that is m or m+1?\n\nWait sqrt(m(m+1)) is between m and m+1. For example, m=2: sqrt(6)=2.449, floor is 2. So floor is m. So the floor of sqrt(sum) is m, which is equal to ceil(n/2). So the minimum between m and m is m.\n\nFor even n=2m, the maximum S is m, which is correct.\n\nFor odd n=2m+1, the sum is (m+1)^2, which is exactly (ceil(n/2))^2. So the floor of sqrt(sum) is m+1, which equals ceil(n/2). So the minimum is m+1.\n\nThus, in all cases, the maximum possible S is exactly ceil(n/2). So the code given in the problem is correct?\n\nWait, but that contradicts the problem's sample input. Wait, the problem's sample input 2 is n=5, which gives 3, which is correct. The code would output 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but then why is the problem's code wrong? Because the user is asking to complete the code. The original code has x = ceil(n/2), which is correct. But the problem's code may have a mistake in the loop?\n\nWait, looking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code has:\n\nint main(){\n   int t,x;\n   cin>>t;\n   while(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n       long long int n;\n       cin>>n;\n       x = ceil((long double) n/2);\n       cout<<x<<endl;\n   }\n}\n\nThe loop condition is missing. The user needs to fill in the loop condition. The loop should run t times, so the while loop should be while(t--) or while(t--). So the missing part is the loop condition.\n\nSo the code is almost correct except for the loop condition and the variable x. Wait, but the code uses x as an int, but n can be up to 1e9, so the sum can be up to (5e8)^2 (since for n=1e9, ceil(n/2) is 5e8, so sum is (5e8)^2). So x is declared as an int, which may overflow. Because 5e8 squared is 2.5e17, which is way larger than 2^31 (which is about 2e9). So x is declared as an int, which is 32 bits, so it can't hold that. So the code is wrong because of integer overflow.\n\nAh! That's the problem. The code uses x as an int, but when n is large (like 1e9), ceil(n/2) is 5e8, which is within the int's capacity (since 2^31 is about 2e9). Wait, 5e8 is 500 million, which is less than 2^31 (~2e9). So x can be stored as an int. But the problem is that the code is not computing the correct value. Wait, but according to our previous analysis, the code is correct. But why is the user asking to complete the code?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the square must be formed using the blocks. Each block is 1 unit high, so the total height of the square is S. So the number of rows must be exactly S. Each row must have a total length of S. The total area required is S^2. The sum of the lengths of the blocks must be at least S^2. But also, each block's length must be <= S, because they can't exceed the row's length. So the maximum block length must be <= S. The maximum block length is ceil(n/2). So S can't exceed that. But the sum must be at least S^2.\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, the sum is always at least (ceil(n/2))^2. So the maximum possible S is ceil(n/2). So the code is correct.\n\nWait, but let's see for n=1:\n\nsum is 1, which equals 1^2. So yes.\n\nn=2: sum is 2, which is more than 1^2. So yes.\n\nn=3: sum is 4 = 2^2. So yes.\n\nn=4: sum is 6>2^2=4.\n\nn=5: sum 9=3^2.\n\nn=6: sum 12>3^2=9.\n\nSo in all cases, the sum is sufficient. So the maximum S is indeed ceil(n/2).\n\nTherefore, the code is correct except for the loop condition and possible data type issues.\n\nWait, but the code uses x as an int. For n up to 1e9, ceil(n/2) can be up to 5e8, which is within the 32-bit integer's range (since 2^31 is about 2e9). So that's okay.\n\nThe problem with the code is the loop condition. The while loop's condition is missing. The user's code has:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nSo the loop should run t times. So the correct condition is while(t--) or while(t--).\n\nSo the missing code is 't--' in the while condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct code would be:\n\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\n   int t,x;\n   cin>>t;\n   while(t--){\n       long long int n;\n       cin>>n;\n       x = ceil((long double) n/2);\n       cout<<x<<endl;\n   }\n}\n\nWait, but the variable x is declared as an int. But when n is up to 1e9, ceil(n/2) can be up to 5e8, which is within int's range. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1e9, then ceil(1e9/2) is 500000000, which is 5e8, which is within 32-bit integer's capacity (since 2^31 is ~2e9). So yes.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct except for the loop condition. So the missing code is 't--' in the while loop.\n\nBut the user's problem says that the code has missing lines or blocks to fill in. The user's code currently has the while loop's condition as a comment. So the correct code for the while loop is while(t--).\n\nTherefore, the missing code is 't--' in the while loop's condition.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user wants the code that fills in the missing parts. The problem is that the while loop's condition is missing. So the missing code is 't--' in the while loop's condition.\n\nWait, but the code also has x declared as an int, but the calculation of x uses n which is a long long. But since n can be up to 1e9, ceil(n/2) is 5e8, which fits in an int. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the only missing part is the loop condition. So the correct code for the while loop is while(t--).\n\nHence, the missing code is 't--' in the while loop's condition.\n\nBut the user's code has:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nSo the missing code is 't--' inside the condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to replace the comment with 't--'.\n\nSo the missing code is 't--'.\n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. So the answer is to output 't--' in the while loop's condition.\n\nWait, but the user's code has:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nSo the missing code is the condition, which is 't--'.\n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is 't--'.\n\nHence, the answer is to fill in the while loop's condition with 't--'.\n\nSo the missing code is 't--'.\n\nTherefore, the correct code is:\n\nwhile(t--){\n\nSo the missing code is 't--'.\n\nThus, the answer is to output 't--' as the missing code.\n\nBut let me double-check the problem's sample input. The sample input 2 is n=5, which outputs 3. The code would do that. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only missing part is the loop condition."
