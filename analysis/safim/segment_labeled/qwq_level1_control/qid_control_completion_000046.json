The question is about Stanley and Megan moving in a grid, using portals to minimize their total energy. The code provided has a condition where if some criteria are met, the output is 0, else it's 2*min(n,m) + max(n,m) -2. Hmm, when would the total energy be zero? Well, the problem states that they can use portals left by Megan as she moves. Wait, Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So, the portals are available wherever Megan has been. So, for the total energy to be zero, maybe they start at the destination? Like, if the grid is 1x1? Let's see the input constraints. The problem says n and m are at least 1. Wait, the starting and ending points: Stanley starts at (1,1) and ends at (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and ends at (1,m). So if the grid is 1x1, then n=1 and m=1. Then Stanley's start and end are the same, same for Megan. So their required paths are zero steps. So the total energy would be 0. That's one case. But maybe there are other cases where their paths can be done without any movement? Like when their start and end points coincide? Let's see:\n\nFor Stanley's path, (1,1) must be (n,m). So n must be 1 and m must be 1. Similarly for Megan's path, her start (n,1) must be (1,m). So that would require n=1 and 1 = m? Or maybe other combinations? Wait Megan's end is (1, m). Her start is (n,1). So for Megan's start and end to be the same, (n,1) must equal (1,m). So n=1 and m=1. So again, only the 1x1 case. So the only time the answer is 0 is when n=1 and m=1.",

      "text": "Wait, but maybe there are other scenarios where their paths can be done using portals immediately. Let me think again. Suppose the grid is 1x2. Then Stanley needs to go from (1,1) to (1,2). Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, so lower-left is (1,1)), and her destination is (1,2). So both need to go to the same cell. So their paths are trivial. So the total energy would be 0? Wait in that case, n=1 and m=2. Then Stanley's path is just moving right once, but maybe they can use portals? Wait, Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). So she can just move directly. But the problem says they can split up. Wait, in this case, Megan's path is the same as Stanley's. So maybe they can just move together. Let me see:\n\nIn 1x2 grid, Stanley's start is (1,1), end (1,2). Megan's start is (1,1) (since n=1, so lower left is (1,1)), and her end is (1,2). So both need to go from (1,1) to (1,2). So their paths are the same. So the minimal energy would be Stanley moving right (1 step) and Megan also moving right (1 step). Total is 2. But according to the code's else part, when n=1 and m=2, the formula would be 2*min(1,2) + max(1,2) -2 \u2192 2*1 +2-2 = 2. So that's correct. So in this case, the answer is 2, not 0. So the only case when the answer is 0 is when n and m are both 1. Therefore, the condition for outputting 0 is when n ==1 and m ==1. So in the code's if statement, the condition should be (n ==1 && m ==1). Then the code would output 0, else the other formula. Wait, but let me check the note in the problem. The note's first test case's example has an output of 15. Let me see what their n and m are. The example mentions Megan moving to (7,3), so probably n is 7 and m is 5? Because Stanley ends at (7,5). So in that case, the formula would be 2*min(7,5) + max(7,5) -2 \u2192 2*5 +7-2 \u2192 10+5=15. Which matches the example's answer. So the formula works there. So the code's else part is correct. Therefore, the only time the if condition is true (so output 0) is when n and m are both 1. So the code's if statement should check if (n ==1 && m ==1). So the missing code in the if condition is (n == 1 && m ==1). Therefore, the code should have:\n\nif(n ==1 && m ==1) {\n   cout <<0;\n}\nelse ... So that's the missing part.",
