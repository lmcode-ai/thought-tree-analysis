Let's think: suppose the substring has k distinct characters. Then each character can appear at most k times.

So we don't add. \n\nThus, for the substring \"77\", the code would count only the first character (the single '7'), but the second character (the two '7's) is not counted. But according to the problem statement, the answer for \"77\" is 2 (the two single '7's). \n\nWait, but in the code's approach, for i=0, j=0 (substring \"7\") \u2192 counted. For i=0, j=1 (substring \"77\") \u2192 not counted. \n\nThen, when i=1 (starting at the second '7'), the inner loop runs j from 1 to min(1+100, 2). So j=1. The substring is \"7\" \u2192 counted. \n\nSo total is 2, which is correct. \n\nSo the code's logic works here. \n\nAnother example: \"1010\". Let's see. \n\nTake the substring \"1010\" (i=0, j=3). The distinct count is 2. The counts are 2 for '1' and '0'. The maximum is 2. So 2 (size) >= 2 \u2192 yes. So it would be counted. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is indeed the condition in the if statement. \n\nSo the correct code for the TODO is:\n\nmap.get(s.charAt(j)) > val\n\nSo the if condition is:\n\nif (map.get(s.charAt(j)) > val)\n\nTherefore, the missing code is that condition."
