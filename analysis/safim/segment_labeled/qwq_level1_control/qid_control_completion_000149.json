So the length of the substring is exactly T. Then, the cost would be T - L. But since L is the number of 1s in the substring, which can't exceed T (since T is the total 1s in the entire string).

The cost is the maximum between the number of 0s left in the string and the number of 1s removed. We need to find the minimum possible cost.\n\nHmm, the code given is a Java class with a main method. The code structure seems to read test cases, process each string, and then output the answer. The part that's missing is the loop where they initialize the array 'arr', which is supposed to be a prefix sum array, I think. Let me look at the code again.\n\nIn the code, inside the test case loop, they have a for loop with a TODO. The loop is supposed to fill the 'arr' array. The array 'arr' is of size 200005, which is probably to handle the maximum possible string length (since the input constraints say up to 2e5). The line inside the loop is arr[i+1] = arr[i] + s.charAt(i) - '0'. Oh right, because '0' is ASCII 48, so subtracting '0' converts the character to its integer value. So this is building a prefix sum array where arr[i] is the number of 1s in the first i characters. Because each character is either 0 or 1, adding them gives the count of 1s up to that position.\n\nWait, the prefix sum array here is for 1s. So arr[i] is the number of 1s in the first i characters (from 0 to i-1). So arr[n] is the total number of 1s in the entire string.\n\nThen, the code initializes ans as arr[n], which is the total 1s. Then there's a loop that iterates over i from 0 to some condition (i + arr[n] <= n). The inner part is trying to compute something and take the minimum. Let me think about what this loop is doing.\n\nThe problem's cost is the maximum between two values: the number of 0s left, and the number of 1s removed. Let's see:\n\nThe number of 0s left is equal to (total length after trimming) minus the number of 1s left. Because the total characters left is (end - start + 1), but the number of 1s left is (arr[end] - arr[start]). So 0s left would be (end - start + 1) - (arr[end] - arr[start]).\n\nThe number of 1s removed is the total 1s in the original string minus the 1s left. So that's (arr[n] - (arr[end] - arr[start])).\n\nThe cost is the maximum of these two values. We need to choose start and end such that start <= end, and find the minimum possible maximum of those two.\n\nHmm, the code's approach might be trying to find the optimal point where the two values are balanced. Let me see the code's logic.\n\nThe current code's ans is initialized to arr[n], which is the total 1s. Then, in the loop over i, the condition is i + arr[n] <= n. The loop variable is i, and for each i, they compute arr[n] - (arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i]). Let me see what that represents.\n\nWait, the term (arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i]) is the number of 1s in the substring from i to i + arr[n] - 1. Because arr[i + arr[n]] is the sum up to that index. So the number of 1s in that substring is that value. Then, arr[n] minus that is the number of 1s removed. Because the total 1s in the original string is arr[n], so subtracting the ones in the substring gives the 1s removed. \n\nBut the other part of the cost is the number of 0s left. Let's see:\n\nThe substring from i to (i + arr[n] -1) has length arr[n]. The number of 0s in that substring is (length) - (number of 1s in it) = arr[n] - (arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i]). \n\nSo the cost for this substring would be the maximum between (number of 0s left) and (number of 1s removed). Wait, but the code is taking the maximum of those two, but in the code's current setup, they are taking the minimum of ans and (arr[n] - (arr[i + arr[n]] - arr[i])). Wait, that's just the number of 1s removed. But the cost is the maximum between the two values. So this approach might be incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the code's logic. Maybe there's a different way to model the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to find a substring where the number of 1s in the substring is as large as possible, so that the number of 1s removed is minimized, but also the number of 0s left is minimized. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is when the number of 0s left and the number of 1s removed are as close as possible. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nThe cost is the maximum between (number of 0s left) and (number of 1s removed). To minimize this maximum, we need to find a balance between these two.\n\nSuppose the total number of 1s is T. Let's say we choose a substring [start, end], which has L 1s and M 0s. The number of 1s removed is T - L. The number of 0s left is M. The cost is max(M, T - L). We need to choose start and end such that this is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of 0s in the substring is (end - start + 1) - L, where L is the number of 1s in the substring. So the cost is max( (end - start +1 - L), (T - L) )\n\nWe need to find the minimum possible value of this maximum over all possible substrings.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal maximum occurs when (end - start +1 - L) = (T - L). Let me see:\n\nSuppose (end - start +1 - L) = (T - L). Then, end - start +1 = T. So the length of the substring is exactly T. Then, the cost would be T - L. But since L is the number of 1s in the substring, which can't exceed T (since T is the total 1s in the entire string). So the maximum would be T - L, but if the substring's length is T, then the number of 0s is (T - L). So the maximum is exactly T-L. \n\nAlternatively, if the substring's length is longer than T, then the number of 0s would be (length - L) which could be larger than T-L, so the maximum would be that. So perhaps the optimal substring is of length exactly T, so that the two terms are equal, and thus the maximum is minimized.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the substring has exactly T 1s. Then the number of 0s in it is (length - T). The number of 1s removed is T - L, but L is T, so that term is zero. Wait, no, if the substring has exactly T 1s, then the number of 1s removed is T - L = T - T = 0. So the cost would be the number of 0s in the substring, which is (length - T). But the length of the substring must be at least T (since it has T 1s). So the minimal possible 0s would be when the substring is exactly T in length, so the 0s would be (length - T) = 0. Wait, but that's only possible if the substring is exactly T 1s with no 0s. But that's only possible if the entire string has exactly T 1s and no 0s, which is a special case.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach is not correct. Let me think of the example given in the problem.\n\nFirst example: the input is \"1010\". The sample output is 1. Let's see:\n\nThe optimal is to remove two from the beginning and one from the end. The remaining string is \"01\", which has one 0. The number of 1s removed is the original total 1s (2) minus the 1 in the substring (1), so 1. The maximum between 1 and 1 is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nIn this case, the substring length is 2, which is equal to the total 1s (2). So the 0s left are 1, and the 1s removed are 1. So the maximum is 1. So that's exactly the case where the substring length is T (the total 1s). So perhaps the optimal solution is to choose a substring of length exactly T, and find the one with the maximum number of 1s in it. Because then the number of 0s would be (T - L), and the 1s removed would be (T - L). So the maximum is T-L, which is minimized when L is as large as possible.\n\nWait, so if the substring has length T, then the number of 0s is (T - L), and the 1s removed is (T - L). So the maximum is exactly T-L. To minimize this, we need to maximize L, the number of 1s in the substring of length T. So the minimal possible maximum is (T - L_max), where L_max is the maximum number of 1s in any substring of length T.\n\nAh! So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of 1s in any substring of length exactly T (where T is the total number of 1s in the original string). Then the minimal cost would be T - L_max. \n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then the entire string is 0s. Then the cost would be the number of 0s left (since the 1s removed is zero, so the maximum is the number of 0s left). To minimize that, we can remove all the 0s, so the cost is zero. But if T is zero, then the code's approach would have some issues. Let me think about that case later.\n\nSo, assuming T is the total number of 1s, then the minimal cost is the minimal between the initial ans (which is T, the number of 1s removed if we take an empty substring, so the cost would be max(0, T) = T) and the minimal possible (T - L_max) where L_max is the maximum 1s in a substring of length T.\n\nWait, but how does the code in the problem handle this?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code initializes ans as arr[n], which is T. Then, it loops over i from 0 to ... the condition is i + arr[n] <= n. So the substring length is exactly T (since i + T is the end index, so the length is (i + T) - i = T). So for each possible starting index i where the substring of length T can be taken (i.e., i + T <= n), the code computes (arr[n] - (arr[i + T] - arr[i])). \n\nWait, arr[i + T] - arr[i] is the number of 1s in the substring starting at i and of length T. So T minus that is the number of 1s removed (since total 1s is T, so subtract the ones in the substring). But the cost is the maximum between (number of 0s in the substring) and (number of 1s removed). \n\nThe number of 0s in the substring is (T - (number of 1s in substring)), since the substring has length T. So the cost is max( (T - (L)), (T - L) ), which is exactly (T - L). So the code is taking the minimum between the initial ans (T) and (T - L) for all possible substrings of length T. \n\nAh, so the code is correct in that scenario. Because the minimal possible cost when choosing a substring of length T is (T - L_max), and the code is finding the minimal between that and the initial T (which is when you choose an empty substring, so the cost is T). \n\nWait, but what if there's a better option where the substring is longer than T? Let me see. Suppose the substring is longer than T. Then the number of 1s in it can't exceed T (since total is T). So the number of 1s removed would be T - L, which is same as before. But the number of 0s would be (length - L). Since length is longer than T, (length - L) would be larger than (T - L). So the cost would be (length - L), which is worse than (T - L). So choosing a longer substring is worse. \n\nIf the substring is shorter than T, then the length is less than T. Then the number of 1s in it can be at most the length. So the number of 1s removed would be T - L. The number of 0s is (length - L). The maximum between those two. Let's see: if the substring is shorter than T, then (length - L) could be smaller than (T - L), but the 1s removed (T-L) would be larger. So the maximum would be T-L again. So the minimal maximum is still (T-L). \n\nWait, but if the substring is shorter than T, then the number of 1s in it can be up to the length. So for example, if the substring is of length L (less than T), then the number of 1s can be up to L. So T-L would be (T - L) which is bigger than (length - L) (since length is less than T). So the maximum would be T-L. So choosing a substring of length less than T doesn't help. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible cost is indeed the minimal between T (the case when you take nothing) and (T - L_max), where L_max is the maximum number of 1s in any substring of length T. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct. \n\nNow, the missing part in the code is the for loop that initializes the prefix array. The loop is supposed to iterate over each character in the string and compute the prefix sum. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n    arr[i + 1] = arr[i] + s.charAt(i) - '0';\n}\n\nSo the loop needs to run from i=0 to i = n-1. The loop variable is i, so the for loop should be for (int i = 0; i < n; i++). \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) \n\nThat's the loop to fill the prefix array. \n\nWait, but let me check the existing code. The arr is initialized as new int[200005], which is okay. The loop for the prefix sum starts at i=0, and for each i, arr[i+1] is set. So the loop must run from 0 to n-1, inclusive. \n\nYes, so the for loop should be for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) \n\nSo that's the missing code. \n\nNow, let me check the rest of the code. The code then loops over i from 0 to where i + T <= n. Because the substring of length T must fit in the string. So the loop is for (int i = 0; i + arr[n] <= n; i++). \n\nWait, arr[n] is T. So the condition is i + T <= n. So the maximum i can be is n-T. \n\nSo the loop is correct. \n\nTherefore, the only missing part is the for loop's initialization. \n\nSo the answer is to fill in the for loop with the correct loop variables. \n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) \n\nThat's the missing line."
