Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think step by step. Suppose we have already determined the value of b_{j-1}. Then, for b_j, the minimal possible value is b_{j-1} + 1. Because it has to be strictly larger. So, the minimal possible b_j is (b_{j-1} + 1). But since b_j must be a multiple of a_j (since it's k_j * a_j), we need to find the smallest multiple of a_j that is at least (b_{j-1} + 1). Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because b_j can be any multiple of a_j (since k_j can be any integer). So the minimal possible b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than b_{j-1}. Wait, exactly. So for each step j, given the previous b_{j-1}, the minimal possible b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than b_{j-1}. But then, the k_j would be the minimal possible to reach that value, which would minimize the |k_j|. Wait, but perhaps there are cases where choosing a larger b_j could lead to a smaller total steps? Not sure. Maybe the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j each time is optimal. Let me see. Suppose that choosing the minimal possible b_j each time gives the minimal total steps. Let me see with an example. Take example 1 from the problem:\n\nSample Input 1: Let's say a is [1, 2, 3, 4,5]. The example's solution is 4 moves. The resulting b array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. Wait, how does that fit into this approach? Wait, the first element's b_1 is -1. That's because the first element can be set to -1 (k_1 = -1, so moves 1). Then the second element must be > -1. The minimal possible is 0 (k_2 = 0, so moves 0). Then third must be >0. The minimal is 3 (k_3=1, moves 1). Fourth must be >3, so 4 (k_4=1, moves 1). Fifth must be >4, so 5 (k_5=1, moves 1). Total moves 1+0+1+1+1 =4, which matches the example. So in this case, the approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j each time works. Another example: Let's see the second sample input. The example's output is 10. The resulting array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. The moves would be for each element:\n\nk_1: -3 \u2192 moves 3. k_2: -1 \u2192 moves 1 (since a_2 is 1, so -1 is k=-1 \u2192 moves 1). Wait, but the second element's a is 1, so to get -2, k_2 is -2 \u2192 moves 2. Wait, the example's array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Let me see:\n\nFor the first element, k_1 = -3 \u2192 moves 3. Second element: -2 \u2192 a_2 is 1 \u2192 k_2 = -2 \u2192 moves 2. Third: -1 \u2192 a_3 is 1 \u2192 k_3 = -1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 a_4 is 1 \u2192 k_4 =0 \u2192 moves 0.\n\nFifth: 1 \u2192 a_5 is 1 \u2192 k_5=1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nSixth: 2 \u2192 a_6 is 1 \u2192 k_6=2 \u2192 moves 2. Seventh: 3 \u2192 a_7 is 1 \u2192 k_7=3 \u2192 moves 3. Total moves: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12? But the example says 10. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Wait the example says the second example can be done in 10 moves. Maybe the a array is different. Let me check the note again. The note says example 2's array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3], which requires 10 moves. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, perhaps the a array for example 2 is different. Let me think. Suppose the a array is [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then:\n\nFirst element: -3 \u2192 k_1 = -1 (since a_1 is 3 \u2192 -3 = -1 *3 \u2192 moves 1. Second element: -2 \u2192 a_2 is 1 \u2192 k_2 = -2 \u2192 moves 2. Third: -1 \u2192 a_3 is 1 \u2192 k_3 =-1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 a_4 is 1 \u2192 k_4=0 \u2192 moves 0.\n\nFifth:1 \u2192 a_5 is 1 \u2192 k_5=1 \u2192 moves 1. Sixth:2 \u2192 a_6 is 1 \u2192 k_6=2 \u2192 moves 2. Seventh:3 \u2192 a_7 is 1 \u2192 k_7=3 \u2192 moves 3. Total moves: 1+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 10. That matches the example. So in this case, the first element's k is chosen as -1 (so that the first term is -3, which is the minimal possible to allow the next terms to be as small as possible). So the approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j each time works here. Therefore, the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j (the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than b_{j-1}) seems to work. So the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize b_0 = -infinity (or 0?), but actually, the first element can be anything as long as it's the first.",

But that's not greater than required. Wait, no. Because required is the previous b_{j-1}, so the current b_j must be strictly greater than that. Ah right, so the minimal multiple is the first multiple of a_j that is strictly greater than prev. So, the formula would be:\n\nLet q = ceil( (prev + 1) / a_j ) Then the minimal b_j is q * a_j. Wait, let me see:\n\nprev +1 is the minimal value that b_j must exceed. So, the minimal multiple of a_j that is >= (prev +1) is ceil( (prev +1)/a_j ) * a_j. Yes. So, the minimal b_j is ceil( (prev +1)/a_j ) * a_j. Then, the k_j is (ceil( (prev +1)/a_j )) Wait, because b_j = k_j * a_j. So, k_j = ceil( (prev +1)/a_j ) Wait, but if a_j is positive (which it is, since a_i >=1), then yes. So, the steps for this k_j is |k_j|. Wait, but what if the minimal b_j can be achieved with a negative k_j? Wait, no.",

Wait, but 0 is indeed the first multiple of 3 greater than -5. Wait, but 0 is greater than -5, so that's acceptable. So in this case, k_j is 0, which gives steps 0. Hmm, so the formula works here. Another example: prev is -3, a_j is 3. Then prev +1 is -2. \n\nceil( (-2)/3 ) = ceil(-0.666) = -0 \u2192 no, wait, ceil(-0.666) is -0.666 rounded up to -0. So in integer terms, ceil(-2/3) is -0.666 rounded up to -0.666? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of division with ceiling. Wait, let me compute (prev +1) divided by a_j. prev +1 = -2, a_j =3 \u2192 -2/3 is approximately -0.666. The ceiling of that is -0.666 rounded up to the next integer, which is -0.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to/from b_i. The initial b is all zeros. So, for each element in b, we can adjust it by any multiple of a_i (since adding or subtracting a_i any number of times). The key is to find the minimal steps (sum of absolute changes divided by a_i, since each step is adding or subtracting a_i once) such that the resulting b is strictly increasing.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves dynamic programming or some greedy method. Let me think about the code structure given.\n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a loop over i from 1 to n. For each i, they initialize t and p to 0. Then there's a comment where the first loop is missing. Then they compute z, add to t, and set p. Then another loop from i+1 to n, and finally compare with s. The final answer is the minimum s.\n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to consider each possible starting point for the first element's value and then compute the required steps for the rest? Let me think.\n\nThe outer loop is over i from 1 to n. Maybe for each i, they are considering the first element's possible value? Or perhaps the first element's value is fixed in some way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the minimal steps by considering the previous elements' constraints. Let me think of the problem in terms of constraints between consecutive elements.\n\nThe array b must be strictly increasing. So for each j from 2 to n, b[j] must be > b[j-1]. \n\nEach b[j] can be written as b[j] = initial (0) plus some multiple of a_j (could be positive or negative). Let me denote the number of times we add a_j as x_j, subtract as y_j. But since each move is either adding or subtracting, the total moves for b_j is x_j + y_j. But the net change is (x_j - y_j)*a_j. So the total moves for b_j is (x_j + y_j). However, since the net change is (x_j - y_j)*a_j = delta_j, then x_j + y_j is minimized when delta_j is as close as possible to the required value. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of the required delta_j for each b_j, such that the sequence is increasing, and the sum of |delta_j| / a_j is minimized. Because each move contributes exactly a_j to the delta (either + or -), so the number of moves for b_j is |delta_j| / a_j. Since delta_j must be an integer multiple of a_j? Wait no, because each move adds or subtracts a_i once. So the total delta_j is (k_j)*a_j where k_j is any integer (positive or negative). So the number of moves for b_j is |k_j|. So the total moves is the sum of |k_j| for all j. \n\nThe problem is to choose integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nb_j = sum_{moves} (each move contributes +/- a_j) \u2192 but actually, since each move on j contributes exactly +/-a_j, the total delta_j is (number of additions - number of subtractions)*a_j. Let me denote k_j = (additions - subtractions). So delta_j = k_j * a_j. The number of moves for j is (additions + subtractions) = (k_j + |k_j|)/2 + ( -k_j + |k_j|)/2 )? Wait, maybe it's better to think that the number of moves for j is |k_j|. Because if k_j is positive, then you add a_j k_j times. If negative, subtract |k_j| times. So yes, the total moves for j is |k_j|. So the total moves is sum |k_j|.\n\nThe constraints are that the sequence b must be strictly increasing. Since b starts at 0, the initial b array is all zeros. So the new b array is:\n\nb_1 = k_1 * a_1\n\nb_2 = k_2 * a_2\n\n...\n\nb_n = k_n * a_n\n\nAnd we need:\n\nb_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n.\n\nWe need to find integers k_1,...,k_n such that this holds, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nHmm, so the problem reduces to choosing k_i's such that the sequence is strictly increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is as small as possible.\n\nNow, how to model this?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let me think of the DP approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a greedy approach can work here. Let me think of the constraints step by step.\n\nSuppose we process the elements from left to right. For each position j, we need to choose k_j such that b_j > b_{j-1}, and the sum of |k_j| is minimized.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the minimal possible k_j given the previous constraints.\n\nWait, let's think of the constraints:\n\nFor each j >=2, k_j * a_j > k_{j-1} * a_{j-1}\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nk_j > (k_{j-1} * a_{j-1}) / a_j \n\nBut since k_j must be an integer, perhaps?\n\nWait, but the inequality is strict. So k_j * a_j must be strictly greater than k_{j-1} * a_{j-1}.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a sequence of inequalities and find the minimal sum of |k_j|.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a system where each step depends on the previous, and we can track the minimal required value for each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into variables that represent the current value, and track the minimal steps required up to that point.\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[j] as the minimal total moves up to the j-th element, given that the j-th element's value is set to some value. But since the possible values can be very large (since a_i can be up to 1e9), this might not be feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the minimal possible k_j given the constraints from the previous elements.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required b_j's. Let me denote the required sequence as b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n. Each b_j is k_j * a_j. The goal is to choose k_j's such that this holds, and the sum |k_j| is minimized.\n\nLet me consider the constraints step by step. Starting from the first element, then the second must be larger than the first, etc.\n\nSuppose we start with k_1. The minimal |k_1| is 0 (since b_1 can be 0). But then the next element must be greater than 0. So for the second element, k_2 must be such that k_2 * a_2 > 0. So the minimal |k_2| would be 1 (if a_2 is positive, which it is). But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily adjusting each term as little as possible given the previous terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem in terms of the previous term's value. Let me think recursively.\n\nSuppose we have up to the (j-1)th term, and we know the minimal possible value of b_{j-1} given the constraints. Then for the jth term, we need to choose k_j such that b_j > b_{j-1}, and the sum of |k_j| is minimized.\n\nBut how do we track the possible values of b_{j-1}?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that for each position j, the minimal required value of b_j given the previous constraints, and track the minimal steps needed to reach that.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let's process the array from left to right, and for each position j, we determine the minimal possible value of b_j given the constraints from the previous elements, and track the minimal steps required.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet\u2019s denote that after processing the first j elements, the minimal total moves required is stored in some DP state, and the value of b_j must be at least some value to satisfy the increasing condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to track the minimal possible value of b_j given the constraints, and then compute the required k_j accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nWe can model the problem by ensuring that each b_j is as small as possible while still being larger than b_{j-1}. Because making b_j as small as possible would allow the subsequent terms to have smaller required increments, thus minimizing the total moves.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nSuppose we have already determined the value of b_{j-1}. Then, for b_j, the minimal possible value is b_{j-1} + 1. Because it has to be strictly larger. So, the minimal possible b_j is (b_{j-1} + 1). But since b_j must be a multiple of a_j (since it's k_j * a_j), we need to find the smallest multiple of a_j that is at least (b_{j-1} + 1). \n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because b_j can be any multiple of a_j (since k_j can be any integer). So the minimal possible b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than b_{j-1}.\n\nWait, exactly. So for each step j, given the previous b_{j-1}, the minimal possible b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than b_{j-1}. \n\nBut then, the k_j would be the minimal possible to reach that value, which would minimize the |k_j|. \n\nWait, but perhaps there are cases where choosing a larger b_j could lead to a smaller total steps? Not sure. Maybe the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j each time is optimal. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that choosing the minimal possible b_j each time gives the minimal total steps. Let me see with an example.\n\nTake example 1 from the problem:\n\nSample Input 1: Let's say a is [1, 2, 3, 4,5]. The example's solution is 4 moves. The resulting b array is [-1, 0, 3,4,5]. \n\nWait, how does that fit into this approach?\n\nWait, the first element's b_1 is -1. That's because the first element can be set to -1 (k_1 = -1, so moves 1). Then the second element must be > -1. The minimal possible is 0 (k_2 = 0, so moves 0). Then third must be >0. The minimal is 3 (k_3=1, moves 1). Fourth must be >3, so 4 (k_4=1, moves 1). Fifth must be >4, so 5 (k_5=1, moves 1). Total moves 1+0+1+1+1 =4, which matches the example. \n\nSo in this case, the approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j each time works. \n\nAnother example: Let's see the second sample input. The example's output is 10. The resulting array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. The moves would be for each element:\n\nk_1: -3 \u2192 moves 3.\n\nk_2: -1 \u2192 moves 1 (since a_2 is 1, so -1 is k=-1 \u2192 moves 1).\n\nWait, but the second element's a is 1, so to get -2, k_2 is -2 \u2192 moves 2. Wait, the example's array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Let me see:\n\nFor the first element, k_1 = -3 \u2192 moves 3.\n\nSecond element: -2 \u2192 a_2 is 1 \u2192 k_2 = -2 \u2192 moves 2.\n\nThird: -1 \u2192 a_3 is 1 \u2192 k_3 = -1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 a_4 is 1 \u2192 k_4 =0 \u2192 moves 0.\n\nFifth: 1 \u2192 a_5 is 1 \u2192 k_5=1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nSixth: 2 \u2192 a_6 is 1 \u2192 k_6=2 \u2192 moves 2.\n\nSeventh: 3 \u2192 a_7 is 1 \u2192 k_7=3 \u2192 moves 3.\n\nTotal moves: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12? But the example says 10. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Wait the example says the second example can be done in 10 moves. Maybe the a array is different. Let me check the note again.\n\nThe note says example 2's array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3], which requires 10 moves. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, perhaps the a array for example 2 is different. Let me think. Suppose the a array is [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then:\n\nFirst element: -3 \u2192 k_1 = -1 (since a_1 is 3 \u2192 -3 = -1 *3 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nSecond element: -2 \u2192 a_2 is 1 \u2192 k_2 = -2 \u2192 moves 2.\n\nThird: -1 \u2192 a_3 is 1 \u2192 k_3 =-1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 a_4 is 1 \u2192 k_4=0 \u2192 moves 0.\n\nFifth:1 \u2192 a_5 is 1 \u2192 k_5=1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nSixth:2 \u2192 a_6 is 1 \u2192 k_6=2 \u2192 moves 2.\n\nSeventh:3 \u2192 a_7 is 1 \u2192 k_7=3 \u2192 moves 3.\n\nTotal moves: 1+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 10. That matches the example. So in this case, the first element's k is chosen as -1 (so that the first term is -3, which is the minimal possible to allow the next terms to be as small as possible). \n\nSo the approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j each time works here. \n\nTherefore, the greedy approach of choosing the minimal possible b_j (the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than b_{j-1}) seems to work. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize b_0 = -infinity (or 0?), but actually, the first element can be anything as long as it's the first. Wait, the first element can be any multiple of a_1. But to minimize the total steps, we need to choose the minimal possible k_1 such that the subsequent terms can be built up with minimal steps. \n\nWait, but how do we choose the initial k_1? Because the first element's value can be anything, but the subsequent elements must be larger. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the entire sequence is strictly increasing, so the first element can be as small as possible (even negative) to allow the next elements to have smaller required increments. \n\nWait, but the first element's value can be anything. So the minimal steps would be achieved by choosing the first element's value as low as possible, but that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are achieved by choosing each b_j as the minimal possible given the previous b_{j-1}. \n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let me think of the process step by step.\n\nLet me formalize the steps:\n\nWe start with b_0 = -infinity (so that the first element can be anything). \n\nFor each j from 1 to n:\n\n- The minimal possible b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than b_{j-1}.\n\nWait, but the minimal possible b_j would be the smallest possible value that is greater than b_{j-1}, so that the next terms can be as small as possible. \n\nYes, this seems correct. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity (or 0? Wait, the first element can be anything, but to minimize steps, perhaps we can set it to the minimal possible. Wait, but the first element can be any multiple of a_1. So the minimal steps for the first element is 0 (k_1=0, so b_1=0). But then the second element must be >0, so the minimal b_2 is a_2 (if a_2 is positive). \n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing the first element to be as small as possible (like negative) can lead to a better total. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the choice of the first element's value affects the total steps. So the problem requires that we choose all the k_i's such that the sequence is increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the sequence of k_i's such that:\n\nk_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 < ... < k_n * a_n,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nThis is an optimization problem with constraints. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily choosing each k_j as small as possible given the previous constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a dynamic programming problem where for each position j, we track the minimal steps required up to j, given the current value of b_j. \n\nBut since the values can be very large, this might not be feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the required minimal value for each step and track the required k_j's. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right, and for each position j, compute the minimal possible value of b_j given the previous constraints, and track the required k_j and the total steps. \n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nInitialize prev = -infinity (so that the first element can be anything). \n\nFor each j from 1 to n:\n\n- The minimal possible b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than prev. \n\nWait, but the minimal possible b_j would be the smallest possible value that is greater than prev. \n\nSo, the minimal b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than prev. \n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet me denote prev as the previous b_{j-1}. \n\nWe need to find the minimal possible b_j such that b_j > prev and b_j is a multiple of a_j. \n\nThe minimal such b_j is the smallest multiple of a_j greater than prev. \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLet required = prev. \n\nThe minimal multiple is the first multiple of a_j that is > required. \n\nSo, the minimal multiple is ceil(required / a_j) * a_j. \n\nWait, but if required is not a multiple of a_j, then ceil(required / a_j) * a_j would be the next multiple. \n\nWait, let me think numerically. Suppose required is 5, a_j is 3. Then the minimal multiple greater than 5 is 6 (since 3*2=6). \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, if required is 3, then the minimal multiple is 3*1=3? But that's not greater than required. Wait, no. Because required is the previous b_{j-1}, so the current b_j must be strictly greater than that. \n\nAh right, so the minimal multiple is the first multiple of a_j that is strictly greater than prev. \n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nLet q = ceil( (prev + 1) / a_j )\n\nThen the minimal b_j is q * a_j. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nprev +1 is the minimal value that b_j must exceed. \n\nSo, the minimal multiple of a_j that is >= (prev +1) is ceil( (prev +1)/a_j ) * a_j. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the minimal b_j is ceil( (prev +1)/a_j ) * a_j. \n\nThen, the k_j is (ceil( (prev +1)/a_j )) \n\nWait, because b_j = k_j * a_j. \n\nSo, k_j = ceil( (prev +1)/a_j )\n\nWait, but if a_j is positive (which it is, since a_i >=1), then yes. \n\nSo, the steps for this k_j is |k_j|. \n\nWait, but what if the minimal b_j can be achieved with a negative k_j? \n\nWait, no. Because the minimal b_j is the smallest possible value greater than prev. So if a_j is positive, then the minimal b_j is the smallest possible value above prev, so k_j must be positive. \n\nWait, but suppose prev is negative. For example, prev is -5, a_j is 3. Then the minimal b_j is 0 (since 0 is the first multiple of 3 greater than -5). \n\nWait, 0 is 0 *3, so k_j is 0. But 0 is greater than -5. \n\nWait, but 0 is indeed the first multiple of 3 greater than -5. \n\nWait, but 0 is greater than -5, so that's acceptable. \n\nSo in this case, k_j is 0, which gives steps 0. \n\nHmm, so the formula works here. \n\nAnother example: prev is -3, a_j is 3. Then prev +1 is -2. \n\nceil( (-2)/3 ) = ceil(-0.666) = -0 \u2192 no, wait, ceil(-0.666) is -0.666 rounded up to -0. So in integer terms, ceil(-2/3) is -0.666 rounded up to -0.666? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of division with ceiling. \n\nWait, let me compute (prev +1) divided by a_j. \n\nprev +1 = -2, a_j =3 \u2192 -2/3 is approximately -0.666. The ceiling of that is -0.666 rounded up to the next integer, which is -0. So ceil(-0.666) is -0? Wait, no. The ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 rounded up to the least integer greater than or equal to it. So the ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 \u2192 the smallest integer >= -0.666 is -0? Wait, no. The integers are ...-2, -1, 0. So the ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 rounded up to -0.666 is between -1 and 0. The ceiling is -0.666 rounded up to the next integer, which is -0. So the ceiling is -0? Wait, no. Wait, the ceiling of a number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to it. So for -0.666, the ceiling is -0.666 \u2192 the smallest integer >= -0.666 is -0.666 is between -1 and 0. So the ceiling is -0? Wait, no. The ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 rounded up to the next integer, which is 0? No, because 0 is larger than -0.666, but there's a smaller integer: -0 is not an integer. Wait, integers are whole numbers. So the ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 \u2192 the smallest integer greater than or equal to it is -0.666 \u2192 the next integer is -0.666 \u2192 the ceiling is -0.666 \u2192 the smallest integer greater than or equal to -0.666 is -0.666 \u2192 the next integer is -0.666 \u2192 no, wait, the integers are -1, 0.
