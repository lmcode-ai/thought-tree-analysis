Each string is two characters long. The code provided is almost complete, but there's a loop that's not filled in. Let's see where the TODO is. Oh right, in the for loop for reading the strings. The loop is supposed to fill the str array with the n strings. The loop starts with \"for(/* TODO: Your code here */)\" so I need to write the correct for loop here. The variable i is probably used here. The standard way would be for(int i=0; i<n; i++), right? Because that's how you loop n times and fill the array. So that's the first part. Now, looking at the rest of the code. The approach seems to use some maps. Let me think about the logic here. The variables start and end are HashMaps. Start probably tracks the first character of the strings, and end the second. The variable v counts the frequency of each exact string.",
