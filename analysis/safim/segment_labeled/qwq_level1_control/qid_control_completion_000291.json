Let me think about how the line sweep works here. The events are probably for the start and end of the rain's effect. For each rain day i, the rain contributes to positions from x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i. The contribution at position j is p_i - |x_i - j|.

The variables 'prefix' and 'sum' are being tracked. The 'prefix' might represent the current number of overlapping rain contributions at a certain point. Wait, maybe the 'prefix' is the current slope of the a_j function? Hmm, perhaps the approach is inspired by the fact that the a_j function is a piecewise linear function. Each rain contributes a V-shaped function centered at x_i with a peak of p_i. The total a_j is the sum of all these V-shapes. The maximum of this sum is the maximum a_j. The line sweep method would track the maximum value of a_j as we move along the positions. To compute this maximum efficiently, we can model the events where the slope of the a_j function changes.",

Let me think of an example. Suppose there are two points at x=1 and x=3, with p=1 each. The sum p_i is 2. The minimal sum of |x_i - j| is achieved at j=2, which gives 1+1=2.

Wait, that's because the p_i's are small. So in this case, the maximum a_j is 0. Hmm, so my previous reasoning was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions of the sum of (p_i - |x_i - j|). The maximum occurs where the sum of p_i minus the sum of |x_i - j| is maximized. This can be rewritten as (sum p_i) - (sum |x_i - j|). To maximize this, we need to minimize the sum of |x_i - j|.",

The code's current loop has:\n\nsum += prefix * (p[0] - lst);\n\nprefix += p[1];\n\nlst = p[0];\n\n// TODO: Your code here \n\nif (/* condition */) continue;\n\nBut the correct code should have:\n\nmaxA = Math.max(maxA, sum);\n\nand the condition is not needed. Thus, the missing code is to add the line to track the maximum. The code's current variables lk and rk are probably not needed. The final loop should be replaced with checking p_i >= (maxA - m). Thus, the complete code would involve:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nlong maxA = 0;\n\nlong sum = 0;\n\nlong prefix = 0;\n\nlong lst = -1;\n\nfor (long[] p : list) {\n\n    sum += prefix * (p[0] - lst);\n\n    prefix += p[1];\n\n    lst = p[0];\n\n    maxA = Math.max(maxA, sum);\n\n} Then, for each rain:\n\nif (maxA - rain[1] <= m) \u2192 append '1' else '0'. Thus, the missing code in the TODO is to add the line to track maxA. \n\nThe current code's loop has a TODO condition. The correct code would remove the condition and add the maxA line. The current code's variables lk and rk are not needed.",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the given Java code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each day whether removing that day's rain will prevent a flood. The flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds m. The key is to find for each i, if after setting p_i to 0, the maximum a_j across all positions j is \u2264 m.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves calculating the maximum a_j when each day's rain is excluded. But doing this naively for each day would be too slow, especially since n can be up to 2e5. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLooking at the code provided, it seems like the current approach is using some line sweep or event-based method. Let me see what's in the code so far.\n\nThe code starts by reading the test cases and for each test case, reads the rains into a list. Then, for each rain (x_i, p_i), it adds three events: at x_i - p_i (start of the rain's effect?), x_i (maybe the peak?), and x_i + p_i (end?). These events are stored in a list and sorted. \n\nWait, the events are added as {x_i - p_i, 1}, {x_i, -2}, and {x_i + p_i, 1}. The sorting is based on the first element of the array. The list is sorted by position. \n\nThen, there's a loop over the sorted list. The variables sum and prefix are being tracked. The sum is accumulating something based on the difference between the current position and the last. The prefix is being updated by adding the second element of the event (1 or -2). \n\nThe comments mention that the code needs to check if the current position's sum exceeds m. But the code has a TODO where the condition is missing. \n\nWait, the code's logic here might be trying to track the maximum a_j over all positions. Let me think: the a_j for each position j is the sum of max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|) for all days except possibly the one we're considering. But since we can only remove one day, perhaps the approach is to compute the maximum a_j when all days are considered, then see for each day i, whether removing it would reduce that maximum below m+1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j when all days are considered, and then for each day i, check if that day's contribution was the one causing the maximum to exceed m. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the problem requires that after removing day i's rain (setting p_i to 0), the maximum a_j must be \u2264 m. So for each day i, we need to know whether the maximum a_j (without considering day i's rain) is \u2264 m.\n\nThe current code's approach seems to be using a line sweep to track the maximum a_j. Let me think about how the line sweep works here.\n\nThe events are probably for the start and end of the rain's effect. For each rain day i, the rain contributes to positions from x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i. The contribution at position j is p_i - |x_i - j|. The maximum contribution for a position j is the sum of all such terms from all days except possibly one.\n\nWait, but how does the line sweep track the maximum a_j?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j over all positions. Let me see the variables:\n\nThe list is sorted by position. The variables 'prefix' and 'sum' are being tracked. The 'prefix' might represent the current number of overlapping rain contributions at a certain point. Wait, maybe the 'prefix' is the current slope of the a_j function?\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is inspired by the fact that the a_j function is a piecewise linear function. Each rain contributes a V-shaped function centered at x_i with a peak of p_i. The total a_j is the sum of all these V-shapes. The maximum of this sum is the maximum a_j. \n\nThe line sweep method would track the maximum value of a_j as we move along the positions. To compute this maximum efficiently, we can model the events where the slope of the a_j function changes. \n\nEach rain's contribution starts at x_i - p_i (slope increases by 1?), peaks at x_i (slope changes?), and ends at x_i + p_i (slope decreases by 1?). \n\nWait, the events added are:\n\n- At x_i - p_i: add 1 to the slope (since the rain starts contributing here, so the slope increases by 1? Or maybe the slope is the derivative of a_j, so the start of the rain's contribution would add a slope change of +1, and the end would subtract 1?)\n\nWait, the a_j function for a single rain is a V-shape. The slope to the left of x_i is +1 (since as you move right, the value increases by 1 per unit until the peak), and to the right, it's -1. So the total slope changes would be:\n\nAt x_i - p_i: the slope increases by +1 (since the rain starts contributing here, so the slope before that is 0, and after, it's +1? Not sure. Maybe the slope changes are tracked as events. \n\nAlternatively, the slope of a_j is the sum of the slopes from each rain. Each rain contributes a slope change of +1 at x_i - p_i, then a slope change of -2 at x_i (since the slope goes from +1 to -1, so a total change of -2), and then another +1 at x_i + p_i. \n\nAh, that makes sense. So for each rain, the three events are:\n\n- At x_i - p_i: slope increases by +1 (start of the V's left side)\n- At x_i: slope decreases by 2 (the peak, so slope goes from +1 to -1, so total change is -2)\n- At x_i + p_i: slope increases by +1 (end of the V's right side, slope goes from -1 to 0, so +1)\n\nTherefore, the 'prefix' variable in the code is tracking the current slope of the a_j function. \n\nThe 'sum' variable might be tracking the integral of the slope up to the current position, which would give the current a_j value. Wait, perhaps the 'sum' is the total area under the slope up to the current position, which would be the a_j value at that point?\n\nWait, let me think again. The slope is the derivative of a_j. So the a_j at position x is the integral of the slope from the starting point up to x. \n\nThe code's loop is processing the events in order. The 'prefix' is the current slope. The 'sum' is being accumulated as the integral of the slope between the previous position (lst) and the current position (p[0]). \n\nWait, the code does:\n\nsum += prefix * (p[0] - lst);\n\nWait, that's the area under the slope (prefix) over the interval from lst to p[0]. Since the slope is the derivative, integrating over that interval gives the change in a_j. So the 'sum' variable here is the current a_j value at position p[0]. \n\nWait, but how does this track the maximum a_j? Because the maximum a_j could be at any point between events. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum a_j is the maximum value of the integral (sum) over all intervals. But the code is trying to track the maximum a_j. \n\nWait, in the code's loop, after updating sum and prefix, there's a condition with a TODO. The current code is trying to compute some variables lk and rk, which are being updated as the maximum between their current value and some expressions involving sum and p[0]. \n\nLooking at the code's lines:\n\nlk = Math.max(lk, sum - m - p[0]);\n\nrk = Math.max(rk, sum - m + p[0]);\n\nHmm, not sure what lk and rk represent here. Maybe they are some bounds that help determine the required conditions for each day's exclusion?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j over all positions. Let me think: the maximum a_j can be found by tracking the maximum value of the integral (sum) as we process each event. But the code isn't doing that here. \n\nWait, the code's current approach might be incorrect, but I need to see what the existing code is trying to do. \n\nThe problem requires for each day i, whether removing it would prevent the flood. So the idea is to compute for each day i, the maximum a_j when that day's rain is excluded. \n\nThe current code's approach might be trying to precompute some information so that for each day, we can quickly determine if removing it would reduce the maximum below m+1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j when all days are considered, and then for each day i, check if that day's contribution was the one causing the maximum to exceed m. \n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think again. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions of the sum of all the rain contributions except possibly one. \n\nThe code's current approach might be trying to compute the maximum a_j when all days are considered. Then, for each day i, we need to see if removing it would reduce the maximum to \u2264 m. \n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to find the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, check whether that day's contribution was part of the maximum. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum a_j is the sum of all the p_i's at their peaks. Because each rain's peak is at x_i, and the contribution there is p_i. So the total a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i's from all rains except those whose peaks are not at x_i. Wait, no, the a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i minus |x_i - x_i| (which is zero) for each rain. So the a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i's. \n\nWait, that's a key point. The maximum a_j is the sum of all p_i's, but only if all their peaks are at the same position. Otherwise, the maximum could be the sum of some subset. \n\nWait, actually, the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions of the sum of p_i - |x_i - j|. The maximum occurs at some position j where the sum of p_i's peaks (i.e., where j is as close as possible to as many x_i as possible). \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the line sweep approach again. \n\nThe line sweep tracks the slope and the current a_j. The maximum a_j can be found by tracking the maximum value of the integral (sum) as we process each event. \n\nWait, in the code's loop, after updating sum and prefix, the code has a TODO condition. The current code is trying to compute lk and rk, but I'm not sure what they represent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j. Let me see:\n\nThe 'sum' variable is the current a_j at position p[0]. So, perhaps the maximum a_j is the maximum value of sum over all events. \n\nBut in the code, the variables lk and rk are being updated with expressions involving sum and p[0]. \n\nWait, the code's lines:\n\nlk = Math.max(lk, sum - m - p[0]);\n\nrk = Math.max(rk, sum - m + p[0]);\n\nHmm, perhaps these are trying to compute some constraints. Let me think of the condition for a flood. The flood occurs if any a_j exceeds m. So, the maximum a_j must be \u2264 m. \n\nSuppose that when all days are considered, the maximum a_j is M. To prevent the flood, we need to remove a day such that the new maximum is \u2264 m. \n\nThe problem requires for each day i, whether removing it would make the maximum \u2264 m. \n\nThe approach might be to find for each day i, the maximum a_j when that day is excluded. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative idea is to compute the maximum a_j when all days are considered. If this maximum is already \u2264 m, then removing any day would also keep it \u2264 m, so all answers are 1. \n\nOtherwise, for each day i, we need to check whether the maximum a_j without day i is \u2264 m. \n\nThe key is to find for each day i, the contribution of that day to the maximum a_j. \n\nSuppose the original maximum is M. If M > m, then we need to find days where their contribution to the maximum is such that removing them reduces the maximum to \u2264 m. \n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the sum of all p_i's at their peak positions. Wait, no. The a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i (since for each rain, the contribution at x_i is p_i - 0 = p_i). So the a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i. \n\nWait, that's a crucial point! The a_j at each x_i is the sum of all p_i's. Because for each rain, the contribution at its own x_i is p_i. So the a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i's. \n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given position j, the contribution from each rain is p_i - |x_i - j|. So when j is exactly x_i, the contribution from that rain is p_i. The contributions from other rains are p_k - |x_k - x_i|. \n\nWait, no, the a_j at x_i is the sum over all rains of (p_i - |x_i - x_i|) + (p_k - |x_k - x_i|) for all other k. \n\nWait, no, the a_j at x_i is the sum over all rains of (p_i - |x_i - j|) where j is x_i. So for each rain, the term is p_i - |x_i - x_i| = p_i. So the total a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i's. \n\nWait, that's correct! Because for each rain, when j is x_i, the contribution is p_i. So the total a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_i's. \n\nTherefore, the maximum a_j is at least the sum of all p_i's. Wait, no, that's only at the x_i positions. But maybe there are other positions where the sum is higher? \n\nWait, no. Because the a_j function for each rain is a V-shape peaking at x_i. The sum of all these V-shapes would have peaks at each x_i, but the maximum among all those peaks would be the maximum of the sum of p_i's at each x_i. \n\nWait, but the sum of p_i's at each x_i is the same for all x_i? No, because each x_i is different. Wait, no. For example, suppose there are two rains: one at x=1 with p=3, and another at x=2 with p=2. The a_j at x=1 is 3 (from first rain) + (2 - |2-1|) = 3 +1 =4. The a_j at x=2 is 2 (second) + (3 - |1-2|) = 2+2=4. The a_j at x=1.5 would be 3 -0.5 (distance from first) plus 2 -0.5 (distance from second) \u2192 2.5 +1.5 =4. So the maximum is 4. \n\nSo the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions of the sum of p_i minus the distances from that position to each x_i. \n\nHmm, but the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions of the sum of (p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nThe maximum of this function occurs at a position j where the sum of p_i's minus the sum of |x_i - j| is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions j of (sum_{i} p_i - sum_{i} |x_i - j|). \n\nThis can be rewritten as (sum p_i) - (sum |x_i - j|). To maximize this, we need to minimize the sum of |x_i - j|. \n\nThe sum of absolute deviations is minimized at the median of the x_i's. So the maximum a_j would be (sum p_i) - (minimum sum of |x_i - j|). \n\nWait, but that's only if the sum of p_i is fixed. Wait, no, the sum of p_i is fixed, so the maximum a_j is (sum p_i) minus the minimal possible sum of |x_i - j|. \n\nWait, but the minimal sum of |x_i - j| is achieved at the median of the x_i's. So the maximum a_j would be (sum p_i) minus that minimal sum. \n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose there are two points at x=1 and x=3, with p=1 each. The sum p_i is 2. The minimal sum of |x_i - j| is achieved at j=2, which gives 1+1=2. So the a_j at j=2 would be 2 - 2 =0? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the a_j at j=2 would be (1 - |1-2|) + (1 - |3-2|) \u2192 (0) + (0) \u2192 0. But the a_j at x=1 is (1-0) + (1-2) \u2192 1-1=0. Wait, that's strange. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, for the two points at x=1 and x=3 with p=1 each:\n\nAt j=1: contribution from first is 1, from second is 1 - |3-1|=1-2= -1. So total a_j is 0. \n\nAt j=2: first contributes 1-1=0, second contributes 1-1=0 \u2192 total 0. \n\nAt j=3: similar to j=1, total 0. \n\nHmm, so the maximum a_j here is 0? But the sum of p_i is 2. \n\nWait, that's because the p_i's are small. So in this case, the maximum a_j is 0. \n\nHmm, so my previous reasoning was incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions of the sum of (p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nThe maximum occurs where the sum of p_i minus the sum of |x_i - j| is maximized. \n\nThis can be rewritten as (sum p_i) - (sum |x_i - j|). To maximize this, we need to minimize the sum of |x_i - j|. \n\nThe minimal sum of |x_i - j| is achieved at the median of the x_i's. So the maximum a_j would be (sum p_i) minus that minimal sum. \n\nWait, in the example above, the minimal sum is 2 (at j=2), so the maximum a_j would be 2-2=0, which matches. \n\nAnother example: three points at x=1,3,5 with p=3 each. \n\nSum p_i is 9. The median is 3. The sum of |x_i -3| is 2+0+2=4. So maximum a_j is 9-4=5. \n\nAt j=3, each contributes 3-0, 3-0, 3-2 \u2192 wait, no. Wait, the contributions are:\n\nAt j=3:\n\nFirst rain (x=1, p=3): 3 - |1-3| = 3-2=1.\n\nSecond (x=3, p=3): 3-0=3.\n\nThird (x=5, p=3): 3 - |5-3|=3-2=1.\n\nTotal is 1+3+1=5. Which matches. \n\nSo the maximum a_j is indeed (sum p_i) minus the minimal sum of |x_i - j|. \n\nTherefore, the maximum a_j is (sum p_i) - (min_sum |x_i - j|). \n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each day i, compute the maximum a_j when that day's p_i is set to 0. \n\nThe maximum a_j in that case would be (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum |x_i - j| excluding the i-th day's contribution). \n\nWait, no. Because when we remove day i, the sum of p_i becomes sum_p - p_i, and the minimal sum of |x_k - j| (over all days except i) is the minimal sum for the remaining days. \n\nWait, the maximum a_j when excluding day i is (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum |x_k - j| for the remaining days). \n\nSo, to compute this for each i, we need to know two things:\n\n1. The new sum of p's (sum_p - p_i).\n\n2. The minimal sum of |x_k - j| for the remaining days (excluding i).\n\nThe maximum a_j after removing day i is (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum). \n\nIf this value is \u2264 m, then the answer for that day is 1. \n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each i, compute (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum_without_i) \u2264 m. \n\nRearranged, this is equivalent to (sum_p - p_i) - m \u2264 min_sum_without_i. \n\nHmm, but how do we compute min_sum_without_i for each i efficiently?\n\nThe minimal sum of absolute deviations (min_sum) for a set of points is the median of those points. \n\nThe minimal sum is achieved at the median of the x coordinates of the remaining days. \n\nTherefore, for each i, we need to compute the median of the x coordinates excluding the i-th day, then compute the sum of absolute deviations from that median. \n\nBut doing this for each i would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe original maximum a_j is (sum_p) - (min_sum). \n\nIf the original maximum exceeds m, then we need to find days i where removing them reduces the maximum to \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum after removing i is (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum_without_i). \n\nWe need this to be \u2264 m. \n\nSo, (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum_without_i) \u2264 m \n\n=> (sum_p - p_i - m) \u2264 min_sum_without_i \n\nSo for each i, if the min_sum_without_i is \u2265 (sum_p - p_i - m), then it's okay. \n\nBut how to compute min_sum_without_i efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that min_sum_without_i depends on the median of the remaining x's. \n\nComputing the median for each i is O(n), which is too slow. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute some structures. \n\nLet me think of the median. The median is the middle element when the x's are sorted. \n\nSuppose we have all the x's sorted in an array. \n\nThe median is at position n/2 (for even n, either of the two middle elements). \n\nThe minimal sum is the sum of absolute deviations from the median. \n\nNow, when we remove one element, the new median can be found by removing that element from the sorted array and finding the new median. \n\nBut even this requires O(n) per query. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute prefix and suffix arrays for the sorted x's. \n\nLet me think of the sorted array of x's. Let's call it sorted_x. \n\nThe median is at position mid = (n-1)/2 (for 0-based). \n\nSuppose we remove the element at position k in the sorted array. The new median would be at (n-2)/2 if n was even, etc. \n\nBut even so, calculating the sum of absolute deviations for each possible k is O(n), which is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe minimal sum of absolute deviations is the median. \n\nThe sum can be computed as follows: \n\nSuppose the sorted array is x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 x_n. \n\nThe median is x_m where m = (n-1)/2 (for odd n) or m = n/2 (for even). \n\nThe sum is sum_{i=1 to n} |x_i - x_m|. \n\nIf we remove x_k, then the new median is x_{m'}, where m' is the median index of the remaining elements. \n\nThe new sum is sum_{i\u2260k} |x_i - x_{m'}|. \n\nThis is still O(n) per query. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute for all possible medians and their sums, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached differently. \n\nLet me think back to the line sweep approach in the given code. \n\nThe code is trying to process events to track the maximum a_j. \n\nThe variables lk and rk are being updated with expressions involving sum and p[0]. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j. Let me see:\n\nThe 'sum' variable is the current a_j at the current position. \n\nThe maximum a_j would be the maximum value of 'sum' encountered during the sweep. \n\nBut in the code, the loop is processing events in order, and for each event, after updating sum and prefix, the code has a TODO condition. \n\nThe current code is trying to compute lk and rk, but I'm not sure what they are. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor each event in the sorted list:\n\n    sum += prefix * (p[0] - lst)\n\n    prefix += p[1]\n\n    lst = p[0]\n\n    if (TODO condition) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    // then update lk and rk\n\nWait, perhaps the 'sum' variable is the current a_j at position p[0]. \n\nThe maximum a_j would be the maximum of all 'sum' values. \n\nBut the code is not tracking the maximum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j as follows: \n\nThe maximum a_j can be found at the peak of the a_j function. The peaks occur at the x_i positions. \n\nSo, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the a_j at each x_i. \n\nBecause the a_j function is a sum of V-shaped functions, the maximum is either at one of the peaks (x_i) or at some point between two peaks. \n\nWait, but the maximum could also be at a point where the slope changes from positive to negative. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the a_j at all the x_i's. \n\nBecause each x_i is a peak for its own V-shape, but the sum could have a higher peak elsewhere. \n\nHmm, but in the first example I thought of earlier, the maximum was at the median. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum a_j is the maximum of the a_j at all the x_i's. \n\nIf that's the case, then for each day i, the maximum a_j when excluding day i would be the maximum of the a_j at all x_k (k !=i) when day i is excluded. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum a_j is the maximum of the a_j at all the x_i's. \n\nIf that's true, then the problem reduces to checking for each day i, whether the maximum a_j (excluding day i) at all x_k (k !=i) is \u2264 m. \n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nThe a_j at x_k when excluding day i is (sum_p - p_i) if k is not i, but wait no. \n\nWait, the a_j at x_k when excluding day i is the sum over all days except i of (p_j - |x_j - x_k|). \n\nThe term for day i (if it's not the current k) would be p_i - |x_i - x_k|. \n\nWait, but when excluding day i, that term is removed. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nLet me think of the code's approach again. \n\nThe code is using a line sweep to track the slope and the current a_j. \n\nThe events are the start, peak, and end of each rain's contribution. \n\nThe 'prefix' variable is the current slope. \n\nThe 'sum' variable is the current a_j at the current position. \n\nThe code is trying to compute the maximum a_j by tracking the maximum 'sum' encountered. \n\nBut in the current code, the maximum is not being tracked. \n\nThe code's variables lk and rk are being updated with expressions involving sum and p[0]. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and the minimum a_j? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, determine whether removing it would reduce the maximum below m. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach might be to compute for each day i, the contribution of that day to the maximum a_j. \n\nSuppose the maximum a_j is M. If M > m, then we need to find days where their contribution to M is such that removing them reduces the maximum to \u2264 m. \n\nThe contribution of day i to the maximum a_j is the p_i term. \n\nWait, the maximum a_j is the sum of all p_i's at their own x_i positions. \n\nWait, no, the a_j at x_i is the sum of all p_j's minus the sum of |x_j - x_i|. \n\nWait, no, the a_j at x_i is the sum of (p_j - |x_j - x_i|) for all j. \n\nWait, for each j, the term is p_j - |x_j - x_i|. \n\nSo the total a_j at x_i is sum_{j} (p_j - |x_j - x_i|). \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all x of sum_{j} (p_j - |x_j -x|). \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, check whether the maximum a_j without day i is \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum a_j without day i is the maximum over all x of (sum_{j\u2260i} (p_j - |x_j -x|)). \n\nThis can be written as (sum_p - p_i) - (sum_{j\u2260i} |x_j -x|). \n\nThe maximum of this is (sum_p - p_i) minus the minimal sum of |x_j -x| for j\u2260i. \n\nSo the maximum a_j without day i is (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum_without_i). \n\nWe need this to be \u2264 m. \n\nSo, (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum_without_i) \u2264 m \n\n=> min_sum_without_i \u2265 (sum_p - p_i) - m \n\nSo for each i, we need to check if the minimal sum of absolute deviations (min_sum_without_i) for the remaining days is at least (sum_p - p_i - m). \n\nThe problem now is to compute min_sum_without_i for each i efficiently. \n\nThe minimal sum of absolute deviations is achieved at the median of the x_j's (excluding i). \n\nThe minimal sum is the sum of absolute deviations from the median. \n\nSo, for each i, we need to compute the median of the x_j's excluding x_i, then compute the sum of absolute deviations from that median. \n\nBut doing this for each i is O(n^2), which is too slow. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to precompute the medians and sums in a way that allows O(1) or O(log n) per query. \n\nLet me think of the sorted array of x's. \n\nSuppose the x's are sorted as x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 x_n. \n\nThe median is at position m = (n-1)/2 (for odd n) or m = n/2 (for even). \n\nThe minimal sum is the sum of absolute deviations from x_m. \n\nNow, when we remove x_k, the new median is at position m' = (n-2)/2 if n was even, etc. \n\nThe new median is either x_{m} or x_{m-1} or x_{m+1} depending on where k is. \n\nBut even so, calculating the sum for each i is O(n), which is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe minimal sum_without_i is the minimal sum of absolute deviations for the remaining points. \n\nThe minimal sum is the sum of absolute deviations from the median of the remaining points. \n\nThe median of the remaining points can be found quickly if the array is sorted. \n\nSuppose the array is sorted. \n\nIf we remove x_k, the new median is at position (n-2)/2 if n was even, etc. \n\nBut the sum of absolute deviations can be computed using prefix sums. \n\nLet me think of the sorted array. \n\nLet's precompute prefix sums of the x's. \n\nLet prefix[i] = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_i. \n\nThe median is at position m. \n\nThe sum of absolute deviations from x_m can be computed as: \n\nsum_{i=1 to m} (x_m - x_i) + sum_{i=m+1 to n} (x_i - x_m) \n\n= m*x_m - (prefix[m] - x_1) + (prefix[n] - prefix[m]) - (n - m)*x_m \n\nWait, perhaps using the prefix array, we can compute this efficiently. \n\nLet me denote the median as x_m. \n\nThe sum is: \n\nsum_{i=1 to m} (x_m - x_i) + sum_{i=m+1 to n} (x_i - x_m) \n\n= m*x_m - sum_{i=1 to m} x_i + sum_{i=m+1 to n} x_i - (n - m)*x_m \n\n= (m - (n - m)) * x_m + (sum_{i=m+1 to n} x_i - sum_{i=1 to m} x_i) \n\nHmm, but this might not help directly. \n\nAlternatively, the sum can be written as: \n\nsum_{i=1 to n} |x_i - x_m| \n\n= 2 * (x_m * m - prefix[m]) + (x_m*(n - m) - (prefix[n] - prefix[m])) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the sum can be computed as follows: \n\nThe median is at position m. \n\nThe sum is the sum of all elements to the right of the median minus the sum of all elements to the left of the median, plus the median's contribution. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to precompute for each possible median position the sum of absolute deviations. \n\nBut even that might not help for the case when we remove an element. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the line sweep approach again. \n\nThe code's current approach is using events to track the slope and the current a_j. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of 'sum' encountered during the sweep. \n\nThe code is not tracking this maximum, but perhaps the 'sum' variable is the current a_j at the current position. \n\nThe maximum a_j would be the maximum of all 'sum' values. \n\nThe code's loop is processing events in order. \n\nThe 'sum' is computed as the previous sum plus the prefix (slope) multiplied by the distance between the current position and the last. \n\nThe 'prefix' is the current slope. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all 'sum' values. \n\nSo, to compute the maximum a_j, we need to track the maximum 'sum' during the loop. \n\nThe current code is not doing this, but perhaps that's what the TODO is for. \n\nWait, the code has a TODO in the loop's condition. \n\nThe code's current loop is:\n\nfor (long[] p : list) {\n\n    sum += prefix * (p[0] - lst);\n\n    prefix += p[1];\n\n    lst = p[0];\n\n    if (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    // then update lk and rk\n\n}\n\nThe 'sum' is the current a_j at position p[0]. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all 'sum' values. \n\nSo, perhaps the code should track the maximum a_j. \n\nBut the code is trying to compute something else. \n\nThe variables lk and rk are being updated with:\n\nlk = Math.max(lk, sum - m - p[0]);\n\nrk = Math.max(rk, sum - m + p[0]);\n\nHmm, perhaps these are trying to compute some bounds. \n\nWait, the condition for a flood is that the maximum a_j exceeds m. \n\nSuppose the maximum a_j is M. \n\nIf M \u2264 m, then all days can be erased (since even without any rain, the maximum is 0 \u2264 m). \n\nOtherwise, for each day i, we need to see whether removing it would reduce the maximum to \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum after removing day i is M_i. \n\nWe need M_i \u2264 m. \n\nThe code's approach might be to precompute the maximum a_j (M), and then for each day i, determine whether removing it would reduce the maximum below or equal to m. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to compute for each day i, the contribution of that day to the maximum a_j. \n\nSuppose the maximum a_j is achieved at position j. \n\nIf the contribution of day i to a_j is p_i - |x_i - j|, then removing day i would reduce a_j by that amount. \n\nIf the new a_j is \u2264 m, then it's possible that the maximum is now lower. \n\nBut this requires knowing where the maximum occurs and which days contribute to it. \n\nThis seems difficult. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to compute for each day i the minimal required to not have a flood when that day is removed. \n\nThe variables lk and rk might be some constraints derived from the maximum a_j. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, check whether the day's contribution to the maximum is such that removing it would bring the maximum down. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is to compute for each day i the conditions that must be met for the maximum a_j after removing i to be \u2264 m. \n\nThe variables lk and rk might represent some bounds that must be satisfied. \n\nThe code's final loop for each rain is:\n\nif(rain[1] - rain[0] >= lk && rain[1] + rain[0] >= rk) {\n\n    aa(1);\n\n} else {\n\n    aa(0);\n\n}\n\nHmm, the condition is checking whether the rain's p_i - x_i is >= lk and p_i +x_i >= rk. \n\nNot sure what lk and rk represent. \n\nPerhaps lk and rk are the lower and upper bounds of some interval that must be satisfied for the day's exclusion to be valid. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, compute whether the maximum a_j without i is \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum a_j without i is the maximum over all positions of (sum_p - p_i) - (sum of |x_j - position| for j\u2260i). \n\nThe maximum of this is (sum_p - p_i) - (min_sum_without_i). \n\nWe need this to be \u2264 m. \n\nSo, (sum_p - p_i) - min_sum_without_i \u2264 m \n\n=> min_sum_without_i \u2265 (sum_p - p_i) - m \n\nThe min_sum_without_i is the minimal sum of absolute deviations for the remaining points. \n\nThe minimal sum is the sum of absolute deviations from the median of the remaining points. \n\nSo, the condition is whether the median of the remaining points has a sum of absolute deviations \u2265 (sum_p - p_i - m). \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to precompute the median and the sum for the entire set, and then for each i, compute the new median and sum quickly. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, see if removing it would reduce the maximum below m. \n\nThe maximum a_j is M. \n\nIf M \u2264 m, then all days are valid (output 1 for all). \n\nElse, for each day i, the maximum a_j after removing i is M_i. \n\nWe need M_i \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum M_i is the maximum of all a_j excluding day i. \n\nThe maximum M_i could be the maximum of the previous maximum excluding the contribution of day i, or some other peak. \n\nThis is tricky. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, check whether the contribution of day i to the maximum is such that M - contribution_i \u2264 m. \n\nIf that's the case, then removing day i would reduce the maximum to M - contribution_i \u2264 m. \n\nBut this is only true if the maximum was achieved at a point where day i contributed its maximum. \n\nFor example, if the maximum a_j was achieved at the position of day i's x_i, then the contribution of day i to that a_j is p_i. \n\nSo, the maximum a_j after removing day i would be (M - p_i). \n\nIf this is \u2264 m, then it's valid. \n\nBut this is only true if the maximum was achieved at x_i. \n\nIf the maximum was achieved elsewhere, then removing day i might not reduce the maximum by p_i. \n\nHmm, this approach would work only if the maximum is achieved at one of the x_i's. \n\nBut earlier example shows that the maximum can be achieved elsewhere. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum a_j is always achieved at one of the x_i's. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose we have two rain days: x1=1, p1=3; x2=3, p2=3. \n\nThe a_j at x=2 is (3-1)+(3-1) = 2+2=4. \n\nThe a_j at x=1 is 3 + (3-2)=4. \n\nThe a_j at x=3 is (3-2) +3 =4. \n\nSo the maximum is 4, achieved at all three points. \n\nSo the maximum is achieved at x=2, which is not one of the x_i's. \n\nSo the maximum can be achieved at a non-x_i position. \n\nThus, the previous idea won't work. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps the line sweep approach in the code is the way to go. \n\nThe code's current approach is using events to track the slope and the current a_j. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of 'sum' encountered during the sweep. \n\nThe code is not tracking this maximum, but perhaps the TODO is to track it. \n\nLet me think: \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all 'sum' values computed during the loop. \n\nSo, in the loop, after updating 'sum', we can track the maximum. \n\nBut the code's current loop has a TODO condition. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and store it in some variable. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, determine whether removing it would reduce the maximum below m. \n\nBut how to do that efficiently? \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to compute for each day i the contribution to the maximum a_j. \n\nThe maximum a_j is M. \n\nIf M \u2264 m, then all days are valid. \n\nElse, for each day i, the maximum a_j after removing i is M_i. \n\nWe need M_i \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum M_i is the maximum of all a_j excluding day i. \n\nThe maximum M_i could be M - contribution_i, but only if the maximum was achieved at a point where day i contributed its maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum M_i could be the second highest maximum. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for hints in the code's existing structure. \n\nThe code's final loop for each rain is:\n\nif(rain[1] - rain[0] >= lk && rain[1] + rain[0] >= rk) {\n\n    aa(1);\n\n} else {\n\n    aa(0);\n\n}\n\nThe variables lk and rk are computed as the maximum between their current value and (sum - m - p[0]) and (sum - m + p[0]), respectively. \n\nWait, the p[0] here is the position of the current event. \n\nThe sum is the current a_j at that position. \n\nThe expression sum - m - p[0] and sum - m + p[0] are being tracked. \n\nPerhaps these are the lower and upper bounds for some condition. \n\nSuppose that the maximum a_j is M. \n\nThe condition for a flood is M > m. \n\nTo prevent the flood after removing day i, the new maximum must be \u2264 m. \n\nThe code's condition for day i being valid is whether (rain[1] - rain[0] >= lk) and (rain[1] + rain[0] >= rk). \n\nHmm, rain[1] is p_i, rain[0] is x_i. \n\nSo, the first condition is p_i - x_i >= lk \n\nThe second is p_i + x_i >= rk \n\nPerhaps lk and rk are the minimal required values for p_i -x_i and p_i +x_i to ensure that removing this day would reduce the maximum below m. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, the contribution of that day to the maximum. \n\nThe maximum a_j is M. \n\nIf M \u2264 m, then all days are valid. \n\nElse, for each day i, the maximum a_j after removing i is M_i. \n\nWe need M_i \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum M_i is the maximum of all a_j excluding day i. \n\nThe maximum a_j excluding day i is the maximum of all a_j values computed when day i's contribution is removed. \n\nThe contribution of day i to a_j at position j is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nSo, the a_j without day i is the original a_j minus this contribution. \n\nThe maximum of this is the maximum over all j of (a_j - contribution_i(j)). \n\nThe maximum of this is the original maximum minus the maximum contribution of day i to any a_j. \n\nWait, that's an important point! \n\nThe maximum a_j after removing day i is the original maximum a_j minus the maximum contribution of day i to any position j. \n\nBecause the contribution of day i to a_j is non-negative (since it's max(0, ...)), so the maximum a_j after removing i is the original maximum minus the maximum contribution of day i. \n\nIf this is true, then the condition is: \n\noriginal_max - contribution_i_max \u2264 m \n\n=> contribution_i_max \u2265 original_max - m \n\nSo, for each day i, if the maximum contribution of day i to any a_j is \u2265 (original_max - m), then removing it would reduce the maximum to \u2264 m. \n\nThis is a crucial insight! \n\nBecause then, the problem reduces to: \n\nCompute the original maximum a_j (M). \n\nFor each day i, compute the maximum contribution of that day to any a_j (which is p_i, since the contribution is p_i - |x_i - j|, and the maximum occurs at j = x_i, giving p_i). \n\nSo the maximum contribution of day i is p_i. \n\nThus, the condition is: \n\nM - p_i \u2264 m \n\n=> p_i \u2265 M - m \n\nSo, for each day i, if p_i \u2265 (M - m), then removing it would reduce the maximum to M - p_i \u2264 m. \n\nOtherwise, even after removing it, the maximum would still be M - p_i > m. \n\nWait, this is a brilliant simplification! \n\nBecause the maximum contribution of day i is p_i (achieved at its own x_i). \n\nThus, the maximum a_j after removing day i is at most M - p_i. \n\nTherefore, the condition is whether M - p_i \u2264 m. \n\nIf yes, then the answer is 1. \n\nOtherwise, it's 0. \n\nThis is a huge simplification! \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Compute the original maximum a_j (M). \n\n2. For each day i, if M - p_i \u2264 m \u2192 output 1, else 0. \n\nBut wait, this is only true if the maximum a_j after removing day i is exactly M - p_i. \n\nBut what if the original maximum was achieved at a position other than x_i? \n\nFor example, suppose the maximum was achieved at position j which is not x_i. \n\nThen, removing day i would reduce the a_j at j by the contribution of day i to j. \n\nThe new maximum could be either M - contribution_i(j) or some other value. \n\nBut the maximum contribution of day i is p_i (at its own x_i). \n\nSo the maximum a_j after removing day i is the maximum between (M - p_i) and the maximum of other a_j's. \n\nBut the other a_j's could have been lower than M. \n\nThus, the new maximum is at most M - p_i. \n\nBecause the original maximum was M, and removing day i reduces all a_j's by at least 0 and at most p_i. \n\nThe maximum after removal can't exceed M - 0 (if the maximum was achieved at a position where day i contributed 0). \n\nBut the maximum contribution of day i is p_i (at its own x_i). \n\nThus, the maximum after removal is at most M - p_i. \n\nTherefore, the condition is sufficient. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to: \n\nCompute M (the original maximum a_j). \n\nFor each day i, if M - p_i \u2264 m \u2192 output 1, else 0. \n\nThis is a huge simplification! \n\nNow, the problem is to compute M efficiently. \n\nHow to compute M? \n\nM is the maximum a_j over all positions j. \n\nThe a_j is the sum over all days of max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all j of this sum. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can use the line sweep approach. \n\nThe line sweep approach tracks the slope and the current a_j. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of 'sum' encountered during the sweep. \n\nSo, the code needs to track the maximum 'sum' during the loop. \n\nLooking back at the code provided, the loop is processing events and updating 'sum' and 'prefix'. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all 'sum' values. \n\nThus, the code needs to track this maximum. \n\nThe current code has a TODO in the loop's condition. \n\nPerhaps the code should track the maximum a_j. \n\nLet me see the code's loop again:\n\nfor (long[] p : list) {\n\n    sum += prefix * (p[0] - lst);\n\n    prefix += p[1];\n\n    lst = p[0];\n\n    if (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n        continue;\n\n    }\n\n    // then update lk and rk\n\n}\n\nThe 'sum' is the current a_j at position p[0]. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all 'sum' values. \n\nThus, the code should track the maximum. \n\nThe TODO condition is probably to check whether the current position is a point where the a_j could be a maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the code should track the maximum in a variable. \n\nSo, the code should have a variable like 'maxA' initialized to 0, and in each iteration, after updating 'sum', we do maxA = Math.max(maxA, sum). \n\nThen, after processing all events, the maximum a_j is maxA. \n\nThe code's current approach is not doing this, but that's what is needed. \n\nOnce we have maxA, then for each day i, we can check if maxA - p_i <= m. \n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO is probably to track the maximum. \n\nBut the code's current structure has variables lk and rk being updated. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j and then use it to compute the conditions for each day. \n\nBut the final loop uses lk and rk. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect and needs to be rewritten. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is trying to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, the condition is whether p_i >= (maxA - m). \n\nThus, the code should compute maxA, then for each day i, check if p_i >= (maxA - m). \n\nIf yes, then removing it would reduce the maximum to maxA - p_i <= m. \n\nThus, the code's final loop should be: \n\nlong maxA = ...; \n\nfor (long[] rain : rains) {\n\n    if (maxA - rain[1] <= m) {\n\n        aa('1');\n\n    } else {\n\n        aa('0');\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO is to track the maximum a_j. \n\nThe code's current variables lk and rk are probably not needed. \n\nBut the code's current structure has the final loop using lk and rk. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is different. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is correct but I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, the condition is whether the day's contribution to the maximum is such that removing it would bring the maximum down. \n\nThe maximum contribution of day i is p_i. \n\nThus, the condition is p_i >= (maxA - m). \n\nThus, the code should compute maxA, then for each day i, check if p_i >= (maxA - m). \n\nThe code's current final loop uses lk and rk, which are computed in the loop. \n\nPerhaps the code's variables lk and rk are storing (maxA - m). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe code's loop for events:\n\nsum is the current a_j at position p[0]. \n\nThe code updates lk and rk as:\n\nlk = Math.max(lk, sum - m - p[0]);\n\nrk = Math.max(rk, sum - m + p[0]);\n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all 'sum' values. \n\nSuppose the maximum a_j is M. \n\nThen, the maximum of (sum - m) is M - m. \n\nBut how does this relate to lk and rk? \n\nThe expressions sum - m - p[0] and sum - m + p[0] are being tracked. \n\nThe maximum of (sum - m - p[0]) over all events would be (M - m - x_i) for some i. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum of (sum - m) over all positions. \n\nThe maximum a_j is M. \n\nThe maximum of (sum - m) is M - m. \n\nIf this is positive, then there is a flood. \n\nFor each day i, the condition is whether removing it would make the maximum a_j \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum a_j after removing i is M_i. \n\nWe need M_i \u2264 m \u2192 M_i - m \u2264 0. \n\nThe maximum of (M_i - m) must be \u22640. \n\nThe maximum M_i is the maximum a_j after removing i. \n\nAs before, M_i is at most M - p_i. \n\nThus, the condition is M - p_i \u2264 m \u2192 p_i \u2265 M - m. \n\nThus, the code should compute M, then for each day i, check if p_i >= (M - m). \n\nThus, the missing code is to track the maximum a_j (M) during the line sweep. \n\nThe current code's loop is not doing this. \n\nThe TODO is probably to track the maximum. \n\nThe code's current loop has a condition with a TODO. \n\nPerhaps the code should track the maximum in a variable like maxA. \n\nSo, the missing code in the TODO is to update maxA. \n\nThe code's loop should have something like:\n\nmaxA = Math.max(maxA, sum);\n\nBut the code's current structure has the TODO in an if condition. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is supposed to process events and track the maximum. \n\nThe code's current loop has a condition that is missing. \n\nPerhaps the code should not skip any events, so the TODO condition should be 'false', and the code should track the maximum. \n\nThus, the missing code is to initialize maxA to 0, and in each iteration, update maxA. \n\nThe code's current variables lk and rk are probably not needed. \n\nThe final loop should use maxA. \n\nThus, the code needs to be modified as follows: \n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nlong maxA = 0;\n\nThen, in the loop over the events:\n\nsum += prefix * (p[0] - lst);\n\nprefix += p[1];\n\nlst = p[0];\n\nmaxA = Math.max(maxA, sum);\n\nThen, after processing all events, compute maxA. \n\nThen, for each rain in rains:\n\nif (maxA - rain[1] <= m) \u2192 output '1', else '0'. \n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO is to track the maximum. \n\nThe current code's variables lk and rk are probably not needed and are part of an incorrect approach. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the maximum a_j and then for each day i, check if p_i >= (maxA - m). \n\nThus, the code should be modified to track the maximum a_j. \n\nThe missing code in the TODO is to update the maximum. \n\nThe code's current loop has a condition with a TODO. \n\nPerhaps the code should not have that condition and just track the maximum. \n\nThus, the missing code is to add a line to track the maximum. \n\nThe code's current loop has:\n\nsum += prefix * (p[0] - lst);\n\nprefix += p[1];\n\nlst = p[0];\n\n// TODO: Your code here \n\nif (/* condition */) continue;\n\nBut the correct code
