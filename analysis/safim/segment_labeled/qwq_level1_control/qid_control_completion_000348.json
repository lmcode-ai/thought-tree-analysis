Because if you take all those blocks, their total area is the sum of their lengths (since each has height 1), and that sum must be >= s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where the sum of ceil(i/2) for all i from 1 to m (where m is the largest i such that ceil(i/2) \u2264 s) is >= s\u00b2. Wait, but m would be the maximum block number where ceil(i/2) \u2264 s. Let me think. Let me see the example given. For n=5, the blocks are:\n\nBlock 1: ceil(1/2)=1\n\nBlock 2: ceil(2/2)=1\n\nBlock3: ceil(3/2)=2\n\nBlock4: 2\n\nBlock5:3. The example says the maximum s is 3. Let's see:\n\nTo get s=3, the sum of the areas of the blocks used must be at least 3^2=9. Let's see the total of all blocks up to 5: 1+1+2+2+3 =9. So exactly 9. So that's why s=3 is possible. But if s=4, then s\u00b2 is 16. The sum of all blocks up to n=5 is 9 <16, so can't do that. So the maximum is 3. So the approach is to find the maximum s where the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to some m (where m is the maximum block number with ceil(m/2) \u2264 s) is at least s squared.

      "text": "First, for a given s, what is the maximum m such that ceil(m/2) \u2264 s?\n\nLet me think: ceil(m/2) \u2264 s \u2192 m/2 \u2264 s + 0.5 (since ceil(m/2) is the smallest integer \u2265 m/2). So m/2 \u2264 s \u2192 m \u2264 2s. Wait, let's see:\n\nceil(m/2) \u2264 s \u2192 m/2 \u2264 s \u2192 m \u2264 2s. Because if m is even, m/2 is exactly s, so m=2s gives ceil(2s/2)=s. If m is 2s+1, then ceil((2s+1)/2) = s+0.5 rounded up, which is s+1, which is more than s. So the maximum m where ceil(m/2) \u2264 s is 2s. So m_max = 2s. Wait, let me check with m=2s: ceil(2s/2) = s, which is okay. m=2s+1 would give ceil((2s+1)/2) = s+0.5 \u2192 s+1, which is over. So yes, m_max is 2s. So for a given s, the maximum m is 2s, but we can't exceed n. So the actual m is min(2s, n). Then the sum of the lengths up to m is the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to m.\n\nWe need to find the maximum s where sum_{i=1 to m} ceil(i/2) >= s^2, where m is min(2s, n). So the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that sum_{i=1 to m} ceil(i/2) >= s\u00b2, where m = min(2s, n). Now, the key is to compute this sum efficiently. Let me find a formula for the sum of ceil(i/2) from i=1 to m.\n\nLet me see:\n\nceil(i/2) for i from 1 to m:\n\ni=1 \u2192 1\n\ni=2 \u21921\n\ni=3 \u21922\n\ni=4 \u21922\n\ni=5 \u21923\n\ni=6 \u21923, etc. So for each pair of numbers, the value increases by 1 every two steps. So for even i: i=2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2)=k\n\ni=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2) =k.\n\nSo for each k, the terms for i=2k-1 and 2k are both k. So each pair contributes 2k. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor k from 1 to m/2: Wait, perhaps it's better to split into even and odd terms. Let me think of the sum S(m) = sum_{i=1 to m} ceil(i/2). Let me see for m even and odd. Case 1: m is even, m=2k. Then the terms are:\n\nFor i=1 and 2 \u2192 1 each \u2192 total 2*1\n\ni=3 and4 \u21922 each \u2192 total 2*2\n\n...\n\ni=2k-1 and 2k \u2192k each \u2192 total 2*k. So the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) =k(k+1). Since m=2k \u2192k = m/2 \u2192 sum is (m/2)*(m/2 +1). Case 2: m is odd, m=2k+1. Then the first 2k terms (even m=2k) sum to k(k+1). Then the last term (i=2k+1) is ceil((2k+1)/2) =k+1. So total sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. But since m=2k+1 \u2192k = (m-1)/2 \u2192 substituting, sum is ((m-1)/2 +1)^2 \u2192 ( (m+1)/2 )^2. So putting it all together:\n\nIf m is even: S(m) = (m/2)*(m/2 +1) If m is odd: S(m) = ((m+1)/2)^2. Alternatively, can we write this in a single formula? Yes. Let me see:\n\nLet m be any integer. Let k = floor(m/2). Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, note that for m even:\n\nS(m) = (m/2)*(m/2 +1) = (m(m+2))/4 ? Wait, let me compute for m=2:\n\nS(2) =1+1=2 \u2192 (2/2)*(2/2 +1) =1*(1+1)=2 \u2192 yes. m=4: 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 (4/2)*(4/2 +1)=2*3=6 \u2192 yes. For m=3 (odd):\n\nS(3)=1+1+2=4 \u2192 ((3+1)/2)^2 \u2192 (2)^2=4 \u2192 yes.\n\nm=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9 \u2192 ( (5+1)/2 )^2 \u2192 3\u00b2=9 \u2192 yes. So the formula can be written as:\n\nS(m) = floor( (m+1)/2 ) * ceil( (m+1)/2 ) Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute based on parity. Alternatively, S(m) can be written as:\n\nS(m) = ((m +1)/2)^2 when m is odd,\n\nand (m/2)*(m/2 +1) when even. Alternatively, since for even m, m/2 is an integer, so (m/2)*(m/2 +1) = (m^2 + 2m)/4. For odd m, ( (m+1)/2 )^2 = (m\u00b2 + 2m +1)/4. So combining both cases, S(m) = floor( (m+1)/2 ) * ceil( (m+1)/2 ), but perhaps it's easier to compute using the two cases. But regardless, the key is to compute S(m) efficiently. Now, the problem is to find the maximum s such that S( min(2s, n) ) >= s\u00b2. Wait, because m is the minimum between 2s and n. Because if 2s exceeds n, then m is n, but then the maximum s possible would be when m is n, but then s can't be larger than s_max where 2s_max <=n, but perhaps not. Wait, let me think again. The maximum possible s can't be larger than the s where 2s <=n, but also the sum must be sufficient. Alternatively, the maximum possible s is the largest s where either :\n\nCase 1: 2s <=n \u2192 then m=2s, and S(2s) >= s\u00b2. OR\n\nCase 2: 2s >n \u2192 then m =n, and S(n) >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest s where either of these holds. So to find the maximum s, we can model it as follows:\n\nWe need to find the maximum s such that:\n\nif 2s <=n \u2192 S(2s) >= s\u00b2,\n\nelse \u2192 S(n) >= s\u00b2. So the approach is to find the maximum s where this condition holds. Now, how do we compute this efficiently? The problem constraints are n up to 1e9 and t up to 1e4, so we need an O(1) or O(log n) per test case solution. Let me think of binary search. The maximum possible s can be up to sqrt(S(n)), but S(n) is roughly (n^2)/4 (since for even n, S(n)= (n/2)*(n/2 +1) ~ n\u00b2/4). So the maximum possible s is up to sqrt(S(n)) ~ n/2. So binary search over s from 0 to (n) would be feasible, but even better, perhaps we can find a formula. Alternatively, let's consider two cases: Case 1: s is such that 2s <=n \u2192 m=2s. Then the condition is S(2s) >= s\u00b2. Compute S(2s) when m is even (since 2s is even):\n\nS(2s) = (2s/2)*(2s/2 +1) = s*(s+1). So the condition becomes s*(s+1) > = s\u00b2 \u2192 s+1 >= s \u2192 which is always true. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, that would mean that for any s where 2s <=n, the sum S(2s) is s(s+1) which is s\u00b2 +s, which is always >= s\u00b2. So in this case, the condition is automatically satisfied. So whenever 2s <=n, then the sum is sufficient. So the only constraint here is that 2s < =n. So in this case, the maximum possible s in this scenario is s_max1 = min( floor(n/2), ... but wait, but the sum is sufficient, so the maximum s here is floor(n/2). But perhaps there's a higher s where even when 2s exceeds n, but the sum of all blocks (m=n) is still >= s\u00b2. Wait, so the maximum s can be up to the maximum between floor(n/2) and the s where S(n) >= s\u00b2. Wait, let me think again. Suppose n is very large. For example, n=1e9. Then 2s can be up to n, so s_max1 is n/2. The sum S(2s_max1) = s_max1*(s_max1 +1) which is s_max1 squared plus s_max1. So s_max1 squared is (n/2)^2, and the sum is (n/2)^2 + n/2, which is more than (n/2)^2. So the condition holds. So in this case, the maximum s could be up to n/2. But perhaps when n is small, like in the example n=5, the maximum s is 3, which is indeed 5//2 is 2.5 \u2192 floor is 2, but the actual maximum is 3. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, in the example n=5, 2s_max1 would be 2*2=4, which is less than 5. So s_max1 is 2, but the actual maximum s is 3. So this suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. Wait, in the example n=5, when s=3, 2s=6 which is greater than n=5. So in that case, m is 5. The sum S(5) is 1+1+2+2+3 =9. s\u00b2 is 9, so it's exactly equal. So the condition holds. So in this case, s=3 is allowed even though 2s exceeds n. So the maximum s can be higher than floor(n/2). Ah, so the maximum s can be up to the maximum s where either:\n\nEither 2s <=n and s can be as high as possible (but in that case, the sum is sufficient), or when 2s>n, but the sum of all blocks (S(n)) is >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and the s where S(n)>=s\u00b2. Wait, but in the example n=5, floor(n/2)=2, but the actual maximum s is 3. So the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and the s where S(n)>=s\u00b2. Wait, but in this case, S(n)=9, so s can be 3, which is exactly sqrt(9). So the maximum s is 3, which is higher than floor(n/2)=2. So the correct maximum is the maximum s where S(n)>=s\u00b2, but only up to the point where s can be as high as possible. Wait, perhaps the maximum s is the floor of the square root of S(n), but that's not necessarily the case. Let me think. Wait, the maximum possible s is the largest s such that either:\n\n- s <= floor(n/2), and then the sum S(2s) = s(s+1) >= s\u00b2 \u2192 which is always true, so any s up to floor(n/2) is allowed. So the maximum s in this case is floor(n/2). OR\n\n- s > floor(n/2), but then m =n, and S(n) >= s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and the largest s where S(n)>=s\u00b2 and s> floor(n/2).",

Therefore, the problem reduces to computing S(n), then taking the integer part of its square root. So the steps are: For each test case n:\n\n1. Compute S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2). 2. Compute s = floor( sqrt(S(n)) ) Then output s. So now, the problem is to compute S(n) efficiently. As we derived earlier, S(n) can be computed as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nS(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nS(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\nS(n) = ((n +1)/2) * ( (n)/2 +1 ) Wait, let me see:\n\nWait for even n=2k:\n\nS(n) =k*(k+1) \u2192 (2k/2)*(2k/2 +1) \u2192 yes.

Hmm, perhaps better to use integer division. Alternatively, let me write it as:\n\nLet k = (n +1)/2 when n is odd, and k = n/2 when even. Wait, perhaps the formula can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n +1) // 2 ) * ( (n) // 2 + 1 ) Wait, let me see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\n(n+1)//2 \u2192 (2k+1)/2 \u2192 floor division would be k (since 2k+1 divided by 2 is k.5 \u2192 floor is k). Wait, no. Wait, in integer division, (n+1)//2 for even n=2k is (2k+1)//2 \u2192 which is k (since 2k+1 divided by 2 is k.5 \u2192 floor is k). Wait, but then (n)//2 is k. So (n//2 +1) is k+1. So the product is k*(k+1) \u2192 correct. For odd n=2k+1:\n\n(n+1)//2 \u2192 (2k+2)/2 =k+1.\n\n(n)//2 \u2192 (2k+1)//2 =k.\n\nSo (k+1)*(k+1) \u2192 (k+1)^2 \u2192 correct. Yes! So the formula can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n +1) // 2 ) * ( (n // 2) + 1 )\n\nThis works for both even and odd n. So now, the steps are: For a given n:\n\nCompute S(n) = ((n+1)//2) * ( (n//2) +1 ) Then compute s = floor( sqrt(S(n)) ) Thus, the code can be written as follows. Now, the original code has a loop:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nBut in the original code, the loop is while(t-- >0), so the missing part is \"t-- >0\". Then inside the loop, the code reads n, and then computes the answer. The original code had System.out.println( (long)ceil(n/2.0) ), which is incorrect. Because in the example n=5, that would give 2.5 \u2192 ceil is 3, which is correct. Wait, but in the example, the correct answer is 3, which matches. Wait, but according to our analysis, the correct answer is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), which for n=5 is 3. So in this case, ceil(n/2) gives the correct answer. But for n=7, ceil(7/2)=4, which is correct. For n=6, ceil(6/2)=3, which is correct. For n=9, ceil(9/2)=5, which is correct. Wait, so is the original code correct? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the original code computes (long)ceil(n/2.0).

For n=4, ceil(4/2)=2 \u2192 correct. For n=8, ceil(8/2)=4 \u2192 correct. For n=9, ceil(9/2)=5 \u2192 correct. For n=10, ceil(10/2)=5 \u2192 correct. For n=11, ceil(11/2)=6 \u2192 which is correct (since S(11)=36 \u2192 sqrt(36)=6). Wait, so in all the examples I tried, the original code's output is correct. But according to our analysis, the correct answer is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), which for n=5 is 3, which is the same as ceil(n/2). So why is that?

Wait, so in all cases, ceil(n/2) equals floor( sqrt(S(n)) ). So the original code is correct? Wait, but why?\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me see for even n=2k:\n\nS(n) =k*(k+1). The sqrt(S(n)) is sqrt(k(k+1)). The floor of that is k, since k^2 <k(k+1) < (k+0.5)^2 ? Wait, let's see for k=2 (n=4):\n\nsqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor is 2 \u2192 which is k=2. ceil(n/2)=2 \u2192 same.\n\nk=3 (n=6): sqrt(3*4)=sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3 \u2192 same as ceil(6/2)=3.\n\nk=4 (n=8): sqrt(4*5)=sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4 \u2192 same as ceil(8/2)=4. So for even n=2k, floor(sqrt(S(n))) =k = ceil(n/2). For odd n=2k+1:\n\nS(n) = (k+1)^2 \u2192 sqrt(S(n)) =k+1 \u2192 floor is k+1 \u2192 which is ceil( (2k+1)/2 ) =k+1. Thus, in all cases, floor( sqrt(S(n)) ) equals ceil(n/2). Wait, that's the key! So the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2). But how?\n\nWait, because for even n=2k, ceil(n/2)=k, and floor(sqrt(S(n)))=k. For odd n=2k+1, ceil(n/2)=k+1, and floor(sqrt(S(n)))=k+1. Thus, the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2). So the original code is correct?

Wait, so the original code is correct? But then why in the problem's first example, the answer is 3, which is exactly ceil(5/2)=3. So the code works. Wait, but then why did I think there was a problem earlier?",

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem correctly. Let's read the problem again carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n rectangular blocks. Each block i has a length of ceil(i/2) and height 1. The square must be formed without rotating the blocks, so the height of the square is the sum of the heights of the blocks used. Wait, no, wait. Wait, each block is 1 unit high. So when stacking them to form a square, the total height would be the sum of the heights of the blocks used. But since each is 1, the total height is the number of blocks used. But the square's side length must be such that both the height and the length meet the square's side. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the square's side length is s. So the square must be s units in both length and height. Since each block is 1 unit high, the total height contributed by all the blocks used must be at least s. But how are the blocks arranged? Since they can't be rotated, their orientation is fixed. So each block contributes 1 to the height, but their length contributes to the base length. Wait, maybe the square is built by arranging the blocks in such a way that the total area of the blocks is at least s^2, and the arrangement allows forming a square of side s. But the problem says \"using these blocks without rotating any of them\". So perhaps the square's area must be covered by the sum of the areas of the selected blocks, and the square's side must be as large as possible.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the maximum possible side length of a square you can create using these blocks, without rotating any of them\". So the square's area must be covered by the blocks. Each block has area 1 * ceil(i/2). So the sum of all selected blocks' areas must be at least s^2, and we need the largest s possible. But also, the arrangement must form a square. However, since the blocks can be arranged in any way as long as they are axis-aligned and not rotated, perhaps the key is that the sum of the areas must be at least s squared, and the maximum s where this is possible. But maybe there's a better way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square's side length s must satisfy that the sum of the lengths of the blocks (each contributes ceil(i/2) to the total length?) Wait, no. Wait, each block is 1 unit high and ceil(i/2) units long. So each block's area is ceil(i/2) * 1. The total area of all selected blocks must be at least s^2. But also, the way they are arranged must form a square of side s. Since the height of each block is 1, the total height of the square is the number of blocks stacked vertically. Wait, maybe the square's height is s, so the number of blocks used must be exactly s (since each contributes 1 to the height). But then the total length of those blocks must be at least s as well, because the square's side is s. Wait, perhaps the square is built by arranging the blocks in a way that the total length in each row is s, and there are s rows. But each block is 1 unit high, so each row is a horizontal arrangement of blocks whose total length adds up to s, and there are s such rows. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square's side length s must satisfy two conditions: the total area of the selected blocks is at least s\u00b2, and the maximum length of any single block is at most s (since you can't have a block longer than the square's side). Wait, but the problem says you can choose any subset of the blocks. So perhaps the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that the sum of the areas of some subset of the blocks is at least s\u00b2, and also each individual block's length is \u2264 s. Because if a block is longer than s, you can't include it in the square. Wait, but the problem says you can choose any subset, so you can exclude blocks that are too long. So the maximum s is the largest s where there exists a subset of the blocks (each of length \u2264 s) whose total area is at least s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where the sum of ceil(i/2) for all i from 1 to k (where k is some number \u2264n, and ceil(i/2) \u2264 s for all i up to k) is >= s\u00b2. Hmm, but how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to some point is at least s squared, and the largest block's length in that subset is exactly s. Wait, maybe not exactly, but the maximum block length in the subset must be \u2264 s. So the maximum s is the largest s where the sum of all blocks with ceil(i/2) \u2264 s is at least s squared. Because if you take all those blocks, their total area is the sum of their lengths (since each has height 1), and that sum must be >= s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s where the sum of ceil(i/2) for all i from 1 to m (where m is the largest i such that ceil(i/2) \u2264 s) is >= s\u00b2. Wait, but m would be the maximum block number where ceil(i/2) \u2264 s. Let me think.\n\nLet me see the example given. For n=5, the blocks are:\n\nBlock 1: ceil(1/2)=1\n\nBlock 2: ceil(2/2)=1\n\nBlock3: ceil(3/2)=2\n\nBlock4: 2\n\nBlock5:3.\n\nThe example says the maximum s is 3. Let's see:\n\nTo get s=3, the sum of the areas of the blocks used must be at least 3^2=9. Let's see the total of all blocks up to 5: 1+1+2+2+3 =9. So exactly 9. So that's why s=3 is possible. But if s=4, then s\u00b2 is 16. The sum of all blocks up to n=5 is 9 <16, so can't do that. So the maximum is 3.\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum s where the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to some m (where m is the maximum block number with ceil(m/2) \u2264 s) is at least s squared. Wait, but m can be up to n. So the maximum possible s is the largest s where the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to m (where m is the maximum possible such that ceil(m/2) \u2264 s) is at least s\u00b2, and m must be \u2264n.\n\nHmm, so how do we compute this?\n\nFirst, for a given s, what is the maximum m such that ceil(m/2) \u2264 s?\n\nLet me think: ceil(m/2) \u2264 s \u2192 m/2 \u2264 s + 0.5 (since ceil(m/2) is the smallest integer \u2265 m/2). So m/2 \u2264 s \u2192 m \u2264 2s. Wait, let's see:\n\nceil(m/2) \u2264 s \u2192 m/2 \u2264 s \u2192 m \u2264 2s. Because if m is even, m/2 is exactly s, so m=2s gives ceil(2s/2)=s. If m is 2s+1, then ceil((2s+1)/2) = s+0.5 rounded up, which is s+1, which is more than s. So the maximum m where ceil(m/2) \u2264 s is 2s. So m_max = 2s.\n\nWait, let me check with m=2s: ceil(2s/2) = s, which is okay. m=2s+1 would give ceil((2s+1)/2) = s+0.5 \u2192 s+1, which is over. So yes, m_max is 2s.\n\nSo for a given s, the maximum m is 2s, but we can't exceed n. So the actual m is min(2s, n). Then the sum of the lengths up to m is the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to m.\n\nWe need to find the maximum s where sum_{i=1 to m} ceil(i/2) >= s^2, where m is min(2s, n).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that sum_{i=1 to m} ceil(i/2) >= s\u00b2, where m = min(2s, n).\n\nNow, the key is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me find a formula for the sum of ceil(i/2) from i=1 to m.\n\nLet me see:\n\nceil(i/2) for i from 1 to m:\n\ni=1 \u2192 1\n\ni=2 \u21921\n\ni=3 \u21922\n\ni=4 \u21922\n\ni=5 \u21923\n\ni=6 \u21923, etc.\n\nSo for each pair of numbers, the value increases by 1 every two steps.\n\nSo for even i: i=2k \u2192 ceil(2k/2)=k\n\ni=2k-1 \u2192 ceil((2k-1)/2) =k.\n\nSo for each k, the terms for i=2k-1 and 2k are both k. So each pair contributes 2k.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor k from 1 to m/2:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split into even and odd terms.\n\nLet me think of the sum S(m) = sum_{i=1 to m} ceil(i/2).\n\nLet me see for m even and odd.\n\nCase 1: m is even, m=2k.\n\nThen the terms are:\n\nFor i=1 and 2 \u2192 1 each \u2192 total 2*1\n\ni=3 and4 \u21922 each \u2192 total 2*2\n\n...\n\ni=2k-1 and 2k \u2192k each \u2192 total 2*k.\n\nSo the sum is 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) =k(k+1).\n\nSince m=2k \u2192k = m/2 \u2192 sum is (m/2)*(m/2 +1).\n\nCase 2: m is odd, m=2k+1.\n\nThen the first 2k terms (even m=2k) sum to k(k+1). Then the last term (i=2k+1) is ceil((2k+1)/2) =k+1. So total sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2.\n\nBut since m=2k+1 \u2192k = (m-1)/2 \u2192 substituting, sum is ((m-1)/2 +1)^2 \u2192 ( (m+1)/2 )^2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nIf m is even: S(m) = (m/2)*(m/2 +1)\n\nIf m is odd: S(m) = ((m+1)/2)^2.\n\nAlternatively, can we write this in a single formula?\n\nYes. Let me see:\n\nLet m be any integer. Let k = floor(m/2). Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, note that for m even:\n\nS(m) = (m/2)*(m/2 +1) = (m(m+2))/4 ?\n\nWait, let me compute for m=2:\n\nS(2) =1+1=2 \u2192 (2/2)*(2/2 +1) =1*(1+1)=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nm=4: 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 (4/2)*(4/2 +1)=2*3=6 \u2192 yes.\n\nFor m=3 (odd):\n\nS(3)=1+1+2=4 \u2192 ((3+1)/2)^2 \u2192 (2)^2=4 \u2192 yes.\n\nm=5: 1+1+2+2+3=9 \u2192 ( (5+1)/2 )^2 \u2192 3\u00b2=9 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the formula can be written as:\n\nS(m) = floor( (m+1)/2 ) * ceil( (m+1)/2 )\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute based on parity.\n\nAlternatively, S(m) can be written as:\n\nS(m) = ((m +1)/2)^2 when m is odd,\n\nand (m/2)*(m/2 +1) when even.\n\nAlternatively, since for even m, m/2 is an integer, so (m/2)*(m/2 +1) = (m^2 + 2m)/4.\n\nFor odd m, ( (m+1)/2 )^2 = (m\u00b2 + 2m +1)/4.\n\nSo combining both cases, S(m) = floor( (m+1)/2 ) * ceil( (m+1)/2 ), but perhaps it's easier to compute using the two cases.\n\nBut regardless, the key is to compute S(m) efficiently.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that S( min(2s, n) ) >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, because m is the minimum between 2s and n. Because if 2s exceeds n, then m is n, but then the maximum s possible would be when m is n, but then s can't be larger than s_max where 2s_max <=n, but perhaps not.\n\nWait, let me think again. The maximum possible s can't be larger than the s where 2s <=n, but also the sum must be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible s is the largest s where either:\n\nCase 1: 2s <=n \u2192 then m=2s, and S(2s) >= s\u00b2.\n\nOR\n\nCase 2: 2s >n \u2192 then m =n, and S(n) >= s\u00b2.\n\nSo the maximum s is the largest s where either of these holds.\n\nSo to find the maximum s, we can model it as follows:\n\nWe need to find the maximum s such that:\n\nif 2s <=n \u2192 S(2s) >= s\u00b2,\n\nelse \u2192 S(n) >= s\u00b2.\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum s where this condition holds.\n\nNow, how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem constraints are n up to 1e9 and t up to 1e4, so we need an O(1) or O(log n) per test case solution.\n\nLet me think of binary search.\n\nThe maximum possible s can be up to sqrt(S(n)), but S(n) is roughly (n^2)/4 (since for even n, S(n)= (n/2)*(n/2 +1) ~ n\u00b2/4). So the maximum possible s is up to sqrt(S(n)) ~ n/2. So binary search over s from 0 to (n) would be feasible, but even better, perhaps we can find a formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: s is such that 2s <=n \u2192 m=2s.\n\nThen the condition is S(2s) >= s\u00b2.\n\nCompute S(2s) when m is even (since 2s is even):\n\nS(2s) = (2s/2)*(2s/2 +1) = s*(s+1).\n\nSo the condition becomes s*(s+1) >= s\u00b2 \u2192 s+1 >= s \u2192 which is always true. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, that would mean that for any s where 2s <=n, the sum S(2s) is s(s+1) which is s\u00b2 +s, which is always >= s\u00b2. So in this case, the condition is automatically satisfied. So whenever 2s <=n, then the sum is sufficient. So the only constraint here is that 2s <=n. So in this case, the maximum possible s in this scenario is s_max1 = min( floor(n/2), ... but wait, but the sum is sufficient, so the maximum s here is floor(n/2). But perhaps there's a higher s where even when 2s exceeds n, but the sum of all blocks (m=n) is still >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, so the maximum s can be up to the maximum between floor(n/2) and the s where S(n) >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose n is very large. For example, n=1e9. Then 2s can be up to n, so s_max1 is n/2. The sum S(2s_max1) = s_max1*(s_max1 +1) which is s_max1 squared plus s_max1. So s_max1 squared is (n/2)^2, and the sum is (n/2)^2 + n/2, which is more than (n/2)^2. So the condition holds. So in this case, the maximum s could be up to n/2. But perhaps when n is small, like in the example n=5, the maximum s is 3, which is indeed 5//2 is 2.5 \u2192 floor is 2, but the actual maximum is 3. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, in the example n=5, 2s_max1 would be 2*2=4, which is less than 5. So s_max1 is 2, but the actual maximum s is 3. So this suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, in the example n=5, when s=3, 2s=6 which is greater than n=5. So in that case, m is 5. The sum S(5) is 1+1+2+2+3 =9. s\u00b2 is 9, so it's exactly equal. So the condition holds. So in this case, s=3 is allowed even though 2s exceeds n. So the maximum s can be higher than floor(n/2).\n\nAh, so the maximum s can be up to the maximum s where either:\n\nEither 2s <=n and s can be as high as possible (but in that case, the sum is sufficient), or when 2s>n, but the sum of all blocks (S(n)) is >= s\u00b2.\n\nSo the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and the s where S(n)>=s\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in the example n=5, floor(n/2)=2, but the actual maximum s is 3. So the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and the s where S(n)>=s\u00b2. Wait, but in this case, S(n)=9, so s can be 3, which is exactly sqrt(9). So the maximum s is 3, which is higher than floor(n/2)=2. So the correct maximum is the maximum s where S(n)>=s\u00b2, but only up to the point where s can be as high as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum s is the floor of the square root of S(n), but that's not necessarily the case. Let me think.\n\nWait, the maximum possible s is the largest s such that either:\n\n- s <= floor(n/2), and then the sum S(2s) = s(s+1) >= s\u00b2 \u2192 which is always true, so any s up to floor(n/2) is allowed. So the maximum s in this case is floor(n/2).\n\nOR\n\n- s > floor(n/2), but then m =n, and S(n) >= s\u00b2.\n\nSo the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and the largest s where S(n)>=s\u00b2 and s> floor(n/2).\n\nWait, but the maximum s can be higher than floor(n/2) if S(n) allows it.\n\nSo the overall maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and the floor of sqrt(S(n)), but only if that sqrt is larger than floor(n/2).\n\nWait, let's see for n=5:\n\nS(n)=9 \u2192 sqrt(9)=3, which is larger than floor(5/2)=2. So the maximum s is 3.\n\nAnother example: n=4.\n\nThen S(4)=1+1+2+2=6. The floor(n/2)=2. sqrt(6) is ~2.45 \u2192 floor is 2. So maximum s is 2. But let's see:\n\nIf s=2, then 2s=4, so sum is 6. 2\u00b2=4 \u22646 \u2192 yes. So s=2 is okay. What about s=3? Then m=4 (since 2*3=6>4). The sum is 6, which is less than 9 (3\u00b2). So s=3 is not allowed. So maximum is 2, which matches.\n\nAnother example: n=6.\n\nThen S(6)= (6/2)*(6/2 +1) =3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3. floor(n/2)=3. So maximum s is 3. Let's see:\n\ns=3: 2s=6, so sum is 12 >=9 \u2192 yes. So s=3 is okay. s=4 would require m=6 (since 2*4=8>6). The sum is 12 <16 \u2192 no. So yes, 3 is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=7.\n\nS(7) is when m is odd (7 is odd). So S(7)= ( (7+1)/2 )^2 \u2192 (4)^2=16? Wait wait, no. Wait, m=7 is odd, so (m+1)/2 is (7+1)/2=4 \u2192 4 squared is 16. Let me compute manually:\n\nBlocks 1-7:\n\n1,1,2,2,3,3,4 \u2192 sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3+4 = 16. Yes.\n\nSo sqrt(16)=4. So floor(n/2)=3. So maximum s is 4. Let's see:\n\ns=4: 2s=8>7 \u2192 m=7. The sum is 16 which is exactly 4\u00b2 \u2192 yes. So s=4 is allowed. So the maximum is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo the maximum s is the minimum between the floor of sqrt(S(n)) and ... no, actually, the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and floor(sqrt(S(n))). Wait, but in the case of n=7, floor(n/2)=3, and sqrt(S(n)) is 4, so the maximum is 4. So the correct maximum is the floor of sqrt(S(n)), but only if that is possible. Wait, but in the case where S(n) is exactly s squared, then s is allowed.\n\nWait, the maximum s is the largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n). Because when s exceeds that, the sum is insufficient. So the maximum possible s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ). But in the case where floor(n/2) is larger than that, then that would be the maximum. Wait, but in the first case, when s is up to floor(n/2), the sum is s(s+1) which is s\u00b2 + s. So s(s+1) >= s\u00b2 \u2192 always true. So for s up to floor(n/2), the condition holds. So the maximum s can be up to floor(n/2), but if S(n) allows a higher s (i.e., when sqrt(S(n)) is larger than floor(n/2)), then that's better.\n\nWait, let's see for n=7:\n\nfloor(n/2)=3, but sqrt(S(n))=4. So the maximum s is 4, which is higher than floor(n/2). So the maximum s is the minimum between floor(sqrt(S(n))) and ... no, it's the maximum between floor(n/2) and floor(sqrt(S(n)))?\n\nWait, no. Because when s exceeds floor(n/2), then m is n, and the sum is S(n). So the maximum s is the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n). But s can be as large as possible, but also, when s exceeds floor(n/2), the sum is S(n). So the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(S(n)), but only if that is possible. Wait, but in the case where floor(n/2) is less than sqrt(S(n)), then the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))). Because when s is up to floor(n/2), the sum is sufficient, but when s is higher than that, the sum is S(n), so the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and floor(sqrt(S(n))). Wait, no, because when s is between floor(n/2)+1 and floor(sqrt(S(n))), then the sum is S(n) which is sufficient. So the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))), provided that floor(sqrt(S(n))) is greater than or equal to floor(n/2). Otherwise, it's floor(n/2).\n\nWait, let me think of another example. Suppose n=6. S(n)=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. floor(n/2)=3. So the maximum s is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8. S(8)= (8/2)*(8/2 +1) =4*5=20. sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4. floor(n/2)=4. So maximum s is 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=9. S(9)= (9+1)/2 squared \u2192 (5)^2=25. sqrt(25)=5. floor(n/2)=4. So maximum s is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the maximum s is the minimum between floor(sqrt(S(n))) and ... no, it's the maximum between floor(n/2) and floor(sqrt(S(n)))?\n\nWait, no. Because when S(n) is large enough, the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))). But when floor(sqrt(S(n))) is larger than floor(n/2), then that's the maximum. Because when s is up to floor(n/2), the sum is sufficient, but when s is higher, the sum is S(n) which may allow a higher s.\n\nWait, the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(S(n)), but only if that is possible. Because when s exceeds floor(n/2), the sum is S(n). So the maximum s is the minimum between floor(sqrt(S(n))) and ... no, it's the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n). Because when s is up to floor(n/2), the sum is s(s+1) which is s\u00b2 + s \u2265 s\u00b2. So for s up to floor(n/2), the condition holds. So the maximum s can be up to floor(n/2), but if S(n) allows a higher s (i.e., s>floor(n/2) but s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n)), then that's better.\n\nThus, the maximum s is the minimum between floor(sqrt(S(n))) and ... no, the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and floor(sqrt(S(n)))?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nThe maximum possible s is the largest s such that either:\n\n- s \u2264 floor(n/2), in which case the sum is s(s+1) \u2265 s\u00b2 \u2192 always true. So s can be as high as floor(n/2).\n\nOR\n\n- s > floor(n/2), but then the sum is S(n) \u2265 s\u00b2 \u2192 so s can be up to floor( sqrt(S(n)) )\n\nThus, the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), but only if floor( sqrt(S(n)) ) is larger than floor(n/2). Wait, no. Wait, the maximum s is the maximum s where s is the maximum between the two possibilities.\n\nWait, the maximum s is the maximum s such that s is the maximum between the two cases. So the maximum s is the maximum between floor(n/2) and floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), but actually, it's the maximum s where s can be as high as possible. So the maximum s is the minimum between the two? No, no. Let me think of it as:\n\nThe maximum s is the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n) and s can be as large as possible. Because when s is up to floor(n/2), the sum is sufficient (since s(s+1) \u2265 s\u00b2). So the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(S(n)), but only if that is at least floor(n/2). Wait, no. Because when s exceeds floor(n/2), the sum is S(n). So the maximum s is the minimum between floor(sqrt(S(n))) and ... no, the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(S(n)), because that's the largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n). Because even if floor(n/2) is smaller, but the sum S(n) allows a higher s, then that's better.\n\nWait, let's see for n=5:\n\nS(n)=9 \u2192 sqrt(9)=3. floor(n/2)=2. So the maximum s is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6, S(n)=12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3. floor(n/2)=3 \u2192 maximum s is 3.\n\nAnother example: n=7, S(n)=16 \u2192 sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 floor 4. floor(n/2)=3 \u2192 maximum s is 4.\n\nAnother example: n=9, S(n)=25 \u2192 sqrt(25)=5 \u2192 floor 5. floor(n/2)=4 \u2192 maximum s is 5.\n\nAnother example: n=10, S(10)= (10/2)*(10/2 +1) =5*6=30 \u2192 sqrt(30)=5.47 \u2192 floor 5. floor(n/2)=5 \u2192 maximum s is 5.\n\nAnother example: n=11, S(11)= (11+1)/2 squared \u2192 (6)^2=36 \u2192 sqrt(36)=6 \u2192 floor 6. floor(n/2)=5 \u2192 maximum s is 6.\n\nSo in all these cases, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), because when s exceeds floor(n/2), the sum is S(n), so the maximum s is the largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n). So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), because that's the largest s where s squared is less than or equal to the total sum.\n\nWait, but in the case where floor(n/2) is larger than floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), then the maximum s would be floor(n/2). But is that possible?\n\nLet me see. Let's see for n=3:\n\nS(3)=4 \u2192 sqrt(4)=2 \u2192 floor 2. floor(n/2)=1. So maximum s is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4 \u2192 S(4)=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor 2. floor(n/2)=2 \u2192 maximum s is 2.\n\nAnother example: n=2 \u2192 S(2)=2 \u2192 sqrt(2)=1.414 \u2192 floor 1. floor(n/2)=1 \u2192 maximum s is 1.\n\nAnother example: n=1 \u2192 S(1)=1 \u2192 sqrt(1)=1 \u2192 floor 1. floor(n/2)=0 \u2192 maximum s is 1.\n\nHmm, so in all cases, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), because when s is up to floor(n/2), the sum is sufficient, but the maximum possible s is when s is as large as possible, which is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), since that's the largest s where s squared is less than or equal to the total sum.\n\nWait, but let's see a case where floor(n/2) is larger than floor( sqrt(S(n)) ). Let me see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose n=5:\n\nfloor(n/2)=2, floor(sqrt(S(n)))=3 \u2192 3>2 \u2192 so okay.\n\nAnother example: n=6 \u2192 floor(n/2)=3, sqrt(S(n))=sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3 \u2192 same as floor(n/2).\n\nAnother example: n=7 \u2192 floor(n/2)=3, sqrt(S(n))=4 \u2192 4>3.\n\nAnother example: n=8 \u2192 floor(n/2)=4, sqrt(S(n))=sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4 \u2192 same as floor(n/2).\n\nAnother example: n=9 \u2192 floor(n/2)=4, sqrt(S(n))=5 \u2192 5>4.\n\nHmm, so in all cases, floor(sqrt(S(n))) is either equal to or larger than floor(n/2). So the maximum s is always floor( sqrt(S(n)) ).\n\nWait, why is that?\n\nLet me see:\n\nS(n) is the sum up to n blocks. For even n=2k:\n\nS(n)=k*(k+1) \u2192 which is k\u00b2 +k.\n\nThe sqrt(S(n)) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) \u2248k + 0.5. So floor(sqrt(S(n))) is k or k+1?\n\nWait, let's compute for n=2k:\n\nsqrt(k(k+1)) \u2192 let's see for k=2 (n=4):\n\nsqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is equal to k=2.\n\nk=3 (n=6): sqrt(3*4)=sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3 =k.\n\nk=4 (n=8): sqrt(4*5)=sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4 =k.\n\nk=5 (n=10): sqrt(5*6)=sqrt(30)=5.47 \u2192 floor 5=k.\n\nSo for even n=2k, floor(sqrt(S(n))) =k = floor(n/2).\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nS(n)= (k+1)^2 \u2192 sqrt(S(n))=k+1 \u2192 floor is k+1.\n\nfloor(n/2)=k.\n\nSo for odd n=2k+1, floor(sqrt(S(n))) =k+1, which is exactly floor(n/2)+1.\n\nThus, in all cases, floor(sqrt(S(n))) is either equal to floor(n/2) (for even n) or one more (for odd n). So the maximum s is always floor(sqrt(S(n))).\n\nTherefore, the maximum s is the floor of the square root of S(n).\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=5 (odd):\n\nS(5)=9 \u2192 sqrt(9)=3 \u2192 floor 3. Which is correct.\n\nn=7 (odd):\n\nS(7)=16 \u2192 sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 floor 4. Which is correct.\n\nn=3 (odd):\n\nS(3)=4 \u2192 sqrt(4)=2 \u2192 floor 2. Which is correct (since you can form 2x2 square with sum 4).\n\nWait, for n=3, the blocks are 1,1,2. Sum is 4. So s=2 is possible. Which is correct.\n\nSo the maximum s is indeed floor( sqrt(S(n)) ).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing S(n), then taking the integer part of its square root.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n1. Compute S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2).\n\n2. Compute s = floor( sqrt(S(n)) )\n\nThen output s.\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute S(n) efficiently.\n\nAs we derived earlier, S(n) can be computed as:\n\nif n is even:\n\nS(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd:\n\nS(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\nS(n) = ((n +1)/2) * ( (n)/2 +1 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait for even n=2k:\n\nS(n) =k*(k+1) \u2192 (2k/2)*(2k/2 +1) \u2192 yes.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nS(n) = (k+1)^2 \u2192 ( (2k+1 +1)/2 )^2 \u2192 ( (2k+2)/2 )^2 \u2192 (k+1)^2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the formula can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n +1)/2 ) * ( (n)/2 + 1 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, for even n=2k:\n\n(n+1)/2 = (2k+1)/2 \u2192 not integer. Hmm, perhaps better to use integer division.\n\nAlternatively, let me write it as:\n\nLet k = (n +1)/2 when n is odd, and k = n/2 when even.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n +1) // 2 ) * ( (n) // 2 + 1 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\n(n+1)//2 \u2192 (2k+1)/2 \u2192 floor division would be k (since 2k+1 divided by 2 is k.5 \u2192 floor is k).\n\nWait, no. Wait, in integer division, (n+1)//2 for even n=2k is (2k+1)//2 \u2192 which is k (since 2k+1 divided by 2 is k.5 \u2192 floor is k).\n\nWait, but then (n)//2 is k. So (n//2 +1) is k+1. So the product is k*(k+1) \u2192 correct.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\n(n+1)//2 \u2192 (2k+2)/2 =k+1.\n\n(n)//2 \u2192 (2k+1)//2 =k.\n\nSo (k+1)*(k+1) \u2192 (k+1)^2 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes! So the formula can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n +1) // 2 ) * ( (n // 2) + 1 )\n\nThis works for both even and odd n.\n\nSo now, the steps are:\n\nFor a given n:\n\nCompute S(n) = ((n+1)//2) * ( (n//2) +1 )\n\nThen compute s = floor( sqrt(S(n)) )\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the original code has a loop:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nBut in the original code, the loop is while(t-- >0), so the missing part is \"t-- >0\".\n\nThen inside the loop, the code reads n, and then computes the answer.\n\nThe original code had System.out.println( (long)ceil(n/2.0) ), which is incorrect. Because in the example n=5, that would give 2.5 \u2192 ceil is 3, which is correct. Wait, but in the example, the correct answer is 3, which matches. Wait, but according to our analysis, the correct answer is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), which for n=5 is 3. So in this case, ceil(n/2) gives the correct answer. But for n=7, ceil(7/2)=4, which is correct. For n=6, ceil(6/2)=3, which is correct. For n=9, ceil(9/2)=5, which is correct. Wait, so is the original code correct?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, the original code computes (long)ceil(n/2.0). For n=5, that gives 3, which is correct. For n=7, ceil(7/2)=4, which is correct. For n=3, ceil(3/2)=2 \u2192 correct. For n=1, ceil(1/2)=1 \u2192 correct. For n=2, ceil(2/2)=1 \u2192 correct. For n=4, ceil(4/2)=2 \u2192 correct. For n=8, ceil(8/2)=4 \u2192 correct. For n=9, ceil(9/2)=5 \u2192 correct. For n=10, ceil(10/2)=5 \u2192 correct. For n=11, ceil(11/2)=6 \u2192 which is correct (since S(11)=36 \u2192 sqrt(36)=6).\n\nWait, so in all the examples I tried, the original code's output is correct. But according to our analysis, the correct answer is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), which for n=5 is 3, which is the same as ceil(n/2). So why is that?\n\nWait, let's see for n=5:\n\nS(n)=9 \u2192 sqrt(9)=3 \u2192 floor is 3. ceil(5/2)=3 \u2192 same.\n\nn=7: S(n)=16 \u2192 sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 ceil(7/2)=4 \u2192 same.\n\nn=9: S(n)=25 \u2192 sqrt(25)=5 \u2192 ceil(9/2)=5 \u2192 same.\n\nn=6: S(n)=12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3 \u2192 ceil(6/2)=3 \u2192 same.\n\nn=8: S(n)=20 \u2192 sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4 \u2192 ceil(8/2)=4 \u2192 same.\n\nWait, so in all cases, ceil(n/2) equals floor( sqrt(S(n)) ). So the original code is correct?\n\nWait, but why?\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me see for even n=2k:\n\nS(n) =k*(k+1). The sqrt(S(n)) is sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nThe floor of that is k, since k^2 <k(k+1) < (k+0.5)^2 ?\n\nWait, let's see for k=2 (n=4):\n\nsqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)=2.449 \u2192 floor is 2 \u2192 which is k=2. ceil(n/2)=2 \u2192 same.\n\nk=3 (n=6): sqrt(3*4)=sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3 \u2192 same as ceil(6/2)=3.\n\nk=4 (n=8): sqrt(4*5)=sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4 \u2192 same as ceil(8/2)=4.\n\nSo for even n=2k, floor(sqrt(S(n))) =k = ceil(n/2).\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nS(n) = (k+1)^2 \u2192 sqrt(S(n)) =k+1 \u2192 floor is k+1 \u2192 which is ceil( (2k+1)/2 ) =k+1.\n\nThus, in all cases, floor( sqrt(S(n)) ) equals ceil(n/2).\n\nWait, that's the key! So the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2). But how?\n\nWait, because for even n=2k, ceil(n/2)=k, and floor(sqrt(S(n)))=k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1, ceil(n/2)=k+1, and floor(sqrt(S(n)))=k+1.\n\nThus, the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2). So the original code is correct?\n\nWait, but in the problem's first example, when n=5, the answer is 3, which is indeed ceil(5/2)=3. So the original code is correct.\n\nWait, but why did I think there was a problem earlier?\n\nAh, because I thought that when s exceeds floor(n/2), but the sum allows it, but according to the analysis, the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2). So the original code is correct.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause when n is even, the maximum s is exactly n/2, which is ceil(n/2).\n\nWhen n is odd, it's (n+1)/2, which is ceil(n/2).\n\nThus, the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2).\n\nWait, but how does that align with the formula?\n\nBecause S(n) is exactly (ceil(n/2))^2 when n is odd, and for even n, S(n) is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) which is just over (n/2)^2. So the square root of S(n) is just over n/2, so floor is n/2, which is equal to ceil(n/2) when even.\n\nWait, for even n=2k:\n\nsqrt(S(n)) = sqrt(k(k+1)) \u2192 which is between k and k+1. So floor is k, which is exactly n/2 =k. So ceil(n/2) is also k.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nsqrt(S(n)) = sqrt( (k+1)^2 ) =k+1 \u2192 floor is k+1, which is ceil(n/2).\n\nThus, the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2).\n\nWait, so the original code is correct?\n\nBut then why in the problem's first example, the answer is 3, which is exactly ceil(5/2)=3. So the code works.\n\nWait, but then why did I think there was a problem earlier?\n\nAh, because I thought that when s exceeds floor(n/2), but the sum allows it, but in reality, the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2), which is the same as floor(sqrt(S(n))).\n\nThus, the original code is correct. So why was the original code using ceil(n/2.0) ?\n\nWait, the original code's line is:\n\nSystem.out.println( (long)ceil(n/2.0) );\n\nWhich for n=5, gives 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but then why did I think there was a problem?\n\nBecause I thought that the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))), but that is exactly equal to ceil(n/2).\n\nThus, the original code is correct. So the problem is solved by the original code?\n\nWait, but the original code has a loop condition missing. The while loop's condition is missing. The original code has:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nSo the user needs to complete that loop. The loop should run t times, so the condition should be while(t-- >0).\n\nThus, the missing code is \"t-- >0\".\n\nSo the correct code would be:\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport static java.lang.Math.*;\npublic class UltimateSquare {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);\n        long t = scn.nextLong();\n        while(t-- >0){\n            long n = scn.nextLong();\n            System.out.println((long)ceil(n/2.0));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but why does this work?\n\nBecause the maximum s is exactly ceil(n/2). So the code is correct.\n\nBut why did I think there was a more complex solution?\n\nBecause I thought that the maximum s is floor(sqrt(S(n))), but that is exactly equal to ceil(n/2).\n\nThus, the problem is simpler than I thought. The initial code is correct except for the loop condition.\n\nSo the missing code in the while loop is \"t-- >0\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is to replace the while loop condition with \"t-- >0\".\n\nWait, but let me check with another example.\n\nSuppose n=7:\n\nceil(7/2)=4 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nS(n)=16 \u2192 sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother example: n=1:\n\nceil(1/2)=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2 \u2192 ceil(2/2)=1 \u2192 correct (sum is 2 \u2192 s=1).\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nThus, the problem is solved by the original code with the loop condition fixed.\n\nSo the missing code in the while loop is \"t-- >0\".\n\nTherefore, the user needs to replace the while loop's condition with that."
