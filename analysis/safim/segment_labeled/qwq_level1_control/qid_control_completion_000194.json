Let's start by understanding the problem and the code structure.\n\nThe problem is about determining the maximum number of different integer points a dog can visit during its walk, given that some of its movements are unknown (marked as 0) and can be replaced with any integer between -k and k. The dog must end up back at 0 after n minutes. If it's impossible, output -1. Otherwise, the maximum points visited plus 1 (since 0 is always counted) is the answer.\n\nLooking at the code, the first part reads n, k, and the array a. Then, there's a loop where for each a[i], if some condition is met, they set b[i] to 1 and increment s. The condition is missing here. \n\nThe variable s probably counts the number of 0 entries (since those are the unknowns that can be replaced). Because in the code, when a[i] is 0, that's when we can replace it with a value between -k and k. So the condition for setting b[i] to 1 (and adding to s) should be when a[i] is 0. So the missing code in the if statement is \"a[i] == 0\".\n\nWait, let me check. The code initializes sum as the sum of all a[i]. Then, if sum is positive, they invert all a[i] and set sum to -sum. That might be to handle the direction, but I'm not sure yet. \n\nContinuing, after that, there's a check if sum + s*k <0. Wait, sum is the original sum of a[i], but if they flipped the signs when sum was positive, then the actual required adjustment would be different. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, the code first computes the sum of all a[i]. Then, if sum is positive, they set sum to -sum and invert all a[i]. So the idea is to make the total sum negative, so that the unknowns can compensate. Because the total sum after replacing the zeros must be zero. So the original sum plus the sum of the replacements (each 0 can contribute between -k and k) must equal zero. \n\nWait, the total sum after replacement must be zero. Let me think: the original sum is S. The sum of the unknowns (the a_i that are zero) can be adjusted by replacing each with x_i where x_i is between -k and k. The total adjustment is the sum of x_i. So the total sum after replacement is S + (sum of x_i) must equal zero. \n\nTherefore, the sum of x_i must be -S. The question is whether this is possible. The maximum possible sum of x_i is s*k (if all are k), and the minimum is -s*k. So for the required sum (-S) to be achievable, it must be between -s*k and s*k. Wait, no: the required sum of x_i is -S. So the sum of x_i must equal -S. So the total possible adjustment is the sum of x_i, which must be exactly -S. \n\nWait, the original sum S is the sum of all a_i (including the zeros, which are treated as 0). But when replacing the zeros, each a_i that was 0 is replaced by x_i. So the total sum after replacement is (original sum - 0 terms) + sum(x_i) = (original sum) + sum(x_i). This must equal zero. So sum(x_i) = -original sum. \n\nTherefore, the condition for feasibility is that the required sum of x_i (which is -S) must be within the possible range of the sum of x_i. The maximum possible sum of x_i is s*k (if all x_i are k), and the minimum is -s*k.

Let me see:\n\nThe required sum of x_i is -sum. The possible sum of x_i can be between -s*k and s*k.

So the absolute value of the required sum must be \u2264 s*k. \n\nSo the condition for feasibility is |sum| \u2264 s*k. \n\nBut in the code, after possibly flipping the signs (if the original sum was positive), they set sum to -sum (so that sum is now negative?), and then check if sum + s*k <0. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to handle the absolute value. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the original sum is S. The code first checks if S is positive. If so, it inverts all a[i] (so the new S becomes -S), and then the required sum of x_i would be S (since the new S is -S, so required sum is -(-S) = S). \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to make the required sum positive? Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to handle the absolute value by flipping the sign so that the required sum is negative. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the original sum is S. The required sum of x_i is -S. \n\nThe code does:\n\nif (sum >0) { sum = -sum; invert all a[i] }\n\nSo after this, the required sum of x_i is now - (sum after inversion). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think step by step.\n\nOriginal sum is S. The required sum of x_i is -S. \n\nThe code checks if S is positive. If yes, then it inverts all a[i], so the new S becomes -S. Then the required sum of x_i would be - (new S) = S. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to make the required sum positive? Because then, the condition becomes required_sum <= s*k. \n\nWait, the code after flipping the signs, the required sum is now S (since the new sum is -S, so required sum is -(-S) = S). \n\nThen, the code checks if sum + s*k <0. Wait, sum here is the new sum (which is -S if original was positive). \n\nWait, the code's condition after flipping is:\n\nif (sum + s*k <0) \u2192 which would be (-S) + s*k <0 \u2192 s*k < S \u2192 but that's not the correct condition. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's logic here. Let me think again. \n\nThe code's logic after flipping the signs (if sum was positive) is to have the required sum of x_i be S (since the new sum is -S, so required is S). \n\nThe required sum must be between -s*k and s*k. So S must be between -s*k and s*k. \n\nWait, but after flipping, the required sum is S (since the new sum is -S, so required is S). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required sum as sum (the new sum after flipping) and then the required sum is -sum. \n\nWait, maybe I should re-express the code's variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required sum as the absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the required sum as the absolute value of the original sum, and then check if that is <= s*k. \n\nWait, the code's condition after flipping is:\n\nif (sum + s*k <0) \u2192 which would be (sum is the new sum, which is -S if original was positive). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required sum as the absolute value of the original sum. \n\nWait, the code's first part:\n\nsum is the original sum. \n\nIf sum is positive, then they invert all a[i], so the new sum is -sum. \n\nThen, the required sum of x_i is - (new sum) \u2192 which is sum again. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to make the required sum positive. \n\nSo after flipping, the required sum is S (the original sum). \n\nThen, the code checks if sum (the new sum) + s*k <0 \u2192 which would be ( -S + s*k <0 \u2192 s*k < S \u2192 which would mean that the required sum (S) is greater than s*k \u2192 which is impossible. \n\nAh, right! Because the required sum is S (the original sum), and the maximum possible sum of x_i is s*k. So if S > s*k \u2192 then it's impossible. \n\nSo the code's condition is checking whether the required sum (S) is greater than s*k \u2192 which would be impossible. \n\nWait, the code's condition is sum + s*k <0 \u2192 but sum here is the new sum (which is -S if original was positive). \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose original sum S is positive. \n\nThen, after flipping, the new sum is -S. \n\nThe required sum of x_i is - (new sum) \u2192 which is S. \n\nThe maximum possible sum of x_i is s*k. \n\nSo the required sum S must be \u2264 s*k. \n\nThe code's condition is: if (sum + s*k <0) \u2192 sum is -S, so -S + s*k <0 \u2192 s*k < S \u2192 which is exactly the case when the required sum S exceeds s*k \u2192 so it's impossible. \n\nTherefore, the code is correctly checking for that case. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct here. \n\nNow, back to the first part. The code loops through the a[i], and for each a[i], if it is zero, then b[i] is set to 1 and s is incremented. \n\nSo the missing condition in the first loop is \"if a[i] == 0\".\n\nSo the first missing code is \"a[i] == 0\".\n\nNow, moving on to the rest of the code. \n\nThe code then proceeds to compute some variables. \n\nThe next part is the loops for i and j, and calculates pi and px. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum possible number of distinct points visited. \n\nThe approach here might be to model the possible ranges of the dog's position at each step, considering the possible replacements of the 0s. \n\nThe variables pi and px might represent some ranges, and the code is trying to compute the maximum distance from zero, which would contribute to the number of points. \n\nThe final answer is ans +1, so ans is the maximum distance from zero, and adding 1 gives the number of points (since from -d to +d, there are 2d+1 points, but maybe the code is tracking the maximum absolute value, so the total points would be ans*2 +1? Or perhaps the code is considering the path's maximum extent, so the total points is the maximum distance plus 1 (since 0 is counted). Wait, the problem says the number of different integer points visited. So the maximum number of points would be the maximum distance from zero in either direction plus the points in between. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be tracking the maximum absolute position reached, and the total points would be that maximum plus 1 (since from 0 to max, it's max+1 points, but if it goes negative, it's more). Wait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum possible span, so the total points would be the maximum distance from zero in either direction, summed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the maximum possible distance from zero at any point, and then the total points would be that maximum plus 1 (since 0 is included). \n\nAlternatively, the code's ans is the maximum absolute position reached, so the total points would be ans*2 +1 (if it goes to both sides), but maybe the code is considering the maximum in one direction. \n\nBut the code's final output is ans+1, so the ans must be the maximum distance from zero. \n\nThe loops for i and j are trying to compute some ranges. \n\nThe variables pi and px are computed in two different ways, and the code takes the minimum of their absolute values and compares to ans. \n\nThis part is a bit unclear. \n\nBut the main point here is that the first missing code is the condition in the first loop. \n\nSo the answer to the problem is to fill in the condition as \"a[i] == 0\".\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif (a[i] == 0)\n\nSo the code line would be:\n\nif(a[i]==0)\n\nSo the user should output that line as the missing code."
