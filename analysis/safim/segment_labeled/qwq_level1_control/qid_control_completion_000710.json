Wait, the code as written doesn't read the t value yet. Oh right, the current code starts with 'for' but nothing else. So the first step is to read t, then loop t times. Looking at the existing code: the current code's structure is:\n\nfor # TODO...\n    r = int(input())\n    print(...) So the loop needs to handle each test case. The missing part is the loop header. The standard way would be to read t first, then loop for _ in range(t):. Because the loop variable isn't used inside, so using _ is common. So the first line after the code starts would be:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n\nThat's probably the missing part. Let me check the existing code again. The user's code has the for loop's head as a TODO. So inserting that for loop correctly. Now, the print statement uses '4 - sum(r >= p for p in (1400, 1600, 1900))'. Let me see if that logic works. Let's think about how the sum works. The sum counts how many of the thresholds the rating is >= to. Let me test with some examples. Take the note's examples:\n\nTest case with 1400 (division 3). Let's see:\n\nCheck the list (1400,1600,1900). r >=1400 \u2192 yes (1), r >=1600 \u2192 no (0), r >=1900 \u2192 no (0). Sum is 1. 4 -1 =3 \u2192 division 3. Correct. Another example: 1679 (division 2). \n\n1679 >=1400 \u2192 yes, 1679 >=1600 \u2192 yes (sum now 2), 1679 >=1900 \u2192 no. Sum is 2. 4-2=2 \u2192 division 2. Correct. For 2300 (division1): 2300 >=1400 (1), 1600 (1), 1900 (yes, 2300 >=1900 \u2192 1). Sum is 3. 4-3=1 \u2192 correct. For a rating of 1399 (division4): \n\nCheck each p:\n\n1399 >=1400? No. So all three are 0. Sum is 0 \u2192 4-0=4 \u2192 correct. What about 1899 (division2)? \n\n1899 >=1400 (yes), 1600 (yes), 1900 (no). Sum is 2 \u2192 4-2=2. Correct. What about 1599 (division3): sum would be 1 (only 1400), so 4-1=3. Correct. So the logic in the print statement seems correct. Therefore, the only missing part is the loop.",
