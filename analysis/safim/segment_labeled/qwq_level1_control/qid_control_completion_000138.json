Let me think of the problem from another angle. Suppose we want to move all robots in such a way that at least one reaches (0,0). Let's think of the minimal steps required for a robot to reach (0,0). Let's say robot R is at (r, c). To reach (0,0), it needs to move up r times and left c times. The order of these moves can be in any order, but each move must be a direction that all robots can take. So, for each of those moves (up and left), the direction must be such that all robots can move in that direction. Let me think of the constraints for other robots. For example, when moving left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So, for robot R to move left, all other robots must also be in columns >=1. Similarly, when moving up, all must be in rows >=1.

So, before any up move, all robots must be in rows >=1. But after each up move, their rows decrease by 1. So, for example, if there's another robot in row 0, then you can't move up at all. So, if any robot is in row 0 except R, then R can't move up unless that robot is already in (0,0). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nThe answer is \"YES\" if and only if there exists a robot such that:\n\n- The robot's column is <= its starting column (obviously, since moving left reduces column).",

But if all other robots have rows >= r, then when R is at row r, the other robots are at rows >= r. So when you move up once, all robots' rows decrease by 1. So after that, R is at r-1, and others are at rows >= r-1. Continuing this way, after r moves up, R will be at 0, and others will be at rows >=0. But since rows can't be negative, that's okay. Similarly for the left moves. Therefore, the conditions are sufficient. Additionally, if any robot is already at (0,0), then the answer is yes. So the algorithm should be: For each test case:\n\n- Check if any robot is at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n- Else, for each robot R:\n\n   - Check if all other robots have columns >= R's column and rows >= R's row.\n\n   - If any such R exists, output YES.\n\n- If none found, output NO. This seems manageable. Now, how to implement this in the given code. Looking at the current code: The code has two loops.",

Wait, but the code's first loop is:\n\nfor(int i =0 ; i < n; i++){\n\n    String temp = sc.next() ; \n\n    for(int j =0 ; j < m ; j++){\n\n        arr[i][j] = temp.charAt(j) ; \n\n        if( /* condition */ ){\n\n            b1 = true ; row1 = i ; \n\n            col1 = j ; \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe variables b1, row1, col1 are initialized to false and 0.

So for R to be a candidate, all other robots must have c' >= c and r' >= r. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid. 2. Collect all robot positions into a list. 3. If any robot is at (0,0), return YES.\n\n4. Else, for each robot R in the list:\n\n   a. Check if all other robots have c' >= R's column and r' >= R's row. b. If yes, return YES.\n\n5. If none found, return NO. Now, implementing this in the given code. The current code's structure is: In the main loop for each test case:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the grid into arr.\n\n- Then, some code with variables b1, row1, col1, and then b2, row2, col2.\n\n- Then, check if col1 != col2 \u2192 output No else Yes. This is incorrect. We need to replace this with the correct logic. So, the plan is to:\n\n- Iterate through the grid to collect all robot positions.\n\n- Check if any is at (0,0). - If yes, print YES.\n\n- Else, for each robot R in the list:\n\n   - Check for all other robots whether their column is >= R's column and row >= R's row.\n\n   - If all do, then return YES.\n\n- If none found, return NO. So, modifying the code: First, in the code, after reading the grid, we can collect all robot positions into a list.

So perhaps:\n\nboolean hasZeroZero = false;\n\nfor (int[] pos : robots) {\n\n    if (pos[0]==0 && pos[1]==0) {\n\n        hasZeroZero = true;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (hasZeroZero) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n    continue; // to next test case\n\n}\n\nThen, proceed to check other robots. Else, for each robot R in robots:\n\n   boolean valid = true;\n\n   for (int[] other : robots) {\n\n       if (other == R) continue; // skip itself\n\n       if (other[1] < R[1] || other[0] < R[0]) {\n\n           valid = false;\n\n           break;\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n   if (valid) {\n\n       System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n       flag = true;\n\n       break;\n\n   }\n\nIf any such R is found, output YES, else NO.

  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code so that it correctly solves the problem. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe problem is about robots on a grid. The goal is to determine if we can move at least one robot to the upper left corner (which is position (0,0) I assume) without any robot exploding. The robots move all at the same time with each command. If any robot moves outside the grid, it explodes, which we need to avoid.\n\nThe input gives the grid layout with 'E's and 'R's. The code provided is a Java program that reads the test cases and some variables, but the key parts are missing. The current code has some loops to check rows and columns, but the logic isn't correct yet.\n\nLooking at the code structure:\n\nIn the main loop for each test case, after reading the grid, there are two boolean variables b1 and b2, and some row and column variables. The first loop (for i from 0 to n-1) is processing each row. Inside, for each cell, if the cell is an 'R', they set b1 to true and record row1 and col1. Wait, but the condition is missing here. The TODO says to check if the cell is a robot, right? So the condition should be if (arr[i][j] == 'R'). But then, why are they setting b1 and row1/col1? Maybe this is trying to track the first robot's position? Or perhaps the position of some specific robot?\n\nWait, looking further, after that first loop, there's another loop that's iterating over columns first, then rows. The second loop is for i from 0 to m (columns), then j from 0 to n (rows?), but the variables are a bit confusing. The code for the second loop is:\n\nfor(int i =0 ; i< m ; i++){\n    for(int j =0 ; j < n ; j++){\n        if(!b2 && arr[j][i]=='R'){\n            b2 = true ; \n            row2 = j ; \n            col2 = i ; \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nHmm, here, the outer loop is over columns (i from 0 to m-1), and the inner loop is over rows (j from 0 to n-1). So for each column i, it's checking each row j in that column. The first 'R' found in that column (since it's checking rows from top to bottom) will set b2 to true and record row2 and col2. So row2 is the first row (smallest row number) in column i where there's an R. Wait, no, because for each column i, it starts from j=0 (the first row) upwards? Wait, j starts at 0, so for each column i, it's checking rows from top to bottom. So the first R encountered in column i (the topmost R in that column) is stored in row2 and col2. But since the loop is for each column, the first column (i=0) is processed first, so the first R in column 0 (the leftmost column) would be the first one found. Wait, but the loop is over all columns. Wait, the code is trying to find the first R in each column, but perhaps the variables are tracking the first R in the first column? Not sure.\n\nWait, the code's logic after that is checking if col1 != col2, then output \"No\", else \"Yes\". So the current code's logic is that if the column of the first robot (from the first loop) is different from the column of some other robot (from the second loop), then output No. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to understand what the original code is trying to do here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost robot's column and the topmost robot's row? Or maybe the code is trying to find the leftmost column where a robot exists, and the topmost row in that column?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost robot's column and the top robot in that column. But I'm not sure. The current code's logic is flawed, so I need to think of the correct approach.\n\nThe problem requires that after some sequence of moves, at least one robot reaches (0,0), and no robot ever steps outside the grid during any move.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the conditions required for this to be possible.\n\nFirst, the robot must be able to reach (0,0) without any robot moving out of bounds in any step. Since all robots move simultaneously each time, their paths must be such that in every step, none of them go out of the grid.\n\nLet me think of the possible scenarios. For a robot to reach (0,0), it must be able to move there through a series of commands. But all other robots must also not move out of the grid during those steps.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of commands. So perhaps the key is to find a direction sequence where, after some steps, at least one robot is at (0,0), and in all steps leading up to that, all robots stay within the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: there exists a set of moves such that after those moves, one robot is at (0,0), and during all those moves, no robot ever steps outside the grid.\n\nHmm. Let me think of the constraints required for this to be possible.\n\nFirst, the robot that reaches (0,0) must be able to get there without any of its own moves causing it to go out of bounds. But also, all other robots must not go out of bounds in any of the steps taken.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the positions of all robots and see if there exists a direction sequence where, after moving, at least one robot is at (0,0), and all robots are still within the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the relative positions of the robots. Let me think of the necessary conditions.\n\nLet me think of the upper left corner as (0,0). For a robot to reach there, it must be able to move left and/or up enough times, but without any robot moving out of the grid in any step.\n\nWait, but all robots move at the same time. So, for example, if a robot is at (1,1), and you command left, it moves to (1,0). But another robot at (0,0) would stay there. But if a robot is at (0,0), then it's already there, so that's a yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the positions of all robots and see if there exists a direction such that when moving in that direction, all robots can reach their positions without going out of bounds, and at least one can reach (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the minimal required steps for each robot to reach (0,0) and ensuring that during those steps, none of them go out of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be simplified by considering that for a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible to move it there through a series of moves where, in each step, all robots move in a direction that doesn't push any of them out of the grid.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to look at the positions of all robots and see if there exists a direction sequence where, after some steps, one robot is at (0,0), and in all steps, all robots stay within the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: there exists a set of moves (each move is a direction) such that after applying all those moves, at least one robot is at (0,0), and during each move, every robot's movement is within the grid.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered by looking at the positions of all robots and seeing if there exists a way to \"align\" their paths so that one can reach (0,0) without any of them stepping out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the constraints on the robots' positions. Let me think of the following:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible to move it there through some combination of left and up moves. However, all other robots must not be moved in a way that causes them to go out of the grid during any of the steps.\n\nWait, but all robots move simultaneously each time. So, for example, if you choose to move left, all robots move left. So, for all robots, their current column must be at least 1 (so that moving left doesn't take them to column -1). Similarly, moving up requires that their row is at least 1, etc.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires that there exists a sequence of directions such that:\n\n1. After applying all the directions in sequence, at least one robot is at (0,0).\n\n2. For every direction in the sequence, when all robots move in that direction, none of them go out of the grid.\n\nSo, the key is to find a path of directions where each step is valid (no robot moves out), and after some steps, one robot is at (0,0).\n\nHmm. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered by looking at the possible positions of robots after each possible move, but since the grid is small (n and m up to 5), maybe a BFS approach is feasible. However, given that the constraints are up to 5000 test cases, perhaps a smarter approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or condition that can be checked without simulating all possibilities.\n\nLet me think of the necessary conditions for the answer to be \"YES\".\n\nFirst, if any robot is already at (0,0), then the answer is YES.\n\nOtherwise, for a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible to move it there through some combination of left and up moves, but in such a way that all other robots can also move without going out of the grid in each step.\n\nWait, but all robots move in the same direction each time. So, for example, if a robot is at (2,3), and another is at (1,0), then moving left would cause the second robot to go to column -1, which is invalid. So that direction can't be chosen.\n\nHmm. So the direction chosen must be such that all robots can move in that direction without going out of the grid. So each move must be a direction where all robots are in a position that allows them to move in that direction.\n\nTherefore, for each possible direction, we can check if all robots can move in that direction (i.e., for direction left, all robots are in columns >=1; for up, rows >=1, etc). Then, after moving in that direction, we can proceed recursively or iteratively.\n\nBut since the problem allows any number of commands, perhaps the key is to find a direction sequence where, after some steps, one robot is at (0,0), and each step's direction is valid (all robots can move in that direction without exploding).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: there exists a set of directions (each direction is a command) such that:\n\n- The sequence of directions leads at least one robot to (0,0).\n\n- For each direction in the sequence, all robots can move in that direction (i.e., their current positions allow it).\n\nMoreover, the order of directions can be any, but each step must be valid.\n\nHmm. Let me think of possible scenarios.\n\nSuppose all robots are in the first column (column 0). Then, moving left is impossible (since that would take them to -1). So, to move up, their rows must be >=1. So, if any robot is in row 0, column 0, then it's already there. Otherwise, if all are in column 0 but rows >=1, then moving up would be possible. But to reach (0,0), a robot must be in row 1, column 0, then move up. But if there are other robots in higher rows, they can also move up.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that at least one robot reaches (0,0). So, for example, if there's a robot at (1,0), then moving up once would take it to (0,0). But if there are other robots in (2,0), then moving up is allowed (since their rows are >=1). So that's okay.\n\nSo in that case, the answer would be yes.\n\nAnother example: suppose a robot is at (0,1). To get to (0,0), you can move left once. But all other robots must not be in a position that would cause them to move left and go out. So, for example, if another robot is at (0,0), then moving left would take that robot to -1, which is invalid. Wait, no, the robot at (0,0) can't move left, so that direction can't be chosen. So in that case, if there's a robot at (0,1) and another at (0,0), then moving left would cause the (0,0) robot to go out. So that direction is invalid. So you can't choose left. So the robot at (0,1) can't reach (0,0) in that case.\n\nHmm. So the problem requires that there exists a path of directions where each step is valid (all robots can move in that direction), and after some steps, one robot is at (0,0).\n\nNow, how can we model this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps the key is to find for each robot whether there exists a path of directions that allows it to reach (0,0) without any step causing any robot to explode.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the constraints on the robots' positions.\n\nLet me think of the following conditions:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible to move it there through a series of moves where each move is in a direction that all robots can take.\n\nLet me think of the robot's path. Suppose the robot is at (r, c). To reach (0,0), it needs to move up (r times) and left (c times). But the order of these moves must be such that all other robots can also move in those directions without going out of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must not be in a position that would block the path in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering the minimal required steps for each robot and seeing if there's a way to choose directions so that one robot can reach (0,0) while others don't get blocked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by checking for each robot whether it can reach (0,0) under the constraints that all other robots can also move in the required directions.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the sample inputs given in the problem's notes.\n\nSample 1: The first test case's solution is to move left. So perhaps the robot is in (0,1). Moving left takes it to (0,0). Since there are no other robots, that's okay.\n\nSample 2: Trying any command causes at least one robot to explode. So maybe the robots are in positions where any direction would cause some to go out. For example, if a robot is at (0,0), but others are in positions that can't move in any direction. Wait, but the problem says in the second test case, any command causes a robot to explode. So perhaps all robots are on the edge, so any direction would push some out. Like, if all robots are in the first row and first column, but in such a way that moving left or up would push some out.\n\nSample 3: Moving left works. So similar to sample 1.\n\nSample 4: Already has a robot in (0,0), so output yes.\n\nSample 5: The sequence \"move up, move left, move up\" leads a robot to (0,0). Let me see: suppose a robot starts at (2,1). Moving up would take it to (1,1). Then left to (1,0). Then up again to (0,0). But during each step, all other robots must also be able to move in those directions. So in each step, the direction must be valid for all robots.\n\nHmm. So the problem requires that for each step in the sequence, the direction chosen must be such that all robots can move in that direction (i.e., their current positions allow it).\n\nNow, the question is, how can we model this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps the key is to find that for some direction sequence, after applying those directions, one robot is at (0,0), and each direction in the sequence is valid (all robots can move in that direction).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: there exists a set of directions (each direction is a command) such that:\n\n- The cumulative effect of these directions moves at least one robot to (0,0).\n\n- For each direction in the sequence, when applied, all robots are in positions that allow them to move in that direction (i.e., moving in that direction doesn't take them out of the grid).\n\nNow, considering that the grid is small (n and m up to 5), perhaps we can model this with BFS, but given the constraints of 5000 test cases, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern that can be checked without simulation.\n\nLet me think of the necessary conditions for the answer to be \"YES\".\n\nFirst, there must be at least one robot that can reach (0,0) through some combination of moves, and during each step of those moves, all robots can move in the chosen direction.\n\nLet me think of the robot that can reach (0,0). Let's call this robot R. For R to reach (0,0), it must have a path where each step's direction allows all robots to move.\n\nSuppose R is at (r, c). To get to (0,0), it needs to move up r times and left c times. The order of these moves can vary, but each step must be a direction that all robots can take.\n\nSo, for each step in the path, the direction must be such that all robots can move in that direction.\n\nLet me think of the constraints for other robots. For example, if another robot is at (a, b), then during any move to the left, that robot must have b >=1. Similarly for other directions.\n\nHmm. So for the robot R to reach (0,0), all other robots must not be in positions that would block the required directions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must be able to \"follow\" the path without getting stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by checking for each robot whether it can reach (0,0) under the condition that all other robots can also move in the required directions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The robot's starting position (r, c) must satisfy that it can reach (0,0) by moving left and up, and during each step of that path, all other robots can also move in the direction chosen.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following must hold for at least one robot:\n\n- The robot is already at (0,0): then answer is yes.\n\nElse:\n\n- The robot can reach (0,0) by moving left and up, and for all other robots, their positions allow them to move in those directions without going out of the grid during each step of the path.\n\nWait, but the path can be any sequence of directions, not necessarily all left and up. For example, maybe moving up first, then left, etc.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too vague. Let me think of the problem from another angle.\n\nSuppose we want to move all robots in such a way that at least one reaches (0,0). Let's think of the minimal steps required for a robot to reach (0,0). Let's say robot R is at (r, c). To reach (0,0), it needs to move up r times and left c times. The order of these moves can be in any order, but each move must be a direction that all robots can take.\n\nSo, for each of those moves (up and left), the direction must be such that all robots can move in that direction.\n\nLet me think of the constraints for other robots. For example, when moving left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So, for robot R to move left, all other robots must also be in columns >=1. Similarly, when moving up, all must be in rows >=1.\n\nTherefore, for robot R to reach (0,0), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot R's row r must be >=0 (obviously).\n\n- The robot R's column c must be >=0.\n\n- To move up r times, during each of those up moves, all robots must be in rows >=1. So, before any up move, all robots must be in rows >=1. But after each up move, their rows decrease by 1. So, for example, if there's another robot in row 0, then you can't move up at all. So, if any robot is in row 0 except R, then R can't move up unless that robot is already in (0,0).\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nThe answer is \"YES\" if and only if there exists a robot such that:\n\n- The robot's column is <= its starting column (obviously, since moving left reduces column).\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must not be in a position that would block the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. There exists at least one robot in column 0 (the first column). Because otherwise, moving left won't get any robot to column 0. Wait, but if a robot is in column 1, you can move left once to get to column 0. But to do that, all robots must be in columns >=1 at that step.\n\nWait, so for a robot to reach column 0, there must be a time when you can move left, and that robot is in column 1, but all other robots are also in columns >=1. So, the robot can move left, but others can also move left (if they are in columns >=1).\n\nHmm. So, the robot must be able to reach column 0 through some sequence of left moves, but during each left move, all robots are in columns >=1.\n\nSimilarly, to reach row 0, the robot must be able to move up through some steps where all robots are in rows >=1 during each up move.\n\nSo, for a robot to reach (0,0), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot's starting column c must be >=0 (obviously).\n\n- There must be a way to move left c times, such that during each left move, all robots are in columns >=1. So, before each left move, all robots are in columns >=1. After each left move, their columns decrease by 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the rows: the robot's starting row r must be >=0, and there must be a way to move up r times, such that during each up move, all robots are in rows >=1.\n\nWait, but the order of moves can be interleaved. For example, you can move up first, then left, etc. So the moves don't have to be all lefts first then ups, or vice versa.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of the necessary conditions for a robot R at (r, c) to be able to reach (0,0):\n\n- The robot must be able to move left c times, and during each of those left moves, all robots are in columns >=1.\n\n- The robot must be able to move up r times, and during each of those up moves, all robots are in rows >=1.\n\nBut the moves can be in any order. So perhaps the following must hold:\n\nFor the robot to reach (0,0), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot's column c must be such that there exists a path of left moves (possibly interleaved with other moves) where each left move is allowed (all robots in columns >=1 at that time).\n\nSimilarly for the rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions must be met:\n\nAll robots must be able to move in such a way that:\n\n- For the robot to reach (0,0), the robot's column must be >=0, and there must be a way to move left c times, with all robots in columns >=1 during each of those steps.\n\nSimilarly, the robot's row must be >=0, and there must be a way to move up r times, with all robots in rows >=1 during each of those steps.\n\nBut how do we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must not be in a position that would block the path. For example, if another robot is in a column less than the current column of R, then moving left might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following is a necessary and sufficient condition:\n\nThe robot R can reach (0,0) if and only if:\n\n- The robot's column is >=0 (obviously).\n\n- The minimal column among all robots is <= R's column. Because otherwise, there's a robot to the left of R, so moving left would require that robot to also move left, but if that robot is already in a column less than R's current column, then when R moves left, that robot would have to move left as well, but if that robot is already in column 0, then moving left would explode it.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for any robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must be able to \"follow\" the path without getting stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following must be true for at least one robot R:\n\n- The robot R's column is <= the minimal column of all robots. Because otherwise, there exists another robot to the left of R, so moving left would require that robot to also move left, but if that robot is already in column 0, then moving left would cause it to explode.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me think:\n\nSuppose there is a robot R at (r, c). To move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So, if there is another robot in column 0, then you can't move left at all. So, for R to reach column 0, there must be no robot in a column less than R's current column. Because otherwise, that robot would be in a column less than R's, so when you try to move left, that robot would be in column 0, and moving left would take it to -1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, so for R to be able to move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So, if there is any robot in column 0, then you can't move left at all. Therefore, if any robot is in column 0, then you can't move left, so the only way to have a robot reach (0,0) is if that robot is already in (0,0), or if there's a robot in row 0, column 1, and you can move up (but then you can't move left to get to column 0).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit clearer.\n\nLet me think of the following conditions:\n\nFor there to exist a way to get a robot to (0,0):\n\nEither:\n\n1. There is already a robot at (0,0). Then answer is YES.\n\nElse:\n\n2. There must exist a robot R such that:\n\n   a. R's column is 0. Because otherwise, you can't move left to get to column 0 (since if there's a robot in column 0, you can't move left at all).\n\n   Wait, no. If R is in column 1, but there are no robots in column 0, then you can move left once to get to column 0. But to do that, all robots must be in columns >=1. So if there are no robots in column 0, then moving left is possible.\n\nAh, right. So the key is that for R to reach column 0, there must be no robots in columns less than R's current column. Because otherwise, those robots would be in columns less than R's, so when you move left, they would have to move left as well, but if they are in column 0, then moving left would explode them.\n\nWait, so for R to be able to move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So, if there are any robots in column 0, then you can't move left at all. Therefore, if there are any robots in column 0 (other than the target (0,0)), then you can't move left, so the only way to get to (0,0) is if a robot is already there, or can reach via up moves but in column 0.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to formalize the conditions.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nTo have at least one robot reach (0,0), the following must be true:\n\nEither:\n\n- There is already a robot at (0,0).\n\nOR\n\n- There exists a robot R such that:\n\n   a. R can reach (0,0) through some sequence of moves, and during each move in that sequence, all robots can move in the chosen direction.\n\nTo find this, perhaps the following conditions must be met:\n\nFor R to reach (0,0):\n\n- The robot R's column c must be such that there are no robots in any column less than c. Because otherwise, those robots would be in columns < c, so when moving left, they would have to move left, but if they are in column 0, then moving left would explode them. Wait, but if there are robots in columns between 0 and c, then moving left would require them to also move left, but as long as they are in columns >=1, it's okay.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for R to move left c times (to get to column 0), all other robots must also be able to move left c times without going out of the grid. So, for each other robot, their column must be >= c. Because otherwise, if another robot has column < c, then after moving left (c - (their column)) times, they would reach column 0, but then further left moves would take them out.\n\nWait, perhaps the following must be true for R to reach column 0:\n\nAll other robots must have columns >= R's column. Because otherwise, there exists a robot with column < R's column. Let's say another robot has column k < R's column c. Then, to move R to column 0, you need to move left c times. But during the first (c - k) moves, the other robot would move to column 0, and then further left moves would take it to negative columns, which is invalid. So those moves can't be done. Therefore, to move R to column 0, all other robots must have columns >= R's column. So that when you move left c times, all robots' columns decrease by c, so their new columns are (original column - c). To ensure that this doesn't go below 0, their original columns must be >= c.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Let me formalize this:\n\nSuppose R is at column c. To move left c times, each of those moves must be valid. For each move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So, after each move, their columns decrease by 1. So, after the first move, their columns are (original column -1). After the second move, (original column -2), etc. After c moves, their columns are (original column - c). To ensure that during all these moves, the columns are >=1 before each move, the original columns must be >= (current move step + 1). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal column among all robots must be >= R's column. Because if any robot has a column less than R's column, then when you try to move left R's column times, that robot would have to move to column (original column - c), which would be negative if original column < c. So that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, for R to be able to move left to column 0, all other robots must have columns >= R's column. \n\nSimilarly, for the rows: to move up R's row r times, all other robots must have rows >= R's row. Because otherwise, a robot with row less than R's row would, after moving up R's row times, end up with row (original row - r), which could be negative.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose R is at row r. To move up r times, each move must be valid (all robots in rows >=1). So after each move, their rows decrease by 1. After r moves, their rows are (original row - r). To ensure that during each move, the rows are >=1 before the move, the original rows must be >= (current move step + 1). \n\nWait, for the first move (step 1), all robots must be in rows >=1. After that, their rows are (original row -1). For the second move, they must be in rows >=1 again, so original row -1 >=1 \u2192 original row >=2. And so on, until after r moves, the original rows must be >= r. \n\nTherefore, for R to move up r times, all other robots must have rows >= r. \n\nSo combining both conditions for R to reach (0,0):\n\n- The robot R's column c must be such that all other robots have columns >= c.\n\n- The robot R's row r must be such that all other robots have rows >= r.\n\nAdditionally, R must be able to reach (0,0) by moving left c times and up r times. \n\nWait, but the moves can be in any order. So the order of moving up and left doesn't matter as long as the total number of up moves is r and left moves is c, and each move is valid.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\nFor some robot R at (r, c):\n\n1. All other robots have columns >= c.\n\n2. All other robots have rows >= r.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then R can reach (0,0) by moving left c times and up r times, in any order, as long as each move is valid. \n\nWait, but the moves must be done in such a way that each move is valid. For example, moving up first requires that all robots are in rows >=1. \n\nBut if all other robots have rows >= r, then when R is at row r, the other robots are at rows >= r. So when you move up once, all robots' rows decrease by 1. So after that, R is at r-1, and others are at rows >= r-1. \n\nContinuing this way, after r moves up, R will be at 0, and others will be at rows >=0. But since rows can't be negative, that's okay. \n\nSimilarly for the left moves. \n\nTherefore, the conditions are sufficient. \n\nAdditionally, if any robot is already at (0,0), then the answer is yes.\n\nSo the algorithm should be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Check if any robot is at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n- Else, for each robot R:\n\n   - Check if all other robots have columns >= R's column and rows >= R's row.\n\n   - If any such R exists, output YES.\n\n- If none found, output NO.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code.\n\nLooking at the current code:\n\nThe code has two loops. The first loop is going through each row and column, and for each 'R', it sets b1 to true and records row1 and col1. But the condition is missing. The TODO is to check if the cell is 'R'. So the condition should be if (arr[i][j] == 'R').\n\nWait, but the code's first loop is:\n\nfor(int i =0 ; i < n; i++){\n\n    String temp = sc.next() ; \n\n    for(int j =0 ; j < m ; j++){\n\n        arr[i][j] = temp.charAt(j) ; \n\n        if( /* condition */ ){\n\n            b1 = true ; \n\n            row1 = i ; \n\n            col1 = j ; \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe variables b1, row1, col1 are initialized to false and 0. So this loop is probably trying to find the first robot encountered, but the code is incomplete. \n\nThe second loop is:\n\nfor(int i =0 ; i< m ; i++){\n\n    for(int j =0 ; j < n ; j++){\n\n        if(!b2 && arr[j][i] == 'R'){\n\n            b2 = true ; \n\n            row2 = j ; \n\n            col2 = i ; \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis loop is iterating over columns first (i from 0 to m-1), then for each column, iterating over rows (j from 0 to n-1). So for each column i, it's checking each row j in that column. The first 'R' found in that column (starting from the top row) will set b2 to true and record row2 and col2. So for column 0, it will find the first R in that column (the topmost one). Then for column 1, etc. But since the loop is over all columns, the first column (i=0) is processed first, so the first R in column 0 (if any) will be the first to set b2. \n\nThe code then checks if col1 != col2, then outputs \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\nThis current logic is incorrect. The code's current approach is probably trying to find the first robot in the first column (col2 would be 0 if there's a robot in column 0), and compare it with the first robot's column (col1). But this doesn't align with the correct conditions we derived.\n\nSo the correct approach is to:\n\nCheck for any robot at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\nElse, for each robot R:\n\n   Check if all other robots have columns >= R's column and rows >= R's row.\n\n   If any such R exists, output YES.\n\nElse, output NO.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nFirst, we need to collect all the positions of the robots.\n\nThen, for each robot R (r, c):\n\n   Check for all other robots (r', c'):\n\n      if (c' < c) \u2192 then this robot is to the left of R \u2192 so R can't move left to 0 because this robot would have to move left and eventually explode.\n\n      if (r' < r) \u2192 similarly, this robot is above R \u2192 can't move up r times.\n\nSo for R to be a candidate, all other robots must have c' >= c and r' >= r.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Collect all robot positions into a list.\n\n3. If any robot is at (0,0), return YES.\n\n4. Else, for each robot R in the list:\n\n   a. Check if all other robots have c' >= R's column and r' >= R's row.\n\n   b. If yes, return YES.\n\n5. If none found, return NO.\n\nNow, implementing this in the given code.\n\nThe current code's structure is:\n\nIn the main loop for each test case:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the grid into arr.\n\n- Then, some code with variables b1, row1, col1, and then b2, row2, col2.\n\n- Then, check if col1 != col2 \u2192 output No else Yes.\n\nThis is incorrect. We need to replace this with the correct logic.\n\nSo, the plan is to:\n\n- Iterate through the grid to collect all robot positions.\n\n- Check if any is at (0,0).\n\n- If yes, print YES.\n\n- Else, for each robot R in the list:\n\n   - Check for all other robots whether their column is >= R's column and row >= R's row.\n\n   - If all do, then return YES.\n\n- If none found, return NO.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nFirst, in the code, after reading the grid, we can collect all robot positions into a list.\n\nLet me see:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint m = sc.nextInt();\n\nchar[][] arr = new char[n][m];\n\nList<int[]> robots = new ArrayList<>();\n\nfor (int i =0; i <n; i++){\n\n    String temp = sc.next();\n\n    for (int j=0; j<m; j++){\n\n        arr[i][j] = temp.charAt(j);\n\n        if (arr[i][j] == 'R') {\n\n            robots.add(new int[]{i,j});\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, check if any robot is at (0,0):\n\nfor (int[] pos : robots) {\n\n    if (pos[0]==0 && pos[1]==0) {\n\n        System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n        // proceed to next test case\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but need to break early. So perhaps:\n\nboolean hasZeroZero = false;\n\nfor (int[] pos : robots) {\n\n    if (pos[0]==0 && pos[1]==0) {\n\n        hasZeroZero = true;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (hasZeroZero) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n    continue; // to next test case\n\n}\n\nThen, proceed to check other robots.\n\nElse, for each robot R in robots:\n\n   boolean valid = true;\n\n   for (int[] other : robots) {\n\n       if (other == R) continue; // skip itself\n\n       if (other[1] < R[1] || other[0] < R[0]) {\n\n           valid = false;\n\n           break;\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n   if (valid) {\n\n       System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n       flag = true;\n\n       break;\n\n   }\n\nIf any such R is found, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, the current code's structure has variables like b1, row1, etc. which are not needed. So we need to replace that part with the above logic.\n\nThe original code's variables b1 and b2 are probably part of an incorrect approach. So we can remove them and replace with the correct logic.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nList<int[]> robots = new ArrayList<>();\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n    String temp = sc.next();\n\n    for (int j=0; j<m; j++){\n\n        arr[i][j] = temp.charAt(j);\n\n        if (arr[i][j] == 'R') {\n\n            robots.add(new int[]{i,j});\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Check if any robot is already at (0,0)\n\nboolean hasZeroZero = false;\n\nfor (int[] pos : robots) {\n\n    if (pos[0] ==0 && pos[1]==0) {\n\n        hasZeroZero = true;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (hasZeroZero) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n    continue;\n\n}\n\n// Now check for any robot R that can be a candidate\n\nboolean possible = false;\n\nfor (int[] R : robots) {\n\n    int r = R[0], c = R[1];\n\n    boolean valid = true;\n\n    for (int[] other : robots) {\n\n        if (other == R) continue; // skip itself\n\n        if (other[1] < c || other[0] < r) {\n\n            valid = false;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (valid) {\n\n        possible = true;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (possible) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(\"NO\");\n\n}\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, the original code's variables like row1, col1, row2, col2 are not needed. So we need to replace the existing code with this logic.\n\nThe original code's loops after reading the grid are trying to set row1 and col1 for the first robot, and then row2 and col2 for some other condition. But that's not the right approach.\n\nSo the missing code in the original code's first loop (the TODO) is to check if the cell is 'R', and then add to the list. But since the original code doesn't have a list, perhaps the code needs to be restructured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code can be modified to track the required conditions without using a list.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to replace the existing code with the correct logic.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user wants us to fill in the missing parts in the given code.\n\nLooking back at the original code:\n\nThe first loop is:\n\nfor(int i = 0 ; i < n; i++){\n\n    String temp = sc.next() ; \n\n    for(int j = 0 ; j < m ; j++){\n\n        arr[i][j] = temp.charAt(j) ; \n\n        if(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\n            b1 = true ; \n\n            row1 = i ; \n\n            col1 = j ; \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe TODO is to check if the cell is 'R'. So the condition should be if (arr[i][j] == 'R').\n\nBut then, what is the purpose of b1, row1, col1? The current code's logic is unclear. The second loop is also trying to find some row2 and col2.\n\nThe current code's logic after that is:\n\nif(col1 != col2) \u2192 output No else Yes.\n\nThis suggests that the code is trying to compare the column of the first robot (row1, col1) with the column of some other robot (row2, col2). But the second loop is iterating over columns first, then rows. So for each column i, it's checking rows from 0 to n-1. The first 'R' in column i (the topmost one) will set b2 to true and record row2 and col2. Since the loop starts with column 0, the first R in column 0 (if any) will be the first to set b2. So row2 and col2 would be the position of the first R in column 0 (if any), or the first R in column 1, etc.\n\nThe code then checks if col1 (the column of the first robot encountered in the first loop) is equal to col2 (the column of the first R in the first column where a R is found). If not, output No.\n\nThis logic is incorrect. So the correct approach requires replacing this with the correct conditions.\n\nBut since the problem requires us to fill in the missing code in the existing code structure, perhaps the original code's approach is different and we need to find what the original code is trying to do and fix it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's logic is trying to find the leftmost column where a robot exists and the topmost row in that column, and then see if all robots are in that column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's logic is trying to find the leftmost column of any robot and the topmost row in that column, and then see if all robots are in that column. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost column of any robot (col1) and the first column where a robot exists (col2). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost column of any robot and the first column where a robot exists, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost column of any robot and the first column where a robot exists, and if they are the same, then output yes. But this is not correct.\n\nThe sample input 1's first test case has a robot at (0,1). The leftmost column is 1, but the first column (0) has no robot. So col1 would be 1 (since the first robot encountered is at (0,1)), and col2 would be 1 (since the first column with a robot is column 1). So col1 == col2 \u2192 output yes. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 2: perhaps the robots are in columns 0 and 1. So col1 would be 0 (first robot encountered is in column 0), and col2 is 0 (first column with a robot is 0). So col1 == col2 \u2192 output yes, but the sample says no. So this suggests the code's logic is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the original code's logic is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach is to replace the code with the correct logic.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user wants us to fill in the missing parts in the given code.\n\nLooking at the code's current structure:\n\nThe first loop is supposed to set b1, row1, col1. The condition is missing. The code's first loop is for each cell, and when it finds an 'R', it sets b1 to true and records row1 and col1. But since b1 is initialized to false, this will only record the first 'R' encountered. So row1 and col1 are the position of the first robot in row-major order.\n\nThe second loop is iterating over columns first, then rows. For each column i, it checks each row j in that column. The first 'R' found in that column (the topmost one) will set b2 to true and record row2 and col2. So for example, in column 0, if there's a robot at row 0, then row2 and col2 will be (0,0). If there are no robots in column 0, then it proceeds to column 1, etc.\n\nThe code then checks if col1 (the column of the first robot) is equal to col2 (the column of the first robot in the first column where a robot exists). If not, output No.\n\nThis logic is incorrect. For example, in sample 1, the first robot is at (0,1), so col1 is 1. The first column with a robot is column 1 (since column 0 has no robots), so col2 is 1. So the code outputs yes, which is correct.\n\nSample 2: suppose the robots are in columns 0 and 1. The first robot encountered in the first loop is in column 0, so col1 is 0. The first column with a robot is column 0, so col2 is 0. So the code would output yes, but the sample requires no. So this suggests the code's logic is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the original code's logic is incorrect and needs to be replaced with the correct conditions.\n\nBut the problem requires us to fill in the missing code in the existing code structure. The only missing part is the condition in the first loop's if statement (the TODO).\n\nThe first loop's if condition is supposed to set b1 to true and record the first robot's position. The code's current variables are not used correctly, but perhaps the code is trying to do something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost column of any robot and the topmost row in that column, and then see if all robots are in that column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost column of any robot (col1) and the first column where a robot exists (col2). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost column of any robot and the first column where a robot exists, and if they are the same, then output yes.

The user wants to fill in the missing code so that the program will run correctly.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make at least one robot reach the upper left corner of the field without forcing any robot to explode.\n\nThe code provided has a main loop for each test case, but the key parts are missing.
