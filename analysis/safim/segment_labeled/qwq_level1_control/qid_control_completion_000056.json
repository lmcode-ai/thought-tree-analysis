Wait, the problem's input constraints are 1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1e5. So when n=1 and m=1, the grid is a single cell. But Stanley's start and end are the same (since (1,1) to (1,1)), and Megan's start and end are also the same (since (1,1) to (1,1). So their total energy would be 0. So in that case, the code would print 0. So the if condition should check if n ==1 and m ==1. That's probably the case. Wait, but let's see the code's else part. The else part's formula is (n + m -2) + min(n, m). Let's see for n=1 and m=1, that would be (1+1-2) +1 = 0 +1 =1, but the correct answer is 0. So the if condition must be when either n or m is 1? Or when both are 1? Wait, let's think of other cases. Let's take the example given in the note. The first test case's input must be n=7 and m=5, since Megan moves to (7,3) which is in a 7x5 grid. The answer there is 15. Let's see what the code's else part would compute. n + m -2 is 7+5-2 =10, plus min(7,5)=5. So total 15, which matches the example. So the code's else part is correct for that case. So the if condition must be when the minimal total is 0, which is only when n=1 and m=1. So the code's if condition should be (n ==1 && m ==1). Then the else would handle all other cases. Wait, but what about when either n or m is 1? Let's see another case. Suppose n=1 and m=2. Then Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). The minimal energy for him is 1. Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). Her path is also 1. So total is 2. Let's see what the code's else part would give. n + m -2 is 1+2-2 =1, plus min(1,2)=1. So total 2, which is correct. So in this case, the code's else is correct. So the only case where the if condition is true is when n and m are both 1. So the code's if condition should be (n ==1 && m ==1). Another test case: n=2, m=2. The minimal total? Let's see. Stanley needs to go from (1,1) to (2,2). The minimal steps without portals would be 2 (right then down, or down then right). Megan goes from (2,1) to (1,2). Her minimal steps are also 2. So total 4. But using portals: Let's see. Megan can leave portals along her path. Suppose Megan takes the path (2,1) -> (1,1) (then she leaves a portal there). Then Stanley can use that portal. Let me think of a better way. Alternatively, maybe the formula works here. The code's else part would compute (2+2-2) + 2 (since min(2,2) is 2) \u2192 2 +2 =4. Which matches. So the formula works here. Another case: n=3, m=3.

So Megan's path from (3,1) to (1,3) can be done in 4 steps (moving up twice and right twice). \n\nStanley's path: he can go from (1,1) to (3,3). But if Megan has left portals along her path, maybe he can use them. For example, when Megan is at (1,1), there's a portal there. So Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (3,1) (Megan's starting point?), but Megan's starting point has a portal? Wait, Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So Megan starts at (3,1), so that cell has a portal. So when Megan moves to (2,1), that cell also has a portal, etc. \n\nSo, perhaps Stanley can take a path that uses the portals. Let me think of the minimal steps:\n\nSuppose Megan takes the path to (1,1) first. Then, Stanley can use the portal at (1,1) to teleport to Megan's starting point (3,1) for 1 energy. Then from there, he can go down to (3,3) via moving right twice (but that's 2 steps). Wait, but (3,1) to (3,3) is two steps right. So total for Stanley: moving to (1,1) (but he starts there, so 0?), then teleport to (3,1) (1 energy), then move right twice (2). So total 3. \n\nMeanwhile Megan's path: from (3,1) to (1,1) (2 steps up), then to (1,3) (2 steps right). So Megan's total is 4. \n\nTotal energy: 3 +4 =7, which matches the formula. \n\nSo the formula works here. \n\nSo the formula seems to be correct except when n and m are both 1. \n\nTherefore, the if condition should check if n ==1 and m ==1. In that case, the answer is 0. Otherwise, the else part gives the correct answer. \n\nSo the code's if condition should be:\n\nif (n == 1 && m ==1) \n\nThen the code will print 0, else the formula. \n\nSo the missing code in the if statement is (n ==1 && m ==1). \n\nWait, but let me check another case where n=1 and m=3. \n\nn=1, m=3. \n\nStanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,3). That's 2 steps. Megan's path is from (1,1) (since n=1, Megan starts at (1,1)?) Wait, Megan's starting point is (n,1). If n=1, then Megan starts at (1,1), and her destination is (1,3). So Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,3), which is 2 steps. So total is 4. \n\nThe formula gives (1+3-2) +1 (min(1,3)=1). So (2) +1 =3. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, in this case, the formula would give 1+3-2 =2, plus min(1,3)=1 \u2192 total 3. But the actual minimal total is 4? \n\nHmm, that's a problem. So maybe my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait, let's think again. \n\nIn the case n=1 and m=3:\n\nStanley starts at (1,1), needs to go to (1,3). Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1) and needs to go to (1,3). \n\nWait, Megan's starting point and destination are the same? Because Megan's start is (n,1) which is (1,1), and her destination is (1, m) which is (1,3). So she has to move from (1,1) to (1,3). \n\nSo both Stanley and Megan need to go from (1,1) to (1,3). \n\nWait, but Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,3). So she can just move right twice, costing 2. Stanley can do the same, costing 2. Total 4. \n\nBut according to the formula, it would be (1+3-2) +1 \u2192 (2) +1 =3. \n\nHmm, so discrepancy here. So the formula is wrong here. \n\nWait, so maybe my initial assumption about the formula is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem's description. \n\nThe problem says that Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So Megan starts at (n,1). So in the case n=1, m=3, Megan starts at (1,1). So when she starts, that cell already has a portal. \n\nSo Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,3). Let's say she moves right two steps. So she visits (1,2) and (1,3). So those cells get portals. \n\nSo Megan's path uses 2 energy. \n\nStanley's path: he can use the portals. \n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can choose to move right twice (cost 2), but maybe better to use portals. \n\nWait, since Megan's path includes (1,2) and (1,3), those have portals. \n\nAlternatively, when Megan is moving, she leaves portals. So when Megan is at (1,2), that cell has a portal. \n\nSo Stanley can, for example, move to (1,2) via moving right once (cost 1), then teleport to (1,3) (since that's a portal). \n\nWait, but Megan's destination is (1,3), so she must have visited it. So (1,3) has a portal. \n\nSo Stanley's path could be:\n\nMove right to (1,2) (cost 1). Then teleport to (1,3) (cost 1). Total 2. \n\nSo that's better. \n\nSo total for Stanley is 2. \n\nMegan's path is 2. \n\nTotal is 4. Wait, but that's same as before. Wait, but the formula gives 3. \n\nHmm, so maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, the formula's calculation for n=1 and m=3 is (1+3-2) +1 \u2192 (2) +1 =3. \n\nHmm, but the actual total here is 4? Or can they do better?\n\nWait, Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,3). She can take two steps right, costing 2. \n\nStanley can use the portals. \n\nWait, Megan's starting cell (1,1) has a portal. So when Stanley is at (1,1), he can teleport to any other portal. \n\nWait, Megan's path is (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). So the portals are at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). \n\nSo Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) directly. That would cost 1 energy. \n\nSo Stanley's path is: use the portal from (1,1) to (1,3). So he uses 1 energy. \n\nMegan's path is 2. \n\nTotal is 3, which matches the formula. \n\nAh! Right! I forgot that Megan's starting cell already has a portal. So Megan's starting cell (1,1) has a portal from the beginning. \n\nSo Stanley can immediately teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) (since Megan's starting cell is part of the portals). \n\nSo Stanley's path is just 1 energy. \n\nMegan's path is 2. \n\nTotal 3. Which matches the formula. \n\nSo my mistake earlier was not considering that Megan's starting cell already has a portal. \n\nSo the formula works here. \n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Then the answer is 0, which the code handles with the if condition. \n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. \n\nThen Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (2,1). That's 1 step. Megan's path is from (2,1) to (1,1). That's 1 step. \n\nTotal is 2. \n\nThe formula: n + m -2 is 2+1-2 =1, plus min(2,1)=1 \u2192 total 2. Correct. \n\nSo the formula works. \n\nTherefore, the only case where the answer is 0 is when n and m are both 1. \n\nHence, the if condition should check if (n ==1 && m ==1). \n\nSo the code's if condition should be:\n\nif (n == 1 && m ==1)\n\nSo the missing code is \"n == 1 && m == 1\".\n\nTherefore, the code should have:\n\nif(n ==1 && m ==1)\n\nThen the rest is correct. \n\nSo the answer is to fill in the if condition with that."
