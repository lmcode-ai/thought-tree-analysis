  "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the given Java code for this problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each day whether removing that day's rain will prevent a flood. The flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds m. The key is that when we remove a day's rain (set p_i to 0), we need to check if the maximum accumulated rainfall after all other rains is \u2264 m.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to be using some event-based approach with line sweep. Let me look at the existing code structure.\n\nLooking at the solve() method:\n\nThey have a list 'li' which contains events for each rain's start and end. Each rain contributes three events: x-p (start), x (center?), and x+p (end). The events are sorted by x. Then they process these events to track the accumulated rainfall.\n\nWait, the code uses a line sweep approach to track the maximum rainfall. The variables like prev_height, prev_multiple, etc., suggest that they are calculating the maximum height as they process the events.\n\nThe 'pr' class has x and p, which might represent points and their contributions. The getIntersection function seems to be calculating some intersection point between two lines, perhaps to track the maximum point of the accumulated rainfall.\n\nThe main idea here is that each rain's contribution forms a V-shaped graph (since the rainfall at position j is p_i - |x_i - j|, which is a V with peak at x_i and height p_i). The total accumulated rainfall is the sum of all these V shapes. The maximum of this sum is what we need to check against m.\n\nThe problem requires that for each i, when we remove the i-th rain, the maximum of the remaining V's must be \u2264 m. \n\nThe existing code seems to be trying to compute the maximum point (intersection of the lines) where the total rainfall exceeds m. The 'intersection' variable might store the point where the maximum occurs. \n\nIn the loop over the events, when prev_height exceeds m, they are trying to compute some intersection. The TODO is in the condition for when to set the intersection. \n\nWait, the code's logic for the line sweep is probably tracking the current maximum. The events are sorted, and as we process each event, we update the current multiple (the slope changes?), and track the accumulated height. \n\nThe key is that the maximum accumulated rainfall is the highest point in the combined V shapes. To find if there's any point where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m, we can track the maximum during the line sweep. \n\nBut the problem requires that for each i, when we remove that day's rain, the maximum of the remaining is \u2264 m. \n\nThe approach here might be to first compute the maximum of the entire set. If it's already \u2264 m, then all days can be removed (so all 1's). Otherwise, for each day i, we need to check if removing that day's contribution brings the maximum down to \u2264 m.\n\nBut doing this naively for each i would be O(n^2), which is too slow given n up to 2e5. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nThe existing code seems to be trying to compute the critical point where the maximum occurs. The 'intersection' variable might store the point where the maximum is achieved. Then, for each day's rain, if that rain's contribution is part of the maximum, removing it might reduce the maximum below m.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to find the maximum point and see if removing a particular rain's contribution would lower that maximum.\n\nLooking at the code's 'solve' method:\n\nThey first collect all the events (the start and end of each rain's V shape). Then they sort them. Then they process each event, updating the current height and tracking when the height exceeds m. \n\nThe 'prev_multiple' variable probably represents the current slope of the accumulated function. Since each V contributes +1 slope to the left of x_i, then -1 after x_i, but the exact way they track this might be through the events.\n\nWait, the events are added as:\n\nFor each rain (x, p):\n\n- x-p: this is the left edge of the V. The event here would add +1 to the slope (since the slope increases by 1 here, as the V starts rising).\n\n- x: the center point? Not sure why there's an event at x with p=-2. Maybe that's the peak?\n\nWait, perhaps the events are structured as follows:\n\nEach V-shaped rain contributes to the slope. The left edge (x-p) is where the slope increases by 1 (since the V starts going up). The right edge (x+p) is where the slope decreases by 1 (since the V starts going down). The center (x) might be a point where the slope changes by -2 (since at the peak, the slope changes from +1 to -1, so a total change of -2). \n\nSo the events are:\n\n- At x-p: add +1 to the current slope (since the left edge starts contributing a +1 slope).\n\n- At x+p: add -1 to the current slope (since the right edge stops contributing a +1 slope, so slope decreases by 1).\n\nWait, but the code adds three events per rain:\n\nWait, the code adds:\n\nli.add(new pr(x-p, 1)); // left edge: slope increases by 1?\n\nli.add(new pr(x, -2)); // center: slope decreases by 2?\n\nli.add(new pr(x+p, 1)); // right edge: slope increases by 1? Wait, no, the right edge would be where the slope decreases by 1. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the events are for the start and end of the V's slope changes. Let me think:\n\nThe V shape of a rain's contribution is a line that increases with slope +1 from x-p to x, then decreases with slope -1 from x to x+p. So the slope changes at x-p (starts +1), at x (slope changes from +1 to -1, so a total change of -2), and at x+p (slope changes from -1 to 0, so a change of +1? Wait, no. The slope after x+p would be 0 again. So the slope changes at x-p (increase by +1), at x (decrease by 2), and at x+p (increase by +1 again? No, that would not make sense. Wait, perhaps the slope after x+p is -1 +1 = 0? Let me think again.\n\nThe slope before x-p is 0. At x-p, the slope increases by +1 (so becomes +1). At x, the slope decreases by 2 (so becomes -1). At x+p, the slope increases by +1 again (so back to 0). So the three events are:\n\nAt x-p: +1 (slope starts increasing)\n\nAt x: -2 (slope drops by 2)\n\nAt x+p: +1 (slope increases again by 1, back to 0)\n\nSo the events are correctly set up with p values 1, -2, 1 respectively.\n\nThe 'prev_multiple' variable is the current slope. So as we process each event, the slope changes by the p value of the event.\n\nThe 'prev_height' is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. The way it's calculated is by adding (current x - previous x) multiplied by the previous slope (prev_multiple). \n\nWait, the code does:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple;\n\nYes, because the slope (prev_multiple) is the rate of change of the height. So over the interval from prev_x to curr.x, the height increases by slope * (distance). \n\nSo the code is tracking the accumulated height as it moves along the x-axis. \n\nNow, whenever prev_height exceeds m, that means at some point between prev_x and curr.x, the height has exceeded m. The code is trying to track the earliest point where this happens, perhaps?\n\nThe 'intersection' variable is being used to track the point where the maximum exceeds m. The code's logic here is a bit unclear. Let me look at the code again:\n\nInside the loop over the events:\n\nif(prev_height > m) {\n\n    if( /* TODO condition */ ) intersection = new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m));\n\n    else intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m)));\n\n}\n\nHmm, the getIntersection function takes two pr objects and returns their intersection. The pr here might represent lines. The parameters passed to getIntersection are (2*curr.x, 2*(prev_height - m)), which suggests that these are coefficients of a line equation. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'pr' here is storing the parameters of a line in the form ax + b, but stored as x and p. For example, maybe the line is represented as (a, b) where a is the slope and b is the intercept? Or maybe it's stored in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, the getIntersection function might be finding the point where two lines cross. Let me look at the getIntersection function:\n\npr getIntersection (pr a, pr b) {\n\n    long tx = Math.max(a.x + a.p, b.x + b.p);\n\n    long ty = Math.max(a.p - a.x, b.p - b.x);\n\n    return new pr( (tx - ty)/2, (tx + ty)/2 );\n\n}\n\nHmm, this is a bit cryptic. Let me see what variables a.x and a.p represent here. \n\nSuppose that each pr represents a line in the form of y = m*x + c. But how are the parameters stored? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are represented in a way that allows their intersection to be computed via these formulas. Let me think of the lines as two lines, and the code is trying to compute their intersection point.\n\nWait, the variables tx and ty are computed as the maximum of (a.x + a.p) and (b.x + b.p), and similarly for ty. \n\nWait, perhaps the lines are stored in a way that a.x is the x-intercept and a.p is the y-intercept? Or maybe they are stored as two points?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pr represents a line in the form of (x + y) and (x - y), which can be used to compute the intersection. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are stored as two parameters such that their intersection can be found via those formulas. Let me think of two lines:\n\nSuppose line A is represented by a.x and a.p, and line B by b.x and b.p. \n\nThe code computes tx as the maximum of (a.x + a.p) and (b.x + b.p), and ty as the maximum of (a.p - a.x) and (b.p - b.x). \n\nThen the intersection point is ( (tx - ty)/2, (tx + ty)/2 ). \n\nHmm, perhaps the lines are represented in terms of their maximum and minimum? \n\nAlternatively, maybe each line is represented as two values: (x + y) and (y - x), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are of the form y = m*x + c, and the parameters a.x and a.p are m and c. But then how would the intersection be computed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lines are stored as two points where they cross certain axes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are the two lines that form the V shape of a rain's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the lines could be the left and right edges of the V. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are the two lines that form the current maximum's path. \n\nThis part is a bit unclear. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe code is trying to find the point where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. The 'intersection' variable might be tracking the earliest point where this happens. \n\nThe code's approach is to track the maximum height as it processes the events. Whenever the accumulated height exceeds m, it tries to compute the intersection point where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe getIntersection function is probably combining two lines to find their intersection point, which would be the peak of the accumulated V's. \n\nThe key idea here is that the maximum accumulated rainfall is the highest point of the combined V shapes. To check if removing a particular day's rain would bring this maximum below m, we need to see if that day's rain was contributing to the maximum point. \n\nThe code's approach is to first compute the maximum point (intersection) where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. Then, for each day's rain, it checks if removing that rain's contribution would lower the maximum below m. \n\nThe 'intersection' variable is probably storing the coordinates of the maximum point. \n\nNow, looking back at the code's solve method:\n\nAfter processing all events, if intersection is null, that means the maximum never exceeded m, so all days can be erased (so output all 1's). \n\nOtherwise, for each day's rain, they compute curr_intersection by getting the intersection between the original intersection and the line representing that day's rain (with p_i set to 0). \n\nWait, the code does:\n\ncurr_intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * rain.x, 2 * rain.p));\n\nWait, but when we remove the i-th day's rain, we set p_i to 0, so its contribution is removed. So the line for that rain's V would no longer be part of the accumulated function. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'pr' here represents the contribution of that rain's V. The getIntersection is trying to see if removing that rain's contribution would eliminate the maximum point. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to see if the current maximum (intersection) is due to that rain's contribution. \n\nThe condition in the for loop is:\n\nif(curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x && curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p) then output 1 else 0.\n\nWait, that condition is checking if the new intersection after removing the rain's contribution is exactly the rain's own parameters. Not sure what that means. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to see if the maximum point is exactly the peak of that rain's V. If so, then removing that rain would lower the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to see if the rain's contribution was part of the maximum. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires for each i, whether removing the i-th day's rain would result in the maximum being \u2264 m. \n\nThe approach here is to first compute the maximum of the entire set. If it's already \u2264 m, then all days can be erased (so all 1's). \n\nOtherwise, for each day i, we need to check if the maximum of the remaining days is \u2264 m. \n\nThe key is to find for each i, the maximum when that day is excluded. \n\nBut doing this naively for each i would be O(n^2), which is too slow. \n\nHence, the code must find a way to compute this efficiently. \n\nThe existing code's approach seems to be based on line sweep and tracking the maximum point. \n\nThe 'intersection' variable is probably the point where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe code's logic is that if the maximum point is not affected by removing the i-th day's rain, then the maximum would still exceed m, so the answer is 0. Otherwise, if removing the i-th day's rain causes the maximum to drop below m, then the answer is 1. \n\nThe getIntersection function is probably combining the lines to find the new maximum point when that day's rain is removed. \n\nWait, the code for each day i does:\n\ncurr_intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * rain.x, 2 * rain.p));\n\nWait, but when we remove the i-th day's rain, we are subtracting its contribution. So the lines that form the maximum would be the original lines minus this one. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'intersection' variable represents the current maximum's parameters, and when we remove a rain, we need to see if that rain was part of the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using some mathematical approach where each rain's contribution is a line, and the maximum is the intersection of the left and right lines. \n\nAlternatively, the 'pr' objects might represent lines in a way that allows combining them. \n\nThe getIntersection function's code:\n\npr getIntersection (pr a, pr b) {\n    long tx = Math.max(a.x + a.p, b.x + b.p);\n    long ty = Math.max(a.p - a.x, b.p - b.x);\n    return new pr( (tx - ty)/2, (tx + ty)/2 );\n}\n\nHmm, let's suppose that a and b are two lines. The variables tx and ty are computed as the maximum of (a.x + a.p) and (b.x + b.p), and similarly for ty. \n\nSuppose that each line is represented as two values: (x + y) and (y - x). Then, the maximum of (a.x + a.p) and (b.x + b.p) would be the maximum of (x + y) for the two lines. Similarly for ty. \n\nThen, the intersection point (x, y) would be ( (tx - ty)/2, (tx + ty)/2 ), which is derived from solving x + y = tx and y - x = ty. \n\nWait, solving:\n\nx + y = tx \n\ny - x = ty \n\nAdding the two equations: 2y = tx + ty \u2192 y = (tx + ty)/2 \n\nSubtracting: 2x = tx - ty \u2192 x = (tx - ty)/2 \n\nSo, the intersection point (x,y) is computed as such. \n\nSo, each pr represents a line in terms of (x + y) and (y - x). \n\nWait, but how are the parameters stored in the pr? \n\nSuppose that for a line, the parameters are stored as (a.x, a.p) where a.x is (x + y) and a.p is (y - x). \n\nWait, but then the line's equation would be derived from those two values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is represented by two parameters such that the line's equation can be written as (x + y) = c1 and (y - x) = c2. But that would be two lines, not one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is represented by two parameters such that the line's equation is (x + y) = a.x and (y - x) = a.p. \n\nWait, but that would define a single point, not a line. \n\nHmm, perhaps each line is represented by two parameters, such that the line can be expressed as (x + y) = c and (y - x) = d. But that would be two equations, which only intersect at a point. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is represented by a single equation, and the parameters a.x and a.p are coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each line is of the form y = m*x + b, and the parameters are stored in a way that allows the intersection to be computed via those formulas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is represented as the two intercepts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are the left and right edges of the V shape. \n\nAlternatively, the lines could be the left and right sides of the maximum's path. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using some mathematical trick where the maximum point is found by intersecting lines representing the contributions of each rain. \n\nThis is getting a bit too abstract. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe code's approach is to track the maximum point where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. The 'intersection' variable is storing this point. \n\nThe key is that when we remove a day's rain, we need to see if that day's contribution was part of the maximum. \n\nThe code's current approach for each day i is to compute curr_intersection by intersecting the original intersection with the line representing that day's rain. \n\nWait, the code uses new pr(2 * rain.x, 2 * rain.p). \n\nHmm, perhaps the parameters of the pr are scaled by 2 for some reason. \n\nAlternatively, the 'pr' for a rain's contribution is stored as (2x, 2p), so that when you compute the intersection, it's easier. \n\nThe condition in the for loop is checking if the curr_intersection is exactly the rain's own parameters. \n\nWait, if curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x and curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p, then that would mean that removing this rain's contribution causes the maximum to be exactly this rain's own parameters. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to see if the maximum point is exactly the peak of this rain's V. If so, then removing this rain would eliminate that peak, so the maximum would drop below m. \n\nHence, the condition is checking whether the maximum point is exactly the peak of the i-th rain. \n\nIf that's the case, then the code's logic is: \n\n- The original maximum is at the peak of some rain. \n\n- For each rain, if the maximum was at its peak, then removing it would remove that peak, so the new maximum would be the next highest peak. \n\n- So, if the original maximum was exactly this rain's peak, then removing it would bring the maximum down to m or below. \n\nBut how does the code compute that? \n\nThe code's 'intersection' variable is the point where the maximum occurs. \n\nWhen we remove the i-th rain, the new maximum is the intersection of all lines except that rain's contribution. \n\nThe code computes curr_intersection as the intersection between the original intersection and the line representing the i-th rain. \n\nWait, perhaps the original intersection is the combination of all lines except the i-th, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to see if the i-th rain's contribution was part of the maximum. \n\nThe getIntersection function is combining the original intersection (which is the maximum point) with the line of the i-th rain. \n\nWait, perhaps the original intersection is the point where the maximum occurs. When we remove the i-th rain, the new maximum is the intersection of all lines except that one. \n\nBut how does the code compute that? \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the fact that the maximum is the intersection of the leftmost and rightmost lines contributing to it. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. Let me look back at the code's TODO. \n\nThe TODO is in the condition for when to set the intersection. \n\nThe code has:\n\nif(prev_height > m) {\n\n    if( /* TODO: Your code here */ ) intersection = new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m));\n\n    else intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m)));\n\n}\n\nThe idea here is that when the accumulated height exceeds m, we need to track the point where this happens. \n\nThe 'prev_height' is the accumulated height at the current position. \n\nThe code is trying to find the point where the accumulated height first exceeds m. \n\nThe 'prev_height' is computed as the accumulated height up to the current event's x. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the earliest point where the accumulated height exceeds m. \n\nThe 'intersection' variable is storing the point where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe condition in the if statement is probably checking whether this is the first time the height has exceeded m. \n\nSo, the first time the height exceeds m, we set the intersection to a new pr. \n\nOtherwise, we compute the intersection between the existing intersection and a new line. \n\nHence, the TODO condition is whether the current intersection is null (i.e., this is the first time we've exceeded m). \n\nSo the condition should be: if (intersection == null). \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif (intersection == null) \n\nthen set intersection to new pr(...), else compute the intersection with the new line. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO is \"intersection == null\".\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif (intersection == null) \n\nSo the line would be:\n\nif (intersection == null) intersection = new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m));\n\nelse intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m)));\n\nThat's the missing condition. \n\nNow, let me check the rest of the code. \n\nIn the for loop over the rains, for each rain, they compute curr_intersection by getting the intersection between the original intersection and the rain's parameters (2x, 2p). \n\nWait, the rain's parameters are stored as (x, p). So the new pr is (2x, 2p). \n\nThe getIntersection function would compute the intersection between the original intersection (which is the point where the maximum occurs) and the line representing this rain's contribution. \n\nIf the curr_intersection is exactly the rain's own parameters (2x, 2p), that would mean that the maximum was exactly at this rain's peak. So removing it would eliminate that peak, so the new maximum would be lower. \n\nHence, the condition is checking if the maximum point is exactly this rain's peak. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct. \n\nSo the only missing part is the condition in the TODO, which is \"intersection == null\".\n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nif (intersection == null)\n\nSo the code block becomes:\n\nif (prev_height > m) {\n\n    if (intersection == null) \n\n        intersection = new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m));\n\n    else \n\n        intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height - m)));\n\n}\n\nThat's the missing code. \n\nNow, I need to output only the missing code as plain text. \n\nThe code to be filled in is the condition in the if statement. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing line is the condition in the if statement. \n\nThe code inside the if (prev_height > m) block is:\n\nif ( /* TODO: Your code here */ ) ... \n\nSo the missing code is the condition: intersection == null \n\nHence, the code to output is:\n\nintersection == null\n\nWait, but the code is part of an if condition. The user wants the code that fills the missing lines. \n\nThe original code has:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) intersection = new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height-m));\n\nelse intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * curr.x, 2 * (prev_height-m)));\n\nSo the condition is \"intersection == null\".\n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"intersection == null\".\n\nSo the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nif (intersection == null) \n\nHence, the code to output is:\n\nintersection == null\n\nWait, but the user wants the code that fills the missing lines. The code inside the if statement's condition is the missing part. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nThe missing part is the condition in the if statement. \n\nSo the code to output is:\n\nintersection == null\n\nSo the line would be:\n\nif (intersection == null) \n\nHence, the code to output is \"intersection == null\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is to replace the TODO comment with \"intersection == null\"."
