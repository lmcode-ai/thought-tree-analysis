The term here is (cur[i] * powers[i] * revals[i - groupCnt]). Looking at the variables, 'powers' is an array where powers[i] is i! mod MOD_VAL. 'revals' is the inverse of (i!) mod MOD_VAL.

Since powers[n] is n!. Then, for revals[i], it's revals[i+1] multiplied by (i+1) mod MOD_VAL. Wait, let's see for example:\n\nSuppose revals[n] is the inverse of n!. Then revals[n-1] = revals[n] * n mod MOD_VAL. Because (n-1)! = n! / n \u2192 inverse of (n-1)! is (inverse of n! ) * n mod MOD. Yes, that makes sense. So revals[i] is the inverse of i!. So, the term (powers[i] * revals[i - groupCnt]) would be (i! / ( (i - groupCnt)! )) mod MOD. Because powers[i] is i! and revals[i - groupCnt] is 1/( (i - groupCnt)! ) , so their product is i!/( (i -k)! ), which is the permutation P(i, k). So, the code for the second part (the group being split into individual colors) would be adding the permutation term. The condition for that part is probably when the group can be split into individual colors, which is always allowed? Or maybe when the group is not chosen to be a monochromatic group. Wait, the code's first part (the i-1 case) might be when we choose to split the group into individual colors.
