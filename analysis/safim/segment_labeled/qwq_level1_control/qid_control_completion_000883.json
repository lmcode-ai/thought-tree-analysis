Because total*(total-1) is all possible pairs in the row, minus the sum of pairs where both have the same second character. So the difference would be the number of pairs in the row where the second characters differ. Since the first characters are same, the total difference is exactly 1 if their second characters differ. So this part is counting all pairs where the first characters are the same and the second differ. \n\nSimilarly, the second loop for alphas2 would be doing the same but for the second characters being the same and first differing. Because alphas2 is structured as (second_char, first_char). So for each row i in alphas2, which represents the second character, the rowsum is the total number of strings with second character i. Then, for each j (the first character in the original string), the count is alphas2[i,j] which is the number of strings with second char i and first char j. So the same logic applies here: the term would count pairs where the second characters are same (since row is i) but first differ. \n\nTherefore, the first loop counts pairs differing in the second character (same first), the second loop counts pairs differing in the first character (same second). Adding both gives the total required pairs. \n\nBut in the code provided, the second loop for alphas2 has a missing loop. The first part for alphas1's loops are okay.

The original code for alphas1's Rowsum was looping j from 0 to 10 (since it's 11x11 arrays, since 'a' to 'k' is 11 letters). So the missing loop here should be for j from 0 to 10. \n\nSo the correct loop would be for (int j = 0; j < alphas2.GetLength(1); j++) or since GetLength(0) and GetLength(1) are both 11, just 0 to 10. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"int j = 0; j < alphas2.GetLength(0); j++\" or similar.
