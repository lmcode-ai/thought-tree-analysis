Then compute the divisor for each j.\n\nLet me think of how to compute the exponents. For j in 0 to dim-1:\n\ndiv_term = 10000 ** (2 * (j // 2) / dim)\n\nBut since j starts from 0, (j//2) will be 0 for j=0 and 1, 1 for j=2 and 3, etc. So for every pair of j's, the divisor is the same. Then, for each position pos, the value is pos / div_term.\n\nSo to create position_enc, which is a matrix of shape (n_pos, dim), we need for each position i, and each dimension j: i / (10000^(2 * (j//2)/dim)).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.
