The user mentioned that there's a TODO comment where I have to fill in the code. The comment says to bind the generator to the degenerate distribution. The line after the TODO is creating a variable called deg, which is used to output three values. Looking at the existing code, there's a similar pattern when they created the 'uni' and 'die_gen' variables. For example, the uniform real distribution is bound using boost::variate_generator. The line for 'uni' is:\n\nboost::variate_generator<base_generator_type&, boost::uniform_real<> > uni(generator, uni_dist);\n\nSo, the template arguments are the generator type and the distribution type.
