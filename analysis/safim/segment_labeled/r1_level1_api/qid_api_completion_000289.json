There's a TODO comment where I need to fill in the code for finding an element by its ID. Looking at the code, the line after the comment says element_by_id = # TODO. So I need to replace that with the correct BeautifulSoup method. In BeautifulSoup, to find an element by ID, you can use the find() method with id= parameter. The syntax is soup.find(id='some-id'). Alternatively, there's find_all() but since ID should be unique, find() is sufficient. The existing code uses soup.find(\"title\") for the title tag, so the same approach applies here. The specific_id variable is already set to 'some-id', so the code should reference that variable. So the correct line should be element_by_id = soup.find(id=specific_id). That's the missing code. I need to make sure there are no typos. Also, check if the variable name matches. Yes, specific_id is defined, so using it in the find method is correct.",
