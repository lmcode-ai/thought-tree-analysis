The task is to fill in the missing code so that the program runs correctly. Looking at the line after the comment \"# Reading the dataset into a DataFrame\", the code has \"data = # TODO: Your code here\". The correct way to read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame is by using pd.read_csv(). The file path is already stored in the variable file_path, which is assigned as 'path/to/sports_dataset.csv'. So, the missing line should be something like data = pd.read_csv(file_path). I need to make sure that there are no syntax errors. Since the file_path variable is correctly assigned, using pd.read_csv with that variable should work. That's the only missing part here. The rest of the code uses data.head(), which implies that data is a DataFrame, so the read_csv is the correct approach. No other parts of the code seem to have missing lines. The problem specifically asks for the line that reads the dataset, so the answer should be data = pd.read_csv(file_path).",
