The problem is that the line where 'prediction' is assigned in the predict_sentiment function is missing. I need to figure out what code goes there. So, the function uses the model to get outputs. The outputs from a sequence classification model usually have a 'logits' attribute. The logits are the raw outputs before applying softmax. To get the predicted class, we need to take the argmax of these logits along the appropriate dimension. In PyTorch, for a tensor, the argmax function can be used. Since the model outputs logits of shape (batch_size, num_classes), which in this case is 2 classes (positive and negative), the argmax should be taken along the second dimension (dim=1). Then, we need to get the item from the tensor to convert it to an integer (0 or 1). So the code for 'prediction' should be taking the argmax of outputs.logits along dim=1 and then using .item() to get the value.",
