So the correct code is using the 'reversed' variable. Therefore, the missing line is:\n\nFileUtils.writeStringToFile(new File(\"output.txt\"), reversed, \"UTF-8\");\n\nAlternatively, the code might have a typo. For example, maybe the method is writeStringToFile, but perhaps the parameters are in a different order. Let me verify the method signature. \n\nYes, the correct method is:\n\npublic static void writeStringToFile(File file, String data, String encoding) throws IOException\n\nSo parameters are File, String data, encoding. So the correct order. So the line should be:\n\nFileUtils.writeStringToFile(new File(\"output.txt\"), reversed, \"UTF-8\");\n\nBut in the problem's code, the 'reversed' variable is initialized before the writing part. Therefore, using 'reversed' as the data is plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to write the MD5 hash, but that's after the writing part. So probably not. \n\nGiven the available variables, the code can write any of them, but the most logical would be 'fileContent' or 'reversed'. Since the code is a demo, using reversed might be a better example. \n\nTherefore, the missing line is:\n\nFileUtils.writeStringToFile(new File(\"output.txt\"), reversed, \"UTF-8\");"
