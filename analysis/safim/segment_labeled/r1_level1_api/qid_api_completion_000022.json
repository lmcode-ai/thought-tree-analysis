Thread probably has a sleep function. Wait, but Boost might rely on the Boost. DateTime library for time durations. Oh right, there's boost::this_thread::sleep for putting a thread to sleep. The syntax might be something like boost::this_thread::sleep_for(boost::chrono::seconds(1));. But wait, does Boost require using their own chrono, or maybe Boost has its own way. Alternatively, maybe using boost::posix_time. Let me recall. In older versions of Boost, they used posix_time for durations. So perhaps it's boost::this_thread::sleep(boost::posix_time::seconds(1));. Which one is correct here? The code includes Boost. DateTime, which includes gregorian dates, but maybe not the posix time. Wait, Boost. DateTime does include posix_time in another part.
