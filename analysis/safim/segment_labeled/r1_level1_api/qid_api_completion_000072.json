Looking at the code, the Bag is from Apache Commons Collections. The comment says to create a Bag that counts occurrences. The Bag is of type String, and the variable is called 'bag'. The line starts with Bag<String> bag = /* TODO: Your code here */; So, how do you initialize a HashBag from Apache Commons Collections 4? I remember that in version 4, the HashBag class is in the org.apache.commons.collections4.bag package. The correct way to create a new instance would be using the constructor. So the line should be new HashBag<>();. Wait, checking the import statements: there's an import for org.apache.commons.collections4.bag. HashBag; which is correct. So the missing line is initializing the bag as a new HashBag. So the correct code is:\n\nBag<String> bag = new HashBag<>(); Yes, that's it. The rest of the code uses the add methods correctly, adding \"Apple\" twice and \"Banana\" once.",
