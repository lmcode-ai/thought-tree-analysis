The task is to fill in the missing code. Looking at the code, after plotting the feature importance with plt.bar(), there's a TODO comment. The next lines set the ylabel and title, then show the plot. The missing part is probably adding labels to the x-axis. The current code has plt.ylabel and plt.title, but plt.xlabel is missing. So, the missing line should be plt.xlabel('Features') or something similar. That makes sense because the x-axis represents the features. Adding that line would complete the plot's labels properly.",
