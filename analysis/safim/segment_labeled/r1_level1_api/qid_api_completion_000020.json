The TODO comment says to set up a resolver to translate the server name and service into an endpoint. In Boost. Asio, when you create a resolver, you typically resolve the query to get a list of endpoints. The resolver's resolve method is used for that. The code has a query created for \"time.nist.gov\" and \"daytime\". The next step is to call resolver.resolve(query), which returns an iterator over the possible endpoints. So, the missing line should resolve the query. The resolver's resolve function returns an iterator of type boost::asio::ip::tcp::resolver::iterator. Assigning that result to a variable would be the next step. The variable is probably named endpoint_iterator or something similar. Looking at the surrounding code, after creating the query, the resolver needs to resolve it. So the line would be:\n\nboost::asio::ip::tcp::resolver::iterator endpoint_iterator = resolver.resolve(query);\n\nThat line resolves the query and gets the endpoints. The comment mentions setting up the resolver, which this line does. So that's the missing code.",
