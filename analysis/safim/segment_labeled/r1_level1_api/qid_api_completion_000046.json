But dynMat hasn't been declared yet. So the missing code must be declaring and initializing dynMat. What type is dynMat? The code uses MatrixXd later, but maybe here it's a dynamic matrix. The comments say \"dynamic-size matrix\". Eigen's dynamic matrices are declared with MatrixXd, where X is a placeholder for dynamic size. The constructor needs to specify the size since it's dynamic.
