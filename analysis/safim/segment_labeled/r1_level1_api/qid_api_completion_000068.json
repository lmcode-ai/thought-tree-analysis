Let me think about what methods StringUtils provides. I remember that StringUtils has a reverse method. So, the correct way to reverse the string would be to call StringUtils.reverse(\"Hello World\"). That should assign the reversed string to the variable 'reversed'. Let me check if that's the case. Yes, the line should be String reversed = StringUtils.reverse(\"Hello World\");. I don't think there are any other parameters needed. The reverse method takes the string as input and returns the reversed version. That should fill in the TODO part correctly.",
