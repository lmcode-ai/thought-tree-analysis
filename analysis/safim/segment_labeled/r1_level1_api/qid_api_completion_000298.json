The current line is prediction = # TODO: ... .item(). Looking at the code, the model outputs are in 'outputs'. For classification, the model returns logits. To get the predicted class, we need to take the argmax of the logits. So, outputs.logits would give the logits tensor. Then, applying torch.argmax() on the logits along the appropriate dimension. Since the logits are of shape (batch_size, num_labels), for each input in the batch, we take the argmax on dim=1. So, the prediction would be torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1). Then, to get the integer value, we use .item(). Putting that together, the missing line should be prediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item(). That way, it takes the logits, finds the highest value's index, and converts it to a Python integer with .item().",
