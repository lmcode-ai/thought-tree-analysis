The line in question is:\n\n/* TODO: Your code here */ + dynMat; And the next line prints the sum. So the sum variable is supposed to be the result of adding the top-left 2x2 block of mat and dynMat. Looking at the code, mat is a 3x3 identity matrix. The dynamic matrix dynMat is 2x2. The comment says to perform matrix addition between the top-left 2x2 block of mat and dynMat. In the subtraction part, they use mat.topLeftCorner(2,2). So for addition, probably the same approach. The missing line should create a sum matrix by adding those two. Wait, the line as written is \"sum = ... + dynMat;\". But the code currently has the line as just the expression plus dynMat, but not assigned to sum. So the missing code should be initializing the sum variable. Wait, the existing line is: \n\n/* TODO: Your code here */ + dynMat; So the line is incomplete. The correct code should assign the sum of mat's top-left 2x2 block and dynMat to the variable sum. So the missing code is:\n\nMatrixXd sum = mat.topLeftCorner(2, 2)\n\nBecause when you add that to dynMat, you get the sum.

So the code after filling in would be:\n\nMatrixXd sum = mat.topLeftCorner(2, 2) + dynMat; Yes. Because the existing code has \"+ dynMat\" already. Wait, no, the line is written as:\n\n/* TODO: Your code here */ + dynMat; So the user has to replace the TODO with the left-hand part. So the left operand is mat's top-left 2x2 block. Then add dynMat. So the correct code would be:\n\nMatrixXd sum = mat.topLeftCorner(2, 2) + dynMat;\n\nSo the missing line is \"MatrixXd sum = mat.topLeftCorner(2, 2)\" followed by \"+ dynMat;\".",

Wait, the original code line is:\n\n/* TODO: Your code here */ + dynMat; So that line is supposed to be the line where sum is computed.

Let's see:\n\nIn the subtraction example, it's:\n\nMatrixXd diff = mat.topLeftCorner(2,2) - dynMat; So the sum line is similar but addition. So the correct code for the sum line should be:\n\nMatrixXd sum = mat.topLeftCorner(2,2) + dynMat;\n\nTherefore, the missing code is that entire line.
