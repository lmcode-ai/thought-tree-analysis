The provided code uses two pointers (p1 from left, p2 from right) and two sums (s1 for Alice, s2 for Bob). The condition in the while loop is currently \"p1-1<=p2\", which seems off. We note that the condition should be while the two pointers haven't crossed (p1 <= p2). However, the provided condition is adjusted.

Steps in the loop: If s1 == s2, then we record the current total candies: (p1) [because Alice has eaten from 0 to p1-1, so p1 candies] and (n-1 - p2) [Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1, so n-1-p2 candies].

However, note: the condition in the while loop is \"p1-1<=p2\". Let me adjust the condition to be p1<=p2? But the current condition is \"p1-1<=p2\", which is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This might be to allow one extra step? Actually, we can see that when p1==p2, we can still add one more candy? But note: they cannot eat the same candy. The problem: The current code does not record the total when s1==s2. We are missing the line that appends the total number of candies to l2. Also, note that when s1==s2, we have to record the total and then we have to decide which pointer to move? Actually, we can move either? But the problem is that we are in a loop that breaks when the condition fails. We must break out of the loop when the pointers cross. However, the provided code does not break when s1==s2. It just checks the condition and then the next two ifs. But if s1==s2, then the next two ifs (s1<s2 and s2<s1) are false. So we get stuck. Therefore, we must move a pointer when s1==s2?",

Actually, the note says: the answer is 6. So the array must be of length 6? and the weights are such that the first three from the left sum to 7 and the first three from the right sum to 7? For example: [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]? But that doesn't work. Actually, the note says: \"BANBAN\" is for program2.py. For program1.py, the second test case: the array is not given? But the note says: the answer is 6. We don't need to worry as long as the algorithm is correct. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2)) s1 += l[p1]\n          p1 += 1\n          continue\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop: \"p1-1<=p2\". We are using p1-1? Why? The condition should be p1<=p2? But the condition is written as p1-1<=p2. This is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This allows p1 to be p2+1? Then we can still enter the loop? But when p1=p2+1, then we have already passed? Actually, we are using 0-indexed pointers. The condition should be p1<=p2? However, the condition in the known solution is while p1<=p2. The provided condition is while (p1-1<=p2). This is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. So it allows one extra step? But in our simulation for n=2: \n          Initially: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true. Then we do the body: record 0, then move left: p1=1, then we do the two ifs: then move right: p2=0. Then condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true. Then we record 2, then move left: p1=2, then condition: 2-1=1<=0? false -> break. So it works. Therefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py with:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2)) s1 += l[p1]\n          p1 += 1\n          continue\n\n        But note: what if we cannot move the left? because p1 is already at the end? Then we would get an index error? But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When p1 is at the end, then p1-1 = n-1? and p2 is at least 0? Then we are safe? Actually, we are moving p1 only if we are in the s1==s2 block? And then we do p1+=1. Then we break the condition? Then we break the loop? So it's safe. However, we must check the bounds: we are accessing l[p1]. When p1 is n? Then we get an index out of bounds. But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When p1 = n, then p1-1 = n-1, and p2 is at least -1? Then we break the loop? Actually, no: we break the loop only at the beginning of the next iteration? So we do the body when p1-1<=p2. When p1=n, then p1-1 = n-1, and if p2>=n-1? But p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. So when p1=n, then p2 must be at least n-1? But p2 cannot be more than n-1? So p2=n-1? Then condition: n-1<=n-1 -> true. Then we enter the body. Then we do the s1==s2 block? Then we try to access l[p1] = l[n] -> index out of bounds. Therefore, we must avoid that. How? We can check in the s1==s2 block if p1<=p2? But the problem says: we are allowed to move the left only if p1<=p2? Actually, we are at the state: p1 and p2. We are going to move the left: we take l[p1] only if p1<=p2? But note: the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. This does not guarantee that p1 is in the range [0, n-1]? Actually, p1 starts at 0 and increases. It can become n? Then we are accessing l[n] -> out of bounds. How about we change the condition to while p1<=p2? But we are not allowed to change the provided code? Only the TODO part. Alternatively, in the s1==s2 block, we can check if p1<=p2? But the problem says: we are in the while loop with condition p1-1<=p2. Then p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. So p1 can be p2+1? Then we cannot take l[p1] because p1 is out of bounds? Actually, the condition p1-1<=p2 is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. So the valid p1 are from 0 to p2+1. But when p1==p2+1, then we cannot take l[p1] because the array index is from 0 to n-1, and p2 is at least 0, so p2+1 is at least 1? and if p2+1>=n? then we are out of bounds. But note: p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. p1 starts at 0 and increases. The condition p1<=p2+1. The maximum p1 can be is (n-1)+1 = n. Then we are accessing l[n] -> which is out of bounds. Therefore, we must avoid moving the left if p1 is already beyond the last index? But the condition of the while loop: we are in the body only if p1-1<=p2. Then p1<=p2+1. The array has indices from 0 to n-1. So if p1==n, then we cannot access l[p1]. So we must break the tie by moving the right? But we are in the s1==s2 block? Actually, we can break the tie by moving the right? Then we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n              continue But then we have the same problem: if p2 is -1? Then we cannot access l[p2]? How about we break the tie by moving the one that is still available? But we don't know which one is available? Alternatively, we can break the tie arbitrarily only if we can? That is, if p1<=p2? Then we move the left? Otherwise, we move the right? But if p1>p2, we wouldn't be in the loop? Because the condition is p1-1<=p2? If p1>p2+1, we break. So in the loop, p1<=p2+1. So p1 can be p2+1? Then we cannot move the left? Because p1 is beyond the last candy? Then we must move the right? But the right: p2 is at least 0? Because p1<=p2+1 and p1=p2+1, then p2>=0? Then we can move the right? Therefore, we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2)) if p1 <= p2:   # we can move the left? but note: we are at p1 and p2, and we want to move one? We can move the left if p1 is within [0, n-1]? But p1 is always in [0, n]? and if p1==n, we cannot. But the condition p1<=p2: if p1<=p2, then p1 is at most p2, which is at most n-1? Then we can move the left? Otherwise, if p1>p2, then we must move the right? But note: the condition p1<=p2+1, so if p1>p2, then p1==p2+1. Then we move the right? So:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                s2 += l[p2]\n                p2 -= 1\n            continue\n\n        But note: the condition p1<=p2: if p1==p2, we move the left? Then we break the tie? That's acceptable. However, the problem says: we are only allowed to output the missing code. And the missing code is only for the block under \"if s1 == s2:\". We cannot change the rest. And we are not allowed to output the entire program. Therefore, we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              l2.append(total) if p1 <= p2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n              continue\n\n        But note: the array l has indices from 0 to n-1. When p1==n, we cannot access l[p1]. So we must avoid that. The condition p1<=p2: if p1<=p2, then p1 is at most p2, which is at most n-1? Then we can access l[p1]. If p1>p2, then p1==p2+1, and p2 is at least 0? Then we can access l[p2]? Because p2 is in [0, n-1]? So this is safe. But what if p1>p2? Then we are in the state: p1=p2+1. Then we move the right: s2 += l[p2]? But p2 is the current right pointer? Then we move p2 to p2-1? Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1 = p2+1-1 = p2, and p2 becomes p2-1? Then condition: p2 (the new p2) = p2_old - 1, and p1-1 = p2_old? Then condition: p2_old <= p2_old? true? Then we enter again? But we have already moved the right? Then we might have p1 and p2 such that p1-1 = p2_old, and p2 = p2_old-1, so p1-1 = p2_old > p2_old-1? Then the condition p1-1<=p2? -> p2_old <= p2_old-1? false? Then we break? Actually, after moving the right, we break the tie and then continue to the next iteration? Then we check the condition: p1-1<=p2? (with p2 now being p2_old-1). And p1-1 = p2_old, and p2_old-1 = p2, so we have p2_old <= p2_old-1? which is false? Then we break. So it's safe. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2)) if p1 <= p2:\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n          continue\n\n        But note: the problem says: the total of the test cases n is at most 200000. And we are doing at most n steps? So it's efficient. Let me test with the third test case: [1] (n=1)\n          p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true. s1=0, s2=0 -> we append total = 0 + (1-1-0)=0. Then we check: p1<=p2? 0<=0 -> true -> then s1 += l[0]=1, p1=1. Then we continue -> skip the next two ifs. Next iteration: condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> 0<=0 -> true. Then s1=1, s2=0 -> we don't enter the s1==s2 block. Then we check: if s1 < s2? no. Then if s2 < s1? yes -> then s2 += l[0]=1, p2=-1. Then next iteration: condition: p1-1=0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1? false -> break. Then we print l2[-1] = 0. Correct. So we use that.

We must output the missing code for each in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: Alice and Bob eat candies from the ends. They want the total weight eaten by each to be equal, and they want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code uses two pointers (p1 from left, p2 from right) and two sums (s1 for Alice, s2 for Bob). The condition in the while loop is currently \"p1-1<=p2\", which seems off. We note that the condition should be while the two pointers haven't crossed (p1 <= p2). However, the provided condition is adjusted. Also, there is a list l2 that is being appended to when s1==s2, and then at the end we print l2[-1]. This suggests that we are storing the total number of candies eaten (which would be p1 + (n-1-p2)) whenever the sums are equal.\n\n The idea: We traverse from both ends. We start with s1=0 and s2=0. We have two pointers: p1 starting at 0 and p2 at n-1.\n We will have a variable to record the maximum total candies eaten when the two sums are equal.\n\n Steps in the loop:\n   If s1 == s2, then we record the current total candies: (p1) [because Alice has eaten from 0 to p1-1, so p1 candies] and (n-1 - p2) [Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1, so n-1-p2 candies]. Total = p1 + (n-1-p2). We store this total in l2? Actually, the problem says to maximize the total number of candies. So we want the maximum total when we have an equal sum.\n\n   Then, if s1 < s2, we add the next candy from the left (l[p1]) and move p1 forward.\n   If s2 < s1, we add the next candy from the right (l[p2]) and move p2 backward.\n\n However, note: the condition in the while loop is \"p1-1<=p2\". Let me adjust the condition to be p1<=p2? But the current condition is \"p1-1<=p2\", which is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This might be to allow one extra step? Actually, we can see that when p1==p2, we can still add one more candy? But note: they cannot eat the same candy.\n\n The problem: The current code does not record the total when s1==s2. We are missing the line that appends the total number of candies to l2.\n\n Also, note that when s1==s2, we have to record the total and then we have to decide which pointer to move? Actually, we can move either? But the problem is that we are in a loop that breaks when the condition fails. We must break out of the loop when the pointers cross.\n\n However, the provided code does not break when s1==s2. It just checks the condition and then the next two ifs. But if s1==s2, then the next two ifs (s1<s2 and s2<s1) are false. So we get stuck. Therefore, we must move a pointer when s1==s2? Actually, we can move either one. But note: we want to maximize the total, so we are going to record every time we have an equal sum. Then we can move one of the pointers arbitrarily? However, the problem does not require that we stop at the first equal sum. We might have a better one later.\n\n Actually, the algorithm is: we start with both sums 0. Then we try to increase the smaller sum by taking the next candy from its side. When they become equal, we record the total. Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? But note: we can also move the right pointer? The problem is that we want to consider all possibilities.\n\n However, the standard solution for this problem is:\n\n   total = 0\n   i = 0\n   j = n-1\n   left_sum = 0\n   right_sum = 0\n   ans = 0\n   while i <= j:\n        if left_sum == right_sum:\n            ans = i + (n-1-j)   # because Alice has eaten [0, i-1] -> i candies, Bob has eaten [j+1, n-1] -> n-1-j candies\n            # then we can move either? Actually, we move the left to try to extend? But note: we are going to continue until the pointers cross, and we update ans every time we have an equality. Then the last equality might not be the maximum? Actually, we want the maximum total candies. But note: as we move, the total candies eaten so far is increasing? Actually, when we have an equality, we record the total and then we move the left pointer (so that we can try to get another equality later). But the total number of candies might be larger later? Actually, no: because we are going to eat more candies, but we break the equality? We are not necessarily going to get a larger total.\n\n        Actually, the standard solution is to update the answer when we have an equality and then move the left pointer (because we are going to try to get a larger total by having more candies on both sides?).\n\n        However, note: the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So we are going to eventually cover the entire array? And we want the maximum total candies when the two sums are equal.\n\n        The known solution for \"Candies\" (Two Sum from two ends) is:\n\n          ans = 0\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          while i <= j:\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  ans = i + (n - 1 - j)   # total candies eaten so far\n              if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += a[i]\n                  i += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += a[j]\n                  j -= 1\n          # and then if at the end we have left_sum==right_sum, we update again? But note the condition: we break when i>j.\n\n        However, the problem says: we want to maximize the total number of candies. So we record every time we have an equality? And then the last recorded equality might not be the maximum? Actually, we should record the maximum total.\n\n        But note: the total candies when we have an equality is i + (n-1-j). As we move, i increases and j decreases, so the total candies (i + (n-1-j)) increases? Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers independently. However, we are always adding one candy at a time. The total candies eaten is i + (n-1-j). When we add to the left, i increases by 1, so the total increases by 1. When we add to the right, j decreases by 1, so the total increases by 1 (because n-1-(j-1) = n-1-j+1). So the total is always increasing? Then the last equality we get would be the maximum? But wait: we might have an equality at the beginning and then not again until the end? Actually, we want the maximum total, so we should record the maximum total when we have an equality.\n\n        However, the known solution (from the note examples) is to update the answer whenever we have an equality and then we break the tie by moving the left? Actually, we can do:\n\n          ans = 0\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          while i <= j:\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  ans = i + (n-1-j)   # record the current total\n                  # then we break the tie by moving the left? But we don't know which one to move? Actually, we can move the left to try to get a larger total? But note: we are going to move one of them anyway in the next step? The known solution is:\n\n              if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += a[i]\n                  i += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += a[j]\n                  j -= 1\n\n          # and then after the loop, if left_sum==right_sum, we update ans again? But the pointers have crossed.\n\n        Actually, the known solution for the problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n          ans = 0\n          l = 0\n          r = n-1\n          suml = 0\n          sumr = 0\n          while l <= r:\n              if suml == sumr:\n                  ans = l + (n - r - 1)\n              if suml <= sumr:\n                  suml += a[l]\n                  l += 1\n              else:\n                  sumr += a[r]\n                  r -= 1\n          if suml == sumr:   # after the loop, if they are equal, we update?\n              ans = l + (n - r - 1)   # but note: l is now l, and r is now r (after the last move) and they have crossed? Actually, we break when l>r.\n\n        Actually, we update during the loop. And we break when l>r. The last update when they are equal is the maximum because the total candies is increasing.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total candies is the number of candies eaten. And we are increasing the total by one each step. So the last time we had an equality is the maximum.\n\n        However, the provided code in the problem has a list l2 and then prints l2[-1]. So we are storing every time we have an equality? Then we take the last one? But that would be the maximum? Because the total is increasing.\n\n        Therefore, in the missing part for program1.py, when s1==s2, we should append the current total to l2? And then we break the tie by moving the left? Actually, we don't break the tie arbitrarily? We have to move one of the pointers to avoid an infinite loop. But note: the next two ifs: if s1 < s2, we move the left; if s2 < s1, we move the right. But if s1==s2, we don't move? Then we get stuck.\n\n        So we must move a pointer when s1==s2? How about we move the left? Then we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              total = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten [0, p1-1] -> p1 candies, Bob has eaten [p2+1, n-1] -> n-1-p2 candies.\n              l2.append(total)\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n\n        But then we break the condition? Because we are moving the left. Alternatively, we can break the tie arbitrarily? Actually, we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              # record the total\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              # then we move the left? because we want to continue? But note: we might get another equality? And the total will be increasing? So we can move the left? But then we break the equality? So we don't need to record again until we get an equality again.\n\n        However, the known solution does not record every time? It just updates the answer variable. But the problem says: we want the maximum total. And the total is increasing? So the last time we have an equality is the maximum.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              # and then we break the tie by moving the left? But we don't know which one to move? Actually, we can move both? But that would be two moves? The problem doesn't require that we simulate the eating? We are just computing.\n\n        Actually, the known solution does not get stuck because they break the tie by moving the one with the smaller sum? But when they are equal, they move the left? How? They do:\n\n          if left_sum <= right_sum:   # when equal, we move the left\n              left_sum += a[i]\n              i += 1\n\n        So we can change the condition:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              # then we do: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1   (so we break the tie by moving the left)\n\n        But note: the next two ifs: after the s1==s2, we have an if for s1<s2 and then for s2<s1. But if we break the tie by moving the left, then s1 becomes l[p1] (which is positive) and then we break the equality. Then the next step we will have s1>s2? Not necessarily: because we don't know the value.\n\n        Alternatively, we can restructure the code to avoid the infinite loop. The known solution does:\n\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # and then we record the maximum? Actually, we can set max_ans = max(max_ans, p1 + (n-1-p2))? But note: the total is increasing? So we don't need to take max? We can just update ans and then the last one is the maximum.\n\n          But the known solution does not store all, it just updates ans when they are equal. Then the last update is the maximum.\n\n        However, the provided code uses a list l2 and then prints l2[-1]. So we are storing every time we have an equality. Then at the end we print the last one. But the last one is the maximum? Because the total is increasing? Yes: because each step we add one candy (either left or right). So the total candies eaten (p1 + (n-1-p2)) increases by one each step. Therefore, the last time we have an equality is the maximum.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n\n          And then we must break the tie? Otherwise, we get stuck. We can break the tie by moving the left? But note: the next two ifs: if s1 < s2, we move the left; if s2 < s1, we move the right. But if we don't move in the s1==s2 block, then we skip the next two ifs? Then we get stuck.\n\n        Therefore, we must move a pointer when s1==s2. We can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              # Then we move the left? because we want to continue? But we can also move the right? Actually, it doesn't matter? Because the total will be the same? But note: we are going to move one pointer arbitrarily? Then we break the equality.\n\n        However, the known solution breaks the tie by moving the left when the sums are equal? Because they use:\n\n          if left_sum <= right_sum:   # which includes the equal case\n              left_sum += a[i]\n              i += 1\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              # then we do: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1   (so we break the tie by moving the left)\n\n        But then we don't need the next two ifs? Actually, we have the next two ifs. So we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:\n              if s1 < s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              if s2 < s1:   # note: after the above, s1 might become >= s2? But we have to check again? Actually, the condition is independent? But we have two ifs? So if we do the first if and then the second if? That might be problematic.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the structure to if-elif:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          elif s1 < s2:\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:   # s2 < s1\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n\n        This avoids the two ifs being executed in one iteration.\n\n        But note: the original code has two ifs. So we must change the structure? The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines\". The missing line is at the TODO: which is under the condition \"if s1 == s2:\". So we can only fill that block? We cannot change the rest.\n\n        How about we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              # then we break the tie by moving the left? But we cannot change the rest of the code? The next two ifs are independent. So if we do nothing in the s1==s2 block, then the next two ifs will be skipped? Then we get stuck.\n\n        Therefore, we must break the tie in the s1==s2 block? But we are not allowed to change the rest? Then we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              # force a move: we move the left? Then we do: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1   -> but then we break the condition? And then we break the loop? Actually, we are in the while loop and we are moving the pointers. Then the next iteration will be with the updated pointers.\n\n        But note: the next two ifs are still there. So if we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          # then the next two ifs: \n          #   if s1 < s2: ... \n          #   if s2 < s1: ... \n          # But we just moved the left, so s1 has been updated. Then we check the next two ifs? But we might have s1>s2? Then we do the second if? That would be wrong because we would then add to the right? So we would have moved two candies in one iteration? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the tie by moving the left and then skip the next two ifs? But we cannot change the rest.\n\n        Another idea: we can break the tie by moving the left in the s1==s2 block and then set the sums to be unequal? Then the next two ifs will not be triggered? But wait: after we move the left, we have updated s1 and p1. Then we check the next two ifs? It might be that now s1>s2? Then we would also do the second if? That would be bad.\n\n        How about we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              # We break the tie by moving the left, but then we break out of the current iteration? We can use 'continue' to skip the rest of the loop body? Then the next two ifs are skipped.\n\n        Then:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n              continue   # skip the next two ifs\n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop: we are at the same iteration? Then we break the tie and then skip the rest? Then we go to the next iteration.\n\n        This might work.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the next two ifs are independent. So if we move the left in the s1==s2 block, then we have updated s1 and p1. Then we check the next two ifs? It might be that now s1>s2? Then we would do the second if? That would be incorrect because we would then add to the right? Then we would have moved two candies in one iteration? That would break the simulation.\n\n        Therefore, we must skip the next two ifs. So we use 'continue'.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n          s1 += l[p1]\n          p1 += 1\n          continue\n\n        But note: what if after moving the left, the pointer p1 becomes greater than p2? Then the while condition fails? But we are in the loop body. We do the update and then the next two ifs are skipped? Then we break the loop? That's fine.\n\n        Also, what if we are at the last candy? Then we move the left and p1 becomes p1 (which was p1, then we do p1+1) and then we break the loop? Then we don't get the last equality? But note: we already recorded the equality at the previous state? Actually, we record the equality at the state (s1, s2) and then we move. Then the next iteration we break? So we have the last recorded total.\n\n        However, the known solution does not use a list and then print the last element. It updates the answer and then after the loop, we print the answer. But the problem says: we print l2[-1]. So we must have at least one element in l2? What if there is no equality? Then l2 is empty? Then l2[-1] would fail.\n\n        The problem says: if there is no way, then the answer is 0. For example, the third test case: n=1, [1] -> no non-zero equality? Then we should output 0.\n\n        How do we handle that? The provided code prints l2[-1]. So we must ensure that if there is no equality, we have at least one element? Or we initialize l2 with 0? The problem says: the answer is 0 for the third test case.\n\n        The provided code initializes l2=[].\n\n        We can initialize l2 with 0? But the problem says: output the missing code. We cannot change the initialization.\n\n        Alternatively, we can record the 0? But note: we start with s1=0 and s2=0 -> that's an equality? Then we record total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0? Then we move the left? Then we break? Actually, the total for the initial state is 0? But the problem says: they eat 0 candies? So that's valid.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". So 0 is the answer.\n\n        But note: the initial state: both have 0, so they have eaten 0 candies. That is a valid state? Then we record 0.\n\n        Then we move the left? Then we break the tie? Then we continue? Then we might get more? But the problem says: they cannot eat the same candy. So if we start by moving the left, then we have Alice eating one candy? Then Bob has 0. Then we move the right? Then Bob has one candy? Then we have an equality? But wait: the third test case: [1] -> only one candy. Then:\n\n          Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0, then we move the left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then the while condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> 0<=0 -> true.\n          Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the next two ifs: \n            if s1 < s2? no.\n            if s2 < s1? yes -> then s2 += l[0]? but p2 is 0 -> l[0] is 1? Then s2=1, p2=-1.\n          Then we break the loop? Then we have l2 = [0, ...]? Then we print l2[-1] which is 0? But wait: the total when we had s1=1 and s2=1? We never recorded that? Because we only record when s1==s2? And we broke the tie by moving the left? Then we didn't record the state (1,1) because we moved the left and then the right? Then we never had a chance to record the state (1,1) because we are in the next iteration? Actually, we are in the same iteration? \n\n        How about we restructure the code to record the equality at the beginning of the loop? Then we break the tie? Then we update the pointers? Then we check the condition again? \n\n        Actually, the known solution updates the answer at the beginning of the loop and then breaks the tie. Then they move one pointer. Then the next iteration.\n\n        So for the third test case: [1]\n          p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: p1-1<=p2? -> -1<=0 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> record total = 0 + (1-1-0) = 0? Then we break the tie: move left: s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then the next two ifs: s1>s2 -> then we move the right: s2=1, p2=-1.\n          Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1=0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1? false -> break.\n          Then we print l2[-1] = 0.\n\n        But the problem says: the answer is 0. So that's correct.\n\n        However, what about the first test case: n=2, [1,1]? \n          Initially: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> record total = 0 + (2-1-1)=0? Then we break the tie: move left: s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then the next two ifs: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the second if: s2<1 -> true -> then s2 += l[1]=1, p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> 0<=0 -> true.\n          Then s1=1, s2=1 -> record total = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2? Then we break the tie: move left? but p1=1, so l[p1] would be l[1] -> but we already took l[1]? Actually, p1 is 1, and we are going to do l[p1] -> index 1? But the array has two elements: [1,1]. Then we do s1 += l[1] -> s1=2, p1=2.\n          Then the next two ifs: s1=2, s2=1 -> then we do the second if: s2<1 -> false? because s2=1<2? true -> then s2 += l[0]? but p2=0 -> l[0]=1? then s2=2, p2=-1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=1, p2=-1 -> 1<=-1? false -> break.\n          Then we print l2[-1]=2.\n\n        That matches the first test case.\n\n        But wait: the first test case: n=2, [1,1] -> the answer is 2? because they each eat one candy? Then total is 2.\n\n        However, the note says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\"\n\n        So that's correct.\n\n        The second test case: n=6, [1,2,1,4,1,2]? Actually, the note says: the second test case: Alice eats the first three (with total weight 1+2+1=4) and Bob eats the first three from the right (2+1+4=7)? That doesn't match. The note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" -> so the array must be [7, ...]? Actually, the example in the note: \"BANBAN\" -> that's a different problem? Wait, the note for program1.py says:\n\n          For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\n\n        So the array is: [7, ...]? Actually, the note says: the weights are [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] for the fourth test case. The second test case must be: [1, 3, 3, 1]? or something? Actually, the note says: the answer is 6. So the array must be of length 6? and the weights are such that the first three from the left sum to 7 and the first three from the right sum to 7? For example: [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]? But that doesn't work. Actually, the note says: \"BANBAN\" is for program2.py. For program1.py, the second test case: the array is not given? But the note says: the answer is 6.\n\n        We don't need to worry as long as the algorithm is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n          s1 += l[p1]\n          p1 += 1\n          continue\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop: \"p1-1<=p2\". We are using p1-1? Why? The condition should be p1<=p2? But the condition is written as p1-1<=p2. This is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This allows p1 to be p2+1? Then we can still enter the loop? But when p1=p2+1, then we have already passed? Actually, we are using 0-indexed pointers. The condition should be p1<=p2? \n\n        However, the condition in the known solution is while p1<=p2. The provided condition is while (p1-1<=p2). This is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. So it allows one extra step? \n\n        But in our simulation for n=2: \n          Initially: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          Then we do the body: record 0, then move left: p1=1, then we do the two ifs: then move right: p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n          Then we record 2, then move left: p1=2, then condition: 2-1=1<=0? false -> break.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py with:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n          s1 += l[p1]\n          p1 += 1\n          continue\n\n        But note: what if we cannot move the left? because p1 is already at the end? Then we would get an index error? But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When p1 is at the end, then p1-1 = n-1? and p2 is at least 0? Then we are safe? Actually, we are moving p1 only if we are in the s1==s2 block? And then we do p1+=1. Then we break the condition? Then we break the loop? So it's safe.\n\n        However, we must check the bounds: we are accessing l[p1]. When p1 is n? Then we get an index out of bounds. But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When p1 = n, then p1-1 = n-1, and p2 is at least -1? Then we break the loop? Actually, no: we break the loop only at the beginning of the next iteration? So we do the body when p1-1<=p2. When p1=n, then p1-1 = n-1, and if p2>=n-1? But p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. So when p1=n, then p2 must be at least n-1? But p2 cannot be more than n-1? So p2=n-1? Then condition: n-1<=n-1 -> true. Then we enter the body. Then we do the s1==s2 block? Then we try to access l[p1] = l[n] -> index out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid that. How? We can check in the s1==s2 block if p1<=p2? But the problem says: we are allowed to move the left only if p1<=p2? Actually, we are at the state: p1 and p2. We are going to move the left: we take l[p1] only if p1<=p2? But note: the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. This does not guarantee that p1 is in the range [0, n-1]? Actually, p1 starts at 0 and increases. It can become n? Then we are accessing l[n] -> out of bounds.\n\n        How about we change the condition to while p1<=p2? But we are not allowed to change the provided code? Only the TODO part.\n\n        Alternatively, in the s1==s2 block, we can check if p1<=p2? But the problem says: we are in the while loop with condition p1-1<=p2. Then p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. So p1 can be p2+1? Then we cannot take l[p1] because p1 is out of bounds? \n\n        Actually, the condition p1-1<=p2 is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. So the valid p1 are from 0 to p2+1. But when p1==p2+1, then we cannot take l[p1] because the array index is from 0 to n-1, and p2 is at least 0, so p2+1 is at least 1? and if p2+1>=n? then we are out of bounds.\n\n        But note: p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. p1 starts at 0 and increases. The condition p1<=p2+1. The maximum p1 can be is (n-1)+1 = n. Then we are accessing l[n] -> which is out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid moving the left if p1 is already beyond the last index? But the condition of the while loop: we are in the body only if p1-1<=p2. Then p1<=p2+1. The array has indices from 0 to n-1. So if p1==n, then we cannot access l[p1]. So we must break the tie by moving the right? But we are in the s1==s2 block? \n\n        Actually, we can break the tie by moving the right? Then we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n              continue\n\n        But then we have the same problem: if p2 is -1? Then we cannot access l[p2]? \n\n        How about we break the tie by moving the one that is still available? But we don't know which one is available? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the tie arbitrarily only if we can? That is, if p1<=p2? Then we move the left? Otherwise, we move the right? But if p1>p2, we wouldn't be in the loop? Because the condition is p1-1<=p2? If p1>p2+1, we break. So in the loop, p1<=p2+1. So p1 can be p2+1? Then we cannot move the left? Because p1 is beyond the last candy? Then we must move the right? But the right: p2 is at least 0? Because p1<=p2+1 and p1=p2+1, then p2>=0? Then we can move the right? \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n              if p1 <= p2:   # we can move the left? but note: we are at p1 and p2, and we want to move one? We can move the left if p1 is within [0, n-1]? But p1 is always in [0, n]? and if p1==n, we cannot. But the condition p1<=p2: if p1<=p2, then p1 is at most p2, which is at most n-1? Then we can move the left? Otherwise, if p1>p2, then we must move the right? But note: the condition p1<=p2+1, so if p1>p2, then p1==p2+1. Then we move the right? \n\n          So:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                s2 += l[p2]\n                p2 -= 1\n            continue\n\n        But note: the condition p1<=p2: if p1==p2, we move the left? Then we break the tie? That's acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says: we are only allowed to output the missing code. And the missing code is only for the block under \"if s1 == s2:\". We cannot change the rest. And we are not allowed to output the entire program.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              l2.append(total)\n              if p1 <= p2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n              continue\n\n        But note: the array l has indices from 0 to n-1. When p1==n, we cannot access l[p1]. So we must avoid that. The condition p1<=p2: if p1<=p2, then p1 is at most p2, which is at most n-1? Then we can access l[p1]. If p1>p2, then p1==p2+1, and p2 is at least 0? Then we can access l[p2]? Because p2 is in [0, n-1]? \n\n        So this is safe.\n\n        But what if p1>p2? Then we are in the state: p1=p2+1. Then we move the right: s2 += l[p2]? But p2 is the current right pointer? Then we move p2 to p2-1? Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1 = p2+1-1 = p2, and p2 becomes p2-1? Then condition: p2 (the new p2) = p2_old - 1, and p1-1 = p2_old? Then condition: p2_old <= p2_old? true? Then we enter again? But we have already moved the right? Then we might have p1 and p2 such that p1-1 = p2_old, and p2 = p2_old-1, so p1-1 = p2_old > p2_old-1? Then the condition p1-1<=p2? -> p2_old <= p2_old-1? false? Then we break? \n\n        Actually, after moving the right, we break the tie and then continue to the next iteration? Then we check the condition: p1-1<=p2? (with p2 now being p2_old-1). And p1-1 = p2_old, and p2_old-1 = p2, so we have p2_old <= p2_old-1? which is false? Then we break.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n          if p1 <= p2:\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n          continue\n\n        But note: the problem says: the total of the test cases n is at most 200000. And we are doing at most n steps? So it's efficient.\n\n        Let me test with the third test case: [1] (n=1)\n          p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> we append total = 0 + (1-1-0)=0.\n          Then we check: p1<=p2? 0<=0 -> true -> then s1 += l[0]=1, p1=1.\n          Then we continue -> skip the next two ifs.\n          Next iteration: condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> 0<=0 -> true.\n          Then s1=1, s2=0 -> we don't enter the s1==s2 block.\n          Then we check: if s1 < s2? no.\n          Then if s2 < s1? yes -> then s2 += l[0]=1, p2=-1.\n          Then next iteration: condition: p1-1=0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1? false -> break.\n          Then we print l2[-1] = 0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        So we use that.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem: We have a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. We want to perform the minimum number of swaps (swap two distinct indices) so that \"BAN\" does not appear as a subsequence.\n\n The note: \n   For n=1: swap index1 and index2 (1-indexed) -> \"ABN\", which is safe.\n   For n=2: swap index2 and index6 -> \"BNNBAA\", which is safe.\n\n The provided code:\n   for t in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        if n == 1:\n            print(\"1\\n1 2\")\n            continue\n        i = 2\n        j = 3*n\n        ans = []\n        while i<j:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        print(len(ans))\n        for i in ans:\n            print(i[0],i[1])\n\n The idea: \n   The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n        m = ceil(n/2)   -> but the operations? \n        We can do: \n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              swap the 'A' of the i-th \"BAN\" with the 'N' of the (n+1-i)-th \"BAN\"\n\n        How the string is built: \n          s = \"BAN\" * n = [B0, A0, N0, B1, A1, N1, ... , B_{n-1}, A_{n-1}, N_{n-1}]\n\n        The indices (1-indexed):\n          For the k-th block (0-indexed k from 0 to n-1):\n            B: 3*k+1\n            A: 3*k+2\n            N: 3*k+3\n\n        The known solution: \n          We pair the first block with the last block, the second with the second last, etc.\n          For the k-th block (from the front) and the k-th block from the back (until they meet), we swap the A in the front block with the N in the back block.\n\n        How many operations? ceil(n/2).\n\n        Example: n=2 -> ceil(2/2)=1 operation.\n          Front block (k=0): swap A0 (index2) with N1 (index6) -> as in the example.\n\n        Example: n=3 -> ceil(3/2)=2 operations.\n          Swap A0 (index2) with N2 (index9) and swap A1 (index5) with N1 (index6).\n\n        But note: the provided code initializes i=2 and j=3*n. Then in the while loop: while i<j.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          ans.append((i, j))\n          then update i and j? \n\n        How? \n          i starts at 2 (which is the A of the first block) and j starts at 3*n (which is the N of the last block). Then we do:\n            ans.append((2, 3*n))\n          Then we move i to the next A? which is 2+3 = 5? and j to the previous N? which is 3*n-3 = 9? for n=3? Then we do (5,9) for n=3? But wait: for n=3, the next A is at 5 and the previous N is at 9? Then we swap (5,9). Then we move i to 5+3=8? and j to 9-3=6? Then 8<6? false -> break.\n\n        But we need two operations: (2,9) and (5,6) for n=3? \n\n        How about we do:\n\n          while i < j:\n              ans.append((i, j))\n              i += 3   # move to the next A? because the next block's A is 3 more?\n              j -= 3   # move to the previous block's N? which is 3 less?\n\n        Then for n=2: \n          i=2, j=6 -> append (2,6). Then i=5, j=3 -> 5<3? false -> break. So one operation.\n\n        For n=3:\n          i=2, j=9 -> append (2,9)\n          i=5, j=6 -> append (5,6)\n          i=8, j=3 -> 8<3? false -> break. So two operations.\n\n        But is that safe? \n          After swapping (2,9) and (5,6) for n=3:\n            Original: [B0, A0, N0, B1, A1, N1, B2, A2, N2]\n            Swap (2,9): \n                index2 (A0) and index9 (N2) -> becomes: [B0, N2, N0, B1, A1, N1, B2, A2, A0]\n            Then swap (5,6): \n                index5 (A1) and index6 (B2) -> becomes: [B0, N2, N0, B1, B2, A1, N1, A2, A0]\n\n          Now, check if \"BAN\" is a subsequence? \n            We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' in order.\n\n          Let's try: \n            The first B: at index1 (B0) -> then we look for an A after index1: \n                The next A: at index5? but we swapped: \n                  positions: \n                    1: B0\n                    2: N2\n                    3: N0\n                    4: B1\n                    5: B2   (originally A1, but swapped with B2? then at index5 we have B2? and at index6 we have A1? and index7: N1, index8: A2, index9: A0.\n            Then after B0, we can take A at index6 (A1) and then N at index7 (N1) -> that forms B0, A1, N1 -> \"BAN\". \n\n          So it's not safe.\n\n        What went wrong? The known solution swaps the A in the front block with the N in the back block. But in the second swap, we swapped A1 (which is in the second block) with the N1? But the known solution says: swap the A in the front block with the N in the back block. For the second swap, we should swap the A in the second block (which is the next front block) with the N in the second last block? The second last block is the block at index1 (0-indexed block index1) -> its N is at position 3*1+3 = 6? So we should swap A1 (at index5) with N1 (at index6)? But that's adjacent? Then we did swap (5,6) -> that's swapping A1 and N1? Then we get ... A1 becomes N1 and N1 becomes A1? Then the block becomes B1, N1, A1? Then we have \"B1, N1, A1\" -> that's not \"BAN\". \n\n        But then why did we get a \"BAN\" subsequence? \n\n        The known solution: \n          Operation1: swap A0 (index2) and N2 (index9): \n            becomes: B0, N2, N0, B1, A1, N1, B2, A2, A0\n          Operation2: swap A1 (index5) and N1 (index6): \n            becomes: B0, N2, N0, B1, N1, A1, B2, A2, A0\n\n          Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n            B0 at index1, then we need an A after index1: the next A is at index6 (A1) and then an N after index6: we have N2 at index2? but that is before index6? So we cannot use that. Then the next N? at index5 (N1) -> but that is before index6? Then the next N? at index7: B2, then A2, then A0 -> no N? \n            Alternatively: \n              B0 at index1 -> then we can take A0 at index9? then we need an N after index9? none.\n            Or B1 at index4 -> then we can take A1 at index6? then we need an N after index6: none? \n            Or B2 at index7 -> then we can take A2 at index8? then we need an N after index8: none.\n\n          So it should be safe.\n\n        Why did I see B0, A1, N1? \n          The A1 is at index6? and N1 is at index5? because we swapped index5 and index6? So after the swap, the string at index5 is N1 and at index6 is A1? \n          Then the sequence: \n            B0 at index1, then we can take A1 at index6? then we need an N after index6? The only N after index6: we have N2 at index2? that's before. And N0 at index3? before. And N1 at index5? before. Then no N after index6? \n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          ans.append((i, j))\n          i += 3\n          j -= 3\n\n        But note: the indices i and j are updated. The while loop condition: i<j.\n\n        For n=1: we skip the while loop because we handled n=1 separately? Then we don't enter.\n\n        For n=2: we do one operation: (2,6) -> then i becomes 5, j becomes 3 -> 5<3? false -> break.\n\n        For n=3: we do two operations: (2,9) and (5,6) -> then i becomes 8, j becomes 3 -> 8<3? false -> break.\n\n        But what if n is even? we do n/2 operations. If n is odd, we do ceil(n/2) = (n+1)//2 operations.\n\n        The problem says: the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2). And we are doing that.\n\n        Therefore, we fill the TODO in program2.py with:\n\n          ans.append((i, j))\n          i += 3\n          j -= 3\n\n        But note: the indices i and j are 1-indexed? The problem says: indices from 1 to 3n.\n\n        We are using i starting at 2 and j at 3*n. Then we swap them. Then we move i to i+3 and j to j-3.\n\n        This matches the known solution.\n\nFor program3.py:\n The problem: Check if the string s is perfectly balanced: for every substring t and for every two characters u,v in the entire string, the difference in frequency in t is at most 1.\n\n However, the note: \n   The first test case: \"aba\" -> YES.\n   The second test case: \"abb\" -> NO.\n   The third test case: \"abc\" -> YES.\n\n The provided code:\n\n   t = int(input())\n   while(t):\n        s = input()\n        d = len(set(s))   # number of distinct characters\n        for i in range(d, len(s)):\n            if(s[i] != s[i - d]):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n        t -= 1\n\n The idea: \n   The known solution: \n        The condition holds if and only if the string is of the form (a permutation of a set of d distinct characters) repeated? But not exactly? \n\n   Actually, the known solution for \"Perfectly Balanced\" (from Codeforces) is to check that the string is periodic with period d? and the first d characters are distinct? \n\n   How? \n        For i from d to n-1, we must have s[i] == s[i-d].\n\n   Why? \n        Consider the condition: for every substring, the frequency of any two characters differs by at most 1. \n        This is a very strong condition. It implies that the string is \"balanced\" in a very uniform way.\n\n        In fact, it is known that such a string must be of the form: \n            s = (a_0, a_1, ..., a_{d-1}) repeated: so s[i] = s[i mod d].\n\n        And the first d characters must be distinct? \n\n        Why is that? \n          Consider a substring of length d: it must contain exactly one of each character? because if there are d distinct characters, then the frequencies must be 1 for each? because if one character appears twice, then the frequency difference between that character and a character that does not appear would be 2? \n\n        Then for a substring of length d+1: it must contain one character twice and the others once? but then the difference between the character that appears twice and one that appears once is 1? which is allowed.\n\n        But the condition must hold for every substring. \n\n        The known solution: \n            d = len(set(s))\n            if any(s[i] != s[i % d]) for i in range(d, len(s)): then not balanced.\n\n        However, the provided code does:\n\n            for i in range(d, len(s)):\n                if(s[i] != s[i - d]):\n                    # TODO\n\n        This is equivalent to checking s[i] == s[i-d] for all i>=d.\n\n        And if we find one that is not equal, then we break and output \"No\". Otherwise, we output \"Yes\".\n\n        But note: the first d characters: we don't check if they are distinct? The problem says: the entire string s. The condition: the first d characters must be distinct? \n\n        Actually, the variable d = len(set(s)) is the total distinct characters in the entire string. The condition s[i] = s[i-d] for i>=d implies that the string is periodic with period d. But what if the first d characters are not distinct? Then d would be less than the actual distinct count? No: d is the distinct count of the entire string. But if the entire string has d distinct characters, then the first d characters must be distinct? Not necessarily: consider \"aab\", d = 2, then we check i=2: s[2]='b', s[2-2]=s[0]='a' -> not equal? then we output \"No\". \n\n        But \"aab\" is not balanced? \n          Substrings: \n            \"a\": frequencies: a:1, b:0 -> difference 1? allowed.\n            \"aa\": a:2, b:0 -> difference 2? not allowed.\n\n        So \"aab\" should be \"No\". \n\n        How about \"abc\": \n          d=3, then for i from 3 to ... but the string length is 3, so the loop is not entered? then we output \"Yes\".\n\n        How about \"abac\": \n          d = 3 (a,b,c)\n          i=3: s[3]='c', s[3-3]=s[0]='a' -> not equal? then we break and output \"No\". \n\n        But is \"abac\" balanced? \n          Consider substring \"aba\": \n            a:2, b:1 -> difference between a and b: 1 -> allowed.\n            a and c: 2 vs 0 -> difference 2 -> not allowed? \n          Actually, the substring \"aba\" does not contain 'c'. The condition: for every substring t and for every two characters u and v that are present in the entire string s? or present in the substring t? \n\n        The problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\" (the entire string). \n\n        So for the substring \"aba\" in \"abac\", we must consider u and v that are in the entire string (which are 'a','b','c'). \n          For u='a', v='c': in the substring \"aba\", f_t('a')=2, f_t('c')=0 -> difference 2 -> not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, \"abac\" is not balanced.\n\n        How about \"abcd\": \n          d=4, then we check i=4? but the string length is 4, so no iteration? then output \"Yes\". \n          But is it balanced? \n            The entire string: \n              a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> balanced.\n            But consider a substring of length 1: \"a\": \n              a:1, then for u='a' and v='b': difference 1? but wait: the substring \"a\" does not contain 'b'. The condition: the difference between the frequencies of u and v in t. For u='a' and v='b': f_t('a')=1, f_t('b')=0 -> difference 1 -> allowed.\n            Similarly, for any substring of length 1: the difference is 1 for any two characters? \n            For a substring of length 2: \"ab\": \n                a:1, b:1 -> difference 0 for a and b? \n                for a and c: 1 vs 0 -> difference 1? \n            For a substring of length 3: \"abc\": \n                a:1, b:1, c:1 -> balanced.\n            For the entire string: balanced.\n\n          But wait: the condition says: for every substring t and for every two characters u and v present in s. \n          In the substring \"a\", we consider u='a' and v='d': \n                f_t('a')=1, f_t('d')=0 -> difference 1 -> allowed.\n\n          So \"abcd\" is balanced.\n\n        But the known solution: we require that the string is periodic? \"abcd\" is not periodic with period 4? because it has only one period. But the condition s[i] = s[i-d] for i>=d: for i=4, we would compare s[4] (which doesn't exist) -> so we don't check. \n\n        How about \"abcabc\": \n          d = 3 (distinct: a,b,c)\n          Check: \n            i=3: s[3]='a', s[0]='a' -> equal.\n            i=4: s[4]='b', s[1]='b' -> equal.\n            i=5: s[5]='c', s[2]='c' -> equal.\n          Then output \"Yes\".\n\n        And \"abcabc\" is balanced? \n          It is periodic. And the condition holds.\n\n        But what about \"abcd\" (d=4)? \n          We don't enter the loop -> output \"Yes\". \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n          The string must be composed of a block of d distinct characters (which form the first d characters) and then the rest is the repetition of that block? \n\n        But \"abcd\" has one block of length 4. \n\n        So the algorithm is: \n          d = number of distinct characters in s.\n          For i from d to len(s)-1:\n              if s[i] != s[i-d]:\n                  then we break and output \"No\"\n          If we complete the loop, we output \"Yes\".\n\n        However, what if the first d characters are not distinct? \n          Then d = len(set(s)) is less than d0 (the actual distinct count in the first d characters)? But no: d is the distinct count of the entire string. The entire string might have d distinct characters, but the first d characters might not contain all? \n\n        Example: s = \"aabc\" -> distinct: a,b,c -> d=3.\n          Then we check: \n            i=3: s[3]='c', s[0]='a' -> not equal? then we output \"No\".\n\n        But is \"aabc\" balanced? \n          Consider substring \"aa\": \n            a:2, b:0, c:0 -> difference between a and b: 2 -> not allowed.\n\n        So it should be \"No\". \n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is: \n          We break the loop and output \"No\", and then break out of the for loop and the else block? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n          for i in range(d, len(s)):\n              if(s[i] != s[i - d]):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n          else:\n              print(\"Yes\")\n\n        The else block of the for loop is executed only if the loop completes without break.\n\n        So in the TODO, we should print \"No\" and then break out of the for loop? and then we do t-=1? \n\n        We can do:\n\n          print(\"No\")\n          break\n\n        But what if we break the for loop? Then the else block (which prints \"Yes\") is skipped.\n\n        Example: \n          s = \"abb\", d = 2 (distinct: 'a','b')\n          i=2: s[2]='b', s[0]='a' -> not equal -> then we print \"No\" and break the for loop.\n\n        Then we do t-=1.\n\n        But what if there are multiple mismatches? We only need to print \"No\" once.\n\n        So the missing code is:\n\n          print(\"No\")\n          break\n\n        However, what if we don't break? Then we would print \"No\" and then the for loop would break, and then we do the next test case? \n\n        But the structure: \n          for i in ...:\n              if ...:\n                  print(\"No\")\n                  break\n          else:\n              print(\"Yes\")\n\n        This is correct: if we break out of the for loop, we skip the else block.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          print(\"No\")\n          break\n\n        But note: the problem says: the total length of strings is at most 200000. And we break at the first mismatch.\n\n        This is efficient.\n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n          s = \"aba\": d=2 (distinct: 'a','b')\n            i=2: s[2]='a', s[0]='a' -> equal? so we don't enter the if.\n            i=3? the string length is 3, so we are done? then we print \"Yes\".\n\n          s = \"abb\": d=2\n            i=2: s[2]='b', s[0]='a' -> not equal -> print \"No\" and break.\n\n          s = \"abc\": d=3 -> no iteration? then we print \"Yes\".\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, what about \"aab\": \n          d = 2 (distinct: 'a','b')\n          i=2: s[2]='b', s[0]='a' -> not equal -> print \"No\".\n\n        Correct.\n\n        And \"abcd\": \n          d=4 -> no iteration -> print \"Yes\".\n\n        And \"abcabc\": \n          d=3 -> \n            i=3: s[3]=='a', s[0]=='a' -> equal.\n            i=4: s[4]=='b', s[1]=='b' -> equal.\n            i=5: s[5]=='c', s[2]=='c' -> equal.\n          then print \"Yes\".\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n          print(\"No\")\n          break\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"You may print each letter in any case\", but the example outputs are \"Yes\" and \"No\". The provided code prints \"Yes\" in the else block. We are printing \"No\" in the if block. We must match the case? The problem says: \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" are accepted. We output \"No\" and \"Yes\". That's acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem examples: the first test case output \"YES\", but we output \"Yes\". The problem says: it will be recognized as positive. Similarly, \"No\" is recognized as negative.\n\n        But the problem says: \"print \"YES\" or \"NO\"\", but then says you may print in any case. So we can output \"Yes\" and \"No\".\n\n        Alternatively, we can output \"YES\" and \"NO\"? But the provided code in the else block prints \"Yes\". So we are consistent.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          program1: the code for the if block in the while loop for the test case.\n          program2: the code for the while loop body.\n          program3: the code for the if block in the for loop.\n\n        In JSON format.\n\n        Note: the problem says: Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\n\n        We output:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            s2 += l[p2]\\n            p2 -= 1\\n        continue\",\n            \"program2\": \"ans.append((i, j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\",\n            \"program3\": \"print(\\\"No\\\")\\n            break\"\n          }\n\n        But note: the indentation must match the context.\n\n        For program1.py: the existing code has 8 spaces for the while loop body, and the TODO is at the same level as the if. So we indent the block accordingly.\n\n        We'll output the code as a string with the same indentation level.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the context.\n\n        We assume the existing code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n        In program1.py: \n          The while loop is indented by 4 (from the for loop). Then the if s1==s2: is indented by 8. Then the TODO is at 12? \n\n        We'll write the code for program1.py with 12 spaces for the first line and then more for inner blocks? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the code that goes exactly in the TODO spot.\n\n        So for program1.py, the TODO is at the same level as the comment. We output:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n          if p1 <= p2:\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n          continue\n\n        But we must write it as a string. We use newlines and the same indentation.\n\n        We'll use 8 spaces for the block? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        The TODO is at the same level as the next two ifs. So we can write:\n\n          l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n          if p1 <= p2:\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n          continue\n\n        with the same indentation (each line starting at the same column as the TODO comment).\n\n        But the existing code uses 4-space indentation? \n\n        We'll assume:\n\n          The first line: 12 spaces (because the if block is 8 spaces, and the TODO is inside the if block -> 12 spaces)\n          Then the next lines: 16, 20, etc.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify. We output the code as a string that can be inserted.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          program1: \n            \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            s2 += l[p2]\\n            p2 -= 1\\n        continue\"\n\n        But wait: the existing line after the TODO is:\n\n          if s1 < s2: ...\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with a block of code. We must remove the TODO comment? Actually, the TODO is in a comment. We are to replace the entire line? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the block under the if.\n\n        Actually, the provided code has:\n\n          if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we are to write the code for the block of the if. We write:\n\n          l2.append(...)\n          ... \n          continue\n\n        Then the next two ifs are still there? But we are using 'continue' to skip them.\n\n        So we write the block as multiple lines.\n\n        Similarly for the others.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n          program1: \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            s2 += l[p2]\\n            p2 -= 1\\n        continue\"\n          -> 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the existing if block is indented by 8 (relative to the while). Then the block we are writing is the body of the if, so it should be indented by 12? But the problem does not specify. We'll use 8 for the first line and then 12 for the inner? \n\n        But the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n          if s1 == s2: \n              [our code]\n\n        So our code should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n        We'll write:\n\n          line1: 12 spaces: \"    l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\" -> but wait, the existing line has 8 spaces for the if, then we are at 12 for the body? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the exact indentation? As long as it is valid Python. We'll use:\n\n          program1: \n            \"    l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n    if p1 <= p2:\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\\n    else:\\n        s2 += l[p2]\\n        p2 -= 1\\n    continue\"\n\n        But the context: the while loop is indented by 4, the if by 8, then the body of the if should be 12. \n\n        We'll use 4 more spaces for the body:\n\n          program1: \n            \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            s2 += l[p2]\\n            p2 -= 1\\n        continue\"\n\n        That is: 8 spaces for the first line (because the if is at 4, then the body should be 8? Actually, the existing code has the next two ifs at 8? So we use 8 for the body.\n\n        But the existing code has:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        The two ifs are at the same level as the first if. So the body of the first if should be indented one level more? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n          if s1 == s2: \n              [our code block]\n\n        So we write:\n\n          program1: \n            missing_code = \n                \"l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n\" +\n                \"if p1 <= p2:\\n\" +\n                \"    s1 += l[p1]\\n\" +\n                \"    p1 += 1\\n\" +\n                \"else:\\n\" +\n                \"    s2 += l[p2]\\n\" +\n                \"    p2 -= 1\\n\" +\n                \"continue\"\n\n        But then the entire block is at the same indentation as the next two ifs? That would be 4 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the existing code has 4 spaces for the while body. The if statements are at 8? Then the body of the if should be 12? \n\n        We'll do 12 for the inner if-else? \n\n        But the problem is: we are writing the code that goes in the TODO. We are replacing the entire line that currently has a comment. We are writing a block of code that is the body of the if.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n          program1: \n            \"    l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n    if p1 <= p2:\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\\n    else:\\n        s2 += l[p2]\\n        p2 -= 1\\n    continue\"\n\n        But that is 4, 8, 12? \n\n        Alternatively, we can count the existing indentation: the while loop body is indented by 4. The if is at 4+4=8. Then the body of that if should be 8+4=12. Then the if-else inside should be 12+4=16, etc.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          program1: \n            \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            s2 += l[p2]\\n            p2 -= 1\\n        continue\"\n\n        That is 8 spaces for the first line, 12 for the inner if, 16 for the inner body, and then 8 for the continue? \n\n        Actually, the continue should be at the same level as the first line? \n\n        We'll write:\n\n          program1: \n            missing_code = \n                \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n\" +\n                \"        if p1 <= p2:\\n\" +\n                \"            s1 += l[p1]\\n\" +\n                \"            p1 += 1\\n\" +\n                \"        else:\\n\" +\n                \"            s2 += l[p2]\\n\" +\n                \"            p2 -= 1\\n\" +\n                \"        continue\"\n\n        This is 8 spaces for the first line and the if-else structure, and 12 for the inner assignments.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py: the while loop body is at 4 spaces? The TODO is at 8? Then we write:\n\n          program2: \n            \"    ans.append((i, j))\\n    i += 3\\n    j -= 3\"\n\n        But the existing code: \n            while i<j:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with three lines. We write:\n\n          \"    ans.append((i, j))\\n    i += 3\\n    j -= 3\"\n\n        with 4 spaces for each line? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body is indented by 4. Then the three lines should be at 8? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 for the body? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n          program2: \n            \"        ans.append((i, j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n        For program3.py: the for loop body has an if. The TODO is inside the if. We write:\n\n          program3: \n            \"            print(\\\"No\\\")\\n            break\"\n\n        with 12 spaces? \n\n        But the existing code: \n            for i in range(d, len(s)):\n                if(s[i] != s[i - d]):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                print(\"Yes\")\n\n        The if block is at 8 spaces? Then the body should be 12. \n\n        We write:\n\n          program3: \n            \"    print(\\\"No\\\")\\n    break\"\n\n        But that would be 8 and 8? \n\n        We'll do 12 for both:\n\n          program3: \n            \"        print(\\\"No\\\")\\n        break\"\n\n        However, the problem says: the total of |s| is at most 200000, and we break at the first mismatch.\n\n        We output the JSON.\n\n        Note: we must escape the quotes.\n\n        Final JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            s2 += l[p2]\\n            p2 -= 1\\n        continue\",\n            \"program2\": \"        ans.append((i, j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\",\n            \"program3\": \"        print(\\\"No\\\")\\n        break\"\n          }\n\n        But wait: in program3, the break is to break out of the for loop? Then we do the next test case.\n\n        We output that."
