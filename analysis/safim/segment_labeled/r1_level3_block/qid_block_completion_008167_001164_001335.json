We note that zeros are helpful because:\n  - Once we have two zeros, we can use one zero and one non-zero to set the non-zero to zero (if we choose two non-zeros and one of them is zero, then we set the non-zero to min(0, non-zero)=0? But note: min(0, non-zero) is 0, so we set both to 0? Actually, the operation says: if they are not equal, set both to min. So if we have (0, x) with x != 0, then we set both to 0. So one operation removes one non-zero and leaves the zero (which we already had). But note: we set both to 0, so we actually set the non-zero to 0 and the zero remains 0. However, the problem is to minimize the number of operations. We can think greedily:\n\nLet:\n  - Let c0 = count of zeros in the array.",

Then we can use the zero to eliminate the rest non-zeros: one operation per non-zero? So total operations = 2 (to create the first zero) + (n-2) = n. But wait: we started with n non-zeros. After the first two operations, we have one zero and (n-1) non-zeros? Actually, we started with n non-zeros. We changed two of them: first to two duplicates (so still two non-zeros) and then we set one of the duplicates to zero -> so we have one zero and one non-zero (from the duplicate) and the other (n-2) non-zeros? So total non-zeros is 1 + (n-2) = n-1? Then we need to eliminate n-1 non-zeros. Each non-zero can be eliminated by pairing with the zero: one operation per non-zero. So total operations = 2 (to get the first zero) + (n-1) = n+1? But the example: [1,2,3] (n=3, no zeros initially) -> \n  Operation1: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,3] -> non-zeros: 3 (but two of them are 1 and one 3) -> but we have two 1's?

So for n=3, we have 4 operations = 3+1? But 3+1 = 4, so that matches. But what if we have duplicates? Example: [1,1,2] (n=3, no zeros initially)\n  We can do: Operation1: set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 2. Then we can set 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,2] -> then set 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations. But according to the above: \n  We have one duplicate, so we create the first zero in one operation. Then we have two non-zeros left? Then we need two more operations? Total 3. But if we use the formula: \n  If there is at least one duplicate, then we can create the first zero in one operation and then we have (n-1) non-zeros? Then we need (n-1) operations? So total = 1 + (n-1) = n? For n=3, that would be 3? But wait: after the first operation, we have one zero and two non-zeros. Then we can eliminate the two non-zeros in two operations? So total 3. But what if we have more duplicates? Example: [1,1,1] (n=3, no zeros initially)\n  Operation1: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] -> non-zeros: two 1's and one zero. Then we can set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations. But we can do better? Operation1: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] \n  Operation2: set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations. Alternatively, we can do:\n  Operation1: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> that's two operations? But wait: the operation: we choose two numbers. In [0,1,1], we can choose the two 1's: then we set one of them to 0? Then we get [0,0,1]? Or can we set both to 0? The operation: \n  If a_i = a_j, change one of them to 0. So we only change one of them to 0. So we cannot set both to 0 in one operation? Therefore, we have to do: [1,1,1] -> Operation1: set two 1's -> [0,1,1] (we set one to 0)\n  Operation2: set the two 1's -> [0,0,1] (we set one to 0)\n  Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0] (we set the 1 to 0) So 3 operations. But note: we can also do: Operation1: set two 1's -> [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: set the 0 and one 1 -> set both to 0? Because 0 != 1 -> set both to min(0,1)=0 -> so we set the 1 to 0 and the 0 remains? Then we get [0,0,1]? Then Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0]. So we cannot avoid 3 operations. Therefore, the formula:\n\nLet c0 = initial zeros. We have non_zeros = n - c0. If c0 > 0:\n  Then we can eliminate each non-zero in one operation (by pairing with a zero). So total operations = non_zeros. But wait: what if we have multiple zeros?

So we miss a=6? But a=6: we don't want it because it fails the condition. But what if we have a valid a=half_perimeter? \n\n   Example: w=3, l=3 -> half_perimeter=4. divisors: 1,2,4.\n        a=4: \n            w=3: 3%4=3>2 -> invalid.

Therefore, the code is safe. But what about a=1 and a=2? They are in the initial set. However, we should also check the condition for a=1 and a=2? For a=1: \n            w % 1 = 0 <=2 -> valid. l % 1 = 0 <=2 -> valid. For a=2: \n            w % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> valid. l % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> valid. So they are always valid. Therefore, the TODO in program2.py is to add the condition for l % a and then add a to solutions. Specifically, replace the TODO with:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the variable `a` might be very large? but the condition is mathematical.",

So the completed code for the for-loop:\n\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1): if half_perimeter % i != 0:\n                continue\n            for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]: if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the initial set already has 1 and 2. However, what if a=1 or a=2 appears as a divisor in the loop? then we add them again? but set will remove duplicates. So it's fine. But what if half_perimeter=1? then the loop does not run? but w,l>=3, so half_perimeter>=4. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But wait, the code currently has:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:   # mod_a = w % a\n            # then we do the above for l? So we can replace the TODO with:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: we might also want to check if a is at least 1? and we are only adding if both conditions hold. Actually, the condition for a to be valid is that both w % a <=2 and l % a <=2. So we should change the code to:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a) But the TODO is inside the if mod_a<=2, so we can do:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a) But then if w % a<=2 is true and l % a<=2 is true, we add. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a) But the TODO is only one line. Given the structure, I think the intended completion is to add a to solutions if also l % a <=2. So I'll write:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a) But note: the condition on w % a is already checked in the outer if. So it is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:   # which is w % a <= 2\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a) But we can also do:\n\n        solutions.add(a)   # only if both conditions hold, but the TODO is inside the if. However, the condition on l is not checked yet. Therefore, the completion is to check l % a and then add. So the code becomes:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                if l % a <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition for a=1 and a=2 are already in the set initially, and they will be added again? but set will handle duplicates. So it's fine. But what if a is very large? for example, a = half_perimeter//i might be large, but the modulus operations are cheap for integers up to 10^9. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the variable `a` might be the same as one already in the set? then it is a no-op. So we output: \" if l % a <= 2:\\n                solutions.add(a)\"\n\n   However, the TODO is only one line? but the provided TODO is in a comment and then a blank.

The roundest: the number with the maximum number of trailing zeros. If there are several, choose the maximal price. If it is impossible to get a rounder price (than the current n*m? or than the current state?) -> output n*m. The current price is n. We can multiply by k in [1, m] to get n*k. We are to find k in [1, m] that maximizes the number of trailing zeros in n*k, and among those, the maximal n*k. The approach in the code:\n\n        Factorize n: n = 2^a * 5^b * c, where c is not divisible by 2 or 5. Then, we want to maximize the number of trailing zeros = min(exponent of 2, exponent of 5) in n*k. We can multiply by t (which is initially 1) to balance the factors of 2 and 5. If a > b: then we have more 2s, so we want to multiply by 5 as many times as possible (to get more 5s) until b becomes >=a? but note, we are limited by m.\n\n        Similarly, if b > a, we multiply by 2.",

So the TODO is:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n        But note: the condition is: while b > a and 2 * t <= m. So we do:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n        Then, after that, we then multiply by 10 as long as we can. Then, we let k = the largest multiple of t that is <= m? k = m - (m % t) Then the new price = n * k.\n\n        Why is that? Example: n=6, m=11. n=6 = 2^1 * 3, so a=1, b=0. a>0, so we enter the first if: \n                while 1>0 and 5*t (t=1) < =11 -> true, so t=5, b becomes 1 (but wait, we didn't change b in the code? Actually, in the code for a> b: \n            we do: t *= 5, and then b += 1? But b is the exponent of 5 in the factorization of n, and we are multiplying by 5, so we are increasing the exponent of 5 by 1.\n\n        Similarly, for b>a: we multiply by 2 and increase a by 1. For n=6: \n            after the first while: t=5, b becomes 1? then we have a=1, b=1 -> balanced. then we do: while 10*t=50<=11? false, so t remains 5. then k = 11 - (11 % 5) = 11 - 1 = 10. then new price = 6*10 = 60. This matches the sample. Example: n=5, m=43.\n            n=5: a=0, b=1. then we enter the elif: b>a -> true. while 1>0 and 2*t (t=1)<=43 -> true, so we do t=2, a=1. then a=1, b=1 -> balanced. then while 10*2=20<=43 -> true, so t=20. then while 10*20=200>43 -> stop. then k = 43 - (43 % 20) = 43 - 3 = 40. new price = 5*40=200. Example: n=13, m=5.\n            n=13: a=0, b=0. skip both if and elif. then while 10*1=10>5 -> skip. then k = 5 - (5%1)=5-0=5. new price = 13*5=65. Example: the fourth test case: not provided. Example: the fifth test case: n=1, m=12000? \n            n=1: a=0, b=0. skip the if and elif. then we multiply t by 10 as long as 10*t<=12000.\n                t=1 -> 10<=12000 -> t=10\n                then 100<=12000 -> t=100\n                then 1000<=12000 -> t=1000\n                then 10000<=12000 -> t=10000\n                then 100000>12000 -> stop. then k = 12000 - (12000 % 10000) = 12000 - 2000 = 10000? then new price = 1 * 10000 = 10000. But the sample says \"increase the price 12000 times\", meaning k=12000? then the new price = 1*12000 = 12000. Which has 3 trailing zeros? 10000 has 4 trailing zeros, 12000 has 3. So 10000 is rounder than 12000. Therefore, the code is correct. So the TODO for program3.py is:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n        But note: the code in the TODO block is inside the while loop. We must be careful: the while condition is: while b>a and 2*t<=m. So we do:\n\n            t = t * 2\n            a = a + 1\n\n        This will increase a by one and multiply t by 2. Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n   But note: the code is in the body of the while loop. We output the two lines.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to 0.\n\nObservations:\nThe operation: \n  - If two chosen numbers are equal, we can set one of them to 0.\n  - Otherwise (they are different), we set both to the minimum of the two.\n\nWe note that zeros are helpful because:\n  - Once we have two zeros, we can use one zero and one non-zero to set the non-zero to zero (if we choose two non-zeros and one of them is zero, then we set the non-zero to min(0, non-zero)=0? But note: min(0, non-zero) is 0, so we set both to 0? Actually, the operation says: if they are not equal, set both to min. So if we have (0, x) with x != 0, then we set both to 0. So one operation removes one non-zero and leaves the zero (which we already had). But note: we set both to 0, so we actually set the non-zero to 0 and the zero remains 0.\n\nHowever, the problem is to minimize the number of operations.\n\nWe can think greedily:\n\nLet:\n  - Let c0 = count of zeros in the array.\n\nWe note that we can use zeros to eliminate non-zeros in one operation per non-zero (by pairing a non-zero with a zero). But note: when we pair a non-zero with a zero, we set both to 0. So we actually create an extra zero? Actually, we start with one zero and one non-zero. After the operation, we have two zeros. So then we can use the two zeros to eliminate two non-zeros? Actually, we can only eliminate one non-zero per zero? Because we need to pair a non-zero with a zero. But note: we can pair two non-zeros together as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider:\n\nStep 1: We can try to create as many zeros as possible in the beginning.\n\nBut note the operation:\n  - If we have two equal non-zeros, we can set one to zero (so we get one zero and one non-zero remains). Then we can use that zero to eliminate the other non-zeros? \n\nHowever, the example: [1,2,3] -> \n  Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> set both to 1 -> [1,1,3]\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,3]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,3]\n  Operation4: choose 0 and 3 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0]\n\nBut note: we can also do:\n  Operation1: choose 1 and 3 -> set both to 1 -> [1,2,1]\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's (at index0 and index2) -> set one to 0 -> [0,2,1]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,1]\n  Operation4: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0]\n\nSo 4 operations.\n\nHow about if we have duplicates? \n\nLet d = the number of distinct non-zero numbers? \n\nBut note: we can also use the fact that if we have two distinct numbers, we can set both to the minimum. Then we create duplicates.\n\nActually, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. We want to eliminate all non-zeros. We note that an operation can:\n   - If we choose two non-zeros that are equal: we set one to 0 and the other remains. So we reduce the count of non-zeros by 1 (because we set one to zero) and the other remains? Actually, we set one to zero and the other remains the same? But then we have one less non-zero? Actually, we started with two non-zeros (equal) and we end with one non-zero and one zero. So we reduce the non-zero count by 1 and add one zero.\n\n   - If we choose two non-zeros that are different: we set both to the minimum. Then we have two numbers that are the same. So we can then use the next operation to set one of them to zero? \n\nBut note: we can combine two operations to eliminate two non-zeros? \n\nActually, consider two distinct non-zeros: x and y (x<y). \n  Operation1: set both to x -> [x, x, ...]\n  Operation2: set the two x's: set one to 0 -> [0, x, ...]\n  Then we have one zero and one non-zero. Then we can use the zero to eliminate the non-zero in one more operation: set 0 and x -> both to 0. \n  So total 3 operations to eliminate two non-zeros? \n\nBut wait, we have two non-zeros and we end up with two zeros? So we eliminated two non-zeros in 3 operations? \n\nAlternatively, we can eliminate one non-zero by turning it into zero by pairing with a zero? That takes 1 operation per non-zero if we already have a zero.\n\nSo the process:\n\nWe start with an array of non-zeros and zeros.\n\nWe can create zeros by:\n  - If we have two equal non-zeros, we can set one to zero (1 operation) and then we have one zero and one non-zero (which we can then use to eliminate the non-zero in one more operation: pair the non-zero with the zero -> set both to zero? Actually, that would set the non-zero to zero and the zero remains? But then we have two zeros. So two operations to eliminate two non-zeros? \n\nBut wait: \n  Operation1: two equal non-zeros (say x,x) -> set one to zero: [0, x, ...] -> one non-zero eliminated? Actually, we started with two non-zeros and we end with one non-zero and one zero. So we eliminated one non-zero in one operation.\n\n  Then Operation2: we can use the zero to eliminate the remaining x: set both to zero -> [0,0,...] -> we eliminated the second non-zero in the second operation.\n\nSo two operations to eliminate two non-zeros? \n\nBut what if we have two distinct non-zeros? \n  Operation1: set both to the minimum -> [x, x, ...] (if we had x and y, and x<y, then we set both to x). Then we have two equal non-zeros. Then Operation2: set one to zero -> [0, x, ...]. Then Operation3: set the zero and the x to zero -> [0,0,...]. So three operations to eliminate two non-zeros.\n\nTherefore, the strategy:\n\nWe want to minimize the operations. We can use zeros to eliminate non-zeros in one operation per non-zero. So we want to create zeros as early as possible.\n\nBut note: we can also use the fact that if we have a duplicate, we can create a zero in one operation and then use that zero to eliminate the other non-zeros one by one.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nLet:\n  c0 = count of zeros initially.\n\nThen, we have (n - c0) non-zeros.\n\nWe can create zeros from non-zeros by:\n\n  - If we have at least one duplicate (two same non-zeros), then we can create a zero in one operation and then we have one more zero. Then we can use that zero to eliminate the rest non-zeros? \n\nBut note: when we create a zero from a duplicate, we set one of the duplicates to zero and the other remains. So we don't eliminate both at once. We only eliminate one.\n\nAlternatively, we can think:\n\nWe can eliminate one non-zero by turning it into zero by pairing it with an existing zero (if there is at least one zero) in one operation.\n\nBut if there is no zero initially, we have to create the first zero. How?\n\n  - If there is a duplicate: we can create a zero in one operation (and then we have one zero and one less non-zero). Then we can use that zero to eliminate the rest non-zeros (each one operation per non-zero). So total operations = 1 (to create the first zero) + (remaining non-zeros) = (n - c0) [because we started with no zeros, then we create one zero and then we have (n-1) non-zeros left, then we eliminate each of them in one operation: so total = 1 + (n-1) = n? \n\n  - If there is no duplicate: then we have to create a duplicate? How? We can take two distinct non-zeros and set both to the minimum. Then we have two equal numbers. Then we can create a zero from that duplicate in the next operation. Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros. Then we eliminate the rest non-zeros one by one. \n\nSo for two distinct non-zeros: \n  Operation1: set both to min -> now we have two duplicates (and the rest non-zeros remain). \n  Operation2: set one of the duplicates to zero -> now we have one zero and one non-zero (from the duplicate that we set to zero, and the other duplicate remains? Actually, we set one of the duplicates to zero and the other remains? Then we have one zero and one non-zero (from the duplicate) and the rest non-zeros? Actually, we only changed two numbers. So we have one zero and (n-1) non-zeros? \n\nBut wait: we started with two distinct non-zeros and we turned them into two duplicates? Then we set one of the duplicates to zero. So we have one zero and one non-zero (the duplicate that we didn't set to zero) and the rest non-zeros? So we have (n-1) non-zeros? \n\nThen we can use the zero to eliminate the rest non-zeros: one operation per non-zero? So total operations = 2 (to create the first zero) + (n-2) = n.\n\nBut wait: we started with n non-zeros. After the first two operations, we have one zero and (n-1) non-zeros? Actually, we started with n non-zeros. We changed two of them: first to two duplicates (so still two non-zeros) and then we set one of the duplicates to zero -> so we have one zero and one non-zero (from the duplicate) and the other (n-2) non-zeros? So total non-zeros is 1 + (n-2) = n-1? \n\nThen we need to eliminate n-1 non-zeros. Each non-zero can be eliminated by pairing with the zero: one operation per non-zero. So total operations = 2 (to get the first zero) + (n-1) = n+1? \n\nBut the example: [1,2,3] (n=3, no zeros initially) -> \n  Operation1: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,3] -> non-zeros: 3 (but two of them are 1 and one 3) -> but we have two 1's? \n  Operation2: set one of the 1's to 0 -> [0,1,3] -> non-zeros: 2 (1 and 3)\n  Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,3] -> non-zeros: 1\n  Operation4: set 0 and 3 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 4 operations.\n\nSo for n=3, we have 4 operations = 3+1? \n\nBut 3+1 = 4, so that matches.\n\nBut what if we have duplicates? \n\nExample: [1,1,2] (n=3, no zeros initially)\n  We can do:\n    Operation1: set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 2.\n    Then we can set 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,2] -> then set 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\nBut according to the above: \n  We have one duplicate, so we create the first zero in one operation. Then we have two non-zeros left? Then we need two more operations? Total 3.\n\nBut if we use the formula: \n  If there is at least one duplicate, then we can create the first zero in one operation and then we have (n-1) non-zeros? Then we need (n-1) operations? So total = 1 + (n-1) = n? For n=3, that would be 3? \n\nBut wait: after the first operation, we have one zero and two non-zeros. Then we can eliminate the two non-zeros in two operations? So total 3.\n\nBut what if we have more duplicates? \n\nExample: [1,1,1] (n=3, no zeros initially)\n  Operation1: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] -> non-zeros: two 1's and one zero.\n  Then we can set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\nBut we can do better? \n  Operation1: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] \n  Operation2: set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n  Operation1: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: set the two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> that's two operations? \n\nBut wait: the operation: we choose two numbers. In [0,1,1], we can choose the two 1's: then we set one of them to 0? Then we get [0,0,1]? Or can we set both to 0? \n\nThe operation: \n  If a_i = a_j, change one of them to 0. \nSo we only change one of them to 0. So we cannot set both to 0 in one operation? \n\nTherefore, we have to do:\n\n  [1,1,1] -> Operation1: set two 1's -> [0,1,1] (we set one to 0)\n  Operation2: set the two 1's -> [0,0,1] (we set one to 0)\n  Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0] (we set the 1 to 0)\n\nSo 3 operations.\n\nBut note: we can also do:\n  Operation1: set two 1's -> [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: set the 0 and one 1 -> set both to 0? Because 0 != 1 -> set both to min(0,1)=0 -> so we set the 1 to 0 and the 0 remains? Then we get [0,0,1]? Then Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0]. \n\nSo we cannot avoid 3 operations.\n\nTherefore, the formula:\n\nLet c0 = initial zeros.\n\nWe have non_zeros = n - c0.\n\nIf c0 > 0:\n  Then we can eliminate each non-zero in one operation (by pairing with a zero). So total operations = non_zeros.\n\nBut wait: what if we have multiple zeros? We don't need to use the same zero every time? Actually, we can use any zero. And when we set a non-zero to zero, we get an extra zero. So we start with c0 zeros. Then we can eliminate the first non-zero: we get c0+1 zeros. Then the next non-zero: we get c0+2 zeros, etc. So we can eliminate all non_zeros in non_zeros operations.\n\nBut what if we have no zeros initially?\n\n  If there is at least one duplicate in the non-zeros? Then we can create the first zero in one operation. Then we have non_zeros - 1 non-zeros and one zero. Then we can eliminate the remaining non_zeros in (non_zeros - 1) operations. So total = 1 + (non_zeros - 1) = non_zeros.\n\n  If there is no duplicate? Then we have to create a duplicate? How? We take two distinct non-zeros and set both to the minimum (which creates two duplicates) in one operation. Then we have non_zeros - 2 + 2 = non_zeros non-zeros? Actually, we changed two non-zeros to two duplicates. Then we can create a zero from the duplicates in the next operation: set one of the duplicates to zero. Then we have one zero and non_zeros - 1 non-zeros. Then we eliminate the non_zeros - 1 non-zeros in (non_zeros - 1) operations. So total = 2 + (non_zeros - 1) = non_zeros + 1.\n\nBut note: after the first operation, we have two duplicates? Then we have non_zeros non-zeros? Actually, we started with non_zeros non-zeros. We changed two of them to two duplicates (so we still have non_zeros non-zeros, but now two of them are duplicates). Then we set one of the duplicates to zero: so we have non_zeros - 1 non-zeros. \n\nSo the total operations = \n  if c0 > 0: non_zeros\n  else:\n        if there is at least one duplicate: non_zeros\n        else: non_zeros + 1\n\nBut note: what if we have multiple duplicates? The above holds because we only need one duplicate to create the first zero.\n\nHowever, we must note: if we have no zeros initially, but we have a duplicate, then we can create the first zero in one operation and then we have non_zeros-1 non-zeros? Actually, we started with non_zeros non-zeros. We set one of the duplicates to zero: so we reduce the non_zeros by one? Then we have non_zeros-1 non-zeros. Then we eliminate them in non_zeros-1 operations. So total = 1 + (non_zeros-1) = non_zeros.\n\nBut if we have no duplicate, then we do two operations to get the first zero and then non_zeros-1 non-zeros? Then total = 2 + (non_zeros-1) = non_zeros+1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  non_zeros = n - c0\n\n  if c0 > 0:\n      ans = non_zeros\n  else:\n      # Check if there is at least one duplicate in the non-zero part?\n      # But note: if there is a duplicate, then we can do in non_zeros operations, else non_zeros+1.\n      # How to check for duplicate? We can use a set.\n\n      if len(set(a)) == n:   # meaning all distinct? then no duplicate\n          ans = non_zeros + 1\n      else:\n          ans = non_zeros\n\nBut wait: what if we have zeros and duplicates? Then we don't need the duplicate? Because we already have zeros. So we don't care about duplicates if we have zeros.\n\nBut note: the zeros are already present. So we don't need to create a zero.\n\nSo the code for program1.py:\n\nWe are reading t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n  n = int(input())\n  a = list of n integers\n\n  c0 = count of zeros in a\n  non_zeros = n - c0\n\n  if c0 > 0:\n      ans = non_zeros\n  else:\n      # if there is at least one duplicate in the entire array (but note: if there is a duplicate in the non-zeros, then we can use that) \n      # but if there is a duplicate, then the set of non-zeros will have size < non_zeros.\n      if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n          ans = non_zeros + 1\n      else:\n          ans = non_zeros\n\nBut wait: what if we have zeros? Then we skip the else. So we don't check the set? That's correct.\n\nBut note: if we have zeros, then we don't care about duplicates? Because we can use the zeros to eliminate non-zeros.\n\nHowever, what if we have zeros and duplicates? Then we don't need the duplicates? Because we already have zeros. So we don't use the duplicates? We just use the zeros to eliminate the non-zeros one by one.\n\nTherefore, the above code should work.\n\nBut let's test with the example: [1,2,3] -> no zeros, and all distinct -> ans = 3+1 = 4 -> matches.\n\nExample: [1,1,2] -> no zeros, but not distinct (because two 1's) -> ans = 3 -> matches.\n\nExample: [0,1,2] -> c0=1, non_zeros=2 -> ans=2 -> \n  Operation1: 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,2] \n  Operation2: 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 2 operations -> matches.\n\nBut what if we have [0,0,1,2]? \n  c0=2, non_zeros=2 -> ans=2.\n  Operation1: 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0,2] -> then Operation2: 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0,0] -> 2 operations.\n\nBut what if we have [0,1,1,2]? \n  c0=1, non_zeros=3 -> ans=3.\n  Operation1: 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,1,2] -> now we have two zeros and two non-zeros.\n  Operation2: 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0,2]\n  Operation3: 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\nBut note: we could also do:\n  Operation1: the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,0,1,2] -> then we have two zeros and two non-zeros? Then we can eliminate the 1 and 2 in two operations? So total 3 operations.\n\nSo the answer is 3.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    c0 = a.count(0)\n    non_zeros = n - c0\n    if c0 > 0:\n        return non_zeros\n    else:\n        if len(set(a)) < n:\n            return non_zeros\n        else:\n            return non_zeros + 1\n\nBut note: the condition for duplicate: if there is any duplicate, then the set will have size less than n. So we can write:\n\n        if len(set(a)) == n:\n            return non_zeros + 1\n        else:\n            return non_zeros\n\nBut note: if there is a duplicate, then the set size is less than n. So we return non_zeros.\n\nWe return the integer.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the body of the solve function.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given w and l.\n\nWe are to find the number of valid values of a (sorted) such that Bethany can tile the bathroom.\n\nThe tiling:\n  - The interior: (w-2)*(l-2) tiles of 1x1.\n  - The boundary: tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated, so effectively a can be the length along the boundary).\n\nThe boundary has:\n  - The entire perimeter is 2*(w+l) - 4 (because we subtract the four corners? Actually, the boundary is the outer ring. The interior is (w-2)*(l-2). The total tiles = w*l = (w-2)*(l-2) + (boundary tiles). So the boundary tiles = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 4 + 2*(w-2) + 2*(l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4.\n\nBut note: the boundary is made of four sides. The two sides of length w and two of length l. But the corners are shared? So the total boundary tiles = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\nWe are going to use tiles of size 1xa. The entire boundary must be tiled by these tiles. The tiles can be placed horizontally or vertically. So the condition is that the total boundary tiles must be divisible by a? And also, the boundary must be divisible in such a way that each side can be tiled? \n\nBut note: the boundary is composed of four sides. Each side must be divisible by a? Actually, not exactly: because the tiles can wrap the corners? But the problem says: the tiles are 1xa and can be rotated by 90 degrees. However, the problem does not allow breaking tiles. \n\nBut note: the boundary is a closed loop. We can break the loop arbitrarily? Actually, the problem does not specify. However, the note in the problem says: the three tilings for (3,5) are represented in pictures. \n\nLooking at the pictures (if we recall): \n  For a=1: we use 1x1 tiles on the boundary? Then we use 2*(w+l)-4 tiles? which is divisible by 1? and we can tile each side independently? \n  For a=2: we use 1x2 tiles. The total boundary tiles = 2*(3+5)-4 = 12, which is divisible by 2. And we can place the tiles horizontally and vertically? \n  For a=3: similarly.\n\nBut what about a=4? 12 is divisible by 4? 12/4=3. But can we tile the boundary? \n  The sides: \n    top: 5 -> we can put one tile of 1x4 and then we have 1 left? \n    bottom: 5 -> same.\n    left: 3 -> 3 is not divisible by 4? \n    right: 3 -> same.\n\nBut note: the tile can wrap the corner? Actually, the problem does not specify. However, the note says: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\". But that only allows using the tile in two orientations: 1xa and ax1. \n\nBut the boundary is a continuous loop? The problem does not say we can break the boundary arbitrarily. We have to tile each side independently? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"on the floor boundary\". The boundary is the union of the four sides. And the tiles are placed on the boundary. The tile of size 1xa can be placed along the side. But if a is greater than the side, we cannot use it? \n\nBut note: the tile can be placed on two adjacent sides? The problem does not explicitly forbid that. However, the example a=3 for (3,5) is valid? \n\nLooking at the example: \n  w=3, l=5 -> boundary: \n    top: 5, bottom: 5, left: 3, right: 3 -> total 16? But wait: the corners are counted twice? Actually, the boundary tiles: \n      total = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 15 - 1*3 = 12? \n\nSo the boundary has 12 tiles. \n\nFor a=3: we need 12/3=4 tiles. How to place? \n  We can put one tile on the top and then wrap to the right? But the top is 5, which is not divisible by 3? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the boundary arbitrarily? Actually, the problem does not require the tile to be confined to one side. \n\nBut the note says: \"The three tilings are represented in the following pictures.\" So we can look at the sample tilings? \n\nIn the sample, for a=3: \n  They use 4 tiles of 1x3. \n  How? \n    On the top: they put one tile covering 3 tiles? Then the top has 5, so 2 left? \n    Then the next tile: they put on the top right corner? and then goes down the right side? \n\nActually, the tile can wrap the corner? \n\nBut the problem does not explicitly say that the tile must be placed entirely on one side. \n\nTherefore, we can assume that the entire boundary is a continuous loop and we can break it arbitrarily? Then the condition is that the total boundary tiles (which is 2*(w+l)-4) must be divisible by a? \n\nBut wait: the example (3,5): \n  total boundary = 2*(3+5)-4 = 12? \n  Then a must be a divisor of 12? and a>=1. \n\nBut the divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the problem says the valid a for (3,5) are 1,2,3. \n\nSo why 4,6,12 are not valid? \n\nBecause the tile of size 1x4: we cannot place it without breaking? \n\nBut note: the tile must cover consecutive tiles? And the boundary is a cycle of 12 tiles. We can break the cycle arbitrarily? Then we can use 3 tiles of 1x4? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees\", meaning we can use them as 1x4 or 4x1? But the boundary is 1 tile wide? So we can only use 1x4? \n\nBut 1x4 tile: we can place it along the boundary? \n\nHowever, the problem also requires that the interior is (w-2)*(l-2) of 1x1 tiles. So the boundary must be exactly the outer ring. \n\nBut why a=4 is not valid? \n\nLet me try to tile the boundary of (3,5) with 1x4 tiles. \n  The boundary: \n    Let me label the boundary:\n\n        top: [0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [0,4]   -> 5 tiles\n        right: [1,4], [2,4] -> 2 tiles? (because the top right corner [0,4] is already counted and the bottom right corner [3,4] doesn't exist? because w=3 -> rows 0,1,2? and l=5 -> columns 0,1,2,3,4? \n        bottom: [2,0], [2,1], [2,2], [2,3] -> 4 tiles? (because the bottom left and bottom right are not included? \n        left: [1,0] -> 1 tile? \n\nWait, that doesn't add to 12. \n\nActually, the boundary tiles: \n  top: 5\n  bottom: 5\n  left: 3 (but subtract the top and bottom corners) -> 3-2 = 1? \n  right: 3-2=1? \n  total = 5+5+1+1 = 12? \n\nBut that is not contiguous? \n\nAlternatively, we can think of the boundary as a cycle of 12 tiles. \n\nBut the problem is: the tile of 1x4 must cover 4 consecutive tiles? \n\nBut the boundary has corners. At the corner, the tile must turn? \n\nThe problem does not say that the tile must be placed in a straight line. It can be bent? But the tile is 1xa: it is a straight tile. \n\nTherefore, the tile must be placed in a straight segment? \n\nSo we have four straight segments: \n  top: length = l = 5\n  bottom: length = l = 5\n  left: length = w-2 = 1\n  right: length = w-2 = 1\n\nBut wait: the corners? The corners are included in the top and bottom? \n\nActually, the boundary has:\n  top: from (0,0) to (0,l-1) -> l tiles\n  bottom: from (w-1,0) to (w-1,l-1) -> l tiles\n  left: from (1,0) to (w-2,0) -> w-2 tiles\n  right: from (1,l-1) to (w-2,l-1) -> w-2 tiles\n\nTotal = 2*l + 2*(w-2) = 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12? \n\nBut note: the corners are included in the top and bottom. \n\nSo the four segments are independent? \n\nTherefore, the tile of 1xa must be placed entirely within one segment? \n\nThen the condition: \n  For each segment, the length of the segment must be divisible by a? \n\nBut wait: the tile can be rotated? So we can use the tile as 1xa or a x 1? But the boundary is 1 tile wide? So we can only use 1xa? \n\nTherefore, the condition for a segment of length L is that L must be divisible by a? \n\nBut we have four segments: two of length l and two of length w-2? \n\nBut note: the top and bottom are of length l? and the left and right are of length w-2? \n\nSo the conditions:\n  a must divide the top and bottom: so a must divide l? \n  and a must divide the left and right: so a must divide w-2? \n\nBut wait: what if a=1? then it divides everything? \n\nBut the example: a=3 for (3,5): \n  l=5 -> 5 % 3 != 0 -> fails? \n\nBut the example says a=3 is valid. \n\nSo what is the catch? \n\nLooking at the picture: \n  They use a tile that covers the top and then wraps to the right? \n\nBut the problem says: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\". This might allow the tile to be placed on two adjacent sides? \n\nBut the tile is 1xa: it is a straight tile. How can it cover a corner? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow the tile to be placed on two adjacent sides if the corner is covered? \n\nBut the tile is 1xa: it is a straight tile. It cannot bend. \n\nTherefore, we must consider that the tile can be placed on one side? \n\nBut then how is a=3 valid for (3,5)? \n\nAnother possibility: the boundary is a cycle? Then we can break the cycle arbitrarily? Then the condition is that the entire boundary (12) is divisible by a? and also the tile must not require a segment longer than the side? \n\nBut note: the tile is straight. So if we break the cycle at a corner, then we have a straight segment that goes from one corner to the next? \n\nThe boundary has four corners. The segments between two corners are of length l and w-2? \n\nBut if we break at a corner, then the entire boundary becomes a straight line? Then we can use tiles of 1xa? Then the condition is that the total boundary length (2*(w+l)-4) must be divisible by a? \n\nBut then why a=3 is valid for (3,5): 12 divisible by 3 -> valid. \n\nBut then why a=4 is not valid? 12 divisible by 4 -> valid? \n\nBut the problem says the valid a for (3,5) are 1,2,3. \n\nSo what is the problem with a=4? \n\nThe tile of 1x4: we have to place it on the boundary without bending. The boundary is a cycle of 12. We can break the cycle at a corner? Then we have a straight line of 12? Then we can place three tiles of 1x4? \n\nBut the problem is: the tile must be placed on the boundary? and the boundary is the union of the four sides? \n\nHowever, the tile of 1x4 must cover 4 consecutive tiles. But the boundary has corners: at the corner, the direction changes. \n\nSo if we place a tile that covers a corner, then the tile would have to bend? which is not allowed. \n\nTherefore, the tile must be placed entirely on one side? \n\nBut then a=3: \n  top: 5 % 3 != 0 -> fails.\n  bottom: same.\n  left: 1 % 3 != 0 -> fails.\n  right: same.\n\nSo a=3 would be invalid? \n\nBut the example says it is valid. \n\nLooking at the sample tiling for a=3: \n  The picture: \n    They show one tile covering the top row from (0,0) to (0,2) -> 3 tiles? \n    Then another tile covering the top row from (0,3) to (0,4) and then down to (1,4) -> that's 3 tiles? \n    Then another tile covering the bottom row from (2,0) to (2,2) -> 3 tiles? \n    Then another tile covering the bottom row from (2,3) to (2,4) and then up to (1,4) -> but wait, (1,4) is already covered? \n\nActually, the picture might be different. \n\nAfter checking the problem statement: \n  The first test case: w=3, l=5 -> valid a: 1,2,3.\n\nAnd the picture: \n  For a=3: \n      They show the boundary divided into four segments: \n        top: 3 tiles (from (0,0) to (0,2))\n        then a tile that covers (0,3), (0,4), (1,4) -> 3 tiles? \n        then a tile that covers (2,4), (2,3), (2,2) -> 3 tiles? \n        then a tile that covers (2,1), (2,0), (1,0) -> 3 tiles? \n\nBut note: the interior is (1,1) to (1,3) -> 3 tiles of 1x1.\n\nSo the tile can wrap the corners? \n\nBut the tile is straight? How can it cover (0,4) and then (1,4)? That is a vertical segment? \n\nThe tile is 1x3: it can be placed vertically? \n\nBut then the tile covering (0,3), (0,4), (1,4) is not straight: it goes right then down? \n\nUnless the tile is placed in an L-shape? \n\nBut the problem says: tiles of size 1xa. And they can be rotated by 90 degrees. But that only changes the orientation from horizontal to vertical. It does not allow L-shape. \n\nTherefore, the tile must be placed in a straight line horizontally or vertically. \n\nBut then the sample tiling for a=3 is not valid? \n\nHowever, the problem says it is valid. \n\nRe-reading the problem: \n  \"On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1\u00d7a for some positive integer a. The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees.\"\n\nAnd the picture for a=3: \n  It shows four tiles, each covering three consecutive boundary tiles? and each tile is placed in a straight line? \n\nBut the boundary is not straight? \n\nActually, the boundary is the outer ring. The tile can be placed along the boundary in a straight line? But the boundary has corners. \n\nThe only way is to break the boundary at the corners and have four independent segments. \n\nBut then a must divide each segment length? \n\nBut the segment lengths are:\n  top: l = 5\n  bottom: l = 5\n  left: w-2 = 1\n  right: w-2 = 1\n\nSo a must divide 5 and 1? -> a=1.\n\nBut the problem says a=2 and a=3 are valid. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow the tile to be placed on two adjacent sides if we consider the corner as part of both? \n\nBut then the segment from the top to the right would be: from (0,0) to (0,4) and then to (2,4) -> but that is not straight. \n\nAfter reading the sample explanation in the problem: \n  The first test case: w=3, l=5. \n  The three tilings are represented in the following pictures. \n\nSince we cannot see the pictures, we rely on the common solution for this problem.\n\nCommon solution for this problem (from known problemset) is to consider the divisors of the following numbers:\n  g1 = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n  g2 = gcd(w-2, l)\n  g3 = gcd(w, l-2)\n  g4 = gcd(w-2, l-2)\n  g5 = gcd(w-1, l)\n  g6 = gcd(w, l-1)\n\nBut wait, there are multiple ways to assign the boundary segments? \n\nThe boundary has four segments. The corners are shared. We can assign the corner to one side or the other? \n\nActually, the problem might be that the boundary is divided into four segments, but the corner tile might be shared between two adjacent sides? \n\nBut the tile must be placed in a straight line. \n\nAlternatively, we can consider the entire boundary as a cycle and then the condition is that the total length is divisible by a, and also the tile must be able to be placed without covering a corner in the middle? \n\nBut if we place a tile that covers a corner, then it would have to be bent? \n\nAnother idea: the tile can be placed on the boundary in a straight line that might start on one side and go to the next side? only if the corner is not a problem? \n\nBut the corner is a single tile. \n\nKnown similar problem: Codeforces Round #783 (Div. 2) - Problem D: https://codeforces.com/contest/1668/problem/D\n\nBut the known solution for \"which values of a\" is to consider the divisors of the following expressions:\n\n  The boundary is 2*(w+l-2). We require a divides 2*(w+l-2).\n\n  Additionally, the tile placement must be such that the corners are not an issue. This can be ensured if a is at most the length of the two adjacent sides? \n\nBut the sample: (3,5): boundary=12, divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12. But only 1,2,3 are valid.\n\nWhy 4 is not valid? \n  Because the tile of size 4 would require covering 4 consecutive boundary tiles. But the longest straight segment is 5 (on the top or bottom). So we can place a tile of size 4 on the top? But then the next tile on the top would be of size 1? which is not divisible by 4? \n\nBut wait, we can break the boundary arbitrarily? Then we could start the tile at the last two tiles of the top and then the first two tiles of the right? But then the tile would have to cover a corner? and would not be straight. \n\nTherefore, the tile must be placed entirely within one straight segment. \n\nThen the condition: \n  a must be <= the length of the segment it is placed on.\n\n  and also, the entire boundary must be partitioned into tiles of size a, and each tile must be within one segment.\n\nBut then the segments are independent. \n\nSo we have four segments: \n  segment1: top -> length = l\n  segment2: right -> length = w-2\n  segment3: bottom -> length = l\n  segment4: left -> length = w-2\n\nThen the condition: \n  a must divide the length of the segment it is placed on, and also the same a must be used for all segments? \n\nBut the problem says: \" for some positive integer a\", meaning the same a for the entire boundary.\n\nTherefore, a must divide the length of every segment? \n\nBut then a must divide l and w-2. \n\nFor (3,5): \n  l=5, w-2=1.\n  a must divide gcd(5,1)=1. So only a=1.\n\nBut the problem says a=1,2,3 are valid. \n\nThis is not matching. \n\nAlternatively, we might use different placements of the tiles on the boundary. For example, the tile might be placed such that it covers parts of two adjacent segments if we start at a corner? \n\nBut the tile is straight, so it cannot cover two segments that are perpendicular. \n\nUnless the tile is placed in the corner and then goes along one side? \n\nBut then the corner is covered by one tile? \n\nActually, the corner is a single tile. So one tile can cover the corner and then extend along one side? \n\nFor example, a tile of size a=3: \n  It might cover the top-right corner and then extend along the top for 2 tiles and along the right for 1 tile? -> total 3 tiles? \n\nBut then the tile is not straight: it is L-shaped? \n\n The problem does not allow L-shaped tiles. \n\nGiven the confusion, I recall that there is a known problem: \n  Codeforces Round  :  (example: https://codeforces.com/contest/gym/102942/problem/A)\n\nAnd the solution is to consider the divisors of the following numbers:\n\n  g0 = 2*(w+l-2)   # the total boundary tiles, but then we also need to consider the structure.\n\nActually, the known solution in the provided code snippet is:\n\n  half_perimeter = w + l - 2   # note: this is not the total boundary tiles? total boundary tiles = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * (w+l-2) -> but the variable name is half_perimeter? \n\n  Then they iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and consider divisors.\n\n  Then for each divisor a in {i, half_perimeter//i} (if the division is exact), they check:\n\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # then they do something? \n\n  and also they include 1 and 2 initially.\n\n So the provided code snippet is:\n\n    solutions = {1, 2}\n    for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n        if mod_i != 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n What is the TODO? \n\n They are probably checking if a is valid. \n\n The condition: w % a <= 2.\n\n Why? \n\n Let me try with (3,5): \n   half_perimeter = 3+5-2 = 6.\n   divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n\n   a=1: already in solutions.\n   a=2: already in solutions.\n   a=3: \n        w=3, 3 % 3 = 0 <=2 -> valid.\n   a=6: \n        w=3, 3 % 6 = 3 -> not <=2 -> invalid.\n\n   So solutions = {1,2,3} -> matches.\n\n   Then for (3,5) we output 1,2,3.\n\n   What about (4,4)? \n        half_perimeter = 4+4-2 = 6.\n        divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n        a=1: valid (w=4 -> 4%1=0<=2)\n        a=2: 4%2=0<=2 -> valid.\n        a=3: 4%3=1<=2 -> valid.\n        a=6: 4%6=4>2 -> invalid.\n\n        So solutions = {1,2,3} -> sorted: 1,2,3.\n\n   But what is the boundary of (4,4)? \n        boundary = 2*(4+4-2)=12.\n        segments: \n          top: 4, bottom: 4, left: 4-2=2, right: 2.\n        Can we use a=3? \n          top: 4 % 3 !=0 -> fail.\n          bottom: same.\n          left: 2 % 3 !=0 -> fail.\n          right: same.\n        -> should be invalid.\n\n   But the condition w % a <=2 for a=3: 4%3=1<=2 -> valid.\n\n   So what is the catch? \n\n   The condition might be more than that. \n\n   The TODO might be to check also with l? \n\n   Let me read a known solution for this problem: \n\n   We are to find the number of a such that one of the following holds:\n\n   (1) a | (w-2) and a | l, and also the remaining part of the top and bottom can be tiled? \n   (2) a | (w) and a | (l-2)\n   (3) a | (w-1) and a | (l-1)\n   (4) a | (w-1) and a | (l) and the remaining on the left and right can be tiled? \n   (5) a | (w) and a | (l-1) \n   (6) a | (w-1) and a | (l-1) [already in (3)]\n\n   Actually, there are several cases. \n\n   The known approach is to consider the following cases for the corners:\n\n   Case 1: the four corners are not covered by any tile that wraps? then the boundary is four independent segments: \n        top: l, bottom: l, left: w-2, right: w-2.\n        then a must divide l and w-2.\n\n   Case 2: the top-left corner is covered by a tile that is on the top and then wraps to the left? \n        then the top segment becomes l-1, the left segment becomes w-1-? \n\n   Actually, it is complex. \n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the following four cases for the corners:\n\n   Case 1: no corner is shared by two tiles: then we have four segments: \n        top: l, bottom: l, left: w-2, right: w-2.\n        -> then a must divide gcd(l, w-2)\n\n   Case 2: only one corner is shared (say top-left) by a tile that covers part of the top and part of the left? \n        then the top segment: l - x, the left segment: w-2 - y, and the shared part: x+y = a? \n        but then the condition is complex.\n\n   Given the provided code snippet, it is likely that the solution is to consider the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then check if a is valid by:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w % a == 0) or (w % a == a-1) or ... )? \n\n   But the TODO in the code is only one condition on w % a.\n\n   Let me try to complete the code as per the sample (3,5) and (4,4) and see.\n\n   In the code, after checking w % a <= 2, they might be checking l % a as well? \n\n   For (4,4) and a=3:\n        w % a = 4 % 3 = 1 <=2 -> passes the first condition.\n        then they might check l % a = 4 % 3 = 1 <=2 -> passes.\n        then they add a=3.\n\n   But we know a=3 is not valid for (4,4) because the segments are not divisible by 3.\n\n   So what is the solution for (4,4)? \n\n   Let me try to tile (4,4) with a=3:\n        boundary = 12, so we need 4 tiles of 1x3.\n        How to place? \n          We can try to place one tile on the top: covering 3 tiles of the top? then the top has 1 left.\n          Then the right: covering 3 tiles? but the right has only 2 tiles (w-2=2) -> not enough.\n          Alternatively, wrap the top and right: \n             top: from (0,0) to (0,2) -> 3 tiles? \n             then the right: from (0,3) to (2,3) -> 3 tiles? but wait, (0,3) is the top-right corner, and we already used (0,0) to (0,2) -> (0,3) is available? \n             then the bottom: from (3,3) to (3,1) -> 3 tiles? \n             then the left: from (3,0) to (1,0) -> 3 tiles? \n          But wait, the left segment has only 2 tiles (from (1,0) to (2,0))? \n          The boundary for a 4x4:\n             top: (0,0) to (0,3) -> 4\n             right: (1,3) to (3,3) -> 3 (because (0,3) is corner and (4,3) doesn't exist) -> wait, the matrix is 4x4: indices 0..3 for both.\n             bottom: (3,2) to (3,0) -> 3 (because (3,3) is corner) -> wait, bottom should be (3,0) to (3,3) -> 4, but we already counted (3,3) in the right? \n          This is messy.\n\n   Given the complexity, and the provided code structure, I will assume that the intended solution is to collect the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then for each divisor a, check the following conditions:\n\n        condition1 = (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2)\n        condition2 = ( (w-1) % a <= 1) and ( (l-1) % a <= 1)   # but not in the code.\n\n   But the code only has one condition: w % a <= 2.\n\n   And then they add a to solutions.\n\n   But for (4,4) and a=3: \n        w % a = 4 % 3 = 1 <=2 -> condition1 is true.\n        then they add a=3.\n\n   But the known valid a for (4,4) are only 1,2? \n\n   So the condition might be more. \n\n   Looking at the sample (3,5) and (4,4) and the condition in the code, I see that the TODO might be to check the other dimension as well? \n\n   The TODO might be:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if (l % a) <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   For (4,4) and a=3: \n        w % a = 1 <=2 -> true.\n        l % a = 4 % 3 = 1 <=2 -> true, so add a=3.\n\n   But then we also have a=6: \n        w % 6 = 4 % 6 = 4 >2 -> skip.\n\n   So solutions = {1,2,3} for (4,4) -> but is 3 valid? \n\n   The problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers, and the values are sorted.\n\n   But the known solution for this problem in Codeforces (if it's the same problem) is to consider the divisors of the following expressions:\n\n        factors = set()\n        factors.add(1)\n        factors.add(2)\n        for x in [w-2, w-1, w], [l-2, l-1, l]:\n            for i in range(0,3):\n                for j in range(0,3):\n                    g = gcd(x[i], y[j])\n                    for d in get_divisors(g):\n                        factors.add(d)\n\n        then also consider the total boundary = 2*(w+l-2) and take divisors that also are factors of this? \n\n   Given the time, and the provided code structure, I will complete the TODO as follows:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if (l % a) <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But then for (3,5) and a=3: \n        w=3: 3%3=0<=2 -> true.\n        l=5: 5%3=2<=2 -> true -> add.\n\n   for a=6: \n        w=3: 3%6=3>2 -> skip.\n\n   for a=1,2: already in.\n\n   So solutions = {1,2,3} -> matches.\n\n   For (4,4) and a=3: \n        w=4: 4%3=1<=2 -> true.\n        l=4: 4%3=1<=2 -> true -> add.\n\n   But is a=3 valid for (4,4)? \n\n   Let me try to tile (4,4) with a=3:\n\n        total boundary = 2*(4+4-2)=12, so 12/3=4 tiles.\n\n        We can do:\n          top: from (0,0) to (0,2) -> 3 tiles.\n          Then we have (0,3) left on the top. We can combine it with the right: \n             right: from (0,3) to (2,3) -> 3 tiles? (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) -> but then we have (3,3) on the bottom and (3,0) on the left not yet.\n\n          bottom: from (3,3) to (3,1) -> 3 tiles: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) -> then (3,0) is left.\n          left: from (3,0) to (1,0) -> 3 tiles: (3,0), (2,0), (1,0) -> but then (0,0) is already used.\n\n        This is not working because (0,0) is used in the top, and (1,0) and (2,0) are used in the left, and (0,3) in the right, and (3,3) in the bottom.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Tile1: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) -> top.\n          Tile2: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) -> right.\n          Tile3: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) -> bottom.\n          Tile4: (3,0), (2,0), (1,0) -> left.\n\n        But then the corners: (0,0), (0,3), (3,3), (3,0) are covered. \n        However, the boundary also includes (0,0) to (0,3) for the top, and (0,3) to (3,3) for the right, and (3,3) to (3,0) for the bottom, and (3,0) to (0,0) for the left.\n\n        This covers the entire boundary? \n          top: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) -> but (0,3) is in tile2? and (0,0) in tile1, (0,1) in tile1, (0,2) in tile1, (0,3) in tile2 -> covered.\n          right: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) -> (0,3) in tile2, (1,3) in tile2, (2,3) in tile2, (3,3) in tile3 -> covered.\n          bottom: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0) -> (3,3) in tile3, (3,2) in tile3, (3,1) in tile3, (3,0) in tile4 -> covered.\n          left: (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0) -> (3,0) in tile4, (2,0) in tile4, (1,0) in tile4, (0,0) in tile1 -> covered.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, a=3 is valid for (4,4).\n\n   So the condition is: \n        a must be a divisor of the total boundary = 2*(w+l-2) [which is what half_perimeter? note: half_perimeter = w+l-2, and the total boundary is 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. But the divisors of half_perimeter are also divisors of the total boundary? \n\n        But the code uses half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n        And then for a divisor a of half_perimeter, we have that the total boundary is 2 * half_perimeter, which is divisible by a only if a is a divisor of 2 * half_perimeter. But if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then it is a divisor of 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n        So the condition is that a is a divisor of half_perimeter.\n\n        Additionally, we require that the placement is possible, which is ensured by: \n             w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2.\n\n   Therefore, the TODO is to add a to the set solutions if l % a is also <=2.\n\n   But note: the code already has:\n\n        solutions = {1,2}\n\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                    if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                        solutions.add(a)\n\n   But what about the divisor 1 and 2? They are already in the set.\n\n   Also, note that half_perimeter might be 0? but w,l>=3, so half_perimeter>=4.\n\n   But what about the divisor a = half_perimeter itself? \n\n   We are iterating i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and for each divisor i, we consider a = i and a = half_perimeter // i.\n\n   This will include all divisors? \n\n   However, we might miss a=1 and a=2, but they are already in the set.\n\n   But also, we might miss a=half_perimeter? \n\n   For example, if half_perimeter=6, then i=2: 6%2==0, then a=2 and a=3 (6//2=3). Then i=3: floor(sqrt(6)) is floor(2.4)=2, so we stop at 2. Then a=6 is not considered.\n\n   But a=6: we would get it when i=3? but i goes up to floor(sqrt(6))=2.\n\n   So we need to iterate i from 1 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))? \n\n   But the code starts at 2 and then we have solutions = {1,2} initially.\n\n   So to get a=6 for half_perimeter=6, we would need to consider i=3? but 3>floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2.\n\n   Therefore, we should iterate i from 1 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and then remove the condition for 1 and 2? \n\n   But the code already has 1 and 2 in the set.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate i from 1 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and then for each divisor i, we add a = i and a = half_perimeter//i if they are divisors, and then do the condition.\n\n   But the code currently starts at 2 and has an initial set {1,2}. \n\n   Why 2 is included initially? \n\n   For (3,5): half_perimeter=6, and a=2 is a divisor? and we have it in the set.\n\n   But if we iterate i from 1, then we would get a=1 and a=6 at i=1, and a=2 and a=3 at i=2.\n\n   So we can change the loop to start from 1 and then remove the initial set? \n\n   But the problem says the output for (3,5) is 1,2,3.\n\n   Alternatively, we can keep the initial set and then iterate from 2, and then also consider a = half_perimeter itself? \n\n   But the condition for a=half_perimeter: \n        w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2.\n\n   For (3,5): a=6: \n        w=3: 3%6=3>2 -> fail.\n        so not added.\n\n   For (4,4): half_perimeter=6, a=6: \n        w=4: 4%6=4>2 -> fail.\n\n   So we don't need a=half_perimeter.\n\n   But what if half_perimeter=4: \n        divisors: 1,2,4.\n        a=4: \n            for (3,3): half_perimeter=3+3-2=4.\n            w=3: 3%4=3>2 -> fail.\n        for (4,2) is not valid because w>=3.\n\n   Therefore, the only issue is that we might miss some divisors that are greater than sqrt(half_perimeter) and not the co-divisor of a divisor in [2, sqrt(half_perimeter)]? \n\n   But the loop: \n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1):\n            if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                    ...\n\n   This will get all divisors in pairs (i, half_perimeter//i) for i in [2, sqrt(half_perimeter)].\n\n   But we might miss the divisor 1 and half_perimeter? \n\n   But we have an initial set {1,2}. And we are not including half_perimeter because it is not generated by any i in [2, sqrt(half_perimeter)]? \n\n   However, if half_perimeter is a perfect square, then i = sqrt(half_perimeter) will be included, and a = i and a = half_perimeter//i = i, so we add one value.\n\n   But we are not including half_perimeter itself? \n\n   We are including a = i and a = half_perimeter//i. If i is a divisor, then half_perimeter//i is also a divisor. And if i is in [2, sqrt(half_perimeter)], then half_perimeter//i is in [sqrt(half_perimeter), half_perimeter//2] or even up to half_perimeter//2.\n\n   But we are not including a = half_perimeter? \n\n   For example, half_perimeter=6: \n        i=2: then a in [2, 6//2=3] -> we add 2 and 3.\n        i=3: not in the range because floor(sqrt(6))=2.\n\n   So we miss a=6? \n\n   But a=6: we don't want it because it fails the condition.\n\n   But what if we have a valid a=half_perimeter? \n\n   Example: w=3, l=3 -> half_perimeter=4.\n        divisors: 1,2,4.\n        a=4: \n            w=3: 3%4=3>2 -> invalid.\n\n   Example: w=4, l=4 -> half_perimeter=6, a=6: invalid.\n\n   Example: w=5, l=5 -> half_perimeter=8.\n        a=8: \n            w=5: 5%8=5>2 -> invalid.\n\n   So it seems that a=half_perimeter is always invalid.\n\n   Therefore, the code is safe.\n\n   But what about a=1 and a=2? \n        They are in the initial set.\n\n   However, we should also check the condition for a=1 and a=2? \n        For a=1: \n            w % 1 = 0 <=2 -> valid.\n            l % 1 = 0 <=2 -> valid.\n        For a=2: \n            w % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> valid.\n            l % 2: either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> valid.\n\n   So they are always valid.\n\n   Therefore, the TODO in program2.py is to add the condition for l % a and then add a to solutions.\n\n   Specifically, replace the TODO with:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the variable `a` might be very large? but the condition is mathematical.\n\n   Also, we might add duplicates? but set takes care of that.\n\n   So the completed code for the for-loop:\n\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            if half_perimeter % i != 0:\n                continue\n            for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the initial set already has 1 and 2.\n\n   However, what if a=1 or a=2 appears as a divisor in the loop? then we add them again? but set will remove duplicates.\n\n   So it's fine.\n\n   But what if half_perimeter=1? then the loop does not run? but w,l>=3, so half_perimeter>=4.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But wait, the code currently has:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:   # mod_a = w % a\n            # then we do the above for l?\n\n   So we can replace the TODO with:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: we might also want to check if a is at least 1? and we are only adding if both conditions hold.\n\n   Actually, the condition for a to be valid is that both w % a <=2 and l % a <=2.\n\n   So we should change the code to:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But the TODO is inside the if mod_a<=2, so we can do:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But then if w % a<=2 is true and l % a<=2 is true, we add.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But the TODO is only one line. \n\n   Given the structure, I think the intended completion is to add a to solutions if also l % a <=2.\n\n   So I'll write:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition on w % a is already checked in the outer if.\n\n   So it is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:   # which is w % a <= 2\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But we can also do:\n\n        solutions.add(a)   # only if both conditions hold, but the TODO is inside the if.\n\n   However, the condition on l is not checked yet.\n\n   Therefore, the completion is to check l % a and then add.\n\n   So the code becomes:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                if l % a <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition for a=1 and a=2 are already in the set initially, and they will be added again? but set will handle duplicates.\n\n   So it's fine.\n\n   But what if a is very large? for example, a = half_perimeter//i might be large, but the modulus operations are cheap for integers up to 10^9.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the variable `a` might be the same as one already in the set? then it is a no-op.\n\n   So we output: \"            if l % a <= 2:\\n                solutions.add(a)\"\n\n   However, the TODO is only one line? but the provided TODO is in a comment and then a blank. We are to fill in one or more lines? \n\n   The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\"\n\n   So we can output two lines.\n\nFor program3.py:\n\n   We are to compute the roundest new price of the good.\n\n   The roundest: the number with the maximum number of trailing zeros. If there are several, choose the maximal price.\n\n   If it is impossible to get a rounder price (than the current n*m? or than the current state?) -> output n*m.\n\n   The current price is n. We can multiply by k in [1, m] to get n*k.\n\n   We are to find k in [1, m] that maximizes the number of trailing zeros in n*k, and among those, the maximal n*k.\n\n   The approach in the code:\n\n        Factorize n: n = 2^a * 5^b * c, where c is not divisible by 2 or 5.\n\n        Then, we want to maximize the number of trailing zeros = min(exponent of 2, exponent of 5) in n*k.\n\n        We can multiply by t (which is initially 1) to balance the factors of 2 and 5.\n\n        If a > b: then we have more 2s, so we want to multiply by 5 as many times as possible (to get more 5s) until b becomes >=a? but note, we are limited by m.\n\n        Similarly, if b > a, we multiply by 2.\n\n        Then, after balancing, we have a and b as close as possible? then we can multiply by 10 as many times as possible (which is 10, 100, ...) to get more trailing zeros.\n\n        But note: multiplying by 10 is the same as multiplying by 2 and 5.\n\n        The code:\n\n            a = b = 0\n            c = n\n            while c % 2 == 0:\n                a += 1\n                c //= 2\n            while c % 5 == 0:\n                b += 1\n                c //= 5\n            t = 1\n            if a > b:\n                while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                    t *= 5\n                    b += 1\n            elif b > a:\n                while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            while 10 * t <= m:\n                t *= 10\n\n            output.append(n * (m - (m % t)))\n\n        The TODO: in the case b > a, we want to multiply by 2 as long as we can (to increase a) and within the limit of m.\n\n        So the TODO is:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n        But note: the condition is: while b > a and 2 * t <= m.\n\n        So we do:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n        Then, after that, we then multiply by 10 as long as we can.\n\n        Then, we let k = the largest multiple of t that is <= m? \n            k = m - (m % t)\n\n        Then the new price = n * k.\n\n        Why is that? \n\n        Example: n=6, m=11.\n            n=6 = 2^1 * 3, so a=1, b=0.\n            a>0, so we enter the first if: \n                while 1>0 and 5*t (t=1) <=11 -> true, so t=5, b becomes 1 (but wait, we didn't change b in the code? \n\n        Actually, in the code for a> b: \n            we do: t *= 5, and then b += 1? \n\n        But b is the exponent of 5 in the factorization of n, and we are multiplying by 5, so we are increasing the exponent of 5 by 1.\n\n        Similarly, for b>a: we multiply by 2 and increase a by 1.\n\n        For n=6: \n            after the first while: t=5, b becomes 1? \n            then we have a=1, b=1 -> balanced.\n            then we do: while 10*t=50<=11? false, so t remains 5.\n            then k = 11 - (11 % 5) = 11 - 1 = 10.\n            then new price = 6*10 = 60.\n\n        This matches the sample.\n\n        Example: n=5, m=43.\n            n=5: a=0, b=1.\n            then we enter the elif: b>a -> true.\n                while 1>0 and 2*t (t=1)<=43 -> true, so we do t=2, a=1.\n                then a=1, b=1 -> balanced.\n                then while 10*2=20<=43 -> true, so t=20.\n                then while 10*20=200>43 -> stop.\n                then k = 43 - (43 % 20) = 43 - 3 = 40.\n                new price = 5*40=200.\n\n        Example: n=13, m=5.\n            n=13: a=0, b=0.\n            skip both if and elif.\n            then while 10*1=10>5 -> skip.\n            then k = 5 - (5%1)=5-0=5.\n            new price = 13*5=65.\n\n        Example: the fourth test case: not provided.\n\n        Example: the fifth test case: n=1, m=12000? \n            n=1: a=0, b=0.\n            skip the if and elif.\n            then we multiply t by 10 as long as 10*t<=12000.\n                t=1 -> 10<=12000 -> t=10\n                then 100<=12000 -> t=100\n                then 1000<=12000 -> t=1000\n                then 10000<=12000 -> t=10000\n                then 100000>12000 -> stop.\n            then k = 12000 - (12000 % 10000) = 12000 - 2000 = 10000? \n            then new price = 1 * 10000 = 10000.\n\n        But the sample says \"increase the price 12000 times\", meaning k=12000? \n            then the new price = 1*12000 = 12000.\n\n        Which has 3 trailing zeros? \n            10000 has 4 trailing zeros, 12000 has 3.\n\n        So 10000 is rounder than 12000.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        So the TODO for program3.py is:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n        But note: the code in the TODO block is inside the while loop.\n\n        We must be careful: the while condition is: while b>a and 2*t<=m.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            t = t * 2\n            a = a + 1\n\n        This will increase a by one and multiply t by 2.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n   But note: the code is in the body of the while loop.\n\n   We output the two lines.\n\nSummary:\n\n  program1: \n      def solve():\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          c0 = a.count(0)\n          non_zeros = n - c0\n          if c0 > 0:\n              return non_zeros\n          else:\n              if len(set(a)) == n:\n                  return non_zeros + 1\n              else:\n                  return non_zeros\n\n  program2: \n      In the for-loop for a in [i, div]:\n          after the line \"if mod_a <= 2:\", we add:\n              if l % a <= 2:\n                  solutions.add(a)\n\n  program3: \n      In the elif block, inside the while loop:\n          we add:\n              t *= 2\n              a += 1\n\nBut note: the output format is a JSON with the keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\", and the value is the string of the missing code.\n\nWe must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1, the missing code is the entire body of solve().\n\nFor program2, the missing code is two lines: \"            if l % a <= 2:\\n                solutions.add(a)\"\n\nFor program3, the missing code is two lines: \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code.\n\nIn program2, the TODO is at an indentation level of 8 (inside the for-loop, inside the if, inside the for-loop for test cases).

So we need to represent the string with newlines as \\n and quotes escaped.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a triple-quoted string in JSON? But the specification says to return a JSON object.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    n = int(input().strip())\\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    c0 = a.count(0)\\n    non_zeros = n - c0\\n    if c0 > 0:\\n        return non_zeros\\n    else:\\n        if len(set(a)) == n:\\n            return non_zeros + 1\\n        else:\\n            return non_zeros\",\n  \"program2\": \"            if l % a <= 2:\\n                solutions.add(a)\",\n  \"program3\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has 4 spaces for indentation, and the program2 and program3 have the exact indentation as in the TODO.\n\nHowever, the provided program1 has:\n\ndef solve():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the body of solve should be indented by 4 spaces. The code we provided for program1 is:\n\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    c0 = a.count(0)\n    non_zeros = n - c0\n    if c0 > 0:\n        return non_zeros\n    else:\n        if len(set(a)) == n:\n            return non_zeros + 1\n        else:\n            return non_zeros\n\nBut the first line is indented by 4 spaces, and the rest similarly.\n\nIn the JSON, we represent newline as \\n.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the two lines are:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nWe must preserve the indentation.\n\nFor program3, the two lines:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\nWe write the JSON.\n\nBut note: the entire program1 code in the provided file is:\n\ndef solve():\r\n    # TODO: Your code here\r\nT=int(input())\r\nfor i in range(T):\r\n    print(solve())\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the body. So the missing code is the body without the function definition.\n\nSimilarly, for program2 and program3, we only output the lines that are missing.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
