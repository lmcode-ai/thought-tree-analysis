  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an array `a` of length `n` and we start with `b` as zeros. We can add or subtract `a_i` to `b_i` in one move. We want the minimum number of moves to make `b` strictly increasing.\n\nThe provided code has two loops: one going backwards from `i-1` down to 0 and one going forward from `i+1` to `n-1`. The idea is to fix a position `i` and then:\n  - For the left part (indices < i): we want to make sure that `b_j < b_i` for every j < i, and we are allowed to subtract or add multiples of `a_j`. However, note that we are building a solution that minimizes the total moves.\n\nBut note: the example subtracts `a_1` to get `b_1 = -1` and then adds `a_3`, `a_4`, `a_5` to get `b_3=3`, `b_4=4`, `b_5=5`. The array becomes [-1,0,3,4,5]. The moves are 4.\n\nThe provided code for the forward part (j from i+1 to n-1) does:\n   x = (p + a[j]) // a[j]   # This computes the smallest integer x such that x * a[j] >= p+1? \n   Then it adds x to the accumulator (acc) and sets p = x * a[j].\n\nThis forward part is ensuring that for each j from i+1 to n-1, we set `b_j` to be at least `p+1` (so that it is greater than the previous value) and then we use the minimal number of moves (which is x) to achieve that. The moves for a[j] are multiples: we can add a[j] x times to get x * a[j] (which is the minimal value that is at least p+1 and is a multiple of a[j]? Actually, note: we can also subtract, but the problem is that we want to minimize the moves. However, the problem does not require non-negativity. But note: we are starting at 0 and we can do any number of moves (positive or negative). However, the minimal moves to achieve a value that is at least p+1? Actually, we can also set negative values? But the condition is only that the sequence is increasing.\n\nBut note: the example subtracts a[0] to get -1. So we can subtract arbitrarily.\n\nHowever, the forward part is building the right side of the array starting from the fixed `i` (which we are going to set to 0? Actually, the fixed `i` is the one we are considering as the \"pivot\"?). The code does:\n\n   p = 0   (for the forward part starting at i+1)\n   for j from i+1 to n-1:\n        x = (p + a[j]) // a[j]   # This is equivalent to: ceil((p+1)/a[j])? But note: we need b_j to be at least p+1? Actually, we need b_j to be greater than the previous element (which we are building as p). So we need b_j >= p+1. The minimal number of moves for element j is the minimal nonnegative integer k such that |k * a[j]| >= p+1? But note: we can also subtract. However, we want to minimize the moves. We can choose either positive or negative. The minimal k such that k * a[j] >= p+1 OR -k * a[j] <= ...? Actually, we can also set negative values? But the condition is that the entire sequence must be increasing. However, the fixed `i` is set to 0? Actually, the code does not set the value at `i` to anything. \n\nWait, the code does not have any moves for the fixed `i`? Then how is the value at `i` set? The problem says we can choose an integer i and then add or subtract a_i. The fixed `i` in the outer loop is the one that we are not moving? Actually, the problem does not require that we set the value at `i` to zero. We are free to set any multiple.\n\nBut note: the example: \n   n=5, a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n   They subtract a1: so b1 becomes -1 (which is one move: subtract once). Then they add a3, a4, a5: so 3 moves. Total 4.\n\nIn the code, the outer loop is for i from 0 to n-1. For each i, we are going to assume that we set b_i to 0? Actually, the code does not explicitly set b_i to 0. But note: the initial b_i is 0. We are allowed to do moves arbitrarily. However, the problem does not require that we use the initial 0. We can change it arbitrarily.\n\nBut the provided code for the left part is missing. We have:\n\n   for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nAnd then we reset p to 0 and do the forward part.\n\nThe idea: we are going to fix that at the end, the value at index i is 0? Then we build the left part (from i-1 down to 0) and the right part (from i+1 to n-1) independently? \n\nFor the left part: we want b_{j} < b_{j+1} for every j. Since we are going backwards from i-1 down to 0, we want to set b_j such that b_j < b_{j+1}. We start at j = i-1: we want b_{i-1} < b_i = 0. Then we move to j = i-2: we want b_{i-2} < b_{i-1}, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, for the right part: we start at j = i+1: we want b_{i+1} > b_i = 0. Then j = i+2: b_{i+2} > b_{i+1}, etc.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that we set b_i to 0. However, the minimal moves might be achieved by setting b_i to 0? Actually, we can set b_i to any multiple of a_i. The minimal moves for a_i would be 0 if we leave it at 0? But we are allowed to change it. However, if we set b_i to 0, then we use 0 moves for the center. Then the total moves for the entire array is the moves for the left and the moves for the right.\n\nBut why is the center fixed at 0? Because we are starting at 0 and we haven't moved it? Actually, the problem says we start with b_i=0. We are allowed to change it. However, we might not need to change it? But the example: we did change b1 (which was initially 0) to -1. So we did one move for the center? Actually, in the example, the center is not fixed at 0? The example did change the first element.\n\nBut note: the outer loop is over every index i. We are trying every index as the \"center\" that we set to 0? Actually, the problem does not require that the center is 0. We are free to set any value. However, the minimal moves might be achieved by leaving one element at 0? But that might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is solved by dynamic programming. However, the provided code structure is:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        acc, p = 0, 0\n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        p = 0\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            x = (p + a[j]) // a[j]\n            acc += x\n            p = x * a[j]\n        ans = min(ans, acc) if ans is not None else acc\n\nSo the total moves for the current center i is the moves for the left part (from i-1 down to 0) plus the moves for the right part (from i+1 to n-1). And we are not counting any move for the center? That means we are leaving the center at 0? Then the center uses 0 moves.\n\nBut the example: the center is the first element? Then we subtract a1 (so one move) and then we do the right part: which is from index 2 to 4 (since i=0: then the left part is none, and the right part is indices 1,2,3,4? But wait, the example subtracts a1 and then adds a3, a4, a5. So the center is index0? Then the right part: we start at index1? But the example does not mention index1? Actually, the example says: subtract a1 from b1, and then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5. So the center is not fixed? Actually, the center is not being set to 0? The center is being set to -1 (for index0) and then we leave index1 at 0? Then we have b0=-1, b1=0, b2=0, b3=3, b4=4, b5=5? But that is not increasing: because b1=0 and b2=0 -> not strictly increasing.\n\nWait, the example says: the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. So the array has 5 elements: indices0 to 4. They did:\n   index0: subtract a0 -> becomes -1\n   index1: not moved? -> remains 0\n   index2: add a2 -> becomes 1? but they say 3? \n\nActually, the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\". So they are adding a3 to b3? Then b3 becomes 1? But they say 3? \n\nLet me re-read: the array a is [1,1,1,1,1]. Then:\n   subtract a1: so if a1 is the first element (a0 in 0-index) then b0 becomes -1.\n   Then they add a3: which is the fourth element? then b3 becomes 1? but they say the array is [-1,0,3,4,5]? \n\nThis does not match. \n\nAlternatively, the example might be: \n   a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n   They subtract a0: so b0 = -1 (1 move)\n   Then they add a2: so b2 = 1 (1 move) -> but then we have b0=-1, b1=0, b2=1 -> that is increasing? but they did 3 more moves? \n\nActually, the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5\" meaning three moves? and subtract a1: one move -> total 4. But then the array becomes [-1,0,3,4,5]. How? \n\nIf a3, a4, a5 are the last three elements (each 1), then adding each once gives:\n   b0 = -1, b1 = 0, b2 = 0, b3 = 1, b4 = 1 -> not 3,4,5.\n\nThey must be adding multiple times? \n\nBut note: the problem says: in one move you can choose an integer i and add a_i OR subtract a_i. So for the same index, you can do multiple moves? \n\nYes, the problem does not say you can only do one move per index. So for index3, we can add a3 three times to get 3? Then that would be 3 moves. Similarly, for index4: 4 moves? and index5: 5 moves? That would be 3+4+5=12 moves? which is too many.\n\nAlternatively, they did:\n   subtract a0: 1 move -> b0 = -1\n   then for index2: they add a2 three times? -> 3 moves -> b2=3\n   then for index3: they add a3 once? -> 1 move -> b3=1? but that is not 4.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nBut note: the example output is [-1,0,3,4,5]. How can we get that?\n   b0 = -1: that's one move (subtract a0 once)\n   b1 = 0: that's 0 moves (leave it)\n   b2 = 3: that's 3 moves (add a2 three times)\n   b3 = 4: that's 4 moves? but then we are doing 4 moves for b3? but that would be 1+0+3+4 = 8 moves? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n   b0: subtract a0 -> -1 (1 move)\n   b1: leave at 0 -> 0 moves\n   b2: we need to be greater than 0 -> we can add a2 once -> 1 -> but then we have 1, but we need 3? so we add three times -> 3 moves -> total 4 moves so far? \n   then b3: we need to be greater than 3 -> we can add a3 once -> 1 -> but that is 1 which is less than 3? so we need to add 4 times? -> 4 moves -> total 8 moves? \n   then b4: 5 moves? -> total 13 moves.\n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, we can set b2 to 3 by doing: 3 = 3 * a2 -> 3 moves? and then b3: we set to 4 by 4 moves? and b4: 5 moves? total 1+3+4+5 = 13.\n\nBut the example says 4 moves. \n\nThe example says: \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\" \n\nHow? They did one move for the first element (subtract) and then three moves for the last three elements? but that would be 1+3=4? and then how do they get 3,4,5? \n\nThey must have done:\n   subtract a0: 1 move -> b0=-1\n   then they did one move for a2: add -> b2=1? but that is not 3.\n\nWait, note: the problem says: \"add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\". So for the same index, we can do multiple moves? But the problem does not specify that we can do multiple moves on the same index in one operation? Actually, each move is one operation: we choose an index and then we do one operation (add or subtract). So to get 3 at index2, we need to add a2 three times: that's three moves.\n\nBut then the total moves would be 1 (for index0) + 3 (for index2) + 4 (for index3) + 5 (for index4) = 13? \n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the example might be using different indices? They say: \"add a3, a4, and a5\" meaning one move for each? Then that would be three moves. And subtract a1: one move -> total 4. Then the array becomes:\n   b0: we didn't touch? but we subtracted a1? which is the first element? so b0 becomes -1? \n   b1: not touched? remains 0.\n   b2: not touched? remains 0.\n   b3: becomes 1 (by adding a3 once)\n   b4: becomes 1 (by adding a4 once)\n   b5: becomes 1 (by adding a5 once)\n\nBut that is [-1,0,0,1,1,1]? which is not strictly increasing: because 0 is not greater than 0, and 1 is not greater than 1.\n\nSo what is the example? \n\nLooking at the note: Example1: \n   Input: n=5, a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n   Output: 4\n\nAnd the example says: the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nHow can we get that with 4 moves?\n   Move1: subtract a0 -> b0 = -1\n   Move2: add a2 -> b2 = 1 -> but then we have [-1,0,1,0,0] -> not increasing at index2 and index3? \n   Then we need to fix the rest.\n\nAlternatively, they did:\n   Move1: subtract a0 -> b0 = -1\n   Then they did one move: add a2 three times? but that would be three moves? total 4 moves? and then set b2=3? \n   Then what about b3 and b4? They are still 0? \n\nBut then the array is [-1,0,3,0,0] -> not increasing.\n\nUnless they did multiple moves on multiple indices? \n\nBut the problem says: in one move, you choose one index and do one operation (add or subtract). \n\nThe only way to get 3 at index2 is to do three moves on index2. Similarly, 4 at index3: four moves? and 5 at index4: five moves? total 1+3+4+5=13.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAfter re-thinking: the example says: \"subtract a1\" (which is the first element, so index0) and then \"add a3, a4, and a5\" (which are the last three elements). So that is 1 + 3 = 4 moves. Then the array becomes:\n   b0 = -1 (because we subtracted a0 once: a0=1 -> 0-1 = -1)\n   b1 = 0 (untouched)\n   b2 = 0 (untouched)\n   b3 = 1 (because we added a3 once: 0+1=1)\n   b4 = 1 (because we added a4 once: 0+1=1)\n   b5 = 1 (because we added a5 once: 0+1=1)\n\nBut then the array is [-1,0,0,1,1,1] -> not strictly increasing.\n\nUnless the array a has 5 elements: a0, a1, a2, a3, a4. Then:\n   subtract a0: b0 = -1\n   add a2: b2 = 1 -> but then we have [-1,0,1,0,0] -> not increasing at index3 and index4.\n   then add a3: b3=1 -> [-1,0,1,1,0] -> still not increasing at index4.\n   then add a4: b4=1 -> [-1,0,1,1,1] -> still not strictly increasing.\n\nSo how do they get [-1,0,3,4,5]? \n\nThey must have done:\n   b0: subtract a0 -> -1 (1 move)\n   b2: add a2 three times -> 3 (3 moves) -> total 4 moves\n   b3: add a3 four times -> 4 (4 moves) -> total 8 moves\n   b4: add a4 five times -> 5 (5 moves) -> total 13 moves.\n\nBut the example says 4 moves.\n\nI see the example in the note: \"NoteExample 1: ... after 4 moves\". So it must be 4 moves.\n\nAfter reading the problem again: \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\nSo one move: one operation on one index.\n\nThe example says: subtract a1 (one move), and then add a3, a4, and a5 (three moves) -> total 4 moves.\n\nBut then the array becomes:\n   b1 = -1 (if a1 is the first element, then b1 becomes -1)\n   b3 = 1, b4=1, b5=1.\n\nBut the array has 5 elements: indices 1 to 5? Then the array is:\n   index1: -1\n   index2: 0 (untouched)\n   index3: 1\n   index4: 1\n   index5: 1\n\nThis is not increasing: because index2 (0) is greater than index1 (-1) -> good, but index3 (1) is greater than index2 (0) -> good, but index4 (1) is not greater than index3 (1).\n\nSo it fails at index4.\n\nUnless the example has a different indexing? The problem says: \"the final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5]\". This array has 5 elements. So if we label the array as b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, then:\n   b0 = -1, b1=0, b2=3, b3=4, b4=5.\n\nHow to achieve that with 4 moves?\n   Move1: subtract a0 -> b0 = -1\n   Move2: add a2 -> b2 = 1 -> not 3\n   Move3: add a2 again -> b2=2\n   Move4: add a2 again -> b2=3\n\nThen we have b0=-1, b1=0, b2=3, b3=0, b4=0 -> then b3 and b4 are 0, which is less than b2=3? so we need to fix b3 and b4.\n\nBut we haven't moved b3 and b4, so they are 0. Then the array is [-1,0,3,0,0] -> not increasing.\n\nAlternatively, we do:\n   Move1: subtract a0 -> b0=-1\n   Move2: add a2 -> b2=1\n   Move3: add a3 -> b3=1 -> not 4\n   Move4: add a4 -> b4=1\n\nNot [ -1,0,1,1,1].\n\nAnother possibility: they did moves on the same index multiple times in one move? But the problem says one move per operation.\n\nAfter reading the sample explanation again: \"subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively\". This means:\n   b1 = b1 - a1 = 0 - 1 = -1\n   b3 = b3 + a3 = 0+1=1\n   b4 = b4 + a4 = 0+1=1\n   b5 = b5 + a5 = 0+1=1\n\nSo the array is:\n   b1 = -1\n   b2 = 0 (not changed)\n   b3 = 1\n   b4 = 1\n   b5 = 1\n\nBut the array is printed as [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5]? This does not match.\n\n unless the array a is not [1,1,1,1,1]? \n\nThe input is: first line 5, second line 1 1 1 1 1.\n\nSo a = [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nAnd the output is 4.\n\nAnd the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]? \n\nThis is a mystery.\n\nAfter checking online for the problem: it is a known problem: \n   https://codeforces.com/contest/1426/problem/C\n\nBut the problem there is different: it is about increasing array by doing moves: in one move you can increment one element. But here we can also decrement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be: we are allowed to do any number of moves on any index, and we want the minimum moves to make the array strictly increasing.\n\nKnown solution for \"Minimum moves to make the array increasing\" with the allowed move: add or subtract any number of times (each time one move) and the cost is the number of moves.\n\nBut the known solution for the problem of making the array increasing (not necessarily strictly) with moves being any real number of additions/subtractions per index is to use a greedy and set the array to the minimal possible value at each step. However, here the moves are constrained: we can only add or subtract multiples of a_i.\n\nActually, the known solution for this exact problem (from a contest) is:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   ans = 10**18\n   for i in range(n):\n        cur = 0\n        b = [0] * n\n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            # How many times we need to subtract so that b[j] < b[j+1]?\n            # We have b[j+1] is known. We want b[j] = k * a[j] (for some integer k) and b[j] < b[j+1].\n            # We want the smallest nonnegative integer moves? But we can also use negative multiples.\n            # Actually, we want the minimal number of moves (|k|) such that there exists an integer k with k * a[j] < b[j+1].\n            # But note: we can choose any integer k (positive or negative). The minimal |k| such that k * a[j] < b[j+1] is not necessarily the same as the minimal positive k.\n\n        Similarly for the right.\n\nBut the provided code structure for the right part is:\n\n   p = 0\n   for j in range(i+1, n):\n        x = (p + a[j]) // a[j]   # This is integer division. \n        acc += x\n        p = x * a[j]\n\nWhat is p? It seems p is the value we set for b_j? \n\nFor the right part, we start at j = i+1. We want b_{i+1} > b_i = 0. The minimal positive value we can set for b_{i+1} is a[j] (by adding once) or -a[j] (by subtracting once). But we want it to be greater than 0. The minimal positive value is a[j] (if we add once). So x=1. Then p = a[j]. Then for j+1: we want b_{j+1} > p. So we need to set b_{j+1} to at least p+1. How many moves for a[j+1]? We need the smallest integer k (in absolute value) such that k * a[j+1] >= p+1. But note: we can use positive k only because we want a positive value? Actually, we can also use negative values? But if we use negative, then we get a negative value which might be less than p? so we must use positive. So the minimal k is ceil((p+1)/a[j+1]). \n\nBut the code does: x = (p + a[j]) // a[j] \n   = (0 + a[j]) // a[j] = 1 for the first j.\n\nThen for the next j: \n   x = (p + a[j]) // a[j] = (a[j-1] + a[j]) // a[j]\n\nBut wait, p is the value set for the previous element. For example, if a[j-1]=1 and a[j]=2, then p=1, then x = (1+2)//2 = 3//2 = 1 (if integer division is floor) -> then p = 1*2 = 2. But we need at least 2? because we need >1. 2>1 -> good. And moves=1.\n\nBut if a[j-1]=2 and a[j]=1, then for the first element: x= (0+2)//2 = 1, p=2. Then for the next: x = (2+1)//1 = 3, p=3. Then moves=1+3=4.\n\nBut what if we set the second element to 3? then we need 3 moves (add three times) for the second element.\n\nSo the code for the right part is correct: it sets the value for the right part to the smallest multiple of a[j] that is greater than the previous value (p), and the number of moves is x = ceil((p+1)/a[j])? \n\nBut note: (p + a[j]) // a[j] is not ceil((p+1)/a[j]). For example, if p=1, a[j]=2: \n   ceil((1+1)/2)=ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> matches.\n   if p=2, a[j]=3: ceil((2+1)/3)=ceil(1)=1, but (2+3)//3 = 5//3 = 1 (if using integer floor division) -> matches.\n   if p=0, a[j]=1: ceil(1/1)=1, (0+1)//1=1.\n\nBut what if p=0, a[j]=2: ceil(1/2)=1, (0+2)//2=1.\n\nSo it works.\n\nHowever, for the left part: we are going backwards. We start at j = i-1 (the first element to the left of i). We want b_{i-1} < b_i = 0. How many moves? We can set b_{i-1} to any multiple of a[i-1]. We want the largest multiple that is less than 0? and then the number of moves is the absolute value of the multiplier? \n\nBut note: we can use negative multiples: \n   if we use a negative multiple: k (negative) then the value is k * a[i-1] (which is negative) and the number of moves is |k|.\n\nWe want the largest value that is less than 0? because then the next element to the left will have an easier time (it only needs to be less than that value). \n\nBut the known solution for the left part is similar to the right part but in reverse.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   p = 0   # for the element at i\n   for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n        # We want b_j < b_{j+1} = p (which is the value we set for the next element to the right, which is j+1)\n        # How many moves? we want the largest multiple of a[j] that is < p.\n        # But note: we can also use positive multiples? but positive multiples are >=0, which might be >=p? so we use negative multiples.\n        # The value we set: we want the smallest negative moves (in absolute value) that gives a value < p.\n        # Actually, we want the value to be as close to p as possible from below? to minimize the moves for the next left.\n\n        # The value will be: k * a[j] < p, and we want to minimize |k| (the number of moves) and also we want the value to be as high as possible (to make it easier for the next left).\n\n        # The largest value that is < p and is a multiple of a[j] is: \n        #   Let k = floor((p - 1) / a[j])   ??? \n        # But then the number of moves is |k|? but if k is negative, then we would use -k moves (because k is negative, so we subtract |k| times) and the value is k * a[j] = -|k| * a[j]? \n\n        # Alternatively, we can think: we want the value to be at most p-1. The minimal number of moves (which is nonnegative) is the smallest integer x such that we can achieve a value <= p-1. But we can achieve any integer value that is a multiple of a[j]? \n\n        # We can do:\n        #   If we use negative moves: we subtract x times, then the value is -x * a[j]. We want -x * a[j] <= p-1 -> x >= ceil( ( - (p-1) ) / a[j] )? \n        #   Or if we use positive moves, we might get positive values which might be >=p, so not allowed.\n\n        # But note: we can also use positive moves to get positive values, but then we might exceed p-1? so we must use negative moves.\n\n        # However, the minimal number of moves is the smallest x such that -x * a[j] <= p-1? \n        #   -> x >= ceil( (1-p) / a[j] )? \n\n        # But the known solution for the left part in some online submissions is:\n\n        #   x = (p + a[j] - 1) // a[j]   # but then they use this x to compute the value as -x * a[j]? and then set p = -x * a[j]? \n\n        # But wait, the right part uses: x = (p + a[j]) // a[j]   -> which is ceil((p)/a[j]) if we had floating point, but with integer division it is: \n        #   (p + a[j] - 1) // a[j] is floor((p+a[j]-1)/a[j]) which is ceil(p/a[j]) if p is positive.\n\n        # For the left part, we want the value to be < p. We can set it to: -floor(( -p ) / a[j]) * a[j]? \n\n        # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        #   x = ( -p + a[j] - 1) // a[j]   # then the value would be -x * a[j]? and then the number of moves is x.\n\n        # But then we set p = -x * a[j] for the next left.\n\n        # Example: p=0, a[j]=1: \n        #   x = (0 + 1 - 1) // 1 = 0//1 = 0 -> then value=0, but 0<0 is false. So we need at least one move: subtract once -> value=-1. \n        #   How to get that? we want x=1. \n        #   If we do: x = ( -p + a[j] - 1) // a[j] = (0+1-1)//1=0 -> not 1.\n\n        # Another try: \n        #   We want the smallest x (nonnegative) such that -x * a[j] < p.\n        #   Rearranged: x > ( -p - 1 ) / a[j]   -> so x = floor( (-p-1) / a[j] ) + 1? \n        #   Then the value is -x * a[j].\n\n        # Example: p=0, a[j]=1: then (-0-1)/1 = -1, floor(-1) = -1, then x = -1+1 =0 -> not enough.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use: \n        #   x = (p - 1) // a[j]   # but if p=0, then (0-1)//1 = -1//1 = -1 -> then we would use x = -1? but moves are absolute value? \n\n        # But the moves are always nonnegative.\n\n        # Known solution from a similar problem (C++ code for the same problem):\n\n        #   long long ans = 0;\n        #   long long last = 0;\n        #   for (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n        #       long long k = (last + a[j]) / a[j];   // for the right part they use (last + a[j]) / a[j] but for left?\n        #   }\n\n        # But in our problem, the left part is symmetric: we want the value to be just below the next value.\n\n        # In fact, we can do:\n\n        #   We want to set b_j to the largest multiple of a[j] that is < p.\n        #   That multiple is: floor((p-1)/a[j]) * a[j] \n        #   Then the number of moves is |floor((p-1)/a[j])|? \n\n        # But if p-1 is negative, then floor((p-1)/a[j]) is negative or zero.\n\n        # Example: p=0, a[j]=1: floor((0-1)/1) = floor(-1) = -1, then the value = -1 * 1 = -1, and the number of moves is | -1 | = 1.\n\n        # Example: p= -1, a[j]=2: then floor((-1-1)/2)=floor(-2/2)=floor(-1)=-1, then value = -1*2 = -2, moves=1.\n\n        # But then the next value to the left must be < -2.\n\n        # How to compute the number of moves? it is the absolute value of the multiplier k = floor((p-1)/a[j]). \n\n        # However, note: we might have to use negative multiples: so the multiplier k is negative. The number of moves is |k|.\n\n        # So we can do:\n        #   k = (p-1) // a[j]   # but if (p-1) is negative, then in Python, floor division for negative numbers rounds toward -infinity.\n        #   But we want the floor of a negative number: for example, (0-1)//1 = -1, which is correct.\n\n        # However, if p-1 is positive: \n        #   p=3, a[j]=2: then (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1, then value=1*2=2, which is <3 -> good, and moves=1.\n        #   But wait, we could also use negative moves? then we could set it to -2 (by subtracting once) and that is <3, and moves=1. But 2 is closer to 3 than -2, and it makes the next left easier. So we would choose the positive 2? \n\n        # However, the problem does not require that we minimize the absolute value of the array, only the number of moves. And both require 1 move. But if we set it to 2, then the next left element must be <2. If we set it to -2, then the next left must be < -2. Which one is better? \n        #   For the next left: if we set to 2, then we need the next left to be <2. We can set it to 0 (if a[j] is 1, then 0 requires 0 moves? but we can only set multiples: 0 is a multiple (0 times) -> 0 moves. \n        #   If we set to -2, then we need the next left to be < -2. We might need at least one move (to set it to -1? if a[j]=1) but -1 is greater than -2? so we need -3? which is one move (subtract once) -> 1 move.\n\n        # So total moves for the two left elements: \n        #   Option1: 1 (for the first) + 0 (for the next) = 1.\n        #   Option2: 1 (for the first) + 1 (for the next) = 2.\n\n        # So we should choose the positive value if it is available and requires the same number of moves? \n\n        # But note: the value 2 is achieved by adding once: one move. The value -2 is achieved by subtracting once: one move. But then why would we choose the positive one? because it allows the next element to be set with fewer moves.\n\n        # Therefore, we want to set the value to the largest multiple of a[j] that is < p. That is: \n        #   k = floor((p-1) / a[j])\n        #   then the value = k * a[j]\n        #   and the number of moves = |k|\n\n        # However, if k is positive, then we are adding k times.

But if not, then it gives the next lower multiple.\n\n        # Example: p=4, a[j]=3: then (4-1)//3 = 3//3=1, then value=3, which is <4 -> good.\n\n        # Example: p=1, a[j]=2: then (1-1)//2=0, value=0, which is <1 -> good.\n\n        # So the code for the left part:\n\n        #   for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n        #        k = (p - 1) // a[j]\n        #        # But if (p-1) is negative, then k is negative, and we want the floor: which is more negative.\n        #        # However, we can compute k = (p-1) // a[j] \n        #        # But note: in Python, for negative numbers: \n        #        #   (-2) // 3 = -1, but we want floor(-2/3) = -1 -> correct.\n        #        #   (-4) // 3 = -2, which is floor(-4/3) = -2 -> correct.\n        #        acc += abs(k)\n        #        p = k * a[j]\n\n        # But wait, what if a[j] is 0? but the problem says a_i>=1.\n\n        # However, there is a problem: if p-1 is negative, then k is negative, and then p = k * a[j] is negative.

We are to implement it.\n\n   The function is named 'modmul', and it takes x, y, and an optional c (which is 0 by default). What does it do?\n\n   Given the name, it should do modular multiplication. But it has three arguments. The only call sites are:\n\n        fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n        invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\n        comb: return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\n        invcomb: return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]))\n\n        invs: return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\n        and in the loop: \n            frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n            out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n            rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n   In all cases, it is called with two arguments, except in the combinatorial functions where it is nested.\n\n   The only call with three arguments is not present.\n\n   Therefore, the function should do: (x * y) % MOD, and if there is a third argument, then (x * y * c) % MOD? \n\n   But the default for c is 0, and 0 in multiplication would make the product 0.\n\n   Alternatively, it might be that the function is intended to do:\n\n        if c is not given: return (x * y) % MOD\n        else: return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\n   But in the calls, c is always 0 by default, and we never pass a third argument.\n\n   So we can simply do:\n\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\n   However, the problem says the answer can be huge, and modulo 998244353.\n\n   But note: the parameters can be up to 200000, and we are multiplying two numbers that are modulo 998244353, so the product can be up to about (1e6)^2 = 1e12, which is within Python's integer range, and then we can do % MOD.\n\n   But to be safe, we do:\n\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\n   However, the function is also called with three arguments in one place? the code does not show a call with three arguments, but the function signature has c=0.\n\n   Since we are not using the third argument in any call, we can ignore it.\n\n   But the function is defined with three arguments. We must use the third argument if provided.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\n   However, in the combinatorial functions, we have:\n\n        modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\n   This is (fact[x] * (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] % MOD)) % MOD.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n            res = x * y\n            if c != 0:\n                res = res * c\n            return res % MOD\n\n   But note: the multiplication might be big, but n<200000, and the numbers are modulo MOD, so they are in [0, MOD-1]. The product of three numbers might be (MOD-1)^3 ~ 1e18, which is within Python's integer range.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\n   However, the function is never called with c != 0 in the provided code. So we could also do:\n\n        return (x * y) % MOD   # and ignore c.\n\n   But the function signature has c, and we must account for it.\n\n   Since the problem says to complete the code as given, and the given has c as a parameter, we should use it.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\n   or more simply:\n\n        return (x * y * (c if c != 0 else 1)) % MOD\n\n   But note: if c is 0, then we would be multiplying by 0, which is not what we want.\n\n   The calls never pass a nonzero c? and the default is 0. In the calls with two arguments, c=0, then we want to do (x * y) % MOD.\n\n   But if we do (x * y * c) when c=0, we get 0.\n\n   So we should:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\n   or\n\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing function is:\n\n        def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n            res = x * y\n            if c != 0:\n                res = res * c\n            return res % MOD\n\n   But note: the multiplication might be big, but Python integers are arbitrary precision, and we are doing modulo at the end. It is efficient enough for n<200000? the number of multiplications is not too high.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y % MOD * c) % MOD\n\n   to avoid big integers, but the numbers are not that big.\n\n   We'll do the direct multiplication.\n\nFor program3.py:\n   The problem: given t test cases, for each test case with an integer n (up to 1e9), we are to compute the minimum number of lines needed to create at least n equilateral triangles.\n\n   The provided code has a while loop that builds an array `cnt` and then a function `solve` that does a binary search on `cnt` to find the minimal number of lines.\n\n   The while loop:\n\n        ctr = [0, 0, 0]\n        cnt = [0]\n\n        i = 0\n        tot = 0\n        s = 0\n        while tot < 10**9:\n            tot += 2*(s - ctr[i])\n            cnt.append(tot)\n            ctr[i] += 1\n            s += 1\n            i += 1\n            if i == 3: i = 0\n\n   Then the function solve(sn) does:\n\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        return str(s)\n\n   In the binary search, if cnt[m] >= t, then we set e = m. Otherwise, we need to set s to something.\n\n   In a standard binary search for the first index m such that cnt[m] >= t, we do:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\n   Then after the loop, s is the first index such that cnt[s] >= t.\n\n   In the provided code, after the binary search, we return str(s).\n\n   Therefore, the TODO is: \n\n        s = m+1\n\n   So the missing code is: \n\n        s = m+1\n\n   But note: the binary search is for the minimal number of lines (which is the index in cnt) such that cnt[index] >= t.\n\n   The array `cnt` is built for indices from 0 to some M, and cnt[i] is the total number of triangles that can be created with i lines.\n\n   The while loop builds cnt for the number of lines from 1 upwards.\n\n   The binary search then finds the minimal number of lines (which is the index) such that cnt[lines] >= n.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line is: s = m+1.\n\n   However, let me test with a small example: \n        cnt = [0, 0, 2, 3]   # for example, with 0 lines:0, 1 line:0, 2 lines:2, 3 lines:3.\n        and we want to solve for n=2: \n            s=0, e=3.\n            m = (0+3)//2 = 1, cnt[1]=0<2 -> then we do s = 1+1 = 2.\n            then s=2, e=3, m=2, cnt[2]=2>=2 -> e=2.\n            then s==e, return 2.\n\n        for n=1: \n            s=0, e=3, m=1: cnt[1]=0<1 -> s=2.\n            then m=(2+3)//2=2, cnt[2]=2>=1 -> e=2.\n            return 2.\n\n        for n=3: \n            s=0, e=3, m=1:0<3 -> s=2.\n            then m=2, cnt[2]=2<3 -> s=3.\n            then s=e=3, return 3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, for program3.py, the missing code is: \n\n        s = m+1\n\n   But note: the binary search is for the minimal number of lines, and the array `cnt` is 0-indexed by the number of lines? \n        cnt[0] = 0 (0 lines)\n        cnt[1] = ? the while loop starts with s=0, then does:\n            i=0: \n                tot += 2*(0 - ctr[0]) = 2*(0-0)=0 -> cnt becomes [0,0] then ctr[0] becomes 1, s=1, i=1.\n            then i=1:\n                tot += 2*(1 - ctr[1]) = 2*(1-0)=2, so cnt[2]=2.\n                ctr[1]=1, s=2, i=2.\n            then i=2:\n                tot += 2*(2 - ctr[2]) = 2*(2-0)=4, so tot=0+2+4=6, cnt[3]=6.\n                ctr[2]=1, s=3, i=0.\n            then i=0:\n                tot += 2*(3 - ctr[0]) = 2*(3-1)=4, so tot=6+4=10, cnt[4]=10.\n                ...\n\n   So the index in `cnt` is the number of lines.\n\n   Therefore, the binary search returns the number of lines.\n\n   So the missing code is: s = m+1.\n\n   However, the while condition is: while tot < 10**9, and we are building cnt for the number of lines until the total triangles reaches at least 10**9.\n\n   This is for the binary search up to n=10**9.\n\n   So it is safe.\n\n   Therefore, for program3.py, the missing code is: s = m+1.\n\nNow, we output the completions in JSON format.\n\nExample: \n   {\n     \"program1\": \"        k = (p - 1) // a[j]\\n        acc += abs(k)\\n        p = k * a[j]\",\n     \"program2\": \"        res = x * y\\n        if c != 0:\\n            res = res * c\\n        return res % MOD\",\n     \"program3\": \"            s = m+1\"\n   }\n\nBut note: in program1, the code is in a loop and must be indented. We output exactly the code that would replace the TODO.\n\nIn program1, the TODO is in a for loop, and we are to replace the TODO with three lines.\n\nIn program2, the TODO is the whole function.\n\nIn program3, the TODO is in the else branch of the binary search.\n\nWe output the string exactly as the code.\n\nBut note: the program2 function has a parameter with a space: \"c = 0\", but in the given code it is written as \"c = 0\". We should not change the signature.\n\nHowever, the TODO is only the body of the function.\n\nThe given program2 has:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the body.\n\nSo for program2, the completion is the body of the function.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nLet's write the completions:\n\n   program1: \n        k = (p - 1) // a[j]\n        acc += abs(k)\n        p = k * a[j]\n\n   program2:\n        res = x * y\n        if c != 0:\n            res = res * c\n        return res % MOD\n\n   program3:\n        s = m+1\n\nBut note: in program3, the code is in the else branch, and it is one line.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program3 has:\n\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with \"s = m+1\", and it should be at the same indentation.\n\nSo the completion for program3 is: \"            s = m+1\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and for program3, the missing code is the one line in the else block.\n\nAlternatively, we output the code exactly as it would appear in the program.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo for program3, we output: \"s = m+1\" without the indentation? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\nThe missing code in program3 is the line \"s = m+1\", and it should be indented by 8 spaces (because it is inside the while loop and then inside the else). \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the indentation level. But the original code has:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the line \"s = m+1\", and it should be at the same indentation as the comments and the other statements.\n\nSo in the output, we should include the indentation? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the code that replaces the TODO. In the context, it should be indented.\n\nHowever, the example output format is a JSON string. We should include the newlines and spaces as in the code.\n\nBut for program1, we have three lines, and they are indented by 8 spaces (because inside the for loop and after the comment). \n\nIn the given program1, the TODO is at:\n\n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with three lines, each indented by 8 spaces (relative to the for loop) or 12 spaces in the overall? \n\nActually, the code we output should be:\n\n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            k = (p - 1) // a[j]\n            acc += abs(k)\n            p = k * a[j]\n\nSo the three lines should be at the same indentation as the TODO comment.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON string for program1, we should have the three lines with the same indentation.\n\nBut the TODO is at 12 spaces (if we count from the beginning of the line) or 8 spaces (relative to the for loop). \n\nIn the given program1, the for loop is indented by 4 spaces (because it is inside the outer for loop), and the TODO is at 8 spaces.\n\nSo the three lines should be at 8 spaces.\n\nWe output:\n\n        k = (p - 1) // a[j]\n        acc += abs(k)\n        p = k * a[j]\n\nEach line with 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the function body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\nFor program3, the else block should be at 12 spaces, and the code \"s = m+1\" should be at 16 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must make it run correctly.\n\nSince the original code has a specific indentation, we output the code with the same indentation as the surrounding.\n\nFor program1, the surrounding is:\n\n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with three lines that are at the same indentation level.\n\nSo we output the three lines with the same indentation as the comment: which is 8 spaces (relative to the outer for loop) or 12 spaces from the margin? \n\nIn the given program1, the outer for loop is at 0 indentation? \n\nThe given program1:\n\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\nans = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    acc, p = 0, 0\n    for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    p = 0\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        x = (p + a[j]) // a[j]\n        acc += x\n        p = x * a[j]\n    ans = min(ans, acc) if ans is not None else acc\n\nThe TODO is at 8 spaces (two levels: 4 for the outer for, and 4 for the inner for).\n\nSo the three lines should be at 8 spaces.\n\nWe output:\n\n        k = (p - 1) // a[j]\n        acc += abs(k)\n        p = k * a[j]\n\nEach line with 8 spaces (which is two tabs or 8 spaces).\n\nIn Python, we use spaces, and the original uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the function body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\nFor program3, the else block is at 8 spaces (inside the while and then the if-else), and the code should be at 12 spaces.\n\nBut the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\nIn program3:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else block is at 12 spaces (3 levels: 4 for the function, 4 for the while, 4 for the if-else). The TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\nSo the code \"s = m+1\" should be at 16 spaces.\n\nBut in the output, we only output the code, not the else:.\n\nSo for program3, we output: \"                s = m+1\" (with 16 spaces) or without the spaces? \n\nThe problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the line that goes in the else branch.\n\nTo be safe, we output the line with the same indentation as the TODO comment would be in the final code.\n\nBut the TODO comment is at the same indentation as the code we will put.\n\nTherefore, for program3, we output: \"s = m+1\" without spaces? \n\nBut then when inserted, it would be at the same indentation as the else: which is 12 spaces, and the code should be 16 spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we output the code with the necessary spaces.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify, and the example output format is a string.\n\nWe will output the code as it would appear in the program, with the indentation.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and for program3, the missing code is one line, and it should be at the correct indentation.\n\nSince the JSON string can have newlines and spaces, we output the string with the spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we might output without spaces and let the user insert it with the correct indentation? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\nSo we must output the code with the correct indentation.\n\nFor program1: three lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\nFor program2: the function body, which is 4 or more spaces.\nFor program3: one line with 16 spaces.\n\nBut to be precise, let's count the spaces in the given code.\n\nIn program1, the line after the for loop is: \"    for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\" -> 4 spaces at the beginning.\nThen the next line is: \"        # TODO: Your code here\" -> 8 spaces.\n\nSo the three lines should be with 8 spaces.\n\nIn program2, the function is at 0 indentation, and the body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\nIn program3, the else: is at 12 spaces (because: the function solve: 4 spaces, then while: 8 spaces, then if-else: 12 spaces, then the else: block: 16 spaces for the code).\n\nSo for program3, the code should be at 16 spaces.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n   program1: \n        \"        k = (p - 1) // a[j]\\n        acc += abs(k)\\n        p = k * a[j]\"\n\n   program2:\n        \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\n   program3:\n        \"                s = m+1\"\n\nBut wait, in program2, the function body should be at 4 spaces, but the given code has the TODO at 4 spaces? \n\nThe given program2 has:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe function header is at 0 indentation, and the body is at 8 spaces? because it is 8 spaces for the comment.\n\nIn Python, the standard is 4 spaces for the body, but the given code uses 8 spaces for the comment.\n\nWe should use the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nSo for program2, the body should be at 8 spaces? \n\nBut the surrounding code uses 4 spaces for the body of the function? \n\nLook at the code after the function: \n\n   def inv(x):\n       return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\nThis is 4 spaces.\n\nSo we should use 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, for program2, the body should be at 4 spaces.\n\nBut the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\nThis might be a mistake in the given code.\n\n To be safe, we use 4 spaces for the body in program2.\n\n So:\n\n   program2: \n        \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\n This is:\n    Line1: 4 spaces: \"    res = x * y\"\n    Line2: 4 spaces: \"    if c != 0:\"\n    Line3: 8 spaces: \"        res = res * c\"\n    Line4: 4 spaces: \"    return res % MOD\"\n\n But the if block should be indented.\n\n Alternatively, we can do without the if by:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n\n and then the body is 8 spaces for the if and else blocks.\n\n But the given function is short, and the if and else are one-liners.\n\n However, to be consistent with the style, we use:\n\n        if c != 0:\n            res = x * y * c\n        else:\n            res = x * y\n        return res % MOD\n\n But that is longer.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and the given TODO is one line, we output the body as we see fit.\n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the body.\n\n We'll output the body with 4 spaces for the main and 8 for the if block.\n\n So:\n\n   program2: \n        body = [\n            \"res = x * y\",\n            \"if c != 0:\",\n            \"    res = res * c\",\n            \"return res % MOD\"\n        ]\n\n and then we indent each line by 4 spaces.\n\n So the string is:\n\n        \"    res = x * y\\n    if c != 0:\\n        res = res * c\\n    return res % MOD\"\n\n But the last line is not indented for the if? it is after the if.\n\n Alternatively, we can do in one line:\n\n        return (x * y * (c if c else 1)) % MOD   # but then if c=0, we multiply by 1.\n\n But this is not safe for c=0 because then we do (x * y * 1) % MOD, which is what we want.\n\n But if c is not 0, then (c if c else 1) is c, so we do (x * y * c) % MOD.\n\n However, the function is called with c=0 by default, and then we do multiplication by 1.\n\n But the if is not needed.\n\n However, the problem does not require the most efficient.\n\n But the combinatorial functions are called many times, and we are in a loop up to 200000, so we want efficiency.\n\n The one-liner: \n\n        return (x * y * (c if c else 1)) % MOD\n\n might be efficient.\n\n But note: the condition in the multiplication might be slower.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if c:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n\n This is two returns.\n\n We'll choose the if-else for clarity.\n\n So the body is:\n\n        if c:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n\n and then we indent by 4 spaces.\n\n So the string for program2 is:\n\n        \"    if c:\\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\\n    else:\\n        return (x * y) % MOD\"\n\n But note: c might be 0, which is False, and nonzero which is True.\n\n But what if c is 0? then we do the else.\n\n This is correct.\n\n However, the combinatorial functions might call with c=0, and then we do the else.\n\n But in the given code, c is always 0 in the calls. So we could just do:\n\n        return (x * y) % MOD\n\n and ignore c. But the function might be called with c not zero in the future? \n\n The provided code in program2 does not show any call with c not zero, but the function has the parameter.\n\n So to be safe, we use the if-else.\n\n Therefore, for program2, we output:\n\n        if c:\n            return (x * y * c) % MOD\n        else:\n            return (x * y) % MOD\n\n with 4 spaces for the if and else, and 8 spaces for the return statements.\n\n So the string is:\n\n        \"    if c:\\n        return (x * y * c) % MOD\\n    else:\\n        return (x * y) % MOD\"\n\n But the original TODO is at 8 spaces, and we are using 4 for the if and 8 for the return, which is standard.\n\n Now, we output the JSON."
