  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe missing part is in the SegmentTree's update method, specifically in the \"if up:\" block.\n\nLooking at the context, when we are updating a segment for adding a point (up=True), we need to adjust the values in the segment tree node. The segment tree is maintaining three values: v0, v1, v2. From the problem and the code, we can infer:\n- v0: count of points in the segment.\n- v1: sum of the values (or something related to the points) in the segment.\n- v2: sum of squares or a similar quadratic term.\n\nIn the update method, when we are adding a point (up=True), we should do the opposite of what is done for removal (up=False). In the removal (up=False) we see:\n    self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] - 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n    self.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\n    self.lazy[x] -= 1\n\nFor addition, we should do:\n    self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]   [because (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1, but note the removal does (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1?]\nBut note: the removal update does:\n    v2 becomes v2 - 2*v1 + v0   -> which is the same as v2 - (2*v1 - v0)\nFor addition, we would do the reverse: v2 becomes v2 + 2*v1 + v0? However, note that the lazy update for removal subtracts 1, so for addition we add 1.\n\nBut observe the formulas in the _push method for the children when adding a lazy value:\n    For a child node, when adding a lazy value 'la', we do:\n        v2[child] = v2[child] + 2 * la * v1[child] + la*la * v0[child]\n        v1[child] += la * v0[child]\n\nIn the update, when we are adding (up=True), we are effectively going to add 1 to the entire segment? But note the lazy update in the removal subtracts 1. So for addition, we should add 1.\n\nTherefore, for the addition block (up=True) we should do:\n    self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n    self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\n    self.lazy[x] += 1\n\nBut wait: the removal block does the above in reverse? Actually, the removal block does:\n    v2 = v2 - 2*v1 + v0   -> which is the same as if we set la=-1: \n        v2 becomes v2 + 2*(-1)*v1 + (-1)^2 * v0 = v2 - 2*v1 + v0 -> matches.\n    and then v1 becomes v1 - v0 -> which is v1 + (-1)*v0 -> matches.\n\nSo for addition, we do:\n    v2 = v2 + 2*v1 + v0   [because la=1: v2 + 2*1*v1 + 1^2*v0]\n    v1 = v1 + v0\n    lazy[x] += 1\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py in the update method for the \"if up:\" block is:\n    self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n    self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\n    self.lazy[x] += 1\n\nBut note: the removal block does the update and then sets lazy. We do the same for addition.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n    self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n    self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\n    self.lazy[x] += 1\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe missing part is in the function f(gap, c) in the binary search loop. The function ff(gap, ints) computes the energy cost when splitting the gap into 'ints' intervals (i.e., installing 'ints-1' teleporters). The function f(gap, c) is doing a binary search on the number of intervals (from 1 to gap) to find the maximum number of intervals (which we call mid) such that the reduction in cost by going from mid to mid+1 is at least c.\n\nIn the binary search, we are trying to find the maximum mid (which we call sml) such that the reduction (ff(gap, mid) - ff(gap, mid+1)) >= c.\n\nThe loop condition is while big - sml > 1. We set mid = (big+sml)//2. Then we check:\n    if a = ff(gap, mid) and b = ff(gap, mid+1), then if a-b >= c, we set sml = mid (meaning we can try a larger mid). Otherwise, we set big = mid.\n\nBut note: the current code in the loop for the if condition is:\n    if a - b >= c:\n        sml = mid\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nIn the else branch, we want to set big to mid? Because the reduction is too small, so we need to try a smaller mid.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n        big = mid\n\nBut note: the variable names in the loop: we have sml and big. We are searching in the range [sml, big]. The condition is that we want the reduction to be at least c. If it is, we can try a larger mid (so we set sml=mid). Otherwise, we set big=mid.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n        big = mid\n\nHowever, note that the function f(gap, c) returns two values: the number of teleporters installed (which is the number of intervals minus one) and the total cost for that gap when using that many intervals? Actually, the function f is intended to return the maximum number of intervals (which we call big in the binary search) and the cost for that big? But wait, the binary search in f is actually setting sml to the maximum mid such that the reduction condition holds. Then we return sml and the cost for big? \n\nBut note: after the binary search, we have:\n    return sml, ff(gap, big)\n\nBut the binary search in f sets big to the first value for which the reduction is less than c? Actually, we are trying to find the maximum mid (which we store in sml) for which the reduction is at least c. Then the next interval (mid+1) is the one that doesn't meet the condition? Then we use big = mid+1? Actually, the initial big is set to gap (the maximum possible intervals). The binary search narrows down to the point where sml is the last mid that meets the condition, and then we return sml and the cost for the next state (big) which is the state that does not meet the condition? \n\nBut note the code after the binary search in f is not present. We must return two values: the number of teleporters installed (which is the number of intervals minus one) and the cost for that gap? Actually, the function f is called in the main part to compute the cost for a given gap and a given threshold (mid, which is the cost per gap threshold). The main part is doing a binary search on the global threshold (mid) that we use for each gap.\n\nBut the missing code is just the else branch. So we set big = mid.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n        big = mid\n\nFor program3.py:\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose four contestants that form an axis-aligned rectangle such that when we split the four into two poles (each pole having two contestants) with the two younger on one pole and the two older on the other, the poles do not cross.\n\nThe note and the pictures show that the poles do not cross if and only if the two poles are the two diagonals? Actually, the problem states: \"the two poles are parallel and do not cross\". The banner is held by two poles. The two younger hold one pole and the two older hold the other. The poles are parallel to the ground? The picture shows that if the two poles are the two diagonals, they cross. If they are the opposite sides (like top and bottom, or left and right) then they don't cross.\n\nIn fact, the four points form a rectangle. The two poles are the two pairs of opposite corners? But note: the two younger must be one pair and the two older the other. The poles are the two line segments connecting the two pairs. They cross if the pairs are the two diagonals. They do not cross if the pairs are the two horizontal sides or the two vertical sides? Actually, the problem says \"parallel to the ground\", so the poles must be horizontal? But the banner is held by two poles that are parallel to the ground? Then the two poles must be horizontal? Then the two younger must be on the same horizontal line? and the two older on the same horizontal line? But wait, the rectangle might not have two horizontal sides.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"unfold the banner, using the poles to support its two ends\". The poles are held by two pairs of contestants. The two poles must be parallel and not cross. This means that the two poles must be the two horizontal sides of the rectangle? Or the two vertical sides? But note: the banner is parallel to the ground, so the poles must be horizontal? Then the two poles must be the top and bottom sides of the rectangle? Then the two younger must be the two endpoints of one horizontal side and the two older the other horizontal side? But then the two younger are on the same row? and the two older on the same row? \n\nHowever, the problem does not require the poles to be horizontal sides. It says \"parallel to the ground\", meaning they are horizontal. Therefore, the two poles must be horizontal. Therefore, the two younger must be on the same row and the two older on the same row? But then the rectangle would have two horizontal sides. But note: the rectangle is defined by four points: (i1, j1), (i1, j2), (i2, j1), (i2, j2). The two horizontal sides are the top and bottom. The two poles would be the top side (row i1, columns j1 and j2) and the bottom side (row i2, columns j1 and j2). Then the two younger could be on the top and the two older on the bottom? Or vice versa? But note: the two younger must be one pole and the two older the other. So if the top side has the two younger and the bottom the two older, then that's one pole (top) and the other pole (bottom). Similarly, if the top has the two older and the bottom the two younger, that's also valid? But wait, the problem says: \"the two younger contestants hold one of the poles, while the two older contestants hold the other\". So the two younger must be one entire pole (so one entire side) and the two older the other.\n\nBut note: the four points in the rectangle have four distinct ages. The two younger are the two smallest, and the two older are the two largest. The two smallest must form one side and the two largest the other. However, the two smallest might not be on the same row? They might be on the same column? But then the pole would be vertical, which is not parallel to the ground.\n\nTherefore, the only valid arrangements are when the two smallest are on the same row and the two largest are on the same row? Or the two smallest on the same column and the two largest on the same column? But the problem says the banner is held with poles parallel to the ground, meaning horizontal. So we require the two poles to be horizontal. Therefore, the two younger must be on the same row and the two older on the same row? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire side of the rectangle to be held? The banner is held by two poles, each pole being a straight line. The two poles are the two horizontal sides of the rectangle? Then the two younger must be the two endpoints of one horizontal side and the two older the endpoints of the other horizontal side.\n\nTherefore, the four points must form a rectangle and the two younger must be the two endpoints of one horizontal side and the two older the endpoints of the other horizontal side. But note: the rectangle has two horizontal sides: the top and the bottom. The two younger could be on the top and the two older on the bottom? Or the two younger on the bottom and the two older on the top? Actually, the two younger are the two smallest, so they must be the two that are lower in the age order. The two older are the two largest.\n\nBut the arrangement of the rectangle: the two smallest might be the top-left and top-right? Then the two largest are the bottom-left and bottom-right? Then the top side is the two smallest and the bottom side the two largest. This is valid. Similarly, if the two smallest are the bottom side and the two largest the top side, that is also valid.\n\nBut what if the two smallest are the top-left and bottom-left? Then they form a vertical side. Then we cannot use that as a pole because it would be vertical. Therefore, we require that the two smallest form a horizontal side and the two largest form a horizontal side.\n\nSimilarly, we could have the two smallest form a vertical side and the two largest form a vertical side? Then we could have two vertical poles? But the problem says the banner is parallel to the ground, so the poles must be horizontal. Therefore, vertical poles are not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the valid arrangements are only when the two smallest form a horizontal side and the two largest form a horizontal side? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"the two poles are parallel and do not cross\". If we have two vertical poles, they are parallel (both vertical) and they don't cross? However, the problem states the banner is parallel to the ground, meaning the poles must be horizontal? So we only count the horizontal arrangements.\n\nTherefore, we must count the rectangles for which the two smallest are on the same row and the two largest are on the same row.\n\nBut note: the rectangle has two horizontal sides. The two smallest must be the endpoints of one horizontal side and the two largest the endpoints of the other horizontal side. However, the two smallest might be the top side and the two largest the bottom side? Or the two smallest the bottom side and the two largest the top side? Both are valid.\n\nBut note: the rectangle is defined by two distinct rows and two distinct columns. The two smallest must be on the same row? Then the two smallest must be the two endpoints of one of the two horizontal sides. Similarly, the two largest must be on the same row (the other horizontal side).\n\nTherefore, we can count the rectangles by iterating over pairs of rows and pairs of columns? But that would be O(n^4). We need an efficient solution.\n\nLooking at the provided code in program3.py:\n\nWe have:\n    ijs = [0] * (N ** 2)\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThen we have:\n    row_sum = [0] * N\n    col_sum = [0] * N\n    for i, j in ijs:\n        l_row = row_sum[i]\n        g_row = N - 1 - row_sum[i]\n        l_col = col_sum[j]\n        g_col = N - 1 - col_sum[j]\n        answer += l_col * g_row + g_col * l_row\n        row_sum[i] += 1\n        col_sum[j] += 1\n\n    assert answer % 2 == 0\n    print(answer // 2)\n\nThe array ijs is being built. Then we iterate over the positions (i, j) in the order of increasing age? Or decreasing? The problem says the ages are distinct and between 1 and n^2.\n\nThe code after the loop uses row_sum and col_sum to count the number of points that have been processed so far in the same row and same column. The variables l_row and g_row are the number of points already processed in the same row i that are less than the current point (in the order of processing) and greater? Actually, the processing order: we are iterating over the points in a specific order. The variables l_row is the count of points in row i that have been processed so far (so that are smaller in the processing order) and g_row the ones that are not processed yet (so that will be processed later, hence greater in the processing order). Similarly for columns.\n\nThe formula: \n    answer += l_col * g_row + g_col * l_row\n\nThis counts pairs? And then we divide by 2 at the end.\n\nWhat is the processing order? The array ijs is built by iterating over the matrix. But the TODO is to assign to ijs. The comment says: \n    ijs = [0] * (N ** 2)\n\nWe are going to fill this array with tuples (i, j) for each position. But the order matters: the for loop then iterates over ijs in the order we stored.\n\nBut note: the problem says the ages are distinct. We want to process the points in increasing order of age? Then the row_sum and col_sum arrays will count the number of points that are younger (and have been processed) in the same row and same column.\n\nThe formula then: \n    l_row: number of younger points in the same row i (so processed so far in row i)\n    g_row: number of older points in the same row i (not processed yet in row i) -> but note: we haven't processed the current point? We are about to process it. So the row_sum[i] is the count of younger points in row i. Then the total points in row i is N, so the older points in row i is N - 1 - row_sum[i] (because we are going to add the current point, so the remaining are the ones that are older and not processed).\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nThen the term: \n    l_col * g_row: \n        l_col: number of younger points in the same column j\n        g_row: number of older points in the same row i\n    and \n    g_col * l_row: \n        g_col: number of older points in the same column j\n        l_row: number of younger points in the same row i\n\nBut note: we are counting pairs? Actually, we are counting pairs of points that form a rectangle? \n\nAlternatively, the problem is known and the solution is to count the number of pairs of points (i, j) and (k, l) such that they form a rectangle and the two smallest are on the same row and the two largest on the same row? \n\nBut the known solution for this problem (from SWERC 2020) is to use the inclusion-exclusion: total rectangles minus the ones that are bad. However, the provided code does not look like that.\n\nAlternatively, the known solution is to iterate by the age and use a Fenwick tree? But the provided code uses a simpler method.\n\nBut note: the formula counts for each point (i, j) the number of pairs (one from the same row and one from the same column) that are in a certain relation? \n\nActually, the formula for a fixed point (i, j) being the oldest of the two smallest? Or the youngest? \n\nWe are iterating in increasing order of age. So when we process a point (i, j), we have:\n    l_row: number of younger points in row i\n    l_col: number of younger points in column j\n\n    g_row: number of older points in row i (that will be processed later)\n    g_col: number of older points in column j\n\nThen the term l_col * g_row: \n    This counts pairs: a younger point in the same column j (say at (i1, j)) and an older point in the same row i (say at (i, j1)). Then we have a rectangle with points: (i, j), (i, j1), (i1, j), and (i1, j1). But note: the point (i1, j1) might not exist? \n\nBut we are counting the pairs of points that are in the same row and same column as the current point? Actually, the rectangle is defined by the current point (i, j) and the two other points: (i, j1) and (i1, j) and then the fourth point (i1, j1). However, we don't have the fourth point? \n\nAlternatively, the known solution for the problem \"Drone Photo\" is to count the number of rectangles that are good. The good rectangles are those that have the two smallest on the same row. The total number of rectangles is C(n,2) * C(n,2) (choosing two rows and two columns). Then subtract the bad ones? \n\nBut the provided code does not do that.\n\nLooking at the code: \n    answer += l_col * g_row + g_col * l_row\n\nAnd then we update row_sum and col_sum.\n\nThis formula is symmetric? And then we divide by 2 at the end.\n\nWhat is the meaning? \n\nConsider a rectangle defined by rows i and k, and columns j and l. The four points: \n    A = (i, j), B = (i, l), C = (k, j), D = (k, l)\n\nThe two smallest must be on the same row. There are two possibilities: \n    Possibility 1: the two smallest are on row i: then the two smallest are A and B (if A and B are the two smallest) and the two largest are C and D (on row k). \n    Possibility 2: the two smallest are on row k: then the two smallest are C and D and the two largest are A and B.\n\nBut note: the two smallest must be the two smallest of the four. So if the two smallest are on row i, then the two smallest are A and B (and they are the two smallest overall) and the two largest are C and D. Similarly for the other.\n\nHow do we count the rectangles for which the two smallest are on row i? \n    Condition: the minimum of the four is one of A or B? Actually, the two smallest must be A and B. So we require that the two smallest of the four are A and B. This happens if and only if the smallest of the four is in row i and the second smallest is also in row i? \n\nBut note: the two smallest are the two in row i? Then we require:\n    min(A, B) < min(C, D)   and \n    the two smallest are A and B? Actually, the two smallest must be the two in row i. So we require that the two in row i are smaller than the two in row k? \n\nSimilarly, for the two smallest to be in row k, we require that the two in row k are smaller than the two in row i? \n\nBut wait, that is not the same. Actually, the two smallest must be the two in one row. So we require that the two smallest are in the same row. This can be row i or row k.\n\nTherefore, the total number of good rectangles is the number of rectangles for which the two smallest are in the same row.\n\nBut note: the two smallest might be in the same column? Then we would have a vertical pole? But we decided that we only count horizontal poles? Actually, the problem requires the poles to be horizontal. Therefore, the two smallest must be on the same row (so that the pole is horizontal) and the two largest must be on the same row (the other row). So the condition is that the two smallest are on the same row and the two largest are on the same row? But note: the two smallest are always on the same row (by the condition) and the two largest then automatically on the other row? \n\nTherefore, we only need to count the rectangles for which the two smallest are on the same row.\n\nHow to count that? \n\nWe can iterate over the two rows and two columns? That is O(n^4). We need O(n^2).\n\nThe known solution (from the code) is to process the points in increasing order of age. For each point (i, j), we consider it as the second smallest in the rectangle? Or the smallest? \n\nActually, the formula: \n    l_col * g_row: \n        l_col: the number of younger points in column j (so points that are in column j and have been processed, so they are younger than the current)\n        g_row: the number of older points in row i (points that are in row i and have not been processed, so they are older)\n\nThen the product l_col * g_row: \n    For each younger point in column j (say at (k, j)) and for each older point in row i (say at (i, l)), we have a rectangle with points: (i, j), (i, l), (k, j), and (k, l). \n\nBut note: the current point (i, j) is the second smallest? The youngest is the point (k, j) (because it is younger). Then the two smallest are (k, j) and (k, l)? But we don't have (k, l) in the count? \n\nAlternatively, the rectangle is defined by the two rows i and k and the two columns j and l. The four points: \n    (i, j), (i, l), (k, j), (k, l)\n\nThe two smallest: \n    The youngest is (k, j) (because we are processing in increasing order, and (k, j) is already processed). The current point (i, j) is the next smallest? Then the two smallest are (k, j) and (i, j)? But they are not on the same row? \n\nThis does not form a horizontal side.\n\nAlternatively, the known solution for the problem (from the SWERC 2020) is to count the number of rectangles that are good by using the following:\n\n    total_rectangles = C(n,2) * C(n,2)   [choosing two rows and two columns]\n\n    Then subtract the rectangles that are bad (the ones that have the two smallest on a diagonal).\n\nBut the provided code does not do that.\n\nLooking at the provided code: \n    We are building an array ijs of length N**2. We are going to store the positions (i, j) for each value. But the order: we want to process the points in increasing order of age.\n\nSo the TODO is to assign to ijs the positions in increasing order of the age.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n    ijs = [0] * (N ** 2 + 1)   # but note: we have N**2 points, and we are indexing from 0 to N**2-1.\n\n    We want to store for each age, the position (i, j). But the matrix As has the ages.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                age = As[i][j]\n                # we want to store the position (i, j) at index (age-1) in ijs? \n                # because the ages are from 1 to N**2.\n\n        Then we can do: \n            ijs[age-1] = (i, j)\n\n    But note: the array ijs is defined as [0] * (N**2). We can do:\n\n        ijs = [None] * (N*N)\n\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                age = As[i][j]\n                ijs[age-1] = (i, j)\n\n    Then the for loop later: \n        for i, j in ijs: \n            ... \n\n    will iterate over the points in increasing order of age.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n        age = As[i][j]\n        ijs[age-1] = (i, j)\n\nBut note: the array ijs was defined as [0] * (N ** 2). We are going to assign to the (age-1)-th element. This is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that the array ijs has length N**2. The ages are from 1 to N**2, so we can index by age-1.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n        ijs[As[i][j]-1] = (i, j)\n\nBut note: the array ijs is of length N**2, and we are iterating over i and j. We are assigning to the position As[i][j]-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n        pos = As[i][j] - 1\n        ijs[pos] = (i, j)\n\nBut the one-liner is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for the three programs:\n\nprogram1.py: \n    self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n    self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\n    self.lazy[x] += 1\n\nprogram2.py: \n        big = mid\n\nprogram3.py: \n        ijs[As[i][j]-1] = (i, j)\n\nNow, we output in JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\\n        self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\\n        self.lazy[x] += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"        big = mid\",\n    \"program3\": \"        ijs[As[i][j]-1] = (i, j)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has three lines. We must preserve the indentation.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing code for program1.py is the entire block for the \"if up:\" case. The existing code for the else is already there.\n\nBut note: the existing code for the else is:\n\n            else:\n                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] - 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n                self.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\n                self.lazy[x] -= 1\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with three lines.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, we are replacing the TODO with one line.\n\nFor program3.py, we are replacing the TODO with one line.\n\nWe output the exact code that should be placed in the TODO.\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the TODO is in the middle of the update method. The code we output must be at the same indentation level.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\\n        self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\\n        self.lazy[x] += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"        big = mid\",\n    \"program3\": \"        ijs[As[i][j]-1] = (i, j)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has 8 leading spaces? The existing code in the else branch has 16 spaces? Actually, the update method is indented by 4, then the if block is indented by 8, then the if up: block is indented by 12. The TODO is at indentation level 12. Then the three lines we write should be at level 16? \n\nBut the existing else branch is:\n\n            else:\n                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] - 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n                self.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\n                self.lazy[x] -= 1\n\nSo the three lines in the else are at 16 spaces. Therefore, the if up: block should be:\n\n            if up:\n                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n                self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\n                self.lazy[x] += 1\n\nSo the three lines we output should be indented by 16 spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. We are replacing the TODO comment. The TODO comment is at 16 spaces? Actually, the TODO is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we replace that comment with three lines, each starting with 16 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not require the exact indentation? It says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nWe output the three lines as they would appear in the program, with the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    \"program1\": \"                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\\n                self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\\n                self.lazy[x] += 1\"\n\nBut wait, the existing else branch is at 16 spaces. So we do the same for the if branch.\n\nAlternatively, the code in the update method is:\n\n        if a <= l and r <= b:\n            if up:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] - 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n                self.v1[x] -= self.v0[x]\n                self.lazy[x] -= 1\n            return\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with three lines. The three lines should be at the same indentation as the else branch.\n\nTherefore, the three lines should be indented by 16 spaces (relative to the start of the line). \n\nBut the else branch is at 12 (for the else:) and 16 for the inner. So the if up: branch should have:\n\n            if up:\n                self.v2[x] = ...   [at 16 spaces]\n                ...\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\n                self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\n                self.lazy[x] += 1\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing line is at the same indentation as the if branch. The existing if branch has:\n\n        if a - b >= c:\n            sml = mid\n\nSo the else branch should be:\n\n        else:\n            big = mid\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            big = mid\n\nBut note: the existing code in the else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with \"big = mid\", at the same indentation as the if branch.\n\nFor program3.py, the missing line is in the double loop. The existing code:\n\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace with:\n\n            ijs[As[i][j]-1] = (i, j)\n\nSo at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\\n                self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\\n                self.lazy[x] += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"            big = mid\",\n    \"program3\": \"            ijs[As[i][j]-1] = (i, j)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has three lines. We must include the newlines.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the string with the newline escapes.\n\nLet me write the exact strings:\n\nprogram1: \"                self.v2[x] = self.v2[x] + 2 * self.v1[x] + self.v0[x]\\n                self.v1[x] += self.v0[x]\\n                self.lazy[x] += 1\"\n\nprogram2: \"            big = mid\"\n\nprogram3: \"            ijs[As[i][j]-1] = (i, j)\"\n\nBut note: the program3.py code: we are using (i, j). The variable names are i and j.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the matrix As is stored in a variable named As. We are using that.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as described."
