The dirty cells: \n                row0: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=0? -> wait, row0: '0100' -> (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0.\n                row1: (1,0)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=1. We clean (0,1) -> then dirty cells: row1: (1,0) and (1,3). Then the robot:\n                (0,0) -> (1,0) [cleans (1,0)] -> then from (1,0): the dirty cells: \n                    (1,3): distance = |1-1|+|0-3|=3\n                    (0,3): distance = |1-0|+|0-3|=4\n                so the closest is (1,3) -> then moves to (1,3) and cleans it. Then the next: (0,3) is dirty? -> then moves to (0,3). So the robot cleans: (0,0) is already clean, then (1,0), (1,3), (0,3). But (0,3) was clean? no, we cleaned it? Actually, the grid after cleaning (0,1) by us: \n                row0: [0,0,0,0] -> but wait, the input row0: '0100' -> we clean (0,1) -> becomes 0. Then row0: [0,0,0,0]? \n                row1: [1,0,0,1] -> we clean nothing else? so (1,0) and (1,3) are dirty. Then the robot cleans (1,0) and (1,3). Then the entire grid is clean. The number of dirty cells we left: we cleaned one (the (0,1)) and the robot cleaned two -> total dirty cells initially: 3 (because row0: one at (0,1) and row1: two at (1,0) and (1,3)). We left 2 dirty cells for the robot? But the problem says: \"maximum possible number of cells you can leave dirty\" -> meaning we leave as many as possible? We left 2 dirty cells? However, the example says: \"In the third example, you can clean the cell (1,2)\" -> meaning we clean one cell, so we leave 3-1=2? The answer for example 3 is 2? But the example output: the robot cleans 4 cells? Actually, the robot cleans the starting cell? no, the starting cell is clean. The robot cleans the dirty cells it visits. The robot cleans (1,0) and (1,3) -> two cells.",

Robot Cleaner\" in a 2xN grid (problem link: not provided) uses:\n\n                      dp[i][0] = a[1][i] + max(dp[i+1][0], (a[0][i+1] + a[1][i+1] + dp[i+2][1]) )\n                      dp[i][1] = a[0][i] + max(dp[i+1][1], (a[0][i+1] + a[1][i+1] + dp[i+2][0]) ) But that is for a different problem.

Then: dp[0][0] = max(0, 1 + dp[1][1]) = max(0, 1+0)=1. Then the answer is 1. But the example: \n                         We have two rows, two columns: \n                             (0,0): clean, (0,1): clean. (1,0): dirty, (1,1): clean. We can clean (1,0) arbitrarily -> then we leave 0 dirty cells? or we can leave it and the robot will clean it? The robot starts at (0,0). The only dirty cell is (1,0) at distance 1. Then the robot cleans it -> no malfunction. So we can leave 1 dirty cell? Therefore, the answer should be 1. So the recurrence works.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is to compute the maximum sum of cells attacked by a bishop on a grid. The bishop attacks diagonally in all four directions.\n\n The provided code sets up two arrays: `left` and `right` (for the two main diagonal directions). The idea is to precompute the sum of each diagonal (both the main diagonals from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left).\n\n However, note that the current code has a loop to fill `left` and `right` arrays but the inner part is missing.\n\n We note:\n   - The diagonal for \"left\" (or top-left to bottom-right) can be indexed by `a+b` (row index + column index). The indices for this diagonal range from 0 to (A+B-2) -> total of A+B-1 diagonals.\n   - The diagonal for \"right\" (or top-right to bottom-left) can be indexed by `a + (B-1-b)` (which is the same as `a - b + (B-1)`). Alternatively, we can use `a - b` but to avoid negative indices, we can use `a + (B-1-b)` which gives an index from 0 to (A+B-2) as well.\n\n The missing code inside the double loop should add the current cell value to the corresponding diagonal in `left` and `right`.\n\n So, we can do:\n   left_index = a + b\n   right_index = a + (B - 1 - b)   [Note: because in the right diagonal, as we move down, the column decreases]\n\n But note: the array `right` is defined for the same range [0, C-1] where C = A+B-1.\n\n Therefore, the missing code is:\n   left[a+b] += nums[a][b]\n   right[a + (B-1-b)] += nums[a][b]\n\n However, note that the provided code already computes the indices in the later part as:\n   left_index = a + b\n   right_index = a + B - 1 - b\n\n So we can use the same formulas in the precomputation.\n\n Thus, the missing two lines are:\n   left[a+b] += nums[a][b]\n   right[a + B - 1 - b] += nums[a][b]\n\n But note: the arrays `left` and `right` are initialized to zeros and we are accumulating the sums.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem is to count the number of distinct multisets of palindromic numbers that sum to n (order doesn't matter). This is a classic unbounded knapsack (coin change) problem where the coins are the palindromic numbers.\n\n The code already:\n   - Defines m=40001 and d=10**9+7.\n   - Builds a list `p` of palindromic numbers from 1 to m-1 (which are palindromic when represented as string).\n   - Initializes an array `a` of zeros of length m+1 (indexed 0..m) with a[0]=1 (the base case: one way to make sum 0).\n\n Then, for each palindromic number `i` (which is a coin), we iterate j from i to m (which is 40000) and update the dp array.\n\n The recurrence for the coin change problem (counting distinct multisets) is:\n   a[j] = (a[j] + a[j - i]) % d\n\n So the missing line is:\n   a[j] = (a[j] + a[j - i]) % d\n\n However, note: the problem says \"distinct multisets\", and the coin change problem (unbounded) with coins being the palindromic numbers is exactly what we need.\n\n But note: the problem states that the same multiset in different orders is considered the same. The coin change algorithm (using the dp where we iterate coins and then j from coin to n) naturally counts multisets (order doesn't matter).\n\n Therefore, the missing line is: \n   a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\nFor program3.py:\n The problem: We have a 2 x n grid. The robot starts at (1,1) (which is clean). We can clean some dirty cells arbitrarily (but cannot make clean dirty) and we want to maximize the number of dirty cells we leave (so that the robot doesn't malfunction). The robot cleans by always going to the closest dirty cell (by Manhattan distance). If there are multiple closest dirty cells at any step, the robot malfunctions.\n\n We are to compute the maximum number of dirty cells we can leave (without causing malfunction).\n\n The provided code:\n   - Reads n and two lines of the grid (each of length n) and appends a 0 at the end (so the grid has two rows and n+1 columns? Actually, it appends [0] to each row, so the grid becomes 2 x (n+1) with the last column being 0?).\n\n   - Then it creates a dp table: dp[i][j] for i in [0, n] and j in [0,1]. The state dp[i][j] seems to represent the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left (or the maximum path length? or the maximum dirty cells that can be cleaned without malfunction?) starting from column i and row j, but the base case is set for the last column? Actually, the base case is set for the last but one column (index N-1) as:\n        dp[N-1][j] = G[1-j][N-1]   # which is the value in the opposite row at the next column? \n\n   However, note the base case: at the last column (index N-1, 0-indexed) we set:\n        dp[N-1][0] = G[1][N-1]   # because 1-0 = 1 -> row1 at column N-1\n        dp[N-1][1] = G[0][N-1]   # because 1-1=0 -> row0 at column N-1\n\n   But then the grid has been extended to have an extra column (index N) with zeros. So the grid at column N-1 is the last real column.\n\n   The recurrence:\n        for i from N-2 down to 0, and for j in {0,1}:\n            dp[i][j] = G[j][i+1] + dp[i+1][j]   # meaning: we take the dirty cell in the same row next column (if present) and then the state from the same row at next column? \n\n        Then, if the opposite row at the same column (G[1-j][i]) is dirty, we consider an alternative:\n\n            if G[j][i+1] is dirty (i.e., 1), then:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n\n            else, we have an alternative? The TODO is for the else part.\n\n   What is the meaning? The problem is about the robot's path. The robot must always go to the closest dirty cell. The closest dirty cell might be in the same row (next column) or in the opposite row (same column or next column). However, note that the Manhattan distance:\n\n        From (j, i) to (j, i+1): distance = 1\n        From (j, i) to (1-j, i): distance = 1 (because |j - (1-j)| + |i-i| = 1+0=1)\n        From (j, i) to (1-j, i+1): distance = |j - (1-j)| + |i - (i+1)| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n   So the closest dirty cells are in the same row next column and the opposite row same column.\n\n   However, if both are present, then we have two at distance 1 -> malfunction. Therefore, we cannot have both G[j][i+1] and G[1-j][i] dirty at the same time? But note: we are allowed to clean some cells arbitrarily. We are trying to maximize the number of dirty cells left. So we have two choices:\n\n        Option 1: Clean the opposite row same column (G[1-j][i]) and then we can only go to the same row next column? Then we get G[j][i+1] and then the state from (j, i+1).\n\n        Option 2: Clean the same row next column (G[j][i+1]) and then we can go to the opposite row same column? Then from (1-j, i) we can move? But note: after cleaning (1-j, i), the robot is at (1-j, i). Then the next dirty cells: \n            - (1-j, i+1): distance = 1\n            - (j, i+1) is cleaned? so not there? \n            - (1-j, i+2): distance = 2\n            - (j, i): cleaned? \n            - (j, i+2): distance = 2? \n            But note: we are at (1-j, i). The closest dirty cell might be (1-j, i+1) if present, then (1-j, i+2) is not the closest? \n\n        Actually, the recurrence in the if branch (when G[j][i+1] is dirty) considers going to the opposite row same column and then taking two steps: \n            step1: clean (1-j, i) -> then we are at (1-j, i). Then we must clean (1-j, i+1) and (1-j, i+2) is the next? But wait, the expression is:\n                1 (for cleaning (1-j, i)) + G[1-j][i+1] (which is 1 if dirty, 0 if not) + G[1-j][i+2] (similarly) + dp[i+2][1-j]\n\n        This seems to be a jump: from (j,i) we clean (1-j,i) and then we are forced to clean the entire segment in the opposite row from i+1 to ...? But note: after cleaning (1-j,i), the robot is at (1-j,i). Then the next closest dirty cell in the opposite row might be at i+1? Then we clean that and then we are at (1-j, i+1). Then the next? But the recurrence then jumps to i+2? \n\n        Actually, the recurrence is designed for a pattern: \n          We are at (j, i). We clean (1-j, i) -> then we move to (1-j, i). Then we must clean the next in the same row (i+1) and then the next (i+2) in the same row? But note: if we clean (1-j, i) and then (1-j, i+1), then we are at (1-j, i+1). Then the next dirty cell in the same row (1-j) at i+2 is at distance 1? But what about the row j at i+1? We cleaned it? Actually, we did not clean j at i+1? \n\n        However, note: we are in the state where we are at (1-j, i+1). The cell (j, i+1) is dirty? But we are in the state where we cleaned the opposite row at i? and then we are at (1-j, i). Then we cleaned (1-j, i+1) and now at (1-j, i+1). The cell (j, i+1) is still dirty? Then the distance from (1-j, i+1) to (j, i+1) is 1. So we have two choices: (1-j, i+2) and (j, i+1) are both at distance 1? -> malfunction.\n\n        Therefore, we must clean (j, i+1) as well? But wait, the recurrence condition: we are in the branch where G[j][i+1] is dirty? Then we cannot leave it? \n\n        Actually, the recurrence in the if branch (when G[j][i+1] is dirty) is not applicable? Then the alternative is to clean both (j, i+1) and (1-j, i+1) and then jump to i+2? \n\n        But note: the recurrence does:\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n\n        This seems to assume that we clean (1-j, i) and then we clean the entire opposite row from i+1 to the end? But that doesn't account for the row j at i+1? \n\n        Alternatively, the intended solution might be:\n\n        We have two options at state (i, j):\n          Option 1: Clean the same row next column (if dirty) and then continue in the same row: \n                dp[i][j] = G[j][i+1] + dp[i+1][j]\n\n          Option 2: If the opposite row at the same column is dirty, then we can clean that. But then we have two possibilities:\n\n            Case 2a: If the same row next column (G[j][i+1]) is dirty, then we cannot leave it because then from (1-j, i) we would have two closest: (j, i+1) and (1-j, i+1) (if the latter is dirty) at distance 1? So we must clean (1-j, i+1) as well? Then we are at (1-j, i+1). Then we must clean (1-j, i+2) if dirty? and then we can continue from (1-j, i+2). But note: what about (j, i+1)? We haven't cleaned it? Then from (1-j, i+1) we have (j, i+1) at distance 1 and (1-j, i+2) at distance 1? -> malfunction. So we must clean (j, i+1) as well? \n\n            Actually, the recurrence in the if branch does not account for cleaning (j, i+1). It only accounts for cleaning the opposite row at i+1 and i+2? \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        After reading the note in the problem: the examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            n=2\n            row0: '10'\n            row1: '10'\n            We clean (0,1) -> then the robot path: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). So we left 2 dirty cells? But the answer is 2? Actually, we started with 3 dirty cells? (0,0) is clean. Then dirty: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). We clean (0,1) -> then we leave 2 dirty cells.\n\n        Example 2:\n            n=2\n            row0: '10'\n            row1: '01'\n            We leave all -> robot: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1). So we leave 2 dirty cells.\n\n        Example 3:\n            n=4\n            row0: '1000'\n            row1: '1001'\n            We clean (0,1) -> then robot: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3). So we leave 4 dirty cells? But the grid has 4 dirty cells initially? Actually, we cleaned one, so we leave 3? But the example says we clean (0,1) so we leave 4? Actually, the grid initially: \n                row0: 1 (clean at (0,0) is the robot, so actually the grid has: \n                    row0: [0 at (0,0), 1 at (0,1), 0, 0] -> but wait the input: \n                    The starting cell (1,1) is clean -> so (0,0) is clean? \n                row0: '10' -> meaning (0,0)=1? but the robot is at (0,0) so it's clean -> represented as 0? \n\n            Actually, the input: \n                The first line: n\n                Then two lines: \n                    line1: the first row (which is row0) of n characters\n                    line2: the second row (row1) of n characters\n\n            The starting cell (1,1) is the first character of the first row? and it is clean -> so the first character of the first row is '0'. \n\n            Example 3: \n                n=4\n                row0: \"1000\" -> so (0,0)=1? but that would be dirty? but the robot is at (0,0) so it must be clean? \n\n            Correction: the problem says: \"the starting cell of the robot (1,1) is clean\". And the grid representation: 0 denotes clean, 1 denotes dirty.\n\n            So the grid for example 3 must have the first cell as 0? \n\n            Actually, the note says: \"In the third example, you can clean the cell (1,2)\" -> meaning row0, column1 (0-indexed: row0, index1). \n\n            The grid for example 3: \n                row0: [0, 1, 0, 0]   -> because the robot is at (0,0) so it's clean (0) and then (0,1) is dirty (1) and then two zeros.\n                row1: [1,0,0,1] \n\n            Then we clean (0,1) -> so row0 becomes [0,0,0,0] and row1 remains [1,0,0,1]. Then the robot:\n                (0,0) -> (1,0) [distance=1] -> then from (1,0): the dirty cells: \n                    (1,3): distance = 3\n                    (0,2): distance = 2? \n                    (0,3): distance = 4? \n                Actually, the closest is (1,0) itself? but it's already clean? \n\n            The note says: \n                (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (1,4)\n\n            So the grid is 1-indexed? The starting cell is (1,1) and the grid has 2 rows and 4 columns.\n\n            In 0-indexed:\n                (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3)\n\n            So the grid:\n                row0: [0, ...] at (0,0) is clean.\n                row0: (0,1) is dirty? (1) -> we clean that -> becomes clean.\n                row1: (1,0) is dirty? (1) -> then (1,2) and (1,3) are dirty? and (0,3) is dirty? \n\n            The grid after cleaning (0,1):\n                row0: [0,0,0,1]   (because the last is 1? but the input was row0: \"1000\" -> becomes [1,0,0,0] but that doesn't match) \n\n            Let me re-read: \n                \"In the third example, you can clean the cell (1,2)\" -> meaning row0, column1 (if we consider 1-indexed: row1, column2) -> in 0-indexed: row0, column1.\n\n            The input for example 3: \n                row0: \"1000\" -> in 0-indexed: \n                    (0,0)=1 -> but the robot is at (0,0) so it must be clean? -> so that 1 should be 0? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"the starting cell (1,1) is clean\". So the first character of the first row is the starting cell and must be 0.\n\n            Therefore, the example 3 input:\n                row0: \"0000\" is not? \n\n            The note says: \"In the third example, you can clean the cell (1,2)\" -> so the grid initially has (1,2) dirty? \n\n            The example: \n                n=4\n                row0: '1000' -> but the starting cell (0,0) is 1? that would be dirty? -> that doesn't match.\n\n            After checking the problem statement: the starting cell is clean. So the first character of the first row must be 0.\n\n            Therefore, the example 3 input must be:\n                row0: '0100'   -> because we clean the cell (1,2) which is the second character of the first row? \n                row1: '1001'\n\n            Then the robot starts at (0,0) (which is clean). The dirty cells: \n                row0: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=0? -> wait, row0: '0100' -> (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0.\n                row1: (1,0)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=1.\n\n            We clean (0,1) -> then dirty cells: row1: (1,0) and (1,3). Then the robot:\n                (0,0) -> (1,0) [cleans (1,0)] -> then from (1,0): the dirty cells: \n                    (1,3): distance = |1-1|+|0-3|=3\n                    (0,3): distance = |1-0|+|0-3|=4\n                so the closest is (1,3) -> then moves to (1,3) and cleans it. Then the next: (0,3) is dirty? -> then moves to (0,3). \n\n            So the robot cleans: (0,0) is already clean, then (1,0), (1,3), (0,3). But (0,3) was clean? no, we cleaned it? \n\n            Actually, the grid after cleaning (0,1) by us: \n                row0: [0,0,0,0] -> but wait, the input row0: '0100' -> we clean (0,1) -> becomes 0. Then row0: [0,0,0,0]? \n                row1: [1,0,0,1] -> we clean nothing else? so (1,0) and (1,3) are dirty.\n\n            Then the robot cleans (1,0) and (1,3). Then the entire grid is clean.\n\n            The number of dirty cells we left: we cleaned one (the (0,1)) and the robot cleaned two -> total dirty cells initially: 3 (because row0: one at (0,1) and row1: two at (1,0) and (1,3)). We left 2 dirty cells for the robot? \n\n            But the problem says: \"maximum possible number of cells you can leave dirty\" -> meaning we leave as many as possible? We left 2 dirty cells? \n\n            However, the example says: \"In the third example, you can clean the cell (1,2)\" -> meaning we clean one cell, so we leave 3-1=2? \n\n            The answer for example 3 is 2? \n\n            But the example output: the robot cleans 4 cells? \n\n            Actually, the robot cleans the starting cell? no, the starting cell is clean. The robot cleans the dirty cells it visits. The robot cleans (1,0) and (1,3) -> two cells. \n\n            The problem: we want to maximize the number of dirty cells we leave (so that the robot cleans them without malfunction). We are allowed to clean some arbitrarily. The maximum we can leave is 2? \n\n            However, the example 2: we left 2 dirty cells -> so the answer for example 2 is 2? \n\n            Example 1: we left 2 dirty cells -> answer 2? \n\n            Example 4: the hallway is already clean -> we leave 0.\n\n            But the problem says: \"maximum possible number of cells you can leave dirty\" -> so we output that number.\n\n            Now, the recurrence:\n\n            The dp is defined from the end backwards.\n\n            The state: dp[i][j] = the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left (and cleaned by the robot without malfunction) starting from the cell (j, i) and considering columns from i to n-1.\n\n            Base case: at the last column (i = n-1), we can only clean the opposite row at the same column? \n                dp[n-1][0] = G[1][n-1]   -> because from (0, n-1): if the opposite row (1, n-1) is dirty, we can clean it? but then we are at (1, n-1). Then we are done? \n                Similarly, dp[n-1][1] = G[0][n-1]\n\n            Then for i from n-2 down to 0:\n\n                Option 1: \n                    We move in the same row to the next column: then we clean G[j][i+1] and then we are at (j, i+1). Then we get dp[i+1][j]. So total = G[j][i+1] (which is 1 if dirty, 0 if not) + dp[i+1][j].\n\n                Option 2: \n                    If the opposite row at the same column (G[1-j][i]) is dirty, then we can clean that. But then we are at (1-j, i). Then what? \n\n                    Now, from (1-j, i), the next moves: \n                        The closest dirty cells: \n                            - (1-j, i+1): distance = 1\n                            - (j, i+1): distance = 1? \n                        If both are dirty, then we have two at distance 1 -> malfunction. So we must clean one of them? \n\n                    The recurrence in the code:\n\n                        if G[j][i+1] is dirty: \n                            Then we cannot leave both (1-j, i+1) and (j, i+1) because they are at the same distance. So we must clean (j, i+1) and then we can clean (1-j, i+1) and then move to (1-j, i+1). Then from (1-j, i+1), we can clean (1-j, i+2) if present? and then continue from (1-j, i+2). \n\n                            So the total for this path: \n                                1 (for cleaning (1-j, i)) \n                                + G[1-j][i+1]   (if (1-j, i+1) is dirty, we clean it? but we are forced to clean it? Actually, we are forced to clean it because we are going to use it as the next step? and then we get that value? \n                                + G[1-j][i+2]   -> why? Actually, after cleaning (1-j, i+1), we are at (1-j, i+1). Then the next step: we must clean the next in the same row? But what if there is a dirty cell at (1-j, i+2)? Then we clean it? But then we are at (1-j, i+2). Then we can continue with dp[i+2][1-j]? \n\n                            However, note: we are not forced to clean (1-j, i+2) immediately? We could clean (1-j, i+1) and then the next step could be to the other row? \n\n                    This recurrence is from a known solution for a similar problem. \n\n                    Actually, the known solution for \"Robot Cleaner\" in a 2xN grid uses:\n\n                      dp[i][0] = max( dp[i+1][0] + a[1][i], \n                                      1 + a[1][i] + a[1][i+1] + dp[i+2][1]   # if we clean the opposite row at i and then the opposite row at i+1 and then jump to i+2 in the opposite row? \n                                      ... )\n\n                    But wait, the recurrence in the if branch is:\n\n                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n\n                    This forces a pattern: clean (1-j,i), then (1-j,i+1), then (1-j,i+2) and then continue from (1-j, i+2). But what about the row j at i+1 and i+2? We must clean them? \n\n                    Actually, we are allowed to clean arbitrarily before launching the robot. The recurrence is trying to capture a pattern: we clean the opposite row at i, and then we clean the entire segment of the opposite row from i+1 to the end? But then we skip the row j from i+1 to the end? \n\n                    Alternatively, we might clean the opposite row at i, and then we clean the entire opposite row? Then we are left with the row j from i to the end? Then we can do a horizontal move in row j? \n\n                    But note: after cleaning the opposite row at i, we are at (1-j, i). Then we can only clean the opposite row? because if we leave the row j dirty at i+1, then from (1-j, i) we have two: (1-j, i+1) and (j, i+1) at the same distance? \n\n                    Therefore, we must clean both rows at i+1? \n\n                    How about: \n                      Clean (1-j, i) -> then we are at (1-j, i). Then we clean (1-j, i+1) and (j, i+1) in one step? But the robot only cleans one at a time. \n\n                    The robot moves one cell at a time. So after cleaning (1-j, i), the robot is at (1-j, i). Then the next step: the closest dirty cells: \n                         (1-j, i+1) and (j, i+1) are both at distance 1 -> malfunction.\n\n                    Therefore, we must clean one of them arbitrarily? But we are not allowed to clean after launching? \n\n                    The problem: \"before launching the robot, you can clean some (possibly zero) of the dirty cells yourself\". So we can clean (j, i+1) arbitrarily? Then the robot will clean (1-j, i+1) next? \n\n                    Then the state: \n                         We cleaned (1-j, i) arbitrarily? -> no, we cleaned it arbitrarily? Actually, we are allowed to clean arbitrarily before launching. So we can clean (1-j, i) and (j, i+1) arbitrarily? Then we leave (1-j, i+1) and the rest? \n\n                    Then the robot starts at (j,i) and we have cleaned (1-j, i) and (j, i+1). Then the only dirty cell in the vicinity is (1-j, i+1). Then the robot: \n                         (j,i) -> (1-j, i+1) [distance= |j - (1-j)| + |i - (i+1)| = 1+1=2] \n                         Then from (1-j, i+1): the next dirty cell? \n\n                    But note: we haven't cleaned (1-j, i+1) arbitrarily, so the robot cleans it. Then we are at (1-j, i+1). Then we can continue with the rest? \n\n                    How many cells did we clean arbitrarily? two: (1-j, i) and (j, i+1). Then the robot cleans (1-j, i+1). \n\n                    Then the total dirty cells left for the robot: 1.\n\n                    But we could have cleaned only one arbitrarily: clean (j, i+1) arbitrarily. Then leave (1-j, i) and (1-j, i+1) and the rest. Then the robot:\n                         (j,i) -> (1-j, i) [distance=1] -> cleans (1-j, i) -> then at (1-j, i): the next dirty cells: \n                             (1-j, i+1): distance=1\n                             (j, i+1): cleaned arbitrarily -> not there.\n                         Then the robot cleans (1-j, i+1) -> then at (1-j, i+1): then next? \n\n                    This seems to work. \n\n                    Therefore, the recurrence for the else branch (when G[j][i+1] is not dirty) is:\n\n                         We clean arbitrarily: only (j, i+1) is not dirty? Actually, we don't need to clean it because it's already clean. Then we can clean the opposite row at i (G[1-j][i]) arbitrarily? -> no, we are not forced to clean it arbitrarily? \n\n                    Actually, the condition: if G[1-j][i] is dirty -> then we consider cleaning it arbitrarily? But then we leave the rest? \n\n                    However, the recurrence is for the state after cleaning arbitrarily? \n\n                    The known solution for this problem (from codeforces) uses:\n\n                      dp[i][0] = max( a[0][i+1] + dp[i+1][0], \n                                      (a[1][i]? and then ...) )\n\n                    After reading a known solution (from a similar problem), we find:\n\n                      for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                          dp[0][i] = max( a[1][i] + dp[1][i+1], \n                                          a[1][i] + a[1][i+1] + a[0][i+1] + dp[0][i+2] )\n\n                    But that doesn't match.\n\n                    Alternatively, the intended recurrence for the else branch:\n\n                      We are at (j,i). We clean the opposite row at i (G[1-j][i]) arbitrarily? -> then we leave the rest? Then the robot will clean the next in the same row? \n\n                      But then the next in the same row is at i+1: G[j][i+1] (which is clean in this branch) -> then we move to i+1? \n\n                      So the total: 1 (for cleaning the opposite row arbitrarily) + dp[i+1][j]   [because then the robot will start at (j,i) and then move to (j,i+1) and then ...] \n\n                      But wait, we cleaned the opposite row at i arbitrarily, so the robot doesn't clean it. Then the robot starts at (j,i) and the next move: \n                         The closest dirty cell: \n                             (j, i+1): if dirty -> then distance=1 -> but we are in the else branch: G[j][i+1] is clean -> then the next might be (j, i+2) at distance 2, or (1-j, i+1) at distance 1? \n\n                      But we haven't cleaned (1-j, i+1) arbitrarily? so it might be dirty. Then the closest is (1-j, i+1) at distance 1. Then the robot cleans (1-j, i+1) and then we are at (1-j, i+1). Then we can continue with dp[i+1][1-j]? \n\n                      But note: we cleaned arbitrarily only (1-j, i) -> so (1-j, i+1) is still dirty. \n\n                      Therefore, the path: \n                         (j,i) -> (1-j, i+1) [cleans it] -> then at (1-j, i+1), we have the state dp[i+1][1-j]? \n\n                      How many cells did we clean arbitrarily? one: (1-j, i). How many cells did the robot clean? one: (1-j, i+1). Then the rest is dp[i+1][1-j]? \n\n                      But the state dp[i+1][1-j] includes the cleaning starting from (1-j, i+1). \n\n                      So the total = 1 (arbitrarily cleaned) + (1 if G[1-j][i+1] is dirty? but it might be clean? -> no, we don't know) + dp[i+1][1-j]? \n\n                      But wait, the state dp[i+1][1-j] already accounts for the dirty cells from i+1 onward. And we are cleaning (1-j, i+1) in the robot's path? \n\n                      Actually, the state dp[i+1][1-j] is defined as the maximum number of dirty cells left (and cleaned by the robot) starting from (1-j, i+1). But we have already cleaned (1-j, i+1) in the robot's path? \n\n                      This is not matching.\n\n                    Another idea: the recurrence in the else branch should be:\n\n                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\n                    Explanation: \n                      We clean the opposite row at i arbitrarily (count=1) and then the robot will move to (1-j, i+1) if it is dirty? but wait, the robot is at (j,i) and after we cleaned (1-j,i) arbitrarily, the next closest might be (1-j, i+1) (if dirty) or (j, i+1) (but clean) or (j, i+2) or (1-j, i+2). \n\n                    But note: the else branch: G[j][i+1] is clean. Then the closest dirty cell might be (1-j, i+1) at distance 1? if it is dirty. But what if it is clean? then the next might be further. \n\n                    However, the state dp[i+1][1-j] is defined for the grid from column i+1 onward, and it assumes that the robot starts at (1-j, i+1). But if (1-j, i+1) is clean, then the state dp[i+1][1-j] might be 0? \n\n                    But we are allowed to clean arbitrarily only (1-j, i). The cell (1-j, i+1) might be dirty or not? \n\n                    The recurrence should work regardless. \n\n                    How about: \n                         total = 1 (for cleaning (1-j, i)) \n                                 + (the maximum dirty cells the robot can clean starting from (j,i) in the grid that has been modified by our cleaning? but note: we cleaned (1-j,i) arbitrarily, and the rest remains. The robot will then clean (1-j, i+1) if it is dirty? but then we are at (1-j, i+1) and then we get dp[i+1][1-j]? \n\n                    But the state dp[i+1][1-j] is computed for the original grid? \n\n                    Actually, the dp state is computed for the original grid. We are not allowed to change the grid arbitrarily in the middle of the dp? \n\n                    This is a design of the dp: we are simulating what we clean arbitrarily and then the robot cleans the rest. The dp state should account for the entire grid from column i onward, and we are allowed to clean arbitrarily only in the columns >= i? \n\n                    But note: we are traversing backwards. The dp[i][j] is computed after dp[i+1][*] and dp[i+2][*] are computed. And the grid is fixed.\n\n                    The recurrence must account for the fact that we are cleaning (1-j, i) arbitrarily, and then the robot will start at (j,i) and clean the rest without malfunction. The rest includes columns i onward, but with (1-j, i) cleaned.\n\n                    How to compute the rest? \n\n                    The known solution for a codeforces problem \"D. Robot Cleaner\" in a 2xN grid (problem link: not provided) uses:\n\n                      dp[i][0] = a[1][i] + max(dp[i+1][0], (a[0][i+1] + a[1][i+1] + dp[i+2][1]) )\n                      dp[i][1] = a[0][i] + max(dp[i+1][1], (a[0][i+1] + a[1][i+1] + dp[i+2][0]) )\n\n                    But that is for a different problem.\n\n                    Given the complexity, and the fact that the provided recurrence in the if branch is:\n\n                      if G[1-j][i]:\n                         if G[j][i+1]:\n                             dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n                         else:\n                             # TODO\n\n                    In the else branch, we don't have the obstacle of G[j][i+1] being dirty. So we can simply move to the opposite row at i+1? \n\n                    The else branch recurrence might be:\n\n                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\n                    But then we are not accounting for the dirty cell at (1-j, i+1)? \n\n                    Alternatively, we might clean (1-j, i) arbitrarily, and then the robot will clean (1-j, i+1) if present? and then continue. But then the total would be:\n\n                      1 (arbitrary cleaning) + (G[1-j][i+1] if dirty? but we don't know) + dp[i+1][1-j] \n\n                    But the state dp[i+1][1-j] already includes the value of G[1-j][i+1]? \n\n                    Actually, the state dp[i+1][1-j] is defined as the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left (and cleaned by the robot) from (1-j, i+1) onward. This state is computed for the original grid. However, we have cleaned (1-j, i) arbitrarily, but that cell is at column i, not i+1. The cell (1-j, i+1) is at column i+1, and it is not cleaned arbitrarily. So the state dp[i+1][1-j] is valid.\n\n                    Therefore, the recurrence for the else branch is:\n\n                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\n                    But note: the 1 is for cleaning (1-j, i) arbitrarily. Then the robot will start at (j,i) and then move to (1-j, i+1) (if dirty) and then clean the rest? \n\n                    However, the state dp[i+1][1-j] includes the cleaning of the robot from (1-j, i+1) onward. But the cell (1-j, i+1) might be clean in the grid? then dp[i+1][1-j] might be 0, and we would have cleaned one cell arbitrarily and the robot cleans nothing? \n\n                    But if (1-j, i+1) is clean, then from (j,i) the next move might be further away. And there might be a dirty cell at (j, i+2) or (1-j, i+2). The state dp[i+1][1-j] is computed for the grid from i+1 onward, and it might include those. \n\n                    However, the robot might clean (1-j, i+1) only if it is dirty. But if it is clean, the robot will skip it? \n\n                    The state dp[i+1][1-j] is defined as the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left (and cleaned by the robot) in the grid from column i+1 onward, with the robot starting at (1-j, i+1). If the cell (1-j, i+1) is clean, then the state should be computed as if the robot starts at (1-j, i+1) and there are no dirty cells at (1-j, i+1) -> then the robot will move to the next dirty cell? \n\n                    But the dp state is computed for the entire grid from i+1 onward, and it already takes into account the grid values. \n\n                    Therefore, the recurrence for the else branch is:\n\n                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\n                    But note: the if branch also has an extra term: G[1-j][i+1] and G[1-j][i+2]. Why? \n\n                    In the if branch, we are not cleaning arbitrarily the cell (j, i+1)? We are forced to clean it because otherwise the robot will malfunction. So we clean (j, i+1) arbitrarily? Then we are at (j,i) and then we clean (1-j, i) arbitrarily? -> wait, no: the if branch is inside the condition that we are cleaning (1-j, i) arbitrarily? \n\n                    Actually, the recurrence in the if branch might be cleaning two cells arbitrarily: (1-j, i) and (j, i+1)? then the robot will clean (1-j, i+1) and (1-j, i+2) and then continue? \n\n                    But the expression: 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j]\n\n                    Here, 1 is for (1-j, i) cleaned arbitrarily.\n                    G[1-j][i+1] and G[1-j][i+2] are the grid values at those positions: if they are dirty, then the robot will clean them? and then we continue from (1-j, i+2) with the state dp[i+2][1-j]? \n\n                    This means we are not cleaning (j, i+1) arbitrarily? then why doesn't the robot malfunction when it sees (j, i+1) and (1-j, i+1) at the same distance? \n\n                    The only explanation is that in the if branch, we are not cleaning (1-j, i) arbitrarily, but rather we are not cleaning it and the robot will clean it? \n\n                    This is very confusing.\n\n                    Given the time, and since the problem is known, I will output the known solution for the else branch: 1 + dp[i+1][1-j]\n\n                    But note: the base case: the grid has been extended by one column of zeros at the end. So when we access G[1-j][i+2] in the if branch, it is safe because we have appended [0] to each row.\n\n                    Therefore, for the else branch in program3.py, the missing line is:\n\n                      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\n                    However, let me check with the example of n=2, grid:\n                         row0: [0,0]   -> because we appended 0, so it becomes [0,0,0]? but we only have n=2, so the grid is 2x3? \n                         row1: [1,0] -> becomes [1,0,0]\n\n                    State: i=0, j=0 (starting at (0,0)).\n                    dp[0][0] = ?\n\n                    Base case: i = n-1 = 1 (0-indexed last column is index1, because n=2).\n                         dp[1][0] = G[1][1] = 0\n                         dp[1][1] = G[0][1] = 0\n\n                    Then for i=0, j=0:\n                         Option1: dp[0][0] = G[0][1] + dp[1][0] = 0 + 0 = 0.\n                         Then, since G[1-0][0] = G[1][0] = 1 (dirty) -> we enter the if.\n                         But then we check G[0][1] (which is the same row next column) = 0 -> so we go to else.\n                         Then: dp[0][0] = max(0, 1 + dp[1][1]) = max(0, 1+0)=1.\n\n                    Then the answer is 1.\n\n                    But the example: \n                         We have two rows, two columns: \n                             (0,0): clean, (0,1): clean.\n                             (1,0): dirty, (1,1): clean.\n                         We can clean (1,0) arbitrarily -> then we leave 0 dirty cells? or we can leave it and the robot will clean it? \n\n                    The robot starts at (0,0). The only dirty cell is (1,0) at distance 1. Then the robot cleans it -> no malfunction. So we can leave 1 dirty cell? \n\n                    Therefore, the answer should be 1.\n\n                    So the recurrence works.\n\n                    Therefore, the missing line for program3.py in the else branch is:\n                        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nSummary:\n\n  program1.py: \n        left[a+b] += nums[a][b]\n        right[a + B - 1 - b] += nums[a][b]\n\n  program2.py:\n        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n  program3.py:\n        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: in program3.py, the grid has been extended by one column (with zeros) so that we can safely access i+2 even at i = n-2.\n\nNow, output in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"left[a+b] += nums[a][b]\\nright[a + B - 1 - b] += nums[a][b]\",\n  \"program2\": \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j - i]) % d\",\n  \"program3\": \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\"\n}\n\nHowever, note the code in program1.py: the inner loop is:\n\n    for a in range(A):\n        for b in range(B):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must fill two lines.\n\nBut the code in program2.py: the inner loop is:\n\n    for i in p:\n        for j in R(i,m):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must fill one line.\n\nIn program3.py: the else branch is:\n\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must fill one line.\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the two lines must be indented appropriately. We output the two lines as a string.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and \"NOT as markdown code\". So we output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\nBut note: the TODO in program1.py is in a double loop. We output two lines of code that should be inside the double loop.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut the JSON string must escape newlines? Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", and we are to put it in a JSON string. We use \\n for newline.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines for program1.py as two separate lines in the string.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact formatting of the string. We use \\n for line breaks.\n\nLet me write:\n\n  program1: \"left[a+b] += nums[a][b]\\nright[a + B - 1 - b] += nums[a][b]\"\n\nBut note: the variable names: A and B are the dimensions, and the grid is `nums`. The variables in the loop are `a` and `b`.\n\nIn program2: the line is \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j - i]) % d\"\n\nIn program3: the line is \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\"\n\nBut note: in program3, the line is inside the else branch and after an if. We output only the one line.\n\nHowever, in program3, the line might be:\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: the if branch has an if and an else. The else branch is for when G[j][i+1] is 0 (false). \n\nWe output the exact line that replaces the TODO.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON object is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"left[a+b] += nums[a][b]\\nright[a + B - 1 - b] += nums[a][b]\",\n  \"program2\": \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j - i]) % d\",\n  \"program3\": \"dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program1, the two lines are two separate statements. We write them as two lines.\n\nIn program2, the line is one statement.\n\nIn program3, the line is one statement.\n\nHowever, in program3, the line is:\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut note: the if branch has:\n\n                if G[j][i+1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1-j][i+1] + G[1-j][i+2] + dp[i+2][1-j])\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j])\n\nBut the code in the else branch might be written as above.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output only the missing code. So for program3, we output the line that goes in the else branch.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". In program3, the TODO is in the else branch, so we output the one line.\n\nBut what if we need to write multiple lines? The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". In this case, one line.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
