However, the loop has a condition for even but the odd part is incomplete. The TODO in program1.py is in the loop that counts odd and even trees. Currently, for even it increments `even`, but for odd we have a comment and a TODO. We should complete the odd part: if the tree height is odd, we should increment `odd`.

The existing code:\n- Reads the test cases.\n- For each test case, it sets `half_perimeter = w + l - 2` and initializes a set `solutions` with {1,2}.\n- Then it iterates from 2 to the floor of the square root of `half_perimeter`.\n- For each divisor `i` of `half_perimeter`, it considers `a` as `i` and `div` (which is `half_perimeter // i`).\n- Then it checks the condition: `mod_a = w % a` and if `mod_a <= 2`, then there is a TODO. We need to complete the condition for adding `a` as a solution. The problem states that the boundary is tiled with 1xa tiles (which can be rotated). The boundary consists of the four sides. However, note that the corners are shared by two sides. The total boundary tiles (without the interior) would be: \n  total_boundary = 2*(w + l) - 4   (because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2w+2l, but then subtract the 4 corners that are overcounted? Actually, the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). The entire area is w*l, so the boundary tiles count is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4. But note the problem says: the interior uses (w-2)*(l-2) 1x1 tiles, and the boundary uses 1xa tiles. The boundary has 2*(w+l) - 4 squares? Actually, the boundary has:\n  top: w, bottom: w, left: l-2, right: l-2 -> total = 2*w + 2*(l-2) = 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4. So the total boundary area is 2*(w+l) - 4. This must be divisible by `a`. Therefore, `a` must be a divisor of 2*(w+l) - 4? Actually, the code uses `half_perimeter = w + l - 2`, so the total boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter. But note: the problem does not require the entire boundary to be covered by the same `a`? Actually, we are using tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated) meaning they can be placed as 1xa or ax1. And we are to cover the entire boundary. However, the problem states: \"For which values of a can Bethany tile the bathroom floor as described?\" meaning that we are allowed to use only one value of `a` for the entire boundary. The key is that the boundary is divided into four sides. Each side must be covered by 1xa tiles. The tiles can be rotated so they can be placed horizontally or vertically. Conditions for a valid `a`:\n1. The total boundary area (2*(w+l)-4) must be divisible by `a`.\n2. Additionally, the tiling must be possible without breaking the tiles.",

Actually, we can break the tile? No, we cannot break. This is confusing. After checking known solutions for similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) F), the solution is:\n\n   Let g = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n   Then the divisors of g are candidates. Then we check for each divisor a:\n\n        if (w % a == 0 || w % a == 1) and (l % a == 0 || l % a == 1) and ( (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1) )? Actually, no. The known solution in the code we are given only checks `w % a <= 2` and then does something. But note the example in the problem: w=3, l=5 -> solutions are 1,2,3. The total boundary = 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 12. The divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12. We need to check:\n\n   a=1: always works? a=2: \n        w=3 mod2=1 -> 1<=2 -> condition holds? But we also need to check l=5 mod2=1 -> 1<=2 -> condition holds? So we add 2. a=3:\n        w=3 mod3=0 -> condition holds. l=5 mod3=2 -> condition holds? So we add 3.\n   a=4: \n        w=3 mod4=3 -> 3>2 -> skip.\n   a=6: \n        w=3 mod6=3 -> skip. a=12: skip. So the set becomes {1,2,3}. But note the code already has {1,2} and then we add 3? But the code initializes with {1,2}. Then in the loop we add divisors that satisfy the condition? However, the code currently only checks `w % a <= 2`. But we must also check the other dimension? Looking at the problem: the boundary has two widths (w and l) and the tiles must cover the entire boundary. The condition for the other side is not checked? Actually, the condition for the other side is symmetric? The code does:\n\n   for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut we should also check the other side? The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to check both w and l. In fact, the solution in the known problem (F. Tiling) from Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) is:\n\n   Let g = 2*(w+l-2) Then for each divisor a of g (with a>=1) we check:\n\n        if (w % a == 0 || w % a == 1) && (l % a == 0 || l % a == 1) \n        OR \n        if (w % a == 0 || w % a == 2) && (l % a == 0) \n        OR ... Actually, there are two patterns: Pattern 1: The corners are covered by the horizontal sides. Then:\n   - The top and bottom sides must cover the entire width w. The left and right sides cover the inner part of the sides (length l-2). So:\n        top: w, bottom: w -> must be divisible by a?",

Actually, the known solution is to iterate over divisors and then check:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w-1) % a <= 1 ) and ...? But the provided code only checks `w % a <= 2`. Looking at the example: w=3, l=5, a=3: w % 3 = 0 -> <=2 -> condition holds. l % 3 = 2 -> <=2 -> condition holds. So we should check both? Therefore, the TODO should be: if also `l % a <= 2`, then add `a` to the solutions set. But note: the code currently only checks `w % a`. We must check both w and l. So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a) But wait: what about the possibility that the tile might be placed in a way that the remainder condition is satisfied for one dimension but not the other? The condition must be satisfied for both. However, note that the divisor `a` must divide the total boundary area (which is 2*(w+l-2)). The condition we are checking (remainders <=2) is necessary for the tiling to be possible? But why? The remainders condition comes from the fact that at the corners, we can have a tile that covers two sides? Actually, the problem is complex. But the known solution in the sample code (from the problem setter) for Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) F is:\n\n   for (int a : {i, half_perimeter / i}) {\n        if (a < 1) continue;\n        if (w % a <= 2 && l % a <= 2) {\n            s.insert(a);\n        } if ((w-1) % a == 0 && (l % a == 0 || (l-1) % a == 0 || (l-2) % a == 0)) {\n            s.insert(a);\n        }\n        ... But that is not the case. Actually, the known solution that passed in the contest is:\n\n   set<int> s;\n   long long perim = 2*(w+l-2);\n   for (long long i = 1; i*i <= perim; i++) { if (perim % i) continue;\n        for (long long a : {i, perim/i}) {\n            if (a > perim) continue;\n            if ( (w % a <= 2 && l % a <= 2) || \n                 ( (w-1) % a == 0 && (l % a == 0 || (l-1) % a == 0) ) ||\n                 ( (w-2) % a == 0 && (l % a == 0) ) ||\n                 ( (l-1) % a == 0 && (w % a == 0 || (w-1) % a == 0) ) ||\n                 ( (l-2) % a == 0 && (w % a == 0) ) ) {\n                s.insert(a);\n            }\n        }\n   } But that is complex and the problem says the total output integers are at most 200000, so we are iterating over divisors and then checking multiple conditions. However, the provided code in program2.py does not have these multiple conditions. It only has:\n\n   for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO So we must complete the condition. But note the problem statement says: \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200000 integers.\" meaning that the set of solutions is not too large. But the provided code only checks one condition. How did the sample test case (3,5) work? In the sample test case (3,5): \n   half_perimeter = 3+5-2 = 6 -> total boundary = 12, so divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12. For a=1: \n   w % 1 = 0 -> condition holds -> then we check l % 1 = 0 -> holds -> add 1. For a=2: \n   w % 2 = 1 -> condition holds -> then check l % 2 = 1 -> holds -> add 2. For a=3: \n   w % 3 = 0 -> condition holds -> then check l % 3 = 2 -> holds (because 2<=2) -> add 3. For a=4: \n   w % 4 = 3 -> condition fails. For a=6: \n   w % 6 = 3 -> fails. For a=12: \n   w % 12 = 3 -> fails. So we get {1,2,3}. But the code already had {1,2} initially? Wait, the code initializes:\n\n   solutions = {1, 2}\n\nThen we iterate from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) (which is floor(sqrt(6)) -> 2). Then i=2: \n   perim = 12, so 12 % 2 == 0 -> div = 12//2 = 6. Then for a in [2,6]:\n        a=2: mod_a = w % 2 = 3 % 2 = 1 -> condition holds -> then check l % 2 = 5 % 2 = 1 -> holds -> add 2? But 2 is already in the set.\n        a=6: mod_a = 3 % 6 = 3 -> condition fails. Then i=3: not in the loop because floor(sqrt(6)) is 2. But we missed a=3? Actually, the divisors we are iterating are the divisors of `half_perimeter`? But note: the total boundary is 2*(w+l-2) = 12, and we are using `half_perimeter = w+l-2 = 6`. Then we are iterating over divisors of 6? But the divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3,6. However, the code does:\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):   # half_perimeter=6 -> sqrt(6)~2.4 -> floor=2 -> range(2,3) -> i=2. So we only get i=2. Then we consider a=2 and a=6 (which is 6//2=3? no: 6//2=3? but wait: div = half_perimeter // i = 6//2=3). So for i=2, we get a in [2,3]. Then for a=3: \n   mod_a = w % 3 = 3 % 3 = 0 -> condition holds -> then check l % 3 = 5 % 3 = 2 -> holds -> add 3. So we get 3 added. But what about a=1? We already have 1 in the set initially. And a=2 is also initially in the set? Actually, the set is initialized with {1,2}. Then we add 3. So we have {1,2,3}. But why do we have 2 initially? The problem says a can be 1 and 2. But what about a=4? It is a divisor of 12 but not of 6? Wait: the total boundary is 12, but we are using `half_perimeter = 6` and then we are iterating the divisors of 6? That is not the same as the divisors of 12. This is a problem. The total boundary area is 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. So the divisors of the total boundary are the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter. But the code only considers divisors of half_perimeter? We must consider divisors of 2 * half_perimeter? But note: the problem says the total boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. So we should be iterating over divisors of (2 * half_perimeter). But the code uses:\n\n   half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))",

But that is not true: the divisors of 2*half_perimeter are the divisors of half_perimeter and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2, but also divisors that are divisors of 2 and not of half_perimeter? Actually, the divisors of 2*half_perimeter are:\n\n   { d, 2*d : for d dividing half_perimeter }  if half_perimeter is even? and if half_perimeter is odd, then the divisors are { d, 2*d : for d dividing half_perimeter } and also the divisors that are 2 times a divisor of half_perimeter?

Given the complexity and the fact that the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, and the sample test cases work with the current divisor iteration (over half_perimeter), we will complete the TODO by checking both w and l mod a.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a) But note: the divisor `a` might be 1?

The problem says a>=1, and the divisor loop starts at 2, and then we consider a in [i, div] which are at least 2? But note: when half_perimeter=0? w+l-2=0 -> w=l=1? but w,l>=3. So no. Therefore, we complete program2.py with:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the code already has an initial set {1,2}. Why 2?

But what if w=3, l=3: \n   a=2: \n        w % 2 = 1 -> condition holds. l % 2 = 1 -> condition holds -> 2 is a solution. So the initial set {1,2} is safe.

But the problem says: a=1 is always a solution? and a=2 is also always a solution? Actually, the boundary area is 2*(w+l-2). This is even? So divisible by 2. And the remainders w%2 and l%2 are either 0 or 1, which are <=2. So a=2 is always a solution? But the problem says: \"For which values of a\". The example: w=3, l=5 -> a=1,2,3. So we are safe.

What is being computed? s: starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. ctr: an array of three counters, initially [0,0,0]. tot: initially 0. In the first iteration (s=0, i=0):\n        tot += 2*(0 - ctr[0]) = 2*(0-0)=0 -> tot=0.\n        cnt.append(0) -> so cnt[1]=0.\n        ctr[0] becomes 1.\n        s becomes 1. i becomes 1.

So the array `cnt` is the total triangles for k lines? The binary search function:\n\n   def solve(sn):\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        return str(s) We are doing a binary search for the smallest k such that cnt[k] >= t. The loop condition: while s < e.\n\nWe set m = (s+e)//2. If cnt[m] >= t, then we set e = m.\n\nOtherwise, we should set s = m+1? Because we are looking for the first index where cnt[k] >= t. So the TODO is: s = m+1. But note: the initial s=0, e=len(cnt)-1.\n\nExample: t=1. We know that k=0:0, k=1:0, k=2:2 -> so the answer should be 2. Initially: s=0, e=5 (if we have at least 6 elements? we have cnt[0..5] = [0,0,2,6,10,16]? but note: the precomputation: \n        cnt[0]=0 (from the initial)\n        then we appended: \n            s=0: cnt[1]=0\n            s=1: cnt[2]=2\n            s=2: cnt[3]=6\n            s=3: cnt[4]=10\n            s=4: cnt[5]=16\n        and then we break when tot>=10**9. So the array `cnt` has indices 0..?. The binary search:\n\n        s=0, e=5. m = (0+5)//2 = 2 -> cnt[2]=2 >=1 -> then e=2. then s=0, e=2: m=1 -> cnt[1]=0 <1 -> then we set s = m+1 = 2.\n        then s=2, e=2 -> break -> return 2. That is correct. For t=3:\n        s=0, e=5 -> m=2: cnt[2]=2 <3 -> then s = 2+1=3.\n        then s=3, e=5: m=4: cnt[4]=10>=3 -> e=4. then s=3, e=4: m=3: cnt[3]=6>=3 -> e=3. then s=3, e=3 -> break -> return 3. But the expected answer for n=3 is 3? However, the problem says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines\" for n=3. But note: the problem says: \"In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed. ... In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines\"\n\n   The third test case: n=3 -> output 3. So the binary search is set to find the minimal k such that cnt[k]>=n. Therefore, the TODO is: s = m+1. But note: the variable names: \n   The binary search is set up to find the first index e in the range [0, len(cnt)-1] such that cnt[e]>=t? Actually, the loop:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\n   Then we return s. This is standard binary search for the first index >= t.\n\n   So the missing line is: s = m+1. Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n    s = m+1\n\nBut note: the code has:\n\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we write: s = m+1\n\nBut note: the code after the loop returns str(s). So we are returning the index s. And the index s corresponds to the number of lines? In the precomputation, we have:\n\n   cnt[0] = 0   -> 0 lines\n   cnt[1] = 0   -> 1 line\n   cnt[2] = 2   -> 2 lines\n   cnt[3] = 6   -> 3 lines So the index in the array `cnt` is the number of lines? Therefore, the binary search returns the number of lines. So the TODO is: s = m+1.\n\n### Summary\n\nWe have:\n\nprogram1.py: \n   The missing line: \"odd += 1\"\n\nprogram2.py:\n   The missing block: if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the code is indented. We are inside the for-loop and the if-statement. The existing code has:\n\n        if mod_i != 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here So we must write two lines with proper indentation. We write:\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a) But note: the variable `a` is defined, and `solutions` is the set. program3.py:\n   The missing line: \"s = m+1\"\n\nNow, we output in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"odd += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"            if l % a <= 2:\\n                solutions.add(a)\",\n  \"program3\": \"            s = m+1\"\n} But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and \"NOT as markdown code\". So we output the exact string. However, for program2.py, the existing code has 12 spaces of indentation for the for-loop and then 16 for the if. We must match the indentation. The existing code for the TODO part is at the same level as the comment. The comment is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO is at the same indentation level as the if. We are replacing the comment with two lines:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a) But the existing code already has the first if. So we are only adding two lines after the first if. But the existing code for the for-loop:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO comment with:\n\n                if l % a <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the existing if is already at an indentation of 16 (if the for-loop is at 12). So the two lines we add should be indented by 16 and 20 respectively. But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the existing code uses 4-space indents? We can write:\n\n   \"program2\": \"    if l % a <= 2:\\n        solutions.add(a)\"\n\nBut that would be 4 and 8? But the existing code:\n\n   for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO\n\nThe for-loop is indented by 8 (relative to the outer for) and the inner for is indented by 12? Actually, the code:\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i) if mod_i ! = 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at the same level as the inner for-loop body. We are going to replace the TODO comment with:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nSo the first line (the if) is at the same indentation as the previous if (which is 12 spaces from the outer for? or 16?). But the problem does not specify. However, we can count: The outer for: 4 spaces\n   The inner for: 8 spaces\n   The for-loop body: 12 spaces\n\nSo:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a   # 12 spaces\n            if mod_a <= 2:   # 12 spaces\n                ... # 16 spaces\n\nSo the TODO is at 16 spaces. Then we add:\n\n                if l % a <= 2:   # 16 spaces\n                    solutions.add(a)   # 20 spaces\n\nBut we can write:\n\n   \"program2\": \" if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"\n\nAlternatively, we can use the exact same indentation as the surrounding code. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO. Therefore, we output:\n\n   program1: \"odd += 1\"\n   program2: two lines: \" if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"\n   program3: \"            s = m+1\"\n\nBut note: in program3, the TODO is in the else block. The existing code:\n\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else block is at 12 spaces? We are replacing the TODO with \"s = m+1\", which should be at 16 spaces? But the existing code in the else block is at 12, and the TODO comment is at 16? Actually, the code: if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else block is at 8 spaces? The function solve is defined with 4-space indents? def solve(sn):\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here So the else is at 12 spaces (relative to the function) and the TODO comment is at 16.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem is about watering trees to make them the same height. We are to complete the code.\n\nThe existing code:\n- Reads the number of test cases.\n- For each test case, reads n and a list of tree heights.\n- Sorts the list and counts the number of trees with the maximum height (a = l.count(l[-1])).\n- Then it initializes odd and even to 0 and loops over the trees to count how many are odd and even. However, the loop has a condition for even but the odd part is incomplete.\n\nThe TODO in program1.py is in the loop that counts odd and even trees. Currently, for even it increments `even`, but for odd we have a comment and a TODO.\n\nWe should complete the odd part: if the tree height is odd, we should increment `odd`.\n\nSo the missing line for program1.py is:\n    odd += 1\n\nBut note: the code after that uses `odd` and `even` to set `p1` and `p2` based on whether the maximum height is even or odd.\n\nHowever, the rest of the code is provided and we are only to fill the TODO.\n\n### program2.py\nThe problem is about tiling a bathroom floor and finding the valid values of `a` (the tile length for the boundary) such that the tiling is possible.\n\nThe existing code:\n- Reads the test cases.\n- For each test case, it sets `half_perimeter = w + l - 2` and initializes a set `solutions` with {1,2}.\n- Then it iterates from 2 to the floor of the square root of `half_perimeter`.\n- For each divisor `i` of `half_perimeter`, it considers `a` as `i` and `div` (which is `half_perimeter // i`).\n- Then it checks the condition: `mod_a = w % a` and if `mod_a <= 2`, then there is a TODO.\n\nWe need to complete the condition for adding `a` as a solution.\n\nThe problem states that the boundary is tiled with 1xa tiles (which can be rotated). The boundary consists of the four sides. However, note that the corners are shared by two sides.\n\nThe total boundary tiles (without the interior) would be: \n  total_boundary = 2*(w + l) - 4   (because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2w+2l, but then subtract the 4 corners that are overcounted? Actually, the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). The entire area is w*l, so the boundary tiles count is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\nBut note the problem says: the interior uses (w-2)*(l-2) 1x1 tiles, and the boundary uses 1xa tiles. The boundary has 2*(w+l) - 4 squares? Actually, the boundary has:\n  top: w, bottom: w, left: l-2, right: l-2 -> total = 2*w + 2*(l-2) = 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\nSo the total boundary area is 2*(w+l) - 4. This must be divisible by `a`. Therefore, `a` must be a divisor of 2*(w+l) - 4? Actually, the code uses `half_perimeter = w + l - 2`, so the total boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire boundary to be covered by the same `a`? Actually, we are using tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated) meaning they can be placed as 1xa or ax1. And we are to cover the entire boundary.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"For which values of a can Bethany tile the bathroom floor as described?\" meaning that we are allowed to use only one value of `a` for the entire boundary.\n\nThe key is that the boundary is divided into four sides. Each side must be covered by 1xa tiles. The tiles can be rotated so they can be placed horizontally or vertically.\n\nConditions for a valid `a`:\n1. The total boundary area (2*(w+l)-4) must be divisible by `a`.\n2. Additionally, the tiling must be possible without breaking the tiles. This requires that each side of the boundary must be covered by tiles of length that are multiples of `a` (if placed horizontally) or by tiles of height 1 and width `a` (if placed vertically) but note that the sides have fixed lengths.\n\nActually, we have four sides: \n  top: length w\n  bottom: length w\n  left: length l\n  right: length l\n\nBut note: the corners are shared. The problem is that the tiles at the corners must be shared by two sides. So we have to consider the possibility of covering the four sides with tiles that can be rotated.\n\nWe can break the boundary into four segments (without the corners? but the corners are part of two segments). Actually, the entire boundary is a cycle. However, the problem is known to have the following conditions:\n\nWe can consider the following:\n\nOption 1: The entire boundary is covered by tiles of length a. The boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l)-4. So condition: a must divide 2*(w+l)-4.\n\nBut that alone is not sufficient. We must also be able to assign the tiles to the four sides without conflict at the corners.\n\nThere are known necessary conditions:\n\n- The top side (length w) must be covered: we can use tiles of length a. The top side must be covered by tiles that are placed horizontally. The top side has two corners (top-left and top-right) that are shared with the left and right sides. The tiles at the corners must be such that they can cover the corner. \n\nActually, the problem has been studied and known solutions are:\n\nThe valid `a` are the divisors of 2*(w+l)-4 that also satisfy one of the following:\n\nCondition A: The top side (length w) can be covered if we have a tile that starts at the top-left corner and goes along the top. The top side must have a length w that is divisible by a? But note: we can break the top side into multiple tiles. However, the corner tiles must be shared. Actually, the condition is that the remainder when dividing the side lengths by a must be 0 or 1 or 2? \n\nThe provided code checks:\n   mod_a = w % a\n   if mod_a <= 2: ... then we do something.\n\nBut what about the other sides? \n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from similar problems on Codeforces) is to check:\n\nWe have four segments (without the corners?): \n   top: w - 2 (if we leave the corners for the adjacent sides) OR we can also assign the corners to the top? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the boundary into four segments that include the corners? \n\nActually, the known solution is to consider the following four cases:\n\nCase 1: The entire boundary is covered by tiles without any constraint on the corners? \n\nBut note the known solution in the code already includes 1 and 2. Then it iterates over divisors and for each divisor `a` it checks:\n\n   if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w % a == 0) or (w % a == 1) or (w % a == 2) ) and similarly for l, but actually the condition in the code only checks `w % a <= 2`. \n\nHowever, we must also check the other side? \n\nLooking at the provided code, it only checks `w % a`. But we have two dimensions. The known solution for this problem (e.g., from Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) problem F) is:\n\n   Let total = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n   Then the valid a are the divisors of total that satisfy:\n        (w % a == 0 || w % a == 1 || l % a == 0 || l % a == 1) \n   but actually we have to check the four sides.\n\nActually, we have to check that:\n\n   The top side (length w) must be covered: the top side has two corners. The part of the top side that is not covered by the corner tiles? \n\nAlternatively, we can think of the boundary as four segments:\n\n   Segment 1: from (0,0) to (w,0) [bottom] -> length w\n   Segment 2: from (w,0) to (w,l) [right] -> length l\n   Segment 3: from (w,l) to (0,l) [top] -> length w\n   Segment 4: from (0,l) to (0,0) [left] -> length l\n\nBut the corners are shared. The problem is that the corner tile must be placed such that it covers the corner. So the corner tile must be placed in two directions? Actually, no: each tile is either horizontal or vertical.\n\nThe known solution (from Codeforces) for this problem is:\n\n   Let g = 2*(w+l-2)\n   Then the divisors of g are candidates. Then for each divisor a, we check:\n\n        if ( (w % a == 0 || w % a == 1) && (l % a == 0 || l % a == 1) ) \n        OR ... actually there are two ways to assign the corners.\n\nActually, there are two ways to assign the corners:\n\n   Method 1: Assign the two corners of the top side to the top. Then the top side uses tiles that cover the entire top including the corners? -> no, because the corners are shared.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider:\n\n   The boundary can be covered if:\n\n        Option 1: The top and bottom sides are covered by horizontal tiles, and the left and right by vertical tiles. Then:\n            - The top and bottom must have length w. The tiles on the top and bottom must be placed horizontally. The left and right must have length l-2 (because the corners are already covered by the top and bottom). But wait, the top and bottom cover the entire width? Then the left and right are from y=1 to y=l-1? Then the length of the left and right is l-2. So the condition is:\n                a must divide w (for top and bottom) and a must divide (l-2) (for left and right). \n            But note: the tiles can be rotated? Actually, the tiles are 1xa and can be rotated so they can be placed as 1xa or ax1. However, the boundary is 1 unit wide. So the tiles must be placed with the 1 unit in the direction perpendicular to the boundary. Therefore, for the top and bottom we use the tile as a horizontal tile (so the tile is 1xa and we place it horizontally) and for the left and right we use it as a vertical tile? But then the tile would be ax1? Actually, no: if we rotate the tile, then for the vertical sides we would use the tile as a 1xa tile placed vertically? That doesn't work because the width of the boundary is 1. \n\n        Actually, the tile is 1xa. When placed horizontally, it covers a consecutive segment of 1 row and a columns. When placed vertically, it covers a consecutive segment of a rows and 1 column.\n\n        So for the top and bottom (which are horizontal boundaries) we can use the tile as 1xa (so we place it horizontally) and for the left and right (vertical boundaries) we can use the tile as a x 1 (so we place it vertically) but then the tile would be covering a rows? However, the boundary is 1 unit wide. So for the vertical boundaries, we are covering 1 column and multiple rows. The tile when rotated becomes a x 1? But then it would be too tall? Actually, we can break the tile? No, we cannot break.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\nAfter checking known solutions for similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) F), the solution is:\n\n   Let g = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n   Then the divisors of g are candidates. Then we check for each divisor a:\n\n        if (w % a == 0 || w % a == 1) and (l % a == 0 || l % a == 1) and ( (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 1 and l % a == 1) )? \n\nActually, no. The known solution in the code we are given only checks `w % a <= 2` and then does something. But note the example in the problem: w=3, l=5 -> solutions are 1,2,3.\n\nThe total boundary = 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 12. The divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nWe need to check:\n\n   a=1: always works? \n   a=2: \n        w=3 mod2=1 -> 1<=2 -> condition holds? \n        But we also need to check l=5 mod2=1 -> 1<=2 -> condition holds? \n        So we add 2.\n   a=3:\n        w=3 mod3=0 -> condition holds.\n        l=5 mod3=2 -> condition holds? \n        So we add 3.\n   a=4: \n        w=3 mod4=3 -> 3>2 -> skip.\n   a=6: \n        w=3 mod6=3 -> skip.\n   a=12: skip.\n\nSo the set becomes {1,2,3}. But note the code already has {1,2} and then we add 3? \n\nBut the code initializes with {1,2}. Then in the loop we add divisors that satisfy the condition? \n\nHowever, the code currently only checks `w % a <= 2`. But we must also check the other dimension? \n\nLooking at the problem: the boundary has two widths (w and l) and the tiles must cover the entire boundary. The condition for the other side is not checked? \n\nActually, the condition for the other side is symmetric? The code does:\n\n   for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut we should also check the other side? \n\nThe known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to check both w and l. \n\nIn fact, the solution in the known problem (F. Tiling) from Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) is:\n\n   Let g = 2*(w+l-2)\n   Then for each divisor a of g (with a>=1) we check:\n\n        if (w % a == 0 || w % a == 1) && (l % a == 0 || l % a == 1) \n        OR \n        if (w % a == 0 || w % a == 2) && (l % a == 0) \n        OR ... \n\nActually, there are two patterns:\n\nPattern 1: The corners are covered by the horizontal sides. Then:\n   - The top and bottom sides must cover the entire width w. The left and right sides cover the inner part of the sides (length l-2). So:\n        top: w, bottom: w -> must be divisible by a? Actually, we can break the top and bottom into tiles. But the condition is that the top and bottom can be covered by tiles of length a? Then w must be divisible by a? \n        and the left and right: l-2 must be divisible by a? \n\nPattern 2: The corners are covered by the vertical sides. Then:\n        left and right: l, top and bottom: w-2 -> so l divisible by a and w-2 divisible by a.\n\nPattern 3: Two opposite corners are covered by the horizontal and the other two by the vertical? Actually, we can have:\n\n        top: w-1, bottom: w-1, left: l-1, right: l-1? \n        Then the total boundary = 2*(w-1) + 2*(l-1) = 2*(w+l-2) -> which is the same as g. \n        Then we require that a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)? \n\nPattern 4: Or we can have:\n        top: w-2, bottom: w-2, left: l, right: l -> then a must divide w-2 and l.\n\nBut note: the total boundary is fixed: 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2). \n\nActually, the known solution (from a known AC code for this problem) is:\n\n   solutions = set()\n   g = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n   for a in [1, 2, w-1, w-2, l-1, l-2, w, l, g] : # not exactly, but we can factorize the divisors?\n   Actually, the known solution is to iterate over divisors and then check:\n\n        if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a <= 2) and ( (w-1) % a <= 1 ) and ...? \n\nBut the provided code only checks `w % a <= 2`. \n\nLooking at the example: w=3, l=5, a=3: \n   w % 3 = 0 -> <=2 -> condition holds.\n   l % 3 = 2 -> <=2 -> condition holds.\n\nSo we should check both? \n\nTherefore, the TODO should be: if also `l % a <= 2`, then add `a` to the solutions set.\n\nBut note: the code currently only checks `w % a`. We must check both w and l.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the tile might be placed in a way that the remainder condition is satisfied for one dimension but not the other? The condition must be satisfied for both.\n\nHowever, note that the divisor `a` must divide the total boundary area (which is 2*(w+l-2)). The condition we are checking (remainders <=2) is necessary for the tiling to be possible? \n\nBut why? \n\nThe remainders condition comes from the fact that at the corners, we can have a tile that covers two sides? Actually, the problem is complex. \n\nBut the known solution in the sample code (from the problem setter) for Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) F is:\n\n   for (int a : {i, half_perimeter / i}) {\n        if (a < 1) continue;\n        if (w % a <= 2 && l % a <= 2) {\n            s.insert(a);\n        }\n        if ((w-1) % a == 0 && (l % a == 0 || (l-1) % a == 0 || (l-2) % a == 0)) {\n            s.insert(a);\n        }\n        ... \n\nBut that is not the case. Actually, the known solution that passed in the contest is:\n\n   set<int> s;\n   long long perim = 2*(w+l-2);\n   for (long long i = 1; i*i <= perim; i++) {\n        if (perim % i) continue;\n        for (long long a : {i, perim/i}) {\n            if (a > perim) continue;\n            if ( (w % a <= 2 && l % a <= 2) || \n                 ( (w-1) % a == 0 && (l % a == 0 || (l-1) % a == 0) ) ||\n                 ( (w-2) % a == 0 && (l % a == 0) ) ||\n                 ( (l-1) % a == 0 && (w % a == 0 || (w-1) % a == 0) ) ||\n                 ( (l-2) % a == 0 && (w % a == 0) ) ) {\n                s.insert(a);\n            }\n        }\n   }\n\nBut that is complex and the problem says the total output integers are at most 200000, so we are iterating over divisors and then checking multiple conditions.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program2.py does not have these multiple conditions. It only has:\n\n   for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO\n\nSo we must complete the condition. But note the problem statement says: \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200000 integers.\" meaning that the set of solutions is not too large.\n\nBut the provided code only checks one condition. How did the sample test case (3,5) work? \n\nIn the sample test case (3,5): \n   half_perimeter = 3+5-2 = 6 -> total boundary = 12, so divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nFor a=1: \n   w % 1 = 0 -> condition holds -> then we check l % 1 = 0 -> holds -> add 1.\n\nFor a=2: \n   w % 2 = 1 -> condition holds -> then check l % 2 = 1 -> holds -> add 2.\n\nFor a=3: \n   w % 3 = 0 -> condition holds -> then check l % 3 = 2 -> holds (because 2<=2) -> add 3.\n\nFor a=4: \n   w % 4 = 3 -> condition fails.\n\nFor a=6: \n   w % 6 = 3 -> fails.\n\nFor a=12: \n   w % 12 = 3 -> fails.\n\nSo we get {1,2,3}. But the code already had {1,2} initially? \n\nWait, the code initializes:\n\n   solutions = {1, 2}\n\nThen we iterate from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) (which is floor(sqrt(6)) -> 2). Then i=2: \n   perim = 12, so 12 % 2 == 0 -> div = 12//2 = 6.\n   Then for a in [2,6]:\n        a=2: mod_a = w % 2 = 3 % 2 = 1 -> condition holds -> then check l % 2 = 5 % 2 = 1 -> holds -> add 2? But 2 is already in the set.\n        a=6: mod_a = 3 % 6 = 3 -> condition fails.\n\nThen i=3: not in the loop because floor(sqrt(6)) is 2.\n\nBut we missed a=3? \n\nActually, the divisors we are iterating are the divisors of `half_perimeter`? But note: the total boundary is 2*(w+l-2) = 12, and we are using `half_perimeter = w+l-2 = 6`. Then we are iterating over divisors of 6? \n\nBut the divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3,6. However, the code does:\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):   # half_perimeter=6 -> sqrt(6)~2.4 -> floor=2 -> range(2,3) -> i=2.\n\nSo we only get i=2. Then we consider a=2 and a=6 (which is 6//2=3? no: 6//2=3? but wait: div = half_perimeter // i = 6//2=3). \n\nSo for i=2, we get a in [2,3]. \n\nThen for a=3: \n   mod_a = w % 3 = 3 % 3 = 0 -> condition holds -> then check l % 3 = 5 % 3 = 2 -> holds -> add 3.\n\nSo we get 3 added.\n\nBut what about a=1? We already have 1 in the set initially. And a=2 is also initially in the set? \n\nActually, the set is initialized with {1,2}. Then we add 3. So we have {1,2,3}. \n\nBut why do we have 2 initially? The problem says a can be 1 and 2. \n\nBut what about a=4? It is a divisor of 12 but not of 6? \n\nWait: the total boundary is 12, but we are using `half_perimeter = 6` and then we are iterating the divisors of 6? That is not the same as the divisors of 12. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nThe total boundary area is 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. So the divisors of the total boundary are the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter. \n\nBut the code only considers divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nWe must consider divisors of 2 * half_perimeter? \n\nBut note: the problem says the total boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. \n\nSo we should be iterating over divisors of (2 * half_perimeter). \n\nBut the code uses:\n\n   half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):   # iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut we are missing divisors that are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter? \n\nFor example, in the sample: half_perimeter=6, then 2 * half_perimeter=12. The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. So we are missing 4 and 12? \n\nBut the sample output is 1,2,3. So 4 and 12 are not solutions. \n\nBut what if we have a divisor that is a divisor of 12 but not of 6? For example, a=4: \n   We saw that 4 is not a divisor of 6? Then we skip. \n\nBut the condition for a=4: \n   We must check if 4 divides 12? It does. But the code does not consider it because we are iterating divisors of half_perimeter (6) only. \n\nSo the code is flawed? \n\nLooking at the known solution for the problem (from Codeforces) we see that they iterate over divisors of the total boundary (which is 2*(w+l-2)). \n\nTherefore, we should change the divisor iteration to be over the divisors of the total boundary? \n\nBut the problem says: the total boundary is 2*(w+l-2). \n\nThe provided code uses:\n\n   half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):   # iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut we are missing the factor 2. \n\nWe can fix by:\n\n   total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(total_boundary)) + 1):\n        if total_boundary % i != 0: continue\n        for a in [i, total_boundary // i]:\n            ... \n\nBut the provided code does not do that. It uses half_perimeter. \n\nAlternatively, note that the divisors of total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter are: \n   the divisors of half_perimeter and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2? \n\nBut we can get them by iterating over divisors of total_boundary. \n\nHowever, the problem says the total_boundary can be up to 2*(10^9+10^9-2) = 4e9, so the square root is about 63245, which is acceptable? \n\nBut the problem also says the total output integers are at most 200000, so the number of divisors per test case is not too high.\n\nBut the provided code uses half_perimeter and then iterates over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nWe are not allowed to change the existing code structure? Only fill the TODO.\n\nGiven the constraints, the intended solution might be to consider the divisors of half_perimeter and then also consider the divisors of total_boundary? \n\nBut the sample test case: half_perimeter=6, total_boundary=12. The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. \n\nThe code initializes solutions with {1,2}. Then it iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2. Then it gets divisors 2 and 3 (from 6//2=3). Then we check a=2 and a=3. \n\nBut we miss 4,6,12? \n\nBut 4: \n   w=3 mod4=3 -> fails.\n   w=3 mod6=3 -> fails.\n   w=3 mod12=3 -> fails.\n\nSo they are not added. \n\nBut what if we have a divisor that is a divisor of total_boundary but not of half_perimeter? For example, if half_perimeter=3, then total_boundary=6. The divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6. The divisors of half_perimeter=3: 1,3. Then we would miss 2 and 6? \n\nBut 2: \n   We have 2 in the initial set? \n\nThe code initializes with {1,2}. So 2 is already there. \n\nWhat about 6? \n   Then we would get 6 from the divisor iteration? \n   But half_perimeter=3, then we iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(3)) -> 1 -> so the loop doesn't run? \n\nThen we don't get 6? \n\nBut 6: \n   w mod6 = w % 6 -> if w=3, then 3%6=3 -> fails.\n\nSo it wouldn't be added. \n\nBut what if we have a divisor that is a divisor of total_boundary and not of half_perimeter and it is a solution? \n\nFor example, w=5, l=5: \n   half_perimeter = 5+5-2 = 8, total_boundary=16.\n   Divisors of 16: 1,2,4,8,16.\n   Divisors of half_perimeter=8: 1,2,4,8.\n\n   Now, what about a=16? \n        w=5 mod16=5 -> fails.\n\n   a=8: \n        w=5 mod8=5 -> fails.\n\n   a=4: \n        w=5 mod4=1 -> condition holds? \n        l=5 mod4=1 -> condition holds -> add 4.\n\n   a=2: already in the set.\n\n   a=1: in the set.\n\n   So we get {1,2,4}. \n\nBut what if we have a divisor that is 16? It is not in the divisors of 8? Then we would miss it? But 16 fails anyway.\n\nBut what if we have a divisor that is 16 and it passes? \n\nExample: w=17, l=1 -> but w>=3, l>=3. \n\nSo it might be safe? \n\nBut note: the divisor must divide total_boundary = 2*(w+l-2). And if a divides total_boundary, then a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). \n\nBut the code uses half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut note: the divisors of total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter are:\n\n   all divisors of half_perimeter and all divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2? \n\nBut not exactly: the divisors of 2*half_perimeter include the divisors of half_perimeter and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2, but also divisors that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nFor example, if half_perimeter=6, then total_boundary=12. The divisors of 12 that are not divisors of 6 are 4 and 12. \n\nBut 4: 4 does not divide 6? \n\nSo we are missing divisors that divide 12 but not 6? \n\nBut note: if a divides 12 and not 6, then a must be even? and 12/a must be odd? \n\nBut 12: 12/4=3 -> odd. \n\nBut we can get these divisors by iterating over divisors of total_boundary? \n\nHowever, the provided code does not do that. \n\nGiven the constraints of the problem (t<=100) and the total_boundary up to 4e9, we can iterate over divisors of total_boundary? \n\nBut the problem says the total output integers are at most 200000, so the total number of divisors over all test cases is bounded by 200000? \n\nBut the provided code structure is fixed. We are only to fill the TODO. \n\nTherefore, we must assume that the current divisor iteration (over half_perimeter) is sufficient? \n\nBut the sample test cases work. \n\nAnd the known solution in the contest might have been to consider the divisors of half_perimeter and then also the factor 2? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter, so the divisors of total_boundary are the divisors of half_perimeter and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2? \n\nBut that is not true: the divisors of 2*half_perimeter are the divisors of half_perimeter and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2, but also divisors that are divisors of 2 and not of half_perimeter? \n\nActually, the divisors of 2*half_perimeter are:\n\n   { d, 2*d : for d dividing half_perimeter }  if half_perimeter is even? \n   and if half_perimeter is odd, then the divisors are { d, 2*d : for d dividing half_perimeter } and also the divisors that are 2 times a divisor of half_perimeter? \n\nBut in any case, the code does not do that. \n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, and the sample test cases work with the current divisor iteration (over half_perimeter), we will complete the TODO by checking both w and l mod a.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the divisor `a` might be 1? We already have 1 in the set. But adding again is harmless.\n\nAlso, note that the divisor `a` might be large? But the condition holds.\n\nBut what if a is 0? The problem says a>=1, and the divisor loop starts at 2, and then we consider a in [i, div] which are at least 2? But note: when half_perimeter=0? w+l-2=0 -> w=l=1? but w,l>=3. So no.\n\nTherefore, we complete program2.py with:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the code already has an initial set {1,2}. Why 2? \n\nIn the sample, 2 is already there. But what if we have a test case where 2 is not a solution? \n\nFor example, w=4, l=4: \n   half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6.\n   total_boundary=12.\n   a=2: \n        w % 2 = 0 -> condition holds.\n        l % 2 = 0 -> condition holds -> so 2 is a solution.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nBut what if w=3, l=3: \n   a=2: \n        w % 2 = 1 -> condition holds.\n        l % 2 = 1 -> condition holds -> 2 is a solution.\n\nSo the initial set {1,2} is safe.\n\nBut what if a=2 is not a solution in some case? \n\nExample: w=5, l=5: \n   a=2: \n        w % 2 = 1 -> condition holds.\n        l % 2 = 1 -> condition holds -> 2 is a solution.\n\nSo it seems always a solution? \n\nBut the problem says: a=1 is always a solution? and a=2 is also always a solution? \n\nActually, the boundary area is 2*(w+l-2). This is even? So divisible by 2. And the remainders w%2 and l%2 are either 0 or 1, which are <=2. So a=2 is always a solution? \n\nBut the problem says: \"For which values of a\". The example: w=3, l=5 -> a=1,2,3. \n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the divisor `a` might be the same as one already in the set? The set will handle duplicates.\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem is about adding straight lines on an infinite hexagonal grid to create empty equilateral triangles. Given n, we must output the minimum number of lines needed to create at least n triangles.\n\nThe existing code:\n   Precomputes an array `cnt` such that `cnt[k]` is the number of triangles created by k lines? \n   Then it uses binary search to find the minimum k such that cnt[k] >= n.\n\nThe precomputation:\n\n   ctr = [0,0,0]   # three counters?\n   cnt = [0] \n   i = 0\n   tot = 0\n   s = 0\n   while tot < 10**9:\n        tot += 2*(s - ctr[i])\n        cnt.append(tot)\n        ctr[i] += 1\n        s += 1\n        i = (i+1) % 3   # but note: the code does: i += 1; if i==3: i=0 -> but the current code does: i += 1 and then if i==3: i=0 -> but the code has: \"i += 1\" and then \"if i == 3: i = 0\" -> but the initial i=0, then after increment i=1, then 2, then 3 -> then reset to 0.\n\nWhat is being computed?\n\n   s: starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.\n   ctr: an array of three counters, initially [0,0,0]. \n   tot: initially 0.\n\n   In the first iteration (s=0, i=0):\n        tot += 2*(0 - ctr[0]) = 2*(0-0)=0 -> tot=0.\n        cnt.append(0) -> so cnt[1]=0.\n        ctr[0] becomes 1.\n        s becomes 1.\n        i becomes 1.\n\n   Second iteration (s=1, i=1):\n        tot += 2*(1 - ctr[1]) = 2*(1-0)=2 -> tot=2.\n        cnt.append(2) -> cnt[2]=2.\n        ctr[1] becomes 1.\n        s becomes 2.\n        i becomes 2.\n\n   Third iteration (s=2, i=2):\n        tot += 2*(2 - ctr[2]) = 2*(2-0)=4 -> tot=6.\n        cnt.append(6) -> cnt[3]=6.\n        ctr[2] becomes 1.\n        s becomes 3.\n        i becomes 3 -> then reset to 0.\n\n   Fourth iteration (s=3, i=0):\n        tot += 2*(3 - ctr[0]) = 2*(3-1)=4 -> tot=10.\n        cnt.append(10) -> cnt[4]=10.\n        ctr[0] becomes 2.\n        s becomes 4.\n        i becomes 1.\n\n   Fifth iteration (s=4, i=1):\n        tot += 2*(4 - ctr[1]) = 2*(4-1)=6 -> tot=16.\n        cnt.append(16) -> cnt[5]=16.\n\n   We see: \n        k=0: 0\n        k=1: 0\n        k=2: 2\n        k=3: 6\n        k=4: 10\n        k=5: 16\n\nThe problem says: \n   In the first test case: n=1 -> output 2 (because with 2 lines we get 2 triangles, which is >=1).\n   n=2 -> output 2.\n   n=3 -> output 3 (because with 2 lines we get 2 triangles, which is <3, but with 3 lines we get 6 triangles).\n\nSo the array `cnt` is the total triangles for k lines? \n\nThe binary search function:\n\n   def solve(sn):\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        return str(s)\n\nWe are doing a binary search for the smallest k such that cnt[k] >= t.\n\nThe loop condition: while s < e.\n\nWe set m = (s+e)//2.\n\nIf cnt[m] >= t, then we set e = m.\n\nOtherwise, we should set s = m+1? \n\nBecause we are looking for the first index where cnt[k] >= t. \n\nSo the TODO is: s = m+1.\n\nBut note: the initial s=0, e=len(cnt)-1.\n\nExample: t=1.\n   We know that k=0:0, k=1:0, k=2:2 -> so the answer should be 2.\n\n   Initially: s=0, e=5 (if we have at least 6 elements? we have cnt[0..5] = [0,0,2,6,10,16]? but note: the precomputation: \n        cnt[0]=0 (from the initial)\n        then we appended: \n            s=0: cnt[1]=0\n            s=1: cnt[2]=2\n            s=2: cnt[3]=6\n            s=3: cnt[4]=10\n            s=4: cnt[5]=16\n        and then we break when tot>=10**9.\n\n   So the array `cnt` has indices 0..?.\n\n   The binary search:\n\n        s=0, e=5.\n        m = (0+5)//2 = 2 -> cnt[2]=2 >=1 -> then e=2.\n        then s=0, e=2: m=1 -> cnt[1]=0 <1 -> then we set s = m+1 = 2.\n        then s=2, e=2 -> break -> return 2.\n\n   That is correct.\n\n   For t=3:\n        s=0, e=5 -> m=2: cnt[2]=2 <3 -> then s = 2+1=3.\n        then s=3, e=5: m=4: cnt[4]=10>=3 -> e=4.\n        then s=3, e=4: m=3: cnt[3]=6>=3 -> e=3.\n        then s=3, e=3 -> break -> return 3.\n\n   But the expected answer for n=3 is 3? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines\" for n=3.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \n        \"In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed. ... In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines\"\n\n   The third test case: n=3 -> output 3.\n\n   So the binary search is set to find the minimal k such that cnt[k]>=n.\n\n   Therefore, the TODO is: s = m+1.\n\nBut note: the variable names: \n   The binary search is set up to find the first index e in the range [0, len(cnt)-1] such that cnt[e]>=t? \n\n   Actually, the loop:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\n   Then we return s.\n\n   This is standard binary search for the first index >= t.\n\n   So the missing line is: s = m+1.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n    s = m+1\n\nBut note: the code has:\n\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we write: s = m+1\n\nBut note: the code after the loop returns str(s). \n\nSo we are returning the index s. And the index s corresponds to the number of lines? \n\nIn the precomputation, we have:\n\n   cnt[0] = 0   -> 0 lines\n   cnt[1] = 0   -> 1 line\n   cnt[2] = 2   -> 2 lines\n   cnt[3] = 6   -> 3 lines\n\nSo the index in the array `cnt` is the number of lines? \n\nTherefore, the binary search returns the number of lines.\n\nSo the TODO is: s = m+1.\n\n### Summary\n\nWe have:\n\nprogram1.py: \n   The missing line: \"odd += 1\"\n\nprogram2.py:\n   The missing block: \n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the code is indented. We are inside the for-loop and the if-statement. The existing code has:\n\n        if mod_i != 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So we must write two lines with proper indentation.\n\n   We write:\n        if l % a <= 2:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the variable `a` is defined, and `solutions` is the set.\n\nprogram3.py:\n   The missing line: \"s = m+1\"\n\nNow, we output in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"odd += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"            if l % a <= 2:\\n                solutions.add(a)\",\n  \"program3\": \"            s = m+1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and \"NOT as markdown code\". So we output the exact string.\n\nHowever, for program2.py, the existing code has 12 spaces of indentation for the for-loop and then 16 for the if. We must match the indentation.\n\nThe existing code for the TODO part is at the same level as the comment. The comment is:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO is at the same indentation level as the if. We are replacing the comment with two lines:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nBut the existing code already has the first if. So we are only adding two lines after the first if.\n\nBut the existing code for the for-loop:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO comment with:\n\n                if l % a <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\nBut note: the existing if is already at an indentation of 16 (if the for-loop is at 12). \n\nSo the two lines we add should be indented by 16 and 20 respectively.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the existing code uses 4-space indents? \n\nWe can write:\n\n   \"program2\": \"    if l % a <= 2:\\n        solutions.add(a)\"\n\nBut that would be 4 and 8? \n\nBut the existing code:\n\n   for a in [i, div]:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO\n\nThe for-loop is indented by 8 (relative to the outer for) and the inner for is indented by 12? \n\nActually, the code:\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n        if mod_i != 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at the same level as the inner for-loop body. \n\nWe are going to replace the TODO comment with:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\nSo the first line (the if) is at the same indentation as the previous if (which is 12 spaces from the outer for? or 16?).\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, we can count:\n\n   The outer for: 4 spaces\n   The inner for: 8 spaces\n   The for-loop body: 12 spaces\n\nSo:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a   # 12 spaces\n            if mod_a <= 2:   # 12 spaces\n                ...          # 16 spaces\n\nSo the TODO is at 16 spaces. Then we add:\n\n                if l % a <= 2:   # 16 spaces\n                    solutions.add(a)   # 20 spaces\n\nBut we can write:\n\n   \"program2\": \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"\n\nAlternatively, we can use the exact same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n   program1: \"odd += 1\"\n   program2: two lines: \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"\n   program3: \"            s = m+1\"\n\nBut note: in program3, the TODO is in the else block. The existing code:\n\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else block is at 12 spaces? \n\nWe are replacing the TODO with \"s = m+1\", which should be at 16 spaces? \n\nBut the existing code in the else block is at 12, and the TODO comment is at 16? \n\nActually, the code:\n\n        if cnt[m] >= t:\n            e = m\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else block is at 8 spaces? \n\nThe function solve is defined with 4-space indents? \n\n   def solve(sn):\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the else is at 12 spaces (relative to the function) and the TODO comment is at 16. \n\nSo we write: \"                s = m+1\" (16 spaces) for program3? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we must match the existing.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"only the missing code\".\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n   program1: \"odd += 1\"\n   program2: \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"\n   program3: \"                s = m+1\"\n\nBut note: the program3 code has 16 spaces? \n\nBut the existing else block has 12 spaces for the else and 16 for the body. So the body of the else should be indented by 16.\n\nSo we write 16 spaces for the line in program3.\n\nBut 16 spaces is a lot. We can write the exact string.\n\nAlternatively, we can use tabs? The problem does not specify. But the original code uses spaces.\n\nWe'll output the string with the exact same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\nBut the problem does not show the exact indentation level. However, we can infer:\n\n   In program1: the existing code has:\n\n        for i in l:\n            if i%2==0:\n                even+=1\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So the TODO is at the same level as the if body. We are replacing the comment with \"odd += 1\", which should be at the same level as the if body (which is 4 more than the for loop body).\n\n   So we write: \"    odd += 1\" (with 4 spaces) or without? The existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n   But the existing code: the for loop body is indented by 4, the if body by 8. So the else body should be 8? \n\n   Actually, the code:\n\n        for i in l:\n            if i%2==0:   # 4 spaces\n                even+=1   # 8 spaces\n            else:         # 4 spaces\n                # TODO   # 8 spaces\n\n   So we write: \"    odd += 1\" (with 8 spaces? but that would be two tabs? or 8 spaces). \n\n   However, the problem does not specify. But the code in the example uses spaces.\n\n   We'll assume 4 spaces per indent.\n\n   So program1: the missing code is 4 spaces? Actually, the else block is at the same level as the if. The if body is at 8 (because the for is 4, then the if is 4, then the body of if is 8). The else body should be 8.\n\n   So we write: \"    odd += 1\" (with 8 spaces? but that is two indents: 4 for the for body, 4 for the if/else body -> total 8).\n\n   But the existing code in the if body is \"even+=1\" at 8 spaces.\n\n   So we write: \"    odd += 1\" (with 8 spaces) -> but that would be 8 spaces? \n\n   However, the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the exact line that replaces the TODO.\n\n   The TODO is at 8 spaces? Then we output \"    odd += 1\" with 8 spaces? \n\n   But the example code for program1 has: \n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the comment with \"odd += 1\", but we must keep the same indentation.\n\n   So we output: \"    odd += 1\" (with 4 spaces? because the else is at 4 and the body should be 8? but the comment is at 8). \n\n   Actually, the comment is at 8 spaces. So we output the code at 8 spaces.\n\n   But the problem does not show the exact number of spaces. We'll assume the code uses 4-space indentation.\n\n   Therefore, for program1: the missing code is 4 spaces and then \"odd += 1\", but the existing line above is \"even+=1\" at 8 spaces? \n\n   So we output: \"    odd += 1\" (which is 4 spaces) -> no, that would be 4. We need 8? \n\n   Actually, the existing code:\n\n        for i in l:\n            if i%2==0:\n                even+=1\n            else:\n                # TODO\n\n   The if and else are at the same level (4 spaces). The body of the if is at 8 spaces. The body of the else (the comment) is at 8 spaces.\n\n   So we output: \"        odd += 1\" (with 8 spaces) for program1? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact string that replaces the TODO.\n\n   The TODO is a comment at 8 spaces. We replace it with \"        odd += 1\" (8 spaces) -> but that would be 8 spaces? \n\n   Actually, the line \"odd += 1\" should be at the same level as \"even+=1\", which is 8 spaces.\n\n   So we output: \"        odd += 1\" (with 8 spaces).\n\n   But the problem does not specify the exact string. However, to be safe, we output the code as it would appear.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? But the problem requires exact.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we will output:\n\n   program1: \"        odd += 1\"   (8 spaces)\n\n   program2: \n        The existing code has 12 spaces for the line we are at? \n        We are adding two lines:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:   -> at the same level as the previous if (which is 12 spaces) -> but the previous if is at 12, and we are inside the for-loop which is at 8? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO\n\n        The for-loop is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for). The body of the for-loop is at 12. The if is at 12, and the body of the if is at 16.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            if l % a <= 2:   -> at 16 spaces? \n                solutions.add(a)   -> at 20 spaces.\n\n        But the existing TODO is at 16 spaces. So we output:\n\n            \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"\n\n        with 16 and 20 spaces? \n\n        How many spaces total? \n\n        The outer for (over i) is at 4, then the inner for is at 8, then the body of the inner for is at 12, then the if is at 12, then the body of the if is at 16.\n\n        So the first line of the missing code is at 16 spaces, the second at 20.\n\n        We write:\n\n            program2: \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"\n\n        (16 spaces for the first line, 20 for the second)\n\n   program3: \n        The else block is at 8 spaces? and the body should be at 12? \n\n        The code:\n\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s + e) >> 1\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO\n\n        The while is at 4, the if-else at 8, the else body at 12.\n\n        So we write: \"            s = m+1\" (with 12 spaces)\n\n        But the existing TODO is at 12? \n\n        Actually, the else body is at 12. So we output 12 spaces and then \"s = m+1\".\n\n        But the code in the if body is \"e = m\" at 12 spaces.\n\n        So we output: \"            s = m+1\" (with 12 spaces).\n\nBut note: the program3 code has:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else is at 8 spaces (relative to the while) and the TODO is at 12.\n\nSo we write: \"    s = m+1\" (with 4 spaces? but that would be 4) -> no, we need 12? \n\nActually, the entire function is indented by 4, the while by 8, the if by 12, the else by 12, and the body of the else by 16? \n\nBut the existing code in the if body is \"e = m\" at 12? \n\nWait, the code:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO\n\nThe while body is at 4 (relative to the function) -> no, the function body is at 4, the while is at 8, the statements inside the while are at 12? \n\nBut the example code:\n\n   def solve(sn):\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe while is at 8, the m=... at 12, the if at 12, the e=m at 16, the else at 12, the TODO at 16.\n\nSo the TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3 is at 16 spaces: \"    s = m+1\" (with 16 spaces) -> but that would be 16 spaces? \n\nWe write: \"                s = m+1\" (16 spaces).\n\nBut 16 spaces is 4 indents (each 4 spaces). \n\nAlternatively, we can count:\n\n   The function: 0\n   The body of the function: 4\n   The while: 8\n   The body of the while: 12\n   The if and else: 12\n   The body of the if and else: 16.\n\nSo we write 16 spaces.\n\nBut to be safe, we output the exact string that would replace the TODO, which is at the same indentation as the \"e = m\" in the if branch.\n\nThe if branch has \"e = m\" at 16 spaces. So the else branch should be at 16 spaces.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n   program1: \"        odd += 1\"   (8 spaces: two indents)\n   program2: \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\"   (16 and 20 spaces: 4 and 5 indents)\n   program3: \"                s = m+1\"   (16 spaces: 4 indents)\n\nBut we can write the exact string with spaces.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we must match the existing.\n\nGiven the complexity, we output the code as we inferred.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        odd += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\",\n  \"program3\": \"                s = m+1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code has two lines. We use a newline character.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines separately? But the problem says output the missing code as a string.\n\nWe'll use the newline escape.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so for program2 we output two lines.\n\nBut the JSON must be a string. We can use \\n.\n\nLet me write the JSON string.\n\nBut note: the program1 code is one line, program2 is two lines, program3 is one line.\n\nWe'll output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        odd += 1\", \"program2\": \"                if l % a <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\", \"program3\": \"                s = m+1\"}\n\nBut we must escape the quotes? The problem does not require that, but the output is a JSON string.\n\nActually, we are writing a JSON object. The values are strings that may contain newlines.\n\nWe'll rely on the newline character.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the program2 part as a single string with an embedded newline.\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nLet's write the final answer."
