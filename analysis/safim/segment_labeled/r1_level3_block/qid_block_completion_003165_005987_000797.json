The precomputation:\n\n```python\nctr = [0, 0, 0]\ncnt = [0]\n\ni = 0\ntot = 0\ns = 0\nwhile tot < 10**9:\n    tot += 2*(s - ctr[i])\n    cnt.append(tot)\n    ctr[i] += 1\n    s += 1\n    i += 1\n    if i == 3: i = 0\n```\n\nWe have an array `ctr` of three counters and `s` starting at 0.",

The known solution for this problem is that the number of triangles formed by `k` lines is:\n\nLet `k = 3*a + b` (with `b=0,1,2`). Then the number of triangles is: \n   `a*(a-1) + 2*a*b`   [but note the example: 2 lines give 2 triangles]\n\nActually, the known formula is:\n\nThe number of triangles = 2 * ( a1*(a1-1) + a2*(a2-1) + a3*(a3-1) + a1*a2 + a2*a3 + a3*a1 ) But wait, the grid has three directions. When we add `k` lines, we break `k` into three nonnegative integers `(a, b, c)` such that `a+b+c=k` and then the number of triangles is `2*(a*b + b*c + c*a)`. But note: the problem says that after adding 2 lines we get 2 triangles. Indeed, if we have two lines in the same direction, then we get 0 triangles? Actually, the lines must be in different directions? But the note says: after the first line, no triangles. After the second line, two triangles. So two lines in two different directions? Then the formula: `2*(a*b + b*c + c*a)` for `a=1, b=1, c=0` gives `2*(1*1 + 1*0 + 0*1) = 2*1 = 2`. For three lines: if we have one in each direction, then `a=1, b=1, c=1`: `2*(1*1+1*1+1*1)=6`. But the example says 3 lines create 8 triangles? Actually, the example image shows two triangles for two lines, and then for three lines they show 8? Wait, the note says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below.\" and the sample input `n=3` should output 3. But the example also says: after two lines we have two triangles, so for `n=3` we need three lines. The example says that with three lines we get more than two triangles?",

      "text": "Actually, the problem says: \"After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be created no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once.\" and then for three lines, we get more. Looking at the precomputation:\n\nWe have `ctr` of three zeros. Then:\n\nStep0: i=0, tot += 2*(0 - 0) = 0 -> cnt[1]=0? But then we set `ctr[0]=1`, `s=1`, i=1. Step1: i=1, tot += 2*(1 - 0) = 2 -> tot=2, then cnt[2]=2. Then `ctr[1]=1`, `s=2`, i=2. Step2: i=2, tot += 2*(2 - 0) = 4 -> tot=6, then cnt[3]=6. Then `ctr[2]=1`, `s=3`, i=0. Step3: i=0, tot += 2*(3 - 1) = 2*2=4 -> tot=10, then cnt[4]=10. Then `ctr[0]=2`, `s=4`, i=1. Step4: i=1, tot += 2*(4 - 1) = 2*3=6 -> tot=16, then cnt[5]=16. Then `ctr[1]=2`, `s=5`, i=2. Step5: i=2, tot += 2*(5 - 1) = 2*4=8 -> tot=24, then cnt[6]=24. This matches the known sequence: \n  k=1: 0\n  k=2: 2\n  k=3: 6\n  k=4: 10\n  k=5: 16\n  k=6: 24\n\nBut note: the problem says that with 3 lines we get 8 triangles? But our cnt[3]=6. Wait, the problem note says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below.\" and the sample input `n=3` should output 3. But our cnt[3]=6 which is >=3, so the answer for n=3 would be 3? That matches. But the note also says that with 2 lines we get 2 triangles, so for n=1 and n=2 we output 2. But the example: \n  Input: \n      t=?\n      n=1 -> output 2? \n      n=2 -> output 2?\n      n=3 -> output 3. But the precomputed array `cnt`:\n  cnt[0]=0\n  cnt[1]=0\n  cnt[2]=2\n  cnt[3]=6\n\nSo for n=1: we need at least 2 lines (because 1 line gives 0, 2 lines give 2 which is >=1) -> output 2. For n=2: 2 lines give 2 -> output 2. For n=3: 2 lines give 2 (which is <3) so we need 3 lines -> output 3. So the precomputation is correct. Now, the binary search function:\n\n```python\ndef solve(sn):\n\tt = int(sn)\n\ts, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n\twhile s < e:\n\t\tm = (s + e) >> 1\n\t\tif cnt[m] >= t:\n\t\t\te = m\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\treturn str(s)\n```\n\nWe are searching for the smallest index `m` such that `cnt[m] >= t`. The binary search is set up as a lower bound. The missing part is: when `cnt[m] < t`, we should set `s = m+1`? But note: the loop condition is `while s < e`. We set `m = (s+e)//2`. If `cnt[m] >= t`, we set `e = m`. Otherwise, we should set `s = m+1` because `m` is too small. So the missing line is: `s = m+1` But let's check:\n\nWe want the smallest index `s` such that `cnt[s] >= t`. Example: t=1 -> we want 2 (which is at index2). Initially: s=0, e=len(cnt)-1 (which is 6, say). m = (0+6)//2 = 3 -> cnt[3]=6>=1 -> e=3. Then s=0, e=3 -> m=1 -> cnt[1]=0<1 -> then we set s = 1+1 = 2. Then s=2, e=3 -> m=2 -> cnt[2]=2>=1 -> e=2. Then s=2, e=2 -> break -> return 2. For t=2: \n  m=3: 6>=2 -> e=3. m=1: 0<2 -> s=2. then m=2: 2>=2 -> e=2 -> break -> return 2. For t=3:\n  m=3: 6>=3 -> e=3. m=1: 0<3 -> s=2. then m=2: 2<3 -> s=3. then break -> return 3. So it works. Therefore, for program2, the missing code is: `s = m+1`\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: Alice and Bob eat candies from the ends. They want the total weight eaten by each to be equal.",

We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem is about finding two different paths from a start hall `s` to some common hall `t` (different from `s`) such that the paths share only `s` and `t`. The code provided uses DFS to try to find two such paths.\n\nLooking at the code, we see:\n- The main loop iterates over the children of `s`.\n- For each child, it calls `DFS(child)` which returns either a hall (if it finds a node that is visited but not in the current DFS tree, meaning a cycle or cross edge) or -1.\n- If such a node `end` is found, then we reset the visited array and use `DFS_get_path` to find a path from the child to `end` (and then we try to get two such paths).\n\nHowever, the current code only breaks after the first `end` found and then tries to build two paths from `s` to that `end` by using two different children? But note: the `DFS` function is called for each child of `s` until one returns a non -1. Then we break and then we try to get two paths from `s` to that `end` by using two different children? Actually, the code then does:\n```python\n        visited = [False] * n\n        parent_list=[-1]*n\n        visited[s]=True\n        ans=[]\n        for child in graph[s]:\n            if DFS_get_path(child):\n                ans.append([s]+get_path(end))\n            if len(ans)==2:\n                break\n```\n\nBut note: the `DFS_get_path` function is called for each child of `s` and if it returns True (meaning it found a path from `child` to `end`), then we add the path `s` (then the path from `child` to `end`). However, we are trying to get two different paths. The problem is that the two paths must be disjoint in the middle. The current approach might not guarantee that because the two paths we get might share intermediate nodes.\n\nBut the problem says: we are allowed to choose any `t`. The intended solution is to find two distinct children of `s` (say `c1` and `c2`) such that from `c1` and `c2` we can both reach a common node `t` (which is not `s`) and the two paths (from `c1` to `t` and from `c2` to `t`) do not share any node (except `t`) and also do not include `s` again until the end? Actually, the paths are `s->...->t` and `s->...->t` and the intermediate nodes must be distinct.\n\nHowever, the provided DFS function is designed to detect a node that is visited by two different subtrees? The DFS function for a child of `s` returns a node that is visited but not in the current DFS tree (so it must have been visited in a previous DFS for a different child). That node `end` is then used as `t`.\n\nBut then we need two paths: one from `s` via the first child to `end` and one from `s` via the second child to `end`. However, the code then does:\n- It resets the visited array and then for each child of `s` (in the same order) it tries to build a path from that child to `end` (using `DFS_get_path`). But note: the first path we build might block the second because we mark visited nodes.\n\nBut observe: the `DFS_get_path` function uses a stack and marks visited. However, we reset the visited array and then run `DFS_get_path` for each child in a loop. But the first successful `DFS_get_path` will mark a path from that child to `end`, and then the next `DFS_get_path` might not be able to go through the same nodes. However, we require the two paths to be disjoint (except at `s` and `t`). So we must record two different paths that are disjoint.\n\nBut the current code does not enforce disjointness. It just builds two arbitrary paths from `s` to `end` via two different children. However, the two paths might share an intermediate node. That would be invalid.\n\nTherefore, the intended solution in the provided code structure might be flawed. But note: the problem says that we can choose any `t`. The known solution for this problem is to do a BFS/DFS from `s` and record the parent and the depth. Then we look for a node that is reached by two different paths (so two different incoming edges from two different children of `s`). Actually, the known solution is:\n\n- We want two distinct paths from `s` to some `t` that are internally disjoint.\n\nOne known approach is to use two BFS trees? But note the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n- Let `parent1` and `parent2` be two arrays that record two different predecessors for a node. We do a BFS from `s`. When we visit a node `u` for the first time, we set `parent1[u] = v` (the node we came from). If we visit `u` again from a different path, then we have two paths: one from `parent1[u]` and one from the current edge. Then we can reconstruct the two paths.\n\nBut the provided code does not do that. Instead, it does:\n\n- For each child of `s`, we do a DFS. The DFS function is:\n\n```python\ndef DFS(start):\n    nodes=set()\n    stack=[start]\n    while stack:\n        parent=stack.pop()\n        if(not visited[parent]):\n            nodes.add(parent)\n            visited[parent]=True\n            for child in graph[parent]:\n                if (not visited[child]):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                else:\n                    if child not in nodes and child!=s:\n                        return child\n        else:\n            if parent not in nodes and parent != s:\n                return parent\n    return -1\n```\n\nThe missing part is in the inner loop. We are traversing the children. If the child is not visited, we should push it to the stack? But note: the DFS is iterative. So we should push the child to the stack. So the missing line is:\n\n```python\n                    stack.append(child)\n```\n\nBut why? Because we are doing DFS: we need to visit the child. So we push it to the stack.\n\nBut also note: the DFS function is designed to return a node that is visited but not in the current DFS tree (the set `nodes`). The condition in the `else` branch of the for-loop: if we see a visited child that is not in the current DFS tree (so it was visited in a previous DFS for a different child) and that child is not `s`, then we return that child.\n\nAlso, there is an `else` for the parent pop: if the parent was already visited (but then why did we pop it? because we pushed it again? Actually, the code marks a node as visited when we first pop it. So the `else` branch might be for a node that was visited earlier? But note: we check `if(not visited[parent])` at the beginning. So the `else` branch might never be executed? Actually, the `else` branch is for the case when the node is already visited? But we only push unvisited nodes? So the `else` branch might be dead code? \n\nBut wait: the DFS function is called multiple times (for each child of `s`). The visited array is global. So when we do the first DFS for a child, we mark nodes. Then when we do the next DFS for a different child, we might encounter a node that was visited in the previous DFS. That is the key: the DFS function for the next child might see a node that was visited in a DFS for a previous child.\n\nSo the DFS function for a child `c`:\n- It traverses the graph starting from `c`.\n- If it finds a node that is already visited (by a DFS for a previous child) and that node is not in the current DFS tree (so it's from a different branch) and is not `s`, then we return that node.\n\nTherefore, the DFS function is designed to find a node that is reachable from `c` and was visited in a DFS for a different child of `s`. That node is then our `t`.\n\nSo the missing line in the DFS function is to push the child to the stack so that we can traverse it.\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is: `stack.append(child)`\n\nBut note: the DFS function also has an `else` branch for the parent pop. That branch is taken if the parent was already visited? But we mark the parent as visited when we pop it. So the `else` branch is never taken? Actually, the condition at the top: `if(not visited[parent])` ... `else: ...`. So if the parent was visited, we go to the else branch. How can that happen? Because we might push the same node multiple times? We avoid pushing a node if it is visited? Actually, we push only unvisited children. But we might push a node that becomes visited by the time we pop it? That is possible in iterative DFS if we push the same node multiple times? But we check `if (not visited[child])` before pushing. So we push a child only if it is not visited. Then when we pop it, it should be unvisited. So the `else` branch should never be taken? \n\nBut note: the visited array is global and we are doing DFS for multiple children. So when we start the DFS for a new child, the visited array has marks from previous DFS. So when we pop a node that was visited in a previous DFS, we hit the else branch. Then we check: if the parent (which is visited) is not in the current DFS tree (the set `nodes`) and parent != s, then we return parent. Why? Because we have encountered a node that was visited in a previous DFS (so from a different branch) and that node is not `s`. Then that node is a candidate `t`.\n\nSo the DFS function can return a node in two ways:\n1. During the traversal of the current DFS tree, we find a child that is visited and not in the current DFS tree and not `s` -> return that child.\n2. When popping a node that is already visited (from a previous DFS) and that node is not in the current DFS tree and not `s` -> return that node.\n\nSo the DFS function is designed to return the first node that is already visited (from a previous DFS) that we encounter, either as a neighbor of a node we are visiting or as a node we are about to visit (but already visited).\n\nTherefore, the missing line is: `stack.append(child)`\n\nBut note: the DFS function does not mark the child as visited when we push it? We mark a node as visited only when we pop it. So we might push the same node multiple times? But we check `if (not visited[child])` before pushing. So we push each node at most once per DFS. So it's safe.\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is: `stack.append(child)`\n\nBut wait: the code after the DFS call then uses `end` to build two paths. How do we ensure the two paths are disjoint? The DFS function only returns one node. Then we build two paths: one from the child that caused the DFS to return a non -1 and then we try to build a path from every child of `s` to that `end`. But note: the two paths we build might share intermediate nodes. The problem requires disjointness.\n\nHowever, the known solution for this problem (using two DFS trees) is not fully implemented here. But the problem says: the two paths must be disjoint in the middle. The intended solution in the code might be to use the two children that lead to the same `t` and then the two paths are the one from the first child and the one from the second child. But note: the DFS function for the first child that returns a non -1 might have found a `t` that is visited by a previous DFS (for a different child). Then we have two distinct children: the one that was run in the previous DFS (which marked `t` as visited) and the current one. Then we can build:\n- Path1: from the previous DFS: we have a path from `s` to `t` via the first child (which we don't have stored, but we are going to rebuild it by doing `DFS_get_path` for both children?).\n\nBut the code then resets the visited array and then runs `DFS_get_path` for every child of `s` until it gets two that can reach `end`. But note: the two paths we build in `DFS_get_path` are built independently? And we reset the visited array. So the first `DFS_get_path` will mark the nodes in the first path, and then the second `DFS_get_path` must avoid those nodes? But the problem requires disjointness. So we must build two paths that are disjoint. The `DFS_get_path` function does not enforce disjointness. It just finds a path (any path) from the child to `end`. \n\nThis approach might not work. But note: the constraints are high (200,000 nodes) and we are doing DFS for each child until we get two? That could be O(n) children and each DFS could be O(n). Worst-case O(n^2). That is too slow.\n\nTherefore, the provided code might be intended for a different approach? Or perhaps the problem is known and there is a more efficient solution.\n\nBut the problem is known as \"Two Paths\" from a CodeForces contest. The known solution is:\n\n- We want two distinct paths from `s` to `t` that are internally disjoint.\n\nWe can do:\n- Let `dp[u]` be the predecessor of `u` in a BFS tree. We do a BFS from `s`. When we visit a node `u` for the first time, we set `dp[u] = the node we came from`. If we visit a node `u` that is already visited, then we have two paths: one from `dp[u]` and one from the current edge. Then we can reconstruct the two paths.\n\nBut the provided code does not do BFS. It does DFS per child of `s`.\n\nGiven the time, we must complete the code as given. The missing line in the DFS function is pushing the child to the stack.\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is: `stack.append(child)`\n\n### program2.py\nThe problem is about adding straight lines on an infinite hexagonal grid to form equilateral triangles. We are to find, for a given `n`, the minimum number of lines needed to form at least `n` triangles.\n\nThe code precomputes an array `cnt` such that `cnt[k]` is the number of triangles formed by `k` lines. Then it uses binary search to find the smallest `k` such that `cnt[k] >= n`.\n\nThe precomputation:\n\n```python\nctr = [0, 0, 0]\ncnt = [0]\n\ni = 0\ntot = 0\ns = 0\nwhile tot < 10**9:\n    tot += 2*(s - ctr[i])\n    cnt.append(tot)\n    ctr[i] += 1\n    s += 1\n    i += 1\n    if i == 3: i = 0\n```\n\nWe have an array `ctr` of three counters and `s` starting at 0. The loop increments `s` at each step and then updates `tot` by adding `2*(s - ctr[i])`. Then it increments `ctr[i]` and `s`, and cycles `i` from 0 to 2.\n\nWhat is being counted? The known solution for this problem is that the number of triangles formed by `k` lines is:\n\nLet `k = 3*a + b` (with `b=0,1,2`). Then the number of triangles is: \n   `a*(a-1) + 2*a*b`   [but note the example: 2 lines give 2 triangles]\n\nActually, the known formula is:\n\nThe number of triangles = 2 * ( a1*(a1-1) + a2*(a2-1) + a3*(a3-1) + a1*a2 + a2*a3 + a3*a1 )\n\nBut wait, the grid has three directions. When we add `k` lines, we break `k` into three nonnegative integers `(a, b, c)` such that `a+b+c=k` and then the number of triangles is `2*(a*b + b*c + c*a)`. But note: the problem says that after adding 2 lines we get 2 triangles. Indeed, if we have two lines in the same direction, then we get 0 triangles? Actually, the lines must be in different directions? \n\nBut the note says: after the first line, no triangles. After the second line, two triangles. So two lines in two different directions? Then the formula: `2*(a*b + b*c + c*a)` for `a=1, b=1, c=0` gives `2*(1*1 + 1*0 + 0*1) = 2*1 = 2`.\n\nFor three lines: if we have one in each direction, then `a=1, b=1, c=1`: `2*(1*1+1*1+1*1)=6`. But the example says 3 lines create 8 triangles? Actually, the example image shows two triangles for two lines, and then for three lines they show 8? \n\nWait, the note says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below.\" and the sample input `n=3` should output 3. But the example also says: after two lines we have two triangles, so for `n=3` we need three lines. The example says that with three lines we get more than two triangles? Actually, the problem says: \"After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be created no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once.\" and then for three lines, we get more.\n\nLooking at the precomputation:\n\nWe have `ctr` of three zeros. Then:\n\nStep0: i=0, tot += 2*(0 - 0) = 0 -> cnt[1]=0? But then we set `ctr[0]=1`, `s=1`, i=1.\n\nStep1: i=1, tot += 2*(1 - 0) = 2 -> tot=2, then cnt[2]=2. Then `ctr[1]=1`, `s=2`, i=2.\n\nStep2: i=2, tot += 2*(2 - 0) = 4 -> tot=6, then cnt[3]=6. Then `ctr[2]=1`, `s=3`, i=0.\n\nStep3: i=0, tot += 2*(3 - 1) = 2*2=4 -> tot=10, then cnt[4]=10. Then `ctr[0]=2`, `s=4`, i=1.\n\nStep4: i=1, tot += 2*(4 - 1) = 2*3=6 -> tot=16, then cnt[5]=16. Then `ctr[1]=2`, `s=5`, i=2.\n\nStep5: i=2, tot += 2*(5 - 1) = 2*4=8 -> tot=24, then cnt[6]=24.\n\nThis matches the known sequence: \n  k=1: 0\n  k=2: 2\n  k=3: 6\n  k=4: 10\n  k=5: 16\n  k=6: 24\n\nBut note: the problem says that with 3 lines we get 8 triangles? But our cnt[3]=6. \n\nWait, the problem note says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below.\" and the sample input `n=3` should output 3. But our cnt[3]=6 which is >=3, so the answer for n=3 would be 3? That matches. But the note also says that with 2 lines we get 2 triangles, so for n=1 and n=2 we output 2. \n\nBut the example: \n  Input: \n      t=?\n      n=1 -> output 2? \n      n=2 -> output 2?\n      n=3 -> output 3.\n\nBut the precomputed array `cnt`:\n  cnt[0]=0\n  cnt[1]=0\n  cnt[2]=2\n  cnt[3]=6\n\nSo for n=1: we need at least 2 lines (because 1 line gives 0, 2 lines give 2 which is >=1) -> output 2.\nFor n=2: 2 lines give 2 -> output 2.\nFor n=3: 2 lines give 2 (which is <3) so we need 3 lines -> output 3.\n\nSo the precomputation is correct.\n\nNow, the binary search function:\n\n```python\ndef solve(sn):\n\tt = int(sn)\n\ts, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n\twhile s < e:\n\t\tm = (s + e) >> 1\n\t\tif cnt[m] >= t:\n\t\t\te = m\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\treturn str(s)\n```\n\nWe are searching for the smallest index `m` such that `cnt[m] >= t`. The binary search is set up as a lower bound. The missing part is: when `cnt[m] < t`, we should set `s = m+1`? \n\nBut note: the loop condition is `while s < e`. We set `m = (s+e)//2`. If `cnt[m] >= t`, we set `e = m`. Otherwise, we should set `s = m+1` because `m` is too small.\n\nSo the missing line is: `s = m+1`\n\nBut let's check:\n\nWe want the smallest index `s` such that `cnt[s] >= t`. \n\nExample: t=1 -> we want 2 (which is at index2). \n  Initially: s=0, e=len(cnt)-1 (which is 6, say). \n  m = (0+6)//2 = 3 -> cnt[3]=6>=1 -> e=3.\n  Then s=0, e=3 -> m=1 -> cnt[1]=0<1 -> then we set s = 1+1 = 2.\n  Then s=2, e=3 -> m=2 -> cnt[2]=2>=1 -> e=2.\n  Then s=2, e=2 -> break -> return 2.\n\nFor t=2: \n  m=3: 6>=2 -> e=3.\n  m=1: 0<2 -> s=2.\n  then m=2: 2>=2 -> e=2 -> break -> return 2.\n\nFor t=3:\n  m=3: 6>=3 -> e=3.\n  m=1: 0<3 -> s=2.\n  then m=2: 2<3 -> s=3.\n  then break -> return 3.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, for program2, the missing code is: `s = m+1`\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: Alice and Bob eat candies from the ends. They want the total weight eaten by each to be equal. They can choose any contiguous segment from the left (Alice) and any contiguous segment from the right (Bob) such that the two segments do not overlap. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe code:\n\n```python\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n    print(f)\n```\n\nWe are iterating over test cases. The input is read: the first two lines are skipped? Actually, the first line is `t`, then each test case has two lines: the first is the number of candies, the second is the list of weights. The code: `for n in [*open(0)][2::2]` means we take every second line starting from index2 (0-indexed). So the first test case's list of weights is at index2, then the next at index4, etc.\n\nFor each test case, we have:\n  `n` is the list of weights.\n  `a` and `b` are the current sums for Alice and Bob, initially 0.\n  `l` and `r` are pointers: `l` starts at 0 (left) and `r` at the last index (right).\n  `f` is the answer for the test case, initially 0? But note: if they eat nothing, the total is 0. But the problem says: they want to be fair -> the sums must be equal. They can choose to eat nothing? Then the total candies eaten is 0. But the problem says: the maximum number of candies. So if they can eat some candies and have equal sums, we record the total number of candies (which is the number of candies Alice ate plus the number Bob ate) in `f` when `a==b`.\n\nThe loop: `while l<=r` meaning while there are candies between `l` and `r` (inclusive).\n\nThe condition:\n  If `a<=b`, then we add the leftmost candy (at `l`) to Alice and move `l` to the right.\n  Else if `b<a`, then we should add the rightmost candy (at `r`) to Bob and move `r` to the left.\n\nBut the missing part is in the `elif b<a` branch.\n\nSo we should do:\n   `b += n[r]`\n   `r -= 1`\n\nAlso, note that after updating `a` or `b`, we check if `a==b`. Then we set `f = len(n) - r + l - 1`. \n\nWhat is `len(n) - r + l - 1`? \n  The total candies eaten by Alice: from index0 to index `l-1` -> `l` candies.\n  The total candies eaten by Bob: from index `r+1` to the end -> `len(n)-1 - r` candies.\n  Total = `l + (len(n)-1 - r) = len(n) - 1 - r + l`.\n\nBut the expression is: `len(n) - r + l - 1` = `l + (len(n) - r - 1)`. That is the total.\n\nBut note: the entire array is `n[0..len(n)-1]`. \n  Alice has taken `n[0..l-1]` -> `l` candies.\n  Bob has taken `n[r+1..len(n)-1]` -> `len(n)-1 - r` candies.\n\nSo total = `l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + len(n) - 1 - r`.\n\nBut the expression is: `len(n) - r + l - 1` = `l + len(n) - r - 1`. Correct.\n\nWe set `f` to that total whenever `a==b`. And we continue? Why? Because we might find a later partition that has more candies? \n\nBut note: we are moving the pointers: we are essentially expanding Alice and Bob until they meet. And we record the last time the sums were equal. But the problem requires the maximum total candies. So we want the maximum value of `f` over the entire run.\n\nBut the code sets `f` to the current total whenever `a==b`. And we do not break? We continue until the pointers meet. Then we print `f`.\n\nBut what if there are multiple times when `a==b`? We want the maximum total candies. The total candies at a partition is `l + (len(n)-1 - r)`. As we move the pointers, `l` increases and `r` decreases, so the total candies (which is the number of candies eaten) is increasing? Actually, no: we are adding candies one by one. The total candies eaten is the sum of the candies taken by Alice and Bob. As we add a candy, the total increases by one. But when we set `f`, we record the current total. And we continue. Then we might get a larger total? Actually, the total candies eaten at any step is `l + (len(n)-1 - r)`. And as we proceed, `l` increases and `r` decreases, so the total increases? \n\nBut note: we are not necessarily always increasing the total? We start with 0 candies and then we add one candy at a time. The total candies eaten is increasing. But when we get a partition with `a==b`, we record the total at that moment. Then we continue and add more candies. But then the sums become unequal again. And we might get another partition with `a==b` later? And that partition would have more candies? \n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to choose any contiguous segments from the left and right. But the code is simulating: \n  Alice starts at the left and takes a contiguous segment from the left (in order) and Bob from the right (in order). And we are expanding until they meet. And we record every time the sums are equal. And the last time we record is the one with the most candies? \n\nBut note: the total candies eaten is increasing as we add more. So the last time we have `a==b` would be the one with the most candies? \n\nBut consider: \n  We start: a=0, b=0 -> f=0 (but we don't set f? because the condition `a==b` is true at the start? Then we set `f = len(n)-r+l-1` = `len(n) - (len(n)-1) + 0 - 1` = `len(n) - len(n) + 1 - 1 = 0`. Then we add a candy to Alice (if a<=b, which is true) -> then a becomes positive, b=0. Then we might later get a partition with more candies.\n\nBut the problem: they can choose to eat nothing? Then the total is 0. But the problem says: the maximum number of candies. So we want the maximum total over the entire run.\n\nThe code sets `f` to the current total whenever `a==b`. And we do not break. Then at the end, we print `f`. So if we have multiple equal sums, we record the last one (which has the most candies). \n\nBut what if we never have `a==b`? Then `f` remains 0? But initially we set `f=0` (with `a,b,l,f=[0]*4`). Then if we never set `f` in the loop, we output 0. That matches the sample: the third test case has no partition -> output 0.\n\nSo the missing code in the `elif b<a` branch is:\n\n```python\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n```\n\nBut note: the array `n` is the list of weights. The left pointer `l` is at the next available left candy, and the right pointer `r` is at the next available right candy.\n\nTherefore, for program3, the missing code is: \n   b += n[r]\n   r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code has `r=len(n)-1` initially. Then we use `n[r]` to get the rightmost candy.\n\nSo we output:\n\nFor program1: \"stack.append(child)\"\nFor program2: \"s = m+1\"\nFor program3: two lines? But the TODO is only one line. Actually, the code has:\n\n```python\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe must fill in two lines? But the TODO is one line. We can write:\n\n```python\n            b += n[r]; r -= 1\n```\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. And we are to output exactly what is missing. The original code has one line with a TODO. We replace that one line with two lines? Or we can write two lines? But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\nBut the code structure: we are in a while loop and an elif block. We need to do two operations. We can write:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the next line is an if statement (if a==b) that is not indented under the elif. So the two operations must be in the elif block.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n            b += n[r]; r -= 1\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the original code style uses multiple lines. So we write two lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing block is two lines. So we output:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the indentation. The current code is indented by 8 spaces (one level of 4 and then the block). So we output two lines with 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the code in the if branch above has:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nSo two lines. Similarly, we do two lines.\n\nTherefore, for program3, the missing code is two lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo we output:\n\nFor program1: \"stack.append(child)\"\nFor program2: \"s = m+1\"\nFor program3: \n   \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nBut note: the program3 code has 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the current code in the elif branch is at 8 spaces? Let me count:\n\nThe while loop: 4 spaces\n  if a<=b: ... -> 8 spaces for the block\n  elif b<a: -> 8 spaces, then the next line is a comment at 12 spaces.\n\nSo we output two lines at 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output exactly the two lines with the same indentation.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So for program3, we output two lines.\n\nBut the JSON format: we must put the string for program3 as a string that includes the newline.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as one string with a newline.\n\nBut the problem does not specify. We'll use a newline.\n\nNow, we output a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"stack.append(child)\",\n  \"program2\": \"s = m+1\",\n  \"program3\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program3 string has the exact indentation? The original code has 12 spaces? Actually, the code in the problem for the if branch above has:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nSo the block is indented by 4 more spaces. So the two lines we output should be indented by 12 spaces? Actually, the current code in the elif branch is:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO line is at 12 spaces. We replace that with two lines at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the above.\n\nBut wait: the program3 code has `a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1`. Then the while loop. The condition `if a<=b` is followed by two lines. Similarly, the `elif` should have two lines.\n\nBut note: the code after the if/elif is:\n\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n\nThis is at the same level as the if/elif. So it is executed every time.\n\nSo the missing code for program3 is two lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo we output the two lines with the exact indentation.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we output the two lines with the same amount of whitespace as the existing line in the if branch.\n\nIn the if branch: \n   \"            a+=n[l]\"\n   \"            l+=1\"\n\nSo we do the same for the elif branch.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
