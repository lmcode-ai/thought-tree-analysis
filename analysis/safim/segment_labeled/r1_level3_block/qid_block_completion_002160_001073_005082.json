We need a linear solution. Another idea: \n          We note that the OR(i) string is determined by the first position j where T[i+j]=='1' and T[p+j]=='0'. Because if for a shift i, at the first position j where T[p+j]=='0', if T[i+j]=='1', then we get a 1 there, and that is better than a shift that has 0 at that position? But lexicographical order: we want the earliest 1 in the string? We can try to find the shift i that has the earliest extra 1? Specifically, we want the shift i that minimizes the first occurrence where T[i+j]=='0' and we have a chance to set it to 1? -> no.

But the problem says: tests from 21 to 40 have n=10^6. However, the note: \"every character of s is chosen independently of other characters; for each character, the probability of it being 1 is exactly 1/2\"\n\n      This means that the first zero in t (p) is expected to be small? Why? Because the probability that the first character is 1 is 1/2, then the next is 1/2, so the probability that the first zero occurs at position k is (1/2)^{k+1}? So the expected value of p is about 2? Therefore, in randomly generated strings, p is small (constant on average). Therefore, the above O(p * len(Z)) is expected to be O(1 * n) = O(n) and might pass for n=10^6? But worst-case, if the string is all ones except the last character, then p = len(t)-1, which is about 10^6, and then the loop is 10^6 * (len(Z)=1) -> 10^6, which is acceptable? \n          len(Z) = n - p = 1, so the inner loop is 1, and the outer loop is p = 10^6 -> 10^6. But if the string is: \n          ones for the first half and then zeros: \n          p = len(t)/2, and len(Z)=len(t)/2, then the total is (len(t)/2) * (len(t)/2) = (n/2)^2 = 25e10 for n=10^6 -> 2.5e11 operations -> too many in Python. However, the problem says: tests from 4 to 10: n=5, tests from 11 to 20: n=1000, tests from 21 to 40: n=10^6. And the string is generated randomly with 1/2 for each bit. In random strings, the first zero in the string without leading zeros is expected to appear very early?",

Then res=31.\n\n          Therefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py with:\n\n              if i == 1:\n                  if '1' in s:\n                      first_one = s.index('1')\n                      t = s[first_one:] if '0' in t:\n                          p = t.index('0')\n                      else:\n                          p = 10**9\n                  else:\n                      first_one = 10**9\n                      p = 10**9\n              if p == 10**9:\n                  continue\n              shift = i-1\n              if shift > p:\n                  continue\n              start_index = first_one + shift\n              length = len(t) - p\n              end_index = start_index + length\n              if start_index >= len(s):\n                  continue\n              substring = s[start_index:end_index]\n              if substring == '':\n                  continue\n              try:\n                  num = int(substring, 2)\n              except:\n                  num = 0\n              candidate = s1 | num if candidate > res:\n                  res = candidate\n\n          But note: the variable `t` is defined only if '1' in s and we are in i==1. For i>=2, we rely on t being defined in the first iteration. But if the first iteration is skipped (because no ones), then for i>=2, we have t not defined? We set first_one and p to 10**9 in the else, so we skip by p==10**9. So it is safe. But what if there are ones, but in the first iteration we set p=10**9 (meaning no zero in t), then for i>=2, we skip. This is what we want. Therefore, we output this block for program1. ### program2.py\nThe problem: Minimum number of half-queens on an n x n board such that every square is attacked.

And we have the condition: 3*x+2<=n. We are to find the largest i (from 100000 down to 0) such that 3*i+2<=n. \n          Let x = i, the largest i satisfying 3*i+2<=n. Then we have: \n          3*x+2 <= n, and for x+1: 3*(x+1)+2 = 3*x+5 > n.\n\n      Then n - (3*x+2) = n - 3*x - 2, which is between 0 and 2? because 3*x+2 <= n < 3*x+5.

And we have: n = 3*x0+2 + r, where r = 0,1,2? \n          because 3*x0+2 <= n < 3*x0+5, so n = 3*x0+2, 3*x0+3, or 3*x0+4. Then (n-2) = 3*x0, 3*x0+1, 3*x0+2.\n      (n-2)%3 = 0, 1, 2. And the total placements = 2*x0+1 + (n-2)%3. We want this to be the minimum number of half-queens. The minimum number is ceil(2*n/3). Let's compute for n=4: x0: 3*x0+2<=4 -> x0=0: 2<=4 -> true, x0=1: 3+2=5>4 -> so x0=0. Then placements = 2*0+1 + (4-2)%3 = 1 + 2%3 = 1+2=3. ceil(2*4/3)=ceil(8/3)=3 -> matches. n=5:\n          x0: 3*x0+2<=5 -> x0=0:2<=5, x0=1:5<=5 -> true, x0=2:8>5 -> so x0=1. placements = 2*1+1 + (5-2)%3 = 3 + 3%3 = 3+0=3. But ceil(2*5/3)=ceil(10/3)=4 -> not match. This suggests there is a mistake. Let me check the known solution for half-queens: The minimum number is ceil(2*n/3). For n=5, ceil(10/3)=4. But our construction yields 3, which is less than 4? Therefore, the construction might be different. The known construction in the editorial of the problem (CodeForces Round #785 (Div. 2), problem C? or from a known problem) might be:\n\n          k = ceil(2*n/3)\n          placements: \n            for i in range(0, ceil(2*n/3), 3):\n                (i, 2*i)   but modulo n? But the provided code in the else part is:\n\n          for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n              if 3*i+2<=n:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          and then the following code uses x.\n\n      We are to fill the TODO. The only thing missing is to set x = i and break out of the loop? Because the loop is for i from 100000 down to 0, and we want the largest i such that 3*i+2<=n, which is x = floor((n-2)/3). Then we break out of the loop? We can do:\n\n          if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n              x = i\n              break\n\n      Then the rest of the code uses x. For n=5: \n          i=100000 to 0, the first i that satisfies: i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> true, so x=1. Then the placements: \n              first loop: i in range(1): \n                  placement: (z + 1 - 0 - 1, z+0) = (z+0, z) = (1,1) [if z=1 initially]\n              then z = 1+1 = 2\n              x becomes 2\n              second loop: i in range(2): \n                  i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                  i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n              then z = 2+2 = 4\n              then (n-2)%3 = (5-2)%3 = 0, so no more.\n              placements: (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) -> 3 placements. But the minimum number is 4? This indicates that the construction might be for a different problem. The problem: half-queen attacks: same row, same column, and one diagonal (the main diagonal? or any a-b=c-d? which is the diagonal with slope 1). The known solution for the minimum number of half-queens is indeed ceil(2*n/3). And the construction in the editorial might be:\n\n          Let k = ceil(2*n/3) If n % 3 == 0, then we use two sets: \n              Set1: (i, 2*i) for i in range(ceil(n/3)) [but modulo n?]\n          ...\n\n      But the provided code might be from an accepted solution for the problem. Let me try n=5 with the known solution from the editorial of a similar problem (CodeForces educational round ...):\n\n          We can do:\n              placements: \n                  (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (5,5)  -> 4 placements. But the provided code only produces 3 for n=5. Given the provided code structure, we trust that the construction is valid. But the example n=3 in the code: \n          k=2, and placements: (1,1) and (1,2) -> \n          (1,1) attacks: row1, col1, and diagonal: (1,1) -> a-b=0. (1,2) attacks: row1, col2, and diagonal: a-b = -1. Check cell (2,1): \n              row2: not attacked by either? \n              col1: attacked by (1,1)\n              diagonal: 2-1=1 -> is there a half-queen with a-b=1? (1,1): 1-1=0 ! =1\n                  (1,2): 1-2=-1 ! =1\n              -> not attacked. So the provided example n=3 in the code is not valid? The example in the problem for n=3: \n          \"it is impossible to cover the board with one half queen. There are multiple solutions for 2 half-queens; you can print any of them. \"\n\n          The provided code's solution for n=3: (1,1) and (1,2) does not cover (2,1) and (2,3) and (3,2) and (3,3)? Specifically, (2,1) is not attacked. Therefore, the provided code for n=3 might be incorrect. But the problem says: \"if there are multiple solutions, print any\", and the example in the problem might have a different solution. The example says: (2,2) is a valid solution for n=2? For n=3, one valid solution is: (2,2) and (1,3) or (3,1)? Given the complexity, and that the provided code might be from an accepted solution, we assume that the construction for n>=4 is valid. For n>=4, the construction in the provided code might be valid. Therefore, we fill the TODO with:\n\n          x = i\n          break\n\n      So the code becomes:\n\n          for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n              if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n                  x = i\n                  break\n\n      Then the rest of the code uses x. We output: x = i\n          break\n\n      But note: the variable x is not defined before. We must define it? The code after the loop uses x. \n\n      We can do:\n\n          for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n              if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n                  x = i\n                  break\n\n      This will define x and break. But what if no i satisfies? then x is not defined. The smallest n in the else branch is 4, and for n=4: \n          i=0: 3*0+2=2<=4 -> true, so x=0. So it is safe. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n          x = i\n          break\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: Count, for each vertex i (from 1 to n) in a particular family of trees (with n vertices, and for i from 2 to n, vertex i is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index), the number of trees for which i is the centroid.

Then in the next loop: \n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))   -> two arguments. out[i] -= oldrem   -> not using modmul.

So we do:\n\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      This is safe. Therefore, for program3.py, the missing function body is:\n\n      return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But note: the function is defined with `c=0`, and we use it.

We must output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"completion1\", \"program2\": \"completion2\", \"program3\": \"completion3\"}\n\n  And the completions are the exact code to fill the TODO. For program1, the TODO is in a for loop, and we are to replace the TODO with the above block. For program2, the TODO is in the for loop, and we replace with two lines: \"x = i\" and \"break\", but we must be careful: the code is in the if block. For program3, the TODO is the function body. We output the code as a string, and we must escape newlines and quotes? But the problem says: Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And in JSON, we must use escape sequences. However, the problem does not specify that we must escape, but we are to output a JSON string. We can do:\n\n      \"program1\": \"if i == 1:\\n if '1' in s:\\n        first_one = s.index('1')\\n        t = s[first_one:]\\n        if '0' in t:\\n            p = t.index('0')\\n        else:\\n            p = 10**9\\n    else:\\n        first_one = 10**9\\n        p = 10**9\\nif p == 10**9:\\n    continue\\nshift = i-1\\nif shift > p:\\n    continue\\nstart_index = first_one + shift\\nlength = len(t) - p\\nend_index = start_index + length\\nif start_index >= len(s):\\n    continue\\nsubstring = s[start_index:end_index]\\nif substring == '':\\n    continue\\ntry:\\n    num = int(substring, 2)\\nexcept:\\n    num = 0\\ncandidate = s1 | num\\nif candidate > res:\\n    res = candidate\"\n\n      \"program2\": \"x = i\\nbreak\"\n\n      \"program3\": \"return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\n  But note: in program1, the code is indented.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem: Given a binary string s of length n, we must choose two substrings (any two) and compute the bitwise OR of the two numbers they represent (in binary). We then output the maximum possible OR value in binary without leading zeros.\n\nThe provided code:\nn = int(input())\ns = input().strip()\n\ns1 = int('0b'+s,2)\nres = s1\n\nfor i in range(1,8):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nprint(bin(res)[2:])\n\nWe note that the example tests are small, but the constraints go up to n=10^6. The note says that the tests are random with each bit being 1 with probability 1/2.\n\nThe idea:\nWe are to maximize the OR of two numbers from the string. The maximum OR we can get is when we have a substring that is the entire string (which is the maximum number in the string) and then we OR it with another substring that covers all the bits that are 0 in the entire string? However, note that we can choose any two substrings.\n\nBut note: the entire string is one candidate. However, the maximum OR might be achieved by two substrings that together have 1's in every position? Actually, the OR of two numbers will have a 1 in a bit if at least one of the two numbers has a 1 in that bit.\n\nThe maximum OR we can get is a number with all 1's from the first bit of the entire string to the last? But note: the entire string might have leading zeros? Actually, the string is given without leading zeros? Not necessarily: the input string might have leading zeros? The problem says: the string s consists of exactly n characters 0 and/or 1.\n\nHowever, note: if the entire string is zeros, then the maximum OR is 0. But the problem says the string is generated randomly with 1/2 probability, so for large n, it's very likely to have at least one 1.\n\nBut the key is: we want the maximum OR. The maximum OR we can get is a number with as many bits as the entire string? Actually, it might be more? But note: the entire string is the longest representation. However, we can also choose a substring that starts at a position that skips leading zeros? But the entire string might have leading ones? Actually, the entire string is the largest number? But we are allowed two substrings.\n\nObservation: The maximum OR value we can get is a number that has a 1 in every bit from the first 1 to the last? Why? Because we can choose two substrings: one that covers the entire string (so we get the entire string) and then we can choose a substring that covers the zeros? Actually, we can choose two substrings arbitrarily. The best we can do is to have a 1 in every bit from the first 1 to the last? But note: the entire string might not have a 1 in every position.\n\nHowever, we can also choose two substrings that together cover every position? But note: the OR is done bitwise. So if a bit is 0 in the entire string, we can get a 1 in that bit by choosing a substring that has a 1 in that bit? But that substring might be very short? However, we are constrained by the positions.\n\nBut note: we can choose any two substrings. So if there is a 1 at some position, we can choose a substring that is just that 1? Then we get a 1 in that bit? But then we also want the entire string? Actually, we can choose the entire string and then a substring that is a single 1 at a position where the entire string has 0? Then the OR would set that bit to 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum OR we can get is a number that has 1's in every bit from the first 1 to the last? Why? Because the entire string gives us the bits from the first 1 to the last, but if there is a 0 in the entire string, we can set it to 1 by including a substring that has a 1 at that position? However, note: the two substrings are independent. So the OR will have a 1 in a bit if at least one of the two substrings has a 1 in that bit.\n\nTherefore, the maximum OR we can get is a number with 1's in every bit from the first 1 to the last? Actually, we can also set bits beyond the entire string? No, because the entire string is the entire string. The entire string has the most significant bit at the beginning. So the maximum OR must have the same length as the entire string? Or longer? Actually, we can choose a substring that starts at a position that is not the beginning? But then the number of bits is less? So the entire string has the most bits.\n\nBut note: we can choose two substrings that together have 1's in every bit from the first 1 to the last? And that is the entire string? Actually, we can set every bit to 1? So the maximum OR is a string of all 1's? But how many 1's? The entire string has n bits. So the maximum OR would be a number with n bits all set to 1? But that is 2^n - 1? However, we might not be able to set every bit to 1? For example, if the entire string is all 1's, then we don't need to set any extra bit? Then the OR is the entire string? But then we can choose the entire string twice? Then OR is the same? But if there is a 0 in the entire string, we can set it to 1 by having a substring that has a 1 at that position? But note: we can choose a substring that is just the 1 at that position? Then the OR of the entire string and that single 1 will set that bit to 1? So we can set every bit to 1? Therefore, the maximum OR is a string of all 1's of length n? But wait: what if the entire string has a 0 at the beginning? Then we cannot set that bit to 1 by a substring that starts at that position? Because if the substring starts at the beginning, then it would have the same leading 0? But we can choose a substring that does not include the beginning? Then the number of bits is less? So the OR would have a 1 at the beginning? Only if we have a substring that starts at the beginning and has a 1? But if the entire string starts with 0, then we cannot get a 1 at the beginning? Because any substring that starts at the beginning would have a 0? And any substring that does not start at the beginning would have a lower significance? So the first bit (most significant) remains 0? Then the maximum OR would not have a 1 at the beginning? Therefore, the maximum OR is a string of 1's from the first 1 to the last? And then we set every bit from the first 1 to the last to 1? But note: we can set every bit from the first 1 to the last to 1? Because if there is a 0 in between, we can set it by a substring that has a 1 at that position? So the maximum OR is a string of 1's of length (n - first_1_index)? Actually, the entire string from the first 1 to the last is the base, and then we set every bit to 1? So the OR value is a string of 1's of length (n - first_1_index)? But note: the OR might have more bits? Actually, the entire string has the most significant bit at the first_1_index? Then the OR will have the same most significant bit? And then we set every bit to 1? So the maximum OR is a string of 1's of length (n - first_1_index)? But wait: what if we can set a bit beyond the last? No, because the string ends at the last.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm:\n1. If the entire string is zeros, output \"0\".\n2. Otherwise, find the first occurrence of '1'. Let start = index of the first '1'. Then the maximum OR we can get is a number with (n - start) bits all set to 1? Why? Because we can choose the entire string (which gives a number that has the bits from start to the end) and then we can choose a substring that is a single '1' at every position where the entire string has a '0'. Then the OR will set every bit from start to the end to 1? But note: we can do it with two substrings: one is the entire string and the other is a substring that has a 1 at every position that is 0 in the entire string? But we can only choose two substrings. However, we can choose one substring that is the entire string and then one substring that is the entire string? Then the OR is the entire string? That is not optimal. We can choose one substring that is the entire string and then one substring that is a single 1 at a position that is 0? Then the OR sets that one bit? But we have many zeros? We cannot set all zeros with one substring? Unless we choose a substring that has 1's at every zero? But that substring might not exist? And we are limited to two substrings.\n\nBut note: we can choose two substrings arbitrarily. The best is to choose the entire string and then a substring that is the entire string? Then the OR is the entire string? That is not optimal. Alternatively, we can choose two substrings that together have 1's in every position? How? We can choose one substring that is the entire string? Then we have the entire string. Then we can choose a second substring that is the entire string? Then the OR is the entire string? Or we can choose a second substring that is a single 1 at a zero position? Then we set that one bit? But we have many zeros? Then we need to set each zero? We cannot set multiple zeros with one substring? Because one substring can set multiple bits? For example, we can choose a substring that covers multiple zeros? And if that substring has 1's at those positions? Then we set multiple bits? But we are allowed only two substrings. So we can choose:\n  substring1: the entire string -> gives the entire string (which has some 1's and some 0's)\n  substring2: a substring that has 1's at every position that is 0 in the entire string? But such a substring might not exist? However, we can choose any contiguous substring? But we cannot choose a non contiguous substring? So we cannot set two zeros that are separated by a 1? Because a contiguous substring must cover consecutive positions? So if we have two zeros at positions i and j (with i<j) and there is a 1 in between, then we cannot set both zeros with one substring? Because if we choose a substring that covers both zeros, it must cover the 1 in between? Then that substring would have a 1 at the position of the zero? Actually, no: the substring is contiguous, but the positions are fixed. The substring is a contiguous sequence of the string. So if we have a string: \"010\", then we can choose the entire substring \"010\" to set the first and last? But that sets the entire substring? Then the OR of the entire string (which is \"010\") and the entire string again is \"010\". We want to set the first and last? But we can choose a substring that is the entire string? Then we get the entire string? Then we can choose a substring that is the entire string? Then the OR is the entire string? We cannot set the first and last without the middle? But we can choose two substrings: one that is the entire string and one that is the substring of the first character? Then the OR is: \n  entire string: 010 -> 2\n  substring \"0\": 0 -> OR=2 (binary 10) -> which is not 111.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose two substrings: \n  substring1: the entire string: \"010\" -> 2\n  substring2: the last character: \"0\" -> OR=2 (10)\n  or substring2: the last two: \"10\" -> 2 -> OR= 2 OR 2 = 2? \n  or substring2: the first two: \"01\" -> 1 -> OR= 2 OR 1 = 3 (binary 11) -> which sets the first two bits? But the last bit is 0? Then we have 11? But the entire string is 3 bits? Then 11 is 3, which is 011? But we want 111? \n\nSo how do we get 111? We need to set the last bit? We can choose a substring that is the last character? But the last character is 0? Then we cannot set the last bit? So we cannot get 111? Then the maximum OR is 3 (11) for the first two bits? But wait, we can choose two substrings that are not the entire string? For example, we can choose the substring \"01\" (which is 1) and the substring \"10\" (which is 2)? Then OR= 1 OR 2 = 3 (11). Or we can choose the substring \"010\" (2) and the substring \"1\" (the middle) -> 2 OR 1 = 3 (11). \n\nBut note: we can also choose the substring \"0\" and \"1\" and \"0\" -> but we can only choose two. \n\nSo the maximum OR we can get for \"010\" is 3 (11). But 3 in binary is 11? But the entire string is 3 bits? Then we output 11? Without leading zeros? So 11.\n\nBut the example: \nExample 1: s = \"11010\", n=5 -> output \"11111\" (31). \nExample 2: s = \"1110010\", n=7 -> output \"1111111\"? But the example says: choose the substrings \"1110010\" and \"11100\" -> \n  f(\"1110010\") = 114? \n  Actually: \n    \"1110010\" = 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 64+32+16+2 = 114\n    \"11100\" = 1*2^4+1*2^3+1*2^2+0+0 = 16+8+4 = 28\n    114 OR 28 = 114 | 28 = 126? \n    But 126 in binary is 1111110? which is 7 bits? \n    However, the example output is not provided? The note says: \"In the second example, you can choose the substrings 1110010 and 11100.\" -> but what is the output? The problem says: \"print the maximum possible value in binary without leading zeros\".\n\nBut the example output for the first example is 11111 (which is 31). \n\nSo what is the maximum OR for the second example? \nWe can get 127? which is 1111111? How? \n  We can choose the entire string: 1110010 -> 114\n  and then we can choose a substring that has 1's at the positions where the entire string has 0? But the entire string has zeros at positions 4 and 5 (0-indexed from left? or right? Actually, the string is \"1110010\": \n    positions: \n      0: '1'\n      1: '1'\n      2: '1'\n      3: '0'\n      4: '0'\n      5: '1'\n      6: '0'\n  We want to set the bits at positions 3,4,6? \n  We can choose a substring that is the entire string? Then we have 114 (binary 1110010). \n  Then we choose a substring that is the entire string? Then we get the same? OR=114? \n  Or we choose a substring that is \"1111111\"? But that substring does not exist? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose two substrings that together have 1's in every position? \n  substring1: \"1110010\" -> 114 (binary: 1110010)\n  substring2: a substring that covers the zeros? But we cannot cover the zeros at positions 3,4,6 with one contiguous substring? Because they are not contiguous? \n  But note: we can choose two substrings arbitrarily. So we can choose:\n      substring1: the entire string -> 1110010\n      substring2: a substring that covers the zeros at positions 3 and 4? -> that would be the substring starting at position 3 and length 2: \"00\" -> that is 0? Then we don't set any bit? \n      substring2: a substring that covers the zero at position 6? -> the last character is \"0\", so we cannot set it? \n\nBut the example solution: choose \"1110010\" and \"11100\". \n  \"11100\" is the substring starting at 0 and length 5? -> 11100 -> 28 (binary 11100). \n  Then OR: \n      1110010\n    OR  11100   -> we align to the right? \n    Actually, the OR is done on the numbers? So we have:\n        1110010 (114) -> 7 bits\n        11100 (28) -> 5 bits -> we align to the right? \n        So: \n          1110010\n        OR 0011100  -> because we have to align to the right? \n        But that is not contiguous? \n\nWait, the problem says: the substring is contiguous in the original string. The value is the integer represented by the contiguous substring. Then the OR is the bitwise OR of the two integers. \n\nSo for \"1110010\" and \"11100\", we have:\n  1110010 -> 114: binary: 1110010\n  11100 -> 28: binary: 11100 -> which is 0011100 if we represent in 7 bits? \n  Then OR: \n      1110010\n      0011100\n      --------\n      1111110 -> 126.\n\nBut 126 in binary without leading zeros is \"1111110\". \n\nBut the example output? The problem says: \"the binary representation of 31 is 11111\" for the first example. \n\nSo for the second example, the output should be \"1111110\"? \n\nBut the note says: \"In the second example, you can choose the substrings 1110010 and 11100.\" -> so that is one solution, but is it maximum? \n\nHow can we get 127? \n  127 is 1111111. \n  We need two substrings that together have 1's in every bit? \n  The entire string has 7 bits. \n  We need a 1 in every bit? \n  The entire string has 0 at positions 3,4,6 (0-indexed from the left? meaning the 4th,5th, and 7th bits from the left). \n  We need to set bits 3,4,6? \n  We can choose:\n      substring1: the entire string: sets bits 0,1,2,5 -> 1110010\n      substring2: a substring that sets bits 3,4,6? \n          But we cannot have a contiguous substring that sets bits 3,4,6? Because they are not contiguous? \n          We can have two substrings? But we are limited to two substrings total? \n\nActually, we are limited to two substrings. So we can choose two substrings. We can choose:\n  substring1: covers bits 0 to 6? -> the entire string: 1110010 -> sets bits 0,1,2,5 to 1, but not 3,4,6.\n  substring2: must cover the remaining zeros? But we can only choose one more substring. \n      We can choose a substring that covers bits 3,4, and 6? But that is not contiguous? \n      We can choose a substring that covers bits 3 and 4? -> that would be \"00\", which doesn't set any bit? \n      Or a substring that covers bits 3 to 6? -> that is \"0010\", which sets bit 6? but not 3 and 4? \n      Or a substring that covers bits 0 to 4? -> \"11100\" -> sets bits 0,1,2 -> which we already have? \n      Or a substring that covers bits 2 to 4? -> \"100\" -> sets bit 2? \n      Or a substring that covers bits 3 to 5? -> \"001\" -> sets bit 5? \n      Or a substring that covers bits 4 to 6? -> \"010\" -> sets bit 5? \n\nSo we cannot set bits 3 and 4? \n\nTherefore, the maximum OR is 126? which is 1111110? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Calculate the maximum possible value\". \n\nHow do we compute it? \n\nThe known solution for this problem (from CodeForces problems) is:\n\n  Step 1: Remove leading zeros? because they don't matter? \n  Step 2: Let T be the string without leading zeros. Let L = len(T). Then the maximum OR is a string of L ones? \n  But wait: in the first example: \n        s = \"11010\" -> without leading zeros: \"11010\", L=5 -> then the maximum OR would be 11111? which is 31? -> matches.\n  In the second example: \n        s = \"1110010\" -> without leading zeros: \"1110010\", L=7 -> then the maximum OR would be 1111111? which is 127? \n  But we saw that we cannot get 127? \n\nSo what is the catch? \n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from CodeForces Round #766 (Div. 2), problem C) is:\n\n  Let s be the string. \n  Let i0 = s.find('1')\n  If i0 == -1: print(0) and exit.\n  Let t = s[i0:]\n  Then we want to maximize the OR. We note that the first substring should be t (the entire string without leading zeros) because it is the largest number? \n  Then the second substring should be chosen to maximize the OR? \n\n  How to choose the second substring? \n  We note that we can choose any substring. We want to set as many zeros in t as possible? \n  But we can only set a contiguous block of zeros? Actually, we can set a consecutive suffix of zeros? \n\n  The known solution: \n      Let x = the position of the first zero in t? \n      Then we consider the string starting at the first occurrence of a 1 that is followed by a long enough run? \n\n  Actually, the solution in many accepted codes is:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().strip()\n      if '1' not in s:\n          print(0)\n          exit(0)\n      # remove leading zeros\n      s = s[s.index('1'):]\n      # Now, we want to extend the string of ones? \n      # We look for the first zero? \n      if '0' not in s:\n          print(s)\n          exit(0)\n      # Let p = index of the first zero in s\n      p = s.index('0')\n      # Then we consider the base = s\n      # and then we consider a candidate: the OR of s and s shifted by some amount? \n      # Actually, we consider the string t = s[:p]  (which is all ones) and then we want to set the zeros after p? \n      # We consider the starting positions from 0 to p? \n      # Then we form a string: \n      #   candidate = s \n      #   for start in range(0, p+1):\n      #       candidate = max(candidate, OR of s and s[start:start+len(s)]? \n      # But we cannot do that for n=10^6? \n\n  Alternatively, we note that the maximum OR is a string of (len(s)) ones? But we cannot always achieve that? \n\n  But the known solution is:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().strip()\n      if '1' not in s:\n          print(0)\n          exit(0)\n      s = s[s.index('1'):]\n      # find the first zero and then the next ones? \n      if '0' not in s:\n          print(s)\n          exit(0)\n      idx = s.index('0')\n      # the first block of ones is s[:idx]\n      # then we consider the best extension: \n      #   base = s\n      #   we consider a candidate string = base\n      #   for i in range(idx):\n      #       candidate = max(candidate, bin(int(s,2) | int(s[i:i+len(s)-idx+?], 2))[2:]) \n      # But that is O(n) and n=10^6? \n\n  Actually, there is a greedy: \n      Let x = s\n      Let y = s[:idx] + s[idx:] # but we want to set the zeros? \n      Actually, we consider the OR of the base string and a shifted version? \n\n  The known efficient solution:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      s = input().strip()\n      s = s.lstrip('0')\n      if s == '':\n          print(0)\n          exit(0)\n      n = len(s)\n      # find the first zero\n      if '0' not in s:\n          print(s)\n          exit(0)\n      p = s.index('0')\n      # Now, we consider the starting positions in [0, p] (because after p, the first block of ones is broken) and we want to OR the base string with the string starting at one of these positions and of length n? \n      # Actually, we form a candidate string of n ones? \n      # But we cannot always get that? \n      # Instead, we do:\n      #   best = s\n      #   for i in range(p):\n      #       candidate = s \n      #       # we are going to OR the base s with the substring starting at i and of length n? \n      #       # but we can only take the substring from i to the end? \n      #       # but we want to cover the zeros? \n      #       # Actually, we form a string t by ORing s with s[i:i+n] (but we have to extend to n digits? by padding the shifted one to the right? \n      #       # Instead, we form a new string by: \n      #       #   for j in range(n):\n      #       #       if j < len(s[i:]): \n      #       #           bit = s[j] or s[i+j]\n      #       #       else: \n      #       #           bit = s[j]\n      #       #   then candidate = that string? \n      #       # But we want the maximum? \n      #       # We compare lexicographically? \n      #   But n=10^6 and p can be up to 10^6? then O(n^2) -> 10^12 operations? \n\n  There is a better solution: \n      We note that the best candidate must start with the first block of ones? and then we want to extend the ones as much as possible? \n      We let base = s\n      We let candidate = base\n      We let start = 0 to p (the first zero) and then we take the substring starting at start and of length n? \n      But we don't need to try every start? \n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          best = s\n          # We are going to OR the base string with a shifted version that starts at some position in [0, p] and has length n? \n          # But we can only take the substring from start to the end? and then we have to pad with zeros? \n          # Instead, we form a string t = s[0:p]  (the ones) and then we want to OR the rest? \n\n          # We consider the OR of the base string and the string s[i:] for i in [0, p]? \n          # But we can also take a substring of length n? \n\n          # Actually, we can take the substring s[i:i+n] and then OR it with s? \n          # But we want the maximum OR? \n\n          # We can precompute the OR result for a fixed shift? \n\n      However, there is a known solution: \n\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          s = s.lstrip('0')\n          if not s:\n              print(0)\n              exit(0)\n          n = len(s)\n          if '0' not in s:\n              print(s)\n              exit(0)\n          p = s.index('0')\n          # The answer is '1' * (n - p) doesn't work? \n\n      Actually, the known solution from the editorial:\n\n          We let T = s\n          We find the first zero at position p. \n          Then we let X = s[:p]   # the block of ones\n          Then we consider the string starting at positions 0 to p-1 and of length n? \n          But we want to maximize the OR? \n\n          We let candidate = T\n          Then we try to form a string by taking the block X and then ORing the rest with a shifted version? \n\n          Specifically, we let Z = T[p:]   # the rest including the first zero\n          Then we consider for i in range(0, len(X)):\n              # we can take a substring starting at i and of length len(Z) and OR it with Z? \n              # but we want to set as many ones as possible? \n              # We form a string for the suffix: \n              #   for j in range(len(Z)):\n              #       bit = Z[j] or X[i+j]   # but wait, the substring we take is from i to i+len(Z)-1? \n              #   then the whole string is X + (this new string)\n              #   and we compare lexicographically? \n          But that is O(n^2) and n=10^6? \n\n      There is a better way: \n          We note that we want to set the zeros in Z? \n          We consider the OR of Z and the substring of T starting at i and of length len(Z) for i in [0, p]? \n          We want the lexicographically maximum OR? \n\n          But note: the OR might have a 1 at the first position of Z? then we want that? \n\n          We can do: \n              best_suffix = Z \n              for i in range(0, p+1):   # i from 0 to p, but we only need to consider i such that the substring T[i:i+len(Z)] exists\n                  candidate = ''\n                  for j in range(len(Z)):\n                      if Z[j]=='1' or T[i+j]=='1':\n                          candidate += '1'\n                      else:\n                          candidate += '0'\n                  if candidate > best_suffix:\n                      best_suffix = candidate\n              Then the answer is X + best_suffix\n\n          But the length of Z is up to 10^6 and p is up to 10^6? then 10^12 operations? \n\n      We need to optimize: \n\n          We can break early? \n          Or we can use rolling hash? \n\n      Alternatively, we note that we only need to consider one candidate: the OR of Z and the substring starting at the position that has the earliest 1 in a run? \n\n      The known solution in many accepted codes is:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          s = s.lstrip('0')\n          if s == '':\n              print(0)\n              exit(0)\n          n = len(s)\n          if s.count('0') == 0:\n              print(s)\n              exit(0)\n          p = s.find('0')\n          # the first p characters are ones\n          # we want to maximize the suffix starting at p\n          # we consider the string: \n          #   candidate = list(s[p:])\n          #   base = s[p:]\n          #   for i in range(p):\n          #       # consider the substring starting at i of length n-p: s[i:i+n-p]\n          #       # OR it with base?

\n                  # But note: we are allowed to choose only one shift i for the entire substring? \n\n          Therefore, we cannot mix shifts? \n\n      The solution in the editorial: \n\n          Let T = the string without leading zeros.\n          Let L = len(T)\n          If there is no zero in T, then answer = T.\n          Otherwise, let p = first zero index.\n          Then the answer is the string: \n              T[0:p] + ( the OR of the suffixes starting at p and the suffixes starting at positions 0..p-1, but only for the length of the suffix starting at p) \n          And then they say: it is optimal to take the shift i=0? \n          But that is not true: \n              Example: T = \"11010\", then p = 2 (because T[2]=='0')? \n              Then the suffix is \"010\"\n              OR with i=0: substring starting at 0 of length 3: \"110\" -> \n                  010 OR 110 = 110 -> then the whole string becomes \"11\" + \"110\" = \"11110\" -> which is not 11111.\n              OR with i=1: substring starting at 1 of length 3: \"101\" -> \n                  010 OR 101 = 111 -> then the whole string becomes \"11111\", which is better.\n\n          Therefore, we must find the best shift i in [0, p] that maximizes the OR of the suffix.\n\n          How to do it without O(n^2)? \n\n          We can do: \n              Let Z = T[p:]   # length = L - p\n              Let A = [False] * len(Z)   # will become the OR for each position using any shift?\n              But note: we are allowed only one shift for the entire substring.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a greedy: \n              We know that for shift i, the OR string for the suffix is: \n                  OR(i) = [ str(int(T[p+j]) | int(T[i+j])) for j in range(len(Z)) if i+j < len(T) ]\n\n              We want the lexicographically maximum OR(i) over i in [0, p].\n\n          Lexicographical order: we want the first j where OR(i)[j] is 1 and the best is 1? \n\n          We can try to simulate for j=0,1,... until we find a difference? \n\n          We can precompute for each shift i and for each j? -> too expensive.\n\n          Insight: \n              The OR(i) will be 1 at position j if T[i+j]=='1' or T[p+j]=='1'. \n              But note: T[p+j] is the j-th character of the suffix, which is originally in the string.\n\n          We want to find the shift i that maximizes the binary string OR(i). \n\n          We can do: \n              best = None\n              for i in range(0, p+1):\n                  candidate = ''\n                  for j in range(len(Z)):\n                      if i+j < len(T):\n                          if T[i+j]=='1' or T[p+j]=='1':\n                              candidate += '1'\n                          else:\n                              candidate += '0'\n                      else:\n                          candidate += T[p+j]   # if the substring doesn't extend, then only the base?\n                  if best is None or candidate > best:\n                      best = candidate\n              result = T[:p] + best\n\n          But this is O(p * len(Z)) which is O(n^2) and n=10^6 -> 10^12.\n\n      We need a linear solution. \n\n      Another idea: \n          We note that the OR(i) string is determined by the first position j where T[i+j]=='1' and T[p+j]=='0'. \n          Because if for a shift i, at the first position j where T[p+j]=='0', if T[i+j]=='1', then we get a 1 there, and that is better than a shift that has 0 at that position? \n          But lexicographical order: we want the earliest 1 in the string? \n\n          We can try to find the shift i that has the earliest extra 1? \n\n          Specifically, we want the shift i that minimizes the first occurrence where T[i+j]=='0' and we have a chance to set it to 1? -> no.\n\n      Known solution from an accepted code (C++) for the same problem:\n\n          #include <iostream>\n          #include <string>\n          using namespace std;\n          int n;\n          string s;\n          int main() {\n              cin >> n >> s;\n              int pos = 0;\n              while (pos < n && s[pos] == '0') pos++;\n              if (pos == n) {\n                  cout << 0 << endl;\n                  return 0;\n              }\n              string t = s.substr(pos);\n              int p = 0;\n              while (p < t.size() && t[p] == '1') p++;\n              if (p == t.size()) {\n                  cout << t << endl;\n                  return 0;\n              }\n              string ans = t;\n              for (int i = 0; i < p; i++) {\n                  string tmp = t;\n                  for (int j = 0; j < t.size() - p; j++) {\n                      if (t[i + j] == '1') {\n                          tmp[p + j] = '1';\n                      }\n                  }\n                  if (tmp > ans) {\n                      ans = tmp;\n                  }\n              }\n              cout << ans << endl;\n          }\n\n      This is O(p * (n)) which is O(n^2) and might work for n=1000 (tests 11-20) but not for n=10^6.\n\n      But the problem says: tests from 21 to 40 have n=10^6. \n\n      However, the note: \"every character of s is chosen independently of other characters; for each character, the probability of it being 1 is exactly 1/2\"\n\n      This means that the first zero in t (p) is expected to be small? \n\n      Why? Because the probability that the first character is 1 is 1/2, then the next is 1/2, so the probability that the first zero occurs at position k is (1/2)^{k+1}? \n      So the expected value of p is about 2? \n\n      Therefore, in randomly generated strings, p is small (constant on average). \n\n      Therefore, the above O(p * len(Z)) is expected to be O(1 * n) = O(n) and might pass for n=10^6? \n\n      But worst-case, if the string is all ones except the last character, then p = len(t)-1, which is about 10^6, and then the loop is 10^6 * (len(Z)=1) -> 10^6, which is acceptable? \n          len(Z) = n - p = 1, so the inner loop is 1, and the outer loop is p = 10^6 -> 10^6.\n      But if the string is: \n          ones for the first half and then zeros: \n          p = len(t)/2, and len(Z)=len(t)/2, then the total is (len(t)/2) * (len(t)/2) = (n/2)^2 = 25e10 for n=10^6 -> 2.5e11 operations -> too many in Python.\n\n      However, the problem says: tests from 4 to 10: n=5, tests from 11 to 20: n=1000, tests from 21 to 40: n=10^6. \n      And the string is generated randomly with 1/2 for each bit. \n\n      In random strings, the first zero in the string without leading zeros is expected to appear very early? \n          The probability that the first character is 1 is 1/2, then the second is 1 is 1/2, so the probability that the first zero is at position 0 is 1/2, at position 1 is 1/4, at position 2 is 1/8, ... \n          So the expected value of p is sum_{k=0}^{infty} k * (1/2)^{k+1} = 1. \n          So on average, p is about 1 or 2. \n\n      Therefore, the double loop will be on average: \n          outer loop: 1 or 2 iterations.\n          inner loop: about n (which is 10^6) -> 2 * 10^6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n      But worst-case in random strings? \n          The probability that p is large is exponentially small. \n          For example, p>=40 has probability 2^{-40} which is about 1e-12, so in 40 tests, it is very unlikely to happen. \n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          s = s.lstrip('0')\n          if not s:\n              print('0')\n              exit(0)\n          if '0' not in s:\n              print(s)\n              exit(0)\n          p = s.index('0')   # first zero in s\n          base = s\n          # The part that is fixed: the first p characters (which are ones)\n          # The suffix to improve: z = s[p:]   (from the first zero to the end)\n          z = s[p:]\n          best_z = z\n          # We will try shifts i in range(0, p+1): \n          #   We are going to form a string candidate for the suffix by ORing the base suffix (z) with the substring starting at i and of length len(z)\n          #   Specifically: for j in range(len(z)):\n          #         if i+j < len(s) and s[i+j]=='1':\n          #             then at position j we get '1'\n          #         else:\n          #             we leave it as z[j] (which might be '0' or '1')\n          #   But note: if we get a '1' from the shifted substring, then we set it to '1', regardless of z[j].\n          for i in range(0, p+1):\n              # We only need to consider shifts i such that i < len(s) and we can take a substring of length len(z)\n              # But if i+len(z) > len(s), then we can only take up to the end?

Why 8? \n\n      And it starts with res = s1.\n\n      We note that the maximum OR might be achieved by the entire string and one of the shifts? \n\n      But the provided code only has a loop for i in 1..7. \n\n      This suggests that the intended solution might be different. \n\n      Insight: \n          The maximum OR is at least the entire string? \n          And then we can try to OR the entire string with shifted versions? \n          But the shifted versions are limited to 7? \n\n      Why 7? \n          Because the first zero might be within the first 7 ones? \n\n      In fact, the known solution in the editorial might be: \n          We try shifts that are within the first 50 ones? but the problem says the first zero is expected to be within the first few, and 7 might be enough? \n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          # remove leading zeros\n          s_clean = s.lstrip('0')\n          if not s_clean:\n              print(0)\n              exit(0)\n          if '0' not in s_clean:\n              print(s_clean)\n              exit(0)\n          p = s_clean.find('0')\n          # The first p characters of s_clean are ones.\n          # The suffix: z = s_clean[p:]\n          # We try shifts i in the first min(p, 7) ones? \n          # But the given loop is for i in range(1,8) -> 1 to 7.\n\n          However, the given code does not have the above structure. \n\n      Alternatively, the provided code might be:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          s1 = int(s, 2)   # but the given: int('0b'+s,2) -> same as int(s,2) if there are no extra characters? \n          res = s1\n\n          for i in range(1,8):\n              # i might be the length of the shift? \n              # or the start of the shift? \n\n          But we don't have the cleaned string.\n\n      Given the time, and that the intended solution might be to try shifts in the first few (7) positions, we can do:\n\n          # Find the first '1' in the entire string (not cleaning because the entire string might have leading zeros, but the integer conversion removes them? \n          # But the integer conversion does not remove them? because we are using the whole string.\n\n          Actually, the entire string might have leading zeros, then s1 is the integer value of the binary string, which ignores leading zeros? \n          But the problem: the string has exactly n characters. \n\n          Example: s = \"010\", then s1 = int('0b010',2) = 2.\n\n          But then res = 2.\n\n          Then we do a loop for i in range(1,8): \n              # what to do?\n\n          We want to try shifts? \n\n          We can try: \n              for start in range(n):\n                  # but the loop is only 7 times? \n\n          The known solution from the editorial might be: \n              We try to extend the run of ones by at most 7 more bits? \n\n          Given the complexity and the structure, and that the first zero is expected within the first few, we try the shifts in the first 7 positions after the beginning of the string.\n\n          Specifically, we can try:\n\n              # Find the first occurrence of '1' in s: \n              try:\n                  first_one = s.index('1')\n              except:\n                  first_one = n   # no ones\n\n              if first_one == n:\n                  print(0)\n                  exit(0)\n\n              # Then the meaningful part is from first_one to the end: \n              t = s[first_one:]\n\n              if '0' not in t:\n                  print(t)\n                  exit(0)\n\n              p = t.index('0')\n              # Then we try shifts in the range [0, min(p, 7)] \n              best_str = None\n              for i in range(0, min(p, 7)+1):\n                  # form the candidate for the suffix by ORing the base suffix (t[p:]) with the substring starting at i and of length len(t)-p\n                  candidate = []\n                  for j in range(len(t)-p):\n                      if i+j < len(t):\n                          if t[i+j]=='1':\n                              candidate.append('1')\n                          else:\n                              candidate.append(t[p+j])\n                      else:\n                          candidate.append(t[p+j])\n                  candidate_str = ''.join(candidate)\n                  full_candidate = t[:p] + candidate_str\n                  candidate_int = int(full_candidate, 2)\n                  if candidate_int > res:\n                      res = candidate_int\n\n          But then we have to consider that we might also get a larger OR by using two arbitrary substrings? \n\n          However, the maximum OR is at least the entire string, and then we try to OR it with shifted versions? \n\n          But the problem allows any two substrings. The above only considers one particular pair: the entire string and a shifted substring that is used to OR the suffix. \n\n          But note: the first substring is fixed as the entire string? \n          Then the second substring is the shifted substring? \n\n          Then the OR is s1 | int(shifted_string,2)\n\n          And we want the maximum OR over the shifted_string that we can get? \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n              n = int(input())\n              s = input().strip()\n              if '1' not in s:\n                  print(0)\n                  exit(0)\n              s1 = int(s, 2)\n              res = s1\n\n              # find the first '1'\n              first_one = s.index('1')\n              t = s[first_one:]\n\n              if '0' not in t:\n                  # then the OR cannot be improved? \n                  print(t)\n                  exit(0)\n\n              p = t.index('0')\n\n              # We will try shifts i in the range [0, min(p, 7)] \n              for i in range(0, min(p, 7)+1):\n                  # take the substring starting at first_one+i and of length n - first_one - p? \n                  # but we want to cover the suffix of length len(t)-p? \n                  # shifted_string = s[first_one+i: first_one+i+ (len(t)-p)] \n                  # But we might go beyond? \n                  # Instead, we form the OR by: \n                  #   OR_value = s1 | int( s[first_one+i: first_one+i+ (len(t)-p)] , 2)   ? \n                  # But wait, the OR is of two numbers: the entire string and the substring? \n                  #   candidate = s1 | int( s[first_one+i: first_one+i+ (len(t)-p)] , 2)\n                  # But the shifted substring might be short? \n\n                  # But the OR might have more bits than the entire string? \n                  #   Example: s1 = 6 (110), and the substring is 3 (11) -> then OR = 7 (111) -> which has more bits? \n                  #   But the entire string has 3 bits, and the OR might have up to 3 bits? \n                  #   However, the shifted substring might be taken from the middle and then converted to an integer, which is then ORed.\n\n                  # But the OR of two integers is not the same as the OR of the two binary strings aligned at the least significant bit?

\n              If the string is all zeros, then s1 = 0, and then we will print bin(0)[2:] = \"0\", which is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we don't need to handle it separately.\n\n          But the index of '1' in an all-zero string will throw an exception. \n\n          We can do:\n\n              if '1' in s:\n                  first_one = s.index('1')\n                  t = s[first_one:]\n                  if '0' in t:\n                      p = t.index('0')\n                  else:\n                      p = None\n              else:\n                  # then there's no '1', then we skip the for loop?

\n\n  Looking at the usage:\n\n      fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))   -> only two arguments.\n\n      invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])   -> two arguments.\n\n      comb: modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y])) -> nested.\n\n      invcomb: similar.\n\n      invs: modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n      Then in the loop: \n          frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))   -> two arguments.\n          out[i] = modmul(base, frac)   -> two arguments.\n\n      Then in the next loop: \n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))   -> two arguments.\n          out[i] -= oldrem   -> not using modmul.\n\n      And then: \n          rem %= MOD\n          out[i] %= MOD\n\n      But also: \n          oldrem = rem\n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))   -> so modmul returns a number, and we add it to rem.\n\n      The function `modmul` might be defined as (x*y + c) % MOD? \n\n      But the default for c is 0, so when called with two arguments, it is (x*y) % MOD.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n              return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      But wait, in the nested call: \n          modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n          This would be: fact[x] * ( (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y]) % MOD ) % MOD\n\n      But if we do (x*y+c) % MOD, then in the inner modmul we have two arguments, so c=0, so it's (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y]) % MOD.\n\n      Then the outer: (fact[x] * (that result)) % MOD.\n\n      This is the same as: \n          (fact[x] * invfact[y] % MOD * invfact[x-y]) % MOD\n\n      So it is correct.\n\n      However, there is a call with three arguments? \n\n      The only calls we see are with two arguments.\n\n      Therefore, we can define:\n\n          def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n              return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      But note: the multiplication might be of large integers, and we are modulo 998244353.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      However, to avoid overflow during multiplication for large numbers (though Python ints are big, but we want to avoid too big intermediates), we can do:\n\n          return (x * y % MOD + c) % MOD\n\n      But then: \n          (x * y + c) % MOD  is not the same as (x * y % MOD + c) % MOD? \n          They are the same.\n\n      But the specification: (x*y + c) mod MOD.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      But if we are concerned about performance for very large numbers, we can do modular reduction on the product:\n\n          temp = x * y\n          temp %= MOD\n          temp += c\n          temp %= MOD\n          return temp\n\n      However, the problem constraints: n up to 200000, and MAX=10**6, and we are doing factorials up to 10**6, which are within Python's int but the multiplication might be of numbers with 1e6 digits? \n\n      But 10**6! has about 5e6 digits? and multiplying two such numbers is expensive. \n\n      We must do modular multiplication for the factorials? \n\n      But the factorials are computed modulo MOD? \n\n      In the code, we have:\n\n          fact = [1]\n          for i in range(1, MAX):\n              fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n      This is computing factorial mod MOD.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n              # We assume x, y, c are integers, and we want (x*y + c) % MOD\n              return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      But to be safe for the size (to avoid overflow in the intermediate product x*y for numbers up to MOD-1? which is about 1e9, then x*y is about 1e18, which is within Python's int (which is fine for modulo 998244353)), we can do:\n\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      Therefore, we fill the TODO with:\n\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      But note: the function has three parameters, and we use the third.\n\n      We can also do:\n\n          return (x * y) % MOD + c   # then mod again? \n          but then we would do: \n              (x*y) % MOD + c might be >= MOD.\n\n      So we do:\n\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      This is safe.\n\n  Therefore, for program3.py, the missing function body is:\n\n      return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But note: the function is defined with `c=0`, and we use it.\n\n  We output the entire function body? but the TODO is only the body.\n\n  The function is:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with: \n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But we must be careful: the function is called from many places, and we want modular arithmetic.\n\n  This should be correct.\n\n  Let me test with small numbers: \n      modmul(2,3) -> (2*3+0) % MOD = 6 % 998244353 = 6.\n      modmul(2,3,1) -> (2*3+1) % MOD = 7.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Therefore, we output this.\n\n### Summary of the missing code:\n\n  program1: \n      if i == 1:\n          if '1' in s:\n              first_one = s.index('1')\n              t = s[first_one:]\n              if '0' in t:\n                  p = t.index('0')\n              else:\n                  p = 10**9\n          else:\n              first_one = 10**9\n              p = 10**9\n      if p == 10**9:\n          continue\n      shift = i-1\n      if shift > p:\n          continue\n      start_index = first_one + shift\n      length = len(t) - p\n      end_index = start_index + length\n      if start_index >= len(s):\n          continue\n      substring = s[start_index:end_index]\n      if substring == '':\n          continue\n      try:\n          num = int(substring, 2)\n      except:\n          num = 0\n      candidate = s1 | num\n      if candidate > res:\n          res = candidate\n\n  program2:\n      x = i\n      break\n\n  program3:\n      return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But note: the output format is JSON.\n\n  We must output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"completion1\", \"program2\": \"completion2\", \"program3\": \"completion3\"}\n\n  And the completions are the exact code to fill the TODO.\n\n  For program1, the TODO is in a for loop, and we are to replace the TODO with the above block.\n\n  For program2, the TODO is in the for loop, and we replace with two lines: \"x = i\" and \"break\", but we must be careful: the code is in the if block.\n\n  For program3, the TODO is the function body.\n\n  We output the code as a string, and we must escape newlines and quotes? \n\n  But the problem says: Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code.
