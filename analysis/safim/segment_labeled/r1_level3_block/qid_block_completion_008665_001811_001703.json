For program1.py:\nThe missing part is inside the double loop for v1 and v2. We have two cases: when v1 == v2 and when they are different. In the case when v1 == v2, we need to check if there are at least two distinct indices in the list for v1 (so that we can pick two different substrings). We are to pick the smallest two indices (to minimize L1 and then L2) and then compare with the current best (res). We update res if we find a pair with a smaller L1, or same L1 and smaller L2. We note that the current code for the case when v1 ! = v2 is:\n    if len(indices[v1]) > 0 and len(indices[v2]) > 0:\n        res = min(res, (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0]))\n\nSimilarly, for v1 == v2, we need to pick two distinct indices from the same list.

We replace the TODO comment with two lines. However, the problem says: output only the missing code. We output the two lines as a string? But note: the program1 code has an indentation level of 16 (or 12) spaces? We output the same indentation? The problem: we output the code that would replace the TODO. We output:\n\n              program1: \"                candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\\n                res = min(res, candidate)\"\n\n          But the existing code has:\n\n                if len(indices[v1]) > 1:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO comment with two lines, each with 16 (or 12) spaces? The existing code has 16 spaces at the beginning of the line? Actually, the code in the TODO part is inside a for loop and if block. The indentation level is 16? We output the two lines with the same indentation. Alternatively, we output the code exactly as it should appear. We output:\n\n              program1: \"                candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\\n                res = min(res, candidate)\"\n\n          But note: the variable names: we use `v1` and `indices`. For program2, we output: \"                res[i] = -1\"\n\n          For program3, we output: \" c = (c * 2) % 998244353\"\n\n          But note: in program3, the DFS function has:\n\n              if l != r:\n                  # TODO: Your code here And then we have: if l > r:\n                  l, r = r, l\n\n          We want to put the multiplication in the TODO.",

We have two cases: when v1 == v2 and when they are different.\nIn the case when v1 == v2, we need to check if there are at least two distinct indices in the list for v1 (so that we can pick two different substrings). We are to pick the smallest two indices (to minimize L1 and then L2) and then compare with the current best (res). We update res if we find a pair with a smaller L1, or same L1 and smaller L2.\n\nWe note that the current code for the case when v1 != v2 is:\n    if len(indices[v1]) > 0 and len(indices[v2]) > 0:\n        res = min(res, (indices[v1][0], indices[v2][0]))\n\nSimilarly, for v1 == v2, we need to pick two distinct indices from the same list. We want the smallest two (because the list is sorted? note: the indices are collected in increasing order as we iterate from w to n). So we can take the first two.\n\nBut note: the list `indices[v1]` might have more than two, but we only need the smallest two to form the pair (indices[0], indices[1]) because we want to minimize L1 and then L2.\n\nSo the missing code for the v1==v2 case should be:\n    if len(indices[v1]) > 1:\n        candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\n        res = min(res, candidate)\n\nBut note: the variable `res` is being minimized. The min function for tuples compares lexicographically: first element then second.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nMissing code for program1.py in the TODO part:\n                candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\n                res = min(res, candidate)\n\nHowever, note that the list `indices[v1]` is built by appending in increasing order (because we iterate from w to n, and the starting index is i-w+1, which is increasing). So the first element is the smallest, then the next, etc.\n\nBut caution: the problem says: minimize L1 first, then L2. And in the candidate, we have (L1, L2) = (first occurrence, second occurrence) which is the smallest L1 and then the smallest L2 for that L1? Yes, because if we have multiple pairs with the same L1, we take the smallest L2. And the list is sorted by L1 (which is the starting index). So the first two are the two smallest.\n\nSo the code for the TODO in program1.py is:\n                candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\n                res = min(res, candidate)\n\nBut note: the variable `res` is initialized as `INF = (n+1, n)`, which is a tuple. We are comparing tuples. This is valid.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe missing part is in the else branch of the condition: \n    if (r - l) & 1 and arr[l - 1] and arr[r - 1]:\n        if last[(r & 1) ^ 1][xor[r]] >= l:\n            res[i] = (2)\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to set the answer for the query. The condition above checks that the entire segment has an XOR of 0 (because we already checked `xor[r] ^ xor[l-1] != 0` would have set to -1, and then we check the entire segment is non-zero? Actually, we have two conditions above: \n  1. If the XOR of the segment [l, r] is not zero, then set to -1.\n  2. Else if the entire segment is already zeros (pre[r] == pre[l-1]), then 0 operations.\n\nNow, the condition we are in: the segment is non-zero and has XOR 0, but the length (r-l+1) is even? Actually, the condition is: (r-l) is odd? Note: (r-l) is the number of elements minus one. So (r-l) is odd means the segment length (r-l+1) is even.\n\nBut the problem says: we can only choose segments of odd length. \n\nThe note in the problem: \n  In the fifth query: [3,0,3,3,1,2] -> two operations.\n\nThe current condition: \n    elif (r - l) & 1 and arr[l - 1] and arr[r - 1]:\n        if last[(r & 1) ^ 1][xor[r]] >= l:\n            res[i] = (2)\n        else:\n            # TODO\n\nWhat does this condition mean? \n  (r-l) & 1: the length of the segment is even? Actually, (r-l) is the number of gaps, so the length is (r-l+1). Then (r-l) is odd => (r-l+1) is even.\n\nAlso, we check that the first and last elements are non-zero? (arr[l-1] and arr[r-1] are non-zero? because in the array, index l-1 is the first element of the segment, and r-1 is the last).\n\nThe inner condition: \n    if last[(r & 1) ^ 1][xor[r]] >= l\n\nWe have an array `last` which is two dictionaries (for even and odd indices) that store the last occurrence of a prefix XOR value at a particular parity.\n\nBut note: the prefix XOR array is `xor` and we have the entire segment [l, r] has XOR 0, meaning xor[r] ^ xor[l-1] = 0 => xor[r] = xor[l-1].\n\nWe are looking for an index j in [l, r] (with j having the same parity as (r & 1) ^ 1) such that the prefix XOR at j is the same as at r? \n\nActually, the condition in the inner if is: \n    last[(r & 1) ^ 1][xor[r]] >= l\n\nThis means: we are looking for an index j (with parity = (r & 1) ^ 1) such that the prefix XOR at j is xor[r] and j>=l.\n\nBut note: the prefix XOR at j is xor[j] = xor[r]. Then the segment [j+1, r] has XOR 0? Actually, the segment [l, j] would have XOR: xor[j] ^ xor[l-1] = xor[r] ^ xor[l-1] = 0 (because the entire segment [l, r] has XOR 0). \n\nSo we can break the segment [l, r] into [l, j] and [j+1, r]. Both segments have XOR 0? Actually, the entire segment [l, r] has XOR 0, and [l, j] has XOR 0, then [j+1, r] must also have XOR 0.\n\nBut note: the operation requires odd length. We can do two operations: one on [l, j] and one on [j+1, r] if both segments have odd length? Actually, the length of [l, j] is j-l+1, and the parity of j: \n  The parity of j is (r & 1) ^ 1. The entire segment [l, r] has even length. \n  The length of [l, j] = j-l+1, and the length of [j+1, r] = r - j.\n\nWe require both to be odd? \n  j-l+1 is odd? \n  The parity of j: \n      j has parity = (r & 1) ^ 1.\n      The parity of l: we don't know? \n\nBut note: the entire segment [l, r] has even length: \n  (r-l+1) % 2 = 0 => (r-l+1) is even => (r) and (l-1) have the same parity? \n\nActually, the prefix XOR array is built for indices 0..n. The prefix at index j is for the first j elements. \n\nThe condition for the segment [l, j] to have XOR 0: \n  xor[j] ^ xor[l-1] = 0 => xor[j] = xor[l-1] = xor[r] (because the entire segment has XOR 0).\n\nNow, the parity of j: we are storing in `last` by the index j mod 2. \n\nWe are looking for j in the same parity as (r & 1) ^ 1? \n\nBut note: the entire segment [l, r] has even length: \n  (r - (l-1)) is even? Actually, the prefix indices: \n      We have the segment [l, r] corresponds to the XOR from index l to r: which is xor[r] ^ xor[l-1]. \n      The length is r-l+1, which is even. \n      Then the parity of r and l-1: \n          (r) and (l-1) must have the same parity? because the length is even? \n          Actually, the parity of the index in the prefix array: \n          The prefix array index for the segment [l, r] is from l-1 to r. The number of elements is (r - (l-1)) = r-l+1, which is even. \n          Then the parity of r and l-1 must be the same? \n          So r mod 2 = (l-1) mod 2.\n\nTherefore, the parity of j must be (r & 1) ^ 1, which is the opposite of r mod 2. But since l-1 has the same parity as r, then j must have the opposite parity of l-1? \n\nNow, the segment [l, j] has length: j - (l-1) = j - l + 1. \n  We want this to be odd? \n  The parity of j and l-1: \n      j mod 2 = (r mod 2) ^ 1 = (l-1 mod 2) ^ 1 -> so they are different. \n      Then the length j - (l-1) is (j) - (l-1) is an odd number? because the difference of two numbers with different parity is odd. \n      So the segment [l, j] has odd length. Similarly, the segment [j+1, r] has length: r - j, which is (r) - (j). \n      The parity of r and j: r mod 2 and j mod 2 are different? so the length is odd? \n\nTherefore, we can break the even segment into two odd segments that are non-overlapping and consecutive, and both have XOR 0. Then we can do two operations: one for [l, j] and one for [j+1, r]. \n\nBut what if we cannot find such a j? Then we set the answer to -1? \n\nLooking at the code: \n    if last[(r & 1) ^ 1][xor[r]] >= l:\n        res[i] = 2\n    else:\n        # TODO: set to -1? \n\nBut note: the problem says that the entire segment has XOR 0 and is non-zero (so not all zeros). We know that we can do it in one operation if the entire segment is of odd length? But here the segment is even. \n\nHowever, the problem also says: we can do operations on any odd-length contiguous subarray any number of times. \n\nBut the note: the fifth query: [3,0,3,3,1,2] (which is even length) was done in two operations. \n\nBut what if we cannot break it? Then it's impossible? \n\nActually, the problem says: the answer is -1 if it is impossible. \n\nSo in the else branch, we set res[i] = -1? \n\nBut wait: the condition above the inner if: \n    (r-l) & 1 and arr[l-1] and arr[r-1]\n\nThis condition: \n    (r-l) is odd -> segment length is even.\n    and the first and last elements are non-zero.\n\nWhy do we require the first and last elements to be non-zero? \n\nConsider: if the entire segment is [0,0,...,0] then we already handled (0 operations). If the segment has zeros at the ends, we might be able to reduce? \n\nBut the problem: we can only choose odd-length segments. \n\nActually, the solution for the problem is known: \n  If the entire segment is zeros: 0 operations.\n  Else if the XOR of the segment is not 0: -1.\n  Else:\n        if the length is odd: 1 operation (because we can take the entire segment and set to 0).\n        if the length is even:\n            if the first element is 0 or the last element is 0: then we can do 1 operation (by taking the non-zero part? but note: we can take a segment that includes the zero and then the rest becomes zero? Actually, we can break the segment: \n                Example: [0, 1, 1] -> we can take the entire segment? but the entire segment has length 3 (odd) and XOR 0? Actually, [0,1,1] has XOR 0? 0^1^1=0. Then we can do one operation on the entire segment? \n                But the segment [0,1,1] is of length 3 -> one operation.\n\n            However, in our case the segment is even. \n            But if one of the endpoints is zero, then we can remove that zero and the rest becomes an odd-length segment? \n            Example: [0, 1, 2, 3] -> the entire segment has XOR 0? Let me check: 0^1^2^3 = 0? \n            Then we can do: \n                We can take the segment [2,3,4] (if we remove the first zero) but note: the segment [2,3,4] is of length 3? \n                Actually, we can do one operation on the entire segment? but the entire segment is even. \n                Alternatively, we can do: \n                    Operation on [2,4]? but [2,4] is of length 3? (if we consider the indices: the segment from index2 to index4 is three elements). \n                But note: the segment [2,4] is [1,2,3] -> XOR 0? Then we set that segment to 0, and then we have [0,0] -> then we can do an operation on [1,1] (if we consider the zeros) but that would be one element? which is odd. But then we have [0,0,0,0]. \n\n            Actually, the known solution for this problem (from known similar problems) is:\n                If the entire segment is zeros: 0.\n                Else if the XOR is not 0: -1.\n                Else:\n                    if the length is odd: 1\n                    else:\n                         if the first element is 0 or the last element is 0: then 1\n                         else: \n                             if there exists an index j (in the segment) such that the prefix XOR at j is the same as at l-1 (so the segment [l, j] has XOR 0) and the segment [l, j] has odd length? then we can break the segment into two non-overlapping odd segments? and then 2 operations.\n                             else: -1\n\n            But note: the condition for the segment [l, j] to be odd: the length j-l+1 is odd -> the parity of j and l-1 must be the same? because the prefix array: \n                The prefix at j: xor[j] = xor[l-1] (so that the segment [l, j] has XOR 0) and the length is j-l+1, which is odd if and only if (j) and (l-1) have the same parity? \n                Actually, the length = j - (l-1) = j - l + 1 -> the parity is (j) - (l-1) mod 2? \n                The parity of the length is the same as the parity of (j - (l-1))? \n                But note: the parity of the length is (j - (l-1)) mod 2 = (j mod 2 - (l-1) mod 2) mod 2? \n                Actually, the length mod 2 = (j - (l-1)) mod 2 = (j mod 2 - (l-1) mod 2) mod 2? \n                But subtraction mod2 is the same as addition mod2? \n                So: (j - (l-1)) mod 2 = (j + (l-1)) mod 2? \n                Actually, no: because (a-b) mod 2 = (a+b) mod 2? \n                Actually, (a-b) mod 2 = (a+b) mod 2? because 2 mod2=0. \n\n            Therefore, the condition for the segment [l, j] to be odd is: (j + (l-1)) mod 2 = 1.\n\n            But we are storing the prefix array by the parity of the index. We are looking for j such that:\n                xor[j] = xor[l-1] and j mod 2 = (l-1) mod 2? \n                Actually, no: because then the length j-l+1 = (j) - (l-1) would be even? \n                We want odd length -> so we want j mod 2 != (l-1) mod 2? \n\n            But wait: \n                Let x = l-1 mod 2, and j mod 2 = y.\n                Then the length = j - (l-1) = (j) - (l-1). \n                The parity of the length = (j - (l-1)) mod 2 = (j mod 2 - (l-1) mod 2) mod 2? \n                Actually, it's (j + (l-1)) mod 2? because subtraction mod2 is the same as addition? \n                Example: 3-1=2 -> even, 3 mod2=1, 1 mod2=1 -> 1+1=2 mod2=0 -> even -> correct.\n                Example: 3-2=1 -> odd, 3 mod2=1, 2 mod2=0 -> 1+0=1 mod2=1 -> odd -> correct.\n\n            Therefore, the length mod2 = (j + (l-1)) mod2. \n            We want odd length -> so (j + (l-1)) mod2 = 1.\n\n            Now, the entire segment [l, r] has even length: \n                (r - (l-1)) mod2 = (r + (l-1)) mod2 = 0 -> so r mod2 = (l-1) mod2.\n\n            Then for the segment [l, j] to be odd: \n                (j + (l-1)) mod2 = 1 -> j mod2 = 1 - (l-1) mod2 = 1 - (r mod2) = (r mod2) ^ 1.\n\n            So we are looking for j with j mod2 = (r mod2) ^ 1 and j>=l and j in the range [l, r-1] (because we break at j, then the next segment is [j+1, r]) and such that xor[j] = xor[l-1] = xor[r].\n\n            This is exactly what the condition in the inner if checks: \n                last[(r & 1) ^ 1][xor[r]] >= l\n\n            So if we find such a j, we set the answer to 2. Otherwise, we set to -1? \n\n            But note: the condition above the inner if also requires that the first and last elements are non-zero. Why?\n\n            Because if the first element is zero, then we can do one operation: \n                We can remove the first element (which is zero) and then the rest [l+1, r] is of odd length? \n                The length of the entire segment is even, so if we remove the first element, the rest has length (r-l) which is odd? \n                Then we can do one operation on [l+1, r] (which is odd and has XOR 0? because the entire segment has XOR 0 and the first element is 0, so the rest must have XOR 0). \n                Then we set [l+1, r] to 0, and then we have [0,0,...,0] (the first element was already 0). \n                So one operation.\n\n            Similarly, if the last element is zero, we can remove the last element and do one operation on [l, r-1] (which is odd length and has XOR 0).\n\n            Therefore, the condition: \n                if the entire segment has XOR 0 and even length, then:\n                    if the first element is zero OR the last element is zero: then 1 operation.\n                    else: \n                         if we can break the segment into two non-overlapping odd segments (by finding an index j in the middle with the same prefix XOR and the required parity) then 2 operations.\n                         else: -1.\n\n            But in the code, we have:\n                elif (r - l) & 1 and arr[l - 1] and arr[r - 1]:\n                    ...   # meaning: the segment is even and the first and last are non-zero.\n\n            Then we check for the break. \n\n            What about the case when the segment is even and the first element is zero? \n                Then we fall into the else: \n                    else: \n                        res[i] = 1\n\n            How? \n                The conditions above:\n                    if xor[r]^xor[l-1]!=0: -1\n                    elif pre[r]==pre[l-1]: 0\n                    elif (r-l)&1 and arr[l-1] and arr[r-1]: ... (this is the even and both ends non-zero)\n                    else: 1\n\n            So the else branch sets to 1 for the even segment that has XOR0 and at least one end is zero.\n\n            Therefore, in the TODO part, we set to -1? \n\n            So the missing code is:\n                res[i] = -1\n\nBut note: the condition above the inner if: \n    if last[(r & 1) ^ 1][xor[r]] >= l: \n        res[i] = 2\n    else:\n        res[i] = -1\n\nBut wait, the code already sets to 2 in the inner if. So the else branch should set to -1.\n\nTherefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n                res[i] = -1\n\nBut note: the problem says: the answer is -1 if it is impossible.\n\nSo we set to -1.\n\nFor program3.py:\nThe problem: count the number of distinct preorder strings of a perfect binary tree of height n (with 2^n-1 nodes) when we can swap the children arbitrarily at any non-leaf node.\n\nThe current code:\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input()\n    c = 1   # global count\n\n    def dfs(i):\n        if i >= 2**(n-1)-1:   # note: the leaves start at index 2**(n-1)-1? Actually, the tree has 2^n-1 nodes. The root is at index0? \n            return s[i]        # But the problem: the root has index1? but the code uses 0-indexed array.\n\n        global c\n        l = dfs(2*i+1)\n        r = dfs(2*i+2)\n        if l != r:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if l > r:\n            l, r = r, l\n        return s[i] + l + r\n\n    dfs(0)\n    print(c % 998244353)\n\nThe idea: \n  We traverse the tree in DFS (preorder). \n  For a leaf, we return the string of the single character.\n  For an internal node, we get the preorder strings of the left and right children.\n\n  Then, we have the possibility to swap the children. The operation allows swapping arbitrarily. Therefore, for a node, we can choose the order of the two children arbitrarily. \n\n  The preorder string for the node is: s[i] + (the preorder string of the left child) + (the preorder string of the right child) OR s[i] + (the preorder string of the right child) + (the preorder string of the left child).\n\n  But note: the problem asks for the number of distinct preorder strings.\n\n  The DFS function returns the preorder string of the subtree rooted at i. However, the problem constraints: n up to 18, but the string length is 2^n-1 which is 2^18-1 = 262143, and the total number of nodes is 2^18-1, so building the entire string is too expensive.\n\n  Instead, we can use a hashing or a canonical representation? \n\n  The known solution: \n      We use dynamic programming and count the distinct representations.\n\n  The variable `c` is the global count of distinct trees? \n\n  How does the count work?\n      The idea: \n          For a node, if the two children have the same representation, then swapping doesn't change the representation. So we have only one representation for this node.\n          If the two children have different representations, then we have two possible representations: \n              representation1 = s[i] + l + r\n              representation2 = s[i] + r + l\n\n          But note: the entire tree representation is built from the root. The distinct representations of the entire tree is the product of the number of choices at each node? \n\n          However, the representations of the children might be different and the choices at different nodes are independent? \n\n          But note: the representation of a node depends on the representations of its children. And the children's representations are also affected by the swaps in their subtrees.\n\n          The known solution: \n              We define a function that returns a canonical representation of the subtree (so that two subtrees that are the same under any sequence of swaps have the same canonical representation). \n\n          However, the problem asks for the number of distinct representations. \n\n          The known approach: \n              We can use a DP that returns a pair (min_string, max_string) for the subtree? but the string is too long.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a hashing that is commutative for the two children? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for this problem (from similar problems) is:\n\n              We define a function f(u) that returns a tuple (a, b) where:\n                  a = the canonical representation of the subtree when we do not swap at u? \n                  b = the canonical representation of the subtree when we swap at u? \n                  But then we want to know the distinct representations.\n\n          But note: the problem allows any number of swaps arbitrarily. Therefore, for a node, we can choose the order arbitrarily. So the representation of the node is s[i] + min(f(l), f(r)) + max(f(l), f(r))? \n\n          Actually, we can force a canonical representation: \n              We define a canonical form for the subtree: \n                  For a leaf: the string is the character.\n                  For an internal node: \n                      Let left = f(left_child)\n                      Let right = f(right_child)\n                      Then we can choose the order arbitrarily. So we set:\n                         canonical = s[i] + min(left, right) + max(left, right)\n\n          Then the entire tree is represented by the canonical form at the root.\n\n          But then the distinct representations is the number of distinct canonical forms? \n\n          However, the problem: the operations are independent at each node. The entire tree representation is determined by the canonical form at the root. \n\n          But note: the canonical form at a node is built from the canonical forms of the children. \n\n          How to count the distinct representations? \n              We can use memoization: for a node, the canonical representation is unique. Then the entire tree representation is the canonical representation of the root.\n\n          Then the number of distinct representations is the number of distinct canonical representations at the root? \n\n          But the problem: we are allowed to do any number of swaps arbitrarily. Then the representation of the entire tree is the canonical representation we defined. \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n              memo = {}\n              def dfs(i):\n                  if i is leaf: \n                      return s[i]\n                  left = dfs(2*i+1)\n                  right = dfs(2*i+2)\n                  # We can swap arbitrarily, so we form the canonical representation: \n                  if left > right:\n                      left, right = right, left\n                  rep = s[i] + left + right\n                  # But we want to count the distinct representations? \n                  # Actually, we are building the representation. \n\n          However, the problem: the string is too long. We cannot build the entire string.\n\n          Alternative: we can use hashing? \n\n          But note: the problem asks for the count, not the representation.\n\n          The known solution: \n              We use a DP that maps a representation to a count? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n              We define a function that returns a hash of the canonical representation. And we use a dictionary to count distinct hashes? \n\n          However, the problem: the total number of nodes is 2^n-1, which is 2^18-1 = 262143, which is acceptable? But the string at the root is of length 2^n-1, which is 262143, and we are building it? That would be 2^n * (2^n) which is 2^(2n) which is 2^36, which is too big.\n\n          We need a more efficient way.\n\n          Insight: \n              The structure of the tree is fixed. The representation of a node is determined by the character at the node and the representations of the two children (in sorted order). \n\n          We can use memoization by the subtree structure? \n\n          We can do:\n\n              memo = {}\n              def dfs(i):\n                  if i is leaf:\n                      return s[i]   # but we cannot use the string for memo because the string is long? \n                  left = dfs(2*i+1)\n                  right = dfs(2*i+2)\n                  if left > right:\n                      left, right = right, left\n                  rep = (s[i], left, right)   # a tuple of the char and the two representations (which are also tuples for non-leaves)\n                  if rep in memo:\n                      return memo[rep]\n                  # But we want to count distinct representations? \n\n          Actually, we are not counting the distinct representations per se, but the entire tree: the root representation is the entire string. \n\n          The problem: the number of distinct entire strings.\n\n          How does the swapping at different nodes affect the entire string? \n              The choices at different nodes are independent. Therefore, the total number of distinct representations is the product over the nodes of the number of distinct representations at that node? \n\n          But note: the representation of a node depends on the representations of the children. \n\n          However, if two different choices of swaps lead to the same string, then we count as one.\n\n          The known solution: \n              We use a DP that for each node, we compute the set of representations? but the set might be too big.\n\n          Alternatively, we note:\n\n              The representation of a node is: \n                  rep = s[i] + min(rep_left, rep_right) + max(rep_left, rep_right)\n\n              Then the representation of the entire tree is the representation of the root.\n\n          Then the distinct representations of the entire tree is the distinct representations of the root.\n\n          How to count without building the entire string? \n              We can use hashing with a modulus? but then we have to avoid collisions.\n\n          But note: the modulus is 998244353, and the problem asks for the count modulo 998244353.\n\n          The known solution (from known problems) is:\n\n              We use a DFS that returns a hash of the canonical representation. And we use a dictionary to count the distinct hashes at the root? \n\n          However, the problem: we are not asked for the distinct representations of every subtree, but the entire tree. And we are to count the distinct entire tree representations.\n\n          But note: the entire tree representation is the representation of the root. \n\n          How to count? \n              We can do:\n\n                  memo = {}\n                  def dfs(i):\n                      if i is leaf:\n                          return s[i]   # but we want to avoid building long strings? \n                      left = dfs(2*i+1)\n                      right = dfs(2*i+2)\n                      if left > right:\n                          left, right = right, left\n                      rep = s[i] + left + right\n                      # But rep is a string that might be long.\n\n          The total memory: the number of nodes is 2^n-1, which is 262143, but the total length of all representations is the sum of the lengths of the representations at each node. The representation at a node at depth d has length (2^(n-d)-1). The total sum is O(2^n) per level? and the total is O(2^(2n))? which is 2^36, which is about 68 GB of memory? \n\n          We need a better way.\n\n          We can use a hashing function that is recursive. \n\n          Let base and mod for hashing. \n\n          We define:\n              For a leaf: \n                  hash = (ord(s[i]), )\n              For an internal node:\n                  left_hash = dfs(2*i+1)\n                  right_hash = dfs(2*i+2)\n                  if left_hash > right_hash:\n                      swap them\n                  Then the hash for the node: \n                      h = (ord(s[i]), left_hash, right_hash)\n\n          Then we can use memoization on the tuple (ord(s[i]), left_hash, right_hash). \n\n          But note: the problem: the entire tree representation is the entire string. The hash we compute is a structural hash. \n\n          Then the distinct representations at the root are the distinct hashes at the root.\n\n          But the problem: we are to count the number of distinct entire strings. \n\n          How? \n              We do a DFS and for each node, we compute a hash that represents the entire subtree. Then we count the distinct hashes at the root? \n\n          However, the problem: the root representation is the entire string. The entire tree representation is the entire string. \n\n          But note: the entire tree representation is determined by the root's representation. \n\n          Therefore, the number of distinct representations is the number of distinct hashes at the root.\n\n          But wait: the problem: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. Therefore, the representation of a subtree is defined by the canonical form: \n              rep(node) = (s[i], min(rep(left), rep(right)), max(rep(left), rep(right)))\n\n          Then we can compute a hash for the canonical representation. \n\n          We can do:\n\n              mod = 998244353   # but we are not using mod for the count of distinct representations? we are using mod for the answer? \n              base = 131\n              # But we are not hashing the string, we are hashing the structure.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a dictionary to map the tuple (s[i], left_rep, right_rep) to a unique id. \n\n          Steps:\n\n              memo = {}\n              id_counter = 0\n              def dfs(i):\n                  nonlocal id_counter\n                  if i is leaf:\n                      # We return an id for the representation of the leaf: which is just the character? \n                      # But two leaves with the same character should have the same id.\n                      rep = s[i]\n                      if rep not in memo:\n                          memo[rep] = rep   # but we want an id? \n                      Actually, we can return a tuple (s[i],) for the leaf? \n                  else:\n                      left = dfs(2*i+1)\n                      right = dfs(2*i+2)\n                      if left > right:\n                          left, right = right, left\n                      rep = (s[i], left, right)\n                      if rep in memo:\n                          return memo[rep]\n                      else:\n                          id_counter += 1\n                          memo[rep] = id_counter\n                          return id_counter\n\n          But then the entire tree representation is the id at the root. \n\n          How to count the distinct representations? \n              We are not counting, we are assigning an id per distinct canonical representation.\n\n          But the problem: we are to output the number of distinct representations for the entire tree? \n\n          Actually, the entire tree has one representation per distinct canonical representation at the root. \n\n          But note: the problem: the entire tree representation is the entire string. The entire string is determined by the canonical representation at the root. \n\n          Therefore, the number of distinct representations is the number of distinct canonical representations at the root. \n\n          How to count? \n              We can do a DFS and then count the distinct root representations? \n\n          But the problem: we are not storing the entire tree representation, we are storing an id per distinct subtree representation. \n\n          Then the entire tree representation is the id of the root. \n\n          Then the number of distinct entire tree representations is the number of distinct root ids? \n\n          But we are building the tree: we do one DFS. \n\n          Actually, we are not counting the number of distinct representations that can be obtained by swapping, but we are building one representation per distinct structure. \n\n          However, the problem: the operations allow any number of swaps. Then the entire tree representation is uniquely determined by the canonical representation we defined. \n\n          Therefore, the entire tree has one representation per distinct canonical representation at the root. \n\n          But note: the problem: we are to count the number of distinct strings that can be obtained. \n\n          How does the DFS help? \n              We are building the canonical representation for the entire tree. \n\n          But the count: \n              We are not counting the number of distinct representations, we are building one representation per distinct structure. \n\n          Actually, the DFS we are doing is for the fixed tree. We are not exploring the choices? \n\n          The known solution: \n              We use a DFS that returns the canonical representation of the subtree. And we use a dictionary to count the distinct representations at the root. \n\n          But note: the problem: the tree is fixed. The only choices are the swaps. \n\n          The DFS we are doing is for the fixed tree without swapping? \n\n          How to account for the swaps? \n              The DFS we are doing is: \n                  We always return the canonical representation: we sort the children representations. \n\n          Therefore, the representation we return is the one that would be obtained by swapping if necessary to get the lexicographically smallest first. \n\n          Then the entire tree representation is fixed: the canonical one. \n\n          But wait: the problem: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. Then we can get two different representations for the same subtree? \n\n          Actually, no: because we are defining the canonical representation by sorting the children. \n\n          Then the entire tree representation is the canonical representation. \n\n          Therefore, there is only one representation per distinct structure? \n\n          But note: the problem: the operations allow us to choose independently at each node. However, the entire string is determined by the canonical choices at every node. \n\n          Therefore, the distinct representations are in one-to-one correspondence with the distinct canonical representations of the entire tree. \n\n          How to count the distinct representations? \n              We do a DFS that builds the canonical representation for the entire tree. But we are not storing the entire string, we are storing an id per distinct subtree. \n\n          Then the number of distinct representations for the entire tree is the number of distinct root representations? \n\n          But the problem: the entire tree representation is the entire string. And we are not storing the entire string. \n\n          We are storing an id per distinct subtree representation. \n\n          Then the number of distinct root representations is the number of distinct ids that appear at the root? \n\n          But we are not storing multiple trees. We are storing one tree. \n\n          Actually, we are traversing one tree. \n\n          The known solution: \n              We use a DFS that for each node, returns a hash (or an id) for the canonical representation of the subtree. \n              Then the entire tree has one id at the root. \n              But the problem: the number of distinct entire tree representations is the number of distinct root ids that can be obtained from the fixed tree by swapping? \n\n          How can we get multiple representations from the fixed tree? \n              We cannot. The fixed tree with the possibility of swapping at each node leads to a set of representations. \n\n          But note: the problem: we are allowed to perform any number of swaps arbitrarily. Then the set of representations we can get is exactly the set of representations that can be formed by independently choosing at each node the order of the children. \n\n          However, the entire tree representation is determined by the choices at every node. \n\n          How to count the distinct representations? \n              We cannot generate all because there are 2^(number of internal nodes) which is 2^(2^(n-1)-1) which is huge.\n\n          Insight: \n              The representation of a node is: \n                  rep = s[i] + min(rep_left, rep_right) + max(rep_left, rep_right)   [if we choose the swap to get the lex order]\n              But if we do not swap, we get s[i] + rep_left + rep_right, and if we swap, we get s[i] + rep_right + rep_left.\n\n              However, if rep_left == rep_right, then swapping doesn't change the representation. \n\n              If rep_left != rep_right, then we have two different representations for the subtree rooted at the node: \n                  rep1 = s[i] + rep_left + rep_right\n                  rep2 = s[i] + rep_right + rep_left\n\n              But note: the entire tree representation is built from the root. The choice at the root and the choices in the children matter.\n\n          The known solution (from Codeforces problems) for \"A. Perfectly Balanced String\" or similar: \n              We use a DFS that returns a canonical representation (as a tuple) and then we count the distinct representations at the root? \n\n          But the problem: we are not counting the distinct representations of the subtrees, but the entire tree. \n\n          Actually, the entire tree representation is the representation of the root. \n\n          How to count the distinct representations of the entire tree? \n              The distinct representations of the entire tree is the number of distinct representations of the root. \n\n          How to compute the representation of the root? \n              We have to consider that at each node, if the two children have different representations, then we have two possibilities. \n\n          Therefore, the total number of distinct representations is the product over the nodes of (if the two children have the same representation then 1, else 2). \n\n          But wait: is that true? \n              Consider: \n                  Let the root have two children. The left child has two representations: A and B (because in the left child's subtree, there was a choice that led to two representations). The right child has two representations: C and D. \n                  Then the root has: \n                      without swap: \n                          root_char + A + C\n                          root_char + A + D\n                          root_char + B + C\n                          root_char + B + D\n                      with swap:\n                          root_char + C + A\n                          root_char + D + A\n                          root_char + C + B\n                          root_char + D + B\n\n                  But note: if A and C are different, then root_char+A+C and root_char+C+A are different? \n\n                  Therefore, the total number of representations for the root is 4 (from the left) * 4 (from the right) = 16? \n\n          But the choices are independent? \n\n          Actually, the representation of the entire tree is built by the choices at every node. The total number of choices is 2^(number of internal nodes with distinct children). \n\n          But then the distinct representations might be less than that because two different choices might lead to the same string.\n\n          The known solution: \n              We use a DFS that returns a sorted tuple (min_rep, max_rep) for the representations of the subtree? \n\n          But the known solution in the code we are given uses a global variable `c` that is multiplied by 2 whenever a node has two children with different representations. \n\n          How? \n              The DFS in the given code:\n\n                  c = 1\n                  def dfs(i):\n                      global c\n                      if leaf: return s[i]\n                      left = dfs(2*i+1)\n                      right = dfs(2*i+2)\n                      if left != right:\n                          c *= 2   # because at this node, we have two choices? \n                      if left > right:\n                          left, right = right, left\n                      return s[i] + left + right\n\n          Then at the end, we output c mod 998244353.\n\n          But note: the DFS returns the canonical representation (by sorting the children). The global variable `c` counts the total number of distinct entire tree representations? \n\n          Why? \n              Because at each node where the two children have different representations, we have two choices (swap or not) that lead to two different representations for the entire tree? \n\n          But wait: \n              The representation of the entire tree is the entire string. The entire string is built by the DFS return value at the root. \n              However, the DFS return value is the canonical representation (with the children sorted). \n\n          How does the multiplication by 2 account for the distinct representations? \n              The key: the distinct representations of the entire tree is the product over the nodes of the number of distinct representations that can be produced at that node given the representations of the children. \n\n          For a node, if the two children have the same representation, then swapping doesn't change the representation -> factor 1.\n          If the two children have different representations, then swapping gives a different representation for the entire subtree rooted at this node? \n\n          But note: the representation of the entire subtree rooted at this node is s[i] + (child1) + (child2) OR s[i] + (child2) + (child1). And these two are different. \n\n          And the choices at different nodes are independent. \n\n          Therefore, the total number of distinct representations is 2^(number of nodes with distinct children).\n\n          But the given code does:\n\n              if left != right:\n                  c *= 2\n\n          And then returns the canonical representation (by sorting the children). \n\n          Why is that? \n              The DFS is only used to build the canonical representation for the children, but the multiplication by 2 is done whenever the two children are different, regardless of the entire subtree. \n\n          And the product is over the entire tree. \n\n          Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n              c *= 2\n\n          But note: we must do modulo 998244353? \n              The given code: \n                  print(c % 998244353)\n\n          So we do:\n\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353   ?\n\n          But the code does not do modulo in the multiplication. We can do modulo at the end? but the number of nodes is at most 2^(n-1)-1, which is 2^17-1 = 131071, and 2^131071 is huge. \n\n          We should do modulo at every multiplication.\n\n          But the problem: the multiplication is done in the DFS. \n\n          We can change the global c to be modulo at every step.\n\n          However, the given code does not do that. \n\n          But the problem: the output is c mod 998244353. \n\n          We can do:\n\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353\n\n          But the initial c=1, and then we multiply by 2 for every node that has distinct children. \n\n          The DFS is recursive. \n\n          Therefore, the missing code in program3.py is:\n\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353\n\n          However, the problem: the modulus is 998244353, and we are to output the number mod 998244353.\n\n          But note: the multiplication might be huge. We should do modulo at every step.\n\n          But the given code does not do modulo in the multiplication. We can do:\n\n              global c\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353\n\n          But the variable c is an integer. The number of nodes with distinct children is at most 2^(n-1)-1, which is 131071, and 2^131071 is astronomically huge. We must do modulo.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353\n\n          But the problem: the modulus is 998244353, and we are allowed to do modulo.\n\n          However, the given code prints c % 998244353 at the end. But if we do not do modulo during the multiplication, c might be too big and cause overflow. \n\n          Therefore, we should do modulo at every multiplication.\n\n          But the problem: the multiplication is by 2 for each node. The total number of multiplications is the number of nodes with distinct children, which is at most 131071. We can do:\n\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353\n\n          So the missing code is:\n\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353\n\n          But note: the problem: the entire tree might have many nodes. \n\n          However, the DFS is over the entire tree. The number of nodes is 2^n-1. \n\n          We are only multiplying by 2 at the nodes that are not leaves and that have distinct children representations.\n\n          But the leaves: we don't multiply. \n\n          So the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n              c = (c * 2) % 998244353\n\n          But note: the DFS function does not return the representation for the leaf? It returns the character. For the internal node, it builds the representation by concatenation. But we are not using the representation for counting the distinct representations of the entire tree? We are using the product of 2's. \n\n          Why is the product of 2's the answer? \n              Because at each node with distinct children, we have two choices: swap or not. And these choices are independent. And each choice leads to a distinct entire tree representation? \n\n          But note: it is possible that two different choices at different nodes might lead to the same entire tree representation? \n\n          However, the known solution in Codeforces for the same problem (for example, problem C in a contest) uses this method. \n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n              program1: the missing code: \"candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\\n                res = min(res, candidate)\"\n              program2: the missing code: \"res[i] = -1\"\n              program3: the missing code: \"c = (c * 2) % 998244353\"\n\n          But note: the code for program1 is in a comment block? We must output the exact code that goes in the TODO.\n\n          For program1, the code is two lines? But the existing code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then the else branch for v1==v2. We replace the TODO comment with two lines.\n\n          However, the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n          We output the two lines as a string? \n\n          But note: the program1 code has an indentation level of 16 (or 12) spaces? We output the same indentation? \n\n          The problem: we output the code that would replace the TODO. \n\n          We output:\n\n              program1: \"                candidate = (indices[v1][0], indices[v1][1])\\n                res = min(res, candidate)\"\n\n          But the existing code has:\n\n                if len(indices[v1]) > 1:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO comment with two lines, each with 16 (or 12) spaces? \n\n          The existing code has 16 spaces at the beginning of the line? \n\n          Actually, the code in the TODO part is inside a for loop and if block.
