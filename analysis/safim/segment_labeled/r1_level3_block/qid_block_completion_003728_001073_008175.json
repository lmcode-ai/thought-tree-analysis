Then we form: 5 and the next two smallest: 2 and 3? Then we remove 3 players: 5,2,3? Then we have 4 left? Then we break? But wait: after removing 10 and 1, we have [5,4,3,2] (but sorted descending: [5,4,3,2]). Then we process x=5: k= (10//5)+1=3 -> we remove 5 and the two smallest: 2 and 3? Then we have 4 left? Then we process x=4: k= (10//4)+1 = 2+1=3 -> but we only have 1 player? -> break. So wins=2. But is that optimal? Team1: [10,1] -> becomes [10,10] -> 20>10 -> win.\n            Team2: [5,2,3] -> becomes [5,5,5] -> 15>10 -> win. Then we have [4] -> cannot form a team (needs k= (10//4)+1=3 players) -> so 2 wins. Alternatively, we could form:\n            Team1: [10,5] -> becomes [10,10] -> 20>10 -> win. Then we have [4,3,2,1]. Then for 4: k= (10//4)+1=3 -> form a team: [4,3,1] -> becomes [4,4,4] -> 12>10 -> win. Then we have 2 -> cannot form a team -> wins=2. So 2 wins is the maximum. Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n            n, d = map(int, input().split())\n            p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            p.sort(reverse=True)\n            available = n\n            wins = 0\n            for x in p:\n                k = (d // x) + 1\n                if available < k:\n                    break\n                wins += 1\n                available -= k\n            print(wins)\n\n        But note: the current code has:\n\n            temp = n   # available\n            ans = 0\n            for x in sorted(p, reverse=True):\n                if temp >= ((d//x)+1):\n                    # TODO: Your code here So we can write:\n\n            ans += 1\n            temp -= (d//x)+1\n\n        However, note: the condition is already checked. So:\n\n            if temp >= ((d//x)+1):\n                ans += 1\n                temp -= (d//x)+1\n\n        But note: the variable `x` is the current player. We use `(d//x)+1` as k.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            ans += 1\n            temp -= (d // x) + 1\n\n        But note: integer division in Python: d//x is floor division. This matches our requirement. However, what if x is very small? Then k = (d//x)+1 might be huge? But we break when temp < k. So it's safe. Let's test with the example: n=6, d=10, p=[5,10,5,5,5,5] -> but wait, the example in the note: \n            Input: \"6 180\\n90 80 20 100 90 10\" -> output 2. How does our algorithm work for that example?\n\n            p = [100, 90, 90, 80, 20, 10] (sorted descending)\n            available = 6\n            wins=0\n\n            x=100: k = (180//100)+1 = 1+1=2 -> available=6>=2 -> wins=1, available=4.\n            x=90: k = (180//90)+1 = 2+1=3 -> available=4>=3 -> wins=2, available=1. x=90: k=3 -> available=1<3 -> break. So wins=2 -> matches. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            ans += 1\n            temp -= (d // x) + 1\n\n        But note: the condition is already in the if. So we just add these two lines. For program2.py:\n The problem is about placing half-queens on an n x n board so that every cell is attacked. We are to output the minimum number k and then k positions. The provided code has:\n\n    if n <= 2:\n        k = 1\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (1, 1)))) elif n == 3:\n        k = 2\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (1, 1))))\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (1, 2))))\n    else:\n        for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n            if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        z = 1\n        for i in range(x):\n            ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n        z += x\n        x += 1\n        for i in range(x):\n            ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n        z += x\n        for i in range((n - 2) % 3):\n            ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + (n - 2) % 3 - i - 1, z + i))))\n        k = len(ans) The idea for the problem: \n   Known: the minimum number of half-queens is ceil(2*n/3). How to construct? We break the board into three parts. We place the half-queens in two diagonals that cover the board. The provided code in the else part (for n>=4) is trying to find an x such that 3*x+2 <= n. Then it does:\n\n        z = 1\n        for i in range(x):\n            ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )   # this is a diagonal: from (x,1) to (1,x) ? Then z += x\n        Then x += 1\n        Then for i in range(x):   # now x is the old x+1\n            ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )   # then z is x+1, so the next diagonal: from (x+ (x+1)-1, x+0) to (x+0, x+(x+1)-1) -> that is (2*x, x) to (x, 2*x) ? Then z += x   (so z becomes x + (x+1) = 2*x+1) Then for i in range((n-2)%3):\n            ... But note: the variable x is not defined in the code after the TODO. We must set x in the TODO. The problem: we are to set x to the largest integer i such that 3*i+2 <= n? Then we use that x.\n\n     Actually , the for-loop:\n\n        for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n            if 3*i+2 <= n:\n                # then we set x = i and break\n\n        Then we break out of the loop? But we are in a for-loop. We can break? Or we set x and break. So the TODO part:\n\n        x = i\n        break\n\n     Then we proceed to place two diagonals: the first of length x and the second of length x+1. Then we place an extra diagonal of length (n-2)%3? But note: the total number of half-queens should be about 2*n/3. However, note: the known solution for this problem:\n\n        k = (2*n+2)//3   (ceiling of 2n/3)\n\n        How to place? Let m = (2*n+2)//3\n          Then we place:\n            for i in range(0, m): if i < (m+1)//2:\n                    row = i+1\n                    col = 2*i+1\n                else:\n                    row = i+1\n                    col = 2*(i - (m+1)//2) + 2\n\n          But the known solution from known problems: \n            We place:\n              (1,1)\n              (3,2)\n              (5,3)\n              ... until we have placed m queens. However, the provided code uses a different construction. But the provided code does:\n\n        x = ...   (the largest i with 3*i+2<=n)\n\n        Then we place two diagonals: \n          Diagonal1: for i in range(x): \n                a = z + x - i - 1   # row: starting at z (which is 1) and then the row index: 1 + (x-1) down to 1? b = z + i            # column: starting at 1, then 2, ... So the first diagonal: \n                    (1 + x - 1, 1+0) = (x,1)\n                    (1 + x - 2, 1+1) = (x-1,2)\n                    ... \n                    (1, x)\n\n          Then z becomes 1+x = x+1. Then we set x = x+1 (so x becomes the old x+1) Then we place a diagonal of length x (which is old x+1) starting at (x+1, x+1) but:\n\n                row = z + x - i - 1 = (x+1) + (x) - i - 1 = 2*x - i   (if we consider the old x, then new x = old x+1, so 2*(old x)+1 - i? ) col = z + i = (x+1) + i\n\n          For i=0: ( (x+1) + (x) - 0 - 1, (x+1)+0 ) = ( (x+1)+x-1, x+1 ) = (2*x, x+1) -> but note: the old x is now increased by one, so let me denote old_x as x0, then new_x = x0+1. Then the diagonal: \n                i=0: ( (x0+1) + (x0+1) - 0 - 1, (x0+1)+0 ) = (2*x0+1, x0+1)\n                i=1: ( (x0+1) + (x0+1) - 1 - 1, (x0+1)+1 ) = (2*x0, x0+2)\n                ... \n                i=x0: ( (x0+1) + (x0+1) - x0 - 1, (x0+1)+x0 ) = (x0+1, 2*x0+1) So the second diagonal: from (2*x0+1, x0+1) to (x0+1, 2*x0+1) Then we place an extra diagonal for the remainder: (n-2)%3? How many do we have so far? First diagonal: x0\n            Second diagonal: x0+1\n            Total: 2*x0+1\n\n          Then we place (n-2)%3 more? But note: the condition: 3*x0+2 <= n -> so n >= 3*x0+2. Then the remainder: n - (3*x0+2) might be 0,1,2? The known solution: the total k = (2*n+2)//3. How does 2*x0+1 relate to (2*n+2)//3? We have: 3*x0+2 <= n < 3*(x0+1)+2 = 3*x0+5. Then n = 3*x0+2 + r, where r in {0,1,2}. Then k = (2*n+2)//3 = (2*(3*x0+2+r)+2)//3 = (6*x0+4+2*r+2)//3 = (6*x0+6+2*r)//3 = 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3? But (2*r)//3: if r=0 -> 0, if r=1 -> 0 (because 2//3=0), if r=2 -> 4//3=1? Actually: \n            r=0: (6*x0+6)//3 = 2*x0+2 -> but we have 2*x0+1 so far -> we need one more?\n            r=1: (6*x0+8)//3 = 2*x0+ floor(8/3)=2*x0+2 -> we have 2*x0+1 -> need one more?\n            r=2: (6*x0+10)//3 = 2*x0+3 -> we have 2*x0+1 -> need two more? But the code does:\n\n            for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ans.append( ... ) What is (n-2)%3? \n            n = 3*x0+2 + r -> (n-2) = 3*x0 + r -> (n-2)%3 = r.\n\n          So we are adding r more. Then total = 2*x0+1 + r.\n\n          We need: \n            r=0: 2*x0 +2 -> but we have 2*x0+1 -> not enough? \n            r=1: 2*x0 +2 -> we have 2*x0+1 -> we add 1 -> total=2*x0+2 -> matches. r=2: we need 2*x0+3 -> we have 2*x0+1 and we add 2 -> total=2*x0+3 -> matches. So it matches. How are the extra placed? for i in range(r):   # r = (n-2)%3\n                ans.append( (z + r - i - 1, z + i) )   # z is now 2*x0+1 (because after the second diagonal, we did z += x, and x was x0+1, so z = (x0+1) + (x0+1) = 2*x0+2? Actually, after the second diagonal, we did:\n\n            z = 1   (initially)\n            after first diagonal: z = 1 + x0   (x0 is the x we found)\n            then we set x = x0+1\n            then we do the second diagonal: then we do z += x -> so z = 1 + x0 + (x0+1) = 2*x0+2. Then the extra diagonal: \n            for i in range(r):\n                row = z + r - i - 1   # = (2*x0+2) + r - i - 1\n                col = z + i            # = (2*x0+2) + i This is a diagonal of length r starting at (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) and going? \n            i=0: (2*x0+2 + r - 1, 2*x0+2) \n            i=1: (2*x0+2 + r - 2, 2*x0+2+1)\n            ... i=r-1: (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2+r-1) But note: the board size is n. We must ensure that the coordinates are in [1, n]. Since n = 3*x0+2+r, and we have:\n\n            The last coordinate in the second diagonal: (x0+1, 2*x0+1) -> which is within [1, n] because 2*x0+1 <= 3*x0+2+r? The extra diagonal: the row and column go from 2*x0+2 to 2*x0+2+r-1. We have 2*x0+2+r-1 = 2*x0+1+r. Since n=3*x0+2+r, then 2*x0+1+r <= 3*x0+2+r? -> 2*x0+1 <= 3*x0+2 -> true for x0>=0. But we must also check the upper bound: 2*x0+2+r-1 = 2*x0+1+r. We have 2*x0+1+r <= 3*x0+2+r? -> 0<=x0+1 -> true. However, we must check the lower bound: 1.\n\n          Example: n=4 -> then we look for x0: i from 100000 down to 0: \n                i=0: 3*0+2=2<=4 -> then x0=0, r = n - (3*0+2) = 2. Then we place:\n                First diagonal: for i in range(0): ... -> skip. Then set x = 0+1 = 1. Second diagonal: for i in range(1): \n                    row = z + 1 - i - 1 = (1) + 1 - 0 - 1 = 1\n                    col = z + i = 1+0=1 -> so (1,1)\n                Then z becomes 1+1=2. Then r = (n-2)%3 = (4-2)%3=2 -> so we add two more:\n                    i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3) So the half-queens: (1,1), (3,2), (2,3)\n\n                k=3. But the minimum k for n=4: ceil(2*4/3)=ceil(8/3)=3 -> matches. Example: n=5 -> \n            x0: the largest i such that 3*i+2<=5 -> i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> so x0=1. Then:\n                First diagonal (x0=1): \n                    i=0: (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1) -> but wait: z=1 initially. row = 1 + 1 - 0 - 1 = 1\n                    col = 1+0=1 -> (1,1)\n                Then z = 1+1=2, x = 1+1=2. Second diagonal (x=2): \n                    i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3) Then z = 2+2=4. r = (5-2)%3 = 3%3=0 -> no extra. So half-queens: (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) -> k=3. Minimum k: ceil(10/3)=4? -> wait: (2*5+2)//3 = 12//3=4 -> so we need 4. This does not match. What went wrong? The known solution: k = (2*n+2)//3 -> for n=5: (10+2)//3 = 12//3=4. But our construction only placed 3.\n\n          How to fix? The condition: we set x0 to the largest i such that 3*i+2<=n. For n=5, i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> so we break and set x0=1. Then we placed 2*x0+1 = 3 half-queens. But we need 4. The remainder: n=5, then r = (n-2)%3 = 3%3=0 -> so we add 0. Total=3. But we need 4. The problem: the formula for k is (2*n+2)//3, which for n=5 is 4.\n\n          How does the known solution place 4? One known construction: \n            m = (2*n+2)//3\n            Then place:\n              for i in range(0, m):\n                 if i < (m+1)//2:\n                    a = i+1\n                    b = 2*i+1\n                 else:\n                    a = i+1\n                    b = 2*(i - (m+1)//2) + 2\n\n            For n=5, m=4:\n              i=0: a=1, b=1 -> (1,1)\n              i=1: a=2, b=3 -> (2,3)\n              i=2: a=3, b= 2*(2- (4+1)//2) + 2 = 2*(2-2)+2=2 -> (3,2)\n              i=3: a=4, b= 2*(3-2)+2 = 2*1+2=4 -> (4,4) So the positions: (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (4,4)\n\n          How can we adjust the provided code? The provided code for the else part (n>=4) is:\n\n            for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n                if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n                    # TODO: set x = i and break\n            ... then the rest. But for n=5, we set x0=1, then we placed 3 queens, but we need 4. The problem: the remainder r = (n-2)%3 = 3%3=0, but we actually need to account for the entire n? Alternatively, note: the condition 3*x0+2<=n is used to set x0, but then we have n = 3*x0+2 + r, and we add r queens. Then total = 2*x0+1 + r.\n\n          For n=5: 5 = 3*1+2+0 -> so total=3. But we need 4. The known formula: k = (2*n+2)//3 = (10+2)//3=4.\n\n          How to express 4 in terms of x0? 2*x0 +1 + r = 3 + 0 = 3 -> not 4. What if we set x0 differently? We want: 2*x0 +1 + r = (2*n+2)//3. And n = 3*x0+2 + r.\n\n          Then: \n            (2*n+2)//3 = (2*(3*x0+2+r)+2)//3 = (6*x0+4+2*r+2)//3 = (6*x0+6+2*r)//3 = 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3   (but integer division) But we have: 2*x0+1 + r.\n\n          We require: 2*x0+1+r = 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3   -> then r = 1 + (2*r)//3. This is not true for r=0: 0 = 1 -> false. So the construction in the provided code does not match the known formula? But the note says: Example n=3: k=2 -> which matches (2*3+2)//3 = 8//3=2 (if we do integer floor? but 8/3=2.66 -> floor is 2? but we need ceiling? Actually: (2*3+2)=8, 8//3=2 in integer floor? but we need 2, so it matches). For n=4: (2*4+2)=10, 10//3=3 (if we do floor) -> but we need ceiling? Actually: ceil(8/3)=3 -> so k= (2*n+2+2)//3? The known solution: k = ceil(2n/3) = (2n+2)//3 when using integer division? Actually: \n            ceil(2n/3) = (2n+2)//3   because: \n                Let k = ceil(2n/3) = (2n+2)//3   (by the formula: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b? but here: (2n+2)//3 = (2n+2)//3, which is integer division). For n=5: (2*5+2)//3 = 12//3=4 -> matches. How to fix the construction? The provided construction: \n            k = 2*x0+1 + r, where r = (n-2)%3, and n = 3*x0+2 + r.\n\n          We want: 2*x0+1+r = (2*n+2)//3. Substitute n = 3*x0+2+r:\n\n            (2*(3*x0+2+r)+2)//3 = (6*x0+4+2*r+2)//3 = (6*x0+6+2*r)//3 = 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3   (but integer division: so if 2*r is divisible by 3? not necessarily) Actually, we must have:\n\n            2*x0+1+r = (2*n+2)//3 [by the problem]\n\n          But we have:\n\n            (2*n+2)//3 = (6*x0+6+2*r)//3 = 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3   (if we do integer division, then (6*x0+6+2*r) is divided by 3: quotient is 2*x0+2 and remainder is 2*r mod 3? so it's not necessarily 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3). Actually, we have:\n\n            (6*x0+6+2*r) = 3*(2*x0+2) + (2*r mod 3)   -> so (6*x0+6+2*r)//3 = 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3? only if 2*r < 3? But r is in {0,1,2}. r=0: (6*x0+6)//3 = 2*x0+2 -> we have 2*x0+1+0 = 2*x0+1 -> not equal.\n            r=1: (6*x0+8)//3 = 2*x0+ floor(8/3)=2*x0+2 -> we have 2*x0+2 -> matches.\n            r=2: (6*x0+10)//3 = 2*x0+3 (because 10//3=3 remainder 1) -> we have 2*x0+1+2=2*x0+3 -> matches. So only r=0 fails. How to fix for r=0? We note: when r=0, then n=3*x0+2. Then we want: k = (2*n+2)//3 = (6*x0+4+2)//3 = (6*x0+6)//3 = 2*x0+2. But our construction gives 2*x0+1. We need to add one more half-queen. But the code currently adds r=0 extra. So we should add one more in the case r=0? However, the code does:\n\n            for i in range((n-2)%3):   # which is 0 -> no extra.",

Alternate construction: We break the board into three parts: \n              Part1: rows 1 to x0, columns 1 to x0 -> covered by the first diagonal? \n              Part2: rows x0+1 to 2*x0+1, columns x0+1 to 2*x0+1 -> covered by the second diagonal? \n              Part3: the rest. But when r=0, we have n=3*x0+2, so the board size is 3*x0+2. The first diagonal: covers the diagonal from (x0,1) to (1,x0) -> which is in the top-left x0 x x0. The second diagonal: covers from (2*x0+1, x0+1) to (x0+1, 2*x0+1) -> which is in the bottom-right (x0+1) x (x0+1) block? But the board has size (3*x0+2) x (3*x0+2). There is a gap in the middle? We need to cover the entire board. How about we add one more half-queen at (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) for the r=0 case? Then total = 2*x0+2. But then we have:\n\n            k = 2*x0+2. And the extra part: we would add one queen: at (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) -> but then we are not using the loop for r, we would have to do a special case. The code currently adds extra only for r>0. We can change the extra to be: \n\n            extra = (n-2) % 3\n            if extra == 0 and n ! = 3*x0+2: \n                # but n=3*x0+2 by definition, so extra=0. # then we add one more?

But then for r=1 and r=2, we add r as before. However, the code after the two diagonals does:\n\n            for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ... We can change that to:\n\n            r = (n-2) % 3\n            if r == 0:\n                # then we add one more at (z, z)   # z is 2*x0+2 at this point. ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z, z))))\n            else:\n                for i in range(r):\n                    ...

But wait, for r=1: we are adding one more by the else branch (the for-loop for r=1) -> total=2*x0+1+1=2*x0+2, which matches the requirement. However, for r=0 we add one more, and for r=1 we add one more? But for r=1: we add one more by the for-loop (which is the same as before). But note: the requirement for r=1: we need 2*x0+2, and we have 2*x0+1 from the two diagonals, then we add one more -> total=2*x0+2. For r=0: we have 2*x0+1 from the two diagonals, then we add one more -> total=2*x0+2. For r=2: we add two more -> total=2*x0+3.

For n=6: \n            x0: largest i with 3*i+2<=6 -> i= floor((6-2)/3)= floor(4/3)=1 -> 3*1+2=5<=6 -> so x0=1. then n = 3*1+2 + r = 5 + r -> r=1. two diagonals: \n                first: (1,1)\n                second: (3,2), (2,3)\n            then r=1: we add one more: \n                a = z + 1 - 0 - 1 = 4+1-0-1=4, b=4+0=4 -> (4,4)\n            total=4.

But (2*6+2)=14, 14//3=4 in integer floor? -> but we need ceil(12/3)=4? -> so 4 is enough. For n=6, is 4 enough? -> yes. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the entire else block above. But wait, the provided code after the TODO has:\n\n                z = 1\n                for i in range(x):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n                z += x\n                x += 1\n                for i in range(x):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n                z += x\n                for i in range((n - 2) % 3):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + (n - 2) % 3 - i - 1, z + i)))) We are changing the last for-loop to an if-else.

The last operation on position i must have set arr[i] = 0, and just before that, we had arr[i] = arr[i-1] (because 0 = arr[i] - arr[i-1] implies arr[i] = arr[i-1]). But then how did we get arr[i-1] to be the value that is then used to set arr[i] to 0? We can think greedily backwards: We start from the last element and move to the front. However, note the operations can be done in any order and multiple times. Another insight: \n          The process is similar to the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the final goal: \n          We require for i from n-1 down to 1:\n             a[i] = 0.\n\n        How about we simulate backwards from the last element to the first?

      "text": "After research, the solution for the exact problem (from a contest): \n            We can do it if and only if for every i from 0 to n-1, the element a[i] is divisible by a[0]. But consider: [3, 5] -> \n                a0=3, a1=5 -> 5 is not divisible by 3 -> should be \"NO\", and indeed we cannot make a1=0? but we are not required to make a1=0, only a2, a3,... and here n=2, so we only have to make a1=0? -> no, for n=2, we have to make a1=0? The problem: for i from 2 to n, we want a_i=0. For n=2, there is no i>=2? -> then it is vacuously true? The problem: \"a_i=0 for all 2<=i<=n\", and for n=2, there is no i in [2,2]? -> the array has indices 0-indexed: a0, a1. We only require for i=2? which is out of bounds. The problem says: the array has length n, and we are to make a_i=0 for i from 2 to n. In 0-indexed, that would be indices 1 to n-1? But the example: \n            Input: \"2 5\" -> n=2, array=[5,10] -> then we require a2=0? but the array only has two elements: a1 and a2? The indexing in the problem: \n            The array is a1, a2, ..., a_n. In the input: \n            The first integer is n (>=2), then n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. And we want to make a_i=0 for i from 2 to n -> that is, a2, a3, ... , an. In the example n=2: we want a2=0. Therefore, for n=2, we have to make the second element (which is a2) become 0. In the provided example: [5,10] -> we can. For [3,5] (n=2): \n             a1=3, a2=5. We can only change index2: a2 = 5 - 3 = 2.\n             then a2 = 2-3 = -1. then a2 = -1-3 = -4 -> never 0. Therefore, [3,5] is \"NO\". So the condition: for i>=1 (0-indexed, the elements from index1 to the end) must be divisible by a0. But consider [2, 3, 6] (n=3): \n             a0=2, a1=3, a2=6. We want to make a2=0. We cannot change a1. For a2: we can do:\n                 a2 = 6 - 3 = 3.\n                 a2 = 3 - 3 = 0. -> works. Here, 3 is not divisible by 2, but we did it. What's the difference? In the operation for a2, we are allowed to use a1 (which is 3) and then later use the same a1 (which is 3) again. But note: after the first operation, a2 becomes 3, and then we can do it again: a2 = 3 - 3 = 0. So the condition might be: for each i from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed), a0 must divide a_i? -> \n             For [2,3,6]: \n                 i=1: a1=3 -> 2 does not divide 3 -> fails. But the example worked. Therefore, the condition is not that. Another try: \n             We can make a_i=0 for i>=1 (0-indexed) if and only if a0 divides a_i? For [2,3,6]: \n                 a0=2, a1=3 -> 2 does not divide 3 -> fails, but we don't require a1=0. We only require a2=0 (0-indexed a2) for n=3. So the condition might be: for i>=1, the element a_i must be divisible by a0, but for [2,3,6] we have a2=6 which is divisible by 2, and we don't care about a1. Then the condition: for i from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed), a0 must divide a_i? [2,3,6]: a0=2, a1=3 -> 2 does not divide 3 -> should be \"NO\", but we did it. How did we do it? We used a1=3 to reduce a2=6 to 3, then to 0. But a1=3 is not divisible by 2, and we used it. Therefore, the condition is not that.",

After more research, we found the following solution for the exact problem ( from a known passing code ):\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            int main() {\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) {\n                    int n;\n                    cin >> n;\n                    vector<int> a(n);\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        cin >> a[i];\n                    }\n                    bool ok = true;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        bool found = false;\n                        for (int j = 2; j <= i+2; j++) {\n                            if (a[i] % j != 0) {\n                                found = true;\n                                break;\n                            }\n                        }\n                        if (!found) {\n                            ok = false;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    cout << (ok ? \"YES\" : \"NO\") << endl;\n                }\n            }\n\n          This is for a different problem.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about forming teams to maximize wins. The key idea is that when forming a team, we can set every player's power to the maximum in that team. Therefore, the total power of a team with k players and maximum power x is k * x. We want this to be > D.\n\n We note that we can form a team by taking the largest available player and then including as many of the smallest players as needed? Actually, note the condition: we can set all to the maximum. So if we have a player with power x, then we can form a team of k players if k * x > D. But note: we are allowed to choose any subset. However, we want to maximize the number of wins. Therefore, we want to form as many teams as possible.\n\n Strategy: \n   Sort the powers in descending order. Then, we try to form a team starting from the largest available player. How many players do we need? For a player with power x, we need at least k such that k * x > D. The minimal k is ceil(D/x) + 1? Actually: k_min = floor(D/x) + 1. Because if we have k_min = (D // x) + 1, then k_min * x > D (if D is divisible by x, then (D//x)*x = D, so we need one more). But note: if D is not divisible by x, then (D//x) might be floor, so (D//x)+1 might be enough? Actually: \n        k_min = (D + x) // x   -> which is the same as: if D % x == 0 then k_min = D//x + 1? Actually: \n        We require k_min * x > D  => k_min > D/x. So k_min = floor(D/x) + 1.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to take any players. But we want to use as few players as possible per team to maximize the number of teams. So for a given x (the largest in the team), we need at least k_min = (D // x) + 1 players? But wait: if D//x is an integer, then we need k_min = D//x + 1. If not, then k_min = floor(D/x) + 1. However, note that (D//x) in integer division is floor division. So k_min = (D // x) + 1.\n\n But note: we are starting from the largest. We can use the largest player and then the next k_min-1 smallest available players? Actually, we can use the largest and then the next k_min-1 players? But we want to use as few players as possible per team. So we take the largest and then the smallest k_min-1 players? Actually, we don't care about the other players' power because they become the maximum. However, we cannot use a player that is already in a team.\n\n Alternate approach: greedy. We sort the array in descending order. Then we traverse from the largest. For the current largest, we know we need at least k = (D // x) + 1 players to form a team. But note: we can use the largest and then the next k-1 largest? Actually, we can use any k players. However, we want to leave as many large players as possible for other teams. So we should use the current largest and then the smallest k-1 players? Why? Because the smallest players are less useful for forming other teams (if we use a large player in a team as the maximum, then we need fewer players, but if we use a large player as a non-maximum, then we are wasting its potential). Therefore, we use the largest and then the smallest k-1 players to form a team.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use the largest as the maximum? Actually, in a team the maximum is the largest in that team. So if we form a team with the largest and then some smaller ones, the maximum becomes the largest. So we can form a team with the largest and then k-1 of the smallest available players.\n\n Steps:\n   Sort the array in descending order.\n   We maintain two pointers: one at the beginning (largest) and one at the end (smallest). \n   But note: the problem says we are traversing from the largest. The current code does:\n\n        for x in sorted(p, reverse=True):\n            if temp >= ((d//x)+1):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   Here, `temp` is initially set to `n` (the total number of players). \n\n   How does the solution work?\n        We are going to count the number of teams we can form. We traverse the players from largest to smallest. For a player x, we check if there are at least k = (d//x)+1 players available. If so, we form a team: we use one player (the current x) and then k-1 other players. But note: we are going to remove k players? Actually, we use k players. So we reduce the available players by k. However, the current code uses a variable `temp` which is the current available players. \n\n        We do:\n            ans += 1   (because we form one team)\n            temp -= k   (because we use k players)\n\n        But note: the condition in the if-statement: if temp >= k, then we form a team.\n\n        However, we are traversing from largest to smallest. When we form a team, we use the current player (the largest) and then k-1 other players. But we are going to traverse all players? We must skip the players that are already used? Actually, we are not actually removing the players from the list, but we are using a counter `temp` for the available players.\n\n        But note: the k-1 players we use are the smallest available? The problem does not specify which players to use. We are allowed to choose arbitrarily. So we can use the current largest and then the smallest k-1 players. Then we remove the current largest and the k-1 smallest. However, we are traversing the list in descending order. We are at the largest, and then we remove k-1 smallest. How do we account for the smallest? \n\n        Actually, we don't need to know which ones we remove. We just need to know the count. We are going to use one large player and then k-1 small players. So we remove k players. \n\n        However, note: the condition `temp >= k` must hold. Then we do:\n            ans += 1\n            temp -= k   # we use k players: one large and k-1 smalls.\n\n        But wait: we are traversing the list of players. We are at a large player. We are going to use that large player and then k-1 small players. But we haven't processed the small players? We are going to skip them? \n\n        How to avoid double counting? We can use a two-pointer or a deque? Actually, the problem does not require the exact composition. We only care about the count of wins.\n\n        However, the current code uses a for-loop that iterates over every player. We cannot use a player twice. So we must account for the removal of the k-1 small players. \n\n        Alternate approach: \n            We sort the array in descending order.\n            We use a pointer at the beginning (largest) and a pointer at the end (smallest). \n            We traverse the array from the largest. For the current largest, we check: how many players do we need? k = (d // x) + 1. Then we check if the current available players (from the largest down to the smallest) is at least k. But note: we are going to use the current largest and then k-1 smallest. Then we remove the current largest and the k-1 smallest. Then we move the largest pointer to the next, and the smallest pointer moves k-1 to the left.\n\n        But the current code does not have two pointers. It uses a variable `temp` that is the current count of available players. \n\n        How about:\n\n            ans = 0\n            temp = n   # available players\n            for x in sorted(p, reverse=True):\n                # We are considering the player x. If we use this player as the maximum, then we need k = (d//x) + 1 players.\n                k = (d // x) + 1\n                if temp < k:\n                    # we cannot form a team with this player as the maximum? Then skip? Actually, we can skip because we are going to use the player as a non-maximum? But note: we are traversing from largest to smallest. If we skip a large player, then we might use it as a non-maximum in a team formed by a larger player? But we are starting from the largest. So if we skip a player, it means we don't have enough players to form a team with it as the maximum. Then we leave it for being used as a non-maximum? However, if we leave it, then we might use it in a team with a larger player? But we already processed the larger players. \n\n                Actually, we are processing the largest first. So when we are at a player, we have not used it. We form a team with the current player (if possible) and then remove k players (including the current). \n\n            So the code:\n\n                n, d = map(int, ...)\n                p = list(...)\n                p.sort(reverse=True)\n                available = n\n                wins = 0\n                for x in p:\n                    k = (d // x) + 1   # we need k players for a team with maximum x\n                    if available < k:\n                        # we cannot form a team with this x as the maximum? Then we break? Because the remaining players are even fewer? \n                        # But note: we might form a team with a larger maximum? But we are going from largest to smallest. So we break?\n                        break\n                    # Otherwise, we form a team: we use the current player and k-1 other players (which we take from the smallest to preserve the large ones for being maximums in other teams)\n                    wins += 1\n                    available -= k   # we remove k players: the current and k-1 smallest.\n\n                print(wins)\n\n        However, note: we are iterating over every player. But when we remove k players, we are effectively skipping k-1 players? But we are going to iterate over the entire list? We must avoid using the same player twice.\n\n        How to account for the removal of the k-1 smallest? We are not actually removing from the list, but we are reducing the available count. Then when we get to a player that has been removed? We are iterating over the entire list. We must skip the players that are removed? \n\n        Actually, we are iterating over the sorted list. The k-1 smallest players are the ones at the end of the sorted list (which we sorted in descending order, so the smallest are the last). But we are going from the beginning. We are going to use the current player (which is at the front) and then k-1 players from the end. \n\n        We can simulate:\n\n            We have a list: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5] (descending) and d=10.\n            For the first player (10): k = (10//10)+1 = 1+1 = 2. We form a team: use 10 and one smallest (which is 5). Then we remove these two. Now available = 4.\n            Then we go to the next: 9 -> k = (10//9)+1 = 1+1=2. We form a team: 9 and the next smallest (which is 6). Then available becomes 2.\n            Then 8: k = (10//8)+1 = 1+1=2 -> but available=2, so we form: 8 and 7? But wait, we have two players left: 8 and 7. Then we form a team? Then wins=3.\n\n            But is that valid? \n                Team1: [10,5] -> becomes [10,10] -> sum=20>10 -> win.\n                Team2: [9,6] -> becomes [9,9] -> sum=18>10 -> win.\n                Team3: [8,7] -> becomes [8,8] -> sum=16>10 -> win.\n\n            So 3 wins.\n\n        However, we could have formed:\n            Team1: [10,9] -> becomes [10,10] -> 20>10 -> win.\n            Then we have [8,7,6,5]. \n            Team2: [8,7,6] -> becomes [8,8,8] -> 24>10 -> win. (k for 8: (10//8)+1=2, but we used 3? Actually, we can use more than the minimum? But note: we are required to form a team that wins. The condition is that the sum must be > D. We can use more than k_min? But then we use more players. We want to use as few as possible to leave more for other teams.\n\n        The greedy strategy: use the current largest and the smallest k_min-1 players. This minimizes the number of players used per team.\n\n        But note: the above simulation used 2 players per team and got 3 wins. Alternatively, if we form a team with 3 players for the first team, we might get:\n\n            Team1: [10,9,8] -> becomes [10,10,10] -> 30>10 -> win. Then we have [7,6,5]. \n            Then for 7: k_min = (10//7)+1 = 1+1=2 -> we form a team: [7,5] -> 14>10 -> win. Then we have 6 left -> cannot form a team (because k_min for 6: (10//6)+1 = 1+1=2, but we only have one). So total wins=2.\n\n        So the first strategy is better.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Sort the array in descending order.\n            available = n\n            wins = 0\n            for each x in the sorted array (from largest to smallest):\n                k = (d // x) + 1   # the minimal number of players needed for a team with maximum x\n                if available < k:\n                    break   # we cannot form any more teams\n                wins += 1\n                available -= k   # we use the current player (x) and k-1 smallest players\n\n            print(wins)\n\n        However, note: the current code has a variable `ans` that is the wins, and `temp` that is the available players. So we can write:\n\n            if temp >= k:\n                ans += 1\n                temp -= k\n\n        But note: we are iterating over every player. We are going to consider every player? Even if we remove the current player? Actually, we are using the current player (so we remove it) and then k-1 others. But the for-loop will still iterate over the next players? And we are going to skip the k-1 smallest? How? We are not. We are going to see the next largest, which is the next in the sorted list. But we have removed the current and the k-1 smallest. The k-1 smallest are at the end of the list. We are iterating from the front. So we are going to see the next largest that is still available? But we are not skipping the ones we remove? \n\n        We must break the loop when we run out of players? But the for-loop runs for n players. We are using a counter `temp` to track the available players, but we are not skipping the players that are removed. We are going to process every player in the sorted list, but we are not allowed to use a player twice.\n\n        How to fix? We can break when we don't have enough players? But note: we are going to process the next player even if we have removed it? We are iterating over the entire sorted list. We are going to consider a player that we have already used? \n\n        Actually, the for-loop iterates over the entire list regardless. We are using `temp` to represent the available players. We start with `temp = n`. Then we subtract k for every team we form. Then we break when we don't have enough players to form a team with the current x? But note: the current x might have been already used? \n\n        How do we know if the current x is still available? We don't. We are iterating over the entire sorted list. We are going to consider every player as a candidate for being the maximum of a team. But if we have already used the current x in a previous team (as a non-maximum? or as a maximum?) then we shouldn't use it again. \n\n        How are we accounting for the removal of the current x? We are removing k players per team. The current x is one of the k players. So when we form a team, we remove the current x and k-1 others. Then when we get to the next player, we are going to see the next largest, which is the next in the sorted list. But that next largest might have been removed? \n\n        We must not process a player that has been removed. \n\n        Alternate: we use a pointer for the smallest. We traverse the largest to the smallest. We maintain a pointer `left` for the largest and `right` for the smallest. We start with left=0 and right=n-1. Then:\n\n            while left <= right:\n                k = (d // p[left]) + 1\n                if (right - left + 1) < k: \n                    break\n                # we form a team: use p[left] and k-1 smallest players (from right down to right - (k-2))\n                wins += 1\n                left += 1\n                right -= (k-1)\n\n        Then print(wins)\n\n        Why? We remove the current largest (at left) and then k-1 smallest (from right). Then we move left to the next largest and move the right pointer to the left by k-1.\n\n        Example: [10,9,8,7,6,5] (descending order? Actually, we sorted in descending order: index0=10, index1=9, ... index5=5). \n            left=0, right=5 -> k = (10//10)+1 = 2 -> we form a team: use 10 and 5 -> then left becomes 1, right becomes 5-1=4.\n            Then left=1, right=4 -> k = (10//9)+1 = 2 -> form a team: 9 and 6 -> left=2, right=3.\n            Then left=2, right=3 -> k = (10//8)+1 = 2 -> form a team: 8 and 7 -> left=3, right=1 -> break? because left>right? wins=3.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But note: the problem says we are allowed to choose arbitrarily. We are taking the largest and the smallest k-1. This is valid.\n\n        However, the current code structure is:\n\n            for x in sorted(p, reverse=True):\n                if temp>=((d//x)+1):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We cannot change the for-loop to a while-loop? We must fill in the TODO.\n\n        How to simulate the two-pointer in the for-loop? We are iterating over the list in descending order. We are going to skip the players that have been removed? We don't know which ones are removed. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            We start with available = n.\n            We form a team: we use the current player and then k-1 players from the end. But we are going to remove k players. Then we reduce available by k.\n\n            But then the next player we consider is the next in the sorted list. However, that next player might be one of the ones we removed? \n\n        How do we know? We are iterating the entire list. We are going to process every player. We must skip the players that have been removed? \n\n        We can use a separate array to mark removed? But n can be 10^5, and we are not allowed to do nested loops.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the loop when we have used up the players? But the for-loop runs n times. We can break when we have used up the players? \n\n        Actually, we can break when the available players become less than the required k for the current x? But note: the current x might be already removed? \n\n        How do we know if the current x is available? We don't. We are iterating over the entire sorted list. We are going to see every player. We must not form a team with a player that has been removed.\n\n        We can do: we only form a team if the current player is still available? But we don't track that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note: we are removing the players in the order: the largest and then the smallest. The current player (the largest) is the first one we consider. Then we remove it. Then the next largest is the next in the list. But we have removed the current largest and k-1 smallest. The next largest is the next in the sorted list. But we haven't removed it? We only removed the current and the smallest. So the next largest is still available.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            available = n\n            wins = 0\n            for x in sorted_p:   # descending\n                if available < (d//x)+1:\n                    break\n                wins += 1\n                available -= (d//x)+1   # we remove k = (d//x)+1 players\n\n            print(wins)\n\n        Why is this valid? Because we are using the current player (which is available) and then (d//x) smallest players (which are available). And we are reducing the available count by k. Then the next player we consider is the next largest, which is still available (because we only removed the current and the smallest, and the next largest is not the smallest). \n\n        Example: [10,9,8,7,6,5] and d=10.\n\n            x=10: k= (10//10)+1 = 2 -> available=6>=2 -> wins=1, available=6-2=4.\n            x=9: k= (10//9)+1 = 1+1=2 -> available=4>=2 -> wins=2, available=2.\n            x=8: k= (10//8)+1 = 1+1=2 -> available=2>=2 -> wins=3, available=0.\n            Then break.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But what if the next largest is one of the smallest we removed? For example, if we have:\n\n            [10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]   (descending) and d=10.\n\n            x=10: k= (10//10)+1=2 -> we remove 10 and the smallest 1? Then the next largest is 5 -> which is still available? Then we form a team with 5: k = (10//5)+1 = 2+1=3? -> we need 3 players. But we have 4 players left? Then we form: 5 and the next two smallest: 2 and 3? Then we remove 3 players: 5,2,3? Then we have 4 left? Then we break? \n\n        But wait: after removing 10 and 1, we have [5,4,3,2] (but sorted descending: [5,4,3,2]). Then we process x=5: k= (10//5)+1=3 -> we remove 5 and the two smallest: 2 and 3? Then we have 4 left? Then we process x=4: k= (10//4)+1 = 2+1=3 -> but we only have 1 player? -> break.\n\n        So wins=2.\n\n        But is that optimal? \n            Team1: [10,1] -> becomes [10,10] -> 20>10 -> win.\n            Team2: [5,2,3] -> becomes [5,5,5] -> 15>10 -> win.\n            Then we have [4] -> cannot form a team (needs k= (10//4)+1=3 players) -> so 2 wins.\n\n        Alternatively, we could form:\n            Team1: [10,5] -> becomes [10,10] -> 20>10 -> win.\n            Then we have [4,3,2,1]. \n            Then for 4: k= (10//4)+1=3 -> form a team: [4,3,1] -> becomes [4,4,4] -> 12>10 -> win.\n            Then we have 2 -> cannot form a team -> wins=2.\n\n        So 2 wins is the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n            n, d = map(int, input().split())\n            p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            p.sort(reverse=True)\n            available = n\n            wins = 0\n            for x in p:\n                k = (d // x) + 1\n                if available < k:\n                    break\n                wins += 1\n                available -= k\n            print(wins)\n\n        But note: the current code has:\n\n            temp = n   # available\n            ans = 0\n            for x in sorted(p, reverse=True):\n                if temp >= ((d//x)+1):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            ans += 1\n            temp -= (d//x)+1\n\n        However, note: the condition is already checked. So:\n\n            if temp >= ((d//x)+1):\n                ans += 1\n                temp -= (d//x)+1\n\n        But note: the variable `x` is the current player. We use `(d//x)+1` as k.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            ans += 1\n            temp -= (d // x) + 1\n\n        But note: integer division in Python: d//x is floor division. This matches our requirement.\n\n        However, what if x is very small? Then k = (d//x)+1 might be huge? But we break when temp < k. So it's safe.\n\n        Let's test with the example: n=6, d=10, p=[5,10,5,5,5,5] -> but wait, the example in the note: \n            Input: \"6 180\\n90 80 20 100 90 10\" -> output 2.\n\n        How does our algorithm work for that example?\n\n            p = [100, 90, 90, 80, 20, 10] (sorted descending)\n            available = 6\n            wins=0\n\n            x=100: k = (180//100)+1 = 1+1=2 -> available=6>=2 -> wins=1, available=4.\n            x=90: k = (180//90)+1 = 2+1=3 -> available=4>=3 -> wins=2, available=1.\n            x=90: k=3 -> available=1<3 -> break.\n\n            So wins=2 -> matches.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            ans += 1\n            temp -= (d // x) + 1\n\n        But note: the condition is already in the if. So we just add these two lines.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem is about placing half-queens on an n x n board so that every cell is attacked. We are to output the minimum number k and then k positions.\n\n The provided code has:\n\n    if n <= 2:\n        k = 1\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (1, 1))))\n    elif n == 3:\n        k = 2\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (1, 1))))\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (1, 2))))\n    else:\n        for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n            if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        z = 1\n        for i in range(x):\n            ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n        z += x\n        x += 1\n        for i in range(x):\n            ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n        z += x\n        for i in range((n - 2) % 3):\n            ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + (n - 2) % 3 - i - 1, z + i))))\n        k = len(ans)\n\n The idea for the problem: \n   Known: the minimum number of half-queens is ceil(2*n/3). \n\n   How to construct? \n     We break the board into three parts. We place the half-queens in two diagonals that cover the board.\n\n     The provided code in the else part (for n>=4) is trying to find an x such that 3*x+2 <= n. Then it does:\n\n        z = 1\n        for i in range(x):\n            ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )   # this is a diagonal: from (x,1) to (1,x) ? \n        Then z += x\n        Then x += 1\n        Then for i in range(x):   # now x is the old x+1\n            ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )   # then z is x+1, so the next diagonal: from (x+ (x+1)-1, x+0) to (x+0, x+(x+1)-1) -> that is (2*x, x) to (x, 2*x) ? \n\n        Then z += x   (so z becomes x + (x+1) = 2*x+1)\n        Then for i in range((n-2)%3):\n            ... \n\n     But note: the variable x is not defined in the code after the TODO. We must set x in the TODO.\n\n     The problem: we are to set x to the largest integer i such that 3*i+2 <= n? Then we use that x.\n\n     Actually, the for-loop:\n\n        for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n            if 3*i+2 <= n:\n                # then we set x = i and break\n\n        Then we break out of the loop? But we are in a for-loop. We can break? Or we set x and break.\n\n     So the TODO part:\n\n        x = i\n        break\n\n     Then we proceed to place two diagonals: the first of length x and the second of length x+1.\n\n     Then we place an extra diagonal of length (n-2)%3? But note: the total number of half-queens should be about 2*n/3.\n\n     However, note: the known solution for this problem:\n\n        k = (2*n+2)//3   (ceiling of 2n/3)\n\n        How to place?\n          Let m = (2*n+2)//3\n          Then we place:\n            for i in range(0, m):\n                if i < (m+1)//2:\n                    row = i+1\n                    col = 2*i+1\n                else:\n                    row = i+1\n                    col = 2*(i - (m+1)//2) + 2\n\n          But the known solution from known problems: \n            We place:\n              (1,1)\n              (3,2)\n              (5,3)\n              ... until we have placed m queens.\n\n          However, the provided code uses a different construction.\n\n     But the provided code does:\n\n        x = ...   (the largest i with 3*i+2<=n)\n\n        Then we place two diagonals: \n          Diagonal1: for i in range(x): \n                a = z + x - i - 1   # row: starting at z (which is 1) and then the row index: 1 + (x-1) down to 1? \n                b = z + i            # column: starting at 1, then 2, ... \n                So the first diagonal: \n                    (1 + x - 1, 1+0) = (x,1)\n                    (1 + x - 2, 1+1) = (x-1,2)\n                    ... \n                    (1, x)\n\n          Then z becomes 1+x = x+1.\n          Then we set x = x+1 (so x becomes the old x+1)\n          Then we place a diagonal of length x (which is old x+1) starting at (x+1, x+1) but:\n\n                row = z + x - i - 1 = (x+1) + (x) - i - 1 = 2*x - i   (if we consider the old x, then new x = old x+1, so 2*(old x)+1 - i? )\n                col = z + i = (x+1) + i\n\n          For i=0: ( (x+1) + (x) - 0 - 1, (x+1)+0 ) = ( (x+1)+x-1, x+1 ) = (2*x, x+1) -> but note: the old x is now increased by one, so let me denote old_x as x0, then new_x = x0+1.\n          Then the diagonal: \n                i=0: ( (x0+1) + (x0+1) - 0 - 1, (x0+1)+0 ) = (2*x0+1, x0+1)\n                i=1: ( (x0+1) + (x0+1) - 1 - 1, (x0+1)+1 ) = (2*x0, x0+2)\n                ... \n                i=x0: ( (x0+1) + (x0+1) - x0 - 1, (x0+1)+x0 ) = (x0+1, 2*x0+1)\n\n          So the second diagonal: from (2*x0+1, x0+1) to (x0+1, 2*x0+1)\n\n          Then we place an extra diagonal for the remainder: (n-2)%3? \n\n          How many do we have so far? \n            First diagonal: x0\n            Second diagonal: x0+1\n            Total: 2*x0+1\n\n          Then we place (n-2)%3 more? \n\n          But note: the condition: 3*x0+2 <= n -> so n >= 3*x0+2. Then the remainder: n - (3*x0+2) might be 0,1,2? \n\n          The known solution: the total k = (2*n+2)//3.\n\n          How does 2*x0+1 relate to (2*n+2)//3? \n\n          We have: 3*x0+2 <= n < 3*(x0+1)+2 = 3*x0+5.\n\n          Then n = 3*x0+2 + r, where r in {0,1,2}.\n\n          Then k = (2*n+2)//3 = (2*(3*x0+2+r)+2)//3 = (6*x0+4+2*r+2)//3 = (6*x0+6+2*r)//3 = 2*x0+2 + (2*r)//3? \n\n          But (2*r)//3: if r=0 -> 0, if r=1 -> 0 (because 2//3=0), if r=2 -> 4//3=1? \n\n          Actually: \n            r=0: (6*x0+6)//3 = 2*x0+2 -> but we have 2*x0+1 so far -> we need one more?\n            r=1: (6*x0+8)//3 = 2*x0+ floor(8/3)=2*x0+2 -> we have 2*x0+1 -> need one more?\n            r=2: (6*x0+10)//3 = 2*x0+3 -> we have 2*x0+1 -> need two more?\n\n          But the code does:\n\n            for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ans.append( ... )\n\n          What is (n-2)%3? \n            n = 3*x0+2 + r -> (n-2) = 3*x0 + r -> (n-2)%3 = r.\n\n          So we are adding r more.\n\n          Then total = 2*x0+1 + r.\n\n          We need: \n            r=0: 2*x0+2 -> but we have 2*x0+1 -> not enough? \n            r=1: 2*x0+2 -> we have 2*x0+1 -> we add 1 -> total=2*x0+2 -> matches.\n            r=2: we need 2*x0+3 -> we have 2*x0+1 and we add 2 -> total=2*x0+3 -> matches.\n\n          So it matches.\n\n          How are the extra placed? \n\n            for i in range(r):   # r = (n-2)%3\n                ans.append( (z + r - i - 1, z + i) )   # z is now 2*x0+1 (because after the second diagonal, we did z += x, and x was x0+1, so z = (x0+1) + (x0+1) = 2*x0+2? \n\n          Actually, after the second diagonal, we did:\n\n            z = 1   (initially)\n            after first diagonal: z = 1 + x0   (x0 is the x we found)\n            then we set x = x0+1\n            then we do the second diagonal: then we do z += x -> so z = 1 + x0 + (x0+1) = 2*x0+2.\n\n          Then the extra diagonal: \n            for i in range(r):\n                row = z + r - i - 1   # = (2*x0+2) + r - i - 1\n                col = z + i            # = (2*x0+2) + i\n\n          This is a diagonal of length r starting at (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) and going? \n            i=0: (2*x0+2 + r - 1, 2*x0+2) \n            i=1: (2*x0+2 + r - 2, 2*x0+2+1)\n            ... \n            i=r-1: (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2+r-1)\n\n          But note: the board size is n. We must ensure that the coordinates are in [1, n]. \n\n          Since n = 3*x0+2+r, and we have:\n\n            The last coordinate in the second diagonal: (x0+1, 2*x0+1) -> which is within [1, n] because 2*x0+1 <= 3*x0+2+r? \n            The extra diagonal: the row and column go from 2*x0+2 to 2*x0+2+r-1. We have 2*x0+2+r-1 = 2*x0+1+r. Since n=3*x0+2+r, then 2*x0+1+r <= 3*x0+2+r? -> 2*x0+1 <= 3*x0+2 -> true for x0>=0.\n\n          But we must also check the upper bound: 2*x0+2+r-1 = 2*x0+1+r. We have 2*x0+1+r <= 3*x0+2+r? -> 0<=x0+1 -> true.\n\n          However, we must check the lower bound: 1.\n\n          Example: n=4 -> then we look for x0: \n            i from 100000 down to 0: \n                i=0: 3*0+2=2<=4 -> then x0=0, r = n - (3*0+2) = 2.\n            Then we place:\n                First diagonal: for i in range(0): ... -> skip.\n                Then set x = 0+1 = 1.\n                Second diagonal: for i in range(1): \n                    row = z + 1 - i - 1 = (1) + 1 - 0 - 1 = 1\n                    col = z + i = 1+0=1 -> so (1,1)\n                Then z becomes 1+1=2.\n                Then r = (n-2)%3 = (4-2)%3=2 -> so we add two more:\n                    i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n\n                So the half-queens: (1,1), (3,2), (2,3)\n\n                k=3.\n\n            But the minimum k for n=4: ceil(2*4/3)=ceil(8/3)=3 -> matches.\n\n          Example: n=5 -> \n            x0: the largest i such that 3*i+2<=5 -> i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> so x0=1.\n            Then:\n                First diagonal (x0=1): \n                    i=0: (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1) -> but wait: z=1 initially.\n                    row = 1 + 1 - 0 - 1 = 1\n                    col = 1+0=1 -> (1,1)\n                Then z = 1+1=2, x = 1+1=2.\n                Second diagonal (x=2): \n                    i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n                Then z = 2+2=4.\n                r = (5-2)%3 = 3%3=0 -> no extra.\n                So half-queens: (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) -> k=3.\n\n            Minimum k: ceil(10/3)=4? -> wait: (2*5+2)//3 = 12//3=4 -> so we need 4.\n\n            This does not match.\n\n          What went wrong? \n\n          The known solution: k = (2*n+2)//3 -> for n=5: (10+2)//3 = 12//3=4.\n\n          But our construction only placed 3.\n\n          How to fix? \n\n          The condition: we set x0 to the largest i such that 3*i+2<=n. For n=5, i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> so we break and set x0=1.\n\n          Then we placed 2*x0+1 = 3 half-queens. But we need 4.\n\n          The remainder: n=5, then r = (n-2)%3 = 3%3=0 -> so we add 0.

There is a gap in the middle? \n\n          We need to cover the entire board.\n\n          How about we add one more half-queen at (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) for the r=0 case? \n\n          Then total = 2*x0+2.\n\n          But then we have:\n\n            k = 2*x0+2.\n\n          And the extra part: we would add one queen: at (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) -> but then we are not using the loop for r, we would have to do a special case.\n\n          The code currently adds extra only for r>0.\n\n          We can change the extra to be: \n\n            extra = (n-2) % 3\n            if extra == 0 and n != 3*x0+2: \n                # but n=3*x0+2 by definition, so extra=0.\n                # then we add one more? \n\n          But wait, we have n=3*x0+2, and we want to add one more. So we can do:\n\n            if extra == 0:\n                # then we add one more at (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) \n                ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2))))\n\n          Then total becomes 2*x0+2.\n\n          But then for r=1 and r=2, we add r as before.\n\n          However, the code after the two diagonals does:\n\n            for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ... \n\n          We can change that to:\n\n            r = (n-2) % 3\n            if r == 0:\n                # then we add one more at (z, z)   # z is 2*x0+2 at this point.\n                ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z, z))))\n            else:\n                for i in range(r):\n                    ... \n\n          But then for r=0, we add one more, and for r>0, we add r more.\n\n          Then total = 2*x0+1 + (1 if r==0 else r) = \n            r=0: 2*x0+2\n            r=1: 2*x0+1+1 = 2*x0+2 -> but we need 2*x0+2? \n            r=2: 2*x0+1+2 = 2*x0+3 -> matches.\n\n          But wait, for r=1: we are adding one more by the else branch (the for-loop for r=1) -> total=2*x0+1+1=2*x0+2, which matches the requirement.\n\n          However, for r=0 we add one more, and for r=1 we add one more? \n\n          But for r=1: we add one more by the for-loop (which is the same as before). \n\n          But note: the requirement for r=1: we need 2*x0+2, and we have 2*x0+1 from the two diagonals, then we add one more -> total=2*x0+2.\n\n          For r=0: we have 2*x0+1 from the two diagonals, then we add one more -> total=2*x0+2.\n\n          For r=2: we add two more -> total=2*x0+3.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          How to code:\n\n            r = (n-2) % 3\n            if r == 0:\n                # add one queen at (z, z)\n                ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z, z))))\n            else:\n                for i in range(r):\n                    a = z + r - i - 1\n                    b = z + i\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (a, b))))\n\n          But note: the variable z is 2*x0+2 at this point.\n\n          For r=0: we add (2*x0+2, 2*x0+2) -> which is within the board? \n            n = 3*x0+2, and 2*x0+2 <= 3*x0+2? yes.\n\n          For the other cases, we do the same as before.\n\n          But wait, the for-loop for r>0 is the same as before? \n\n          However, the for-loop for r>0 in the original code was:\n\n                for i in range((n - 2) % 3):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + (n - 2) % 3 - i - 1, z + i))))\n\n          We are changing that to use r (which is (n-2)%3) and then if r==0 we do something else, and if r>0 we do the for-loop with r.\n\n          But note: the original for-loop used (n-2)%3 for the length and also in the formula. We are now using r for the length, and in the formula we use r (which is the same as (n-2)%3).\n\n          So we can replace the last part with:\n\n            r = (n-2) % 3\n            if r == 0:\n                ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z, z))))\n            else:\n                for i in range(r):\n                    a = z + r - i - 1\n                    b = z + i\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (a, b))))\n\n          But wait, the original code used:\n\n                (z + (n - 2) % 3 - i - 1, z + i)\n\n          which is the same as (z + r - i - 1, z + i) -> so we are not changing the positions for r>0.\n\n          Therefore, the TODO part is:\n\n            x = i\n            break\n\n          And then we replace the last for-loop (that uses (n-2)%3) with the above if-else.\n\n          But note: the code after the TODO is already written? We are not allowed to change it? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are allowed to fill in the TODO and also change the later part? \n\n          The TODO is only in the if-block. The later part is not in the TODO. But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we might need to output the entire block that is missing, including the replacement of the last for-loop? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing code is at the TODO and possibly other missing parts? But the program2.py code is given with a TODO and then some code after. We are to complete the TODO and leave the rest? \n\n          But the rest includes the last for-loop that we identified as problematic.\n\n          How about we assume that the provided code after the TODO is as given, and we only fill the TODO? Then for n=5 we get 3 queens, which is not enough.\n\n          Therefore, we must also fix the last part.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the entire program? No, only the missing parts. And the missing parts are marked by TODO.\n\n          However, the last for-loop is not marked by TODO. \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me re-read the problem: \"You will be given program1.py, program2.py and program3.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          And \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n          And the example: the TODO is in the code.\n\n          But the last for-loop is not missing, it is provided. \n\n          How about we output for the TODO:\n\n            x = i\n            break\n\n          and then hope that the provided last for-loop is not used? But it is used.\n\n          Alternatively, the problem might have intended a different construction that works for r=0 without extra? \n\n          Known solution from CF problems: \n            Problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1801/problem/B\n            But this is not the same.\n\n          After research, a known solution for \"half-queen\" is:\n\n            k = (n+1)//2 + 1   -> not matching.\n\n          Another known solution: \n            https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/114660?#comment-1010710\n\n          But I don't have the link.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem says to output only the missing code, I will output for the TODO:\n\n            x = i\n            break\n\n          and hope that the provided code works for the sample n=4 and n=6, but not for n=5? \n\n          But the problem says: \"runs correctly\". \n\n          How about we try n=2,3,4,5,6 with the provided code and our fix for the TODO and the extra part unchanged? \n\n          n=2: \n            if n<=2: then k=1, (1,1) -> works.\n\n          n=3: \n            else if n==3: then k=2, (1,1) and (1,2) -> works.\n\n          n=4: \n            else:\n                for i in range(100000,-1,-1):\n                    if 3*i+2<=4: -> i=0: 2<=4 -> set x=0, break.\n                Then:\n                    z=1\n                    for i in range(x=0): skip.\n                    then x = 0+1 = 1.\n                    for i in range(1): \n                         a = z + x - i - 1 = 1+1-0-1 = 1\n                         b = z+i = 1+0=1 -> (1,1)\n                    then z = 1+1=2.\n                    then for the extra: r = (4-2)%3=2, so for i in range(2):\n                         i=0: a = 2+2-0-1=3, b=2+0=2 -> (3,2)\n                         i=1: a=2+2-1-1=2, b=2+1=3 -> (2,3)\n                    then k=3.\n\n                This matches.\n\n          n=5: \n                x0: i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> set x=1, break.\n                Then:\n                    first diagonal (x0=1): \n                         i=0: a = 1+1-0-1=1, b=1+0=1 -> (1,1)\n                    then z=1+1=2, x=1+1=2.\n                    second diagonal (x=2): \n                         i=0: a=2+2-0-1=3, b=2+0=2 -> (3,2)\n                         i=1: a=2+2-1-1=2, b=2+1=3 -> (2,3)\n                    then z=2+2=4.\n                    r = (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> no extra.\n                    k=3.\n\n                But we need 4.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code (even with the TODO filled) does not work for n=5.\n\n          We must change the last part to add one more when r==0.\n\n          But the last part is not in the TODO. \n\n          How to handle? \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\".

We are to fill the TODO and also there is a missing part at the extra queens.\n\n          How about we output for program2.py:\n\n            We fill the TODO with: \n                x = i\n                break\n\n            and then we replace the last for-loop (which is provided) with the if-else for r.\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code, and in the specified format: a json with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\".\n\n          And for program2.py, we output a string that is the missing code for program2.py.\n\n          The missing code might be the entire else block? or the part from the TODO to the end of the else block? \n\n          But the else block is long.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output only the part that we change: the TODO and then the replacement for the last for-loop.\n\n          But the last for-loop is not missing, it is provided.\n\n          Given the instructions, I think we are only to fill the TODO and not change anything else.\n\n          Then we must live with n=5 not working.\n\n          But the problem says: \"runs correctly\", so it must work for n=5.\n\n          Therefore, I will output for program2.py the entire else block with the fix.\n\n          Steps for the else block:\n\n            else:\n                for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n                    if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n                        x = i\n                        break\n                z = 1\n                for i in range(x):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n                z += x\n                x += 1\n                for i in range(x):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n                z += x\n                r = (n - 2) % 3\n                if r == 0:\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z, z))))\n                else:\n                    for i in range(r):\n                        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + r - i - 1, z + i))))\n\n          This is the entire else block with the last for-loop replaced by the if-else.\n\n          Then for n=5: \n            x0=1, then we do the two diagonals: (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) -> then z=4, r=0, so we add (4,4) -> total=4.\n\n          For n=6: \n            x0: largest i with 3*i+2<=6 -> i= floor((6-2)/3)= floor(4/3)=1 -> 3*1+2=5<=6 -> so x0=1.\n            then n = 3*1+2 + r = 5 + r -> r=1.\n            two diagonals: \n                first: (1,1)\n                second: (3,2), (2,3)\n            then r=1: we add one more: \n                a = z + 1 - 0 - 1 = 4+1-0-1=4, b=4+0=4 -> (4,4)\n            total=4.\n\n            But the minimum k for n=6: (2*6+2)//3 = 14//3=4 (remainder 2) -> 4.5? -> integer floor? -> 14//3=4 in integer division? \n            But (2*6+2)=14, 14//3=4 in integer floor? -> but we need ceil(12/3)=4? -> so 4 is enough.\n\n          For n=6, is 4 enough? -> yes.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the entire else block above.\n\n          But wait, the provided code after the TODO has:\n\n                z = 1\n                for i in range(x):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n                z += x\n                x += 1\n                for i in range(x):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n                z += x\n                for i in range((n - 2) % 3):\n                    ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + (n - 2) % 3 - i - 1, z + i))))\n\n          We are changing the last for-loop to an if-else.\n\n          So we output for program2.py the else block as above.\n\n          But note: the variable `x` is used in the first two for-loops, and then we use `r = (n-2)%3`, and then we use `r` in the if-else.\n\n          We must be cautious: the code after the second diagonal does `z += x` and then we use `z` for the extra queens.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is the else block from the line `for i in range(100000, -1, -1):` to the end of the else block, with the last for-loop replaced by the if-else.\n\n          However, the problem might expect only the TODO part. \n\n          Given the sample provided in the code for n=4 works, and for n=5 we need the fix, and the problem says to run correctly, I will output the fixed else block.\n\n          But note: the provided code has:\n\n                if n <= 2:\n                    ...\n                elif n == 3:\n                    ...\n                else:\n                    ... [we are to fill this block]\n\n          So the entire else block is missing? No, the else block is given but has a TODO and then some code. We are to fill the TODO and also fix the last part? \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can consider the entire else block as a block to be completed.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the completion is the else block as described.\n\n          Let's write it:\n\n else:\n    for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n        if 3 * i + 2 <= n:\n            x = i\n            break\n    z = 1\n    for i in range(x):\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n    z += x\n    x += 1\n    for i in range(x):\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + x - i - 1, z + i))))\n    z += x\n    r = (n - 2) % 3\n    if r == 0:\n        ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z, z))))\n    else:\n        for i in range(r):\n            ans.append(\" \".join(map(str, (z + r - i - 1, z + i))))\n\n Note: the line `x = i` and `break` are the TODO.\n\n For program3.py:\n   The problem: we are allowed to do operations: choose an index i (2<=i<=n) and change a[i] to a[i]-a[i-1]. We can do any number of times. We want to know if we can make a[i]=0 for all i from 2 to n.\n\n   The provided function:\n\n        def diff_ops(arr):\n            result = True\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            return result\n\n   We must fill the TODO.\n\n   How to solve?\n     We work backwards. We want the array to become [a0, 0, 0, ..., 0].\n\n     The operations: \n        We can only change a[i] to a[i]-a[i-1]. This is nonnegative only if a[i]>=a[i-1] at the time of the operation.\n\n     However, we can do operations in any order and any number of times.\n\n     Insight: \n        The final state: \n            arr[0] = some value (unchanged)\n            arr[1] = 0\n            arr[2] = 0\n            ...\n\n        How did we get there? \n          The last operation on position i must have set arr[i] = 0, and just before that, we had arr[i] = arr[i-1] (because 0 = arr[i] - arr[i-1] implies arr[i] = arr[i-1]).\n\n        But then how did we get arr[i-1] to be the value that is then used to set arr[i] to 0? \n\n        We can think greedily backwards: \n          We start from the last element and move to the front.\n\n        However, note the operations can be done in any order and multiple times.\n\n        Another insight: \n          The process is similar to the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n        Let's denote the final goal: \n          We require for i from n-1 down to 1:\n             a[i] = 0.\n\n        How about we simulate backwards from the last element to the first?\n\n          Let b = the array at some step.\n          We can only change an element if it is at least as large as the element to its left.\n\n        But note: the operations can be done in any order. \n\n        Known solution: \n          We can only make a[i]=0 if the entire prefix up to i is zero except possibly the first element, and then we require that the first element is equal to the gcd of the entire prefix? \n\n        Actually, consider:\n\n          We want to make a[1]=0. \n             We can do operations on index1: \n                 a[1] = a[1] - a[0]   -> then a[1] becomes a[1]-a[0]\n                 then again: a[1] = (a[1]-a[0]) - a[0] = a[1]-2*a[0]\n                 ... until it becomes nonnegative.\n\n          This is the Euclidean algorithm for a[1] and a[0]. We can make a[1]=0 if and only if a[0] divides a[1] (and a[0] is positive).\n\n          But then for a[2]: \n             We can do operations on index2: \n                 a[2] = a[2] - a[1]   -> but a[1] is now 0, so a[2] remains a[2].\n                 then we can do: a[2] = a[2] - a[0] (because a[1] is 0, so we can only subtract a[0] repeatedly).\n\n          So to make a[2]=0, we need a[0] divides a[2].\n\n          Similarly, for every i>=1, we will eventually need a[0] to divide a[i].\n\n          But wait, what if we do operations on index2 before index1? \n             Initially: [a0, a1, a2]\n             Operation on index2: a2 = a2 - a1.\n             Then operation on index1: a1 = a1 - a0.\n             Then operation on index2: a2 = (a2 - a1) - (a1 - a0) = a2 - 2*a1 + a0.\n\n          This is complex.\n\n        Alternate known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round 783 (Div. 2), problem B): \n          We can make the array [a0, 0, 0, ...] if and only if:\n             a0 divides a1, a0 divides a2, ..., and also the first element remains a0.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to change a2 only after we have changed a1? \n\n          However, we can do:\n\n            We must be able to make a1=0: which requires that a0 must divide a1? \n            Then after a1=0, we can make a2=0 by repeatedly subtracting a0 (since a1=0, then a2 becomes a2 - k*a0, and we can choose k so that a2 becomes 0 if and only if a0 divides a2).\n\n          But what about a3? similarly, after a1 and a2 are 0, we can make a3=0 by repeatedly subtracting a0.\n\n          However, can we do the operations in any order? \n\n          Consider: \n            [3, 5, 2]\n\n          We want to make a[2]=0 first? \n            Operation on index=3 (if n=3, then i=2? but the array is a0, a1, a2; index2 is the last) -> a2 = a2 - a1 = 2-5 = -3 -> negative, not allowed? because the problem says the array consists of positive integers, and during operations the values might become nonnegative? or can they be negative? \n\n          The problem says: \"You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers.\" and the operation: change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. \n\n          The operation might make a_i become negative? The problem does not restrict to nonnegative. But the initial integers are positive, and during the operations, we might get negatives.\n\n          The problem does not say we cannot have negatives. So negatives are allowed.\n\n          Then for [3,5,2]:\n            We can do:\n              i=2: a2 = 2-5 = -3 -> [3,5,-3]\n              i=2: a2 = -3 - 5 = -8\n              ... we can keep subtracting 5 (which is a1) but a1 is still 5.\n\n          But then how to make a1=0? \n            a1 = 5 - 3 = 2 -> [3,2,-8]\n            a1 = 2-3 = -1 -> [3,-1,-8]\n            a2 = -8 - (-1) = -7\n            ... it seems messy.\n\n          Known solution from a similar problem (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1629/B): not the same.\n\n          Another known problem: \n            \"Target\" \n            We start from an array and want to get to [x,0,0,...,0] by repeatedly replacing an element a_i (i>=1) by a_i - a_{i-1].\n\n          It is known that the only value that can appear in the first element at the end is the gcd of the entire array.\n\n          But in our case, we want the first element to remain unchanged? \n\n          The problem: \n            \"Is it possible to make a_i=0 for all 2<=i<=n\"\n\n          Note: a0 can be any value, we don't require a0=0.\n\n          And the operations: we can only change a_i for i>=2.\n\n          But wait, the operation can be applied to i=2, then i=2 becomes a2 - a1. Then we can apply to i=2 again: becomes (a2 - a1) - a1 = a2 - 2*a1, or we can apply to i=3 if exists, or we can apply to i=2 after changing a1? \n\n          We can also change a1: by applying to i=1? \n\n          The operation: choose an index i (2<=i<=n) -> wait, the first operation index is 2? not 1? \n\n          The problem says: \"choose an index i (2<=i<=n)\", so we cannot change a1? \n\n          Then the first element a0 is fixed, and a1 is fixed? \n\n          But then how to make a1=0? we cannot change a1.\n\n          The problem: \"Is it possible to make a_i=0 for all 2<=i<=n\"\n\n          So we don't require a1=0? \n\n          Let me re-read: \"change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\" for i in [2, n]. And we want a_i=0 for all i in [2, n].\n\n          We do not require a1=0.\n\n          Example: \n            Input: [5, 10] -> we can only change index2: a2 = 10 - 5 = 5, then again: a2 = 5-5=0. So we can.\n\n            Input: [1, 2, 3] -> \n                We can change index3: a3 = 3-2=1 -> [1,2,1]\n                Then change index2: a2 = 2-1=1 -> [1,1,1]\n                Then change index3: a3=1-1=0 -> [1,1,0]\n                Then change index2: a2=1-1=0 -> [1,0,0]\n\n          So we can.\n\n          But note: we are not required to make a1=0.\n\n          Therefore, the condition: \n            We can make a2=0, a3=0, ..., a_{n-1}=0.\n\n          How to make a2=0? \n            We can do operations on index2: \n               a2 = a2 - a1\n               then a2 = (a2 - a1) - a1 = a2 - 2*a1\n               then a2 = a2 - 3*a1, etc.\n            But also, we can change a1 by doing operations on index2 after we change a2? \n\n          Actually, note: once we change a2, then we can use the new a2 to change a3? and then come back to a2.\n\n          However, the operations can be done in any order and any number of times.\n\n          Insight: \n            The entire array from a1 to a_{n-1} can be reduced to any nonnegative linear combination of the initial values? \n\n          This is complex.\n\n          Known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round 781 (Div. 2), problem C): \n            We can make the array [a0, a1, 0, 0, ...] if and only if a0 = gcd(a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1})? \n\n          But note: we are not making a1=0.\n\n          Let me denote the array as [x0, x1, x2, ..., x_{n-1}].\n\n          We want to make x2, x3, ... all 0.\n\n          The operations: \n             We can replace x_i by x_i - x_{i-1} for i>=2.\n\n          This is equivalent to: we can add any multiple of x_{i-1} to x_i? because we can do:\n\n             x_i = x_i - k * x_{i-1}   by doing k operations on index i (without any other operations in between).\n\n          But then we can also change x_{i-1} by operations on index i-1? \n\n          We can use the Euclidean algorithm across the array.\n\n          The goal: we want to make x2=0, x3=0, ... . \n\n          We can use the following: \n            We can make x2 = x2 mod x1, by repeatedly subtracting x1 (if we don't change x1).\n            But we can also change x1 by using x0? -> we cannot change x1 because we cannot operate on index1.\n\n          Therefore, x1 is fixed.\n\n          Similarly, x0 is fixed.\n\n          Then for x2: we can make x2 become x2 mod x1 (by Euclidean algorithm) and then if we can make it 0, then we require that x1 divides x2.\n\n          For x3: we can make it become x3 mod x2, but wait, we can also use x1? because after we make x2 become 0, then for x3 we can only use x2 (which is 0) -> then we cannot change x3 anymore? \n\n          But note: we can do operations in any order. We might do:\n\n            First, for x3: we can make x3 = x3 - k * x2, but if we haven't changed x2 yet, then x2 is the initial x2.\n\n          However, after we change x2, it becomes x2 - some multiple of x1. So the value of x2 becomes a linear combination of the initial x1 and x2.\n\n          In fact, the entire array from index1 to the end can be reduced to a basis: the gcd of the entire array from a0 to a_{n-1} might be the invariant.\n\n          Known solution from a recent contest: \n            Problem B: https://codeforces.com/contest/1629/problem/B\n            Not the same.\n\n          Another known problem: \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1459/problem/A\n\n          Not the same.\n\n          After research, a known solution for this exact problem (from Codeforces Round 783 (Div. 2), problem B): \n            We can do the operations if and only if the initial array has the property that the gcd of the entire array (or specifically the gcd of the prefix up to i) divides the next element.\n\n          Specifically: \n            Let g = a0\n            For i in range(1, n):\n                g = gcd(g, a[i])\n                if g != gcd(a0, a[i])? \n\n          Actually, the solution: \n            It is possible if and only if for every i from 0 to n-1, the element a[i] is divisible by a0.\n\n          But wait, in the example: [5,10] -> 10 is divisible by 5 -> works.\n          [1,2,3]: \n             2 is divisible by 1 -> yes.\n             3 is divisible by 1 -> yes.\n\n          But consider: [2, 3] -> \n             We can do: \n                 a1 = 3 - 2 = 1 -> [2,1]\n                 then a1 = 1 - 2 = -1 -> [2,-1] -> then we can do: a1 = -1 - 2 = -3 -> ... we never get 0.\n\n          But the condition: 3 is not divisible by 2? -> so it fails.\n\n          However, the known solution: \n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                g = a[0]\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    g = math.gcd(g, a[i])\n                if g == a[0]:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n          But this is for a different problem.\n\n          Another known solution from a editorial for the exact problem (Educational Codeforces Round 127 (Rated for Div. 2), problem B): \n            We can make the changes if and only if the entire array is already in non-decreasing order? \n\n          Not likely.\n\n          Insight from the operation: \n            We can only change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. This means that the value of a_i after any number of operations is a linear combination of the initial values with integer coefficients. Specifically, it is an integer linear combination of a0, a1, ... , a_{i-1].\n\n          To have a_i become 0, we require that 0 is in the module generated by a0, a1, ... , a_{i-1]. \n\n          But the module is the ideal generated by the gcd of a0, a1, ... , a_{i-1]. And 0 is always in it. But we require nonnegative coefficients? \n\n          However, we can do any number of operations, so we can subtract as long as the value is>=0? or can we go negative? \n\n          The problem does not restrict to nonnegative. So we can go negative. Therefore, the condition is that the gcd of a0, a1, ... , a_{i-1] must divide a_i.\n\n          But note: we are not required to make a1=0, so a1 can be nonzero. \n\n          For each i from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed, so a_i is at index i), we require that the gcd of the prefix a0, a1, ... , a_{i-1] divides a_i.\n\n          Why? \n            For i=1: we want to make a1 eventually become 0? -> no, we don't require a1=0. \n            For i=2: we want to make a2=0. \n               The operations on index2: we can change a2 to a2 - k * a1 - l * a0? \n               But wait, we can also change a1 by operations on index2? -> no, because to change a1 we would need to operate on index1, but we cannot. \n\n          Actually, we cannot change a1 at all! because the operation is only for i>=2. \n\n          Therefore, a1 is fixed. \n\n          Similarly, a0 is fixed.\n\n          For a2: we can only change a2 by subtracting multiples of a1. \n             So a2 must be divisible by gcd(a0, a1)? \n\n          But note: we can also use a0? \n             How? \n                We can do: \n                   a2 = a2 - a1   -> then a2 becomes a2 - a1.\n                   then a2 = (a2 - a1) - a0   -> is that allowed? \n                But to subtract a0, we would need to have a1 become a0? \n\n          We cannot change a1. So the only values we can subtract from a2 are multiples of a1. \n\n          Therefore, to make a2=0, we require that a1 divides a2.\n\n          For a3: \n             We can change a3 by subtracting a2 (which is now 0) or a1? \n             But after we make a2=0, then for a3, we can only subtract a2 (which is 0) -> so we cannot change a3 anymore. \n             Therefore, we must make a3=0 before we change a2? \n\n          But we can do operations in any order. \n             We can do on a3 first: \n                 a3 = a3 - a2   (but a2 is not changed yet) -> then a3 becomes a3 - a2.\n                 then we can do on a2: a2 = a2 - a1.\n                 then on a3: a3 = (a3 - a2) - a1 = a3 - a2 - a1.\n\n          However, note: when we do an operation on a3, we subtract the current a2, which might be the initial a2 or a changed a2.\n\n          In fact, the value we subtract from a3 is the current a2, which might be the initial a2 or the initial a2 - k * a1.\n\n          Therefore, the value of a3 after any number of operations is a3 - (some multiple of a1) - (some multiple of the initial a2).\n\n          To make a3=0, we require that a3 is in the module generated by a1 and a2. \n             This is the ideal generated by gcd(a1, a2). \n\n          But note: a0 is also there? we might be able to use a0? \n             For a2: we can only use a1 and a0? \n                a2 = a2 - k * a1 - l * a0? \n             How to get a0 into a2? \n                We can do: \n                   a2 = a2 - a1   -> a2 = a2 - a1.\n                   then a2 = a2 - a0   -> but wait, to do that we would need to have a1 become a0? \n                But we cannot change a1.\n\n          Therefore, a0 can only be used if it appears in a1? \n\n          Actually, we cannot use a0 in the subtraction for a2 because the operation for a2 is a2 - a1, and a1 is not changed. \n\n          So for a2, we can only subtract multiples of a1. \n\n          For a3: we can subtract multiples of a1 and multiples of the initial a2. \n             But note: the initial a2 might not be divisible by gcd(a0,a1)? \n\n          This is complex.\n\n          Known solution from an editorial for the exact problem (Educational Codeforces Round 127, problem B): \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1671/problem/B\n            not the same.\n\n          After research, the solution for the exact problem (from a contest): \n            We can do it if and only if for every i from 0 to n-1, the element a[i] is divisible by a[0].\n\n          But consider: \n            [3, 5] -> \n                a0=3, a1=5 -> 5 is not divisible by 3 -> should be \"NO\", and indeed we cannot make a1=0? but we are not required to make a1=0, only a2, a3,... and here n=2, so we only have to make a1=0? -> no, for n=2, we have to make a1=0? \n                The problem: for i from 2 to n, we want a_i=0. For n=2, there is no i>=2? -> then it is vacuously true? \n\n          The problem: \"a_i=0 for all 2<=i<=n\", and for n=2, there is no i in [2,2]? -> the array has indices 0-indexed: a0, a1. We only require for i=2? which is out of bounds.\n\n          The problem says: the array has length n, and we are to make a_i=0 for i from 2 to n. In 0-indexed, that would be indices 1 to n-1? \n\n          But the example: \n            Input: \"2 5\" -> n=2, array=[5,10] -> then we require a2=0? but the array only has two elements: a1 and a2? \n\n          The indexing in the problem: \n            The array is a1, a2, ..., a_n.\n\n          In the input: \n            The first integer is n (>=2), then n integers: a1, a2, ..., an.\n\n          And we want to make a_i=0 for i from 2 to n -> that is, a2, a3, ... , an.\n\n          In the example n=2: we want a2=0.\n\n          Therefore, for n=2, we have to make the second element (which is a2) become 0.\n\n          In the provided example: [5,10] -> we can.\n\n          For [3,5] (n=2): \n             a1=3, a2=5.\n             We can only change index2: a2 = 5 - 3 = 2.\n             then a2 = 2-3 = -1.\n             then a2 = -1-3 = -4 -> never 0.\n\n          Therefore, [3,5] is \"NO\".\n\n          So the condition: for i>=1 (0-indexed, the elements from index1 to the end) must be divisible by a0.\n\n          But consider [2, 3, 6] (n=3): \n             a0=2, a1=3, a2=6.\n             We want to make a2=0.\n             We cannot change a1.\n             For a2: we can do:\n                 a2 = 6 - 3 = 3.\n                 a2 = 3 - 3 = 0. -> works.\n\n          Here, 3 is not divisible by 2, but we did it.\n\n          What's the difference? \n             In the operation for a2, we are allowed to use a1 (which is 3) and then later use the same a1 (which is 3) again.\n\n          But note: after the first operation, a2 becomes 3, and then we can do it again: a2 = 3 - 3 = 0.\n\n          So the condition might be: for each i from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed), a0 must divide a_i? -> \n             For [2,3,6]: \n                 i=1: a1=3 -> 2 does not divide 3 -> fails.\n\n          But the example worked.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is not that.\n\n          Another try: \n             We can make a_i=0 for i>=1 (0-indexed) if and only if a0 divides a_i? \n             For [2,3,6]: \n                 a0=2, a1=3 -> 2 does not divide 3 -> fails, but we don't require a1=0.\n\n          We only require a2=0 (0-indexed a2) for n=3.\n\n          So the condition might be: for i>=1, the element a_i must be divisible by a0, but for [2,3,6] we have a2=6 which is divisible by 2, and we don't care about a1.\n\n          Then the condition: for i from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed), a0 must divide a_i? \n             [2,3,6]: a0=2, a1=3 -> 2 does not divide 3 -> should be \"NO\", but we did it.\n\n          How did we do it? \n             We used a1=3 to reduce a2=6 to 3, then to 0. But a1=3 is not divisible by 2, and we used it.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is not that.\n\n          Insight: \n            The operations allow us to effectively reduce a_i by any linear combination of the values to its left, but the values to its left might change.\n\n          This is very complex.\n\n          Known solution from a recent contest (Codeforces Round 785 (Div. 2), problem B): \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1673/problem/B\n\n          Not the same.\n\n          After reading a known solution for the exact problem (with the exact name), we found:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                if arr[i] % arr[0] != 0:\n                    return False\n            return True\n\n          But then [2,3,6] would be: \n             3 % 2 = 1 !=0 -> False -> \"NO\", but it should be \"YES\".\n\n          Therefore, that is not the solution.\n\n          Another known solution:\n\n            if n==2: \n                return True   # because we can always reduce a1 to 0 by repeatedly subtracting a0? \n            else:\n                for i in range(2, n):\n                    if arr[i] % math.gcd(arr[i-2], arr[i-1]) != 0:\n                        return False\n                return True\n\n          This is also not.\n\n          After re-thinking: \n            We can simulate from the back. \n              We want an=0.\n                 an must be reduced by an-1, so at the step before, an must be at least an-1, and then we do an = an - an-1.\n              But then we can also do it multiple times.\n\n          This is not efficient for n up to 100.\n\n          Given the small n (<=100), we can try a DFS/BFS? but 100 is small but the numbers are up to 10^9.\n\n          Insight from the editorial of a recent contest (Codeforces Round 783, problem B): \n            The only values that can appear in the array are linear combinations of the initial values. Specifically, the value in position i is in the module generated by the initial values of the prefix.\n\n          To have the final value in position i be 0, we require that 0 is in the module, which is always true, but we require nonnegative coefficients during the process?
