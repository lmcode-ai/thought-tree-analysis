For program1.py:\n The problem: We are given an array of 0s and 1s. We can do operations that remove an element and add its value to another element. We want the minimum number of operations to make the array non-decreasing. Observation: \n The operations allow us to remove an element and add it to another. Note that we can only remove elements and we are allowed to make numbers greater than 1. After reading the note: \n Example: [0,1,0,0,1] -> by moving the 1 at index0 (value 1) to the last element (index4) we get [0,0,1,2] (non-decreasing). Another example: [1,0] -> we can move the 0 to the 1? But note: the operation: choose two indices i and j (i != j), add a[i] to a[j], then remove a[i]. So if we have [1,0] and we choose i=1 (0-indexed: a[1]=0) and j=0, then we add 0 to a[0] -> a[0] becomes 1, then remove a[1] -> [1]. So that's one operation. How to solve?",

So the minimal operations is the number of ones in the zero segment (which is the same as the number of zeros in the positive segment).

Then we check if i==j? i=3, j=2 -> no? then we swap arr[3] and arr[2] -> but that would swap 1 and 0? and then count becomes 2? which is not correct. So we must adjust i and j after the swap?

Second inner: arr[1]=0 -> break (so j remains 1). Then swap: [0,1] -> count=1. Then we go back to the outer while. Then first inner: i=0: arr[0]=0 -> so we enter the else -> TODO: what? We must do something to break out of the inner while? So we must adjust i in the else? The intended code for the else in the first inner while is to move i forward? So we do: \n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n   Then in the example [1,0] after the swap we have [0,1]. Then in the next outer iteration:\n        First inner: i=0: arr[0]=0 -> so we do i+=1 -> now i=1. Then condition: i==j? j is 1 -> so break the inner while (because i==j? condition in the if: if arr[i]==1 or i==j -> i==j -> break). Then second inner: j=1: condition: arr[1]=1 -> not zero, so we do j-=1 -> j=0. Then condition: j==i? i=1 and j=0 -> no? then check: arr[0]=0 -> break? because condition: if arr[j]==0 -> true? so break. Then we check if i==j? i=1, j=0 -> no? then we swap arr[1] and arr[0] -> becomes [1,0] -> and count becomes 2 -> which is wrong. So we must break the outer loop when we have swapped and then we have moved the pointers? Actually, the typical solution is to move the pointers after the swap. Therefore, we should add after the swap and count increment:\n\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1 But the code doesn't have that. So we must add that?

But then we get stuck? Alternatively, we can break out of the inner while loops and then the outer loop will break when i==j?

Given the above, I will output for program1.py:\n\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n        and then after the swap and count increment, we add:\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1 So the missing code for program1.py is two parts. We can output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n    i += 1\\n    j -= 1\"\n\n   But note: the first part is in the else and the second part is after the swap. In the program, the else block is at one place and the other two lines are at another. How to represent? We output the string that includes both missing parts? Alternatively, the problem might allow us to output the entire fixed program1.py? But it says only the missing code. I think we should output the code for the TODO and then the code for the other missing part. Since the TODO is in the else, and the other part is after the swap, we can output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   and then in the program, we put the first line in the else and the next two after the swap. But that would be:\n\n        else:\n            i += 1   # from the first line of the string\n        ... later ...\n        count += 1\n        i += 1   # from the second line\n        j -= 1   # from the third line This is what we want. Therefore, for program1.py, we output: \"i += 1\\n i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   But note: the provided code has an indentation of 8 spaces for the else block. We must preserve that. The first \"i += 1\" should be at the same indentation as the else, and the next two should be at the same indentation as the swap. In the string, we use \"\\n        \" to represent the new line and then 8 spaces. So for program1.py: \"i += 1\\n i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   Now, for program2.py:\n\n   The problem: Given a perfect binary tree of depth n (so total nodes = 2^n - 1), and a string s of length 2^n-1 (the characters on the nodes), we can swap the left and right child of any non-leaf node any number of times. We want the number of distinct preorder strings. The provided code:\n\n        def dfs(i):\n            if i >= m: return (1, '')\n            ln, ls = dfs(i * 2)\n            rn, rs = dfs(i * 2 + 1) ln = ln % mod\n            rn = rn % mod\n            if ls < rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, ls + s[i - 1] + rs\n            elif ls > rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, rs + s[i - 1] + ls\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   Explanation:",

If the string has length a and distinct letters b, and a==b, then it's of the form \"abc...\". In any substring, the frequency of any two letters is at most 1, and the difference is at most 1? Example: \"ab\" -> frequencies: a:1, b:1 -> difference 0. Example: \"abc\" -> any substring: \"a\": (1,0,0), \"ab\": (1,1,0) -> difference between a and b is 0, between a and c is 1 (if we consider the substring \"ab\", then c is 0, so difference between a and c is 1) -> but wait, the condition is for any two characters u and v that are present in the entire string. In the substring \"ab\", the characters present are 'a' and 'b'. The frequency of 'a' is 1, 'b' is 1, and 'c' is 0. But the condition says: \"u and v are characters present in s\" (the entire string) -> so in the substring \"ab\", we must consider u and v that are in the entire string, but are they present in the substring? The problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\", but does that mean they must be present in the substring?",

In the string \"abc\", consider the substring \"ab\": \n            u='a', v='c': frequency in t: a:1, c:0 -> difference 1 -> okay. u='b', v='c': 1 and 0 -> difference 1 -> okay. u='a', v='b': 1 and 1 -> difference 0 -> okay.

In the substring \"aa\" (which doesn't exist in \"abc\") -> but wait, \"abc\" has no \"aa\", so we don't care. Therefore, \"abc\" is YES. Now, what about a string like \"aab\": \n            distinct letters: 2, length=3. Check substring \"aa\": \n                u='a', v='b': in the entire string, so we consider: frequency of 'a'=2, 'b'=0 -> difference 2 -> not allowed. So \"aab\" is not perfectly balanced.

It is iterating i from 1 to a-1. If the character at position i is in the substring s[:i] (the previous characters), then it forms a repeated letter? Then it constructs w = (s[:i] repeated enough times to have length a). If s equals w, then print \"YES\", else ... TODO and break. Example: s = \"abcabc\" -> i=0 to ... \n            i=1: s[1]='b' in s[:1]=\"a\"? -> no.\n            i=2: s[2]='c' in \"ab\"? -> no.\n            i=3: s[3]='a' in \"abc\" -> yes. then w = (\"abc\" repeated) -> \"abcabc\" -> equals s -> print \"YES\". But is \"abcabc\" perfectly balanced? Consider substring \"abca\": \n                frequency: a:2, b:1, c:1 -> \n                difference between a and b: 1 -> okay. between a and c: 1 -> okay. between b and c: 0 -> okay. Consider substring \"aa\" (which appears as s[0] and s[3]? but not contiguous? contiguous substring: s[0:2]=\"ab\", s[0:3]=\"abc\", s[3:5]=\"ab\", ...) There is no contiguous \"aa\". But what about \"aab\"? \n            i=1: s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> yes. then w = (s[:1] repeated) = \"a\"*3 = \"aaa\" -> s=\"aab\" ! = \"aaa\", so it will go to the else. In the else, we must print \"NO\" for \"aab\", because we know it's not perfectly balanced. Therefore, the TODO in the else is: print(\"NO\") But wait, is that sufficient? The code breaks out of the for loop after the first i where s[i] is in s[:i]. What if there is a later i that might make it periodic? Example: \"aabaab\" -> \n            i=1: 'a' in \"a\" -> yes.\n            w = \"a\"*6 = \"aaaaaa\" -> not equal to \"aabaab\", so we print \"NO\" and break. But is \"aabaab\" perfectly balanced? Consider the substring \"aab\" (the first three): \n                a:2, b:1 -> difference between a and b is 1 -> okay. Consider the substring \"aa\" (positions0-1): \n                a:2, b:0 -> difference between a and b is 2 -> not okay. So it should be \"NO\", which matches. But what about a string that is not periodic but still not perfectly balanced? Example: \"aab\" -> we catch it at i=1. What about \"abac\"? \n            i=0: skip.\n            i=1: 'b' in \"a\"? no.\n            i=2: 'a' in \"ab\"? yes. w = (s[:2]=\"ab\" repeated to length 4) -> \"abab\" -> s=\"abac\" ! = \"abab\", so we print \"NO\". But is \"abac\" perfectly balanced? Consider the substring \"aba\": \n                a:2, b:1 -> difference 1 -> okay. Consider the substring \"abac\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> differences: a and b:1, a and c:1, b and c:0 -> okay. Consider the substring \"aa\" (positions0 and 2): not contiguous? The contiguous substring \"aa\" does not exist. However, the contiguous substring from index0 to index2 is \"aba\", which has a:2, b:1 -> difference 1. But wait, the substring \"a\" (which is 'a' at index0) and then the substring 'a' at index2: For the substring \"aa\" (contiguous? the problem says: substring is contiguous) -> there is no contiguous \"aa\" in \"abac\". The only contiguous substring that has two a's is \"aba\" (which has two a's) and \"aca\" (which is not contiguous? \"abac\" has: \"a\",\"ab\",\"aba\",\"abac\",\"b\",\"ba\",\"bac\",\"a\",\"ac\",\"c\") -> no \"aca\" because not contiguous. So \"abac\" might be perfectly balanced. But the code outputs \"NO\", which is not correct. Therefore, the provided approach is not sufficient.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: We are given an array of 0s and 1s. We can do operations that remove an element and add its value to another element. We want the minimum number of operations to make the array non-decreasing.\n\n Observation: \n The operations allow us to remove an element and add it to another. Note that we can only remove elements and we are allowed to make numbers greater than 1.\n\n After reading the note: \n Example: [0,1,0,0,1] -> by moving the 1 at index0 (value 1) to the last element (index4) we get [0,0,1,2] (non-decreasing). \n\n Another example: [1,0] -> we can move the 0 to the 1? But note: the operation: choose two indices i and j (i != j), add a[i] to a[j], then remove a[i]. So if we have [1,0] and we choose i=1 (0-indexed: a[1]=0) and j=0, then we add 0 to a[0] -> a[0] becomes 1, then remove a[1] -> [1]. So that's one operation.\n\n How to solve?\n We note that the non-decreasing array must have all zeros first and then ones and then possibly some numbers greater than one (which are formed by adding ones). However, we can also have zeros at the beginning and then numbers that are at least 1 (but note: non-decreasing means we can have [0,0,1,2] but not [0,1,0]).\n\n The key: We want to have all zeros at the beginning and then non-zeros. But note: we can have zeros in the middle? Actually, no: because if we have a zero after a positive number, that breaks non-decreasing. So the array must be: [zeros, then positive numbers (which are at least 1)].\n\n How many operations? Each operation removes one element. We start with n elements and we end with n - (number of operations) elements. But note: we are allowed to merge ones. However, we cannot remove zeros? Actually, we can: we can remove a zero by moving it to another element? But note: moving a zero to another element doesn't change the value of the other element (because adding 0). So why would we remove a zero? Actually, we don't need to: we can leave zeros in the array. However, the problem is that we might have a one that is too early and a zero that is too late.\n\n The idea: \n We want to have all zeros at the beginning and then ones (or numbers formed by ones). The problem is when we have a one that comes before a zero. We can fix that by moving the one to a later position (which is a zero or a one) and then we remove the one from its current position. But note: we can also move a zero from a later position to an earlier one? But that doesn't help because then we have a zero in the middle of ones? Actually, we are allowed to do any number of operations arbitrarily.\n\n Alternate approach (from known solutions for similar problems):\n We can note that the only problem is the inversion: a one that comes before a zero. We can fix each such inversion by moving the one to the end (or to a zero that is at the end). But note: we can fix multiple inversions with one operation? Actually, one operation removes one element (the one that is in the wrong place) and adds it to a later element. So each operation can fix one inversion? But note: if we have multiple ones at the beginning, we can move them all to the same last element? However, each operation moves one element.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of operations is the number of ones that are in the \"zero\" part? But note: after we move a one from the left to the right, the zeros that were after that one might become before the one we moved? Actually, we can think greedily:\n\n We want the array to be: [zeros, then ones (or numbers built from ones)].\n\n So we can count the total zeros and ones. Then the final array should have the first (count0) elements as zeros and the rest as positive (at least 1). \n\n How many operations? We don't need to move zeros. We only need to move the ones that are in the zero segment? Actually, if we have a one in the first count0 positions, then we must move it. But note: we can also leave a one in the zero segment if we move it to the positive segment? Actually, we can move a one from the zero segment to the positive segment. So the minimal operations is the number of ones that are in the initial zero segment? \n\n However, what if we have zeros in the positive segment? We don't need to move them? Actually, if we have a zero in the positive segment, that breaks non-decreasing? So we must also move zeros that are in the positive segment? But note: we can move a zero from the positive segment to the zero segment? But that doesn't help because then we are adding a zero to a zero? and then we remove the zero from the positive segment. But that operation doesn't change the value of the element in the zero segment (it remains zero). So we can move zeros from the positive segment to the zero segment? However, we can also leave the zeros in the positive segment? Actually, no: because then we have a zero after a positive number? which is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, we must have all zeros at the beginning and then non-zeros. So we must move:\n   - All ones that are in the zero segment (the first count0 positions) to the positive segment.\n   - All zeros that are in the positive segment (the last n - count0 positions) to the zero segment.\n\n But note: we can swap a one in the zero segment and a zero in the positive segment with one operation? Actually, we can do one operation to move the one (from the zero segment) to the positive segment (by adding it to an element in the positive segment) and then we remove the one from the zero segment. Similarly, we can move a zero from the positive segment to the zero segment? But note: moving a zero doesn't change the value of the target. However, we don't need to move zeros because we can simply remove them? But if we remove a zero from the positive segment, we are left with one less element. And then we have to account for the fact that we are reducing the size.\n\n However, note: we can also move a one from the zero segment to a zero in the positive segment? Then that zero becomes one? and we remove the one from the zero segment. Then we have fixed both: the zero in the positive segment becomes one (so it's now in the positive segment and non-zero) and we removed the one from the zero segment. So one operation fixes both.\n\n Therefore, the minimal operations is the number of ones in the zero segment (which is the same as the number of zeros in the positive segment? because the total ones in the entire array is fixed, and the zero segment has count0 positions, so the ones in the zero segment is the same as the zeros missing in the zero segment? Actually, the zero segment should be all zeros. The number of zeros in the zero segment is (count0 - (number of ones in the zero segment))? and the zeros in the positive segment is (total zeros - zeros in the zero segment) = (count0 - (count0 - ones_in_zero_seg)) = ones_in_zero_seg?).\n\n So the minimal operations is the number of ones in the zero segment (which is the same as the number of zeros in the positive segment).\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n   total_zeros = count of zeros in the entire array\n   Then the zero segment is the first total_zeros elements. Count the number of ones in the first total_zeros elements. That is the answer.\n\n But note: the example [0,1,0,0,1] (n=5, total_zeros=3). The first 3 elements: [0,1,0] -> has one one. So answer=1 -> matches.\n\n Another example: [1,0] -> total_zeros=1. The first 1 element: [1] -> has one one. So answer=1 -> matches.\n\n Example: [0,0,1,1] -> already non-decreasing: total_zeros=2. The first 2 elements: [0,0] -> ones=0 -> answer=0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the code for program1.py:\n\n We are reading t test cases. For each test case:\n   n = int(next(tokens))\n   arr = list of n integers\n\n   total_zeros = arr.count(0)   # but note: the array might be large, but total n over test cases <= 200000, so it's okay.\n\n   Then we need to count the number of ones in the first total_zeros elements.\n\n   However, note: the example [1,0] -> total_zeros=1, then the first 1 element is [1] -> count ones=1 -> answer=1.\n\n   But the code provided has a while loop that uses two pointers? \n\n Let me look at the provided code:\n\n   tokens = (token for token in sys.stdin.read().split())\n   N = int(next(tokens))\n   for i in range(N):\n     Q = int(next(tokens))\n     arr = []\n     count = 0\n     for i in range(Q):\n        arr.append(int(next(tokens)))\n     i = 0\n     j = len(arr) - 1\n     while True:\n        while True:\n          if arr[i] == 1 or i == j:\n            break\n          else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        while True:\n          if arr[j] == 0 or j == i:\n            break\n          else:\n            j-=1\n        if i == j:\n          break\n        sec = arr[i]\n        arr [i] = arr[j]\n        arr [j] = sec\n        count += 1\n     print (count)\n\n The provided code uses two pointers: \n   i starts at the beginning and moves until it finds a 1? Actually, the inner while loop for i: \n        while True:\n          if arr[i] == 1 or i == j: break\n          else: ... \n\n   So if arr[i] is 0, then it does ... what? The TODO is there.\n\n   Similarly, j moves from the end until it finds a 0? \n\n   Then if i and j haven't met, it swaps arr[i] and arr[j] and increases count by 1.\n\n   This is similar to the two-pointer technique for partitioning. It is trying to fix the array by swapping a misplaced 1 (at the front) with a misplaced 0 (at the back). But note: the operation in the problem is not a swap. However, note that we can simulate moving a one from the front to the back by swapping? But the problem operation is: remove a[i] and add it to a[j]. That is not a swap. \n\n   But observe: if we have a one at i and a zero at j, then we can do:\n        operation: choose i and j -> then we remove a[i] (which is 1) and add it to a[j] (which becomes 0+1=1). Then the array becomes: we remove the element at i and the element at j becomes 1. \n\n   However, the array size reduces by one. But in the provided code, we are swapping and then the next iteration we are still using the same array of the same size? \n\n   This does not match the problem. \n\n   Alternatively, note that the problem says: we can do the operation arbitrarily many times and we want the minimum number of operations. The known solution is: count the number of ones in the first total_zeros elements. \n\n   But the provided code structure is using two pointers and swapping. How does that relate?\n\n   Actually, we can think: each swap in the two-pointer method is equivalent to one operation? But note: the operation doesn't swap, it moves. However, if we move a one from the front to the back, we are effectively removing that one and then we don't care about that position anymore? But the two-pointer method in the code does:\n\n        It moves i until it finds a one (or meets j). Then moves j until it finds a zero (or meets i). Then if they haven't met, it swaps the one and the zero. Then increments count.\n\n   Why is that the same as the minimal operations? Because each swap fixes one misplaced one and one misplaced zero? So the number of swaps is the number of ones in the zero segment (which is the same as the number of zeros in the positive segment). \n\n   Therefore, the provided code is using a two-pointer swap to count the number of mismatches. \n\n   What should we put in the TODO? \n\n   In the inner while loop for i: \n        while True:\n          if arr[i] == 1 or i == j: break\n          else:\n            # We are at a zero? Then we can skip? because we want to find a one in the zero segment.\n            i += 1   # because we are at a zero and that is okay? so we move to the next.\n\n   Similarly, for j: \n        while True:\n          if arr[j] == 0 or j == i: break\n          else:\n            j -= 1   # because we are at a one in the positive segment? that is okay? so we move left until we find a zero.\n\n   Then if we haven't met, we swap and count.\n\n   Example: [0,1,0,0,1] \n        Initially: i=0, j=4.\n        First inner while: at i=0: arr[0]=0 -> so we do i+=1 -> now i=1. Then arr[1]=1 -> break.\n        Second inner while: at j=4: arr[4]=1 -> not zero, so j-=1 -> j=3: arr[3]=0 -> break.\n        Then swap arr[1] and arr[3]: becomes [0,0,0,1,1] -> then count=1.\n        Then we set i=1, j=3 -> then in the first inner while: i=1: arr[1]=0 -> then we do i+=1 -> i=2 -> then i=2: arr[2]=0 -> i+=1 -> i=3 -> then condition: i==j? yes, so break the inner while. Then the outer condition: i==j -> break. Then print count=1.\n\n   But note: after the swap, we don't adjust i and j? Actually, we break the inner loops and then swap and then the next iteration of the outer while? The outer while is a while True, so we go again.\n\n   However, after the swap, we have:\n        i=1, j=3 -> then we break the inner loops and then swap? Actually, we break the inner loops and then swap? Then we do i and j remain? Then we break the outer loop? Actually, no: we break the inner loops, then we check if i==j? not (1 and 3) -> then we swap and then we do nothing to i and j? Then we go to the next iteration of the outer while.\n\n   Then in the next iteration:\n        We start with i=1, j=3.\n        First inner while: i=1 -> arr[1]=0 -> so we do i+=1 -> i=2 -> then arr[2]=0 -> i+=1 -> i=3 -> then condition: i==j -> break inner while.\n        Then second inner while: j=3 -> arr[3]=1 -> not zero, so j-=1 -> j=2 -> then condition: j==i? because i=3 and j=2 -> no? then check arr[2]=0 -> break.\n        Then we check if i==j? i=3, j=2 -> no? then we swap arr[3] and arr[2] -> but that would swap 1 and 0? and then count becomes 2? which is not correct.\n\n   So we must adjust i and j after the swap? Actually, we don't need to because the swap fixed the positions at i and j. Then we should move i and j? \n\n   The typical two-pointer for partitioning: after swapping, we move i forward and j backward.\n\n   Therefore, we should add:\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\n   But note: the code doesn't have that. So we must add that in the TODO? Actually, the TODO is only in the else of the first inner while. \n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust the pointers after the swap.\n\n   However, the provided code does not have that. So we must complete the inner while loops.\n\n   The inner while loop for i: \n        We want to find the next one in the zero segment? Actually, we want to find a one that is in the zero segment? But the zero segment is the first total_zeros elements? But we don't know total_zeros? \n\n   But note: the two pointers are moving from the ends. The idea is: \n        We want to have zeros at the front and ones at the back. So we want to find a one that is at the front (which should be moved) and a zero that is at the back (which should be moved). \n\n   Therefore, the inner while for i: we want to skip zeros (because they are okay) until we find a one? Then we break. Similarly, for j: we want to skip ones (because they are okay at the back) until we find a zero? \n\n   So the TODO for the first inner while loop: \n        else: # meaning arr[i] is 0? then we can move i forward?\n            i += 1\n\n   Similarly, for the second inner while loop: \n        else: # meaning arr[j] is 1? then we can move j backward?\n            j -= 1\n\n   Then after we break the inner loops, we check if i and j are the same? if not, we swap and count, and then we must also move the pointers? \n\n   But note: after swapping, the element at i becomes zero (which is okay for the front) and the element at j becomes one (which is okay for the back). Then we can move both pointers? \n\n   So we should add after the swap:\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\n   But the code doesn't have that. So we must add that? However, the code only has the swap and then count++. Then the next iteration of the outer while.\n\n   Without moving the pointers, we would get stuck? \n\n   Therefore, we must adjust the pointers. But the TODO is only in the else of the inner while loops. \n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust the pointers in the outer loop? \n\n   Actually, the provided code does not have the adjustment of i and j after the swap. So we must add that in the TODO? But the TODO is only in the inner while loops.\n\n   Let me reexamine the code:\n\n        while True:   # outer loop\n            while True:   # inner for i\n                if arr[i] == 1 or i == j:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            while True:   # inner for j\n                if arr[j] == 0 or j == i:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n\n            if i == j:\n                break\n            # swap\n            sec = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[j]\n            arr[j] = sec\n            count += 1\n\n            # We are missing: move i forward and j backward? \n\n        Then we break when i==j.\n\n   Without moving the pointers, we would get an infinite loop? \n\n   Example: [1,0] \n        First: i=0, j=1.\n        First inner: arr[0]=1 -> break (so i remains 0).\n        Second inner: arr[1]=0 -> break (so j remains 1).\n        Then swap: [0,1] -> count=1.\n        Then we go back to the outer while.\n        Then first inner: i=0: arr[0]=0 -> so we enter the else -> TODO: what? We must do something to break out of the inner while? \n\n   So we must adjust i in the else? \n\n   The intended code for the else in the first inner while is to move i forward? \n\n   So we do: \n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n   Then in the example [1,0] after the swap we have [0,1]. Then in the next outer iteration:\n        First inner: i=0: arr[0]=0 -> so we do i+=1 -> now i=1. Then condition: i==j? j is 1 -> so break the inner while (because i==j? condition in the if: if arr[i]==1 or i==j -> i==j -> break).\n        Then second inner: j=1: condition: arr[1]=1 -> not zero, so we do j-=1 -> j=0. Then condition: j==i? i=1 and j=0 -> no? then check: arr[0]=0 -> break? because condition: if arr[j]==0 -> true? so break.\n        Then we check if i==j? i=1, j=0 -> no? then we swap arr[1] and arr[0] -> becomes [1,0] -> and count becomes 2 -> which is wrong.\n\n   So we must break the outer loop when we have swapped and then we have moved the pointers? \n\n   Actually, the typical solution is to move the pointers after the swap. \n\n   Therefore, we should add after the swap and count increment:\n\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\n   But the code doesn't have that. So we must add that? But the TODO is only in the else of the inner while loops.\n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust the inner while loops to be more like:\n\n        while i < j:\n            while i < j and arr[i] == 0:\n                i += 1\n            while i < j and arr[j] == 1:\n                j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                swap\n                count += 1\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n\n   But the provided code structure is different.\n\n   Given the constraints, we can complete the inner while loops as:\n\n        In the first inner while:\n            else: \n                i += 1\n\n        In the second inner while:\n            else:\n                j -= 1\n\n        And then after the swap, we do nothing? \n\n   But then we get stuck? \n\n   Alternatively, we can break out of the inner while loops and then the outer loop will break when i==j? \n\n   Actually, the inner while loops are designed to break when we find a one (for i) or a zero (for j) or when i==j. Then we break the outer loop if i==j. Otherwise, we swap and then the next iteration of the outer loop will start and the inner while loops will move the pointers? \n\n   But note: in the next iteration, the inner while loop for i will start at the current i (which is the same as the one we just swapped? because we haven't moved it). \n\n   Example: [1,0] after swap becomes [0,1]. Then in the next outer iteration:\n        i=0, j=1.\n        First inner: arr[0]=0 -> so we do the else: i+=1 -> i=1 -> then condition: i==j? -> break the inner while.\n        Then second inner: j=1: arr[1]=1 -> not zero, so we do j-=1 -> j=0 -> then condition: j==i? i=1, j=0 -> no? then condition: arr[0]=0 -> break? because if arr[j]==0 -> true? so break.\n        Then we check if i==j? 1==0 -> false -> then swap arr[1] and arr[0] -> becomes [1,0] -> and count becomes 2 -> infinite loop.\n\n   So we must avoid that. \n\n   Therefore, we must move the pointers after the swap. \n\n   Since the TODO is only in the else, we cannot add the pointer movement after the swap? \n\n   Alternatively, we can move the pointers in the else? But that is for skipping zeros and ones, which is correct. But after the swap, we don't move the pointers? \n\n   How about we break the inner while loops and then after the swap we move the pointers? \n\n   But the code structure doesn't allow that. \n\n   We must change the code? \n\n   However, note the problem: the total_zeros method is simpler. We can do:\n\n        total_zeros = arr.count(0)\n        ones_in_zeros = 0\n        for i in range(total_zeros):\n            if arr[i] == 1:\n                ones_in_zeros += 1\n        print(ones_in_zeros)\n\n   But the provided code structure is using two pointers. And the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n   Therefore, we must complete the provided two-pointer code.\n\n   The issue is that after swapping, we need to move the pointers to avoid reprocessing the same elements. \n\n   We can do that by moving the pointers in the else of the inner while loops? But that is already done: the else moves the pointer. But after the swap, we don't move the pointers? \n\n   How about we break the inner while loops and then the outer loop will break when i and j meet? But we are not moving the pointers after the swap.\n\n   Alternatively, we can move the pointers after the swap by including:\n\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\n   in the outer loop after the swap? \n\n   But the TODO is only in the else of the inner while loops. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are allowed to add multiple lines? \n\n   Actually, the TODO is in the else of the first inner while. We are also allowed to add code elsewhere? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n   But note: the second inner while already has an else: j-=1. The first inner while has an else that is TODO.\n\n   And the outer loop after the swap doesn't have any code to move the pointers. \n\n   We are allowed to complete the entire program? But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n   How about we complete the else for the first inner while as i+=1, and then we also add after the swap the movement of the pointers? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   And the output format is a JSON with the completions for program1, program2, program3.\n\n   We are to output the missing code for program1.py. The missing code is in the TODO and also we need to add two lines after the swap? \n\n   But the TODO is only one TODO. \n\n   Alternatively, we can see that the provided code might be intended to work without moving the pointers after the swap? \n\n   Let me simulate [0,1,0,0,1] with the following:\n\n        We add in the else of the first inner while: i += 1\n        And the second inner while already has j-=1 in the else.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Start: arr = [0,1,0,0,1], i=0, j=4.\n        First inner: i=0 -> arr[0]=0 -> else: i+=1 -> i=1 -> then check: arr[1]=1 -> break.\n        Second inner: j=4 -> arr[4]=1 -> else: j-=1 -> j=3 -> then arr[3]=0 -> break.\n        Swap: arr[1] and arr[3] -> [0,0,0,1,1], count=1.\n        Then we go to the outer loop again.\n\n        Now i=1, j=3.\n        First inner: i=1 -> arr[1]=0 -> else: i+=1 -> i=2 -> then arr[2]=0 -> else: i+=1 -> i=3 -> then condition: i==j? -> break the inner while (because i==j).\n        Then second inner: j=3 -> arr[3]=1 -> else: j-=1 -> j=2 -> then condition: j==i? i=3, j=2 -> no? then arr[2]=0 -> break? because condition: if arr[j]==0 -> true? so break.\n        Then we check if i==j? 3==2 -> false -> then swap arr[3] and arr[2]: [0,0,1,0,1] -> count=2 -> which is wrong.\n\n   So we must move the pointers after the swap.\n\n   Therefore, we must add:\n\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\n   after the swap and count increment.\n\n   But the TODO is only in the else of the first inner while. \n\n   How can we output that? \n\n   The missing code for program1.py might be:\n\n        In the else of the first inner while: we do i += 1.\n\n        And then we also need to add two lines after the swap: \n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n\n   But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we can output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   But that would be two i+=1? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\"\n\n   for the TODO, and then we also need to add the two lines after the swap? But the problem says: the missing code. The TODO is one part, and the other part is not marked as TODO? \n\n   But note: the problem says: \"with missing lines or blocks\". The provided program1.py has one TODO and also the outer loop after the swap is missing the pointer movement.\n\n   Therefore, we must output the entire fixed block? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n   We are to output the missing code for program1.py as a string in the JSON.\n\n   How about we output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\"\n\n   for the TODO, and then we also output the two lines after the swap? But the JSON value is a string that should be placed in the program? \n\n   Actually, the entire program1.py is provided except the TODO. But the problem also says: \"missing lines or blocks\". It might be that the intended solution only requires the TODO and the rest is already there? \n\n   But the simulation shows we need the two lines after the swap.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do without moving the pointers after the swap if we break the inner while loops in a different way? \n\n   How about we change the inner while loops to be:\n\n        while arr[i] == 0 and i < j:\n            i += 1\n        while arr[j] == 1 and i < j:\n            j -= 1\n\n   But the provided code has while True: ... break conditions.\n\n   Given the time, and since the known solution is to count the ones in the first total_zeros, and the two-pointer method with swap and then moving the pointers is standard, I think the intended solution for the provided code is to add:\n\n        In the TODO: i += 1\n\n        And then after the swap and count increment, we add:\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n\n   But the problem says: output only the missing code. And the TODO is only one part. The other part is not marked.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we can consider the entire program1.py has two missing parts: the TODO and the two lines after the swap.\n\n   But the example output format is one string for program1.\n\n   We can output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   But that would be:\n\n        else:\n            i += 1   [from the TODO]\n        ... then after the swap:\n        count += 1\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\n   But then the first i+=1 is in the else, and the next two are after the swap.\n\n   However, the provided code after the swap is:\n\n        sec = arr[i]\n        arr [i] = arr[j]\n        arr [j] = sec\n        count += 1\n\n   and then we need to add two lines.\n\n   So the missing code for program1.py is two parts:\n\n        Part1 (in the else): i += 1\n        Part2 (after count+=1): i += 1; j -= 1;\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   But wait, the first part is in the else block and the second part is after the swap. How can we represent that in one string? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output the entire fixed else block and then the two lines after? But the TODO is only in the else.\n\n   This is ambiguous.\n\n   Let me re-read the problem: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n   And the example: the TODO is in the else, and we also need to add two lines after the swap. \n\n   Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and there is only one TODO, but the provided code has a structure that is incomplete in two places, I think we must output the code for the TODO and then also the code for the missing two lines. But the problem doesn't specify how to represent two separate missing parts.\n\n   How about we output the string that would replace the entire program1.py from the point of the TODO to the end of the program? That is not feasible.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py, program2.py and program3.py with missing lines or blocks\". It might be that each program has exactly one contiguous block missing? \n\n   But program1.py has two missing parts: one in the else and one after the swap.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since the known solution is simpler, I think the intended solution for program1.py is to use the count method. But the provided code structure is two-pointer.\n\n   After careful thought, I found a known solution for this exact problem (Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing) is to count the ones in the first total_zeros. So we can ignore the two-pointer and do:\n\n        total_zeros = arr.count(0)\n        ones_in_zeros = sum(1 for i in range(total_zeros) if arr[i]==1)\n        print(ones_in_zeros)\n\n   But the provided code has a two-pointer approach. \n\n   How about we replace the entire while loop with:\n\n        count = 0\n        total_zeros = arr.count(0)\n        for i in range(total_zeros):\n            if arr[i] == 1:\n                count += 1\n        print(count)\n\n   But the problem says: output only the missing code. And the provided code has a while loop that is already written.\n\n   Given the constraints (total n over test cases <= 200000) and that the count method is O(n), it is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem says: the provided code has a while loop and we must complete it.\n\n   I think the safest is to output for the TODO: \"i += 1\", and then hope that the two lines after the swap are not required? But our simulation showed they are.\n\n   Alternatively, we can move the pointers in the inner while loops by changing the conditions to include i<j? \n\n   But the provided condition in the inner while is while True.\n\n   I found a known solution in C++ for a similar problem (minimum swaps to group all ones in the rear) uses:\n\n        int count = 0;\n        for (int i = 0, j = n - 1; i < j; ) {\n            while (i < j && a[i] == 0) i++;\n            while (i < j && a[j] == 1) j--;\n            if (i < j) {\n                count++;\n                i++;\n                j--;\n            }\n        }\n\n   This is the standard two-pointer for this grouping. \n\n   In our provided code, we are not moving the pointers after the swap in the outer loop, but the inner while loops are designed to move the pointers. However, in the next iteration, the inner while loop for i will skip the zeros and stop at the next one, and similarly for j. \n\n   But in the example [0,1,0,0,1] after the first swap, we have [0,0,0,1,1]. Then i=1, j=3. \n        In the next iteration:\n            while True for i: \n                if arr[1]==1? -> 0 -> else: i+=1 -> i=2.\n                then if arr[2]==1? ->0 -> else: i+=1 -> i=3.\n                then if arr[3]==1 -> break.\n            while True for j:\n                if arr[3]==0? -> no, so else: j-=1 -> j=2.\n                then if arr[2]==0 -> break.\n            then i=3, j=2 -> i>j? then in the condition if i==j? -> no, so we swap arr[3] and arr[2] -> which is [0,0,1,0,1] -> count=2.\n\n   This is not correct.\n\n   Therefore, we must have the movement after the swap. \n\n   Given the above, I will output for program1.py:\n\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n        and then after the swap and count increment, we add:\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n\n   So the missing code for program1.py is two parts. We can output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n    i += 1\\n    j -= 1\"\n\n   But note: the first part is in the else and the second part is after the swap. In the program, the else block is at one place and the other two lines are at another. \n\n   How to represent? We output the string that includes both missing parts? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might allow us to output the entire fixed program1.py? But it says only the missing code.\n\n   I think we should output the code for the TODO and then the code for the other missing part. Since the TODO is in the else, and the other part is after the swap, we can output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   and then in the program, we put the first line in the else and the next two after the swap.\n\n   But that would be:\n\n        else:\n            i += 1   # from the first line of the string\n        ... later ...\n        count += 1\n        i += 1   # from the second line\n        j -= 1   # from the third line\n\n   This is what we want.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, we output: \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   But note: the provided code has an indentation of 8 spaces for the else block. We must preserve that. The first \"i += 1\" should be at the same indentation as the else, and the next two should be at the same indentation as the swap.\n\n   In the string, we use \"\\n        \" to represent the new line and then 8 spaces.\n\n   So for program1.py: \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\"\n\n   Now, for program2.py:\n\n   The problem: Given a perfect binary tree of depth n (so total nodes = 2^n - 1), and a string s of length 2^n-1 (the characters on the nodes), we can swap the left and right child of any non-leaf node any number of times. We want the number of distinct preorder strings.\n\n   The provided code:\n\n        def dfs(i):\n            if i >= m: return (1, '')\n            ln, ls = dfs(i * 2)\n            rn, rs = dfs(i * 2 + 1)\n            ln = ln % mod\n            rn = rn % mod\n            if ls < rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, ls + s[i - 1] + rs\n            elif ls > rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, rs + s[i - 1] + ls\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   Explanation:\n\n        The function dfs(i) returns a tuple (number of distinct preorder strings for the subtree rooted at i, the actual preorder string for the subtree rooted at i in the current configuration?).\n\n        But note: we are allowed to swap, so the number of distinct preorder strings for the subtree is what we want.\n\n        In the if branch: if the left child's string is less than the right child's string, then even if we swap, we get two different strings? But wait, if we don't swap, we get ls + s[i-1] + rs, and if we swap, we get rs + s[i-1] + ls. And since ls<rs, these are different. So the number of distinct strings for the subtree is (ln * rn) * 2? because for each choice in the left and each in the right, and then we can swap or not.\n\n        Similarly, if ls>rs, then swapping gives a different string, so also *2.\n\n        But if ls==rs, then swapping or not swapping gives the same string. So the number of distinct strings is not doubled. \n\n        Therefore, in the else branch, we should return:\n\n            return ln * rn, ...   # without multiplying by 2, because swapping doesn't change the string.\n\n        But what about the string to return? We can return either concatenation because they are the same.\n\n        So: \n            return ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs   # or rs + s[i-1] + ls, but since ls==rs, it doesn't matter.\n\n        However, note: the string we return is for the current configuration? But we are counting distinct preorder strings. The string we return might be used by the parent to determine if it should swap or not. But the parent only cares about the string for comparison. \n\n        Therefore, in the else branch, we return (ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs)\n\n        But wait: the multiplication: ln * rn might be large, and we are doing mod later.\n\n        However, the code already does: ln = ln % mod, rn = rn % mod.\n\n        So in the else: we return (ln * rn) % mod, and the string.\n\n        But note: the multiplication in the other branches is ln * rn * 2. In the else, we don't multiply by 2.\n\n        Example: if the left and right subtrees have the same string, then swapping doesn't change the string, so only one possibility.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n            return ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs\n\n        or equivalently:\n\n            return ln * rn, s[i-1] + ls + rs   # but wait, the current node's character is s[i-1] and then the left and then the right.\n\n        In the if branch, we did: ls + s[i-1] + rs? That doesn't look right. \n\n        Let me read the definition: the preorder string of a non-leaf vertex x is: s_x + f(l_x) + f(r_x)\n\n        So it should be: s[i-1] + the left child's string + the right child's string.\n\n        But in the if branch, we did: ls + s[i-1] + rs -> this is not preorder.\n\n        This is a mistake.\n\n        In the if branch and the elif branch, we are not returning the correct string. We should return:\n\n            s[i-1] + (the left child's string) + (the right child's string)   for the non-swapped case.\n\n        But wait, in the if branch, we are returning: ls + s[i-1] + rs -> which is (left string) + (node) + (right string) -> not preorder.\n\n        Similarly, in the elif branch, we return: rs + s[i-1] + ls.\n\n        This is not correct.\n\n        The preorder is: node, then left subtree, then right subtree.\n\n        So the string should be: s[i-1] + ls + rs   for the non-swapped case.\n\n        In the if branch, we are not swapping? Actually, the if branch condition is ls < rs. In the if branch, we return (ln * rn * 2, ls + s[i-1] + rs) -> which is not correct.\n\n        We should return the string for the current configuration. The current configuration is: left child is on the left, right child on the right. So the string should be: s[i-1] + ls + rs.\n\n        But then why are we comparing ls and rs? Because if we swap, the string becomes: s[i-1] + rs + ls.\n\n        And we want to return the lex smallest string? or what? \n\n        The problem: the parent will compare the strings of its left and right subtrees. To avoid duplicate counting, we want to return a canonical representation. In the if and elif branches, we return the sorted order: if ls < rs, then we return the string with ls first and then rs? but that is not the current configuration.\n\n        Actually, the dfs function returns the string for the subtree in the current configuration? But then the parent will use that to compare with the other child. However, we are allowed to swap, so we are free to choose the order. \n\n        The known solution for this problem (from similar problems on Codeforces) is to do:\n\n            if the left and right are not equal, then we return (2 * left_count * right_count, min(left_string, right_string) + s[i] + max(left_string, right_string)) \n\n        but that is not exactly.\n\n        Alternatively, we return for the string the canonical representation: the sorted version of the two subtrees? \n\n        In the if branch: we return (ln * rn * 2, s[i-1] + min(ls, rs) + max(ls, rs)) \n\n        wait, but then the string is not the actual preorder, but a canonical one.\n\n        But the problem: the parent needs to know the string for comparison. If we return a canonical string (by sorting the two subtrees), then if the two subtrees of a parent are the same, we avoid doubling.\n\n        Therefore, the dfs function should return the canonical string for the subtree: which is the string we would get if we apply swaps to make the left child's string <= the right child's string.\n\n        In the if branch: we have ls < rs, so we can leave it as is or swap to get rs then ls. But the canonical form is to have the smaller one first. So we return the string: s[i-1] + ls + rs   [because if we don't swap, we get node then left then right, and if we swap, we get node then right then left. But we want the canonical form to be the one with the smaller subtree string first?]\n\n        Actually, the known solution is to return:\n\n            if we can swap, then the string for the subtree is: s[i] + min(f(l), f(r)) + max(f(l), f(r))\n\n        and the count is: \n            if f(l) == f(r): then count = count(l) * count(r)\n            else: count = count(l) * count(r) * 2\n\n        But note: the string we return is the canonical string, not the actual.\n\n        In the provided code, the dfs returns the string in a canonical way: in the if branch (ls<rs) we return the string as ls + s[i-1] + rs? that doesn't look right.\n\n        Let me read the code again:\n\n            if ls < rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, ls + s[i - 1] + rs\n            elif ls > rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, rs + s[i - 1] + ls\n\n        This is not node + left + right, but left + node + right? which is inorder.\n\n        We must return preorder: node + left + right.\n\n        Therefore, the correct return should be:\n\n            if ls < rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, s[i-1] + ls + rs   # for the non-swapped? but wait, we are allowed to swap, and we are returning a canonical representation.\n\n        But then if we swap, we get s[i-1] + rs + ls, which might be different.\n\n        To have a canonical representation, we want to return the string that is the smallest possible? or the one that is fixed by the sorting of the subtrees.\n\n        The known solution in C++ for a similar problem (e.g. https://codeforces.com/contest/1582/problem/E2 or similar) is:\n\n            string dfs(int v) {\n                if (is_leaf(v)) return string(1, s[v]);\n                string left = dfs(left_child);\n                string right = dfs(right_child);\n                if (left > right) swap(left, right);\n                return string(1, s[v]) + left + right;\n            }\n\n        and the count is:\n\n            if (left == right) {\n                dp[v] = dp[left_child] * dp[right_child] % mod;\n            } else {\n                dp[v] = dp[left_child] * dp[right_child] * 2 % mod;\n            }\n\n        So the string we return is: s[v] + left + right, where left and right are the canonical strings from the children, and we ensure left<=right by swapping if necessary.\n\n        Therefore, in the if branch (ls<rs), we have left=ls, right=rs, and we return s[i-1] + ls + rs.\n\n        In the elif branch (ls>rs), we swap to make sure left is the smaller one, so we return s[i-1] + rs + ls? but wait, we have to swap the children to achieve that, but the count is doubled.\n\n        In the provided code, in the if branch they return: ls + s[i-1] + rs, which is not correct.\n\n        So we must change the if and elif branches to return the string as: s[i-1] + min(ls,rs) + max(ls,rs)\n\n        Therefore, the if branch should be:\n\n            if ls < rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, s[i-1] + ls + rs\n\n        elif ls > rs:\n                return ln * rn * 2, s[i-1] + rs + ls   # because we want the smaller one first? \n\n        But then in the else branch, we return: s[i-1] + ls + rs   (which is the same as s[i-1] + rs + ls since ls==rs).\n\n        However, the problem: the string we return is the canonical string (with the children sorted).\n\n        Therefore, the TODO in the else branch is:\n\n            return ln * rn, s[i-1] + ls + rs\n\n        But wait, in the if and elif branches, we are not using the sorted children in the string? \n\n        In the if branch, we return s[i-1] + ls + rs, which is node + the left child's string + the right child's string, and we haven't swapped because ls<rs and we want the smaller first? \n\n        But the canonical representation should have the left child's string (which is the one that is smaller) first. In the tree, the left child is the left child and the right child is the right child. But we are allowed to swap, so we can choose which one is on the left. \n\n        Therefore, the string we return is: s[i-1] + min(ls, rs) + max(ls, rs)\n\n        In the if branch: min(ls,rs)=ls, max=rs, so string = s[i-1] + ls + rs.\n        In the elif branch: min=rs, max=ls, so string = s[i-1] + rs + ls.\n        In the else: string = s[i-1] + ls + rs   (which is the same as s[i-1] + rs + ls).\n\n        Therefore, the if branch and elif branch are already returning the correct string? \n\n        But the provided code in the if branch is: \n            return ln * rn * 2, ls + s[i-1] + rs \n\n        This is not node + left + right, but left + node + right.\n\n        We must change that.\n\n        However, the problem says: output only the missing code. We are not allowed to change the if and elif branches.\n\n        Therefore, we must return in the else branch: \n\n            return ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs   # to be consistent with the if and elif branches? \n\n        But then the string representation is not preorder.\n\n        This is a mistake in the provided code.\n\n        Given the constraints, and since the problem says to output only the missing code, we will only complete the else branch as the provided if branch does.\n\n        In the else branch, we return (ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs)   [which is the same as (ln * rn, rs + s[i-1] + ls) because ls==rs]\n\n        So the TODO is:\n\n            return ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs\n\n        or \n\n            return ln * rn, rs + s[i-1] + ls   # either is the same.\n\n        But the if branch returns: ls + s[i-1] + rs, and the elif branch returns: rs + s[i-1] + ls.\n\n        In the else, we can return either. Let's return: ls + s[i-1] + rs for consistency with the if branch.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the TODO is:\n\n            return ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs\n\n   For program3.py:\n\n   The problem: Check if a string s is perfectly balanced: for every substring t, and for every two characters u,v in the entire string, the difference in frequency in t is at most 1.\n\n   The provided code:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = input()[:-1]\n            a = len(s)\n            b = len(set(s))\n            if b == 1 or a == b:\n                print('YES')\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                        break\n\n   Explanation:\n\n        If the string has only one distinct letter (b==1), then for any substring, the frequency of any two letters (but there's only one) -> difference 0, so YES.\n\n        If the string has length a and distinct letters b, and a==b, then it's of the form \"abc...\". In any substring, the frequency of any two letters is at most 1, and the difference is at most 1? \n            Example: \"ab\" -> frequencies: a:1, b:1 -> difference 0.\n            Example: \"abc\" -> any substring: \"a\": (1,0,0), \"ab\": (1,1,0) -> difference between a and b is 0, between a and c is 1 (if we consider the substring \"ab\", then c is 0, so difference between a and c is 1) -> but wait, the condition is for any two characters u and v that are present in the entire string. In the substring \"ab\", the characters present are 'a' and 'b'. The frequency of 'a' is 1, 'b' is 1, and 'c' is 0. But the condition says: \"u and v are characters present in s\" (the entire string) -> so in the substring \"ab\", we must consider u and v that are in the entire string, but are they present in the substring? The problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\", but does that mean they must be present in the substring? \n\n        Let me read: \"the difference between the frequencies of u and v in t is not more than 1\", and \"u and v are characters present in s\". It doesn't say present in t. So if a letter is in s but not in t, then its frequency is 0. \n\n        In the string \"abc\", consider the substring \"ab\": \n            u='a', v='c': frequency in t: a:1, c:0 -> difference 1 -> okay.\n            u='b', v='c': 1 and 0 -> difference 1 -> okay.\n            u='a', v='b': 1 and 1 -> difference 0 -> okay.\n\n        In the substring \"a\":\n            u='a', v='b': 1 and 0 -> difference 1 -> okay.\n            u='a', v='c': 1 and 0 -> difference 1 -> okay.\n\n        In the substring \"aa\" (which doesn't exist in \"abc\") -> but wait, \"abc\" has no \"aa\", so we don't care.\n\n        Therefore, \"abc\" is YES.\n\n        Now, what about a string like \"aab\": \n            distinct letters: 2, length=3.\n            Check substring \"aa\": \n                u='a', v='b': in the entire string, so we consider: frequency of 'a'=2, 'b'=0 -> difference 2 -> not allowed.\n            So \"aab\" is not perfectly balanced.\n\n        The provided code: \n            if b==1 or a==b: print('YES')\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            # TODO\n                        break\n\n        What is this doing?\n\n        It is iterating i from 1 to a-1. If the character at position i is in the substring s[:i] (the previous characters), then it forms a repeated letter? \n\n        Then it constructs w = (s[:i] repeated enough times to have length a).\n\n        If s equals w, then print \"YES\", else ... TODO and break.\n\n        Example: s = \"abcabc\" -> i=0 to ... \n            i=1: s[1]='b' in s[:1]=\"a\"? -> no.\n            i=2: s[2]='c' in \"ab\"? -> no.\n            i=3: s[3]='a' in \"abc\" -> yes.\n            then w = (\"abc\" repeated) -> \"abcabc\" -> equals s -> print \"YES\".\n\n        But is \"abcabc\" perfectly balanced?

\n\n        The code breaks out of the for loop after the first i where s[i] is in s[:i]. \n\n        What if there is a later i that might make it periodic? \n\n        Example: \"aabaab\" -> \n            i=1: 'a' in \"a\" -> yes.\n            w = \"a\"*6 = \"aaaaaa\" -> not equal to \"aabaab\", so we print \"NO\" and break.\n\n        But is \"aabaab\" perfectly balanced?

\n            The contiguous substring \"aa\" does not exist. \n            However, the contiguous substring from index0 to index2 is \"aba\", which has a:2, b:1 -> difference 1.\n\n            But wait, the substring \"a\" (which is 'a' at index0) and then the substring 'a' at index2: \n                For the substring \"aa\" (contiguous? the problem says: substring is contiguous) -> there is no contiguous \"aa\" in \"abac\". \n\n            The only contiguous substring that has two a's is \"aba\" (which has two a's) and \"aca\" (which is not contiguous? \"abac\" has: \"a\",\"ab\",\"aba\",\"abac\",\"b\",\"ba\",\"bac\",\"a\",\"ac\",\"c\") -> no \"aca\" because not contiguous.\n\n            So \"abac\" might be perfectly balanced.\n\n            But the code outputs \"NO\", which is not correct.\n\n        Therefore, the provided approach is not sufficient.\n\n        Known solution for this problem: \n\n            We only need to check substrings of length at most 26*2+1? or something.\n\n            In fact, it is known that if a string is not perfectly balanced, then there exists a substring of length at most 4 that violates the condition. \n\n            Or specifically, by a known result, it is sufficient to check all substrings of length at most 5? \n\n            But the note in the problem: the third example \"abc\" is balanced.\n\n            After checking known problems (e.g. Codeforces Round # \n            There is a problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1503/problem/A\n\n            But not exactly.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                for length in range(2, min(len(s), 100)): \n                    for start in range(0, len(s)-length+1):\n                        t = s[start:start+length]\n                        # count frequency of each letter in t\n                        # but the entire string s has up to 200000, and we are guaranteed total length over test cases <= 200000, but if we do O(n^2) it will be too slow.\n\n            Another known solution: \n                It is known that the only perfectly balanced strings are:\n                   - those with at most two distinct characters and \n                   - and that are of the form (a period of 1 or 2) with specific properties.\n\n            In fact, from the examples, we see:\n                \"aba\" is balanced -> period might be 2? \"ab\" repeated? but \"aba\" is not a full period.\n\n            The known solution in the provided code is to check if the string is periodic with period length = the first occurrence of a repeated letter.\n\n            Specifically, the code does: \n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        period = s[:i]\n                        if s == (period * ( (a//len(period)) + 1))[:a]:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n\n            But in the example \"abac\", the period would be \"ab\", and ( \"ab\" repeated: \"abab\" ) and then sliced to 4 is \"abab\", but s=\"abac\" != \"abab\", so it prints \"NO\", but we want \"YES\".\n\n            Therefore, this approach is not correct.\n\n        After research, I found that the intended solution is to check only substrings of length at most 26 (or the alphabet size) * 2. \n\n        Specifically, we can do:\n\n            max_length = min(26*2, len(s))   # or 26+1? \n            for length in range(2, max_length+1):\n                for start in range(0, len(s)-length+1):\n                    t = s[start:start+length]\n                    count = [0]*26\n                    for c in t:\n                        count[ord(c)-ord('a')] += 1\n                    # then, for any two letters that are in the entire string s, we would need to check the difference? \n                    # but the entire string s has a set of letters. We can precompute that.\n                    # However, the condition: for any two letters u,v in the entire string s, the difference in t is at most 1.\n                    # But note: if a letter is not in t, then its count is 0.\n                    # So we can compute: \n                    #   max_freq = max(count)\n                    #   min_freq = min([count[i] for i in range(26) if chr(i+ord('a')) in set_s] + [10**9]) \n                    #   but wait, we only care about letters that are in the entire string. \n                    #   However, if a letter is in the entire string but not in t, then its count is 0.\n                    #   So min_freq = min( count[i] for i in range(26) if the letter is in set_s ) \n                    #   and then if max_freq - min_freq > 1, then we return \"NO\".\n\n            If we find any such substring, then we return \"NO\", else after all these substrings, we return \"YES\".\n\n        But the total length of s over test cases is 200000, and the inner loop over start is O(n) and the length is at most 52, so the total is 200000 * 52 which is 10.4e6, which is acceptable in Pyton.\n\n        However, the provided code structure is different.\n\n        Given the provided code structure, and that the total length of all strings is <= 200000, we might do:\n\n            if the string has more than 26 distinct letters? -> then it's automatically \"NO\", because in a substring of length 27, we have 27 distinct letters? but wait, the condition: the difference between any two is at most 1. In a substring of length 27, if we have 27 distinct letters, then each appears once, so difference 0 -> okay. \n\n            But then in a substring of length 1, we have one letter, and the others are 0, so the difference between that letter and any other letter in the entire string is 1? -> okay.\n\n            However, consider a substring of length 1: \n                for a letter that is not in the substring: frequency 0, and the letter in the substring: frequency 1 -> difference 1 -> okay.\n\n            So that is not the issue.\n\n            The known counterexample is \"aab\", and we only need to check a small substring.\n\n        Therefore, we can change the else block to:\n\n            We will check for every substring of length at most 26*2 (or 26+1) that might violate the condition.\n\n            But the provided code already breaks out of the for loop after the first i where s[i] is in s[:i]. \n\n            How about if we don't break, and we continue? \n\n            The provided code has a break after the for loop. We are only allowed to do one test.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem says the total length is <= 200000, we can do:\n\n            max_len = min(len(s), 26*2)   # or 26+2? \n            for length in range(2, max_len+1):\n                for start in range(0, len(s)-length+1):\n                    t = s[start:start+length]\n                    freq = {}\n                    for c in t:\n                        freq[c] = freq.get(c,0)+1\n                    # get the entire set of letters in s\n                    # But we can precompute the set of s: set_s = set(s)\n                    # But we are in the loop for test cases, and s is fixed.\n                    min_freq = 10**9\n                    max_freq = 0\n                    for c in set_s:\n                        count_c = freq.get(c,0)\n                        if count_c < min_freq:\n                            min_freq = count_c\n                        if count_c > max_freq:\n                            max_freq = count_c\n                    if max_freq -

We must be careful with the indentation.\n\n   We output the string exactly as the code should be placed in the else block.\n\n   However, the else block is at the same indentation level as the if s[i] in s[:i] block.\n\n   The provided else block has a TODO, and we replace that with the above code.\n\n   The above code for program3 is multiple lines.\n\n   We output as a string with newlines and spaces.\n\n   The current indentation level in the else is 8 spaces. We will output each line with 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\n   But the code we output will be placed exactly at the TODO, so the first line should be at 12 spaces (because the else is 8, and the TODO is at 12). \n\n   Therefore, for program3, we output a string that is:\n\n        \"        set_s = set(s)\\n        found = False\\n        for length in [2,3]:\\n            for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n                t = s[start:start+length]\\n                freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n                for c in t:\\n                    if c in set_s:\\n                        freq[c] += 1\\n                values = list(freq.values())\\n                if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n                    print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if found:\\n                break\\n        if not found:\\n            print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        break\"\n\n   But note: the break at the end is to break the for i loop.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the exact indentation as in the provided code: the else block is indented by 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12 spaces. Our code should be at 12 spaces.\n\n   So we output with 8+4=12 spaces for each line? \n\n   But the provided code in the else block has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with the code, and the code should be at the same indentation as the if and else within the for loop.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code for program3 with 8 spaces (the else block) and then the code within the else should be indented by 4 more spaces.\n\n   In the string, we will use:\n\n        \"        set_s = set(s)\\n        found = False\\n        for length in [2,3]:\\n            for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n                t = s[start:start+length]\\n                freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n                for c in t:\\n                    if c in set_s:\\n                        freq[c] += 1\\n                values = list(freq.values())\\n                if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n                    print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if found:\\n                break\\n        if not found:\\n            print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        break\"\n\n   This has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, in the else block, the first level is 8 spaces, and then the for loop should be 12 spaces, and the inner for loop 16, and so on.\n\n   But in the string, we are not including the 8 spaces of the else block? \n\n   The TODO is at the position of 12 spaces (because the else: is 8, and then the next line is 12). \n\n   So the code we output should be at 12 spaces. \n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        for program3: the string starting at 12 spaces.\n\n        \"    set_s = set(s)\\n    found = False\\n    for length in [2,3]:\\n        for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n            t = s[start:start+length]\\n            freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n            for c in t:\\n                if c in set_s:\\n                    freq[c] += 1\\n            values = list(freq.values())\\n            if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n                print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                found = True\\n                break\\n        if found:\\n            break\\n    if not found:\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    break\"\n\n   But wait, the else block is at 8 spaces, and we want the code to be at 12 spaces. So we use 4 spaces for each indent level.\n\n   In the else block, the first level is 4 more spaces (so 8+4=12). Then the for loop should be 16, and the inner for 20, etc.\n\n   But in the string, we can use:\n\n        \"        set_s = set(s)\\n        found = False\\n        for length in [2,3]:\\n            for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n                t = s[start:start+length]\\n                freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n                for c in t:\\n                    if c in set_s:\\n                        freq[c] += 1\\n                values = list(freq.values())\\n                if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n                    print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if found:\\n                break\\n        if not found:\\n            print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        break\"\n\n   This has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line, which is the same as the else block's base level. But within the else, we want an extra indent.\n\n   Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the 'w = ...' line in the if branch. In the if branch, the code is at 12 spaces (8 for the if and then 4 more). \n\n   Therefore, the code in the else should be at 12 spaces. \n\n   So we output the code with 8 spaces (base) and then the code with 4 spaces of indent? \n\n   This is very messy.\n\n   Alternatively, we output the code as it would appear in the else block, with the same indentation as the if branch.\n\n   In the if branch, they have:\n\n        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n        if s == w:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            ... our code ...\n\n   So the if branch has two lines of code at 12 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, in the else, we should have code at 12 spaces.\n\n   So the string for program3 should be with 0 spaces at the beginning? and then the program will indent it to 12 spaces? \n\n   We output the code as:\n\n        \"set_s = set(s)\\nfound = False\\nfor length in [2,3]:\\n    for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n        t = s[start:start+length]\\n        freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n        for c in t:\\n            if c in set_s:\\n                freq[c] += 1\\n        values = list(freq.values())\\n        if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            found = True\\n            break\\n    if found:\\n        break\\nif not found:\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\")\\nbreak\"\n\n   and then the program will have:\n\n        else:\n            set_s = set(s)\n            found = False\n            ... \n\n   with each line of the code at 12 spaces.\n\n   But the code above has no spaces. We must have the code at 12 spaces within the else.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code with 12 spaces for each line? \n\n   That is not feasible.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since the problem says to output the missing code, we output the code as a string that has the newlines and the exact indentation.\n\n   We will use 8 spaces for the else block and then 4 more for the code inside, so 12 spaces for each line of the code.\n\n   Therefore, for program3, the string is:\n\n        \"        set_s = set(s)\\n        found = False\\n        for length in [2,3]:\\n            for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n                t = s[start:start+length]\\n                freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n                for c in t:\\n                    if c in set_s:\\n                        freq[c] += 1\\n                values = list(freq.values())\\n                if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n                    print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if found:\\n                break\\n        if not found:\\n            print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        break\"\n\n   This has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, in the else block, the first line after the else: should be indented. In the provided code, the else: is at 8 spaces, and the then part is at 12 spaces.\n\n   So we output 12 spaces for each line? \n\n   But the string above has 8 spaces. We need 12.\n\n   We can do: \n        line1 = ' ' * 12 + \"set_s = set(s)\"\n        line2 = ' ' * 12 + \"found = False\"\n        etc.\n\n   But in the string, we represent that as:\n\n        \"            set_s = set(s)\\n            found = False\\n            for length in [2,3]:\\n                for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n                    t = s[start:start+length]\\n                    freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n                    for c in t:\\n                        if c in set_s:\\n                            freq[c] += 1\\n                    values = list(freq.values())\\n                    if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n                        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                        found = True\\n                        break\\n                if found:\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n            break\"\n\n   This has 12 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   Therefore, for program3, we output this string.\n\n   Let's hope.\n\n   Final JSON:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"i += 1\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\",\n     \"program2\": \"return ln * rn, ls + s[i-1] + rs\",\n     \"program3\": \"            set_s = set(s)\\n            found = False\\n            for length in [2,3]:\\n                for start in range(len(s)-length+1):\\n                    t = s[start:start+length]\\n                    freq = {c:0 for c in set_s}\\n                    for c in t:\\n                        if c in set_s:\\n                            freq[c] += 1\\n                    values = list(freq.values())\\n                    if max(values) - min(values) > 1:\\n                        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                        found = True\\n                        break\\n                if found:\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n            break\"\n   }\n\n   Note: In program3, the break at the end is to break the for i in range(1,a) loop.\n\n   We output."
