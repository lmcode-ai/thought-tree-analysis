Now, how to fix \"111000\": \n The minimal division is ['111', '000'] -> both odd. We can change the string to \"110000\" -> minimal division: ['11', '0000'] -> even. This took 1 operation. We can change it to \"000000\" -> one segment of even length -> 0 segments? -> wait, one segment of length 6, even.",

We are missing the code for when yy < mid_y. Typically in binary search, if we are searching for a value and we have a condition, we adjust the bounds. Here, if yy < mid_y, then we want to increase mid_a? or decrease? The variable `yy` is a function of `mid_a`. We are trying to find the `mid_a` such that yy = mid_y. So if yy < mid_y, then we need to increase yy. How does yy change with mid_a? Without the full context, it is hard.

We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program and determine the missing code.\n\n### Program1\nThe problem: Determine the last color (red or blue) painted on an 8x8 grid. The grid is painted by horizontal red stripes and vertical blue stripes in some order. When a stripe is painted, it repaints the entire row (for red) or column (for blue). We are guaranteed that at least one stripe is painted.\n\nThe code structure:\n- Read the number of test cases `t`.\n- Read all lines of input (each test case has 8 lines, and there might be empty lines before each test case, but the code splits by whitespace so the empty lines are skipped).\n- We have an outer loop for each test case (`ele` from 0 to n-1) and an inner loop for the 8 lines of the test case (indexed from `a` to `a+7`).\n\nThe current code:\n```python\nfrom sys import stdin\nn = int(input())\nlines = stdin.read().split()\na = 0\nfor ele in range(n):\n    for i in range(8):\n        if lines[i+a].count('R') == 8:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    else:\n        print('B')\n    a+=8\n```\n\nThe idea:\n- The code is iterating over each test case. For each test case, it checks each of the 8 rows (lines of the grid). If it finds a row that is entirely 'R' (i.e., `count('R') == 8`), then we have a candidate for a red stripe. However, note that the problem states that the stripes are drawn sequentially and the last one drawn is the answer.\n\nImportant note from the problem: \n- The grid is obtained by drawing horizontal red rows and vertical blue columns. The last stripe drawn will cover the entire row (if red) or column (if blue). \n\nBut note: \n- If a red stripe was drawn last, then there must be at least one row that is entirely red (because the last stripe is a red row that covers the entire row). However, if a blue stripe was drawn last, then there might be no row that is entirely red? Actually, no: because blue stripes are vertical and they might break a red row. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"The red stripe was painted after the blue one, so the answer is R.\" in the example.\n\nBut the example in the note: \n\"In the second test case, the first blue column is painted first, then the first and last red rows, and finally the last blue column. Since a blue stripe is painted last, the answer is B.\"\n\nHow to solve?\n- We note that if a red stripe was painted last, then that entire row must be red. Similarly, if a blue stripe was painted last, then that entire column must be blue.\n\nBut wait: after painting, the last stripe (say a red row) will cover the entire row, so that row must be all red. Similarly, if the last was a blue column, then that column must be all blue.\n\nHowever, note that there might be multiple red rows and blue columns. The key is: the last stripe must be a row that is entirely red and that row has not been overwritten by a subsequent blue stripe? But the last stripe is the last one, so it is not overwritten.\n\nBut the problem: the stripes are drawn sequentially and repaint. So the last stripe (whether red or blue) will be the one that is visible in the entire row (if red) or entire column (if blue).\n\nTherefore, we can check:\n- If there exists a row that is entirely red, then it is possible that red was last? But note: if blue was last, then no row can be entirely red? Actually, no: because blue stripes are vertical and they only change one column at a time. So if a red row was drawn after all blue columns, then that row remains red. But if a blue column was drawn after a red row, then that blue column would have repainted one cell of that red row to blue, so that row would not be entirely red.\n\nTherefore:\n- If there is at least one row that is entirely red, then the last stripe must be red (because that row must have been painted after all blue columns that intersect it).\n- Conversely, if there is no row that is entirely red, then the last stripe must be blue (because then the last stripe was blue, and it broke every red row in at least one column).\n\nBut wait: what if the last stripe is blue? Then we must have at least one column that is entirely blue? Yes, and that column would have been painted after all red rows. And note: if a red row was painted after a blue column, then that red row would have repainted the entire row, including the blue column? So the blue column would not be entirely blue? Actually, no: because the blue column is repainted by the red row? So the blue column would have a red cell in that row.\n\nTherefore, the same logic: \n- If there is a row that is entirely red, then red was last.\n- Otherwise, blue was last.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"at least one stripe is painted\", so we don't have to worry about no stripe.\n\nSo the missing code in program1:\nIn the inner loop, if we find a row that is entirely red, then we break out and print 'R'. Otherwise, if we don't find any such row in the 8 rows, we print 'B'.\n\nHowever, the current code has a for-else structure: the else is attached to the for loop. The else block runs if the loop completes without a break.\n\nBut the current code does not break when it finds a red row. We should break the inner loop and then print 'R'. Then we break the inner loop and skip the else.\n\nBut the code structure:\n\n```python\n    for i in range(8):\n        if lines[i+a].count('R') == 8:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    else:\n        print('B')\n```\n\nWe need to break out of the inner loop when we find a red row and then print 'R'. Then we skip the else.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n```python\n    for i in range(8):\n        if lines[i+a].count('R') == 8:\n            print('R')\n            break\n    else:\n        print('B')\n```\n\nBut note: the problem says there might be empty lines before each test case, but we split by whitespace so the empty lines are gone. Also, we are using `a` to index the current test case's lines (each test case has 8 lines).\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n```python\n            print('R')\n            break\n```\n\nBut note: the current code has an indentation of 8 for the TODO. We must output exactly the code that goes in that place.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the format of the JSON.\n\nBut wait: what if there are multiple red rows? We only need to find one to break and print 'R'. Then we break the inner loop and move to the next test case.\n\nSo the code for program1 is fixed.\n\n### Program2\nThe problem: We are given a binary string of even length. We want to make it \"good\" with minimum operations. A string is good when it is divided into contiguous subsegments of equal characters (minimal number of subsegments) and every segment has even length.\n\nWe can change any character to '0' or '1'. We need the minimum number of operations.\n\nThe code structure:\n```python\nimport re\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n i=p=r=0\n for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n  i+=1\n  if len(t)&1:\n   if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n   else:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n```\n\nWe are iterating over the test cases. The input is read: `[2::2]` means we skip the first two lines? Actually, the input format: \n- First line: t (number of test cases)\n- For each test case: \n   - first line: n (length of string)\n   - second line: the binary string\n\nSo `[2::2]` takes every even-indexed line starting from index 2 (0-indexed). So the first test case's string is at index 2, then the next test case's string at index 4, etc.\n\nIn the loop for each test case string `s` (which includes the newline), we split the string into contiguous groups of 0s or 1s using `re.findall('0+|1+', s)`. Then we iterate over these groups.\n\nWe have:\n- `i`: counts the group index (starting at 0, but then we do `i+=1` at the start of the loop, so the first group has i=1, second i=2, etc.)\n- `p`: seems to be a marker for the last group that had an odd length? \n- `r`: the result (number of operations)\n\nThe logic: \n- For a group `t`, if the length of `t` is odd, then we have a problem (because we want even lengths). \n- If we have a previous marker `p` (meaning we have an odd group that hasn't been fixed by pairing), then we do `r += i - p` and then set `p=0` (meaning we fixed two groups: the one at index `p` and the current one at index `i` by changing the segment between them?).\n- Otherwise, if there is no previous marker, we set `p` to the current group index? \n\nBut note: we can fix two adjacent odd-length groups by changing one operation? Actually, the note says: \nExample: \"11001111\" is good. \nBut for \"1110011000\" (which is divided into \"111\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\") -> lengths 3,2,2,3 -> not good.\n\nHow to fix? \nWe can change some bits. The idea: \nWe note that we can merge adjacent groups by flipping a bit at the boundary. For example, if we have two adjacent groups of the same character, we can flip one bit to merge them? But wait, they are different because the groups are maximal.\n\nActually, the minimal operations: \nWe can note that the problem is equivalent to: we want the entire string to be partitioned into segments of even length and same character. This is equivalent to: the entire string must have an even-length run of 0s and 1s.\n\nBut note: we can change the string arbitrarily. The key observation: \n- The parity of the number of segments of odd length must be even? Actually, we can fix two adjacent odd-length segments with one operation? \n\nBut the note: \nIn the first test case: \nInput: \"111000\" (n=6) -> initially divided into \"111\", \"000\" -> both odd? Actually, no: the problem says: \n\"Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\" -> which is two segments: \"11\" and \"00000000\". \n\nBut wait, the example input: \nThe first test case: \n\"111000\" -> the example says change s3, s6, s7 -> that's 3 operations.\n\nBut the example also says: \"There are other ways to operate 3 times\".\n\nHow can we do it in less? \nActually, the problem says the minimum number of operations.\n\nThe solution: \nWe note that we can break the string into segments of even length. The operations needed is the number of segments that have odd length? But we can fix two adjacent odd segments by one operation? \n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (easy version) is: \n- We traverse the string and whenever we have a segment of odd length, we can merge it with the next segment (by flipping the first character of the next segment) so that the current segment becomes even and the next segment becomes even? But that would take one operation per two odd segments.\n\nBut note: the groups are consecutive. The minimal operations is the number of groups that are odd, divided by 2? But wait: \nExample: \nGroup lengths: [3, 2, 2, 3] -> two odd groups. We can fix by one operation? Actually, we can flip one bit at the boundary between the first and second group? But that would merge the first two groups? Then we get a group of length 3+1 (if we flip the first of the second group) = 4? Then the groups become: [4, 1, 2, 3] -> but then we break the next group? \n\nAlternatively, we can note: \nThe problem is equivalent to: we want to remove all odd-length segments. We can remove two adjacent odd segments with one operation? \n\nActually, the known solution for the problem: \nWe count the number of groups that have odd length. Then the answer is that number divided by 2? But the example: \nFirst test case: the string is \"111000\" -> groups: ['111','000'] -> two odd groups -> then answer would be 2/2 = 1? But the example says 3 operations.\n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nAlternative known solution: \nWe can use dynamic programming or greedy. \n\nBut note the constraints: the total n over test cases is 200000. The code uses `re.findall` and then a loop over the groups.\n\nThe code in the note: \n```python\nimport re\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n i=p=r=0\n for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n  i+=1\n  if len(t)&1:\n   if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n   else:p=i\n print(r)\n```\n\nBut wait, the example: \nTest case: \"111000\" -> groups: ['111','000'] -> both odd. \nFirst group: i=1, odd -> since p is 0, we set p=1.\nSecond group: i=2, odd -> then we have p=1 (non-zero) -> then r += 2-1 = 1, and set p=0. \nThen we output r=1.\n\nBut the example says the answer is 3? \n\nWait, the example input: \nThe first test case: \nInput: \n1\n6\n111000\n\nBut the example says: one of the ways is to change s3, s6, s7 -> that's 3 operations. \n\nBut the example also says: \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\nSo why is the answer 1 for \"111000\"? \n\nI see: the problem says: \n\"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\"\n\nAfter our operations, we are allowed to change the string arbitrarily. Then we can re-divide the string. \n\nBut note: the example operation: \nChange s3, s6, s7 to '0': \nOriginal: s = \"111000\" -> becomes \"1100000000\" -> but wait, the string length is 6? How do we get 10? \n\nI see: the example says: \n\"after that s becomes '1100000000'\", which is 10 characters? \n\nBut the input n=6. \n\nSo the example must be a different test case? \n\nThe note: \n\"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following. Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\", it can be divided into \"11\" and \"00000000\", which lengths are 2 and 8 respectively.\"\n\nBut wait, the string becomes 10 characters? The problem says the length n is even and at least 2. The input says: the first line of the test case is n, the length. Then the string of length n.\n\nSo the example test case must have n=10? \n\nLooking at the input specification: \n\"The first contains a single positive integer t (1<=t<=10000). For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (2<=n<=200000) \u2014 the length of s, it is guaranteed that n is even. The second line contains a binary string s of length n.\"\n\nSo the example: \n\"111000\" is of length 6. But the example operation changes s3, s6, and s7? That would require the string to be at least 7? \n\nI see: the example operation is for a different test case? The note says: \n\"In the first test case\" of the example. \n\nThe sample input provided in the problem: \nInput:\n5\n6\n111000\n10\n1100011000\n2\n00\n2\n11\n6\n100110\n\nOutput:\n3\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\nSo the first test case: n=6, s=\"111000\", output=3.\n\nBut the code we are completing: \nFor the first test case: \ngroups = ['111','000'] -> both odd -> then we do: \nfirst group: i=1 -> odd -> set p=1.\nsecond group: i=2 -> odd -> then r += 2-1 = 1 -> then r=1.\n\nBut the expected answer is 3.\n\nSo the code we are completing is not matching the sample.\n\nAlternative solution: \nWe note that we can change a bit to break a long odd segment into two segments: one of even length and one of odd length? That doesn't help.\n\nBut the known solution for the problem (from known contests) is: \nWe count the number of groups that have odd length. Then the answer is that number? \n\nBut that doesn't work: the sample has 2 odd groups -> 2, but expected 3.\n\nAnother known solution: \nWe can use the fact that the entire string must have even-length runs. We can break the string into runs. Then, we can fix the runs by merging adjacent runs? \n\nBut note: \nWe can change a bit at the boundary of two runs to merge them? Then we get one run. But then the length becomes the sum? \n\nAlternatively, we can note: \nThe problem is equivalent to: we want the entire string to be partitioned into runs of even length. We can do: \n- We can change a bit in an odd-length run to split it into two runs: one of length 1 and the rest? Then we can merge the length 1 with an adjacent run? \n\nBut the minimal operations: \nThe known solution for the problem (from Codeforces) is: \nWe traverse the runs. For each run, if the length is odd, then we can skip the next run (because we can fix two consecutive odd runs with one operation) and count one operation? \n\nBut the sample: \n\"111000\": \nWe have two runs: [3,3] (both odd). We can fix by one operation? But the answer is 3.\n\nWait, the problem says: \n\"Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0'\"\n\nBut note: the indices: \ns3: the third character (0-indexed? or 1-indexed?) \nThe example: \"111000\" -> \ns1='1', s2='1', s3='1', s4='0', s5='0', s6='0'. \nBut the example changes s3, s6, and s7. \ns3: the third character -> index 2? \ns6: index 5? \ns7: index 6? -> but the string is only length 6 -> so that is out of bounds.\n\nI see: the example must be for a different string? \n\nThe note: \n\"Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\"\"\n\nThis implies the original string was of length 10? \n\nThe sample input: \n5\n6\n111000\n10\n1100011000\n2\n00\n2\n11\n6\n100110\n\nSo the first test case: n=6, s=\"111000\" -> output=3.\nThe second test case: n=10, s=\"1100011000\" -> output=0? \nBut the example says: \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially\", so output 0.\n\nSo for the first test case: \ns = \"111000\" -> groups: ['111','000'] -> both odd. \nHow can we fix it? \nWe want to make all runs even. \nWe can change one bit in the first run: change the last bit of the first run to '0'. Then we get \"110000\" -> groups: ['11','0000'] -> both even -> that's 1 operation.\nBut the example says 3 operations? \n\nAlternatively, we can change the first run: \nChange the first run: change the first character to '0': then we get \"011000\" -> groups: ['0','11','000'] -> then we have an odd run of length 1 and then two even runs. Then we change the first run: change the first character back to '1'? That doesn't help.\n\nWait, the minimal operations: \nWe can change the third character (index 2) to '0': then we get \"110000\" -> groups: ['11','0000'] -> even. So that's 1 operation.\n\nBut the example says 3 operations? \n\nI see the example operation: \n\"Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\"\"\n\nThis is for a string of length 10? \n\nThe first test case in the sample input is n=6, so the string is \"111000\". The example operation described is for a different test case? \n\nThe problem says: \n\"In the first test case\" (of the problem's example) -> but the sample input has 5 test cases.\n\nThe sample input and output: \n5\n6\n111000 -> output 3\n10\n1100011000 -> output 0\n2\n00 -> output 0\n2\n11 -> output 0\n6\n100110 -> output 3\n\nSo for \"111000\", the answer is 3, and for \"100110\", the answer is 3.\n\nHow to achieve 3 for \"111000\"? \nWe can change: \nOption 1: \nChange index0 to '0': then \"011000\" -> groups: ['0','11','000'] -> then we have an odd run of length 1 and an odd run of length 3. Then we change index0 back to '1'? That doesn't help.\n\nOption 2: \nChange index0 and index1 to '0': then \"001000\" -> groups: ['00','1','000'] -> then we have an odd run of length 1. Then change index2 to '0': then \"000000\" -> one group of even length. That's 3 operations.\n\nBut we can do it in 1 operation as well. \n\nWhy is the minimal operations 3? \n\nLet me read the problem again: \n\"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\"\n\nAfter we change the string, we are allowed to re-divide the string arbitrarily (minimal number of contiguous subsegments of equal characters). \n\nAfter changing index2 to '0', we get \"110000\", which can be divided into two segments: \"11\" and \"0000\" -> minimal segments is 2, and both are even. So that's valid. So why is the answer 3? \n\nThe problem says: \n\"After that, s is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.\"\n\nAnd in the example, they say: \n\"after that s becomes '1100000000', it can be divided into '11' and '00000000'\"\n\nBut wait, they are not using the minimal number of segments? \nThe minimal number of segments for \"1100000000\" is 2: \"11\" and \"00000000\". \n\nSo why would we need to change three characters for \"111000\" when we can change one?\n\nUnless the problem requires that the minimal number of segments remains the same as before? But the problem does not say that.\n\nI see the issue: the sample output for the first test case is 3, but our one-operation solution is valid. \n\nThis implies the known solution is not 1.\n\nLooking at the sample: \nThe last test case: \"100110\" -> groups: ['1','00','11','0'] -> all even? \nWait: \n'1' -> length 1 (odd)\n'00' -> even\n'11' -> even\n'0' -> length 1 (odd)\n\nSo two odd groups. Then by the code we are completing: \nfirst group: i=1, odd -> p=1.\nsecond group: i=4, odd -> then r += 4-1 = 3.\n\nSo the code outputs 3 for the last test case, which matches.\n\nBut for the first test case: \"111000\" -> groups: ['111','000'] -> two odd groups: \nfirst group: i=1 -> p=1.\nsecond group: i=2 -> r += 2-1 = 1 -> then r=1.\n\nBut the expected answer is 3.\n\nWhy the discrepancy? \n\nI see: the problem says: \n\"the first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=10000) \u2014 the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (2<=n<=200000) \u2014 the length of s, it is guaranteed that n is even. The second line contains a binary string s of length n.\"\n\nAnd the code: \n`for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:`\n\nThis takes every even-indexed line starting from index 2. But the first test case: \nLine0: \"5\"\nLine1: \"6\"\nLine2: \"111000\" -> this is the string for the first test case.\nLine3: \"10\"\nLine4: \"1100011000\"\n...\n\nSo the first string is at index2: \"111000\", which has a newline? \n\nBut the sample input: \n\"111000\" is of length 6, but when we read it with `open(0)`, it includes the newline? \n\nThe code: `re.findall('0+|1+', s)` will work on the string including the newline? \n\nThe newline is at the end: \"111000\\n\" -> then the groups would be ['111000']? because the newline is not '0' or '1'. \n\nBut wait, the regex '0+|1+' will match only the zeros and ones. The newline is not matched. So the groups are ['111','000'].\n\nBut then the length of the last group is 3, but the string is \"111000\" without the newline? \n\nActually, the string read from the file is \"111000\\n\", but when we do `re.findall`, it will match only the '111' and '000'. The newline is skipped.\n\nBut then the group '000' has length 3.\n\nSo the code for the first test case: \ngroups = ['111','000'] -> both length 3, odd.\nThen we set p=1 for the first group.\nThen for the second group, we do r += 2-1 = 1.\n\nBut the expected answer is 3.\n\nUnless the sample input has a different string? \n\nThe sample input: \n6\n111000\n\nBut the string \"111000\" has no newline in the middle? \n\nThe problem: the code uses `for s in [*open(0)][2::2]`, and each `s` is a line that includes the newline. Then when we do `re.findall('0+|1+', s)`, we are matching the pattern in the string including the newline? \n\nBut the newline is at the end: \"111000\\n\", and the regex will not match the newline, so it will only match the '111' and '000'. \n\nBut then the length of '000' is 3.\n\nSo the code outputs 1 for the first test case, but expected 3.\n\nThis indicates the code is not matching the sample.\n\nHowever, the last test case: \n6\n100110\n\nThe string is \"100110\\n\", groups: \n'1', '00', '11', '0' -> lengths: 1,2,2,1 -> two odd groups: first and last. \nThen: \nfirst group: i=1, odd -> p=1.\nsecond group: even -> skip.\nthird group: even -> skip.\nfourth group: i=4, odd -> then r += 4-1 = 3.\n\nSo the code outputs 3 for the last test case, which matches.\n\nSo why the first test case is 1 in the code but expected 3? \n\nI see: the problem says the total sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000. But the sample input has only 5 test cases, and the total n is 6+10+2+2+6 = 26.\n\nBut the code for the first test case outputs 1, but the sample expected output is 3.\n\nUnless the sample provided in the problem has a mistake? \n\nBut the problem says: \n\"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following. Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\", it can be divided into \"11\" and \"00000000\".\"\n\nThis implies the first test case has n=10, not 6.\n\nAnd the sample input: \n5\n6\n111000\n10\n1100011000\n2\n00\n2\n11\n6\n100110\n\nSo the first test case has n=6, and the string \"111000\", and the answer is 3.\n\nHow to achieve 3? \nWe can change three characters: \nFor example, change the first character to '0', then the third to '0', and the fourth to '1'. \nThen we get \"010100\" -> groups: ['0','1','0','1','00'] -> then we have odd groups: the first, second, third, fourth are length 1, and the last is even. \nThen we would have to fix the odd groups? \n\nAlternatively, change the first, second, and fifth: \nChange s0 to '0', s1 to '0', s4 to '1': then \"000110\" -> groups: ['000','11','0'] -> then we have an odd group at the end.\n\nAlternatively, change the first, third, and fifth: \nChange s0 to '0', s2 to '0', s4 to '1': then \"000110\" -> groups: ['000','11','0'] -> still an odd group.\n\nWe can change three characters to make the string \"000000\", then one group of even length.\n\nSo the minimal operations is 3 because we can do it in 3.\n\nBut we can also do it in 1: change index2 to '0' -> \"110000\", which is two even groups.\n\nSo why is the answer 3? \n\nUnless the problem has additional constraints? \n\nThe problem says: \n\"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\"\n\nAfter the operations, we are allowed to choose the minimal contiguous subsegments. In the string \"110000\", the minimal number of contiguous subsegments is 2: ['11','0000'].\n\nSo it is valid.\n\nThis suggests the answer for the first test case should be 1.\n\nBut the sample output is 3.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLooking at the sample output: \n3\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\nSo the first and last test cases require 3 operations.\n\nHow to explain? \n\nKnown solution from Codeforces for the problem \"D. Tokitsukaze and Strange Inequality\" (but this is not the same) or for the problem \"Tokitsukaze and Good 01-String (easy version)\" from Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2) \n\nIn the easy version of the problem, the solution is: \n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(0, n, 2):\n      if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n          ans += 1\n\nBut let's test: \nFor \"111000\": \ni=0: '1' and '1' -> same -> 0\ni=2: '1' and '0' -> different -> +1\ni=4: '0' and '0' -> same -> 0\nans=1.\n\nFor \"100110\": \ni0: '1' and '0' -> +1\ni2: '0' and '1' -> +1\ni4: '1' and '0' -> +1\nans=3.\n\nThis matches the sample output: 1 for the first test case? but the sample output is 3 for the first test case.\n\nBut wait, the sample output for the first test case is 3, not 1.\n\nUnless the sample input has the first test case as \"100110\" and the last as \"111000\"? \n\nThe sample input: \n5\n6\n111000\n10\n1100011000\n2\n00\n2\n11\n6\n100110\n\nAnd the sample output:\n3\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\nSo the first test case is \"111000\" -> output 3, and the last is \"100110\" -> output 3.\n\nThe known solution of comparing adjacent pairs for every two characters: \n for i in range(0, n, 2):\n     if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n         ans += 1\n\nFor \"111000\": \nCompare:\nindex0 and 1: '1' and '1' -> same.\nindex2 and 3: '1' and '0' -> different -> +1.\nindex4 and 5: '0' and '0' -> same.\nans=1.\n\nFor \"100110\":\nindex0 and 1: '1' and '0' -> +1.\nindex2 and 3: '0' and '1' -> +1.\nindex4 and 5: '1' and '0' -> +1.\nans=3.\n\nSo the known solution gives 1 for \"111000\", but the sample expected output is 3.\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\nAfter checking the contest (Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2)), the easy version of the problem is: \n\"Tokitsukaze and Good 01-String (easy version)\" \nIn the easy version, the minimal operations is indeed the number of positions i (0-indexed, i even) where s[i] != s[i+1].\n\nBut the sample output in the problem for the first test case is 3, not 1.\n\n unless the sample input in the problem statement is for the hard version? \n\nThe problem says: \n\"This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments.\"\n\nSo the easy version only asks for the minimum number of operations.\n\nAnd the sample input and output: \n3\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\n for the provided 5 test cases.\n\n So the first test case: n=6, s=\"111000\", output=3.\n\n How to get 3? \n We can change the string to \"110000\" in 1 operation, but then the minimal number of subsegments is 2, which is even for each segment. \n\n unless the easy version has a different interpretation? \n\n I found the actual contest problem: \n https://codeforces.com/contest/1678/problem/D1\n\n But the sample output for the first test case is 1 for the easy version.\n\n But the problem in our hands says the output for the first test case is 3.\n\n This is a mystery.\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n \"After that, s is good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.\"\n\n And the example: \n \"11001111\" is good -> divided into \"11\", \"00\", \"1111\" -> lengths 2,2,4 -> even.\n\n But wait, the example division is not minimal! The minimal division of \"11001111\" is: \n \"11\", \"00\", \"1111\" -> that is minimal.\n\n In the example of \"1110011000\", the minimal division is \"111\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\" -> lengths 3,2,2,3.\n\n So the condition is: in the minimal division, every segment must have even length.\n\n Now, how to fix \"111000\": \n The minimal division is ['111', '000'] -> both odd. \n We can change the string to \"110000\" -> minimal division: ['11', '0000'] -> even. \n This took 1 operation.\n\n We can change it to \"000000\" -> one segment of even length -> 0 segments? -> wait, one segment of length 6, even. This takes 3 operations (change all '1' to '0').\n\n So the minimal operations is 1.\n\n unless the problem requires that we also minimize the number of segments? \n\n The problem: \n \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\"\n\n This is the division we are talking about. In the string \"110000\", the minimal number of contiguous subsegments is 2, and both are even. \n\n So 1 operation is valid.\n\n Therefore, the answer for the first test case should be 1.\n\n Given the sample output says 3, and the last test case is 3, and the known solution for the last test case by the adjacent pair method is 3, it is possible that the first test case in the sample input is not \"111000\" but a different string.\n\n The sample input: \n 6\n 111000\n\n -> groups: ['111','000'] -> two odd groups.\n\n The code we are completing: \n   if p: \n        r += i - p\n        p = 0\n   else:\n        p = i\n\n For the first test case: \n   group1: i=1, odd -> p=1.\n   group2: i=2, odd -> then r += 2-1 = 1.\n\n So the code outputs 1.\n\n To make the code output 3 for the first test case, we would need three odd groups? \n\n or the code is not as above.\n\n Given the provided code for program2, and the sample input, the only way to get 3 for the first test case is to have three groups and two of them are odd and they are not consecutive in the group index? \n\n For example, if the groups are ['1','11','000'] -> then the first group is odd, the second even, the third odd. \n Then: \n   group1: i=1, odd -> p=1.\n   group2: i=2, even -> skip.\n   group3: i=3, odd -> then r += 3-1 = 2.\n   then r=2, not 3.\n\n or if we have three odd groups: \n   group1: i=1, odd -> p=1.\n   group2: i=2, odd -> r += 2-1 = 1, then p=0.\n   group3: i=3, odd -> p=3.\n   then r=1.\n\n then we would need to output 1, not 3.\n\n So the code as provided cannot output 3 for the first test case.\n\n This suggests that the intended solution for the easy version is the adjacent pair method.\n\n Therefore, the code for program2 might be intended to be:\n\n We are not using the group method, but the adjacent pair method.\n\n But the code structure is given. \n\n The TODO: in the else, we set p to i. \n\n To make the first test case output 3, we would need to set r = 3.\n\n How about: \n   if p: \n        r += 1   # then set p=0\n        p = 0\n   else:\n        r += 1\n        p = i\n\n Then for the first test case: \n   group1: i=1, odd -> else branch: r=1, p=1.\n   group2: i=2, odd -> if branch: r=2, p=0.\n   then r=2.\n\n not 3.\n\n or: \n   if p:\n        r += 2\n        p = 0\n   else:\n        r += 1\n        p = i\n\n then for the first test case: \n   group1: r=1, p=1.\n   group2: r=1+2=3, p=0.\n\n then output 3.\n\n then for the last test case: \"100110\" -> groups: \n   group1: '1' -> r=1, p=1.\n   group2: '00' -> even -> skip.\n   group3: 11 -> even -> skip.\n   group4: '0' -> odd -> then we have p=1 (non-zero) -> r=1+2=3.\n\n so it matches.\n\n Therefore, the missing code in the else branch is: \n        r += 1\n        p = i\n\n and in the if branch, we have: \n        r += i - p   -> but we want to change to r += 2? \n\n But the if branch currently is: \n   if p: \n        r += i - p\n        p = 0\n\n and we see that for two groups, we do r += i-p, which is 2-1=1 in the first test case. \n\n But we want to add 2 in the if branch.\n\n So change the if branch to: \n        r += 2\n        p = 0\n\n then for the first test case: \n   group1: else branch: r=0+1=1, p=1.\n   group2: if branch: r=1+2=3, p=0.\n\n for the last test case: \n   group1: else: r=1, p=1.\n   group2: skip.\n   group3: skip.\n   group4: if: r=1+2=3.\n\n matches.\n\n But is this logical? \n We are counting 1 for the first odd group and 2 for the second odd group, and then reset.\n\n then for two odd groups, we count 1+2 = 3.\n\n for four odd groups: \n   group1: else -> r=1, p=1.\n   group2: if -> r=3, p=0.\n   group3: else -> r=4, p=3.\n   group4: if -> r=4+2=6.\n\n but the minimal operations for four odd groups should be 4? because we can fix each odd group by toggling one bit in the group to make it even? \n\n or by the adjacent pair method, it would be the number of indices i (even) where s[i]!=s[i+1] -> which for a string of four odd groups might be more.\n\n Given the time, and the sample matches, we output for program2 the else branch: \n        r += 1\n        p = i\n\n and leave the if branch as is? -> but then the if branch does `r += i-p`, which is 1 in the first test case, but we need 3 in total.\n\n Alternatively, we change the if branch to add 2 and the else branch to add 1 and set p.\n\n then the if branch: \n   if p: \n        r += 2\n        p = 0\n\n   else:\n        r += 1\n        p = i\n\n then for two groups: 1+2 = 3.\n for four groups: 1+2+1+2 = 6.\n\n But the minimal operations for four groups might be 4, so this is not minimal.\n\n We must return to the adjacent pair method: \n The intended solution is to use the fact that we can fix the string by making every two consecutive characters the same. \n For a segment of even length, we can make it with all the same character by changing half the number of characters? \n\n But the known solution for the easy version is: \n   ans = 0\n   for i in range(0, n, 2):\n        if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n            ans += 1\n\n and this yields 1 for \"111000\", and 3 for \"100110\".\n\n Given the sample expected output is 3 for the first test case, it is likely the sample input in the problem statement has a typo.\n\n Since the code structure is given with the group method, and the sample test cases in the problem's note ( not the sample input in the code) has a test case of length 10, we must output the code that passes the provided sample in the problem's note.\n\n The problem's note: \n   In the first test case ( which is length 10, not 6) -> groups: ['1','00','11','000'] -> then the first group is '1' (length 1), then '00' (even), then '11' (even), then '000' (length 3). \n   Then: \n        group1: i=1, odd -> else branch: r=1, p=1.\n        group2: even -> skip.\n        group3: even -> skip.\n        group4: i=4, odd -> if branch: r += 4-1 = 3.\n   output 3.\n\n and for the last test case in the sample input ( which is \"100110\", n=6) -> groups: ['1','00','11','0'] -> two odd groups: first and last. \n        group1: else branch: r=1, p=1.\n        group2: skip.\n        group3: skip.\n        group4: if branch: r += 4-1 = 3.\n\n so the code we have now ( without any change) outputs 3 for the first test case of the problem's note and for the last test case of the sample input.\n\n and for the sample input's first test case (n=6, \"111000\") -> groups: ['111','000'] -> two groups, both odd. \n        group1: else branch: r=0+ ? -> wait, the code: \n           i=0 initially, then for the first group: i becomes 1, and since p=0, we do the else: p=1.\n        group2: i=2, then if p: true, so r += 2-1 = 1, and p=0.\n        output 1.\n\n but the sample input's first test case expects 3.\n\n So to make the code output 3 for the first test case of the sample input ( which is \"111000\"), we would need to change the if branch to: \n        r += 2 * (i - p)   # then r += 2, because i-p=1.\n\n then for the first test case: r=0+2=2, then we need to add more? \n\n or: \n        r += 1\n        p = 0\n\n then for the first test case: r=1.\n\n not 3.\n\n Given the complexity, and that the problem's note example ( which is the first test case of the problem) has length 10, and the sample input in the code has 5 test cases, and the first test case in the sample input is \"111000\" (n=6) with expected output 3, and the code as provided ( without change) outputs 1 for it, we must output the code that sets in the else branch: \n        p = i\n\n and leave the if branch as is. \n\n Then the code for program2 is as given, and the sample input's first test case outputs 1, which is not 3, but the online judge might have the first test case as the one in the problem's note ( length 10) and the sample input in the problem has 5 test cases including the one with length 10.\n\n So we output for the else branch: \n        p = i\n\n because the TODO is in the else branch.\n\n But the code in the else branch currently does nothing. We need to set p=i and also do r += something? \n\n The code: \n   if p: \n        r += i - p\n        p = 0\n   else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n in the else branch, we should set p to i.\n\n so the missing code is: \n        p = i\n\n Then the code becomes: \n   if p: \n        r += i - p\n        p = 0\n   else:\n        p = i\n\n and for the first test case of the sample input (n=6, \"111000\"): \n   groups: ['111','000'] -> \n        first group: i=1, odd -> else: p=1.\n        second group: i=2, odd -> if p: then r += 2-1 = 1, and p=0.\n   then r=1.\n\n for the last test case: \n   groups: ['1','00','11','0'] -> \n        group1: i=1, else: p=1.\n        group2: even: skip.\n        group3: even: skip.\n        group4: i=4, if: r += 4-1 = 3.\n   then r=3.\n\n and for the problem's note first test case ( length 10, \"1100011000\" -> groups: ['11','000','11','000'] -> even, even, even, even -> no odd group, then r=0. matches.\n\n and the sample input's second test case: \"1100011000\" -> groups: ['11','000','11','000'] -> even -> r=0.\n\n the third: \"00\" -> one group: ['00'] -> even -> skip, r=0.\n the fourth: \"11\" -> one group: ['11'] -> even -> skip, r=0.\n the fifth: \"100110\" -> groups: ['1','00','11','0'] -> two odd groups: first and last -> r=3.\n\n so the sample output is: \n1\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\n but the expected is:\n3\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\n so the first is 1, expected 3.\n\n unless the first test case in the sample input is not \"111000\" but a string that yields three groups of odd length? \n\n or the online judge's first test case is the one in the problem's note, and the sample input provided in the problem has two test cases: \n   first: the example in the note ( length 10) -> output 3.\n   second: the last test case in the sample input ( \"100110\") -> output 3.\n\n then the code would output 3 for both.\n\n Given the instruction: \"Output only the missing code\", and the TODO is in the else branch, and the if branch is already written, we output for the else branch: \n        p = i\n\n So the missing code for program2 is: \n        p = i\n\n### Program3\n The problem: Given a convex polygon with vertices in counter-clockwise order, and with the property that every interior angle is in [90, 180) degrees. We are to find the area of the set of points Q inside the polygon such that there exists a chord of length at most 1 passing through Q.\n\n The code is long and complex. The missing part is in the function `binary_find` in the TODO: \n   if yy < mid_y:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n and then there is an if for yy > mid_y.\n\n The context: \n   This function is doing a binary search on two angles: `la` and `ra` for the first while loop, and `lb` and `rb` for the second while loop.\n\n In the first while loop for `ra` and `la` (which are bounds for an angle `mid_a`), we have: \n   mid_a = (ra+la)/2\n   yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n\n   then if yy < mid_y, we do something, and if yy > mid_y, we set ra = mid_a.\n\n We are missing the code for when yy < mid_y.\n\n Typically in binary search, if we are searching for a value and we have a condition, we adjust the bounds.\n\n Here, if yy < mid_y, then we want to increase mid_a? or decrease? \n\n The variable `yy` is a function of `mid_a`. We are trying to find the `mid_a` such that yy = mid_y.\n\n So if yy < mid_y, then we need to increase yy. How does yy change with mid_a? \n\n Without the full context, it is hard. \n\n But note: the code in the second while loop ( for `lb` and `rb`) has:\n   if yy < mid_y:\n        lb = mid_b\n   if yy > mid_y:\n        rb = mid_b\n\n So in the second while loop, when yy < mid_y, we set lb = mid_b, which means we are increasing the lower bound, so we are searching in the right half.\n\n In the first while loop, we might do the same: \n   if yy < mid_y:\n        la = mid_a   # then we increase the lower bound, so we are searching in the right half.\n   if yy > mid_y:\n        ra = mid_a\n\n So the missing code is: \n        la = mid_a\n\n Therefore, for program3, the missing code in the TODO is: \n        la = mid_a\n\n Let me check the symmetry with the second while loop.\n\n In the second while loop, for `mid_b` in [lb, rb], we have:\n   if yy < mid_y: then we set lb = mid_b, meaning we move the left bound to the middle, so we are zooming in on the right.\n   if yy > mid_y: then we set rb = mid_b, zooming in on the left.\n\n In the first while loop, we should do the same: \n   if yy < mid_y: then we set la = mid_a, so we move the left bound to the middle, and then we will search in [mid_a, ra].\n   if yy > mid_y: then we set ra = mid_a, search in [la, mid_a].\n\n So the missing code is: \n        la = mid_a\n\n Therefore, for program3, the missing code is: \n        la = mid_a\n\n### Summary\n\nFor program1: \n   We output: \n        print('R')\n        break\n\nFor program2:\n   We output: \n        p = i\n\nFor program3:\n   We output: \n        la = mid_a\n\n in the specified TODO places.\n\n But note: the output format is a JSON string with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\".\n\n We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n Let's format the JSON."
