However, the above formula does not account for the constraint that odd days and even days must alternate. Actually, the minimal days to achieve a total growth of 'needed' is:\n        d_min = ceil( (2*needed) / 3 )   ??? But the formula 2*(needed//3) + needed%3 is:\n        = (needed//3)*2 + needed%3\n        = (needed - r)/3 * 2 + r [where r = needed%3] \n        = (2*needed - 2*r)/3 + r = (2*needed + r)/3.

However, this formula does not match the minimal days. For example, if needed=1: then 2*(0)+1 = 1 -> correct (one odd day). needed=2: 2*(0)+2 = 2 -> but we can do it in 1 even day? Actually, we can do it in 1 day (if we are allowed to choose an even day) -> but wait, the day must be even? The first day is odd. So if we skip day1, then day2 is even and we can water the tree then. So total days=2. But the formula gives 2, which is the total days (including skipped day1). needed=3: 2*(1)+0 = 2 -> but we can do: day1: water (1), day2: water (2) -> total growth=3, total days=2? But wait, we have two waterings: one on day1 and one on day2. But the tree that gets the two waterings: on day1 it gets 1, on day2 it gets 2 -> total 3.

Actually, we can do: \n            day1: water tree A -> 1\n            day2: water tree A -> 2 (so total 3)\n            day3: water tree A -> 1 -> total 4. So 3 days.

Actually, we can do:\n                day1: 1 -> total=1\n                day2: 2 -> total=3\n                skip day3\n                day4: 2 -> total=5 -> so 4 days. The formula: 5//3=1, 5%3=2 -> 2*1+2=4 -> matches. So the formula for the minimal days to achieve a total growth of 'needed' is: d = 2*(needed//3) + (needed%3) if needed%3 ! = 0? But note: if needed%3==0, then it's 2*(needed//3) which is 2/3 * needed.

Given the complexity, and that the provided code in program2.py currently only checks w % a <= 2, and the sample works, but the condition for a=3 requires (l-2)%a==0, which is not checked, we must change the code. However, the problem says: the output for the first test case is 1,2,3. The provided code currently would output for the first test case: \n            solutions = {1,2} initially. Then it finds the divisors of half_perimeter=6: [2,3,6] (and 1 is already there). For a=2: w%2=1<=2 -> add a=2? but 2 is already there. For a=3: w%3=0<=2 -> add a=3. For a=6: w%6=3>2 -> skip. Then solutions = {1,2,3} -> then output \"3 1 2 3\". So it works for the sample. But is it always sufficient to only check w % a <= 2? Consider a different test case: w=4, l=4. half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n            a=1: w%1=0 -> add.\n            a=2: w%2=0 -> add. a=3: w%3=1 -> add.\n            a=6: w%6=4 -> skip. Then solutions = {1,2,3} -> output 3. But what are the valid a for (4,4)? Boundary area = 2*(4+4-2)=12.\n            Valid a: divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12. Check conditions:\n\n              a=1: valid.\n              a=2: valid. a=3: condition 1: w=4 -> 4%3=1, (l-2)=2 -> 2%3=2 -> not 0 -> condition 1 fails. condition 2: (w-2)=2%3=2, l=4%3=1 -> fail. condition 3: (w-1)=3%3=0, (l-2)=2%3=2 -> fail. condition 4: (w-2)=2%3=2, (l-1)=3%3=0 -> fail. condition 5: (w-1)=3%3=0, (l-1)=3%3=0 -> valid. condition 6: (w-2)=2%3=2, (l-2)=2%3=2 -> fail. So a=3 is valid by condition 5.\n\n            a=4: condition 1: 4%4=0, (4-2)=2%4=2 -> fail. condition 2: (4-2)=2%4=2, 4%4=0 -> fail. condition 3: (4-1)=3%4=3, (4-2)=2%4=2 -> fail. condition 4: (4-2)=2%4=2, (4-1)=3%4=3 -> fail. condition 5: (4-1)=3%4=3, (4-1)=3%4=3 -> fail. condition 6: (4-2)=2%4=2, (4-2)=2%4=2 -> fail.\n                  -> not valid. a=6: similarly, not valid. a=12: not valid. So valid a: 1,2,3. The code would output 1,2,3 -> matches. How did a=3 get added? In the code: w=4, a=3: 4%3=1<=2 -> so we add. Therefore, it seems that the condition w % a <=2 is sufficient to cover all six conditions? Why? If w % a = r, where r is 0,1, or 2, then it means that the left and right sides (length w) can be partitioned into vertical tiles if we allow up to 2 cells to be covered by the horizontal tiles at the top and bottom. Specifically:\n                If r=0: then the left and right sides can be exactly covered by vertical tiles.

The divisors of half_perimeter (w+l-2) are also divisors of the boundary area? because boundary_area = 2 * half_perimeter. So if a divides half_perimeter, then a divides boundary_area. However, there might be divisors of boundary_area that are not divisors of half_perimeter, for example, if half_perimeter=6, then boundary_area=12, and 4 is a divisor of 12 but not of 6.

We can do:\n\n          while pos <= len_input - 1:\n              n_i = input_arr[pos]   # the next integer is the size of the array\n              pos += 1\n              arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n              pos += n_i\n              test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      But note: the total input has exactly t test cases, and the sum of the sizes is (n1 + n2 + ... + nt) = total integers, and the input has t + (n1+n2+...+nt) integers. The while condition: while pos <= len_input-1. This will work. However, we know the number of test cases is n (which is the first integer). We could also do for _ in range(n): but the code uses a while. So the missing code is:\n\n          n_i = input_arr[pos]   # the size of the current test case\n          pos += 1\n          arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n          pos += n_i\n          test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      But note: the variable 'n' is already used for the number of test cases. We use n_i for the size. So:\n\n          while pos <= len_input - 1:\n              size = input_arr[pos]\n              pos += 1\n              arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n              pos += size\n              test_cases.append(arr) This will extract all test cases. Therefore, for program3.py, the missing code is:\n\n      size = input_arr[pos]\n      pos += 1\n      arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n      test_cases.append(arr)\n      pos += size\n\n  But note: we must update pos. We can write:\n\n      size = input_arr[pos]\n      pos += 1\n      arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n      test_cases.append(arr)\n      pos += size However, we can combine:\n\n      test_cases.append(input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+input_arr[pos]]) pos += input_arr[pos] + 1 But for clarity, we break it. But the problem says: output only the missing code. We output:\n\n      size = input_arr[pos]\n      pos += 1\n      arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n      test_cases.append(arr)\n      pos += size\n\n  But note: the next test case starts at pos, and we have to advance pos by size. Alternatively, we can do in one line:\n\n      test_cases.append(input_arr[pos:pos+input_arr[pos]+1])   -> no, because we want the next 'size' integers, and we have already read the size. Actually, we have at pos: the size, then the next 'size' integers. So:\n\n          test_cases.append( input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+input_arr[pos]] )\n          pos = pos + input_arr[pos] + 1 But that is two lines. We'll do the three-line version for clarity. Summary:\n\n  program1.py: \n      missing line: \"odd += 1\"\n\n  program2.py:\n      missing line: \"solutions.add(a)\"\n\n  program3.py:\n      missing block:\n          size = input_arr[pos]\n          pos += 1\n          arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n          test_cases.append(arr)\n          pos += size\n\nBut note: the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\".

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about watering trees to make them the same height. We are to complete the code.\n\nLooking at the existing code, we see:\n- We sort the list of tree heights.\n- We count the number of trees that have the maximum height (l[-1]).\n- We count the number of trees with even and odd heights (but the odd count is incomplete).\n\nIn the loop for counting odd and even, the code currently does:\n    for i in l:\n        if i%2==0:\n            even+=1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should complete the else block to count the odd trees. So we do:\n            odd += 1\n\nBut note: the problem has a complex solution. The rest of the code uses:\n  su = sum(l[:n-a])   # the sum of all trees that are not the maximum\n  needed = l[-1]*(n-a) - su   # the total growth needed for the non-maximum trees to reach the maximum\n\nThen, depending on whether the maximum height is even or odd, we set p1 and p2.\n\nBut note: the code then computes:\n  ans = max(2*(needed//3) + needed%3, 2*p1-1)\n  needed += n   # why? This is for an alternative scenario? Then we compute ans2 similarly.\n\nAnd then we take min(ans, ans2).\n\nHowever, the note in the problem says: \n  \"Consider the first test case: [1,2,4] -> answer 4\"\n\nBut the existing code has a TODO only in the odd count. So we complete that.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 300,000, so we are safe.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing line is:\n            odd += 1\n\nBut let me check the rest: the code then uses p1 and p2. The meaning of p1 and p2 is:\n  If the target (l[-1]) is even, then p1 = odd, p2 = even.\n  Else (target is odd), then p1 = even, p2 = odd.\n\nThen we compute two candidate answers: ans and ans2.\n\nHowever, note that the problem might require two different scenarios: one where the target is the current maximum, and one where we might let the trees grow beyond the current maximum? Because in the example, we ended at 4, which is the maximum. But the code does:\n  needed = l[-1]*(n-a) - su   # the deficit for non-max trees to reach the maximum\n  then later: needed += n   -> this becomes needed = l[-1]*(n-a) - su + n\n\nWhy n? It might be considering that we can also water the trees beyond the current maximum? Actually, the problem says we want them to be the same height, but it doesn't have to be the current maximum. However, note that we cannot reduce the height, so the common height must be at least the current maximum. But the problem does not require the common height to be the current maximum? However, the example used the current maximum.\n\nBut the problem says: \"grow to the same height\", so we can choose any common height that is at least the maximum. However, the solution in the code seems to consider two possibilities: one where the common height is the current maximum, and one where it is the current maximum plus one? But note: the watering pattern: odd days give 1, even days give 2. The total growth per tree per two days is 3. So the total growth needed for a tree to go from h_i to T is T - h_i.\n\nBut why add n? Actually, the code does: needed += n, which is adding the total number of trees. This is mysterious.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem might be solved by considering the total growth needed and then expressing that growth in terms of days. Since each day we can assign at most 2 (if even) or 1 (if odd) to a tree, but we can choose which tree to water.\n\nHowever, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n  Let M = max(h)\n  Let total_needed = 0\n  For each tree i:\n      total_needed += M - h_i\n\n  But note: we can also set the target to M+1? Actually, the problem does not fix the target. We have to choose the minimum days.\n\n  The known solution is to use binary search on the total days. But the constraints are high.\n\nAlternatively, we can note:\n\n  Let x = number of odd days, y = number of even days. Then total days = x+y.\n  The total growth we can assign is: x + 2*y.\n\n  Also, we must have that for each tree i: \n      h_i + (number of odd days on tree i) + 2*(number of even days on tree i) = T.\n\n  And the total growth must be T * n - sum(h_i) = total_needed.\n\n  Moreover, the total growth is also: (number of odd days overall) + 2*(number of even days overall) = x + 2*y.\n\n  But also, the number of odd days overall is x, and the number of even days overall is y.\n\n  However, we have an additional constraint: we cannot water a tree more than once on the same day? Actually, we water one tree per day. So the total days is x+y, and we have x+y days.\n\n  But note: the problem allows skipping days. So the total days might be more than the total watering events? Actually, no: because we can skip, but we are counting the days we water. The problem asks for the minimum number of days (including skipped days) to achieve the goal.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"minimum number of days\", and we start at day 1. So if we skip some days, the day counter still increases.\n\n  Therefore, the total days is the last day we watered, which is at least max(x, 2*y? ) -> no, the days are consecutive. The last day is the total number of days that have passed.\n\n  How do we relate x and y? Note that the day j is odd if j is odd, even if j is even. So if we have total days = d, then:\n      x = (d+1)//2, y = d//2.\n\n  Then the total growth we can assign is: x + 2*y = (d+1)//2 + 2*(d//2) = (d+1)//2 + d - (d%2) ??? \n\n  Actually: \n      if d is even: x = d/2, y = d/2 -> total growth = d/2 + 2*(d/2) = 3*d/2.\n      if d is odd: x = (d+1)//2, y = d//2 -> total growth = (d+1)//2 + 2*(d//2) = (d+1)//2 + d - (d+1)//2? \n\n  Actually: \n      d odd: x = (d+1)//2, y = (d-1)//2 -> total growth = (d+1)//2 + 2*( (d-1)//2 ) = (d+1)//2 + (d-1) = (d+1 + 2d - 2)/2 = (3d-1)/2.\n\n  But note: we can also skip days arbitrarily, so we are free to choose any d as long as the total growth is at least total_needed, and also we must be able to assign the waterings to trees without exceeding the per-tree constraints? \n\n  However, the problem is more complex because we cannot assign more than one watering per day, and the day's parity matters.\n\n  The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces Round #699 (Div. 2), problem B) is:\n\n      Let M = max(h)\n      Let d1 = 0, d2 = 0\n      For each tree:\n          d1 += (M - h[i]) % 2   # number of odd days needed for this tree? \n          d2 += (M - h[i]) // 2   # but then we can use even days for two units?\n\n      But then we can model the problem as: we need to cover d1 (which is the mod 1 part) and d2 (which is the number of pairs). \n\n      Alternatively, we can consider two targets: T = M and T = M+1.\n\n  Why two targets? Because if we set T=M, then the growth for tree i is M - h_i. If we set T=M+1, then the growth is M+1 - h_i.\n\n  The total growth for T=M: total1 = M*n - sum(h)\n  For T=M+1: total2 = (M+1)*n - sum(h) = total1 + n.\n\n  Then we need to find the minimum d such that:\n      total1 <= (d+1)//2 + 2*(d//2)   [which is the total growth we can assign in d days] \n      and also we must be able to assign the waterings so that no tree gets more than one watering on an odd day? \n\n  Actually, the constraint is that the total growth must be at least total1, and also the number of odd days (which is (d+1)//2) must be at least the maximum odd requirement per tree? But note: we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n  However, the problem has a known solution:\n\n      We can use binary search on d. But the constraints (t up to 20000, and n up to 300000) but the total n is 300000, so we can do O(n) per test case? But 20000 test cases? The problem says the total n over test cases <= 300000, so we can do.\n\n  But the provided code does not use binary search. It uses a direct formula.\n\n  The provided code does:\n\n      l.sort()\n      a = l.count(l[-1])   # number of trees with maximum height\n      su = sum(l[:n-a])    # sum of the trees that are not maximum\n      needed = l[-1]*(n-a) - su   # total growth needed for non-max trees to reach l[-1]\n\n      Then it counts the number of odd and even trees.\n\n      Then, if the maximum is even: \n          p1 = odd, p2 = even\n      else:\n          p1 = even, p2 = odd\n\n      Then:\n          ans = max(2*(needed//3) + needed%3, 2*p1-1)\n          needed2 = needed + n   # which is for target = l[-1]+1? \n          ans2 = max(2*(needed2//3) + needed2%3, 2*p2-1)\n\n      Then print min(ans, ans2)\n\n  How does this formula work?\n\n  The expression: 2*(needed//3) + needed%3   is a way to represent the minimal days to achieve 'needed' growth? \n      If we break needed into 3's: \n          d = 2*(needed//3) + (0 if needed%3==0, 1 if needed%3==1, 2 if needed%3==2)\n      But note: in one day we can only assign 1 or 2. And the days are consecutive. However, the above formula does not account for the constraint that odd days and even days must alternate.\n\n  Actually, the minimal days to achieve a total growth of 'needed' is:\n        d_min = ceil( (2*needed) / 3 )   ??? \n\n  But the formula 2*(needed//3) + needed%3 is:\n        = (needed//3)*2 + needed%3\n        = (needed - r)/3 * 2 + r   [where r = needed%3] \n        = (2*needed - 2*r)/3 + r = (2*needed + r)/3.\n\n  And if r=0, then (2*needed)/3; if r=1, then (2*needed+1)/3; if r=2, then (2*needed+2)/3.\n\n  But note: we cannot have fractional days. Actually, the expression is an integer.\n\n  However, this formula does not match the minimal days. For example, if needed=1: then 2*(0)+1 = 1 -> correct (one odd day).\n        needed=2: 2*(0)+2 = 2 -> but we can do it in 1 even day? Actually, we can do it in 1 day (if we are allowed to choose an even day) -> but wait, the day must be even? The first day is odd. So if we skip day1, then day2 is even and we can water the tree then. So total days=2.\n\n        But the formula gives 2, which is the total days (including skipped day1).\n\n        needed=3: 2*(1)+0 = 2 -> but we can do: day1: water (1), day2: water (2) -> total growth=3, total days=2? But wait, we have two waterings: one on day1 and one on day2. But the tree that gets the two waterings: on day1 it gets 1, on day2 it gets 2 -> total 3. So 2 days.\n\n        needed=4: 2*(1)+1 = 3 -> we can do: day1: skip, day2: water (2), day3: water (1) -> but wait, that gives 2+1=3 -> not enough. Alternatively: day1: water (1), day2: skip, day3: water (1), day4: water (2) -> total days=4? But we can do: \n            day1: water (1) -> tree A: 1\n            day2: water (2) -> tree A: 1+2=3\n            day3: water (1) -> tree A: 4 -> total days=3? \n        Actually, we can do: \n            day1: water tree A -> 1\n            day2: water tree A -> 2 (so total 3)\n            day3: water tree A -> 1 -> total 4. So 3 days.\n\n        The formula: 4//3 = 1, so 2*1 + 1 = 3 -> matches.\n\n        needed=5: 2*(1)+2 = 4 -> \n            day1: 1, day2: 2, day3: 1, day4: 1 -> but that would be 1+2+1+1=5, but we can do:\n            day1: 1, day2: 2, day3: skip, day4: 2 -> but that would be 1+2+2=5? but we skipped day3, so total days=4? \n            Actually, we can do:\n                day1: 1 -> total=1\n                day2: 2 -> total=3\n                skip day3\n                day4: 2 -> total=5 -> so 4 days.\n\n        The formula: 5//3=1, 5%3=2 -> 2*1+2=4 -> matches.\n\n  So the formula for the minimal days to achieve a total growth of 'needed' is: \n        d = 2*(needed//3) + (needed%3)   if needed%3 != 0? \n        But note: if needed%3==0, then it's 2*(needed//3) which is 2/3 * needed.\n\n  However, the expression: 2*(needed//3) + needed%3 is exactly: \n        if needed%3==0: 2*(needed//3)\n        if needed%3==1: 2*(needed//3)+1\n        if needed%3==2: 2*(needed//3)+2\n\n  But wait: 2*(needed//3) + needed%3 = needed//3 * 2 + needed%3 = (needed - r)/3 * 2 + r = (2*needed - 2r)/3 + r = (2*needed + r)/3, which is not an integer formula? Actually, it is integer because r is 0,1,2.\n\n  However, the expression is an integer. And it matches the examples.\n\n  But why do we have the term 2*p1-1? \n\n  Note: p1 is the number of trees that are either even or odd (depending on the maximum) that are not the maximum. Actually, the code counts the entire list: even and odd. But then p1 is set to the count of trees that have the opposite parity to the maximum? \n\n  The constraint: when we water a tree, we assign 1 on odd days and 2 on even days. But note: the tree's height must become the target (which is the maximum, or maximum+1). The parity of the target matters.\n\n  For a tree to reach the target, the number of odd waterings assigned to it must be (target - h_i) mod 2? Actually, the total growth mod 2 must be (target mod 2 - h_i mod 2) mod 2. \n\n  Therefore, the number of odd waterings for tree i must have a fixed parity. Specifically, if (target - h_i) is even, then the number of odd waterings must be even; if (target - h_i) is odd, then the number of odd waterings must be odd.\n\n  However, we are free to assign any number of odd waterings as long as the total growth is (target - h_i). But the minimal constraint is that we must have at least one odd watering for a tree that requires an odd total growth.\n\n  But note: the entire process: the total number of odd days we use is (d+1)//2. And we must assign at least one odd watering to every tree that requires an odd number of odd waterings. However, we can assign more than one? \n\n  Actually, the minimal constraint is that the total number of odd days must be at least the number of trees that require an odd number of odd waterings. Why? Because each such tree must get at least one odd watering. \n\n  But note: one tree might require more than one odd watering? For example, if a tree needs 3 units: that can be 1+2 (one odd and one even) -> but then the odd watering count for that tree is 1 (odd). Or 3 odd waterings? But that would be 3 days: 1+1+1 -> but that would be 3 odd days. \n\n  However, we are trying to minimize the total days. We would prefer to use as many even waterings as possible. So the minimal requirement for the odd days is the number of trees that require an odd total growth? \n\n  Actually, the requirement is: the total number of odd days must be at least the maximum over the trees of the minimal odd waterings required? \n\n  But note: we can assign multiple odd waterings to the same tree. So the constraint is that the total number of odd days must be at least the maximum of the minimal odd waterings per tree? \n\n  However, the known solution in the code uses: 2*p1-1, which is an odd number. What is p1? \n\n  The code sets:\n      if the target is even: p1 = odd   (the count of trees that are odd in the entire list? but note: the maximum trees are even, so the non-maximum trees that are odd require an odd growth? because even - odd = odd. And the non-maximum trees that are even require even growth? \n      Similarly, if the target is odd: p1 = even   (because odd - even = odd).\n\n  So p1 is the count of non-maximum trees that require an odd growth? Actually, the entire list is considered? But note: the maximum trees do not require any growth. So the non-maximum trees that are of opposite parity to the target require an odd total growth.\n\n  Therefore, we must have at least p1 odd days? But why 2*p1-1? \n\n  Actually, 2*p1-1 is the minimal total days that can provide at least p1 odd days? \n\n      How many odd days in d days? = (d+1)//2.\n\n      We require (d+1)//2 >= p1.\n\n      The minimal d that satisfies that: \n          d_min = 2*p1 - 1   (because if d=2*p1-1, then (2*p1-1+1)//2 = (2*p1)//2 = p1).\n\n  So the constraint is: the total days must be at least max( minimal_days_by_total_growth, 2*p1-1 ).\n\n  Similarly, for the alternative target (target = maximum+1), we have:\n        total_growth = needed + n   (because each tree now needs one more, and there are n trees? but note: the non-maximum trees: we already accounted for the deficit to the maximum, and then we add 1 for every tree? Actually, the maximum trees now need 1 more, and the non-maximum trees need (maximum+1 - h_i) = (maximum - h_i) + 1. So total_growth = needed + (n-a) [for non-max] + a [for max] = needed + n.\n\n  And for the parity: \n        if the target is maximum+1, then the parity of the target is the opposite of the maximum.\n        So if the maximum was even, then maximum+1 is odd -> so now we set p2 = even? Actually, the code sets:\n            if l[-1]%2==0: p1=odd, p2=even -> then for the alternative target (which is odd) we use p2? \n            and then the constraint for the alternative target is: the total days must be at least 2*p2-1.\n\n  Therefore, the candidate for the target = maximum is: \n        d1 = max( formula(needed), 2*p1-1 )\n  and for target = maximum+1:\n        d2 = max( formula(needed+n), 2*p2-1 )\n\n  Then we take the minimum of d1 and d2.\n\n  Why only two targets? Because the next target would be maximum+2, but then the total growth is needed+2*n, and the minimal days would be at least 2*n, which is more than the candidate we have? \n\n  Actually, the problem says we can choose any common height. But the minimal days might be achieved at maximum or maximum+1? \n\n  Why? Because the growth per two days is 3. So modulo 3, we might get a better fit at maximum+1.\n\n  Therefore, the code is complete except for the odd count.\n\n  So for program1.py, the missing line is: \n        odd += 1\n\n  But note: the existing code already has:\n        if i%2==0:\n            even+=1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we complete the else with: odd += 1.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  The problem: tiling a bathroom floor of dimensions w x l (at least 3x3) with:\n      interior: (w-2)*(l-2) tiles of 1x1\n      boundary: using tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated, so also ax1)\n\n  We are to find all positive integers a for which the tiling is possible.\n\n  The boundary consists of:\n      The four edges, but note the corners are shared.\n\n  The boundary area = total area - interior area = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l-2)\n\n  The boundary must be tiled with tiles of size 1xa (or a x 1). Therefore, the area of the boundary must be divisible by a? But note: the tiles can be placed horizontally or vertically, and they must cover the entire boundary without gaps.\n\n  However, the boundary is a cycle? Actually, it is a rectangular frame. The frame has:\n      top row: l tiles (from (0,0) to (0,l-1))\n      bottom row: l tiles (from (w-1,0) to (w-1,l-1))\n      left column (without the corners already counted): w-2 tiles (from (1,0) to (w-2,0))\n      right column: w-2 tiles (from (1,l-1) to (w-2,l-1))\n\n  So total boundary tiles = 2*l + 2*(w-2) = 2*(w+l-2) -> matches.\n\n  Now, the tiling condition: the entire boundary must be covered by tiles of length a. This means that a must be a divisor of the boundary area? But note: the tiles are 1xa, so they cover a squares. Therefore, a must divide 2*(w+l-2). However, that is not sufficient.\n\n  We also have to check that the boundary can be partitioned into segments of length a. The boundary is connected and forms a cycle. The condition for a cycle to be partitioned into segments of length a is that a must divide the total length of the cycle? But the total length of the cycle is 2*(w+l-2). So a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). \n\n  However, there is an additional constraint: the corners. The tile that covers a corner must be placed so that it covers the corner and then extends along one of the sides. But note the tile can be rotated, so it can extend horizontally or vertically.\n\n  Actually, the problem is more subtle. We have to check the possibility of tiling the boundary without gaps. The known solution (from Codeforces) is to consider the divisors of the half_perimeter = w+l-2 (which is the length of one of the two cycles? Actually, the boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l-2) but we can break it into two parts? \n\n  The provided code:\n\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n      solutions = {1, 2}\n\n      Then it iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) to find divisors.\n\n      For each divisor i of half_perimeter, it considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i.\n\n      Then for each a in [i, div]:\n          mod_a = w % a\n          if mod_a <= 2:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  What is the condition? \n\n  The known solution for this problem (Codeforces Round #685 (Div. 2), problem D) is:\n\n      The valid a are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that satisfy one of the following:\n\n        Condition 1: The entire boundary can be tiled without breaking the corners? \n\n      Actually, we can break the boundary into four segments (top, right, bottom, left). The top has length l, the right has length w-2, the bottom has length l, the left has length w-2.\n\n      We require that each segment can be partitioned into tiles of length a, but note that the tiles can cross the corners? \n\n      Actually, the tile can cover two adjacent sides? For example, a tile that covers the top-right corner must cover part of the top and part of the right. \n\n      Therefore, the tiling must be such that at each corner, the tile that covers the corner must extend along one of the sides. \n\n      There are two ways to cover the corner: \n          Option A: the tile covers the corner and goes along the top (so the tile is horizontal) and then the next tile on the right side starts at the next cell.\n          Option B: the tile covers the corner and goes along the right (so the tile is vertical) and then the next tile on the top starts at the next cell.\n\n      But note: the tile can be of length a, so it might cover more than one cell on the top and then turn to the right? Actually, the tile is 1xa: it is a straight tile. It can be placed horizontally or vertically, but it cannot bend.\n\n      Therefore, the tile that covers the corner must be placed so that it covers the corner and then extends along one of the sides. But then the entire side must be partitioned by tiles that start at the corner? \n\n      Actually, the problem is that the corner must be covered by a tile that is aligned with one of the sides. Then the adjacent side must be covered by tiles that start at the corner? \n\n      The known solution is to consider the following four cases:\n\n        Case 1: The corner (0,0) is covered by a horizontal tile that covers [0,0] to [0, a-1]. Then the next tile on the top must start at (0,a). The corner (0,l-1) must be covered by a horizontal tile that covers [0, l-a] to [0, l-1]. Then the top side from (0,a) to (0, l-a-1) must be covered by horizontal tiles? But then the length of the top side between the two horizontal tiles is l - 2*a. This must be nonnegative and divisible by a? \n\n        Similarly, the left side: the corner (0,0) is already covered, so the next tile on the left side must start at (1,0) and go down? But then the left side from (1,0) to (w-1,0) must be covered by vertical tiles. The length of the left side (without corners) is w-2. This must be divisible by a? \n\n        But note: the corner (w-1,0) must be covered by a vertical tile that covers [w-a,0] to [w-1,0]? Then the bottom side must start at (w-1, a) ? \n\n        This becomes messy.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the following known solution:\n\n        The valid a are the divisors of half_perimeter (which is w+l-2) and also the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that satisfy one of the following:\n\n          Condition 1: w mod a is 0 or 1 or 2? \n          Condition 2: similarly for l mod a? \n\n      The provided code checks: \n          mod_a = w % a\n          if mod_a <= 2:\n              # then what? \n\n      Then it does something? \n\n      Actually, the known solution from the sample code (from the problem) is:\n\n          solutions.add(a)\n\n      But wait, the sample test case: w=3, l=5 -> half_perimeter = 3+5-2=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6. Then for each divisor a, we check w % a (which is 3 % a) and if <=2 then add? \n\n        a=1: 3%1=0 -> add -> solutions={1,2} already has 1? so still {1,2} -> then we add 1? but it's already there.\n        a=2: 3%2=1 -> add -> solutions becomes {1,2} (still)\n        a=3: 3%3=0 -> add -> solutions now {1,2,3}\n        a=6: 3%6=3 -> skip.\n\n        Then we also consider the divisors of 2*(w+l-2)=12? But the code only iterates on divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n      The code: \n          for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n              if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n              for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                  mod_a = w % a\n                  if mod_a <= 2:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n      But note: the solutions set initially has {1,2}. Then we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter (which is 6) and we get i=2,3. Then a in [2,3] and [3,2] (but set avoids duplicates). Then for a=2: w%2=1<=2 -> then we do what? \n\n      The code does not add a? It only has a TODO.\n\n      Actually, the condition might be: \n          if mod_a <= 2: then we can cover the top and bottom? \n          and also we need to check the other dimension? \n\n      But note: the boundary is symmetric. The known solution is to check:\n\n          if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a == 0) or ...? \n\n      Actually, we have to check the entire frame. The frame has four corners. The tile that covers the corner (0,0) must extend either horizontally or vertically. \n\n      The known solution (from known AC code) is:\n\n          if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a == 0) or (l % a <= 2) and (w % a == 0) -> but that is not exactly.\n\n      Alternatively, we can check:\n\n          The top side: from (0,0) to (0,l-1): we can cover the top side if we start at (0,0) with a horizontal tile of length a, then the next tile starts at (0,a). The entire top side must be covered. The length of the top side is l. So we require that l mod a == 0? \n\n          But wait, the tile at the corner (0,0) might be placed vertically? Then the top side would start at (0,1) and then we require (l-1) mod a == 0? \n\n      Therefore, we have two possibilities for the top side:\n\n          Possibility 1: the corner (0,0) is covered by a horizontal tile -> then the top side from (0,0) to (0,l-1) is covered by horizontal tiles, so l mod a == 0.\n\n          Possibility 2: the corner (0,0) is covered by a vertical tile -> then the top side starts at (0,1) and goes to (0,l-1) -> length l-1, so we require (l-1) mod a == 0.\n\n      Similarly, for the bottom side, we have two possibilities.\n\n      And for the left side:\n\n          Possibility 1: the corner (0,0) is covered by a vertical tile -> then the left side from (0,0) to (w-1,0) is covered by vertical tiles? -> w mod a == 0.\n\n          Possibility 2: the corner (0,0) is covered by a horizontal tile -> then the left side starts at (1,0) and goes to (w-1,0) -> length w-1, so (w-1) mod a == 0.\n\n      But note: the same tile covers the corner and one side. The entire frame must be covered. The corners are shared.\n\n      Therefore, we have four cases:\n\n        Case 1: \n            corner (0,0): horizontal -> then top: l mod a == 0, and left: (w-1) mod a == 0? \n            corner (0,l-1): horizontal -> then top: l mod a == 0, and right: (w-1) mod a == 0? \n            corner (w-1,0): vertical -> then left: (w-1) mod a == 0, and bottom: (l-1) mod a == 0? \n            corner (w-1,l-1): vertical -> then bottom: (l-1) mod a == 0, and right: (w-1) mod a == 0? \n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            top: from (0,0) to (0,l-1): if we start with horizontal at (0,0) then we require l mod a == 0.\n            left: from (0,0) to (w-1,0): if we start with vertical at (0,0) then we require w mod a == 0, but if we start with horizontal then we leave the left side starting at (1,0) and then we require (w-1) mod a == 0.\n\n          But the same a must work for the entire frame.\n\n      Actually, the known solution in the provided code only checks w mod a and then does something? \n\n      After checking, the AC code in the sample does:\n\n          solutions.add(a)\n\n      But then we must also consider the possibility that a might be 1 and 2? which are already in the set.\n\n      However, the problem says: the output for the first test case (3,5) is 1,2,3.\n\n      How does 3 work? \n          a=3: \n            w=3, l=5.\n            Check w mod a = 3 mod 3 = 0 -> <=2? no, 0<=2 -> yes.\n            Then we add a=3.\n\n      But why is a=3 valid? \n          Boundary area = 2*(3+5-2)=12. 12/3=4, so 4 tiles.\n\n          How to tile?\n            Top: length 5 -> we can break into 3+2? but 2 is not divisible by 3. \n            Alternatively, we can cover the top-left corner with a vertical tile? \n                Place a vertical tile at (0,0): covers (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) -> but then the top row from (0,1) to (0,4) is 4, which is not divisible by 3.\n\n          How about:\n            Top: from (0,0) to (0,2) with a horizontal tile of length 3 -> covers (0,0),(0,1),(0,2)\n            Then top: (0,3) to (0,4): 2 cells -> not divisible by 3.\n\n      But wait, the tile can be placed vertically on the top? Actually, the tile is 1x3, so if placed vertically it would cover 3 rows in one column? but the top row is only one row. So we must place the tile horizontally on the top and vertically on the sides.\n\n      Actually, the known solution in the problem note has a picture for a=3. \n\n      The picture in the note: \n          The first tiling (a=1) is trivial.\n          The second tiling (a=2) is described.\n          The third tiling (a=3) is described.\n\n      How? \n\n      The known solution from the problem note: \n          For a=3, the tiling is:\n            Top row: \n                (0,0) to (0,2): one horizontal tile of length 3.\n                (0,3) to (0,4): cannot be covered by a horizontal tile of length 3? \n            Instead, we can cover the top row with two tiles: \n                (0,0) to (0,0): not a full tile? \n\n      Actually, the tile can be placed vertically on the boundary? The boundary includes the sides. \n\n      The boundary for a 3x5:\n\n          Top: (0,0) to (0,4)\n          Right: (1,4) to (2,4)   [because (0,4) is the top-right corner and (3-1,4) is the bottom-right corner? but w=3, so rows 0,1,2? \n          Bottom: (2,0) to (2,3)   [because (2,4) is the bottom-right corner?]\n          Left: (1,0) to (1,0)   [because (0,0) is top-left and (2,0) is bottom-left] -> so the left side has only one cell in the middle? \n\n      How to cover with a=3?\n\n          We can use:\n            Tile1: vertical at (0,0): covers (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) -> but (2,0) is the bottom-left corner? \n            Then the bottom row: from (2,1) to (2,4): 4 cells -> not divisible by 3.\n\n          Alternatively:\n            Tile1: horizontal at (0,0) to (0,2) -> covers 3 cells.\n            Tile2: vertical at (0,3) to (2,3) -> covers 3 cells? but (0,3) is on the top, (1,3) is in the interior? no, the right boundary is column 4? \n\n      Actually, the bathroom is 3x5, so columns 0 to 4. The right boundary is column 4.\n\n      How about:\n\n          Top: \n            (0,0) to (0,2): horizontal tile (length 3)\n            (0,3) to (0,4): horizontal tile? but that's 2 cells -> not 3.\n\n          Instead, we can break the top at the first cell and then go down the right? \n\n          The known solution in the problem's picture: \n            It shows:\n                The top row: the first two cells are covered by a horizontal tile of length 2? but a=3.\n\n          Actually, the tile of size 1x3 can be placed vertically on the right side? \n\n          We can cover the right side: \n            (0,4) to (2,4): that's 3 cells -> one vertical tile.\n\n          Then the top row: (0,0) to (0,3): 4 cells -> not divisible by 3.\n\n      How about covering the corner (0,0) with a horizontal tile of length 3? \n          Then (0,0) to (0,2) is covered.\n          Then the corner (0,4) is not covered. We cover it with a vertical tile? but the top row at (0,3) and (0,4) remains? \n\n      After reading the note: \"The three tilings are represented in the following pictures.\" \n      We don't have the pictures, but known solution says a=3 is valid.\n\n      The known solution in code from Codeforces for this problem (D. Tiling) is:\n\n          solutions = set()\n          total = 2*(w+l-2)\n          for a in divisors of total? \n          but then check four cases:\n\n          Case 1: \n              if w % a == 0 and l % a == 0: then valid? \n          -> no, because a=1: w%1==0 and l%1==0 -> valid, a=2: similarly.\n\n          But a=3: 3%3=0, but 5%3 !=0 -> not valid.\n\n          Case 2: \n              if (w-1) % a == 0 and (l) % a == 0: \n              and also (w) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0? \n\n          Actually, the known solution is to consider the following four arrangements for the corners:\n\n          Arrangement 1: \n              Cover the top-left corner with a horizontal tile, then the top side must be covered: so the length of the top side is l, and we have already covered a at the beginning, so the remaining is l - a. Then the top side from (0,a) to (0,l-1) must be covered by horizontal tiles -> so (l - a) must be divisible by a? -> l must be divisible by a.\n              Similarly, the left side: we haven't covered the left side at (0,0) because we placed a horizontal tile, so the left side starts at (1,0). Then the entire left side (from (1,0) to (w-1,0)) has length w-1. This must be divisible by a? \n              And the bottom and right similarly? \n\n          But wait, the bottom-left corner: we have a tile that might be placed horizontally on the bottom or vertically on the left? \n\n          The known solution is to check the following four conditions for a divisor a:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or\n               ( (w-1) % a == 0 and l % a == 0 ) or\n               ( w % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 ) or\n               ( (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0 ) or\n               ( w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0 ) or\n               ( (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 )   # but then the corners might be covered by a combination?\n\n          However, the sample a=3 for (3,5):\n\n            Condition 1: 3%3==0, 5%3!=0 -> no.\n            Condition 2: (3-1)=2 %3 !=0 -> no.\n            Condition 3: 3%3==0, (5-1)=4 %3=1 -> no.\n            Condition 4: (3-2)=1 %3=1 -> no.\n            Condition 5: 3%3==0, (5-2)=3%3=0 -> yes.\n\n          So condition 5: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0 -> 3%3==0 and 3%3==0 -> valid.\n\n          What does condition 5 mean? \n              w % a == 0: the left and right sides (which are of length w) can be covered by vertical tiles? \n              (l-2) % a == 0: the top and bottom sides, but without the two corners on each side? \n\n          How? \n              The top side: we cover the two corners of the top with separate tiles? \n                  For the top-left corner: we cover it with a vertical tile (since the left side is covered by vertical tiles) -> then the top side from (0,1) to (0, l-2) is of length l-2, which must be covered by horizontal tiles -> so divisible by a.\n\n          Therefore, the valid a are those that satisfy one of the following:\n\n            (1) a divides both w and l -> then we can cover the entire boundary by horizontal on top/bottom and vertical on left/right.\n            (2) a divides w-1 and l -> then we cover the top-left corner with a vertical tile (covering the left side starting at (0,0)) and then the top side from (0,1) to (0,l-1) must be divisible by a, and the left side from (1,0) to (w-1,0) is w-1, divisible by a, and the bottom and right similarly? \n            (3) a divides w and l-1.\n            (4) a divides w-2 and l.\n            (5) a divides w and l-2.\n            (6) a divides w-1 and l-1.\n\n          But wait, the boundary has two horizontal sides (top and bottom) and two vertical sides (left and right). The corners are shared. The six conditions cover the six ways to assign the corners to the adjacent sides? \n\n          However, the divisor a might be large, and the total number of divisors is O(sqrt(w+l)), and the total over test cases is at most 200000, so we can do.\n\n          The provided code in program2.py currently only checks one condition: w % a <= 2. \n\n          But note: if w % a is 0,1, or 2, then it might be that one of the conditions is satisfied? \n\n          Actually, the condition (5) is w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0. The code only checks w % a <= 2. This is not sufficient.\n\n          The known solution in the provided code might be incomplete.\n\n      But the sample includes a=3 for (3,5) and the code currently would add a=3 because 3%3=0<=2. But then how do we know that a=3 is valid? The condition (5) is satisfied: w%3==0 and (l-2)=3%3==0. \n\n      However, the code does not check the condition on l. \n\n      Therefore, the TODO in program2.py is to check not only w % a <= 2, but also the corresponding condition on l? \n\n      Specifically, if w % a is 0, then we can cover the left and right sides with vertical tiles. Then the top and bottom sides: the top and bottom have length l. But the top and bottom have two corners on each end. We have two options for the top-left corner: cover it with a vertical tile (which we are already doing for the left side) or with a horizontal tile? \n\n      If we cover the top-left corner with a vertical tile, then the top side starts at (0,1) and goes to (0,l-1) -> length l-1. But we require that the entire top side is covered by horizontal tiles? -> then (l-1) must be divisible by a? \n      Or if we cover the top-left corner with a horizontal tile, then the top side from (0,0) to (0,l-1) is covered by horizontal tiles, so l must be divisible by a.\n\n      But wait, we have already covered the top-left corner by a vertical tile (because the left side is covered by vertical tiles and that includes (0,0)). So the top side starts at (0,1). And similarly, the top-right corner is covered by the right side vertical tile? so the top side only has from (0,1) to (0,l-2) -> length l-2. \n\n      Therefore, if we cover the left and right by vertical tiles, then the top and bottom sides have length l-2. So we require that a divides l-2.\n\n      Similarly, if we cover the top and bottom by horizontal tiles, then the left and right sides have length w-2.\n\n      So the conditions are:\n\n        Condition A: cover the left and right by vertical tiles -> then we require a divides w (for the vertical sides) and a divides l-2 (for the horizontal sides).\n\n        Condition B: cover the left and right by vertical tiles, but the top and bottom by horizontal tiles that also cover the corners? -> then we require a divides w and a divides l.\n\n        Condition C: cover the top and bottom by horizontal tiles -> then we require a divides l and a divides w-2.\n\n        Condition D: cover the top-left corner by a horizontal tile and the rest consistently? \n\n      Actually, there are more conditions. The known solution in the editorial for this problem (Codeforces Round #685 (Div. 2), problem D) is to consider the following six conditions:\n\n        The bathroom can be tiled if at least one of the following is true:\n\n          1. w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n          2. (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n          3. (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n          4. (w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0\n          5. (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0\n          6. (w-2) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n\n        But also a must divide the entire boundary area? -> not necessary because the boundary area is 2*(w+l-2), and if a satisfies one of the above, then it might not be a divisor of the boundary area? \n\n        Actually, the boundary area is 2*(w+l-2). If a satisfies one of the above, then it might not divide the boundary area? \n\n        For example, condition 1: \n            w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0.\n            Then the left and right sides: length w, divisible by a -> covered by vertical tiles: w/a * 2 tiles? \n            The top and bottom: length l-2, divisible by a -> covered by horizontal tiles: (l-2)/a * 2 tiles.\n            Total tiles = 2*(w/a + (l-2)/a) = 2*(w+l-2)/a -> so a must divide 2*(w+l-2)? \n\n        But note: the boundary area is 2*(w+l-2), and the total number of tiles is boundary_area / a, so a must divide the boundary area. Therefore, we only consider divisors of 2*(w+l-2) or divisors of w+l-2? \n\n        The provided code iterates over divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2. But 2*(w+l-2) has more divisors. \n\n        The editorial solution is to consider the divisors of (w-1), (w-2), (l-1), (l-2), and also the divisors of the boundary area? \n\n        However, the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers.\n\n        The provided code in program2.py currently only considers the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2. And then for each divisor a, it checks if w % a <= 2. \n\n        But to be complete, we should also consider the divisors of 2*(w+l-2). \n\n        However, the sample (3,5): half_perimeter=6, and 2*(w+l-2)=12. The divisors of 12 include 4,12. \n\n        Should we consider a=4? \n            Condition: \n                Condition 1: w=3 -> 3%4=3 -> not <=2 -> skip.\n            But is a=4 valid? \n                Boundary area=12, 12/4=3, so 3 tiles.\n                How to tile? \n                  We can try condition 5: w %4=3, (l-2)=3 -> 3%4=3 -> not 0.\n                condition 6: (w-2)=1 %4=1, (l-2)=3%4=3 -> not 0.\n                condition 1 to 4 also fail.\n            So a=4 is not valid.\n\n        a=12: similarly.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code might be only checking the divisors of half_perimeter, and then using the condition on w % a to cover some of the conditions? \n\n        But the sample a=3 is added because w%3=0<=2. However, we also need to ensure that the other condition holds (like (l-2)%a==0). \n\n        Therefore, the TODO in program2.py is to check the condition on l as well.\n\n        Specifically, after checking w % a <= 2, we should also check one of the six conditions? \n\n        But note: the condition w % a <= 2 is not enough. We need to know if one of the six conditions is satisfied.\n\n        However, the provided code might be using a different insight: \n\n          The condition w % a <= 2 means that the left and right sides (which are of length w) can be covered by vertical tiles if we allow up to 2 cells to be covered by the horizontal tiles at the corners? \n\n        In fact, the value w % a is the remainder when we try to cover the left/right sides with vertical tiles. If the remainder is 0, then perfect. If the remainder is 1 or 2, then we can cover the extra 1 or 2 cells by extending the horizontal tiles at the top and bottom? \n\n        Similarly, we should also check l % a <= 2? \n\n        But the code only checks w % a. \n\n        The known solution in an AC code for this problem (from a known submission) is:\n\n          for _ in range(int(input())):\n            w, l = map(int, input().split())\n            ans = set()\n            ans.add(1)\n            for param in (w, l, w-1, l-1, w-2, l-2):\n              if param > 0:\n                i = 1\n                while i * i <= param:\n                  if param % i == 0:\n                    ans.add(i)\n                    ans.add(param//i)\n                  i += 1\n            final_ans = set()\n            for a in ans:\n              if a > 2*(w+l): continue  # not necessary, but to be safe\n              # Check condition 1: \n              if (w % a == 0 or (w-1) % a == 0 or (w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0):\n                # But then we need to see if the boundary can be covered? \n                # Actually, the known solution is to add a if it satisfies one of the six conditions on the entire frame.\n                # However, this is not exactly.\n\n            # Instead, the known solution is to check the six conditions explicitly.\n\n          But then the set ans might be too big.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that the provided code in program2.py currently only checks w % a <= 2, and the sample works, but the condition for a=3 requires (l-2)%a==0, which is not checked, we must change the code.\n\n        However, the problem says: the output for the first test case is 1,2,3.\n\n        The provided code currently would output for the first test case: \n            solutions = {1,2} initially.\n            Then it finds the divisors of half_perimeter=6: [2,3,6] (and 1 is already there).\n            For a=2: w%2=1<=2 -> add a=2? but 2 is already there.\n            For a=3: w%3=0<=2 -> add a=3.\n            For a=6: w%6=3>2 -> skip.\n            Then solutions = {1,2,3} -> then output \"3 1 2 3\".\n\n        So it works for the sample. But is it always sufficient to only check w % a <= 2? \n\n        Consider a different test case: w=4, l=4.\n            half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6.\n            Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n            a=1: w%1=0 -> add.\n            a=2: w%2=0 -> add.\n            a=3: w%3=1 -> add.\n            a=6: w%6=4 -> skip.\n            Then solutions = {1,2,3} -> output 3.\n\n        But what are the valid a for (4,4)? \n            Boundary area = 2*(4+4-2)=12.\n            Valid a: divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n            Check conditions:\n\n              a=1: valid.\n              a=2: valid.\n              a=3: condition 1: w=4 -> 4%3=1, (l-2)=2 -> 2%3=2 -> not 0 -> condition 1 fails.\n                     condition 2: (w-2)=2%3=2, l=4%3=1 -> fail.\n                     condition 3: (w-1)=3%3=0, (l-2)=2%3=2 -> fail.\n                     condition 4: (w-2)=2%3=2, (l-1)=3%3=0 -> fail.\n                     condition 5: (w-1)=3%3=0, (l-1)=3%3=0 -> valid.\n                     condition 6: (w-2)=2%3=2, (l-2)=2%3=2 -> fail.\n\n              So a=3 is valid by condition 5.\n\n            a=4: condition 1: 4%4=0, (4-2)=2%4=2 -> fail.\n                  condition 2: (4-2)=2%4=2, 4%4=0 -> fail.\n                  condition 3: (4-1)=3%4=3, (4-2)=2%4=2 -> fail.\n                  condition 4: (4-2)=2%4=2, (4-1)=3%4=3 -> fail.\n                  condition 5: (4-1)=3%4=3, (4-1)=3%4=3 -> fail.\n                  condition 6: (4-2)=2%4=2, (4-2)=2%4=2 -> fail.\n                  -> not valid.\n\n            a=6: similarly, not valid.\n            a=12: not valid.\n\n            So valid a: 1,2,3.\n\n            The code would output 1,2,3 -> matches.\n\n        How did a=3 get added? \n            In the code: w=4, a=3: 4%3=1<=2 -> so we add.\n\n        Therefore, it seems that the condition w % a <=2 is sufficient to cover all six conditions? \n\n        Why? \n            If w % a = r, where r is 0,1, or 2, then it means that the left and right sides (length w) can be partitioned into vertical tiles if we allow up to 2 cells to be covered by the horizontal tiles at the top and bottom. \n\n            Specifically:\n                If r=0: then the left and right sides can be exactly covered by vertical tiles.\n                If r=1: then we are one cell short on each side? but then we can cover one cell by a horizontal tile at the top and one cell by a horizontal tile at the bottom? \n                If r=2: then we are two cells short, and we can cover them by the horizontal tiles.\n\n            Similarly, the value l % a might be handled by the horizontal tiles? \n\n            But the code does not check l % a. \n\n        However, in the condition for the entire boundary, the horizontal sides (top and bottom) have length l, and the vertical sides have length w. The corners are shared. The covering of the corners might absorb the remainder.\n\n        Therefore, the condition w % a <=2 might be sufficient. \n\n        But consider a test case: w=5, l=3, a=3.\n            half_perimeter = 5+3-2=6.\n            w % a = 5 % 3 = 2 -> <=2, so we add.\n            But is a=3 valid for (5,3)? \n                This is the transpose of (3,5) -> which is valid.\n            So it is valid.\n\n        Another: w=5, l=5, a=3.\n            half_perimeter=8, divisors: 1,2,4,8.\n            a=3 is not a divisor of 8? -> so not considered.\n\n        But wait, the boundary area=2*(5+5-2)=16, and 16 is not divisible by 3, so a=3 is not a divisor of the boundary area? -> so it shouldn't be considered.\n\n        The provided code only considers divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2. In this case, 8, and 3 is not a divisor of 8, so it is not considered.\n\n        Therefore, the code is only considering the divisors of half_perimeter, and then filtering by w % a <=2.\n\n        But note: the boundary area is 2*(w+l-2), so a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). The divisors of half_perimeter (w+l-2) are also divisors of the boundary area? because boundary_area = 2 * half_perimeter. So if a divides half_perimeter, then a divides boundary_area.\n\n        However, there might be divisors of boundary_area that are not divisors of half_perimeter, for example, if half_perimeter=6, then boundary_area=12, and 4 is a divisor of 12 but not of 6. \n\n        Should we consider a=4 for (3,5)? \n            We saw that a=4 is not valid.\n\n        But consider a test case where a=4 might be valid: w=6, l=6.\n            half_perimeter=6+6-2=10.\n            boundary_area=2*10=20.\n            Divisors of 20: 1,2,4,5,10,20.\n            The code only considers divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n            Then for a=4: not considered.\n\n            Is a=4 valid for (6,6)? \n                Condition 1: w=6%4=2, (l-2)=4%4=0 -> valid.\n                So a=4 should be valid.\n\n        Therefore, the code should also consider the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that are not divisors of w+l-2.\n\n        The provided code currently does not do that.\n\n        How to fix? \n            We can iterate over the divisors of boundary_area = 2*(w+l-2). But the problem says the output has at most 200000 integers, and the number of divisors of a number up to 2e9 is about 1344, and we have t up to 100, so 100*1344 = 134400, which is within 200000.\n\n        But the provided code currently only iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter.\n\n        We are to complete the code as given. The TODO is inside the loop that iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n        The code might be incomplete. We should also iterate over the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that are not covered by the divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n        However, the provided code structure is:\n\n            solutions = {1,2}\n            for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n                for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                    mod_a = w % a\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are not told to change the loop, only to complete the TODO.\n\n        The TODO might be to also check the condition for the other dimension? \n\n        But the sample works without that.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that the known solution in the editorial uses the six conditions, but the provided code uses a simpler condition, and the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, we will trust the provided code structure and only complete the TODO.\n\n        The TODO is: we should add the divisor a to the set of solutions.\n\n        So the missing line is:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n        But wait, the code already has solutions = {1,2}. Then we are to add a if the condition holds.\n\n        And for the sample (3,5) we add a=3.\n\n        And for (4,4) we add a=3.\n\n        And for (6,6) we would not get a=4 in the loop because we only iterate on divisors of half_perimeter=10, and 4 is not a divisor of 10. So we miss a=4.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code might be insufficient. \n\n        But the problem says: output only the missing code. We are to complete the given code.\n\n        The given code only iterates on the divisors of half_perimeter. We are to complete the TODO by adding the divisor a to the set.\n\n        So the missing line is: \n            solutions.add(a)\n\n        And then after the loop, we output the sorted list.\n\n        We hope that the set of divisors of half_perimeter and the condition w % a <=2 is sufficient to cover all valid a. \n\n        Why might it be sufficient? \n            The valid a must be a divisor of boundary_area = 2*(w+l-2). And the divisors of boundary_area include the divisors of half_perimeter and also the divisors of 2 that are not in half_perimeter? \n\n            But note: boundary_area = 2 * half_perimeter, so the divisors of boundary_area are: \n                all divisors of half_perimeter, and \n                all divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2 (if they are not already in half_perimeter) -> but wait, not exactly: \n                    If d is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2*d might be a divisor of boundary_area, but only if d is also a divisor of half_perimeter? \n\n            Actually, the divisors of boundary_area are the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            The code currently only considers the divisors of half_perimeter. We are missing the divisors that are of the form 2*d where d is a divisor of half_perimeter, and also the divisors that are divisors of boundary_area that are not of this form.\n\n        Given the TODO only asks for one line, and the problem sample works, we output the line.\n\n        So for program2.py, the missing line is:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the condition might be symmetric in w and l? The code only checks w % a. What if we should also check l % a? \n\n        Consider a test case: w=3, l=5, but if we swap: w=5, l=3. Then the code would do:\n            half_perimeter = 5+3-2=6.\n            a=3: w % a = 5 % 3 = 2 -> add.\n            a=2: 5%2=1 -> add.\n            a=6: 5%6=5 -> skip.\n            solutions = {1,2,3} -> works.\n\n        Consider a test case: w=4, l=3.\n            half_perimeter=4+3-2=5.\n            divisors: 1,5.\n            a=1: add.\n            a=5: 4%5=4 -> skip.\n            solutions = {1,2} (initially) plus a=1 -> {1,2}? but 1 is already there, and we don't add anything else.\n\n            But is a=1 and a=2 valid? \n                a=1: valid.\n                a=2: valid? \n                    Boundary area=2*(4+3-2)=10.\n                    a=2: 10/2=5 tiles.\n                    How to tile? \n                      We can cover the entire boundary with 1x2 tiles.\n                    For example, the top: 3 cells: one tile and one cell? -> but 3 is not divisible by 2.\n                    Condition: \n                      condition 1: w=4%2=0, (l-2)=1%2=1 -> fail.\n                      condition 2: (w-2)=2%2=0, l=3%2=1 -> fail.\n                      condition 3: (w-1)=3%2=1, (l-2)=1%2=1 -> condition 5: (w-1)%2=1, (l-1)%2=0 -> fail.\n                      condition 5: (w-1)=3%2=1, (l-1)=2%2=0 -> fail.\n                      condition 6: (w-2)=2%2=0, (l-2)=1%2=1 -> fail.\n                    -> not valid.\n\n            But wait, the known solution in the problem for (3,5) includes a=2. For (4,3) we should check:\n\n              a=2: \n                 condition 5: (w-1)=3%2=1, (l-1)=2%2=0 -> fail.\n                 condition 6: (w-2)=2%2=0, (l-2)=1%2=1 -> fail.\n\n            How about condition that uses both remainders? \n\n            The provided condition in the code: w % a <=2 -> for a=2, w=4: 4%2=0<=2 -> add.\n\n            But it is not valid.\n\n            Therefore, the condition w % a <=2 is not sufficient.\n\n        Given the time, and that the problem asks to output only the missing code, we output the line as in the sample.\n\n        We hope the judge's test cases are not including (4,3) or we are missing something.\n\n        Actually, the bathroom is 4x3:\n\n            The boundary:\n                top: 3 cells\n                bottom: 3 cells\n                left: 4-2=2 cells (because the corners are shared)\n                right: 2 cells.\n\n            Total=3+3+2+2=10.\n\n            With a=2: each tile covers 2 cells. 10/2=5 tiles.\n\n            How to tile? \n                We can do:\n                  Top: can we cover 3 cells with 1x2 tiles? \n                      We can cover the first two cells of the top with one tile, and the last cell? -> but then the last cell is the top-right corner. We can cover it with a vertical tile in the right side? \n                  Specifically:\n                    Tile1: (0,0) and (0,1) -> horizontal.\n                    Tile2: (0,2) and (1,2) -> vertical.  [covers the top-right corner and the cell below]\n                    Tile3: (1,0) and (2,0) -> vertical? but then we have (3,0) left.\n                    ...\n\n            It is possible? \n\n            The known solution in the editorial might have more conditions.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that the problem sample works, and the provided code structure, we output the line.\n\n        So for program2.py, the missing line is:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\nFor program3.py:\n\n  The problem: We are allowed to do operations: choose an index i (from 2 to n) and set a_i = a_i - a_{i-1]. We can do any number of operations. We want to know if we can make a_i=0 for all i from 2 to n.\n\n  The provided function:\n\n      def diff_ops(arr):\n          result = True\n          for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n              result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n          return result\n\n  Then the main:\n\n      We read the input, and then we are to split the input into test cases.\n\n      The input format: \n          first integer: t (number of test cases)\n          then for each test case:\n              first integer: n\n              then n integers: a1, a2, ..., an.\n\n      The TODO is in the main: \n          while pos <= len_input - 1:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We need to extract the test cases.\n\n      Specifically, at the beginning, we have:\n          n = input_arr[0]   # but wait, the first integer is t, the number of test cases.\n\n      Actually, the first integer is t, stored in the variable named 'n' -> that is confusing.\n\n      The code:\n\n          input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n          len_input = len(input_arr)\n          n = input_arr[0]   # this is t, the number of test cases\n          test_cases = []\n          pos = 1\n          while pos <= len_input - 1:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We should extract each test case: \n          The next integer is the n for the test case, then n integers.\n\n      So for each test case, we do:\n\n          n_i = input_arr[pos]   # the length of the array for this test case\n          pos += 1\n          arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n          pos += n_i\n          test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      But note: the variable 'n' is already used for the number of test cases. We are in a loop for test cases.\n\n      However, the variable 'n' in the outer scope is the number of test cases. We can reuse the name.\n\n      But the code after the TODO uses:\n\n          for case in test_cases:\n              print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\n      The function diff_ops(case) expects an array of length at least 1.\n\n      But the function diff_ops has a loop for i in range(1, len(arr)): it checks if arr[i] % arr[0] == 0.\n\n      Is this sufficient? \n\n      The problem: \n          Operation: choose i and set a_i = a_i - a_{i-1]. We can do repeatedly.\n\n      We want to make a_i=0 for i>=2.\n\n      Consider:\n\n          We must make a_2=0. How? \n            We can only change a_2 by subtracting a_1. So we do: \n                a_2 = a_2 - k * a_1   (by doing k operations on index2)\n\n            We require a_2 - k * a_1 = 0  => a_2 = k * a_1 => so a_1 must divide a_2.\n\n          Then for a_3: \n            We can change a_3 by subtracting a_2 (which is now 0) -> but that leaves a_3 unchanged.\n            But note: we can do operations in any order and any number of times. We can also do operations on a_3 before we zero out a_2.\n\n            How about: \n                Operation on a_3: a_3 = a_3 - a_2   (but a_2 is not zero yet) -> then a_3 becomes a_3 - a_2.\n                Then we can do operations on a_2 to zero it.\n\n            But then a_3 becomes a_3 - a_2, and then we need to zero out a_3: we can subtract a_1 repeatedly? \n                a_3 - a_2 - k * a_1 = 0 => a_3 = a_2 + k * a_1.\n\n            But a_2 is a multiple of a_1, so a_3 must be a multiple of a_1.\n\n          Similarly, for a_4: we can only change it by subtracting a_3 (which will eventually become a multiple of a_1) and then we can subtract a_1 repeatedly? \n\n          Therefore, it seems that the condition is that every element from a_2 to a_n must be divisible by a_1.\n\n          But consider the example: [1, 2, 3] \n              The function diff_ops: \n                  a1=1, \n                  a2=2: 2%1==0 -> True.\n                  a3=3: 3%1==0 -> True.\n              returns True -> output \"YES\", which matches.\n\n          Example: [5,10] -> \n                  a2=10: 10%5==0 -> True.\n\n          But consider: [2, 3]\n              a2=3: 3%2=1 !=0 -> False -> \"NO\".\n\n          But can we do [2,3]?\n              Operation on index2: a2 = 3-2 = 1 -> [2,1]\n              Then operation on index2: a2 = 1-2 = -1 -> not zero.\n              Or after [2,1]: we cannot do more? \n              We can do:\n                 First: [2,3] -> [2,1] (by one operation: 3-2=1)\n                 Then we can do on index2 again: 1-2 = -1, then -1-2 = -3, ... never zero.\n\n          So it is not possible.\n\n          But consider: [3, 5]\n              Operation1: 5-3=2 -> [3,2]\n              Operation2: 2-3 = -1 -> [3,-1] -> not zero.\n\n          How did the example [1,2,3] work? \n              Step1: i=3: a3 = 3-2=1 -> [1,2,1]\n              Step2: i=2: a2 = 2-1=1 -> [1,1,1]\n              Step3: i=3: a3 = 1-1=0 -> [1,1,0]\n              Step4: i=2: a2 = 1-1=0 -> [1,0,0]\n\n          But note: the function diff_ops([1,2,3]) returns True because 2%1==0 and 3%1==0.\n\n          Now consider: [3, 6, 7]\n              a1=3, a2=6: divisible by 3 -> True.\n              a3=7: 7%3=1 -> not divisible -> False.\n\n          But can we do it?\n              We want to make a3=0 and a2=0.\n\n              First, we can make a2=0: \n                  a2 = 6 - 2*3 = 0 -> by two operations on index2: [3,6,7] -> [3, 6-3=3, 7] -> [3, 3, 7]\n                  then [3, 3-3=0, 7] -> [3,0,7]\n\n              Then for a3: we can do operations on index3: \n                  a3 = 7 - a2 = 7 - 0 = 7 -> unchanged? \n                  But we can do operations on index3 before we zero out a2? \n                      [3,6,7] -> \n                         first, on index3: a3 = 7 - 6 = 1 -> [3,6,1]\n                         then on index2: a2 = 6-3=3 -> [3,3,1]\n                         then on index2: a2=3-3=0 -> [3,0,1]\n                         then on index3: a3=1-0=1 -> unchanged? \n                         or we can do index3: a3=1-0=1 -> still 1.\n\n              Alternatively, \n                  [3,6,7] -> \n                      index3: 7-6=1 -> [3,6,1]\n                      index3 again: 1-6 (but a2 is still 6) -> 1-6 = -5 -> [3,6,-5] -> then we can do index2: 6-3=3 -> [3,3,-5] -> then index2: 3-3=0 -> [3,0,-5] -> then index3: -5-0 = -5 -> not zero.\n\n          So it is not possible.\n\n          Therefore, the function diff_ops might be correct: it checks that every element is divisible by a1.\n\n          But consider a counterexample: [2, 4, 5]\n              a1=2, a2=4: divisible by 2 -> True.\n              a3=5: 5%2=1 -> False.\n\n          But can we do it?\n              We can make a2=0: \n                  a2 = 4 - 2*2 = 0 -> [2,0,5]\n              Then a3: we can only subtract a2=0, so a3 remains 5.\n\n              Alternatively, we do operations on a3 first:\n                  a3 = 5 - 4 = 1 -> [2,4,1]\n                  then a3 = 1 - 4 = -3 -> [2,4,-3]\n                  then a2 = 4-2=2 -> [2,2,-3]\n                  then a2 = 2-2=0 -> [2,0,-3]\n                  then a3 = -3 -0 = -3 -> not zero.\n\n          So it is not possible.\n\n          But consider: [2, 1, 5] \n              This is not allowed because the first element is 2, and then 1? \n              We can do:\n                 First, we can do on index2: a2 = 1-2 = -1 -> [2,-1,5]\n                 Then on index3: a3 = 5 - (-1) = 6 -> [2,-1,6]\n                 Then on index3: a3 = 6 - (-1) = 7 -> not helpful.\n\n          How about: \n                 [2,1,5] -> \n                    index3: 5-1=4 -> [2,1,4]\n                    index2: 1-2 = -1 -> [2,-1,4]\n                    index3: 4 - (-1) = 5 -> [2,-1,5] -> loop.\n\n          It seems impossible.\n\n          But wait, the problem says: we can only do operations on index i from 2 to n. We cannot change a1.\n\n          Therefore, the entire process leaves a1 unchanged.\n\n          And then we require that a2, a3, ... become 0.\n\n          The operations are linear: \n              a2 becomes a linear combination of the original a1 and a2: \n                  a2 = a2 - k1 * a1   (for some nonnegative integer k1)\n              a3 becomes a3 - k2 * a2 - k3 * a1   (but note: we can do operations on a3 only after we have done some on a2, and then we can do more on a2 after a3? \n\n          Actually, the operations can be interleaved arbitrarily. \n\n          The known solution from the editorial: \n              It is possible if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the entire array is a1, and a1 divides every element.\n\n          But wait, the example [1,2,3]: \n              gcd(1,2,3)=1, and a1=1, and 1 divides every element -> valid.\n\n          [2,3]: \n              gcd(2,3)=1, but a1=2, and 1 is not 2 -> not valid? \n              But the condition in the function: 3%2 !=0 -> not valid.\n\n          [3,6,7]:\n              gcd(3,6,7)=1, and a1=3, and 1 != 3 -> not valid.\n\n          But consider: [4, 8, 12] \n              gcd=4, a1=4, and 4 divides every element -> valid.\n              We can do: \n                  a2: 8 - 2*4 = 0.\n                  a3: 12 - 3*4 = 0.\n\n          How about [4, 8, 10]?\n              gcd(4,8,10)=2, and a1=4, and 2 != 4 -> not valid.\n              The function: \n                  a2=8: 8%4=0 -> True.\n                  a3=10: 10%4=2 -> not 0 -> False.\n\n          How about [3, 6, 9, 12]? \n              gcd=3, a1=3 -> valid.\n\n          But consider [3, 6, 9, 11]:\n              gcd=1, not 3 -> not valid.\n\n          However, the function: \n              a2=6%3=0 -> True.\n              a3=9%3=0 -> True.\n              a4=11%3=2 -> not 0 -> False.\n\n          Therefore, the function diff_ops is sufficient: it checks that every element is divisible by a1.\n\n          Why is that equivalent to the gcd condition? \n              If every element is divisible by a1, then the gcd is at least a1. But also, a1 is in the array, so the gcd is a divisor of a1. Therefore, the gcd is a1.\n\n          So the condition is: \n              gcd = a1, and a1 divides every element.\n\n          But note: the function only checks divisibility by a1, and a1 is fixed. And the gcd must be a divisor of a1, and if every element is divisible by a1 then the gcd is at least a1, and since a1 is in the array, the gcd is a1.\n\n          Therefore, the function is correct.\n\n      So the TODO in program3.py is to extract the test cases.\n\n      We do:\n\n          for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n              n_i = input_arr[pos]\n              pos += 1\n              arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n              pos += n_i\n              test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases, and we are going to use it to loop.\n\n      However, the code uses a while loop. We can do:\n\n          for _ in range(n):\n              n_i = input_arr[pos]\n              pos += 1\n              arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n              pos += n_i\n              test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      But the problem says: the first integer is t (stored in n), then t test cases.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n              test_case = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n              pos += size\n              test_cases.append(test_case)\n\n      But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases, and we are using it.\n\n      So the missing code in the while loop is:\n\n          We change the while loop to a for loop? But the code uses a while loop.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          while n > 0:   # but we are not allowed to change the while condition.\n\n      The problem says: complete the code in the TODO.\n\n      The current structure:\n\n          while pos <= len_input - 1:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We want to extract one test case per iteration.\n\n      But the number of test cases is n, and we have a while loop that runs until we run out of input.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          while pos <= len_input - 1:\n              n_i = input_arr[pos]   # the next integer is the size of the array\n              pos += 1\n              arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n              pos += n_i\n              test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      But note: the total input has exactly t test cases, and the sum of the sizes is (n1 + n2 + ... + nt) = total integers, and the input has t + (n1+n2+...+nt) integers.\n\n      The while condition: while pos <= len_input-1.\n\n      This will work.\n\n      However, we know the number of test cases is n (which is the first integer). We could also do for _ in range(n): but the code uses a while.\n\n      So the missing code is:\n\n          n_i = input_arr[pos]   # the size of the current test case\n          pos += 1\n          arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n          pos += n_i\n          test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      But note: the variable 'n' is already used for the number of test cases. We use n_i for the size.\n\n      So:\n\n          while pos <= len_input - 1:\n              size = input_arr[pos]\n              pos += 1\n              arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n              pos += size\n              test_cases.append(arr)\n\n      This will extract all test cases.\n\n  Therefore, for program3.py, the missing code is:\n\n      size = input_arr[pos]\n      pos += 1\n      arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n      test_cases.append(arr)\n      pos += size\n\n  But note: we must update pos.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      size = input_arr[pos]\n      pos += 1\n      arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n      test_cases.append(arr)\n      pos += size\n\n  However, we can combine:\n\n      test_cases.append(input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+input_arr[pos]])\n      pos += input_arr[pos] + 1\n\n  But for clarity, we break it.\n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n  We output:\n\n      size = input_arr[pos]\n      pos += 1\n      arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n      test_cases.append(arr)\n      pos += size\n\n  But note: the next test case starts at pos, and we have to advance pos by size.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do in one line:\n\n      test_cases.append(input_arr[pos:pos+input_arr[pos]+1])   -> no, because we want the next 'size' integers, and we have already read the size.\n\n      Actually, we have at pos: the size, then the next 'size' integers.\n\n      So:\n\n          test_cases.append( input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+input_arr[pos]] )\n          pos = pos + input_arr[pos] + 1\n\n      But that is two lines.\n\n  We'll do the three-line version for clarity.\n\nSummary:\n\n  program1.py: \n      missing line: \"odd += 1\"\n\n  program2.py:\n      missing line: \"solutions.add(a)\"\n\n  program3.py:\n      missing block:\n          size = input_arr[pos]\n          pos += 1\n          arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n          test_cases.append(arr)\n          pos += size\n\nBut note: the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\".\n\nWe output:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"odd += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"solutions.add(a)\",\n  \"program3\": \"size = input_arr[pos]\\n        pos += 1\\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n        test_cases.append(arr)\\n        pos += size\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program3.py code has indentation. The existing code has:\n\n    while pos <= len_input - 1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the block, so we need to indent the block by 8 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code, and we are to output the code that goes in the TODO.\n\nWe output the code as a string with newlines.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\nWe output the JSON.\n\nBut note: the program3 block has multiple lines. We use a string with embedded newlines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\nWe output the JSON string.\n\nLet me write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"odd += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"solutions.add(a)\",\n  \"program3\": \"size = input_arr[pos]\\n        pos += 1\\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n        test_cases.append(arr)\\n        pos += size\"\n}\n\nBut the indentation in the program3 block: the existing code in program3.py has 4-space indents. The block we output should be indented by 8 spaces? because the while loop is already indented by 4, and the TODO is inside the while.\n\nBut the problem does not require the exact indentation? as long as the code is syntactically correct.\n\nWe output the code with 8 spaces for the block, but in the string we use the same level of indentation as the surrounding code.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without extra spaces:\n\n  \"size = input_arr[pos]\\n    pos += 1\\n    arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n    test_cases.append(arr)\\n    pos += size\"\n\nBut the existing code in the while loop is at the same level as the TODO comment, which is 4 spaces from the while, and the while is 4 spaces from the module level.\n\nSo the block should be indented by 4 spaces within the while loop.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  \"size = input_arr[pos]\\n    pos += 1\\n    arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n    test_cases.append(arr)\\n    pos += size\"\n\nBut the variable name 'size' might be any name. We can use 'n_i' as well, but the problem does not specify.\n\nWe'll use the code as above.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"odd += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"solutions.add(a)\",\n  \"program3\": \"size = input_arr[pos]\\n    pos += 1\\n    arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n    test_cases.append(arr)\\n    pos += size\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program3 code has a variable named 'size'. We can use any name.\n\nHowever, the variable 'size' is not defined elsewhere. It is safe.\n\nBut the existing code uses 'n' for the number of test cases, so we avoid 'n' for the size.\n\nWe output the JSON."
