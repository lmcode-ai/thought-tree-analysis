For each segment, S_i is the set of integer points in [l_i, r_i]. We consider all 3^(n-1) ways to choose an array of n-1 operations (each being either union, symmetric difference, or intersection). We need to compute the sum of the sizes of the set expressions formed by combining the sets S_1 to S_n with these operations (in order) over all possible operation sequences.\n\n**Input:**\nFirst integer n (2<=n<=300000), then n lines with l_i and r_i.\n\n**Output:**\nThe sum modulo 998244353.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nThe provided code uses a segment tree (or lazy propagation) to update and query the last occurrence index for each integer point. Then, it uses these last occurrence indices to compute the answer.\n\nThe missing part is in the `update` function of the segment tree. Specifically, in the part that propagates the lazy value to the right child.\n\n**Missing Code in program1.py:**\nIn the `update` function, for the right child (2*cur+1), we have:\n```python\n        if 2*cur+1<1200000:\n            if st[2*cur+1]<st[cur]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            update(2*cur+1,(start+end)//2+1,end)\n```\nWe should set the lazy value for the right child if the current node's value is greater. So we set `st[2*cur+1] = st[cur]` (or update it to the current value).\n\nTherefore, the missing line is:\n```python\n                st[2*cur+1] = st[cur]\n```\n\nBut note: the condition checks if the current node's value is greater than the child's. Then we update the child to the current node's value.\n\nSo the completion for the TODO is:\n```python\n                st[2*cur+1] = st[cur]\n```\n\n### program2.py\n\n**Problem Description:**\nPlace the minimum number of half-queens on an n x n board so that every square is attacked. A half-queen attacks the same row, same column, and one diagonal (the main diagonal a-b = c-d).\n\n**Input:**\nInteger n (1<=n<=100000).\n\n**Output:**\nFirst integer k (minimum number), then k lines with positions (a_i, b_i).\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nThe provided code handles n<=2 and n==3 separately. For n>=4, it uses a loop to find a value `x` such that 3*x+2 <= n.

We set `x = i` and break.\n\nSo the completion for the TODO is:\n```python\n            x = i\n            break\n```\n\n### program3.py\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven two strings s and t, we can remove an occurrence of t in s by replacing it with dots. We want the minimum number of moves to remove all occurrences and the number of distinct sequences of moves (defined by the starting indices of the removed occurrences) that achieve this minimum.\n\n**Input:**\nq test cases. For each, string s and string t (|s|,|t|<=500, total |s| and |t| over test cases <=500).\n\n**Output:**\nFor each test case, two integers: the minimum number of moves and the number of distinct sequences modulo 10^9+7.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming. The state `d[j][i]` seems to represent the best solution (min moves and count) for the substring s[i:j+1]. The array `is_start` is a boolean list where `is_start[i]` is True if the substring s[i:i+len(t)] equals t.\n\nThe missing part is in the DP transition. When we find an occurrence of t starting at k (so `is_start[k]` is True) and we consider removing it, we break the string into two parts: [i, k-1] and [k+len(t), j]. Then we combine the solutions.\n\nThe code currently has:\n```python\n            if l[0] == 0:\n                r = (d[j][k + lt] if j >= k + lt else None) or [0, 1]\n                tt = d[j][i]\n                if tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] + 1:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                elif tt[0] == l[0] + r[0] + 1:\n                    tt[1] = tt[1] + r[1]\n```\n\nWe are to update `tt` (which is the current state for [i, j]) when we found a better solution (fewer moves) or the same number of moves.\n\nIn the if-block, we found a new solution with `l[0] + r[0] + 1` moves. So we set `tt` to a new list `[l[0] + r[0] + 1, r[1]]`? But note: the count of sequences for the left part is 1 (if the left part is empty, then l[0]=0 and l[1]=1) and similarly for the right. However, the total number of sequences for the entire segment [i, j] would be the product of the counts of the left and right? But note: the removal of the occurrence at k is a fixed move. The sequences are independent in the left and right. So the total count is `l[1] * r[1]`.\n\nBut wait: the state `d[j][i]` is for the segment [i, j]. The recurrence is:\n\nWe remove the occurrence at k, then we have two independent segments: [i, k-1] and [k+lt, j]. The total moves = 1 + moves_left + moves_right.\n\nThe number of sequences: the moves in the left and right can be interleaved arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says that the sequences are defined by the set of indices. However, note that the removal at k might overlap with removals in the left or right? But the problem states that we remove non-overlapping occurrences? Actually, the problem does not explicitly say non-overlapping, but when we replace with dots, we break the string. The example: \"abababacababa\" and t=\"aba\": we remove at index 0 (0-indexed?) and then at index 4? But note: the example removes at the 3rd and 9th positions (which are 1-indexed). The removals cannot overlap because we replace with dots and then the dots break the string.\n\nHowever, the DP state is defined on contiguous segments? Actually, the code uses indices i and j for the substring s[i:j+1]. But when we remove an occurrence at k, we break the segment [i, j] into [i, k-1] and [k+lt, j]. The two segments are independent.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences for the entire segment is the product of the sequences for the two segments. But note: the removal at k is one move. The entire sequence is: any sequence for the left, then the move at k, then any sequence for the right? However, the problem counts sets of indices (so the order of moves does not matter). But note: the problem says \"Two sequences of moves are considered different if the sets of indices ... differ\". So the set of indices is the union of the set from the left, the set from the right, and {k}. And the sets from the left and right are disjoint? Actually, the left segment is [i, k-1] and the right is [k+lt, j], so they are disjoint. Therefore, the entire set is the union. The number of sequences for the entire segment is the product of the sequences for the two segments (because the set is uniquely determined by the sets in the left and right and the one at k).\n\nSo in the if-block, we set:\n```python\n                    tt = [l[0] + r[0] + 1, (l[1] * r[1]) % 1000000007]\n```\n\nBut note: the state `l` is for [i, k-1] and `r` is for [k+lt, j]. However, in the code, `l` is set to `d[k-1][i]` (if k-1>=i) or [0,1] if that segment is empty. Similarly, `r` is set to `d[j][k+lt]` (if j>=k+lt) or [0,1] if empty.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n```python\n                    tt = [l[0] + r[0] + 1, (l[1] * r[1]) % 1000000007]\n```\n\nBut note: the modulus is 10^9+7, which is 1000000007.\n\nHowever, the code already does modulo 1000000007 at the end of the loop? But we are setting the count as the product modulo 1000000007.\n\nBut wait: the state `d[j][i]` is being updated. We are setting `tt` to a new list. Then we assign `d[j][i] = tt`.\n\nSo the completion for the TODO is:\n```python\n                    tt = [l[0] + r[0] + 1, (l[1] * r[1]) % 1000000007]\n```\n\nHowever, note that the variable `tt` is initially set to `d[j][i]` (which might be None). We are creating a new state.\n\nBut the code after the if-block uses `tt` to update `d[j][i]`. So we set `tt` to the new state.\n\nBut note: the product is `l[1] * r[1]` modulo 1000000007.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is as above.\n\n### Summary of Missing Code:\n\n- program1.py: `st[2*cur+1] = st[cur]`\n- program2.py: \n```python\n            x = i\n            break\n```\n- program3.py: `tt = [l[0] + r[0] + 1, (l[1] * r[1]) % 1000000007]`\n\nNow, we output these as a JSON object with the specified keys.\n\nNote: We must output the code exactly as it should appear in the program, without any extra formatting or comments.\n\nLet's write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"st[2*cur+1] = st[cur]\",\n  \"program2\": \"            x = i\\n            break\",\n  \"program3\": \"                    tt = [l[0] + r[0] + 1, (l[1] * r[1]) % 1000000007]\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program2.py, the code after the break is already provided? We are only filling the two lines in the if-block.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program2.py after the loop uses `x` and `z` and then appends to `ans`. We are only responsible for the two lines in the if-block.\n\nSimilarly, in program1.py, we are only replacing the one line.\n\nIn program3.py, we are replacing the one line.\n\nBut note: the code in program3.py has an indentation level of 20 (or 16? 20 spaces). We must preserve the same indentation.\n\nIn the provided code for program3.py, the TODO is at an indentation of 20 spaces. We output the same.\n\nHowever, the JSON string must escape quotes and backslashes? But our strings do not have quotes or backslashes. We can use a raw string.\n\nBut to be safe, we output the exact string.\n\nLet me write the JSON string:\n\nFor program1: \"st[2*cur+1] = st[cur]\"\nFor program2: two lines: \"            x = i\\n            break\"\nFor program3: \"                    tt = [l[0] + r[0] + 1, (l[1] * r[1]) % 1000000007]\"\n\nWe output the JSON without extra spaces? The problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\n\nWe output the JSON object as a string.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the JSON string.\n\nFinal JSON:"
