The operations only affect the array from index 2 to n. The first element `a[0]` never changes. However, the operations can be performed in any order and multiple times. How does it work? Let's denote the array as [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}]. We want to make a1=0, a2=0, ... a_{n-1}=0. We can only change an element by subtracting the element to its left. This operation can be done repeatedly. Note: the operations can be done in any order and multiple times. However, the operation on index i only changes a_i and does not change a_{i-1}. So we can think backwards: to make a_i=0, we must have that at some point a_i becomes a multiple of a_{i-1}? Actually, we can simulate:\n\n   Consider the last operation on index i: we set a_i = a_i - a_{i-1}. But before that, we might have done operations on index i multiple times. Essentially, we are subtracting a_{i-1} multiple times. So the final value of a_i must be 0, meaning that the initial a_i must be a multiple of a_{i-1}? Not exactly: because we can also change a_{i-1} by operations on index i-1? But note: when we do an operation on index i, we use the current value of a_{i-1}. And the value of a_{i-1} might have been changed by previous operations. However, note that the operation on index i-1 changes a_{i-1} to a_{i-1} - a_{i-2}. Then that changes the value that we subtract from a_i. This becomes complex. But note: the operations are linear? Actually, we can represent the entire process as a linear combination? Alternatively, note that the problem constraints are small: n<=100, and t<=100. So we can simulate backwards? But the numbers can be up to 10^9.

      "text": "Actually, the problem says: \"You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times\" but note the array must remain positive? The problem does not explicitly say that the numbers remain positive, but the input says positive integers. However, the operation might produce negative? But the problem says: \"change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\" and then we have the next operation. The problem does not require the numbers to remain positive during the operations? Only the initial values are positive. However, the example [1,2,3] becomes [1,2,1] -> then [1,1,1] -> then [1,1,0] -> then [1,0,0]. The problem says: \"Is it possible to make a_i=0 for all 2<=i<=n\". So zeros are allowed. But negative numbers? The problem does not say they are disallowed. However, if we get a negative, then we cannot make it zero? Because we can only subtract a positive number (the previous element) from a negative? which would make it more negative. Therefore, we must avoid negative numbers. How about [2,4,5]:\n            Operation on i=3: 5-4=1 -> [2,4,1] (positive, so allowed) Then we can do i=2: 4-2=2 -> [2,2,1] \n            Then i=3: 1-2 -> negative? not allowed? Alternatively, we can do: [2,4,5] -> i=2: [2,4-2=2,5] -> [2,2,5]\n            Then i=3: [2,2,5-2=3] -> [2,2,3]\n            Then i=3: [2,2,3-2=1] -> [2,2,1]\n            Then i=3: [2,2,1-2] -> negative? So it seems we cannot make the last element 0 without getting negative? Therefore, the condition might be: For each i from 1 to n-1, the element a_i must be divisible by the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}]? But note: we can change the prefix? Actually, we can change the elements arbitrarily? But the operations are sequential and affect the next elements. Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round 752, problem A) is:\n\n            We can make the array [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] such that for i>=1, a_i becomes 0, if and only if for every i (from 0 to n-2) the gcd of the first i+1 elements divides the (i+1)-th element? But note: the operations can be done in any order? Actually, we can consider the process backwards: The last element a_{n-1} must be reduced to 0. How? We subtract a_{n-2} multiple times. So we require that a_{n-1} is a multiple of the value that a_{n-2} ends up with. But what is the value of a_{n-2}? It must be reduced to 0 as well? Alternatively, we can use the following known solution:\n\n            Let g0 = a0\n            For i from 1 to n-1:\n                g_i = gcd(g_{i-1}, a_i) But then we require that at the end, we can set a_i to 0? Actually, the known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces problem \"Array Elimination\") is:\n\n            It is possible if and only if for every i from 0 to n-2, the element a_{i+1} is divisible by the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i]? But wait: in the example [2,4,5]:\n            i=0: a1=4 must be divisible by gcd(2)=2 -> 4 divisible by 2 -> yes.\n            i=1: a2=5 must be divisible by gcd(2,4)=2 -> 5 divisible by 2? no. So it would be NO. And we saw we couldn't do it. But what about [1,2,3]? \n            i=0: a1=2 divisible by gcd(1)=1 -> yes. i=1: a2=3 divisible by gcd(1,2)=1 -> yes. [5,10]:\n            i=0: a1=10 divisible by gcd(5)=5 -> yes. Therefore, the condition is: For i from 1 to n-1: \n                if a_i is divisible by the gcd of a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}? However, note: we can change the values arbitrarily? The gcd of the prefix might change as we do operations? But note: the operation: \n            We can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} from a_i. This is similar to the Euclidean algorithm. The gcd of the entire prefix remains invariant? Actually, the gcd of the entire array is invariant under the operation? However, we are not doing the Euclidean algorithm on the entire array.",

Actually, we can show that the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i] is invariant? Consider: \n            Operation on index i: \n                changes a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}.

Therefore, the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i] is invariant under any sequence of operations that only change a_i (by subtracting multiples of a_{i-1}). Then the condition for being able to set a_i to 0 is that the gcd of the prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}] divides a_i? Why? Because we can only change a_i by subtracting multiples of a_{i-1}, but the gcd (call it g) of the prefix [a0,...,a_{i-1}] divides every element in the prefix, and in particular divides a_{i-1}. Therefore, we can only change a_i to a value that is congruent to a_i modulo g. To get 0, we require that a_i mod g = 0. Therefore, the condition is: For each i from 1 to n-1: \n                g_i = gcd(a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1])\n                then we require that g_i divides a_i.

However, the code has:\n\n            n = input_arr[0]   # n is the number of test cases\n\n        Then we are reading `n` test cases. But the next part of the input: \n            The first line of a test case is an integer `n_i` (the length of the array), then `n_i` integers. Therefore, the code is:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                a = input_arr[pos:pos+size] pos += size\n                test_cases.append(a) But note: the variable `n` in the for loop is the number of test cases, which is the first integer.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n## program1.py\n\nThe problem: \n- We have `n` items and `q` queries.\n- The prices of the items are given, and we sort them in descending order (so the most expensive first).\n- Then we compute a prefix sum array `prices` (but note: the code sorts in reverse and then does a prefix sum on the reversed sorted array? Actually, the code does:\n\n  prices.sort(reverse=True)\n  for i in range(1, arr[0]):   # arr[0] is n\n      prices[i] = prices[i] + prices[i-1]\n\nThis builds a prefix sum for the sorted array (from largest to smallest). However, note that the problem requires the maximum total value of free items. The free items are the `y` cheapest items when at least `x` items are bought. But note: the customer can choose which items to buy. The optimal strategy is to buy the `x` most expensive items (so that the free ones are the cheapest among these expensive ones). Then the free items would be the `y` smallest among the `x` selected. Since we sorted in descending order, the `x` selected are the first `x` in the array. The `y` cheapest among these would be the last `y` of these `x` (because in the descending array, the last ones are the smallest). \n\nBut note: the prefix sum we built is for the descending array. So the prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of the first `i+1` largest items. \n\nWe want the sum of the `y` cheapest in the set of `x` items. That set of `x` items is the first `x` in the array (which are the largest). The `y` cheapest in that set are the last `y` of the `x` items. \n\nHow to compute that? \n- The entire set of `x` items: indices 0 to x-1 in the `prices` array (which is sorted descending).\n- The `y` cheapest are the last `y` of these, which in the descending array are the ones from index `x-y` to `x-1`? Actually, the entire set of `x` items in descending order: \n   [p0, p1, ..., p_{x-1}]\n   The smallest in this set is the last one: p_{x-1}, then p_{x-2}, ... up to p_{x-y}. \n\nBut note: we have a prefix sum array for the descending array. However, the prefix sum array we built is cumulative from the largest. \n\nWe can compute the sum of the last `y` of the `x` items by:\n   total = (sum of the entire `x` items) - (sum of the first `x-y` items)\n\nBut note: \n   prefix[x-1] = p0 + p1 + ... + p_{x-1}\n   prefix[x-y-1] = p0 + p1 + ... + p_{x-y-1}\n\nThen the sum of the last `y` items (which are the smallest in the set) is:\n   prefix[x-1] - (prefix[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\nHowever, note the code already built the prefix sum for the entire array (for indices 0 to n-1). But what if `x-y` is 0? Then we subtract nothing.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the customer must purchase at least `x` items, and then the `y` cheapest are free. The customer can choose which items to buy. The optimal choice is to take the `x` most expensive items. Then the free items are the `y` cheapest among these, which we can compute as above.\n\nHowever, note the code already has:\n\n   if(xy[0]==xy[1]):\n        ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1])\n\nThis is the case when x=y: then we are taking the entire set of `x` items and getting all for free? Actually, no: the free items are the `y` cheapest, which in this case is the entire set. So the free value is the entire prefix sum of the first `x` items.\n\nBut in the general case, we want the sum of the last `y` in the set of `x` (which are the smallest). So:\n\n   total_free = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\nBut note: our prefix array `prices` is built for the descending sorted array. However, the array is sorted in descending order, so the first `x` are the largest. The last `y` of these `x` are the smallest in the set. And the prefix array is cumulative from the beginning (largest). \n\nBut there is a catch: the prefix array we built is for the entire array? Yes, but note that we built it for indices 0 to n-1. However, if `x` is 1, then we cannot do `x-y-1` because y=1 and then x-y-1 = -1. So we have to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the set of `x` items (the largest `x`) has a total sum = `prices[x-1]`. The largest `x-y` items in the set (which are the first `x-y` in the array) have a sum = `prices[x-y-1]`? Actually, the prefix array at index `i` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements. So:\n\n   sum of the first `x-y` elements (which are the largest `x-y` items) = `prices[x-y-1]`? \n   Actually, if we let `x-y = k`, then the sum of the first `k` items is `prices[k-1]`.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the free items (the last `y` in the set of `x`) is:\n   total_free = (sum of the entire `x` items) - (sum of the first `x-y` items)\n              = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\nBut if `x-y` is 0, then we subtract nothing? Actually, if `x-y==0`, then we are taking the entire set of `x` as free? But note: the free items are `y` items, and `y=x` in that case. So we want the entire set. Then we subtract the first 0 items? That would be 0. So then total_free = prices[x-1] - 0 = prices[x-1]. That matches.\n\nBut what if `x-y` is 1? Then we subtract the first 1 item? That is the largest one. Then the free items are the remaining `x-1` items? Actually, no: the free items are the `y` cheapest, which in the set of `x` are the last `y` (which are the smallest). If `x-y=1`, then we are removing the largest one, and the free items are the remaining `y` (which is `x-1`). But note: the set of `x` items: [A0, A1, ..., A_{x-1}] (sorted descending). The free items are the last `y` = `x-1` items? Actually, `y = x - (x-y) = x - 1`? Then `y = x-1`. So we are removing the first one (the largest) and the free items are the next `x-1`? But note: the problem says the `y` cheapest. The `y` cheapest in the set are the last `y` in the set, which are the smallest. So yes.\n\nHowever, note: the prefix array we built is for the entire array (the descending sorted array). But what if `x` is greater than the length of the prefix array? Actually, we built the prefix array for the entire `n` items. And the problem states that `x` is at most `n` (since `x<=n`). So we are safe as long as we don't go beyond the array.\n\nBut note: the prefix array was built only for indices 0 to n-1. And we have:\n\n   if `x-y-1` is negative, we use 0.\n\nBut note: `x>=y` so `x-y>=0`. Then `x-y-1` can be -1 only when `x-y=0`. So we can write:\n\n   if x-y == 0:\n        free_sum = prices[x-1]\n   else:\n        free_sum = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\nBut wait: what if `x-y` is 0? Then we subtract nothing? Actually, we can write:\n\n   free_sum = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\nBut note: when `x-y==0`, then `x-y-1 = -1`, so we use 0. That works.\n\nHowever, what if `x-y-1` is beyond the array? Actually, we built the prefix array for the entire `n` items, but if `x-y-1` is beyond the last index? Actually, `x` is at most `n`, and `x-y-1` is at most `n-1`? Actually, `x-y-1` is at least -1 and at most `n-1` (if `x=n` and `y=1`, then `x-y-1 = n-2` which is within [0, n-2] if n>=2). But note: we built the prefix array for indices 0 to n-1. However, if `x-y-1` is exactly `n-1`? That would be when `x-y = n`? But `x<=n` and `y>=1`, so `x-y <= n-1`. So `x-y-1` is at most `n-2`. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the prefix array was built only for the first `n` items. And we are indexing from 0 to n-1. So if `x-y-1` is in the range [0, n-1] we can use it. Otherwise, if negative, we use 0.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py in the else block is:\n\n   else:\n        # We have to compute the free value for query (x,y)\n        # Let x_val = xy[0], y_val = xy[1]\n        x_val = xy[0]\n        y_val = xy[1]\n        # The total sum of the first x_val items (largest x_val) is prices[x_val-1]\n        # The sum of the first (x_val - y_val) items is:\n        #   if (x_val - y_val - 1) >= 0: prices[x_val - y_val - 1]\n        #   else: 0\n        if x_val - y_val - 1 >= 0:\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1] - prices[x_val - y_val - 1]\n        else:\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1]   # because subtracting 0\n        ans.append(total_free)\n\nBut note: the problem says that the array `prices` was built for the entire array. However, what if `x_val` is 1? Then `x_val-1=0` is valid. And `x_val-y_val-1` = 1 - y_val - 1 = -y_val, which is negative. So we use 0. Then total_free = prices[0] - 0 = prices[0]. That is correct: if we buy 1 item and get the 1 cheapest (which is the only one) for free? But note: the condition is \"at least x items\", and then the y cheapest are free. So if x=1 and y=1, we buy 1 item and get the 1 cheapest (which is that one) for free. So the free value is the price of that item. And we have the largest item? Actually, we sorted in descending order. The largest item is the first. But wait: we are allowed to choose any item? The customer will choose the most expensive one to maximize the free value? Actually, no: the customer wants to maximize the free value. So he will choose the most expensive item. Then the free value is that item. So yes.\n\nBut note: the array `prices` is sorted in descending order. So the first element is the largest. Therefore, the above computation is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the prefix array we built is for the entire array. But what if `x_val` is greater than the number of items? Actually, the problem states that `x` is at most `n` (from the input: `1<=y<=x<=n`). So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   else:\n        x_val = xy[0]\n        y_val = xy[1]\n        if x_val - y_val - 1 >= 0:\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1] - prices[x_val - y_val - 1]\n        else:\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1]\n        ans.append(total_free)\n\nBut note: the code already has a loop that runs for `arr[1]` (which is `q`) queries. And we are appending to `ans`.\n\n## program2.py\n\nThe problem: \n- We are counting trees on `n` vertices (n is odd) with a specific attachment rule: for each vertex i (from 2 to n), it is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index. This is a rooted tree? Actually, it is a tree with edges only from a vertex to a lower-indexed vertex? This is a \"recursive tree\": the tree is built by attaching vertices in increasing order. There are (n-1)! such trees? Actually, the number of such trees is (n-1)! because at step i (from 2 to n) we choose one of the previous i-1 vertices to attach to.\n\nBut the problem: for each vertex i (from 1 to n), count the number of trees (among all (n-1)! trees) for which vertex i is the centroid. The centroid is defined as a vertex whose removal leaves no subtree with more than (n-1)/2 vertices.\n\nWe are given an odd integer n (>=3 and <200000).\n\nThe code already sets up:\n   MOD = 998244353\n   We have a function `modmul` for modular multiplication.\n   We are building factorials and inverse factorials up to MAX=10**6.\n\nThe missing part: \n   def inv(x):\n        # modular inverse modulo MOD\n\nWe can use Fermat's little theorem: since MOD is prime, \n   inv(x) = pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the code already has a function `modmul` and we are building factorials. Then we have:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   out = [0] * n\n\n   for i in range((n+1)//2):\n        base = fact[n-1]\n        frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))\n        out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n   Then there is a loop that does:\n\n        rem = 0\n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            oldrem = rem\n            rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))   # what is invs? It's defined as: modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n            out[i] -= oldrem\n            rem %= MOD\n            out[i] %= MOD\n\n   Then we print the out array.\n\nWhat is `invs`? It's defined as:\n   def invs(x):\n        return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\nBut note: fact[x] = x! mod MOD, and invfact[x] = 1/(x!) mod MOD.\nSo invs(x) = ( (x-1)! ) * (1/(x!)) = 1/x mod MOD.\n\nSo invs(i) is the modular inverse of i.\n\nBut the problem: the code for the inverse function is missing. We must write:\n\n   def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the code already uses a precomputation for factorials and inverse factorials. However, the function `inv` is used in the precomputation? Actually, we see:\n\n   invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n\nSo we need the `inv` function to compute the inverse of a number modulo MOD.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n   def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: we must be cautious for x=0? But in the context, we are computing factorials and inverse factorials for indices from 1 to MAX-1. The inverse of 0 is not needed. So we are safe.\n\nHowever, the problem says that the answer for the i-th vertex is stored in out[i-1]? Actually, the array `out` is of length n, and we are iterating i from 0 to (n+1)//2 - 1. Then we do a backward loop.\n\nBut the rest of the code is given. We only need to complete the `inv` function.\n\n## program3.py\n\nThe problem: \n- We have an array `a` of `n` positive integers.\n- We can perform the operation: choose an index `i` (from 2 to n) and set `a[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]` any number of times.\n- We want to know if we can make `a[i]=0` for all `i` from 2 to n.\n\nThe code has a function `diff_ops(arr)` that currently does:\n\n   result = True\n   for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        result = result and (arr[i] % arr[0] == 0)\n   return result\n\nBut note: the problem says we can do the operations any number of times. The operations only affect the array from index 2 to n. The first element `a[0]` never changes.\n\nHowever, the operations can be performed in any order and multiple times. How does it work?\n\nLet's denote the array as [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}].\n\nWe want to make a1=0, a2=0, ... a_{n-1}=0.\n\nWe can only change an element by subtracting the element to its left. This operation can be done repeatedly. \n\nNote: the operations can be done in any order and multiple times. However, the operation on index i only changes a_i and does not change a_{i-1}. So we can think backwards: to make a_i=0, we must have that at some point a_i becomes a multiple of a_{i-1}? Actually, we can simulate:\n\n   Consider the last operation on index i: we set a_i = a_i - a_{i-1}. But before that, we might have done operations on index i multiple times. Essentially, we are subtracting a_{i-1} multiple times. So the final value of a_i must be 0, meaning that the initial a_i must be a multiple of a_{i-1}? Not exactly: because we can also change a_{i-1} by operations on index i-1? But note: when we do an operation on index i, we use the current value of a_{i-1}. And the value of a_{i-1} might have been changed by previous operations.\n\nHowever, note that the operation on index i-1 changes a_{i-1} to a_{i-1} - a_{i-2}. Then that changes the value that we subtract from a_i.\n\nThis becomes complex. But note: the operations are linear? Actually, we can represent the entire process as a linear combination? \n\nAlternatively, note that the problem constraints are small: n<=100, and t<=100. So we can simulate backwards? But the numbers can be up to 10^9.\n\nThere is a known solution: \n   We can only make the entire array (from index1 to the end) zero if for every i (from 1 to n-1) the element a_i is divisible by the greatest common divisor of the entire prefix up to i? \n\nActually, known similar problems: \n   We can use dynamic programming? Or note that the operations are reversible? \n\nBut note: the problem says we can do the operations in any order. However, we are allowed to do as many as we want. \n\nInsight: \n   The operation on index i: subtract a_{i-1} from a_i. This is similar to the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nBut we are not required to compute the steps, only to decide if it is possible.\n\nKnown solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n   We can make the array [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] such that for i>=1, a_i becomes 0, if and only if for each i>=1, the value a_i is divisible by the greatest common divisor of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}]? \n\nBut note: we can change the values arbitrarily? Actually, we can only subtract multiples of the previous element. \n\nHowever, we can also change the previous element? So the condition is more complex.\n\nActually, we can consider the entire process as: \n   We want to make a1=0. How? We can subtract a0 from a1 multiple times. So we require that a1 is divisible by a0? Then we can set a1 = a1 mod a0? But if we set a1 to 0, then we are done for a1.\n\n   Then for a2: we can subtract a1 (which is now 0) from a2? But subtracting 0 doesn't change a2. So we must have a2=0 initially? But that is not the case in the example: [1,2,3] becomes [1,1,3] then [1,1,2] then [1,1,1] then [1,0,1] then [1,0,0]? Actually, the example does:\n\n        [1,2,3] -> choose i=3: [1,2,1] -> choose i=2: [1,1,1] -> choose i=3: [1,1,0] -> choose i=2: [1,0,0]\n\n   But note: after the first operation on i=3, we get [1,2,1]. Then we can do an operation on i=2: [1, 2-1=1, 1] -> [1,1,1]. Then we can do i=3: [1,1,1-1=0] -> [1,1,0]. Then i=2: [1,1-1=0,0] -> [1,0,0].\n\n   How does this relate to divisibility?\n\n   Alternate known solution: \n        It is possible if and only if for every i from 0 to n-1, the element a_i is divisible by the gcd of the entire array? \n\n   But that is not the case: in the example [5,10] -> gcd(5,10)=5, and 10 is divisible by 5 -> YES.\n\n   [1,2,3]: gcd(1,2,3)=1, and 2 and 3 are divisible by 1 -> YES.\n\n   But what about [2,4,5]? \n        gcd(2,4,5)=1 -> then 5 is divisible by 1 -> YES? \n        But let's try: \n            Start: [2,4,5]\n            Operation on i=3: [2,4,5-4=1] -> [2,4,1]\n            Then we can do i=3 again: [2,4,1-4] -> negative? not allowed? the problem says positive integers? but the operation: we set a_i = a_i - a_{i-1}. So we get 1-4 = -3? which is negative? and the problem says the array consists of positive integers? So we cannot do that? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times\" but note the array must remain positive? The problem does not explicitly say that the numbers remain positive, but the input says positive integers. However, the operation might produce negative? \n\n        But the problem says: \"change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\" and then we have the next operation. The problem does not require the numbers to remain positive during the operations? Only the initial values are positive.\n\n        However, the example [1,2,3] becomes [1,2,1] -> then [1,1,1] -> then [1,1,0] -> then [1,0,0]. The problem says: \"Is it possible to make a_i=0 for all 2<=i<=n\". So zeros are allowed.\n\n        But negative numbers? The problem does not say they are disallowed. However, if we get a negative, then we cannot make it zero? Because we can only subtract a positive number (the previous element) from a negative? which would make it more negative.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid negative numbers.\n\n        How about [2,4,5]:\n            Operation on i=3: 5-4=1 -> [2,4,1] (positive, so allowed)\n            Then we can do i=2: 4-2=2 -> [2,2,1] \n            Then i=3: 1-2 -> negative? not allowed? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n            [2,4,5] -> i=2: [2,4-2=2,5] -> [2,2,5]\n            Then i=3: [2,2,5-2=3] -> [2,2,3]\n            Then i=3: [2,2,3-2=1] -> [2,2,1]\n            Then i=3: [2,2,1-2] -> negative? \n\n        So it seems we cannot make the last element 0 without getting negative? \n\n        Therefore, the condition might be: \n            For each i from 1 to n-1, the element a_i must be divisible by the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}]? \n\n        But note: we can change the prefix? \n\n        Actually, we can change the elements arbitrarily? But the operations are sequential and affect the next elements.\n\n        Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round 752, problem A) is:\n\n            We can make the array [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] such that for i>=1, a_i becomes 0, if and only if for every i (from 0 to n-2) the gcd of the first i+1 elements divides the (i+1)-th element? \n\n        But note: the operations can be done in any order? \n\n        Actually, we can consider the process backwards: \n            The last element a_{n-1} must be reduced to 0. How? We subtract a_{n-2} multiple times. So we require that a_{n-1} is a multiple of the value that a_{n-2} ends up with. But what is the value of a_{n-2}? It must be reduced to 0 as well? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following known solution:\n\n            Let g0 = a0\n            For i from 1 to n-1:\n                g_i = gcd(g_{i-1}, a_i)\n                But then we require that at the end, we can set a_i to 0? \n\n        Actually, the known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces problem \"Array Elimination\") is:\n\n            It is possible if and only if for every i from 0 to n-2, the element a_{i+1} is divisible by the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i]? \n\n        But wait: in the example [2,4,5]:\n            i=0: a1=4 must be divisible by gcd(2)=2 -> 4 divisible by 2 -> yes.\n            i=1: a2=5 must be divisible by gcd(2,4)=2 -> 5 divisible by 2? no.\n\n            So it would be NO.\n\n        And we saw we couldn't do it.\n\n        But what about [1,2,3]? \n            i=0: a1=2 divisible by gcd(1)=1 -> yes.\n            i=1: a2=3 divisible by gcd(1,2)=1 -> yes.\n\n        [5,10]:\n            i=0: a1=10 divisible by gcd(5)=5 -> yes.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n            For i from 1 to n-1: \n                if a_i is divisible by the gcd of a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}? \n\n        However, note: we can change the values arbitrarily? The gcd of the prefix might change as we do operations? \n\n        But note: the operation: \n            We can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} from a_i. This is similar to the Euclidean algorithm. The gcd of the entire prefix remains invariant? \n\n        Actually, the gcd of the entire array is invariant under the operation? \n\n        However, we are not doing the Euclidean algorithm on the entire array. We are doing operations in arbitrary order? \n\n        But note: the operations only affect an element and the element to its left? \n\n        Actually, we can show that the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i] is invariant? \n\n        Consider: \n            Operation on index i: \n                changes a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. \n                Then the new prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}, a_i - a_{i-1}] has gcd: \n                    gcd(..., a_{i-1}, a_i - a_{i-1}) \n                and note that: \n                    gcd(..., a_{i-1}, a_i) = gcd(..., a_{i-1}, a_i - a_{i-1}) \n                because gcd(a,b) = gcd(a, b-a).\n\n        Therefore, the gcd of the entire prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i] is invariant under any sequence of operations that only change a_i (by subtracting multiples of a_{i-1}). \n\n        Then the condition for being able to set a_i to 0 is that the gcd of the prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}] divides a_i? \n\n        Why? \n            Because we can only change a_i by subtracting multiples of a_{i-1}, but the gcd (call it g) of the prefix [a0,...,a_{i-1}] divides every element in the prefix, and in particular divides a_{i-1}. Therefore, we can only change a_i to a value that is congruent to a_i modulo g. To get 0, we require that a_i mod g = 0.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n            For each i from 1 to n-1: \n                g_i = gcd(a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1])\n                then we require that g_i divides a_i.\n\n        However, note: the gcd of the entire prefix [a0,...,a_{i-1}] is the same as the gcd of the entire segment? \n\n        Therefore, the function `diff_ops` should be:\n\n            g = arr[0]\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                # Check if arr[i] is divisible by the current gcd?\n                if g != 0 and arr[i] % g != 0:\n                    return False\n                # update g = gcd(g, arr[i])\n                g = gcd(g, arr[i])\n            return True\n\n        But wait: what if g becomes 0? Then we break? Actually, if g becomes 0, then we cannot update further? But note: if g becomes 0, then we are in a state where the prefix gcd is 0. Then we require that the next element is 0? But the elements are positive? So g becomes 0 only if we have a 0 in the prefix? \n\n        However, the initial elements are positive. And the gcd of positive numbers is positive until we get to 0? Actually, the gcd of positive numbers is at least 1. But note: we are updating the gcd as we go. \n\n        But the condition: we require that the current gcd (which is at least 1) divides the next element. \n\n        However, what if we have [6, 10, 15]? \n            Step1: g = 6, then check 10 % 6 !=0 -> fails? \n            But we can do operations? \n                [6,10,15] -> \n                    We can do on index2: [6,10,15-10=5] -> [6,10,5]\n                    Then on index2: [6,10,5-10] -> negative? not allowed? \n                Alternatively, \n                    [6,10,15] -> index3: [6,10,5] -> then index2: [6,10-6=4,5] -> [6,4,5] \n                    Then index3: [6,4,5-4=1] -> [6,4,1]\n                    Then index2: [6,4-6] -> negative? \n\n            Actually, we cannot make the second element 0? \n\n            Condition: \n                i=1: 10 % 6 !=0 -> fails -> NO.\n\n        But what if we do the operations in a different order? \n\n        Actually, the condition is necessary: because the gcd of the first element is 6, and 10 mod 6 !=0, so we cannot make the second element 0? \n\n        How to make the second element 0? \n            We must subtract 6 from 10 multiple times: \n                10 - 6 = 4 -> then we have [6,4,15]\n                4 - 6 -> negative? not allowed? \n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, the function `diff_ops` should be:\n\n            def diff_ops(arr):\n                g = arr[0]\n                for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                    # If the current gcd is 0, then we break? but the numbers are positive so g>=1 always?\n                    if g == 0:\n                        # Actually, if g becomes 0, then we break? but we are starting with positive.\n                        # But if we have a 0 in the prefix, then we might get 0? \n                        # However, the problem says positive integers. So we can ignore?\n                        # But what if we have [0, ...]? the input says positive integers, so we don't have 0 initially.\n                        # So we can skip?\n                        return False\n                    if arr[i] % g != 0:\n                        return False\n                    g = gcd(g, arr[i])\n                return True\n\n        But wait: we must update the gcd? \n\n        Actually, the gcd of the entire prefix [0..i] is gcd(g, arr[i]). But note: we are not setting the element to 0 until the very end. The condition for the next element might depend on the updated gcd? \n\n        However, the gcd of the prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i] is invariant? So we can compute it as we go.\n\n        But note: the condition for the next element (a_{i+1}) is that it must be divisible by the gcd of the entire prefix [a0,...,a_i]. So we must update the gcd to include a_i? \n\n        However, in the operation, we are allowed to change a_i arbitrarily (as long as we subtract multiples of a_{i-1}), but the gcd of the prefix remains the same? \n\n        Actually, the gcd of the prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_i] is the same as the gcd of the prefix [a0, a1, ..., a_{i-1}, a_i - k * a_{i-1}] for any integer k? \n\n        Therefore, we can update the gcd as:\n\n            g = gcd(g, arr[i])\n\n        But note: the condition for the current element a_i is that it must be divisible by the gcd of the prefix [a0,...,a_{i-1}] (which is the old g). Then we update g to the gcd of the entire prefix including the current element.\n\n        Therefore, the function becomes:\n\n            g = arr[0]\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                # Check if the current element is divisible by the current gcd (which is the gcd of the prefix ending at i-1)\n                if arr[i] % g != 0:\n                    return False\n                # Then update the gcd to include the current element? \n                # But note: we are going to change the current element? \n                # Actually, we are not changing it in the array? We are just checking the condition. \n                # The gcd for the next element (if any) should be the gcd of the entire prefix including the original value of a_i? \n                # But the gcd is invariant under the operations? So we can update it to gcd(g, arr[i])? \n                g = gcd(g, arr[i])\n                # However, what if we change the current element? The gcd for the next element is the gcd of the entire prefix including the current element? But we are going to set the current element to 0? \n                # Actually, we are not setting it to 0 until the very end? The operations are done arbitrarily and then we check at the end. \n                # But the condition for the next element is that the gcd of the entire prefix (which now includes the current element) must divide the next element? \n                # However, we are going to set the current element to 0? Then the gcd of the prefix including the current element (which is now 0) is gcd(g,0)=g? \n                # But note: we are not updating the array? We are just checking the condition. \n\n                # Actually, the condition for the next element is that the gcd of the entire prefix (which is the gcd of the original values) must divide the next element? \n\n                # Therefore, we update the gcd to be the gcd of the entire prefix so far (including the current element) for the next iteration.\n\n            return True\n\n        But note: the gcd update: \n            g0 = a0\n            g1 = gcd(a0, a1)   -> for the next element a2, we require that a2 is divisible by g1? \n\n        Example [1,2,3]:\n            i=1: \n                g = 1\n                check: 2 % 1 == 0 -> True\n                then update g = gcd(1,2)=1\n            i=2:\n                check: 3 % 1 == 0 -> True\n                then update g = gcd(1,3)=1\n\n        Example [6,10,15]:\n            i=1: \n                g=6, 10 % 6 !=0 -> False -> NO.\n\n        But what about [2, 4, 6]? \n            i=1: \n                g=2, 4%2==0 -> then update g = gcd(2,4)=2\n            i=2:\n                g=2, 6%2==0 -> then update g = gcd(2,6)=2 -> YES.\n\n        But can we do [2,4,6]? \n            We want to make [2,0,0]\n            Step1: set a2 = 6 - 4 = 2 -> [2,4,2]\n            Step2: set a2 = 2-4 = -2 -> negative? not allowed? \n\n        Alternatively:\n            [2,4,6] -> \n                set a1 = 4-2=2 -> [2,2,6]\n                set a2 = 6-2=4 -> [2,2,4]\n                set a2 = 4-2=2 -> [2,2,2]\n                set a2 = 2-2=0 -> [2,2,0]\n                set a1 = 2-2=0 -> [2,0,0]\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n        Why did the condition hold? \n            The condition: \n                a1=4: divisible by 2 -> yes.\n                a2=6: divisible by gcd(2,4)=2 -> yes.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n        But note: the gcd update must be done. \n\n        However, what if the gcd becomes 1? Then every next element must be divisible by 1 -> which is always true. \n\n        Therefore, we need a gcd function? \n\n        We can define:\n\n            def gcd(a, b):\n                while b:\n                    a, b = b, a % b\n                return a\n\n        But the problem says: the array elements can be up to 10^9, and n<=100, so we can do 100 gcd computations.\n\n        However, the code currently does not have a gcd function. We must define it? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is in the TODO block. \n\n        The TODO block is in the main:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        And then we have:\n\n            test_cases = []\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # We are reading t test cases.\n                # For each test case, we read n and then n integers.\n\n            Then we call diff_ops for each test case.\n\n        The TODO block is to read the test cases.\n\n        How to read? \n            The input_arr is the entire input split into integers.\n\n            The first integer is t = number of test cases.\n\n            Then for each test case:\n                first integer: n\n                next n integers: the array a\n\n            So:\n\n                t = input_arr[0]\n                pos = 1\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                    a = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n                    pos += n_i\n                    test_cases.append(a)\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n            for _ in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases, which is stored in the variable `n` at the top? \n                # But note: the variable `n` is already used for the number of test cases? \n                # Actually, the code has: \n                #   n = input_arr[0]   -> but wait, the first integer is the number of test cases? \n                #   Then we have: \n                #       test_cases = []\n                #       pos = 1\n                #       while ... \n\n            But the code already has:\n\n                input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n                len_input = len(input_arr)\n                n = input_arr[0]   # This n is the number of test cases? \n\n            Then we are going to read n test cases? \n\n            Actually, the variable `n` at the top is the number of test cases. But the problem says the first line is t (the number of test cases). Then the code sets n = input_arr[0]. \n\n            Then we can do:\n\n                t = n   # but that is confusing.\n\n            Alternatively, we can change the variable name? But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n            The missing code is the while loop. We can do:\n\n                for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n                    size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                    a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                    pos += size\n                    test_cases.append(a)\n\n            But note: the variable `n` is the first integer (the number of test cases). \n\n            However, the code already has:\n\n                n = input_arr[0]\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                for i in range(n):\n                    size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                    a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                    pos += size\n                    test_cases.append(a)\n\n            Then the while loop condition is not needed? We are using a for loop.\n\n            But the code has a while loop: \n\n                while pos <= len_input - 1:\n\n            We can replace the while loop with a for loop for the number of test cases.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n                for i in range(n):\n                    size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                    a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                    pos += size\n                    test_cases.append(a)\n\n        But wait: the variable `n` is the number of test cases. And the input has exactly that many test cases. \n\n        However, the problem says: the first line is t (the number of test cases). Then the code sets n = t.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(a)\n\n        But note: the variable `n` is the number of test cases. \n\n        However, the function `diff_ops` is defined to take an array and then check the condition. But we have not updated `diff_ops` to use the gcd? \n\n        The problem says: the missing code is only in the TODO block. The TODO block is in the main. \n\n        But the function `diff_ops` is already defined and we are not allowed to change it? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python\" for program3.py, and the TODO block is the only missing part? \n\n        However, the function `diff_ops` as given is:\n\n            def diff_ops(arr):\n                result = True\n                for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                    result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n                return result\n\n        This is incorrect for the general case. \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is only in the TODO block? \n\n        But the TODO block is in the main. The function `diff_ops` is already defined and we are not allowed to change it? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"with missing lines or blocks\". The function `diff_ops` is not missing? It is defined. \n\n        But the function `diff_ops` is incomplete? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python\". We are allowed to change the function `diff_ops`? \n\n        But the TODO block is explicitly marked. The problem says: \"the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        However, the problem also says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". \n\n        We must output only the missing code for each program. For program3.py, the missing code is only the TODO block? \n\n        But the function `diff_ops` is given and is not marked as TODO. \n\n        Therefore, we must not change it? \n\n        But then the program will not work. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the function `diff_ops` is correct? \n\n        But the example [1,2,3] would be checked as:\n            arr[0]=1\n            i=1: 2 % 1 == 0 -> True\n            i=2: 3 % 1 == 0 -> True -> returns True -> YES.\n\n        [5,10]: \n            10 % 5 ==0 -> True -> YES.\n\n        [2,4,5]:\n            i=1: 4 % 2 ==0 -> True\n            i=2: 5 % 2 !=0 -> False -> NO.\n\n        This matches the known examples. \n\n        But what about [3, 6, 5]? \n            i=1: 6 % 3 ==0 -> True\n            i=2: 5 % 3 !=0 -> False -> NO.\n\n        But can we do [3,6,5]? \n            Operation on i=2: [3,6,5-6] -> negative? not allowed? \n            Operation on i=3 first: [3,6,5] -> then we can do i=2: [3,6-3=3,5] -> [3,3,5]\n            Then i=3: [3,3,5-3=2] -> [3,3,2]\n            Then i=3: [3,3,2-3] -> negative? \n            Alternatively, after [3,3,5]: \n                i=3: [3,3,5-3=2] -> [3,3,2]\n                i=3: [3,3,2-3] -> negative? \n            So it is not possible.\n\n        Therefore, the function `diff_ops` as given is actually correct? \n\n        Why? \n            The condition: every element must be divisible by the first element? \n\n        But wait: the example [1,2,3] worked, but 2 and 3 are divisible by 1. \n\n        However, what about [4,6,8]? \n            The function: \n                i=1: 6 % 4 = 2 -> not 0 -> NO.\n            But can we do it?\n                [4,6,8] -> \n                    i=2: [4,6,8-6=2] -> [4,6,2]\n                    i=2: [4,6,2-6] -> negative? \n                Alternatively:\n                    [4,6,8] -> i=2: [4,6-4=2,8] -> [4,2,8]\n                    then i=2: [4,2,8-2=6] -> [4,2,6]\n                    then i=3: [4,2,6-2=4] -> [4,2,4]\n                    then i=3: [4,2,4-2=2] -> [4,2,2]\n                    then i=3: [4,2,2-2=0] -> [4,2,0]\n                    then i=2: [4,2-4] -> negative? \n\n                Or after [4,2,0]:\n                    then i=2: [4,2-4] -> negative? \n\n            But note: we can do i=2 first in the state [4,2,0]: \n                [4,2,0] -> we can do i=2: 2-4 = -2 -> negative? \n\n            Alternatively, after [4,2,0] we can do i=3? but i=3 is already 0, so we don't need to change. Then we only need to make the second element 0: \n                [4,2,0] -> then we can do i=2: 2-4 = -2 -> negative? \n\n            So it is not possible.\n\n            But wait: there is a solution? \n                [4,6,8] -> \n                    i=3: 8-6=2 -> [4,6,2]\n                    i=2: 6-4=2 -> [4,2,2]\n                    i=3: 2-2=0 -> [4,2,0]\n                    i=2: 2-4 -> negative? \n\n            We are stuck.\n\n            However, note: we can do operations in any order and any number of times. But we cannot make the second element 0 without getting negative? \n\n            Therefore, the condition that every element is divisible by the first element is sufficient? \n\n            But [4,6,8]: 6 and 8 are not divisible by 4? -> NO.\n\n        But what about [4, 8, 12]? \n            i=1: 8%4==0 -> True\n            i=2: 12%4==0 -> True -> YES.\n\n        And we can do:\n            [4,8,12] -> \n                i=2: [4,8-4=4,12] -> [4,4,12]\n                i=3: [4,4,12-4=8] -> [4,4,8]\n                i=3: [4,4,8-4=4] -> [4,4,4]\n                i=3: [4,4,4-4=0] -> [4,4,0]\n                i=2: [4,4-4=0,0] -> [4,0,0]\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the function `diff_ops` as given is correct? \n\n        But why? \n\n        Insight: \n            The first element never changes. \n            To make the second element 0, we must subtract the first element multiple times. So the second element must be a multiple of the first element. \n            Then, after making the second element 0, to make the third element 0, we must subtract the second element (which is 0) multiple times? But subtracting 0 does nothing. So the third element must be 0 initially? \n\n        But wait: we can change the third element before the second element becomes 0? \n\n        For example, [4,6,8]: \n            We can first change the third element: 8-6=2 -> [4,6,2]\n            Then change the second element: 6-4=2 -> [4,2,2]\n            Then change the third element: 2-2=0 -> [4,2,0]\n            Then change the second element: 2-4 = -2 -> negative.\n\n        Alternatively, after [4,2,0], we cannot make the second element 0 without negative.\n\n        But what if we do more operations on the third element before making the second element 0? \n            [4,6,8] -> \n                i=3: 8-6=2 -> [4,6,2]\n                i=3: 2-6 -> negative? \n\n        Or:\n            [4,6,8] -> \n                i=2: 6-4=2 -> [4,2,8]\n                i=3: 8-2=6 -> [4,2,6]\n                i=3: 6-2=4 -> [4,2,4]\n                i=3: 4-2=2 -> [4,2,2]\n                i=3: 2-2=0 -> [4,2,0]\n                then i=2: 2-4 -> negative.\n\n        So it is not possible.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: every element must be divisible by the first element. \n\n        But wait: the example [1,2,3] works because 2 and 3 are divisible by 1. \n        [2,4,5] fails because 5 is not divisible by 2? \n        [2,4,6] works because 4 and 6 are divisible by 2.\n\n        However, consider [3, 3, 6]:\n            Condition: \n                a1=3: 3%3==0 -> True\n                a2=6: 6%3==0 -> True -> YES.\n            How to do it?\n                [3,3,6] -> \n                    i=2: [3,3,6-3=3] -> [3,3,3]\n                    i=3: [3,3,3-3=0] -> [3,3,0]\n                    i=2: [3,3-3=0,0] -> [3,0,0]\n\n            So it works.\n\n        But what about [3, 3, 3]? \n            YES.\n\n        And [3, 6, 3]? \n            Condition: \n                a1=6: 6%3==0 -> True\n                a2=3: 3%3==0 -> True -> YES.\n            How to do it?\n                [3,6,3] -> \n                    i=2: [3,6-3=3,3] -> [3,3,3] -> then as above.\n\n        Therefore, the function `diff_ops` as given is correct.\n\n        But why did the known solution with gcd work for [2,4,5]? \n            Because the gcd condition is more general? \n\n        Let me test [6,10,15] with the gcd method and with the current method:\n\n            Current method: \n                a1=10: 10 % 6 !=0 -> NO.\n\n            gcd method: \n                g0=6\n                i=1: 10 % 6 !=0 -> NO.\n\n            [6,10,15] fails both.\n\n        But what about [12, 6, 3]? \n            Current method: \n                a1=6: 6 % 12 !=0 -> 6 % 12 = 6 -> not 0 -> NO.\n            gcd method: \n                g0=12\n                i=1: 6 % 12 !=0 -> NO.\n\n            But can we do it?\n                [12,6,3] -> \n                    i=2: [12,6,3-6] -> negative? \n                i=2 first: [12,6-12] -> negative? \n\n            So it is not possible.\n\n        However, consider [12, 6, 3] in a different order? \n            We cannot because the first element is fixed.\n\n        But what if we have [6, 12, 3]? \n            Current method: \n                a1=12: 12 % 6 ==0 -> True\n                a2=3: 3 % 6 !=0 -> False -> NO.\n\n            gcd method: \n                g0=6\n                i=1: 12 % 6==0 -> update g = gcd(6,12)=6\n                i=2: 3 % 6 !=0 -> NO.\n\n        But can we do [6,12,3]? \n            [6,12,3] -> \n                i=2: [6,12,3-12] -> negative? \n                i=2: [6,12-6=6,3] -> [6,6,3]\n                i=3: [6,6,3-6] -> negative? \n                i=3: [6,6,3] -> then we can do i=3: 3-6 -> negative? \n\n            So it is not possible.\n\n        Therefore, the function `diff_ops` as given is sufficient.\n\n        But wait: the example [0,0,0]? \n            The problem says positive integers, so we don't have to consider.\n\n        Conclusion: the function `diff_ops` is already correct. \n\n        Therefore, the only missing code in program3.py is the TODO block in the main.\n\n        So we output for program3.py:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(a)\n\n        But note: the variable `n` is the number of test cases.\n\n        However, the code has:\n\n            n = input_arr[0]   # n is the number of test cases\n\n        Then we are reading `n` test cases.\n\n        But the next part of the input: \n            The first line of a test case is an integer `n_i` (the length of the array), then `n_i` integers.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(a)\n\n        But note: the variable `n` in the for loop is the number of test cases, which is the first integer.\n\n        However, the problem says the first integer is t. The code sets n = t.\n\n        So it is correct.\n\n        But the variable name `n` is used for two purposes? \n            In the main: n = number of test cases.\n            In the test case: the first integer is the length of the array, which is also called n in the problem.\n\n        But in the code, we call it `size`.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is as above.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the variable `n` in the for loop is the number of test cases, and we are using it to loop.\n\n        But the code has:\n\n            n = input_arr[0]   # the first integer is the number of test cases\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(a)\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says the array has at least 2 elements. So size>=2.\n\n        We are done.\n\nSummary of missing code:\n\nprogram1.py:\n    else:\n        x_val = xy[0]\n        y_val = xy[1]\n        if x_val - y_val - 1 >= 0:\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1] - prices[x_val - y_val - 1]\n        else:\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1]\n        ans.append(total_free)\n\nprogram2.py:\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nprogram3.py:\n    for i in range(n):\n        size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n        a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n        pos += size\n        test_cases.append(a)\n\nNow, we output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    else:\\n        x_val = xy[0]\\n        y_val = xy[1]\\n        if x_val - y_val - 1 >= 0:\\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1] - prices[x_val - y_val - 1]\\n        else:\\n            total_free = prices[x_val-1]\\n        ans.append(total_free)\",\n  \"program2\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\",\n  \"program3\": \"    for i in range(n):\\n        size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\\n        a = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n        pos += size\\n        test_cases.append(a)\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the code already has the variable `xy` which is the list of two integers for the query.\n\nIn program2.py, the function `inv` must be defined. We return the expression.\n\nIn program3.py, we replace the while loop with the for loop.\n\nHowever, the program3.py code has:\n\n    while pos <= len_input - 1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the while loop with the for loop? But the while loop condition is still there? \n\nActually, we remove the while loop and put the for loop. But the problem says: output only the missing code. We output the for loop.\n\nBut the TODO block is the entire while loop? So we replace the while loop with the for loop.\n\nTherefore, the above is the missing code.\n\nBut note: in program2.py, the function `inv` is defined with a TODO. We output the body of the function.\n\nHowever, the function `inv` is:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with the return statement.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is the body of the function: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\".\n\nBut note: we must indent properly.\n\nFinally, we output the JSON."
