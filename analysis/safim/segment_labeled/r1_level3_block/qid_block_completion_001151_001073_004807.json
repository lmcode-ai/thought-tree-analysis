The gap between x[i] (at 100*(n-1)) and x[i+1] (beyond) might have the last hut? However, the last hut is at 100*(n-1). The ice cream shop at x[i] is at 100*(n-1). Then the next hut index we consider is x[i]//100+1 = n -> which is beyond the last hut (which is index n-1). So the last hut is already covered by the ice cream shop at x[i]? But note: the new shop can be placed in the gap to capture some huts? The last hut is at 100*(n-1). The existing shop at x[i]=100*(n-1) is at the same location. Then the new shop must be placed such that it is strictly closer to the last hut than the existing shop? That requires being within 50 meters to the left? But then the last hut would be captured? However, the gap processing in the code starts at hut index l = n, which is beyond the last hut (index n-1). So we skip. Therefore, we break. So the missing code for program1 is:\n\n        break\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is in the if block. We can write:\n\n        break\n\n   However, the code after the if condition is the gap processing.",

Actually, the sample n=3: \n            k=ceil(6/3)=2 -> and the sample solution: (1,1) and (1,2) -> but that doesn't cover (3,3)? The known solution from the note: \n            n=3: \n                (1,1) and (1,2) -> \n                (1,1) covers: row1, col1, and diagonal 0 (1-1=0) -> so (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1),(2,2) [because 2-2=0] and (3,3) [3-3=0] -> but (2,3) and (3,2) are not covered? (1,2) covers: row1, col2, and diagonal -1 (1-2=-1) -> so (1,1) to (1,3) already covered by row1, and col2: (1,2),(2,2),(3,2). Diagonal -1: (1,2), (2,3) -> so (2,3) is covered. Then (3,2) is covered by the second queen? (3,2): same row? no. same col? col2 -> yes. (3,3): covered by the first queen? by diagonal: 3-3=0, and the first queen has 1-1=0 -> same diagonal? -> yes.

Alternatively, the problem might be: \n            k = (n+1)//2   -> but that is not. After rethinking: the note says: \n            Example 1: n=1 -> k=1\n            Example 2: n=2 -> k=1\n            Example 3: n=3 -> k=2 And for n=4: k= ceil(8/3)=3, n=5: ceil(10/3)=4, n=6: ceil(12/3)=4. The construction in the code for n=6:\n            Find x: 3*x+2<=6 -> x<= (6-2)/3=1.33 -> largest integer x=1. Then:\n                first block: x=1 queen: (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1) then z=2, x becomes 2.\n                second block: 2 queens: \n                    (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n                then z=4. then (n-2)%3 = (6-2)%3=4%3=1 -> one more: \n                    (4+1-0-1, 4+0) = (4,4)\n                total = 1+2+1 = 4. And 4 = ceil(12/3)=4. So for n=6 it works. For n=5: \n            We need 4 queens, but the construction in the code only gives 3. What went wrong for n=5? The condition: 3*x+2<=5 -> x<=1 -> x=1. Then the construction: \n                first block: 1 queen: (1,1)\n                second block: 2 queens: (3,2), (2,3)\n                then (n-2)%3 = 3%3=0 -> no more.\n                total=3. But we need 4. The known solution for n=5: \n            We can use: \n                (1,1), (2,3), (3,5), (4,2) -> but let me check coverage. How can we adjust the code for n=5? The code has a loop: \n            for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n                if 3*i+2<=n:\n                    x = i\n                    break\n\n        For n=5, we set x=1. But note: the next value of i is 0: 3*0+2=2<=5 -> then we would set x=0? and then break? But we are iterating from high to low, so we take the first (largest) i. So we set x=1. However, the total queens = x + (x+1) + (n-2)%3 = 1+2+0=3, which is not 4. The intended total queens = ceil(2*n/3) = 4. The code then prints k=3, which is not enough. This means the construction in the code is not for the minimum for n=5. Alternatively, the construction might be different. I found a known solution for this exact problem (CodeForces 1145E) but it is not. After reading the sample construction in the problem: \n            n=3: \n                k=2, and they do: \n                    ans.append((1,1))\n                    ans.append((1,2)) In the code for n=3, it is handled as a special case. For n>=4, the code uses the for-loop to determine x. For n=5, we need 4 queens. The code currently only places 3. The TODO: we set x=i and break. But what if we do not break? We would continue and overwrite x with a smaller i? The for-loop is from 100000 down to 0. We break at the first i (largest) that satisfies the condition. But if we do not break, then x would be set to the last i that satisfies the condition, which is i=0. Then for n=5: \n            x=0. first block: range(0) -> nothing. then z=1, x becomes 1.\n            second block: range(1) -> one queen: (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1)\n            then z=2. then (n-2)%3=3%3=0 -> nothing. total=1 queen -> not enough. So that is worse. What if we do not break and then use the largest i? We already set x to the largest i, and then break to exit the loop. The issue is that the construction for n=5 is not handled. The code has: \n            for i in range(100000, -1, -1): if 3*i+2 <= n:\n                    x = i\n                    # then what? break or not? But note: the sample n=4: \n            i=0: 3*0+2=2<=4 -> then x=0. then first block: 0 queens. then x becomes 1.\n            second block: 1 queen: (1,1)\n            then (4-2)%3=2%3=2 -> two queens: \n                i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n            total=0+1+2=3. This matches. For n=5: \n            i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> x=1. then first block: 1 queen: (1,1)\n            then x becomes 2.\n            second block: 2 queens: (3,2), (2,3)\n            then (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> 0.\n            total=3. But we need 4. The code then has a third block: for i in range((n-2)%3) -> which is 0. So we are missing one queen. The known solution for n=5 is 4. How can we get one more queen?

(hut i at 100*(i-1) for 1-indexed? Actually, the problem says hut i is at 100*(i-1) meters? But note: hut 1 is at left, hut i+1 is 100 meters to the right of hut i. So hut 1 is at 0, hut 2 at 100, ... hut n at 100*(n-1).\n\n The existing ice cream shops are given and sorted.\n\n The idea in the code:\n   s = sum(p[:-(-(x[0])//100)])   # This is the sum of people from hut0 to the hut just before the first ice cream shop's coverage? Actually, -(-x[0]//100) is ceiling of x[0]/100. But note: in Python, -(-a//b) is a common way to do ceiling division.\n\n However, note: the first ice cream shop at x[0] meters. The huts are at positions 0, 100, 200, ... so the hut index for a location x is floor(x/100) for 0-indexed? But note: the huts are 1-indexed? Actually, the problem says hut i is at 100*(i-1).

Actually, if x[i] is at 150, then x[i]//100 = 1 (if integer division truncates) so hut index 1 (0-indexed) is at 100, but note: the first hut is at 0. So we have:\n      hut0: 0, hut1: 100, hut2: 200, ... hut n-1: 100*(n-1)\n\n Therefore, the hut index for a location x is x//100 (if we use 0-indexed for the array p). But note: the array p has p[0] for hut1? Actually, the input: \"p1, p2, ... pn\" -> p[0] is p1.\n\n So the hut at position 0 is represented by p[0]. The hut at position 100 is p[1], etc.\n\n The code has:\n   s = sum(p[:-(-(x[0])//100)]) \n   This is the sum of p[0] to p[ceil(x[0]/100)-1]? Because -(-x[0]//100) is the ceiling of x[0]/100, and then we take p[0:ceil(x[0]/100)]? But note: the slice in Python is [start:stop] and stop is exclusive.\n\n Actually, the code is taking the sum from the beginning to the hut that is at the left of the first ice cream shop? But note: the new shop can be placed to the left of the first existing shop and then capture all huts from the beginning up to the midpoint between the first shop and the next (but there is no next to the left). So the initial s is the sum of huts from the start to the hut that is the last hut strictly to the left of the first ice cream shop? \n\n However, the note says: in the first sample, we can get 7 (which is p0+p1 = 2+5). The first sample: \n   n=3, m=2, p=[2,5,3], x=[100,200] -> then the new shop at 150 captures hut1 (at 0) and hut2 (at 100) because 150 is closer to hut1 (distance 150) than the first shop at 100 (distance 100) -> but wait, 150 is not closer to hut1 (distance 150) than the shop at 100 (distance 100). \n\n Let me reexamine the sample: \n   Hut1 at 0, Hut2 at 100, Hut3 at 200.\n   Existing shops at 100 and 200.\n   The new shop at 150: \n      Hut1: distance to 150 = 150, to 100 = 100 -> 100 is closer -> Hut1 goes to the shop at 100.\n      Hut2: distance to 150 = 50, to 100 = 50 -> same? but the problem says \"strictly closer\". So Hut2 is not captured.\n      Hut3: 200: distance to 150=50, to 200=0 -> 200 is closer.\n\n So how do we get 7? The sample says: \"the first two huts\" -> meaning Hut1 and Hut2? But that doesn't work as above.\n\n Actually, the sample says: \"In the first sample, you can place the shop (coloured orange in the picture below) 150 meters to the right of the first hut (for example) so that it is the closest shop to the first two huts, which have 2 and 5 people, for a total of 7 sold ice creams.\"\n\n But wait: the first two huts are Hut1 (at 0) and Hut2 (at 100). \n   For Hut1: \n        existing shop at 100: distance = 100\n        existing shop at 200: distance = 200\n        new shop at 150: distance = 150 -> not closer than 100? \n   For Hut2:\n        existing shop at 100: 0? -> wait, the shop at 100 is at the same location as Hut2? Then the distance is 0. The new shop at 150 is 50 away -> not closer.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"people would come to your shop only if it is strictly closer to their hut than any other ice cream shop.\"\n\n If there is an ice cream shop at the same location as a hut, then the distance is 0. So if we put a shop at 150, then for Hut2 (at 100) the existing shop at 100 is 0 away and we are 50 away -> we are not strictly closer.\n\n How about placing the shop at 50? \n   Hut1: distance to 50: 50, to 100: 100 -> 50 is strictly closer -> captured.\n   Hut2: distance to 50: 50, to 100: 0 -> 0 is closer -> not captured.\n   Hut3: 50: 150, 100: 100, 200:0 -> not captured.\n\n Then we only get 2.\n\n How about 75?\n   Hut1: 75 vs 100 -> 75 < 100 -> captured.\n   Hut2: 25 vs 0 -> 25>0 -> not captured.\n   Hut3: 125 vs 100 -> 125>100 -> not captured.\n\n How about 140?\n   Hut1: 140 vs 100 -> 140>100 -> not captured.\n   Hut2: 40 vs 0 -> 40>0 -> not captured.\n   Hut3: 60 vs 100 -> 60<100 -> captured? but wait, there's also a shop at 200: 60 vs 60? -> same? Actually, the distance from Hut3 to 140 is 60, to 200 is 60 -> not strictly closer.\n\n How about 149?\n   Hut1: 149 vs 100 -> 149>100 -> not captured.\n   Hut2: 49 vs 0 -> 49>0 -> not captured.\n   Hut3: 51 vs 100 -> 51<100 -> captured? and to 200: 51 vs 100 -> 51<100? Actually, 200-100=100, but 200-149=51? Wait: Hut3 is at 200. \n        to 149: 51\n        to 200: 0 -> not captured.\n\n How about 149 is not capturing Hut3.\n\n The sample output is 7, which is 2+5. So we must capture Hut1 and Hut2? \n\n The note says: \"In the first sample, you can place the shop (coloured orange in the picture below) 150 meters to the right of the first hut (for example) so that it is the closest shop to the first two huts\"\n\n But as we saw, 150 doesn't capture Hut1 and Hut2.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the existing shops are at 100 and 200, but the huts are at 0,100,200. Then the new shop at 150: \n   Hut1: 150 vs 100 -> 150>100 -> not captured.\n   Hut2: 50 vs 0 (from the shop at 100) -> but wait, the shop at 100 is at the same location as Hut2? Then the distance for Hut2 to the shop at 100 is 0. The new shop is 50 away -> not strictly closer.\n   Hut3: 50 vs 0 (from the shop at 200) -> not captured.\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n After rethinking: the problem says \"In hut i there are p_i people\". The first sample: n=3, m=2, p=[2,5,3] -> so hut1:2, hut2:5, hut3:3. The existing shops at 100 and 200.\n\n The sample solution: 7 = 2+5 -> so we capture hut1 and hut2.\n\n How can that be? \n   The key: the existing shops are at 100 and 200. The new shop at 150: \n        For hut1 (at 0): \n            distance to new shop: 150\n            distance to existing: min(100, 200) -> 100 -> 150>100 -> not captured? \n        For hut2 (at 100):\n            distance to new shop: 50\n            distance to existing: min(0, 100) -> 0 -> 50>0 -> not captured.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"strictly closer than any other ice cream shop\". So if there is an existing shop at 100, then for hut2 the distance is 0. The new shop at 150 is 50 away -> not strictly closer.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the other ice cream shops\". The shop at 100 is at the same location as hut2? Then the distance is 0. The new shop is 50 away -> not closer.\n\n How about if we place the shop at 0? \n   Hut1: 0 -> then we are at 0: distance=0 -> but then the existing shop at 100: distance=100 -> so we are strictly closer? \n        But wait: there is an existing shop at 100, so for hut1: \n            new shop: 0 -> distance=0\n            existing shop at 100: 100 -> so we are closer -> captured.\n   Hut2: \n            new shop: 100 away\n            existing shop at 100: 0 -> so existing is closer -> not captured.\n   Hut3: \n            new shop: 200 away\n            existing shop at 100: 100 -> 100<200 -> not captured.\n   Then we get 2.\n\n How about 50? \n   Hut1: 50 vs 50 (to 100) -> 50<50? no, equal? -> not strictly closer? \n        Actually, 50 is not strictly less than 50 -> not captured.\n   Hut2: 50 vs 50 (to 100) -> same -> not captured.\n\n How about 49? \n   Hut1: 49 vs 51 -> 49<51 -> captured.\n   Hut2: 51 vs 1 -> 51>1 -> not captured.\n\n Then we get 2.\n\n How about 1? \n   Hut1: 1 vs 99 -> captured.\n   Hut2: 99 vs 1 -> not captured.\n\n Then we get 2.\n\n How about 250? \n   Hut3: 50 vs 50 (to 200) -> not strictly closer.\n\n How about 300? \n   Hut3: 100 vs 100 (to 200) -> not strictly closer.\n\n How about 190? \n   Hut3: 10 vs 10 (to 200) -> not strictly closer.\n\n How about 180? \n   Hut3: 20 vs 20 (to 200) -> not.\n\n How about 170? \n   Hut3: 30 vs 30 (to 200) -> not.\n\n How about 160? \n   Hut3: 40 vs 40 (to 200) -> not.\n\n How about 140? \n   Hut3: 60 vs 60 (to 200) -> not.\n\n How about 130? \n   Hut3: 70 vs 70 (to 200) -> not.\n\n How about 120? \n   Hut3: 80 vs 80 (to 200) -> not.\n\n How about 110? \n   Hut3: 90 vs 90 (to 200) -> not.\n\n How about 90? \n   Hut1: 90 vs 10 -> 90>10 -> not.\n   Hut2: 10 vs 10 (to 100) -> not.\n\n How about 0? we did.\n\n The sample solution says 7. \n\n Another possibility: the new shop at 50 doesn't work, but what if we place it at 0? then we get hut1 only -> 2.\n\n The sample solution says 7 = 2+5 -> so we must capture hut1 and hut2.\n\n After reading the note again: \"In the first sample, you can place the shop (coloured orange in the picture below) 150 meters to the right of the first hut (for example) so that it is the closest shop to the first two huts\"\n\n But 150 is not capturing the first two huts. \n\n However, note: the problem says \"the other ice cream shops\" \u2014 meaning all others. The existing shops are at 100 and 200. For hut1 (at 0):\n   distance to new shop at 150: 150\n   distance to existing: min(100, 200) = 100 -> 150>100 -> not captured.\n\n For hut2 (at 100):\n   distance to new shop: 50\n   distance to existing: min(0 (to the shop at 100), 100 (to 200)) -> 0 -> 50>0 -> not captured.\n\n This is a mystery.\n\n I found an online solution for a similar problem (CodeForces 372A) but note the problem here is different.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the existing shops are not necessarily at hut positions? They are at arbitrary positions. The note says: \"The blue cells are under attack.\" but that is for program2.\n\n Let me check the second sample: \n   Input: n=4, m=3, p=[1,2,3,4], x=[220, 50, 190]\n   Output: 15 -> which is 3+4+8? wait, the note says: \"the last two huts, which have 7 and 8 people\" -> but the input p=[1,2,3,4] doesn't have 7 and 8.\n\n Actually, the note says: \"In the second sample, you can place the shop 170 meters to the right of the first hut (for example) so that it is the closest shop to the last two huts, which have 7 and 8 people, for a total of 15 sold ice creams.\"\n\n So the second sample has huts with 7 and 8 people? \n\n The input specification: the second line contains n integers p1,...,pn. The sample input must be: \n   n=4, m=3, p = [?, ?, 7, 8] -> but the note says \"last two huts\" have 7 and 8.\n\n But the example input in the problem statement for the second sample is not provided. \n\n However, the provided code for program1 has a specific structure. \n\n The approach in the code:\n\n   s = sum(p[0: ceil(x[0]/100)])   # This is the sum for huts that are strictly to the left of the first ice cream shop? \n\n   Then it iterates over the gaps between ice cream shops.\n\n   For a gap between x[i] and x[i+1]:\n        It calculates the midpoint: (x[i+1]-x[i])/2 -> then the number of huts that can be captured in the gap is the integer part of (midpoint/100) + 1? \n        Then it defines:\n            l = x[i]//100 + 1   -> the first hut index (0-indexed) that is to the right of x[i] (or at x[i]? but if x[i] is at a hut, then we start at the next hut)\n            r = ceil(x[i+1]/100) -> but then clamped to n.\n\n        Then it considers a window of huts from l to r, and within that window, it considers a contiguous segment of 'num' huts that can be captured by a shop placed in the gap.\n\n        The variable 'num' is the number of huts that are captured in one contiguous block? \n\n        Then it uses a sliding window of size 'num' to compute the maximum sum of p in any contiguous segment of 'num' huts in [l, r).\n\n   Finally, it considers the segment after the last ice cream shop.\n\n The problem in the code: when x[i]//100+1 >= n, then we skip? But we should break? Because there are no huts to the right.\n\n So the TODO: \n   We should break out of the loop? Or continue? \n\n   Since if x[i]//100+1 >= n, then the next hut index is beyond the last hut, so we skip this gap.\n\n   We can do: \n        continue\n\n But note: the next gap might be after the last hut? Actually, the ice cream shops are sorted. If x[i] is beyond the last hut, then x[i+1] is even further. So we can break? \n\n   However, we are in a loop for i in range(len(x)-1). We can break the loop? But we have to process the last gap? Actually, the last gap is between x[-2] and x[-1]. If x[-2] is beyond the last hut, then x[-1] is too. \n\n   We can break the entire loop? But the next gap might be the last one and we haven't processed it? \n\n   Alternatively, we can skip this gap and continue to the next.\n\n   But note: if x[i]//100+1 >= n, then l = x[i]//100+1 >= n, and then r = min(ceil(x[i+1]/100), n) = n. Then the segment [l, r) is [n, n) -> empty. So the while loop won't run. \n\n   So we can just skip by doing nothing? But the code currently has a TODO and then nothing. We can do:\n\n        pass   # or just continue\n\n   But the problem is that we might miss the gap that is beyond the last hut? Actually, the gap beyond the last hut is handled after the loop: s = max(s, sum(p[x[-1]//100+1:]) \n\n   So if we skip the gap between x[i] and x[i+1] when x[i]//100+1>=n, then we are safe.\n\n   However, we must also consider that the gap might start before the last hut and extend beyond? But the condition is: l = x[i]//100+1 >= n -> then there are no huts in the gap.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        continue\n\n   But note: the code after the if condition does the processing for the gap. We want to skip that processing.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        if x[i]//100+1 >= n:\n            continue\n\n   However, the code already has an if condition and then a TODO. We just need to skip the rest of the loop body for this i.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break out of the loop because if x[i]//100+1>=n, then for all j>=i, the gaps will be beyond the last hut? But not necessarily: what if x[i] is at 100*(n) and x[i+1] is at 100*(n+1000)? Then the gap might cover the last hut? \n\n   But note: the last hut is at 100*(n-1). So if x[i]//100+1 >= n, then x[i] >= 100*(n) -> then the last hut is at 100*(n-1) which is less than 100*n. So the gap between x[i] and x[i+1] is beyond the last hut. \n\n   Therefore, we can break the loop? \n\n   But the loop is for i in range(len(x)-1). We can break to avoid unnecessary iterations.\n\n   So:\n\n        if x[i]//100+1 >= n:\n            break\n\n   However, the next gap might be the last one and we break the loop? But if we break, we skip the remaining gaps. But if one gap is beyond the last hut, then the next gaps are even further, so they are also beyond. So breaking is safe.\n\n   But note: the gap between x[i] and x[i+1] is the i-th gap. We break at the first gap that is beyond the last hut, and then the loop ends. Then we do the last part: after the last ice cream shop.\n\n   But the last part: s = max(s, sum(p[x[-1]//100+1:])) -> this is for the segment after the last ice cream shop. But if the last ice cream shop is beyond the last hut, then x[-1]//100+1 >= n, so the slice p[x[-1]//100+1:] is empty -> sum=0.\n\n   So we can break.\n\n   Alternatively, we can continue to the next gap? But if we break, we save time.\n\n   Since n and m can be up to 200000, breaking early is good.\n\n   So:\n\n        if x[i]//100+1 >= n:\n            break\n\n   But note: what if the gap is not beyond? Then we do the processing.\n\n   However, the condition is: if x[i]//100+1 >= n -> then break.\n\n   But what if x[i] is at 100*(n-1) (the last hut)? Then x[i]//100 = n-1, so x[i]//100+1 = n -> which is >= n -> break.\n\n   But the gap between x[i] and x[i+1] might cover the last hut? Actually, the last hut is at 100*(n-1). The gap between x[i] (at 100*(n-1)) and x[i+1] (beyond) might have the last hut? \n\n   However, the last hut is at 100*(n-1). The ice cream shop at x[i] is at 100*(n-1). Then the next hut index we consider is x[i]//100+1 = n -> which is beyond the last hut (which is index n-1). So the last hut is already covered by the ice cream shop at x[i]? \n\n   But note: the new shop can be placed in the gap to capture some huts? The last hut is at 100*(n-1). The existing shop at x[i]=100*(n-1) is at the same location. Then the new shop must be placed such that it is strictly closer to the last hut than the existing shop? That requires being within 50 meters to the left? But then the last hut would be captured? \n\n   However, the gap processing in the code starts at hut index l = n, which is beyond the last hut (index n-1). So we skip.\n\n   Therefore, we break.\n\n   So the missing code for program1 is:\n\n        break\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is in the if block. We can write:\n\n        break\n\n   However, the code after the if condition is the gap processing. We want to skip that for this gap and also for the remaining gaps? So break.\n\n   But what if there are multiple gaps beyond the last hut? We break at the first one.\n\n   This is safe.\n\nProgram2:\n The problem: place minimum half-queens to cover an n x n board.\n\n The provided code has:\n   if n<=2: ... \n   if n==3: ...\n   else:\n        for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n            if 3*i+2 <= n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then it uses x (which is not defined) and then does:\n            z = 1\n            for i in range(x):\n                ans.append(...)   # with z+x-i-1 and z+i\n            z += x\n            x += 1\n            for i in range(x):\n                ans.append(...)   # with z+x-i-1 and z+i\n            z += x\n            for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ... \n\n        Then k = len(ans)\n\n The TODO: we are iterating i from 100000 down to 0, and we are looking for the largest i such that 3*i+2<=n? \n\n But note: the condition is 3*i+2<=n. We want the largest i? Because we are iterating from 100000 down to 0, so the first i we find is the largest.\n\n Then we should set x = i? and then break out of the loop? \n\n   x = i\n   break\n\n But note: the variable x is used later. We must set x to that i.\n\n   So:\n\n        x = i\n        break\n\n   But what if we don't find any? Then we must have a fallback? The condition 3*i+2<=n must hold for some i? Since n>=4, we can take i=0: 3*0+2=2<=n -> so we will always find one? \n\n   However, we are iterating from 100000 down to 0, so we will always break at the largest i.\n\n   So:\n\n        x = i\n        break\n\n   But note: the variable x is used in the subsequent code. We must define x. The code after the for loop uses x. So we break and set x.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set x = (n-2)//3? But the condition is 3*i+2<=n -> i <= (n-2)//3. The largest integer i is floor((n-2)/3). \n\n   But the for loop does the same: finds the largest i such that 3*i+2<=n.\n\n   So we set x = i and break.\n\n   Then the code proceeds to place half-queens.\n\n   The next part: \n        for i in range(x):\n            ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )   # note: the problem uses 1-indexed.\n\n        Then z += x\n        Then x += 1   -> now x becomes x+1\n\n        Then for i in range(x):   # which is x+1\n            ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )\n\n        Then z += x   # which is x+1\n\n        Then for i in range((n-2)%3):\n            ... \n\n   This is a known construction? \n\n   The known solution for half-queens: \n        k = ceil(2*n/3) \n        and then a specific pattern.\n\n   But the problem says: minimum number of half-queens is k = ceil(2*n/3) for n>=3? \n\n   However, the sample: \n        n=1: k=1 -> ceil(2/3)=ceil(0.66)=1 -> matches.\n        n=2: k=1 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> but the sample says k=1.\n\n   Actually, the known solution for half-queens: \n        k = ceil(2*(n-1)/3) + 1? \n\n   But the problem says: \n        n=1: k=1 -> works.\n        n=2: k=1 -> works.\n        n=3: k=2 -> ceil(2*3/3)=ceil(2)=2 -> works.\n\n        n=4: ceil(8/3)=ceil(2.66)=3 -> but the construction in the code: \n            We are looking for the largest i such that 3*i+2<=4 -> i=0 -> then x=0.\n            Then we do:\n                z=1\n                for i in range(0): ... # nothing\n                then x becomes 1\n                for i in range(1): \n                    ans.append( (z+1-0-1, z+0) ) = (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1)\n                then z += 1 -> z=2\n                then for i in range((4-2)%3)=range(2%3)=range(2): \n                    i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n\n            So we have half-queens at (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) -> 3 queens.\n\n            But the minimum k for n=4 is 3? \n\n        However, the known solution for n=4: \n            k = ceil(8/3)=3 -> so 3 is the minimum.\n\n        But the problem says: \"In the first line print a single integer k \u2014 the minimum number of half-queens.\"\n\n        So the code is constructing 3 for n=4.\n\n        How about n=5: \n            We need i: 3*i+2<=5 -> i<= (5-2)/3=1 -> so i=1 -> x=1.\n            Then:\n                z=1\n                for i in range(1): \n                    (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1)\n                z=2\n                x becomes 2\n                for i in range(2):\n                    i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n                z=4\n                then for i in range((5-2)%3)=range(3%3)=range(0) -> nothing.\n\n            So we have 3 half-queens.\n\n            But ceil(2*5/3)=ceil(10/3)=ceil(3.33)=4 -> so 3 is not enough? \n\n        However, the known solution for n=5: \n            k = ceil(2*5/3)=4.\n\n        Why the discrepancy? \n\n        The construction in the code: \n            We have x = (n-2)//3? Actually, we set x = i = floor((n-2)/3). For n=5: (5-2)//3 = 1.\n\n        Then the total number of queens placed: \n            first block: x queens\n            second block: x+1 queens\n            third block: (n-2)%3 queens.\n\n            total = x + (x+1) + (n-2)%3 = 2*x+1 + (n-2)%3.\n\n            For n=5: 2*1+1 + (3%3)= 3+0=3.\n\n        But we need 4.\n\n        Alternatively, the known solution: \n            k = ceil(2*n/3)\n\n        For n=5: ceil(10/3)=4.\n\n        How do we get 4? \n\n        The construction in the code might be incomplete? \n\n        Actually, the known construction for half-queens: \n            Place queens at (i, 2*i mod n) for i in range(ceil(2*n/3))? \n\n        But the problem has a specific construction.\n\n        After reading the code: \n            The first block: \n                for i in range(x):\n                    row = z + x - i - 1   # which is 1 + 1 - 0 - 1 = 1\n                    col = z + i            # 1+0=1\n                -> (1,1)\n\n            The second block: \n                for i in range(x+1):   # x+1 = 2\n                    row = z + (x+1) - i - 1   # z=2, so 2+2-0-1=3, then 2+2-1-1=2\n                    col = z + i                # 2+0=2, then 2+1=3\n                -> (3,2) and (2,3)\n\n            Then the third block: \n                for i in range((n-2)%3):   # (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> nothing.\n\n            So we have 3 queens.\n\n        But we need 4. \n\n        The problem: the construction might be for a different representation? \n\n        Alternatively, the variable x we set is the largest i such that 3*i+2<=n. For n=5: \n            i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> so x=1.\n\n        Then the total queens = x + (x+1) + (n-2)%3 = 1+2+0 = 3.\n\n        But ceil(2*5/3)=4.\n\n        So the construction is not matching.\n\n        I found a known solution for half-queens: \n            k = (n+1)//2   -> but that is for a different problem.\n\n        After research: \n            The known solution for this problem (CodeForces problem) is to use k = ceil(2*n/3) and then place the queens at:\n                (i, (2*i) % n) for i in range(ceil(2*n/3))   -> but that doesn't work for n=5.\n\n        Actually, the sample n=3: \n            k=ceil(6/3)=2 -> and the sample solution: (1,1) and (1,2) -> but that doesn't cover (3,3)? \n\n        The known solution from the note: \n            n=3: \n                (1,1) and (1,2) -> \n                (1,1) covers: row1, col1, and diagonal 0 (1-1=0) -> so (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1),(2,2) [because 2-2=0] and (3,3) [3-3=0] -> but (2,3) and (3,2) are not covered? \n                (1,2) covers: row1, col2, and diagonal -1 (1-2=-1) -> so (1,1) to (1,3) already covered by row1, and col2: (1,2),(2,2),(3,2). Diagonal -1: (1,2), (2,3) -> so (2,3) is covered. \n                Then (3,2) is covered by the second queen? \n                    (3,2): same row? no. same col? col2 -> yes. \n                (3,3): covered by the first queen? by diagonal: 3-3=0, and the first queen has 1-1=0 -> same diagonal? -> yes.\n\n            So it works.\n\n        How about n=5 with 4 queens? \n\n        The construction in the provided code might be different.\n\n        The code after the for-loop does:\n\n            z = 1\n            for i in range(x): \n                ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )   # (x - i - 1 + z, i + z)\n\n            Then z += x\n            x += 1\n            for i in range(x): \n                ans.append( (z + x - i - 1, z + i) )   # (x - i - 1 + z, i + z)   but note x is now x_old+1\n\n            Then z += x   (which is x_old+1)\n            Then for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ans.append( (z + (n-2)%3 - i - 1, z + i) )\n\n        For n=5: \n            x = 1\n            First block: i in [0,1): \n                i=0: (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1)\n            Then z = 1+1 = 2, x becomes 2.\n            Second block: i in [0,2):\n                i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n            Then z = 2+2 = 4.\n            Then (n-2)%3 = 3%3=0 -> nothing.\n\n            So we have (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) -> 3 queens.\n\n        But we need 4.\n\n        The known solution for n=5: \n            k=4.\n\n        How to construct? \n\n        The problem says: \"if there are multiple solutions, print any\"\n\n        The provided code might be for a different construction that uses fewer queens? \n\n        But the minimum k for n=5 is 4.\n\n        The code then prints k = len(ans) = 3, which is not 4.\n\n        So the construction in the code is not for the minimum? \n\n        I see: the for-loop that sets x is for a specific purpose.

For n=5, x=1.\n\n        Then the total queens = 1+2+0 = 3, which is not 4.\n\n        This indicates the provided code might be incomplete or the construction is different.\n\n        I found an online solution for a problem with the same name (CodeForces 1145E) but it is not.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be: \n            k = (n+1)//2   -> but that is not.\n\n        After rethinking: the note says: \n            Example 1: n=1 -> k=1\n            Example 2: n=2 -> k=1\n            Example 3: n=3 -> k=2\n\n        And for n=4: k= ceil(8/3)=3, n=5: ceil(10/3)=4, n=6: ceil(12/3)=4.\n\n        The construction in the code for n=6:\n            Find x: 3*x+2<=6 -> x<= (6-2)/3=1.33 -> largest integer x=1.\n            Then:\n                first block: x=1 queen: (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1)\n                then z=2, x becomes 2.\n                second block: 2 queens: \n                    (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                    (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n                then z=4.\n                then (n-2)%3 = (6-2)%3=4%3=1 -> one more: \n                    (4+1-0-1, 4+0) = (4,4)\n                total = 1+2+1 = 4.\n\n            And 4 = ceil(12/3)=4.\n\n        So for n=6 it works.\n\n        For n=5: \n            We need 4 queens, but the construction in the code only gives 3.\n\n        What went wrong for n=5? \n            The condition: 3*x+2<=5 -> x<=1 -> x=1.\n            Then the construction: \n                first block: 1 queen: (1,1)\n                second block: 2 queens: (3,2), (2,3)\n                then (n-2)%3 = 3%3=0 -> no more.\n                total=3.\n\n        But we need 4.\n\n        The known solution for n=5: \n            We can use: \n                (1,1), (2,3), (3,5), (4,2) -> but let me check coverage.\n\n        How can we adjust the code for n=5? \n\n        The code has a loop: \n            for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n                if 3*i+2<=n:\n                    x = i\n                    break\n\n        For n=5, we set x=1.\n\n        But note: the next value of i is 0: 3*0+2=2<=5 -> then we would set x=0? and then break? \n\n        But we are iterating from high to low, so we take the first (largest) i. So we set x=1.\n\n        However, the total queens = x + (x+1) + (n-2)%3 = 1+2+0=3, which is not 4.\n\n        The intended total queens = ceil(2*n/3) = 4.\n\n        The code then prints k=3, which is not enough.\n\n        This means the construction in the code is not for the minimum for n=5.\n\n        Alternatively, the construction might be different. \n\n        I found a known solution for this exact problem (CodeForces 1145E) but it is not.\n\n        After reading the sample construction in the problem: \n            n=3: \n                k=2, and they do: \n                    ans.append((1,1))\n                    ans.append((1,2))\n\n            In the code for n=3, it is handled as a special case.\n\n        For n>=4, the code uses the for-loop to determine x.\n\n        For n=5, we need 4 queens. The code currently only places 3.\n\n        The TODO: we set x=i and break. But what if we do not break? We would continue and overwrite x with a smaller i? \n\n        The for-loop is from 100000 down to 0. We break at the first i (largest) that satisfies the condition.\n\n        But if we do not break, then x would be set to the last i that satisfies the condition, which is i=0.\n\n        Then for n=5: \n            x=0.\n            first block: range(0) -> nothing.\n            then z=1, x becomes 1.\n            second block: range(1) -> one queen: (1+1-0-1, 1+0) = (1,1)\n            then z=2.\n            then (n-2)%3=3%3=0 -> nothing.\n            total=1 queen -> not enough.\n\n        So that is worse.\n\n        What if we do not break and then use the largest i? We already set x to the largest i, and then break to exit the loop.\n\n        The issue is that the construction for n=5 is not handled.\n\n        The code has: \n            for i in range(100000, -1, -1):\n                if 3*i+2 <= n:\n                    x = i\n                    # then what? break or not?\n\n        But note: the sample n=4: \n            i=0: 3*0+2=2<=4 -> then x=0.\n            then first block: 0 queens.\n            then x becomes 1.\n            second block: 1 queen: (1,1)\n            then (4-2)%3=2%3=2 -> two queens: \n                i=0: (2+2-0-1, 2+0) = (3,2)\n                i=1: (2+2-1-1, 2+1) = (2,3)\n            total=0+1+2=3.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        For n=5: \n            i=1: 3*1+2=5<=5 -> x=1.\n            then first block: 1 queen: (1,1)\n            then x becomes 2.\n            second block: 2 queens: (3,2), (2,3)\n            then (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> 0.\n            total=3.\n\n        But we need 4.\n\n        The code then has a third block: for i in range((n-2)%3) -> which is 0.\n\n        So we are missing one queen.\n\n        The known solution for n=5 is 4.\n\n        How can we get one more queen? \n\n        The construction might require a third block unconditionally for the remaining part? \n\n        The code has: \n            for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ans.append( (z + (n-2)%3 - i - 1, z + i) )\n\n        For n=5: (n-2)%3=3%3=0.\n\n        But note: the total number of queens might be intended to be: \n            x + (x+1) + ceil((n - (3*x+2)) / something) \n\n        Alternatively, the condition in the for-loop might be: \n            if 3*x+2 <= n: \n                then we cover a board of size 3*x+2 with x+(x+1) = 2*x+1 queens.\n                then the remaining board is n - (3*x+2) in size, and we need to cover it with ... queens.\n\n        But the code currently only adds (n-2)%3 queens.\n\n        For n=5: \n            covered = 3*x+2 = 3*1+2=5 -> the whole board, so we don't need more.\n\n        But then why do we need 4 queens? \n\n        The construction might not cover the whole board with 3 queens for n=5.\n\n        We have queens at (1,1), (3,2), (2,3). \n        Check cell (5,5): \n            (5,5): \n                row5: not covered by any queen (no queen in row5)\n                col5: not covered by any queen.\n                diagonal: 5-5=0 -> queen at (1,1) has 1-1=0 -> covers (5,5) -> yes.\n\n        Check cell (4,4): \n            diagonal: 4-4=0 -> covered by (1,1).\n\n        Check cell (5,4):\n            row5: not covered.\n            col4: not covered.\n            diagonal: 5-4=1 -> is there a queen with a-b=1? \n                (1,1): 0\n                (3,2): 1 -> yes! so (5,4) is covered by (3,2) because 3-2=1 and 5-4=1.\n\n        cell (4,5): \n            diagonal: 4-5=-1 -> \n                (2,3): 2-3=-1 -> covered.\n\n        cell (5,1): \n            col1: (1,1) covers col1 -> covered.\n\n        cell (5,2): \n            col2: (3,2) covers col2 -> covered.\n\n        cell (5,3): \n            col3: (2,3) covers col3 -> covered.\n\n        cell (1,5): \n            row1: (1,1) covers row1 -> covered.\n\n        cell (2,5): \n            row2: not covered by any queen in row2? \n            col5: not covered by any queen in col5? \n            diagonal: 2-5=-3 -> not covered by any queen's diagonal? \n                (1,1): 0\n                (3,2): 1\n                (2,3): -1\n\n            So (2,5) is not covered.\n\n        Therefore, the construction for n=5 with 3 queens does not cover (2,5).\n\n        So we need an additional queen.\n\n        How does the code for n=5 work in the sample solution? \n\n        The problem says: \"if there are multiple solutions, print any\"\n\n        The code in the TODO: we set x=1 and break. Then we have 3 queens, but we need 4.\n\n        The code then has a third block: for i in range((n-2)%3) -> range(0) -> nothing.\n\n        So we only have 3.\n\n        To fix this, we might need to add more queens. \n\n        The intended construction might be: \n            We cover a board of size 3*x+2 with 2*x+1 queens, and then the remaining board of size n - (3*x+2) is covered by a recursive call? \n\n        But the code doesn't do that.\n\n        Alternatively, the condition should be: \n            if 3*x+2 <= n:\n                then we cover a board of size 3*x+2.\n                then we set n_new = n - (3*x+2) and then recursively do the same? \n\n        But the code is not recursive.\n\n        The variable 'z' is the starting index for the next block. In the code, after the two blocks, we have:\n            z = 1 + x + (x+1) = 1 + 2*x+1 = 2*x+2.\n\n        For n=5, x=1, then z=4.\n        Then the third block: \n            for i in range((n-2)%3):   -> range(0) -> nothing.\n\n        But note: the code has (n-2)%3, which is not the size of the remaining board.\n\n        The remaining board size is n - (3*x+2) = 5-5=0.\n\n        So we are done.\n\n        But we are not done because the board is not covered.\n\n        This indicates the construction in the code is flawed for n=5.\n\n        However, the problem says: the minimum number of half-queens is ceil(2*n/3). For n=5, that is 4.\n\n        The code currently outputs 3 for n=5, which is not the minimum.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code might be for a different construction that is not minimal? \n\n        But the problem asks for the minimum.\n\n        Alternatively, the construction in the code might be for a different purpose.\n\n        I see that the sample n=4: \n            queens at (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) -> 3 queens, which is ceil(8/3)=3.\n\n        And it is known that 3 is the minimum for n=4.\n\n        For n=5, the minimum is 4, so the code must output 4.\n\n        How to fix the code for n=5? \n\n        The condition in the for-loop: \n            if 3*i+2 <= n:\n\n        For n=5, i=1: 5<=5 -> valid, but then the construction only gives 3.\n\n        What if we use i=0 for n=5? then 3*0+2=2<=5 -> valid, then x=0.\n        Then first block: 0.\n        Then x becomes 1.\n        Then second block: 1 queen: (1,1)\n        Then z=2.\n        Then (n-2)%3=3%3=0 -> 0.\n        total=1.\n\n        worse.\n\n        What if we do not break at the first i, but continue to the last i that satisfies the condition and then choose the one that maximizes the number of queens? \n\n        But the for-loop is from high to low, and we break at the first (largest) i.\n\n        Alternatively, the construction might require more than two blocks.\n\n        The code has two blocks and then a small third block.\n\n        For n=5, we might need to do something else.\n\n        The known solution from a trusted source for this problem (CodeForces 1145E) is not available.\n\n        Given the time, and that the code for n=4 and n=6 works, but n=5 does not, and the sample n=3 is handled as a special case, we must complete the code as given.\n\n        The TODO: \n            We are to set x and then break.\n\n        But to make the construction work for n=5, we might need to set x differently.\n\n        The condition: 3*x+2<=n.\n\n        For n=5, the largest x is 1.\n\n        Then the code places 3 queens, but we need 4.\n\n        The only way is to add more queens in the third block. \n\n        The third block: \n            for i in range((n-2)%3):\n                ans.append( (z + (n-2)%3 - i - 1, z + i) )\n\n        For n=5: (n-2)%3=3%3=0 -> range(0) -> nothing.\n\n        What if we change the third block to cover the remaining part? \n\n        The intended meaning of (n-2)%3 might be a mistake.\n\n        Alternatively, the third block should be for the entire remaining board? \n\n        But the code does not have that.\n\n        Given the constraints, and that the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we must output only the two lines for the TODO.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            x = i\n            break\n\n        and hope that the construction is correct for the test cases.\n\n        But note: the sample n=3 is handled in the if, so we don't use the else branch.\n\n        n=4: works.\n        n=5: does not work.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all testcases does not exceed 200000.\" for program3, but for program2, the input n up to 100000.\n\n        And the online judge might not have n=5 as a test case? \n\n        But the problem statement says n>=1.\n\n        Alternatively, there is a known solution that uses the same construction and it is accepted in CodeForces.\n\n        After research, I found that in CodeForces history, there is a problem \"E. Half-queen\" in CodeForces Round #703 (Div. 2) (then it is not that).\n\n        Given the time, we output the two lines.\n\n        So for program2, the missing code is:\n\n            x = i\n            break\n\nProgram3:\n The problem: determine if a string s is perfectly balanced.\n\n The provided code:\n   t = int(input())\n   while(t):\n        s = input()\n        d = len(set(s))   # number of distinct characters\n        for i in range(d, len(s)):\n            if(s[i] != s[i - d]):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n        t -= 1\n\n The else block of the for-loop: if the for-loop completes without break, then print \"Yes\".\n\n The TODO: when we find an i (starting from d to len(s)-1) such that s[i] != s[i-d], then we need to do something.\n\n The note: \n   The first sample: \"aba\" -> d=2.\n        i from 2 to 2:\n            i=2: s[2]='a', s[2-2]=s[0]='a' -> equal -> then the for-loop completes and prints \"Yes\".\n\n   The second sample: \"abb\" -> d=2.\n        i=2: s[2]='b', s[0]='a' -> not equal -> then we enter the if.\n\n   The third sample: \"abc\" -> d=3, then i from 3 to ... but len(s)=3, so range(3,3) is empty -> for-loop does nothing -> prints \"Yes\".\n\n   So for \"abb\", we need to print \"No\".\n\n   Therefore, in the if block, we should print \"No\" and break out of the for-loop? \n\n   But then we also need to avoid the else block of the for-loop.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n        break\n\n   But note: the for-loop is inside the while for a test case. After we break out of the for-loop, we still have to do t-=1.\n\n   However, if we break out of the for-loop, we do not execute the else block of the for-loop. Then after the for-loop, we do t-=1.\n\n   But the code after the for-loop is the else block and then t-=1.\n\n   We want: if we find any i such that s[i]!=s[i-d], then we print \"No\" and then move to the next test case.\n\n   But the break in the for-loop will exit the for-loop, and then the else block (which is for normal exit) is skipped. Then we do t-=1.\n\n   However, we printed \"No\", and then we must not print anything else for this test case.\n\n   The current structure:\n\n        for i in range(d, len(s)):\n            if ...:\n                # TODO\n        else:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n   So if we do not break, then after the for-loop the else is executed.\n\n   If we break, the else is not executed.\n\n   So in the TODO, we can:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n        break\n\n   But then after the break, we exit the for-loop and then do t-=1.\n\n   That is correct.\n\n   However, what if there are multiple i? We only need to find one.\n\n   So:\n\n        for i in range(d, len(s)):\n            if s[i] != s[i-d]:\n                print(\"No\")\n                break\n        else:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n   This will work.\n\n   But note: the input string s might have a newline? The input() by default includes a newline. We should strip?\n\n   The problem: the sample \"abb\" has len(s)=3? or 4 with newline?\n\n   The input: \n        t\n        s1\n        s2\n        ...\n\n   We do: s = input(). If the string has a newline, then s might be \"abb\\n\", then len(s)=4, and d = len(set('abb\\n')) = 3 or 4? \n\n   The problem says: the string s consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n   And the example: \"aba\", \"abb\", \"abc\".\n\n   We should strip the newline.\n\n   But the code does not strip.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do: s = input().strip()\n\n   But the provided code does not strip.\n\n   The problem says: the total length of strings is <= 200000, so we can strip.\n\n   However, the TODO is only to complete the if block.\n\n   We are not allowed to change other parts.\n\n   So in the TODO, we assume that the string might have a newline, but the condition s[i]!=s[i-d] might then compare with a newline.\n\n   But the sample \"abb\" with newline: \n        s = \"abb\\n\"\n        d = len(set(\"abb\\n\")) = 4? \n        then i from 4 to 3 -> the range is empty -> prints \"Yes\", which is not correct.\n\n   Therefore, we must strip.\n\n   But the TODO is only in the if block. We cannot change the input.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem input might not have extra spaces.\n\n   The note: the first line is t, then t lines with a string s.\n\n   The sample: \n        Input: \n            3\n            aba\n            abb\n            abc\n\n        So the first string is \"aba\" (without newline? or with newline?).\n\n        In Python, input() returns a string including the newline? \n\n        We can use s = s.strip() before processing? But the TODO does not allow us to change that.\n\n   Given the constraints, and that the total length is 200000, we can hope that the online judge uses no extra spaces.\n\n   But to be safe, we should not assume.\n\n   However, the provided code does not strip, and we are only to complete the TODO.\n\n   So we output for the TODO:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n        break\n\n   But note: the sample \"aba\" and \"abc\" work, and \"abb\" will be detected at i=2: \n        s[2] and s[0]: \n            if s[2] is 'b' and s[0] is 'a', then we print \"No\" and break.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But if the string has a newline, then for \"abb\", we have:\n        s = \"abb\\n\"\n        d = 3 (if '\\n' is counted) or 3? set('abb\\n') = {'a','b','\\n'} -> d=3.\n        then i from 3 to 3: \n            s[3] = '\\n', s[0]='a' -> not equal -> print \"No\" -> break.\n\n   This is also correct.\n\n   So it works even with the newline.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program3 is:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n        break\n\n   But note: the problem may have multiple test cases, and we must only output one answer per test case.\n\n   This will print \"No\" and then break out of the for-loop, and then the while loop does t-=1 and continues.\n\n   So it is correct.\n\nSummary:\n\n   program1: \n        if x[i]//100+1 >= n:\n            break\n\n   program2:\n        x = i\n        break\n\n   program3:\n        print(\"No\")\n        break\n\n But note: the output format is JSON.\n\n   {\n        \"program1\": \"break\",\n        \"program2\": \"x = i\\nbreak\",\n        \"program3\": \"print(\\\"No\\\")\\nbreak\"\n   }\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n For program1, the missing code is the body of the if block: we need to break.\n\n For program2, the missing code is two lines: x = i and break.\n\n For program3, the missing code is two lines: print(\"No\") and break.\n\n But note: in program3, the string in print must be \"No\", but the problem says we may print in any case? The problem says: \"print \"YES\" if ...\", but then says \"You may print each letter in any case\". However, the sample outputs in the problem are \"Yes\" and \"No\", but the problem says \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" are all recognized as positive.\n\n But the sample output in the provided code for the positive case is \"Yes\". For negative, we should be consistent? \n\n The problem does not specify the case for \"NO\", so we can print \"No\".\n\n But the sample output in the problem for the negative example is \"NO\", but the problem says any case.\n\n So we print \"No\".\n\n However, the problem in the note for program3: \n        It can be seen that for the substring t=bb, the difference ... Hence the string s is not perfectly balanced.\n        So the output should be \"NO\" or \"No\" or \"no\", etc.\n\n We'll use \"No\" to match the \"Yes\" in the else block.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   {\n        \"program1\": \"break\",\n        \"program2\": \"x = i\\nbreak\",\n        \"program3\": \"print(\\\"No\\\")\\nbreak\"\n   }\n\n But note: the program3 code has an else: print(\"Yes\") and then t-=1. The break in the for-loop will skip the else, so we only print \"No\" for the negative case.\n\n Let me write the corrected program3 for one test case:\n\n   s = input()   # say \"abb\" -> including newline? \n   d = len(set(s))   # if s has newline, then d=3 for \"abb\\n\"\n   for i in range(d, len(s)):\n        if s[i] != s[i-d]:\n            print(\"No\")\n            break\n   else:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n\n   t -= 1\n\n This is correct.\n\n However, if the string length is less than d, then the for-loop does nothing and we print \"Yes\". \n   Example: s=\"a\", d=1, then range(1,1) is empty -> prints \"Yes\". \n   But is \"a\" perfectly balanced?\n        Substrings: \n            \"a\": for triplet (t, u, v): u and v must be in s -> only 'a'. The frequency of 'a' in \"a\" is 1, and for any u,v (both 'a') the difference is 0 -> balanced.\n        So \"a\" is balanced.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nFinal output in JSON."
