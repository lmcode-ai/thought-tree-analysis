Consider the substring \"aa\": |f('a')-f('b')| in substring \"aa\" is |2-0|=2 -> not balanced -> so \"NO\" is correct. But what about \"abab\": \n   distinct count=2, length=4 -> enter else. at index 1: 'b' not in \"a\" -> skip. at index 2: 'a' in \"ab\" -> yes. w = (s[:2] * 4)[:4] = \"abab\" -> equals s -> print \"YES\". Is \"abab\" balanced? substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n        substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n        substring \"b\": okay.\n        substring \"a\": okay.\n        substring \"abab\": a:2, b:2 -> okay.\n        substring \"bab\": b:2, a:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.

Note: \"other child\" means a child that is not already infected? And the injection operation: we can choose any healthy vertex. And we can do these operations in any order? But the problem says: first spreading then injection. And we can choose which child to spread for each vertex independently.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### Program1.py\nThe problem is about counting distinct preorder strings of a perfect binary tree when we can swap children arbitrarily. The tree has `2^n - 1` nodes.\n\nThe provided code:\n- Reads `n` and then sets `N = 2**n` (so `N` is the total number of nodes? Actually, the number of nodes is `2^n - 1`, so `N` should be `2**n - 1`? But note: the code sets `N = 2**n` and then uses an array `U` of size `N`. Also, the loop runs from `N-2` down to `0`. The string `S` has `2^n-1` characters, so the array `U` of size `N` (which is `2**n`) is one more than needed? Actually, the indexing: the root is at index 0? The tree nodes are stored in an array of size `N` (which is `2**n`), but we only use indices 0 to `N-2` (since `N = 2**n` and the tree has `2**n - 1` nodes). So the last node is at index `N-2`? Actually, the tree has `2**n - 1` nodes, so we need indices 0 to `2**n - 2`? \n\nBut note: the input string `S` has `2^n-1` characters. The code uses `S[i]` for `i` from 0 to `N-2` (since `N = 2**n` and the loop goes from `N-2` down to 0). So the indices in `S` are 0-indexed for the nodes? The problem says the root is vertex 1, then left child of `x` is `2x` and right is `2x+1`. But in the array, we are storing the root at index 0? Then the left child of node at index `i` would be at `2*i+1` and right at `2*i+2`? That matches the code: `a = 2*i+1` and `b = 2*i+2`.\n\nThe idea of the solution is to compute a hash (or a canonical representation) for the subtree rooted at each node. Since we can swap children arbitrarily, the two subtrees of a node can be swapped arbitrarily. Therefore, the representation for a node should be independent of the order of the children? But note: the preorder string is defined as `s_x + f(left) + f(right)`. If we swap, we get `s_x + f(right) + f(left)`. So the two orders yield two different strings? However, we are allowed to swap arbitrarily any number of times, so for a node we can choose the order arbitrarily. Therefore, the distinct preorder strings we can get for the subtree rooted at `x` depend on whether the two children's preorder strings are the same or not.\n\nThe provided code uses an array `U` to store a hash for each node. For a leaf, it sets `U[i] = ord(S[i])`. For a non-leaf, it does:\n```\nU[i] = ord(S[i]) + 331 * min(U[a], U[b]) + 3331 * max(U[a], U[b]) + min(U[a], U[b]) ** 2\n```\nand then mod `2**104`.\n\nBut note: there is a `cnt` variable that is incremented in a condition. The condition is:\n```\nif U[a] != U[b]:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWhat should we do when the two children are different? The key is: if the two children are identical (i.e., `U[a] == U[b]`), then swapping them doesn't produce a new string. But if they are different, then swapping produces a different string? Actually, no: the problem is about counting distinct preorder strings. However, the operations allow us to swap arbitrarily at any node. Therefore, the entire tree can be rearranged arbitrarily at every node independently? But note: the operations are local and we can do any number of them. Therefore, for a node, we can choose independently the order of the two children. However, if the two subtrees are identical, then swapping doesn't change the preorder string. But if they are different, then we have two possibilities for the preorder string of the current node: one with the left subtree first and one with the right subtree first.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the number of distinct preorder strings. How do we count? The root's preorder string is fixed by the choices at every node. However, the choices at different nodes are independent. Therefore, the total number of distinct preorder strings is `2^k` where `k` is the number of nodes that have two non-identical subtrees.\n\nTherefore, the variable `cnt` should be incremented by 1 for every node that has two different subtrees (i.e., when `U[a] != U[b]`). Then the answer is `2^cnt mod 998244353`.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is:\n```\n        cnt += 1\n```\n\nBut note: we must not do anything when they are equal? So we only increment `cnt` when they are different.\n\nTherefore, the missing line for program1.py is:\n        cnt += 1\n\n### Program2.py\nThe problem is to check if a string is \"perfectly balanced\". The condition: for every non-empty substring `t` and for every two characters `u` and `v` present in the entire string `s`, the absolute difference between the frequency of `u` and `v` in `t` is at most 1.\n\nThe provided code does:\n- If the string has only one distinct character or if the string has all distinct characters (so `a == b` meaning the length equals the distinct count) then it prints \"YES\".\n- Otherwise, for each index `i` from 1 to `a-1` (where `a = len(s)`), if `s[i]` is in the prefix `s[:i]`, then it forms a string `w = (s[:i] * a)[:a]` and checks if `s == w`. If so, it prints \"YES\", else ... and then breaks.\n\nBut note: the example \"aba\" is balanced. The distinct characters are 2. The code would go to the else branch. Then for `i=1`: \n  s[1] = 'b' which is not in the prefix \"a\" -> skip.\nThen for `i=2`: \n  s[2] = 'a' is in the prefix \"ab\" -> then form `w = (s[:2] * a)[:a]` -> s[:2] is \"ab\", then `w = \"abab...\"` but we take first `a=3` -> \"aba\". Then `s == w` -> \"aba\"==\"aba\" -> YES.\n\nBut what about \"abc\"? \n  distinct count is 3, so we go to else. \n  i=1: 'b' not in \"a\" -> skip.\n  i=2: 'c' not in \"ab\" -> skip? Then we break? But then we don't print anything? Actually, the code breaks after the first occurrence of `s[i] in s[:i]` and then we break. But for \"abc\", we never enter the if condition? Then the code would break without printing? That is a problem.\n\nLooking at the note: the example \"abc\" is balanced. So we must print \"YES\". But the code as written would break the loop without printing and then what? It would go on? Actually, the code after the break would not print anything? Then we get an error.\n\nBut note: the code structure:\n```\n    else:\n        for i in range(1, a):\n            if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                if s == w:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                break\n```\n\nIf we break out of the loop without printing, then the program doesn't output anything? That is incorrect.\n\nWhat condition must hold? The problem note says that the only perfectly balanced strings are those that are of the form: a single distinct letter, or a string with all distinct letters (which is the case when `a==b` and we already handled) or periodic? Actually, the example \"aba\" is periodic with period 2.\n\nBut note: the example \"abc\" is not periodic? How do we handle \"abc\"?\n\nAfter reading the problem, we know that the condition must hold for every substring. A known solution for this problem is: \n  The string is perfectly balanced if and only if it is of one of the following forms:\n    - All characters are the same: YES.\n    - Exactly two distinct characters and they alternate: YES? But note \"aba\" is alternating, but \"abb\" is not.\n  However, the example \"abc\" has three distinct characters and is of length 3. How about the substring \"abb\"? It doesn't exist in \"abc\", but the condition must hold for every substring? The substring \"bb\" does not appear in \"abc\", so we don't require that? The condition says: for every triplet (t, u, v) such that t is a non-empty substring and u and v are characters present in s. So u and v must be in the entire string? But in the substring t, we only care about the frequency of u and v that are in the entire string? \n\nHowever, note that the entire string \"abc\" has distinct letters. The condition for the substring \"a\": \n  frequency of 'a'=1, 'b'=0, 'c'=0 -> differences: |1-0|<=1, |1-0|<=1, |0-0|<=1 -> okay.\nFor \"ab\": \n  'a':1, 'b':1, 'c':0 -> |1-1|<=1, |1-0|<=1, |1-0|<=1 -> okay.\nFor \"abc\": \n  each 1 -> okay.\nFor \"b\": \n  'b':1, others 0 -> okay.\nFor \"bc\": \n  'b':1, 'c':1 -> okay.\nFor \"c\": \n  okay.\n\nBut what about a longer string? The problem says the total length of all test cases is at most 200000. \n\nKnown solution: \n  We can note that the condition is violated if there exists a substring t and two letters u, v such that |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| >= 2. \n  It turns out that the only possible violations occur in substrings of length at most 4? Actually, in the examples, the violations are in length 2: \"bb\" in \"abb\". \n\nIn fact, a known solution for this problem (from similar problems on Codeforces) is to check for any substring of length 2 or 3 that contains at least two distinct characters and that is not \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"abc\", etc. But note: the condition must hold for all substrings. However, it is known that if a string is not perfectly balanced, then there must be a substring of length at most 4 that violates the condition? \n\nBut the constraints are high, so we need an efficient solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following known solution (from AC code for the same problem):\n\n  If the string has only one distinct character: YES.\n  Else, if the string has at least 3 distinct characters: \n      Check if the string is of the form (a permutation of three letters repeated periodically) but that is complex.\n\nBut note: the example \"abc\" is balanced. However, the example \"abac\" is not? Actually, let's check \"abac\":\n  substring \"aba\": balanced? \n  substring \"bac\": balanced? \n  substring \"abac\": \n      a:2, b:1, c:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay? \n  But what about the substring \"aba\": \n      a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay? \n  However, the substring \"ba\" is balanced? \n  But wait: the problem says the entire string must have the same set of characters? Actually, the entire string \"abac\" has characters 'a','b','c'. Now, consider the substring \"a\" (which is a single 'a'): \n      frequency of 'a'=1, 'b'=0, 'c'=0 -> differences: |1-0|<=1 -> okay.\n  But the substring \"aa\" (if it appears) would be problematic? In \"abac\", the substring \"aa\" does not appear? \n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n  Let the distinct characters in s be d. Then:\n    if d == 1: YES\n    else if d > 2: \n        if the length of s is at most 3: YES? But what about \"aab\"?\n        Actually, we can check: \n          The condition must hold for every substring. In particular, for every adjacent pair of distinct characters, they must be alternating? \n\n  However, note the known solution from the code template: \n      It breaks the loop at the first occurrence of a repeated character? Then it checks if the entire string is periodic? \n\nBut the example \"abc\" has no repeated character? So the loop runs to the end without breaking? Then we break without printing? That is a problem.\n\nWe must handle the case when the loop completes without breaking? \n\nLooking at the code structure, the loop breaks at the first repeated character. For \"abc\", there is no repeated character until the end? Then the loop completes without breaking? Then we don't print anything? \n\nWe must modify the code to handle the case when the loop doesn't break? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the known solution for this problem is:\n\n  We can check that the string is of the form: \n      s = (a permutation of the distinct characters) repeated periodically? \n  But that is not sufficient.\n\nActually, a known solution (from Codeforces submissions for problem \"Perfectly Balanced\") is:\n\n  for each distinct character, we can check the positions. Then we note that the condition is violated if there is a substring that has two of one character and zero of another? \n\nBut the constraints: total length 200000, and total over test cases 200000, so we can do O(n) per test.\n\nHowever, the provided code has a loop that breaks at the first repeated character. Then it forms a periodic string with the prefix until the first repeated character? \n\nBut the example \"abc\" has no repeated character? Then we never enter the if condition? Then we break the loop without printing? Then we must print \"YES\" for \"abc\"? \n\nBut how? We can add an else clause to the for loop? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  if we break inside the loop: we have printed either \"YES\" or we have a TODO to print \"NO\"?\n  if we don't break: then we have to print \"YES\"?\n\nBut note: the example \"abc\" is balanced, so we should print \"YES\". \n\nSo the missing code in the else branch (when `s != w`) should be to print \"NO\" and break? \n\nBut what about the case when we don't break? We must print \"YES\" then? \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, a):\n      if s[i] in s[:i]:\n          ... # then we check the periodic condition\n          break\n  else:\n      print(\"YES\")\n\nBut the current code does not have that. \n\nAlternatively, we can set a flag. But the code structure is:\n\n  else:\n      for i in range(1, a):\n          if s[i] in s[:i]:\n              w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n              if s == w:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              break\n\nWe must handle the case when the loop does not break? \n\nWe can add an `else` clause to the for loop? \n\nBut the code as written breaks after the first repeated character. So if we never break, we do nothing? \n\nWe can change the code to:\n\n  else:\n      flag = True\n      for i in range(1, a):\n          if s[i] in s[:i]:\n              w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n              if s == w:\n                  print('YES')\n                  flag = False\n                  break\n              else:\n                  print('NO')\n                  flag = False\n                  break\n      if flag:\n          print('YES')\n\nBut we are not allowed to change the existing structure? We can only fill the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  In the TODO part, we print \"NO\" and break. Then after the loop, we have to print \"YES\" if we never found a repeated character? \n\nBut the current code does not have that. \n\nLooking at the code: the loop is inside the else branch of the first condition. The problem says: the total length of all test cases is at most 200000, so we can do a loop per test case? \n\nBut note: the condition `if b == 1 or a == b` already handled the cases of one distinct character and all distinct characters? \n\nWait: the condition `a == b` means the length of the string equals the distinct count? That is, the string has no repeated character? Then we print \"YES\". \n\nBut then why do we have the for loop? \n\nActually, the condition `a == b` is true when the string has all distinct characters? Then we print \"YES\". So the for loop is only entered when the string has repeated characters and the distinct count is at least 2? \n\nBut then the example \"aba\" has distinct count 2 and length 3 -> `a != b` (3 != 2) -> so we enter the else. \n\nBut the example \"abc\" has distinct count 3 and length 3 -> then `a==b` (3==3) -> we print \"YES\" and skip the else. \n\nSo the for loop is only for strings that have repeated characters and distinct count at least 2? \n\nTherefore, the for loop is entered only when the string has at least one repeated character? \n\nThen the example \"aba\" is handled: \n   distinct count = 2, length=3 -> 2 != 3 -> enter else.\n   Then we look for the first repeated character: at index 2, the character 'a' is in the prefix \"ab\" (because the prefix is \"ab\", and 'a' is in \"ab\") -> then we form w = (s[:2] * 3)[:3] = \"abab\"[:3] = \"aba\", which equals s -> print \"YES\".\n\nThe example \"abb\": \n   distinct count=2, length=3 -> enter else.\n   at index 1: 'b' is in the prefix \"a\"? -> no.\n   at index 2: 'b' is in the prefix \"ab\" -> yes.\n   then w = (s[:2] * 3)[:3] = \"abab\"[:3] = \"aba\", but s is \"abb\", so \"abb\" != \"aba\" -> then we must print \"NO\".\n\nSo the missing code in the else branch is:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: after printing \"NO\", we break the loop and then the test case is done.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait: what about a string like \"aab\"? \n   distinct count=2, length=3 -> enter else.\n   at index 1: s[1]='a' is in s[:1]=\"a\" -> yes.\n   then w = (s[:1] * 3)[:3] = \"a\"*3 = \"aaa\", but s is \"aab\" -> \"aab\" != \"aaa\" -> then we print \"NO\". \n   But is \"aab\" balanced? \n        substring \"aa\": frequency of 'a'=2, 'b'=0 -> |2-0|=2 -> not balanced -> so \"NO\" is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"abacaba\" (which is periodic with period 4? but actually it is \"a\" repeated with other letters). \n   But the first repeated character is at index 2: s[2]='a' is in the prefix \"ab\". Then we form w = (s[:2] * 7)[:7] = \"abababab\"[:7] = \"abababa\", but the string is \"abacaba\", which is not equal -> so we print \"NO\". \n   But is \"abacaba\" balanced? \n        Consider the substring \"aa\": |f('a')-f('b')| in substring \"aa\" is |2-0|=2 -> not balanced -> so \"NO\" is correct.\n\nBut what about \"abab\": \n   distinct count=2, length=4 -> enter else.\n   at index 1: 'b' not in \"a\" -> skip.\n   at index 2: 'a' in \"ab\" -> yes.\n   w = (s[:2] * 4)[:4] = \"abab\" -> equals s -> print \"YES\". \n   Is \"abab\" balanced? \n        substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n        substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n        substring \"b\": okay.\n        substring \"a\": okay.\n        substring \"abab\": a:2, b:2 -> okay.\n        substring \"bab\": b:2, a:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n        So it is balanced.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is simply to print \"NO\".\n\nSo we write:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: after printing, we break the loop and then the test case is done.\n\n### Program3.py\nThe problem is about infecting a tree in minimal seconds. The process:\n  - Initially, all healthy.\n  - Each second: \n        Spreading: for each vertex v that has at least one child infected, you can choose at most one additional child to infect (if available) -> so if a vertex has k children, and at the start of the second some are infected, then you can infect one more? But note: the problem says \"at most one\" and \"of your choice\". So you don't have to infect one if you don't want? But we want to minimize the time, so we would always infect one? \n        Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal seconds to infect the entire tree.\n\nThe provided code:\n  - Reads test cases.\n  - For each test case, it reads the parent of vertices 2 to n. Then it uses a defaultdict `counter` to count the number of children for each parent? Actually, the input is the parent of vertex i (for i from 2 to n). Then the function `solve(a)` is called with the list of these parents.\n\nIn `solve`:\n  - It counts the frequency of each parent? Actually, `counter[ai]` for each `ai` in the list. Then `count = list(counter.values())` and then sorts it.\n\n  - Then it does:\n        for i in range(num_level):\n            count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n  - Then it sets `L=0, R=max(count)`. If `R==0`, it returns `num_level+1`.\n\n  - Then it defines a function `check(k)` that for each element in `count` (which is stored in `b`), sets `b[i] = max(b[i]-k, 0)`, and then checks if the sum of `b` is <= k.\n\n  - Then it does a binary search on `k` in the range [L, R]? But note: the while loop condition is `while R - L > 1` and then if `check(mid)` is true, we set `R=mid`, else ... and then returns `num_level+1+R`.\n\nWhat is the meaning of `num_level`? It is the length of `count`, which is the number of distinct parents? Actually, no: the `counter` counts the frequency of each parent. The distinct parents are the keys. But note: the root (vertex 1) is not in the list? The list has the parents of vertices 2 to n. The root (vertex 1) must be the parent of some children? So the root is included? \n\nBut the root is not explicitly in the list? The list `a` is the parents of vertices 2 to n. The root (vertex 1) will appear as a parent for its children. So `counter` counts the number of children for each node? Then `count` is the list of the number of children for each node that has at least one child? And `num_level` is the number of nodes that have children? \n\nBut note: the root is included? And the root might have multiple children? \n\nThe known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n  We can simulate the infection process. However, the constraints are up to 200000 per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do O(n) per test.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a greedy / DP? \n\nBut the provided code uses a binary search on `k`? \n\nWhat is the idea? \n\n  The total time is at least the depth of the tree? But note: we start at time 0? Actually, the problem says: each second we do spreading and then injection.\n\n  The known solution (from AC code) for this problem:\n\n      We can do a DFS and compute the time needed for each subtree. \n\n  However, the provided code does:\n\n      count = list of the number of children for each node (only for nodes that have children) and then sorts.\n\n      Then for each index i, it subtracts (i+2) from the count? Why?\n\n  Then it does a binary search for an extra time `k`? \n\n  The total time returned is `num_level + 1 + R`.\n\n  What is `num_level`? It is the number of nodes that have children? \n\n  The root is included? \n\n  The known solution from the note: the minimal seconds for the first test case (with 5 vertices) is 2 seconds? \n\n  The first test case: \n        n=5, and the parents: [1,1,1,2] -> meaning:\n          vertex2: parent1\n          vertex3: parent1\n          vertex4: parent1\n          vertex5: parent2\n        So the tree: \n          1 has children 2,3,4; 2 has child 5.\n\n        The count for node1: 3 children, node2: 1 child -> so count = [3,1] -> sorted: [1,3]? \n        Then num_level = 2.\n\n        Then for i=0: count[0] = max(1 - 0 - 2, 0) = max(-1,0)=0\n        for i=1: count[1] = max(3-1-2,0)=0\n        Then R=0 -> returns 2+1+0 = 3? But the example says 2 seconds? \n\n  So the provided code might be flawed? \n\n  Alternatively, the known solution from AC code for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n      We can simulate the infection as a BFS? \n\n  But the problem says: we can choose which child to infect by spreading and which vertex to inject arbitrarily.\n\n  Known solution:\n\n      We can use a DFS that returns the time needed for a subtree. \n\n      Let f(u) be the minimal time to infect the entire subtree rooted at u, starting with the root not infected (and then we have to infect the root by injection at some point, or by spreading from children?).\n\n      However, the process is global: we start with no infected, and then each second we do spreading (which can happen at any node that has at least one child infected) and then an injection.\n\n      The root can be infected by injection at time 0? But then we have to infect the entire tree.\n\n  Actually, the known solution (from AC submissions) for this problem:\n\n      We can do:\n\n          Let children = list of the children counts for each node? Then we sort in descending order? \n\n          Then we do:\n\n          def dfs(u):\n              if not children[u]:\n                  return 1\n              times = []\n              for v in children[u]:\n                  times.append(dfs(v))\n              sort times in descending order\n              for i in range(len(times)):\n                  times[i] += i   # because we can only spread one per second? \n              return max(times) + 1\n\n      But that is not exactly.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      We know that the root must be infected by injection? Or we can start by infecting the root at time 0? \n\n      Actually, we can start by infecting the root by injection at time 0. Then at time 1, we can spread from the root to one child? and then inject anywhere? \n\n      The known solution from the provided code structure:\n\n          The answer = (number of nodes that have children) + 1 + (some extra time k) \n\n          And k is found by binary search? \n\n      How does the binary search work?\n\n          We have an array `count` that is the list of the number of children for each node? Then we subtract (i+2) for the i-th element? Why i+2?\n\n          Then we set `count[i] = max(count[i] - k, 0)` and then check if the sum of the remaining `count` is <= k.\n\n          Then we want the minimal k such that the condition holds.\n\n      What is the meaning? \n\n          The `count` array after the initial subtraction (max(0, count[i]-i-2)) might represent the extra work that we have to do? \n\n      The known solution from the note: the first test case (n=5) should be 2 seconds.\n\n      How does the code compute for the first test case?\n\n          count = [3,1] (for node1 and node2) -> sorted: [1,3]? \n          Then for i=0: count[0] = max(1-0-2,0)=0\n          for i=1: count[1] = max(3-1-2,0)=0\n          Then R=0 -> returns 2+1+0 = 3.\n\n      But the expected answer is 2.\n\n      So the provided code might be for a different problem? \n\n  However, the problem statement matches: \n      \"You are given a rooted tree ... minimal seconds\"\n\n  And the sample: \n      Input: \n          5\n          1 1 1 2\n      Output: 2\n\n  So the provided code is not working for the sample.\n\n  What is the correct approach? \n\n      We can use a DFS that returns the time needed for the subtree.\n\n      Let dp[u] = the minimal seconds needed to infect the entire subtree rooted at u.\n\n      Initially, we start with no infected. We can choose to infect the root at time 0 by injection? But note: the process: \n          Second 0: \n             Spreading: nothing because no child is infected? \n             Injection: we can choose the root -> then the root is infected.\n\n          Then at second 1:\n             Spreading: from the root, we can choose to infect one child? \n             Injection: we can choose any healthy vertex? \n\n          But we want to minimize the time.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          Let children = list of children of u.\n\n          If there are no children, then we only need to infect u: \n             time = 1? (because at second 0: injection at u)\n\n          But note: the problem says the whole tree must be infected. \n\n          Actually, we can simulate:\n\n             Time 0: \n                 Injection: we infect the root -> time0: root infected.\n                 Then we are done for the root? But the root is done.\n\n          However, the problem says: we start with all healthy. Then we do the operations (spreading and injection) each second.\n\n          So for a leaf: \n             Time0: \n                 Spreading: nothing.\n                 Injection: we can choose the leaf -> infected. \n             So one second? \n\n          But the problem says: the injection operation is done after spreading? So at time0, we do spreading (nothing) and then injection (leaf). So the leaf is infected at time0? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"each second you do two operations\", so the first second (second0) does spreading and then injection? \n\n          How many seconds? The leaf is infected at the end of second0? Then the time is 1 second? \n\n          But the problem says: output the minimal number of seconds needed. \n\n          The sample: \n              n=5: \n                  vertices: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              Second0:\n                 Spreading: nothing.\n                 Injection: infect vertex1.\n\n              Then after second0: {1} infected.\n\n              Second1:\n                 Spreading: at vertex1, we have three children (2,3,4). We can choose to infect one of them, say 2.\n                 Injection: we can choose to infect vertex5? \n                 So after second1: {1,2,5} infected? \n\n              Then the whole tree is infected? So 2 seconds.\n\n          How? \n             After spreading at vertex1: we infect vertex2? \n             Then injection: we infect vertex5.\n\n          But note: the spreading operation: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread to at most one other child\". But at second1, vertex1 has no child infected at the start of the second? So we cannot spread from vertex1? \n\n          Correction: at the start of second1, the infected set is {1}. Then during spreading: \n              For vertex1: it has no infected child? so we cannot spread from vertex1? \n\n          Then how do we infect vertex2? \n\n          We must use injection at second1 to infect vertex2? and then we can also infect vertex5 by injection? But the injection operation: we can choose only one vertex per second? \n\n          The problem says: \"you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it\" (singular) -> so only one injection per second.\n\n          Therefore, at second1:\n             Spreading: nothing.\n             Injection: we choose vertex2.\n\n          Then after second1: {1,2}\n\n          Then at second2:\n             Spreading: \n                 For vertex1: it has one child (vertex2) infected, so we can spread to one more child (vertex3 or vertex4). Let's choose vertex3.\n                 For vertex2: it has a child (vertex5) not infected -> but we can only spread if at least one child is infected? none is infected -> skip.\n             Then we spread to vertex3 from vertex1.\n             Then injection: we choose vertex4? \n             Then after second2: {1,2,3,4} -> but vertex5 is not infected.\n\n          Then at second3:\n             Spreading: \n                 For vertex2: now we can spread to vertex5? \n             Then injection: we choose vertex5? -> but then we infect vertex5 twice? \n\n          Alternatively, at second2:\n             Spreading: \n                 vertex1: spread to vertex3.\n                 vertex2: cannot spread.\n             Injection: we choose vertex5.\n\n          Then we have {1,2,3,5} -> missing vertex4.\n\n          Then at second3:\n             Spreading: \n                 vertex1: has two children infected (2 and 3) -> then we can spread to vertex4? \n             Injection: we choose vertex4? -> then done.\n\n          So 4 seconds? \n\n          But the sample output is 2 seconds? \n\n          How can it be 2 seconds? \n\n          Known solution for the sample:\n\n            Second0:\n                Injection: infect vertex1.\n            Then after second0: {1}\n\n            Second1:\n                Spreading: \n                    Since vertex1 has no infected child, we cannot spread from vertex1.\n                Injection: we infect vertex2.\n\n            Then after second1: {1,2}\n\n            Now, at second2:\n                Spreading: \n                    For vertex1: it has one child (vertex2) infected, so we can spread to one more child (say vertex3).\n                    For vertex2: it has no infected child? so we cannot spread from vertex2.\n                Then we infect vertex3 by spreading from vertex1.\n                Then injection: we infect vertex4? \n                Then we have {1,2,3,4} -> missing vertex5.\n\n            Then at second3:\n                Spreading:\n                    For vertex2: now we can spread to vertex5? \n                Injection: we infect vertex5? \n                Then done in 3 seconds.\n\n          But the sample output is 2 seconds? \n\n          The sample image in the note: \n              Second0: root is infected by injection (blue).\n              Second1: \n                  Spreading: from the root, we infect one child (blue) -> then that child becomes green? \n                  Injection: we infect another child of the root (blue) -> then we have two children blue and one green? \n              Then after second1: the root is red (already infected earlier), one child is green (infected by spreading at second1), and one child is blue (infected by injection at second1). \n              Then the whole tree is infected? \n\n          But the tree has 5 vertices: root and three children and one grandchild. \n\n          How to do in 2 seconds? \n\n          Second0: \n             Infect the root (vertex1) by injection -> blue.\n\n          Second1:\n             Spreading: from the root (which has no child infected at the start of second1) -> nothing.\n             Injection: we infect one child, say vertex2.\n\n          Then after second1: {1,2}\n\n          Second2:\n             Spreading: \n                 For vertex1: it has one child (vertex2) infected, so we can spread to one more child (vertex3) -> then vertex3 becomes infected (green).\n                 For vertex2: it has one child (vertex5) -> but at the start of second2, vertex5 is not infected? so we cannot spread from vertex2? \n             Injection: we infect vertex4.\n\n          Then after second2: {1,2,3,4} -> missing vertex5.\n\n          How to get vertex5? \n\n          We must use spreading from vertex2 at second2? But at the start of second2, vertex2 has no infected child? \n\n          Alternatively, at second2 spreading: \n             For vertex1: we spread to vertex2? but vertex2 is already infected? \n             For vertex1: we spread to vertex3 and vertex4? but we can only spread one per vertex per second.\n\n          The spreading operation: for each vertex, we can spread to at most one child. So vertex1 can spread to one child (vertex3) and vertex2 can spread to vertex5? But at the start of second2, vertex2 has no infected child? so it cannot spread.\n\n          Therefore, we need at least 3 seconds.\n\n          But the sample output is 2 seconds? \n\n          There is a known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) for the sample: \n              Input: \n                  1\n                  5\n                  1 1 1 2\n              Output: 2\n\n          How? \n\n          Rethink the problem: \n            The spreading operation: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\".\n\n          Note: \"other child\" means a child that is not already infected? \n\n          And the injection operation: we can choose any healthy vertex.\n\n          And we can do these operations in any order? \n\n          But the problem says: first spreading then injection.\n\n          And we can choose which child to spread for each vertex independently.\n\n          Known solution from a Codeforces submission (C++): \n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            int t, n, p, ans;\n            vector<int> e[200050];\n            int dfs(int u) {\n                int cnt = 0;\n                for (auto v : e[u]) {\n                    cnt += dfs(v);\n                }\n                if (u == 1) return max(1, cnt);\n                if (cnt == 0) return 1;\n                return cnt;\n            }\n            int main() {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &t);\n                while (t--) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n                    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) e[i].clear();\n                    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n                        scanf(\"%d\", &p);\n                        e[p].push_back(i);\n                    }\n                    ans = dfs(1);\n                    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n                }\n            }\n\n          This outputs for the sample: \n              dfs(1): \n                  u=1: \n                     for children: [2,3,4] -> \n                         for v=2: \n                             dfs(2): \n                                 for child of 2: [5] -> \n                                     dfs(5): \n                                         no children -> returns 1.\n                                 so cnt = 1.\n                                 then for v=2: returns cnt = 1?

We must preserve the indentation.\n\n  The existing code in program1.py has 8 spaces for the if block, and then the TODO is at 8 spaces. So we output 8 spaces and then \"cnt += 1\".\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is in an else branch of an if-else inside the for loop, and it is at 16 spaces? The existing code has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at 16 spaces. We replace it with 16 spaces and then 'print(\"NO\")'.\n\n  In program3.py, the TODO is in the else branch of the binary search, at 8 spaces? The existing code:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace with 12 spaces (because the while loop is at 4 spaces, and the if-else inside is at 8 spaces, and the else branch is at 8 spaces, and then we need to indent the assignment by 4 more) -> total 12 spaces? \n\n  But the code in program3.py has:\n\n    while R - L > 1:\n        mid = (R + L) // 2\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at 12 spaces (because the while loop is 4, then the if is 8, then the else is 8, and the comment is 12?).\n\n  Actually, the code might be:\n\n    while R - L > 1:\n        mid = (R + L) // 2\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The else branch is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n  But the provided code in the problem statement for program3.py has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n  We output 12 spaces and then \"L = mid\".\n\n  But note: the code might have used tabs? We assume spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      \"program1\": \"        cnt += 1\",\n      \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\",   -> but wait, the existing code in program2.py has 16 spaces for the else branch body? \n          The structure:\n\n          for i in range(1, a):\n              if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                  w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                  if s == w:\n                      print(\"YES\")\n                  else:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The else branch is at 20 spaces? (because for: 4, if: 8, then if: 12, then else: 16? and then the comment at 20? \n\n          But the problem says: \n\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the else is at 16 spaces and the comment at 20? \n\n          We must output 20 spaces and then 'print(\"NO\")'? \n\n          But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the TODO is at the same indentation as the print(\"YES\") in the if branch? \n\n          In the if branch: \n                  if s == w:\n                      print(\"YES\")\n\n          The print(\"YES\") is at 20 spaces.\n\n          So in the else branch, we should have at 20 spaces: 'print(\"NO\")'.\n\n          Similarly, in program1.py, the TODO is at the same level as the assignment to U[i]? \n\n          The code:\n\n          if b >= N:\n              U[i] = ord(S[i])\n              continue\n          if U[a] != U[b]:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          U[i] = ord(S[i]) + ... \n\n          The TODO is at 8 spaces.\n\n          So we output at 8 spaces: 'cnt += 1'\n\n          In program3.py, the TODO is in the else branch of the if in the while loop. The if branch has:\n\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n\n          which is at 8 spaces. The else branch should have an assignment at the same level? \n\n          The TODO is at 12 spaces? That might be a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n          Let me count the spaces in the provided program3.py code:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The else branch is at 8 spaces (same as the if) and the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n          But the assignment in the if branch is at 12 spaces: \"R = mid\"\n\n          So in the else branch, we should have at 12 spaces: \"L = mid\"\n\n          Therefore, the JSON:\n\n            \"program1\": \"        cnt += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\",   # 16 spaces? but wait, the if branch print(\"YES\") is at 16 spaces? \n            \"program3\": \"            L = mid\"   # 12 spaces\n\n          How many spaces in program2.py for the print(\"YES\")? \n                if s == w:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n          The print is at 20 spaces? (because the if is at 16 spaces) -> 4 more.\n\n          The structure:\n\n            for ...:   -> 4\n                if ...: -> 8\n                    ... -> 12\n                else: -> 8\n                    ... -> 12\n\n          But in the provided code:\n\n            for i in range(1, a):\n                if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                    w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                    if s == w:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    break\n\n          The for: 4\n          the if: 8\n          the assignment to w: 12\n          the if s==w: 12\n          the print(\"YES\"): 16\n          the else: 12\n          the TODO: 16\n\n          So the TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output for program2.py: 16 spaces and then 'print(\"NO\")'\n\n          But the code already has the else: and then the TODO at 16 spaces. We replace the TODO line with the print.\n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is: \n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n          with 16 spaces.\n\n          In summary:\n\n            program1: \"        cnt += 1\"   (8 spaces)\n            program2: \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"   (16 spaces)\n            program3: \"            L = mid\"   (12 spaces)\n\n          But note: in program3.py, the else branch has the TODO at 12 spaces? and we replace with \"L = mid\" at 12 spaces.\n\n          However, the code in program3.py might be:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The else branch is at 8 spaces and the TODO is at 12 spaces. We replace the TODO line with \"            L = mid\", which is 12 spaces.\n\n          But the line after the else should be indented. So the code becomes:\n\n                else:\n                    L = mid\n\n          This is valid.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer."
