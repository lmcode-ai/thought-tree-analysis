But the current code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split()) arr = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n        st = construct(arr, m)\n\nWe are passing m (the number of columns) to `construct`, but the array has m+1 elements. We should pass m+1. But the TODO is only in the main function. We are not allowed to change that? Alternatively, we can build the segment tree for the array of length m+1 by:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m+1)\n\nAnd then in the query, we use the same call: getMax(st, m+1, min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2)) But the function getMax is defined as:\n\n        def getMax(st, n, l, r):\n            return MaxUtil(st, 0, n-1, l, r, 0) If we call with n=m+1, then the segment is [0, m] (because n-1 = m). Then we can query [min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2)] which are in the range [1, m] (valid indices). So we should change the construction to:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m+1) But then we must also change the segment tree building to use the new length. But the TODO is only in the main function. We are allowed to change only the TODO part?

The recurrence:\n\n   v[0] = 1\n   for each coin (palindrome) i from 1 to 40000:\n        if i is palindrome, then for j from i to 40001:\n             v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % mod\n\nBut the provided code has:\n\n   for i in range(1,40001):\n        if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i,40001): \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to update v[j] by adding v[j-i]. So the missing code is:\n\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the modulus g is 10**9+7. But the final output is:\n\n        print(v[int(n)]%g) We are doing modulo at the end. But we should do modulo during the update to avoid overflow. So the TODO is:\n\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the array `v` is being updated in increasing order of j? And we are iterating j from i to 40001. This is the standard way for unbounded knapsack (each coin can be used any number of times). Therefore, we output for program3:\n\n   \"program3\": \"        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\nBut note: the code has:\n\n   for i in range(1,40001):\n        if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i,40001): # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must indent properly. Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   for i in range(1,40001):\n        if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i,40001):\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut the TODO is only the inner part. So the missing code is:\n\n        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the variable for the modulus is `g`. Therefore, the final answer for program3 is:\n\n        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the code uses `g` (not `mod` or anything else). So we output:\n\n   \"program3\": \"        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\n### Summary\n\nWe output the following JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    print(\\\"NO\\\\n\\\")\\n    continue\",\n  \"program2\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += d + 1\\n        m += d\",\n  \"program3\": \"        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program1, the condition (x1<=arr[y1] or x2<=arr[y2]) should be false by the input, but we output \"NO\" and continue if it is true. In program2, we update the variables in the while loop. In program3, we update the dp array. Let me write the JSON string.",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", and \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem is about a grid with blocked cells and a robot that moves in bursts of k steps per command. We are to answer queries: given start (x1,y1), finish (x2,y2), and k, can we get the robot from start to finish?\n\nThe provided code already has:\n  - A segment tree to get the maximum blocked height in a range of columns.\n  - The main loop that reads the queries.\n\nThe missing part is in the condition after checking if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]). However, note that the input specification says the start and finish cells are unblocked, so this condition should not be triggered by the input. But the code checks it. Actually, the condition is written as:\n    if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]):\nBut the input specification states: \n    \"a[y_s] < x_s <= n\" and similarly for the finish.\n\nSo this condition should never be true? However, we must be cautious: the array `arr` is 1-indexed (because `arr = [0] + ...`). The condition is checking if the start or finish cell is blocked? But the input says they are unblocked. Therefore, if we get a query that violates the input condition, we should output \"NO\". However, the problem states: \"The start and the finish cell of each query are unblocked.\" So we can assume that condition is always false? But the code has a TODO there.\n\nActually, the condition is written to check if the start or finish is blocked? But note: the condition is `x1 <= arr[y1]` which would mean the start row is at or below the blocked height (which is blocked). But the input says `a[y_s] < x_s`. So we know that `x1 > arr[y1]` and `x2 > arr[y2]`. Therefore, the condition `(x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2])` will always be false. So we can remove that condition? Or we can leave it as a safeguard? \n\nBut the problem says: \"The start and the finish cell of each query are unblocked.\" So we can skip that condition? However, the code has a TODO. Let me read the code again:\n\n    if ((y2 - y1) % k != 0 or (x2 - x1) % k != 0):\n        print(\"NO\\n\")\n        continue\n    if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the condition for the differences modulo k: \n  (y2 - y1) % k != 0 or (x2 - x1) % k != 0\n\nBut note: the robot moves in multiples of k. However, the movement in the horizontal direction (columns) must be a multiple of k? Actually, the robot can move in any direction (up, right, down, left). But note: the problem says the robot executes each command k times. So if we want to move from y1 to y2, the difference in columns must be a multiple of k? Actually, we can break the movement into multiple commands. However, the problem says we can send an arbitrary number of commands. But note: the robot does each command k times. So to move horizontally, we can only move in multiples of k. Similarly for vertical.\n\nBut wait: we can use multiple commands. For example, to move 2k to the right, we can send two commands: one right (which moves k right) and then another right (which moves k right). But note: we can also move in other directions to compensate? However, the problem does not require the path to be direct.\n\nBut note: the condition in the code: \n    if ((y2 - y1) % k != 0 or (x2 - x1) % k != 0):\n\nThis condition is checking the entire displacement? That is not correct. For example, we can move right and then left to adjust the row? Actually, the displacement in the vertical direction (rows) is independent of the horizontal? However, the robot can only move in four directions. The key is: we can break the movement arbitrarily. But note that the robot must end at the finish. The net displacement in the horizontal direction is (y2 - y1) and in the vertical direction is (x2 - x1). However, we can achieve any net displacement that is a linear combination of k steps? But note: we can only use multiples of k in each direction? Actually, we can use multiple commands. For example, to move 3k to the right, we use three right commands. But what if we want to move 2? We cannot move 2 if k=3? So the net displacement in each direction must be a multiple of k? \n\nBut wait: we can also use negative moves? For example, to move 2 to the right when k=3: we can do right (moves 3 right), then left (moves 3 left) and then right again (moves 3 right) and then left (moves 3 left) ... that doesn't help. Actually, we cannot move a net displacement that is not a multiple of k? Because each command moves k steps. So the net displacement in the horizontal direction must be a multiple of k? Similarly for vertical? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require the movement to be only in one direction. We can use a combination of up, down, left, right. However, the net displacement in the horizontal direction (columns) is (y2 - y1) and in the vertical direction (rows) is (x2 - x1). And each command we send is either horizontal or vertical? And each command moves k steps in one direction. Therefore, the net displacement in the horizontal direction must be a multiple of k? And similarly for vertical? \n\nBut that is not true: we can use a sequence of commands that move in different directions. However, the net displacement in the horizontal direction is the number of right commands minus the number of left commands, multiplied by k. So (right_commands - left_commands) * k = y2 - y1. Therefore, (y2 - y1) must be divisible by k? Similarly, (x2 - x1) must be divisible by k? \n\nBut wait: what if k=0? The problem says k>=1. So the condition in the code is correct: if either (y2-y1) is not divisible by k or (x2-x1) is not divisible by k, then we output \"NO\".\n\nNow, the next condition: \n    if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nAs argued, the input guarantees that the start and finish are unblocked, so this condition should be false. Therefore, we can skip it? But the code has a TODO. Actually, the condition is written as `x1 <= arr[y1]` which would be true if the start is blocked. But the input says it is not. So we can output \"NO\" in that case? Because the start or finish is blocked? But the input says they are unblocked. So we don't expect to get such a query. However, to be safe, we can output \"NO\" and continue.\n\nSo the TODO part should be:\n    print(\"NO\\n\")\n    continue\n\nBut wait: the problem says the start and finish are unblocked. So we can assume that condition is always false? Then we don't need to do anything? But the code has an if condition that does nothing? That would be a bug. Actually, the condition is written as:\n    if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must complete the TODO. Since the input guarantees that the start and finish are unblocked, we should never enter this branch. But if we do, we should output \"NO\". So:\n\n    if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]):\n        print(\"NO\\n\")\n        continue\n\nBut note: the array `arr` is 1-indexed. The start column is y1, and we have `arr[y1]` which is the blocked height for column y1. The condition `x1 <= arr[y1]` means the start cell is blocked? But the input says `a[y_s] < x_s`. So we have `x1 > arr[y1]` and similarly for the finish. Therefore, the condition `x1 <= arr[y1]` is false. So we don't enter the if. So we don't need to do anything? Then why is there a TODO? \n\nAlternatively, the condition might be a typo? The problem says the start cell must be unblocked: so `x1 > arr[y1]`. Therefore, the condition `x1 <= arr[y1]` is false. Similarly for the finish. So the entire condition is false. Therefore, we can remove the condition? Or we can leave it as a safeguard and output \"NO\" if by any chance we get a blocked cell? \n\nGiven the constraints, we should output \"NO\" if the start or finish is blocked. So the TODO is:\n\n    print(\"NO\\n\")\n    continue\n\nBut note: the condition above already checks the divisibility by k. So the code becomes:\n\n    if ((y2 - y1) % k != 0 or (x2 - x1) % k != 0):\n        print(\"NO\\n\")\n        continue\n    if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]):\n        print(\"NO\\n\")\n        continue\n\nHowever, the problem states the start and finish are unblocked, so the second condition should never be true. But it's safe to include.\n\nNow, the next part:\n\n    max_x = ((n-x1)//k)*k + x1 \n    if (max_x <= getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2))):\n        print(\"NO\\n\")\n        continue\n    print(\"YES\\n\")\n\nWhat is `max_x`? It is the highest row the robot can reach in the start column (or any column) without going above row n? The robot can move up arbitrarily as long as it doesn't hit the blocked cells or go above n. But note: we can use the up command to move up by multiples of k. The maximum row we can reach in the start column is: we can do `t` up commands (each moves k up) so the row becomes: x1 + t * k. We require that the row does not exceed n. So the maximum t is floor((n - x1) / k). Then the maximum row we can reach is x1 + k * floor((n-x1)/k) = ((n-x1)//k)*k + x1.\n\nBut why do we need this? Because when moving horizontally from y1 to y2, we must avoid the blocked cells. The robot must pass through the columns between y1 and y2. The segment tree gives the maximum blocked height in the range [min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2)]. Let M = getMax(st, m, min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2)). The robot must have a row in that range that is above M. But note: we can adjust the vertical position arbitrarily? However, we start at x1 and we can only change the vertical position by multiples of k. So we must have a row that is above M and that is congruent to x1 modulo k? And also that row must be at most n.\n\nBut note: we can also go down? However, going down might lead to hitting the blocked cells? And we start at x1 which is above the blocked cells. But we can go down as long as we don't go below the blocked cells? Actually, the blocked cells are from row 1 to arr[i] in column i. So we can go down? But if we go down, we might go below the blocked cells? Actually, we can only go down if we have room above the blocked cells? But the problem does not restrict the path to be nonnegative? \n\nHowever, the key is: we can avoid the blocked cells by going above them. The idea is: we can climb to a high enough row (above the maximum blocked cell in the entire path) and then move horizontally. Then we can come down to the finish. But we can only change the row by multiples of k. So we need a row that is above M and that is reachable from both x1 and x2. \n\nSpecifically, we can climb to a row R such that:\n   R >= M+1\n   R is reachable from x1: that is, R = x1 + t1 * k (with t1>=0) and R <= n.\n   Similarly, from R we can come down to x2: that is, R = x2 + t2 * k (with t2>=0) but wait: we need to go down? Then we would use down commands. So R must be at least x2? Actually, we can also go up from x2? But we need to end at x2. So we must have R = x2 + t2 * k? That would require going down? Actually, we can use negative t? But we can only use nonnegative multiples? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: we can adjust the vertical position arbitrarily as long as the row is above the blocked cells and we have the same residue modulo k? But note: we can also use down commands to reduce the row. So from x1, we can go to any row that is: x1 mod k and that is at least ...? Actually, we can go to any row that is in the set { x1 + t * k : t is an integer } and that is between [arr[i]+1, n] for the columns we traverse? But we are constrained by the maximum blocked cell M: we must be above M.\n\nBut the code uses:\n\n    max_x = ((n-x1)//k)*k + x1 \n\nThis is the maximum row we can reach from x1 without exceeding n. Then we check if this max_x is <= M. If it is, then we cannot get above M? Then we cannot avoid the blocked cells? So we output \"NO\". Otherwise, we can.\n\nBut note: we don't necessarily have to go to max_x. We only need to go above M. So we need at least one row R such that:\n   R > M\n   R \u2261 x1 (mod k)   [so that we can get there from x1 by moving up (or down? but we can only move up to increase the row? and we can also move down? but moving down might lead to blocked cells?]\n\nHowever, we can also move down? But moving down from x1: we can go to x1 - k, x1 - 2k, ... as long as we don't go below the blocked cells? But the blocked cells in the start column are from 1 to arr[y1]. Since we start at x1>arr[y1], we can move down to any row above arr[y1] that is \u2261 x1 mod k? But the problem is: when moving through other columns, we must avoid the blocked cells. The critical point is the maximum blocked cell M in the entire path (from min(y1,y2) to max(y1,y2)). We must have a row R that is above M and that is \u2261 x1 mod k? And also R must be at most n? And also we must be able to get from R to x2? \n\nBut note: the residue condition for x2: we require that (R - x2) is divisible by k? But we don't require that? Actually, we can adjust the vertical position arbitrarily at the finish? We can use commands to go from R to x2? The net change in row from R to x2 is (x2 - R). This must be a multiple of k? But we can use multiple commands: for example, if we are at R and we want to go to x2, we can use down commands (each moves k down) and then adjust? But note: we can also use up commands? Actually, we can only move in multiples of k. So the net change must be a multiple of k? Therefore, we require (R - x2) is divisible by k? \n\nBut wait: we have already checked that (x2 - x1) is divisible by k? And R \u2261 x1 (mod k). Then R \u2261 x2 (mod k). So the condition is automatically satisfied? \n\nTherefore, the only constraint is: we must be able to get above M. The highest row we can reach from x1 is max_x = x1 + k * floor((n-x1)/k). If max_x > M, then we can use that row to avoid the blocked cells? But we don't need the maximum row, we just need one row above M that is \u2261 x1 mod k. The smallest such row above M is: \n   Let r = x1 mod k. Then we need the smallest number >= M+1 that is \u2261 r mod k.\n   That is: base = M+1\n   Then candidate = base + ( (r - base % k) % k )   [but modulo arithmetic is tricky]\n\nAlternatively, we can compute: \n   candidate = M+1\n   remainder = (M+1) % k\n   We want to adjust to r? \n   candidate += (r - remainder) % k   [if negative, add k and mod?]\n\nBut note: we can also use: \n   candidate = M+1 + ( (r - (M+1) % k + k) % k )\n\nBut if (M+1) % k <= r, then we add (r - (M+1)%k). Otherwise, we add (r - (M+1)%k + k).\n\nBut note: the code does not do that. The code uses the maximum row we can reach. Why? Because if the maximum row we can reach is above M, then we can definitely get above M? And since the maximum row is \u2261 x1 mod k, then we can use that row? \n\nBut what if the maximum row is above M, then we are safe. However, if the maximum row is <= M, then we cannot get above M? \n\nBut note: we might not need to go to the maximum row? We only need to go to a row above M. However, if the maximum row we can reach is <= M, then we cannot get above M? Therefore, the condition in the code is correct.\n\nBut wait: what if we can go down? Then we might not need to go up? For example, if the entire path has blocked cells only at the bottom, and we are starting at a high row, and the maximum blocked cell M is low, then we don't need to go up? We can just stay at our current row? \n\nBut note: the condition in the code for the segment tree query: we are getting the maximum blocked cell in the columns between y1 and y2. We must be above that maximum. So if we are already above M, then we don't need to go up? Then we don't need to use the maximum row? \n\nBut the code uses:\n\n    max_x = ((n-x1)//k)*k + x1 \n\nThis is the maximum row we can reach from x1. But we don't require to go to the maximum row. We only require that there exists a row R such that R>M and R\u2261x1 mod k and R<=n. The condition in the code is:\n\n    if (max_x <= getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2))):\n        print(\"NO\\n\")\n        continue\n\nThis condition says: if the maximum row we can reach is still <= M, then we cannot avoid the blocked cells? But what if we are already above M? Then we don't need to go up? Then we don't need to use the maximum row? \n\nFor example, if x1 > M, then we are already above the maximum blocked cell. Then we don't need to move vertically? But note: we have already checked that (x2-x1) is divisible by k? So if we are already above M, and we don't need to move vertically? Actually, we might need to move vertically to avoid the blocked cells in other columns? But we are already above M? Then we can move horizontally? \n\nBut the condition in the code only checks the maximum row we can reach? It does not check if we are already above M. \n\nSo we must change the condition: we need to know if there exists a row R such that R>M and R\u2261x1 mod k and R<=n. The maximum row we can reach (max_x) is the highest row we can get to. But we don't require the highest. We require at least one row above M that is \u2261 x1 mod k. \n\nHow to check that? \n   We know that the rows that are \u2261 x1 mod k and above x1 are: x1, x1+k, x1+2k, ... up to max_x.\n   The condition is: the smallest row in this sequence that is above M is <= n? But we know max_x is the largest. We need to know if there is at least one row above M. \n\nThe smallest row above M is: \n   Let base = M+1\n   Then the smallest row R >= base that is \u2261 x1 mod k is:\n        R = base + ((x1 - base) % k + k) % k   [but careful: base might be below x1?]\n\nAlternatively, we can compute: \n   Let rem = x1 % k\n   We need the smallest number >= base that is \u2261 rem mod k.\n\n   candidate = base + (rem - base % k + k) % k\n\nBut note: base % k = (M+1) % k.\n\nThen we require candidate <= n? \n\nBut the code uses a simpler idea: if the maximum row we can reach (max_x) is above M, then we are safe. Because if max_x>M, then there is at least one row (namely max_x) that is above M and \u2261 x1 mod k. \n\nBut what if max_x is above M? Then we are safe. If max_x<=M, then we cannot get above M? \n\nBut note: what if we are already above M? Then we don't need to go up? Then we don't need to use max_x? But the condition max_x<=M would be true? Then we output \"NO\", which is wrong.\n\nExample: \n   n=10, M=5, x1=6, k=3 -> max_x = 6 + 3*floor((10-6)/3)=6+3*1=9 -> 9>5 -> safe -> YES.\n\nBut what if x1=6, M=8? Then max_x=9>8 -> safe -> YES.\n\nBut what if x1=6, M=9? Then max_x=9<=9? Then we output \"NO\". But wait: we are already at 6? We don't need to go to 9? But we must avoid the blocked cells? The blocked cells in the path go up to 9. So we must be above 9? Then we need at least 10. But max_x=9, so we cannot go to 10? Then we cannot avoid the blocked cell? So we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\nBut what if we are already above M? For example, x1=10, M=9, k=3 -> then max_x = 10 (because (10-10)//3 = 0, so 0*3+10=10). Then 10>9 -> safe -> YES.\n\nBut what if x1=10, M=10? Then max_x=10<=10 -> output \"NO\", which is correct because we must be above 10? Actually, we must be above M, meaning at least M+1. So M=10 means we need row>=11. But we cannot go above 10? So we output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the condition is: if the maximum row we can reach (which is the highest row <=n that is \u2261x1 mod k) is <= M, then we cannot avoid the blocked cells? Then we output \"NO\". Otherwise, we can.\n\nBut note: the condition in the code is:\n\n    if (max_x <= getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2))):\n        print(\"NO\\n\")\n        continue\n\nSo we are comparing max_x (which is the maximum row we can reach) with M (the maximum blocked cell in the columns between y1 and y2). If max_x <= M, then we cannot avoid the blocked cells? Then we output \"NO\". Otherwise, we output \"YES\".\n\nBut note: the segment tree function `getMax` returns the maximum value in the array for the columns from min(y1,y2) to max(y1,y2). And we stored the blocked heights in `arr` (1-indexed). So that is M.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait: the segment tree was built for the array `arr` of length m (columns). The segment tree is built for indices 0 to m-1? But note: our `arr` is 1-indexed: \n   arr = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\nThen we call `construct(arr, m)`. The function `construct` does:\n\n   st = construct(arr, m)\n   and inside construct:\n        x = ceil(log(n,2))   # n is m? \n        ... and then construct2(arr, 0, n-1, st, 0)   # n is m? \n\nBut the function `construct` is called with `n = m`. Then `construct2` is called with `ss=0, se=m-1`. So the segment tree is built for the array `arr[0..m]`? But note: we have m columns, and we stored the blocked heights in arr[1..m]. The segment tree is built for indices 0 to m-1? Then when we query from min(y1,y2) to max(y1,y2), we are querying the indices [y1, y2]? But our array `arr` for column i is at index i? And we built the segment tree for indices 0 to m-1? Then we should query from min(y1,y2) to max(y1,y2) but note: our columns are from 1 to m. \n\nIn the segment tree, the array passed to `construct2` is `arr` and the segment tree is built for the subarray `arr[0..m-1]`. But our `arr` has indices 0..m (with index0=0, and then the given array at indices1..m). So when we built the segment tree for indices 0 to m-1, we are including arr[0] (which is 0) and then arr[1] to arr[m-1]? But we have m columns, so we should build for indices 1 to m? \n\nActually, the code for the segment tree might be built for the array of length m, but the array `arr` has m+1 elements (index0..m). The segment tree is built for the segment [0, m-1]. That means it uses the elements arr[0] to arr[m-1]. But we want the columns 1 to m? Then we should build the segment tree for indices 1 to m? \n\nBut the code does:\n\n   arr = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]   # now arr[0]=0, arr[1]=a1, ... arr[m]=a_m\n   st = construct(arr, m)   # we pass m (the number of columns)\n\nThen in `construct`:\n\n   st = [0]*(max_size)\n   construct2(arr, 0, n-1, st, 0)   # n is m -> so from 0 to m-1.\n\nBut we want the segment tree for the columns 1 to m? Then we should build from 1 to m? \n\nThis is a bug. We should build the segment tree for indices 1 to m. But the code builds for 0 to m-1. Then when we query for columns [y1, y2] (which are from 1 to m), we are actually querying the wrong indices? \n\nFor example, column 1 is at index1 in arr, but in the segment tree we built for indices0..m-1, the element at index0 is arr[0]=0, and the element at index1 is arr[1] (which is a1). So when we query [min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2)] (which are column indices from 1 to m), we should map them to the segment tree indices? \n\nBut note: the segment tree was built for the array of m elements: the first element (index0) is arr[0] (which is 0) and the last (index m-1) is arr[m-1]. But we have m columns: the blocked heights are in arr[1] to arr[m]. So the segment tree should be built for the array `arr[1..m]`. \n\nTherefore, we should change the construction? But the problem says the array `arr` has m integers. We stored them at indices 1..m. Then we built the segment tree for indices0..m-1, which corresponds to arr[0] to arr[m-1]. But we want arr[1] to arr[m]. \n\nSo we have two options:\n   Option 1: build the segment tree for the array `arr[1..m]` by calling `construct2(arr, 1, m, st, 0)`. \n   Option 2: when querying, we query from min(y1,y2)-1 to max(y1,y2)-1? \n\nBut the code currently in `getMax`:\n\n   return MaxUtil(st, 0, n-1, l, r, 0)   # n is m, so the segment is [0, m-1]\n\nAnd we call `getMax(st, m, min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2))`. \n\nWe want to query the columns from min(y1,y2) to max(y1,y2). The blocked height for column i is in arr[i]. In the segment tree, the element at index i-1 is arr[i]? Because our arr has:\n   index0: 0\n   index1: a1\n   index2: a2\n   ... index m: a_m\n\nBut the segment tree was built for indices0..m-1, so:\n   segment_tree_index0 corresponds to arr[0] (which is 0, not a1)\n   segment_tree_index1 corresponds to arr[1] (which is a1)\n   ... segment_tree_index m-1 corresponds to arr[m-1] (which is a_{m-1}) -> but we don't have a_m in the segment tree? \n\nWe built the segment tree for the first m elements of arr? But we have m+1 elements. We built for the first m? Then we missed the last element? \n\nThis is a bug. We should build the segment tree for the array of the blocked heights of the m columns, which are in arr[1] to arr[m]. Therefore, we should build the segment tree for the subarray arr[1..m]. \n\nBut the code currently builds for arr[0..m-1]. \n\nWe can fix this by building the segment tree for the array `arr[1:]` (i.e., from index1 to index m). Then the segment tree should be built for the segment [1, m]? But the segment tree code we have is built for contiguous arrays. \n\nAlternatively, we can change the way we build the segment tree: \n\n   In main: \n        arr = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n        # We want the segment tree for arr[1..m] (which has m elements)\n        st = construct(arr[1:], m)   # pass the array without the first element (the 0)\n\nBut then the segment tree is built for the array of m elements: the first element is a1, the last is a_m.\n\nBut the current segment tree building function `construct` uses the array and the length. So we can do:\n\n        st = construct(arr[1:], m)\n\nBut then in the segment tree, the index for column i (which is from 1 to m) is at position i-1 in the array we passed? \n\nThen when we query for columns from min(y1,y2) to max(y1,y2), we need to convert the column indices to array indices: from min(y1,y2)-1 to max(y1,y2)-1.\n\nBut the current call to getMax is:\n\n        getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2))\n\nWe should change it to:\n\n        getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2)-1, max(y1, y2)-1)\n\nBut note: the segment tree we built is for an array of m elements (indices0..m-1) and the element at index0 is a1, index1 is a2, ... index m-1 is a_m.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave the array as is and build the segment tree for indices1..m? But the segment tree building function `construct2` is written for a contiguous array. We can call:\n\n        construct2(arr, 1, m, st, 0)\n\nBut then the segment tree is built for indices1..m. Then when we query, we use l and r in the range [1, m]. \n\nBut the current `getMax` function uses:\n\n        return MaxUtil(st, 0, n-1, l, r, 0)   # here n is m, so the segment is [0, m-1]\n\nWe would need to change the segment tree to represent the segment [1, m]. \n\nGiven the time, and since the problem constraints are high, we must fix the segment tree to cover the correct range.\n\nBut the problem says: the total number of columns m is up to 200,000, and the number of queries is up to 200,000. \n\nWe have two options:\n\nOption 1: \n   Change the construction to use the array without the first element.\n\n   In main:\n        n, m = ... \n        arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]   # now arr has m elements: a1 to a_m\n        # But note: the columns are 1-indexed. The start column y1 is between 1 and m.\n        # Build segment tree for this arr (which has m elements, index0 to m-1)\n        st = construct(arr, m)\n\n   Then in the query:\n        M = getMax(st, m, min(y1,y2)-1, max(y1,y2)-1)\n\nOption 2: \n   Keep the array as [0] + ... and build the segment tree for indices1..m.\n\n   In main:\n        n, m = ...\n        arr = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n        # Build segment tree for the segment [1, m] of the array `arr`\n        st = construct(arr, m)   # but we will change the construct function to build for [1, m]?\n\n   But the construct function currently builds for [0, m-1]. We can change the call to:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m, start=1)\n\n   But we don't have that.\n\nGiven the provided code, it's easier to do Option 1. But the code already has the array as [0] + ... \n\nAlternatively, we can adjust the segment tree building to use the entire array but then query the correct indices. \n\nBut the segment tree building function `construct2` is written for a contiguous array from ss to se. We can build the segment tree for the segment [1, m] by:\n\n        st = construct2(arr, 1, m, st, 0)\n\nBut then the segment tree function `construct` must be changed. \n\nBut the problem says: we can only output the missing code? And the missing code is only in the TODO block? \n\nBut the TODO block is only in the main function. We are not allowed to change other parts? \n\nTherefore, we must use the segment tree as it is. And the segment tree is built for the array `arr` from index0 to index m-1. But our `arr` has m+1 elements: index0 (0) and then a1 to a_m at indices1..m. \n\nSo the segment tree currently covers:\n   index0: arr[0] = 0\n   index1: arr[1] = a1\n   ... index m-1: arr[m-1] = a_{m-1}\n\nBut we are missing a_m? \n\nThis is a bug. We must include a_m. \n\nTo fix this, we should build the segment tree for the entire array of m+1 elements? But then the segment tree would cover indices0..m. Then we would call:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m+1)\n\nBut then the segment tree is built for indices0..m. Then when we query for columns from y1 to y2, we use the indices y1 and y2 (because column i is at index i in arr). \n\nBut the current call to construct is:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m)\n\nWe pass m, but the array has m+1 elements. We should pass m+1? \n\nBut the segment tree building function `construct` uses the length n to build a segment tree for indices0..n-1. So if we want to cover indices0..m, we need n = m+1.\n\nSo we can change:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m+1)\n\nThen the segment tree is built for indices0..m. Then when we query for columns from min(y1,y2) to max(y1,y2), we use these indices directly? \n\nBut note: the blocked height for column i is at arr[i]. So for column y1, we use index=y1. \n\nThen the query: getMax(st, m+1, min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2))\n\nBut the current call is:\n\n        getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2))\n\nWe would need to change that to m+1.\n\nBut we are not allowed to change the entire program? Only the TODO part? \n\nGiven the constraints, and since the problem says we can only output the missing code, we must assume that the segment tree is built correctly for the array `arr` of length m+1 (indices0..m) and that the segment tree function `construct` is called with n=m+1. \n\nBut the current code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n        st = construct(arr, m)\n\nWe are passing m (the number of columns) to `construct`, but the array has m+1 elements. We should pass m+1. \n\nBut the TODO is only in the main function. We are not allowed to change that? \n\nAlternatively, we can build the segment tree for the array of length m+1 by:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m+1)\n\nAnd then in the query, we use the same call: getMax(st, m+1, min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2))\n\nBut the function getMax is defined as:\n\n        def getMax(st, n, l, r):\n            return MaxUtil(st, 0, n-1, l, r, 0)\n\nIf we call with n=m+1, then the segment is [0, m] (because n-1 = m). Then we can query [min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2)] which are in the range [1, m] (valid indices).\n\nSo we should change the construction to:\n\n        st = construct(arr, m+1)\n\nBut then we must also change the segment tree building to use the new length. \n\nBut the TODO is only in the main function. We are allowed to change only the TODO part? \n\nThe TODO part is only the block under:\n\n    if (x1 <= arr[y1] or x2 <= arr[y2]):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are not allowed to change other parts? \n\nTherefore, we must live with the current segment tree that is built for indices0..m-1. Then the element for column i (where i from 1 to m) is at index i-1 in the segment tree. \n\nSo when we query, we should query from min(y1,y2)-1 to max(y1,y2)-1. \n\nBut the current call is:\n\n        getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2))\n\nWe should change it to:\n\n        getMax(st, m, min(y1, y2)-1, max(y1, y2)-1)\n\nBut again, we cannot change that because it's outside the TODO. \n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem says we can only output the missing code, we must assume that the segment tree is built correctly for the array of the m columns (without the leading 0) and that the indices in the segment tree correspond to the columns. \n\nBut the code provided for the segment tree might be correct if we consider that the array passed to the segment tree is the entire `arr` (including the 0) and we built for indices0..m-1. Then the blocked height for column i is at index i in the array `arr`, but in the segment tree, the index for column i is i-1? \n\nThen when we query for [min(y1,y2), max(y1,y2)], we are actually querying the wrong indices. \n\nThis is a bug in the provided code. But the problem says we can only fill in the TODO. Therefore, we must output the missing code for the TODO block as:\n\n    print(\"NO\\n\")\n    continue\n\nAnd hope that the segment tree is built correctly for the array including the 0 and that the indices in the query are correct? \n\nBut the segment tree is built for the array `arr` of length m+1 (indices0..m) but only for the first m elements (0..m-1). So the last column (column m) is not included? \n\nThis will cause an error for queries involving column m.\n\nGiven the time, and since the problem says the start and finish are unblocked, and the TODO block is only a safeguard, we will output for program1 the following missing code:\n\n    print(\"NO\\n\")\n    continue\n\nBut note: the condition (x1<=arr[y1] or x2<=arr[y2]) should be false, so we might never enter it. So it might not be tested.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended the segment tree to be built for the array without the leading 0 and for indices0..m-1, and then the column i is at index i-1. And the query is for [min(y1,y2)-1, max(y1,y2)-1]. But the code does not do that. \n\nBut the TODO block is the only missing part. So we output for program1:\n\n    \"program1\": \"    print(\\\"NO\\\\n\\\")\\n    continue\"\n\n### program2.py\nThe problem: minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\nWe are given an array. We can do:\n   Operation1: clone any array.\n   Operation2: swap two elements from any two copies (maybe the same) at any positions.\n\nWe need the minimal number of operations to get at least one copy with all elements equal.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n   from collections import*\n   for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n        while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n        print(r)\n\nWe have:\n   m = maximum frequency of any element in the array.\n\n   Then while m < n, we do something and increment r.\n\n   Finally, print r.\n\nWhat is the idea? \n   We start with one copy.\n   We can clone to get more copies, and then swap to gather one element in one copy.\n\n   In the example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (for 0 and 3) initially.\n\n   Operations:\n        Operation1: clone -> now we have two copies.\n        Then we can swap: \n            swap the 1 in the first copy with a 0 in the second copy? \n            Then the first copy becomes [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> still not all equal.\n        Then Operation1 again: clone the first copy -> now three copies.\n        Then swap: swap the 3 and 7 in the first copy with 0's from the second and third copies.\n\n   How to count minimally?\n\n   Insight: \n        Let f be the frequency of the most common element. We want to gather n copies of that element in one array. \n        We start with f copies of that element in one array. \n        We can use other arrays to provide more copies of that element? \n\n        Steps:\n          - We can clone the array (operation1) to get more arrays. \n          - Then we can swap elements between arrays: we can take a desired element from a donor array and put it in the target array, and in return we put a non-desired element in the donor array.\n\n        Each swap (operation2) can at most provide one additional desired element in the target array? \n\n        But note: after a swap, the donor array loses one desired element. So we need to have extra desired elements in other arrays to compensate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think greedily:\n\n          Let r be the number of operations.\n\n          We start with one array and we want to have one array with all elements equal.\n\n          We can do:\n             Operation1: clone -> now we have 2 arrays. Then we can do up to 1 swap: because we can swap between the two arrays. This can give us one additional desired element in the target array? But not necessarily: we might swap a desired element from the target array to the other array? \n\n          Instead, consider:\n\n             We start with one array. We have m desired elements in it.\n\n             We need n - m more desired elements.\n\n             How do we get them? We can use other arrays to provide them. But we have to preserve the desired elements we already have.\n\n             Each clone operation (operation1) costs 1 and produces one more array. Then from that array, we can swap a desired element to the target array, but then we leave a hole in the donor array (which we don care about). \n\n             However, we can use one donor array to provide multiple desired elements? But after we take one desired element, the donor array has one less. And if we want to take another, we might need to clone again? \n\n          Actually, after we clone, we have two arrays. Then we can do multiple swaps? But each swap is one operation.\n\n          But note: the example took 6 operations.\n\n          Another example: [1,2,3] and we want [1,1,1]. \n             We have m=1.\n             Steps:\n                Operation1: clone -> two copies: [1,2,3] and [1,2,3]\n                Operation2: swap the 2 in the first copy with the 1 in the second copy at position0? -> then first copy: [1,1,3], second: [2,2,3]\n                Operation1: clone the first copy -> three copies: [1,1,3], [1,1,3], [2,2,3]\n                Operation2: swap the 3 in the first copy with the 1 in the second copy at position0? -> first: [1,1,1], second: [3,1,3] -> done.\n\n             Total operations: 2 (clone) + 2 (swap) = 4.\n\n          How to generalize:\n\n             We start with one array. \n             Let r = 0.\n             We have m (the frequency of the most common element).\n\n             We need to acquire n - m more of that element.\n\n             Each clone operation gives us a new array that has at least m occurrences of the element? Actually, initially the new array is identical, so it also has m occurrences.\n\n             But when we swap, we take one occurrence of the desired element from the donor array and put it in the target array, and we put a non-desired element in the donor array. This reduces the count of desired elements in the donor array by one. \n\n             However, we can use one donor array for multiple swaps? Only if it has multiple desired elements. But after we take one, it has m-1. We can take up to m-1 from one donor array.\n\n             But note: we might have multiple donor arrays.\n\n             The process:\n\n                Operation1: clone -> cost 1, now we have 2 arrays. Then we can do up to m swaps (because the donor array has m desired elements) but wait, we only need one swap to get one more desired element in the target array. But after one swap, the donor array has m-1 desired elements, and the target array has m+1.\n\n                Then we can clone again (operation1, cost 1) to get a third array (which has m-1 desired elements) and then swap from the third array to the target array? But the third array has m-1, so we can take one.\n\n             Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Let r = 0, and let current = m.\n                We need to get to n.\n\n                Each clone operation (cost 1) gives us a new array that has at least some desired elements. But initially, every array we clone has the same composition.\n\n                After we have (s+1) arrays (including the original), we can do up to s * m swaps? But not exactly.\n\n             Insight from known solutions to this problem: \n                 The minimal number of operations is:\n                    Let f = max frequency.\n                    Then we start with f.\n                    We can do:\n                         operations = 0\n                         while f < n:\n                             # We can use one operation to clone, then we can swap up to f times (because we have f copies of the desired element in the new clone) but note: after swapping, the donor array becomes degraded.\n                             # Actually, after a clone, we have two arrays: the target and the donor. We can swap from the donor to the target. Each swap gives one more in the target. But we can do at most f swaps from the donor (because it has f) but then the donor becomes f-1? \n                             # However, we can use the degraded donor in the next round? \n\n                    Known solution in C++:\n                         int ans = 0;\n                         while (m < n) {\n                             ans++;\n                             if (m <= n/2) {\n                                 ans += m;\n                                 m *= 2;\n                             } else {\n                                 ans += (n - m);\n                                 m = n;\n                             }\n                         }\n\n                 But note: the operations: \n                    In one \"round\":\n                       We clone the array that currently has the most desired elements (which is m). Then we can swap up to m times: each swap takes one desired element from the donor and puts it in the target. This increases the target's desired elements by m, but wait: we only need n-m more. And also, we can only swap as many as the donor has.\n\n                 However, after we clone, we have two arrays: the target and the donor, both with m desired elements. Then we can swap up to m times: but each swap gives one more desired element in the target and reduces the donor by one. So after k swaps, the target has m+k and the donor has m-k.\n\n                 Then we can use the donor array for future rounds? But it has less.\n\n                 Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    operations = 0\n                    while m < n:\n                         # We can use the current set of arrays to gather more in one array.\n                         # How many swaps can we do in this round? We can use all the arrays that are not the target to donate. But initially, we have one target and (operations) other arrays? \n\n                 Known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round 767, Div2C): \n                    while (m < n) {\n                         int d = min(m, n - m);\n                         r += d + 1;   // 1 for the clone, and d for the swaps\n                         m += d;\n                    }\n\n                 Why is that? \n                    In one round:\n                         We clone (1 operation) and then we swap d times (d operations) where d = min(m, n-m) [we can swap at most m times from the new clone, but we only need n-m more].\n                         Then after the swaps, the target array has m + d = min(2m, n) desired elements.\n\n                 Example: n=5, m=1 initially.\n                    Round1: d = min(1,4)=1 -> operations += 1+1 = 2, then m becomes 2.\n                    Round2: d = min(2,3)=2 -> operations += 2+1 = 3, then m becomes 4.\n                    Round3: d = min(4,1)=1 -> operations += 1+1 = 2, then m becomes 5.\n                    Total operations = 2+3+2 = 7.\n\n                 But the example in the problem: n=6, array=[0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (for 0 and 3). \n                    We need to get to 6.\n                    Round1: d = min(2,4)=2 -> operations=3, m=4.\n                    Round2: d = min(4,2)=2 -> operations=3, m=6.\n                    Total operations=6.\n\n                 This matches the example.\n\n                 Therefore, the while loop should be:\n\n                    while m < n:\n                         d = min(m, n - m)\n                         r += d + 1\n                         m += d\n\n                 But note: the problem says the array might have negative numbers? But we are counting by frequency of the most common element.\n\n                 So the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\n                    d = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += d + 1\n                    m += d\n\n                 But wait: the variable `n` is the length of the array? And `m` is the current maximum frequency.\n\n                 However, note: the line:\n\n                    n=len(a:=a.split())\n\n                 This sets n to the length of the array. And m = max frequency.\n\n                 But the array `a` is split from the input, and then we count frequency. \n\n                 So we output for program2:\n\n                    \"program2\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += d + 1\\n        m += d\"\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: count the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers that sum to n. Distinct means different multisets (so order doesn't matter). \n\nWe are to do it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n   g=10**9+7\n   v=[1]+[0]*40001\n   for i in range(1,40001):\n        if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n   for n in[*open(0)][1:]:print(v[int(n)]%g)\n\nWe are building an array `v` of size 40001, where v[0]=1 and v[j] will be the number of ways to sum to j.\n\nThis is a classic unbounded knapsack (coin change) problem where the coins are the palindromic numbers. \n\nThe recurrence:\n\n   v[0] = 1\n   for each coin (palindrome) i from 1 to 40000:\n        if i is palindrome, then for j from i to 40001:\n             v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % mod\n\nBut the provided code has:\n\n   for i in range(1,40001):\n        if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i,40001): \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to update v[j] by adding v[j-i].\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the modulus g is 10**9+7.\n\nBut the final output is:\n\n        print(v[int(n)]%g)\n\nWe are doing modulo at the end. But we should do modulo during the update to avoid overflow.\n\nSo the TODO is:\n\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the array `v` is being updated in increasing order of j? And we are iterating j from i to 40001. This is the standard way for unbounded knapsack (each coin can be used any number of times). \n\nTherefore, we output for program3:\n\n   \"program3\": \"        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\nBut note: the code has:\n\n   for i in range(1,40001):\n        if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must indent properly.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n   for i in range(1,40001):\n        if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i,40001):\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut the TODO is only the inner part.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the variable for the modulus is `g`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for program3 is:\n\n        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\nBut note: the code uses `g` (not `mod` or anything else).\n\nSo we output:\n\n   \"program3\": \"        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\n### Summary\n\nWe output the following JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    print(\\\"NO\\\\n\\\")\\n    continue\",\n  \"program2\": \"        d = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += d + 1\\n        m += d\",\n  \"program3\": \"        v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program1, the condition (x1<=arr[y1] or x2<=arr[y2]) should be false by the input, but we output \"NO\" and continue if it is true.\n\nIn program2, we update the variables in the while loop.\n\nIn program3, we update the dp array.\n\nLet me write the JSON string."
