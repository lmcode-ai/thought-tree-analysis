The known solution for this problem (Conquer the World) is:\n\n      ans = b * (sum of all x_i)   # without moving\n      Then we consider moving the capital to kingdom i, and we subtract the saving.

Actually, we can conquer j+1 from j, then from j+1 we can conquer j+2? But then the capital is still at j? The problem: when we conquer, the capital does not move. So to conquer j+1, we pay b*(x_{j+1}-x_j). Then to conquer j+2, we pay b*(x_{j+2}-x_j) because the capital is still at j? Actually, yes: because we don't move the capital until we explicitly do so. So the cost to conquer from j to i (if we are at j and we don't move the capital) is: \n          = b * [ (x_{j+1}-x_j) + (x_{j+2}-x_j) + ... + (x_i - x_j) ] = b * [ (x_{j+1}+x_{j+2}+...+x_i) - (i - j) * x_j ]\n\n      Then we move the capital from j to i: cost = a * (x_i - x_j) Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n          dp[i] = min_{0<=j<i} { dp[j] + a*(x_i - x_j) + b * ( (prefix[i+1]-prefix[j+1]) - (i - j) * x_j ) }\n\n      But note: dp[j] already includes the cost for conquering the first j+1 kingdoms and having the capital at x_j. However, we have not conquered the kingdoms from j+1 to i. So we need to add the cost for conquering them. Alternatively, we can precompute prefix sums. Let P[i] = x_0 + x_1 + ... + x_{i-1}\n\n      Then the cost for conquering j+1 to i: \n          = b * [ (P[i+1]-P[j+1]) - (i - j) * x_j ]\n\n      But note: P[i+1]-P[j+1] = x_{j+1}+...+x_i.

So the answer is min_i dp[i]? But note: we have to conquer all kingdoms. We can leave the capital anywhere. However, we have conquered all, so we don't need to move after the last conquest? Actually, we don't require the capital to be at the last kingdom. But we can also not move the capital at the end? However, the cost for conquering the last kingdom does not depend on the capital being moved to it? Actually, we can have the capital at j (which is not the last) and then conquer the last kingdom from j: cost = b*(x_n-1 - x_j). So we need to account for the entire segment. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          total = b * (P[n])   # without moving\n          Then we subtract the saving we get by moving the capital at some points. But the known efficient solution (n up to 200000) is to use a formula and update with a convex hull trick? However, note the constraint: the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case? But t can be up to 1000, and the sum of n<=200000, so we can do O(n) per test case. But the recurrence above is O(n^2). We need O(n). Alternatively, we can refactor:\n\n      dp[i] = min_{j} { dp[j] + a*(x_i - x_j) + b * ( (P[i+1]-P[j+1]) - (i - j) * x_j ) }\n\n      = min_{j} { dp[j] - a*x_j - b*P[j+1] + b*j*x_j } + a*x_i + b*P[i+1] - b * i * x_j?   -> wait, the term (i-j)*x_j: we have i and j mixed. Actually, we have:\n\n          = min_{j} { dp[j] - a*x_j - b*P[j+1] + b * j * x_j } \n            + a*x_i + b*P[i+1] - b * i * x_j   -> but the x_j in the last term is from j, so we cannot factor. Alternatively, we can rewrite the cost for j:\n\n      term_j = dp[j] - a*x_j - b*P[j+1] + b * j * x_j\n\n      and then we have:\n\n          dp[i] = a*x_i + b*P[i+1] + min_{j} { term_j + b * ( - i * x_j ) } \n\n      But note: the term -b*i*x_j: we have i and j. This is linear in i and x_j? So we have: \n          dp[i] = a*x_i + b*P[i+1] + min_{j} { term_j - b*i*x_j }\n\n      = a*x_i + b*P[i+1] + min_{j} { (term_j) + (-b*x_j)*i }\n\n      This is linear in i: we can use convex hull trick to minimize over j.\n\n  However, the problem says the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do a CHT in O(n log n) per test case? But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case without CHT? Actually, the constraints: t test cases, and the sum of n <= 200000, so we can do O(n^2) if the worst-case n is small? But worst-case n can be 200000 in one test case? Then O(n^2) is 40e9 which is too high. Therefore, we need a linear or O(n log n) solution. Alternatively, we can use a different approach. Known solution from Codeforces problems (like \"Conquer the World\" from ICPC) is:\n\n      ans = b * (sum(xs))\n      best = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          # consider moving the capital to xs[i] after conquering the first i+1 kingdoms\n          # Then the cost for the rest: we conquer from xs[i] the kingdoms from i+1 to n-1: cost = b * ( (xs[i+1]-xs[i]) + (xs[i+2]-xs[i]) + ... + (xs[n-1]-xs[i]) )\n          #   = b * ( (xs[i+1]+...+xs[n-1]) - (n-1-i)*xs[i] )\n          # And the cost for the first i+1 kingdoms: we conquered them from 0: cost = b * (xs[0]+xs[1]+...+xs[i])\n          # Then we move the capital to xs[i]: cost = a * xs[i]\n          # Total = b * (sum(xs)) + a*xs[i] - b*(n-1-i)*xs[i] \n          # But we can also have moved the capital earlier?

Now, if we move to 1: cost=6*(1-0)=6, then for the next 4 kingdoms we save 3*(4) per unit? Specifically, without moving: the cost for the next 4 kingdoms: 3*( (5-0) + (6-0) + (21-0) + (30-0) ) = 3*(5+6+21+30)=3*62=186. With moving: cost for moving=6, and then cost for the next 4: 3*( (5-1)+(6-1)+(21-1)+(30-1) ) = 3*(4+5+20+29)=3*58=174, total=3+6+174=183. But the example did 171.

(6>6 is false) -> so we don't move. i3: xs[3]=21\n             conquer: ans=48+3*(21-5)=48+48=96, cap=5.\n             k=1, condition: 1*3=3<6 -> don't move.\n          i4: xs[4]=30\n             conquer: ans=96+3*(30-5)=96+75=171. This matches. But is this always optimal? Consider: \n          Condition: if (n-i-1)*b > a, then move. Why? The cost of moving now: a*(x_i - cap) The saving in the future: for each of the next k kingdoms, we reduce the cost by b*(x_i - cap) (because we are closer by x_i - cap), so total saving = k * b * (x_i - cap) Net cost of moving: (a - k*b) * (x_i - cap) We want to move if net cost is negative, i.e., if k*b > a.\n\n      But note: we might move multiple times? And the condition for moving at i is independent of future moves?",

      "text": "Actually, if we move now, then the future moves might be done from a closer capital? But the condition only considers the immediate saving for the next k conquests? However, if we move now, then the capital is at x_i, and then at the next step we might move again? And the saving for the next step would be computed again. This greedy seems to work for the example. But consider a simple case: \n          n=2, a=3, b=2, xs=[1,2]\n\n          Without moving: \n              conquer 1: 2*1=2\n              conquer 2: 2*2=4 -> total=6. With moving after conquering 1:\n              conquer 1: 2\n              move: 3*1=3\n              conquer 2: 2*(2-1)=2 -> total=7.\n\n          Without moving is better. Condition at i=0: k=1, 1*2=2 < a=3 -> condition fails, so we don't move. Then total=6.\n\n      Another case: \n          n=2, a=1, b=2, xs=[1,2]\n          Condition at i=0: k=1, 1*2=2>1 -> move. Then total = 2*1 + 1*1 + 2*(2-1) = 2+1+2=5. Without moving: 2*1+2*2=6. So the greedy works. Therefore, the missing code in program1.py:\n\n          cum = 0   # not used? \n          ans = 0\n          cap = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              ans += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:   # condition: (number of remaining kingdoms)*b > a\n                  ans += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n\n          Then output ans. But note: the initial ans is set to \"sum(xs)*b\", which is the cost without moving. We are going to update it. The current code:\n\n          ans = sum(xs)*b   # without moving\n\n          Then we iterate and we want to subtract the saving we get by moving? Alternatively, we can compute from scratch. The current code sets ans = sum(xs)*b, and then we are going to subtract the saving? But the greedy above is additive. How to reconcile? We can do:\n\n          cap = 0\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\n                  total += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n\n          ans = total But the initial code sets ans = sum(xs)*b, which is b * (x0+x1+... +x_{n-1]). In our greedy, without moving we do: \n          total = b*x0 + b*x1 + ... + b*x_{n-1]   -> but wait, no: \n          Without moving: \n             conquer i-th kingdom: cost = b * (x_i - 0) = b*x_i. So total = b * (x0+x1+...+x_{n-1]) But in the greedy, we do:\n          conquer the first kingdom: cost = b*(x0-0) = b*x0. then if we don't move, conquer the second: cost = b*(x1-0) = b*x1. So the initial ans is the cost without moving. Then in the loop, we are going to update ans to be the total cost with moves. But the current code has:\n\n          ans = sum(xs)*b\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              # we want to update ans to be the minimum cost\n\n      We can do:\n\n          cap = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              # We are at kingdom i, and we have conquered it from cap.\n              # But in the initial scenario, cap=0, so the cost for this kingdom is already included in ans as b*x_i. # However, if we move, we will add extra cost (for moving) and then reduce future costs. # How much do we save by moving to x_i for the future kingdoms? #",

In one move, we can choose an index i and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.

The idea: \n      We fix an index i to be the \"free\" point? Or we are considering that we do not change b_i? Actually, the problem: we can do any number of moves on any index. The moves on index i can be positive or negative. The known solution: \n          We note that we can set b_i arbitrarily. We want to minimize the total moves. We can set b_i = c_i * a_i, where c_i is an integer (positive or negative). The total moves is the sum of |c_i|. The constraints: b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\n          We can use dynamic programming: \n              dp[i][j] = minimum moves for the first i+1 elements such that b_i = j * a_i   (but j can be any integer, and the range is huge) Alternatively, we can use a greedy method. The provided code iterates i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it sets b_i to 0? and then adjusts the left and right. Specifically, for a fixed i, we set b_i = 0",

We start from j = i-1, and we have the next value (to the right) is b_{j+1] (which we have set to some value, initially for j=i-1, the next is b_i=0). We require b_j < b_{j+1]. We can set b_j = - a_j * y, for some positive integer y, such that b_j < b_{j+1] and we want to minimize y (to minimize moves) and also we want b_j to be as large as possible (to make it easier for the next left). Actually, we want the largest multiple of a_j (by negative multiples) that is less than b_{j+1]. The largest multiple of a_j that is less than b_{j+1] is: \n              Let y_min = ceil(( - b_{j+1] + 1) / a_j)   ??? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We want b_j = - a_j * y, and we require:\n                -a_j * y < b_{j+1]   =>   a_j * y > -b_{j+1] \n            But note: if b_{j+1] is positive, then we can set y=0? then b_j=0, but then 0 < b_{j+1] (if b_{j+1]>0) -> valid. But we want to minimize moves? Actually, we want to minimize the total moves, which is the sum of |c_i| = |y| for the left. We want the largest b_j (which is the least negative) that is less than b_{j+1]. The largest multiple of a_j that is <= b_{j+1] - 1? \n\n          But note: we can also use positive multiples? The problem allows adding or subtracting. So we can set b_j to any multiple of a_j, positive or negative. We want the largest multiple of a_j that is strictly less than b_{j+1]. How to compute?

      "text": "The total moves for the entire array when we fix index i to be 0 is: left_moves + 0 (for i) + right_moves. Then we iterate i over all indices. Why is this correct? We are trying every index i to be set to 0 moves (i.e., b_i=0). Then we adjust the left and right accordingly. But note: we might not set any index to 0? However, the problem does not require b_i to be 0. But we are allowed to set it to 0 by doing 0 moves? Actually, we start with b_i=0, so we don't need to do any move to set it to 0. But is it optimal to set one index to 0? Consider: we might set an index to a nonzero value with fewer moves? However, the problem: we are iterating over every index i and setting b_i=0, and then computing the moves for the rest. Then we take the minimum. This is a known solution for similar problems (like \"Increasing Sequence\") and it runs in O(n^2) which is acceptable for n<=5000? But note: the constraints: n<=5000, and we iterate over i (n iterations) and each iteration does O(n). So total O(n^2)=25e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: while j>=0:\n              m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n              temp += abs(m)\n              prev = a[j] * m\n              j -= 1\n\n      We must be cautious: integer division for negative numbers. Example: a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]   from the example note: \n          Example1: we can do: \n              b0 = -1 (by subtracting 1: 1 move)\n              b1 = 0 (0 moves? but we set it to 0? but we are iterating i. For i=1: set b1=0, then left: j=0: \n                  prev = 0, then m = (0-1)//a[0] = (-1)//1 = -1 -> moves=1, then set prev = a[0]*(-1) = -1. Then right: k=2: x = ceil((0+1)/a[2]) = ceil(1/1)=1 -> moves=1, prev=1\n              k=3: ceil((1+1)/2)=ceil(2/2)=1 -> moves=1, prev=2\n              k=4: ceil((2 +1)/1)=ceil(3)=3 -> moves=3, prev=3\n              total moves = 1 (left) + 1 (for k=2) + 1 (k=3) + 3 (k=4) = 6? But the example says 4 moves. Why? The example says: \n              subtract a1 from b1: but note the array a: a0=1, a1=2, a2=1, a3=2, a4=1. They did: \n                  b0 = -1 (by subtracting a0: 1 move)\n                  b1 = 0 (by doing nothing? but we set b1=0 by 0 moves? but the problem: initially 0, so we don't need to do anything? \n                  b2 = 3? -> no, they added a2: 1 move? \n                  b3 = 4: add a3: 1 move\n                  b4 = 5: add a4: 1 move -> total 1+0+1+1+1=4. In our method for i=1 (index1, which is the second element) we set b1=0. Then:\n              left: j=0: we set b0 to the largest multiple of a0=1 that is <0 -> that is -1. So we do 1 move (m=-1, |m|=1). right: \n                  k=2: we set b2 to the smallest multiple of a2=1 that is >0: which is 1 -> 1 move.\n                  k=3: then set b3 to the smallest multiple of a3=2 that is >1: which is 2? but 2>1 -> 1 move? but then we require strictly increasing: 1<2 -> valid. But then b4: smallest multiple of a4=1 that is >2: 3 -> 3 moves? total = 1 (left) + 1 (k=2) + 1 (k=3) + 3 (k=4) = 6. Why 3 moves for b4? Because we set b4=3, which requires 3 moves (add 3 times). But we can set b4=3 by adding 3 times? However, the example did 1 move for b4: they set b4=5? Actually, the example: \n              [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5 ] So they set b2=3, b3=4, b4=5. In our right part for k=2: \n              We set b2 to 1? but then we have b1=0, b2=1 -> valid. Then for k=3: we set b3 to the smallest multiple of 2 that is >1: that is 2 -> 1 move (add once) -> then b3=2. Then for k=4: we set b4 to the smallest multiple of 1 that is >2: that is 3 -> 1 move? because we add once? But then we get [ -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> which is increasing, and moves=1 (left) + 1 (k=2) + 1 (k=3) + 1 (k=4) = 4. How did we get 3 for k=4? The code for the right part:\n\n              x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k]) For k=4: \n              prev = b3 = 2\n              then x = ceil((2+1)/1) = ceil(3)=3 -> then we add 3 moves? But that is not correct. We want the smallest x such that a[k]*x > prev. Condition: 1*x > 2 -> x>2 -> smallest integer x=3. But we can also set b4=3 by adding 3 times? However, we can also set b4=3 by adding 3 times? But note: the moves for index4 is |x|, and x=3, so 3 moves. Why did the example do 1 move? The example says: they added a4 to b4 once? but then b4=1? which is not greater than 4? Actually, the example: \n              \"subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" The array a: \n                  a0=1 -> b0: subtract once -> -1\n                  a1=2 -> b1: subtract once? but they did subtract a1 from b1: so b1 = 0 - 2 = -2?

But wait: the moves are per index: we can do multiple moves on the same index. For b2: we can add three times: 3 moves -> b2=3. For b3: we can add twice: 2 moves -> b3=4? For b4: we can add five times: 5 moves -> b4=5. Total 1+3+2+5=11.

The right part is provided and uses:\n\n          x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n\n      And then moves += x, and then set prev = a[k]*x. For the left part, we do:\n\n          m = (prev-1) // a[j] [since a[j] is positive]\n\n      And then moves += abs(m), and set prev = a[j]*m. This should be correct. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: while j>=0:\n              m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n              temp += abs(m)\n              prev = a[j] * m\n              j -= 1\n\n      We output that.

So mid_y is between 0 and min(alpha_1, alpha_2). But then we compute yy, which is negative. And we compare yy (negative) and mid_y (positive). Then yy < mid_y is always true. That cannot be. Let me check the call:\n\n      la, lb, ra, rb, cy, fy = 0.0, 0.0, pi - alpha_1, pi - alpha_2, min(alpha_1, alpha_2), 0.0000 Then we do:\n\n          while math.fabs(cy - fy) > eps:   # cy is min(alpha_1, alpha_2) (positive), fy=0 (positive) -> so we enter the loop. mid_y = (cy+fy)/2   # a positive number. Then we compute yy, which is negative. Then we compare:\n          if yy < mid_y:   # negative < positive -> true, so we do ...? Then if yy > mid_y:   # false. So we always take the first branch. Then the TODO: what to do when yy < mid_y? We are binary searching for mid_a in [la, ra] to achieve yy = mid_y. If yy < mid_y, and since yy is negative and mid_y is positive, we are below the target. We want to increase yy (make it less negative). How to increase yy? yy = - [ sin^2(mid_a) * cos(alpha_1+mid_a) ] / sin(alpha_1) We can increase yy by making the term [ sin^2(mid_a) * cos(alpha_1+mid_a) ] smaller (because of the negative sign). The function is complicated. We are binary searching on mid_a in [0, pi - alpha_1] (because initially ra = pi - alpha_1). We might need to adjust la or ra. In the branch for yy < mid_y, we want to increase yy. So we should adjust the interval to try a larger yy. How?\n\n      Without knowing the monotonicity of yy with respect to mid_a, it is hard. Alternatively, we can look at the other branch in the symmetric part: for the other angle, we have:\n\n      while math.fabs(rb - lb) > eps:\n          mid_b = (rb+lb)/2\n          yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_b), 2) * math.cos(alpha_2 + mid_b) / math.sin(alpha_2) if yy < mid_y:\n              lb = mid_b\n          if yy > mid_y:\n              rb = mid_b\n\n  In this branch, when yy < mid_y, we set lb = mid_b, meaning we are increasing mid_b? And in the first branch, we have:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: \n          ... if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  By symmetry, in the first branch, if yy < mid_y, we should set la = mid_a? or ra = mid_a? But in the second branch, when yy < mid_y, we set lb = mid_b, which is the lower bound to mid_b, so we are increasing the variable. In the first branch, if we want to increase yy, and if yy is an increasing function of mid_a, then we should set la = mid_a to increase mid_a. But we don't know. However, the code in the second branch for the other angle is provided and we see:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: lb = mid_b   -> we are moving the lower bound up, so we are searching in [mid_b, rb] next. if yy > mid_y: rb = mid_b\n\n  So for the first branch, we should do the same:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: \n          la = mid_a\n      if yy > mid_y: ra = mid_a\n\n  But wait, in the first branch we have two if's, not elif. So if the first if is taken, the second if might also be checked? The code has:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          # TODO\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  We need to do one or the other. In the second branch, it is:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          rb = mid_b\n\n  This is acceptable because if yy==mid_y, we break? but we don't have an explicit break. We rely on the while loop condition. But if yy is not equal, we set either lb or rb. In the first branch, we should do:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          la = mid_a if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  But note: the first if and the second if are not exclusive? Actually, if yy < mid_y, then we set la=mid_a, and then we also check if yy>mid_y? which is false, so we don't set ra. So it's safe. Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              la = mid_a And then we leave the rest. So the code for program3.py for the TODO is:\n\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              la = mid_a\n\n  We output that. But note: the function binary_find is not complete. However, the problem only asks for the TODO part. Summary:\n\n  We output a JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    cap = 0\\n    total_cost = 0\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\\n        if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\\n            total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\\n            cap = xs[i]\\n    ans = total_cost\",\n        \"program2\": \"        m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\\n        temp += abs(m)\\n        prev = a[j] * m\\n        j -= 1\",\n        \"program3\": \"            la = mid_a\"\n      }\n\n  But note: in program1, we must be careful: the variable 'cum' is not used, so we remove it. We replace the entire for loop. In program2, we fill the while loop for j.\n\n  In program3, we fill the if branch. Let's write the exact code strings. For program1, the missing code is the entire for loop body replacement? Actually, the original code had:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          # TODO:",

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about conquering kingdoms with minimum cost. The solution involves dynamic programming or greedy with two operations: moving the capital and conquering a kingdom.\n\nThe provided code has a loop for i in range(n) and we need to fill the TODO.\n\nAfter reading the note, we see that the optimal strategy involves conquering some kingdoms from the left and then moving the capital to the right and conquering the rest.\n\nThe idea is to consider that we might move the capital at some kingdom i, and then conquer the remaining kingdoms to the right without moving the capital again until necessary.\n\nWe note:\n- Initially, the capital is at 0.\n- We can conquer a kingdom only if there is no unconquered kingdom between the capital and the target.\n\nWe can use the following approach:\n\nLet dp[i] be the minimum total cost to conquer the first i kingdoms and have the capital at the i-th kingdom.\n\nHowever, note that the problem does not require the capital to end at a specific location.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy method:\n\nWe know that we must conquer all kingdoms. The cost without moving the capital (i.e., conquering all from 0) is b * (sum of all x_i). But we can reduce the cost by moving the capital to a conquered kingdom.\n\nThe note in the problem gives an example. We can break the cost into:\n- The cost to conquer the first i kingdoms and then move the capital to the i-th kingdom.\n\nWe can compute:\n\ncum = 0\nans = b * (sum of all x_i)   # if we conquer all from 0 without moving\n\nBut then we iterate and consider moving the capital to kingdom i and then conquering the rest from there.\n\nThe missing code in the loop might be:\n\n  cum += xs[i]   # but note: we are iterating from left to right\n\nActually, we can do:\n\n  # We consider that we have conquered the first i kingdoms and the capital is at xs[i]\n  # Then the cost so far is ... and then for the next kingdoms, we can conquer from xs[i] without moving.\n\nBut note the problem: we can only conquer a kingdom if there is no unconquered in between. So if we are at capital at xs[i], we can only conquer xs[i+1] next? Actually, we can conquer any unconquered kingdom that has no gap? Actually, the condition is: we cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between. So we must conquer from left to right? Actually, the kingdoms are given in increasing order and we can only conquer adjacent ones without gaps? \n\nThe problem says: \"you cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the target and your capital\". So we must conquer in increasing order? Actually, we can jump? But if we are at capital c1 and want to conquer c2, and there is an unconquered kingdom between, then we cannot. So we must conquer the next one to the right? Or we can conquer any that is adjacent to the conquered set? Actually, the conquered set must be contiguous from 0? \n\nBut note: we start at 0 and the kingdoms are at positive positions. We can conquer non-adjacent ones if we move the capital? Actually, no: because if we move the capital to a conquered kingdom, then from that capital we can only conquer the next adjacent unconquered kingdom? \n\nActually, the problem does not require contiguous conquered set. But the condition for conquering: we cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the capital and the target. So if the capital is at c and there is an unconquered kingdom at d (between c and the target e), then we cannot conquer e. Therefore, we must conquer from left to right.\n\nSo the strategy: we must conquer the kingdoms in increasing order of x_i.\n\nWe can use:\n\n  ans = b * xs[-1]   # but wait, we have n kingdoms.\n\nActually, the initial cost if we conquer all from 0: \n  cost = b * (x1 + x2 + ... + xn)   ??? \n\nBut note: when we conquer a kingdom at x_i from capital at 0, the cost is b * x_i. Then if we move the capital to x_i, we pay a * (x_i - 0). Then to conquer x_j (j>i) from x_i, we pay b * (x_j - x_i). \n\nBut we can move the capital multiple times.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming:\n\nLet dp[i] = minimum total cost to conquer the first i kingdoms and have the capital at the i-th kingdom.\n\nHow to compute dp[i]?\n\nWe start at 0. We can conquer kingdom i without having conquered the ones in between? No, because we must conquer in order (because of the condition). So we must conquer from left to right.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  dp[0] = 0   # we have conquered nothing, capital at 0.\n\nBut we have n kingdoms. We can define dp[i] for i from 0 to n, where i=0 means no kingdom conquered.\n\nThen for i from 1 to n:\n  We can conquer kingdom i from the current capital (which is at some j, j in [0, i-1]) and then possibly move the capital to i.\n\nBut note: we can also not move the capital and conquer from the same capital.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n  dp[i] = min_{0<=j<i} { dp[j] + a*(x_j - 0?) + ... }\n\nActually, we can break the cost:\n\n- To conquer kingdom i from capital at j (which is at x_j, and j is the last conquered kingdom we moved the capital to) we pay b*(x_i - x_j). But note: we must have conquered all kingdoms between j and i? Actually, we can skip some? No, because we must conquer in order? Actually, we must conquer the ones in between first? \n\nBut the condition: we cannot conquer i if there is an unconquered kingdom between j and i. So if we haven't conquered a kingdom between j and i, we cannot conquer i. Therefore, we must have conquered all from j to i.\n\nSo we can only set the capital at a conquered kingdom, and then we can only conquer the next adjacent one? \n\nActually, we can conquer the next adjacent unconquered kingdom. So we must conquer in increasing order.\n\nTherefore, we can use:\n\n  dp[i] = min( dp[i-1] + b*(x_i - x_{i-1}) , ... )\n\nBut we can also move the capital from a previous kingdom to i, and then conquer the next ones from i.\n\nActually, the solution:\n\n  ans = min_{i=0}^{n-1} { a*x_i + b*(x_n - x_i) + ... }\n\nBut note the example: \n  n=4, a=6, b=3, xs = [1,5,6,21,30] -> wait, the example has 5 kingdoms? Actually, the example input: \n      \"The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n, a, and b (1\u2264n\u22642\u22c510^5) ... The second line ... n integers x1, x2, ..., xn\"\n  and the example: \n      n=5? Actually, the example says: \"There are n unconquered kingdoms\" and then lists 1,5,6,21,30 -> 5 numbers.\n\nBut the example test case: \n  Input: \n      1\n      5 6 3\n      1 5 6 21 30\n\n  The answer is 171.\n\nWe can derive:\n\n  We start at 0. We can choose to move the capital at some point to a conquered kingdom.\n\n  The total cost = (cost to conquer the first i kingdoms without moving the capital) + (cost to move the capital to i) + (cost to conquer the rest from i)\n\n  But note: when we move the capital to i, we have already conquered i? So we can break at i.\n\n  Let prefix[i] = b * (x_0 + ... + x_{i-1})? Actually, no: if we conquer from 0, the cost for the j-th kingdom is b * x_j.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      total = b * (x0 + x1 + ... + x_{n-1})   # if we never move\n\n  But if we move the capital to i, then:\n      - The cost for conquering the first i+1 kingdoms (from 0 to i) is: \n          We conquer the first kingdom (x0) from 0: cost = b * x0.\n          Then we can move the capital to x0: cost += a * x0.\n          Then we conquer the next kingdom x1 from x0: cost += b * (x1 - x0)\n          Then we can move the capital to x1: cost += a * (x1 - x0)   ... but wait, we don't have to move after every conquest.\n\n  Actually, we can move only once to a kingdom and then conquer several from there.\n\n  The known solution for this problem (Conquer the World) is:\n\n      ans = b * (sum of all x_i)   # without moving\n      Then we consider moving the capital to kingdom i, and we subtract the saving.\n\n      Specifically, for each i, we can save: \n          saving = (a - b) * x_i - ... \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      Let F(i) = a * x_i + b * (S - (n - i) * x_i) \n      where S = sum_{j=i}^{n-1} x_j   ?\n\n  But note: if we move the capital to x_i, then the cost for conquering the kingdoms from i+1 to n-1 is: \n        b * ( (x_{i+1} - x_i) + (x_{i+2} - x_i) + ... ) \n        = b * ( (x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} + ... + x_{n-1}) - (n - i - 1) * x_i )\n\n  And the cost for conquering the first i+1 kingdoms (if we never moved until i) is: \n        b * (x0 + x1 + ... + x_i)\n\n  But then we also have the cost for moving the capital to x_i: which is a * x_i (if we move from 0 to x_i).\n\n  However, we might have moved the capital earlier and then moved again? \n\n  Actually, the known solution (from similar problems) is:\n\n      ans = b * total_sum\n      cum = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          # consider moving the capital to x_i after conquering the first i+1 kingdoms (from 0 to x_i)\n          # Then the cost for the first i+1 kingdoms: we conquered them from 0: cost = b * (x0 + x1 + ... + x_i)\n          # Then we move the capital to x_i: cost += a * x_i\n          # Then the cost for the rest: we conquer from x_i: cost += b * ( (x_{i+1} - x_i) + (x_{i+2} - x_i) + ... + (x_{n-1} - x_i) )\n          #   = b * ( (x_{i+1}+...+x_{n-1}) - (n-i-1)*x_i )\n          # Total = b * (x0+...+x_i) + a*x_i + b * ( (x_{i+1}+...+x_{n-1}) - (n-i-1)*x_i )\n          #       = b * total_sum + a*x_i - b*(n-i-1)*x_i - b*i*x_i?   -> wait, we have not subtracted anything for the first i+1? \n\n          Actually, in the initial total (without moving) we had b * total_sum.\n          In the new scenario, we have:\n            = b * (x0+...+x_i) + a*x_i + b * ( (x_{i+1}+...+x_{n-1}) - (n-i-1)*x_i )\n            = b * total_sum + a*x_i - b*(n-i-1)*x_i\n\n          But note: the initial total_sum includes x_i as well? Actually, total_sum = x0+...+x_{n-1}. So:\n\n          = b * total_sum + a*x_i - b*(n-i-1)*x_i\n\n          Then we can update:\n\n          candidate = b * total_sum + a*x_i - b*(n-i-1)*x_i\n\n          However, we also might have moved the capital earlier and then again later? \n\n  But the example: \n        n=5, a=6, b=3, xs=[1,5,6,21,30]\n        total_sum = 1+5+6+21+30 = 63\n        candidate for i=0: \n            = 3*63 + 6*1 - 3*(5-0-1)*1 = 189 + 6 - 3*4*1 = 189+6-12 = 183 -> not 171.\n\n  candidate for i=1: \n        = 3*63 + 6*5 - 3*(5-1-1)*5 = 189 + 30 - 3*3*5 = 189+30-45 = 174\n  candidate for i=2: \n        = 3*63 + 6*6 - 3*(5-2-1)*6 = 189+36-3*2*6 = 189+36-36 = 189\n  candidate for i=3: \n        = 3*63 + 6*21 - 3*(5-3-1)*21 = 189+126 - 3*1*21 = 189+126-63 = 252\n  candidate for i=4: \n        = 3*63 + 6*30 - 3*(5-4-1)*30 -> n-i-1 = 0 -> 189+180 - 0 = 369\n\n  The minimum candidate is 174, but the example says 171.\n\n  So we must consider that we might move the capital multiple times.\n\n  Actually, the example does multiple moves: \n        Conquer 1: cost=3*1=3\n        Move to 1: cost=6*1=6\n        Conquer 5: cost=3*(5-1)=12\n        Move to 5: cost=6*(5-1)=24\n        Conquer 6: cost=3*(6-5)=3\n        Conquer 21: cost=3*(21-5)=48\n        Conquer 30: cost=3*(30-5)=75\n        Total=3+6+12+24+3+48+75=171.\n\n  How to account for multiple moves?\n\n  We can use dynamic programming:\n\n      dp[i] = minimum cost to have conquered the first i+1 kingdoms and have the capital at x_i.\n\n      How to compute dp[i]?\n\n      We can come from j (0<=j<=i): \n          We assume that the capital was at x_j, and then we conquered from j to i without moving the capital in between? \n          But note: we can move the capital arbitrarily to any conquered kingdom. So we might have moved the capital to j, then conquered from j to i (without moving the capital again) and then we move the capital to i? \n\n      Actually, we can break the segment: we conquer the kingdoms from j+1 to i from the capital at j, and then we move the capital to i.\n\n      The cost for conquering from j to i (if we are at j and we conquer j+1, j+2, ... i) is: \n          cost_conquer = b * ( (x_{j+1}-x_j) + (x_{j+2}-x_j) + ... + (x_i - x_j) ) \n          But wait, we can only conquer the next adjacent one? Actually, we can conquer j+1 from j, then from j+1 we can conquer j+2? But then the capital is still at j? \n\n      The problem: when we conquer, the capital does not move. So to conquer j+1, we pay b*(x_{j+1}-x_j). Then to conquer j+2, we pay b*(x_{j+2}-x_j) because the capital is still at j? \n\n      Actually, yes: because we don't move the capital until we explicitly do so.\n\n      So the cost to conquer from j to i (if we are at j and we don't move the capital) is: \n          = b * [ (x_{j+1}-x_j) + (x_{j+2}-x_j) + ... + (x_i - x_j) ]\n          = b * [ (x_{j+1}+x_{j+2}+...+x_i) - (i - j) * x_j ]\n\n      Then we move the capital from j to i: cost = a * (x_i - x_j)\n\n      Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n          dp[i] = min_{0<=j<i} { dp[j] + a*(x_i - x_j) + b * ( (prefix[i+1]-prefix[j+1]) - (i - j) * x_j ) }\n\n      But note: dp[j] already includes the cost for conquering the first j+1 kingdoms and having the capital at x_j.\n\n      However, we have not conquered the kingdoms from j+1 to i. So we need to add the cost for conquering them.\n\n      Alternatively, we can precompute prefix sums.\n\n      Let P[i] = x_0 + x_1 + ... + x_{i-1}\n\n      Then the cost for conquering j+1 to i: \n          = b * [ (P[i+1]-P[j+1]) - (i - j) * x_j ]\n\n      But note: P[i+1]-P[j+1] = x_{j+1}+...+x_i.\n\n      Then:\n\n          dp[i] = min_{0<=j<i} { dp[j] + a*(x_i - x_j) + b * ( (P[i+1]-P[j+1]) - (i - j) * x_j ) }\n\n      Then after conquering all, we don't require the capital to be at the last kingdom? So the answer is min_i dp[i]? \n\n      But note: we have to conquer all kingdoms. We can leave the capital anywhere. However, we have conquered all, so we don't need to move after the last conquest? \n\n      Actually, we don't require the capital to be at the last kingdom. But we can also not move the capital at the end? \n\n      However, the cost for conquering the last kingdom does not depend on the capital being moved to it? \n\n      Actually, we can have the capital at j (which is not the last) and then conquer the last kingdom from j: cost = b*(x_n-1 - x_j). \n\n      So we need to account for the entire segment.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          total = b * (P[n])   # without moving\n          Then we subtract the saving we get by moving the capital at some points.\n\n      But the known efficient solution (n up to 200000) is to use a formula and update with a convex hull trick? \n\n  However, note the constraint: the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case? But t can be up to 1000, and the sum of n<=200000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n  But the recurrence above is O(n^2). We need O(n).\n\n  Alternatively, we can refactor:\n\n      dp[i] = min_{j} { dp[j] + a*(x_i - x_j) + b * ( (P[i+1]-P[j+1]) - (i - j) * x_j ) }\n\n      = min_{j} { dp[j] - a*x_j - b*P[j+1] + b*j*x_j } + a*x_i + b*P[i+1] - b * i * x_j?   -> wait, the term (i-j)*x_j: we have i and j mixed.\n\n      Actually, we have:\n\n          = min_{j} { dp[j] - a*x_j - b*P[j+1] + b * j * x_j } \n            + a*x_i + b*P[i+1] - b * i * x_j   -> but the x_j in the last term is from j, so we cannot factor.\n\n  Alternatively, we can rewrite the cost for j:\n\n      term_j = dp[j] - a*x_j - b*P[j+1] + b * j * x_j\n\n      and then we have:\n\n          dp[i] = a*x_i + b*P[i+1] + min_{j} { term_j + b * ( - i * x_j ) } \n\n      But note: the term -b*i*x_j: we have i and j. This is linear in i and x_j? \n\n      So we have: \n          dp[i] = a*x_i + b*P[i+1] + min_{j} { term_j - b*i*x_j }\n\n      = a*x_i + b*P[i+1] + min_{j} { (term_j) + (-b*x_j)*i }\n\n      This is linear in i: we can use convex hull trick to minimize over j.\n\n  However, the problem says the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do a CHT in O(n log n) per test case? But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case without CHT? \n\n  Actually, the constraints: t test cases, and the sum of n <= 200000, so we can do O(n^2) if the worst-case n is small? But worst-case n can be 200000 in one test case? Then O(n^2) is 40e9 which is too high.\n\n  Therefore, we need a linear or O(n log n) solution.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a different approach.\n\n  Known solution from Codeforces problems (like \"Conquer the World\" from ICPC) is:\n\n      ans = b * (sum(xs))\n      best = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          # consider moving the capital to xs[i] after conquering the first i+1 kingdoms\n          # Then the cost for the rest: we conquer from xs[i] the kingdoms from i+1 to n-1: cost = b * ( (xs[i+1]-xs[i]) + (xs[i+2]-xs[i]) + ... + (xs[n-1]-xs[i]) )\n          #   = b * ( (xs[i+1]+...+xs[n-1]) - (n-1-i)*xs[i] )\n          # And the cost for the first i+1 kingdoms: we conquered them from 0: cost = b * (xs[0]+xs[1]+...+xs[i])\n          # Then we move the capital to xs[i]: cost = a * xs[i]\n          # Total = b * (sum(xs)) + a*xs[i] - b*(n-1-i)*xs[i] \n          # But we can also have moved the capital earlier? \n\n      But we see that the example does multiple moves.\n\n  Another known solution (from a similar problem \"Conquer the World\" in Yandex) is:\n\n      ans = 0\n      current_capital = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          ans += b * (xs[i] - current_capital)   # conquer the next kingdom from current capital\n          if i < n-1:\n              # consider moving the capital to xs[i] now: cost a*(xs[i]-current_capital) and then we save on future conquests: \n              #   because from xs[i] we can conquer the next kingdom at cost b*(xs[i+1]-xs[i]) instead of b*(xs[i+1]-current_capital) \n              #   and the saving for one next kingdom is b*(xs[i]-current_capital) - a*(xs[i]-current_capital) = (b-a)*(xs[i]-current_capital)\n              # But we might conquer more than one from xs[i]? \n              # Actually, we can save for all future conquests: \n              #   Without moving: the cost for the next k kingdoms (from i+1 to i+k) would be: b * ( (xs[i+1]-current_capital) + ... + (xs[i+k]-current_capital) )\n              #   With moving to xs[i]: we pay a*(xs[i]-current_capital) and then the cost for the next k kingdoms: b * ( (xs[i+1]-xs[i]) + ... + (xs[i+k]-xs[i]) )\n              #   Saving = b * k * (xs[i]-current_capital) - a*(xs[i]-current_capital) = (b*k - a) * (xs[i]-current_capital)\n              #   This saving is positive only if b*k > a.\n\n          So we can decide to move if the saving is positive? \n\n      But the example: \n          n=5, a=6, b=3\n          xs = [1,5,6,21,30]\n\n          Start at 0.\n          Step0: conquer 1: cost=3*(1-0)=3, total=3.\n          Now, if we move to 1: cost=6*(1-0)=6, then for the next 4 kingdoms we save 3*(4) per unit? \n          Specifically, without moving: the cost for the next 4 kingdoms: 3*( (5-0) + (6-0) + (21-0) + (30-0) ) = 3*(5+6+21+30)=3*62=186.\n          With moving: cost for moving=6, and then cost for the next 4: 3*( (5-1)+(6-1)+(21-1)+(30-1) ) = 3*(4+5+20+29)=3*58=174, total=3+6+174=183.\n          But the example did 171.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          ans = 0\n          cap = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              # always conquer the next kingdom from the current capital\n              ans += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              # Now, consider moving the capital to xs[i] for the future\n              # How many kingdoms are left? k = n - i - 1\n              # The cost of moving: a * (xs[i] - cap)\n              # The saving in future: for each future kingdom j, we save: b * (xs[j] - cap) - b * (xs[j] - xs[i]) = b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              #   and there are k future kingdoms, so total saving = k * b * (xs[i]-cap) - a*(xs[i]-cap) = (k*b - a) * (xs[i]-cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-i-1)*b > a:\n                  # then we move\n                  ans += a * (xs[i]-cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n\n          Then output ans.\n\n      Let's try the example:\n          i0: xs[0]=1\n             conquer: ans=3*(1-0)=3, cap=0.\n             k=4, saving condition: 4*3=12>6 -> true, so move: ans=3+6=9, cap=1.\n          i1: xs[1]=5\n             conquer: ans=9+3*(5-1)=9+12=21, cap=1.\n             k=3, condition: 3*3=9>6 -> true, move: ans=21+6*(5-1)=21+24=45, cap=5.\n          i2: xs[2]=6\n             conquer: ans=45+3*(6-5)=45+3=48, cap=5.\n             k=2, condition: 2*3=6>6 -> false? (6>6 is false) -> so we don't move.\n          i3: xs[3]=21\n             conquer: ans=48+3*(21-5)=48+48=96, cap=5.\n             k=1, condition: 1*3=3<6 -> don't move.\n          i4: xs[4]=30\n             conquer: ans=96+3*(30-5)=96+75=171.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      But is this always optimal? \n\n      Consider: \n          Condition: if (n-i-1)*b > a, then move.\n\n      Why? \n          The cost of moving now: a*(x_i - cap)\n          The saving in the future: for each of the next k kingdoms, we reduce the cost by b*(x_i - cap) (because we are closer by x_i - cap), so total saving = k * b * (x_i - cap)\n          Net cost of moving: (a - k*b) * (x_i - cap) \n          We want to move if net cost is negative, i.e., if k*b > a.\n\n      But note: we might move multiple times? And the condition for moving at i is independent of future moves? \n\n      Actually, if we move now, then the future moves might be done from a closer capital? But the condition only considers the immediate saving for the next k conquests? \n\n      However, if we move now, then the capital is at x_i, and then at the next step we might move again? And the saving for the next step would be computed again.\n\n      This greedy seems to work for the example.\n\n      But consider a simple case: \n          n=2, a=3, b=2, xs=[1,2]\n\n          Without moving: \n              conquer 1: 2*1=2\n              conquer 2: 2*2=4 -> total=6.\n          With moving after conquering 1:\n              conquer 1: 2\n              move: 3*1=3\n              conquer 2: 2*(2-1)=2 -> total=7.\n\n          Without moving is better.\n\n          Condition at i=0: k=1, 1*2=2 < a=3 -> condition fails, so we don't move.\n\n          Then total=6.\n\n      Another case: \n          n=2, a=1, b=2, xs=[1,2]\n          Condition at i=0: k=1, 1*2=2>1 -> move.\n          Then total = 2*1 + 1*1 + 2*(2-1) = 2+1+2=5.\n          Without moving: 2*1+2*2=6.\n\n      So the greedy works.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code in program1.py:\n\n          cum = 0   # not used? \n          ans = 0\n          cap = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              ans += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:   # condition: (number of remaining kingdoms)*b > a\n                  ans += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n\n          Then output ans.\n\n      But note: the initial ans is set to \"sum(xs)*b\", which is the cost without moving. We are going to update it.\n\n      The current code:\n\n          ans = sum(xs)*b   # without moving\n\n          Then we iterate and we want to subtract the saving we get by moving? \n\n      Alternatively, we can compute from scratch.\n\n      The current code sets ans = sum(xs)*b, and then we are going to subtract the saving? \n\n      But the greedy above is additive.\n\n      How to reconcile?\n\n      We can do:\n\n          cap = 0\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\n                  total += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n\n          ans = total\n\n      But the initial code sets ans = sum(xs)*b, which is b * (x0+x1+...+x_{n-1]). \n\n      In our greedy, without moving we do: \n          total = b*x0 + b*x1 + ... + b*x_{n-1]   -> but wait, no: \n          Without moving: \n             conquer i-th kingdom: cost = b * (x_i - 0) = b*x_i.\n          So total = b * (x0+x1+...+x_{n-1])\n\n      But in the greedy, we do:\n          conquer the first kingdom: cost = b*(x0-0) = b*x0.\n          then if we don't move, conquer the second: cost = b*(x1-0) = b*x1.\n\n      So the initial ans is the cost without moving.\n\n      Then in the loop, we are going to update ans to be the total cost with moves.\n\n      But the current code has:\n\n          ans = sum(xs)*b\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              # we want to update ans to be the minimum cost\n\n      We can do:\n\n          cap = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              # We are at kingdom i, and we have conquered it from cap.\n              # But in the initial scenario, cap=0, so the cost for this kingdom is already included in ans as b*x_i.\n              # However, if we move, we will add extra cost (for moving) and then reduce future costs.\n\n              # How much do we save by moving to x_i for the future kingdoms?\n              # The future kingdoms: from i+1 to n-1: currently they are planned to be conquered from cap (which is 0 or a previous capital) at cost b*(x_j - cap) for each j>i.\n              # If we move to x_i, then the cost for j becomes b*(x_j - x_i) instead of b*(x_j - cap).\n              # The saving per future kingdom: b*(x_i - cap)\n              # Total saving for k = n-i-1 kingdoms: k * b * (x_i - cap)\n              # The cost of moving: a*(x_i - cap)\n              # So net saving = k * b * (x_i - cap) - a*(x_i - cap) = (k*b - a) * (x_i - cap)\n\n              # Therefore, if (k*b - a) > 0, we can reduce the total cost by that amount.\n\n              # But note: we haven't paid for the future kingdoms yet? \n\n          Actually, we are iterating from left to right, and we are going to update the future cost? \n\n      Alternatively, we can simulate the greedy as above.\n\n      Since the initial ans is the cost without moving, we can subtract the saving whenever we decide to move.\n\n      But the saving is only realized in the future, and we haven't computed the future in the loop? \n\n      We can do:\n\n          cap = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              # The current kingdom i: we are going to conquer it from cap, which is already accounted for in ans? \n              # Actually, no: the initial ans is the total cost without moving, but if we move, we change the cost for the current kingdom? \n\n          This is messy.\n\n      Let's change the approach: we compute the total cost from scratch.\n\n      We'll set:\n\n          total_cost = 0\n          current_capital = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total_cost += b * (xs[i] - current_capital)   # conquer kingdom i from current_capital\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\n                  # then we move the capital to xs[i]\n                  total_cost += a * (xs[i] - current_capital)\n                  current_capital = xs[i]\n\n          ans = total_cost\n\n      Then we update ans to be total_cost.\n\n      But the initial code sets ans = sum(xs)*b. We can replace that.\n\n      So the missing code in the loop:\n\n          total_cost = 0\n          cap = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\n                  total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n\n          ans = total_cost\n\n      But note: the variable 'cum' is defined and not used. We can remove it.\n\n      Therefore, the code for program1.py:\n\n          n,a,b=map(int,input().split())\n          xs=list(map(int,input().split()))\n          # cum=0   # we don't need cum\n          # ans=sum(xs)*b   # we are going to recalc\n          cap = 0\n          total_cost = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i) * b > a:\n                  total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n          ans = total_cost\n\n      Then print(ans)\n\n      Let's test with the example: \n          n=5, a=6, b=3, xs=[1,5,6,21,30]\n          i0: cap=0, total_cost += 3*(1-0)=3 -> total_cost=3; condition: (5-1-0=4)*3=12>6 -> true, so add 6*(1-0)=6, total_cost=9, cap=1.\n          i1: cap=1, total_cost += 3*(5-1)=12 -> total_cost=21; condition: (5-1-1=3)*3=9>6 -> true, add 6*(5-1)=24, total_cost=45, cap=5.\n          i2: cap=5, total_cost += 3*(6-5)=3 -> total_cost=48; condition: (5-1-2=2)*3=6>6 -> false? (6>6 is false) -> skip.\n          i3: cap=5, total_cost += 3*(21-5)=48 -> total_cost=96; condition: (5-1-3=1)*3=3<6 -> skip.\n          i4: cap=5, total_cost += 3*(30-5)=75 -> total_cost=171.\n\n      So it matches.\n\n      But note: the condition is (n-1-i) * b > a, and we use i from 0 to n-1.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          cap = 0\n          total_cost = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\n                  total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n          ans = total_cost\n\n      We replace the TODO and the following lines.\n\n      The original code had:\n          for i in range(n):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace the loop.\n\n      But note: the variable 'cum' is defined and not used. We can remove it.\n\n      So the code for program1.py becomes:\n\n          n,a,b=map(int,input().split())\n          xs=list(map(int,input().split()))\n          cap = 0\n          total_cost = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\n                  total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n          ans = total_cost\n\n      Then print(ans)\n\n      But note: the condition (n-1-i)*b > a: we use (n-1-i) because there are (n-1-i) kingdoms after i (from i+1 to n-1).\n\n      This is the number of remaining kingdoms.\n\n      We output the code for program1.py as a string.\n\nFor program2.py:\n  The problem: minimum moves to make array b increasing. We start with b_i=0 for all i. In one move, we can choose an index i and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\n\n  We want b to be strictly increasing: b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\n  The provided code:\n\n      n=int(input())\n      a=list(map(int,input().split()))\n      ans=float(\"inf\")\n      for i in range(len(a)):\n          t=[0]*n\n          temp=0\n          j=i-1\n          prev =0\n          while j>=0:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          k=i+1\n          prev=0\n          while k<len(a):\n              x=(ceil((prev+1)/a[k]))\n              temp+=x\n              prev=(a[k]*x)\n              k+=1\n          ans=min(ans,temp)\n\n  We need to fill the while loop for j (from i-1 down to 0).\n\n  The idea: \n      We fix an index i to be the \"free\" point? Or we are considering that we do not change b_i? \n\n      Actually, the problem: we can do any number of moves on any index. The moves on index i can be positive or negative.\n\n      The known solution: \n          We note that we can set b_i arbitrarily. We want to minimize the total moves.\n\n          We can set b_i = c_i * a_i, where c_i is an integer (positive or negative). The total moves is the sum of |c_i|.\n\n          The constraints: b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\n          We can use dynamic programming: \n              dp[i][j] = minimum moves for the first i+1 elements such that b_i = j * a_i   (but j can be any integer, and the range is huge)\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a greedy method.\n\n      The provided code iterates i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it sets b_i to 0? and then adjusts the left and right.\n\n      Specifically, for a fixed i, we set b_i = 0 (so we do 0 moves for index i). Then we adjust the left part (j from i-1 down to 0) to be strictly increasing and then the right part (k from i+1 to n-1) to be strictly increasing.\n\n      For the right part: \n          k from i+1 to n-1:\n            We set b_{k} to be the smallest value greater than b_{k-1} that is of the form multiple of a_k (because we can only add multiples of a_k). \n            Specifically, we require b_k > b_{k-1]. \n            We set: \n                x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])   # prev is the last b_{k-1]\n                then b_k = a[k] * x\n                and we add x moves (because we add a_k, x times).\n\n      Similarly, for the left part (j from i-1 down to 0), we require b_j < b_{j+1]. \n          We want to set b_j to the largest value less than b_{j+1] that is of the form multiple of a_j.\n\n          How to compute? \n            We start from j = i-1, and we have the next value (to the right) is b_{j+1] (which we have set to some value, initially for j=i-1, the next is b_i=0).\n\n          We require b_j < b_{j+1]. \n          We can set b_j = - a_j * y, for some positive integer y, such that b_j < b_{j+1] and we want to minimize y (to minimize moves) and also we want b_j to be as large as possible (to make it easier for the next left).\n\n          Actually, we want the largest multiple of a_j (by negative multiples) that is less than b_{j+1]. \n          The largest multiple of a_j that is less than b_{j+1] is: \n              Let y_min = ceil(( - b_{j+1] + 1) / a_j)   ??? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We want b_j = - a_j * y, and we require:\n                -a_j * y < b_{j+1]   =>   a_j * y > -b_{j+1] \n            But note: if b_{j+1] is positive, then we can set y=0? then b_j=0, but then 0 < b_{j+1] (if b_{j+1]>0) -> valid. But we want to minimize moves? \n\n          Actually, we want to minimize the total moves, which is the sum of |c_i| = |y| for the left.\n\n          We want the largest b_j (which is the least negative) that is less than b_{j+1]. \n\n          The largest multiple of a_j that is <= b_{j+1] - 1? \n\n          But note: we can also use positive multiples? The problem allows adding or subtracting. So we can set b_j to any multiple of a_j, positive or negative.\n\n          We want the largest multiple of a_j that is strictly less than b_{j+1]. \n\n          How to compute? \n            Let m = floor((b_{j+1] - 1) / a_j)   # then the multiple is a_j * m, and we require m to be integer.\n\n          Then the number of moves for j is |m|? But wait, if m is positive, we add a_j, m times. If m is negative, we subtract a_j, |m| times. The moves = |m|.\n\n          However, we can also set b_j = a_j * m, and then the moves = |m|.\n\n          But note: we want the largest multiple less than b_{j+1]. \n\n          Example: \n              a_j = 2, b_{j+1] = 5.\n              multiples: ... -2,0,2,4,6 -> the largest multiple <5 is 4, which is m=2 -> moves=2.\n\n          How to compute m? \n              m = floor((b_{j+1]-1) / a_j)   -> (5-1)/2 = 4/2=2 -> m=2.\n\n          But if b_{j+1] is negative? \n              a_j=2, b_{j+1] = -3.\n              We want the largest multiple of 2 that is < -3: that is -4? \n              m = floor((-3-1)/2) = floor(-4/2)=floor(-2)=-2 -> then multiple = 2*(-2) = -4 -> valid.\n\n          So the moves for j: |m|.\n\n          Then we set b_j = a_j * m.\n\n          Then we go to j-1, and we set b_{j-1] to be the largest multiple of a_{j-1] that is < b_j.\n\n      Therefore, the code for the left part:\n\n          j = i-1\n          prev = 0   # but note: at j=i-1, the next value (to the right) is b_i=0.\n          while j>=0:\n              # We want the largest multiple of a[j] that is < prev (which is the next value to the right, i.e., b_{j+1])\n              # But note: the variable 'prev' for the left part: we are going from j+1 to j, so the next value is b_{j+1] which we just set.\n\n              # How to compute m: \n                  m = (prev - 1) // a[j]   # floor division? But if negative, we need to be careful.\n\n              However, floor division in Python for negative numbers rounds toward -infinity, but we want the floor of (prev-1)/a[j] which is the largest integer m such that a[j]*m <= prev-1.\n\n              But note: if (prev-1) is negative, then we want the largest integer m (which is negative) such that a[j]*m <= prev-1.\n\n              We can do: \n                  m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n                  if (prev-1) % a[j] != 0 and (prev-1) < 0:\n                      m = (prev-1) // a[j] + 1   # no, we want floor: for negative, floor is the next lower integer.\n\n              Actually, we can use math.floor, but the numbers can be huge.\n\n              Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                  m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n                  # But if (prev-1) is negative and not divisible, then (prev-1)//a[j] is the floor? \n                  # Example: (prev-1) = -4, a[j]=2 -> (-4)//2 = -2 -> which is the floor -> then multiple = 2*(-2) = -4, which is <= -4 -> but we want strictly less than prev? \n                  # Actually, we want strictly less than prev. \n                  # We have: a[j]*m <= prev-1 < prev, so it is strictly less.\n\n              But note: if (prev-1) is divisible by a[j], then m = (prev-1)//a[j] and a[j]*m = prev-1, which is strictly less than prev.\n\n              So we can do:\n\n                  m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n                  # But wait: if (prev-1) is negative, and a[j] is positive, then (prev-1)//a[j] is negative and we get the floor.\n\n              However, the problem: a[j] is positive (given: positive integers).\n\n              So we can do:\n\n                  m = (prev - 1) // a[j]   # because a[j] is positive, floor division is correct.\n\n              Then the number of moves for j is |m|? \n                  But note: if m is negative, we do |m| moves (subtract a[j] |m| times) and if positive, we do m moves (add a[j] m times).\n\n              So moves = abs(m)\n\n              Then we set prev = a[j] * m   # because we set b_j = a[j]*m.\n\n              Then j -= 1.\n\n          Then we add the moves for the left to temp.\n\n      But note: the variable 'prev' in the left part: we start at j=i-1, and the next value is b_i=0, so we set:\n\n          prev = 0   # for the first j (i-1)\n\n      Then for j=i-1:\n          m = (0 - 1) // a[j] = (-1) // a[j] \n          Since a[j]>=1, (-1)//a[j] = -1? because -1//1 = -1, -1//2 = -1 (floor division).\n\n          Then moves = abs(-1)=1.\n          Then set prev = a[j] * (-1) = -a[j]\n\n      Then for j=i-2: \n          m = (prev - 1) // a[j] = (-a_j_prev - 1) // a[j]\n\n      This seems correct.\n\n      Therefore, the code for the left part:\n\n          j = i-1\n          prev = 0   # the value of b_{j+1] (which is b_i) is 0.\n          while j>=0:\n              # compute m = (prev-1) // a[j]\n              m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n              # But note: we want the largest multiple of a[j] that is < prev, and m is defined as above.\n              temp += abs(m)\n              prev = a[j] * m\n              j -= 1\n\n      Then the right part is already provided.\n\n      Then we update ans = min(ans, temp)\n\n      However, note: the right part uses:\n\n          k=i+1\n          prev=0   # because we set b_i=0\n          while k<len(a):\n              x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])   # the smallest integer x such that a[k]*x >= prev+1\n              temp += x\n              prev = a[k] * x\n              k += 1\n\n      This is for the right part: we set b_k to the smallest multiple of a[k] that is greater than b_{k-1] (which is stored in prev).\n\n      The total moves for the entire array when we fix index i to be 0 is: left_moves + 0 (for i) + right_moves.\n\n      Then we iterate i over all indices.\n\n      Why is this correct? \n          We are trying every index i to be set to 0 moves (i.e., b_i=0). Then we adjust the left and right accordingly.\n\n      But note: we might not set any index to 0? However, the problem does not require b_i to be 0. But we are allowed to set it to 0 by doing 0 moves? \n\n      Actually, we start with b_i=0, so we don't need to do any move to set it to 0.\n\n      But is it optimal to set one index to 0? \n\n          Consider: we might set an index to a nonzero value with fewer moves? \n\n          However, the problem: we are iterating over every index i and setting b_i=0, and then computing the moves for the rest. Then we take the minimum.\n\n      This is a known solution for similar problems (like \"Increasing Sequence\") and it runs in O(n^2) which is acceptable for n<=5000? \n\n      But note: the constraints: n<=5000, and we iterate over i (n iterations) and each iteration does O(n). So total O(n^2)=25e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          while j>=0:\n              m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n              temp += abs(m)\n              prev = a[j] * m\n              j -= 1\n\n      We must be cautious: integer division for negative numbers.\n\n      Example: \n          a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]   from the example note: \n          Example1: we can do: \n              b0 = -1 (by subtracting 1: 1 move)\n              b1 = 0 (0 moves? but we set it to 0? but we are iterating i. For i=1: set b1=0, then left: j=0: \n                  prev = 0, then m = (0-1)//a[0] = (-1)//1 = -1 -> moves=1, then set prev = a[0]*(-1) = -1.\n              Then right: k=2: \n                  x = ceil((0+1)/a[2]) = ceil(1/1)=1 -> moves=1, prev=1\n              k=3: ceil((1+1)/2)=ceil(2/2)=1 -> moves=1, prev=2\n              k=4: ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3 -> moves=3, prev=3\n              total moves = 1 (left) + 1 (for k=2) + 1 (k=3) + 3 (k=4) = 6? \n          But the example says 4 moves.\n\n      Why? \n\n          The example says: \n              subtract a1 from b1: but note the array a: a0=1, a1=2, a2=1, a3=2, a4=1.\n              They did: \n                  b0 = -1 (by subtracting a0: 1 move)\n                  b1 = 0 (by doing nothing? but we set b1=0 by 0 moves? but the problem: initially 0, so we don't need to do anything? \n                  b2 = 3? -> no, they added a2: 1 move? \n                  b3 = 4: add a3: 1 move\n                  b4 = 5: add a4: 1 move -> total 1+0+1+1+1=4.\n\n          In our method for i=1 (index1, which is the second element) we set b1=0. Then:\n              left: j=0: we set b0 to the largest multiple of a0=1 that is <0 -> that is -1. So we do 1 move (m=-1, |m|=1).\n              right: \n                  k=2: we set b2 to the smallest multiple of a2=1 that is >0: which is 1 -> 1 move.\n                  k=3: then set b3 to the smallest multiple of a3=2 that is >1: which is 2? but 2>1 -> 1 move? but then we require strictly increasing: 1<2 -> valid. But then b4: smallest multiple of a4=1 that is >2: 3 -> 3 moves? \n              total = 1 (left) + 1 (k=2) + 1 (k=3) + 3 (k=4) = 6.\n\n          Why 3 moves for b4? Because we set b4=3, which requires 3 moves (add 3 times).\n\n          But we can set b4=3 by adding 3 times? \n\n          However, the example did 1 move for b4: they set b4=5? \n\n          Actually, the example: \n              [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5 ] \n              So they set b2=3, b3=4, b4=5.\n\n          In our right part for k=2: \n              We set b2 to 1? but then we have b1=0, b2=1 -> valid.\n              Then for k=3: we set b3 to the smallest multiple of 2 that is >1: that is 2 -> 1 move (add once) -> then b3=2.\n              Then for k=4: we set b4 to the smallest multiple of 1 that is >2: that is 3 -> 1 move? because we add once? \n\n          But then we get [ -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> which is increasing, and moves=1 (left) + 1 (k=2) + 1 (k=3) + 1 (k=4) = 4.\n\n          How did we get 3 for k=4? \n\n          The code for the right part:\n\n              x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n\n          For k=4: \n              prev = b3 = 2\n              then x = ceil((2+1)/1) = ceil(3)=3 -> then we add 3 moves? \n\n          But that is not correct. We want the smallest x such that a[k]*x > prev. \n          Condition: 1*x > 2 -> x>2 -> smallest integer x=3.\n\n          But we can also set b4=3 by adding 3 times? \n\n          However, we can also set b4=3 by adding 3 times? \n\n          But note: the moves for index4 is |x|, and x=3, so 3 moves.\n\n          Why did the example do 1 move? \n\n          The example says: they added a4 to b4 once? but then b4=1? which is not greater than 4? \n\n          Actually, the example: \n              \"subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" \n              The array a: \n                  a0=1 -> b0: subtract once -> -1\n                  a1=2 -> b1: subtract once? but they did subtract a1 from b1: so b1 = 0 - 2 = -2? \n              But then they say the final array: [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so they did not subtract from b1? \n\n          The example: \n              \"Example1: you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively.

The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\"\n\n          They are using 1-indexed: \n              a_1 = a0? or a1?\n\n          In the input: the array a: [1,2,1,2,1] for n=5.\n\n          If 1-indexed:\n              a_1 = 1, a_2=2, a_3=1, a_4=2, a_5=1.\n\n          Then:\n              subtract a_1 from b_1: so b1 (which is the first element) becomes 0 - 1 = -1 -> 1 move.\n              add a_3 to b_3: b3 (third element) becomes 0+1=1 -> but they say 3? \n              add a_4 to b_4: b4 becomes 0+2=2\n              add a_5 to b_5: b5 becomes 0+1=1 -> then we have [-1,0,1,2,1] -> not increasing.\n\n          How to get [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5]? \n              b1: -1\n              b2: 0 (by default? but we didn't do any move? but initially 0) -> but then we have b1=-1, b2=0 -> valid.\n              b3: 3: we add a_3 (which is 1) three times: 3 moves -> total moves=1+3=4.\n              b4: 4: we would need to add a_4 twice: but that would be 2 more moves -> total 6.\n              b5: 5: add a_5 five times: 5 moves.\n\n          So it's not 4.\n\n      I think the example is: \n          Input: \n              5\n              1 2 1 2 1\n          Output: 4\n\n      And one optimal solution is:\n          b0 = -1 (by subtracting a0: 1 move)\n          b1 = 0 (0 moves)\n          b2 = 3 (by adding a2 three times: 3 moves)  -> total 4 moves.\n          b3 and b4: we don't need to change? but then b2=3, b3=0 -> not increasing.\n\n      Or we do:\n          b0 = -1 (1 move)\n          b1 = 0 (0 moves)\n          b2 = 1 (1 move) -> then b3=2 (1 move) -> then b4=3 (1 move) -> total 4 moves? \n          But then we have [-1,0,1,2,3] -> increasing.\n\n      How many moves: 1+0+1+1+1=4.\n\n      And this is achieved by:\n          b0: subtract a0 (1 move) -> -1.\n          b1: 0 (0 moves)\n          b2: add a2 (1 move) -> 1.\n          b3: add a3 (1 move) -> 2.\n          b4: add a4 (1 move) -> 3.\n\n      But then b4= a4 * 3? -> no, we added once: b4=0+1=1? \n\n      We have a4=1, so adding once: 1.\n\n      To get b4=3, we add three times: 3 moves.\n\n      How to get b4=3 with 1 move? we cannot.\n\n      But wait: the moves are per index: we can do multiple moves on the same index.\n\n      For b2: we can add three times: 3 moves -> b2=3.\n      For b3: we can add twice: 2 moves -> b3=4? \n      For b4: we can add five times: 5 moves -> b4=5.\n\n      Total 1+3+2+5=11.\n\n      Or: \n          b0: -1 (1 move)\n          b1: 0 (0 moves)\n          b2: 3 (3 moves) -> total 4 moves, and then b3 and b4 are 0, which is not increasing.\n\n      We must have b3 > b2=3, so we need to change b3.\n\n      Therefore, the example output of 4 moves might be for a different configuration.\n\n      Given the confusion, we trust the algorithm described in the code.\n\n      The right part is provided and uses:\n\n          x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n\n      And then moves += x, and then set prev = a[k]*x.\n\n      For the left part, we do:\n\n          m = (prev-1) // a[j]   [since a[j] is positive]\n\n      And then moves += abs(m), and set prev = a[j]*m.\n\n      This should be correct.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          while j>=0:\n              m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\n              temp += abs(m)\n              prev = a[j] * m\n              j -= 1\n\n      We output that.\n\nFor program3.py:\n  This is a computational geometry problem. The region S is the set of points Q inside the polygon such that there exists a chord of length at most 1 passing through Q.\n\n  The provided code is complex and has a function binary_find and get_area.\n\n  The TODO in binary_find is in the inner while loop for mid_a.\n\n  The code:\n\n      while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n          mid_a = ra / 2.0 + la / 2.0\n          yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          if yy > mid_y:\n              ra = mid_a\n\n  We are doing a binary search on mid_a in the interval [la, ra] to find the value such that yy == mid_y.\n\n  The condition: \n      if yy < mid_y: then we want to adjust la or ra?\n\n  We are trying to find mid_a such that yy = mid_y.\n\n  If yy < mid_y, then we need to increase yy. How can we increase yy? \n      We have: \n          yy = - [ sin^2(mid_a) * cos(alpha_1+mid_a) ] / sin(alpha_1)\n\n      Since sin(alpha_1) is positive (because alpha_1 is an angle in the polygon, and from the problem it's in [90,180) -> so in radians [pi/2, pi) -> sin(alpha_1) is positive in [pi/2, pi) (because sin(pi/2)=1, sin(pi)=0, and it's nonnegative in [0,pi]).\n\n      The negative sign: so yy is the negative of a positive quantity? then yy is negative.\n\n      We are comparing yy and mid_y, which is also negative (because in the binary_find, we set cy and fy to min(alpha_1, alpha_2) and 0.0000, but then we do:\n\n          cy = min(alpha_1, alpha_2)   # but wait, in the call: cy, fy = min(alpha_1, alpha_2), 0.0000 -> but then we do:\n\n          while math.fabs(cy - fy) > eps:   # cy and fy are the current bounds for y? \n          mid_y = (cy+fy)/2\n\n      And initially, cy = min(alpha_1, alpha_2) (which is an angle in radians, between 0 and pi) and fy=0. So mid_y is between 0 and min(alpha_1, alpha_2).\n\n      But then we compute yy, which is negative. And we compare yy (negative) and mid_y (positive). Then yy < mid_y is always true.\n\n      That cannot be.\n\n  Let me check the call:\n\n      la, lb, ra, rb, cy, fy = 0.0, 0.0, pi - alpha_1, pi - alpha_2, min(alpha_1, alpha_2), 0.0000\n\n      Then we do:\n\n          while math.fabs(cy - fy) > eps:   # cy is min(alpha_1, alpha_2) (positive), fy=0 (positive) -> so we enter the loop.\n\n          mid_y = (cy+fy)/2   # a positive number.\n\n      Then we compute yy, which is negative.\n\n      Then we compare:\n          if yy < mid_y:   # negative < positive -> true, so we do ...?\n\n      Then if yy > mid_y:   # false.\n\n      So we always take the first branch.\n\n      Then the TODO: what to do when yy < mid_y?\n\n      We are binary searching for mid_a in [la, ra] to achieve yy = mid_y.\n\n      If yy < mid_y, and since yy is negative and mid_y is positive, we are below the target. We want to increase yy (make it less negative). \n\n      How to increase yy? \n          yy = - [ sin^2(mid_a) * cos(alpha_1+mid_a) ] / sin(alpha_1)\n\n      We can increase yy by making the term [ sin^2(mid_a) * cos(alpha_1+mid_a) ] smaller (because of the negative sign).\n\n      The function is complicated. We are binary searching on mid_a in [0, pi - alpha_1] (because initially ra = pi - alpha_1).\n\n      We might need to adjust la or ra.\n\n      In the branch for yy < mid_y, we want to increase yy. So we should adjust the interval to try a larger yy. How?\n\n      Without knowing the monotonicity of yy with respect to mid_a, it is hard.\n\n  Alternatively, we can look at the other branch in the symmetric part: for the other angle, we have:\n\n      while math.fabs(rb - lb) > eps:\n          mid_b = (rb+lb)/2\n          yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_b), 2) * math.cos(alpha_2 + mid_b) / math.sin(alpha_2)\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              lb = mid_b\n          if yy > mid_y:\n              rb = mid_b\n\n  In this branch, when yy < mid_y, we set lb = mid_b, meaning we are increasing mid_b? \n\n  And in the first branch, we have:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: \n          ... \n      if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  By symmetry, in the first branch, if yy < mid_y, we should set la = mid_a? or ra = mid_a?\n\n  But in the second branch, when yy < mid_y, we set lb = mid_b, which is the lower bound to mid_b, so we are increasing the variable.\n\n  In the first branch, if we want to increase yy, and if yy is an increasing function of mid_a, then we should set la = mid_a to increase mid_a.\n\n  But we don't know.\n\n  However, the code in the second branch for the other angle is provided and we see:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: lb = mid_b   -> we are moving the lower bound up, so we are searching in [mid_b, rb] next.\n      if yy > mid_y: rb = mid_b\n\n  So for the first branch, we should do the same:\n\n      if yy < mid_y: \n          la = mid_a\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  But wait, in the first branch we have two if's, not elif. So if the first if is taken, the second if might also be checked? \n\n  The code has:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          # TODO\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  We need to do one or the other.\n\n  In the second branch, it is:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          lb = mid_b\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          rb = mid_b\n\n  This is acceptable because if yy==mid_y, we break? but we don't have an explicit break. We rely on the while loop condition.\n\n  But if yy is not equal, we set either lb or rb.\n\n  In the first branch, we should do:\n\n      if yy < mid_y:\n          la = mid_a\n      if yy > mid_y:\n          ra = mid_a\n\n  But note: the first if and the second if are not exclusive? Actually, if yy < mid_y, then we set la=mid_a, and then we also check if yy>mid_y? which is false, so we don't set ra.\n\n  So it's safe.\n\n  Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              la = mid_a\n\n  And then we leave the rest.\n\n  So the code for program3.py for the TODO is:\n\n          if yy < mid_y:\n              la = mid_a\n\n  We output that.\n\n  But note: the function binary_find is not complete. However, the problem only asks for the TODO part.\n\nSummary:\n\n  We output a JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    cap = 0\\n    total_cost = 0\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\\n        if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\\n            total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\\n            cap = xs[i]\\n    ans = total_cost\",\n        \"program2\": \"        m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\\n        temp += abs(m)\\n        prev = a[j] * m\\n        j -= 1\",\n        \"program3\": \"            la = mid_a\"\n      }\n\n  But note: in program1, we must be careful: the variable 'cum' is not used, so we remove it. We replace the entire for loop.\n\n  In program2, we fill the while loop for j.\n\n  In program3, we fill the if branch.\n\n  Let's write the exact code strings.\n\n  For program1, the missing code is the entire for loop body replacement? Actually, the original code had:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO and the following (which is nothing) with the 7 lines.\n\n  But note: the original code had a variable 'cum' that is not used. We can leave it or remove it. Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we output the block that replaces from the for loop.\n\n  We output the entire block for the for loop.\n\n  For program2, the while loop body: we output 4 lines.\n\n  For program3, the single line.\n\n  Format: we must output the code as a string in JSON.\n\n  We must escape quotes? The problem says: output only the missing code, and in the specified JSON.\n\n  We write:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    cap = 0\\n    total_cost = 0\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\\n        if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\\n            total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\\n            cap = xs[i]\\n    ans = total_cost\",\n        \"program2\": \"        m = (prev - 1) // a[j]\\n        temp += abs(m)\\n        prev = a[j] * m\\n        j -= 1\",\n        \"program3\": \"            la = mid_a\"\n      }\n\n  But note: in program1, the last line in the for loop is \"ans = total_cost\", which sets the final answer. The original code had \"ans = sum(xs)*b\", and then the for loop. We are replacing the for loop and then setting ans to total_cost.\n\n  However, the original code had the for loop and then after the for loop, it prints ans. We are setting ans = total_cost after the for loop, but inside the for loop we are not setting ans. \n\n  Actually, we are not inside the for loop for the last line? \n\n  The structure:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          ...   # 7 lines of code, including the for i in range(n) body.\n\n      But our code for the for loop body is 7 lines? \n\n      We have:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              total_cost += ... \n              if ...:\n                  ...\n\n          ans = total_cost   # this is after the for loop.\n\n      But the original code had the for loop and then after the for loop, it printed ans.\n\n      We are replacing the entire for loop and then setting ans? \n\n      But the original for loop was:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              # TODO\n\n      We are replacing the TODO with 7 lines, but the last line \"ans = total_cost\" is not indented? \n\n      Actually, the original code after the for loop is:\n\n          print(ans)\n\n      We want to set ans = total_cost after the for loop? \n\n      But our code does:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              ...   # 6 lines of indented code\n\n          ans = total_cost   # unindented\n\n      Then the existing print(ans) will print it.\n\n      So the entire block for program1 is:\n\n          cap = 0\n          total_cost = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              total_cost += b * (xs[i] - cap)\n              if i < n-1 and (n-1-i)*b > a:\n                  total_cost += a * (xs[i] - cap)\n                  cap = xs[i]\n          ans = total_cost\n\n      But note: the variable 'cum' is defined above and not used. We can ignore it.\n\n  Therefore, we output the above string.\n\n  For program2, the while loop body is 4 lines, properly indented.\n\n  For program3, the single line: \"            la = mid_a\", with the same indentation as the if.\n\n  We output the JSON."
