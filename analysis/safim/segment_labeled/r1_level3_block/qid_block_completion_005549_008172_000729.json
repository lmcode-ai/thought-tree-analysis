Actually, the precomputation for queryR for a point p (in the reverse order) is:\n\n   j = i (the index in `positions` that is the last one <= p)\n   q = 1\n   for x in lamps[::-1]:   # going from rightmost lamp to leftmost\n        if x > p: continue   # skip lamps to the right of p\n        # then we update the positions from the current j down to the next position? while x < positions[j]:\n            queries[j] = q\n            j -= 1\n        q = q * (p - x) % MOD Then we set the remaining positions (to the left) to q. So queryR[i][j] for a fixed point i and position j (which is an index in `positions`) is the product for all lanterns that are <= p and that are at positions >= positions[j]? Actually, the while loop condition: we start at j (which is the index of the last position <= p) and then we move j to the left until we hit a position that is <= x? Actually, the lamps are processed in decreasing order. For a lamp x (<=p), we update the positions from j down to the next position that is <= x? Actually, the condition is: while x < positions[j] -> then we set queries[j] = q and then j decreases. But note: we are going from high positions to low. So for a lamp x, we update all positions j that are above x (i.e., positions[j] > x) to the current product? Then when we see a lamp at x, we update the positions that are above x to the current product (which includes all lamps we've seen so far). Then we multiply by (p-x) for the current lamp. Therefore, queryR[i][j] (for point i and position j) is the product for all lanterns that are <= p and that are strictly greater than positions[j]? Actually, it's the product for all lanterns that are <= p and that are > positions[j]? Because when we are at position j, we have included all lamps that are >= positions[j]? Actually, the update: we set queries[j] = q at the moment when we are at a lamp x and we are at a position j such that x < positions[j] (so we haven't included x in the product for positions[j] and above). Then we set the product for positions[j] to the current q (which does not include x) and then we move j down. Then we include x by multiplying by (p-x). Then we continue. This is confusing. Alternatively, the intended meaning of the precomputation arrays:\n\nFor a fixed point p (with coordinate p):\n   - queryL: for a position x (>= p), the product of (lantern - p) for all lanterns that are > p and <= x? Actually, no: the product for the entire set of lanterns to the right of p? But then why the while loop?",

Actually, for the interval [A, B], we break at mid. The left part [A, mid] is handled by the right array of the previous point? Or the left array of the previous point? But note: the previous point is A, and we are in the interval [A, B]. The left part [A, mid] is to the right of A, so we use queryL for A at position mid? And the right part [mid, B] is to the left of B, so we use queryR for B at position mid? Therefore, we would do:\n\n   left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]   # for point A: lanterns to the right of A and <= mid\n   right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]         # for point B: lanterns to the left of B and >= mid\n\n   q = q * left_val % MOD\n   q = q * right_val % MOD And then we record the keys for the Fenwick-style accumulation later?

The type 0 for left and 1 for right? In the first point: type=1 (right) for point i at position 0. In the last point: type=0 (left) for point prev_idx at the last position.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe missing part is inside the loop for the mask. We are iterating over masks for the inclusion-exclusion principle. The code must handle the case when we have consecutive points in the mask.\n\nWe note that the current code for the mask loop has a TODO. The idea is that when we have a mask with multiple points, we need to consider the intervals between consecutive points. The current code handles the first point (using queryR for the leftmost point) and the last point (using queryL for the rightmost point). For the middle, we have consecutive points and we need to consider the midpoint.\n\nIn the provided code, when we have a new point in the mask (i) and we have a previous point (prev_idx), we need to compute the product for the interval between the two points. The midpoint between the two points (prev and current) is already computed and stored in the list `positions`. We need to find the index in `positions` for the midpoint and then use the precomputed arrays for the left and right parts.\n\nSpecifically, the code for the middle part should:\n1. Find the midpoint between the previous point (points[prev_idx]) and the current point (points[i]).\n2. Find the index in `positions` for that midpoint (or the next one? note we stored mid and mid+1). Actually, we stored both mid and mid+1. But note: the condition for illumination in the middle is that the lantern must cover both points. The constraint is that the lantern must cover the entire gap. The product for the interval [prev, current] is stored in the precomputed arrays for the left part of the current point and the right part of the previous point? Actually, the code has two arrays: queryL and queryR.\n\nLooking at the precomputation:\n- For a fixed point p (in the points list), we precomputed:\n   - queryL[i] for each position in `positions`: for the right part (lanterns to the right of p) and for a given position x (which is in `positions`), the product of min(|lantern - p|, lantern - p) for all lanterns to the right? Actually, the product for the right part is the product over lanterns to the right of p of (lantern - p) until the next position? But note the while loops.\n\nActually, the precomputation for a point p (for the right part, i.e., queryL) is:\n  We start at the first position in `positions` that is >= p (index i). Then we iterate over the lamps that are > p (in increasing order). For each lamp x, we update the product for all positions j (from the current j to the next position) to be the product of (x-p) for all lamps so far? But note: the product is cumulative.\n\nSimilarly, for queryR (for the left part) we do the same for lamps <= p.\n\nNow, for two consecutive points in the mask: let the previous point be A and the current point be B (with A < B). The condition for a lantern to cover both A and B is that the lantern must be at a position x such that:\n   |x - A| <= power and |x - B| <= power\nThis is equivalent to: power >= max(|x-A|, |x-B|) = max(x-A, B-x) [if x is between A and B, then it's max(x-A, B-x)].\n\nBut note: the lanterns are fixed. The problem is that we are counting the number of ways to assign powers. The key is that the assignment for a lantern at x must be at least the distance to the farthest point of interest that it covers. However, in the inclusion-exclusion we are breaking the segment by the midpoints.\n\nThe idea in the code is that for the interval [A, B], we break at the midpoint M = (A+B)//2. Then:\n  - For lanterns in [A, M]: the constraint for covering both A and B is that the power must be at least (B - lantern) [because B - lantern >= lantern - A in this half].\n  - For lanterns in [M, B]: the constraint is at least (lantern - A).\n\nBut note: the precomputation for a point p (say for the right part) was for the product of (lantern - p) for lanterns to the right of p. Similarly, for the left part, the product of (p - lantern) for lanterns to the left.\n\nHowever, in the middle between A and B, we have two constraints: the lantern must cover both A and B. So the required power for a lantern at x is at least:\n   max( |x-A|, |x-B| ) = \n        if x <= M: |x-B| = B - x\n        if x >= M: |x-A| = x - A\n\nBut note: the product for the entire assignment is the product over lanterns of (d+1) minus the constraints? Actually, the assignment for each lantern is independent? However, the condition is that the lantern must cover the points. But note: the problem counts the number of ways to assign powers (each lantern independently chooses a power from 0 to d) such that every point is covered.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion by mask of points (which points are not covered) is being used. The value q for a mask is the product over the intervals of the number of ways that the lanterns in that interval can be assigned without covering the points? Actually, the opposite: the inclusion-exclusion counts the assignments that fail to cover the points in the mask? Or cover at least the points in the mask? The problem says: every point of interest must be illuminated. The inclusion-exclusion is over the set of points that are not covered? Actually, the standard inclusion-exclusion for covering all points is:\n   Sum_{S subset of points} (-1)^{|S|} * [ways that at least the points in S are not covered]\n\nBut note the sign: in the code, for a mask (which represents a set S of points that are not covered), we are adding or subtracting. The sign is (-1)^(|S|). However, in the code we have:\n   if popcnt & 1: subtract q, else add q.\n\nSo q is the number of assignments that fail to cover the set S? Actually, the problem: the assignment must cover all points. The inclusion-exclusion formula is:\n   ans = Sum_{S} (-1)^{|S|} * F(S)\nwhere F(S) is the number of assignments that do not cover any point in S? Actually, no: the standard is:\n   F(S) = number of assignments that do not cover the set S? But note: we want assignments that cover all points. Then by inclusion-exclusion:\n   = Sum_{S} (-1)^{|S|} * [assignments that do not cover any point in S?] \nBut actually, it's the assignments that avoid covering the points in S? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: let A_i be the set of assignments that do not cover point i. Then we want |\u2229 A_i^c| = ... by inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSo the formula is:\n   |\u2229 A_i^c| = Sum_{S} (-1)^{|S|} * |\u2229_{i in S} A_i|\n\nBut note: |\u2229_{i in S} A_i| is the set of assignments that do not cover any point in S? Actually, no: it's the set of assignments that do not cover the points in S (but they might cover others). And note that the condition for not covering a point is independent? Actually, no, because the same lantern might be responsible for multiple points.\n\nHowever, the problem has a known solution: we break the segment by the midpoints of every pair of points. Then the entire segment is partitioned into intervals. For each interval, the constraint for a lantern in that interval is the maximum distance to the two adjacent points (from the set S) that are the boundaries of the interval? Actually, the set S is the set of points we are excluding? But in the inclusion-exclusion, we are considering a fixed set S.\n\nIn the code, for a mask S (which is a set of points that we are excluding), we break the segment into intervals:\n   [0, p_i1], [p_i1, p_i2], ... , [p_{ik-1}, p_ik], [p_ik, d]\nFor each interval, the constraint for a lantern in that interval is the distance to the farthest endpoint of the interval? And the total number of assignments that do not cover any point in S is the product over lanterns of (d+1) minus the constraint? Actually, no: the problem counts the assignments that do not cover the points in S. But note: if a lantern is in an interval [A, B] (with A and B consecutive in S), then to avoid covering A and B, the power of the lantern must be less than the required value (max(distance to A, distance to B) for that interval? Actually, the lantern must not cover A and must not cover B. So the power must be < |lantern - A| and < |lantern - B|? But that is independent? Actually, no: the condition for not covering A is power < |lantern - A|, and similarly for B. So the constraint for the lantern is that the power must be less than min(|lantern-A|, |lantern-B|)? \n\nBut wait: if the lantern is between A and B, then the condition to avoid covering A is power < (lantern - A) and to avoid covering B is power < (B - lantern). So the constraint is power < min(lantern-A, B-lantern). However, if the lantern is not between A and B, then the constraints are independent? Actually, the lantern might be to the left of A: then to avoid covering A, we require power < (A - lantern). To avoid covering B, we require power < (B - lantern). But note that (B - lantern) > (A - lantern). So the constraint is power < (A - lantern). Similarly, to the right: constraint is power < (lantern - B).\n\nBut note: the set S is the set of points we are excluding. The assignment must avoid covering any point in S. The number of choices for a lantern at x is:\n   the number of powers in [0, d] that are less than the minimum distance to any point in S? Actually, no: the condition for avoiding a point p is that the power is strictly less than |x-p|. So the condition for avoiding all points in S is that the power is strictly less than min_{p in S} |x-p|. Therefore, the number of choices for the lantern at x is: min(|x-p| for p in S) [if we consider that the power must be an integer in [0, d] and strictly less than that minimum distance]? Actually, the number of choices is min(min_{p in S}|x-p|, d+1) because if the minimum distance is greater than d, then we have d+1 choices (all powers from 0 to d). But note: the power can be 0 to d (inclusive). The condition is: power < min_dist. So the number of choices is min(min_dist, d+1). However, note that min_dist might be 0? But if there is a point at x, then min_dist=0, then we have 0 choices? But the problem states: \"a lantern with coordinate x illuminates the point of interest with coordinate y if |x-y| <= power\". So if the lantern is at the same coordinate as a point, then even with power 0 it covers (because |x-y|=0<=0). So to avoid covering, we need power < 0, which is impossible. Therefore, if there is a point at x, then we cannot avoid covering it? But note the input constraint: during each query, no coordinate contains more than one object. So if we have a lantern at x and a point at x, then they are at the same coordinate? But the constraint says: \"no coordinate contains more than one object\". So if a lantern is at the same coordinate as a point, then that point is covered? Therefore, in the inclusion-exclusion for a set S that contains that point, we cannot have the lantern at x avoid the point? So we must not have that point in S? Actually, the set S is arbitrary, but if a lantern is at the same coordinate as a point in S, then the lantern will cover that point (with any nonnegative power) so we cannot avoid. Therefore, the set S that contains a point that is at the same coordinate as a lantern must have 0 ways? \n\nBut note: the problem says that during each query, no coordinate has more than one object. So initially, the lanterns and points are at distinct coordinates? And when we add a lantern at f_i, we remove it immediately after. So during the query, we have a lantern at f_i, and the points are fixed. The constraint says: no coordinate contains more than one object. So we don't have a lantern and a point at the same coordinate.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance from a lantern at x to the set S is at least 1? Actually, the points are integers and the lanterns are integers, and they are distinct. So min_dist>=1.\n\nTherefore, the number of choices for a lantern at x to avoid all points in S is: min(min_{p in S}|x-p|, d+1) but note: the power must be an integer in [0, d] and strictly less than min_dist. So the number of choices is min(min_dist, d+1). However, if min_dist is 0, then 0 choices. But we have min_dist>=1, so the number of choices is min(min_dist, d+1). But note: if min_dist is 1, then we can choose power=0 (only one choice). If min_dist is 2, then we can choose power=0 or 1 (two choices). So the number of choices is min(min_dist, d+1). But if min_dist > d, then we have d+1 choices.\n\nTherefore, the total number of assignments that avoid covering the set S is the product over lanterns of min(min_{p in S}|x_i - p|, d+1).\n\nBut note: the problem counts the assignments that cover all points. Then by inclusion-exclusion, the answer is:\n   ans = sum_{S \u2286 points} (-1)^{|S|} * [ \u220f_{i=1}^{n} min( min_{p in S} |x_i - p|, d+1 ) ]\n\nHowever, the above product is difficult to compute because the min_{p in S} |x_i - p| depends on the entire set S. The known solution is to break the set S by the Voronoi diagram? Actually, we can sort the points in S and then the min for a lantern is determined by the two adjacent points in S. Therefore, we can break the segment [0,d] into intervals by the midpoints of consecutive points in S. Then in each interval, the min_{p in S} |x-p| is determined by the two adjacent points.\n\nIn the code, the precomputation for queryL and queryR is for the product of the distances to a fixed point for the lanterns to the right (for queryL) and to the left (for queryR). But note: the product for the entire set S is the product over the intervals. Specifically, for a fixed set S (with sorted points: p0, p1, ..., p_{k-1}), the product is:\n   [for the leftmost interval: [0, p0]]: the min distance for a lantern in [0, p0] is (p0 - lantern) -> but actually, the min distance is the distance to p0? Yes, because p0 is the closest point in S to the right? But wait, if there is a point to the left? No, because we broke at the midpoints. Actually, the min distance for a lantern in [0, p0] is (p0 - lantern). Similarly, for the rightmost interval: (lantern - p_{k-1]). For an interval [p_i, p_{i+1}], the min distance is min(lantern - p_i, p_{i+1} - lantern). And we break at the midpoint M = (p_i+p_{i+1})//2. Then for lanterns in [p_i, M]: the min distance is (lantern - p_i). For lanterns in [M, p_{i+1}]: the min distance is (p_{i+1} - lantern).\n\nTherefore, the product for the entire set S is:\n   [ \u220f_{lanterns in [0, p0]} (p0 - lantern) ] * \n   [ \u220f_{i=0}^{k-2} [ ( \u220f_{lanterns in [p_i, M_i]} (lantern - p_i) ) * ( \u220f_{lanterns in [M_i, p_{i+1}]} (p_{i+1} - lantern) ) ] ] *\n   [ \u220f_{lanterns in [p_{k-1}, d]} (lantern - p_{k-1}) ]\n\nBut note: the precomputation for a fixed point p (say p0) we have precomputed the product for the entire segment [0, p0]? Actually, in the precomputation for queryR for the point p0: we computed for each position in `positions` the product for lanterns to the left of p0? Actually, the precomputation for queryR for a point p is for lanterns to the left? And for queryL for a point p is for lanterns to the right.\n\nSpecifically, in the code:\n   For a point p (in the list of points) and for the array queryR[i] (for the point p) at a position x (which is an element of `positions`), we have the product for all lanterns that are <= p and that are in the segment [x, ...]? Actually, the precomputation for queryR for a point p (in the reverse order) is:\n\n   j = i (the index in `positions` that is the last one <= p)\n   q = 1\n   for x in lamps[::-1]:   # going from rightmost lamp to leftmost\n        if x > p: continue   # skip lamps to the right of p\n        # then we update the positions from the current j down to the next position?\n        while x < positions[j]:\n            queries[j] = q\n            j -= 1\n        q = q * (p - x) % MOD\n\n   Then we set the remaining positions (to the left) to q.\n\nSo queryR[i][j] for a fixed point i and position j (which is an index in `positions`) is the product for all lanterns that are <= p and that are at positions >= positions[j]? Actually, the while loop condition: we start at j (which is the index of the last position <= p) and then we move j to the left until we hit a position that is <= x? Actually, the lamps are processed in decreasing order. For a lamp x (<=p), we update the positions from j down to the next position that is <= x? Actually, the condition is: while x < positions[j] -> then we set queries[j] = q and then j decreases. But note: we are going from high positions to low. So for a lamp x, we update all positions j that are above x (i.e., positions[j] > x) to the current product? Then when we see a lamp at x, we update the positions that are above x to the current product (which includes all lamps we've seen so far). Then we multiply by (p-x) for the current lamp.\n\nTherefore, queryR[i][j] (for point i and position j) is the product for all lanterns that are <= p and that are strictly greater than positions[j]? Actually, it's the product for all lanterns that are <= p and that are > positions[j]? Because when we are at position j, we have included all lamps that are >= positions[j]? Actually, the update: we set queries[j] = q at the moment when we are at a lamp x and we are at a position j such that x < positions[j] (so we haven't included x in the product for positions[j] and above). Then we set the product for positions[j] to the current q (which does not include x) and then we move j down. Then we include x by multiplying by (p-x). Then we continue.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the intended meaning of the precomputation arrays:\n\nFor a fixed point p (with coordinate p):\n   - queryL: for a position x (>= p), the product of (lantern - p) for all lanterns that are > p and <= x? Actually, no: the product for the entire set of lanterns to the right of p? But then why the while loop? Actually, the product for the entire set of lanterns to the right of p is constant? But note: we break at the midpoints. The array queryL for a point p is computed for every position in `positions` (which are the midpoints and the points and 0 and d). The value at a position x (>=p) is the product of (lantern - p) for all lanterns that are > p and that are <= x? But the code:\n\n   i = 0\n   while positions[i] < p: i++   # so i is the first position >= p.\n   j = i\n   q = 1\n   for x in lamps:   # in increasing order\n        if x <= p: continue\n        # then for positions from j to the next position that is >= x, we set the product to the current q (without x) and then update q by multiplying by (x-p)\n        while x > positions[j]:\n            queries[j] = q   # so at position j (which is < x), the product is the current q (which does not include x)\n            j += 1\n        q = q * (x-p) % MOD\n   while j < len(positions):\n        queries[j] = q\n        j += 1\n\nSo for a position x (>=p), the value queryL[i][j] (where i is the index of the point p, and j is the index of the position x) is the product of (lantern-p) for all lanterns that are > p and <= x? Actually, no: the while loop condition: we update j until positions[j] is >= x? Actually, the condition is: while x > positions[j] -> then we set queries[j] = q (which is the product of the lanterns we've seen so far, which are all lanterns > p and < positions[j]?).\n\nActually, it seems that the product at a position j (which is a position in `positions`) is the product of (lantern-p) for all lanterns that are > p and that are <= the next position? This is not clear.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the problem is known to be hard, and the code is partially provided, we focus on the missing part.\n\nIn the mask loop, for consecutive points (prev_idx and i), we need to compute the product for the interval [prev, current]. The code does:\n\n   if prev_idx == -1: ... \n   else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to fill the TODO. The idea is that we have two consecutive points: A = points[prev_idx] and B = points[i]. We break at the midpoint M = (A+B)//2. Then the product for the interval [A, B] is:\n   [product for lanterns in [A, M]: (lantern - A)] * [product for lanterns in [M, B]: (B - lantern)]\n\nBut note: the lanterns are fixed and we have precomputed arrays for each point. Specifically, for the point A, we have queryR for the right part? Actually, for the point A, we have queryR[prev_idx] which is an array for positions: for a position x, it gives the product for lanterns to the left of A? But we need lanterns between A and B. \n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n   For the left part of the interval [A, M]: we can use the precomputation for point A? But note: the precomputation for point A in queryR was for lanterns to the left of A? That doesn't help for lanterns between A and B.\n\nActually, the precomputation for queryL and queryR is for the entire segment? But then how do we get the product for lanterns in [A, M] for the constraint of the interval [A, B]? \n\nLooking at the provided code for the first point in the mask: it uses queryR for the point p (the first point) at position 0? That is, for the leftmost interval [0, p0], it uses the entire product for lanterns to the left of p0? But wait, the lanterns to the left of p0 are in [0, p0]. And the constraint for the leftmost interval is (p0 - lantern). And that is exactly what queryR[0][0] is? \n\nSimilarly, for the last point, it uses queryL for the last point at the last position (d) for lanterns to the right of the last point.\n\nFor the middle interval [A, B], we break at M. We need the product for lanterns in [A, M] of (lantern - A) and for [M, B] of (B - lantern). How do we get these from the precomputation? \n\nWe have for point A: we precomputed queryL[A]? But queryL[A] is for lanterns to the right of A. And for a position x (>=A), the value is the product of (lantern - A) for lanterns that are > A and <= x? Then the product for lanterns in [A, M] (with M>=A) would be: \n   queryL[A][index(M)] / queryL[A][index(A)]? \n\nBut note: the precomputation for queryL[A] starts at the first position >=A. The value at position A (if it exists) might be 1? Because initially q=1 and then we update for lanterns above A.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute a 2D array for each point and for each midpoint? But the code already precomputed for every position in `positions`.\n\nTherefore, for the interval [A, B] with midpoint M, we can do:\n\n   mid = (A+B)//2\n   # Find the index of mid in positions -> we have posmap\n   idx_mid = posmap[mid]\n\n   # For the left part [A, M]: we want the product for lanterns in [A, M] of (lantern - A)\n   # How to get that? We have for point A: the array queryL[A] (which is for lanterns to the right of A) and we want the value at position M? But note: the array queryL[A] at position M is the product for lanterns that are > A and <= M? \n\n   # Similarly, for point B: the array queryR[B] (which is for lanterns to the left of B) at position M is the product for lanterns that are < B and >= M? \n\nBut wait, the precomputation for queryR[B] is for lanterns to the left of B. The code for queryR[B] is:\n\n   i = len(positions)-1\n   while positions[i] > p: i-- \n   j = i\n   q = 1\n   for x in lamps[::-1]:   # from right to left (decreasing)\n        if x > p: continue   # skip lanterns to the right of p\n        while x < positions[j]:   # meaning: if the current lantern x is less than positions[j], then we update the positions from j down to x?\n            queries[j] = q\n            j -= 1\n        q = q * (p - x) % MOD\n\n   Then set the rest.\n\nSo for a position j (<=B), queryR[B][j] is the product for lanterns that are <= B and that are >= positions[j]? Actually, it's the product for lanterns that are <= B and that are > positions[j]? \n\nGiven the complexity, and since the code is partially provided, we assume that the intended approach is:\n\n   For the interval [A, B]:\n        left_product = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]   # for point A (which is at index prev_idx) at position mid: this should be the product of (lantern - A) for lanterns in (A, mid]? \n        right_product = queryR[i][idx_mid]          # for point B (which is at index i) at position mid: this should be the product of (B - lantern) for lanterns in [mid, B)?\n\nBut note: the product for the entire interval [A, B] is left_product * right_product.\n\nHowever, the provided code for the first point does:\n\n   if prev_idx == -1:\n        keys.append((1, i, 0))   # (1 means right? for the first point, we use the right array? and at position 0? \n        q = q * queryR[i][0] % MOD\n\nAnd for the last point: \n   keys.append((0, prev_idx, len(positions)-1))   # 0 means left? for the last point, we use the left array at the last position?\n   q = q * queryL[prev_idx][-1] % MOD\n\nIn the middle, we would do:\n\n   mid = (points[prev_idx] + points[i]) // 2\n   idx_mid = posmap[mid]\n   # Then we want to use the left array for the previous point at the next segment? Actually, for the interval [A, B], we break at mid. The left part [A, mid] is handled by the right array of the previous point? Or the left array of the previous point? \n\nBut note: the previous point is A, and we are in the interval [A, B]. The left part [A, mid] is to the right of A, so we use queryL for A at position mid? And the right part [mid, B] is to the left of B, so we use queryR for B at position mid? \n\nTherefore, we would do:\n\n   left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]   # for point A: lanterns to the right of A and <= mid\n   right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]         # for point B: lanterns to the left of B and >= mid\n\n   q = q * left_val % MOD\n   q = q * right_val % MOD\n\n   And then we record the keys for the Fenwick-style accumulation later? The keys are for the updates in the 2D arrays for the inclusion-exclusion accumulation. The structure of keys is a list of tuples (type, point_index, position_index). The type 0 for left and 1 for right? \n\nIn the first point: type=1 (right) for point i at position 0.\nIn the last point: type=0 (left) for point prev_idx at the last position.\n\nFor the middle, we would have two keys: one for the left part of the interval [A, mid] and one for the right part [mid, B]? But the code currently appends one key per point in the mask. However, in the first point we have one key, and in the last point one key. For the middle, we have two keys? But the code appends one key per consecutive pair? \n\nActually, the code for the mask loop appends a key for each \"segment\" of the set S. The entire set S is broken into segments: the leftmost, the middle intervals, and the rightmost. For the middle intervals, we have one segment per consecutive pair.\n\nTherefore, we should append two keys for the consecutive pair: one for the left part (using queryL for A at mid) and one for the right part (using queryR for B at mid). But the code currently has a single TODO in the else block.\n\nAlternatively, we can append one key that represents the entire interval [A, B]? But the accumulation arrays are 2D: indexed by type, point index, and position index. And we are going to do a range update? \n\nLooking at the accumulation part after the mask loop:\n\n   for j in range(m):\n        for k in range(len(positions) -2, -1, -1):\n            querySums[0][j][k] = (querySums[0][j][k] + querySums[0][j][k+1]) % MOD\n        for k in range(1, len(positions)):\n            querySums[1][j][k] = (querySums[1][j][k] + querySums[1][j][k-1]) % MOD\n\nThis is a prefix/suffix sum. The array querySums[0][j] is for type 0 (left) for point j: we are doing a suffix sum (from right to left). The array querySums[1][j] is for type 1 (right) for point j: we are doing a prefix sum (from left to right).\n\nThen in the query part, when we add a new lantern at x, we update the answer by:\n\n   For j in range(m):\n        if points[j] < x:   # then we are in the right part for point j? \n            total = querySums[0][j][pos]   # type 0 (left) for point j at a position >= x? \n            ans = ans - total + total * (x - points[j])   # because the new lantern at x will be in the right of point j, and the constraint for point j is (x - points[j])? \n\n        if x <= points[j]:   # then we are in the left part for point j?\n            total = querySums[1][j][pos]   # type 1 (right) for point j at a position <= x?\n            ans = ans - total + total * (points[j] - x)\n\nThis suggests that the type 0 (left) is for lanterns to the right of the point j? And type 1 (right) is for lanterns to the left of the point j? \n\nTherefore, for the consecutive pair (A, B) with A=points[prev_idx] and B=points[i], the left part [A, mid] is handled by type 0 for point A? Because lanterns in [A, mid] are to the right of A. And the right part [mid, B] is handled by type 1 for point B? Because lanterns in [mid, B] are to the left of B.\n\nSo in the mask loop, for the consecutive pair, we should append two keys:\n\n   keys.append((0, prev_idx, idx_mid))   # type 0 for point A (prev_idx) at position mid: this will be used in querySums[0][prev_idx][idx_mid]\n   keys.append((1, i, idx_mid))          # type 1 for point B (i) at position mid\n\nAnd then update q by multiplying by left_val * right_val.\n\nBut note: the value left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid] and right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid] might be available in the precomputed arrays.\n\nTherefore, the TODO code is:\n\n   mid = (points[prev_idx] + points[i]) // 2\n   idx_mid = posmap[mid]\n   left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]\n   right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]\n   q = q * left_val % MOD\n   q = q * right_val % MOD\n   keys.append((0, prev_idx, idx_mid))\n   keys.append((1, i, idx_mid))\n\nBut note: the points are sorted. The array `points` is sorted. The prev_idx and i are indices in the sorted points.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the array `queryL` is indexed by the point index. The point index `prev_idx` is the index in the original sorted `points` array. Similarly for `i`.\n\nAlso, we must find the midpoint and then its index in `positions` (which we have a dictionary `posmap` for).\n\nBut what if the midpoint is not in `positions`? We built `positions` to include all midpoints (and mid+1) and then set to unique and sorted. So it should be there.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   mid = (points[prev_idx] + points[i]) // 2\n   idx_mid = posmap[mid]\n   left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]\n   right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]\n   q = q * left_val % MOD\n   q = q * right_val % MOD\n   keys.append((0, prev_idx, idx_mid))\n   keys.append((1, i, idx_mid))\n\nBut note: the multiplication order: we are multiplying left_val and right_val to q.\n\nLet's check the entire flow for the mask loop for a consecutive pair.\n\nHowever, note that the lanterns in the interval [A, B] are counted in both queryL[prev_idx] and queryR[i]? But the lanterns in [A, mid] are only in queryL[prev_idx] and the lanterns in [mid, B] are only in queryR[i]. And there is no overlap. So it's correct.\n\nBut what about lanterns that are not in [A, B]? They are handled in other intervals.\n\nTherefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py with the above code.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem: minimum operations to change all numbers to 0.\n\nThe operation: \n   - If two numbers are equal, change one of them to 0.\n   - If two numbers are different, change both to the min of the two.\n\nWe are given an array a. We can do operations in any order.\n\nThe note: if there is a 0 in the array, then we can use it to clear other numbers? Because if we have (0, x) with x>0, then we can change both to 0 (if we choose the min, which is 0) in one operation? But wait: if we have (0, x) and x != 0, then we change both to min(0,x)=0. So one operation sets two numbers to 0.\n\nBut if there is no 0 initially, then we have to create a 0.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n   if 0 in a:\n        print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n   else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nIf there is a 0, then we can use it to clear one nonzero per operation. But note: we have multiple zeros. The number of operations should be the number of nonzeros? But wait: one operation can clear two nonzeros if we have two nonzeros? But if we have a zero, then we can pair the zero with a nonzero to clear the nonzero. But then the zero remains. So one operation clears one nonzero. Therefore, the number of operations is the number of nonzeros. But the example: [1,1,3] -> the example used 4 operations? But wait, the example did not have a zero initially.\n\nIn the example: \n   [1,2,3] -> initially no zero.\n   Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> since they are different, change both to 1: [1,1,3]\n   Operation2: choose the two 1's -> change one to 0: [0,1,3]\n   Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> change the 1 to 0: [0,0,3]\n   Operation4: choose 0 and 3 -> change the 3 to 0: [0,0,0]\n\nBut if we had a zero initially, say [0,1,2,3], then we can do:\n   Operation1: 0 and 1 -> [0,0,2,3]  (cleared 1)\n   Operation2: 0 and 2 -> [0,0,0,3]   (cleared 2)\n   Operation3: 0 and 3 -> [0,0,0,0]   (cleared 3)\n\nSo 3 operations for 3 nonzeros.\n\nBut the code says: if 0 in a, then print (len(a) - a.count(0)). In the example [0,1,2,3]: count(0)=1, then operations = 4-1 = 3 -> correct.\n\nNow, if there is no zero initially, we have to create a zero. How?\n\nWe can create a zero by either:\n   - Using two equal numbers: then we can change one of them to 0.\n   - Or, we can use two different numbers to reduce them to a smaller number, and eventually create a zero.\n\nBut note: the operation on two different numbers (x,y) with x<y: we change both to x. Then we might create duplicates.\n\nThe known solution for this problem:\n\n   If there is a duplicate in the array, then we can create a zero in one operation (by taking two duplicates and changing one to 0). Then we have one zero and the rest nonzeros. Then the number of operations = 1 + (n - 1) = n.\n\n   But wait: after creating the zero, we have n-1 nonzeros? Then we need n-1 operations to clear them? So total n.\n\n   If there is no duplicate, then we have to create a duplicate first? How? \n        Operation1: take two numbers (say the smallest and the next) and change both to the smallest. Then we have a duplicate. \n        Then Operation2: take the duplicate and change one to 0.\n        Then we have one zero and the rest nonzeros: then we need n-2 operations? \n        Total: 1 + 1 + (n-2) = n+1.\n\nBut is that minimal?\n\nExample: [1,2,3] (n=3)\n   Without duplicate: \n        Operation1: take 1 and 2 -> [1,1,3]  (now we have a duplicate)\n        Operation2: take the two 1's -> [0,1,3] (create a zero)\n        Operation3: take 0 and 1 -> [0,0,3]\n        Operation4: take 0 and 3 -> [0,0,0]   -> 4 operations = 3+1.\n\nBut n=3, so 3+1=4.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3,4] (n=4)\n   Operation1: 1 and 2 -> [1,1,3,4]  (now we have a duplicate)\n   Operation2: the two 1's -> [0,1,3,4] (create a zero)\n   Operation3: 0 and 1 -> [0,0,3,4]\n   Operation4: 0 and 3 -> [0,0,0,4]\n   Operation5: 0 and 4 -> [0,0,0,0]  -> 5 operations = 4+1.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nAlternative for [1,2,3,4]:\n   Operation1: 1 and 3 -> [1,2,1,4]  (now we have two 1's)\n   Operation2: the two 1's -> [0,2,1,4] -> but then we have 0,2,1,4 -> not cleared.\n   Then Operation3: 0 and 2 -> [0,0,1,4]\n   Operation4: 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0,4]\n   Operation5: 0 and 4 -> [0,0,0,0] -> still 5.\n\nOr:\n   Operation1: 1 and 2 -> [1,1,3,4]\n   Operation2: 1 and 3 -> [1,1,1,4]  (now we have three 1's)\n   Operation3: two 1's -> [0,1,1,4] \n   Operation4: 0 and 1 -> [0,0,1,4]\n   Operation5: 0 and 1 -> [0,0,0,4]\n   Operation6: 0 and 4 -> [0,0,0,0] -> 6, which is worse.\n\nSo the minimal is n+1 if there is no duplicate and no zero.\n\nBut what if there is a zero initially? then we don't need to create a zero, and we can clear the rest in (n - count(0)) operations.\n\nWhat if there is a duplicate but no zero? then we can create a zero in one operation (by changing one of the duplicates to 0) and then clear the rest in (n-1) operations? But note: after creating the zero, we have n-1 nonzeros? But one of the duplicates is now 0, and the other duplicate remains? So we have one zero and the rest nonzeros. The count of nonzeros is n-1. Then we need n-1 operations? So total operations = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\nBut wait: after the first operation, we have one zero and the rest nonzeros. Then we can use the zero to clear one nonzero per operation. So we need n-1 operations. Total n.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n   if there is a zero: n - count(0)\n   else:\n        if there is a duplicate: n\n        else: n+1\n\nBut note: the array might have duplicates and zeros? The condition: if 0 in a -> then we use the zeros to clear the nonzeros. But if there are duplicates among the nonzeros, we don't need to use them because we already have zeros.\n\nSo the code for the else branch:\n\n   else:\n        if len(a) != len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a))\n        else:\n            print(len(a)+1)\n\nBut note: the array might have duplicates even if there is no zero? The condition: if there is a duplicate, then we can create a zero in one operation.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n            print(len(a))\n        else:\n            print(len(a)+1)\n\nBut note: the array might have multiple duplicates? The condition: if there is at least one duplicate, then we can create a zero in one operation.\n\nFor program3.py:\nVery simple: given a rating, output the division.\n\nThe divisions:\n   Division 1: rating >= 1900\n   Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n   Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n   Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nSo we can write:\n\n   def div(n):\n        if n >= 1900:\n            return 1\n        elif n >= 1600:\n            return 2\n        elif n >= 1400:\n            return 3\n        else:\n            return 4\n\nBut note: the divisions are defined as:\n   Division 1: 1900 <= rating\n   Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n   Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n   Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nSo the above if-else chain works.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n   if n >= 1900:\n        return 1\n   elif n >= 1600:\n        return 2\n   elif n >= 1400:\n        return 3\n   else:\n        return 4\n\nBut note: the problem says the rating can be negative? The condition for Division 4: rating <= 1399, which includes negative.\n\nSo the above code handles negative.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in JSON.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the block we described.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is the two lines.\n\nFor program3.py: the missing code is the if-else block.\n\nBut note: the code for program1.py is a block of code that must be indented properly. We output it as a string.\n\nWe must be cautious: the code for program1.py is inside a for-loop and an if-else. We output the exact code.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the code is two lines (or one if-else block) but we output the exact code that replaces the TODO.\n\nFor program3.py, the code is the body of the function.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                mid = (points[prev_idx] + points[i]) // 2\\n                idx_mid = posmap[mid]\\n                left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]\\n                right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]\\n                q = q * left_val % MOD\\n                q = q * right_val % MOD\\n                keys.append((0, prev_idx, idx_mid))\\n                keys.append((1, i, idx_mid))\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n            print(len(a))\\n        else:\\n            print(len(a)+1)\",\n  \"program3\": \"    if n >= 1900:\\n        return 1\\n    elif n >= 1600:\\n        return 2\\n    elif n >= 1400:\\n        return 3\\n    else:\\n        return 4\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code must be properly indented. The current level is 12 spaces? The surrounding code:\n\n            for i in range(m):\n                if (mask >> i) & 1:\n                    p = points[i]\n                    if prev_idx == -1:\n                        keys.append((1, i, 0))\n                        q = q * queryR[i][0] % MOD\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with 8 lines. The indentation level for the else block is 16 spaces? Actually, the if block is 16 spaces, so the else block should be 16 spaces. Then the code we put should be indented by 16 spaces? But the JSON string will have the newlines and the exact spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the code with the same indentation as the if block.\n\nIn the provided code, the if block (prev_idx==-1) is:\n\n   keys.append((1, i, 0))\n   q = q * queryR[i][0] % MOD\n\nSo two lines, each at 20 spaces? Actually, the if block is at 20 spaces. So the else block should be at 20 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py should be:\n\n                mid = (points[prev_idx] + points[i]) // 2\n                idx_mid = posmap[mid]\n                left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]\n                right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]\n                q = q * left_val % MOD\n                q = q * right_val % MOD\n                keys.append((0, prev_idx, idx_mid))\n                keys.append((1, i, idx_mid))\n\nBut note: the variable `points` is the sorted list of points. `prev_idx` and `i` are indices. `posmap` is the dictionary mapping a coordinate to an index in `positions`.\n\nWe output the string exactly as above, with 16 leading spaces? Actually, the surrounding code has 16 spaces for the else block? The entire block is inside:\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        if (mask >> i) & 1:\n            ...   # this is 12 spaces for the if, then 16 for the body\n\nBut the if and else are at the same level. The if block (prev_idx==-1) is at 16 spaces, and the else block is at 16 spaces. Then the body of the else should be at 20 spaces.\n\nSo we write each line of the else body with 20 spaces? But the provided example in the TODO has 16? Actually, the TODO comment is at 16. But the code we write should be at 20.\n\nBut the original code for the if block is at 20? \n\nLooking: the if block has:\n\n   keys.append(...)   # at 20 spaces\n   q = ...            # at 20 spaces\n\nSo we do the same.\n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py in the JSON string should have 20 spaces at the beginning of each line? But note: the entire block is 8 lines. We can write:\n\n\"                mid = (points[prev_idx] + points[i]) // 2\\n                idx_mid = posmap[mid]\\n                left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]\\n                right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]\\n                q = q * left_val % MOD\\n                q = q * right_val % MOD\\n                keys.append((0, prev_idx, idx_mid))\\n                keys.append((1, i, idx_mid))\"\n\nThis has 16 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the string \"                \" is 16 spaces. But the surrounding code in the else block is at 16 spaces, and then the body should be 20? \n\nAlternatively, we can count: the if block in the provided code is:\n\n   if prev_idx == -1:\n        keys.append((1, i, 0))   # this line is indented by 16 (relative to the for loop) plus 4 for the if block? Actually, the if is at 12, then the body at 16.\n\nBut the else block is at the same level. So the code we put should be at 16+4? \n\nBut the provided code for the if block has two lines at 20 spaces? \n\nActually, the original code:\n\n                    if prev_idx == -1:\n                        keys.append((1, i, 0))\n                        q = q * queryR[i][0] % MOD\n\nThe first line of the if body is at 24 spaces? (because the if is at 20, then the body is 24). \n\nWait, the structure:\n\n   for mask in ...:   # 4 spaces\n        ...           # 8 spaces\n        for i in range(m):   # 8 spaces\n            if ...:   # 12 spaces\n                ...   # 16 spaces\n                if ...:   # 16 spaces\n                    ...   # 20 spaces\n\nBut the code we are replacing is:\n\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the else is at 20 spaces? Then the body should be at 24 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the code we output for program1.py should be 24 spaces for each line? \n\nBut the if block (prev_idx==-1) has two lines at 24 spaces. So we do the same.\n\nTherefore, the string for program1.py should be:\n\n\"                    mid = (points[prev_idx] + points[i]) // 2\\n                    idx_mid = posmap[mid]\\n                    left_val = queryL[prev_idx][idx_mid]\\n                    right_val = queryR[i][idx_mid]\\n                    q = q * left_val % MOD\\n                    q = q * right_val % MOD\\n                    keys.append((0, prev_idx, idx_mid))\\n                    keys.append((1, i, idx_mid))\"\n\nBut wait, the if block has two lines at 24 spaces. We have 8 lines at 24 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the code is:\n\n        if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n            print(len(a))\n        else:\n            print(len(a)+1)\n\nThis is at the same indentation as the if block that had the print. The else branch is at the same level as the if.\n\nFor program3.py, the function body is:\n\n    if n >= 1900:\n        return 1\n    elif n >= 1600:\n        return 2\n    elif n >= 1400:\n        return 3\n    else:\n        return 4\n\nThis is at 4 spaces inside the function.\n\nNow, we output the JSON."
