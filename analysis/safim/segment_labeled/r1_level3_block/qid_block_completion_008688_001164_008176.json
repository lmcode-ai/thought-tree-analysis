But wait: if `a` is a divisor of `half_perimeter`, then `2 * half_perimeter` is divisible by `a` only if `a` is even or if `a` divides `half_perimeter` and then `2 * half_perimeter` is divisible by `a`? Actually, if `a` divides `half_perimeter`, then `half_perimeter = k * a`, so `2 * half_perimeter = 2 * k * a`, which is divisible by `a`. Therefore, the boundary length is divisible by `a`. So the condition is only the mod condition on w and l.\n\n Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n```python\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut note: the set `solutions` initially has {1,2}. We are iterating over divisors and adding any divisor `a` that satisfies `w % a <= 2` and `l % a <= 2`. However, what about the divisor `a=2`? It is already in the set. Adding it again is harmless. But what about divisors that are greater than 2? We are iterating from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter), and then for each divisor `i` we consider `a = i` and `a = half_perimeter // i`. Also, we must consider that `a` must be at least 1, and the problem says `a>=1`. But note: the condition `mod_a = w % a` and `mod_b = l % a` might be computed for `a=1` and `a=2` again, but they are already in the set. However, there might be divisors that are not covered by the initial {1,2}? For example, if `half_perimeter` is 6, then we will consider i=2 -> a=2 and a=3. Then for a=3, we check. But the initial set has 1 and 2. We are not including 1 in the loop? The loop starts at 2. And for i=2, we get a=2 and a=3 (if half_perimeter=6). Then we add a=3 if it satisfies the condition. But what about a=1? It is already in the set. Therefore, the code is complete. But note: the condition might also be satisfied for a=1 and a=2, but they are already in the set. However, there is a possibility that the divisor `a` might be greater than 2 and not in the initial set, so we add it. Also, we must consider that the same divisor might be encountered twice? The set takes care of duplicates. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n```python\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: We are allowed to choose an index i (from 2 to n) and change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. We can do this any number of times. We want to make a_i=0 for all i from 2 to n.\n\nThe provided function `diff_ops` does:\n\n```python\ndef diff_ops(arr):\n    result = True\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function checks that every element from index1 to the end is divisible by the first element. But is this sufficient? Example 1: [5,10] -> becomes [5,5] then [5,0]. Then we are done. And 10 % 5 == 0 -> True. Example 2: [1,2,3] -> \n  Operation1: i=3 -> [1,2,1] -> then i=2: [1,1,1] -> then i=3: [1,1,0] -> then i=2: [1,0,0]. But the function: \n      arr[1]=2: 2 % 1 == 0 -> True.\n      arr[2]=3: 3 % 1 == 0 -> True. So it returns True. Example 3: the note says \"In the third test case, you can choose indices in the order 4,3,2.\" -> so it is possible. But consider a test case: [2, 3]. Operation1: i=2: [2, 1] (because 3-2=1)\n  Operation2: i=2: [2, 1-2] -> negative? The problem says the array consists of positive integers, and the operation: change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. After the first operation, we have [2,1] (positive). Then we can do: [2, 1-2] = [2, -1] -> negative. But the problem says \"positive integers\" initially, but the operations might create non-positive? The problem does not restrict to positive after operations. The goal is to make them zero. But then we can do: [2,3] -> [2,1] -> [2, -1] -> and then we cannot make the last element 0 by subtracting the previous (because 0 - 2 = -2, not -1). Alternatively, we can do: [2,3] -> [2,1] (at index2) Then we can change the first element? We cannot, because the operation is only on indices i>=2. How to make the second element 0? We can do: [2,1] -> then we can do index2 again: [2, 1-2] = [2, -1]\n      Then we can do index2: [2, -1-2] = [2, -3] -> and so on, never 0. Therefore, [2,3] is not solvable. But the function `diff_ops` would check: 3 % 2 = 1, not 0 -> returns False -> \"NO\", which is correct. But consider [3, 5]:\n  Step1: [3,5] -> [3,2] (by subtracting 3 from 5)\n  Step2: [3,2] -> [3, -1] -> not good. Alternatively, we can do: [3,5] -> [3,5-3]=[3,2] -> then we can do on the first element? We cannot. How about if we have three elements: [3,5,2]?\n\n  We can do:\n      i=3: [3,5,2-5] = [3,5,-3] -> not allowed? The problem does not say we require positive, but the operation is defined and then we can continue. But the goal is to make a_i=0 for i>=2. We don't care about the signs as long as we can eventually make them 0. However, the problem says the array consists of positive integers initially.",

Why? Note: the operation on an element a_i: subtract a_{i-1} any number of times. This is equivalent to: we can replace a_i with a_i mod a_{i-1} (if we do enough subtractions) but only if a_{i-1} is positive and we are allowed to do until the value becomes negative? Actually, we can do until it becomes less than a_{i-1}. But then we can also change a_{i-1} by operations on it? The operations are sequential and can be interleaved arbitrarily. However, the key is that the first element a1 never changes. Then the second element can be reduced to any nonnegative value of the form a2 - k * a1 (for k>=0) as long as it remains nonnegative? But the problem does not require nonnegativity, but eventually we want 0. To get a2=0, we must have a2 = k * a1 for some k. So a1 must divide a2. Then for the third element: we can reduce it by the second element (which is now 0) -> but we cannot reduce by 0? The operation: a_i becomes a_i - a_{i-1}.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\".\n\nLet's break down each program:\n\n### program1.py\nThe problem is about conquering kingdoms with minimum cost. The provided code has a function `cum_sum` that is incomplete. The function is expected to compute the cumulative sum of the `nums` list.\n\nThe current code for `cum_sum`:\n```python\n    curr = 0\n    result = [0]*len(nums)\n    for idx, num in enumerate(nums):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe need to complete the `cum_sum` function. The idea is to have an array `result` where `result[idx]` is the sum of `nums[0]` to `nums[idx]`.\n\nWe can do:\n```python\n        curr += num\n        result[idx] = curr\n```\n\nBut note: the `nums` array in the main code is built as `[0] + list(map(int, lines[i+1].split(\" \")))`. So the first element is 0 (the capital starts at 0) and then the positions of the kingdoms.\n\nThe main loop then uses `cumulative[-1]` which is the total sum of the entire `nums` array (including the 0 at the beginning). Then the formula in the loop is:\n```python\ncurr = a*nums[f] + b*(cumulative[-1] - cumulative[f] - (n-f-1)*nums[f])\n```\n\nThis formula is part of a known solution for this problem. The idea is to try every possible final capital position (from 0 to n, where 0 is the initial capital and then the conquered kingdoms). The cost is broken down as:\n- The cost to move the capital from 0 to the chosen capital at position `f` (which is `a * nums[f]` because we move from 0 to `nums[f]`).\n- Then, for the kingdoms beyond `f` (i.e., from `f+1` to `n`), we conquer them from the current capital at `nums[f]`. The cost for each kingdom `i` is `b * (nums[i] - nums[f])`. But note: we cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom in between. However, because we are processing in increasing order and we have conquered all kingdoms up to `f`, we can conquer the next ones in order.\n\nThe term `cumulative[-1] - cumulative[f]` is the sum of the positions from index `f` to the end? Actually, note that `cumulative` is computed on the `nums` array which has `n+1` elements (including the 0). The indices: \n- `cumulative[f]` is the sum of `nums[0]` to `nums[f]`.\n- `cumulative[-1]` is the total sum.\n\nThen `cumulative[-1] - cumulative[f]` is the sum of `nums[f+1]` to `nums[n]`.\n\nBut the formula subtracts `(n-f-1)*nums[f]` because for each kingdom beyond `f`, we are effectively doing `b * (nums[i] - nums[f]) = b * nums[i] - b * nums[f]`. So the total for the beyond part is:\n`b * (sum_{i=f+1}^{n} nums[i] - (n-f-1)*nums[f])`.\n\nTherefore, the cumulative sum array must be the prefix sums of the entire `nums` array (including the 0 at the beginning).\n\nSo the missing code for `cum_sum` is to compute the prefix sums.\n\nWe'll write:\n```python\n        curr += num\n        result[idx] = curr\n```\n\nBut note: the `cum_sum` function is called with `nums` which is the list including 0 and then the kingdoms. The cumulative sum array will have the same length as `nums`.\n\n### program2.py\nThe problem is about tiling a bathroom floor. The provided code iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter = w + l - 2` and then checks conditions.\n\nThe code currently:\n- Defines a set `solutions` that initially has {1, 2}.\n- Then iterates `i` from 2 to `floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))` (inclusive) to find divisors.\n- For each divisor `i` of `half_perimeter`, it considers `a = i` and `a = half_perimeter // i` (stored in `div`).\n- Then for each `a` in `[i, div]`, it checks `w % a` and if `mod_a <= 2` then it does something (which is missing).\n\nThe note in the problem says that the boundary can be tiled with tiles of size `1 x a` (which can be rotated). The boundary has two parts: the two lengths and the two widths, but note that the corners are shared. The total boundary tiles (without double-counting corners) is `2*(w + l) - 4` (because each corner is counted twice in `w+l` and there are 4 corners). However, the problem states that the interior is `(w-2)*(l-2)` and the boundary is the rest: `w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4`.\n\nBut note: the problem says the boundary is to be tiled with `1 x a` tiles. The entire boundary must be divisible by `a`? Actually, the boundary is broken into four segments. However, the problem allows rotation and the tiles can be placed arbitrarily. But note that the segments are:\n\n- Two segments of length `w` (top and bottom) but without the corners? Actually, the boundary is a cycle. However, the problem states that the interior is covered by 1x1. The boundary then consists of:\n  - The top row: from (0,0) to (w,0) -> length w\n  - The right column: from (w,0) to (w, l) -> length l\n  - The bottom row: from (w,l) to (0,l) -> length w\n  - The left column: from (0,l) to (0,0) -> length l\n\nBut note that the corners are shared. So the total boundary length is `2*(w+l) - 4` (because each corner is counted twice? Actually, we have 4 corners and each corner is the meeting of two sides. The entire perimeter is `2*(w+l)`, but we have to subtract the 4 corners? Actually, the boundary tiles are the entire perimeter of the rectangle, which is `2*(w+l) - 4` because the corners are included? Actually, the perimeter of a rectangle is `2*(w+l)`, but in terms of the number of 1x1 squares, for a grid of `w x l` (with `w` and `l` in centimeters and using 1x1 tiles), the boundary has `2*(w+l) - 4` squares? Actually, no: the entire grid has `w*l` squares. The interior has `(w-2)*(l-2)`, so the boundary has `w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4`.\n\nSo the boundary has `2*(w+l)-4` squares. Therefore, the entire boundary must be tiled with tiles of size `1 x a`, so the total boundary length must be divisible by `a`. But note: the problem says the tiles can be rotated and placed arbitrarily. However, the boundary is not a single contiguous strip? Actually, it is a cycle. But the problem does not require contiguous tiling? Actually, the tiles must cover the boundary without gaps. So the condition is that `a` must divide the entire boundary length? Not exactly: because the boundary is broken into four segments (each side). And the tiles can be placed arbitrarily on each side? But note: the problem says the tiles can be rotated and placed arbitrarily. However, the segments are of fixed lengths: two of length `w` and two of length `l`? Actually, no: the segments are:\n\n- The top: from (0,0) to (w,0) -> length w, but note that the corners are shared. Actually, the top row has `w` tiles? But wait: the grid is from 0 to w in the x-direction and 0 to l in the y-direction. The top row has `w` tiles? Actually, the top row has `w` 1x1 squares? But the length of the top row in terms of edges is `w`? However, the problem is about tiling the squares. The boundary consists of the squares on the edge. The top row has `w` squares, the bottom row has `w` squares, the left column has `l-2` squares (excluding the corners already counted) and the right column has `l-2` squares? Actually, no: the entire boundary has:\n\n- Top: w squares\n- Bottom: w squares\n- Left: l-2 squares (because the top-left and bottom-left are already counted in top and bottom)\n- Right: l-2 squares\n\nSo total: `w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2*w + 2*l - 4 = 2*(w+l-2)`.\n\nBut note: the problem states the boundary is to be covered by `1 x a` tiles. Therefore, the entire boundary has `2*(w+l-2)` squares? Actually, that matches the `half_perimeter` variable: `w + l - 2` is not the same as `2*(w+l-2)`. There is a factor of 2.\n\nWait: the variable `half_perimeter` is defined as `w + l - 2`. But the boundary is `2*(w+l-2)`. So the entire boundary length is `2 * half_perimeter`. Therefore, the condition for `a` is that `a` must divide the entire boundary? Actually, no: because the boundary is broken into four segments. The problem does not require that the entire boundary is one contiguous strip? The tiles can be placed arbitrarily on the four segments. Therefore, the condition is that `a` must divide each segment? But note: the segments are of lengths `w`, `w`, `l-2`, `l-2`? Actually, no: the segments are:\n\n- Top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0): actually, the top row has `w` squares? But the problem says the bathroom has width `w` and length `l`. The grid has `w` columns and `l` rows? Actually, the problem states: \"The bathroom has width w centimeters and length l centimeters.\" and the basic tiles are 1x1. So the grid is `w` by `l`? Then the top row has `w` tiles, the bottom row has `w` tiles, the left column has `l` tiles, and the right column has `l` tiles? But then the corners are counted twice. So the total boundary tiles is `2*w + 2*l - 4` (because we subtract the 4 corners that are counted twice). So `2*(w+l-2)`.\n\nBut note: the problem says the interior is `(w-2)*(l-2)`, so the boundary is `w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4`. And `2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2)`. So the boundary has `2*(w+l-2)` tiles.\n\nHowever, the boundary is broken into four segments: two of length `w` (top and bottom) and two of length `l` (left and right) but then we have to account for the corners? Actually, the top row has `w` tiles, but the two corners are included. Similarly, the bottom row has `w` tiles. The left column has `l-2` tiles (because the top-left and bottom-left are already counted) and the right column has `l-2` tiles. So the total is `w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2*w + 2*l - 4 = 2*(w+l-2)`.\n\nTherefore, the four segments are:\n- Segment 1: top row -> length w\n- Segment 2: bottom row -> length w\n- Segment 3: left column (without top and bottom) -> length l-2\n- Segment 4: right column (without top and bottom) -> length l-2\n\nBut note: the problem allows the tiles to be placed arbitrarily and rotated. So we can cover each segment independently. Therefore, for `a` to be valid, it must be that:\n\n1. The top row (length w) can be tiled with 1xa tiles: so `a` must divide `w` OR `a` must divide `w` when we consider that the tile can be rotated? Actually, the tile is 1xa and can be placed as 1xa or ax1. But since the segment is a straight line of length w, we can only use the tile as 1xa (if we use it as ax1 then it would be of length a, but then the width 1 would not fit the 1 cm height of the boundary segment). Actually, the boundary segment is one row high and w cm wide. So we must use the tile as 1xa (so placed horizontally). Therefore, we require that `a` divides `w`? But note: we can also use the tile vertically? Then the tile would cover a height of a and width 1. But the segment is only 1 cm high. So we cannot use the tile vertically on the top row. Therefore, for the top row we require that `a` divides `w`.\n\nSimilarly, for the bottom row: `a` must divide `w`.\n\nFor the left column (without corners): the segment is 1 cm wide and (l-2) cm high. So we can use the tile as 1xa (vertically) or ax1 (horizontally). But if we use it horizontally (ax1) then the height would be 1 and the width a. But the segment is only 1 cm wide. So we must use the tile as 1xa (vertically) and then we require that `a` divides `(l-2)`. Similarly for the right column: `a` must divide `(l-2)`.\n\nBut wait: the problem does not require that each segment is tiled independently? Actually, the entire boundary must be tiled arbitrarily. However, the problem does not require that the tiles are confined to one segment. But note: the interior is already covered by 1x1 tiles. So the boundary must be tiled without overlapping the interior. Therefore, the tiles must be placed entirely on the boundary. And the boundary is broken into four segments. Moreover, the tiles are straight and cannot bend. Therefore, each tile must lie entirely within one segment.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nCondition 1: `a` divides the entire boundary length? -> Then we would have `a` divides `2*(w+l-2)`. But that is not sufficient: because the segments are separate. We must be able to tile each segment independently.\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities for the entire boundary:\n\nPossibility 1: We tile the entire boundary as four independent segments. Then we require:\n- `a` divides `w` (for the top) OR `a` divides `w`? Actually, the top and bottom are both `w`, so we require `a` divides `w` for the top and bottom? But note: we can use the same `a` for both. So condition: `a` must divide `w` and `a` must divide `w` (again) and `a` must divide `l-2` and `a` must divide `l-2`. So we require `a` divides `w` and `a` divides `l-2`.\n\nPossibility 2: Alternatively, we might be able to combine the segments? Actually, the problem does not require that the tiles are confined to one segment? But the segments are adjacent. However, the corners are already fixed? Actually, the problem does not specify that the corners must be covered by a particular tile. But note: the corner is the meeting of two segments. A tile that covers a corner would have to be placed at a 90-degree angle? But the tile is 1xa and cannot be bent. Therefore, a tile must lie entirely in one segment.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- Condition A: `a` divides `w` (for the top) and `a` divides `w` (for the bottom) and `a` divides `l-2` (for the left) and `a` divides `l-2` (for the right). But note: if `a` divides `w`, then it automatically divides the bottom (same as top). Similarly, if `a` divides `l-2`, then it divides both left and right. So Condition A: `a` divides `w` and `a` divides `l-2`.\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the tile covers two adjacent segments? Actually, the problem does not allow that because the tile is straight and the boundary has a 90-degree turn at the corner. So we must cover each segment independently.\n\nPossibility 3: Alternatively, we might cover the boundary in a different way? The problem says the tiles can be rotated and placed arbitrarily. Another idea: we might cover the entire boundary as a single cycle? But the tile is straight and cannot bend. So we cannot cover a corner with one tile? Therefore, the four segments must be tiled independently.\n\nBut note: the problem has a note that for the test case (w=3, l=5) the valid a are 1,2,3.\n\nLet's check Condition A for (w=3, l=5):\n- Condition A: a must divide 3 and a must divide 5-2=3. So a must divide 3. Then a=1,3. But the example says a=1,2,3.\n\nSo Condition A is not the only possibility.\n\nWhat if we consider:\n\nCondition B: `a` divides `w` and `a` divides `l-1`? Why `l-1`? Because we might use a different breakdown? Actually, the problem does not specify that the boundary must be broken exactly as above. There is an alternative:\n\nPossibility: The top row and the left column might share a tile? Actually, no, because the tile is straight. But note: we can cover the top row and the bottom row with tiles, and then the left and right columns, but we have to leave the corners? Actually, the corners are already covered by the top and bottom? Then the left and right columns would be of length `l-2` as above.\n\nBut the example in the note has a picture that shows:\n\nFor a=2: \n  - The top row: 3 cm -> 3 is not divisible by 2? How do they do it?\n  - They might use a tile that covers two squares on the top and then one square on the left? But that would be a bent tile? Not allowed.\n\nLooking at the example: \n  - The bathroom is 3x5. The boundary has 2*(3+5)-4 = 12 squares? \n  - For a=2: they use 12/2 = 6 tiles.\n\nHow? The picture in the note (if we imagine) might be: \n  - The top row: 3 squares -> we can cover 2 squares with one tile and then the last square with a tile that is placed vertically? But the last square is the top-right corner. Then the tile that covers the top-right corner would be placed vertically? Then it would cover the top-right and the square below? But then that square below is in the right column. So that tile covers two segments? \n\nTherefore, the problem does allow a tile to be placed at a corner such that it covers one square from the top and one from the right? But then the tile is 1x2 and placed at the corner: one square in the top row and one square in the right column? That is allowed because the tile is straight? Actually, no: the tile is 1x2 and if placed at the corner, it would have to be bent? \n\nAlternatively, the tile can be placed as an L-shape? But the problem says the tile is 1xa and can be rotated by 90 degrees, meaning it can be placed as 1xa or ax1, but not bent.\n\nSo how is a=2 valid for 3x5?\n\nAfter reading the note: the three tilings are represented in the pictures. Unfortunately, we don't have the pictures. But the problem says: \"The three tilings are represented in the following pictures.\"\n\nTherefore, we must rely on known solutions for this problem.\n\nKnown solution approach for this problem (from known code in Codeforces):\n\nThe valid `a` are the divisors of `gcd(w-1, l-1)`, `gcd(w-2, l)`, `gcd(w, l-2)`, and `gcd(w-2, l-2)`? Actually, the known solution for this problem (from past contests) is to consider the divisors of the following numbers:\n\n1. Divisors of `gcd(w-1, l-1)`\n2. Divisors of `gcd(w-2, l)`\n3. Divisors of `gcd(w, l-2)`\n4. Divisors of `gcd(w-2, l-2)`\n\nBut note: the entire boundary length is `2*(w+l-2)`, so `a` must be a divisor of `2*(w+l-2)`. However, the above sets of divisors are not necessarily divisors of the boundary length? But they are: because each of the gcds is a divisor of the boundary length? Actually, we are going to take the divisors of these gcds and then check if they divide the boundary length? Actually, no: the known solution is to consider the divisors of the boundary length and then check if they satisfy one of the four conditions.\n\nAlternatively, we can check the following four conditions for a divisor `a` of the boundary length? Actually, the problem says the total boundary length is `2*(w+l-2)`, so `a` must be a divisor of `2*(w+l-2)`. But the known solution in the provided code does not check that? It iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter = w+l-2` (which is half the boundary length). Then the divisors of `half_perimeter` are also divisors of the boundary length? Because the boundary length is `2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter`. So if `a` is a divisor of `half_perimeter`, then `a` divides the boundary length? But note: `a` might be 2? Then 2 divides `2 * half_perimeter` even if 2 does not divide `half_perimeter`. So we must consider all divisors of `2 * half_perimeter`? However, the problem says the output integers are at most 200000, and the known solution iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter` and then also considers the divisors of the gcds.\n\nBut the provided code in program2.py does:\n\n```python\n    half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n    solutions = {1, 2}\n    for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n        if mod_i != 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nIt then has a condition: `if mod_a <= 2: ...` and then does something. We must complete the condition.\n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (Codeforces Round #731 (Div. 3) problem F) is:\n\nWe consider the following four cases:\n\nCase 1: The four corners are covered by four different tiles? Then we require:\n  - The top row (excluding the last square) can be tiled: so `a` must divide `w - ?` ... Actually, we break the boundary as:\n      top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> length w-1\n      right: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> length l-1\n      bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (1, l-1) -> length w-1\n      left: from (1, l-1) to (1,1) -> length l-2? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternatively, the known solution is to check the following conditions for a divisor `a` of `half_perimeter` (or of `2*half_perimeter`?):\n\nCondition 1: (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) OR\nCondition 2: (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) OR ... \n\nBut the provided code only checks `w % a` and then if `mod_a <= 2`, it does something.\n\nLooking at the provided code: it has `mod_a = w % a`, and then if `mod_a <= 2`, then it does something. But what? It should check one of the conditions.\n\nActually, the known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces) is to check:\n\n```python\n            if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 and a<=2) ... \n```\n\nBut that is not complete.\n\nAfter checking known solutions for \"F. Tiling\" from Codeforces Round #731 (Div. 3), the solution is:\n\nThe valid `a` must be divisors of `w-1`, `w-2`, `l-1`, `l-2` in combinations? Actually, the known solution is to consider the divisors of the following gcds:\n\n```c++\n    set<int> ans;\n    ans.insert(1);\n    ans.insert(2);\n    auto consider = [&](ll g) {\n        for (ll i = 1; i * i <= g; i++) {\n            if (g % i == 0) {\n                divisors.insert(i);\n                divisors.insert(g / i);\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    consider(gcd(w-1, l-1));\n    consider(gcd(w-2, l));\n    consider(gcd(w, l-2));\n    consider(gcd(w-2, l-2));\n```\n\nThen the divisors set is the divisors of these four gcds. But then we must also ensure that the divisor `a` divides the boundary length? Actually, the boundary length is `2*(w+l-2)`, and the divisor `a` must divide the boundary length? But the known solution does not check that? It just collects these divisors.\n\nBut note: the problem says the output must be sorted and the number of valid `a` for each test case.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program2.py does not do that. It uses a different approach: it iterates over divisors of `half_perimeter = w+l-2` and then for each divisor `a`, it checks some condition.\n\nThe condition in the provided code is:\n\n```python\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nAnd then there is a similar condition for `l`? Actually, the known solution in the provided code might be:\n\n```python\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                if (l) % a <= 2 * (a > 1):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut that is from a known submission.\n\nAlternatively, we can complete the code as:\n\n```python\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a == 0 or mod_a == 1 or mod_a == 2:\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b == 0 or mod_b == 1 or mod_b == 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut that is not sufficient.\n\nAfter checking a known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces Round #731 (Div. 3), F. Tiling), we find:\n\n```c++\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nvoid solve() {\n\tll w, l; cin >> w >> l;\n\tset<ll> ans;\n \n\t// Total tiles on the boundary\n\tll total = 2 * (w + l - 2);\n \n\tauto add_divs = [&](ll x) {\n\t\tfor (ll i = 1; i * i <= x; i++) {\n\t\t\tif (x % i) continue;\n\t\t\t// i and x/i are divisors\n\t\t\tif (total % i == 0) ans.insert(i);\n\t\t\tif (total % (x/i) == 0) ans.insert(x/i);\n\t\t}\n\t};\n \n\t// Case 1: cover the boundary with a single type of tile that fits in the following patterns:\n\t// The four corners are covered by tiles that are entirely in one segment? We consider four cases for the corners.\n \n\t// Case 1: the top-left corner is covered by a tile that is entirely in the top row.\n\t// Then the top row must be covered without affecting the left column? Actually, we consider the following segments:\n\t//   top: w, right: l, bottom: w, left: l -> but then the corners are shared.\n\t// Instead, we consider the following conditions for the boundary to be tileable:\n \n\t// Condition 1: the entire boundary can be tiled if the following four conditions hold for a divisor g:\n\t//   g must divide w-2 and l-2 -> then we can do the interior of the sides.\n\t//   or g must divide w-2 and l-1 -> then the left and right columns might be broken into l-1 and l-1? \n \n\t// Actually, known solution: consider the divisors of the following numbers:\n\tvector<ll> tests = {\n\t\t__gcd(w-1, l-1),\n\t\t__gcd(w-2, l),\n\t\t__gcd(w, l-2),\n\t\t__gcd(w-1, l-2),\n\t\t__gcd(w-2, l-1),\n\t\t__gcd(w-2, l-2)\n\t};\n \n\tfor (ll test: tests) {\n\t\tadd_divs(test);\n\t}\n \n\t// Also, we must include 1 and 2? They are already included by the gcds.\n \n\t// But also, the divisor must divide the total boundary length? The known solution above does: add_divs(test) will add divisors of 'test' that also divide the total boundary length.\n \n\t// However, the provided code in the problem does not have this structure.\n \n\t// Given the provided code in program2.py, we must complete the inner loop.\n```\n\nBut the provided code in program2.py is:\n\n```python\n    half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n    solutions = {1, 2}\n    for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n        if mod_i != 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe must complete the TODO.\n\nAfter reading a known solution that uses a similar loop, we find:\n\n```python\n            if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut then we also need to consider the possibility that the boundary might be tiled in different ways? \n\nAlternatively, we might need to check:\n\n```python\n            if (w % a == 0 or w % a == 1 or w % a == 2) and (l % a == 0 or l % a == 1 or l % a == 2):\n                solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut let's test with the example (w=3, l=5), and a=2:\n  - w % a = 3 % 2 = 1, which is <=2 -> True.\n  - l % a = 5 % 2 = 1, which is <=2 -> True.\n  -> then a=2 is added.\n\nFor a=3:\n  - 3 % 3 = 0 -> True.\n  - 5 % 3 = 2 -> True.\n  -> added.\n\nFor a=1: already in the set initially.\n\nSo the solutions become {1,2,3} as required.\n\nBut is this condition sufficient? Let's try another example: w=4, l=4. The boundary length is 2*(4+4-2)=12. The valid a should be the divisors of 12 that satisfy the condition? But also the condition on the segments.\n\nFor a=3: \n  - 4 % 3 = 1, and 4 % 3 = 1 -> both <=2, so added.\n  - But can we tile a 4x4 boundary with 1x3 tiles? \n    - The boundary has 12 squares. 12/3=4, so we need 4 tiles.\n    - The segments: \n        top: 4 -> 4 % 3 = 1 -> cannot be tiled with 1x3 tiles? because we would need to use one tile that covers 3 squares and then one square left -> not divisible.\n    - However, we might cover the boundary in a different way: for example, at the corner use a tile that covers two segments? But the condition only checks the mod of the entire w and l, not per segment.\n\nBut wait: the condition in the code is only on w and l, not on the segments. What does it mean?\n\nActually, the condition `w % a <= 2` and `l % a <= 2` might be necessary but not sufficient.\n\nLet me try to understand the intended meaning of the condition in the provided code:\n\n The condition might be: after placing the corner tiles, the remaining length in each segment must be divisible by a. But how many corner tiles are there? \n\n We have four corners. Bethany can use the tiles in the corners in any orientation. In fact, the corner tile might cover:\n\n Possibility 1: one square at a corner -> then the adjacent segments have lengths reduced by 1.\n\n Possibility 2: two squares at a corner: one from the top and one from the right -> then the top segment has length reduced by 1, and the right segment has length reduced by 1.\n\n Therefore, the remaining lengths in the segments might be:\n\n   top: w - x1 - x2   (where x1 and x2 are the number of squares covered by corner tiles at the two ends)\n   bottom: w - x3 - x4\n   left: l - x1 - x3 - 2?  -> wait, it's messy.\n\nAlternatively, the condition `w % a <= 2` and `l % a <= 2` might be checking that the entire dimensions have a remainder that can be handled by the corners.\n\n But note: the boundary is not the entire dimensions, but the perimeter.\n\n Given the complexity, and the fact that the example (3,5) works, and the known solution in the provided code might be using this condition, we will complete the TODO as:\n\n```python\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut note: the condition might also be that the entire boundary length is divisible by a? But in the loop, `a` is a divisor of `half_perimeter = w+l-2`, and the boundary length is `2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter`. Therefore, `a` might not be a divisor of the boundary length if `a` does not divide 2? But wait: if `a` is a divisor of `half_perimeter`, then `2 * half_perimeter` is divisible by `a` only if `a` is even or if `a` divides `half_perimeter` and then `2 * half_perimeter` is divisible by `a`? Actually, if `a` divides `half_perimeter`, then `half_perimeter = k * a`, so `2 * half_perimeter = 2 * k * a`, which is divisible by `a`. Therefore, the boundary length is divisible by `a`.\n\n So the condition is only the mod condition on w and l.\n\n Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n```python\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut note: the set `solutions` initially has {1,2}. We are iterating over divisors and adding any divisor `a` that satisfies `w % a <= 2` and `l % a <= 2`.\n\n However, what about the divisor `a=2`? It is already in the set. Adding it again is harmless.\n\n But what about divisors that are greater than 2? We are iterating from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter), and then for each divisor `i` we consider `a = i` and `a = half_perimeter // i`.\n\n Also, we must consider that `a` must be at least 1, and the problem says `a>=1`.\n\n But note: the condition `mod_a = w % a` and `mod_b = l % a` might be computed for `a=1` and `a=2` again, but they are already in the set.\n\n However, there might be divisors that are not covered by the initial {1,2}? For example, if `half_perimeter` is 6, then we will consider i=2 -> a=2 and a=3. Then for a=3, we check.\n\n But the initial set has 1 and 2. We are not including 1 in the loop? The loop starts at 2. And for i=2, we get a=2 and a=3 (if half_perimeter=6). Then we add a=3 if it satisfies the condition.\n\n But what about a=1? It is already in the set.\n\n Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n But note: the condition might also be satisfied for a=1 and a=2, but they are already in the set.\n\n However, there is a possibility that the divisor `a` might be greater than 2 and not in the initial set, so we add it.\n\n Also, we must consider that the same divisor might be encountered twice? The set takes care of duplicates.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n```python\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\n### program3.py\nThe problem: We are allowed to choose an index i (from 2 to n) and change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. We can do this any number of times. We want to make a_i=0 for all i from 2 to n.\n\nThe provided function `diff_ops` does:\n\n```python\ndef diff_ops(arr):\n    result = True\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function checks that every element from index1 to the end is divisible by the first element.\n\nBut is this sufficient? \n\nExample 1: [5,10] -> becomes [5,5] then [5,0]. Then we are done. And 10 % 5 == 0 -> True.\n\nExample 2: [1,2,3] -> \n  Operation1: i=3 -> [1,2,1] -> then i=2: [1,1,1] -> then i=3: [1,1,0] -> then i=2: [1,0,0]. \n  But the function: \n      arr[1]=2: 2 % 1 == 0 -> True.\n      arr[2]=3: 3 % 1 == 0 -> True.\n  So it returns True.\n\nExample 3: the note says \"In the third test case, you can choose indices in the order 4,3,2.\" -> so it is possible.\n\nBut consider a test case: [2, 3]. \n  Operation1: i=2: [2, 1] (because 3-2=1)\n  Operation2: i=2: [2, 1-2] -> negative? The problem says the array consists of positive integers, and the operation: change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. After the first operation, we have [2,1] (positive). Then we can do: [2, 1-2] = [2, -1] -> negative. But the problem says \"positive integers\" initially, but the operations might create non-positive? The problem does not restrict to positive after operations. The goal is to make them zero.\n\n  But then we can do: \n      [2,3] -> [2,1] -> [2, -1] -> and then we cannot make the last element 0 by subtracting the previous (because 0 - 2 = -2, not -1). \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n      [2,3] -> [2,1] (at index2)\n      Then we can change the first element? We cannot, because the operation is only on indices i>=2.\n\n  How to make the second element 0? We can do:\n      [2,1] -> then we can do index2 again: [2, 1-2] = [2, -1]\n      Then we can do index2: [2, -1-2] = [2, -3] -> and so on, never 0.\n\n  Therefore, [2,3] is not solvable.\n\n  But the function `diff_ops` would check: 3 % 2 = 1, not 0 -> returns False -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\nBut consider [3, 5]:\n  Step1: [3,5] -> [3,2] (by subtracting 3 from 5)\n  Step2: [3,2] -> [3, -1] -> not good.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n      [3,5] -> [3,5-3]=[3,2] -> then we can do on the first element? We cannot.\n\n  How about if we have three elements: [3,5,2]?\n\n  We can do:\n      i=3: [3,5,2-5] = [3,5,-3] -> not allowed? The problem does not say we require positive, but the operation is defined and then we can continue.\n\n  But the goal is to make a_i=0 for i>=2. We don't care about the signs as long as we can eventually make them 0.\n\n  However, the problem says the array consists of positive integers initially.\n\n  Known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is: \n      It is possible if and only if the first element divides every element in the array.\n\n  Why? \n      The operation is: subtract the previous element any number of times. This is similar to the Euclidean algorithm. The element at position i can be reduced to the remainder when divided by the first element? But note: we can also change the first element? No, because the operation is only on indices>=2.\n\n      However, we can change the second element, then the third, then the second again, etc.\n\n      In fact, the entire array can be reduced to: \n          a1, a2 mod a1, a3 mod (a1 or a2?) -> it's complex.\n\n  But note: the operation on index i: \n        a_i becomes a_i - a_{i-1}\n        then if we do it again: a_i becomes a_i - 2*a_{i-1}\n        or if we do it on a different index first, the value of a_{i-1} might change.\n\n  However, a known solution for this problem (Codeforces Round #731 (Div. 3) problem A) is to check that every element is divisible by the first element.\n\n  But consider the example: [1,2,3] -> the first element is 1, and every element is divisible by 1 -> returns True -> \"YES\", which is correct.\n\n  And [2,3] -> 3 is not divisible by 2 -> returns False -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n  But consider [3, 6, 5]:\n      Step1: i=2: [3, 3, 5] -> then i=2 again: [3,0,5] -> then i=3: [3,0,5-0]=[3,0,5] -> then i=3: [3,0,5] -> we can do i=3 repeatedly: [3,0,5-0]=5, then 5-0=5, ... never 0.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n          [3,6,5] -> i=3: [3,6,5-6]=[3,6,-1] -> then i=2: [3,6-3=3,-1] -> then i=2: [3,0,-1] -> then i=3: [3,0,-1-0]=-1 -> not 0.\n\n      But if we do:\n          [3,6,5] -> i=2: [3,3,5] -> then i=3: [3,3,2] -> then i=3: [3,3, -1] -> then i=2: [3,0,-1] -> then i=3: [3,0,-1] -> not 0.\n\n      So it seems impossible.\n\n      The function `diff_ops` would check: \n          a1=3\n          a2=6: 6%3==0 -> True\n          a3=5: 5%3 !=0 -> False -> \"NO\"\n\n  But consider [4, 8, 6] (which is similar to the Euclidean algorithm for gcd(8,6)=2, which is not divisible by 4?).\n\n  How to reduce:\n      [4,8,6] -> \n        We can do i=2: [4,4,6] -> then i=3: [4,4,2] -> then i=3: [4,4,2-4]=[4,4,-2] -> then i=3: [4,4,-2-4]=[4,4,-6] -> ... not 0.\n\n      Alternatively, after [4,4,6]:\n        i=3: [4,4,2] -> then i=2: [4,4-4=0,2] -> then i=3: [4,0,2-0=2] -> then i=3: [4,0,2] -> ... not 0.\n\n      But if we do:\n        [4,8,6] -> i=3: [4,8,6-8]=[4,8,-2] -> then i=2: [4,8-4=4,-2] -> then i=2: [4,0,-2] -> then i=3: [4,0,-2] -> not 0.\n\n      So it is not possible.\n\n  Therefore, the function `diff_ops` is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the first element is not the gcd? Consider [3, 5, 7]:\n      We can do:\n        i=2: [3,2,7] \n        i=3: [3,2,5] \n        i=3: [3,2,3]\n        i=3: [3,2,1]\n        i=2: [3, -1,1] -> not good.\n\n      Alternatively, we might do more operations. But eventually, the element at index1 might become the gcd of the entire array? \n\n  However, the known solution in the editorial for Codeforces Round #731 (Div. 3), problem A (which is this problem) is:\n\n      We can only make the array [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0] if and only if for every i, a_i is divisible by a1.\n\n  Why? \n      Note: the operation on an element a_i: subtract a_{i-1} any number of times. This is equivalent to: we can replace a_i with a_i mod a_{i-1} (if we do enough subtractions) but only if a_{i-1} is positive and we are allowed to do until the value becomes negative? Actually, we can do until it becomes less than a_{i-1}. But then we can also change a_{i-1} by operations on it? \n\n      The operations are sequential and can be interleaved arbitrarily. However, the key is that the first element a1 never changes. Then the second element can be reduced to any nonnegative value of the form a2 - k * a1 (for k>=0) as long as it remains nonnegative? But the problem does not require nonnegativity, but eventually we want 0.\n\n      To get a2=0, we must have a2 = k * a1 for some k. So a1 must divide a2.\n\n      Then for the third element: we can reduce it by the second element (which is now 0) -> but we cannot reduce by 0? The operation: a_i becomes a_i - a_{i-1}. If a_{i-1} is 0, then a_i remains unchanged. So to make a3=0, we must have a3=0? But initially a3 is not 0. \n\n      How did the example [1,2,3] work? \n          Step1: i=3: [1,2,3-2=1] -> [1,2,1]\n          Step2: i=2: [1,2-1=1,1] -> [1,1,1]\n          Step3: i=3: [1,1,1-1=0] -> [1,1,0]\n          Step4: i=2: [1,1-1=0,0] -> [1,0,0]\n\n      In this process, the second element became 1 (which is divisible by the first element 1) and then the third element became 1 (divisible by 1). But note: after the first operation, the second element is still 2 (not divisible by 1) but then we changed it.\n\n      Therefore, the first element must divide every element in the array at the beginning? Not necessarily: because we can change the elements.\n\n      The known solution in the editorial is: \n          It is possible if and only if the greatest common divisor of the entire array is the first element, and the first element must divide every element.\n\n      But wait: in [1,2,3], the gcd is 1, and the first element is 1, and 1 divides every element.\n\n      In [2,3]: the gcd is 1, but the first element is 2, and 2 does not divide 3? -> not possible.\n\n      In [4,8,6]: the gcd is 2, but the first element is 4, and 4 does not divide 2? -> not possible.\n\n      But how about [2,4,6]? \n          The gcd is 2, and the first element is 2, and 2 divides every element -> then it is possible.\n\n      How to do it?\n          [2,4,6] -> \n            We want to make the second element 0: we can do 4 - 2*k = 0 -> k=2: so we do two operations on index2: \n                [2,4-2=2,6] -> [2,2,6]\n                [2,2-2=0,6] -> [2,0,6]\n            Then for the third element: we want 6 to become 0: we can do 6 - 0 repeatedly? but 6-0=6, so we cannot reduce it.\n\n      Therefore, we must reduce the third element before reducing the second element to 0.\n\n      Step1: reduce the third element: \n          [2,4,6] -> [2,4,6-4=2] -> [2,4,2]\n          Then reduce the second element: \n                [2,4-2=2,2] -> [2,2,2]\n                [2,2-2=0,2] -> [2,0,2]\n          Then reduce the third element: [2,0,2-0=2] -> [2,0,2] -> ... not 0.\n\n      Alternatively, after [2,4,2]:\n          reduce the third element again: [2,4,2-4=-2] -> then we have negatives.\n\n      How about:\n          [2,4,2] -> reduce the third element by the second element: [2,4,2-4=-2] -> then reduce the second element: [2,4-2=2,-2] -> then reduce the second element: [2,2-2=0,-2] -> then reduce the third element: [2,0,-2-0=-2] -> not 0.\n\n      So it seems impossible.\n\n      But the condition: the gcd is 2, and the first element is 2, and 2 divides every element. Why is it not working?\n\n      The editorial solution for the problem is: \n          We can simulate backwards? Or use the following: \n          Let g0 = a0, and then for i from 1 to n-1:\n              g_i = gcd(g_{i-1}, a_i)\n          Then it is possible if and only if there exists some g_i that is not zero and divides a_i? \n\n      Actually, the known solution in many submissions is:\n\n          def solve():\n              n = int(input())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              g = 0\n              for x in a:\n                  g = gcd(g, x)\n              if g == a[0]:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n      But in [2,4,6]: \n          g0 = 0 -> gcd(0,2)=2\n          g1 = gcd(2,4)=2\n          g2 = gcd(2,6)=2\n          then if g==a[0] -> 2==2 -> YES.\n\n      But our simulation failed.\n\n      Let me try again for [2,4,6]:\n          We can do:\n            First, make the third element divisible by 2? It is. But we need to make it 0.\n\n          Step1: i=3: [2,4,6-4=2] -> [2,4,2]\n          Step2: i=2: [2,4-2=2,2] -> [2,2,2]\n          Step3: i=3: [2,2,2-2=0] -> [2,2,0]\n          Step4: i=2: [2,2-2=0,0] -> [2,0,0]\n\n      So it is possible.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is that the gcd of the entire array is the first element.\n\n      But the function `diff_ops` currently checks that every element is divisible by the first element. This is a stronger condition. For [2,4,6]: \n          4 % 2 == 0, 6 % 2 == 0 -> True.\n\n      For [1,2,3]: \n          2 % 1 == 0, 3 % 1 == 0 -> True.\n\n      For [3,5,7]: \n          5 % 3 = 2 -> not 0 -> False.\n\n      But the gcd of [3,5,7] is 1, which is not 3 -> so it should be \"NO\", which matches.\n\n      However, consider [4, 8, 12] (gcd=4, and first element=4) -> then the function: 8%4=0, 12%4=0 -> True.\n\n      And [4, 8, 10]: \n          gcd(4,8,10)=2, which is not 4 -> should be \"NO\", and the function: 8%4=0, 10%4=2 -> not 0 -> \"NO\".\n\n      Therefore, the function `diff_ops` is actually checking that every element is divisible by the first element, which is a sufficient condition? \n\n      But is it necessary? \n          We want to make a_i=0 for i>=2. \n          For the second element to become 0, we must be able to subtract multiples of the first element (because the first element never changes) until we get 0. So we require that the first element divides the second element.\n          Then for the third element: after we have made the second element 0, we then can only subtract multiples of the first element (because the second element is 0) to reduce the third element. So we require that the first element divides the third element.\n          Similarly for every element.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n      So the function `diff_ops` is correct.\n\n  Now, the TODO in program3.py is in the main part:\n\n```python\n    input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    len_input = len(input_arr)\n    n = input_arr[0]\n    test_cases = []\n    pos = 1\n    while pos <= len_input - 1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n```\n\nWe need to read the test cases.\n\nThe input format: \n  The first line is t (number of test cases).\n  Then for each test case:\n        first line: n (the length of the array)\n        second line: n integers\n\nThe variable `n` is set to `input_arr[0]` which is t? Actually, the first integer in the input is t. But the code sets `n = input_arr[0]` and then uses `n` as the number of test cases? But the variable `n` is then used in the while loop? \n\nActually, the first integer is the number of test cases. Then for each test case, we read an integer n (the length of the array) and then n integers.\n\nBut the code sets `n = input_arr[0]` (which is t) and then we have `test_cases = []` and then a while loop.\n\nWe should do:\n\n```python\n    t = input_arr[0]\n    pos = 1\n    for i in range(t):\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut note: the input_arr is a list of integers. The first integer is t. Then for each test case, we have an integer n_i, and then n_i integers.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\n```python\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut the while loop condition is `while pos <= len_input - 1:`. We are reading t test cases, but the input might have exactly the integers for t test cases. We can change the while loop to a for loop for t times. But the problem says the first integer is t.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n```python\n    t = n   # because n = input_arr[0] is the number of test cases\n    for i in range(t):\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut the code sets `n = input_arr[0]` (which is t) and then the while loop runs until we have read all the input. We can do a for loop for `n` times (which is t).\n\nBut the variable `n` is set to the first integer (which is t). Then we can do:\n\n```python\n    for _ in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut the variable `n` is the number of test cases, and then we read each test case.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\n```python\n    for _ in range(n):\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut note: the variable `n` is the first integer (the number of test cases). And then we read each test case.\n\n However, the variable `n` is set to `input_arr[0]` (which is t) and then we use it in the for loop.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n But the while loop condition is `while pos <= len_input - 1:`. We are replacing it with a for loop that runs `n` times. We should remove the while loop and use the for loop.\n\n But the TODO is inside the while loop. We can change the while loop to a for loop.\n\n Alternatively, we can keep the while loop and break when we have read `n` test cases? But the problem says there are exactly `n` test cases.\n\n Since the input is fixed, we can do the for loop.\n\n Therefore, we replace the while loop with a for loop that runs `n` times.\n\n But the code currently has:\n\n```python\n    n = input_arr[0]\n    test_cases = []\n    pos = 1\n    while pos <= len_input - 1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe can change to:\n\n```python\n    t = input_arr[0]   # but the variable is called n, so we can use n as t\n    test_cases = []\n    pos = 1\n    for i in range(t):\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut the variable `n` is already set to `input_arr[0]` (which is t). So we can do:\n\n```python\n    for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nThis is the missing code.\n\n However, note: the variable `n` is the number of test cases, and then for each test case, the next integer is the length of the array for that test case.\n\n We then read `n_i` integers.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\n```python\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut we must do this for `n` (the number of test cases) times. So we replace the while loop with a for loop that runs `n` times.\n\n But the code structure is:\n\n```python\n    n = input_arr[0]\n    test_cases = []\n    pos = 1\n    while pos <= len_input - 1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe can change the while loop to a for loop that runs `n` times and put the TODO code inside.\n\n Alternatively, we can leave the while loop and break after reading `n` test cases. But the condition `pos <= len_input-1` might be true for the first test case, but we know the exact number of test cases.\n\n We'll do:\n\n```python\n    for i in range(n):\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut note: the variable `n` is the number of test cases, and we are reading `n` test cases.\n\n This will work.\n\n But what if there are more integers? The problem says the input is as described.\n\n We'll assume the input is well-formed.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is the above for loop.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and only the missing code.\n\n But the TODO is inside a while loop. We are replacing the while loop with a for loop. So we output the for loop and its body.\n\n But the existing code has:\n\n```python\n    while pos <= len_input - 1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe are replacing the while loop with a for loop. So the missing code is the entire for loop block.\n\n But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We can output:\n\n```python\n    for i in range(n):\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut note: the variable `n` is the number of test cases (which is the first integer).\n\n However, the variable `n` is already set to the first integer (the number of test cases). \n\n But the existing code sets `n = input_arr[0]` and then the while loop. We are replacing the while loop with the for loop.\n\n Therefore, the missing block for program3.py is the above for loop.\n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The existing code has the while loop with a TODO inside. We are replacing the while loop with a for loop. So we output the for loop block.\n\n However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are replacing the while loop (which is two lines: the while condition and the TODO comment) with a for loop block. So we output the for loop block.\n\n But note: the existing code has:\n\n```python\n    while pos <= len_input - 1:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe are replacing these two lines with the for loop block.\n\n Therefore, the completion for program3.py is the for loop block.\n\n But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the JSON.\n\n We'll output the string for the for loop block.\n\n However, the problem says: the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\", \"program2\", \"program3\", and the value is the completion (a string).\n\n We must be careful with the string: it should be exactly the code to insert.\n\n But note: the existing code in program3.py after the TODO is:\n\n```python\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n```\n\nSo we must not break the indentation.\n\n We'll output the for loop block with the same indentation as the while loop.\n\n The while loop is at the same level as the for loop that comes after.\n\n Therefore, the completion for program3.py is:\n\n```python\n    for i in range(n):\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\n        pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n        pos += n_i\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n```\n\nBut without the markdown, as a string.\n\n Now, we put it all together in a JSON.\n\n Example output:\n\n {\n   \"program1\": \"        curr += num\\n        result[idx] = curr\",\n   \"program2\": \"                mod_b = l % a\\n                if mod_b <= 2:\\n                    solutions.add(a)\",\n   \"program3\": \"    for i in range(n):\\n        n_i = input_arr[pos]\\n        pos += 1\\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\\n        pos += n_i\\n        test_cases.append(arr)\"\n }\n\n But note: the program1 completion is two lines, and we must be careful with the indentation.\n\n In program1, the existing code is:\n\n```python\n    for idx, num in enumerate(nums):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe replace the TODO with two lines:\n\n```python\n        curr += num\n        result[idx] = curr\n```\n\nSo the completion is two lines, each indented by 8 spaces (the same as the for loop).\n\n But the existing code has 8 spaces for the for loop and the TODO. So we output:\n\n        curr += num\n        result[idx] = curr\n\n But as a string, we must include the newline.\n\n Similarly, for program2, the existing code is:\n\n```python\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n```\n\nWe replace the TODO with:\n\n```python\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n```\n\nBut note: the existing code is already indented. The first line is at the same level as the TODO. So we output:\n\n                mod_b = l % a\n                if mod_b <= 2:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n But as a string, we must include the newlines.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output exactly the lines that are missing.\n\n For program3, we output the entire for loop block that replaces the while loop.\n\n But note: the while loop condition and the TODO are two lines. We are replacing them with 5 lines.\n\n We output the 5 lines as a string.\n\n Now, we write the JSON."
