For non-special arrays (operation1): \n   Operation1: subtract 1 from two indices i and j (with 2<=i<j<=m-1) and add 1 to i-1 and j+1. This operation preserves the total sum and also the linear combination: \n        for j from 2 to m-1: j * c[i][j] \n   because: \n        subtracting 1 at i: change = -i, and at j: change = -j. adding 1 at i-1: change = i-1, and at j+1: change = j+1.\n        total change in the linear combination: (i-1) + (j+1) - i - j = 0. For the special array (operation2):\n   Operation2: subtract 1 from indices i and j (2<=i<j<=m-2) and add 1 to i-1 and j+2. The linear combination with weights j (for index j) is not preserved? Let's check:\n        subtract at i: -i, at j: -j.\n        add at i-1: i-1, at j+2: j+2.\n        total: (i-1) + (j+2) - i - j = 1. Therefore, we can define a value for each array i: S_i = sum_{j=1}^{m} j * c_i[j]\n\n For non-special arrays (operation1 only): \n        The initial array b has S0 = sum_{j} j * b[j]. Operation1: does not change S_i -> so S_i remains S0. For the special array (operation2 only):\n        Each operation2 increases S_i by 1 (as shown above).",

But note: the problem says the total sum of n*m over test cases is <= 10^6, so n is at most 10^5 per test case? But the total n*m <= 10^6, so the number of arrays n per test case might be large but the total n over test cases is small?

Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Let S = [ ... ]  (n values)\n\n          We can count the frequency.

The total n over test cases is at most 10^6 / m? Actually, the constraint is the total n*m <= 10^6, so the total n (number of arrays) over test cases is at most 10^6 / m. Since m>=7, the total n over test cases is at most 10^6/7 which is about 142857. So we can do a loop over n for each test case.

Example: n=6, m=11. n=6: a=1, b=0, c=3. a>0: so we do: \n            while a>0 and 5*t<=m: \n                t *= 5 -> t=5, then b=1 -> now a==b? so we break. Then we do: while 10*t<=m: 10*5=50>11 -> skip. Then k = m - (m % t) = 11 - (11 % 5) = 11 - 1 = 10 -> then output 6*10=60. Example: n=5, m=43.\n        n=5: a=0, b=1, c=1. b>a: so we do:\n            while b>a and 2*t<=m: \n                t *= 2 -> t=2, then a=1 -> now a==b? so we break. Then while 10*t<=m: 10*2=20<=43 -> then t=20, then 10*20=200>43 -> so t=20. Then k = 43 - (43 % 20) = 43 - 3 = 40 -> output 5*40=200. Example: n=13, m=5.\n        n=13: a=0, b=0, c=13. Then we skip the while loops for a>0 or b>0. Then while 10*t<=m: 10>5 -> skip. Then k = 5 - (5%1)=5 -> output 13*5=65. But the note says: \"If it is impossible to get a more rounded price, output n*m\". In the example n=13, m=5: we output 65, which is n*m. Now, the TODO: In the case b>a, we need to multiply t by 2 until we either balance or exceed m. The code for a>0 is:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\n        Similarly, for b>a:\n\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1 So we write: elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n      But note: the condition: we can only multiply by 2 if 2*t <= m. Therefore, we complete the TODO with:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n      But note: the condition is in the while loop: we do while (b>a) and (2*t<=m). Then inside we do t*=2 and a+=1. So:\n\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n      This is symmetric to the a>b case. For program3.py:\n\n  We are to complete the code. The problem: \n      We are given an array a of n integers. We can do two operations:\n        1. Clone an existing array. 2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions. We want the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal. The code already does:\n\n        from collections import*\n        for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n = len(a := a.split())\n            m = max(Counter(a).values()) r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n  Explanation: The variable m is the maximum frequency of any element in the array. The idea:\n\n        We start with one copy. We can do:\n\n          Operation 1: clone -> then we have two copies. Operation 2: swap elements between copies to bring all the same element together. How many operations? Note: we can swap arbitrarily. We want to create one copy that has all the same element. The minimal number of operations: We note that we can use swaps to move elements. But we can also clone to get more copies to use as temporary storage. Insight:\n\n          We can think greedily:\n\n          Step 1: We start with one array. If the array already has all elements equal, then 0 operations. Step 2: Otherwise, we can do:\n\n            Operation 1: clone -> now we have two copies. Then we can swap two elements between the two copies to fix one element? Actually, the note example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> we want to create a copy of all zeros. Step 1: clone -> two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> operations=1 (clone)\n\n            Then we swap: \n                swap the element at index1 of the first array (which is 1) with the element at index0 of the second array (which is 0) -> \n                first array: [0,0,3,3,7,0] \n                second array: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> operations=2 (swap)\n\n            Then we swap: \n                swap the element at index2 of the first array (3) with the element at index5 of the second array (0) -> \n                first array: [0,0,0,3,7,0] \n                second array: [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> operations=3 (swap) Then we clone the first array: -> operations=4 (clone) -> now we have three copies: [0,0,0,3,7,0], [0,0,0,3,7,0], [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n\n            Then we swap: \n                swap the element at index3 of the first array (3) with the element at index0 of the third array (1) -> \n                first array: [0,0,0,1,7,0] -> not helpful. Actually, the example did:\n\n                After the first clone: two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                Then they swapped to get: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> then cloned the first array to get a third copy: [0,0,0,3,7,0] \n                Then swapped two elements from the first two copies:",

Then the answer is: \n                if m == n: 0\n                else:\n                    ans = 0\n                    cur = m\n                    while cur < n:\n                        ans += 1   # for cloning\n                        # Then we can swap: we can double the number of the desired element? #",

      "text": "Actually, after cloning, we have two arrays. Then we can swap to fix the target array: we can fix up to cur (the current number of the desired element in the target array) because the clone also has cur of the desired element? \n                        # But we can only swap as many as we have in the clone? \n                        # So we do: \n                        ans += min(cur, n - cur)\n                        cur += min(cur, n - cur) Then output ans. Example: \n            n=6, m=2 (the example array: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 for 0? but actually the example used 0, and m=2 for 0). Then:\n                cur = 2\n                while cur < 6:\n                    ans += 1   (clone) -> ans=1 then we can swap min(2, 4) = 2 times -> ans=1+2=3\n                    then cur = 2+2 = 4\n                Then again: \n                    cur=4 < 6 -> \n                    ans += 1 -> 4\n                    then swap min(4,2)=2 -> ans=6\n                    then cur=6 -> break. Output 6 -> matches. Why is that?\n\n            Step1: clone -> 1 operation. Then we have two arrays, each with 2 zeros. Then we swap two times: each swap moves one zero from the clone to the target array. So we get 2 more zeros in the target array -> 4 zeros. Cost: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n            Step2: we clone the target array (which now has 4 zeros) -> cost 1, so total 4. Then we swap two times: we move two zeros from the new clone to the target array? But the target array already has 4 zeros, and we want 6. The new clone has 4 zeros. We swap two zeros to the target array -> then the target array has 6 zeros. Cost: 2 swaps -> total 6. How does the code do?\n\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1   # for the clone\n                r += min(m, n-m)   # for the swaps we do in this round\n                m += min(m, n-m)   # we add that many to the target array\n\n          But note: in the next round, m becomes 2*m? However, in the example: \n            Initially: m0=2, n=6. Round1: \n                r += 1 -> 1\n                r += min(2,4)=2 -> 3\n                m = 2+2=4\n            Round2:\n                r += 1 -> 4\n                r += min(4,2)=2 -> 6\n                m = 4+2=6 -> break. Therefore, we complete the TODO with:\n\n                r += 1   # for the clone operation\n                # Then we can swap up to m times (because the clone we just created has m of the desired element) to the target array? # But note: we can only swap as many as we need: n - m (the current m) or as many as the clone has (which is the old m, but now we are updating m) -> actually, we are updating m after the round.\n\n                # Actually, the amount we can swap in this round is min(m, n-m) -> because the clone has m of the element, and we need n-m more.\n\n                # Then we do:\n                r += min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n          But note: the variable m is updated. However, the code uses:\n\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1\n                # Then we do: \n                r += min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m)\n\n          This matches.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given three programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n We are to find the special array index k and the number of times operation2 was used on it.\n\n Approach:\n The problem states that the arrays are generated from an initial array b by applying operations on each array.\n For non-special arrays (operation1): \n   Operation1: subtract 1 from two indices i and j (with 2<=i<j<=m-1) and add 1 to i-1 and j+1.\n   This operation preserves the total sum and also the linear combination: \n        for j from 2 to m-1: j * c[i][j] \n   because: \n        subtracting 1 at i: change = -i, and at j: change = -j.\n        adding 1 at i-1: change = i-1, and at j+1: change = j+1.\n        total change in the linear combination: (i-1) + (j+1) - i - j = 0.\n\n For the special array (operation2):\n   Operation2: subtract 1 from indices i and j (2<=i<j<=m-2) and add 1 to i-1 and j+2.\n   The linear combination with weights j (for index j) is not preserved? Let's check:\n        subtract at i: -i, at j: -j.\n        add at i-1: i-1, at j+2: j+2.\n        total: (i-1) + (j+2) - i - j = 1.\n\n Therefore, we can define a value for each array i:\n        S_i = sum_{j=1}^{m} j * c_i[j]\n\n For non-special arrays (operation1 only): \n        The initial array b has S0 = sum_{j} j * b[j].\n        Operation1: does not change S_i -> so S_i remains S0.\n\n For the special array (operation2 only):\n        Each operation2 increases S_i by 1 (as shown above).\n\n Therefore, if we compute S_i for each array, then:\n        The special array will have a value S_i that is greater than S0 (the common value for non-special arrays).\n        The number of times operation2 was used is (S_i - S0).\n\n However, note: we don't know S0. But we know that the non-special arrays should all have the same S_i (which is S0). \n The special array will be the one that has a different (and larger) value.\n\n But note: there are n arrays. We have one special array and n-1 non-special arrays. \n Therefore, the non-special arrays should have the same value, and the special array will be the outlier.\n\n Steps:\n   For each test case:\n      Read t (number of test cases) -> already handled by the initial code.\n      For each test case: \n          Read n, m.\n          Then read n arrays.\n\n      For each array i, compute:\n          S_i = sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (j+1) * c_i[j]   [because the array is 0-indexed, but the problem uses 1-indexed]\n\n      Now, we have n values of S_i.\n\n      Since there is one special array and n-1 non-special arrays, the non-special arrays should have the same value (say base_value) and the special array has base_value + x (where x is the number of operation2).\n\n      How to find the special array?\n          We can note that the non-special arrays are the majority. So the base_value is the mode? But note: the problem says the index is uniquely determined.\n\n      Alternatively, we can:\n          Find the minimum value among the S_i? But wait: the special array has a larger value? Yes, because each operation2 adds 1.\n\n      Therefore, the non-special arrays should have the same value, and the special array will be the one that is larger.\n\n      However, what if there are multiple non-special arrays? Then the base_value is the value that appears at least twice? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"It can be shown that the index of the special array is uniquely determined.\"\n\n      So we can:\n          Let base_value = the value that appears at least twice? Or we can take the minimum? \n          But note: the non-special arrays have the same value, and the special array is larger. So the base_value is the minimum? \n\n          However, consider: what if the non-special arrays have a value that is not the minimum? \n          Actually, the non-special arrays are the majority (n-1) and the special array is one. So the base_value must be the value that appears n-1 times? \n\n      How to do it:\n          We can group the S_i by frequency. The base_value will be the one that appears the most (n-1 times) and the special array is the one that is different.\n\n      But note: the problem says the total sum of n*m over test cases is <= 10^6, so n is at most 10^5 per test case? But the total n*m <= 10^6, so the number of arrays n per test case might be large but the total n over test cases is small? Actually, the constraint is on the total n*m (which is the total number of elements) over test cases <= 10^6.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Let S = [ ... ]  (n values)\n\n          We can count the frequency. But note: the values of S_i can be huge (because c_i,j up to 3e11 and m up to 300000 -> so S_i can be up to 300000 * 3e11 = 9e16). But we can use a dictionary? The total n over test cases is at most 10^6 / m? Actually, the constraint is the total n*m <= 10^6, so the total n (number of arrays) over test cases is at most 10^6 / m. Since m>=7, the total n over test cases is at most 10^6/7 which is about 142857. So we can do a loop over n for each test case.\n\n      Steps for one test case:\n          Read n, m.\n          arrays = []\n          for i in range(n):\n              read m integers -> store as list.\n\n          S = []\n          for i in range(n):\n              total = 0\n              for j, val in enumerate(arrays[i]):\n                  total += (j+1) * val\n              S.append(total)\n\n          Now, we have S[0..n-1]. We want to find the special array index and the number of operations.\n\n          Since the non-special arrays have the same value, and the special array has a different value, we can:\n\n          Option 1: \n             Find the value that appears only once -> that is the special array. Then the base_value is the value that appears at least twice.\n\n          But note: what if there are two non-special arrays that by chance have the same value? Actually, the problem states that the arrays are generated from the same b and then operations. The non-special arrays are generated by operation1 which does not change the linear combination. So they must be the same.\n\n          So we can:\n             base_value = None\n             special_value = None\n             Count the frequency of each value in S.\n\n             Then for each index i:\n                 if the frequency of S[i] is 1 -> then this is the special array.\n                 and the base_value is the value that appears more than once.\n\n          Then the number of operations = S[i] - base_value.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the operations are at least once. So the special array must have a value greater than base_value? Yes.\n\n          But what if the non-special arrays are not all the same? The problem states that they are generated from the same b and then operation1 (which preserves the linear combination). So they must be the same.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          freq = {}\n          for s in S:\n              freq[s] = freq.get(s,0) + 1\n\n          Then we look for the value that has frequency 1 -> that is the special array.\n\n          But note: what if there is a collision? The problem says the value of the linear combination for non-special arrays is the same. So the only value that appears once is the special one.\n\n          However, what if n=2? Then we have one non-special and one special. Then the non-special appears once? But then we have two distinct values, each appearing once. How to know which is the base_value? \n\n          Actually, the non-special array should have the base_value and the special array has base_value + x (x>0). So the base_value must be the minimum? \n\n          Therefore, we can also do:\n\n          Let min_val = min(S)\n          Then the non-special arrays should have min_val? But wait: what if the non-special arrays have a value that is not the minimum? \n\n          Actually, the special array is the one that is larger. So the non-special arrays must be the minimum? \n\n          However, consider: what if the non-special arrays have a value that is larger than the base_value? That cannot happen because the base_value is the value of the initial array, and the non-special arrays are generated by operation1 which does not change the linear combination. So they are base_value. The special array is base_value + x (x>0). Therefore, the non-special arrays are the minimum? \n\n          But what if there are multiple non-special arrays and one of them is the minimum? Actually, all non-special arrays are base_value, so the minimum value in S must be base_value. And the special array is the only one that is greater.\n\n          Therefore, we can:\n\n          base_value = min(S)   # because the non-special arrays are base_value and the special is base_value + x (x>0) so base_value is the minimum.\n\n          Then we find the index i such that S[i] != base_value -> that is the special array.\n\n          Then the number of operations = S[i] - base_value.\n\n          However, what if there are multiple arrays with the same value as base_value? That's the non-special arrays. And one array that is larger.\n\n          But note: the problem says the non-special arrays are n-1. So the minimum value should appear n-1 times? \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  special_index = i+1   # because the arrays are 1-indexed in the problem? The problem says the first array is c1, so we output the index (starting at 1)\n                  operations = S[i] - base_value\n                  break\n\n          But what if the minimum appears multiple times? Then the one that is not the minimum is the special one.\n\n          However, we must output the index of the array as given (the k-th array, the first array is index 1).\n\n          But note: the arrays are read in order. The first array is index 1.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"For given arrays c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\"\n\n          So we output: (special_index, operations)\n\n          But what if the minimum appears only once? Then we have a problem. But the non-special arrays are n-1, so the base_value must appear n-1 times. Therefore, the minimum must appear at least n-1 times? Actually, the non-special arrays are base_value, so base_value must appear n-1 times. Therefore, the maximum frequency of base_value is n-1. Then the special array is the one that is not base_value.\n\n          However, we can also have the case: what if the special array has a value that is less than base_value? But that is impossible because operation2 only increases the linear combination.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)   # which is the value of the non-special arrays\n          # Then the special array is the one that is not base_value. But note: there might be multiple non-special arrays, so we look for the one that is not base_value.\n\n          Actually, we can also do:\n\n          max_val = max(S)\n          if max_val == base_value: \n             # then all arrays are non-special? but there must be one special. So this case should not happen.\n          Actually, the problem states that the special array is present and the operations are at least once. So the special array must have a value greater than base_value.\n\n          Therefore, we can:\n\n          candidate_index = None\n          candidate_ops = None\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  candidate_index = i\n                  candidate_ops = S[i] - base_value\n\n          But note: there should be exactly one candidate.\n\n          However, we can also compute base_value as the mode? Actually, the mode should be the base_value and it should appear n-1 times.\n\n          But the problem says the total n*m <= 10^6, so we can do:\n\n          base_value = None\n          for value, count in Counter(S).items():\n              if count == n-1:\n                  base_value = value\n                  break\n\n          Then the special array is the one that is not base_value.\n\n          But what if n=1? Then we have one array. Then the base_value would not be found? The problem states n>=3.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n          from collections import Counter\n          countS = Counter(S)\n          for i, s_val in enumerate(S):\n              if countS[s_val] == 1:\n                  special_index = i\n                  # then we need base_value: which is the value that appears more than once? \n                  # we can take the next value that is not s_val? but there is only one other value? \n                  # Actually, the other values are all the same. So we can set base_value = next(iter(countS.keys() - {s_val}))\n                  # But note: there is only one other value? because the non-special arrays are all the same.\n\n          However, the problem says the non-special arrays are the same. So the other n-1 arrays are the same. Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = None\n          for val in countS:\n              if countS[val] == n-1:\n                  base_value = val\n                  break\n          if base_value is None:\n              # This should not happen, but if it does, we use the minimum? \n              base_value = min(S)\n\n          Then operations = s_val - base_value   (for the special array)\n\n          But note: the problem says the special array is the one that is generated by operation2 which increases the linear combination. So s_val must be greater than base_value.\n\n          However, we can also avoid the Counter if we do:\n\n          Let base_value = min(S)   # which is the value of the non-special arrays? \n          Then the special array is the one that is not base_value? But what if there are multiple base_value? Then we can pick the one that is not base_value.\n\n          Actually, we can:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          # Then the special array must be the one that is the maximum? But wait: what if there are two arrays that are not base_value? That cannot happen because there is only one special array.\n\n          Therefore, we can:\n\n          max_val = max(S)\n          if max_val == base_value:\n              # then all arrays are non-special? but that's impossible. So we must have at least one array that is greater? \n              # Actually, the problem states that the special array is present and operation2 is used at least once -> so there must be one array that is greater.\n\n          But note: the problem says the operations are at least once. So the special array must be greater.\n\n          Therefore, we can simply:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          # Then the special array is the one that has the maximum value? But wait: what if there are multiple arrays that are above base_value? That should not happen because there is only one special array.\n\n          Actually, we can:\n\n          special_index = None\n          max_val = -1\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] > base_value:\n                  # we expect only one such i\n                  if special_index is not None:\n                      # then we have two? but the problem says the special array is unique.\n                      # This should not happen.\n                      # But we can break and use the first one? \n                      # Actually, the problem says the index is uniquely determined. So we can break when we find the first one that is above base_value? \n                      # But what if there are two? Then we have an error. \n                  special_index = i\n                  max_val = S[i]\n\n          Then operations = max_val - base_value.\n\n          However, we must account for the possibility that there is exactly one array above base_value.\n\n          But note: the non-special arrays are base_value, so the other n-1 arrays are base_value. Therefore, there should be exactly one array that is not base_value.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          # Then the special array is the one that is not base_value. We can find the index of the maximum? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  special_index = i\n                  break\n\n          Then operations = S[i] - base_value.\n\n          But what if the base_value appears multiple times? Then we break at the first non-base_value? \n\n          However, we must output the index of the array as given (the k-th array). The arrays are read in order. The first array is index 1.\n\n          Therefore, we output: (special_index+1, operations)\n\n          But note: the problem says the arrays are given as c_1, c_2, ... c_n. So the first array we read is c_1 -> index 1.\n\n          However, what if the base_value is the first array? Then the special array is not the first? \n\n          Actually, we are iterating from 0 to n-1. When we break at the first non-base_value, that might be the first array? \n\n          But if the first array is non-special, then it is base_value. So we skip. Then we look for the next non-base_value.\n\n          But there is only one non-base_value. So we can:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  special_index = i\n                  operations = S[i] - base_value\n                  break\n\n          Then output: (special_index+1, operations)\n\n          However, we must be cautious: what if the special array is the last one? Then we break at the last one.\n\n          This loop will break at the first non-base_value. But what if the first array is non-base_value? Then we break at the first array. But if the first array is non-base_value, then it must be base_value? \n\n          Actually, the non-special arrays are base_value. So if an array is non-base_value, then it is the special array.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  print(i+1, S[i]-base_value)\n                  break\n\n          But what if the special array is the only one that is base_value? That cannot be because the non-special arrays are base_value and the special array is base_value+x (x>0). So the special array is not base_value.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  print(i+1, S[i]-base_value)\n                  break\n\n          However, what if there are multiple base_value? Then we break at the first non-base_value. But the non-base_value is the special array.\n\n          But note: the base_value is the minimum. So the non-base_value must be greater. And there is only one non-base_value.\n\n          But what if the minimum appears multiple times? Then the non-base_value is the one that is not the minimum. And we break at the first one. But the problem does not specify which array is the special one? Actually, the problem says the special array is uniquely determined. So we can output the first index where we find a value that is not base_value? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"the index of the special array is uniquely determined\". So there is only one array that is not base_value. Therefore, we can output the first index we find that is not base_value? \n\n          But note: the arrays are given in a fixed order. The problem does not say the special array is the first one that is not base_value. It is uniquely determined by the generation process. So we must output the index of that array in the input order.\n\n          Therefore, we can simply:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  k = i+1\n                  x = S[i] - base_value\n                  break\n\n          Then output: k, x\n\n          But note: what if the special array is the last one? Then we break at the last one? Actually, the loop will run until it finds the first non-base_value. But if the first non-base_value we encounter is the last one, then we break at the last one.\n\n          However, we are iterating from 0 to n-1. So we will find the first non-base_value in the order of the arrays. But the problem does not care about the order of the arrays? We must output the index as given. The first array is index 1, the second index 2, etc.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  print(i+1, S[i]-base_value)\n                  break\n\n          But wait: what if the special array is the only one that is base_value? That cannot be because the non-special arrays are base_value and the special array is base_value+x (x>0). So the special array is not base_value.\n\n          Therefore, the above loop will always break.\n\n          However, what if the base_value appears only once? Then the non-special arrays are not base_value? That contradicts. \n\n          Actually, the non-special arrays are base_value. So the base_value must appear n-1 times. Therefore, the minimum value must appear n-1 times. So the non-base_value appears only once.\n\n          Therefore, we can also do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          # Then the special array is the one that is the maximum? \n          # Actually, we can also do: \n          #   max_val = max(S)\n          #   if max_val == base_value: then we have a problem -> but that should not happen.\n\n          But note: the problem says the operations are at least once. So the special array must be greater.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          max_val = max(S)\n          # Then the special array is the one that has value = max_val, and there is only one such array.\n\n          Then we can find the index of max_val? But what if there are multiple max_val? That should not happen because the non-special arrays are base_value (the minimum) and the special array is the only one that is max_val.\n\n          Therefore, we can:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          max_val = max(S)\n          # Then the number of operations = max_val - base_value\n          # And the index: we need to find the index i such that S[i] == max_val.\n\n          But note: what if there are multiple arrays with max_val? Then we have a problem. But the problem says the special array is uniquely determined.\n\n          Therefore, we can:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] == max_val:\n                  print(i+1, max_val - base_value)\n                  break\n\n          But note: the problem says the non-special arrays are base_value. So the max_val must be unique? \n\n          Actually, the non-special arrays are base_value (the minimum). So the max_val must be unique. Therefore, we can break at the first occurrence of max_val? \n\n          However, what if the minimum appears multiple times? Then the max_val is the only one that is not the minimum. So we can break at the first max_val.\n\n          But note: the problem says the special array is uniquely determined.\n\n          Therefore, we can do either:\n\n          Option 1: \n            base_value = min(S)\n            for i in range(n):\n                if S[i] != base_value:\n                    print(i+1, S[i]-base_value)\n                    break\n\n          Option 2:\n            base_value = min(S)\n            max_val = max(S)\n            for i in range(n):\n                if S[i] == max_val:\n                    print(i+1, max_val - base_value)\n                    break\n\n          Both are acceptable.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n*m <= 10^6, but the arrays are large (m up to 300000) and n per test case might be large? But the total n*m is bounded by 10^6, so the total n (number of arrays) over test cases is at most 10^6 / m (which is at most 10^6/7). So we can do two passes: one to compute min and max, and one to find the index.\n\n          But we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          # Then we know the special array is the one that is not base_value. We can do:\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  k = i+1\n                  x = S[i] - base_value\n                  break\n\n          Then output k, x.\n\n          But note: what if the special array is the last one? Then we do a full scan. But the total n over test cases is at most 10^6/7, which is about 142857, so it's acceptable.\n\n          However, we can avoid the second scan by:\n\n          We can compute the min and then also note the index of the first non-min? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          min_val = S[0]\n          min_index = 0\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              if S[i] < min_val:\n                  min_val = S[i]\n                  min_index = i   # but we don't need the min_index for the base_value, we need the non-min.\n\n          Then we know the base_value = min_val.\n\n          Then we can do:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != min_val:\n                  k = i+1\n                  x = S[i] - min_val\n                  break\n\n          But we already computed the min in the first loop? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          base_value = min(S)\n          # Then we can do:\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] != base_value:\n                  k = i+1\n                  x = S[i] - base_value\n                  break\n\n          This is two passes: one for min(S) and one for the loop.\n\n          But note: the min(S) is O(n) and the loop is O(n). The total n per test case is the number of arrays, which is at most 10^5? But the total n over test cases is at most 10^6/7, so it's acceptable.\n\n          However, we can do in one pass:\n\n          min_val = S[0]\n          candidate_index = None\n          candidate_val = None\n          for i in range(n):\n              if S[i] < min_val:\n                  min_val = S[i]\n              # Also, we can remember the first non-min? But we don't know the min until the end.\n\n          Then we have to do a second pass.\n\n          So we do two passes.\n\n Implementation:\n\n          t, = R()   # already read\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n, m = R()\n              arrays = []\n              for i in range(n):\n                  arr = list(R())\n                  arrays.append(arr)\n\n              S = []\n              for arr in arrays:\n                  total = 0\n                  for j in range(m):\n                      total += (j+1) * arr[j]\n                  S.append(total)\n\n              base_value = min(S)\n              for i in range(n):\n                  if S[i] != base_value:\n                      k = i+1\n                      x = S[i] - base_value\n                      break\n\n              print(k, x)\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n*m <= 10^6. The inner loop for j in range(m) for each array: that would be n * m per test case. But the total n*m over test cases is <= 10^6. So we are safe.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6\". So we can do:\n\n          total_elements = 0\n          for test_case in test_cases:\n              n, m = ...\n              total_elements += n * m\n\n          and total_elements <= 10^6.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          t, = R()\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n, m = R()\n              S = []\n              for i in range(n):\n                  arr = list(R())\n                  total = 0\n                  for j in range(m):\n                      total += (j+1) * arr[j]\n                  S.append(total)\n\n              base = min(S)\n              for i in range(n):\n                  if S[i] != base:\n                      print(i+1, S[i]-base)\n                      break\n\n          But note: what if the special array is the last one? Then we break at the last one. That's fine.\n\n          However, we must output one line per test case.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"For each test case, output one line containing two integers\"\n\n          Therefore, we output: print(str(k) + \" \" + str(x))\n\n          But the problem says: \"It can be shown that under the constraints given in the problem, this value is unique and won't exceed 10^18, so you can represent it as a 64-bit integer.\" -> so we output the integer.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the total n*m is 10^6, but the values in the array are up to 3e11, and m up to 300000 -> the total S[i] can be as large as 300000 * 3e11 = 9e16, which is within 64-bit integer (Python int is arbitrary precision, but the arithmetic might be slow? But the total n*m is 10^6, so we do 10^6 multiplications? That is acceptable.\n\n          Let's test with the example: \n            Example 1: \n                b = [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0] -> m=9\n                Then for the non-special arrays: \n                    S0 = 0*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 1*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 + 0*9 = 2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 35\n                For the special array: \n                    Operation2: one time -> so S = 35+1 = 36.\n\n                Then we have three arrays: two with 35 and one with 36.\n\n                Then we output: the index of the array with 36, and 1.\n\n          Example 2: \n                b = [20,20,20,20,20,20,20] -> m=7\n                S0 = 20*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7) = 20 * 28 = 560.\n                The special array: one operation2 -> 561.\n\n          Example 3: same as example2.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n          R = lambda: map(int, input().split())\n          t, = R()\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n, m = R()\n              S = []\n              for i in range(n):\n                  arr = list(R())\n                  total = 0\n                  for j in range(m):\n                      total += (j+1) * arr[j]\n                  S.append(total)\n\n              base = min(S)\n              for i in range(n):\n                  if S[i] != base:\n                      print(i+1, S[i]-base)\n                      break\n\n          But note: what if the special array is the first one? Then we break at the first array. Then we output (1, S[0]-base). But base = min(S) = min(S[0], ...). If the first array is the special one, then base is the minimum of the rest? \n\n          Example: \n            Arrays: [36, 35, 35] -> base = min([36,35,35]) = 35. Then we check the first array: 36 != 35 -> output (1,1). Correct.\n\n          Therefore, we are done.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n  We are to complete the code.\n\n  The problem: \n      Given n and m, we can choose an integer k in [1, m] to maximize the number of trailing zeros in n*k, and if there are multiple, choose the maximum n*k.\n\n  The code already does:\n\n      a = b = 0\n      c = n\n      while c % 2 == 0:\n          a += 1\n          c //= 2\n      while c % 5 == 0:\n          b += 1\n          c //= 5\n\n      Then: \n        if a > b:\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n      Then: \n        while 10 * t <= m:\n            t *= 10\n\n      Then output: n * (m - (m % t))\n\n  Explanation:\n\n      We factor n as: n = 2^a * 5^b * c, where c is coprime with 10.\n\n      To maximize the trailing zeros, we need to balance the factors 2 and 5. The number of trailing zeros is min(a + added_2, b + added_5).\n\n      The code starts with t=1. Then:\n\n        If a > b: we are short of 5s. So we can multiply by 5 until we have enough 5s? But note: we can only multiply by 5 as long as 5*t <= m.\n\n        Similarly, if b > a: we are short of 2s. So we multiply by 2.\n\n      Then, after balancing, we can multiply by 10 as long as 10*t <= m? But note: multiplying by 10 adds one zero. But we can also multiply by 10 multiple times? \n\n      However, the code then does:\n\n        while 10 * t <= m:\n            t *= 10\n\n      Then we set k = m - (m % t)   -> which is the largest multiple of t that is <= m.\n\n      Then output n * k.\n\n      Why is that?\n\n      Example: n=6, m=11.\n\n        n=6: a=1, b=0, c=3.\n        a>0: so we do: \n            while a>0 and 5*t<=m: \n                t *= 5 -> t=5, then b=1 -> now a==b? so we break.\n            Then we do: while 10*t<=m: 10*5=50>11 -> skip.\n            Then k = m - (m % t) = 11 - (11 % 5) = 11 - 1 = 10 -> then output 6*10=60.\n\n      Example: n=5, m=43.\n        n=5: a=0, b=1, c=1.\n        b>a: so we do:\n            while b>a and 2*t<=m: \n                t *= 2 -> t=2, then a=1 -> now a==b? so we break.\n            Then while 10*t<=m: 10*2=20<=43 -> then t=20, then 10*20=200>43 -> so t=20.\n            Then k = 43 - (43 % 20) = 43 - 3 = 40 -> output 5*40=200.\n\n      Example: n=13, m=5.\n        n=13: a=0, b=0, c=13.\n        Then we skip the while loops for a>0 or b>0.\n        Then while 10*t<=m: 10>5 -> skip.\n        Then k = 5 - (5%1)=5 -> output 13*5=65.\n\n      But the note says: \"If it is impossible to get a more rounded price, output n*m\". \n        In the example n=13, m=5: we output 65, which is n*m.\n\n      Now, the TODO: \n        In the case b>a, we need to multiply t by 2 until we either balance or exceed m.\n\n        The code for a>0 is:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\n        Similarly, for b>a:\n\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n      So we write:\n\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n      But note: the condition: we can only multiply by 2 if 2*t <= m.\n\n      Therefore, we complete the TODO with:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n      But note: the condition is in the while loop: we do while (b>a) and (2*t<=m). Then inside we do t*=2 and a+=1.\n\n      So:\n\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n      This is symmetric to the a>b case.\n\n For program3.py:\n\n  We are to complete the code.\n\n  The problem: \n      We are given an array a of n integers. We can do two operations:\n        1. Clone an existing array.\n        2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\n      We want the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\n  The code already does:\n\n        from collections import*\n        for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n = len(a := a.split())\n            m = max(Counter(a).values())\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n  Explanation:\n\n      The variable m is the maximum frequency of any element in the array.\n\n      The idea:\n\n        We start with one copy. We can do:\n\n          Operation 1: clone -> then we have two copies.\n          Operation 2: swap elements between copies to bring all the same element together.\n\n        How many operations?\n\n        Note: we can swap arbitrarily. We want to create one copy that has all the same element.\n\n        The minimal number of operations:\n\n          We note that we can use swaps to move elements. But we can also clone to get more copies to use as temporary storage.\n\n        Insight:\n\n          We can think greedily:\n\n          Step 1: We start with one array. If the array already has all elements equal, then 0 operations.\n\n          Step 2: Otherwise, we can do:\n\n            Operation 1: clone -> now we have two copies. Then we can swap two elements between the two copies to fix one element? \n\n          Actually, the note example:\n\n            [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> we want to create a copy of all zeros.\n\n            Step 1: clone -> two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> operations=1 (clone)\n\n            Then we swap: \n                swap the element at index1 of the first array (which is 1) with the element at index0 of the second array (which is 0) -> \n                first array: [0,0,3,3,7,0] \n                second array: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> operations=2 (swap)\n\n            Then we swap: \n                swap the element at index2 of the first array (3) with the element at index5 of the second array (0) -> \n                first array: [0,0,0,3,7,0] \n                second array: [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> operations=3 (swap)\n\n            Then we clone the first array: -> operations=4 (clone) -> now we have three copies: [0,0,0,3,7,0], [0,0,0,3,7,0], [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n\n            Then we swap: \n                swap the element at index3 of the first array (3) with the element at index0 of the third array (1) -> \n                first array: [0,0,0,1,7,0] -> not helpful.\n\n            Actually, the example did:\n\n                After the first clone: two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                Then they swapped to get: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> then cloned the first array to get a third copy: [0,0,0,3,7,0] \n                Then swapped two elements from the first two copies: \n                    [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [3,7,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n\n            How many operations? \n                clone1: 1\n                swap1: 2\n                swap2: 3\n                clone2: 4\n                swap3: 5\n                swap4: 6\n\n            So 6 operations.\n\n        How to compute?\n\n          We note that the maximum frequency m: if m=2 (for the element 0 in the example) then we have two zeros. We need to have n zeros in one copy.\n\n          How to get more zeros? We can swap zeros from other arrays. But we can also create more arrays to hold the non-zero elements.\n\n          The process:\n\n            Operation 1: clone the array -> we have two copies. Then we can swap a non-zero from the first array with a zero from the second array. This gives the first array one more zero. Then we can do this for each zero we want to add.\n\n          But note: we can do multiple swaps in one operation? The problem says: one swap per operation.\n\n          How many zeros do we need? We need n - m zeros to be added to the target array.\n\n          How do we get one zero? \n            We need to have a zero in another array to swap. Initially, we have one array. Then we clone to get a second array. Then we can swap one element: we can take one zero from the second array and put it in the first array, and in return we put a non-zero from the first array to the second array. This increases the count of zeros in the first array by 1.\n\n          Then we can do the same for the next zero: but now the second array has one less zero? \n\n          Actually, we can use the same second array to provide multiple zeros? But if we have multiple zeros in the second array, we can swap one at a time.\n\n          However, after we take one zero from the second array, the second array has one less zero. Then we need to get that zero back? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use a third array? \n\n          The example did:\n\n            After the first clone: two arrays, each with two zeros.\n\n            Then they swapped two zeros from the second array to the first array? Actually, they did two swaps: \n                First swap: put a zero in the first array at index1 (by swapping the 1 at index1 with a zero from the second array at index0? but the second array initially has zeros at index0 and index5). \n                Then they swapped the 3 at index2 of the first array with the zero at index5 of the second array? \n\n            So after two swaps, the first array has four zeros? \n\n          Actually, the first array initially had two zeros. After the first swap: we swapped the element at index1 (which was 1) with a zero from the second array -> so the first array becomes [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> three zeros. \n          Then the second swap: we swapped the element at index2 (which was 3) with the zero at index5 of the second array -> but the second array at index5 was originally 0, but after the first swap we swapped the element at index0 of the second array (which was 0) with the 1 from the first array -> so the second array becomes [1,1,3,3,7,0]. Then we swap the 3 at index2 of the first array with the 0 at index5 of the second array -> the first array becomes [0,0,0,3,7,0] (four zeros) and the second array becomes [1,1,3,3,7,3] (no zeros? but we swapped the last zero).\n\n          Then we cloned the first array to get a third copy: [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> then we swapped the 3 and 7 in the first two copies? \n\n          Actually, the example says: \n            [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [3,7,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n\n          How did they get the first array to be all zeros? They swapped the 3 and 7 from the first array with zeros from the second array? But the second array only had two zeros? \n\n          Actually, the second array after the two swaps is [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> no zeros. Then the third array is [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> no zeros. Then the first array has [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> we need to remove the 3 and 7. \n\n          They did: \n            swap the 3 at index3 of the first array with the 0 at index2 of the second array? but the second array doesn't have a zero. \n\n          Actually, they swapped with the third array? But the third array is a clone of the first array? \n\n          After the second clone, we have three arrays: \n            A1: [0,0,0,3,7,0]\n            A2: [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n            A3: [0,0,0,3,7,0]\n\n          Then they swapped two elements: \n            swap the 3 at index3 of A1 with the 0 at index0 of A3 -> then A1 becomes [0,0,0,0,7,0] and A3 becomes [3,0,0,3,7,0]\n            swap the 7 at index4 of A1 with the 0 at index1 of A3 -> then A1 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0] and A3 becomes [3,7,0,3,7,0]\n\n          So two more swaps.\n\n          Total operations: \n            clone1: 1\n            swap1: 2\n            swap2: 3\n            clone2: 4\n            swap3: 5\n            swap4: 6\n\n          Therefore, 6 operations.\n\n        How to generalize?\n\n          We start with one array. We want to create a copy that has all the same element. The element we choose is the one with the highest frequency (m).\n\n          We need to add (n - m) copies of that element to the target array.\n\n          How do we get one additional copy?\n\n            We can clone the current array (operation1) to get a new array. Then we can swap an element that we want (say x) from the new array to the target array, and in return we give an element that we don't want from the target array to the new array. This costs 2 operations (clone and swap) and gives one additional x in the target array.\n\n          But note: we can use the same clone for multiple swaps? \n\n          Actually, after we clone, we have two arrays. Then we can do multiple swaps? \n\n          However, the new array (the clone) initially has the same elements as the target array. So if we want to get an x from the clone, we must have an x in the clone. But the target array also has the same x? \n\n          How do we get an x that is not in the target array? \n\n          Actually, we are trying to get more x in the target array. The target array initially has m x's. The clone also has m x's. \n\n          We can swap an x from the clone to the target array, and in return we swap a non-x from the target array to the clone. This increases the count of x in the target array by 1 and decreases the count of x in the clone by 1.\n\n          Then we can do the same again: but the clone now has m-1 x's. We can do this until the clone runs out of x's? \n\n          But we can also clone again? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use multiple clones: \n\n            Operation 1: clone -> we have two arrays. Then we do one swap: then we have one more x in the target array. Then we can clone again? \n\n          But note: we can also use the same clone for multiple swaps: we can do up to m swaps from the same clone? \n\n          However, the problem does not restrict the number of swaps per array. \n\n          Therefore, to get one additional x in the target array, we can:\n\n            If we have a clone that has at least one x, then we can do one swap to get that x to the target array.\n\n          How many operations? \n            We need to create the clone: 1 operation (if we don't have one already). Then each swap: 1 operation.\n\n          But we can use one clone to get multiple x's? \n\n          For example, if we have a clone that has k x's, then we can do k swaps to get k x's from that clone to the target array. The cost: 1 (for the clone) + k (for the swaps) = k+1 operations.\n\n          Then we can create a new clone to get more x's? \n\n          How many x's do we need? n - m.\n\n          How many x's do we have in the entire system? \n            Initially: one array with m x's.\n            Then we clone: two arrays, each with m x's -> total 2m x's.\n            Then we do k swaps: we move k x's from the clone to the target array. Then the target array has m+k x's, and the clone has m-k x's. The total is still 2m.\n\n          Then we can create a second clone: \n            We clone the target array? Then we have a third array that is a copy of the target array (which has m+k x's). Then we can use that third array to get more x's? \n\n          But note: we can also clone the original array? \n\n          Actually, we can clone any array. \n\n          The minimal operations:\n\n            We need to get (n-m) additional x's in the target array.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              Step 1: Create a clone of the initial array -> cost 1, now we have two arrays, each with m x's.\n\n              Step 2: Use the clone to provide as many x's as possible: we can take min(m, n-m) x's from the clone. \n                      But note: we can take at most m x's from the clone (because it has m x's). \n                      So we take k1 = min(m, n-m) x's -> cost k1 (swaps).\n\n              Then we have the target array with m + k1 x's.\n\n              If we still need more x's (if n-m > m), then we do:\n\n                  Step 3: Create a new clone: we can clone the target array (which now has m+k1 x's) -> cost 1.\n                  Step 4: Then we take k2 = min(m+k1, n-m-k1) x's from the new clone? \n\n              But note: the new clone has m+k1 x's. We can take up to m+k1 x's? \n\n              However, we don't want to break the target array? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We can create a clone and then use that clone to provide one x per operation? \n\n            But that would be 2 operations per x: 1 for the clone (if we don't have one) and 1 for the swap. But we can use the same clone for multiple x's.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let r = 0 (operations count)\n            Let current = m   (current number of x in the target array)\n            Let clones = 0   (number of clones we have)\n\n            While current < n:\n                If we have no clone: \n                    clone the target array -> clones++ -> r += 1\n                Then, we can swap one x from a clone to the target array. But which clone? \n\n                However, we can use any clone that has at least one x. \n\n                How many x's are available in a particular clone? \n\n                Actually, we can use the first clone we created until it runs out of x's.\n\n            But note: we can create multiple clones. \n\n          However, the known solution in the community for this problem is:\n\n            Let m = max frequency.\n            Then the answer is: \n                if m == n: 0\n                else:\n                    ans = 0\n                    cur = m\n                    while cur < n:\n                        ans += 1   # for cloning\n                        # Then we can swap: we can double the number of the desired element? \n                        # Actually, after cloning, we have two arrays. Then we can swap to fix the target array: we can fix up to cur (the current number of the desired element in the target array) because the clone also has cur of the desired element? \n                        # But we can only swap as many as we have in the clone? \n                        # So we do: \n                        ans += min(cur, n - cur)\n                        cur += min(cur, n - cur)\n\n            Then output ans.\n\n          Example: \n            n=6, m=2 (the example array: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 for 0? but actually the example used 0, and m=2 for 0).\n\n            Then:\n                cur = 2\n                while cur < 6:\n                    ans += 1   (clone) -> ans=1\n                    then we can swap min(2, 4) = 2 times -> ans=1+2=3\n                    then cur = 2+2 = 4\n                Then again: \n                    cur=4 < 6 -> \n                    ans += 1 -> 4\n                    then swap min(4,2)=2 -> ans=6\n                    then cur=6 -> break.\n\n            Output 6 -> matches.\n\n          Why is that?\n\n            Step1: clone -> 1 operation. Then we have two arrays, each with 2 zeros.\n            Then we swap two times: each swap moves one zero from the clone to the target array. So we get 2 more zeros in the target array -> 4 zeros. Cost: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n            Step2: we clone the target array (which now has 4 zeros) -> cost 1, so total 4. Then we swap two times: we move two zeros from the new clone to the target array? But the target array already has 4 zeros, and we want 6. The new clone has 4 zeros. We swap two zeros to the target array -> then the target array has 6 zeros. Cost: 2 swaps -> total 6.\n\n          How does the code do?\n\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1   # for the clone\n                r += min(m, n-m)   # for the swaps we do in this round\n                m += min(m, n-m)   # we add that many to the target array\n\n          But note: in the next round, m becomes 2*m? \n\n          However, in the example: \n            Initially: m0=2, n=6.\n            Round1: \n                r += 1 -> 1\n                r += min(2,4)=2 -> 3\n                m = 2+2=4\n            Round2:\n                r += 1 -> 4\n                r += min(4,2)=2 -> 6\n                m = 4+2=6 -> break.\n\n          Therefore, we complete the TODO with:\n\n                r += 1   # for the clone operation\n                # Then we can swap up to m times (because the clone we just created has m of the desired element) to the target array? \n                # But note: we can only swap as many as we need: n - m (the current m) or as many as the clone has (which is the old m, but now we are updating m) -> actually, we are updating m after the round.\n\n                # Actually, the amount we can swap in this round is min(m, n-m) -> because the clone has m of the element, and we need n-m more.\n\n                # Then we do:\n                r += min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n          But note: the variable m is updated.\n\n          However, the code uses:\n\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1\n                # Then we do: \n                r += min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m)\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But why is the clone operation only one per round? \n\n          Because we only need to clone once per round to get a new array that has the current state of the target array (which has m of the desired element). Then we use that entire clone to provide up to m swaps (if we need m) or n-m swaps (if we need less).\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1\n                swap_count = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swap_count\n                m += swap_count\n\n          Then print(r)\n\n          Example: n=1 -> m=1 -> skip the loop -> output 0.\n          Example: n=2, m=1: \n                while 1<2:\n                    r=1\n                    swap_count = min(1,1)=1\n                    r=1+1=2\n                    m=1+1=2 -> break -> output 2.\n\n          How? \n            Start: [a,b] (and we want all a's? but the max frequency is 1, so we choose the element that is the most frequent? but there are two distinct elements. Actually, we can choose either. Let the target be a. \n            Operation1: clone -> two arrays: [a,b] and [a,b]\n            Operation2: swap the b in the first array with the a in the second array -> then first array becomes [a,a] and second becomes [b,b]. \n            Then we have a copy [a,a] -> done. 2 operations.\n\n          Therefore, the code:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n = len(a := a.split())\n                # But note: the array a is split, but the array might have negative numbers? but we are counting frequency by string representation? \n                # However, the problem says: the array elements are integers. But we are splitting the string. \n                # But the input: the second line of the test case: n integers. \n                # Example: \"1 2 3\" -> split -> ['1','2','3'] -> then we count frequency: \n                #   Counter will count the string representations. But the same integer in different string representations? \n                #   But the input is space separated integers. \n                #   However, the problem: the array can have negative numbers: so we have to be cautious? \n                #   But the example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> as string: ['0','1','3','3','7','0'] -> then m = max frequency = 2 (for '0' and '3'? actually '3' appears twice, '0' appears twice) -> so m=2.\n\n                # But note: what if the same number appears as a string and as a different representation? e.g., \"1\" and \"01\" -> but the input is integers, so no leading zeros.\n\n                # Therefore, we can use the string as is.\n\n                m = max(Counter(a).values())\n                r = 0\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1   # clone operation\n                    # Then we can swap min(m, n-m) times\n                    swap_count = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += swap_count\n                    m += swap_count\n                print(r)\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5. The while loop: \n            Each round: m becomes m + min(m, n-m) = at least 2*m? \n            So the number of rounds is O(log(n)).\n\n          Therefore, it is efficient.\n\n  Summary:\n\n    program1.py: \n        We compute the linear combination S_i = sum_{j=1}^{m} j * c_i[j] for each array i.\n        Then base_value = min(S_i)\n        Then we find the first array i such that S_i != base_value, and output (i+1, S_i - base_value)\n\n    program2.py:\n        We complete the elif block with:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\n    program3.py:\n        We complete the while loop with:\n            r += 1\n            swap_count = min(m, n - m)\n            r += swap_count\n            m += swap_count\n\n  Now, we output the missing code for each program in the specified JSON format.\n\n  Note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". For program1.py, the missing code is the entire block for the test case. For program2.py, the missing code is the two lines in the TODO. For program3.py, the missing code is the body of the while loop.\n\n  However, note the existing code in program1.py:\n\n      R=lambda:map(int,input().split());G=range;t,=R()\n      for _ in G(t):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we must fill the TODO in program1.py.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is in the elif block.\n\n  In program3.py, the TODO is the body of the while loop.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      \"program1\": \"n, m = R()\\n  S = []\\n  for i in range(n):\\n      arr = list(R())\\n      total = 0\\n      for j in range(m):\\n          total += (j+1) * arr[j]\\n      S.append(total)\\n  base = min(S)\\n  for i in range(n):\\n      if S[i] != base:\\n          print(i+1, S[i]-base)\\n          break\"\n\n      \"program2\": \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n      \"program3\": \"r += 1\\nswap_count = min(m, n - m)\\nr += swap_count\\nm += swap_count\"\n\n  But note: the program2 code has an indentation. The existing code has:\n\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we fill the two lines with the same indentation.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the JSON.\n\n  We must be cautious: the program1 code must be exactly the block that goes in the for loop.\n\n  But note: the existing code in program1.py has:\n\n      for _ in G(t):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with the block.\n\n  We write the block as a string. We must preserve the indentation.\n\n  We use 2 spaces for each level? The existing code uses 2 spaces? Actually, the initial code uses 2 spaces for the for loop.\n\n  We'll use 2 spaces for the inner blocks.\n\n  For program1.py:\n\n      n, m = R()\n      S = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          arr = list(R())\n          total = 0\n          for j in range(m):\n              total += (j+1) * arr[j]\n          S.append(total)\n      base = min(S)\n      for i in range(n):\n          if S[i] != base:\n              print(i+1, S[i]-base)\n              break\n\n  But note: the initial code uses a lambda for R and G. We use R() to read integers.\n\n  For program2.py: we output the two lines: \"t *= 2\" and \"a += 1\", with the same indentation as the while loop.\n\n  For program3.py: we output the three lines: \n        r += 1\n        swap_count = min(m, n - m)\n        r += swap_count\n        m += swap_count\n\n  But note: the existing code in program3.py has:\n\n        while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we write the three lines with the same indentation.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: the entire block (with the same level of indentation as the for loop body) but without the initial comment.\n\n      program2: the two lines that go inside the while loop.\n\n      program3: the three lines that go inside the while loop.\n\n  We format the JSON.\n\n  Important: We must escape newlines and quotes? But the problem says: output the missing code.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      \"program1\": \"n, m = R()\\n  S = []\\n  for i in range(n):\\n      arr = list(R())\\n      total = 0\\n      for j in range(m):\\n          total += (j+1) * arr[j]\\n      S.append(total)\\n  base = min(S)\\n  for i in range(n):\\n      if S[i] != base:\\n          print(i+1, S[i]-base)\\n          break\"\n\n      But note: the indentation: the entire block is inside the for _ in G(t): loop. The initial for loop is at the same level as the for _ in G(t):. We use 2 spaces for the inner blocks? \n\n      Actually, the existing code uses 2 spaces for the for loop body? \n\n      We'll write:\n\n          for _ in G(t):\n            n, m = R()\n            S = []\n            ... \n\n      The initial for loop in the test case has an indentation of 2 spaces? \n\n      We'll use 2 spaces for the first level, and then 4 for the inner loops.\n\n      But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the problem says the code must run.\n\n      We'll use:\n\n          for _ in G(t):\n            n, m = R()\n            S = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                arr = list(R())\n                total = 0\n                for j in range(m):\n                    total += (j+1) * arr[j]\n                S.append(total)\n            base = min(S)\n            for i in range(n):\n                if S[i] != base:\n                    print(i+1, S[i]-base)\n                    break\n\n      The inner loops: 4 spaces for the body of the for i in range(n): and then 6 for the inner for j.\n\n      But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the string as above.\n\n  We write the JSON.\n\n  Note: the program2 code: we output two lines: \"t *= 2\" and \"a += 1\", but we must put them as two separate lines? \n\n      We can do: \"t *= 2\\na += 1\"\n\n  Similarly, program3: \"r += 1\\nswap_count = min(m, n - m)\\nr += swap_count\\nm += swap_count\"\n\n  But note: the program3 code: the variable n is the length of the array, and m is the max frequency. We use the same variable names.\n\n  Now, we output the JSON.\n\n  Example: \n      {\n        \"program1\": \"n, m = R()\\n  S = []\\n  for i in range(n):\\n      arr = list(R())\\n      total = 0\\n      for j in range(m):\\n          total += (j+1) * arr[j]\\n      S.append(total)\\n  base = min(S)\\n  for i in range(n):\\n      if S[i] != base:\\n          print(i+1, S[i]-base)\\n          break\",\n        \"program2\": \"t *= 2\\na += 1\",\n        \"program3\": \"r += 1\\nswap_count = min(m, n - m)\\nr += swap_count\\nm += swap_count\"\n      }\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the JSON without any extra spaces? \n\n  We'll output the JSON as a string.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and then the JSON.\n\n  We output the JSON.\n\n  But note: the program1 code has a break. What if the special array is the last one? Then we break at the last one. That is acceptable.\n\n  We are done."
