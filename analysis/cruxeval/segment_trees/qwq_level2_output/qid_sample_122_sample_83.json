The function f1 is defined as taking a string. It checks if the first 4 characters are not equal to 'Nuva'. If they aren't, it returns 'no'. Otherwise, it returns the string with any trailing whitespace removed using rstrip(). \n\nThe input here is 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'. The first four characters are 'Nuva' exactly, right? Because 'Nuva' is 4 letters. So the condition string[:4] != 'Nuva' would be false. Therefore, it goes to the else clause and returns the original string with rstrip(). But looking at the input string 'Nuva?dlfuyjys', I don't see any trailing whitespace. So f1 would just return the same string as input, since there's nothing to strip. So the result of f1('Nuva?dlfuyjys') is 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'.\n\nNow, this result is passed to f2. Let's look at f2's code. The function f2 takes a text parameter. It does a rpartition on '0'. Wait, rpartition splits the string into three parts: everything before the last occurrence of '0', the '0' itself, and everything after. But here, the partition is on '0', so it's looking for the last '0' in the string. \n\nWait, the input to f2 here is the output of f1, which is 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'. Let me check that string. The characters in 'Nuva?dlfuyjys' \u2013 are there any '0's in there? Let me see: N, u, v, a, ?, d, l, f, u, y, j, y, s. No zeros. So the rpartition('0') would split the string into three parts where the second part is empty, because there's no '0' found. \n\nIn the code for f2, after doing l = text.rpartition('0'), it checks if l[2] is empty. Wait, the rpartition returns (left part, separator, right part). If the separator isn't found, then the left part is the entire string and the right part is empty. So in this case, since there's no '0', l would be (original string, '', ''). So l[2] is empty. Therefore, the code returns '-1:-1'.\n\nWait, but the code says: if l[2] == '', then return '-1:-1'. So yes, exactly. So in this case, since the input to f2 has no '0's, the result is '-1:-1'.\n\nTherefore, the final result of f2(f1('Nuva?dlfuyjys')) is '-1:-1', so the assert statement should have that as the expected value. The user wants just the output, so the answer is '-1:-1' enclosed in single quotes."
