My job is to complete that assert with the correct output.\n\nFirst, let me look at the functions. The first function is f1, which takes a list called values. Inside f1, it sorts the values in place and returns them. So when you call f1 with a list, it will sort the list and return the sorted list. Since the input here is [1,1,1,1], sorting it would just return the same list because all elements are already 1s.
