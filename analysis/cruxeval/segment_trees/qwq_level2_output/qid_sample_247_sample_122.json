Let me start by looking at the functions f1 and f2.\n\nFirst, the function f1 takes a string s. The first condition checks if s.isalpha(). 'Boolean' is the input here. Let's check if 'Boolean' is all alphabetic characters. 'Boolean' is all letters, so s.isalpha() would return True. Therefore, f1 should return \"yes\".\n\nSo f1('Boolean') returns \"yes\". Now, this result is passed to f2. So now we need to evaluate f2(\"yes\").\n\nLooking at f2's code: it checks if the first 4 characters of the string are 'Nuva'. The input here is \"yes\", which is 3 characters long. So string[:4] would be 'yes' (since there's no 4th character), which is not equal to 'Nuva'. Therefore, the first condition in f2 is true, so it returns 'no'.\n\nWait, the first line of f2 is if string[:4] != 'Nuva': return 'no'. So if the first four characters are not 'Nuva', return 'no'. Since \"yes\" is 3 letters, the first four characters can't be 'Nuva', so it returns 'no'. Therefore, the final output of f2(f1('Boolean')) is 'no'.\n\nSo the assert statement should compare this result to 'no'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'no'."
