Yes. So the reversed string is:\n\n\"taefreppu litnu live delstrew E\"\n\nWait, but when written as a single string without spaces between the words, it's:\n\n\"taefreppulitnulivedelstrew E\"\n\nWait, but the spaces are preserved. So the actual reversed string includes the spaces in their reversed positions. So the exact string is:\n\n\"taefreppu litnu live delstrew E\"\n\nWait, but let me write it all together with the spaces:\n\n\"taefreppu litnu live delstrew E\"\n\nWait, but the space between \"delstrew\" and E is the original first space after E, so the reversed string has that space before the E. So the final character is E preceded by a space.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user provided two functions, f1 and f2, and wants me to figure out what the assert statement's right-hand side should be. The test case is f2(f1('E wrestled evil until upperfeat', 'e')). I need to compute the output of this and then put it in the assert.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each function does. Let's look at f1 first. The function f1 takes two parameters: text and letter. The first thing it does is check if the letter is lowercase. If it is, it converts it to uppercase. Then, it processes the text by replacing every occurrence of the lowercase version of that letter with the uppercase letter. Wait, no, actually, the code says: for each character in text, if the character is equal to letter.lower(), then replace it with letter. But since letter was already made uppercase if it was lowercase, then letter.lower() would be the lowercase version again. Wait, maybe I should walk through the code step by step.\n\nLet me think: Suppose the input letter is 'e'. Then, since it's lowercase, we set letter to 'E'. Then, for each character in the text, we check if the character is equal to letter.lower(), which would be 'e'. So, every occurrence of 'e' (lowercase) in the text is replaced with the uppercase letter (which is 'E'). But also, the original text's uppercase letters might be affected? Wait, no. Because the code is checking each character in the text. So, for example, if the original text has an uppercase 'E', then when comparing to letter.lower() (which is 'e'), it won't match, so it stays as is. But the code replaces all lowercase 'e's with the uppercase letter (which is 'E'), and leaves other characters as they are. Then, after that, the text is capitalized. Wait, the return is text.capitalize(). So the entire string is made to have the first character capitalized, and the rest lowercase? Wait, no, capitalize() makes the first character uppercase and the rest lowercase. Hmm, that's important.\n\nWait, let me re-express the code for f1:\n\ndef f(text, letter):\n    if letter.islower():\n        letter = letter.upper()  # So letter is uppercase now\n    # Now, create a new string where each character in text is replaced:\n    # if the character is equal to letter.lower() (so lowercase version of the original letter?), then replace with letter (uppercase)\n    # else keep the original character\n    new_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char == letter.lower():\n            new_text.append(letter)\n        else:\n            new_text.append(char)\n    # Then, join into a string and capitalize it\n    return ''.join(new_text).capitalize()\n\nWait, no, the code uses a list comprehension: [letter if char == letter.lower() else char for char in text]. So the same as above. Then, after building that string, it's capitalized. So the entire string's first character is made uppercase, and the rest lowercase? Wait, no, capitalize() makes the first character uppercase and the rest lowercase. So even if the first character was already uppercase, it would stay, but the rest would be lowercased. Hmm, that's a key point.\n\nSo, let's take the test case: the input to f1 is the string 'E wrestled evil until upperfeat' and the letter 'e'. Let's process this step by step.\n\nFirst, the letter is 'e', which is lowercase, so we convert it to 'E'. Then, we process each character in the text. The letter.lower() is 'e', so we are looking for all lowercase 'e's in the text and replacing them with 'E'.\n\nThe original text is: 'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n\nLet me write out each character:\n\nOriginal text: \"E\" \" \" \"w\" \"r\" \"e\" \"s\" \"t\" \"l\" \"e\" \"d\" \" \" \"e\" \"v\" \"i\" \"l\" \" \" \"u\" \"n\" \"t\" \"i\" \"l\" \" \" \"u\" \"p\" \"p\" \"e\" \"r\" \"f\" \"e\" \"a\" \"t\"\n\nWait, let me split the input string properly. Let me write it out:\n\nThe input string is 'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n\nBreaking it down word by word:\n\n- \"E\" (capital E)\n- \"wrestled\" (lowercase letters, with an 'e' in the second position, then another 'e' at the end? Let's see: 'wrestled' is spelled w-r-e-s-t-l-e-d. So the letters are w, r, e, s, t, l, e, d. So two 'e's here.\n- \"evil\" has an 'e' at the start.\n- \"until\" has a 'u' then 'n', 't', 'i', 'l' \u2014 no 'e's here.\n- \"upperfeat\" \u2014 let's see: u-p-p-e-r-f-e-a-t. So there's an 'e' after the 'r', and another 'e' before 'a'.\n\nSo in the entire string, the lowercase 'e's are in:\n\n- The third character (the first word's second character is 'r', third is 'e' in 'wrestled')\nWait, let me go through each character step by step.\n\nOriginal text: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\nBreaking down each character:\n\n1. 'E' (uppercase)\n2. ' ' (space)\n3. 'w'\n4. 'r'\n5. 'e' (lowercase e)\n6. 's'\n7. 't'\n8. 'l'\n9. 'e' (another lowercase e)\n10. 'd'\n11. ' ' (space)\n12. 'e' (start of 'evil')\n13. 'v'\n14. 'i'\n15. 'l'\n16. ' ' (space)\n17. 'u'\n18. 'n'\n19. 't'\n20. 'i'\n21. 'l'\n22. ' ' (space)\n23. 'u'\n24. 'p'\n25. 'p'\n26. 'e' (another e here)\n27. 'r'\n28. 'f'\n29. 'e' (another e)\n30. 'a'\n31. 't'\n\nSo all the lowercase 'e's (since the letter is 'e', and we are replacing any char equal to letter.lower() which is 'e') are at positions 5,9,12,26,29. So those will be replaced with 'E' (since letter is now uppercase).\n\nSo after the replacement, the text becomes:\n\nLet me go through each character:\n\n1. 'E' (unchanged, since it's uppercase and the replacement is for lowercase 'e's)\n2. ' ' (space)\n3. 'w' (no change)\n4. 'r' (no change)\n5. 'E' (replaced from 'e')\n6. 's' (no change)\n7. 't' (no change)\n8. 'l' (no change)\n9. 'E' (replaced from 'e')\n10. 'd' (no change)\n11. ' ' (space)\n12. 'E' (replaced from 'e')\n13. 'v' (no change)\n14. 'i' (no change)\n15. 'l' (no change)\n16. ' ' (space)\n17. 'u' (no change)\n18. 'n' (no change)\n19. 't' (no change)\n20. 'i' (no change)\n21. 'l' (no change)\n22. ' ' (space)\n23. 'u' (no change)\n24. 'p' (no change)\n25. 'p' (no change)\n26. 'E' (replaced from 'e')\n27. 'r' (no change)\n28. 'f' (no change)\n29. 'E' (replaced from 'e')\n30. 'a' (no change)\n31. 't' (no change)\n\nSo the new text after replacement is:\n\nE  W R E S T L E D   E V I L   U N T I L   U P P E R F E A T\n\nWait, let me write it all out:\n\nOriginal after replacement:\n\nE (position1) followed by space, then w, r, E (position5), s, t, l, E (position9), d, space, E (position12), v, i, l, space, u, n, t, i, l, space, u, p, p, E (position26), r, f, E (position29), a, t.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\"E WreStled Evil Until UpperfEaT\" \u2014 but wait, let me write the exact string:\n\nThe first character is 'E', then space, then 'w', 'r', 'E', 's', 't', 'l', 'E', 'd', space, 'E', 'v', 'i', 'l', space, 'u', 'n', 't', 'i', 'l', space, 'u', 'p', 'p', 'E', 'r', 'f', 'E', 'a', 't'.\n\nSo the entire string after replacement is:\n\n\"E WreStled Evil Until UpperfEaT\"\n\nWait, but let me check the exact letters:\n\nBreaking down the entire string after replacement:\n\n1. E\n2. (space)\n3. w\n4. r\n5. E\n6. s\n7. t\n8. l\n9. E\n10. d\n11. (space)\n12. E\n13. v\n14. i\n15. l\n16. (space)\n17. u\n18. n\n19. t\n20. i\n21. l\n22. (space)\n23. u\n24. p\n25. p\n26. E\n27. r\n28. f\n29. E\n30. a\n31. t\n\nSo the string is:\n\n\"E WreStled Evil Until UpperfEaT\"\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\nE (space) W r E s t l E d (space) E v i l (space) u n t i l (space) u p p E r f E a t.\n\nWait, the first word is \"E\" (the first character), then \" W\" (space W?), no, the first word is \"E\" followed by space, then \"w\" etc. So the first part is \"E WreStled\" \u2014 because after the first E, the next letters are w, r, E (so \"Wre\"), then s t l E d (so \"Stled\" with the E in the 5th position making it \"WreStled\"? Wait, let me see:\n\nBreaking down the first word after the initial E:\n\nAfter the first E and space, the next letters are w, r, E (position5), s, t, l, E (position9), d. So that's \"w r E s t l E d\" \u2192 \"wrEstled\" \u2192 \"WreStled\" (since the letters are lowercase except the E's). So the first word after the initial E is \"WreStled\".\n\nThen comes \" Evil\" (since the next word starts with E (position12)), so \"Evil\".\n\nThen \" Until\" (the next word is \"until\", but the 'u' is lowercase, so it remains, so \"Until\" (since the first 'u' is lowercase, so the word is \"until\" but the first letter is lowercase? Wait, no, the 'u' in \"until\" is lowercase, so it stays as 'u', so the word is \"until\" but the first letter is lowercase. Wait, but in the replacement, only the 'e's are changed. So \"until\" has no 'e's, so it remains as \"until\".\n\nWait, the next part after \"Evil\" is \" until\" (with a space and then \"until\"). So the next word is \"until\".\n\nThen the last part is \" upperfeat\" becomes \" upperfEaT\"? Let's see: the original was \"upperfeat\". The letters are u, p, p, e (position26), r, f, e (position29), a, t. So after replacement, the e's at positions 26 and 29 become E. So the word becomes \"upperfEaT\" \u2014 because the e after 'r' becomes E, and the e before 'a' becomes E. So the letters are u p p E r f E a t \u2192 \"upperfEaT\".\n\nPutting it all together, the string after replacement is:\n\n\"E WreStled Evil Until upperfEaT\"\n\nWait, but the first character is already uppercase, so when we apply .capitalize() to the entire string, what happens?\n\nThe capitalize() method converts the first character to uppercase (which it already is) and the rest to lowercase. Wait, no: capitalize() makes the first character uppercase and the rest lowercase, regardless of their original case.\n\nSo the entire string after replacement is:\n\n\"E WreStled Evil Until upperfEaT\"\n\nThen, when we apply capitalize(), the entire string's first character is already uppercase, so it stays. The rest of the characters are converted to lowercase. Wait, no, the entire string is the result of the list comprehension, then we call .capitalize() on that.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\ntext = ''.join([ ... ]) \u2192 that's the replaced string as above. Then return text.capitalize().\n\nSo the entire string after replacement is the string I wrote above (with uppercase E's in some places), and then capitalize() is applied to it.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take the replaced string as:\n\nOriginal replaced string (before capitalize):\n\nE WreStled Evil Until upperfEaT\n\nWait, let me write it exactly as the characters are after replacement:\n\nThe first character is 'E', then space, then 'w', 'r', 'E', 's', 't', 'l', 'E', 'd', space, 'E', 'v', 'i', 'l', space, 'u', 'n', 't', 'i', 'l', space, 'u', 'p', 'p', 'E', 'r', 'f', 'E', 'a', 't'.\n\nSo the entire string is:\n\n\"E WreStled Evil Until upperfEaT\"\n\nNow, when we call capitalize() on this string, it will make the first character uppercase (already is), and the rest of the characters lowercase. So all letters after the first will be lowercase.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So the entire string after capitalize() will have the first character as uppercase, and the rest lowercase, regardless of their previous case.\n\nSo let's process that:\n\nOriginal replaced string:\n\nE WreStled Evil Until upperfEaT\n\nAfter capitalize():\n\nThe first character is 'E' (uppercase, stays). The rest of the string is converted to lowercase.\n\nSo the rest of the string (from position 1 onwards) becomes lowercase.\n\nSo let's go through each character after the first:\n\nPosition 1: ' ' (space) \u2192 remains.\n\nPosition 2: 'W' \u2192 becomes 'w'\n\nPosition 3: 'r' \u2192 stays 'r'\n\nPosition4: 'e' (since the original replaced character was 'E' at position5? Wait, no, let me re-express the replaced string again.\n\nWait, the replaced string after the list comprehension is:\n\nThe first character is 'E', then space, then 'w', 'r', 'E' (position5), 's', 't', 'l', 'E' (position9), 'd', etc.\n\nWait, the replaced string before capitalize is:\n\nE W r E s t l E d ... etc. So the second character is space, then third is 'w', fourth 'r', fifth 'E', etc.\n\nWait, let me re-express the entire string after replacement (before capitalize):\n\nThe first character is 'E', then space, then 'w', 'r', 'E', 's', 't', 'l', 'E', 'd', space, 'E', 'v', 'i', 'l', space, 'u', 'n', 't', 'i', 'l', space, 'u', 'p', 'p', 'E', 'r', 'f', 'E', 'a', 't'.\n\nSo the entire string is:\n\n\"E WreStled Evil Until upperfEaT\"\n\nNow, when we apply capitalize(), the first character is already uppercase, so it stays. The rest of the characters (from index 1 onwards) are converted to lowercase.\n\nSo let's process each character after the first:\n\nCharacter 1: space \u2192 remains.\n\nCharacter 2: 'W' \u2192 lowercase \u2192 'w'\n\nCharacter 3: 'r' \u2192 stays 'r'\n\nCharacter4: 'e' (since the replaced character at position5 was 'E', but in the string, the 5th character is 'E'? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nWait, the replaced string's characters after the first are:\n\nAfter the first 'E', the next characters are:\n\nspace (position2), 'w' (position3), 'r' (position4), 'E' (position5), 's' (position6), etc.\n\nWait, the second character is space (position2), third is 'w' (position3), fourth 'r' (position4), fifth 'E' (position5), etc.\n\nSo when we apply capitalize(), the entire string from position1 (the first character is E) onwards, the rest (from position1 onwards?) Wait, no, the first character is position0. So the first character is E (position0). The rest (positions 1 to end) are converted to lowercase.\n\nSo:\n\nPosition0: E \u2192 stays.\n\nPosition1: space \u2192 stays.\n\nPosition2: 'W' \u2192 lowercase \u2192 'w'\n\nPosition3: 'r' \u2192 lowercase \u2192 'r' (no change)\n\nPosition4: 'e' (since the replaced character at position5 is 'E', but position4 is 'r', so position4 is 'r' \u2192 lowercase 'r' (no change).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go step by step for each character after the first.\n\nLet me list all characters after the first (position0 is E):\n\nThe rest of the string (positions 1 to 30):\n\nPosition1: ' ' \u2192 remains.\n\nPosition2: 'W' \u2192 lowercase \u2192 'w'\n\nPosition3: 'r' \u2192 lowercase \u2192 'r'\n\nPosition4: 'e' (since the replaced character at position5 is 'E', but position4 is 'r'? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express the entire string after replacement as a list of characters:\n\nThe replaced string (before capitalize) is:\n\nIndex 0: 'E'\n\n1: ' '\n\n2: 'w'\n\n3: 'r'\n\n4: 'E' (from the fifth character in the original, which was 'e' \u2192 replaced to 'E')\n\n5: 's'\n\n6: 't'\n\n7: 'l'\n\n8: 'E' (from the ninth character in original, which was 'e')\n\n9: 'd'\n\n10: ' ' (space)\n\n11: 'E' (from the twelfth character, which was 'e')\n\n12: 'v'\n\n13: 'i'\n\n14: 'l'\n\n15: ' ' (space)\n\n16: 'u'\n\n17: 'n'\n\n18: 't'\n\n19: 'i'\n\n20: 'l'\n\n21: ' ' (space)\n\n22: 'u'\n\n23: 'p'\n\n24: 'p'\n\n25: 'E' (from the 26th character, which was 'e')\n\n26: 'r'\n\n27: 'f'\n\n28: 'E' (from the 29th character, which was 'e')\n\n29: 'a'\n\n30: 't'\n\nSo the entire string after replacement is:\n\nE (0) space (1) w (2) r (3) E (4) s (5) t (6) l (7) E (8) d (9) space (10) E (11) v (12) i (13) l (14) space (15) u (16) n (17) t (18) i (19) l (20) space (21) u (22) p (23) p (24) E (25) r (26) f (27) E (28) a (29) t (30)\n\nNow, applying capitalize() to this string:\n\nThe first character (index0) is 'E' \u2192 stays.\n\nAll other characters (indices 1 to 30) are converted to lowercase.\n\nSo:\n\nIndex1: ' ' \u2192 remains.\n\nIndex2: 'w' \u2192 lowercase (already lowercase).\n\nIndex3: 'r' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex4: 'E' \u2192 becomes 'e'\n\nIndex5: 's' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex6: 't' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex7: 'l' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex8: 'E' \u2192 becomes 'e'\n\nIndex9: 'd' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex10: ' ' \u2192 remains.\n\nIndex11: 'E' \u2192 becomes 'e'\n\nIndex12: 'v' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex13: 'i' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex14: 'l' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex15: ' ' \u2192 remains.\n\nIndex16: 'u' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex17: 'n' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex18: 't' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex19: 'i' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex20: 'l' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex21: ' ' \u2192 remains.\n\nIndex22: 'u' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex23: 'p' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex24: 'p' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex25: 'E' \u2192 becomes 'e'\n\nIndex26: 'r' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex27: 'f' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex28: 'E' \u2192 becomes 'e'\n\nIndex29: 'a' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nIndex30: 't' \u2192 lowercase.\n\nSo after capitalize(), the string becomes:\n\nE (index0)\n\nthen:\n\nspace (1)\n\nw (2)\n\nr (3)\n\ne (4, from E)\n\ns (5)\n\nt (6)\n\nl (7)\n\ne (8, from E)\n\nd (9)\n\nspace (10)\n\ne (11, from E)\n\nv (12)\n\ni (13)\n\nl (14)\n\nspace (15)\n\nu (16)\n\nn (17)\n\nt (18)\n\ni (19)\n\nl (20)\n\nspace (21)\n\nu (22)\n\np (23)\n\np (24)\n\ne (25, from E)\n\nr (26)\n\nf (27)\n\ne (28, from E)\n\na (29)\n\nt (30)\n\nPutting this all together, the string after f1 is:\n\n\"E wreStled evil until upperfeat\"\n\nWait, let me write it out step by step:\n\nStarting with E, then the rest:\n\nE (0)\n\nspace (1)\n\nw (2)\n\nr (3)\n\ne (4)\n\ns (5)\n\nt (6)\n\nl (7)\n\ne (8)\n\nd (9)\n\nspace (10)\n\ne (11)\n\nv (12)\n\ni (13)\n\nl (14)\n\nspace (15)\n\nu (16)\n\nn (17)\n\nt (18)\n\ni (19)\n\nl (20)\n\nspace (21)\n\nu (22)\n\np (23)\n\np (24)\n\ne (25)\n\nr (26)\n\nf (27)\n\ne (28)\n\na (29)\n\nt (30)\n\nSo the entire string is:\n\n\"E wreStled evil until upperfeat\"\n\nWait, let me check each part:\n\nFirst part after E is \"wreStled\" \u2014 because the fourth character (index4) is 'e', so the sequence is w r e s t l e d \u2192 \"wreStled\" (since the 'E's at positions4 and 8 in the original replaced string became lowercase 'e's after capitalize. Wait, no, the 'E's at positions4 and 8 in the replaced string (before capitalize) were converted to lowercase 'e's. So the first word after the initial E is \"wreStled\" \u2192 no, let's see:\n\nThe first word after the initial E is \"wreStled\" \u2014 let's see:\n\nThe characters after the first E are:\n\nw (index2), r (3), e (4), s (5), t (6), l (7), e (8), d (9). So that's \"wreStled\" \u2192 wait, no, the letters are w, r, e, s, t, l, e, d \u2192 \"wrestled\" but with the 'e's in lowercase. Wait, the 'e's at positions4 and 8 (original replaced E's) are now lowercase, so the word is \"wrestled\" (all lowercase except the first 'w' which is lowercase). Wait, the first character after the initial E is 'w', which was lowercase, so it stays lowercase. So the first word after E is \"wreStled\" \u2192 no, actually, the entire word is \"wrestled\" with the 'e's in lowercase. Wait, the first 'e' (position4) is now lowercase, so the word is \"wrestled\".\n\nWait, the first part after the initial E is \"wreStled\" \u2192 no, let me see:\n\nThe letters are:\n\nw (lowercase), r (lowercase), e (lowercase), s (lowercase), t (lowercase), l (lowercase), e (lowercase), d (lowercase). So the word is \"wrestled\".\n\nThen comes a space and \"evil\" (since the next part is e (lowercase), v, i, l \u2192 \"evil\".\n\nThen \" until\" (the next word is \"until\" with lowercase letters, so \"until\".\n\nThen \" upperfeat\" \u2014 the last part after the space is u p p e r f e a t \u2192 \"upperfeat\".\n\nWait, the last part after the space at index21 is \"upperfeat\".\n\nPutting it all together, the string after f1 is:\n\n\"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nThe first character is E, then \" wrestled evil until upperfeat\".\n\nYes, because all the uppercase letters except the first E have been converted to lowercase. So the result of f1 is \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\".\n\nWait, but let me check the exact letters again:\n\nAfter capitalize, the entire string is:\n\nE (uppercase) followed by the rest in lowercase. So the entire string is:\n\n\"E\" followed by the rest of the characters in lowercase. So the replaced string had some uppercase letters (the E's from the replacements), but after capitalize, all those are lowercase except the first character.\n\nSo the final output of f1 is \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\".\n\nNow, the next step is to apply f2 to this result. Let's look at f2's code.\n\nThe function f2 takes a string s and returns ''.join(reversed(s.rstrip())). So, first, it strips any trailing whitespace from the string (rstrip()), then reverses it, then joins the reversed characters into a string.\n\nWait, the code for f2 is:\n\ndef f(s):\n    return ''.join(reversed(s.rstrip()))\n\nSo, first, s.rstrip() removes trailing whitespace. The original string from f1 is \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\" \u2014 does it have any trailing whitespace? Let's see the original input to f1 was 'E wrestled evil until upperfeat' \u2014 the input ends with 'upperfeat', so the output of f1 is \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\" \u2014 which also ends with 't', so no trailing space. So s.rstrip() is the same as the original string.\n\nThen, reversed(s.rstrip()) reverses the entire string, and ''.join converts it into a string.\n\nSo let's reverse the string \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\".\n\nFirst, let's write the string as a list of characters:\n\nThe string is:\n\nE w r e s t l e d   e v i l   u n t i l   u p p e r f e a t\n\nWait, let me write it exactly:\n\nThe string after f1 is \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nCharacters:\n\nE (0)\n\nspace (1)\n\nw (2)\n\nr (3)\n\ne (4)\n\ns (5)\n\nt (6)\n\nl (7)\n\ne (8)\n\nd (9)\n\nspace (10)\n\ne (11)\n\nv (12)\n\ni (13)\n\nl (14)\n\nspace (15)\n\nu (16)\n\nn (17)\n\nt (18)\n\ni (19)\n\nl (20)\n\nspace (21)\n\nu (22)\n\np (23)\n\np (24)\n\ne (25)\n\nr (26)\n\nf (27)\n\ne (28)\n\na (29)\n\nt (30)\n\nTotal length is 31 characters (indices 0-30).\n\nReversing this string would start from the last character (index30) and go backward.\n\nThe reversed string would be:\n\nt a e f r e p p u   l i t n u   l i v e d e l t s e r w   E\n\nWait, let me do it step by step.\n\nOriginal string: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\nReversed:\n\nTake each character in reverse order:\n\nOriginal last character is 't' (index30) \u2192 first in reversed.\n\nThen 'a' (29), 'e' (28), 'f' (27), 'r' (26), 'e' (25), 'p' (24), 'p' (23), 'u' (22), space (21), 'l' (20), 'i' (19), 't' (18), 'n' (17), 'u' (16), space (15), 'l' (14), 'i' (13), 'v' (12), 'e' (11), space (10), 'd' (9), 'e' (8), 'l' (7), 't' (6), 's' (5), 'e' (4), 'r' (3), 'w' (2), space (1), 'E' (0).\n\nSo the reversed string is:\n\nt a e f r e p p u   l i t n u   l i v e d e l t s e r w E\n\nWait, let's write it as a string:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nt (from index30)\n\na (29)\n\ne (28)\n\nf (27)\n\nr (26)\n\ne (25)\n\np (24)\n\np (23)\n\nu (22)\n\nspace (21)\n\nl (20)\n\ni (19)\n\nt (18)\n\nn (17)\n\nu (16)\n\nspace (15)\n\nl (14)\n\ni (13)\n\nv (12)\n\ne (11)\n\nspace (10)\n\nd (9)\n\ne (8)\n\nl (7)\n\nt (6)\n\ns (5)\n\ne (4)\n\nr (3)\n\nw (2)\n\nspace (1)\n\nE (0)\n\nSo putting all together:\n\n\"t a e f r e p p u   l i t n u   l i v e d e l t s e r w E\"\n\nWait, but when we join the reversed list, it's all the characters in reverse order.
