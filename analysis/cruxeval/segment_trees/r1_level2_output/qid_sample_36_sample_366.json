According to Python, stripping with an empty string (or None) removes whitespace. But note: the documentation says that if the argument is None, it removes whitespace. However, here we are passing an empty string.\n\n    Let's check the behavior of rstrip with an empty string in Python:\n        In Python, the rstrip method with an empty string returns the original string because there are no characters to remove. The empty string does not match any trailing characters.\n\n    Therefore, f1('ha', '') returns 'ha'.\n\nNow, we have to compute f2('ha'):\n    Step 1: tmp = string.lower() -> 'ha'.lower() is 'ha'\n    Then, we iterate over each char in string.lower() which is 'ha' (so first 'h', then 'a'):\n        First iteration: char = 'h'\n            Check if 'h' is in tmp (which is 'ha') -> yes.\n            Then we do: tmp = tmp.replace(char, '', 1) -> replace the first occurrence of 'h' in 'ha' with empty string -> becomes 'a'\n        Second iteration: char = 'a'\n            Check if 'a' is in tmp (which is now 'a') -> yes.\n            Then tmp = tmp.replace('a', '', 1) -> becomes empty string.\n\n    Therefore, f2('ha') returns an empty string.\n\nSo the output should be an empty string: ''\n\nBut note: the problem says to enclose the output in single quotes if it is a string. Since the output is an empty string, we should represent it as two single quotes: ''\n\nHowever, let's double-check the behavior of f2:\n\n    We start with tmp = 'ha'\n    Then for the first char 'h': remove first 'h' -> becomes 'a'\n    Then for the next char 'a': remove first 'a' from 'a' -> becomes ''\n\nSo the answer is an empty string.\n\nTherefore, the assert statement should be completed with: ''\n\nBut note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement with the output\". However, the instruction also says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\nSo we are to output only: ''\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" So we output two single quotes to represent the empty string.\n\nHowever, note that the function f2 returns a string (empty string) so we represent it as ''.\n\nBut let me check the exact test case again: \n    f1('ha', '') returns 'ha'\n    f2('ha') returns ''\n\nSo the final output is ''.\n\nBut note: the assert statement in the problem is incomplete:\n    assert f2(f1('ha', '')) == \n\nWe are to complete it by providing the output.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information\"\n\nSo we output: ''"
