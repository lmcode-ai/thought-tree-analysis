    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each function does.\n\nf1(s, from_c, to_c):\n  This function creates a translation table that maps each character in `from_c` to the corresponding character in `to_c`.\n  Then it applies this translation to the string `s` and returns the result.\n\n  Note: The `str.maketrans` and `translate` methods are used. The `from_c` and `to_c` must be of the same length.\n\nf2(text):\n  This function initializes an empty string `result`.\n  It then iterates over the string `text` from the last character to the first (i.e., in reverse order).\n  For each character, if it is an alphabet (determined by `c.isalpha()`), it appends that character to `result`.\n  Finally, it returns `result`.\n\nNow, we are to compute: \n  assert f2(f1('aphid', 'i', '?')) == ?\n\nSo, we first compute f1('aphid', 'i', '?'):\n\n  s = 'aphid'\n  from_c = 'i'\n  to_c = '?'\n\n  The translation table will map 'i' to '?'. All other characters remain the same.\n\n  So, in 'aphid':\n      a -> a\n      p -> p\n      h -> h\n      i -> ?\n      d -> d\n\n  Therefore, f1 returns 'aph?d'\n\nNext, we compute f2('aph?d'):\n\n  We traverse the string from the end to the beginning:\n\n      Start at index 4: character 'd' -> is alpha? yes -> result becomes 'd'\n      index 3: character '?' -> not an alphabet -> skip\n      index 2: character 'h' -> is alpha? yes -> result becomes 'dh'\n      index 1: character 'p' -> is alpha? yes -> result becomes 'dhp'\n      index 0: character 'a' -> is alpha? yes -> result becomes 'dhpa'\n\n  Therefore, f2 returns 'dhpa'\n\nBut note: the function f2 is building the string by appending as it goes backwards. So the result is the reverse of the original string but only including the alphabetic characters. However, in the string 'aph?d', the non-alphabetic character is skipped. So we get the reverse of the string without the non-alphabetic character? Actually, we are traversing backwards and appending each alphabetic character. So the result is the reverse of the sequence of alphabetic characters in the original string? \n\nWait, the original string is 'aph?d'. The alphabetic characters in order are: 'a','p','h','d'. But we are traversing backwards: we start at the end and go to the beginning. So we get the alphabetic characters in reverse order of their appearance? That would be: 'd','h','p','a'. So the string becomes 'dhpa'.\n\nTherefore, the output of f2(f1('aphid','i','?')) is 'dhpa'.\n\nBut note: the function f2 does not reverse the entire string of alphabetic characters. It collects the alphabetic characters from the last to the first. So the result is the reverse of the original string without the non-alphabetic characters? Actually, the original string is 'aph?d'. The non-alphabetic character is skipped. The original order of alphabetic characters is: \n  index0: 'a', index1: 'p', index2: 'h', index4: 'd'\nWhen we traverse backwards, we take index4: 'd', then index2: 'h', then index1: 'p', then index0: 'a'. So the result is 'dhpa'.\n\nThus, the assert statement should be:\n\n  assert f2(f1('aphid', 'i', '?')) == 'dhpa'\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement\". So we just need to output the string 'dhpa'.\n\nHowever, let me double-check:\n\n  Step 1: f1('aphid', 'i', '?') \n      replaces 'i' in 'aphid' with '?', so we get 'aph?d'\n\n  Step 2: f2('aph?d')\n      We traverse backwards:\n          i=4: 'd' -> alpha -> result = 'd'\n          i=3: '?' -> not alpha -> skip\n          i=2: 'h' -> alpha -> result = 'd'+'h' -> 'dh'\n          i=1: 'p' -> alpha -> result = 'dh'+'p' -> 'dhp'\n          i=0: 'a' -> alpha -> result = 'dhp'+'a' -> 'dhpa'\n\n  So the result is 'dhpa'\n\nTherefore, the output is 'dhpa'"
