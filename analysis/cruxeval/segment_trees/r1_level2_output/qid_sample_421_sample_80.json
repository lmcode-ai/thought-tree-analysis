However, in this case, the prefix we are passing is `str[:n]`, which is exactly the first n characters. So if the string has at least n characters, then `str` does start with `str[:n]`. Therefore, `str.removeprefix(str[:n])` will return the substring starting from index n to the end.\n\nSo, equivalently, we can write:\n   if len(str) < n: return str\n   else: return str[n:]\n\nNow, let's look at f2:\n  def f2(s):\n      return ''.join(reversed(s.rstrip()))\n\nThis function:\n  1. First, it applies `s.rstrip()`: which removes trailing whitespace from the string.\n  2. Then, it reverses the string (using `reversed(s.rstrip())` which returns an iterator over the reversed string).\n  3. Then, it joins the characters to form a string.\n\nSo, f2 returns the reversed string of the input string after removing any trailing whitespace.\n\nNow, the test case is: \n   assert f2(f1(\"try.\", 5)) == ?\n\nWe need to compute f1(\"try.\", 5) first.\n\nThe string \"try.\" has length 4, which is less than 5. Therefore, f1(\"try.\", 5) returns the entire string \"try.\".\n\nThen, we pass \"try.\" to f2.\n\nIn f2:\n   s = \"try.\"\n   s.rstrip() -> \"try.\" (there are no trailing spaces, so it remains the same)\n   reversed(\"try.\") -> an iterator that yields: '.', 'y', 'r', 't'\n   ''.join(...) -> \".yrt\"\n\nSo the result is \".yrt\".\n\nTherefore, the output of f2(f1(\"try.\", 5)) is \".yrt\".\n\nWe are to write the assert statement with the output. However, note the instruction: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case.\"\n\nBut then it says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\nSo we are to output only the string that the expression evaluates to, and we are to enclose it in single quotes.\n\nThus, the answer is: '.yrt'\n\nBut note: the test case string is \"try.\" which has a dot at the end. After reversing, the dot becomes the first character.\n\nLet me write the steps again:\n\nf1(\"try.\", 5) -> because len(\"try.\") is 4 (which is <5) -> returns \"try.\"\n\nf2(\"try.\") -> \n   s.rstrip() -> \"try.\" (no change)\n   reversed -> ['.','y','r','t'] -> joined to \".yrt\"\n\nSo the output is \".yrt\"\n\nTherefore, we write: '.yrt'"
