(all lowercase until \"RexEx\")\n      R -> uppercase -> captured\n      e -> lowercase\n      x -> lowercase\n      E -> uppercase -> captured\n      x -> lowercase\n      ... rest are lowercase.\n\n   So we have S, R, E -> indeed.\n\n   Now, the insertion:\n      First: S -> [S] (insert at 0)\n      Then: R -> insert at index (1//2)=0 -> [R, S]\n      Then: E -> insert at index (2//2)=1 -> [R, E, S] -> so \"RES\"\n\n   Then f2: \n        st = \"RES\", which does not start with '~'\n        so return st.rjust(10, 'n') -> which is 10 characters: 7 times 'n' and then \"RES\"\n\n   So the string is \"nnnnnnnRES\" (exactly 10 characters: 7 n's and then RES)\n\n   But note: the rjust method adds the padding to the left. So:\n\n        len('RES') = 3 -> we need 7 padding at the left -> 7 times 'n' -> then \"RES\"\n\n   Therefore, the result is 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n However, let me count: \n        n repeated 7 times: 'nnnnnnn' and then 'RES' -> total 10.\n\n   But note: the string \"RES\" is 3 characters, so 7+3=10.\n\n   So the final answer is 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n But wait, the example in the problem says: \n        st.rjust(10, 'n') \n\n   Example: \n        \"RES\".rjust(10, 'n') -> returns a string of length 10 with \"RES\" at the end and filled with 'n' at the beginning.\n\n   So we are confident.\n\n However, note that the function f2 might be recursive if the string starts with '~'. But our string \"RES\" does not start with '~', so we don't enter recursion.\n\n Therefore, the output of the entire expression is 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n But wait, let me check the exact specification of rjust:\n\n   str.rjust(width, fillchar) returns the string right-justified in a string of length width. \n\n   So: \n        'RES'.rjust(10, 'n') -> 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n   However, note that the example in the function f2: \n        if st[0]=='~', then it does st.rjust(10, 's') and then calls f2 again. But we don't have that.\n\n   So the answer is 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"assert f2(f1('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.')) == \"\n\n   We are to complete the assert statement with the output.\n\n   So we output: 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n However, let me check the string again: the input string is \"String matching is a big part of RexEx library.\"\n\n   There is one more uppercase? The word \"RexEx\" has two: R and E? But note the second E is uppercase? \n        The string: \"RexEx\" -> \n            R: uppercase -> we have\n            e: lowercase\n            x: lowercase\n            E: uppercase -> we have\n            x: lowercase\n\n   So we have three: S, R, E.\n\n   But what about the period at the end? It's not uppercase.\n\n   So the list is built as:\n        Start: []\n        S -> [S]\n        R -> insert at 0: [R, S]\n        E -> insert at 1: [R, E, S]\n\n   So the string is \"RES\".\n\n   Then f2: \n        st = \"RES\" -> doesn't start with '~' -> returns \"RES\".rjust(10, 'n') -> 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n   However, note that the rjust method: \n        The exact output should be: \n            'n' * (10 - len(\"RES\")) + \"RES\" = 'n'*7 + \"RES\" = \"nnnnnnnRES\"\n\n   But wait, let me count the n's: 7 n's and then RES -> total 10.\n\n   So the string is: \n        positions: 0 to 9: \n          0: 'n'\n          1: 'n'\n          2: 'n'\n          3: 'n'\n          4: 'n'\n          5: 'n'\n          6: 'n'\n          7: 'R'\n          8: 'E'\n          9: 'S'\n\n   That's 10 characters.\n\n   Therefore, the output is 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information\", and \"enclose in single quotes\".\n\n   So we output: 'nnnnnnnRES'\n\n However, I notice that the function f1 might have an off-by-one? Let me simulate the insertion again:\n\n   Step 1: new_text = [] -> insert 'S' at index 0 -> [S]\n   Step 2: new_text = [S] -> length=1 -> insert at index 1//2 = 0 -> insert 'R' at 0 -> [R, S]\n   Step 3: new_text = [R,S] -> length=2 -> insert at index 2//2=1 -> insert 'E' at index 1 -> [R, E, S]\n\n   That's correct.\n\n   Alternatively, if we had more letters, say next uppercase is 'X' (if there was one), then:\n        new_text becomes [R,E,S] -> length=3 -> insert at index 3//2=1 (integer division) -> so at index 1 -> [R, X, E, S]\n\n   But we don't have more.\n\n   So the result is indeed 'RES'.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is 'nnnnnnnRES'"
