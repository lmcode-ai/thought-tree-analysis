    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n We are to compute: f2(f1(\"ewriyat emf rwto segya\", \"tey\", \"dgo\"))\n\n First, let's understand what f1 does:\n   f1 takes three arguments: text, char1, char2.\n   It creates two lists: t1a and t2a.\n   For each index i in the range of the length of char1, it appends the i-th character of char1 to t1a and the i-th character of char2 to t2a.\n   Then, it creates a translation table (t1) by zipping t1a and t2a into a dictionary (so each character in t1a is mapped to the corresponding character in t2a).\n   Finally, it returns the translation of the text using that table.\n\n Now, let's compute f1(\"ewriyat emf rwto segya\", \"tey\", \"dgo\"):\n   char1 = \"tey\", char2 = \"dgo\"\n   t1a = ['t', 'e', 'y']\n   t2a = ['d', 'g', 'o']\n\n   The translation dictionary will be:\n        t -> d\n        e -> g\n        y -> o\n\n   Now, translate the text: \"ewriyat emf rwto segya\"\n        e -> g\n        t -> d\n        y -> o\n        Other characters remain the same.\n\n   So, let's break down the string:\n        \"ewriyat\" becomes: \n            e -> g: so first character becomes 'g'\n            then 'w' -> unchanged\n            'r' -> unchanged\n            'i' -> unchanged\n            'y' -> becomes 'o'\n            'a' -> unchanged\n            't' -> becomes 'd'\n            So \"ewriyat\" becomes \"gwrioad\"? But note: the string is \"ewriyat\", so:\n                e -> g: so the first letter becomes g -> \"g\"\n                then the rest: w, r, i, y, a, t -> \n                when we get to 'y': becomes 'o'\n                and the last 't': becomes 'd'\n            So: \"g\" + \"w\" + \"r\" + \"i\" + \"o\" + \"a\" + \"d\" -> \"gwrioad\"\n\n        \"emf\": \n            e -> g, so \"g\" + \"m\" + \"f\" -> \"gmf\"\n\n        \"rwto\":\n            r -> unchanged, w -> unchanged, t -> d, o -> unchanged? (note: o is not in the mapping, so remains)\n            so \"rwt\" becomes \"rwd\", then add 'o' -> \"rwdo\"\n\n        \"segya\":\n            s -> unchanged, e -> g, g -> unchanged, y -> o, a -> unchanged\n            so: s -> 's', e->'g', then 'g'->'g', y->'o', a->'a' -> \"sggoa\"? \n            But note: the string is \"segya\": \n                s -> s\n                e -> g -> becomes \"sg\"\n                then 'g' -> remains -> \"sgg\"\n                then 'y' -> 'o' -> \"sggo\"\n                then 'a' -> 'a' -> \"sggoa\"\n\n        Therefore, the entire string becomes: \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\"\n\n However, let's double-check the translation of \"ewriyat\":\n        Original: e w r i y a t\n        After:    g w r i o a d   -> \"gwrioad\"\n\n But note: the translation is done character by character. However, the mapping is applied to every occurrence.\n\n Now, we have: f1 returns \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\"\n\n Next, we pass this string to f2.\n\n What does f2 do?\n   f2(text) returns ' '.join(map(str.lstrip, text.split()))\n   Steps:\n     1. text.split() -> splits the string by whitespace into a list of words.\n     2. map(str.lstrip, ...) -> applies the lstrip function to each word. \n        Note: str.lstrip without arguments removes leading whitespace. But since the words are split without any leading/trailing spaces (because split() without arguments removes any whitespace and splits), then lstrip might not change the word? \n        However, note that lstrip without arguments removes leading whitespace. But if there's no leading whitespace, it returns the same string.\n\n        But wait: what if there are multiple spaces? The split() by default splits on any whitespace and removes any empty strings? Actually, no: split() without arguments splits on any whitespace and returns a list of non-empty words.\n\n        Example: \"  a  b  \".split() -> ['a','b']\n\n        So in our case, the string \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\" has no leading or trailing spaces and no consecutive spaces. So split() returns:\n            ['gwrioad', 'gmf', 'rwdo', 'sggoa']\n\n        Then, we apply lstrip to each. Since none of these words have leading spaces, they remain the same.\n\n     3. Then we join with a space: ' '.join(...) -> \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\"\n\n Therefore, the final result is \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\"\n\n However, let me reexamine the translation in f1:\n\n   The original string: \"ewriyat emf rwto segya\"\n\n   We are replacing:\n        t -> d\n        e -> g\n        y -> o\n\n   So:\n        \"ewriyat\": \n            e (at index0) -> g -> becomes 'g'\n            then the rest: w, r, i, y (which becomes o), a, t (which becomes d) -> so the last two: 'a' and then 't' becomes 'd'. \n            So the word becomes: g w r i o a d -> \"gwrioad\"\n\n        \"emf\": \n            e -> g -> so \"g\" then \"m\", then \"f\" -> \"gmf\"\n\n        \"rwto\":\n            r -> r, w -> w, t -> d, o -> o -> \"rwdo\"\n\n        \"segya\":\n            s -> s, e -> g, g -> g, y -> o, a -> a -> \"sggoa\"\n\n   So the string is \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\"\n\n But wait: the original string has a space between words, and we are replacing only the letters. The spaces are not being replaced because they are not in the mapping.\n\n Therefore, the output of f1 is \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\".\n\n Then f2 returns the same string because there are no leading spaces in any word.\n\n However, let's check the function f2 again: \n   It does: \n        text.split() -> splits the string by any whitespace, so we get the list: ['gwrioad', 'gmf', 'rwdo', 'sggoa']\n        Then map(str.lstrip, ...) -> for each word, we do lstrip. Since there's no leading space in any word, they remain the same.\n        Then we join by a space: so we get the same string.\n\n Therefore, the final result is \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\"\n\n But note: the problem says to complete the assert statement. However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we are to output: 'gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa'\n\n However, let me run through the translation again to be sure:\n\n   Original: \"ewriyat emf rwto segya\"\n\n   Replacements:\n      e -> g: so the first character of the first word becomes 'g'\n      In the first word: \n          e -> g\n          t (at the end) -> d\n          y (in the middle) -> o\n      So: \n          e -> g\n          w -> w\n          r -> r\n          i -> i\n          y -> o\n          a -> a\n          t -> d\n      So the first word: g w r i o a d -> \"gwrioad\"\n\n   Second word: \"emf\"\n        e -> g -> so \"g\", then m, then f -> \"gmf\"\n\n   Third word: \"rwto\"\n        r -> r\n        w -> w\n        t -> d\n        o -> o -> \"rwdo\"\n\n   Fourth word: \"segya\"\n        s -> s\n        e -> g\n        g -> g\n        y -> o\n        a -> a -> \"sggoa\"\n\n   So the string is \"gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa\"\n\n Therefore, the answer is 'gwrioad gmf rwdo sggoa'"
