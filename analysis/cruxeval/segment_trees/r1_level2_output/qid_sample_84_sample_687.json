Actually, let's count the entire string:\n\n        \"nwvday\" (6) + space (1) + \"mefday\" (6) + space (1) + \"ofmeday\" (6? Actually, \"ofmeday\" is 6? Let me write: \n        o-f-m-e-d-a-y -> 7? Actually, no: \n        \"ofmeday\": o, f, m, e, d, a, y -> 7 letters? But wait, the word is \"ofmeday\", which is 7 letters? \n        Actually, let's break down the entire string:\n\n        \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        nwvday: 6\n        space: 1\n        mefday: 6 -> total so far: 6+1+6 = 13\n        space: 1 -> 14\n        ofmeday: 7 (o,f,m,e,d,a,y) -> 13+7 = 20? Then space: 1 -> 21, then bdrylday: 8 (b,d,r,y,l,d,a,y) -> 29.\n\n        Actually, let me count the entire string without spaces: \n        nwvday -> 6\n        mefday -> 6\n        ofmeday -> 6? Wait, the word is \"ofme\" in the original? But we added 'day' so it becomes \"ofmeday\" -> 6? \n        Actually, \"ofme\" is 4, then we added \"day\" -> 4+3=7? \n\n        Let me write the string: \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        Actually, the original input was \"nwv mef ofme bdryl\", so after f1:\n          nwv -> nwvday (6)\n          mef -> mefday (6)\n          ofme -> ofmeday (6? because \"ofme\" is 4, then add \"day\" -> 7? because: o-f-m-e-day -> 7 letters? \n          bdryl -> bdrylday (6? \"bdryl\" is 5, then add \"day\" -> 8? because b-d-r-y-l-day -> 8? \n\n        So the string: \n          \"nwvday\" (6) + space (1) + \"mefday\" (6) + space (1) + \"ofmeday\" (7) + space (1) + \"bdrylday\" (8)\n\n        Total characters: 6+1+6+1+7+1+8 = 30.\n\n        But wait, let's count: \n          nwvday -> 6\n          space -> 1 (total 7)\n          mefday -> 6 (total 13)\n          space -> 1 (total 14)\n          ofmeday -> 7 (total 21)\n          space -> 1 (total 22)\n          bdrylday -> 8 (total 30)\n\n        So the string has 30 characters.\n\n        Therefore, t has 30 elements.\n\n        The middle index: len(t) // 2 = 30 // 2 = 15.\n\n        In zero-indexed list, we remove the element at index 15.\n\n        What is the 15th element? \n          We have to count from 0 to 14, then 15 is the next.\n\n        Let's break the string into indices:\n\n          \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n          Index 0: 'n'\n          Index 1: 'w'\n          Index 2: 'v'\n          Index 3: 'd'\n          Index 4: 'a'\n          Index 5: 'y'\n          Index 6: ' '\n          Index 7: 'm'\n          Index 8: 'e'\n          Index 9: 'f'\n          Index 10: 'd'\n          Index 11: 'a'\n          Index 12: 'y'\n          Index 13: ' '\n          Index 14: 'o'\n          Index 15: 'f'   <--- this is the one to pop.\n\n        So we remove the 'f' at index 15.\n\n        Now t becomes:\n          ['n','w','v','d','a','y',' ','m','e','f','d','a','y',' ','o','m','e','d','a','y',' ','b','d','r','y','l','d','a','y']\n\n        But wait, after popping, the list becomes 29 elements. Then we append the entire original text in lower case? \n        Actually, the original text for f2 is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\", which is already in lower case? \n        But the function does: t.append(text.lower()) -> but text is the same as the input to f2, which is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\". \n        Since it's already lower, we append the same string.\n\n        So we append: \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\" as a single string element? \n\n        But note: t is a list of characters. Then we do:\n          t.append(text.lower())   -> appends a string, so now t becomes a list of 29 characters plus one string element at the end.\n\n        Then we do: \n          return ':'.join([c for c in t])\n\n        Now, the list t has:\n          - 29 individual characters (each is a string of length 1) and then one long string at the end: \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        So when we do [c for c in t], we are iterating over the list. The first 29 elements are single characters, and the last element is a string of 30 characters? \n        But note: the list t now has 30 elements? Actually, after popping we had 29, then we appended one element (a string) so now the list has 30 elements? \n        But the last element is a string of 30 characters? Actually, the string we are appending is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\", which is 30 characters? \n\n        However, when we iterate over the list t, the last element is a string of 30 characters, so in the list comprehension [c for c in t], \n        for the last element (which is a string) we will iterate over each character of that string? \n\n        Actually, no. The list t has:\n          [ ... , \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"]   -> the last element is a string, not a character.\n\n        So when we do [c for c in t], we are iterating over the list t. The first 29 elements are single characters, and the last element is a string. \n        Then the list comprehension will have:\n          - 29 elements that are single characters (each from the popped list) and then the last element is the entire string? \n\n        But wait, the list comprehension [c for c in t] is just the same as the list t? Because we are taking each element in t and putting it as c. \n        However, the elements in t are: \n          - the first 29 are single-character strings, and the last element is a 30-character string.\n\n        So the resulting list will have 30 elements: 29 single characters and one string of 30 characters.\n\n        Then we join them with colon. \n\n        Therefore, the output will be:\n          [char0, char1, ... , char28, \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"] \n          -> char0:char1: ... :char28:\"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me reexamine the code:\n\n          t = list(text)   -> creates a list of each character of the string.\n          t.pop(...)        -> removes one character, so now t is a list of len(text)-1 characters.\n          t.append(text.lower()) -> appends the entire string as one element.\n\n          Then we do: ':'.join([c for c in t])\n\n          The [c for c in t] is just the list t. So we are joining the list t with colons.\n\n        Example: \n          t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'hello'] \n          then ':'.join(t) -> \"a:b:c:hello\"\n\n        So in our case, we have 29 single-character elements and then one long string.\n\n        Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with 29 characters (each separated by colon) and then a colon and then the entire string.\n\n        How many colons? 29 elements (the first 29) will have 28 colons between them, then one colon before the last element.\n\n        So total colons: 29 (because 29 elements in the list? Actually, the list has 30 elements: 29 from the popped list and one appended string? \n        Actually, after popping, we had 29 characters (so 29 elements) and then we appended one element (the string) so the list has 30 elements.\n\n        Therefore, we will have 29 colons.\n\n        Now, let's write the first 29 characters (without the popped 'f'):\n\n          Original string: \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\" -> 30 characters.\n\n          Without the 15th character (which was at index 15, the 'f' in \"ofmeday\" part? Actually, we broke it down earlier:\n\n          We had the list of characters (with spaces) for the string \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\":\n\n          Index: 0: 'n'\n          1: 'w'\n          2: 'v'\n          3: 'd'\n          4: 'a'\n          5: 'y'\n          6: ' '\n          7: 'm'\n          8: 'e'\n          9: 'f'\n          10: 'd'\n          11: 'a'\n          12: 'y'\n          13: ' '\n          14: 'o'\n          15: 'f'   -> removed\n          16: 'm'   -> becomes index 15 after removal? \n          17: 'e'\n          18: 'd'\n          19: 'a'\n          20: 'y'\n          21: ' '\n          22: 'b'\n          23: 'd'\n          24: 'r'\n          25: 'y'\n          26: 'l'\n          27: 'd'\n          28: 'a'\n          29: 'y'\n\n          After popping index 15, the list becomes:\n\n          indices 0 to 14: same\n          then from original index 16 to 29 become the new indices 15 to 28.\n\n          So the first 29 characters (the ones that are single characters) are:\n\n          [0] 'n'\n          [1] 'w'\n          [2] 'v'\n          [3] 'd'\n          [4] 'a'\n          [5] 'y'\n          [6] ' '\n          [7] 'm'\n          [8] 'e'\n          [9] 'f'   -> note: this is the 'f' from \"mefday\", which is still there? \n          [10] 'd'\n          [11] 'a'\n          [12] 'y'\n          [13] ' '\n          [14] 'o'\n          [15] 'm'   -> originally at index 16 (the 'm' in \"ofmeday\")\n          [16] 'e'\n          [17] 'd'\n          [18] 'a'\n          [19] 'y'\n          [20] ' '\n          [21] 'b'\n          [22] 'd'\n          [23] 'r'\n          [24] 'y'\n          [25] 'l'\n          [26] 'd'\n          [27] 'a'\n          [28] 'y'\n\n          Then the last element is the string: \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        So the entire list for the join is:\n\n          ['n','w','v','d','a','y',' ','m','e','f','d','a','y',' ','o','m','e','d','a','y',' ','b','d','r','y','l','d','a','y', \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"]\n\n        Now, we join with colon:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        But note: the last element is the entire string without any splitting.\n\n        However, let me write it without the spaces? Actually, the spaces are included as elements.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write the string without the popped 'f' and then the entire string at the end.\n\n        But note: the entire string we appended is exactly the same as the original input to f2, which is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\".\n\n        So the output is:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        However, let me check the indices again: the last character in the popped list is the last 'y' of \"bdrylday\", which is at index 28 in the popped list? \n        Then we append the entire string.\n\n        But wait, the original string had 30 characters, and we removed one, so the popped list has 29. Then we append the entire 30-character string as one element.\n\n        Therefore, the final string has: \n          29 (from the popped list) * (each character and a colon) but note the last element (the appended string) does not get a colon after the last character? \n          Actually, the join puts colon between every two elements.\n\n        So the structure is: \n          element0 + ':' + element1 + ... + ':' + element28 + ':' + element29\n\n        And element29 is the string \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\".\n\n        So the output string is:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        But note: the last colon is between the last character 'y' (which is the last character of the original without the popped one) and the entire string.\n\n        So the output is a string that ends with \"y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        Now, let me write the entire string without the popped 'f':\n\n          The original string without the 'f' at the 15th position (which was in the word \"ofmeday\") becomes:\n\n          \"nwvday mefday omeday bdrylday\"\n\n          But wait, we are not reconstructing the string until the join? We are just taking the list of characters without the one at index15.\n\n          Actually, the list we have for the first part is:\n\n          ['n','w','v','d','a','y',' ','m','e','f','d','a','y',' ','o','m','e','d','a','y',' ','b','d','r','y','l','d','a','y']\n\n          If we join these without colons, we get: \"nwvday mefday omeday bdrylday\"\n\n          But in the output we are joining with colons, so we get:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y\"\n\n          and then we add a colon and the entire string.\n\n        Therefore, the final output is:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        But note: the entire string we appended is the original input to f2, which is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\", so it has the 'f' that we popped? \n        Actually, the appended string is the original string (with the 'f') because we did text.lower() on the original input to f2.\n\n        So the appended string is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\", which includes the 'f' that we removed from the list.\n\n        Therefore, the output string is as above.\n\n        However, let me check the exact positions:\n\n          The first part (the popped list) is the string without the 'f' in the third word? So the third word becomes \"omeday\" (without the 'f')? \n          But the appended string has the original with the 'f', so the third word is \"ofmeday\".\n\n        So the output is:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        Now, we must write this without any extra spaces? Actually, the spaces are present as elements (the space character is there).\n\n        But note: the colon is the separator.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer is the string:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        However, let me double-check the count of the first part: 29 elements -> 29-1 = 28 colons in the first part? \n        Actually, the entire list for the join has 30 elements (the 29 single characters and the one string). So we have 29 colons? \n\n        The join of a list of n elements has n-1 colons? Actually, no: \n          [a, b, c] -> \"a:b:c\" -> 2 colons for 3 elements.\n\n        So for 30 elements, we have 29 colons.\n\n        The above string has 29 colons? Let me count:\n\n          The first 29 elements (the single characters) are 29 elements. Then the last element is the string. \n          So the colons are between each consecutive pair: between element0 and element1, element1 and element2, ... element28 and element29.\n\n          That's 29 colons.\n\n        How many colons in the string I wrote? \n\n          I wrote: \n            \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n          Let me break:\n\n            n:w -> 1\n            w:v -> 2\n            v:d -> 3\n            d:a -> 4\n            a:y -> 5\n            y:  -> 6   (space)\n            :m -> 7\n            m:e -> 8\n            e:f -> 9\n            f:d -> 10\n            d:a -> 11\n            a:y -> 12\n            y:  -> 13 (space)\n            :o -> 14\n            o:m -> 15\n            m:e -> 16\n            e:d -> 17\n            d:a -> 18\n            a:y -> 19\n            y:  -> 20 (space)\n            :b -> 21\n            b:d -> 22\n            d:r -> 23\n            r:y -> 24\n            y:l -> 25\n            l:d -> 26\n            d:a -> 27\n            a:y -> 28\n            y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday -> 29\n\n          So 29 colons.\n\n        Therefore, the string is as above.\n\n        However, note that the space characters are included and are represented as ' '.\n\n        So the final output is:\n\n          'n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday'\n\n        But wait, the last part: after the colon following the last 'y' (which is the last character of \"bdrylday\" without the popped 'f') we have the entire string without any colon separation.\n\n        This is the expected output.\n\n        However, let me run a small simulation to be sure.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write the code and run it? But we are not allowed to run, so we reason.\n\n        But note: the problem says the code may contain errors. However, we are to base on the given code.\n\n        Let me reexamine the function f2:\n\n          def f2(text):\n            t = list(text)   # splits the string into a list of single characters\n            t.pop(len(t) // 2)   # removes the middle element\n            t.append(text.lower())   # appends the entire string (in lower) as one element at the end of the list\n            return ':'.join([c for c in t])\n\n        This is exactly as we did.\n\n        Therefore, the output of f2(f1(...)) is the string we built.\n\n        So we write:\n\n          'n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday'\n\n        But note: the original string for f2 is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\", which is 30 characters. \n        We removed the 15th character (0-indexed index 15) which was the 'f' in \"ofmeday\". Then we appended the entire original string.\n\n        So the output is as above.\n\n        However, let me write the first part without colons to see if it matches the string without the 'f':\n\n          Without colons: \n            n w v d a y   m e f d a y   o m e d a y   b d r y l d a y\n\n          But that is: \"nwvday mefday omeday bdrylday\"\n\n          And then we have the entire original string: \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        So the output is:\n\n          \"n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\"\n\n        Therefore, we return this string.\n\n        But note: the problem says to enclose the string in single quotes.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n          'n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday'\n\n        However, let me check the spaces: in the first part, we have a space at index6, index13, index20? \n        And in the appended string, we have spaces as well.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the function f1 returns a string with spaces, and f2 takes that string and splits into characters, so the space characters are preserved.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above.\n\n        However, I notice that in the first part, after the space at index6, we have a colon and then 'm'. So it becomes \":m\", which is correct.\n\n        So the final answer is:\n\n          'n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday'\n\n        But wait, the original string for f2 is \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\", which has the word \"ofmeday\" (with an 'f'). \n        However, in the first part (the list without the popped element) we have the word \"omeday\" (without the 'f') for the third word? \n        But in the first part we broke the string into characters and removed the 'f' that was at the 15th index, which was the 'f' in \"ofmeday\". \n        So the first part has \"omeday\" for the third word? \n\n        But note: the first part is represented as a list of characters, and when we join with colons we don't form words. \n\n        So we are not forming the words without the 'f'. We are just having the characters without the 'f' and with colons.\n\n        Therefore, the output is as above.\n\n        We'll output that.\n\n        However, let me write the exact string without any mistake:\n\n          The first 29 characters (with the popped 'f' removed) in the list are:\n\n          indices 0 to 14: \n            'n','w','v','d','a','y',' ','m','e','f','d','a','y',' ','o'\n\n          then indices 15 to 28 (which were originally 16 to 29):\n            'm','e','d','a','y',' ','b','d','r','y','l','d','a','y'\n\n          So the list is:\n\n          ['n','w','v','d','a','y',' ','m','e','f','d','a','y',' ','o','m','e','d','a','y',' ','b','d','r','y','l','d','a','y']\n\n          Then we append the string \"nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday\".\n\n          Now, when we join with colon:\n\n            'n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday'\n\n        This is the string.\n\n        Therefore, we return:\n\n          'n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday'\n\n        But note: the space after the first 'y' (which is the space between \"nwvday\" and \"mefday\") is represented as a space character, and we have a colon on both sides? \n\n        Actually, the colon is only between elements. The space is an element by itself.\n\n        So the sequence is:\n\n          ... 'y', ' ', 'm' ...\n\n          becomes: ... 'y: :m' ...\n\n        So it's \"y: :m\", meaning two colons and a space in the middle? \n\n        Actually, it's: \n          element5: 'y'\n          element6: ' '\n          element7: 'm'\n\n          so the string becomes: ... \"y: :m\" ...\n\n        So the space is surrounded by colons? \n\n        Therefore, the output is as described.\n\n        We'll output that string.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\", and \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n        So the final answer is:\n\n          'n:w:v:d:a:y: :m:e:f:d:a:y: :o:m:e:d:a:y: :b:d:r:y:l:d:a:y:nwvday mefday ofmeday bdrylday'\n\n        But note: the function f1 might have an error? The problem says \"may contain errors\", but we are to base on the given code.\n\n        We followed the code.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above string.\n\n        However, let me check the function f1 again: \n\n          It splits the text, then for each word, if the word ends with 'day', it adds 'y', else adds 'day'. \n\n          The input words: \n            'nwv' -> doesn't end with 'day' -> becomes 'nwvday'\n            'mef' -> becomes 'mefday'\n            'ofme' -> becomes 'ofmeday'\n            'bdryl' -> becomes 'bdrylday'\n\n          So that is correct.\n\n        And f2: we did as above.\n\n        So we are confident.\n\n        Final answer."
