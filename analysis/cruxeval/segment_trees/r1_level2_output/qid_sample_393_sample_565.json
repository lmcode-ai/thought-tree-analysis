So the string becomes: \n        text2 = '' + 'a---c---s' + '---' -> 'a---c---s---'\n   Then we return text2[:-3] -> which removes the last three characters: the three hyphens at the end -> so we get 'a---c---s'\n\n So the string is indeed 'a---c---s'.\n\n Now, in f2: \n   We are looking for each vowel in 'aeiou' in the string 'a---c---s'. \n   Only 'a' is found at index 0. The others are not found.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum index among [0, -1, -1, -1, -1] is 0.\n\n Hence, the output is 0.\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\". We are to output the value that should be after the ==.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n And if the output is a string, enclose in single quotes. But here the output is an integer (0). So we just output 0.\n\n Therefore, the answer is 0."
