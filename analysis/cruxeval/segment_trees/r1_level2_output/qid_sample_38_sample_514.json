So: \"hello - world\" -> split -> ['hello', '-', 'world'] Then for each word:\n            For 'hello': \n                replace('-hello', ' ') -> in the string \"hello - world\", we look for '-hello': not found (because the string is \"hello - world\", the first word is \"hello\", then a space, then a hyphen, then a space, then \"world\")\n                replace('hello-', ' ') -> replace \"hello-\" with a space? The string has \"hello\" then space then hyphen -> so \"hello\" is not followed by a hyphen? It's followed by space. So no. For '-': \n                replace('--', ' ') -> not found? because the string has a single hyphen.\n                replace('--', ' ') -> same. For 'world':\n                replace('-world', ' ') -> in the string, we have \" - world\", so the substring \" world\" (with a space) is not '-world'. But note: the hyphen is separated by space? so we have space, hyphen, space, then world. So the substring before \"world\" is space, not hyphen? replace('world-', ' ') -> no. Then strip: the string remains \"hello - world\" But if we had \"hello- world\", then split -> ['hello-', 'world'] \n            For 'hello-': \n                replace('-hello-', ' ') -> not found (because the string starts with \"hello-\", not with a hyphen then \"hello-\")\n                replace('hello--', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"hello- world\", so after \"hello-\" is a space, not a hyphen) For 'world': \n                replace('-world', ' ') -> not found (because the string has \" world\", which is space then world, not hyphen then world)\n                replace('world-', ' ') -> not found. Then strip: no leading/trailing hyphens -> same. How about: \"hello-world\" (without space) -> one word -> no replacement.\n\n        How about: \"-hello\" -> split -> ['-hello']? Then we do:\n                replace('--hello', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"-hello\", so we are looking for two hyphens then \"hello\")\n                replace('-hello-', ' ') -> not found (because the string ends with 'o', not with a hyphen) Then strip: strip('-') would remove the leading hyphen? \n                strip('-') removes leading and trailing hyphens. So \"-hello\".strip('-') -> \"hello\"\n\n        So in this case, it becomes \"hello\". Similarly, \"hello-\" -> split -> ['hello-'] -> \n            replace('-hello-', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"hello-\", which doesn't start with a hyphen)\n            replace('hello--', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"hello-\", so we are looking for \"hello--\", but we have only one hyphen)\n            then strip: \"hello-\".strip('-') -> \"hello\" And if we have both: \"-hello-\" -> \n            split -> ['-hello-'] -> \n            replace('--hello-', ' ') -> not found? because the string is \"-hello-\", which is not \"--hello-\"\n            replace('-hello--', ' ') -> not found? because the string is \"-hello-\", not \"-hello--\"\n            then strip: \"-hello-\".strip('-') ->",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n We are to compute: f2(f1('1oE-err bzz-bmm'))\n\n First, let's compute f1('1oE-err bzz-bmm'):\n   f1(string) returns string.title().replace(' ', '')\n   '1oE-err bzz-bmm'.title() -> capitalizes the first letter of each word (words are separated by spaces or non-alphanumeric? Actually, title() capitalizes the first letter of each word and the rest to lower, but note that the string has hyphens and digits).\n\n   Let's break down:\n     Original: '1oE-err bzz-bmm'\n     After title(): \n        - The first word: \"1oE\" becomes \"1Oe\" (because the first character is a digit, then the next two are letters: the 'o' becomes lowercase and 'E' becomes lowercase? Actually, the title() method capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes the rest lowercase. But note: the word starts with a digit, so the next character is considered the start of a new word? Actually, the specification says: \"Words start with alphanumeric characters. The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters. This definition works in many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired result.\"\n\n     However, let's test in a Python shell (if we could) but we have to reason:\n\n        '1oE-err bzz-bmm'.title() \n        -> The string is split by non-alphanumeric? Actually, the title() method considers words as contiguous sequences of letters. So:\n          - The first part: \"1oE\" -> the first letter (by the definition of letter) is 'o' (since '1' is not a letter) so it becomes 'O', and then the rest of the letters become lowercase? But note: the first character of the word (if it's a letter) is capitalized and the rest are lowercased. However, the word boundaries are at non-letters? Actually, the documentation says: \"The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters.\"\n\n        So the string is broken into words (groups of consecutive letters) and each word is capitalized (first letter uppercase, rest lowercase). Non-letters are left as they are and break the words.\n\n        Therefore:\n          '1oE-err bzz-bmm' \n          Words: \n            - \"oE\" (because the '1' is not a letter, so it's a separator? Actually, the word boundaries are non-letters. So the first word is \"oE\", then a non-letter '-', then \"err\", then space (non-letter), then \"bzz\", then '-', then \"bmm\".\n\n          So:\n            \"oE\" -> \"Oe\"\n            \"err\" -> \"Err\" -> becomes \"Err\" (but note: the first letter is capitalized and the rest lower? Actually, the entire word becomes: first letter uppercase, the rest lowercase -> so \"err\" becomes \"Err\" -> but wait, the first letter is 'e' -> becomes 'E', then 'rr' becomes 'rr'? Actually, yes: 'e' -> 'E', and then 'rr' remains as is? But the method makes the rest lowercase? So \"eRR\" would become \"Err\". But here \"err\" is all lowercase, so becomes \"Err\".\n\n          However, note the starting digit: the '1' is not a letter, so it remains and then the next word \"oE\" becomes \"Oe\". So the string becomes:\n            '1' (unchanged) + 'Oe' (the word) + '-' (unchanged) + 'Err' (the next word) + ' ' (unchanged) + 'Bzz' + '-' + 'Bmm'\n\n          Therefore: '1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm'\n\n        But wait, let me check with a quick example in mind: \n          \"hello world\".title() -> \"Hello World\"\n          \"they're friends\".title() -> \"They'Re Friends\"  (because the apostrophe is a non-letter, so it breaks the word and the next letter is capitalized)\n\n        So for \"1oE-err bzz-bmm\":\n          - The first character '1' is not a letter -> remains.\n          - Then we have \"oE\": becomes \"Oe\"\n          - Then a hyphen: remains.\n          - Then \"err\": becomes \"Err\"\n          - Then a space: remains.\n          - Then \"bzz\": becomes \"Bzz\"\n          - Then a hyphen: remains.\n          - Then \"bmm\": becomes \"Bmm\"\n\n        So the result of title() is \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\"\n\n     Then, we do replace(' ', ''): \n        This removes all spaces. So we get: \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\" -> wait, note that there's a space between \"Err\" and \"Bzz\", so removing the space: \n          \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\" -> but wait, the original title() result was \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\", so removing the space: \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n        However, note: the string after title() is \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\", so removing the space: \n          becomes \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n        But wait, that doesn't look right. Let me write it step by step:\n          Original: '1oE-err bzz-bmm'\n          After title: '1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm'\n          After removing spaces: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n        So f1 returns '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.\n\n f2(text) does:\n   for item in text.split():\n        text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ').replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')\n   return text.strip('-')\n\n Let's break down f2:\n\n   Step 1: text.split() -> splits the string by whitespace. But note: the string we have is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'. There are no spaces in this string. So split() returns a list with one element: ['1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'].\n\n   Then we iterate over each item in that list (only one item: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'):\n\n        First replacement: \n          replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ') -> replace('-1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm', ' ') \n          But note: the string is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'. There is no substring that is exactly '-1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm' in the string? The string starts with '1Oe', not with a hyphen. So this replacement does nothing.\n\n        Second replacement:\n          replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ') -> replace('1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm-', ' ')\n          The string is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'. There is no trailing hyphen at the end? The string ends with 'Bmm'. So this replacement also does nothing.\n\n   Then we return text.strip('-') -> the string is still '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'. \n        strip('-') removes leading and trailing hyphens. There are none. So the result is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'.\n\n But wait, let me double-check the function f2:\n\n   The function splits the text by whitespace. Since there is no whitespace in the input, we get one element.\n\n   Then for each word (which is the entire string) we try to replace:\n        '-word' with a space (but the entire string is the word, so we are looking for a hyphen followed by the entire string? which would be at the beginning? but the string doesn't start with a hyphen) -> no match.\n        'word-' with a space (the entire string followed by a hyphen) -> but the string doesn't end with a hyphen? so no match.\n\n   Then we strip hyphens from the ends -> no hyphens at the ends.\n\n   So the output of f2 is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, note: the test case and the functions might be intended to do something else? But we are to compute mechanically.\n\n But wait, let me reexamine the function f2: it does a loop over the split result and in each iteration it modifies the entire text. However, the split result is only one element. But what if the string had multiple words? Then we would do the replacements for each word.\n\n However, in this case, the string has no space so split returns one word.\n\n Therefore, the final result is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n But wait, the original test case: '1oE-err bzz-bmm' -> becomes '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, the expected output of the entire expression is that? But the assert statement is incomplete. We are to complete the assert statement with the output.\n\n But note: the problem says: \"complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case.\"\n\n And we are to return the output without any extra information.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n So we return: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n But wait, let me check the function f2 again: what if the split had produced multiple words? In our case it didn't. But what if we had a space? Then we would have multiple items. However, the input to f2 is the output of f1 which has no space.\n\n However, let me consider: what if the string had multiple words? Then the loop would run for each word and do the replacements. But note: the replacements are done in sequence and might interfere.\n\n But in this specific input, we have only one word.\n\n But wait, the input to f2 is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'. There is a hyphen in the middle? Actually, there are two hyphens? Let me write it:\n\n   The string: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n   How many hyphens? \n        After the '1Oe' there is a hyphen, then 'ErrBzz' (which is without a hyphen until the next hyphen) and then a hyphen and then 'Bmm'.\n\n   But note: the function f2 is iterating over the words from split. Since there are no spaces, we have one word.\n\n   Therefore, the replacements are:\n\n        replace('-1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm', ' ') -> not found\n        replace('1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm-', ' ') -> not found\n\n   So the string remains.\n\n   Then we do strip('-') -> which removes leading and trailing hyphens. The string does not have leading or trailing hyphens? \n        It starts with '1' and ends with 'm'. So no change.\n\n   Therefore, the result is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, let me run a simulation with a simpler example to see what f2 does.\n\n   Example: \n        f2(\"hello-world\") \n        split -> ['hello-world'] (one word)\n        then we do:\n            replace('-hello-world', ' ') -> not found in \"hello-world\"\n            replace('hello-world-', ' ') -> not found\n        then strip '-' -> no leading or trailing -> \"hello-world\"\n\n   Example with two words:\n        f2(\"hello world\") \n        split -> ['hello', 'world']\n        for the first word 'hello':\n            replace('-hello', ' ') -> in \"hello world\": no substring '-hello'? because the string starts with 'h' -> no\n            replace('hello-', ' ') -> in \"hello world\": the substring \"hello \" (with a space) is not \"hello-\" (with a hyphen) -> no\n        for the second word 'world':\n            replace('-world', ' ') -> in \"hello world\": the substring \" world\" (with a space) is not '-world' -> no\n            replace('world-', ' ') -> no\n\n        then strip '-' -> \"hello world\"\n\n   But what if we have hyphens? \n        Example: f2(\"hello-world\") as above -> remains \"hello-world\"\n\n   Now, what if we have: f2(\"hello- world\") \n        split -> ['hello-', 'world']   (because split by space: the first part is \"hello-\", the second \"world\")\n        for 'hello-':\n            replace('-hello-', ' ') -> becomes: replace the substring that is exactly '-hello-' with a space. \n                The string is \"hello- world\": does it contain '-hello-'? \n                The substring from index0: 'h' -> not starting with '-'. \n                So no.\n            replace('hello--', ' ') -> no (because we have \"hello- \" -> note the space, not a hyphen after the word)\n        for 'world':\n            replace('-world', ' ') -> in the string \"hello- world\", we have \" world\" (with a space) but we are looking for '-world'. The substring after the hyphen is \" world\", which is not '-world' (because it's space after the hyphen). So no.\n            replace('world-', ' ') -> no\n\n        Then strip: \"hello- world\" -> no leading or trailing hyphens -> same.\n\n   How about: f2(\"hello-world how-are-you\")\n        split -> ['hello-world', 'how-are-you']   (two words)\n        for the first word 'hello-world':\n            replace('-hello-world', ' ') -> not found (because the string starts with 'h')\n            replace('hello-world-', ' ') -> not found (because after 'hello-world' there is a space, not a hyphen)\n        for the second word 'how-are-you':\n            replace('-how-are-you', ' ') -> not found (because the second word is at the beginning of a space? actually, the string is \"hello-world how-are-you\", so the second word starts with 'h', not '-')\n            replace('how-are-you-', ' ') -> not found (because the string ends with 'u')\n        then strip -> same string.\n\n   But note: the function f2 might be intended to remove hyphens that are attached to a word? But the way it is written, it only removes if the entire word is attached with a hyphen on one side? \n\n   However, in our case, the input to f2 is without spaces, so we have one word.\n\n   Therefore, the result is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n But wait, the original test case: \n        f1('1oE-err bzz-bmm') -> '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n        then f2('1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm') -> '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n So the assert statement should be:\n\n        assert f2(f1('1oE-err bzz-bmm')) == '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we output: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n But wait, let me check the function f2 again: what if the string had a hyphen at the beginning or end? Then strip would remove it. But in our case, it doesn't.\n\n However, note: the function f2 does a loop and replaces occurrences. But the replacements are done in the entire string for each word. And the replacements are for the exact string of a hyphen followed by the entire word, or the entire word followed by a hyphen.\n\n   Example: if we had the string \"-hello\" and the word is \"hello\", then:\n        replace('-hello', ' ') -> would replace the entire string with a space? \n        then we would have a space, and then when we do the next replacement for the same word? but note the string is now a space.\n\n   But in our case, the word is the entire string and the string does not start with a hyphen, so no.\n\n   Therefore, the output is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, I notice that the original string had two hyphens and a space. The f1 function removed the space and title-cased the words. Then f2 did nothing.\n\n But let me write the string again: \n        Original: '1oE-err bzz-bmm'\n        After f1: \n            title: \n                '1oE-err' -> \n                    The words: \n                        1oE: the first character is digit -> then the next two are letters: \"oE\" becomes \"Oe\", so we get \"1Oe\"\n                    then hyphen, then \"err\" becomes \"Err\"\n                then space, then \"bzz\" becomes \"Bzz\", then hyphen, then \"bmm\" becomes \"Bmm\"\n            So: \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\"\n            Then remove spaces: \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n        Now, in the string \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\", we have:\n            - at index3: '-' \n            - at index10: '-' (because: \n                index0: '1'\n                index1: 'O'\n                index2: 'e'\n                index3: '-'\n                index4: 'E'\n                index5: 'r'\n                index6: 'r'\n                index7: 'B'\n                index8: 'z'\n                index9: 'z'\n                index10: '-'\n                index11: 'B'\n                index12: 'm'\n                index13: 'm'\n\n        So the string has two hyphens.\n\n        The function f2 does not remove these hyphens because it only looks for hyphens that are attached to the entire word (which is the whole string) and that entire word is \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\", so it doesn't match.\n\n        Therefore, the output remains.\n\n But wait, what if the function f2 was intended to break the string by spaces and then remove hyphens that are attached to each word? But the code does:\n\n        for item in text.split():\n            text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ')\n            text = text.replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')\n\n        Then returns text.strip('-')\n\n        In our case, the split produces one word: ['1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'].\n\n        Then we try to replace the string that is exactly '-1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm' (which would require the string to start with a hyphen and then the entire word) and also the string that is exactly '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm-' (which would require the string to end with a hyphen). \n\n        Since the string does not start or end with a hyphen, no replacement.\n\n        Then we strip the hyphens at the ends -> none.\n\n        So the result is the same.\n\n Therefore, the output is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, I have a doubt: what if the function f2 was intended to remove hyphens that are attached to each word individually? But note that the word in the split list is the entire string. \n\n But what if we had multiple words? For example, if the string had a space, then we would split into multiple words and then we would remove hyphens that are attached to each word.\n\n Example: \n        text = \"hello-world\"\n        split -> ['hello', 'world']   (if we split by space, but there is no space -> so one word)\n\n        But if we had: \"hello - world\", then split would be ['hello', '-', 'world']? \n        Actually, split without arguments splits by any whitespace and consecutive whitespace are treated as one. And non-whitespace tokens are separated.\n\n        So: \"hello - world\" -> split -> ['hello', '-', 'world']\n\n        Then for each word:\n            For 'hello': \n                replace('-hello', ' ') -> in the string \"hello - world\", we look for '-hello': not found (because the string is \"hello - world\", the first word is \"hello\", then a space, then a hyphen, then a space, then \"world\")\n                replace('hello-', ' ') -> replace \"hello-\" with a space? \n                    The string has \"hello\" then space then hyphen -> so \"hello\" is not followed by a hyphen? It's followed by space. So no.\n\n            For '-': \n                replace('--', ' ') -> not found? because the string has a single hyphen.\n                replace('--', ' ') -> same.\n\n            For 'world':\n                replace('-world', ' ') -> in the string, we have \" - world\", so the substring \" world\" (with a space) is not '-world'. But note: the hyphen is separated by space? so we have space, hyphen, space, then world. So the substring before \"world\" is space, not hyphen? \n                replace('world-', ' ') -> no.\n\n        Then strip: the string remains \"hello - world\"\n\n        But if we had \"hello- world\", then split -> ['hello-', 'world'] \n            For 'hello-': \n                replace('-hello-', ' ') -> not found (because the string starts with \"hello-\", not with a hyphen then \"hello-\")\n                replace('hello--', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"hello- world\", so after \"hello-\" is a space, not a hyphen)\n            For 'world': \n                replace('-world', ' ') -> not found (because the string has \" world\", which is space then world, not hyphen then world)\n                replace('world-', ' ') -> not found.\n\n        Then strip: no leading/trailing hyphens -> same.\n\n        How about: \"hello-world\" (without space) -> one word -> no replacement.\n\n        How about: \"-hello\" -> split -> ['-hello']? \n            Then we do:\n                replace('--hello', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"-hello\", so we are looking for two hyphens then \"hello\")\n                replace('-hello-', ' ') -> not found (because the string ends with 'o', not with a hyphen)\n            Then strip: strip('-') would remove the leading hyphen? \n                strip('-') removes leading and trailing hyphens. \n                So \"-hello\".strip('-') -> \"hello\"\n\n        So in this case, it becomes \"hello\".\n\n        Similarly, \"hello-\" -> split -> ['hello-'] -> \n            replace('-hello-', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"hello-\", which doesn't start with a hyphen)\n            replace('hello--', ' ') -> not found (because the string is \"hello-\", so we are looking for \"hello--\", but we have only one hyphen)\n            then strip: \"hello-\".strip('-') -> \"hello\"\n\n        And if we have both: \"-hello-\" -> \n            split -> ['-hello-'] -> \n            replace('--hello-', ' ') -> not found? because the string is \"-hello-\", which is not \"--hello-\"\n            replace('-hello--', ' ') -> not found? because the string is \"-hello-\", not \"-hello--\"\n            then strip: \"-hello-\".strip('-') -> \"hello\"\n\n        So the function f2 only removes hyphens at the beginning and end of the entire string (via strip) and does not remove hyphens in the middle? unless they are attached to a word that is split by space? \n\n        But note: the split by space is important. In our case, the input to f2 has no space, so we have one word and then we strip the entire string.\n\n        Now, our string: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm' -> does not have a hyphen at the beginning or end? \n            It starts with '1' and ends with 'm'. So strip does nothing.\n\n        Therefore, the output is unchanged.\n\n        So the final answer is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n But wait, the original test case: \n        f1('1oE-err bzz-bmm') -> '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n        f2('1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm') -> '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n        So the output is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, I notice that the original string had a space and two hyphens. The f1 function removed the space and then f2 did nothing. \n\n But let me check the function f2 again: what if the split produced multiple words? In our case it didn't. But what if we had a space in the string? Then we would split and then the replacements might occur.\n\n But the output of f1 has no space.\n\n Therefore, the result is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n However, I see that the function f2 might be intended to remove hyphens that are attached to words that are separated by spaces? But in our case, the string has no space.\n\n So we output: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\n So we output the string.\n\n However, let me write the string: \n        '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n But wait, the original string after f1: \n        We had: \n          title: \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\" -> then remove spaces: \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n        So the string is \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n        And that is what we return.\n\n Therefore, the answer is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'"
