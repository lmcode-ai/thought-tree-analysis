    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n\nFirst, let's understand f1:\ndef f1(text, delim):\n    return text[:text[::-1].find(delim)][::-1]\n\nStep-by-step for f1:\n1. text[::-1] reverses the string.\n2. Then we find the first occurrence of `delim` in this reversed string. This gives the index (from the start of the reversed string) of the first occurrence of `delim` when looking from the end of the original string.\n3. We take a substring from the beginning of the reversed string up to (but not including) that index. This effectively removes the part from the last occurrence of `delim` to the end of the original string? Actually, note: we are working on the reversed string.\n4. Then we reverse that substring again to get the original order.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n- The function f1 returns the substring of `text` that comes after the last occurrence of `delim`. But let's test with an example.\n\nExample: \n  f1('abcde', 'c') \n  Step 1: reverse: 'edcba'\n  Step 2: find 'c' in 'edcba' -> index 2 (because 'c' is at index 2 in 'edcba')\n  Step 3: take substring [0:2] of 'edcba' -> 'ed'\n  Step 4: reverse 'ed' -> 'de'\n\nSo the result is 'de'. In the original string 'abcde', the last occurrence of 'c' is at index 2, and the part after it is 'de'. So the function returns the part of the string after the last occurrence of `delim`.\n\nBut note: what if the delimiter is not found? Then `find` returns -1. Then we take substring from 0 to -1 (which in Python is the entire string except the last character? Actually, no: in slicing, `text[: -1]` excludes the last character. But wait: the reversed string is being used. \n\nLet me check with the given test case: \n  f1('dsj osq wi w', ' ')\n\nStep 1: reverse the string: 'w iw qso jsd'\nStep 2: find the first space in the reversed string: \n  'w iw qso jsd' -> the first space is at index 1 (because the string starts with 'w', then space at index 1).\nStep 3: take substring from 0 to 1 (exclusive) of the reversed string: that's just the first character: 'w'\nStep 4: reverse that: 'w'\n\nSo f1 returns 'w'.\n\nNow, we have to compute f2(f1('dsj osq wi w', ' ')) = f2('w')\n\nNow, what does f2 do?\ndef f2(n):\n    for i in str(n):\n        if not i.isdigit():\n            n = -1\n            break\n    return n\n\nNote: the parameter is named `n`, but inside we convert `n` to a string and then iterate over each character. If any character is not a digit, we set `n` to -1 and break. Then we return `n`.\n\nBut note: the input to f2 is the string 'w'. \nWe convert the input `n` (which is 'w') to a string (which is still 'w'). Then we iterate over each character (only one: 'w'). Since 'w' is not a digit, we set `n` to -1 and break. Then return -1.\n\nTherefore, the output of f2(f1('dsj osq wi w', ' ')) is -1.\n\nBut note: the function f2 returns an integer -1, not a string.\n\nThe problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" Since the output is an integer, we do not enclose it in quotes.\n\nSo the answer is: -1\n\nHowever, let me double-check the function f1: \n  The test case: 'dsj osq wi w' with delimiter space.\n  The function f1 is supposed to return the substring after the last space? \n  The original string: 'dsj osq wi w'\n  The last space is between \"wi\" and \"w\". So the part after the last space is \"w\". That matches.\n\nThen f2('w') returns -1 because 'w' is not a digit.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is -1."
