    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f1 does:\n  f1(text, chars):\n    - If `chars` is non-empty, it strips the characters in `chars` from the right end of `text` (using rstrip).\n    - If `chars` is empty, it strips spaces from the right.\n    - If after stripping the string becomes empty, it returns '-'.\n    - Otherwise, it returns the stripped string.\n\nNow, f2(text):\n    - It checks if the entire string `text` is alphanumeric (which includes digits and letters) AND also every character in `text` is a digit.\n    - If both conditions are true, it returns 'integer'. Otherwise, it returns 'string'.\n\nWe are to compute:\n  f2(f1('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-'))\n\nStep 1: Compute f1 with arguments:\n  text = 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n  chars = '0123456789-'\n\nIn f1, since `chars` is non-empty (it's the string '0123456789-'), we do:\n  text = text.rstrip('0123456789-')\n\nWhat does rstrip do? It removes all the characters in the string `chars` from the right end until a character not in `chars` is encountered.\n\nLet's look at the string: \n  'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\nWe need to remove from the right any of the characters in '0123456789-' until we hit a character that is not in that set.\n\nBreaking down the end of the string:\n  ... ' 2.2'\n\nBut note: the set of characters to remove includes digits and the hyphen. However, note that the string ends with \"2.2\". \n\nLet's traverse from the right:\n  The last character is '2' -> which is in the set? Yes (because '2' is in '0123456789-'). Remove it.\n  Then we have: ... ' 2.' -> now the last character is '.' -> not in the set. So we stop.\n\nTherefore, after stripping, the string becomes:\n  'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'   ??? \n\nWait, let me check: \n  Original: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n  After removing the last '2': becomes ... '2.2' -> becomes ... '2.'? \n\nBut note: the rstrip doesn't just remove one occurrence; it removes as many as possible. So let's see:\n\n  The end of the string: \" 2.2\"\n  - The last character is '2' -> remove.\n  - Then the next is '.' -> stop.\n\nSo we remove only the last '2'. Therefore, the string becomes:\n  'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\nBut wait, there's a space and then a digit? Actually, let's look at the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, note that the string has a space, then 'XQuery', then space, then '2.2'. \n\nAfter stripping, we remove the trailing '2' (the last character). Then the next character is '.' which is not in the set. So the result is:\n  'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\nBut wait, what about the hyphen? The set includes hyphens. However, note that the stripping only happens at the very end. There is a hyphen in the middle, but we are only stripping from the right.\n\nNow, let's check: is there any hyphen at the end? The last part is \"2.2\", so no hyphen at the end. So we only remove the trailing digits and hyphens. Since the last character is a digit, we remove it. Then the next is a period, which we don't remove.\n\nSo the result of f1 is: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\nBut wait, what about the space? The set does not include space. So we don't remove spaces? Actually, the set is '0123456789-', so space is not included. Therefore, we stop at the period and the space remains.\n\nBut note: the original string ends with \"2.2\", and we remove the last '2'. So the string becomes:\n  'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\nBut let me write the entire string: \n  Original: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n  After removing the last '2': becomes 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.' \n\nBut wait, there's a space after the application and before the dash? Actually, the string is: \n  \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2\"\n\nSo after stripping, we have: \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\" \n\nNow, we pass this string to f2.\n\nf2 takes a string and checks:\n  1. Is the entire string alphanumeric? \n  2. And are all the characters digits?\n\nThe string we have: \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\" \n\nIs this string alphanumeric? \n  Alphanumeric means: only letters and digits (and no spaces or other characters). But note: \n    - It has spaces -> not alphanumeric.\n    - It has a period -> not alphanumeric.\n    - It has hyphens -> not alphanumeric.\n\nTherefore, the condition in f2 fails.\n\nSo f2 will return 'string'.\n\nBut wait, let's check the condition in f2:\n  if text.isalnum() and all(i.isdigit() for i in text)\n\nThe first condition: text.isalnum() returns False because the string contains non-alphanumeric characters (spaces, hyphens, period). Therefore, we skip the second condition and return 'string'.\n\nTherefore, the output of the entire expression is 'string'.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the stripping: \n  The original string: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n  We are stripping with chars = '0123456789-'\n\nWe remove from the right until we hit a character not in the set. The set is digits and hyphen.\n\nThe end of the string: \n  ... '2.2' -> \n    last char: '2' (remove) -> now string ends with '.'\n    next: '.' -> not in set -> stop.\n\nSo the string becomes: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\nBut note: there is a space after the hyphen? Actually, the string has: \n  \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2\"\n\nAfter removing the last '2', we have: \n  \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\nNow, is there any trailing hyphen? No. So we don't remove anything else.\n\nTherefore, the result of f1 is: \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\nNow, when we pass that to f2, we are checking:\n  text = \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\nThis string is not alphanumeric because:\n  - It has hyphens, spaces, and a period.\n\nSo f2 returns 'string'.\n\nBut wait, what about the condition: \n  all(i.isdigit() for i in text)\n\nWe don't even check that because the first condition (isalnum) is false.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 'string'.\n\nHowever, let me run through the code step by step to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that the condition in f2 is:\n  if text.isalnum() and all(i.isdigit() for i in text)\n\nThe `and` condition requires both to be true. The first condition is `text.isalnum()`, which for the string \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\" is False. So the entire condition is false, and we return 'string'.\n\nSo the output is 'string'.\n\nBut wait, what if the stripping removed more? Let me check the rstrip again.\n\nThe rstrip removes all occurrences of the characters in the set from the right until a character not in the set is found. So:\n\n  The string: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n  The set: '0123456789-'\n\nThe last character is '2' -> remove.\nNow the string ends with '.' -> stop.\n\nBut what about the period? It's not in the set, so we stop. So we only remove the last '2'. \n\nAlternatively, what if there was a hyphen at the end? There isn't. \n\nBut note: the set includes hyphens. So if there was a trailing hyphen, we would remove it. But in this string, the last character is a digit, then a period, then a space, etc. So we only remove the trailing digits and hyphens. \n\nTherefore, the result of f1 is indeed: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\nNow, let me check: is there a possibility that the stripping removes the period? No, because the period is not in the set.\n\nSo the answer should be 'string'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"the output when executing the code on the given test case\". We must be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, let me run the code in my head:\n\nf1:\n  text = 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n  chars = '0123456789-'\n  Since chars is non-empty, we do: text.rstrip('0123456789-')\n  This will remove from the right: \n      The last character is '2' -> remove.\n      Then the next is '.' -> stop.\n\n  So text becomes: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n  Then we check: is text empty? No, so return 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\nThen we call f2 with that string.\n\nf2:\n  text = 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n  Check: text.isalnum() -> \n        This returns False because the string has non-alphanumeric characters (like spaces, hyphens, and a period).\n  Therefore, we return 'string'.\n\nSo the final output is 'string'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'string'.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement. If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\nSo we output: 'string'\n\nBut wait, what if the stripping removed more? Let me consider: what if the rstrip also removes the period? It shouldn't because the period is not in the set.\n\nAlternatively, what if the set included the period? It doesn't.\n\nAnother possibility: the set includes the hyphen and digits, but note that the string has a hyphen in the middle. But rstrip only removes from the right. So the hyphens in the middle are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'string'."
