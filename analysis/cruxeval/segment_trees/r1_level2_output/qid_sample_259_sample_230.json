    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n We are to compute: f2(f1('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'))\n\n First, let's compute f1('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.')\n\n The function f1:\n   - It initializes an empty list `new_text`.\n   - It iterates over each character in the input string.\n   - If the character is uppercase, it inserts that character into `new_text` at the position `len(new_text) // 2`.\n   - If after the loop `new_text` is empty, it sets `new_text` to ['-'].\n   - Then returns the joined string of `new_text`.\n\n Let's extract the uppercase letters from the input string:\n   Input: 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'\n   Uppercase letters: \n        'S' (at the beginning of \"String\")\n        'R' (in \"RexEx\")\n        'E' (in \"RexEx\")\n        'l'? -> wait, note: 'l' in \"library\" is lowercase. Actually, let's check:\n\n        S -> uppercase -> add\n        t, r, i, n, g -> not\n        m, a, t, c, h, i, n, g -> not\n        i, s -> not\n        a -> not\n        b, i, g -> not\n        p, a, r, t -> not\n        o, f -> not\n        R -> uppercase -> add\n        e -> not\n        x -> not\n        E -> uppercase -> add\n        x -> not\n        l -> not (and the rest are lowercase)\n\n   So we have: 'S', 'R', 'E'\n\n   Now, we insert each uppercase character at the position len(new_text)//2.\n\n   Step by step for f1:\n     Start: new_text = []\n     For the first uppercase 'S': \n          position = len([]) // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0 -> insert at 0: ['S']\n\n     Then 'R': \n          current new_text = ['S'] -> len=1 -> position = 1//2 = 0 (integer division)\n          insert 'R' at index 0: becomes ['R', 'S']\n\n     Then 'E':\n          current new_text = ['R','S'] -> len=2 -> position = 2//2 = 1\n          insert 'E' at index 1: so we get ['R', 'E', 'S']\n\n   Therefore, f1 returns 'RES'\n\n   But wait, note that the input string has a period at the end and we didn't consider any other uppercase? \n   Also note: the word \"RexEx\" has two uppercase: R and E (the second E? Actually, the second E is uppercase? \n   Let me check: \"RexEx\" -> \n        R (uppercase), e (lower), x (lower), E (uppercase), x (lower).\n\n   So we have three: S, R, E.\n\n   Now, what about the period? It's not uppercase.\n\n   So f1 returns 'RES'\n\n   However, note that the function f1 does not have any else clause. It only appends when uppercase. So non-uppercase are ignored.\n\n   Now, we have to compute f2 on the result of f1, which is 'RES'\n\n   The function f2:\n        It initializes an empty string `result`.\n        It iterates over the input string from the last character to the first (backwards).\n        For each character, if it is alphabetic, it appends it to `result`.\n        Then returns `result`.\n\n   The input to f2 is 'RES'. All characters are alphabetic.\n\n   We traverse backwards: \n        Start with the last character: 'S' -> add to result: result becomes 'S'\n        Then 'E' -> add: result becomes 'SE'\n        Then 'R' -> add: result becomes 'SER'\n\n   So f2 returns 'SER'\n\n   But note: the function f2 is building the string by adding each alphabetic character in reverse order? \n        Actually, it starts from the last character and moves backwards, and appends each alphabetic character to `result`.\n        So the string is built in reverse order of the original? \n\n        Original: 'RES'\n          i starts at 2 (last index): character 'S' -> result = 'S'\n          i=1: 'E' -> result = 'S'+'E' -> 'SE'\n          i=0: 'R' -> result = 'SE'+'R' -> 'SER'\n\n   Therefore, the final result is 'SER'\n\n   However, let me double-check the input string: \n        'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'\n\n   We found the uppercase: \n        S (at index0), R (at index ... let me count: \n          \"String matching is a big part of \" -> \n          S is at index0, then the next uppercase is R: \n          The string: \n          \"String matching is a big part of RexEx library.\"\n          Let's count: \n          S(0), then after \"String\" (6 letters) and then space, then \"matching\" (8) -> total 6+1+8=15, then space, \"is\" (2) -> 15+1+2=18, then space, \"a\" (1) -> 18+1+1=20, space, \"big\" (3) -> 20+1+3=24, space, \"part\" (4) -> 24+1+4=29, space, \"of\" (2) -> 29+1+2=32, space, then \"RexEx\": \n          at index 33: 'R', then at 36: 'E' (because \"Rex\" -> R at 33, e at 34, x at 35, then E at 36, x at 37). \n\n        So we have S, R, E.\n\n   So the process in f1 is correct.\n\n   But note: the function f1 inserts at the middle. \n        First: insert S at index0 -> ['S']\n        Then R: insert at index0 -> ['R','S']\n        Then E: insert at index1 (because 2//2=1) -> ['R','E','S'] -> so the string is \"RES\"\n\n   Then f2: reverses the order? Actually, it traverses backwards and appends. So the backward of \"RES\" is \"SER\".\n\n   However, note that the function f2 does:\n        result = ''\n        i = len(text)-1 -> for \"RES\", len=3 -> i=2\n        while i>=0:\n            c = text[2] -> 'S' -> isalpha -> result = 'S'\n            i becomes 1 -> c = text[1] = 'E' -> result = 'S'+'E' -> 'SE'\n            i becomes 0 -> c = text[0] = 'R' -> result = 'SE'+'R' -> 'SER'\n\n   So the output is 'SER'\n\n   Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n        assert f2(f1('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.')) == 'SER'\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement with the output\", and we are to output only the string.\n\n   However, the instruction says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement. If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n   So we output: 'SER'\n\n   But wait, what if the function f1 had no uppercase? Then it returns '-'. Then f2 would process that. But in this case we have uppercase.\n\n   Let me check the function f1 again: \n        if len(new_text)==0: new_text = ['-']\n\n   We had three uppercase, so we skip that.\n\n   So the answer is 'SER'\n\n   However, let me run a simulation in my mind for f2 on the string \"RES\": \n        We are going backwards: \n          Start: result = ''\n          i=2: c = 'S' -> result='S'\n          i=1: c = 'E' -> result='SE'\n          i=0: c = 'R' -> result='SER'\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   But note: the function f2 is actually building the string by adding the letters in reverse order? \n        The original string is \"RES\", and we are reading backwards: \n          We read: 'S', then 'E', then 'R'. \n          And we are appending in that order: so the result is \"S\" + \"E\" + \"R\" = \"SER\".\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is 'SER'"
