But wait: the code appends the string representation of the integer ch, then a semicolon and a space, and then encodes that string to bytes. Example: for ch=97, we have the string \"97; \" and then encode to utf-8 -> that would be the bytes: b'97; '\n\n   So the entire result is:\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the last element also has a semicolon and space. But that's as per the code. But let's check the code again: res = []\n        for ch in text.encode('utf-8'):\n            if ch == 61: break\n            if ch == 0: pass   # does nothing, so we skip the append for 0?\n            res.append(f'{ch}; '.encode('utf-8')) return b''.join(res) So for each non-zero and non-61 byte, we append the string of the number plus '; ' as bytes. Therefore, the output is a byte string: \n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the string we are building is a string of numbers and then we are encoding that string. The numbers are in base 10. But wait: the example above has a space after the semicolon? Actually, the format is f'{ch}; ' -> that's without a space after the semicolon? Actually, it's with a space: the string is \"97; \" (with a space after the semicolon). So the bytes for the first element: \n        '97; ' -> in bytes: \n          '9' -> 57, '7' -> 55, ';' -> 59, ' ' -> 32. Therefore, the entire byte string is:\n\n        [57, 55, 59, 32,   # for \"97; \"\n         52, 53, 59, 32,   # for \"45; \"\n         52, 53, 59, 32,   # for \"45; \"\n         57, 57, 59, 32,   # for \"99; \"\n         57, 55, 59, 32,   # for \"97; \"\n         49, 48, 48, 59, 32,   # for \"100; \" -> note: 100 has three digits: '1','0','0'\n         49, 49, 49, 59, 32]   # for \"111; \" -> three digits: '1','1','1' But wait, that doesn't look right. Actually, the format is f'{ch}; ' and ch is an integer. So for 100, the string is \"100; \" which is 5 characters: '1','0','0',';',' '.",

So the first part: The string \"97; \" becomes the bytes: b'97; '\n\n   When we join, we get: \n        b'97; ' + b'45; ' + ... So the entire byte string is: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, that is not the same as the string \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \" encoded as a whole?

The code appends for every byte (except 0 and breaks on 61) the string of the number and then \"; \". So the entire string ends with a space. But note: the problem does not require the assert statement, only the output. So we write:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the numbers are in the order of the bytes in the string. The string is 'a--cado' -> bytes: [97, 45, 45, 99, 97, 100, 111]\n\n   So the output is:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But wait, the code appends for each byte. So we have 7 numbers. And each number is followed by \"; \". Therefore, the byte string is:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the last element also has a trailing semicolon and space. That is as per the code. But the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\"\n\n   So we output:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, let's test with a small example in our mind: For the byte 97: we get the string \"97; \" -> which is 4 bytes: '9','7',';',' '. So the entire byte string is:\n\n          '9','7',';',' ', '4','5',';',' ', ... So the representation is exactly as above. But note: the problem says \"when executing the code on the given test case\". We must be sure. Alternatively, we can run the code in our head:\n\n        f1('avacado', 'va', '-') returns 'a--cado'\n\n        Then f2('a--cado'):\n\n          text = 'a--cado'\n          text.encode('utf-8') -> b'a--cado' which is: \n              b'a' -> 97, b'-' -> 45 (twice), b'c'->99, b'a'->97, b'd'->100, b'o'->111 Then we iterate:\n\n            ch=97 -> append b'97; '\n            ch=45 -> append b'45; '\n            ch=45 -> append b'45; '\n            ch=99 -> append b'99; '\n            ch=97 -> append b'97; '\n            ch=100 -> append b'100; '\n            ch=111 -> append b'111; '\n\n          Then we join: \n              b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '   ??? But wait, the join does not put a space between the parts?",

But note: the representation in Python for a byte string that contains only ASCII printable characters is to show it as a string with the b prefix and the characters.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n We are to compute: f2(f1('avacado', 'va', '-'))\n\n First, let's compute f1('avacado', 'va', '-').\n\n In f1:\n   text = 'avacado'\n   old = 'va'\n   new = '-'\n\n Conditions:\n   len(old) = 2, which is not > 3 -> skip the first condition.\n   Check: old in text? 'va' is in 'avacado' -> True.\n   Also, check if ' ' is not in text: there's no space in 'avacado' -> True.\n   Therefore, we return text.replace(old, new*len(old)) \n        = replace 'va' with '-' * 2 = '--'\n\n   So, replace the first occurrence? Actually, the replace method in Python replaces all occurrences by default.\n\n   However, note the condition: we only do this if there's no space and the old string is present. So we do:\n        'avacado'.replace('va', '--') -> becomes: 'a--cado'\n\n   But wait, there is a second occurrence? Let's see: \n        'avacado' has two 'va's? \n        Actually, let's break it down: \n          a v a c a d o\n          The first 'va' is at index 1: 'av'\n          Then we have 'ac' and then 'ado'. There is no second 'va'. \n\n   So the result of f1 is 'a--cado'.\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.\n\n In f2:\n   We take the string 'a--cado' and encode it to utf-8.\n\n   Then we iterate over each byte (ch) in the encoded bytes.\n\n   The string 'a--cado' in UTF-8 (which is the same as ASCII for these characters) is:\n        a: 97\n        -: 45 (and there are two of them)\n        c: 99\n        a: 97\n        d: 100\n        o: 111\n\n   So the bytes are: [97, 45, 45, 99, 97, 100, 111]\n\n   Now, we go through each byte:\n        ch = 97: \n            97 != 61 and 97 != 0 -> we append b'97; ' (note: the format is f'{ch}; ' and then encode to utf-8)\n        ch = 45: \n            same, append b'45; '\n        ch = 45: append b'45; '\n        ch = 99: append b'99; '\n        ch = 97: append b'97; '\n        ch = 100: append b'100; '\n        ch = 111: append b'111; '\n\n   Then we join all these byte strings.\n\n   But note: the condition for break is when ch==61 (which is '=') and we don't have that. Also, when ch==0 we do nothing (pass) and skip appending.\n\n   So the result should be:\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the code appends for every byte (except 0) and then breaks only on 61. Since we don't have 61, we process all.\n\n   But wait: the code appends the string representation of the integer ch, then a semicolon and a space, and then encodes that string to bytes.\n\n   Example: for ch=97, we have the string \"97; \" and then encode to utf-8 -> that would be the bytes: b'97; '\n\n   So the entire result is:\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the last element also has a semicolon and space. But that's as per the code.\n\n   But let's check the code again: \n        res = []\n        for ch in text.encode('utf-8'):\n            if ch == 61: break\n            if ch == 0: pass   # does nothing, so we skip the append for 0?\n            res.append(f'{ch}; '.encode('utf-8'))\n        return b''.join(res)\n\n   So for each non-zero and non-61 byte, we append the string of the number plus '; ' as bytes.\n\n   Therefore, the output is a byte string: \n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the string we are building is a string of numbers and then we are encoding that string. The numbers are in base 10.\n\n   But wait: the example above has a space after the semicolon? Actually, the format is f'{ch}; ' -> that's without a space after the semicolon? \n        Actually, it's with a space: the string is \"97; \" (with a space after the semicolon).\n\n   So the bytes for the first element: \n        '97; ' -> in bytes: \n          '9' -> 57, '7' -> 55, ';' -> 59, ' ' -> 32.\n\n   Therefore, the entire byte string is:\n\n        [57, 55, 59, 32,   # for \"97; \"\n         52, 53, 59, 32,   # for \"45; \"\n         52, 53, 59, 32,   # for \"45; \"\n         57, 57, 59, 32,   # for \"99; \"\n         57, 55, 59, 32,   # for \"97; \"\n         49, 48, 48, 59, 32,   # for \"100; \" -> note: 100 has three digits: '1','0','0'\n         49, 49, 49, 59, 32]   # for \"111; \" -> three digits: '1','1','1'\n\n   But wait, that doesn't look right. Actually, the format is f'{ch}; ' and ch is an integer. So for 100, the string is \"100; \" which is 5 characters: '1','0','0',';',' '.\n\n   However, the problem is that the function f2 returns a byte string that is the concatenation of these byte strings.\n\n   But note: the expected output in the assert is a byte string. We are to write the representation of that byte string.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the output as the string of the numbers separated by semicolon and space, but then encoded.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"return the output of the function\". So we must output the byte string as it would be.\n\n   But the assert statement is incomplete. We are to complete it with the output.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n   And if the output is a string, enclose in single quotes. But note: the output of f2 is a byte string. How should we represent it?\n\n   The problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" But a byte string is not a string (in the sense of a Python str). \n\n   We are to output the representation that would be used in the assert. Since the assert is in Python, we can represent the byte string as b'...'.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify. But note the example: the test case passes a string to f1 and then to f2, and f2 returns bytes.\n\n   The assert is comparing to a byte string. So we should write the byte string.\n\n   But the problem says: \"enclose it in single quotes\" for a string. For a byte string, we use the b prefix.\n\n   So we write: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, that is not the actual byte string. The actual byte string is the encoding of the string \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \".\n\n   But wait, the code does:\n        for each byte, it appends the byte string of the string representation of the integer followed by \"; \".\n\n   So the entire string we are building is:\n\n        \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \"\n\n   Then we encode that? No, we are encoding each part individually? Actually, we are building a list of byte strings:\n\n        [ b'97; ', b'45; ', b'45; ', b'99; ', b'97; ', b'100; ', b'111; ' ]\n\n   Then we join them with b'' (empty byte string) -> so we get:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But note: the spaces are included in each part? Actually, each part is the number string and then the string \"; \" and then encoded.\n\n   So the first part: \n        The string \"97; \" becomes the bytes: b'97; '\n\n   When we join, we get: \n        b'97; ' + b'45; ' + ... \n\n   So the entire byte string is: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, that is not the same as the string \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \" encoded as a whole? \n        Actually, it is the same because each part is a byte string of the corresponding number and the fixed string \"; \".\n\n   But note: the numbers are represented in base 10 and as the string of digits.\n\n   Therefore, the output of f2 is: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, let's check the last part: the last byte is a space? and the last character is a space? \n\n   The code appends for every byte (except 0 and breaks on 61) the string of the number and then \"; \". So the entire string ends with a space.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the assert statement, only the output. So we write:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the numbers are in the order of the bytes in the string.\n\n   The string is 'a--cado' -> bytes: [97, 45, 45, 99, 97, 100, 111]\n\n   So the output is:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But wait, the code appends for each byte. So we have 7 numbers. And each number is followed by \"; \".\n\n   Therefore, the byte string is:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the last element also has a trailing semicolon and space. That is as per the code.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\"\n\n   So we output:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, let's test with a small example in our mind:\n\n        For the byte 97: we get the string \"97; \" -> which is 4 bytes: '9','7',';',' '.\n\n        So the entire byte string is:\n\n          '9','7',';',' ', '4','5',';',' ', ... \n\n   So the representation is exactly as above.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"when executing the code on the given test case\". We must be sure.\n\n   Alternatively, we can run the code in our head:\n\n        f1('avacado', 'va', '-') returns 'a--cado'\n\n        Then f2('a--cado'):\n\n          text = 'a--cado'\n          text.encode('utf-8') -> b'a--cado' which is: \n              b'a' -> 97, b'-' -> 45 (twice), b'c'->99, b'a'->97, b'd'->100, b'o'->111\n\n          Then we iterate:\n\n            ch=97 -> append b'97; '\n            ch=45 -> append b'45; '\n            ch=45 -> append b'45; '\n            ch=99 -> append b'99; '\n            ch=97 -> append b'97; '\n            ch=100 -> append b'100; '\n            ch=111 -> append b'111; '\n\n          Then we join: \n              b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '   ??? \n\n          But wait, the join does not put a space between the parts? It just concatenates the byte strings.\n\n          So the result is:\n\n              b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n          But note: the byte string for the first part is b'97; ' -> which is the four bytes: 57, 55, 59, 32.\n\n          Then the next is b'45; ' -> 52, 53, 59, 32.\n\n          So the entire byte string is:\n\n              b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n          However, when we look at it as a string of bytes, it is the same as the string \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \" encoded in ASCII.\n\n          But note: the representation in Python for a byte string that contains only ASCII printable characters is to show it as a string with the b prefix and the characters.\n\n          So we can write it as: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, there is a mistake: the string we built does not have spaces between the numbers? Actually, each part is a string of the number and then a semicolon and a space. \n\n   But when we concatenate, we get:\n\n        \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \"\n\n   But note: the parts are:\n\n        \"97; \" + \"45; \" + ... -> \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \"\n\n   So the entire string has a space after every semicolon, and then the next number starts.\n\n   Therefore, the byte string is exactly: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But wait, the last character is a space? And the last token is \"111; \" -> so yes.\n\n   However, the problem does not require the trailing space? But that's what the code does.\n\n   So the answer is: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\" \n\n   We are to output the result of the function as is.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, let me double-check the function f1: \n        The input string is 'avacado'. We are replacing 'va' with '--'. \n        The string 'avacado' has the substring \"ava\" at the beginning? \n            Actually, the first two characters are 'a' and 'v', so the substring starting at index0: 'a' -> not 'va'\n            at index1: we have 'v' and the next is 'a' -> that's \"va\". So we replace that.\n\n        So the string becomes: \n            first character 'a' remains, then replace \"va\" with \"--\", then the rest is \"cado\" -> so \"a--cado\".\n\n        That is correct.\n\n   And then f2 on \"a--cado\" produces the byte string as above.\n\n   But note: the function f2 has a condition for ch==0: we do nothing and then skip the append. We don't have any 0.\n\n   And we break on 61, which we don't have.\n\n   So the output is as above.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the function f2 appends for every byte, but the string \"100\" and \"111\" are three-digit numbers. \n        The byte string for \"100; \" is the six bytes: \n            '1' -> 49, '0'->48, '0'->48, ';'->59, ' '->32.\n\n        Similarly, \"111; \" is 49,49,49,59,32.\n\n   But when we write the representation, we write the string of the byte string. And for the byte 48, it is represented as the character '0'? \n        Actually, in the byte string, if the byte is in the printable ASCII range, it is represented as the corresponding character.\n\n   So the byte string for the entire thing is:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But note: the byte 97 is represented as the character 'a'? No, wait: the byte 97 is the ASCII code for 'a', but in the string we are building we are not putting the character 'a' but the string \"97\". \n\n   So the byte string is the encoding of the string \"97; 45; ...\", which is a string of digits, semicolons and spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the byte string is:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But wait, the actual bytes are:\n\n        [49, 57, 59, 32, 52, 53, 59, 32, 52, 53, 59, 32, 57, 57, 59, 32, 49, 48, 48, 59, 32, 49, 49, 49, 59, 32]\n\n   However, when Python prints a byte string, it will try to represent each byte as an ASCII character if it is printable. \n\n   The bytes:\n\n        49 -> '1'\n        57 -> '9'\n        59 -> ';'\n        32 -> ' '\n        52 -> '4'\n        53 -> '5'\n        ... \n\n   So the entire byte string, when printed, will look like the string: \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \".\n\n   Therefore, the representation is: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But note: the trailing space at the end is included.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\". \n\n   Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But wait, the function f2 might have a bug: it appends a semicolon and space for every byte, so the entire string ends with a space. \n   But that's what the code does.\n\n   We are to output the result of the function.\n\n   So we write exactly that.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"complete the assert statement\". But we are only to output the value that should be on the right-hand side.\n\n   The assert is:\n\n        assert f2(f1('avacado', 'va', '-')) == <our answer>\n\n   We are to output the <our answer> part.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" \n        Our output is a byte string, so we use the b prefix and then the string in single quotes.\n\n   So we write: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, let me check the length: \n        The original string has 7 bytes, and for each we output 4 or 5 bytes? \n        Actually, the length of the string representation for each byte:\n          For a one-digit number: e.g., 45 -> \"45; \" -> 4 bytes.\n          For a two-digit number: e.g., 97 -> \"97; \" -> 4 bytes.\n          For a three-digit number: 100 -> \"100; \" -> 5 bytes.\n\n        We have:\n          97: 4 bytes\n          45: 4 bytes\n          45: 4 bytes\n          99: 4 bytes\n          97: 4 bytes\n          100: 5 bytes\n          111: 5 bytes\n\n        Total: 4*5 + 5*2 = 20+10 = 30 bytes.\n\n        But the representation we are writing is the string of 30 characters? and then we put it in a byte string.\n\n        However, we are not counting the bytes of the representation, we are writing the representation of the byte string.\n\n   So we are confident.\n\n   But note: the function f2 might have a bug in the condition for ch==0: it does nothing and then skips the append. But we don't have 0.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, let me write the exact string without the spaces? Actually, the string we built has spaces. \n\n   The code: f'{ch}; ' -> that is the number, then a semicolon, then a space.\n\n   So the string for the first byte is \"97; \" (with a space at the end). Then the next is \"45; \" (with a space at the end). \n\n   So the entire string is: \"97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; \"\n\n   And note: the last character is a space.\n\n   Therefore, the byte string is: b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   We output that.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\". So we output exactly:\n\n        b'97; 45; 45; 99; 97; 100; 111; '\n\n   However, note that the example in the problem does not have a trailing space? But we are following the code.\n\n   We are done."
