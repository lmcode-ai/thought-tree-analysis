So the concatenated string of letters is:\n\n        \"new\" + \"medium\" + \"performing\" + \"application\" + \"XQuery\"\n\n        = \"newmediumperformingapplicationXQuery\"\n\n   Now, reverse that: \n\n        Start from the end: \n          'y' \n          then 'r' -> \"yr\"\n          then 'e' -> \"yre\"\n          then 'u' -> \"yreu\"\n          then 'Q' -> \"yreuQ\"\n          then 'X' -> \"yreuQX\"\n          then the rest of \"application\" in reverse: \n               \"application\" reversed is 'noitacilppa'\n          then \"performing\" reversed is 'gnimrofrep'\n          then \"medium\" reversed is 'muidem'\n          then \"new\" reversed is 'wen'\n\n        So: \"yreuQX\" + \"noitacilppa\" + \"gnimrofrep\" + \"muidem\" + \"wen\"\n\n        = \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n   But note: in the original string, the word \"performing\" is after \"medium\", and then \"application\" after that. So in the reversed string of the entire letter sequence, we have:\n\n        ... (XQuery reversed) ... then (application reversed) ... then (performing reversed) ... then (medium reversed) ... then (new reversed) So the result is: \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n However, let me check the step-by-step we did earlier for the end part: \n\n        We had: ... after adding \"XQuery\" in reverse: \"yreuQX\", then we added the last part of \"application\": \n\n          We started at the end of the string and moved backwards.",

[43] = '2', [44] = '.', [45] = '2'? But we said the original string has 46 characters? Let me index the original:\n\n                s = 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n                indices 0 to 45.

'2.' -> so index44 becomes the last character: '.' and index43 is '2' Now, when we traverse:\n\n                i starts at 44 (last index of the new string, which is '.' -> skip)\n                then i=43: '2' -> skip\n                then i=42: space -> skip\n                then i=41: 'y' -> add. So the indices for the \"XQuery\" part: \n                'X' is at index 36, 'Q' at 37, 'u' at 38, 'e' at 39, 'r' at 40, 'y' at 41. Then after the space at index42, we have the '2' at 43 and '.' at 44. So we are good. Now, after the space at index42, we go to index41: 'y' -> then 40: 'r', 39: 'e', 38: 'u', 37: 'Q', 36: 'X'\n\n        Then index35: space -> skip. Then index34: '-' -> skip? Then index33: space -> skip? Then index32: 'n' (the last letter of \"application\") -> add -> now result = \"yreuQX\" + 'n' -> \"yreuQXn\"\n\n        Then index31: 'o' -> \"yreuQXno\"\n        index30: 'i' -> \"yreuQXnoi\"\n        index29: 't' -> \"yreuQXnoit\"\n        index28: 'a' -> \"yreuQXnoita\"\n        index27: 'c' -> \"yreuQXnoitac\"\n        index26: 'i' -> \"yreuQXnoitaci\"\n        index25: 'l' -> \"yreuQXnoitacil\"\n        index24: 'p' -> \"yreuQXnoitacilp\"\n        index23: 'p' -> \"yreuQXnoitacilpp\"\n        index22: 'a' -> \"yreuQXnoitacilppa\"\n\n        Then index21: '-' -> skip. Then index20: 'g' (the last letter of \"performing\") -> add -> \"yreuQXnoitacilppag\"\n        index19: 'n' -> ... We see the pattern. So the result is indeed: \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n Therefore, the final answer is the string: 'yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen'\n\n But note: the function f2 is defined to return the string of alphabetic characters in reverse order (from last to first).",

' - XQuery 2.' \n\n But note: the original string does not have a space at the very end? \n The original string: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' \n -> the last part is \"2.2\", so after removing the last '2', we have \"2.\" and that's at the end.\n\n However, let me check the entire string: \n   The string: \n      \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2\"\n\n After stripping the trailing '2', we get:\n      \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.\n\n But wait, the problem says: if the text becomes empty string, return '-'. \n Here, the text is not empty.\n\n So f1 returns: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n Now, we call f2 on this string.\n\n f2(text) does:\n   result = ''\n   i = len(text)-1 (so starting from the last character)\n   while i >= 0:\n        c = text[i]\n        if c.isalpha(): \n            result += c\n        i -= 1\n\n So it traverses the string from the last character to the first, and whenever it finds an alphabetic character, it appends it to `result`.\n\n Note: `result` is built by appending, so the order will be the reverse of the order of the original string (because we start from the end).\n\n But note: we are going from the last character to the first, and when we find an alpha, we add it to `result` (which is initially empty). \n So the first alpha we find (from the end) becomes the first character of `result`, the next becomes the second, etc.\n\n The string we are processing: \n   'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n Let's break it down:\n\n   We start at the last character: '.' -> not alpha -> skip.\n   Then the next: '2' -> not alpha -> skip.\n   Then the next: ' ' (space) -> not alpha -> skip.\n   Then: 'y' -> alpha -> add to result: result becomes 'y'\n   Then: 'r' -> add: 'yr'\n   Then: 'e' -> add: 'yre'\n   Then: 'u' -> add: 'yreu'\n   Then: 'Q' -> add: 'yreuQ'\n   Then: ' ' -> skip\n   Then: 'X' -> add: 'yreuQX'\n   Then: ' ' -> skip\n   Then: '-' -> skip\n   Then: 'n' -> add: 'yreuQXn'\n   Then: 'o' -> add: 'yreuQXno'\n   Then: 'i' -> add: 'yreuQXnnoi'\n   ... and so on until the beginning.\n\n But note: we are going backwards and building the string by appending. So the result will be the reverse of the sequence of alphabetic characters in the original string (from last to first).\n\n However, we are only taking the alphabetic characters and in reverse order (from last to first). \n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   We are collecting all the alphabetic characters in the string in reverse order (i.e., starting from the end and moving backwards).\n\n So the string: \n   'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n We want to extract only the letters and reverse the entire string? Actually, no: we are traversing backwards and appending each letter. \n This is equivalent to reversing the order of the letters in the string.\n\n Example: \n   Original string: \"abc def\"\n   We start at the end: \n        'f' -> append -> result='f'\n        'e' -> append -> result='fe'\n        'd' -> append -> result='fed'\n        then space -> skip\n        then 'c' -> append -> result='fedc'\n        then 'b' -> append -> result='fedcb'\n        then 'a' -> append -> result='fedcba'\n\n So the result is the reverse of the string of letters (without non-letters).\n\n But note: the original string has letters and non-letters. We are only taking the letters and then reversing the order of their occurrence.\n\n Now, let's do it step by step for our string:\n\n   String: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n   We break it into characters (from the end):\n\n   '.' -> skip\n   '2' -> skip\n   ' ' -> skip\n   'y' -> add -> 'y'\n   'r' -> add -> 'yr'\n   'e' -> add -> 'yre'\n   'u' -> add -> 'yreu'\n   'Q' -> add -> 'yreuQ'\n   ' ' -> skip\n   'X' -> add -> 'yreuQX'\n   ' ' -> skip\n   '-' -> skip\n   ... now we are in the word \"application\", but note the string is: \n        \"application\" without the trailing part? Actually, the string is:\n\n        \"new-medium-performing-application\"\n\n   Actually, the entire string after f1 is: \n        \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\n   So after the hyphen we have a space, then \"XQuery\", then space, then \"2.\".\n\n   Now, continuing from the hyphen (which we skip) and then we go to the part before:\n\n        ... 'n' (from 'application') -> add -> 'yreuQXn'\n        then 'o' -> 'yreuQXno'\n        then 'i' -> 'yreuQXnoi'\n        then 't' -> 'yreuQXnoit'\n        then 'a' -> 'yreuQXnoita'\n        then 'c' -> 'yreuQXnoitac'\n        then 'i' -> 'yreuQXnoitaci'\n        then 'l' -> 'yreuQXnoitacil'\n        then 'p' -> 'yreuQXnoitacilp'\n        then 'p' -> 'yreuQXnoitacilpp'\n        then 'a' -> 'yreuQXnoitacilppa'\n        then '-' -> skip\n        then 'm' (from 'performing') -> add -> 'yreuQXnoitacilppam'\n        ... and so on.\n\n   This is going to be very long. Instead, we can note that we are taking all the letters in the entire string and then reversing the order.\n\n   The entire string without non-alphabetic characters (but preserving the order of the letters) would be:\n\n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationXQuery\"\n\n   Then, because we traverse backwards, the result is the reverse of that string.\n\n   So we can form the string of letters: \n\n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationXQuery\"\n\n   and then reverse it: \n\n        reverse of \"newmediumperformingapplicationXQuery\" \n\n   = \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n   But wait, let me break the original string into letters:\n\n        \"new\" -> ['n','e','w']\n        then non-letter: '-' -> skip\n        \"medium\" -> ['m','e','d','i','u','m']\n        then non-letter: '-' -> skip\n        \"performing\" -> ['p','e','r','f','o','r','m','i','n','g']\n        then non-letter: '-' -> skip\n        \"application\" -> ['a','p','p','l','i','c','a','t','i','o','n']\n        then non-letter: space, then '-', then space -> skip\n        \"XQuery\" -> ['X','Q','u','e','r','y']\n        then non-letter: space, then \"2.\" -> skip.\n\n   So the concatenated string of letters is:\n\n        \"new\" + \"medium\" + \"performing\" + \"application\" + \"XQuery\"\n\n        = \"newmediumperformingapplicationXQuery\"\n\n   Now, reverse that: \n\n        Start from the end: \n          'y' \n          then 'r' -> \"yr\"\n          then 'e' -> \"yre\"\n          then 'u' -> \"yreu\"\n          then 'Q' -> \"yreuQ\"\n          then 'X' -> \"yreuQX\"\n          then the rest of \"application\" in reverse: \n               \"application\" reversed is 'noitacilppa'\n          then \"performing\" reversed is 'gnimrofrep'\n          then \"medium\" reversed is 'muidem'\n          then \"new\" reversed is 'wen'\n\n        So: \"yreuQX\" + \"noitacilppa\" + \"gnimrofrep\" + \"muidem\" + \"wen\"\n\n        = \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n   But note: in the original string, the word \"performing\" is after \"medium\", and then \"application\" after that. \n   So in the reversed string of the entire letter sequence, we have:\n\n        ... (XQuery reversed) ... then (application reversed) ... then (performing reversed) ... then (medium reversed) ... then (new reversed)\n\n   So the result is: \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n However, let me check the step-by-step we did earlier for the end part: \n\n        We had: ... after adding \"XQuery\" in reverse: \"yreuQX\", then we added the last part of \"application\": \n\n          We started at the end of the string and moved backwards. After the hyphen we had the letters of \"application\" (which are at the left of the hyphen) in reverse order? \n\n        Actually, the string is: \n\n          \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\n          After f1: \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\" (we only removed the last '2')\n\n        Now, when we traverse backwards:\n\n          We first skip the non-letters at the very end ('.', '2', space) and then we get to \"y\" (of Query) -> then the rest of Query in reverse: 'r','e','u','Q','X'\n\n          Then we skip the space and then the hyphen and then space? \n\n          Then we are at the end of \"application\": the last letter of \"application\" is 'n'. Then we go backwards: 'o','i','t','a','c','i','l','p','p','a'\n\n          Then we hit a hyphen -> skip.\n\n          Then we are at the end of \"performing\": the last letter is 'g'. Then backwards: 'n','i','m','r','o','f','r','e','p'\n\n          Then hyphen -> skip.\n\n          Then \"medium\": last letter 'm', then 'u','i','d','e','m'\n\n          Then hyphen -> skip.\n\n          Then \"new\": last letter 'w', then 'e','n'\n\n        So the entire result: \n\n          \"y\" + \"r\" + \"e\" + \"u\" + \"Q\" + \"X\" + \n          \"n\" + \"o\" + \"i\" + \"t\" + \"a\" + \"c\" + \"i\" + \"l\" + \"p\" + \"p\" + \"a\" + \n          \"g\" + \"n\" + \"i\" + \"m\" + \"r\" + \"o\" + \"f\" + \"r\" + \"e\" + \"p\" + \n          \"m\" + \"u\" + \"i\" + \"d\" + \"e\" + \"m\" + \n          \"w\" + \"e\" + \"n\"\n\n        = \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n Therefore, the output of f2 is the string: \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n But note: the function f2 returns the string built by appending. \n\n However, let me write the exact steps:\n\n   Start: result = ''\n   i = len(text)-1 -> index of last character (which is '.') -> skip -> i becomes 45 (if we count the index? but we don't need to)\n\n   We can count the length of the string after f1:\n\n        Original string: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' \n        After removing the last '2': \n            becomes: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n        The original string has 45 characters? Let me count:\n\n          \"new\" -> 3\n          \"-medium\" -> 6 -> total 9\n          \"-performing\" -> 11 -> total 20\n          \"-application\" -> 12 -> total 32\n          \" - XQuery 2.2\" -> 11 (space, dash, space, 'XQuery' (6), space, '2.2' (3)) -> 11 -> total 43\n\n        After removing the last '2', we have 42 characters? \n\n        Actually, the original string: \n          s = 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n          len(s) = \n            new: 3\n            medium: 6 -> but with hyphens: \n            Actually, let me write without spaces: \n                \"new\" + \"-\" + \"medium\" + \"-\" + \"performing\" + \"-\" + \"application\" + \" - \" + \"XQuery\" + \" \" + \"2.2\"\n            = 3+1+6+1+11+1+12+3+6+1+3 = \n                3+1=4; 4+6=10; 10+1=11; 11+11=22; 22+1=23; 23+12=35; 35+3=38 (for \" - \" is 3 characters); 38+6=44; 44+1=45 (for the space before 2.2); 45+3=48? \n\n        Actually, let me count:\n\n          \"new\" -> 3\n          \"-\" -> 1 -> total 4\n          \"medium\" -> 6 -> total 10\n          \"-\" -> 1 -> total 11\n          \"performing\" -> 10? (p-e-r-f-o-r-m-i-n-g -> 10) -> total 21\n          \"-\" -> 1 -> total 22\n          \"application\" -> 11? (a-p-p-l-i-c-a-t-i-o-n -> 11) -> total 33\n          \" - \" -> 3 (space, dash, space) -> total 36\n          \"XQuery\" -> 6 -> total 42\n          \" \" -> 1 -> total 43\n          \"2.2\" -> 3 -> total 46\n\n        So the original string has 46 characters.\n\n        After removing the last character (the last '2'), we have 45 characters.\n\n        The string becomes: \n            'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n        Now, we traverse from index 44 (0-indexed) down to 0.\n\n        We skip the last character (index44: '.') -> then index43: '2' -> skip -> index42: space -> skip -> index41: 'y' -> add -> result='y'\n\n        Then index40: 'r' -> add -> 'yr'\n        index39: 'e' -> 'yre'\n        index38: 'u' -> 'yreu'\n        index37: 'Q' -> 'yreuQ'\n        index36: 'X' -> 'yreuQX'\n        index35: space -> skip\n        index34: ' ' -> skip? Actually, the string has two spaces? \n            The part: \" - XQuery 2.\" -> after the word XQuery there is a space and then the \"2.\".\n\n            But we removed the last '2', so now at index35: space? Actually, the string:\n\n            ... \" - XQuery 2.\" -> the characters at the end: \n                ... at index35: the space between XQuery and 2. -> but we have:\n\n            The string: \n                ... \"XQuery 2.\" -> \n                indices: \n                  ... [36: 'X', 37:'Q', 38:'u', 39:'e', 40:'r', 41:'y', 42: space, 43: '2', 44: '.']\n                After removing the last character (the '2' at index43? but note: the rstrip removes all trailing characters in the set until a non-set char. \n\n            Actually, the set is '0123456789-'. The original string ends with \"2.2\". \n            The rstrip will remove the trailing '2' (the last character) and then the next is '.' -> stop.\n\n            So the new string: \n                ... \"XQuery 2.\" -> \n                The last character is '.' and the one before is '2'? But wait, we removed the last '2', so the last two characters of the original were \".2\" and we removed the '2'? \n\n            Actually, the original string: \n                ... \"2.2\" -> \n                positions: \n                    ... [43] = '2', [44] = '.', [45] = '2'? \n\n            But we said the original string has 46 characters? \n\n            Let me index the original:\n\n                s = 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n                indices 0 to 45.\n\n                The last character (index45) is '2'\n                index44 is '.'\n                index43 is '2'\n                index42 is space\n\n            So after rstrip, we remove the last character (index45: '2') -> so the new string is s[0:45] -> which is:\n\n                ... '2.' -> so index44 becomes the last character: '.' and index43 is '2'\n\n            Now, when we traverse:\n\n                i starts at 44 (last index of the new string, which is '.' -> skip)\n                then i=43: '2' -> skip\n                then i=42: space -> skip\n                then i=41: 'y' -> add.\n\n            So the indices for the \"XQuery\" part: \n                'X' is at index 36, 'Q' at 37, 'u' at 38, 'e' at 39, 'r' at 40, 'y' at 41.\n\n            Then after the space at index42, we have the '2' at 43 and '.' at 44.\n\n            So we are good.\n\n        Now, after the space at index42, we go to index41: 'y' -> then 40: 'r', 39: 'e', 38: 'u', 37: 'Q', 36: 'X'\n\n        Then index35: space -> skip.\n\n        Then index34: '-' -> skip? \n        Then index33: space -> skip? \n        Then index32: 'n' (the last letter of \"application\") -> add -> now result = \"yreuQX\" + 'n' -> \"yreuQXn\"\n\n        Then index31: 'o' -> \"yreuQXno\"\n        index30: 'i' -> \"yreuQXnoi\"\n        index29: 't' -> \"yreuQXnoit\"\n        index28: 'a' -> \"yreuQXnoita\"\n        index27: 'c' -> \"yreuQXnoitac\"\n        index26: 'i' -> \"yreuQXnoitaci\"\n        index25: 'l' -> \"yreuQXnoitacil\"\n        index24: 'p' -> \"yreuQXnoitacilp\"\n        index23: 'p' -> \"yreuQXnoitacilpp\"\n        index22: 'a' -> \"yreuQXnoitacilppa\"\n\n        Then index21: '-' -> skip.\n\n        Then index20: 'g' (the last letter of \"performing\") -> add -> \"yreuQXnoitacilppag\"\n        index19: 'n' -> ... \n\n        We see the pattern.\n\n        So the result is indeed: \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n Therefore, the final answer is the string: 'yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen'\n\n But note: the function f2 is defined to return the string of alphabetic characters in reverse order (from last to first). \n\n However, let me check if there is any mistake in the word \"performing\": \n        \"performing\" reversed (as a word) is 'gnimrofrep', but note we are taking the entire string backwards.\n\n        The word \"performing\" in the original string is in the middle. When we traverse backwards, we get the letters of \"performing\" in reverse order? \n\n        Actually, the word \"performing\" is from index? ... but we are traversing the entire string backwards. \n\n        The word \"performing\" comes before the hyphen and then \"application\". So when we traverse backwards, we first get the letters of \"application\" (in reverse order of the word) and then the letters of \"performing\" (in reverse order of the word). \n\n        But note: the word \"performing\" itself, when taken in reverse, is 'gnimrofrep'. \n\n        Similarly, \"application\" reversed is 'noitacilppa'. \n\n        And \"XQuery\" reversed is 'yreuQX'. \n\n        And \"medium\" reversed is 'muidem'. \n        And \"new\" reversed is 'wen'. \n\n        So the entire string of letters in the original: \n            \"new\" + \"medium\" + \"performing\" + \"application\" + \"XQuery\"\n\n        becomes in the result: \n            reverse(\"XQuery\") + reverse(\"application\") + reverse(\"performing\") + reverse(\"medium\") + reverse(\"new\")\n\n        = \"yreuQX\" + \"noitacilppa\" + \"gnimrofrep\" + \"muidem\" + \"wen\"\n\n        = \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n        So we are confident.\n\n Therefore, the output is: 'yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen'\n\n But note: the function f2 might have a mistake? \n\n        The function f2:\n\n          def f2(text):\n              result = ''\n              i = len(text)-1\n              while i >= 0:\n                  c = text[i]\n                  if c.isalpha():\n                      result += c\n                  i -= 1\n              return result\n\n        This builds the string by appending each letter in the order of traversal (from last to first). \n\n        So the result is the reverse of the original string but with non-alphabetic characters removed.\n\n        Alternatively, it is the same as: \n            ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, text))[::-1]\n\n        But note: the above expression would be:\n\n            s = filter(str.isalpha, text)   -> gives the letters in order (from first to last)\n            then [::-1] reverses that string.\n\n        However, in our function, we are traversing from last to first and appending each letter. \n\n        So it is the same as:\n\n            s = [c for c in text[::-1] if c.isalpha()]   -> but note: we are not reversing the entire string and then filtering, because we are skipping non-alphas.\n\n        Actually, it is the same as: \n            ''.join(c for c in reversed(text) if c.isalpha())\n\n        And that is the same as: \n            ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, reversed(text)))\n\n        But note: `reversed(text)` is an iterator that goes from last char to first.\n\n        So the function f2 is correct for that.\n\n        Therefore, the output is as above.\n\n Let me write the entire string without non-alphabetic characters: \n\n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationXQuery\"\n\n        Then reverse: \n\n          \"yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen\"\n\n So the assert statement should be:\n\n        assert ... == 'yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen'\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement with the output\", and we are to output the string.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement. If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n So we output: 'yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen'\n\n But wait, let me check the case: \n\n        The original string has \"XQuery\" -> the 'X' is uppercase and 'Q' is uppercase. \n\n        In the result, we have \"yreuQX\": \n            'y' is lowercase, then 'r' lowercase, then 'e' lowercase, then 'u' lowercase, then 'Q' uppercase, then 'X' uppercase.\n\n        This is correct because we are taking the letters as they appear, and we are traversing backwards.\n\n        The function `isalpha` returns True for both upper and lower case.\n\n        So the result is correct.\n\n Final answer: 'yreuQXnoitacilppagnimrofrepmuidemwen'"
