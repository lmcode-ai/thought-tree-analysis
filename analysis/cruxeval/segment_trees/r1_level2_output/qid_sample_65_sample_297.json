Now, the test case: \n  f1([3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3)\n\nSteps for f1:\n  - The list initially is [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and index=3.\n  - nums[3] is 3 (because indexing starts at 0: index0=3, index1=2, index2=0, index3=3).\n  - Then we compute: \n        part1 = 3 % 42 = 3\n        part2 = nums.pop(3) * 2 -> this pops the element at index 3 (which is 3) and returns 3, then multiplies by 2 -> 6.\n  - So the return value is 3 + 6 = 9.
