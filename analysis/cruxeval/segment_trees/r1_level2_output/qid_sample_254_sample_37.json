    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each function does.\n\nFunction f1(text, repl):\n  - It creates a translation table using `str.maketrans` that maps each character in `text.lower()` to the corresponding character in `repl.lower()`.\n  - Then it applies this translation to the original `text` and returns the result.\n\nHowever, note that the two strings passed to `str.maketrans` must be of the same length. Otherwise, it will raise an exception.\n\nIn the test case, we have:\n  f1('upper case', 'lower case')\n\nThe two strings are:\n  text = 'upper case'\n  repl = 'lower case'\n\nBut note: \n  len('upper case') = 10 (including the space)\n  len('lower case') = 10 (including the space)\n\nSo, the translation table will map:\n  u -> l\n  p -> o\n  p -> w   ??? Wait, let me check: the mapping is done by position.\n\nActually, the `str.maketrans` function when given two strings of the same length will map the i-th character of the first string to the i-th character of the second.\n\nSo:\n  'u' -> 'l'\n  'p' -> 'o'\n  'p' -> 'w'? But wait, the first string is \"upper case\" and the second is \"lower case\". Let's break it down:\n\nFirst string (text.lower()): \"upper case\" -> \"upper case\" (already lower)\nSecond string (repl.lower()): \"lower case\" -> \"lower case\"\n\nSo the mapping is:\n  'u' -> 'l'\n  'p' -> 'o'\n  'p' -> 'w'? -> Actually, the second character of \"upper case\" is 'p', and the second character of \"lower case\" is 'o'. The third character of \"upper case\" is also 'p', and the third character of \"lower case\" is 'w'. \n\nBut note: the string \"upper case\" has 10 characters: \n  u, p, p, e, r,  , c, a, s, e\n\nThe string \"lower case\" has 10 characters:\n  l, o, w, e, r,  , c, a, s, e\n\nSo the mapping is:\n  u -> l\n  p -> o   (for the first p at index1)\n  p -> w   (for the second p at index2)\n  e -> e\n  r -> r\n  ' ' -> ' '\n  c -> c\n  a -> a\n  s -> s\n  e -> e\n\nBut note: the same character in the input string might appear multiple times and get mapped to different things? Actually, no. The `str.maketrans` function creates a mapping from each character in the first string to the corresponding character in the second string, but if a character appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the string will override? Actually, no: the mapping is built by going through each position. However, the translation table is a dictionary-like object that maps each character in the first string to the character at the same position in the second string. But if the same character appears multiple times in the first string, then the last mapping for that character will be the one that remains because the table is built by iterating and assigning for each index.\n\nLet me test with a small example:\n\n  s1 = \"aa\"\n  s2 = \"bc\"\n  Then the translation table would map:\n      first character: 'a' -> 'b'\n      second character: 'a' -> 'c'\n\nBut then when we translate, each 'a' in the original string will be replaced by the last mapping? Actually, no: the `str.maketrans` function does not work that way. It will create a mapping for each character in the first string to the corresponding character in the second string. However, if the same character appears multiple times, then the mapping for that character will be the last one that appears for that character.\n\nIn the example above, the table would map:\n  'a' -> 'c'   (because the last occurrence of 'a' in the first string is mapped to 'c')\n\nSo in our case, the character 'p' in the original text will be replaced by the last mapping for 'p'. In the first string, the first 'p' is at index1 and maps to 'o', and the second 'p' at index2 maps to 'w'. So the translation table will have:\n  'p' -> 'w'\n\nSimilarly, the character 'e' appears at index3 and index9. The mapping at index3 is 'e'->'e' and at index9 is 'e'->'e'. So it remains 'e'.\n\nTherefore, the translation table for the given call f1('upper case', 'lower case') will be:\n\n  'u' -> 'l'\n  'p' -> 'w'   (because the last occurrence of 'p' in the first string is the one that sets the mapping for 'p')\n  'e' -> 'e'\n  'r' -> 'r'\n  ' ' -> ' '\n  'c' -> 'c'\n  'a' -> 'a'\n  's' -> 's'\n\nBut note: the first string also has the letter 'u' only once, and the rest are as above.\n\nSo when we apply the translation to the string \"upper case\":\n  u -> l\n  p -> w (both p's become w)\n  e -> e\n  r -> r\n  space -> space\n  c -> c\n  a -> a\n  s -> s\n  e -> e\n\nTherefore, the string becomes:\n  \"u\" becomes \"l\"\n  first \"p\" becomes \"w\"\n  second \"p\" becomes \"w\"\n  \"e\" becomes \"e\"\n  \"r\" becomes \"r\"\n  then space -> space\n  then \"c\" -> \"c\", \"a\"->\"a\", \"s\"->\"s\", \"e\"->\"e\"\n\nSo: \"upper\" becomes \"lwwer\", and then \" case\" becomes \" case\" (because the mapping for the letters in \" case\" are the same as the original, except note that the 'e' at the end is also mapped to 'e').\n\nTherefore, the entire string becomes: \"lwwer case\"\n\nBut wait, let me write it step by step:\n\nOriginal: u p p e r   c a s e\nMapped:   l w w e r   c a s e\n\nSo: \"lwwer case\"\n\nNow, we pass this string to f2.\n\nFunction f2(text):\n  It creates a list `text_arr`.\n  For each index j in the range of the length of the text, it appends the substring starting at j to the end.\n\nSo for the string \"lwwer case\", which has 10 characters (including the space), we will have:\n\nj=0: text[0:] -> \"lwwer case\"\nj=1: text[1:] -> \"wwer case\"\nj=2: text[2:] -> \"wer case\"\nj=3: text[3:] -> \"er case\"\nj=4: text[4:] -> \"r case\"\nj=5: text[5:] -> \" case\"\nj=6: text[6:] -> \"case\"\nj=7: text[7:] -> \"ase\"\nj=8: text[8:] -> \"se\"\nj=9: text[9:] -> \"e\"\n\nSo the list returned by f2 is:\n[\n  \"lwwer case\",\n  \"wwer case\",\n  \"wer case\",\n  \"er case\",\n  \"r case\",\n  \" case\",\n  \"case\",\n  \"ase\",\n  \"se\",\n  \"e\"\n]\n\nNow, we are to write the assert statement:\n\nassert f2(f1('upper case', 'lower case')) == [ ... the above list ... ]\n\nBut note: the problem says to output the result of the function call without any extra information.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement. If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\nBut here the output is a list of strings. So we should output the list as it would appear in Python.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" But the output is a list. So we write the list with each string in single quotes.\n\nTherefore, the expected output is:\n\n['lwwer case', 'wwer case', 'wer case', 'er case', 'r case', ' case', 'case', 'ase', 'se', 'e']\n\nBut note: the original string \"lwwer case\" has a space in it, so the first element is \"lwwer case\", which is 10 characters. The second is \"wwer case\" (without the first character) and so on.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the mapping again. The original string \"upper case\" becomes:\n\nu -> l\np -> w (for both p's)\nso \"upper\" becomes \"lwwer\", and then the space and \"case\" remain because the mapping for those letters is the same? \n\nBut wait, the mapping for the letters in \"case\" are:\n  c -> c\n  a -> a\n  s -> s\n  e -> e\n\nSo yes, \" case\" becomes \" case\".\n\nTherefore, the list is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement with the output\", but we are only to return the output.\n\nSo the answer is the list: \n['lwwer case', 'wwer case', 'wer case', 'er case', 'r case', ' case', 'case', 'ase', 'se', 'e']\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\" So we assume the functions are as defined.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: the function f1 uses `text.lower()` and `repl.lower()`, but the original text might have uppercase. In our case, the input text is 'upper case' (which is all lowercase except the first letter? Actually, no: the string is 'upper case' -> the first letter is lowercase? Actually, in the example, the string is given as 'upper case'. In Python, this is a string with the first letter of the first word being 'u' (lowercase) and the first letter of the second word being 'c' (lowercase). So it's all lowercase except that the first word is not capitalized? Actually, it is entirely in lowercase.\n\nWait, the string is 'upper case': \n  'u' is lowercase, and the rest are lowercase.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut note: the function f1 uses the original `text` (without converting to lower) to do the translation. The translation table is built from the lowercase versions, but then applied to the original `text`. Since the original text is in lowercase, it's the same.\n\nBut what if the original text had uppercase? The translation table is built from the lowercase versions, so the uppercase letters are not in the table. However, in this test case, the text is entirely lowercase.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the output of f2(f1('upper case', 'lower case')) is the list:\n\n['lwwer case', 'wwer case', 'wer case', 'er case', 'r case', ' case', 'case', 'ase', 'se', 'e']\n\nNow, we write it as a Python list of strings, each string in single quotes.\n\nBut note: the problem says to enclose the output in single quotes if it is a string. Since it is a list, we write the list with the strings in single quotes.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n['lwwer case', 'wwer case', 'wer case', 'er case', 'r case', ' case', 'case', 'ase', 'se', 'e']"
