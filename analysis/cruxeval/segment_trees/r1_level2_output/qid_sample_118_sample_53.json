Then we count the frequency of the mapped character. Let's break down the characters:\n\n      z -> not in the mapping, so name = 'z'\n      b -> maps to 'c'\n      z -> 'z'\n      q -> 'q'\n      u -> 'u'\n      i -> 'i'\n      u -> 'u'\n      q -> 'q'\n      n -> 'n'\n      m -> 'm'\n      f -> 'f'\n      k -> 'k'\n      x -> 'x'\n\n   But note: the mapping is applied per character. So the mapped characters are:\n        z -> 'z'\n        b -> 'c'\n        z -> 'z'\n        q -> 'q'\n        u -> 'u'\n        i -> 'i'\n        u -> 'u'\n        q -> 'q'\n        n -> 'n'\n        m -> 'm'   (note: 'm' is not in the mapping keys, so it remains 'm')\n        f -> 'f'   (note: 'f' is not in the mapping keys? but note the mapping only has 'a' to 'e'. So yes, it remains) k -> 'k'\n        x -> 'x'\n\n   Now, we count the frequency of each mapped character:\n\n        z: 2\n        c: 1   (from the 'b')\n        q: 2\n        u: 2\n        i: 1\n        n: 1\n        m: 1\n        f: 1\n        k: 1\n        x: 1\n\n   The dictionary `occ` will have:\n        'z': 2\n        'c': 1\n        'q': 2\n        'u': 2\n        'i': 1\n        'n': 1\n        'm': 1\n        'f': 1\n        'k': 1\n        'x': 1\n\n   Then, the function returns [x for _, x in occ.items()] -> this is a list of the counts (the values). So the list of counts: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   However, note that the dictionary does not preserve order. But the problem does not specify an order.

So text remains 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'\n\n   Second iteration (i=1):\n        extra_chars += chars -> extra_chars = 'mk' + 'mk' = 'mkmk'\n        Then, text = text.replace('mkmk', '') -> the string 'zbzquiuqnmfkx' does not contain 'mkmk' either.\n\n   Therefore, f1 returns the original string: 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.\n\n Let's look at f2:\n   def f2(text):\n        occ = {}\n        for ch in text:\n            name = {'a': 'b', 'b': 'c', 'c': 'd', 'd': 'e', 'e': 'f'}\n            name = name.get(ch, ch)\n            occ[name] = occ.get(name, 0) + 1\n        return [x for _, x in occ.items()]\n\n Steps for f2 with text = 'zbzquiuqnmfkx':\n\n   We are going to iterate over each character in the string.\n\n   The dictionary mapping is:\n        'a' -> 'b'\n        'b' -> 'c'\n        'c' -> 'd'\n        'd' -> 'e'\n        'e' -> 'f'\n        For any other character, it maps to itself.\n\n   Then we count the frequency of the mapped character.\n\n   Let's break down the characters:\n\n      z -> not in the mapping, so name = 'z'\n      b -> maps to 'c'\n      z -> 'z'\n      q -> 'q'\n      u -> 'u'\n      i -> 'i'\n      u -> 'u'\n      q -> 'q'\n      n -> 'n'\n      m -> 'm'\n      f -> 'f'\n      k -> 'k'\n      x -> 'x'\n\n   But note: the mapping is applied per character.\n\n   So the mapped characters are:\n        z -> 'z'\n        b -> 'c'\n        z -> 'z'\n        q -> 'q'\n        u -> 'u'\n        i -> 'i'\n        u -> 'u'\n        q -> 'q'\n        n -> 'n'\n        m -> 'm'   (note: 'm' is not in the mapping keys, so it remains 'm')\n        f -> 'f'   (note: 'f' is not in the mapping keys? but note the mapping only has 'a' to 'e'. So yes, it remains)\n        k -> 'k'\n        x -> 'x'\n\n   Now, we count the frequency of each mapped character:\n\n        z: 2\n        c: 1   (from the 'b')\n        q: 2\n        u: 2\n        i: 1\n        n: 1\n        m: 1\n        f: 1\n        k: 1\n        x: 1\n\n   The dictionary `occ` will have:\n        'z': 2\n        'c': 1\n        'q': 2\n        'u': 2\n        'i': 1\n        'n': 1\n        'm': 1\n        'f': 1\n        'k': 1\n        'x': 1\n\n   Then, the function returns [x for _, x in occ.items()] -> this is a list of the counts (the values).\n\n   So the list of counts: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   However, note that the dictionary does not preserve order. But the problem does not specify an order.\n\n   But the assert statement is going to compare to a specific order? Actually, the problem says \"complete the assert statement with the output\", meaning we have to output the exact list as it would be produced.\n\n   How does the dictionary iteration order work? In Python, prior to 3.7, dictionaries were unordered. But in the problem, we are not told the Python version. However, note that the function f2 returns [x for _, x in occ.items()]. The order of items in the dictionary is the insertion order.\n\n   How are the characters inserted?\n        We traverse the string: 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'\n\n        The mapped characters in order of first occurrence:\n\n          'z' -> first time: insert 'z' (count=1), then later again (count becomes 2)\n          'b' -> mapped to 'c': insert 'c' (count=1)\n          then again 'z' -> already exists, so update (but we are iterating and the key is already there, so we update the count, but the insertion order is by first occurrence of the key)\n\n        Actually, the insertion order is by the first time we see a mapped character.\n\n        So:\n\n          z: first at the beginning -> key 'z' inserted first.\n          then 'b' becomes 'c' -> key 'c' inserted next.\n          then 'z' again -> already exists, so we update.\n          then 'q' -> new -> inserted next.\n          then 'u' -> new -> inserted next.\n          then 'i' -> new -> inserted next.\n          then 'u' again -> update.\n          then 'q' again -> update.\n          then 'n' -> new.\n          then 'm' -> new.\n          then 'f' -> new.\n          then 'k' -> new.\n          then 'x' -> new.\n\n        So the keys in insertion order: \n            'z', 'c', 'q', 'u', 'i', 'n', 'm', 'f', 'k', 'x'\n\n        Therefore, the counts in that order: \n            z: 2 -> 2\n            c: 1 -> 1\n            q: 2 -> 2\n            u: 2 -> 2\n            i: 1 -> 1\n            n: 1 -> 1\n            m: 1 -> 1\n            f: 1 -> 1\n            k: 1 -> 1\n            x: 1 -> 1\n\n        So the list is: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   However, wait: the mapping for the second character 'b' becomes 'c'. Then we have a key 'c'. Then when we see the next 'z', that's the same as the first, so we update the count for 'z'. Then we see 'q' (new), then 'u' (new), then 'i' (new), then 'u' (update), then 'q' (update), then the rest are new.\n\n   Therefore, the list of counts in the order of insertion is: \n        [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the order? Actually, the assert statement will compare the list. However, the problem says \"complete the assert statement\", meaning we have to output the exact list that the function returns.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n   So we output: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   But wait, let me double-check the string: 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'\n\n   The characters and their mapping:\n\n        z -> z\n        b -> c\n        z -> z\n        q -> q\n        u -> u\n        i -> i\n        u -> u\n        q -> q\n        n -> n\n        m -> m\n        f -> f\n        k -> k\n        x -> x\n\n   Now, the frequency:\n\n        z: 2\n        c: 1\n        q: 2\n        u: 2\n        i: 1\n        n: 1\n        m: 1\n        f: 1\n        k: 1\n        x: 1\n\n   And the insertion order is by the first occurrence of the mapped character:\n\n        first character: z -> key 'z'\n        second: c -> key 'c'\n        third: z -> already exists\n        fourth: q -> new\n        fifth: u -> new\n        sixth: i -> new\n        seventh: u -> already exists\n        eighth: q -> already exists\n        ninth: n -> new\n        tenth: m -> new\n        eleventh: f -> new\n        twelfth: k -> new\n        thirteenth: x -> new\n\n   So the keys in order: ['z','c','q','u','i','n','m','f','k','x'] and the counts: \n        z:2, c:1, q:2, u:2, i:1, n:1, m:1, f:1, k:1, x:1\n\n   Therefore, the list is [2,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1].\n\n   However, note that the function f2 returns [x for _, x in occ.items()], which is the counts in the order of the keys as they appear in the dictionary (by insertion order).\n\n   So the output is [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" However, the output is a list of integers. So we output the list as is.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n However, let me reexamine the function f1: did we miss something?\n\n   In f1, we are doing:\n        first iteration: replace 'mk' by '' -> but the string is 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'. \n        There is no 'mk'? Let me check: \n            The string: 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'\n            We see: ... 'nmfkx' -> there is an 'm' followed by 'f', then 'k' and 'x'. So no consecutive 'm' and 'k'? \n            Actually, the substring 'mk' does not appear.\n\n        second iteration: replace 'mkmk' -> also not present.\n\n   So the string remains unchanged.\n\n   But wait: what if the string had 'm' and then later a 'k'? The replace only replaces contiguous substrings.\n\n   Therefore, the string is unchanged.\n\n   So the input to f2 is 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'.\n\n   Now, let's run the mapping again for f2:\n\n        The mapping dictionary is defined inside the loop? Actually, it is defined inside the for loop. That means for every character, we are redefining the dictionary.\n\n   This is a critical point.\n\n   The code for f2:\n\n        def f2(text):\n            occ = {}\n            for ch in text:\n                name = {'a': 'b', 'b': 'c', 'c': 'd', 'd': 'e', 'e': 'f'}   # This line is inside the loop\n                name = name.get(ch, ch)\n                occ[name] = occ.get(name, 0) + 1\n            return [x for _, x in occ.items()]\n\n   So for every character, we are creating a new dictionary. That is inefficient but correct.\n\n   The mapping for each character is the same: it's the same dictionary. So it doesn't matter that we redefine it every time.\n\n   Therefore, the mapping is consistent.\n\n   So the result is as above.\n\n   However, let me test with a small example to be sure.\n\n   Example: for the first character 'z':\n        We create the dictionary: {'a':'b', 'b':'c', ...}\n        Then we do: name = dictionary.get('z', 'z') -> returns 'z'\n\n   Then for the next character 'b':\n        We create the same dictionary again.\n        Then name = dictionary.get('b','b') -> returns 'c'\n\n   So the mapping is applied correctly.\n\n   Therefore, the output is [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information\", so we just output the list.\n\n   However, the problem says \"complete the assert statement\", meaning we have to write the expected output.\n\n   The assert statement is:\n\n        assert f2(f1('zbzquiuqnmfkx', 'mk')) == \n\n   We are to complete it with the output.\n\n   So we write: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" \n   Since the output is a list, we write it as a list.\n\n   However, note that the problem says \"Only return the output of the function\", meaning we output the value that the function returns.\n\n   So we output: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   But let me check if the order is fixed? The dictionary insertion order is by the first occurrence of the key. The keys are:\n\n        'z' (from the first character)\n        'c' (from the second character, which was 'b' mapped to 'c')\n        then the rest in the order they appear: 'q', 'u', 'i', 'n', 'm', 'f', 'k', 'x'\n\n   This order is fixed because we traverse the string from left to right.\n\n   Therefore, the list is fixed.\n\n   Final answer: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"
