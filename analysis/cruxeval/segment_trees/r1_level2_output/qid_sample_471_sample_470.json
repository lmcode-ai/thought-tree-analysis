Therefore, f1 returns -1.\n\nStep 2: Now compute f2(-1)\n  In f2, we have:\n      transl = {'A':1, 'B':2, 'C':3, 'D':4, 'E':5}\n  We are iterating over key, value in transl.items() and checking if value % number == 0.\n  Here, number = -1.\n\n  Note: In Python, the modulus operation with a negative divisor is defined. However, note that for any non-zero integer n, n % (-1) is always 0? \n  Let's check: \n      In Python, the modulus is defined such that: (a % b) = a - b * floor(a/b)\n      For positive a and negative b, but note our values are positive (1,2,3,4,5) and divisor is -1.\n\n  Actually, let's compute for each value:\n\n  For value = 1: 1 % (-1) \n      We have: 1 = (-1) * (-1) + 0?

Because any integer divided by -1 gives a quotient that is the negative of the integer, and then the remainder is 0.\n\n  Therefore, for every value in the dictionary (1,2,3,4,5), we have:\n      value % (-1) == 0\n\n  So the condition is true for every key. Therefore, f2(-1) returns the list of all keys: ['A','B','C','D','E']\n\nBut note: the problem says to output the result without any extra information. The expected output is a list of characters.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" But note that the output is a list of strings. So we must represent the list as it is.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\nSo we are to output: ['A','B','C','D','E']\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the modulus with negative in Python:\n\nIn Python 3:\n\n>>> 1 % -1\n0\n>>> 2 % -1\n0\n>>> 3 % -1\n0\n\nSo yes, any integer modulo -1 is 0.\n\nTherefore, the result is ['A','B','C','D','E'].\n\nBut note: the function f1 returns -1 because 'o' is not in 'fnmart'.
