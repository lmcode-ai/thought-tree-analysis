Actually, we have to include the spaces and non-alphabet characters.\n\n So: \n   Original: 'Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#'\n   After f1: \n        H -> H\n        e -> E -> so becomes 'H' + 'E' -> \"HE\"\n        y -> y -> \"HEy\"\n        space -> space -> \"HEy \"\n        D -> D -> \"HEy D\"\n        U -> u -> \"HEy Du\"\n        d -> d -> \"HEy Dud\"\n        E -> e -> \"HEy Dude\"\n        space -> space -> \"HEy Dude \"\n        T -> t -> \"HEy Dude t\"\n        H -> H -> \"HEy Dude tH\"\n        i -> I -> \"HEy Dude tHI\"\n        s -> s -> \"HEy Dude tHIs\"\n        space -> space -> \"HEy Dude tHIs \"\n        $ -> $ -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $\"\n        n -> N -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $N\"\n        d -> d -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd\"\n        ^ -> ^ -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^\"\n        space -> space -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ \"\n        & -> & -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &\"\n        * -> * -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*\"\n        & -> & -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&\"\n        t -> t -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&t\"\n        h -> H -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tH\"\n        i -> i -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHi\"\n        s -> S -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS\"\n        @ -> @ -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@\"\n        # -> # -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n\n However, note that the original string has 28 characters? Let me count:\n\n   'Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#' \n   H e y   D U d E   T H i s   $ n d ^   & * & t h i s @ # \n   => 3 (Hey) + 1 space + 4 (DUdE) + 1 space + 4 (THis) + 1 space + 4 ($nd^) + 1 space + 6 (&*&this@#) \n   = 3+1+4+1+4+1+4+1+6 = 25? \n\n But let me write the string and count:\n\n  0: H\n  1: e\n  2: y\n  3: ' '\n  4: D\n  5: U\n  6: d\n  7: E\n  8: ' '\n  9: T\n  10: H\n  11: i\n  12: s\n  13: ' '\n  14: $\n  15: n\n  16: d\n  17: ^\n  18: ' '\n  19: &\n  20: *\n  21: &\n  22: t\n  23: h\n  24: i\n  25: s\n  26: @\n  27: #\n\n So 28 characters? (from 0 to 27)\n\n Therefore, the output of f1 is: \"HEy DuDe tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.\n\n The function f2:\n   - Computes the length as len(text) // 2 (integer division)\n   - Splits the string into two halves: \n        left_half = text[:length]\n        right_half = text[length:][::-1]   -> which means the second half is reversed.\n\n The length of the string from f1 is 28, so length = 28 // 2 = 14.\n\n left_half = text[0:14] -> \"HEy DuDe tHIs \"\n\n right_half = text[14:][::-1] \n   text[14:] is the substring from index14 to the end: \"$Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n   Reversing that: \n        Original: \"$Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n        Reverse: \"#@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n So, the result of f2 is left_half + right_half = \n        \"HEy DuDe tHIs \" + \"#@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n Now, note that the left_half is exactly the first 14 characters:\n\n   \"HEy DuDe tHIs \" -> \n        H E y   D u D e   t H I s   (and then a space at the end? Actually, the 14th character is the space at index13? Let's break the first 14 characters of the f1 output:\n\n        f1 output: \"HEy DuDe tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n        First 14: \n          index0: 'H'\n          index1: 'E'\n          index2: 'y'\n          index3: ' '\n          index4: 'D'\n          index5: 'u'\n          index6: 'D'\n          index7: 'e'\n          index8: ' '\n          index9: 't'\n          index10: 'H'\n          index11: 'I'\n          index12: 's'\n          index13: ' '   -> so the 14th character (index13) is the space after \"tHIs\"\n\n        So the left_half is \"HEy DuDe tHIs \"\n\n        Then the right_half is the rest: starting at index14: \n          index14: '$'\n          index15: 'N'\n          index16: 'd'\n          index17: '^'\n          index18: ' '\n          index19: '&'\n          index20: '*'\n          index21: '&'\n          index22: 't'\n          index23: 'H'\n          index24: 'i'\n          index25: 'S'\n          index26: '@'\n          index27: '#'\n\n        Reversing: \n          Original: ['$','N','d','^',' ','&','*','&','t','H','i','S','@','#'] \n          Reverse: \n            first character in the reversed is the last: '#' then '@', then 'S', then 'i', then 'H', then 't', then '&', then '*', then '&', then ' ', then '^', then 'd', then 'N', then '$'\n\n        So: \"#@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n Therefore, the entire string is: \"HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n But note: the left_half has a space at the end? and the reversed right_half starts with '#'? So no space in between? \n\n So the final string: \"HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n However, let me write it without the break:\n\n   \"HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n But wait, the original string had a space at index18? and in the reversed part, the space is at the 5th position from the end? \n\n Actually, the reversed string of the second half is:\n\n   Original second half: \"$Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\" \n   Reversing: \n        '$' -> becomes last\n        'N' -> second last\n        ... \n        So: \n          '$' at index0 in the second half becomes the last character in the reversed? \n          But we are reversing the entire substring.\n\n        Actually, the second half is: \n          [0] = '$' -> becomes at the end (position 13 in the reversed)\n          [1] = 'N' -> becomes at position 12\n          [2] = 'd' -> becomes at position 11\n          [3] = '^' -> becomes at position 10\n          [4] = ' ' -> becomes at position 9\n          [5] = '&' -> becomes at position 8\n          [6] = '*' -> becomes at position 7\n          [7] = '&' -> becomes at position 6\n          [8] = 't' -> becomes at position 5\n          [9] = 'H' -> becomes at position 4\n          [10] = 'i' -> becomes at position 3\n          [11] = 'S' -> becomes at position 2\n          [12] = '@' -> becomes at position 1\n          [13] = '#' -> becomes at position 0\n\n        So the reversed string is: \n          position0: '#' \n          position1: '@'\n          position2: 'S'\n          position3: 'i'\n          position4: 'H'\n          position5: 't'\n          position6: '&'\n          position7: '*'\n          position8: '&'\n          position9: ' '\n          position10: '^'\n          position11: 'd'\n          position12: 'N'\n          position13: '$'\n\n        Therefore: \"#@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n So the entire string is: \"HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n But note: the left_half is \"HEy DuDe tHIs \" (with a space at the end) and then we append \"#@SiHt&*& ^dN$\", so the space and the '#' are adjacent? \n\n Therefore, the final output is: \"HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n However, let me check the exact characters:\n\n   left_half: \n        H, E, y, space, D, u, D, e, space, t, H, I, s, space -> 14 characters.\n\n   right_half reversed: \n        #, @, S, i, H, t, &, *, &, space, ^, d, N, $ -> 14 characters.\n\n   Combined: \n        \"HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n But note: the original string had a space at index18? and in the reversed part, the space is in the middle? \n\n However, the output string is exactly as above.\n\n Therefore, the result of the expression is: \"HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n But wait, the problem says: \n   \"assert f2(f1('Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#')) == \"\n\n We have to output the string that the expression evaluates to.\n\n However, note that the function names: \n   The first function is called f1 and the second is f2.\n\n We computed f1 first and then f2 on the result.\n\n So the final answer is: 'HEy DuDe tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$'\n\n But let me double-check the f1 step again? \n\n Original: 'Hey DUdE THis $nd^ &*&this@#'\n After f1: \n   index0: H -> H\n   index1: e -> E -> so \"HE\"\n   index2: y -> y -> \"HEy\"\n   index3: space -> space -> \"HEy \"\n   index4: D -> D -> \"HEy D\"\n   index5: U -> u -> \"HEy Du\"\n   index6: d -> d -> \"HEy Dud\"\n   index7: E -> e -> \"HEy Dude\"\n   index8: space -> space -> \"HEy Dude \"\n   index9: T -> t -> \"HEy Dude t\"\n   index10: H -> H -> \"HEy Dude tH\"\n   index11: i -> I -> \"HEy Dude tHI\"\n   index12: s -> s -> \"HEy Dude tHIs\"\n   index13: space -> space -> \"HEy Dude tHIs \"\n   index14: $ -> $ -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $\"\n   index15: n -> N -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $N\"\n   index16: d -> d -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd\"\n   index17: ^ -> ^ -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^\"\n   index18: space -> space -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ \"\n   index19: & -> & -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &\"\n   index20: * -> * -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*\"\n   index21: & -> & -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&\"\n   index22: t -> t -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&t\"\n   index23: h -> H -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tH\"\n   index24: i -> i -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHi\"\n   index25: s -> S -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS\"\n   index26: @ -> @ -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@\"\n   index27: # -> # -> \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n\n So the f1 output is: \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n\n But wait, I see a discrepancy: \n   At index6: we have 'd' -> remains -> so after index5 we have \"HEy Du\", then index6 is 'd' -> so \"HEy Dud\", then index7: 'E' becomes 'e' -> so \"HEy Dude\"\n\n   However, the original string at index4 to index7: \n        index4: 'D', index5: 'U', index6: 'd', index7: 'E'\n        After f1: index4 remains 'D', index5 becomes 'u', index6 remains 'd', index7 becomes 'e' -> so \"Dude\"\n\n   So the word becomes \"Dude\", not \"DuDe\" as in the original? \n\n   But note: the original string had \"DUdE\", and we changed:\n        U (at index5) to 'u', and E (at index7) to 'e'. So it becomes \"Dude\".\n\n   Similarly, the next word: \"THis\" -> \n        T at index9 becomes 't', H at index10 remains, i at index11 becomes 'I', s at index12 remains -> so \"tHIs\"\n\n   Then the next: \"$nd^\" -> \n        n at index15 becomes 'N', so \"$Nd^\"\n\n   Then \"&*&this@#\" -> \n        h at index23 becomes 'H', s at index25 becomes 'S' -> so \"&*&tHiS@#\"\n\n   So the f1 output is: \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n\n   Now, the length is 28? \n\n   Now, f2: \n        length = 28 // 2 = 14.\n\n        left_half = text[0:14] -> \n            \"HEy Dude tHIs\" -> wait, let's count 14 characters:\n\n            H (0), E(1), y(2), space(3), D(4), u(5), d(6), e(7), space(8), t(9), H(10), I(11), s(12), space(13) -> the space at index13 is the one after \"tHIs\"?\n\n            Actually, the string: \n                \"HEy Dude tHIs $Nd^ &*&tHiS@#\"\n                The first 14 characters: \n                  H, E, y, space, D, u, d, e, space, t, H, I, s, space? \n                But wait, the word \"tHIs\" ends at index12 (s) and then at index13 is a space? \n\n            Actually, the original string had a space at index13? \n                The original: \n                  ... s (index12), then space (index13), then $ (index14)\n\n            So the left_half is: \"HEy Dude tHIs \" (with a space at the end)\n\n        right_half = text[14:] -> \n            starting at index14: \n                $ (index14), N (15), d (16), ^ (17), space (18), & (19), * (20), & (21), t (22), H (23), i (24), S (25), @ (26), # (27)\n\n        Reverse the right_half: \n            We have: \n                ['$','N','d','^',' ','&','*','&','t','H','i','S','@','#'] \n            reversed: \n                last character first: \n                '#' -> first\n                then '@'\n                then 'S'\n                then 'i'\n                then 'H'\n                then 't'\n                then '&'\n                then '*'\n                then '&'\n                then ' '\n                then '^'\n                then 'd'\n                then 'N'\n                then '$'\n\n            So: \"#@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n        Then the entire string: \n            left_half + right_half = \"HEy Dude tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n But note: in the left_half we have \"HEy Dude tHIs \" (with a space at the end) and then the reversed right_half starts with '#', so the space and the '#' are adjacent.\n\n Therefore, the final output is: \"HEy Dude tHIs #@SiHt&*& ^dN$\"\n\n However, in the initial breakdown I had \"DuDe\" but now it's \"Dude\".
