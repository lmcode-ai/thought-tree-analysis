    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2. We are to compute the result of:\n   f2(f1('Hello Is It MyClass'))\n\nFirst, let's analyze f1:\n\nf1(text):\n   if text.upper() == text:\n        return 'ALL UPPERCASE'\n   return text\n\nThe input string is 'Hello Is It MyClass'. \nCheck: \n   'Hello Is It MyClass'.upper() -> 'HELLO IS IT MYCLASS'\n   But the original string is not all uppercase (it has mixed case), so the condition fails.\n   Therefore, f1 returns the same string: 'Hello Is It MyClass'\n\nNow, we pass this string to f2.\n\nf2(text) does:\n   ls = list(text)   -> converts the string into a list of characters.\n\n   total = (len(text) - 1) * 2\n        len('Hello Is It MyClass') is 19 (counting spaces and letters: H e l l o   I s   I t   M y C l a s s -> 19 characters)\n        total = (19-1)*2 = 18*2 = 36\n\n   Then, we loop for i in range(1, total+1) -> i from 1 to 36 inclusive.\n\n   For each i:\n        if i is odd (i % 2 is 1, which is truthy) -> append a '+' at the end of the list.\n        else (i is even) -> insert a '+' at the beginning (index 0) of the list.\n\n   After the loop, we combine the list into a string and then call rjust(total) on that string.\n\nBut note: the rjust(total) pads the string on the left with spaces to make the total width equal to the given total (which is 36). However, the string we are building is going to be longer than 36 because we are adding 36 '+' signs to the original 19 characters? Actually, the original list has 19 characters and we are adding 36 characters (all '+').\n\nSo the total length of the string after the loop is 19 + 36 = 55.\n\nBut then we do: ''.join(ls).rjust(total) -> which is 55 characters long, and we are trying to right-justify it in a field of width 36? That doesn't make sense because 55 is already greater than 36. The rjust(total) will not add any spaces because the string is already longer than 36. Therefore, it returns the same string of 55 characters.\n\nBut wait, let's break down the process:\n\nWe start with: \n   ls = list('Hello Is It MyClass') -> 19 elements.\n\nThen we do 36 iterations:\n\n   i=1 (odd): append '+' -> now length 20\n   i=2 (even): insert '+' at beginning -> now length 21\n   i=3: append -> 22\n   i=4: insert at beginning -> 23\n   ... until i=36.\n\nWe are adding one character per iteration, so after 36 iterations, we have 19 + 36 = 55 characters.\n\nNow, the string is built by joining the list. Then we call rjust(36) on that string. The rjust method will return the string right-justified in a string of length 36. But if the string is already 55 characters long, then the result is just the original string (because 55>36, so no padding is added). \n\nTherefore, the result of f2 is a string of 55 characters.\n\nBut let's check the pattern:\n\nThe operations:\n   We start with: ['H', 'e', ... , 's', 's']\n   Then:\n      Step1: append '+' -> becomes [ ... , '+']\n      Step2: insert '+' at beginning -> ['+', ... , '+']\n      Step3: append '+' -> ['+', ... , '+', '+']\n      Step4: insert '+' at beginning -> ['+', '+', ... , '+', '+']\n\nSo after 4 steps: \n   original: 19\n   step1: 20\n   step2: 21\n   step3: 22\n   step4: 23\n\nAnd the pattern: \n   The list alternates between adding at the end and adding at the beginning.\n\nBut note: the number of '+' at the beginning and the end?\n\nActually, we have 36 iterations: half (18) are appends (odd indices) and half (18) are inserts at the beginning (even indices). So:\n\n   The final list will have:\n        at the beginning: 18 '+' (from the even i's: 2,4,...,36)\n        then the original 19 characters\n        then at the end: 18 '+' (from the odd i's: 1,3,...,35)\n\nBut wait, the first operation is i=1 (odd) -> append at the end -> so the first character added is at the end.\nThen i=2 (even) -> insert at the beginning -> so the next is at the beginning.\n\nSo the order of the beginning part: \n   The first inserted at beginning is the 2nd operation, then 4th, 6th, ... until 36th. So the beginning part is in the order of insertion: the 2nd operation becomes the first character, then the 4th becomes the new first (so the 4th is to the left of the 2nd) ... but actually, each insert is at index0, so the last inserted at beginning (the 36th) will be the very first.\n\nSimilarly, the appends: the first append (i=1) is the first at the end, then i=3, then i=5 ... until i=35. So the end part is in the order of appending.\n\nTherefore, the final string is:\n\n   (18 '+' at the beginning, but in reverse order of insertion? Actually, no: the insertions at the beginning are in the order of the loop: the first insertion at beginning (i=2) is the leftmost of the beginning pluses? But then when we insert again at the beginning, we push that one to the right. So the beginning part will be:\n\n        insert at i=2: becomes ['+', ...]\n        insert at i=4: becomes ['+', '+', ...] -> the one inserted at i=4 is now at index0, and the one from i=2 is at index1.\n\n   So the beginning part: \n        The pluses are in the order: \n            i=36 (last even) is the first character, then i=34, ... until i=2.\n\n   Similarly, the end part: \n        The pluses are in the order: \n            i=1, i=3, i=5, ... i=35.\n\nBut note: the total number of pluses at the beginning is 18 and at the end is 18.\n\nSo the string is:\n\n   beginning: 18 pluses, but in reverse order of the even indices? Actually, the order of the beginning pluses is from the last inserted (most recent) to the first inserted. So the beginning part is: \n        '+' from i=36, then i=34, ... until i=2.\n\n   But that means the beginning part is: 18 pluses in descending order of the index? \n\n   However, they are all the same character, so it doesn't matter. The beginning part is 18 '+' and the end part is 18 '+'.\n\nTherefore, the string is:\n\n   s = ('+' * 18) + 'Hello Is It MyClass' + ('+' * 18)\n\nBut wait, that would be 18 + 19 + 18 = 55.\n\nBut let me verify with a small example:\n\n   Suppose original text = \"ab\" (length=2)\n   total = (2-1)*2 = 2\n   i=1: append '+' -> becomes ['a','b','+']\n   i=2: insert '+' at beginning -> becomes ['+','a','b','+']\n\n   So the string is \"+ab+\", which is 4 characters.\n\n   But if we do: \n        beginning: 1 plus (from i=2) and end: 1 plus (from i=1) -> so it is '+' + \"ab\" + '+' -> \"+ab+\", which matches.\n\n   So the pattern: \n        The beginning pluses: one for each even i (which is total/2 = 1) and the end pluses: one for each odd i (which is total/2 = 1).\n\n   Therefore, for our case: \n        beginning: 18 pluses, then the original string, then 18 pluses.\n\nSo the string is: \n        s = ('+' * 18) + 'Hello Is It MyClass' + ('+' * 18)\n\nBut note: the example above: the first operation was append (so the end) and then insert at beginning. The order of the beginning pluses is the reverse of the order of insertion? Actually, in the example, we inserted at the beginning for i=2 and then that was the only one. So the beginning plus is the one from i=2. But if we had two:\n\n   original: \"ab\", total = (2-1)*2 = 2 -> but if we do 4 iterations? Actually, the total is 2, so we do 2 iterations.\n\n   Now, if we have 4 iterations? Then total = (len-1)*2 = 2 -> but wait, the problem says for the given string of length 19, total=36. So for a string of length 2, if we set total = (2-1)*2 = 2, then we do 2 iterations.\n\n   But what if we have a string of length 3? \n        total = (3-1)*2 = 4\n        iterations: 1 to 4.\n\n        Start: ['a','b','c']\n        i=1 (odd): append -> ['a','b','c','+'] -> length=4\n        i=2 (even): insert at beginning -> ['+','a','b','c','+'] -> length=5\n        i=3 (odd): append -> ['+','a','b','c','+','+'] -> length=6\n        i=4 (even): insert at beginning -> ['+','+','a','b','c','+','+'] -> length=7\n\n        So the string is \"++abc++\", which is 2 pluses at the beginning and 2 at the end.\n\n   Therefore, the pattern holds: \n        The number of pluses at the beginning = total/2 = 2, and at the end = total/2 = 2.\n\n   And the original string is in the middle.\n\nSo for our case: \n        original string: 'Hello Is It MyClass' (19 characters)\n        total = 36, so 18 pluses at the beginning and 18 at the end.\n\nTherefore, the string after the loop is:\n        s = ('+' * 18) + 'Hello Is It MyClass' + ('+' * 18)\n\nBut then we do: s.rjust(36)\n\nThe string s has length 18 + 19 + 18 = 55. \nThe rjust(36) will create a string of at least 36 characters. Since 55>36, it returns the original string without any change.\n\nSo the result is a string of 55 characters: 18 pluses, then the original string, then 18 pluses.\n\nBut let's write it explicitly:\n\n   s = '++++++++++++++++++Hello Is It MyClass++++++++++++++++++'\n\nNow, we must output this string.\n\nBut note: the problem says to output the result of the function call: f2(f1('Hello Is It MyClass')) which is this string.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n   '++++++++++++++++++Hello Is It MyClass++++++++++++++++++'\n\nBut wait, let me count the pluses: \n   We have 18 at the beginning and 18 at the end. How many is that? \n        18 at the beginning: 18\n        18 at the end: 18\n        total pluses: 36, and the original string is 19 -> 36+19=55.\n\nBut the string: \n        beginning: 18 pluses -> \"++++++++++++++++++\" (exactly 18)\n        then the string: \"Hello Is It MyClass\" (19 characters)\n        then 18 pluses: \"++++++++++++++++++\"\n\nSo the entire string is: \n        \"++++++++++++++++++Hello Is It MyClass++++++++++++++++++\"\n\nWe must enclose it in single quotes.\n\nTherefore, the output for the assert statement is:\n        '++++++++++++++++++Hello Is It MyClass++++++++++++++++++'\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information\", so we just output the string.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the original string: \n        'Hello Is It MyClass' -> \n        H e l l o   I s   I t   M y C l a s s -> \n        H(1), e(2), l(3), l(4), o(5), space(6), I(7), s(8), space(9), I(10), t(11), space(12), M(13), y(14), C(15), l(16), a(17), s(18), s(19) -> 19.\n\nSo the string is correct.\n\nFinal answer: \n        '++++++++++++++++++Hello Is It MyClass++++++++++++++++++'"
