    "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n We are to compute: f2(f1('aphid', 'i', '?'))\n\n First, let's compute f1('aphid', 'i', '?'):\n   f1(s, from_c, to_c) creates a translation table that maps each character in from_c to the corresponding character in to_c.\n   Here, from_c is 'i' and to_c is '?'. So it will map 'i' to '?'.\n\n   The string s is 'aphid'. \n   In 'aphid', the character 'i' is present. So it will be replaced by '?'.\n   Therefore, f1('aphid', 'i', '?') returns 'aph?d'.\n\n Now, we pass this result to f2.\n   f2(string) does: \n        string.title().replace(' ', '')\n   The string is 'aph?d'. \n\n   First, string.title() capitalizes the first character of each word. But note: the string has no spaces, so it's one word.\n   Therefore, the first character 'a' becomes 'A', and the rest remain in lowercase? Actually, the title() method capitalizes the first letter of every word and makes the rest lowercase. However, note that the string is one word: \"aph?d\".\n\n   So: \n        'aph?d'.title() -> 'Aph?d'\n\n   Then, we do replace(' ', '') which removes spaces. There are no spaces, so it remains 'Aph?d'.\n\n Therefore, the result is 'Aph?d'.\n\n But wait: let's test in Python to be sure.\n\n However, note the function f2: \n   It does: string.title().replace(' ', '')\n\n So the output is 'Aph?d'.\n\n But note: the title() method also capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes the rest of the letters in the word lowercase. However, in our string, after replacing, we have:\n   Original: 'aph?d'\n   After title: \n        The first character 'a' becomes 'A'\n        The rest: 'ph?d' becomes 'ph?d' (because they are not the start of a word). \n        But note: the letter 'p' is not at the start so it becomes lowercase? Actually, no: the entire string is one word. The title() method would only capitalize the first letter and then make the rest of the letters in the word lowercase? \n\n However, in the string 'aph?d', the first character is made uppercase and the rest remain as they are? Actually, the title() method does not change the case of non-alphabet characters? And also, it only changes the case of the first letter of each word and the rest to lowercase? \n\n Let me clarify with an example in Python (but since we are not running, we rely on the specification):\n\n   \"hello world\".title() -> \"Hello World\"\n   \"it's a test\".title() -> \"It'S A Test\"   (note: the 'S' is capitalized because the word is \"it's\", and after the apostrophe, it's considered a new word? Actually, that's a known issue. But in our case, we don't have apostrophe.)\n\n   However, our string is 'aph?d'. The '?' is not a letter. So the word is \"aph\" and then \"d\"? Actually, no: the title() method splits by words and words are usually contiguous letters. The non-alphabet character (like '?') does not break the word? Actually, the documentation says: \n        \"The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters.\"\n\n   So in 'aph?d', the word boundaries are: \n        - The first word is \"aph\" (because the next character is non-letter) and then \"d\" is a separate word? \n\n   But note: the definition: consecutive letters. So the string is broken at non-letters. Therefore, the string 'aph?d' has two words: \"aph\" and \"d\".\n\n   Then, title() would capitalize the first letter of each word: \n        \"aph\" becomes \"Aph\"\n        \"d\" becomes \"D\"\n        and the non-letter '?' remains in between.\n\n   So the result of 'aph?d'.title() would be \"Aph?D\".\n\n   Then, we do replace(' ', '') which removes spaces. There are no spaces, so we get \"Aph?D\".\n\n However, let me check with a Python interpreter (if we had one) but the problem says we cannot run. Alternatively, we can reason:\n\n   According to the Python documentation for str.title():\n        \"This method may not work correctly for Unicode; ... The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters. The definition works in many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired result.\"\n\n   Example: \n        >>> 'hello world'.title()\n        'Hello World'\n        >>> \"they're bill's friends\".title()\n        \"They'Re Bill'S Friends\"\n\n   So in our case, the string 'aph?d' has non-letter '?' which breaks the word. Therefore, we have two words: \"aph\" and \"d\". So we get \"Aph?D\".\n\n   Therefore, f2('aph?d') returns \"Aph?D\".\n\n But wait, the function f2 does:\n        return string.title().replace(' ', '')\n\n   There are no spaces to replace, so the result is \"Aph?D\".\n\n However, let's double-check the initial step: \n        f1('aphid', 'i', '?') -> replaces the 'i' in 'aphid' to '?', so we get 'aph?d'. Correct.\n\n   Then f2('aph?d') -> \n        Step 1: 'aph?d'.title() -> breaks into two words: \"aph\" and \"d\", so becomes \"Aph?D\"\n        Step 2: replace spaces: none, so \"Aph?D\"\n\n Therefore, the final result is 'Aph?D'.\n\n But note: the test case: \n        assert f2(f1('aphid', 'i', '?')) == \n\n We are to complete the assert statement with the output.\n\n So the output is 'Aph?D'\n\n However, let me consider: what if the title() method does not break at non-letters? Actually, the documentation says it breaks at non-letters. \n\n Alternatively, we can think of a simpler example: \n        'a b'.title() -> 'A B'\n        'a?b'.title() -> 'A?B'? \n\n But wait, the example in the documentation: \n        \"they're bill's friends\".title() -> \"They'Re Bill'S Friends\"\n\n   Here, the apostrophe is a non-letter and it breaks the word? Actually, the apostrophe is a non-letter and it breaks the word? But note: the apostrophe is in the middle of the word \"they're\", but it breaks into \"they\" and \"re\". Similarly, in our case, the question mark breaks the word.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident: 'aph?d'.title() -> 'Aph?D'\n\n So the answer is 'Aph?D'\n\n But note: the function f2 also removes spaces. However, there are no spaces in 'Aph?D', so it remains.\n\n Therefore, the output is 'Aph?D'\n\n However, let me write the exact string: \n        The first character: 'A' (capital A)\n        then 'p' (lowercase)\n        then 'h' (lowercase)\n        then '?' \n        then 'D' (capital D)\n\n So the string is: 'Aph?D'\n\n We enclose in single quotes as per the instruction.\n\n Final answer: 'Aph?D'"
