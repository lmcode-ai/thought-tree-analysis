The string '0574' has length 4. \n    So, we need to add (9-4)=5 fill characters (z's) in total, divided equally on both sides? \n    But note: if the padding is odd, the extra character goes on the right.\n\n    Actually, the method center(width, fillchar) returns the string centered in a string of length width. \n    Padding is done using the specified fillchar (default is space). \n\n    The formula: \n        total_pad = width - len(text)\n        left_pad = total_pad // 2\n        right_pad = total_pad - left_pad\n\n    So, for our case:\n        total_pad = 5\n        left_pad = 5 // 2 = 2\n        right_pad = 3\n\n    Therefore, the result of f1('0574', 9) is: \n        'zz' + '0574' + 'zzz' = 'zz0574zzz'\n\nStep 2: Compute f2('zz0574zzz')\n\n  We process the string from the last character backwards and collect only alphabetic characters.\n\n  The string: 'zz0574zzz'\n  Let's traverse backwards:\n\n    i = 8: character 'z' -> is alphabetic -> add to result: result becomes 'z'\n    i = 7: character 'z' -> add: result becomes 'zz'\n    i = 6: character 'z' -> add: result becomes 'zzz'\n    i = 5: character '4' -> not alphabetic -> skip\n    i = 4: character '7' -> not alphabetic -> skip\n    i = 3: character '5' -> not alphabetic -> skip\n    i = 2: character '0' -> not alphabetic -> skip\n    i = 1: character 'z' -> alphabetic -> add: result becomes 'zzzz'\n    i = 0: character 'z' -> alphabetic -> add: result becomes 'zzzzz'\n\n  But wait, let's check the indices:\n\n      index 0: 'z'\n      index 1: 'z'\n      index 2: '0'\n      index 3: '5'\n      index 4: '7'\n      index 5: '4'\n      index 6: 'z'\n      index 7: 'z'\n      index 8: 'z'\n\n  So when we traverse backwards:\n\n      i=8 -> 'z' -> result = 'z'\n      i=7 -> 'z' -> result = 'zz'\n      i=6 -> 'z' -> result = 'zzz'\n      i=5 -> '4' -> skip\n      i=4 -> '7' -> skip\n      i=3 -> '5' -> skip\n      i=2 -> '0' -> skip\n      i=1 -> 'z' -> result = 'zzzz'\n      i=0 -> 'z' -> result = 'zzzzz'\n\n  Therefore, f2 returns 'zzzzz'\n\nSo the final output of f2(f1('0574', 9)) is 'zzzzz'\n\nBut note: the function f2 collects the alphabetic characters in reverse order? Actually, it traverses from the last character to the first, and appends each alphabetic character. So the order of the collected characters is the reverse of the original order of the alphabetic characters in the string.\n\nIn the string 'zz0574zzz', the alphabetic characters are at positions 0,1,6,7,8. \n  Original order: z (at0), z (at1), z (at6), z (at7), z (at8)\n  When traversing backwards, we get: z(at8), z(at7), z(at6), then we skip non-alphas, then z(at1), z(at0). \n  So the result is: 'z' (from 8) + 'z' (from7) + 'z' (from6) + 'z' (from1) + 'z' (from0) -> which is \"zzzzz\", but note that the order of the z's is reversed relative to their original positions? \n\nHowever, since all the alphabetic characters are the same (all 'z'), the reversed order of the same character is the same string.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'zzzzz'\n\nBut let me double-check with the code:\n\n  f1('0574',9) returns 'zz0574zzz'\n\n  Then f2('zz0574zzz'):\n\n      result = ''\n      i = 8: c = 'z' -> isalpha -> result = 'z'\n      i = 7: c = 'z' -> result = 'zz'\n      i = 6: c = 'z' -> result = 'zzz'\n      i = 5: '4' -> skip\n      i = 4: '7' -> skip\n      i = 3: '5' -> skip\n      i = 2: '0' -> skip\n      i = 1: 'z' -> result = 'zzzz'\n      i = 0: 'z' -> result = 'zzzzz'\n\n  So the result is 'zzzzz'\n\nThus, the assert statement should be:\n\n  assert f2(f1('0574', 9)) == 'zzzzz'\n\nBut note: the problem says to only return the output without any extra information, and if the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\n\nSo the answer is: 'zzzzz'"
