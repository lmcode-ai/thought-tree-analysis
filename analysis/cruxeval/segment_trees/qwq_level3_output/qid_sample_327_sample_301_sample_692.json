    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out the output of the function composition f3(f2(f1([1, 7, -1, -3]))) and then provide the correct assert statement. Let me start by understanding each function individually and then see how they work together.\n\nFirst, let's look at f1. The function f1 takes a list and processes it. Let me read the code again:\n\ndef f1(lst):\n    new = list()\n    i = len(lst)-1\n    for _ in range(len(lst)):\n        if i%2 == 0:\n            new.append(-lst[i])\n        else:\n            new.append(lst[i])\n        i -= 1\n    return new\n\nSo, f1 starts by initializing a new list. It sets i to the last index of the input list. Then, it loops len(lst) times. In each iteration, it checks if the current index i is even. If it is, it appends the negative of the element at that index to new; otherwise, it appends the element as is. Then, it decreases i by 1. \n\nWait, but since i starts at the last index and decreases each time, the loop is going through the elements from the end to the beginning. However, the loop runs exactly len(lst) times, so i will go from len(lst)-1 down to 0. But each step, the index is checked for evenness. Let me see with the test case [1,7,-1,-3].\n\nLet's compute f1([1,7,-1,-3]):\n\nOriginal list indices are 0:1, 1:7, 2:-1, 3:-3. The length is 4, so i starts at 3 (the last index). The loop runs 4 times.\n\nFirst iteration (i=3):\nCheck if 3 is even? 3%2 is 1, so no. So append lst[3] which is -3. Then i becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration (i=2):\n2 is even. So append -lst[2] which is -(-1) = 1. i becomes 1.\n\nThird iteration (i=1):\n1 is odd. Append lst[1] =7. i becomes 0.\n\nFourth iteration (i=0):\n0 is even. Append -lst[0] = -1. i becomes -1.\n\nSo the new list after f1 is [-3, 1,7, -1]. Wait, let me list the elements in order as they are added:\n\nFirst element added is -3 (from index 3), then 1 (from index 2), then 7 (index1), then -1 (index0). So the new list is [-3,1,7,-1]. Wait, no, the order is the elements are added in the order of the loop steps. Let me list each step's append:\n\nAfter first iteration: new is [-3]\n\nSecond: append 1 \u2192 [-3,1]\n\nThird: append7 \u2192 [-3,1,7]\n\nFourth: append -1 \u2192 [-3,1,7,-1]. So the result of f1 is [-3,1,7,-1].\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The loop runs for each element, starting from the end. The elements are processed in reverse order, but each element's index (original index) is checked for evenness. So the first element added is the last element of the original list (index 3), then index 2, then 1, then 0. So the new list is built in reverse order of the original list, but with some elements negated based on their original index's parity.\n\nOkay, so f1([1,7,-1,-3]) gives [-3,1,7,-1]. Let me note that.\n\nNext, we need to apply f2 to this result. Let's look at f2's code:\n\ndef f2(nums):\n    count = len(nums)\n    for i in range(-count+1, 0):\n        nums.extend([nums[i], nums[i]])\n    return nums\n\nHmm, this function takes a list and modifies it in place. Let me parse this. The variable count is the length of nums. The loop is over i in the range from -count+1 up to 0 (but not including 0). Wait, in Python, range(-count+1, 0) would be from -count+1 to -1, since the end is exclusive. For example, if count is 4 (since after f1, the list is length 4), then -count+1 is -3, so the range is from -3 to -1 (since 0 is excluded). So the indices would be -3, -2, -1? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the range is from start=-count+1 to stop=0. So for count=4, start is -3, stop is 0. The step is 1 by default. So the numbers generated are -3, -2, -1. So three iterations. \n\nWait, but the loop variable i is each of those indices. For each i, we extend nums with [nums[i], nums[i]]. So for each of those indices, we are adding two copies of the element at position i to the end of nums. \n\nBut since nums is being modified in place, this could be tricky. Let me take the example of the input to f2 being the output of f1, which is [-3,1,7,-1].\n\nLet me walk through f2 step by step with this input.\n\nOriginal nums is [-3,1,7,-1]. The count is 4. So the loop runs for i in -3, -2, -1.\n\nFirst iteration, i = -3:\n\nnums[i] is nums[-3] which is the third element from the end. The list is [-3,1,7,-1], so index -3 is 1 (since -1 is last, -2 is 7, -3 is 1, -4 is -3). Wait, let's see:\n\nIndices for the list [-3,1,7,-1]:\n\nIndices 0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3:-1.\n\nNegative indices: -1 is -1 (the last element), -2 is 7, -3 is 1, -4 is -3. So for i=-3, nums[i] is 1. So we extend nums with [1,1]. So after this first iteration, the nums list becomes:\n\nOriginal list: [-3,1,7,-1], then adding [1,1] \u2192 new list is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1].\n\nSecond iteration, i = -2:\n\nNow, the current nums is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1]. The length is now 6. But the loop is still using the original count (4) so the indices are based on the original length. Wait, but in the code, the count is set at the start. So the loop is based on the original length. So for the second iteration, i is -2. Let's see what nums[i] is here.\n\nOriginal count was 4, so the indices in the loop are -3, -2, -1. The current nums after first iteration is length 6, but the i is still -2 (relative to the original length of 4). Wait, no, the indices here are based on the original list's length. Wait, no, the i is an index into the original nums list? Or into the current list?\n\nWait, the code is using the original nums list, but since it's modifying it in place, the indices might refer to the current list. Wait, but the loop is over the indices from -count+1 to 0, where count is the original length. So for the first iteration, when i is -3, that refers to the third element from the end of the original list (since count was 4). But as the list is being extended, the indices for the current list may have changed. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the loop is for i in range(-count+1, 0). The count is the original length of nums. So the indices are based on the original length. So for each i in that range, we are taking the element at position i (relative to the original list's length) and then appending two copies of it to the end of the list. But as the list is being extended, the elements after the original indices are new elements. However, the indices in the loop are fixed based on the original length. So for example, in the first iteration, i is -3 (original length 4 \u2192 -3 is the third element from the end, which is 1). Then, after adding two elements, the list is longer, but the next i is -2 (original length's -2, which was 7). So the next element to process is the second from the end of the original list (7). \n\nWait, but in the second iteration, the current list is now longer, but the i is still based on the original length. So for the second iteration, i is -2 (original length 4 \u2192 index -2 is 7). So we take nums[i] (which is 7) and add two copies of it. So the list becomes [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7].\n\nThird iteration, i is -1 (original length's -1 \u2192 the last element of original list, which is -1). So we take nums[i] (original's last element, which is -1) and add two copies. So now the list becomes [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7, -1, -1].\n\nWait, but let me track each step carefully:\n\nStarting with nums = [-3,1,7,-1], count is 4.\n\nFirst iteration (i = -3):\n\nnums[i] is nums[-3] (original list's third from end, which is 1). So we extend nums with [1,1]. Now the list is:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1]\n\nSecond iteration (i = -2):\n\nOriginal list's -2 is 7. So nums[i] is 7 (even though the current list is longer, the i is based on original length). So we add [7,7]. Now the list becomes:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7]\n\nThird iteration (i = -1):\n\nOriginal list's -1 is -1. So we add [-1, -1]. Now the list becomes:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7, -1, -1]\n\nSo after f2, the result is the list [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. Let me confirm that:\n\nOriginal list length 4. After first iteration (i=-3), added two elements \u2192 length 6. Then second iteration (i=-2) adds two more \u2192 8. Third iteration (i=-1) adds two more \u2192 10 elements. So the final list has 4 + 2*3 = 10 elements. The elements added are:\n\nFirst: 1,1 \u2192 from i=-3 (original element 1)\n\nSecond:7,7 \u2192 from i=-2 (original element 7)\n\nThird: -1,-1 \u2192 from i=-1 (original element -1)\n\nSo the final list after f2 is:\n\nOriginal elements: [-3,1,7,-1], then added [1,1], then [7,7], then [-1,-1]. So concatenated, the list is:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. That's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to f3. The function f3 is defined as:\n\ndef f3(array):\n    a = []\n    array.reverse()\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        if array[i] != 0:\n            a.append(array[i])\n    a.reverse()\n    return a\n\nWait, let's parse this. The function takes an array, reverses it in place (array.reverse()), then loops through each element. If the element is not zero, it appends it to a. Then, it reverses a and returns it.\n\nWait, but the steps are:\n\n1. Reverse the input array in place. So the original array is modified.\n\n2. Iterate over each element in the reversed array (since it's been reversed already). For each element, if it's not zero, add to a.\n\n3. Reverse the list a and return it.\n\nWait, let me think through this step by step with the input from f2, which is the list we just got: [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1].\n\nFirst, array is this list. Then, array.reverse() reverses it in place. So the array becomes:\n\nOriginal list: [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]\n\nAfter reversing, it becomes:\n\n[-1, -1, -7, 7, 1, 1, -1, 7, 1, -3]\n\nWait, wait, let me reverse the list step by step. The original list is:\n\nIndices 0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3:-1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:7, 7:7, 8:-1, 9:-1.\n\nReversing this list would make the elements in reverse order:\n\nThe first element of the reversed array is the last element of the original, which is -1 (index9), then -1 (index8), then 7 (index7), 7 (index6), 1 (index5), 1 (index4), -1 (index3), 7 (index2), 1 (index1), -3 (index0). Wait, let me list them all:\n\nOriginal list elements in order:\n\n-3, 1, 7, -1, 1, 1, 7, 7, -1, -1.\n\nReversed, the elements are:\n\n-1 (last), -1 (9th), then -1 (8th), then 7 (7th), 7 (6th), 1 (5th), 1 (4th), -1 (3rd), 7 (2nd), 1 (1st), -3 (0th). Wait, the reversed list would be:\n\nThe reversed list is [ -1, -1, -1, 7, 7, 1, 1, -1, 7, 1, -3 ]? Wait, no, the original list has 10 elements. Let me count again:\n\nOriginal list has 10 elements. The reversed list will have the same elements in reverse order. Let me list them:\n\nOriginal elements in order (indices 0-9):\n\n0: -3\n\n1:1\n\n2:7\n\n3:-1\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:7\n\n7:7\n\n8:-1\n\n9:-1\n\nReversed list will be elements from index9 to 0:\n\nelement9: -1\n\nelement8: -1\n\nelement7:7\n\nelement6:7\n\nelement5:1\n\nelement4:1\n\nelement3:-1\n\nelement2:7\n\nelement1:1\n\nelement0:-3\n\nSo the reversed array is:\n\n[-1, -1, 7, 7, 1, 1, -1, 7, 1, -3]\n\nWait, let me list them step by step:\n\nAfter reversing, the first element is element9: -1\n\nSecond element is element8: -1\n\nThird is element7:7\n\nFourth: element6:7\n\nFifth: element5:1\n\nSixth: element4:1\n\nSeventh: element3:-1\n\nEighth: element2:7\n\nNinth: element1:1\n\nTenth: element0:-3\n\nSo the reversed array is:\n\n[-1, -1, 7, 7, 1, 1, -1, 7, 1, -3]\n\nNow, the function loops through each element in this reversed array (since array was reversed in place). For each element, if it's not zero, append to a. Then reverse a and return.\n\nSo let's process each element in the reversed array (the array after reverse is now this list):\n\nelements are:\n\nindex0: -1 \u2192 not zero \u2192 add to a.\n\nindex1: -1 \u2192 add.\n\nindex2:7 \u2192 add.\n\nindex3:7 \u2192 add.\n\nindex4:1 \u2192 add.\n\nindex5:1 \u2192 add.\n\nindex6:-1 \u2192 add.\n\nindex7:7 \u2192 add.\n\nindex8:1 \u2192 add.\n\nindex9:-3 \u2192 add.\n\nAll elements except zero are added. Since none of them are zero, the list a will be the same as the reversed array. So a is:\n\n[-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]\n\nThen, the function reverses a and returns it. So reversing a gives:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal a is [-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]\n\nReversing this list would give:\n\n-3 (last element of a), then 1 (second last), then 7, then 1, then -1, then 7, then 7, then 1, then -1, then -1.\n\nWait, let me list the reversed a:\n\nThe first element of reversed a is the last element of a, which is -3.\n\nThen next elements are the previous elements in reverse:\n\na's elements in order:\n\n0: -1\n\n1: -1\n\n2:7\n\n3:7\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:-1\n\n7:7\n\n8:1\n\n9:-3\n\nReversing a gives:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,7,1,7, -1, -1, -1]\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\nThe reversed a would be:\n\nStart from the end of a (index9) to start (index0):\n\nelement9: -3 \u2192 first in reversed a.\n\nelement8:1 \u2192 second.\n\nelement7:7 \u2192 third.\n\nelement6:-1 \u2192 fourth.\n\nelement5:1 \u2192 fifth.\n\nelement4:1 \u2192 sixth.\n\nelement3:7 \u2192 seventh.\n\nelement2:7 \u2192 eighth.\n\nelement1:-1 \u2192 ninth.\n\nelement0:-1 \u2192 tenth.\n\nSo the reversed a is:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]\n\nWait, let me list them in order:\n\nAfter reversing a (which was the list [-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]), the reversed a is:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]\n\nWait, that's exactly the same as the original list after f2 before applying f3. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because f3's process is:\n\nAfter reversing the input array (the f2 output), then collecting non-zero elements (all are non-zero here), then reversing again. So the result is the original array (before reversing in f3) but with non-zero elements kept, then reversed again. Wait, but since all elements are non-zero, the a is the reversed array, then reversed again gives the original array before reversing. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the steps are:\n\nOriginal array (input to f3) is the output of f2, which is the list L = [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1].\n\nThen, array.reverse() reverses L in place, so array becomes L_reversed = [ -1, -1, -1, 7, 7, 1, 1, -1, 7, 1, -3 ]? Wait, no, earlier calculation showed that the reversed array is [-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]. Wait, the original list had 10 elements, so reversed array has 10 elements. Let me recount:\n\nOriginal f2 output has 10 elements. So reversed array is 10 elements. Then, when we loop through each element, all are non-zero, so a is the same as the reversed array. Then, reversing a gives the original array before reversing. So the result of f3 is the original array (the f2 output) because reversing and then reversing again brings it back. Wait, but that can't be, because the process is:\n\narray is reversed, then a is built from the reversed array's elements (all non-zero), then a is reversed again. So the result is the original array (before reversing) but with elements in the same order? Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the original array (input to f3) is X. Then:\n\nAfter reversing X in place, it becomes X_reversed.\n\nThen, a is a list of all elements in X_reversed (since none are zero). So a = X_reversed.\n\nThen, a is reversed, so the result is X_reversed reversed \u2192 which is X again. So f3(X) would return X if all elements are non-zero. \n\nWait, that's exactly what's happening here. Since all elements in the f2 output are non-zero, f3 would return the original array (the f2 output) because reversing and then reversing again cancels out. Wait, but in the code, the array is reversed first, then a is built from the reversed array, then a is reversed again. So the steps are:\n\nOriginal array (input to f3): L.\n\nAfter reverse: L becomes L_reversed.\n\nThen, a is L_reversed (since all elements are non-zero).\n\nThen, a is reversed \u2192 L_reversed reversed is L again. So the output of f3 is L.\n\nWait, that's correct. So f3(f2(f1(...))) would return the same as f2's output, because all elements are non-zero. \n\nWait, but in the example, the f2 output is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. So f3 would return that same list? Because after reversing and then reversing again, it's the same as original. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with the example. Let me retrace:\n\nThe input to f3 is the f2 output: L = [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1].\n\nAfter reversing L in place, it becomes L_reversed = [-1, -1, -1,7,7,1,1, -1,7,1, -3]? Wait, no, the length is 10 elements. Let me list L again:\n\nOriginal L (f2 output):\n\nIndices 0 to 9:\n\n0: -3\n\n1:1\n\n2:7\n\n3:-1\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:7\n\n7:7\n\n8:-1\n\n9:-1\n\nReversing this gives:\n\nelement9: -1 \u2192 new index0\n\nelement8: -1 \u2192 new index1\n\nelement7:7 \u2192 new index2\n\nelement6:7 \u2192 new index3\n\nelement5:1 \u2192 new index4\n\nelement4:1 \u2192 new index5\n\nelement3:-1 \u2192 new index6\n\nelement2:7 \u2192 new index7\n\nelement1:1 \u2192 new index8\n\nelement0:-3 \u2192 new index9\n\nSo L_reversed is:\n\n[-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]\n\nThen, a is built by taking all elements (since none are zero), so a is exactly L_reversed. Then, reversing a gives the original L. So the output of f3 is L. \n\nTherefore, f3(f2(f1([1,7,-1,-3]))) is equal to the f2 output, which is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1].\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem says to return the output of the function composition. Wait, but according to this, f3 returns the same as f2's output. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the code for f3 is:\n\ndef f3(array):\n    a = []\n    array.reverse()  # reverses in place\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        if array[i] != 0:\n            a.append(array[i])\n    a.reverse()\n    return a\n\nWait, after reversing array in place, the array is now L_reversed. Then, the for loop goes through each element of array (now L_reversed) and appends to a if not zero. Since all elements are non-zero, a is exactly L_reversed. Then, a is reversed, so the result is L_reversed reversed \u2192 which is the original L. So yes, the output of f3 is L, which is the f2 output. \n\nTherefore, the final result of the composition is the list produced by f2, which is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me retrace all steps once more to be sure.\n\nStarting with [1,7,-1,-3].\n\nf1 processes it to [-3,1,7,-1].\n\nThen f2 takes that and appends duplicates of the last three elements (based on original indices). The f2 output is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1].\n\nThen f3 takes that list, reverses it in place to become [-1,-1,-1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3] (wait, no, the length is 10, so reversed list is 10 elements. Wait, let me recheck:\n\nOriginal f2 output is 10 elements. So reversed array is 10 elements. The reversed array is:\n\n[-1 (from index9), -1 (index8), -1 (index7?), wait no, original indices for f2's output:\n\nWait, the f2 output is:\n\nOriginal elements after f1: [-3,1,7,-1], then adding 1,1 (from i=-3), then 7,7 (i=-2), then -1,-1 (i=-1). So the full list is:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. So indices 0-9.\n\nReversing this gives:\n\nelement9: -1 \u2192 new index0\n\nelement8: -1 \u2192 new index1\n\nelement7:7 \u2192 new index2\n\nelement6:7 \u2192 new index3\n\nelement5:1 \u2192 new index4\n\nelement4:1 \u2192 new index5\n\nelement3:-1 \u2192 new index6\n\nelement2:7 \u2192 new index7\n\nelement1:1 \u2192 new index8\n\nelement0:-3 \u2192 new index9\n\nSo reversed array is:\n\n[-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]\n\nThen, a is this list (since all elements are non-zero). Then, reversing a gives the original list before reversing (the f2 output). So the result of f3 is the original f2 output. \n\nTherefore, the final output is the list [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1].\n\nWait, but the problem says to return the output of the function composition f3(f2(f1(...))) as the assert's right-hand side. So the correct answer is that list. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the steps. Let me recheck f2 again. \n\nOriginal f1 output is [-3,1,7,-1]. Then f2's code:\n\ncount = 4. The loop runs for i in -3, -2, -1.\n\nFirst iteration (i=-3):\n\nnums[i] is nums[-3] \u2192 which in the original list (before any extensions) is index 1 (since original list length is 4, so -3 is index 1 (since 0-based: -1 is 3, -2 is 2, -3 is 1, -4 is 0). Wait, original list is [-3,1,7,-1]. So index -3 is 1 (element at index1 is 1). So yes, first iteration adds [1,1], making the list [-3,1,7,-1,1,1].\n\nSecond iteration (i=-2): original list's -2 is index 2 (element7). So adding [7,7], making the list [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7].\n\nThird iteration (i=-1): original list's -1 is index3 (element-1). Adding [-1,-1], so the list becomes [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. That's correct.\n\nSo f2's output is correct. Then f3 returns that list. \n\nTherefore, the final output is the list [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. \n\nWait, but the problem says to output the result of f3(f2(f1(...))) which is exactly this list. So the assert statement should have this list as the right-hand side. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any mistake in the f3 function. Let me re-examine the code for f3 again:\n\ndef f3(array):\n    a = []\n    array.reverse()  # reverses in place\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        if array[i] != 0:\n            a.append(array[i])\n    a.reverse()\n    return a\n\nYes, so after reversing array (the input to f3 is the f2 output), then building a from the reversed array's elements (all non-zero), then reversing a gives the original array (the f2 output). So the output is indeed the f2 output. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is the list [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the f3's reverse steps. Let me take the f2 output as L = [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1].\n\nAfter reversing L in place, it becomes L_reversed = [-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3].\n\nThen, a is built as [ -1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3 ] (since all elements are non-zero). Then, reversing a gives [ -3,1,7,-1,1,1,-1,7,7,-1,-1 ]? Wait, no, the reversed a would be the reverse of L_reversed. \n\nWait, L_reversed is the reversed list of L. So reversing L_reversed gives back L. So a is L_reversed, then reversed gives L. \n\nYes, so the output of f3 is L, which is the f2 output. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is the list produced by f2, which is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]. \n\nSo the assert statement should have this list as the right-hand side. \n\nWait, but let me check once more for any possible mistake. Let me re-calculate f3 step by step with the f2 output.\n\nInput to f3: L = [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]\n\nStep 1: array.reverse() \u2192 array becomes [-1, -1, -1,7,7,1,1, -1,7,1, -3]? Wait, no, the length is 10 elements. Let me list the reversed array correctly:\n\nOriginal L elements:\n\nIndices 0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3:-1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:7, 7:7, 8:-1, 9:-1.\n\nReversed array (after array.reverse()):\n\nelement9 \u2192 new index0: -1\n\nelement8 \u2192 new index1: -1\n\nelement7 \u2192 new index2:7\n\nelement6 \u2192 new index3:7\n\nelement5 \u2192 new index4:1\n\nelement4 \u2192 new index5:1\n\nelement3 \u2192 new index6:-1\n\nelement2 \u2192 new index7:7\n\nelement1 \u2192 new index8:1\n\nelement0 \u2192 new index9:-3\n\nSo the reversed array is:\n\n[-1, -1,7,7,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]\n\nThen, a is built by iterating over this reversed array. All elements are non-zero, so a is exactly this list. \n\nThen, a.reverse() \u2192 the reversed a is:\n\n[-3,1,7,-1,1,1,7,7,-1,-1]\n\nWhich is exactly the original L. \n\nTherefore, the final output is indeed L, so the assert should be:\n\nassert f3(f2(f1([1, 7, -1, -3]))) == [-3, 1, 7, -1, 1, 1, 7, 7, -1, -1]\n\nSo the correct output is the list as written above."
