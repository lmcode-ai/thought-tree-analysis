    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out what the output of the function composition f3(f2(f1('mjs', 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'))) is, and then provide the correct assert statement's expected value. Let me break down each function and see how they work together.\n\nFirst, let's look at the functions one by one. The user provided three functions: f1, f2, and f3. But wait, each of them is named 'f', which might be a typo. Oh right, the user probably meant that each function is defined as f in different code blocks (f1, f2, f3). So each function is actually named f, but they are separate. So when the problem says f3(f2(f1(...))), that means first apply f1, then pass its result to f2, then pass that result to f3, and check the final output.\n\nLet me start with f1. The first function f1 takes two parameters: prefix and text. Its job is to check if the text starts with the prefix. If it does, it returns the text as is. If not, it prepends the prefix to the text. So for example, if prefix is 'a' and text is 'apple', it would return 'apple' because it starts with 'a'. But if text was 'banana', it would return 'abanana'.\n\nThe test case here is f1('mjs', 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'). Let's see: the prefix is 'mjs', and the text is 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'. Does the text start with 'mjs'? Let's check the first three characters. The text starts with 'mjq'... so the first three letters are 'm', 'j', 'q', which is 'mjq', not 'mjs'. Therefore, since it doesn't start with the prefix, f1 will return the prefix + text. So the result of f1 here would be 'mjs' + 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' = 'mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'.\n\nWait, let me confirm that again. The text is 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'. The first three characters are 'm', 'j', 'q', so 'mjq', which is not 'mjs', so yes, the function appends the prefix. So the output of f1 is 'mjs' followed by the original text. So the combined string is 'mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'.\n\nNext, this result is passed to f2. The second function f2 takes a string s, converts it into a list of characters (after stripping whitespace, but the input here probably doesn't have any?), reverses the list, and then joins them back into a string. Wait, the code for f2 is:\n\ndef f(s):\n    arr = list(s.strip())\n    arr.reverse()\n    return ''.join(arr)\n\nSo first, s.strip() removes any leading/trailing whitespace. Since the input from f1 is a string that doesn't have any spaces (assuming the original text didn't have any), so stripping won't change it. Then, converting to a list, reversing the list, and joining. So f2 reverses the entire string.\n\nSo taking the output of f1, which was 'mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso', reversing it. Let's see: the original string is \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\". Let me write it out:\n\nOriginal string after f1: \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\"\n\nReversing this would give the characters in reverse order. Let's see, the last character is 'o', then 's', 'i', 'w', 'j', 'q', 'o', 's', 'i', 'o', 'w', 'j', 'q', 'j', 'm', 's', 'w', 'q', 'j', 'm', 's', 'j', 'm'... Wait, maybe I should just note that the reversed string is the original string written backwards. So the result of f2 is the reversed version of the f1's output.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's take the string from f1: \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\". Let me count the length to see how long it is, but maybe it's easier to just reverse it step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the reversed string will be the reverse of the entire string. Let me try to write it out:\n\nOriginal string: m j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nWait, perhaps I should just take the entire string and reverse it. Let me see:\n\nThe original string after f1 is 'mjs' + 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2192 so the full string is 'mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'. Let me write it as a sequence of characters:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nOriginal string after f1:\n\nm j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nWait, perhaps I can just reverse the entire string. Let me see the exact characters. Let me count the length. Let's see:\n\nThe original text given to f1 is 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'. Let's count the characters here:\n\n'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2192 let's see:\n\nm (1), j (2), q (3), w (4), m (5), j (6), s (7), q (8), j (9), w (10), i (11), s (12), o (13), j (14), q (15), w (16), i (17), s (18), o (19). So that's 19 characters. Then adding the prefix 'mjs' (3 characters) gives a total of 22 characters. So the reversed string will be 22 characters long, with the last character of the original becoming the first, etc.\n\nBut perhaps I can just note that the reversed string is the original string reversed. Let me think of the entire string as S, then f2(S) is S reversed.\n\nSo after f2, the result is the reversed string of the f1's output.\n\nThen, this reversed string is passed to f3. Let's look at f3's code:\n\ndef f(text):\n    valid_chars = ['-', '_', '+', '.', '/', ' ']\n    text = text.upper()\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalnum() == False and char not in valid_chars:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nSo f3 checks if all characters in the text are either alphanumeric (letters or numbers) or in the valid_chars list. It converts the text to uppercase first. If any character is neither alphanumeric nor in valid_chars, returns False; else returns True.\n\nSo the question is: after reversing the string from f2, what is the resulting string, and does it pass f3's check?\n\nWait, but first, let's compute the exact string after f2.\n\nLet me try to compute the reversed string step by step.\n\nOriginal string after f1: 'mjs' + 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2192 let's write the entire string:\n\nOriginal text after f1 is:\n\nm j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the entire string as:\n\n\"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\"\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nThe original text given to f1 is 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso', which starts with 'mjq', so f1 adds 'mjs' in front, making the new string 'mjs' + 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2192 so the full string is 'mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso'.\n\nWait, let me count the letters again. Let me write the original text as 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2192 that's 19 characters. Adding 'mjs' (3) gives 22. Let me see:\n\nBreaking down the f1's output:\n\nThe first three characters are 'm','j','s', then the rest is the original text. So the full string is:\n\nm j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the entire string as:\n\n\"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\"\n\nNow, reversing this string would give the characters in reverse order. Let's reverse each character:\n\nThe last character of the original is the last 'o' (position 22). The reversed string starts with 'o', then the previous character is 's', then 'i', 'w', 'j', 'q', 'o', 'j', 's', 'i', 'w', 'j', 'q', 'm', 's', 'j', 'w', 'q', 's', 'j', 'm', 'w', 'q', 'jm'... Wait, perhaps I should write the reversed string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the reversed string is the original string reversed. Let me try to write it:\n\nOriginal string: m j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nReversed would be o s i w j q o j s i w j q s j m w q j m s j w q j m s j m\n\nWait, maybe I should take the entire string and reverse it. Let me write the original string as a list of characters and reverse them.\n\nLet me take the string \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\".\n\nBreaking it down character by character:\n\nIndices 0-21 (since length is 22):\n\n0: m\n\n1: j\n\n2: s\n\n3: m\n\n4: j\n\n5: q\n\n6: w\n\n7: m\n\n8: j\n\n9: s\n\n10: q\n\n11: j\n\n12: w\n\n13: i\n\n14: s\n\n15: o\n\n16: j\n\n17: q\n\n18: w\n\n19: i\n\n20: s\n\n21: o\n\nSo reversing this, the reversed string would be the characters from 21 down to 0:\n\n21: o \u2192 first character of reversed string.\n\n20: s \u2192 second.\n\n19: i \u2192 third.\n\n18: w \u2192 fourth.\n\n17: q \u2192 fifth.\n\n16: j \u2192 sixth.\n\n15: o \u2192 seventh.\n\n14: s \u2192 eighth.\n\n13: i \u2192 ninth.\n\n12: w \u2192 tenth.\n\n11: j \u2192 eleventh.\n\n10: q \u2192 twelfth.\n\n9: s \u2192 thirteenth.\n\n8: j \u2192 fourteenth.\n\n7: m \u2192 fifteenth.\n\n6: w \u2192 sixteenth.\n\n5: q \u2192 seventeenth.\n\n4: j \u2192 eighteenth.\n\n3: m \u2192 nineteenth.\n\n2: s \u2192 twentieth.\n\n1: j \u2192 twenty-first.\n\n0: m \u2192 twenty-second.\n\nSo putting them all together, the reversed string is:\n\no s i w q j o s i w j s m w q j m s j m j s m j s m ?\n\nWait, let me list them step by step:\n\nReversed string characters:\n\nPosition 0 (original 21): o\n\n1 (20): s\n\n2 (19): i\n\n3 (18): w\n\n4 (17): q\n\n5 (16): j\n\n6 (15): o\n\n7 (14): s\n\n8 (13): i\n\n9 (12): w\n\n10 (11): j\n\n11 (10): q\n\n12 (9): s\n\n13 (8): j\n\n14 (7): m\n\n15 (6): w\n\n16 (5): q\n\n17 (4): j\n\n18 (3): m\n\n19 (2): s\n\n20 (1): j\n\n21 (0): m\n\nSo the reversed string is:\n\no s i w q j o s i w j s m w q j m s j m j s m j s ?\n\nWait, let me write them all in order:\n\no, s, i, w, q, j, o, s, i, w, j, q, s, j, m, w, q, j, m, s, j, m\n\nWait, let me count again. Let me list each character step by step:\n\n1. o (from 21)\n\n2. s (20)\n\n3. i (19)\n\n4. w (18)\n\n5. q (17)\n\n6. j (16)\n\n7. o (15)\n\n8. s (14)\n\n9. i (13)\n\n10. w (12)\n\n11. j (11)\n\n12. q (10)\n\n13. s (9)\n\n14. j (8)\n\n15. m (7)\n\n16. w (6)\n\n17. q (5)\n\n18. j (4)\n\n19. m (3)\n\n20. s (2)\n\n21. j (1)\n\n22. m (0)\n\nWait, the indices go from 21 down to 0, so the reversed string is:\n\no s i w q j o s i w j q s j m w q j m s j m\n\nWait, let me write all the characters in order:\n\no, s, i, w, q, j, o, s, i, w, j, q, s, j, m, w, q, j, m, s, j, m\n\nWait, that's 22 characters. Let me check the count:\n\n1. o\n\n2. s \u2192 2\n\n3. i \u21923\n\n4. w \u21924\n\n5. q \u21925\n\n6. j \u21926\n\n7. o \u21927\n\n8. s \u21928\n\n9. i \u21929\n\n10. w \u219210\n\n11. j \u219211\n\n12. q \u219212\n\n13. s \u219213\n\n14. j \u219214\n\n15. m \u219215\n\n16. w \u219216\n\n17. q \u219217\n\n18. j \u219218\n\n19. m \u219219\n\n20. s \u219220\n\n21. j \u219221\n\n22. m \u219222? Wait, no, indices 0-21, so 22 characters. The last character is m (position 0 of original, which is the first character of the original string). So the reversed string is:\n\n\"osiwqj o s i w j q s j m w q j m s j m\" \u2014 but I need to write it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just write the reversed string as the original string reversed. Let me take the original string after f1:\n\nOriginal string after f1 is \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\".\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nm j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nReversing this gives the characters in reverse order. Let me write the reversed string as:\n\no s i w j q o j s i w j q s j m w q j m s j m\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a simpler approach. Let me take the original string and reverse it using code in my mind. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\"\n\nReversed would be \"osijwqojqsiwjmsqjmwsmjm\".\n\nWait, maybe I can just reverse it step by step:\n\nOriginal: m j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nReversed: o s i w j q i w j s q j m w q j s m j s m j m ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me try to write the reversed string properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that the reversed string is the original string reversed. Let me think of the original as \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\".\n\nLet me write it as a string and reverse it:\n\nOriginal: \"mjsmjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso\"\n\nReversed: \"osijwqojqsiwjmsqjmwsmjm\"\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nTake the original string:\n\nm j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\nThe first part after 'mjs' is 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso', so the full string is 'mjs' + that. Let me see:\n\nBreaking down the entire string:\n\nm j s m j q w m j s q j w i s o j q w i s o\n\nReversing each character:\n\nThe last character is 'o', then 's', 'i', 'w', 'j', 'q', 'o', 'j', 's', 'i', 'w', 'j', 'q', 'm', 's', 'j', 'w', 'q', 's', 'j', 'm', 'w', 'q', 'j', 'm', 's', 'j', 'm'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should just accept that the reversed string is the original string reversed. Let me proceed.\n\nNow, the next step is to pass this reversed string to f3. Let's see what f3 does.\n\nf3 converts the text to uppercase, then checks each character. If any character is not alphanumeric and not in the valid_chars list (which includes '-', '_', '+', '.', '/', ' '), then returns False. Otherwise, returns True.\n\nSo first, the reversed string (from f2) is passed to f3. Let's see if all characters in that reversed string are either alphanumeric or in the valid_chars.\n\nThe valid characters are: '-', '_', '+', '.', '/', ' '.\n\nSo, the reversed string's characters must all be letters (uppercase or lowercase, but since f3 converts to uppercase, case doesn't matter), numbers, or one of those symbols.\n\nLooking at the reversed string, let's see if any characters are invalid.\n\nWait, the original string after f1 is made up of letters (lowercase) and possibly other characters? Let me check the original input to f1: the text given is 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2014 all lowercase letters, no numbers or symbols. So the f1's output is also all lowercase letters. Then f2 reverses it, so the reversed string is still all lowercase letters. Then f3 converts it to uppercase, but the check is on the characters regardless of case (since it's converted to uppercase first, but the original characters are lowercase letters, so uppercase letters are allowed).\n\nWait, the valid_chars are the symbols, but letters (after uppercase conversion) are allowed because they are alphanumeric. So the only possible invalid characters would be if there were any characters that are neither letters, numbers, nor in the valid_chars list. Since the original string is all lowercase letters, after reversing and converting to uppercase, all characters are uppercase letters, which are alphanumeric. Therefore, all characters are valid, so f3 should return True.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The original text given to f1 is 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2014 all letters, so after f1, the result is also letters. Then f2 reverses it, so still letters. Then f3 converts to uppercase, but letters are allowed. So all characters are alphanumeric, so the function returns True.\n\nTherefore, the final result of f3(f2(f1(...))) is True. Therefore, the assert statement should have 'True' as the expected value.\n\nWait, but let me double-check for any possible mistakes. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal text to f1: 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2014 all lowercase letters. The prefix is 'mjs', so the result of f1 is 'mjs' + 'mjqwmjsqjwisojqwiso' \u2192 all letters. Then f2 reverses it, so still letters. Then f3 checks each character: after converting to uppercase, they are uppercase letters, which are alphanumeric. So all are valid. So f3 returns True. Therefore, the assert should be True.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output the result of the function composition, which is the return value of f3. Since f3 returns a boolean, the output is True, so the assert statement's value is True. The user says to output the result without any other info, and if it's a string, enclose in single quotes. Since it's a boolean, just output True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is True."
