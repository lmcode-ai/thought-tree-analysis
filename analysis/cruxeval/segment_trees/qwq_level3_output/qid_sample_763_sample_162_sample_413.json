    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out the output of the composed functions f1, f2, and f3 when applied in sequence to the given test case. The final result should be what's asserted in the assert statement. Let me break it down function by function.\n\nFirst, let's look at f1. The function f1 is defined as def f(values, text, markers): return text.rstrip(values).rstrip(markers). Wait, but in the test case, the call is f1('2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', ''). So the parameters are values='2Pn', text='yCxpg2C2Pny2', markers is an empty string. \n\nThe function does a rstrip on text with values first, then another rstrip with markers. The rstrip method removes trailing characters from the string. The first rstrip uses the characters in '2Pn' to remove from the end. Let me see the original text: 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'. Let's see the end of this string. The last character is '2', which is part of the values. So the first rstrip with '2Pn' would remove all trailing characters that are in '2Pn' from the end. Let's process that step by step.\n\nOriginal text: 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'\n\nFirst, rstrip with values='2Pn'. The trailing characters to remove are any of '2', 'P', 'n'. Let's look at the end of the string. The last character is '2', so that's part of the values. So we need to remove all trailing characters until a character not in '2Pn' is found. Let's see:\n\nThe string ends with 'y2'. The '2' is part of the values, so we remove that. Now the string ends with 'y', which is not in '2Pn', so the first rstrip would result in 'yCxpg2C2Pny' (since the last '2' is stripped). Wait, but maybe there's more? Let me check again. The original string is 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'. Let's write it out:\n\nBreaking down the string: the characters are:\n\ny C x p g 2 C 2 P n y 2\n\nSo the last character is 2. After stripping that, the next character is y. But y is not in the values (values are '2', 'P', 'n'). So the first rstrip with '2Pn' would remove the trailing 2, resulting in 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.\n\nWait, but maybe there are more characters to strip. Let me think again. The rstrip removes all trailing characters that are in the given set. So starting from the end, it removes all characters until it hits a character not in the set. Let's go step by step:\n\nOriginal string: 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'\n\nTrailing characters:\n\n- The last character is '2' (part of the set), so remove it. Now the string is 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.\n\n- The new last character is 'y', which is not in the set (since the set is '2', 'P', 'n'). So the first rstrip stops here. So after first rstrip, the result is 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.\n\nThen, the second rstrip is with markers, which is an empty string. Rstripping with an empty string does nothing, because it's equivalent to stripping whitespace, but since markers is empty, maybe it's the same as just rstrip(). Wait, no: the parameters for rstrip are optional. If you pass an empty string, it's supposed to remove trailing whitespace. But in this case, since markers is an empty string, the second rstrip is text.rstrip(). So after the first rstrip, the string is 'yCxpg2C2Pny', and then we do rstrip() (without any arguments), which removes trailing whitespace. But the string doesn't have any trailing whitespace. So the final result of f1 is 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm. The first rstrip is with '2Pn', so the characters to remove are '2', 'P', 'n'. The original string ends with 'y2', so after removing the '2', the next character is 'y', which is not in the set, so the first rstrip stops there. So yes, the first rstrip gives 'yCxpg2C2Pny', then the second rstrip with markers (empty string) would do nothing. So f1 returns 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.\n\nNow, moving on to f2. The function f2 takes the output of f1, which is 'yCxpg2C2Pny', and processes it. The function f2 is defined as:\n\ndef f(text):\n    result = ''\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalnum():\n            result += char.upper()\n    return result\n\nSo f2 takes each character in the input string, checks if it's alphanumeric (letters or numbers), and if so, appends its uppercase version to the result. Non-alnum characters are skipped.\n\nLet's process the string 'yCxpg2C2Pny' character by character.\n\nBreaking down the input string for f2:\n\nCharacters in order:\n\ny (lowercase letter) \u2192 yes \u2192 Y\n\nC (uppercase) \u2192 yes \u2192 C\n\nx (lowercase) \u2192 yes \u2192 X\n\np (lowercase) \u2192 yes \u2192 P\n\ng (lowercase) \u2192 yes \u2192 G\n\n2 (number) \u2192 yes \u2192 2 (but upper() on a number is same as the number)\n\nC \u2192 yes \u2192 C\n\n2 \u2192 yes \u2192 2\n\nP \u2192 yes \u2192 P\n\nn \u2192 lowercase \u2192 N\n\ny \u2192 yes \u2192 Y\n\nWait, let me list all characters step by step:\n\nOriginal string after f1: 'yCxpg2C2Pny'\n\nBreaking down each character:\n\n1. 'y' \u2192 isalnum() is True \u2192 add 'Y'\n\n2. 'C' \u2192 True \u2192 'C'\n\n3. 'x' \u2192 True \u2192 'X'\n\n4. 'p' \u2192 True \u2192 'P'\n\n5. 'g' \u2192 True \u2192 'G'\n\n6. '2' \u2192 True \u2192 '2'\n\n7. 'C' \u2192 True \u2192 'C'\n\n8. '2' \u2192 True \u2192 '2'\n\n9. 'P' \u2192 True \u2192 'P'\n\n10. 'n' \u2192 True \u2192 'N'\n\n11. 'y' \u2192 True \u2192 'Y'\n\nWait, but how many characters are there? Let me count the original string after f1: 'yCxpg2C2Pny' has 11 characters? Let me check:\n\nBreaking down the string 'yCxpg2C2Pny':\n\ny (1), C (2), x (3), p (4), g (5), 2 (6), C (7), 2 (8), P (9), n (10), y (11). Yes, 11 characters. All of them are alphanumeric except maybe any symbols? Let's see:\n\nAll characters except maybe the '2's are letters. The '2's are numbers. So all are alnum. So the result of f2 is the uppercase version of each character, so the string becomes \"YCXPG2C2PNY\".\n\nWait, let me write each character's uppercase:\n\nOriginal characters and their uppercase:\n\ny \u2192 Y\n\nC \u2192 C\n\nx \u2192 X\n\np \u2192 P\n\ng \u2192 G\n\n2 \u2192 2 (since uppercase of a digit is same)\n\nC \u2192 C\n\n2 \u2192 2\n\nP \u2192 P\n\nn \u2192 N\n\ny \u2192 Y\n\nSo combining all, the result is \"YCXPG2C2PNY\".\n\nSo f2 returns \"YCXPG2C2PNY\".\n\nNow, moving to f3. The function f3 is defined as def f(s): return '{}{}{}'.format(s[3:], s[2], s[5:8]).\n\nWe need to apply f3 to the result of f2, which is \"YCXPG2C2PNY\".\n\nLet me note the string s = \"YCXPG2C2PNY\".\n\nFirst, let's index the characters. Let's list each character with their indices (0-based):\n\n0: Y\n\n1: C\n\n2: X\n\n3: P\n\n4: G\n\n5: 2\n\n6: C\n\n7: 2\n\n8: P\n\n9: N\n\n10: Y\n\nSo the length is 11 characters (indices 0-10).\n\nNow, let's compute each part of the format string:\n\nThe format is '{}{}{}'.format(s[3:], s[2], s[5:8])\n\nBreaking down each part:\n\nFirst part: s[3:] \u2192 from index 3 to end. s[3] is 'P', so s[3:] is \"PG2C2PNY\".\n\nSecond part: s[2] \u2192 the character at index 2 is 'X'.\n\nThird part: s[5:8] \u2192 from index 5 up to but not including 8. So indices 5,6,7. The characters are '2', 'C', '2'. So s[5:8] is \"2C2\".\n\nPutting it all together in the format:\n\nFirst {} is s[3:] \u2192 \"PG2C2PNY\"\n\nSecond {} is s[2] \u2192 \"X\"\n\nThird {} is s[5:8] \u2192 \"2C2\"\n\nSo the final string is \"PG2C2PNY\" + \"X\" + \"2C2\" \u2192 Wait, no, the format is the three parts concatenated. Wait, the format is:\n\nThe first part is s[3:], which is \"PG2C2PNY\"\n\nThe second part is s[2], which is 'X'\n\nThe third part is s[5:8], which is \"2C2\"\n\nSo the combined string is \"PG2C2PNY\" + \"X\" + \"2C2\" \u2192 let's concatenate them:\n\nPG2C2PNYX2C2\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nThe first part is s[3:] \u2192 starting at index 3: \"PG2C2PNY\"\n\nSecond part is s[2] \u2192 'X'\n\nThird part is s[5:8] \u2192 from index 5 (inclusive) to 8 (exclusive). So indices 5,6,7: characters at 5 is '2', 6 is 'C', 7 is '2', so \"2C2\".\n\nSo putting them together: \"PG2C2PNY\" + \"X\" + \"2C2\" \u2192 \"PG2C2PNYX2C2\".\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the indices. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal s is \"YCXPG2C2PNY\".\n\nBreaking down the indices again:\n\n0: Y\n\n1: C\n\n2: X\n\n3: P\n\n4: G\n\n5: 2\n\n6: C\n\n7: 2\n\n8: P\n\n9: N\n\n10: Y\n\nSo s[3:] is from index 3 (P) to the end: indices 3 to 10 \u2192 \"PG2C2PNY\".\n\ns[2] is index 2 \u2192 X.\n\ns[5:8] is from 5 (inclusive) to 8 (exclusive). So indices 5,6,7 \u2192 characters '2', 'C', '2' \u2192 \"2C2\".\n\nSo the three parts are:\n\nFirst part: \"PG2C2PNY\"\n\nSecond part: \"X\"\n\nThird part: \"2C2\"\n\nCombined: \"PG2C2PNYX2C2\".\n\nTherefore, the final result of f3 is \"PG2C2PNYX2C2\".\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait, the third part is s[5:8], which is from 5 to 8 (exclusive). So 5,6,7. The characters at 5 is '2', 6 is 'C', 7 is '2', so \"2C2\".\n\nSo the final string is indeed \"PG2C2PNYX2C2\".\n\nTherefore, the assert statement should check that f3(f2(f1(...))) equals this string. Since the problem says to output the result of the function (the right-hand side of the assert), the correct output is 'PG2C2PNYX2C2'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps again to be sure.\n\nStarting with f1:\n\nOriginal input to f1 is '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', and markers is empty string.\n\nThe text is 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'. The first rstrip is with values='2Pn'. The trailing characters to remove are any of '2', 'P', 'n'.\n\nThe original string ends with 'y2', so the last character is '2', which is in the set. So we remove that, resulting in 'yCxpg2C2Pny' (the '2' at the end is stripped). The next character is 'y', which is not in the set, so we stop. Then, the second rstrip with markers (empty string) is rstrip(), which removes trailing whitespace. Since there's none, the result is 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.\n\nThen f2 processes this string. All characters are alphanumeric, so converting to uppercase gives \"YCXPG2C2PNY\".\n\nThen f3 takes that string. Let's confirm the indices again for \"YCXPG2C2PNY\":\n\nIndices 0-10:\n\n0: Y\n\n1: C\n\n2: X\n\n3: P\n\n4: G\n\n5: 2\n\n6: C\n\n7: 2\n\n8: P\n\n9: N\n\n10: Y\n\nSo s[3:] is from index 3 (P) to end: \"PG2C2PNY\".\n\ns[2] is X.\n\ns[5:8] is indices 5 (2),6 (C),7 (2) \u2192 \"2C2\".\n\nSo combining gives \"PG2C2PNY\" + \"X\" + \"2C2\" \u2192 \"PG2C2PNYX2C2\".\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final output is that string, which should be enclosed in single quotes as per the problem's instruction."
