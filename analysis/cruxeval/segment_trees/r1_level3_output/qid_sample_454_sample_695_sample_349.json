(not executed)\n      return new_dict   # which is {}\n\n   So f1 returns an empty dictionary: {}\n\n Step 2: Compute f2({})\n\n   f2(d) does:\n      result = {}\n      for ki, li in d.items():   # d is {}, so the loop runs 0 times -> skipped\n          ... return result   # which is {}\n\n   So f2 returns an empty dictionary: {}\n\n Step 3: Compute f3({})\n\n   f3(dictionary) does:\n      dictionary[1049] = 55   # so now dictionary becomes {1049: 55}\n      key, value = dictionary.popitem()   # pops the only item: (1049, 55)\n      dictionary[key] = value   # then sets dictionary[1049] = 55 again -> so dictionary becomes {1049: 55} Therefore, f3 returns {1049: 55}\n\n So the final output is {1049: 55} However, note that the behavior of popitem in Python for a dictionary is not guaranteed to be in a particular order? But note: in the function f3, we are adding one key (1049) and then popping the only item. So it will always pop (1049,55) and then we put it back.
