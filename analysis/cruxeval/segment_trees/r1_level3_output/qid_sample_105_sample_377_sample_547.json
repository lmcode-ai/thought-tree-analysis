Since there are none, we get [text]\n\n   Therefore, f2 returns the same string? \n\n   But wait: what if there are multiple lines? The function is designed to split by lines and then join with comma and space.\n\n   In this case: \n        f2(\"Permission Is Granted\") returns \"Permission Is Granted\"\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the result of f2, i.e., f3(\"Permission Is Granted\")\n   f3(letters) does:\n        letters_only = letters.strip(\"., !?*\")\n        return \"....\".join(letters_only.split(\" \"))\n\n   First, strip the string from both ends of the characters in the set: '.', ',', ' ', '!', '?', '*'\n   The string is \"Permission Is Granted\"\n\n   Let's strip: \n        The string has no leading or trailing occurrences of these? \n        It starts with 'P' and ends with 'd', which are not in the set. So stripping does nothing.\n\n   Then, we split the string by space: \n        \"Permission Is Granted\".split(\" \") -> ['Permission', 'Is', 'Granted']\n\n   Then join with \"....\": \n        \"Permission....Is....Granted\"\n\n Therefore, the final result is: \"Permission....Is....Granted\"\n\n But note: the problem says to enclose the string in single quotes.\n\n So the answer is: 'Permission....Is....Granted'\n\n However, let's double-check the entire chain:\n\n   f1(\"PermissioN is GRANTed\") -> \"Permission Is Granted\"\n   f2(\"Permission Is Granted\") -> \"Permission Is Granted\"   (because no newlines)\n   f3(\"Permission Is Granted\") -> \n        strip: \"Permission Is Granted\" (unchanged)\n        split: ['Permission', 'Is', 'Granted']\n        join: \"Permission....Is....Granted\"\n\n Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n   assert f3(f2(f1(\"PermissioN is GRANTed\"))) == 'Permission....Is....Granted'\n\n But note: the problem says to only return the output without the assert statement and without any extra information.\n\n So we output: 'Permission....Is....Granted'"
