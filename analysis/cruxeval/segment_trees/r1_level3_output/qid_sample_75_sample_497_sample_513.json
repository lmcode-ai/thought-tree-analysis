    "original_reasoning": "We are given three functions: f1, f2, f3 (which are named f in their respective definitions, but we'll refer to them as f1, f2, f3 for clarity).\n\n We are to compute:\n   f3(f2(f1([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)))\n\n Step 1: Compute f1([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)\n\n   Function f1(array, elem):\n     ind = array.index(elem)   -> finds the first index of `elem` in `array`\n\n   In the array: [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], we are looking for 2.\n   The first occurrence of 2 is at index 1 (0-indexed).\n\n   Then:\n     return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3\n\n   ind = 1\n   So:\n     ind * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2\n     -ind - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2\n     array[-2] is the second last element: the array is [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] -> \n        indices: 0: -1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:-8, 4:2\n        negative indices: -1:2, -2:-8, -3:1, -4:2, -5:-1\n\n     So array[-2] is -8.\n\n     Then: 2 + (-8)*3 = 2 - 24 = -22.\n\n   Therefore, f1 returns -22.\n\n Step 2: Compute f2(-22)\n\n   Function f2(n):\n     b = list(str(n))   -> converts the number to a string and then to a list of characters.\n\n     For n = -22:\n        str(-22) is the string '-22'\n        list('-22') -> ['-', '2', '2']\n\n     Then:\n        for i in range(2, len(b)):\n          b[i] += '+'\n\n     The length of b is 3 (indices 0,1,2). The loop runs for i from 2 to len(b)-1 (since range(2,3) -> only 2).\n\n        i=2: b[2] is '2', then we do b[2] += '+' -> so b[2] becomes '2+'\n\n     So b becomes: ['-', '2', '2+']\n\n   Therefore, f2 returns ['-', '2', '2+']\n\n Step 3: Compute f3(['-', '2', '2+'])\n\n   Function f3(array):\n     while -1 in array: ...   -> but note: our array contains strings: '-', '2', '2+'. There is no integer -1, so skip.\n     while 0 in array: ...    -> no 0, skip.\n     while 1 in array: ...    -> no 1, skip.\n\n     So we return the array as is: ['-', '2', '2+']\n\n However, note that the function f3 is defined to remove elements based on the presence of integers -1, 0, 1. \n But our array does not contain any of these integers. It contains strings.\n\n Therefore, the output is ['-', '2', '2+'].\n\n But wait: let's look at the function f3:\n\n   def f3(array):\n     while -1 in array:\n         array.pop(-3)\n     while 0 in array:\n         array.pop()\n     while 1 in array:\n         array.pop(0)\n     return array\n\n The condition checks for the integer -1, 0, 1. Since our array has no integers, none of the while loops run.\n\n So the final result is the list: ['-', '2', '2+'].\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" \n But the output is a list of strings. We must output the list exactly.\n\n But note: the assert statement expects a value. We are to output the result of f3(f2(f1(...))).\n\n Therefore, the output is: ['-', '2', '2+']\n\n However, let me double-check the functions:\n\n   f1: \n      array = [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], elem=2 -> first index of 2 is 1.\n      Then: array[-ind-1] = array[-2] -> which is the element at index -2: that is the third from the end? \n            Actually, negative indices: \n                index 0: -1\n                index 1: 2\n                index 2: 1\n                index 3: -8\n                index 4: 2\n            So index -1 is 2 (last), index -2 is -8 (second last), index -3 is 1, etc.\n\n      So array[-2] is -8 -> then 1*2 + (-8)*3 = 2 -24 = -22 -> correct.\n\n   f2: \n        n = -22 -> list of characters: ['-','2','2'] -> then for i in range(2,3): i=2 -> change the last element to '2+' -> ['-','2','2+'] -> correct.\n\n   f3: \n        array = ['-','2','2+'] -> no integer -1, 0, or 1 -> so returns the same.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the list: ['-', '2', '2+'].\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we output: ['-', '2', '2+']\n\n However, note that the function f3 might be intended for integer arrays? But the code does not do type checking. \n The condition `while -1 in array` will check for the integer -1. Since the array has the string '-' and not the integer -1, it is safe.\n\n But wait: what if the string '-' is interpreted? No, because the list is: \n   [ '-', '2', '2+' ] \n and these are strings. The integer -1 is not the same as the string '-'.\n\n Therefore, the output is: ['-', '2', '2+']"
