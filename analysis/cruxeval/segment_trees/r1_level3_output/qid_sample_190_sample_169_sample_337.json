    "original_reasoning": "We are given three functions: f1, f2, f3.\n We need to compute: f3(f2(f1('980jio80jic kld094398IIl ')))\n\n Step 1: Compute f1('980jio80jic kld094398IIl ')\n   f1(text) returns a string of all lowercase letters in the text.\n   The input: '980jio80jic kld094398IIl '\n   Let's extract the lowercase letters:\n        'jio' (from the first part) and 'jic' (then space, then 'kld' and then 'l' at the end) \n        and note that the last part has 'II' which are uppercase and then 'l' (lowercase).\n   So, we break down:\n        '980jio80jic kld094398IIl '\n        Lowercase letters: \n          j, i, o, j, i, c, k, l, d, l\n        But note: the space is not lowercase, and the uppercase 'II' are skipped.\n        Also, the last character is a space, so skip.\n\n   Therefore, f1 returns: 'jiojickldl'\n\n Step 2: Compute f2 on the result of f1, i.e., f2('jiojickldl')\n   f2(text) does:\n        ls = list(text)   -> ['j','i','o','j','i','c','k','l','d','l']\n        total = (len(text) - 1) * 2\n            len(text) = 10 -> total = (10-1)*2 = 18\n\n        Then, for i in range(1, total+1) which is from 1 to 18:\n            if i is odd (i % 2 is True, meaning non-zero -> odd) then append '+' at the end.\n            else (even) then insert '+' at the beginning (index 0).\n\n        So, we are going to add 18 characters: 9 times at the end and 9 times at the beginning? \n        Actually, note: \n          For i=1 (odd) -> append '+' -> now the list becomes: [original] + ['+'] \n          For i=2 (even) -> insert '+' at the beginning -> ['+'] + [current list]\n          For i=3: append -> so at the end\n          For i=4: insert at beginning\n\n        Therefore, we are going to have 9 '+' at the beginning and 9 '+' at the end? \n        But note: the insertions at the beginning will shift the original list.\n\n        Let's do step by step for the first few:\n\n        Start: ls = ['j','i','o','j','i','c','k','l','d','l'] (length=10)\n\n        i=1 (odd): append -> ls becomes: ['j','i','o','j','i','c','k','l','d','l','+'] (length=11)\n        i=2 (even): insert at beginning -> ['+', 'j','i','o','j','i','c','k','l','d','l','+'] (length=12)\n        i=3 (odd): append -> ... then becomes: ['+', 'j','i','o','j','i','c','k','l','d','l','+', '+'] (length=13)\n        i=4 (even): insert at beginning -> ['+', '+', 'j','i','o','j','i','c','k','l','d','l','+', '+'] (length=14)\n\n        We see that after 18 steps, we will have 9 pluses at the beginning and 9 pluses at the end.\n\n        So the list becomes: \n          [9 times '+'] + ['j','i','o','j','i','c','k','l','d','l'] + [9 times '+']\n\n        Then, we return: ''.join(ls).rjust(total)\n\n        total is 18. But note: the current string has length = 10 (original) + 18 (pluses) = 28.\n        The rjust(total) would add spaces to the left to make the string length = total (which is 18) if the current length is less than 18? \n        But 28 is greater than 18, so rjust(18) won't add any spaces. It will just return the string of length 28.\n\n        Therefore, the result of f2 is a string of 28 characters: \n          '+++++++++jiojickldl+++++++++'\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the above string: f3('+++++++++jiojickldl+++++++++')\n   f3(txt) does:\n        d = []\n        for c in txt:\n            if c.isdigit(): skip (continue)\n            if c.islower(): then append c.upper()\n            elif c.isupper(): then append c.lower()\n\n        Note: the string is: '+++++++++jiojickldl+++++++++'\n\n        The '+' is not a digit, not a letter -> so it will be skipped? \n        Actually, the code only appends when it's a letter (either lower or upper). \n        The non-letters (like '+') are ignored.\n\n        So we only consider the letters: 'jiojickldl' (which are all lowercase).\n\n        For each of these letters (which are lowercase), we convert to uppercase.\n\n        Therefore, we get: 'JIOJICKLDL'\n\n        But note: the original string has 10 letters. So the result is a string of 10 uppercase letters.\n\n   Therefore, f3 returns: 'JIOJICKLDL'\n\n However, let's double-check the functions:\n\n   f1: indeed, we extracted the lowercase letters: \n        '980jio80jic kld094398IIl ' -> \n          j (at index 3), i(4), o(5), j(8), i(9), c(10), then space (skip), then k(12), l(13), d(14), then more digits, then I (uppercase, skip), I (skip), then l (lowercase at the end) -> so we have: j,i,o,j,i,c,k,l,d,l -> 10 letters.\n\n   f2: we built a string that has 9 pluses at the front, then the 10 letters, then 9 pluses at the end -> total 28.\n\n   f3: we take only the letters and flip the case. Since they are all lowercase, we convert to uppercase -> 10 uppercase letters.\n\n   So the final result is: 'JIOJICKLDL'\n\n But wait, the function f3 also has a condition for uppercase: if it's uppercase, it converts to lowercase. However, in our string, there are no uppercase letters until we convert the lowercase ones to uppercase? Actually, in the input to f3, the letters are lowercase. So we convert each to uppercase.\n\n   Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n        assert f3(f2(f1('980jio80jic kld094398IIl '))) == 'JIOJICKLDL'\n\n However, note the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n   So we just output: 'JIOJICKLDL'\n\n But let me check the function f2 again: the return statement is: return ''.join(ls).rjust(total)\n\n   total is 18. The string we built is 28 characters long. The rjust(18) will not add any spaces because the string is already longer than 18. So it returns the 28-character string.\n\n   Then f3 only picks the letters (the 10 lowercase ones) and converts them to uppercase.\n\n   So the result is indeed 10 uppercase letters.\n\n However, note the test case: the input to f1 has a space and digits, but we extracted the lowercase letters correctly.\n\n   Let me write the input: '980jio80jic kld094398IIl '\n   Breaking down:\n        '980jio80jic' -> the letters: j (index3), i(4), o(5), then j(8), i(9), c(10)\n        then space (index11) -> skip\n        then 'kld' -> k(12), l(13), d(14)\n        then '094398IIl ' -> the next letter is at the end: l (index20) because after the two I's (uppercase) and then a lowercase l and then a space.\n\n   So the extracted string by f1 is: 'j'+'i'+'o'+'j'+'i'+'c'+'k'+'l'+'d'+'l' -> \"jiojickldl\"\n\n   So the result is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the output is: 'JIOJICKLDL'"
