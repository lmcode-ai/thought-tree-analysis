Therefore, the loop does not insert any character into new_text.\n   Since new_text is empty, we set new_text = ['-'] and return '-'.\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the result of f2, i.e., f3('-')\n   The function f3 is defined as:\n        def f(body):\n            ls = list(body)\n            dist = 0\n            for i in range(0, len(ls) - 1):\n                if ls[i - 2 if i - 2 >= 0 else 0] == '\\t':\n                    dist += (1 + ls[i - 1].count('\\t')) * 3\n                ls[i] = '[' + ls[i] + ']'\n            return ''.join(ls).expandtabs(4 + dist)\n\n   The input body is the string '-', so:\n        ls = list('-') -> ['-']\n\n   The loop runs for i in range(0, len(ls)-1) = range(0, 0) -> no iterations because 0 to -1 (exclusive) is empty.\n\n   Therefore, the loop does nothing.\n\n   Then we return ''.join(ls).expandtabs(4 + dist) -> ''.join(['-']) is '-', and then we call expandtabs on it.\n\n   The expandtabs method replaces tab characters ('\\t') with spaces.
