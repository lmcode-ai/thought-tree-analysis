The title() method: \n          \"sydyui\" becomes \"Sydyui\" because the first letter is made uppercase and the rest are made lowercase? Actually, the title() method for a single word is equivalent to capitalize? \n          However, note: the title() method for a string without spaces: \n          Example: \"hello\".title() -> \"Hello\"\n          So \"sydyui\".title() -> \"Sydyui\" (because the first letter is capitalized and the rest are in lower case? but what about the 'y'? It's not the first letter so it becomes lower? \n          But wait: the original string is \"sydyui\", so the first letter is 's' -> becomes 'S', and the rest: 'ydyui' becomes 'ydyui'? but note that the rest are already lower? \n          So it becomes \"Sydyui\".\n\n        Then we remove spaces: no change -> \"Sydyui\"\n\n   Step3: f3(\"Sydyui\") -> reverse: \n        Start from the last character: \n          'i' -> then 'u' -> then 'y' -> then 'd' -> then 'y' -> then 'S'\n        So \"iuyydS\"\n\n Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n   assert f3(f2(f1('sduyai', 1, 'y'))) == 'iuyydS'\n\n But note: the problem says to output the string without the assert statement and without any extra information.\n\n So the output we are to return is: 'iuyydS'\n\n However, let me check with the actual code:\n\n   f1('sduyai', 1, 'y') -> \n        text = 'sduyai'\n        position = 1, value = 'y'\n        length = 6\n        index = 1 % 6 = 1\n        new_text = list('sduyai') -> ['s','d','u','y','a','i']\n        insert at index1: ['s','y','d','u','y','a','i'] -> now length 7\n        pop at index (length-1) = 5 -> removes the element at index5 which is 'a'\n        then we have: ['s','y','d','u','y','i'] -> \"sydyui\"\n\n   f2('sydyui') -> \n        'sydyui'.title() -> 'Sydyui' (because the first letter is capitalized and the rest are in lower? but note: the rest are already in lower? \n        Actually, the title() method: \n          \"sydyui\".title() -> \n          According to Python: \n            >>> \"sydyui\".title()\n            'Sydyui'\n        Then replace spaces: no change -> 'Sydyui'\n\n   f3('Sydyui') -> \n        We reverse: \n          for i in range(5, -1, -1): \n            i=5 -> 'i'\n            i=4 -> 'u'\n            i=3 -> 'y'\n            i=2 -> 'd'\n            i=1 -> 'y'\n            i=0 -> 'S'\n        So we get 'iuyydS'\n\n Therefore, the output is 'iuyydS'"
