But note: the method `istitle()` returns True only if the string is titlecased, meaning the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase. So:\n            'SOME'.istitle() -> False (because it's all uppercase, not just the first letter and then lowercase)\n            'OF'.istitle() -> False\n            'THIS'.istitle() -> False\n            'Is'.istitle() -> True (because 'I' is uppercase and 's' is lowercase)\n            'uknowN!'.istitle() -> False (first letter is lowercase)\n\n     - Therefore, the sum is 1.
