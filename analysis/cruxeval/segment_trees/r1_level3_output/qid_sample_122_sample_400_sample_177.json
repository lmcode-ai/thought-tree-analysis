It removes trailing whitespace. There is no trailing whitespace, so it returns the same string: 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'\n\n Step 2: Compute f2 on the result of f1, i.e., f2('Nuva?dlfuyjys')\n   f2(multi_string):\n     cond_string = map(str.isascii, multi_string.split())   -> split the string by spaces and check each word for being ASCII\n     if True in cond_string: \n         return ', '.join(x for x in multi_string.split() if x.isascii())\n     else: return ''\n\n   Let's split 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'.

The string contains only letters and a '?' which are in ASCII -> True.\n\n   Therefore, we return: ', '.join(x for x in ['Nuva?dlfuyjys'] if x.isascii()) -> which is just 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the result of f2, i.e., f3('Nuva?dlfuyjys')\n   f3(text):\n     text = list(text)   -> convert the string into a list of characters\n     for i in range(len(text)):\n         if i % 2 == 1:   -> for odd indices (0-indexed: index 1, 3, 5, ...)\n             text[i] = text[i].swapcase()\n\n     Then return ''.join(text)\n\n   Let's break down the string: 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'\n   Index: \n      0: 'N' -> even -> remains 'N'\n      1: 'u' -> odd -> swapcase: becomes 'U'\n      2: 'v' -> even -> remains 'v'\n      3: 'a' -> odd -> swapcase: becomes 'A'\n      4: '?' -> even -> remains '?'\n      5: 'd' -> odd -> becomes 'D'\n      6: 'l' -> even -> remains 'l'\n      7: 'f' -> odd -> becomes 'F'\n      8: 'u' -> even -> remains 'u'\n      9: 'y' -> odd -> becomes 'Y'\n      10: 'j' -> even -> remains 'j'\n      11: 'y' -> odd -> becomes 'Y'\n      12: 's' -> even -> remains 's'\n\n   So the transformed string is: \n        index0: 'N'\n        index1: 'U'\n        index2: 'v'\n        index3: 'A'\n        index4: '?'\n        index5: 'D'\n        index6: 'l'\n        index7: 'F'\n        index8: 'u'\n        index9: 'Y'\n        index10: 'j'\n        index11: 'Y'\n        index12: 's'\n\n   Result: 'Nv?lujys' becomes 'NUvA?DlFuYjYs'?

Let me count: \n        'Nuva?dlfuyjys' -> 13 characters.\n\n But wait, the example in the problem is: 'Nuva?dlfuyjys' -> 13 characters? \n        N u v a ? d l f u y j y s -> 13.\n\n However, in the transformation, we have:\n        index0: N -> 0 % 2 = 0 -> keep\n        index1: u -> 1 % 2 = 1 -> swap to 'U'\n        index2: v -> 2 % 2 = 0 -> keep\n        index3: a -> 3 % 2 = 1 -> swap to 'A'\n        index4: ? -> 4 % 2 = 0 -> keep\n        index5: d -> 5 % 2 = 1 -> swap to 'D'\n        index6: l -> 6 % 2 = 0 -> keep\n        index7: f -> 7 % 2 = 1 -> swap to 'F'\n        index8: u -> 8 % 2 = 0 -> keep\n        index9: y -> 9 % 2 = 1 -> swap to 'Y'\n        index10: j -> 10 % 2 = 0 -> keep\n        index11: y -> 11 % 2 = 1 -> swap to 'Y'\n        index12: s -> 12 % 2 = 0 -> keep\n\n So the result is: N + U + v + A + ? + D + l + F + u + Y + j + Y + s = \"NUvA?DlFuYjYs\"\n\n But note: the example output we are building is: f3(f2(f1('Nuva?dlfuyjys'))) = \"NUvA?DlFuYjYs\"\n\n However, let me double-check the functions:\n\n   f1: returns the string without change? because there's no trailing space -> correct.\n\n   f2: the string is one word and it is ASCII -> returns the same string -> correct.\n\n   f3: does the transformation as above.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is 'NUvA?DlFuYjYs'\n\n But wait, the example string is: 'Nuva?dlfuyjys' -> note that the first letter is uppercase 'N' and the rest are lowercase? \n   Actually: \n        'N' -> uppercase\n        'u' -> lowercase -> becomes 'U'\n        'v' -> lowercase -> remains\n        'a' -> lowercase -> becomes 'A'\n        '?' -> remains\n        'd' -> lowercase -> becomes 'D'\n        'l' -> lowercase -> remains\n        'f' -> lowercase -> becomes 'F'\n        'u' -> lowercase -> remains (because index8 is even) -> wait, index8 is even so remains as 'u' (lowercase)\n        'y' -> lowercase -> becomes 'Y'\n        'j' -> lowercase -> remains\n        'y' -> lowercase -> becomes 'Y'\n        's' -> lowercase -> remains\n\n So the result is: \n   N (unchanged) -> 'N'\n   u -> 'U'\n   v -> 'v'\n   a -> 'A'\n   ? -> '?'\n   d -> 'D'\n   l -> 'l'\n   f -> 'F'\n   u -> 'u'   (because index8 is even, so no swap -> remains lowercase)\n   y -> 'Y'\n   j -> 'j'\n   y -> 'Y'\n   s -> 's'\n\n So the string is: \"NUvA?DlFuYjYs\"\n\n However, note that the original string has 13 characters. The transformed string is 13 characters.\n\n But wait, the example in the problem: \n        The function f3 is defined to change the case at odd indices (i % 2 == 1). \n        The swapcase for a lowercase letter makes it uppercase, and for an uppercase letter makes it lowercase.\n\n        In our string, the first character is uppercase 'N'. At index0 (even) we leave it. \n        At index1: 'u' (lowercase) becomes 'U'. \n        At index3: 'a' (lowercase) becomes 'A'. \n        At index5: 'd' (lowercase) becomes 'D'. \n        At index7: 'f' (lowercase) becomes 'F'. \n        At index9: 'y' (lowercase) becomes 'Y'. \n        At index11: 'y' (lowercase) becomes 'Y'. \n\n        The rest (even indices) are left as they are: \n          index0: 'N' (uppercase) -> remains uppercase -> correct.\n          index2: 'v' (lowercase) -> remains -> correct.\n          index4: '?' -> non-alphabet -> remains -> correct.\n          index6: 'l' (lowercase) -> remains -> correct.\n          index8: 'u' (lowercase) -> remains -> correct.\n          index10: 'j' (lowercase) -> remains -> correct.\n          index12: 's' (lowercase) -> remains -> correct.\n\n Therefore, the output is: \"NUvA?DlFuYjYs\"\n\n However, note that the example string is: 'Nuva?dlfuyjys' \n   and after f1 and f2 we have the same string, and then f3 transforms it.\n\n But wait, the function f3 is applied to the string without any change? \n\n Let me write the string: \n   Original: 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'\n   After f3: \n        index0: 'N' -> remains 'N'\n        index1: 'u' -> becomes 'U'\n        index2: 'v' -> remains 'v'\n        index3: 'a' -> becomes 'A'\n        index4: '?' -> remains '?'\n        index5: 'd' -> becomes 'D'\n        index6: 'l' -> remains 'l'\n        index7: 'f' -> becomes 'F'\n        index8: 'u' -> remains 'u'\n        index9: 'y' -> becomes 'Y'\n        index10: 'j' -> remains 'j'\n        index11: 'y' -> becomes 'Y'\n        index12: 's' -> remains 's'\n\n So the string becomes: \"N\" + \"U\" + \"v\" + \"A\" + \"?\" + \"D\" + \"l\" + \"F\" + \"u\" + \"Y\" + \"j\" + \"Y\" + \"s\" \n   -> \"NUvA?DlFuYjYs\"\n\n Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n   assert f3(f2(f1('Nuva?dlfuyjys'))) == 'NUvA?DlFuYjYs'\n\n But note: the problem says to output the string without any extra information and enclose in single quotes.\n\n So the answer is: 'NUvA?DlFuYjYs'"
