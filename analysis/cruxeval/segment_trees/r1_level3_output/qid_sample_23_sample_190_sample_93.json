So the trailing characters to remove are only the last two digits: '2' and then another '2'? \n   However, note that the string has a space after the word \"application\" and then a dash and then \"XQuery 2.2\". \n\n   Actually, the string: \n        'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\n   The trailing part: \"2.2\" -> the last two are digits? The last character is '2', which is in the set. Then the one before is '.' -> not in the set -> so we remove only the last '2'. \n   Then we have: ... '2.' -> now the last character is '.' -> not in the set -> stop. So we remove one '2' at the end.\n\n   But wait, let me check the entire string: \n        The string: \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2\"\n        After removing trailing characters in '0123456789-', we remove as many as possible from the end.\n\n        The end of the string: \n            ... '2' -> remove? yes -> then we have: ... '2.' -> now the last character is '.' -> not in the set -> stop.\n\n        So the string becomes: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n   However, note that there is a space after the word \"application\" and then a dash and then \"XQuery 2.2\". \n   But the rstrip only removes from the very end. So we are only removing the last character if it is in the set? \n\n   Actually, let me break down the string:\n\n        The original string: \n          'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\n        The trailing part: \n          The last character: '2' -> remove -> then we have: ... '2.' -> now the last character is '.' -> not in the set -> stop.\n\n        So we get: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n   But wait, what about the dash? There is a dash in the set. However, note that the dash is not at the very end? \n   The string after removing the last '2' ends with '.', so the dash that is in the middle is not affected.\n\n   However, let me test with a simpler example in mind: \n        \"abc123-\".rstrip(\"0123456789-\") -> becomes \"abc\", because it removes all the trailing digits and dashes.\n\n   But in our case, the string does not end with a dash? It ends with a digit. So we remove the trailing digits until we hit a non-digit (or non-chars) which is the dot.\n\n   Therefore, after f1: \n        text = 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n   However, note that the string has a space at the end? Actually, after the dot? No, because we removed the last '2', so the dot is the last character? \n   But the original string: ... '2.2' -> becomes ... '2.' -> so the last character is now '.'.\n\n   But wait, the original string: \n        'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n        The last two characters are '2' and then the one before is '.' and then '2' again? Actually, the string ends with \"2.2\", so the last three characters are: \n          ... '2', '.', '2' -> and we remove the last two? \n\n   Correction: rstrip removes all the characters in the set from the end until it hits a character not in the set. \n        So starting from the end: \n          - last char: '2' -> remove -> now the string ends with '2.' (but note: the last character of the remaining string is now the dot from \"2.\") \n          - then the next last character is '.' -> not in the set -> stop.\n\n        So we only remove one '2'. \n\n   Therefore, the result of f1 is: \n        'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n   However, note that the string also has a space at the end? Actually, the original string: \n        ... 'XQuery 2.2' -> becomes ... 'XQuery 2.' -> so there is a space between 'XQuery' and '2.'? \n\n   The original string: \n        'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n        We are removing only the last character? So the string becomes: \n        'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.' \n\n   But wait, what about the dash in the set? There is a dash in the middle? The rstrip only removes from the end. The dash in the middle is not at the end, so it remains.\n\n   So f1 returns: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n Step 2: Apply f2 to the result of f1.\n\n   f2: \n        def f(text):\n            short = ''\n            for c in text:\n                if(c.islower()):\n                    short += c\n            return short\n\n   This function collects all the lowercase letters in the string and returns them.\n\n   The string: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.' \n\n   Let's break it down:\n\n        'n' -> lowercase -> add\n        'e' -> lowercase -> add\n        'w' -> lowercase -> add\n        '-' -> not lowercase -> skip\n        'm' -> lowercase -> add\n        'e' -> lowercase -> add\n        'd' -> lowercase -> add\n        'i' -> lowercase -> add\n        'u' -> lowercase -> add\n        'm' -> lowercase -> add\n        '-' -> skip\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We note that the string has:\n        \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\n   The uppercase letters: \n        We see 'X' and 'Q' in \"XQuery\" -> these are uppercase -> skip.\n\n   Also, the spaces and the dash and the dot and the digits are skipped.\n\n   So we are going to get all the lowercase letters in order.\n\n   The string without the non-lowercase letters:\n\n        \"new\" -> all lowercase -> becomes \"new\"\n        then dash -> skip\n        \"medium\" -> becomes \"medium\"\n        then dash -> skip\n        \"performing\" -> becomes \"performing\"\n        then dash -> skip\n        \"application\" -> becomes \"application\"\n        then space, dash, space -> skip\n        \"XQuery\" -> only the lowercase letters: 'u','e','r','y' -> but note: \n            'X' -> uppercase -> skip\n            'Q' -> uppercase -> skip\n            then 'u' -> lowercase -> add\n            'e' -> lowercase -> add\n            'r' -> lowercase -> add\n            'y' -> lowercase -> add -> so we get \"uery\"\n        then space and \"2.\" -> skip.\n\n   Therefore, the result of f2 is: \n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\"\n\n   But wait, the function f2 does not add any separators. It just concatenates the lowercase letters. So we get:\n\n        newmediumperformingapplicationuery\n\n   However, note that the original string has the word \"new\" and then \"medium\", etc. without any breaks. \n\n   So the string is: \n        \"new\" + \"medium\" + \"performing\" + \"application\" + \"uery\"\n\n   That is: \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\"\n\n Step 3: Apply f3 to the string \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\"\n\n   f3:\n        def f(n):   # here n is the string we just got\n            length = len(n) + 2\n            revn = list(n)\n            result = ''.join(revn)\n            revn.clear()\n            return result + ('!' * length)\n\n   Let's break down f3:\n\n        Step 3.1: length = len(n) + 2\n            The length of n: \n                n = \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\"\n                Let's count: \n                  \"new\" -> 3\n                  \"medium\" -> 6\n                  \"performing\" -> 10\n                  \"application\" -> 11\n                  \"uery\" -> 4\n                Total = 3+6+10+11+4 = 34\n                So length = 34 + 2 = 36\n\n        Step 3.2: revn = list(n)\n            This creates a list of characters from the string n.\n\n        Step 3.3: result = ''.join(revn)\n            This joins the list revn back into a string. Since we didn't reverse the list, this is the same as the original string n.\n\n        Step 3.4: revn.clear() -> this clears the list, but we don't use revn again.\n\n        Step 3.5: return result + ('!' * length)\n            So we return the string n (which is \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\") plus 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   Therefore, the result is:\n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\" + 36 times '!'\n\n   How many exclamation marks? 36.\n\n   So the final string is: \n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\n   But note: the function f3 is defined as f in the code for f3, and we are calling f3 with the output of f2.\n\n   Therefore, the output of the entire expression is: \n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\" + ('!' * 36)\n\n   However, let me double-check the length of the string in f2:\n\n        The string from f2: \n          \"new\" -> 3\n          \"medium\" -> 6 -> total 9\n          \"performing\" -> 10 -> total 19\n          \"application\" -> 11 -> total 30\n          \"uery\" -> 4 -> total 34\n\n        So 34 + 2 = 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   So the final string is: \n        \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\" + 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   But note: the function f3 does not change the string (it converts to list and back, so it remains the same) and then appends 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   Therefore, the result is: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery' + '!'*36\n\n   We write it as: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'\n\n   However, we must count the exclamation marks: 36.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write without counting, but we know it's 36.\n\n   But the problem says: only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\n\n   And if the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\n\n   So we output: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'\n\n   But note: the original string in f1 had a space after the word \"application\" and then a dash and then \"XQuery\", and we extracted the lowercase letters including the \"uery\" from \"XQuery\". \n\n   However, let me check the original string again: \n        'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\n   The word \"XQuery\": \n        X -> uppercase -> skip\n        Q -> uppercase -> skip\n        u -> lowercase -> included\n        e -> lowercase -> included\n        r -> lowercase -> included\n        y -> lowercase -> included\n\n   So we get \"uery\", which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is the string above.\n\n   However, note that the function f1 might have removed more than we thought? Let me reexamine f1.\n\n   The original string: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n   We are doing rstrip with '0123456789-'. \n\n   The end of the string: \n        ... '2.2' -> the last character is '2' (in the set) -> remove -> now the string is ... '2.' -> then the last character is '.' (not in the set) -> stop.\n\n   So we get: ... '2.' -> so the string becomes: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'\n\n   But note: there is a space at the end? Actually, the original string: \n        ... '2.2' -> becomes ... '2.' -> so the last character is the dot. There is no trailing space? \n\n   The original string: \n        The part \" - XQuery 2.2\" -> note there is a space between \"XQuery\" and \"2.2\", and also after the dash? \n\n   The entire string: \n        \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2\"\n\n   After removing the last '2', we have: \n        \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\" \n\n   So the space between \"XQuery\" and \"2.\" remains? \n\n   Therefore, when we do f2, we get the lowercase letters from the entire string, including the \"uery\" from \"XQuery\" and the \"2.\" is skipped.\n\n   So the string for f2 is: \n        \"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\" \n\n   And we extract: \n        n, e, w, m, e, d, i, u, m, p, e, r, f, o, r, m, i, n, g, a, p, p, l, i, c, a, t, i, o, n, u, e, r, y\n\n   That is 34 letters.\n\n   Therefore, the final string is 34 letters and then 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   So we write: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery' + 36*'!'\n\n   But note: the word \"newmediumperformingapplicationuery\" is exactly the concatenation of the lowercase letters without any breaks.\n\n   So the output is: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'\n\n   However, to be precise, we can count the exclamation marks: 36.\n\n   But we don't have to write them all, but the problem expects the exact string.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write the string with 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   But note: the function f3 does:\n\n        length = len(n) + 2   -> 34+2 = 36\n        ... then returns the string n (which is 34 characters) plus 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   So the total length is 34+36=70.\n\n   We can verify by counting the exclamation marks: 36.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is the string: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery' followed by 36 exclamation marks.\n\n   We write it as: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n   So we output the string in single quotes.\n\n   However, the problem also says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'\n\n   But wait, let me count the exclamation marks to be sure: 36.\n\n   We can break it down: \n        The string without exclamation marks: 34 characters.\n        Then 36 exclamation marks: \n            We can write: \n                s = 'newmediumperformingapplicationuery' \n                exclamations = '!' * 36\n\n        So the total string is s + exclamations.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   However, note: the function f3 does:\n\n        revn = list(n)   -> creates a list of the string n\n        result = ''.join(revn) -> this is the same as n\n\n        So we are not reversing the string. We are just returning the same string.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n   But note: the function names in the assert are f3, f2, f1. The functions are defined as f, but the comments above say f1, f2, f3. \n   And the assert uses f3, f2, f1. So we assume that the functions are named f1, f2, f3 in the global scope? \n\n   However, the problem states: \"Based on the given Python code\", and the code defines three functions named f (each overwriting the previous one). \n   But the assert uses f3, f2, f1. This is inconsistent.\n\n   Let me read the problem again:\n\n        # f1\n        def f(text, chars):\n        ...\n\n        # f2\n        def f(text):\n        ...\n\n        # f3\n        def f(n):\n        ...\n\n   So in the code, each function is named f, so the last definition (f3) would be the one that remains. \n\n   But the assert statement is:\n\n        assert f3(f2(f1('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-'))) == ...\n\n   This implies that the functions are named f1, f2, f3? But the code does not define them that way.\n\n   This is a problem. However, the problem says: \"which may contain errors\", but we are to complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code.\n\n   How can we execute the code? We must assume that the functions are defined as f1, f2, f3? Or that the code has been fixed to define them as such?\n\n   The problem states: \"Based on the given Python code\", and the code defines three functions all named f. \n\n   But then the assert uses f1, f2, f3. This would cause a NameError because f1, f2, f3 are not defined.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\n   And we are to complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case.\n\n   Since the code as given would not run (because the last definition of f overwrites the previous ones, and then we try to call f1, f2, f3 which are not defined), \n   we must assume that the functions are intended to be named f1, f2, f3 respectively.\n\n   Therefore, we will assume that the code has been corrected to:\n\n        def f1(text, chars):\n            ... \n\n        def f2(text):\n            ...\n\n        def f3(n):\n            ...\n\n   And then the assert uses f1, f2, f3.\n\n   So our computation above is valid.\n\n   Therefore, the output is the string we built.\n\n   Final Answer: \n        'newmediumperformingapplicationuery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'"
