We write the list with the strings in single quotes.\n\nSo the representation is: ['Angela', 'Linda', 'Pete']\n\nBut note: the function f3 returns a sorted list of strings. We write the list exactly.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\nWe have computed the output as ['Angela','Linda','Pete'].\n\nBut wait: let me double-check the functions.\n\nf1: \n    We have: \n        names = ['e','f','j','x','r','k']\n        winners = ['a','v','2','im','nb','vj','z'] -> no common element -> returns [].\n\nf2: \n    starts with ['Pete','Linda','Angela'] -> then extend with [] -> then sort -> \n        ['Angela','Linda','Pete'] -> because in alphabetical order: \n            'A' (in Angela) comes first, then 'L' (Linda), then 'P' (Pete).\n\nf3: \n    sorts the list again -> same because already sorted.\n\nSo the final answer is: ['Angela','Linda','Pete']\n\nBut note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\", but we are only to output the result.\n\nSo we write: ['Angela', 'Linda', 'Pete']\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information\"\n\nSo we output the list as it is.\n\nBut note: the example output format for a string would be in single quotes, but for a list we write the list representation.\n\nTherefore, we output: ['Angela', 'Linda', 'Pete']"
