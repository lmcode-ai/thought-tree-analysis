Actually: \n            index: 0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3:-1, 4:-1, 5:-1, 6:-1, 7:-1\n            index -1: 7 -> -1, index -2: 6 -> -1, index -3: 5 -> -1\n        so extend with [-1, -1] -> becomes 10 elements: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n   i = -4:\n        Now xs has 10 elements: [ -3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1 ]\n        i=-4 -> element at index -4: \n            index: 0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3:-1, 4:-1, 5:-1, 6:-1, 7:-1, 8:-1, 9:-1\n            index -1: 9 -> -1, index -2:8 -> -1, index -3:7 -> -1, index -4:6 -> -1\n        extend with [-1, -1] -> becomes 12 elements: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n\n   Therefore, f2([-3,1,7,-1]) returns [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n\n Step 3: Compute f3(lists) with lists = [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n\n f3(lists):\n   dic = {}\n   for n in lists:   # we iterate over each element in the list\n\n   We note: the list is: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n\n   However, note that inside the loop we are modifying the list by popping. Also, the iteration is over the original list? \n   Actually, the for loop is iterating over the list that is being modified. This can be tricky.\n\n   Let's break down:\n\n   The list starts as: \n        index0: -3, index1:1, index2:7, index3:-1, index4:-1, ... index11:-1\n\n   Iteration 1: n = -3 (first element)\n        if n in dic? dic is empty -> False\n        else: dic[-3] = lists[:lists.index(-3)+1] \n            lists.index(-3) returns 0 -> so lists[0:1] = [-3] -> dic[-3] = [-3]\n\n   Iteration 2: n = 1 (second element)\n        not in dic -> False\n        dic[1] = lists[:lists.index(1)+1] \n            lists.index(1) returns 1 -> so lists[0:2] = [-3,1] -> dic[1] = [-3,1]\n\n   Iteration 3: n = 7 (third element)\n        not in dic -> False\n        dic[7] = lists[:lists.index(7)+1] \n            lists.index(7) returns 2 -> so lists[0:3] = [-3,1,7] -> dic[7] = [-3,1,7]\n\n   Iteration 4: n = -1 (fourth element)\n        not in dic -> False\n        dic[-1] = lists[:lists.index(-1)+1] \n            lists.index(-1) returns the first occurrence of -1 -> which is at index 3 -> so lists[0:4] = [-3,1,7,-1] -> dic[-1] = [-3,1,7,-1]\n\n   Iteration 5: n = -1 (fifth element) -> but note the list is being modified? \n        However, we are at the fifth element. But wait, the list has been popped? Not until we see a duplicate.\n\n        Now, when we get to the fifth element, n=-1, which is in dic? Yes, because we added -1 at iteration4.\n\n        So we do: \n            dic[n].append(lists.pop(lists.index(n)))\n            Here, n=-1, and lists.index(n) will return the first occurrence of -1 -> index3.\n            So we pop the element at index3: \n                The list becomes: \n                    original: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n                    after popping index3: \n                         indices: \n                            0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (which was the fourth element originally, now becomes index3) ... and then the rest shift: \n                         becomes: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]   (11 elements)\n            Then we append the popped element (which was -1) to dic[-1]. So dic[-1] becomes [-3,1,7,-1, -1]\n\n        But note: the list is now shorter and the next element we would have been at index5? But the for loop is iterating by index? \n        Actually, the for loop continues with the next element, which is now the element that was at index5 (which is now index4) and that element is -1.\n\n   Iteration 6: n = -1 (now at the new index4, which was originally index5) \n        n=-1 is in dic -> True\n        pop the first occurrence of -1 -> which is now at index3? \n            The list: \n                current: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]   (11 elements? but we had 11 after the last pop, then we did one pop so now 10? \n            Actually, after the first pop we had 11 elements? Let me recount:\n\n            Original list: 12 elements.\n            After popping index3: we remove the element at position 3 -> so we have 11 elements: \n                indices: \n                  0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (which was the fourth element originally, now becomes the third element? Wait, no: \n                Actually, when we pop index3, the element at index3 is removed and the elements after shift left.\n\n                Original indices: \n                  0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1, 4: -1, 5: -1, ... 11: -1\n                After popping index3: \n                  0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (from index4), 4: -1 (from index5), ... 10: -1 (from index11) -> 11 elements.\n\n            Now, in the next iteration, we are at the fifth element of the original 12? But the for loop is at the fifth element of the current list? \n            Actually, the for loop is iterating over the list in order. We have already processed the first four elements (index0 to index3) and now we are at index4? \n            But the list has changed. The for loop in Python for a list that is being modified: \n                It uses an internal index that increments regardless of the list changes. \n\n            We started with 12 elements. We are on the fifth iteration (index4 of the original list). After the first pop (at iteration5, which is the fifth element? but wait we are at the fifth element and we are popping an element at index3) the list becomes 11 elements. The for loop will continue to index5? \n\n            Actually, the for loop index is independent? It's better to think that the for loop iterates by the order of the indices. \n\n            We have done 4 iterations (index0 to index3). The next iteration is index4. \n\n            After the pop at iteration4 (which was the fourth element, n=-1 at index3) we popped an element at index3. Then the element that was at index4 becomes index3, and the element that was at index5 becomes index4, etc. \n\n            So when we get to iteration5 (which is the fifth element, originally at index4) we are now at index4 of the current list? But the current list has 11 elements. \n\n            However, the for loop continues with the next index: index4. \n\n            The list at iteration5 (the fifth element) is:\n                current list: \n                  index0: -3, index1:1, index2:7, index3: -1 (which was originally index4), index4: -1 (originally index5), ... index10: -1.\n\n            So n = the element at index4 -> which is -1.\n\n            Then we do: \n                pop the first occurrence of -1 -> which is at index0? No, the first occurrence of -1 is at index3? \n                Because: \n                    [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] \n                    the first -1 is at index3.\n\n            So we pop index3 -> the list becomes: \n                [-3,1,7, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]   (9 elements? because we removed one element)\n\n            Then we append that popped element (-1) to dic[-1]. So dic[-1] becomes [-3,1,7,-1,-1, -1]\n\n        Then we go to iteration6: which would be the sixth element of the original 12? But we have modified the list and we are now at index5? \n\n        However, the for loop has an internal counter that has gone through 5 iterations (0,1,2,3,4) and now we are at the sixth iteration? \n        But the list now has 9 elements. The for loop will try to get the element at index5? \n\n        The list: \n            index0: -3, index1:1, index2:7, index3: -1 (which was originally index5), index4: -1 (originally index6), ... index8: -1.\n\n        So n = element at index5? But wait, the for loop is iterating by the index of the original list? \n\n        Actually, the for loop in Python for a list that is being modified: \n            It uses an internal counter that goes from 0 to the original length-1. But note: we started with 12 elements. \n\n        However, we are popping elements so the list is getting shorter. The for loop will run 12 times? \n\n        But the list is being reduced. We have already run 5 iterations and we have 7 more to go? \n\n        This is dangerous because we might get an index error? \n\n        Alternatively, let's simulate the for loop step by step for the entire 12 iterations? \n\n        We started with a list of 12 elements. The for loop will run 12 times? \n\n        But we are popping elements so the list is getting shorter. \n\n        We have done 4 iterations without popping (for n=-3,1,7,-1) and then two iterations with popping (for the next two -1's). \n\n        Now we are at iteration6 (the sixth element). The list has 9 elements. \n\n        We are at index5? But the for loop index is the next index: 5? \n\n        The element at index5 in the current list: \n            current list: \n                index0: -3, index1:1, index2:7, index3: -1, index4: -1, index5: -1, index6: -1, index7: -1, index8: -1\n            so n = -1.\n\n        Then we do: \n            pop the first occurrence of -1 -> index3? \n            pop index3: \n                list becomes: \n                    [-3,1,7, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]   (8 elements)\n            and append that popped element (-1) to dic[-1] -> now dic[-1] = [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1, -1]\n\n        Then iteration7: index6? \n            current list: 8 elements -> index6: the element at index6 is -1? \n            n = -1 -> in dic -> True\n            pop first occurrence: index3? \n                list: [-3,1,7, -1, -1, -1, -1] -> becomes 7 elements? \n            append popped element (-1) to dic[-1] -> now dic[-1] = [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1, -1]\n\n        iteration8: index7? \n            current list: 7 elements -> index7? but the list only has 7 elements? so index7 is out of range? \n\n        Wait, the for loop is set to run for the original length of the list (12). We are at iteration8 (the 8th element) and the list now has 7 elements. \n\n        How does the for loop handle that? \n\n        Actually, the for loop iterates by the index of the list at the time of iteration? \n\n        But note: the for loop is defined as: for n in lists: \n            It uses an iterator that goes through the list elements one by one. \n\n        When we remove elements from the list, the iterator is affected. \n\n        Let me test with a small example:\n\n            lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n            for x in lst:\n                print(x)\n                if x == 2:\n                    lst.pop(0)   # removes the 1\n\n            This would print: 1,2,4,5,6? \n\n        Actually, the iterator is based on the current list. When we remove an element at the beginning, the list shifts and the next element is the one that was at index2? \n\n        But in our case, we are popping the first occurrence of -1 which is always at index3? \n\n        However, after several pops, the list becomes:\n\n            After 4 iterations: we have the list as 12 elements -> then we pop at index3 -> 11 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 10 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 9 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 8 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 7 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 6 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 5 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 4 elements -> then pop at index3 -> 3 elements -> then pop at index3 -> but now index3 is out of range? \n\n        Actually, we started with 12 elements. We are going to do 12 iterations. \n\n        We have 4 non-pop iterations and then 8 pop iterations? \n\n        But in the pop iterations, we are always popping the element at index3? \n\n        The list length at each pop iteration:\n\n            iteration4 (the fifth element): pop at index3 -> length becomes 11\n            iteration5: pop at index3 -> length becomes 10\n            iteration6: pop at index3 -> 9\n            iteration7: 8\n            iteration8: 7\n            iteration9: 6\n            iteration10: 5\n            iteration11: 4\n            iteration12: 3\n\n        But at iteration12, we are at the last element? \n\n        However, when we get to iteration12, the list has 3 elements. We are trying to get the 12th element? \n\n        Actually, the for loop will stop when it has gone through 12 elements? \n\n        But the list is being reduced. The for loop will run 12 times? \n\n        How? \n\n        The for loop uses an internal counter that is independent? \n\n        Alternatively, the for loop in Python for a list is implemented as:\n\n            index = 0\n            while index < len(original_list_at_start)? \n            No, it uses an iterator that is over the current list. \n\n        Actually, the for loop:\n\n            for n in lists:\n\n        is equivalent to:\n\n            iterator = iter(lists)\n            while True:\n                try:\n                    n = next(iterator)\n                except StopIteration:\n                    break\n                # body\n\n        And if we modify the list during the iteration, the iterator is over the same list. \n\n        So when we pop an element, the iterator will continue with the next element in the current list. \n\n        But note: we are popping an element that is before the current position? \n\n        We are always popping the first occurrence (which is at index3) and we are at a position that is after index3? \n\n        For example, at iteration5 (the fifth element) we are at index4 (of the original 12) and we pop index3. Then the element that was at index4 becomes index3. The iterator has already passed index3? It is at index4? But after popping, the element that was at index4 is now at index3. The iterator then moves to the next index: index4? \n\n        However, the iterator does not reset. It just moves to the next index. \n\n        So:\n\n            We start with a list of 12: \n                indices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\n\n            We have an iterator that will yield:\n\n                index0: -3 -> processed (non-pop)\n                index1: 1 -> processed (non-pop)\n                index2: 7 -> processed (non-pop)\n                index3: -1 -> processed (non-pop) -> then we pop index3? \n                    But wait, we are at index3 and we pop index3 -> then the element at index4 becomes index3? \n                    Then the iterator will next go to index4? \n\n            But after popping index3, the list becomes:\n\n                indices: \n                    0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (was index4), 4: -1 (was index5), ... 10: -1 (was index11)\n\n            Then the next index the iterator goes to is index4? \n\n            So at iteration5: we are at index4? \n\n            Then we pop the first occurrence of -1 -> which is at index3? \n\n            Then the list becomes:\n\n                0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (was index4? no, after popping index3, the element at index4 becomes index3? \n\n            Actually, when we pop an element at an index that is less than the current iterator position, then the current iterator position is shifted back by one? \n\n            But note: we are popping an element that is before the current position. \n\n            Example: \n                list = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n                for i, x in enumerate(list):\n                    print(i, x)\n                    if i == 3:\n                        list.pop(0)   # remove the first element\n\n                This would print:\n                    i=0: x=0\n                    i=1: x=1\n                    i=2: x=2\n                    i=3: x=3 -> then pop(0) -> list becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> but note the current index is 3? \n                Then next i=4: but the list now has 5 elements, so index4 is the last element? \n                So it prints 4:5? \n\n            So the iterator does not know about the shift? It just goes by index. \n\n            Therefore, in our case:\n\n                We start with 12 elements.\n\n                Iteration0: index0 -> n=-3 -> non-pop -> list unchanged -> next index1\n                Iteration1: index1 -> n=1 -> non-pop -> next index2\n                Iteration2: index2 -> n=7 -> non-pop -> next index3\n                Iteration3: index3 -> n=-1 -> non-pop -> then we set dic[-1] = ... -> then next index4\n                Iteration4: index4 -> n=-1 -> in dic -> True -> then we pop the first occurrence of -1 -> which is at index3? \n                    So we remove the element at index3 -> the list becomes 11 elements: \n                        0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (was index4), 4: -1 (was index5), ... 10: -1 (was index11)\n                    Then we append that popped element to dic[-1] -> dic[-1] becomes [-3,1,7,-1, -1] \n                    Then the iterator will go to index5? \n                Iteration5: index5 -> now the element at index5 in the current list is -1 (which was originally at index6) -> \n                    Then we pop the first occurrence of -1 -> which is now at index3? \n                    So we remove index3 -> list becomes 10 elements: \n                        0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (was index4? no, after the first pop, index4 became index3? and then we removed that? \n                    Actually, after the first pop (at iteration4) the list was:\n                        0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (from original index4), 4: -1 (from original index5), ... 10: -1 (from original index11)\n                    Then we pop index3 -> so we remove the element at index3 -> which is the first -1 after the 7? \n                    Then the list becomes:\n                        0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (from original index5), 4: -1 (from original index6), ... 9: -1 (from original index11) -> 10 elements? \n                    Then we append that popped element to dic[-1] -> dic[-1] becomes [-3,1,7,-1,-1, -1]\n\n                Iteration6: index6 -> but the list now has 10 elements? so index6 exists? \n                    The element at index6 in the current list: \n                        0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1, 4: -1, 5: -1, 6: -1, 7: -1, 8: -1, 9: -1\n                    So n = -1 (at index6) -> \n                    Then pop the first occurrence of -1 -> index3? \n                    Then the list becomes 9 elements: \n                        0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3: -1 (from original index5? but we removed the one at original index4 and then the one at original index5? so now the first -1 is at index3? which is the one from original index6? \n                    Then append to dic[-1] -> now dic[-1] = [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1, -1]\n\n                We continue until we have done 12 iterations? \n\n            But note: the list is getting shorter. We started with 12, and we remove one element per pop iteration. We have 4 non-pop and 8 pop iterations? so we remove 8 elements -> the list would be 12 - 8 = 4 elements? \n\n            However, the for loop will run 12 times? \n\n            But when we get to iteration index11, the list might have only 4 elements? \n\n            How does the for loop handle that? \n\n            The for loop will run exactly 12 times? \n\n            But if the list becomes shorter than 12, then at some point we will get an index that is beyond the current length? \n\n            Actually, the for loop does not use an index counter but an iterator. The iterator for a list uses an internal index that starts at 0 and increments by one each time. \n\n            So if we remove elements from the list that are at or before the current iterator position, then the next element is shifted. But if we remove an element that is after the current iterator position, it doesn't affect. \n\n            However, in our case, we are always removing an element at a fixed index (index3) which is before the current iterator position? \n\n            At iteration0: current index0 -> remove index3? not at this iteration.\n            At iteration1: current index1 -> remove index3? not at this iteration.\n            At iteration2: current index2 -> remove index3? not at this iteration.\n            At iteration3: current index3 -> we don't remove at this iteration? because we are in the non-pop branch? \n            At iteration4: current index4 -> we remove index3 -> which is before the current index -> then the current index4 becomes index3? \n            Then at iteration5: we are at index5? but the list has been shortened so that the current index5 might be beyond the list? \n\n            Actually, after removing one element, the list length is 11. The for loop will try to get the element at index4? \n\n            But we are at iteration4 (which is the fifth element) and we have processed index0,1,2,3,4 -> so next is iteration5: index5? \n\n            The list has 11 elements -> index5 exists? \n\n            Then at iteration5: we remove index3 -> list becomes 10 elements -> then iteration6: index6 -> exists? \n            ... until iteration11: index11 -> but after 8 removals, the list has 12 - 8 = 4 elements? \n\n            So at iteration11, we try to access index11 -> which is out of range? \n\n            But the for loop in Python will not throw an error? It will stop when the internal index reaches the current length? \n\n            Actually, no. The for loop is defined to run for each element in the list at the time of the iteration. If the list is shortened, the for loop will run fewer times? \n\n            Let me test with a small example:\n\n                lst = [1,2,3,4,5]\n                for i, x in enumerate(lst):\n                    print(i, x)\n                    if i == 2:\n                        lst.pop(0)\n                        lst.pop(0)\n\n                This prints:\n                    0: 1\n                    1: 2\n                    2: 3\n                Then we pop two times: remove 1 and 2 -> then the list becomes [3,4,5] -> but note the current index is 2? \n                Then next iteration: i=3 -> but the list now has only 3 elements? so index3 is out of range? \n\n                However, the for loop does not run for i=3? \n\n                Actually, the for loop runs for the original list? \n\n                But wait, the for loop is over the list object. When we remove elements, the list is shortened. \n\n                The above example:\n\n                    After two pops, the list becomes [3,4,5] -> but the for loop has already processed indices0,1,2. \n                    The next index is 3 -> but the list has only 3 elements -> index0:3, index1:4, index2:5 -> so index3 is out of range? \n\n                Therefore, the for loop will stop after index2? \n\n                But we did 3 iterations. \n\n            So in our case, we start with 12 elements. The for loop will run 12 times? \n\n            But if we remove 8 elements, then after 12 iterations? \n\n            Actually, the for loop will run until the internal index reaches the current length of the list. \n\n            The internal index starts at 0 and increments by one each iteration. \n\n            We start with 12 elements. \n\n            We do:\n\n                iteration0: index0 -> list length 12 -> then index1\n                iteration1: index1 -> list length 12 -> then index2\n                iteration2: index2 -> list length 12 -> then index3\n                iteration3: index3 -> list length 12 -> then index4\n                iteration4: index4 -> list length 12 -> then we remove one element -> list becomes 11 -> then index5\n                iteration5: index5 -> list length 11 -> then remove one element -> list becomes 10 -> then index6\n                iteration6: index6 -> list length 10 -> remove -> 9 -> index7\n                iteration7: index7 -> list length 9 -> remove -> 8 -> index8\n                iteration8: index8 -> list length 8 -> remove -> 7 -> index9\n                iteration9: index9 -> list length 7 -> remove -> 6 -> index10\n                iteration10: index10 -> list length 6 -> remove -> 5 -> index11\n                iteration11: index11 -> list length 5 -> so index11 is out of range? \n\n            But the for loop will try to access index11? \n\n            How does the for loop know when to stop? \n\n            The for loop uses an iterator that is equivalent to:\n\n                index = 0\n                while index < len(current_list): \n                    # but no, because the current_list changes.\n\n            Actually, the iterator for a list is implemented to keep an index and at each step it checks if the index is less than the current length. \n\n            So at iteration11: \n                index = 11\n                current length = 5 -> 11 < 5 is false -> so it stops? \n\n            Therefore, the for loop will run only until the internal index is beyond the current list length. \n\n            So we only run 5 iterations? \n\n            But that doesn't match our earlier example. \n\n            Let me test with a small example:\n\n                lst = [10,20,30,40,50]\n                for i, x in enumerate(lst):\n                    print(i, x)\n                    if i==1:\n                        lst.pop(0)\n\n                This prints:\n                    i=0: x=10\n                    i=1: x=20 -> then pop(0) -> lst becomes [20,30,40,50] \n                Then next iteration: i=2 -> but the list now has 4 elements? \n                    The current list: \n                        index0:20, index1:30, index2:40, index3:50\n                    so i=2 -> x = 40? \n\n                Why not 30? \n\n                Because after popping, the list shifts. The element that was at index1 becomes index0, index2 becomes index1, etc. \n                But the for loop is at index2? \n\n                So it prints: \n                    0:10\n                    1:20\n                    2:40\n\n            So the for loop does not adjust the index for the popped elements? \n\n            Therefore, in our case, we will run 12 iterations? \n\n            But when the current list length becomes less than the current index, we get an error? \n\n            Actually, no. The for loop will not throw an error. It will simply stop when the internal index is >= len(list). \n\n            So in iteration11, the internal index is 11, and if the list has only 5 elements, then it stops. \n\n            But we have only done 11 iterations? \n\n            We need to do 12 iterations? \n\n            How many iterations will we do? \n\n            We start with 12 elements. \n\n            We do iteration0 to iteration11: that's 12 iterations. \n\n            But after each pop, the list length decreases by one. \n\n            We pop 8 times (from iteration4 to iteration11) -> so the list length at iteration11 is 12 - 8 = 4? \n\n            Then at iteration11: the internal index is 11, and the list length is 4 -> 11>=4 -> so the for loop stops after 11 iterations? \n\n            But we have done 11 iterations, not 12. \n\n            However, we have popped 8 times, but we have also done 11 iterations. \n\n            How many iterations have we done? \n\n            iteration0: index0 -> list length 12 -> index0 exists\n            iteration1: index1 -> list length 12 -> exists\n            iteration2: index2 -> exists\n            iteration3: index3 -> exists\n            iteration4: index4 -> exists -> then pop -> list length 11\n            iteration5: index5 -> exists (because 5<11) -> pop -> length 10\n            iteration6: index6 -> exists (6<10) -> pop -> length 9\n            iteration7: index7 -> exists (7<9) -> pop -> length 8\n            iteration8: index8 -> exists (8<8 is false? 8<8 is false -> so it should stop? \n\n            Actually, the condition is: if the current index is less than the current length? \n\n            At iteration8: index=8, current length=8 -> 8<8 is false -> so it stops. \n\n            Therefore, we only do 8 iterations? \n\n            But we have to do 12 iterations? \n\n            This is confusing. \n\n        Given the complexity, let's try to simulate with a small list and see what f3 does.\n\n        Alternatively, we can run the code mentally for a smaller list. \n\n        But the problem is large. \n\n        However, note that after the first 4 iterations, we have:\n\n            dic = {\n                -3: [-3],\n                1: [-3,1],\n                7: [-3,1,7],\n                -1: [-3,1,7,-1]\n            }\n\n        Then for the next 8 elements (which are all -1), we will do:\n\n            for each of these 8 elements, we do:\n                if n in dic: True for -1\n                then: pop the first occurrence of -1 (which is at index3) and append that popped element to dic[-1]\n\n            So we will pop 8 times. \n\n            Each pop removes the element at index3. \n\n            And we append that popped element to dic[-1] -> so dic[-1] will have the initial [-3,1,7,-1] plus 8 times -1? \n\n            So dic[-1] becomes: [-3,1,7,-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]   (12 elements)\n\n            But note: the initial segment for -1 was [-3,1,7,-1] (4 elements) and then we append 8 times -1 -> total 12 elements.\n\n        And what about the other keys? They remain unchanged.\n\n        Then we return str(dic).replace(' ','') \n\n        So dic = {\n            -3: [-3],\n            1: [-3,1],\n            7: [-3,1,7],\n            -1: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n        }\n\n        Convert to string without spaces: \n\n            str(dic) = \"{-3: [-3], 1: [-3, 1], 7: [-3, 1, 7], -1: [-3, 1, 7, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]}\"\n\n        Without spaces: \n\n            \"{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}\"\n\n        But note: the initial list for -1 has the first four elements and then 8 popped -1's.\n\n        However, is this what happens? \n\n        In the popping, we are popping the first occurrence of -1, which is always at index3? \n\n        And we do it 8 times. \n\n        And the list initially has 12 elements: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,...,-1] (8 more -1's after the first -1)\n\n        After popping the first -1 (at index3) 8 times, we remove all the -1's that were after the 7? \n\n        But the list initially has 9 -1's? \n\n        The first -1 is at index3, and then 8 more -1's? \n\n        We remove the first -1 (index3) -> then the next -1 becomes the new index3? \n\n        So we remove the first 8 -1's? \n\n        Then the list becomes: [-3,1,7, -1] (because the last -1 remains? but we had 9 -1's initially? \n\n        Let me count the initial list for f3: \n            [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] -> that's 9 -1's? \n            because: -3,1,7 -> 3 non -1, then 9 -1's -> total 12.\n\n        We remove 8 -1's by popping the first occurrence each time. \n\n        So the list becomes: [-3,1,7, -1] (one -1 left) -> but wait, we remove the first occurrence 8 times, so we remove the first 8 -1's. \n\n        The first -1 is at index3, then after removal the next -1 is at index3 (which was originally index4), then next at index3 (originally index5), ... until we remove 8 -1's. \n\n        Then the list becomes: [-3,1,7, -1] -> wait, no: the last -1 is the one that was originally at the end? \n\n        Actually, after removing 8 -1's, we remove the first 8 -1's. The list initially had 9 -1's. So there is one -1 left at the end? \n\n        But after removals, the list will have: \n            the first three: -3,1,7 -> and then the last -1? \n\n        But how? \n\n        Initially: \n            positions: \n                0: -3\n                1: 1\n                2: 7\n                3: -1  (first -1)\n                4: -1\n                5: -1\n                6: -1\n                7: -1\n                8: -1\n                9: -1\n                10: -1\n                11: -1\n\n        We remove the first -1 (index3) -> then the list shifts: \n            now the first -1 is gone, and the next -1 at index4 becomes index3? \n            then we remove that (index3) -> then the next -1 (originally index5) becomes index3? \n            ... until we remove the -1 that was originally at index10 -> then the list becomes:\n\n                -3,1,7, and then the last element is the -1 that was at index11 -> now at index3? \n\n            After 8 removals, we have removed the -1's at positions 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -> leaving the -1 at position11 at index3? \n\n            So the list becomes: [-3,1,7, -1] (4 elements)\n\n        Therefore, the for loop will run 12 iterations? \n\n        But after 8 pops, the list has 4 elements. \n\n        The for loop will run for 12 iterations? \n\n        How? \n\n        The for loop is defined to iterate over the original list of 12 elements. \n\n        But if the list is modified, the for loop might run more than the current length? \n\n        Actually, the for loop in Python for a list that is being extended can run forever. But here we are popping. \n\n        We have 12 iterations. \n\n        We have completed 4 non-pop iterations and 8 pop iterations. \n\n        The for loop will run 12 times. \n\n        But after the 12th iteration, we have processed all 12 elements. \n\n        So we are safe. \n\n        Therefore, the dictionary is as described.\n\n        So the final dictionary is:\n\n            -3: [-3]\n            1: [-3,1]\n            7: [-3,1,7]\n            -1: [-3,1,7,-1] + 8 times -1 = [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\n\n        Then we return str(dic).replace(' ','') \n\n        Let's format the string:\n\n            \"{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}\"\n\n        But note: the list for -1 has 12 elements: \n            starts with [-3,1,7] and then 9 -1's? \n\n        Count: \n            initial for -1: [-3,1,7,-1] -> 4 elements\n            then we append 8 popped -1's -> 4+8=12.\n\n        And the entire list had 12 elements.\n\n        Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n            assert ... == '{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}'\n\n        However, let's double-check the initial list for f3: \n            We had: [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] -> 12 elements.\n\n        And the first occurrence of -1 is at index3. We pop that one and append it to dic[-1] -> so the first popped -1 is appended first. \n\n        Therefore, the list for -1 becomes: \n            initially: [-3,1,7,-1] \n            then append the popped -1 (which is the first -1, originally at index3) -> becomes [-3,1,7,-1, -1]\n            then append the next popped -1 (originally at index4) -> becomes [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1]\n            ... until we have appended 8 times.\n\n        So the list for -1 is: \n            [-3,1,7,-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]\n\n        Exactly as described.\n\n        Therefore, the string is as above.\n\n        But note: the representation of the list might not have spaces? \n\n        The code: str(dic).replace(' ', '') \n\n        So we remove all spaces. \n\n        The standard string for a dictionary: \n            str({-3: [-3], 1: [-3, 1], 7: [-3, 1, 7], -1: [-3, 1, 7, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]}) \n            without spaces: \n\n        Let's build it:\n\n            \"{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}\"\n\n        But note: there might be no spaces after commas in the lists? \n\n        Actually, the standard representation of a list in Python does not have spaces after the commas? \n\n        Example: \n            str([1,2,3]) -> '[1, 2, 3]' -> then we remove spaces -> '[1,2,3]' becomes '1,2,3'? \n\n        But wait, we remove all spaces. \n\n        So:\n\n            Original string: \n                \"{-3: [-3], 1: [-3, 1], 7: [-3, 1, 7], -1: [-3, 1, 7, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]}\"\n\n            After removing spaces: \n                \"{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}\"\n\n        But note: the inner lists: \n            [-3] becomes '[-3]' -> without spaces: '[-3]' -> unchanged.\n            [-3,1] becomes '[-3,1]' -> without spaces: '[-3,1]' -> note: no space after the comma.\n\n        So the representation is as above.\n\n        Therefore, the output is:\n\n            '{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}'\n\n        But wait, the list for -1: \n            [-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] -> without spaces: \n            the string would be: '[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]' -> but note there are no spaces.\n\n        So the entire string is as above.\n\n        However, let's check the keys: \n            The keys are integers: -3, 1, 7, -1.\n\n        The dictionary string representation uses the repr of the keys and values.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer is the string:\n\n            '{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}'\n\n        But note: the order of keys in the dictionary? \n            In Python, the order of keys in a dictionary is insertion order (since Python 3.6+). \n\n        We inserted:\n            -3, then 1, then 7, then -1.\n\n        So the order is as above.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        However, note: the function f2 might have been implemented differently? \n\n        But we already computed f2(f1(...)) and got the list of 12 elements.\n\n        So the answer is the string above.\n\n        Let me write it without newlines and without spaces.\n\n        We must output the string exactly.\n\n        Note: the problem says: If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            '{-3:[-3],1:[-3,1],7:[-3,1,7],-1:[-3,1,7,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]}'\n\n        But wait, the list for -1 has 12 elements: \n            element0: -3\n            element1: 1\n            element2: 7\n            element3: -1\n            element4 to element11: -1 (8 times)\n\n        That's 12 elements.\n\n        And the representation is as above.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident."
