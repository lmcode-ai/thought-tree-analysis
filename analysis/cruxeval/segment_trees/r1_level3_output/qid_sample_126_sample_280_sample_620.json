We are to compute:\n    f3(f2(f1('kkxkxxfck')))\n\nWe must do this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute f1('kkxkxxfck')\n\nf1 code:\n    def f(text):\n        s = text.rpartition('o')\n        div, div2 = (s[0] == '' and '-' or s[0]), (s[2] == '' and '-' or s[2])\n        return s[1] + div + s[1] + div2\n\nExplanation of f1:\n    - rpartition('o') splits the string at the last occurrence of 'o' and returns a tuple (head, sep, tail).\n    - If 'o' is not found, it returns ('', '', original_string).\n\nFor the input 'kkxkxxfck', note there is no 'o'. Therefore:\n    s = ('', '', 'kkxkxxfck')\n\nThen:\n    div = (s[0] == '' and '-' or s[0]) \n        -> s[0] is '' -> condition is true -> div = '-'\n    div2 = (s[2] == '' and '-' or s[2])\n        -> s[2] is 'kkxkxxfck' (non-empty) -> condition false -> div2 = s[2] = 'kkxkxxfck'\n\nThen return:\n    s[1] (which is '') + div (which is '-') + s[1] (again '') + div2 (which is 'kkxkxxfck')\n    So the result is: '' + '-' + '' + 'kkxkxxfck' = '-kkxkxxfck'\n\nTherefore, f1('kkxkxxfck') returns '-kkxkxxfck'\n\nStep 2: Compute f2 on the result of f1, i.e., f2('-kkxkxxfck')\n\nBut note: the f2 code has a global variable `field` and also uses a global `g`. However, we are only concerned with the return value of f2.\n\nf2 code:\n    field = 0   # This is a global variable\n\n    def f(text):\n        global g, field\n        field = text.replace(' ', '')\n        g = text.replace('0', ' ')\n        text = text.replace('1', 'i')\n        return text\n\nSo, we call f2 with text = '-kkxkxxfck'\n\nInside f2:\n    field = text.replace(' ', '') \n        -> There are no spaces in the string, so field becomes '-kkxkxxfck' (but we don't use field in the chain)\n    g = text.replace('0', ' ') \n        -> There are no '0's, so g becomes '-kkxkxxfck' (again, not used in the chain)\n    text = text.replace('1', 'i') \n        -> There are no '1's, so text remains '-kkxkxxfck'\n\nTherefore, f2 returns the same string: '-kkxkxxfck'\n\nStep 3: Compute f3 on the result of f2, i.e., f3('-kkxkxxfck')\n\nf3 code:\n    def f(x):\n        return \" \".join(list(x)[::-1])\n\nExplanation:\n    - list(x) converts the string into a list of characters: ['-', 'k', 'k', 'x', 'k', 'x', 'x', 'f', 'c', 'k']\n    - [::-1] reverses the list: ['k', 'c', 'f', 'x', 'x', 'k', 'x', 'k', 'k', '-']\n    - Then we join them with a space: \"k c f x x k x k k -\"\n\nTherefore, the final result is: \"k c f x x k x k k -\"\n\nBut note: the problem says to enclose the string in single quotes. However, the assert statement expects the output as a string. Since the output is a string, we write it in single quotes.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\nSo we just write: 'k c f x x k x k k -'\n\nBut wait: let me double-check the steps.\n\nStep 1: f1('kkxkxxfck') -> \n    rpartition('o') on a string without 'o' gives ('', '', 'kkxkxxfck')\n    div = (s[0]=='' -> True) -> '-'\n    div2 = (s[2]=='' -> False) -> s[2] = 'kkxkxxfck'\n    return: s[1] (which is '') + '-' + s[1] (again '') + 'kkxkxxfck' -> '-kkxkxxfck'\n\nStep 2: f2('-kkxkxxfck') -> \n    replaces ' ' -> nothing (no change) -> field set to same.\n    replaces '0' -> ' ' (none) -> g set to same.\n    replaces '1' -> 'i' (none) -> returns same string: '-kkxkxxfck'\n\nStep 3: f3('-kkxkxxfck') -> \n    breaks into list: ['-','k','k','x','k','x','x','f','c','k']\n    reverses: ['k','c','f','x','x','k','x','k','k','-']\n    joins with space: \"k c f x x k x k k -\"\n\nSo the final answer is: 'k c f x x k x k k -'\n\nBut note: the problem says \"assert f3(f2(f1('kkxkxxfck'))) == \" and then we are to complete the assert.\n\nWe are to output the string that would be on the right-hand side of the assert, which is the output of the function chain.\n\nTherefore, we write: 'k c f x x k x k k -'"
