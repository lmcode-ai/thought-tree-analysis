So:\n              We are taking from 0 to 9 (exclusive) with step 10 -> that's only the element at index0 because:\n                indices: 0, 10 -> but 10 is beyond 9, so only index0.\n\n          The assignment: [c for c in chars[index:index+count:1]]\n            index=9, count=1 -> so slice is from index9 to index9+1 (exclusive) -> [chars[9]] which is '5'\n\n        Therefore, we are replacing the slice chars[0:9:10] (which is [chars[0]] -> ['t']) with the list ['5'].\n\n        So the new chars becomes:\n          ['5','e','z','m','g','v','n',' ','6','5','1','h']\n\n     Then return ''.join(chars) -> \"5ezmgvn 651h\"\n\n Step 2: Compute f2 on the result of f1 -> f2(\"5ezmgvn 651h\")\n   Function f2(text):\n     text = list(text) -> ['5','e','z','m','g','v','n',' ','6','5','1','h']\n     for i in range(len(text)):\n        if i % 2 == 1: (i.e., odd indices: 1,3,5,7,9,11)\n          text[i] = text[i].swapcase()\n\n     Let's do each odd index:\n        i=1: 'e' -> swapcase -> 'E'\n        i=3: 'm' -> 'M'\n        i=5: 'v' -> 'V'\n        i=7: ' ' -> swapcase of space is space (unchanged)\n        i=9: '5' -> swapcase of digit is the same digit -> '5'\n        i=11: 'h' -> 'H'\n\n     So the list becomes:\n        ['5','E','z','M','g','V','n',' ','6','5','1','H']\n     Return ''.join -> \"5EzMgVn 651H\"\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the result of f2 -> f3(\"5EzMgVn 651H\")\n   Function f3(text):\n     ans = []\n     for char in text:\n        if char.isdigit(): \n            ans.append(char)\n        else:\n            ans.append(' ')\n\n     So we go through each character in \"5EzMgVn 651H\":\n        '5' -> digit -> append '5'\n        'E' -> not -> append ' '\n        'z' -> not -> append ' '\n        'M' -> not -> append ' '\n        'g' -> not -> append ' '\n        'V' -> not -> append ' '\n        'n' -> not -> append ' '\n        ' ' -> not (space is not digit) -> append ' '\n        '6' -> digit -> append '6'\n        '5' -> digit -> append '5'\n        '1' -> digit -> append '1'\n        'H' -> not -> append ' '\n\n     So the list becomes: \n        ['5',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ','6','5','1',' '] \n        But wait, the original string has 12 characters? \n        Actually, the string is \"5EzMgVn 651H\" (12 characters). So we have 12 elements.\n\n        The list: \n          [ '5', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '6', '5', '1', ' ']\n\n     Then we return ''.join(ans) -> \"5        651 \" \n\n     However, note that the spaces: \n        The string: \n          index0: '5' -> '5'\n          index1: 'E' -> ' '\n          index2: 'z' -> ' '\n          index3: 'M' -> ' '\n          index4: 'g' -> ' '\n          index5: 'V' -> ' '\n          index6: 'n' -> ' '\n          index7: ' ' -> ' '\n          index8: '6' -> '6'\n          index9: '5' -> '5'\n          index10: '1' -> '1'\n          index11: 'H' -> ' '\n\n        So the string is: \"5      651 \" (with 7 spaces between '5' and '6', then the digits and then a space at the end)\n\n        Actually, from index1 to index7: that's 7 characters -> 7 spaces, then at index11 one more space.\n\n        So the string is: \n          \"5\" + 7 spaces + \"651\" + 1 space -> \"5       651 \"\n\n     But wait, let's count: \n        positions: \n          0: '5'\n          1: ' '\n          2: ' '\n          3: ' '\n          4: ' '\n          5: ' '\n          6: ' '\n          7: ' '\n          8: '6'\n          9: '5'\n          10: '1'\n          11: ' '\n\n        So the string is 12 characters: \"5       651 \" (with 8 characters from index0 to index11? Actually, index0 to index11 is 12 characters: 1 for the first, 7 spaces in the middle? Actually, from index1 to index7 is 7 indices -> 7 spaces, then index8 to index10: 3 digits, then index11: space -> total: 1+7+3+1 = 12).\n\n        How many spaces between the first '5' and the '6'? \n          The first character is at index0: '5'\n          Then from index1 to index7: 7 spaces -> that's 7 characters.\n          Then at index8: '6'\n\n        So the string: \n          \"5\" + (7 spaces) + \"651\" + (1 space) -> \"5       651 \"\n\n        But note: the space at index7 is the space that was originally in the string? Actually, we are replacing every non-digit by a space.\n\n        So the output of f3 is: \"5       651 \"\n\n However, let me double-check the step in f1 because the slicing operation is complex.\n\n Re-examining f1:\n\n   We had: \n        chars = ['t','e','z','m','g','v','n',' ','6','5','1','h']\n        index = 9 (because index of '6' is 8, then +1 -> 9)\n\n        Then: \n          chars[:index:index+1] = ... \n\n        The slice [0:9:10] -> \n          start=0, stop=9, step=10 -> only index0 is included because next would be 0+10=10 which is beyond 9.\n\n        So we are replacing the element at index0 (which is 't') with the list of characters from the slice [9:10] (which is ['5']).\n\n        So we are replacing the first element (at index0) with '5'. \n\n        Therefore, the list becomes: \n          ['5','e','z','m','g','v','n',' ','6','5','1','h'] -> but wait, the original element at index0 is replaced by '5'. \n          However, the rest remains? \n\n        But note: the assignment is for the slice. The slice we are replacing is of length 1 (only index0). The replacement list is of length 1 (only '5'). So it's a one-to-one replacement.\n\n        So the result of f1 is \"5ezmgvn 651h\", not \"5ezmgvn 651h\" with the first character changed? Actually, the first character was 't' and now becomes '5'. \n\n        But wait, the original string was \"tezmgvn 651h\", so after replacing the first character 't' with '5', we get \"5ezmgvn 651h\".\n\n        So step1 is correct.\n\n Therefore, the final result is: \"5       651 \"\n\n But note: the expected output is a string, so we must enclose it in single quotes.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we return: '5       651 '\n\n But let me write it with explicit spaces: \n   There are 7 spaces between '5' and '6', and then after the digits \"651\" there is one space.\n\n   So: \n      '5' + (7 spaces) + '651' + (1 space) -> total 12 characters.\n\n   We can count: \n        '5' -> 1\n        then 7 spaces -> 7\n        then '6','5','1' -> 3\n        then 1 space -> 1\n        total: 1+7+3+1 = 12.\n\n   So the string is: '5       651 '\n\n However, note that the original string in f1 became \"5ezmgvn 651h\", then in f2 became \"5EzMgVn 651H\", then in f3 we replaced every non-digit by a space.\n\n   The digits in \"5EzMgVn 651H\" are:\n        at index0: '5' -> digit -> keep\n        index1: 'E' -> not -> space\n        index2: 'z' -> not -> space\n        index3: 'M' -> not -> space\n        index4: 'g' -> not -> space\n        index5: 'V' -> not -> space\n        index6: 'n' -> not -> space\n        index7: ' ' -> not -> space (already space, but we replace non-digit by space so same)\n        index8: '6' -> digit -> keep\n        index9: '5' -> digit -> keep\n        index10: '1' -> digit -> keep\n        index11: 'H' -> not -> space\n\n   So the string is: \n        index0: '5'\n        index1: ' '\n        index2: ' '\n        index3: ' '\n        index4: ' '\n        index5: ' '\n        index6: ' '\n        index7: ' '\n        index8: '6'\n        index9: '5'\n        index10: '1'\n        index11: ' '\n\n   Therefore, the string is: \"5       651 \" (with 7 spaces between the first '5' and the '6', and then a space at the end).\n\n   But note: the original string in f2 had a space at index7? \n        \"5EzMgVn 651H\" -> \n          index0: '5'\n          index1: 'E'\n          index2: 'z'\n          index3: 'M'\n          index4: 'g'\n          index5: 'V'\n          index6: 'n'\n          index7: ' '\n          index8: '6'\n          index9: '5'\n          index10: '1'\n          index11: 'H'\n\n   So in f3, we are replacing every non-digit by a space. The space at index7 becomes a space (so same). The other non-digits become spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the output is: \"5       651 \" \n\n   But note: the space at index7 is the original space, and we are replacing the other non-digits (at indices 1,2,3,4,5,6,11) by spaces.\n\n   So the string has:\n        - one space at index1 (from 'E')\n        - one at index2 (from 'z')\n        - one at index3 (from 'M')\n        - one at index4 (from 'g')\n        - one at index5 (from 'V')\n        - one at index6 (from 'n')\n        - one at index7 (from the original space) -> remains space\n        - and one at index11 (from 'H')\n\n   So between the first '5' (at index0) and the next digit '6' (at index8) we have 8 characters? \n        indices 1 to 7: that's 7 characters? Actually, from index1 to index7: 7 indices -> 7 characters. Then the next digit is at index8.\n\n   Therefore, the string is: \n        index0: '5'\n        index1: ' '\n        index2: ' '\n        index3: ' '\n        index4: ' '\n        index5: ' '\n        index6: ' '\n        index7: ' '   (this is the original space, but now it's the same as the others)\n        index8: '6'\n        index9: '5'\n        index10: '1'\n        index11: ' '\n\n   So the string: \n        \"5\" + (7 spaces) + \"651\" + (1 space) -> but wait, the 7 spaces are from index1 to index7 (7 characters) and then the digits at 8,9,10, and then a space at 11.\n\n   How many characters from index0 to index11? 12.\n\n   The output string: \n        \"5\" (1) + 7 spaces (7) + \"651\" (3) + \" \" (1) -> total 12.\n\n   So the string is: \"5       (7 times) then 651 then a space.\n\n   But note: the original space at index7 is included in the 7 spaces? Yes.\n\n   Therefore, the string is: \"5       651 \" (with 7 spaces in the middle and one at the end).\n\n   However, when we write it, we see: \n        \"5\" + 7 spaces -> that's 8 characters? \n        Actually, the first character is '5', then 7 spaces: that's 8 characters. Then the next three are \"651\", then a space: 12.\n\n   But wait: \n        index0: '5' -> 1\n        index1: ' ' -> 1\n        index2: ' ' -> 1\n        index3: ' ' -> 1\n        index4: ' ' -> 1\n        index5: ' ' -> 1\n        index6: ' ' -> 1\n        index7: ' ' -> 1 -> that's 8 characters so far (from index0 to index7: 8 characters)\n        index8: '6' -> 1\n        index9: '5' -> 1\n        index10: '1' -> 1\n        index11: ' ' -> 1 -> total 12.\n\n   So the string is: \n        \"5       \" (that's 1 + 7 = 8 characters? Actually, 8 characters: index0 to index7) \n        then \"651 \" (4 characters: index8 to index11) -> total 12.\n\n   But note: the 7 spaces are from index1 to index7? That's 7 indices -> 7 characters? \n        Actually, from index1 to index7 inclusive: \n          index1, index2, index3, index4, index5, index6, index7 -> 7 characters.\n\n        So the string: \n          index0: '5' -> 1\n          index1 to index7: 7 spaces -> 7\n          index8: '6'\n          index9: '5'\n          index10: '1'\n          index11: ' ' -> 1\n\n        So: 1 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 12.\n\n   Therefore, the string is: \"5\" + (7 spaces) + \"651\" + (1 space) = \"5       651 \"\n\n   But note: the representation: \n        We have 7 spaces between the first '5' and the next digit '6'. Then after the digits \"651\", there is one space.\n\n   So the string: \"5<space><space><space><space><space><space><space>651<space>\"\n\n   We can write it as: '5       651 '\n\n   How many spaces between '5' and '6'? 7.\n\n   How many spaces at the end? 1.\n\n   Therefore, the output is: '5       651 '\n\n   But note: the problem says \"enclose it in single quotes\".\n\n   So the answer is: '5       651 '\n\n However, let me check if there is an error in the function f1? The slicing operation is:\n\n        chars[:index:index+1] = [c for c in chars[index:index+count:1]]\n\n   The slice on the left: \n        It is a step of (index+1) which is 10. So we are taking every 10th element from 0 to 9 (exclusive). \n        The indices: 0, 10 -> but 10 is beyond 9, so only index0.\n\n   The right-hand side: \n        chars[index:index+count:1] -> from index9 to index10 (exclusive) -> only index9 -> ['5'].\n\n   So we are replacing the element at index0 with the element at index9.\n\n   That is correct.\n\n   Alternatively, we can run the code in our head for f1:\n\n        text = 'tezmgvn 651h', char = '6'\n        count = 1\n        chars = list('tezmgvn 651h') -> ['t','e','z','m','g','v','n',' ','6','5','1','h']\n        index = 8 (index of '6') + 1 = 9.\n\n        Then we do: \n          chars[:9:10] = [c for c in chars[9:10:1]] -> which is [chars[9]] = ['5']\n\n        The slice on the left: \n          [0:9:10] -> only index0.\n\n        So we set chars[0] = '5'. \n\n        Then the list becomes: \n          ['5','e','z','m','g','v','n',' ','6','5','1','h'] -> which is \"5ezmgvn 651h\"\n\n   So step1 is correct.\n\n   Step2: f2(\"5ezmgvn 651h\") -> \n        We convert to list: \n          ['5','e','z','m','g','v','n',' ','6','5','1','h']\n        Then change odd indices (1-indexed: 1,3,5,7,9,11) to swapcase:\n          index1: 'e' -> 'E'\n          index3: 'm' -> 'M'\n          index5: 'v' -> 'V'\n          index7: ' ' -> ' ' (unchanged)\n          index9: '5' -> '5' (unchanged, because digit)\n          index11: 'h' -> 'H'\n        So we get: \n          ['5','E','z','M','g','V','n',' ','6','5','1','H'] -> \"5EzMgVn 651H\"\n\n   Step3: f3(\"5EzMgVn 651H\") -> \n        We replace non-digits by space:\n          '5' -> '5'\n          'E' -> ' '\n          'z' -> ' '\n          'M' -> ' '\n          'g' -> ' '\n          'V' -> ' '\n          'n' -> ' '\n          ' ' -> ' '\n          '6' -> '6'\n          '5' -> '5'\n          '1' -> '1'\n          'H' -> ' '\n\n        So the string: \n          \"5       (7 spaces) 651 \" -> but note: the last character is a space.\n\n        So: \"5       651 \" (with 7 spaces in the middle and one at the end).\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is: '5       651 '\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\", so we just output the string in quotes.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n   So we write: '5       651 '\n\n   But let me count the spaces: \n        After the '5', there are 7 spaces, then \"651\", then one space.\n\n        We can write: \n          '5' + ' '*7 + '651' + ' ' -> which is 1 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 12.\n\n   So the string is 12 characters long.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is: '5       651 '\n\n   However, note that the original test case: \n        f1('tezmgvn 651h', '6') -> returns \"5ezmgvn 651h\"\n\n   Then f2: \n        \"5ezmgvn 651h\" -> becomes \"5EzMgVn 651H\"\n\n   Then f3: \n        \"5EzMgVn 651H\" -> becomes \"5       (7 spaces) 651 \" -> but note the last character is a space.\n\n   So we output: '5       651 '\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"assert f3(f2(f1('tezmgvn 651h', '6'))) == \"\n\n   And we are to complete the assert statement with the output.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n   So we return: '5       651 '\n\n   But note: the problem says \"enclose it in single quotes\", so we do.\n\n   Final answer: '5       651 '"
