    "original_reasoning": "We are given three functions: f1, f2, f3.\n We are to compute: f3(f2(f1('a_A_b_B3 ')))\n\n Step 1: Compute f1('a_A_b_B3 ')\n   f1(text):\n     try:\n        while 'nnet lloP' in text:\n            text = text.replace('nnet lloP', 'nnet loLp')\n     finally:\n        return text\n\n   The input string is 'a_A_b_B3 '. There is no occurrence of 'nnet lloP' in this string.\n   Therefore, the while loop does nothing, and f1 returns the same string: 'a_A_b_B3 '\n\n Step 2: Compute f2(f1('a_A_b_B3 ')) = f2('a_A_b_B3 ')\n   f2(text):\n     t = text   -> t = 'a_A_b_B3 '\n     for i in text:   -> we iterate over each character in the string 'a_A_b_B3 '\n\n        text = text.replace(i, '')   -> This replaces every occurrence of the current character i in text with an empty string.\n\n     However, note that the loop iterates over the original characters of the string, but the string is being modified in the loop.\n\n     Let's break down the loop:\n\n        Original text = 'a_A_b_B3 ' (length 10)\n        We are going to iterate over each character in the original string (which is stored in the variable that the loop is using). \n        But note: the loop variable `i` is taken from the original `text` at the start of the loop? Actually, in Python, the for-loop iterates over the original sequence. However, in this case, the variable `text` is being modified inside the loop, but the loop is iterating over the original string that was in `text` at the time of entering the loop.\n\n        The original string: 'a_A_b_B3 ' has the characters: \n          'a', '_', 'A', '_', 'b', '_', 'B', '3', ' '\n\n        But note: there are duplicate characters (like '_' and space is unique). \n\n        The loop will run for each of the 10 characters? Actually, the original string has 10 characters? \n          'a', '_', 'A', '_', 'b', '_', 'B', '3', ' ' -> but wait, let's count: \n          'a_A_b_B3 ' -> \n            a, _, A, _, b, _, B, 3, space -> that's 9? Actually, the string is 'a_A_b_B3 ' -> \n            a, _, A, _, b, _, B, 3, space -> 9 characters? But the string has 9? \n\n        Actually, let me write: \n          s = 'a_A_b_B3 '\n          len(s) -> 9? because: \n            a, _, A, _, b, _, B, 3, space -> 9.\n\n        However, the problem says: 'a_A_b_B3 ' -> note the space at the end, so it's 9 characters.\n\n        Now, the loop iterates over each character in the original string (which is 9 characters). But note: the string is being reduced in the loop.\n\n        The operation: \n          For each character i in the original string (which is fixed as the 9 characters), we do:\n            text = text.replace(i, '')\n\n        However, if we remove a character that appears multiple times, then when we later encounter the same character again, it might have been removed already.\n\n        But note: the loop runs for each of the 9 characters, regardless of the current state of `text`.\n\n        Let's simulate:\n\n          Initially: text = 'a_A_b_B3 ', t = 'a_A_b_B3 '\n\n          i = first character: 'a'\n            replace 'a' with '' -> text becomes '_A_b_B3 '\n\n          i = second character: '_' (from the original string, which had an underscore at index1)\n            replace '_' with '' -> text becomes 'AbB3 '   (because there were three underscores, all removed)\n\n          i = third character: 'A' (from the original string)\n            replace 'A' with '' -> text becomes 'bB3 '\n\n          i = fourth character: '_' (from the original string, but note: we have already removed underscores, so replacing '_' again? But there are none left) -> text remains 'bB3 '\n\n          i = fifth character: 'b' (from the original string)\n            replace 'b' with '' -> text becomes 'B3 '\n\n          i = sixth character: '_' (again, same as above) -> no change\n\n          i = seventh character: 'B' (from the original string)\n            replace 'B' with '' -> text becomes '3 '\n\n          i = eighth character: '3' (from the original string)\n            replace '3' with '' -> text becomes ' '\n\n          i = ninth character: ' ' (space)\n            replace ' ' with '' -> text becomes ''\n\n        So after the loop, text becomes an empty string.\n\n        Then the function returns: str(len(text)) + t = str(len('')) + 'a_A_b_B3 ' = \"0\" + \"a_A_b_B3 \" = \"0a_A_b_B3 \"\n\n        Therefore, f2 returns \"0a_A_b_B3 \"\n\n Step 3: Compute f3(f2(...)) = f3(\"0a_A_b_B3 \")\n   f3(text):\n     rtext = list(text)   -> converts the string into a list of characters: \n          ['0', 'a', '_', 'A', '_', 'b', '_', 'B', '3', ' ']   (but note: the string is \"0a_A_b_B3 \" -> 10 characters? \n          because we have \"0\" at the beginning and then the original 9? Actually, the original t was 9, and we added \"0\", so 10 characters)\n\n     Then, we have a loop for i in range(1, len(rtext) - 1):\n          The current length of rtext is 10, so the range is from 1 to 9-1? i.e., 1 to 8 (inclusive).\n\n          We are going to insert a pipe '|' at position i+1? But note: we are inserting at increasing indices and also the list is growing.\n\n          Let's simulate step by step:\n\n          Initially: rtext = ['0','a','_','A','_','b','_','B','3',' ']\n\n          i=1: \n            insert '|' at index 2 (because i+1 = 2). \n            Now the list becomes: \n                ['0','a', '|', '_','A','_','b','_','B','3',' ']   -> length becomes 11\n\n          i=2: \n            now i=2, insert at index 3 (i+1=3)\n            list: ['0','a','|','_','|','A','_','b','_','B','3',' '] -> length 12\n\n          i=3: \n            insert at index 4 (i+1=4)\n            list: ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','b','_','B','3',' '] -> length 13\n\n          i=4: \n            insert at index 5 (i+1=5)\n            list: ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','_','B','3',' '] -> length 14\n\n          i=5: \n            insert at index 6 (i+1=6) -> but note: the current list has 14 elements? Actually, we started at 10 and then added one for each i from 1 to 4 (so 4 added so far) -> 14? \n            Actually, we are at i=5 (which is the fifth iteration, and we are going to insert at index 6? \n            The current list: \n                indices: \n                  0: '0'\n                  1: 'a'\n                  2: '|'\n                  3: '_'\n                  4: '|'\n                  5: 'A'\n                  6: '|'   -> we are going to insert at index 6? Then shift the rest?\n            After insertion at index6: \n                ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','|','_','b','_','B','3',' '] -> wait, let me break:\n\n                ... up to index5: 'A' at index5, then at index6 we insert '|', so the current element at index6 (which was the next) becomes index7.\n\n          Actually, it's easier to note that we are inserting at increasing indices, but the insertion positions are relative to the current state of the list.\n\n          However, note the loop range: \n            for i in range(1, len(rtext)-1) \n          But the length of rtext is changing. The original length was 10, so the range was range(1,9) -> i from 1 to 8 inclusive? But we are modifying the list and the range is fixed? \n\n          Actually, the range is fixed at the beginning: \n            range(1, len(rtext)-1) = range(1, 10-1) = range(1,9) -> i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 -> 8 iterations.\n\n          We have to do 8 insertions.\n\n          We have already done for i=1,2,3,4 -> 4 insertions. Now:\n\n          i=5: insert at index 6 (i+1=6) in the current list which has 10+4=14 elements? \n            Actually, the list after 4 insertions: \n                indices: \n                  0: '0'\n                  1: 'a'\n                  2: '|'   (inserted at i=1: position2)\n                  3: '_'\n                  4: '|'   (inserted at i=2: position3)\n                  5: 'A'\n                  6: '|'   (inserted at i=3: position4) -> wait, no: \n                  Correction: \n                    Initially: \n                      i=1: insert at index2 -> so after insertion: \n                         [0,1,2,3,...,9] becomes [0,1,2,3,...,10]? \n                    Actually, we have to track the positions.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the loop runs 8 times (i from 1 to 8). We are inserting a pipe at position i+1 in the current list, but note that the index at which we insert is increasing by 1 each time? But also the list is growing.\n\n          However, the problem is that the index we are inserting at is relative to the current list. And the current list is getting longer by one each time we insert. Also, the index we are inserting at is i+1, but i is the loop variable that is fixed (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8). \n\n          But wait: the index we are inserting at is i+1, but note that the list is being modified. However, the value of i is fixed for each iteration. So:\n\n            Iteration 1: i=1 -> insert at index 2 (the third element) -> regardless of the current length, we insert at index2.\n\n            Iteration 2: i=2 -> insert at index 3.\n\n            Iteration 3: i=3 -> insert at index 4.\n\n            ... until i=8: insert at index9.\n\n          But note: the list is growing, so the positions beyond the insertion point are shifting.\n\n          How does it look?\n\n          Start: \n            list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]  (10 elements, we label the positions by index)\n\n          i=1: insert at index2 -> \n            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] becomes [0,1,|,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> now the list has 11 elements.\n\n          i=2: insert at index3 -> \n            [0,1,|,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] becomes [0,1,|,2,|,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> 12 elements.\n\n          i=3: insert at index4 -> \n            [0,1,|,2,|,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] becomes [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> 13 elements.\n\n          i=4: insert at index5 -> \n            becomes [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,6,7,8,9] -> 14 elements.\n\n          i=5: insert at index6 -> \n            becomes [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,|,6,7,8,9] -> 15 elements.\n\n          i=6: insert at index7 -> \n            becomes [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,|,6,|,7,8,9] -> 16 elements.\n\n          i=7: insert at index8 -> \n            becomes [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,|,6,|,7,|,8,9] -> 17 elements.\n\n          i=8: insert at index9 -> \n            becomes [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,|,6,|,7,|,8,|,9] -> 18 elements.\n\n          Now, in our case, the original list was the characters of \"0a_A_b_B3 \" (10 characters). We are inserting 8 pipes? \n\n          But note: the original string was 10 characters, and we are inserting 8 pipes? Then the final string should be 18 characters.\n\n          How does the string look?\n\n          Original: \"0a_A_b_B3 \" -> \n            Without pipes: \"0a_A_b_B3 \" -> 10 characters.\n\n          We are inserting a pipe after the first character? Actually, the insertion positions:\n\n            After the first character (index0) we don't insert? \n            We start at i=1: which corresponds to the second character? \n\n            The insertions are at indices: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? But note: the list indices are 0-indexed.\n\n          So:\n\n            Start: \n              index0: '0'\n              index1: 'a'\n              index2: '_'   -> after inserting at index2 (which is after the first two characters? because index2 is the third element? but we are inserting at index2, meaning before the current element at index2? \n\n          Actually, the insertion at index2 means that the new element is placed at index2, and the element that was at index2 is shifted to index3.\n\n          So the string becomes:\n\n            Original: \n              positions: 0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '_', 3: 'A', 4: '_', 5: 'b', 6: '_', 7: 'B', 8: '3', 9: ' '\n\n            After inserting at index2: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: 'A', 5: '_', 6: 'b', 7: '_', 8: 'B', 9: '3', 10: ' ']\n\n            Then at index3: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: '|', 5: 'A', 6: '_', 7: 'b', 8: '_', 9: 'B', 10: '3', 11: ' ']\n\n            Then at index4: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: '|', 5: 'A', 6: '|', 7: '_', 8: 'b', 9: '_', 10: 'B', 11: '3', 12: ' ']\n\n            Then at index5: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: '|', 5: 'A', 6: '|', 7: '_', 8: '|', 9: 'b', 10: '_', 11: 'B', 12: '3', 13: ' ']\n\n            Then at index6: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: '|', 5: 'A', 6: '|', 7: '_', 8: '|', 9: 'b', 10: '|', 11: '_', 12: 'B', 13: '3', 14: ' ']\n\n            Then at index7: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: '|', 5: 'A', 6: '|', 7: '_', 8: '|', 9: 'b', 10: '|', 11: '_', 12: '|', 13: 'B', 14: '3', 15: ' ']\n\n            Then at index8: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: '|', 5: 'A', 6: '|', 7: '_', 8: '|', 9: 'b', 10: '|', 11: '_', 12: '|', 13: 'B', 14: '|', 15: '3', 16: ' ']\n\n            Then at index9: \n              [0: '0', 1: 'a', 2: '|', 3: '_', 4: '|', 5: 'A', 6: '|', 7: '_', 8: '|', 9: 'b', 10: '|', 11: '_', 12: '|', 13: 'B', 14: '|', 15: '3', 16: '|', 17: ' ']\n\n          Now, we join the list: \n            \"0a|_||A||_||b||_||B||3| \"\n\n          But wait, let me write it step by step:\n\n            After first insertion: \"0a|_A_b_B3 \"\n            After second: \"0a|_||A_b_B3 \" -> no, that doesn't match.\n\n          Actually, we are inserting at the current index. Let me write the list as it builds:\n\n            Start: \n              ['0','a','_','A','_','b','_','B','3',' ']\n\n            i=1: insert at index2 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','A','_','b','_','B','3',' ']\n\n            i=2: insert at index3 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','_','b','_','B','3',' ']\n\n            i=3: insert at index4 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','b','_','B','3',' ']\n\n            i=4: insert at index5 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','_','B','3',' ']\n\n            i=5: insert at index6 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','B','3',' ']\n\n            i=6: insert at index7 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','|','B','3',' ']\n\n            i=7: insert at index8 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','|','B','|','3',' ']\n\n            i=8: insert at index9 -> \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','|','B','|','3','|',' ']\n\n          Now, join: \n            \"0a|_||A|_||b|_||B|3| \"\n\n          But note: the original string had an underscore after the 'a', then an 'A', then an underscore, then a 'b', then an underscore, then a 'B', then a '3', then a space.\n\n          In the list:\n\n            '0','a','|','_','|','|','A','|','_','|','|','b','|','_','|','|','B','|','3','|',' ' -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n          Actually, let me write the list we built:\n\n            ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','|','B','|','3','|',' ']\n\n          So the string is: \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          But note: the original string had an underscore after the 'a'? Yes, so after 'a' we had an underscore, but in the list we have:\n\n            '0','a','|','_','|','A' -> so that becomes \"0a|_|A\"\n\n          Then next: '|','_','|','b' -> \"|_|b\"\n\n          Then: '|','_','|','B' -> \"|_|B\"\n\n          Then: '|','3','|',' ' -> \"|3| \"\n\n          So the entire string: \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          However, note that in the original string, there were three underscores: \n            after 'a', after 'A', and after 'b'. \n\n          And we see that we have inserted pipes in between.\n\n          But wait, the original string was \"0a_A_b_B3 \" -> \n            This becomes: \n              \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          However, the last part: we have a pipe after the '3' and then a space? \n\n          But note: the last insertion was at index9? In the original list of 10, the last element was at index9 (the space). We inserted a pipe at index9, so the space moves to index10? and then we have the space at the end.\n\n          So the string is: \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          But note: the space at the end is still there? \n\n          In the list: the last element is the space, and we inserted a pipe before the space? \n\n          So the last two characters are: '|' and then space.\n\n          Therefore, the string is: \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          However, let me count the pipes: \n            We inserted 8 pipes? and the original string had 10 characters? Then total 18 characters? \n            \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \" -> \n              0, a, |, _, |, A, |, _, |, b, |, _, |, B, |, 3, |, space -> 18 characters.\n\n          So the result of f3 is \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          But note: the original string in f3 was \"0a_A_b_B3 \" (10 characters). We inserted 8 pipes? Then 10+8=18.\n\n          However, the problem says: \n            assert f3(f2(f1('a_A_b_B3 '))) == \n\n          We must output the string: \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          But wait: the space at the end is included? Yes.\n\n          However, let me write without spaces: \n            \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \" -> note the trailing space.\n\n          But the original string had a space at the end, and we inserted a pipe before that space? So the last two are pipe and space.\n\n          Therefore, the output is: '0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| '\n\n          However, note that in the list we built, the last element is the space, and we inserted a pipe at the position that was the space? So the pipe comes before the space? \n\n          The list: \n            ... at the end: \n            ... '3' is at index15, then we inserted a pipe at index16? and then the space is at index17? \n\n          Actually, in the last step:\n\n            Before the last insertion (i=8), the list had 17 elements? (because we started at 10 and added 7 pipes -> 17). Then we insert at index9? \n\n            But wait, the list at the start of the last iteration has 17 elements? Then we are inserting at index9? \n\n            The list at that point: \n              positions 0 to 16: \n                0: '0'\n                1: 'a'\n                2: '|'\n                3: '_'\n                4: '|'\n                5: 'A'\n                6: '|'\n                7: '_'\n                8: '|'\n                9: 'b'\n                10: '|'\n                11: '_'\n                12: '|'\n                13: 'B'\n                14: '|'\n                15: '3'\n                16: ' '\n\n            Now we insert at index9: meaning we insert a pipe between the element at index8 and index9? \n            So we split between the '|' at index8 and the 'b' at index9? \n\n            But wait, the current index9 is 'b'. We insert a pipe at index9, so the 'b' moves to index10? \n\n            Then the list becomes:\n\n              indices 0-8: same\n                9: '|' (new)\n                10: 'b' (moved from 9)\n                11: '|' (was 10)\n                12: '_' (was 11)\n                13: '|' (was 12)\n                14: 'B' (was 13)\n                15: '|' (was 14)\n                16: '3' (was 15)\n                17: ' ' (was 16)\n\n            So the last part: ... '|' (at index9), then 'b', then '|', then '_', ... until the end: \n              ... '3' at index16 and space at index17? \n\n            But then we have: \n              ... 'B' at index14, then '|' at index15, then '3' at index16, then space at index17.\n\n            So the string from index14 to 17: 'B', '|', '3', ' ' -> so we have \"B|3 \" at the end? \n\n            But we expected a pipe after the '3'? \n\n            Actually, we did not insert a pipe after the '3'. We inserted a pipe at index9, which is in the middle.\n\n            How did we get the pipe at the end? \n\n          Correction: I think I made a mistake in the simulation. The loop runs for i from 1 to 8 (8 iterations). We are inserting at position = i+1. \n\n          The positions we insert are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. \n\n          The last insertion is at index9. In the list that has 17 elements (after 7 insertions), the valid indices are 0 to 16. \n\n          Inserting at index9: that is within [0,16] (so it's the 10th element? because index0 is first). \n\n          The element that was at index9 is moved to index10, and we put a pipe at index9.\n\n          So the last part of the list after the last insertion:\n\n            ... index8: we have the element that was originally at index8? \n            ... index9: pipe (inserted)\n            ... index10: the element that was at index9 (which is the 'b')? \n\n          But wait, in the list after 7 insertions, the element at index9 was the 'b'? \n\n          Actually, in the list after 7 insertions (i=1 to i=7) we have:\n\n            We started with 10 elements and added 7 -> 17 elements.\n\n            The original string: \"0a_A_b_B3 \" -> \n              Without pipes: \n                index0: '0'\n                index1: 'a'\n                index2: '_'\n                index3: 'A'\n                index4: '_'\n                index5: 'b'\n                index6: '_'\n                index7: 'B'\n                index8: '3'\n                index9: ' '\n\n            Then we inserted pipes at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8? \n\n            How the list builds:\n\n              Step0: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] (the original 10)\n\n              Step1 (i=1): insert at2 -> \n                 [0,1,|,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> now the element at index2 is the pipe, and the original index2 becomes index3.\n\n              Step2 (i=2): insert at3 -> \n                 [0,1,|,2,|,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> now the element originally at index3 (which was 'A') is now at index4? \n\n              Step3 (i=3): insert at4 -> \n                 [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> now the element originally at index4 (which was '_') is now at index5? \n\n              Step4 (i=4): insert at5 -> \n                 [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,6,7,8,9] -> now the element originally at index5 (which was 'b') is now at index6? \n\n              Step5 (i=5): insert at6 -> \n                 [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,|,6,7,8,9] -> now the element originally at index6 (which was '_') is now at index7? \n\n              Step6 (i=6): insert at7 -> \n                 [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,|,6,|,7,8,9] -> now the element originally at index7 (which was 'B') is now at index8? \n\n              Step7 (i=7): insert at8 -> \n                 [0,1,|,2,|,3,|,4,|,5,|,6,|,7,|,8,9] -> now the element originally at index8 (which was '3') is now at index9? \n\n            So after 7 insertions, the list has 17 elements, and the space (originally at index9) is now at index17? \n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n              index0: '0'\n              index1: 'a'\n              index2: '|'\n              index3: '_'   (original index2)\n              index4: '|'\n              index5: 'A'   (original index3)\n              index6: '|'\n              index7: '_'   (original index4)\n              index8: '|'\n              index9: 'b'   (original index5)\n              index10: '|'\n              index11: '_'   (original index6)\n              index12: '|'\n              index13: 'B'   (original index7)\n              index14: '|'\n              index15: '3'   (original index8)\n              index16: ' '   (original index9)\n\n            Now we do the last insertion (i=8): insert at index9? \n              We insert a pipe at index9, so:\n\n              index0: '0'\n              index1: 'a'\n              index2: '|'\n              index3: '_'\n              index4: '|'\n              index5: 'A'\n              index6: '|'\n              index7: '_'\n              index8: '|'\n              index9: '|'   (new pipe)\n              index10: 'b'   (shifted from index9)\n              index11: '|'\n              index12: '_'\n              index13: '|'\n              index14: 'B'\n              index15: '|'\n              index16: '3'\n              index17: ' '\n\n            So the string becomes: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n            Now, note: we have two consecutive pipes at index8 and index9: \"||\" between the underscore (at index7) and the 'b' (at index10). \n\n            So the string: \n              \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n          Therefore, the final result is: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n          But wait, the space is at the end? Yes, at index17.\n\n          So the string: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n          However, note that the original string had a space at the end, and we did not lose it.\n\n          But in the string above, we have a space at the end? \n\n          The last character is at index17: space.\n\n          So the string is: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \" (with a space at the end).\n\n          But in the representation, we write the space as a space. \n\n          Therefore, the output is: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          However, let me check the length: \n            Original: 10, plus 8 insertions -> 18. \n            The string \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \" has 18 characters? \n            Let me count: \n              \"0\", \"a\", \"|\", \"_\", \"|\", \"A\", \"|\", \"_\", \"|\", \"|\", \"b\", \"|\", \"_\", \"|\", \"B\", \"|\", \"3\", \" \" -> 18.\n\n          So the final answer is: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          But note: the two consecutive pipes: that's because we inserted a pipe at the position where the 'b' was, and then the 'b' moved to the next. \n\n          This matches the simulation.\n\n          Therefore, we output: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          However, note that the original string in f2 was \"0a_A_b_B3 \" (with a space at the end). And we did not remove the space? \n\n          Yes.\n\n          So the final answer for the entire expression: f3(f2(f1('a_A_b_B3 '))) is '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          But wait, the problem says: \n            \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement. \n             If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n          So we output: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          However, note that the space at the end is included.\n\n          But in the representation, we must write the space as a space.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write the string exactly.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"enclose it in single quotes\", so we write the string inside single quotes.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          But wait, the space at the end is important. We have 18 characters, and the last character is a space.\n\n          So we write: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          However, in the simulation, the last character is a space, so we have to include it.\n\n          But note: the original test case: 'a_A_b_B3 ' -> has a space at the end, and we preserved it.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer is: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          But let me double-check the f2 function: \n            We had: \n              f2('a_A_b_B3 ') -> \n                t = 'a_A_b_B3 '\n                Then we remove every occurrence of each character in the original string? \n                The original string: 'a_A_b_B3 ' -> \n                  We remove: \n                    'a' -> becomes '_A_b_B3 '\n                    '_' -> becomes 'AbB3 '\n                    'A' -> becomes 'bB3 '\n                    '_' (again) -> no change? \n                    'b' -> becomes 'B3 '\n                    '_' -> no change\n                    'B' -> becomes '3 '\n                    '3' -> becomes ' '\n                    ' ' -> becomes ''\n                Then we return: str(len('')) + 'a_A_b_B3 ' = \"0\" + \"a_A_b_B3 \" = \"0a_A_b_B3 \"\n\n          So the input to f3 is \"0a_A_b_B3 \" (10 characters: '0','a','_','A','_','b','_','B','3',' ')\n\n          Then f3: \n            We break into list: \n              ['0','a','_','A','_','b','_','B','3',' ']\n\n            Then we insert pipes at indices: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? \n\n            The list has 10 elements, indices 0 to 9.\n\n            Insertion at index2: \n              ['0','a','|','_','A','_','b','_','B','3',' '] -> 11\n            Insertion at index3: \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','_','b','_','B','3',' '] -> 12\n            Insertion at index4: \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','b','_','B','3',' '] -> 13\n            Insertion at index5: \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','_','B','3',' '] -> 14\n            Insertion at index6: \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','B','3',' '] -> 15\n            Insertion at index7: \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','|','B','3',' '] -> 16\n            Insertion at index8: \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','|','B','|','3',' '] -> 17\n            Insertion at index9: \n              ['0','a','|','_','|','A','|','_','|','b','|','_','|','B','|','3','|',' '] -> 18\n\n          Now, join: \n            \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          But wait, this is different from the previous simulation? \n\n          Why? Because in the previous simulation for f3 we started with the string \"0a_A_b_B3 \" and we broke it into 10 characters. Then we inserted at the fixed indices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? \n\n          In the above, we did:\n\n            Insertion at index2: after the first two characters? \n              \"0a\" -> then insert pipe -> \"0a|\", then the rest: \"_A_b_B3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_A_b_B3 \"\n\n            Then insertion at index3: in the new list, the third character is now '_'? \n              We insert after the third character? \n              \"0a|_A_b_B3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_|A_b_B3 \"\n\n            Then insertion at index4: \n              \"0a|_|A_b_B3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_|A|_b_B3 \"\n\n            Then insertion at index5: \n              \"0a|_|A|_b_B3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_|A|_|b_B3 \"\n\n            Then insertion at index6: \n              \"0a|_|A|_|b_B3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_|A|_|b|_B3 \"\n\n            Then insertion at index7: \n              \"0a|_|A|_|b|_B3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B3 \"\n\n            Then insertion at index8: \n              \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3 \"\n\n            Then insertion at index9: \n              \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3 \" -> becomes \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3| \"\n\n          But note: the space at the end is still there? \n\n          In the last step, we inserted at index9: \n            The string at that point was 17 characters: \n              \"0a|_|A|_|b|_|B|3 \" -> 17 characters? \n              Actually, we started with 10, then added 7 pipes -> 17, then we add one more -> 18.\n\n          The last insertion: at index9? \n            The string: \n              positions: \n                0:0, 1:a, 2:|, 3:_, 4:|, 5:A, 6:|, 7:_, 8:|, 9:b, 10:|, 11:_, 12:|, 13:B, 14:|, 15:3, 16:space\n\n            We insert at index9: so we break between the element at index8 and index9? \n            That is, between the pipe at index8 and the 'b' at index9? \n\n            So we get: \n              ... up to index8: pipe, then insert a pipe at index9, then the rest: starting with 'b' at index10.\n\n            So the string becomes: \n              ... index8: pipe, index9: pipe (new), index10: 'b', ... \n\n            So we have two consecutive pipes: at index8 and index9? \n\n            Then the string: \n              \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n          But wait, the space is at the end? \n\n          Yes, at index17.\n\n          So the final string: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n          This matches the second simulation.\n\n          Therefore, the result is: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n          But note: the space at the end is included? \n\n          In the string above, the last character is a space? \n\n          Actually, the last character is at index17: space.\n\n          So the string is: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \" (with a space at the end).\n\n          How do we write it? \n            The string: \n              starts: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n            and ends with a space.\n\n          But in the representation, we write the space as a space.\n\n          Therefore, the output is: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          However, note that the two pipes in the middle: that's because we inserted a pipe at the position of the 'b', so we have a pipe and then the 'b'. But wait, we inserted a pipe between the pipe at index8 and the 'b' at index9? So we get two consecutive pipes? \n\n          Yes: \"|\" (from index8) and then another \"|\" (inserted at index9) -> \"||\", then the 'b'.\n\n          So the string has: \"0a|_|A|_||b\" meaning: \n            \"0a|_|A|_\" followed by \"||\" and then \"b\".\n\n          Therefore, the final answer is: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          We'll output that.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information\", so we output exactly:\n\n          '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          However, let me write it without ambiguity:\n\n          The string: \n            character0: '0'\n            character1: 'a'\n            character2: '|'\n            character3: '_'\n            character4: '|'\n            character5: 'A'\n            character6: '|'\n            character7: '_'\n            character8: '|'\n            character9: '|'   (this is the extra pipe we inserted at the last step)\n            character10: 'b'\n            character11: '|'\n            character12: '_'\n            character13: '|'\n            character14: 'B'\n            character15: '|'\n            character16: '3'\n            character17: ' '\n\n          So the string: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \"\n\n          But note: the space at the end is character17.\n\n          So we write: \"0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 \" -> but this representation does not show the space at the end? \n\n          Actually, it does: the last character is a space.\n\n          Therefore, the output string is: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '\n\n          We enclose in single quotes.\n\n          Final Answer: '0a|_|A|_||b|_|B|3 '"
