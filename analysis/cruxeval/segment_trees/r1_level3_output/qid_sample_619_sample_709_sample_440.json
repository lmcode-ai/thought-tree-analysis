Or the entire assert statement?\n\n The problem says: \"complete the assert statement\" but then says \"Only return the output of the function\"\n\n Let me read again: \"complete the assert statement with the output ... Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\n But then: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n This is a bit confusing. However, the example output format says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n And the example of the output is just the string.\n\n So I think we are to output only the string representation of the result, which is 'no'\n\n However, note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\", meaning we are to write the right-hand side of the assert.\n\n But then it says \"Only return the output of the function\", meaning the value that the function returns.\n\n Since the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\", and the example output format is just the string in quotes, we output:\n\n 'no'\n\n But wait, let me double-check the functions:\n\n f1: \n   Input: '   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  '\n   Output: '   rock   paper   scissors  '\n\n f2: \n   Input: '   rock   paper   scissors  '\n   split() -> ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'] (because split without argument removes leading/trailing and collapses consecutive spaces)\n   Then sort in reverse: \n        sorted(['rock','paper','scissors']) in ascending: ['paper','rock','scissors'] -> then reverse: ['scissors','rock','paper']\n   Then join: 'scissors rock paper'\n\n f3: \n   Input: 'scissors rock paper'\n   This is not a decimal string -> returns 'no'\n\n Therefore, the answer is 'no'\n\n However, note: what if the split doesn't work as expected? The string has multiple spaces. \n The function str.split() with no arguments splits on any whitespace and removes any empty strings from the result.\n\n So it is safe.\n\n But note: what if the string had non-space whitespace? The problem doesn't specify, but the input has only spaces.\n\n So we output: 'no'"
