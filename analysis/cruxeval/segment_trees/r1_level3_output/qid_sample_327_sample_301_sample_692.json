But there are no zeros. So we append every element: \n        a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]\n   Step 3: a.reverse() -> becomes [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1] again.\n\n   But wait, the function f3 is intended to remove zeros? The condition is: if array[i] != 0, then append.\n   Since there are no zeros, it returns the same as the reversed of the reversed? Actually, note:\n\n   The function does:\n      array.reverse() -> so the array becomes reversed.\n      Then it iterates and collects non-zero elements in order (from the reversed array) into a list 'a'.\n      Then it reverses 'a' to get the original order of non-zero elements? Actually, the non-zero elements in the reversed array are collected in the order of the reversed array, then reversed again.\n\n   However, note: \n        Original array (after reversing) is [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]\n        Then we collect non-zero: [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,7,1,-3] -> same as the reversed array.\n        Then we reverse that list: becomes [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> which is the original array without any change? \n\n   But wait, the original array for f3 was [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. After reversing, we get [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,7,1,-3]. \n   Then we remove zeros (none) and then reverse the collected list: \n        a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,7,1,-3] -> then reverse: [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n   So the output of f3 is the same as the input? \n\n   However, note the purpose of f3: it reverses the array, then collects non-zero elements (in the order of the reversed array) and then reverses that collection. \n   This is equivalent to: \n        removing zeros from the original array? \n\n   But in our case, there are no zeros. So it returns the original array? \n\n   But wait: \n        Original array: [1, 0, 2] \n        Step1: reverse -> [2,0,1]\n        Step2: collect non-zero: [2,1] \n        Step3: reverse -> [1,2] -> which is the non-zero elements in the original array in the same order? \n        Actually, no: the original array without zeros is [1,2] but the function returns [1,2]? \n        But note: the original array without zeros and in the original order is [1,2]? \n        However, the function does: \n            reverse: [2,0,1] -> then collect non-zero: [2,1] -> then reverse: [1,2] -> which is the non-zero elements in the original order? \n        But the original array had [1,0,2] -> non-zero in order: [1,2]. So it matches.\n\n   Therefore, f3 removes zeros and returns the non-zero elements in the original order.\n\n   In our case, there are no zeros so the array remains the same.\n\n   So the final result is [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n But note: the problem says to output the result as the assert expects. We must write the list.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we output: [-3, 1, 7, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" - but this is a list.\n\n We write the list exactly.\n\n However, let me check the functions again for any off-by-one.\n\n Another look at f2: \n   The loop: for i in range(-count+1, 0) \n        count = 4 -> -4+1 = -3 -> so i in [-3, -2, -1] -> that's 3 iterations.\n\n   But note: the list is being extended during the loop. The indices are negative and relative to the current end.\n\n   The first extension: when the list is 4 elements, we use index -3 -> which is the first element? \n        Actually, for a list of 4: \n            index 0: -3, index 1:1, index2:7, index3:-1.\n            negative: \n                -1: index3 -> -1\n                -2: index2 -> 7\n                -3: index1 -> 1\n            So we extend with [1,1] -> correct.\n\n   Then the list becomes 6 elements: \n        indices: 0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3:-1, 4:1, 5:1.\n        Now we use i=-2: \n            -1: index5 -> 1\n            -2: index4 -> 1\n        So extend with [1,1] -> becomes 8 elements.\n\n   Then i=-1: \n        now the list has 8 elements: \n            indices: 0: -3, 1:1, 2:7, 3:-1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1.\n        i=-1: index7 -> 1 -> extend with [1,1] -> 10 elements.\n\n   So the output of f2 is a list of 10 elements: [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n   Then f3: \n        reverses to [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,7,1,-3] -> then removes zeros (none) -> then reverses the collected list -> \n        collected list is [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,7,1,-3] -> reversed: [-3,1,7,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n   So the final result is indeed [-3, 1, 7, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n    assert f3(f2(f1([1, 7, -1, -3]))) == [-3, 1, 7, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete the assert statement with the output\", meaning we only output the value.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we output: [-3, 1, 7, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\n We are confident.\n\n However, note: the function names in the code are all named 'f'. But in the problem, we have three functions: f1, f2, f3, and the code defines each as 'def f(...)'. \n But the problem uses f1, f2, f3. We assume that the functions are defined as f1, f2, f3? \n\n Actually, the code comments say:\n    # f1\n    def f(lst):\n    ...\n\n    # f2\n    def f(nums):\n    ...\n\n    # f3\n    def f(array):\n    ...\n\n This would cause a redefinition of f. But the problem says \"based on the given Python code\", so we must assume that the functions are defined separately and named appropriately? \n However, the code as given would not run because of the redefinition. \n\n But note: the problem says \"which may contain errors\", but we are to compute the output as per the given logic.\n\n We are to assume that the functions are defined as f1, f2, f3? Or that they are three separate functions named f? \n\n The problem states: \n    assert f3(f2(f1([1, 7, -1, -3]))) == \n\n So we assume that the functions are named f1, f2, f3. The code provided uses the same function name 'f' for all, but that is an error. \n However, the problem says \"based on the given Python code\", so we must use the logic as provided, but with the understanding that they are distinct functions.\n\n Therefore, we proceed with the computation as above.\n\n Final answer: [-3, 1, 7, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"
