Then we are joining these two strings with a space in between: \"avdropj\" + \" \" + \"gsd  \" -> \"avdropj gsd  \"\n\n   But note: the function f1 returns a string of two parts: the first part is the reversed first token (which is 7 letters) and the second part is the second token (which is 3 letters) padded to 5 with spaces.

But wait: group7 is 5 spaces. So when we output group7, we are outputting a string of 5 spaces. Then we put a space before and after? Then the entire string has:\n\n            ... + group6 + ' ' + group7 + ' ' + group8 + ... So the substring becomes: group6 + ' ' + group7 + ' ' + group8 = \"jjjjj\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"ggggg\"\n\n          That is: \"jjjjj  ggggg\" but with 1+5+1=7 spaces? Actually, no: the group7 is 5 spaces, so the substring is:\n\n            \"jjjjj\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"ggggg\" -> which is \"jjjjj      ggggg\" (with 1 space, then 5 spaces, then 1 space: total 7 spaces between \"jjjjj\" and \"ggggg\").

    "original_reasoning": "We are given three functions: f1, f2, f3 (but note that in the code they are all named 'f', but in the problem they are labeled as f1, f2, f3).\n We are to compute: f3(f2(f1('gsd avdropj')))\n\n Step 1: Compute f1('gsd avdropj')\n   f1 (the first function) is defined as:\n     def f(tokens):\n         tokens = tokens.split()\n         if len(tokens) == 2:\n             tokens = list(reversed(tokens))\n         result = ' '.join([tokens[0].ljust(5), tokens[1].ljust(5)])\n         return result\n\n   Input: 'gsd avdropj'\n   tokens.split() -> ['gsd', 'avdropj'] (length 2, so reverse)\n   tokens becomes ['avdropj', 'gsd']\n   Then: tokens[0].ljust(5) -> 'avdropj'.ljust(5) -> since 'avdropj' is 7 characters, it remains 'avdropj' (with no extra spaces because 7>5, so just the string)\n          tokens[1].ljust(5) -> 'gsd'.ljust(5) -> 'gsd  ' (because we are left-justifying to 5, so we add 2 spaces at the end)\n   Then we join with a space: 'avdropj' + ' ' + 'gsd  ' -> 'avdropj gsd  '\n\n   However, note that the function does: ' '.join([tokens[0].ljust(5), tokens[1].ljust(5)])\n   So it's: tokens[0].ljust(5) is \"avdropj\" (which is 7 characters) and tokens[1].ljust(5) is \"gsd  \" (5 characters: 'g','s','d',' ',' ').\n   Then we are joining these two strings with a space in between: \"avdropj\" + \" \" + \"gsd  \" -> \"avdropj gsd  \"\n\n   But note: the function f1 returns a string of two parts: the first part is the reversed first token (which is 7 letters) and the second part is the second token (which is 3 letters) padded to 5 with spaces. Then we put a space between them.\n\n   So the output of f1 is: \"avdropj gsd  \"\n\n Step 2: Compute f2 on the output of f1, i.e., f2(\"avdropj gsd  \")\n   f2 is defined as:\n     def f(text):\n         t = 5\n         tab = []\n         for i in text:\n             if i.lower() in 'aeiouy':\n                 tab.append(i.upper() * t)\n             else:\n                 tab.append(i * t)\n         return ' '.join(tab)\n\n   This function iterates over each character in the string \"avdropj gsd  \" and:\n     - if the character is a vowel (in 'aeiouy'), then it appends the uppercase version of that character repeated 5 times.\n     - otherwise, it appends the character repeated 5 times.\n\n   Then it returns the list of these strings joined by a space.\n\n   Let's break down the string: \"avdropj gsd  \" (note: there are two spaces at the end)\n\n   We'll go character by character:\n\n   'a': vowel -> 'A' * 5 -> 'AAAAA'\n   'v': not vowel -> 'v' * 5 -> 'vvvvv'\n   'd': not vowel -> 'd' * 5 -> 'ddddd'\n   'r': not vowel -> 'r' * 5 -> 'rrrrr'\n   'o': vowel -> 'O' * 5 -> 'OOOOO'\n   'p': not vowel -> 'p' * 5 -> 'ppppp'\n   'j': not vowel -> 'j' * 5 -> 'jjjjj'\n   ' ': not vowel -> ' ' * 5 -> '     ' (5 spaces)\n   'g': not vowel -> 'g' * 5 -> 'ggggg'\n   's': not vowel -> 's' * 5 -> 'sssss'\n   'd': not vowel -> 'd' * 5 -> 'ddddd'\n   ' ': not vowel -> ' ' * 5 -> '     ' (5 spaces)\n   ' ': not vowel -> ' ' * 5 -> '     ' (5 spaces)   [because there are two spaces at the end]\n\n   Now, we join these with a space. So we have a list of 13 elements (each element is a string of 5 characters). We are going to put a space between each element.\n\n   The result of f2 will be:\n     \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n   But note: the last two are two groups of 5 spaces, and then one more group of 5 spaces? Actually, the input string has 12 characters? Let me count:\n\n     \"avdropj gsd  \" -> \n        a, v, d, r, o, p, j, (space), g, s, d, (space), (space) -> 13 characters.\n\n   So the output string will be 13 strings (each of length 5) separated by a space. The total length would be 13*5 + 12 (the 12 spaces in between) = 65 + 12 = 77.\n\n   However, we can write it as:\n\n     'AAAAA' + ' ' + 'vvvvv' + ' ' + ... and so on.\n\n   Specifically, the string is:\n\n     \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n   But note the last part: the last three groups are for the two spaces at the end of the input. The input had two consecutive spaces at the end. So we have:\n\n     ... + 'ddddd' + ' ' + '     ' + ' ' + '     '\n\n   So the last three groups are: 'ddddd', then the first space (from the two at the end) becomes 5 spaces, then the next space (the last character) becomes 5 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the entire string is:\n\n     \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n   But note: the two consecutive spaces in the input become two groups of 5 spaces each, and they are separated by a space in the output? Actually, the output of f2 is a space between every group. So the two groups of 5 spaces (from the two consecutive spaces) are separated by a space? Then we have:\n\n     ... jjjjj [space] [5 spaces] [space] [5 spaces] [space] [5 spaces]? \n\n   Wait, let me clarify: the input string has 13 characters. We break it into 13 groups. Then we output 13 groups, each group is 5 of the same character (or 5 spaces for the space character). Then we join these 13 groups by a space.\n\n   So the output string will have 13 groups, each of 5 characters, and between each group there is a space. Therefore, the entire string has 13*5 + 12 = 77 characters.\n\n   The groups:\n\n     0: 'AAAAA'\n     1: 'vvvvv'\n     2: 'ddddd'\n     3: 'rrrrr'\n     4: 'OOOOO'\n     5: 'ppppp'\n     6: 'jjjjj'\n     7: '     '   (5 spaces)  -> from the first space in the input (which is the 8th character)\n     8: 'ggggg'\n     9: 'sssss'\n     10: 'ddddd'\n     11: '     '   (5 spaces) -> from the first of the two trailing spaces (the 12th character)\n     12: '     '   (5 spaces) -> from the last trailing space (the 13th character)\n\n   Then we join with a space:\n\n     \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n   But note: the last part is: ... ddddd [space] [5 spaces] [space] [5 spaces] -> so the last two groups are two sets of 5 spaces, and they are separated by a space? Actually, the entire string is:\n\n     \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd      \"   ... but wait, we have 13 groups, so the last group is the 12th index, and we have 12 spaces in between? \n\n   Actually, the string is:\n\n     group0 + ' ' + group1 + ' ' + ... + ' ' + group12\n\n   So the last three groups (groups 10, 11, 12) are:\n\n        ... + 'ddddd' + ' ' + '     ' + ' ' + '     '\n\n   So the last part is: \"ddddd           \" -> meaning: \"ddddd\" (from group10) then a space, then group11 (5 spaces) then a space, then group12 (5 spaces). So that's 5 (from ddddd) + 1 (space) + 5 (spaces) + 1 (space) + 5 (spaces) = 5+1+5+1+5 = 17 characters at the end? But note the entire string is 77.\n\n   We can write the entire string as:\n\n     \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd      \" \n\n   But that doesn't have 77 characters. Let me count:\n\n     AAAAA -> 5, then space -> 1 (total 6)\n     then vvvvv -> 5, then space -> 1 (total 12)\n     ... until the last group.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that there are 13 groups of 5, and 12 spaces in between: 13*5 + 12 = 65+12=77.\n\n   The exact string is:\n\n     \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n   But note: the last part is \"dddddd           \"? Actually, no: the last three groups are:\n\n        group10: 'ddddd' (5)\n        group11: '     ' (5 spaces)\n        group12: '     ' (5 spaces)\n\n   And they are separated by spaces. So the last part is: \"ddddd      \" (meaning: \"ddddd\" + space + 5 spaces + space + 5 spaces) -> but that would be:\n\n        \"ddddd\" (5) + \" \" (1) + \"     \" (5) + \" \" (1) + \"     \" (5) -> total 5+1+5+1+5 = 17.\n\n   So the entire string is:\n\n        \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd      \" \n\n   But wait, the last part is \"ddddd      \"? Actually, we have:\n\n        ... sssss [space] ddddd [space] [5 spaces] [space] [5 spaces]\n\n   So the last part is: ... sssss ddddd           -> meaning:\n\n        ... sssss (group9) -> then a space -> then ddddd (group10) -> then a space -> then group11 (5 spaces) -> then a space -> then group12 (5 spaces).\n\n   But that would be 3 spaces in the last part? Actually, the entire string has 12 spaces as separators. And the groups are 13.\n\n   The string: \n        group0: AAAAA\n        group1: vvvvv\n        group2: ddddd\n        group3: rrrrr\n        group4: OOOOO\n        group5: ppppp\n        group6: jjjjj\n        group7: [5 spaces]\n        group8: ggggg\n        group9: sssss\n        group10: ddddd\n        group11: [5 spaces]\n        group12: [5 spaces]\n\n   So the string is:\n\n        \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n   How many characters at the end? The last three groups (10,11,12) are represented as:\n\n        \"ddddd\" (group10) + \" \" (separator) + \"     \" (group11) + \" \" (separator) + \"     \" (group12)\n\n   So the last 17 characters are: \"ddddd      \" -> but wait, that's 5 (ddddd) + 1 (space) + 5 (spaces) + 1 (space) + 5 (spaces) = 17, which is \"ddddd           \"? Actually, if we write:\n\n        \"ddddd\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"     \" -> becomes \"ddddd      \"? \n\n   Actually, it becomes: \"ddddd  \" (with 5+5=10 spaces? no, because we have two separators and two groups of 5 spaces). \n\n   Let me write:\n\n        group10: \"ddddd\"\n        then a space: so we have \"ddddd \"\n        then group11: 5 spaces -> so we have \"ddddd      \" (because 5 spaces) -> now total 5+1+5 = 11\n        then a space: so we have \"ddddd       \" (11+1=12)\n        then group12: 5 spaces -> \"ddddd           \" (12+5=17)\n\n   So the last 17 characters are: \"ddddd           \" (which is 17 characters: 5 letters and 12 spaces? but note: the 5 letters, then a space, then 5 spaces, then a space, then 5 spaces -> that's 5+1+5+1+5=17).\n\n   Therefore, the entire string is:\n\n        \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n   But note: the group7 is 5 spaces, so we have:\n\n        ... jjjjj [space] [5 spaces] [space] ggggg ...\n\n   So after jjjjj, we have a space, then 5 spaces (which in the string will look like 5 spaces) then a space, then ggggg.\n\n   So the part for group7 and the separators: \" jjjjj      ggggg\" -> that's: \n        jjjjj (5) + space (1) + 5 spaces (5) + space (1) + ggggg (5) -> total 17 characters? but we are writing it as a string: \"jjjjj      ggggg\" -> that's 5 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 17? but visually, the 5 spaces in group7 look like 5 spaces, so the string has: \"jjjjj\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"ggggg\" -> which is \"jjjjj      ggggg\" (because the 5 spaces in the middle are contiguous).\n\n   So the entire string is:\n\n        \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the output of f2, i.e., f3(\"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \")\n\n   f3 is defined as:\n     def f(text):\n         text = text.split(' ')\n         for t in text:\n             if not t.isnumeric():\n                 return 'no'\n         return 'yes'\n\n   This function splits the input string by space (so we get a list of tokens) and then checks every token: if any token is not numeric, it returns 'no'. If all are numeric, returns 'yes'.\n\n   The input string is: \"AAAAA vvvvv ... ddddd           \" (the long string we got from f2).\n\n   We split by space: so we split the string at every space. The string has many spaces. How many tokens?\n\n   The string is built by joining 13 groups with a space. So when we split by space, we get exactly the 13 groups? But note: the string also has groups that are 5 spaces (like group7, group11, group12). When we split by space, we get:\n\n        token0: \"AAAAA\"\n        token1: \"vvvvv\"\n        token2: \"ddddd\"\n        token3: \"rrrrr\"\n        token4: \"OOOOO\"\n        token5: \"ppppp\"\n        token6: \"jjjjj\"\n        token7: \"\"   ??? -> wait, group7 is 5 spaces? but in the string, we have: ... jjjjj[space][5 spaces][space]ggggg...\n\n   Actually, the string has:\n\n        ... \"jjjjj      ggggg\" ...\n\n   But note: the group7 is 5 spaces, and we have:\n\n        ... jjjjj (group6) + space (separator) + group7 (which is 5 spaces) + space (separator) + ggggg (group8) ...\n\n   So the entire substring is: \"jjjjj      ggggg\" -> which is: \"jjjjj\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"ggggg\" -> but when we split the entire string by space, we split at every space. So:\n\n        The entire string: \n          \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj      ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n        Splitting by space:\n\n          - The first 6 tokens: \"AAAAA\", \"vvvvv\", \"ddddd\", \"rrrrr\", \"OOOOO\", \"ppppp\", \"jjjjj\"\n          - Then we have: after \"jjjjj\", there is a space -> so we get \"jjjjj\" and then the next token is the next non-space? but note: the next part is 5 spaces? and then a space? \n\n        Actually, the string after \"jjjjj\" is: \"      ggggg ...\" -> but note: the exact sequence is:\n\n          ... \"jjjjj\" + \" \" (separator) + \"     \" (group7: 5 spaces) + \" \" (separator) + \"ggggg\" ...\n\n        So when we split the entire string by space, we split at every single space. Therefore, the 5 spaces of group7 become 5 consecutive spaces? and splitting by space will give empty tokens? Actually, no: because the split function in Python, when splitting by space, will consider consecutive spaces as multiple separators. So:\n\n          \"a  b\".split(' ') -> ['a', '', 'b']   (if we have two spaces, we get an empty string in the middle)\n\n        But note: the group7 is 5 spaces, and it is surrounded by two spaces (the separators we added in f2). So the substring is:\n\n          ... \"jjjjj\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"ggggg\" ...\n\n        That is: \"jjjjj      ggggg\" -> but note: the entire substring is: \"jjjjj (space)(5 spaces)(space)ggggg\" -> which is \"jjjjj       ggggg\" (with 7 spaces in between? because 1+5+1=7?).\n\n        Actually, the exact substring is:\n\n          group6: \"jjjjj\"\n          then a space (from the join) -> so we have \"jjjjj \"\n          then group7: 5 spaces -> so we have \"jjjjj      \" (5 spaces added to the existing space? no, the group7 is 5 spaces, so we have: \"jjjjj \" (from the first separator) and then we append 5 spaces (from group7) and then a space (the next separator) and then \"ggggg\". \n\n        So the entire substring is: \"jjjjj       ggggg\" (with 7 spaces: 1 from the separator after jjjjj, then 5 from group7, then 1 from the separator after group7).\n\n        Now, when we split by space, we get:\n\n          - \"jjjjj\" -> token\n          - then 7 spaces: so we get 7 separators? and we get 6 empty tokens? Actually, no: the split function in Python with a single space as the delimiter will split at every single space. So:\n\n            \"a       b\".split(' ') -> ['a', '', '', '', '', '', 'b']   (because there are 7 spaces: so 7 separators, which create 8 tokens? but note: the string starts with non-space and ends with non-space. Actually, the example: \"a       b\" has 7 spaces between 'a' and 'b'. Then split gives: ['a'] + (7 times splitting: 6 empty tokens? but actually, the split function: consecutive spaces produce consecutive empty tokens?).\n\n        However, the documentation: str.split(sep) with a specified sep, consecutive delimiters are not grouped. So:\n\n            \"a   b\".split(' ') -> ['a', '', '', 'b']   (if there are three spaces, we get two empty strings in the middle).\n\n        Therefore, for 7 consecutive spaces, we get 6 empty strings.\n\n        But wait: our substring is: \"jjjjj       ggggg\" -> that's 7 spaces. So we split as:\n\n            token0: \"jjjjj\"\n            token1: \"\" (from the first space)\n            token2: \"\" (from the second space)\n            token3: \"\" (from the third space)\n            token4: \"\" (from the fourth space)\n            token5: \"\" (from the fifth space)\n            token6: \"\" (from the sixth space)\n            token7: \"ggggg\"\n\n        However, note: the 7 spaces are actually: the first space is the separator after group6, then the next 5 are the group7 (which is 5 spaces) and then the next space is the separator after group7. But in the entire string, we are splitting by space, so every space is a separator.\n\n        Therefore, the entire string split by space will produce:\n\n          - The first 6 tokens (from the first 6 groups) are non-empty: \"AAAAA\", \"vvvvv\", ... , \"jjjjj\"\n          - Then we have 7 consecutive spaces? Actually, the entire string is built by:\n\n            group0 + ' ' + group1 + ' ' + ... + ' ' + group12\n\n          So the separators are single spaces. Therefore, the entire string does not have consecutive spaces? because we are joining with a single space. So the groups are separated by exactly one space. Therefore, the string does not have consecutive spaces? \n\n          But wait: group7 is 5 spaces. So when we output group7, we are outputting a string of 5 spaces. Then we put a space before and after? Then the entire string has:\n\n            ... + group6 + ' ' + group7 + ' ' + group8 + ...\n\n          So the substring becomes: group6 + ' ' + group7 + ' ' + group8 = \"jjjjj\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"ggggg\"\n\n          That is: \"jjjjj  ggggg\" but with 1+5+1=7 spaces? Actually, no: the group7 is 5 spaces, so the substring is:\n\n            \"jjjjj\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"ggggg\" -> which is \"jjjjj      ggggg\" (with 1 space, then 5 spaces, then 1 space: total 7 spaces between \"jjjjj\" and \"ggggg\").\n\n          Therefore, when we split the entire string by space, we get:\n\n            tokens = [\n                \"AAAAA\", \n                \"vvvvv\", \n                \"ddddd\", \n                \"rrrrr\", \n                \"OOOOO\", \n                \"ppppp\", \n                \"jjjjj\", \n                \"\",   # from the first space after jjjjj\n                \"\",   # from the first of the 5 spaces (which is a space, so it becomes an empty token because it is between two spaces)\n                \"\",   # from the next space in the 5\n                \"\",   # \n                \"\",   # the last of the 5 spaces\n                \"\",   # from the space after the group7 (which is the separator after group7)\n                \"ggggg\",\n                ... and so on for the rest\n            ]\n\n          Actually, the 7 consecutive spaces (between \"jjjjj\" and \"ggggg\") will split into 8 tokens? but note: the split function: \n\n            s = \"a       b\" -> split by space: ['a', '', '', '', '', '', 'b'] -> 7 spaces give 7+1 = 8 tokens? but wait, 7 separators create 8 tokens. However, in our case, the substring is \"jjjjj       ggggg\", which has 7 spaces. Then we get:\n\n                token0: \"jjjjj\"\n                token1: \"\" (from the first space)\n                token2: \"\" (from the second space)\n                token3: \"\" (from the third space)\n                token4: \"\" (from the fourth space)\n                token5: \"\" (from the fifth space)\n                token6: \"\" (from the sixth space)\n                token7: \"ggggg\"\n\n          So 8 tokens? Actually, the split of \"a       b\" (with 7 spaces) gives:\n\n            ['a', '', '', '', '', '', 'b'] -> that's 7 tokens? or 8? \n\n          Let me test in Python:\n\n            s = \"a       b\"\n            print(s.split(' ')) \n\n          Output: ['a', '', '', '', '', '', 'b'] -> that is 7 tokens: \n            token0: 'a'\n            token1: '' (from the space after 'a')\n            token2: '' (from the next space)\n            ...\n            token6: 'b'\n\n          But wait, there are 7 spaces? and we get 8 tokens? Actually, the string \"a       b\" has 7 spaces, which are 7 separators, and they split the string into 8 parts. But the parts are:\n\n            part0: \"a\"\n            part1: \"\" (between first and second space)\n            part2: \"\" (between second and third)\n            ...\n            part7: \"b\"\n\n          So we get 8 tokens.\n\n          However, in our case, the entire string is:\n\n            \"AAAAA vvvvv ddddd rrrrr OOOOO ppppp jjjjj       ggggg sssss ddddd           \"\n\n          The part \"jjjjj       ggggg\" is 7 spaces, so we get 8 tokens from that segment.\n\n          And then at the end: \"ddddd           \" -> that is: \"ddddd\" + 11 spaces? Actually, the last part: \n\n            ... + \"ddddd\" (group10) + ' ' (separator) + group11 (5 spaces) + ' ' (separator) + group12 (5 spaces)\n\n          So the substring: \"ddddd      \" -> but wait, we have:\n\n            \"ddddd\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"     \" -> \"ddddd           \" (with 1+5+1+5 = 12 spaces? no, because the separators are single spaces, and the groups are 5 spaces. So the entire substring is: \"ddddd\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"     \" -> which is \"ddddd      \" (with 1 space, then 5 spaces, then 1 space, then 5 spaces) -> total 1+5+1+5 = 12 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the string is: \"ddddd\" + \" \" + group11 + \" \" + group12 -> \"ddddd  \" (with 5 spaces from group11 and 5 from group12, and two separators? but note: the separators are single spaces, so we have:\n\n            \"ddddd\" (5) + \" \" (1) + \"     \" (5) + \" \" (1) + \"     \" (5) -> total 5+1+5+1+5 = 17 characters: \"ddddd           \" (with 12 spaces? no, 1+5+1+5 = 12? but wait, the entire substring is 5 letters and 12 spaces? 5+12=17).\n\n          Now, when we split the entire string by space, the last part \"ddddd           \" (17 characters) will be split by space. We have:\n\n            \"ddddd           \" -> split by space: \n\n              - \"ddddd\" is the first token.\n              - then we have 12 consecutive spaces? -> which will split into 13 tokens? \n\n          Actually, the entire string has:\n\n            ... + \"ddddd\" (from group10) + \" \" (separator) + group11 (which is 5 spaces) + \" \" (separator) + group12 (5 spaces)\n\n          So the entire string has:\n\n            ... + \"ddddd\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"     \"\n\n          Then when we split by space, we get:\n\n            ... , \"ddddd\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\",   (from the group11: 5 spaces -> 5 separators? but wait, the group11 is 5 spaces, and it is surrounded by two separators? so we have 7 consecutive spaces? no, we have:\n\n            The substring: \"ddddd\" + \" \" (separator) + \"     \" (group11) + \" \" (separator) + \"     \" (group12)\n\n          So the entire substring: \"ddddd  \" (with 1 space, then 5 spaces, then 1 space, then 5 spaces) -> that's 1+5+1+5 = 12 spaces? and the letters \"ddddd\". Then when we split by space, we get:\n\n            token for \"ddddd\", then the next token is the first space after ddddd -> that splits to an empty token? \n\n          Actually, the substring: \"ddddd  \" (with 12 spaces) is not exactly 12 spaces, but 12 spaces in the entire substring including the separators? \n\n          Let me break the substring:\n\n            character0: 'd'\n            character1: 'd'\n            ... \n            character4: 'd'\n            character5: ' ' (separator after group10)\n            character6: ' ' (first space of group11)\n            character7: ' ' (second space of group11)\n            character8: ' ' (third space of group11)\n            character9: ' ' (fourth space of group11)\n            character10: ' ' (fifth space of group11)\n            character11: ' ' (separator after group11)\n            character12: ' ' (first space of group12)\n            character13: ' ' (second space of group12)\n            character14: ' ' (third space of group12)\n            character15: ' ' (fourth space of group12)\n            character16: ' ' (fifth space of group12)\n\n          So when we split by space, we start:\n\n            token0: \"ddddd\" (from index0 to 4)\n            then we have a space at index5 -> so token1: \"\" (for the part between index5 and the next non-space? but the next is space)\n            then we have a space at index6 -> token2: \"\"\n            index7 -> token3: \"\"\n            index8 -> token4: \"\"\n            index9 -> token5: \"\"\n            index10 -> token6: \"\"   (because from index5 to index10: 6 consecutive spaces? but wait, we have: \n                index5: space -> token1: for the part from index5 to index6? no, split by space: the delimiter is each space.\n\n          Actually, the split function will consider:\n\n            - at index5: we have a space -> so we split, and the token from the start (which was \"ddddd\") is done, and the next token starts at index6. But at index6 we have a space, so the next token is from index6 to the next space? \n\n          This is messy. Instead, note: the entire string is built by joining 13 groups with a space. So the string has 12 spaces (the separators) and 13 groups. But the groups themselves may contain spaces? only group7, group11, group12 are spaces. \n\n          When we split the entire string by space, we are splitting at every space, including the separators and the spaces within the groups. So we will get many tokens, including empty ones.\n\n          Specifically, the entire string has:\n\n            - The groups that are non-space: they are strings of 5 non-space characters -> they become one token each when split by space? but wait, they are surrounded by spaces? so they will be tokens.\n\n            - The groups that are 5 spaces: when we split by space, they become 5 consecutive spaces? and then we get 4 empty tokens for a group of 5 spaces? Actually, a string of 5 consecutive spaces, when split by space, gives 6 empty tokens? \n\n          But note: a string of n consecutive spaces, when split by space, gives n+1 empty tokens? Actually, no: \n\n            Example: \"     \".split(' ') -> ['', '']? \n\n          Let me test:\n\n            s = \"     \"   # 5 spaces\n            s.split(' ') -> ['', '']   ??? \n\n          Actually, in Python:\n\n            >>> \"     \".split(' ')\n            ['', '', '', '', '', '']\n\n          Why? Because the split of 5 consecutive spaces by space gives 6 empty strings: the string is split at the first space -> we get two parts: left is empty, right is the remaining 4 spaces. Then the right is split again, and so on.\n\n          So 5 consecutive spaces split by space gives 6 empty strings.\n\n          Therefore, for group7 (which is 5 spaces) we get 6 empty tokens.\n\n          Similarly, group11 and group12 (each 5 spaces) will give 6 empty tokens each.\n\n          But wait, group7 is not isolated: it is surrounded by spaces? Actually, in the entire string, group7 is preceded by a space (the separator after group6) and followed by a space (the separator before group8). So the substring is: \n\n            ... + \" \" + group7 + \" \" + ...\n\n          = ... + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + ... -> which is 7 consecutive spaces? \n\n          And 7 consecutive spaces split by space gives 8 empty tokens.\n\n          Similarly, the last part: group10 is \"ddddd\", then a space (separator), then group11 (5 spaces), then a space (separator), then group12 (5 spaces). So we have:\n\n            \"ddddd\" + \" \" + \"     \" + \" \" + \"     \"\n\n          = \"ddddd           \" (17 characters: 5 letters and 12 spaces) -> but when split by space, we get:\n\n            - \"ddddd\" -> token0\n            - then 12 consecutive spaces? -> which will give 13 empty tokens? \n\n          Actually, 12 consecutive spaces split by space gives 13 empty tokens.\n\n          But note: the entire string is long. We don't need to count every token. We only care if every token is numeric.\n\n          The tokens we get from the split are:\n\n            - The non-space groups: \"AAAAA\", \"vvvvv\", \"ddddd\", \"rrrrr\", \"OOOOO\", \"ppppp\", \"jjjjj\", \"ggggg\", \"sssss\", \"ddddd\" (from group10) -> these are all non-numeric (they are letters).\n\n          And then we have empty tokens and possibly more.\n\n          The function f3 checks: for each token in the split list, if the token is not numeric, return 'no'. \n\n          The first token is \"AAAAA\", which is not numeric -> so f3 will return 'no' immediately.\n\n          Therefore, the output of f3 is 'no'.\n\n Conclusion:\n\n   f3(f2(f1('gsd avdropj'))) -> 'no'\n\n But let me double-check with the first token: \n\n   The string we are splitting in f3 is: \"AAAAA vvvvv ...\" \n\n   The first token when we split by space is \"AAAAA\", which is not numeric -> so we return 'no'.\n\n Therefore, the answer is 'no'."
