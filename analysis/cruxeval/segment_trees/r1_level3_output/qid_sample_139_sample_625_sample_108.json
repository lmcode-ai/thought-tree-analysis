We iterate over each character in the string 'no':\n        'n' -> not in '.?!. ,' -> skip\n        'o' -> not in '.?! .,' -> skip\n\n   So count remains 0. Therefore, f2 returns 0.

Since 0 is not a list and not a dict:\n        amount = 0 (because type(var)==int, so the first condition fails -> amount=0 from the else part of the ternary) Then we check if it's a dict? It's not, so amount remains 0.\n        nonzero = 0 (because amount is 0, so we take the else branch: 0) Therefore, f3 returns 0. So the entire expression: f3(f2(f1([1,2,1], [1,1,2]))) returns 0.",
