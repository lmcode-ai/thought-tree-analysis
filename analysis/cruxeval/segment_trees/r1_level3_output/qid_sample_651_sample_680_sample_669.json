Here letter 'e' is lower, so becomes 'E'.\n     Then, for each char in text:\n        if char == letter.lower() (which is 'e') then replace with letter (which is 'E')\n        else keep the char.\n     Then return the string capitalized.\n\n   Let's break down f1:\n     Original text: 'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n     We replace every 'e' (lowercase) with 'E'. Note: the function does not replace uppercase 'E' because it checks for letter.lower() which is 'e'. So only the lowercase 'e's are replaced.\n\n     Original: 'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n     After replacement: \n        The first character is 'E' -> remains (because it's not 'e')\n        Then space -> remains\n        Then 'w' -> remains\n        Then 'r' -> remains\n        Then 'e' (at index 4) -> becomes 'E'\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Let's do the replacement:\n        'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n        becomes: \n          E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\n\n     Now, we capitalize the string: \n        The first character becomes uppercase and the rest lowercase? \n        But note: the string already has an uppercase at the beginning? \n        The capitalize() method makes the first character uppercase and the rest lowercase? \n        However, the current string starts with 'E' (uppercase) and then we have a space and then 'wrEstlEd' etc.\n\n     Actually, the capitalize() method in Python:\n        It returns a string where the first character is upper case, and the rest is lower case.\n\n     So after replacement we have: \"E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\"\n     After capitalize(): \n        First character: already uppercase? Then we make the rest of the string lowercase? \n        But note: the method does convert the rest to lowercase.\n\n     Therefore: \n        The entire string becomes: \"e wrestled evil until upperfeat\" but wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\n     Let me check: \n        Original after replacement: \"E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\"\n        After capitalize: \n            First character: 'E' -> remains (but note: the method will make the first character uppercase and the rest lowercase? \n            However, the first character is already uppercase. Then the rest of the string is converted to lowercase.\n\n        So: \n          The rest of the string: \" wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\" becomes all lowercase? \n          That would be: \" wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        So the entire string becomes: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        But wait, that is the same as the original? \n\n     However, note that we replaced the lowercase 'e's with 'E's and then we are capitalizing the entire string? \n        The original string started with an uppercase 'E'. Then we had a space and then a lowercase 'w'. \n        After replacement, we had: \n          \"E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\" \n        But note: the word \"Evil\" has an uppercase 'E' at the beginning? That was because we replaced the first 'e' in \"evil\" (which was at the start) with 'E'. \n        However, when we capitalize the entire string, the first character becomes uppercase and the rest become lowercase. \n        So the entire string becomes: \n          \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        Why? Because after replacement we have:\n          \"E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\" \n        becomes: \n          First character: 'E' -> remains uppercase.\n          The rest: \n            \" wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\" -> converted to lowercase: \" wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        So the result of f1 is: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n     But wait, that doesn't seem to have changed? \n\n     Let me reexamine the replacement step: \n        We are replacing every occurrence of 'e' (lowercase) with 'E'. \n        In the original string: \n          'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n          The positions of lowercase 'e': \n            at index 4: 'e' in \"wrestled\" -> becomes 'E'\n            at index 8: 'e' in \"wrestled\" -> becomes 'E'\n            at index 11: 'e' in \"evil\" -> becomes 'E' (so \"evil\" becomes \"Evil\")\n            at index 15: 'i' -> not replaced\n            ... until the last part: \"upperfeat\"\n            at index 24: 'e' in \"upperfeat\" -> becomes 'E'\n            at index 28: 'e' in \"upperfeat\" -> becomes 'E'? Actually, let's count:\n\n          \"upperfeat\": \n            u p p e r f e a t -> positions: \n            in the substring \"upperfeat\", the 'e's are at the 4th and 7th characters (0-indexed: index 4 and 7 of the substring). \n            In the whole string, the substring \"upperfeat\" starts at index 20? \n            Original: \n              'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n              Let's break:\n                E (0) \n                space (1)\n                wrestled -> 8 letters: w r e s t l e d -> indices 2 to 9? \n                then space (10)\n                evil -> e v i l -> indices 11 to 14? \n                then space (15) and \"until\" (16-20) then space (21) then \"upperfeat\" (22-30)\n\n            Actually, let's count the entire string: \n              s = 'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n              len(s) = 31? \n              Let me write: \n                E (0)\n                 (1)\n                w(2), r(3), e(4), s(5), t(6), l(7), e(8), d(9) -> so two e's at 4 and 8.\n                 (10)\n                e(11), v(12), i(13), l(14) -> one e at 11.\n                 (15)\n                u(16), n(17), t(18), i(19), l(20) -> no e.\n                 (21)\n                u(22), p(23), p(24), e(25), r(26), f(27), e(28), a(29), t(30)\n\n            So we replace:\n              index4: e -> E -> so \"wrestled\" becomes \"wrEstlEd\" (with E at index4 and E at index8? but note: index4 is the third letter? because the word starts at index2: w(2), r(3), e(4) -> becomes E -> so w r E ...)\n              index11: e -> E -> so \"evil\" becomes \"Evil\"\n              index25: e -> E -> in \"upperfeat\": becomes \"uppEr\"\n              index28: e -> E -> becomes \"feat\" -> \"fEat\"\n\n            So the string becomes: \n              \"E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\"\n\n        Now, when we do .capitalize(), the first character is made uppercase and the rest lowercase. \n        The first character is already 'E'. Then the rest of the string (from index1 to the end) is converted to lowercase. \n        So: \n          index1: space -> remains\n          index2: 'w' -> becomes 'w' (but in the replaced string at index2 we have 'w' -> remains? but then we are making it lowercase? but 'w' is uppercase? no, it's lowercase. \n          However, note: the rest of the string (after the first character) becomes all lowercase. \n          So: \n            \" wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\" becomes \" wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        Therefore, the entire string becomes: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        So f1 returns: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n Step 2: Compute f2 on the result of f1.\n   f2(text) = \n        It iterates over each character in text, and if the character is alphanumeric (letter or digit), it appends to 'letters'. \n        Then returns the string of these letters.\n\n        Input: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        We remove non-alphanumeric: \n          The spaces are not alphanumeric, so we remove them.\n\n        So the result is: \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the result of f2.\n   f3(t) = \n        a, sep, b = t.rpartition('-')\n        This splits the string t by the last occurrence of '-' and returns:\n          a: the part before the last '-'\n          sep: the separator (which is '-')\n          b: the part after the last '-'\n\n        If there is no '-' in the string, then a and sep will be empty strings and b will be the whole string.\n\n        Then: \n          if len(b) == len(a): return 'imbalanced'\n          else: return a + b.replace(sep, '')\n\n        In our case, the string is \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\", which does not contain any '-'.\n\n        Therefore:\n          a = '' \n          sep = ''\n          b = \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n        Condition: len(b) == len(a) -> len(\"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\") is 26, len(a) is 0 -> 26 != 0 -> condition false.\n\n        Then we return: a + b.replace(sep, '') \n          Since sep is an empty string, replacing an empty string with nothing leaves the string unchanged.\n          So: '' + \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\" = \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n        Therefore, the final result is \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n However, let me double-check the steps.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \n   \"assert f3(f2(f1('E wrestled evil until upperfeat', 'e'))) == ...\"\n\n And we have computed: \n   f1: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\" -> becomes \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\" (same as input? because after replacing the lowercase e's and then capitalizing the entire string, we ended up with the same string? \n        Why? Because the replacement step turned some e's to E's, but then the capitalize step turned the entire string (after the first character) to lowercase, which turned those E's back to e's? \n\n        Actually, in the replacement step we did:\n          We replaced every lowercase 'e' with 'E'. Then we did:\n          text.capitalize() -> which does: \n            It converts the first character to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.\n\n          So the E's that we introduced in the middle (which were in the rest of the string) become lowercase again? \n\n        Therefore, the string after f1 is indeed the same as the input? \n\n        But note: the first character of the input was 'E' (uppercase) and the rest was a mix. After replacement, we had:\n          \"E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\"\n        Then after capitalize: \n          The first character is made uppercase (it already was) and the rest is made lowercase. \n          So the rest: \" wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\" becomes \" wrestled evil until upperfeat\" (because all the E's in the middle become lowercase e's).\n\n        So the result of f1 is the same as the input? \n\n        Therefore, f2 produces: \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n        And f3 produces: \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n        So the final answer is 'Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat'\n\n However, let me run the code in my mind for f1:\n\n   def f1(text, letter):\n      if letter.islower(): letter = letter.upper()   # letter becomes 'E'\n      text = ''.join([letter if char == letter.lower() else char for char in text])\n          # letter.lower() is 'e'\n          # so we replace every char that is 'e' with 'E'\n          # in the string: \n          #   'E wrestled evil until upperfeat'\n          #   The first char: 'E' -> not equal to 'e', so remains 'E'\n          #   Then space -> remains\n          #   Then 'w' -> remains\n          #   Then 'r' -> remains\n          #   Then 'e' (at index4) -> becomes 'E'\n          #   Then 's' -> remains\n          #   Then 't' -> remains\n          #   Then 'l' -> remains\n          #   Then 'e' (at index8) -> becomes 'E'\n          #   Then 'd' -> remains\n          #   Then space -> remains\n          #   Then 'e' (at index11) -> becomes 'E'\n          #   ... and so on.\n\n      So we get: \"E wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\"\n\n      Then we do: return text.capitalize()\n\n      What does capitalize do? \n        It makes the first character uppercase and the rest lowercase? \n        But note: the first character is already uppercase. Then the rest becomes lowercase? \n        So the rest: \" wrEstlEd Evil until uppErfEat\" becomes \" wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n        So the entire string becomes: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\"\n\n      Therefore, the output of f1 is the same as the input? \n\n      So then f2: \n          It removes non-alphanumeric: \n          The input to f2: \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\" -> becomes \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n      Then f3: \n          Since there is no '-', we return the entire string: \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n      So the final answer is 'Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat'\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\n We are to complete the assert statement with the output.\n\n However, note: the assert statement is given as:\n   assert f3(f2(f1('E wrestled evil until upperfeat', 'e'))) == \n\n And we are to output the string that the expression evaluates to.\n\n Therefore, the output is: 'Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat'\n\n But let me check the function f3 again: \n   In the case of no '-' in the string, we have:\n        a = '', sep = '', b = the whole string.\n        Then we do: a + b.replace(sep, '') -> '' + the whole string (because replacing empty string by nothing is the same string) -> the whole string.\n\n So the answer is: 'Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat'\n\n However, note: the function f2 might have a different behavior? \n   The function f2: \n        def f2(text):\n            letters = ''\n            for i in range(len(text)):\n                if text[i].isalnum():\n                    letters += text[i]\n            return letters\n\n   This indeed removes non-alphanumeric. The string \"E wrestled evil until upperfeat\" has non-alphanumeric: spaces. \n   So we remove the spaces and get: \"Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat\"\n\n Therefore, the final answer is 'Ewrestledeviluntilupperfeat'"
