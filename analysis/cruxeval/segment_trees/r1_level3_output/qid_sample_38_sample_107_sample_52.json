The rule for title() is that it considers words as sequences of letters and non-letters.\n        But the behavior for non-letters: the first letter after a non-letter is capitalized? Actually, the title() method is defined to capitalize the first alphabetic character of each word and make the rest lower. A word is a sequence of letters. Non-alphabetic characters are left as is and they break words.\n\n        Let's break down:\n          '1oE-err bzz-bmm' \n          Words: \n            \"1oE\" -> becomes \"1oe\" because the first alphabetic character is 'o' (which becomes 'O')? But note: the first character is '1' (non-letter) so the first letter is 'o' -> becomes 'O'. Then the rest of the letters in the word become lower? So \"1oE\" becomes \"1Oe\"?\n          Actually, let's test in Python (but we can't run, so we rely on documentation): \n          The title() method returns a string where the first character in every word is upper case and the rest is lower case.\n\n          How does it define a word? It splits by whitespace and also by non-alphanumeric? Actually, it uses a simple algorithm: it converts the first character of each \"word\" to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. The definition of a word is a consecutive sequence of letters. However, note that the standard title() method in Python has a known issue: it considers apostrophes and other non-space characters as word boundaries? Actually, no: the title() method doesn't use any linguistic definition. It simply turns the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase, where a word is a consecutive sequence of letters. Non-letters are considered as separators? Actually, no: the method doesn't split on non-letters. It just changes the case of letters. The rule: after a non-letter (or at the start) the next letter is turned to title case and the rest of the consecutive letters are turned to lower.\n\n          Example: \n            \"hello world\" -> \"Hello World\"\n            \"they're\" -> \"They'Re\"  (which is often not desired)\n\n          So for \"1oE-err bzz-bmm\":\n            '1oE': \n              The first character '1' is not a letter -> then the next character 'o' is the first letter -> becomes uppercase 'O'. Then the next letter 'E' becomes lowercase 'e'. So becomes \"1Oe\"\n            Then we have a dash, so the next word \"err\": first letter 'e' becomes 'E', then the rest 'rr' becomes 'rr' -> \"Err\"\n            Then space: so the next word \"bzz\": becomes \"Bzz\"\n            Then dash: then \"bmm\": becomes \"Bmm\"\n\n          So after title: \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\"\n\n          Then we remove spaces: replace(' ', '') -> \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n          But wait: the original string has two spaces? Actually, the string is: '1oE-err bzz-bmm'\n          There is one space: between 'err' and 'bzz'. So after title: \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\" -> removing the space: \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n          However, note that the example: \n            Original: '1oE-err bzz-bmm'\n            After title: \n              '1oE' -> becomes '1Oe' (because the first letter is 'o' -> becomes 'O', and the following letter 'E' becomes 'e')\n              '-err' -> the dash is non-letter, so the next letter 'e' becomes 'E', then 'rr' becomes 'rr' -> so the part becomes \"-Err\"\n              then space: so the next word is 'bzz' -> becomes 'Bzz'\n              then '-bmm' -> becomes '-Bmm'\n\n          So the entire string after title: \"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm\" -> then remove space: \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\"\n\n Step 2: Apply f2 on the result of f1: f2(\"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\")\n   f2(text):\n      result = []\n      for i in range(len(text)):\n          if not text[i].isascii(): \n             return False\n          elif text[i].isalnum():\n             result.append(text[i].upper())\n          else:\n             result.append(text[i])\n      return ''.join(result)\n\n   We traverse each character in \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\":\n      - '1': is ascii -> then check isalnum? Yes -> append '1'.upper() -> '1'\n      - 'O': is ascii -> isalnum? Yes -> append 'O'.upper() -> 'O'\n      - 'e': is ascii -> isalnum? Yes -> append 'E'\n      - '-': is ascii -> not alnum -> append '-'\n      - 'E': -> becomes 'E'\n      - 'r': -> becomes 'R'\n      - 'r': -> becomes 'R'\n      - 'B': -> becomes 'B'\n      - 'z': -> becomes 'Z'\n      - 'z': -> becomes 'Z'\n      - '-': -> '-'\n      - 'B': -> 'B'\n      - 'm': -> 'M'\n      - 'm': -> 'M'\n\n   So the result is: \"1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\"\n\n Step 3: Apply f3 on the result of f2: f3(\"1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\")\n   f3(text):\n      a = []\n      for i in range(len(text)):\n          if not text[i].isdecimal(): \n             a.append(text[i])\n      return ''.join(a)\n\n   This function removes any decimal digit? Actually, it appends the character if it is NOT a decimal digit.\n\n   Traverse \"1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\":\n      - '1': is decimal? Yes -> skip.\n      - 'O': not decimal -> append 'O'\n      - 'E': not decimal -> append 'E'\n      - '-': not decimal -> append '-'\n      - 'E': append 'E'\n      - 'R': append 'R'\n      - 'R': append 'R'\n      - 'B': append 'B'\n      - 'Z': append 'Z'\n      - 'Z': append 'Z'\n      - '-': append '-'\n      - 'B': append 'B'\n      - 'M': append 'M'\n      - 'M': append 'M'\n\n   So the result is: \"OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\"\n\n However, note: the function f3 removes only decimal digits? The condition is: if not text[i].isdecimal(). \n   The character '1' is a decimal digit -> removed.\n\n Therefore, the final result is: \"OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\"\n\n But wait: let's double-check the string: \n   Original after f2: \"1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\"\n   Removing the digit '1': becomes \"OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\"\n\n However, note that the string after f2 is \"1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\", and we remove the first character '1' (a digit) and keep the rest.\n\n But wait: the function f3 does not remove non-decimal digits? It removes only decimal digits? \n   The method `isdecimal()` returns True for characters that are in the category of decimal digits in Unicode, which includes '0' to '9'. \n   So the removal is only for digits.\n\n Therefore, the final output is: \"OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\"\n\n However, note that the original string had a dash and we kept it.\n\n But let's compare with the expected output? The problem says: complete the assert statement.\n\n We are to output the string: 'OE-ERRBZZ-BMM'\n\n However, note: the function f1, f2, f3 are defined and we have to compute the composition.\n\n But wait: there's a potential issue in f1: \n   The string after f1: we said \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\", but let me check the title() method on the substring \"1oE\": \n        In Python, the title() method for \"1oE\" becomes \"1Oe\" because:\n          - The first character '1' is not a letter -> then the next character 'o' is the first letter -> becomes uppercase 'O'\n          - Then the next letter 'E' becomes lowercase 'e'\n\n        So that is correct.\n\n   Then f2: we convert every alphanumeric to uppercase -> so \"1Oe\" becomes \"1OE\", and the rest accordingly.\n\n   Then f3: removes the digit '1', so we get \"OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\"\n\n However, note the string after f1: \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\" -> when we remove the space, we get \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\", but note that the original string had a space between 'err' and 'bzz'. After removing the space, we get \"ErrBzz\" without a space? So the string becomes \"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\". \n\n   Then in f2: we process each character without any problem.\n\n   Then f3: we remove the digit '1', so we get \"Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm\" but wait, no: in f2 we converted to uppercase so the string becomes \"1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\", then removing the digit '1' gives \"OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\".\n\n   But note: in the original f1 output, the 'e' in \"Oe\" was lowercase? Then in f2, we converted that 'e' to uppercase. So the string after f2 is \"1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\", and after removing the '1', we get \"OE-ERRBZZ-BMM\".\n\n Therefore, the final answer is: 'OE-ERRBZZ-BMM'\n\n However, let me write the steps again to be sure:\n\n   f1('1oE-err bzz-bmm') = \n        title: \n          '1oE' -> '1Oe'\n          '-err' -> '-Err'\n          ' ' -> space, then next word: 'bzz' -> 'Bzz'\n          '-bmm' -> '-Bmm'\n        So the string after title: '1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm'\n        Then remove spaces: '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'\n\n   f2('1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm') = \n        Traverse each char:\n          '1' -> alnum -> '1'\n          'O' -> alnum -> 'O'\n          'e' -> alnum -> 'E'\n          '-' -> not alnum -> '-'\n          'E' -> 'E'\n          'r' -> 'R'\n          'r' -> 'R'\n          'B' -> 'B'\n          'z' -> 'Z'\n          'z' -> 'Z'\n          '-' -> '-'\n          'B' -> 'B'\n          'm' -> 'M'\n          'm' -> 'M'\n        So we get: '1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM'\n\n   f3('1OE-ERRBZZ-BMM') = \n        Remove decimal digits: remove the '1', so we get: 'OE-ERRBZZ-BMM'\n\n So the final result is: 'OE-ERRBZZ-BMM'\n\n But note: the string after f1: the part \"ErrBzz\" becomes one word? Yes, because we removed the space. So in the string we have \"ErrBzz\", which in f2 becomes \"ERRBZZ\" (all uppercase).\n\n Therefore, the output is: 'OE-ERRBZZ-BMM'\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n So we output: 'OE-ERRBZZ-BMM'"
