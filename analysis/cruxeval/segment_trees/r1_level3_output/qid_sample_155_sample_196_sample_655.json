Let's break the input string \"dskjs hjcdjnxhjicnn\" into chunks of 4:\n\n     \"dskj\" -> first 4\n     \"s hj\" -> next 4 (note: the space is included)\n     \"cdjn\" -> next 4\n     \"xhji\" -> next 4\n     \"cnn\"  -> last 3 So the output of f1 should be:\n     \"dskj\\ns hj\\ncdjn\\nxhji\\ncnn\"\n\n   But note: the function f1 builds the string by iterating and adding a newline when i (the counter for the current line) equals n (4). Then it resets i to 0 and continues. Let's simulate:\n\n     i=0, out=''\n     c='d': i becomes 1 -> out='d'\n     c='s': i becomes 2 -> out='ds'\n     c='k': i becomes 3 -> out='dsk'\n     c='j': i becomes 4 -> then we add a newline and reset i to 0 -> then i becomes 1 and add 'j' -> out becomes \"dsk\\nj\" ... wait, that doesn't match. Actually, the function does:\n\n        if i == n:   # when i becomes equal to n (which is 4) then we add a newline and reset i to 0. then we do i += 1 and then add the current character. But note: the counter is incremented for every character, and the newline is added when the counter is exactly n (meaning we have already processed n characters in the current line). Then we reset the counter and then add the current character? Actually, the order is:\n\n        for c in ip:\n            if i == n:\n                out += '\\n'\n                i = 0\n            i += 1\n            out += c\n\n   So for the first character, i is 0 -> then we set i=1 and add 'd'. Then for the next character, i=1 -> then i=2 and add 's'. Then for the next, i=2 -> then i=3 and add 'k'. Then for the next, i=3 -> then i=4 and add 'j'. -> so far \"dskj\"\n\n   Then the next character: at the start of the loop, i=4 -> so we add a newline and set i=0. Then we do i+=1 -> i=1, and then add the next character which is 's'. So now we have \"dskj\\ns\"\n\n   Then next: i=1 -> becomes 2, then add the space: so we have \"dskj\\ns \" -> but note the string is \"dskjs hjcdjnxhjicnn\", so after 's' comes a space.",
