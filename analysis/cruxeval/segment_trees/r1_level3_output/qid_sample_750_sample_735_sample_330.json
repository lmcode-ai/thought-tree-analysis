The function iterates over each character in 'hbd':\n        For 'h': char_map.get('h') -> returns None (since {} has no key 'h') -> so add 'h'\n        For 'b': similarly, add 'b'\n        For 'd': similarly, add 'd'\n   So f1 returns 'hbd'\n\n Step 2: Compute f2('hbd')\n   f2 takes a sentence. Here, sentence is 'hbd'. It first checks if it's empty -> not. Then it removes '(' and ')': but there are none, so remains 'hbd'. Then it capitalizes: 'hbd'.capitalize() -> 'Hbd' (because capitalize makes the first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase) Then it removes spaces: there are none, so returns 'Hbd'\n\n Step 3: Compute f3('Hbd')\n   f3 takes a text and for each character:\n        'H': not a digit -> replace with space -> ' '\n        'b': not a digit -> space -> ' '\n        'd': not a digit -> space -> ' ' So it returns a string of three spaces: '   '\n\n Therefore, the result is three spaces.
