The string is 'a', which is alphanumeric.\n   So, it returns 'a'.\n\n Therefore, the final result is 'a'.\n\n However, note that the function f2 has a loop that runs 10 times. Let's look at f2 more carefully:\n\n   for _ in range(10):\n        for j in range(len(a)):\n            if a[j] != '#':\n                a = a[j:]   # This sets a to the substring starting at the first non '#' character and breaks the inner loop.\n                break\n        else:\n            # This else is for the inner for loop: it runs only if the inner loop did not break, meaning no non '#' was found.\n            a = \"\"\n            break\n\n   In our case, the string is 'a'. The inner loop finds at j=0 that 'a' != '#' -> so we set a = a[0:] which is 'a' and break the inner loop.\n   This happens 10 times, so the string remains 'a'.\n\n   Then, the while loop: while a[-1] == '#' -> remove the last character until the last character is not '#'.\n   Since the last character is 'a', we do nothing.\n\n   So, indeed, f2('a') returns 'a'.\n\n But what if the string were empty? Let's consider the edge cases.\n\n However, in our case, the input is non-empty and without any '#' at the beginning or end.\n\n Therefore, the output is 'a'.\n\n We write the answer as: 'a'"
