We are to complete the assert statement with the output.\n\n However, the problem says: \"complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case\"\n\n The expected output for the assert is the value that should be on the right-hand side of the equality.\n\n Since the expression returns True, we write:\n\n   assert f3(f2(f1([-1, 9, 3, 1, -2]))) == True\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n However, the instruction is to complete the assert statement. But then it says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n But the output in this case is a boolean (True). How should we represent it?\n\n Let me re-read: \"complete the assert statement with the output\"\n\n The output of the entire function chain is True.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n However, the example output format is not specified for non-strings. But the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" implying that for non-strings we don't.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\n And: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"complete the assert statement\" but then says \"Only return the output ... without any other information and assert statement\".\n\n This is a bit confusing.\n\n Clarification: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\" but then in the same breath says \"Only return the output ... without any other information and assert statement\".\n\n However, the example output format is given: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n So we are to output only the value that the expression evaluates to, and if it's a string we put quotes, otherwise not.\n\n Therefore, for this case, we output: True\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function\". The entire chain is a function composition, and the output is True.\n\n However, let me check the functions again for any mistake.\n\n In f1: \n   We reverse the list: [-2, 1, 3, 9, -1] -> then we convert to string: \n        [str(x) for x in [-2,1,3,9,-1]] -> ['-2','1','3','9','-1'] -> joining gives: '-2139-1'\n\n In f2:\n   We are removing non-numeric and non-special characters. The special characters are '\u00c4\u00e4\u00cf\u00ef\u00d6\u00f6\u00dc\u00fc'. \n   The string is '-2139-1'. The only non-numeric are the two '-' and they are not in the special set. \n   So we remove them -> '21391'\n\n In f3:\n   We check if every character in '21391' is numeric -> yes, so True.\n\n Therefore, the output is True.\n\n But note: what if the function chain returns a string? Then we would output it in quotes. But here it's a boolean.\n\n However, the problem does not specify how to output non-strings. But the example only says for string use quotes.\n\n So we output:\n\n   True\n\n without quotes.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\". The assert statement is:\n\n   assert f3(f2(f1([-1, 9, 3, 1, -2]))) == \n\n and we are to complete the right-hand side.\n\n So we are to write the value that the left-hand side evaluates to.\n\n Therefore, the answer is True.\n\n However, let me consider: what if the function chain returns a string? Then we would write it in quotes. But here it returns a boolean.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the output\" meaning the result of the entire expression.\n\n So we write:\n\n   True\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information\", so we just output:\n\n   True\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we are not to write the entire assert, only the value that should be on the right-hand side.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   True\n\n But wait: what if the function chain returns a number? Then we output the number without quotes.\n\n Since the problem does not specify for booleans, and True is a boolean constant in Python, we write it as is.\n\n However, note that in the assert statement, we are writing code. So we must write it as the literal that would appear in the code.\n\n In Python, we write True (capital T).\n\n Therefore, the output to complete the assert is:\n\n   True\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" and for non-string we don't.\n\n So we output:\n\n   True\n\n However, let me double-check the functions for any error.\n\n f1: \n   The function reverses the list and then joins the string representations. \n   The list [-1,9,3,1,-2] becomes [-2,1,3,9,-1] and then the string is built by converting each: \n        -2 -> '-2', then 1->'1', etc. -> so the string is '-2'+'1'+'3'+'9'+'-1' = '-2139-1'\n\n f2:\n   It does: \n        new_text = ''\n        for ch in text.lower().strip(): \n            if ch.isnumeric() or ch in '\u00c4\u00e4\u00cf\u00ef\u00d6\u00f6\u00dc\u00fc': \n                new_text += ch\n\n   In the string '-2139-1', the characters are:\n        ch0: '-' -> not numeric, and not in the special set -> skip.\n        ch1: '2' -> numeric -> add -> new_text='2'\n        ch2: '1' -> numeric -> add -> '21'\n        ch3: '3' -> numeric -> add -> '213'\n        ch4: '9' -> numeric -> add -> '2139'\n        ch5: '-' -> skip\n        ch6: '1' -> numeric -> add -> '21391'\n\n   So returns '21391'\n\n f3:\n   It checks each character in the string: \n        for c in t: \n            if not c.isnumeric(): \n                return False \n        return True\n\n   The string is '21391'. \n        '2' -> isnumeric -> True -> so condition (not c.isnumeric) is False -> skip.\n        same for all: all are digits -> so returns True.\n\n Therefore, the chain returns True.\n\n Final answer: True"
