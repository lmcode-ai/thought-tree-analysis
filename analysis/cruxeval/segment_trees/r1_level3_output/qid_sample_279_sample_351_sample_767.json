Actually, note:\n          >>> ''.split()\n          []   # but note: we are splitting by space, and the string is empty.\n\n        However, let's be precise: \n          The method split(' ') on an empty string: \n          >>> ''.split(' ')\n          ['']\n\n        But wait: the strip() method: \n          >>> ''.strip()\n          ''   -> so we have an empty string.\n\n        Then splitting an empty string by space: \n          >>> ''.split(' ')\n          ['']   -> because the split method with a separator will return a list of one element if the string is empty.\n\n        However, note: \n          The documentation says: \n            If the string is empty, split() returns [''].\n\n        But in our case, we are splitting by a space: \n          Actually, the behavior of split with a specified separator is that if the string is empty, it returns [''].\n\n        So a = ['']\n\n   Step 3.2: for i in range(len(a)):\n        len(a) is 1, so we have one iteration: i=0.\n\n        Check: a[0].isdigit() -> ''.isdigit() returns False because an empty string is not a digit.\n\n        Therefore, the function returns '-'.\n\n Therefore, the final result is '-'.\n\n However, note: the problem says to output the result in single quotes if it's a string. So we output: '-'\n\n But wait: let me double-check the functions.\n\n For f1: \n   Input: \"\"\n   The while loop condition fails -> returns ans which is ''.\n\n For f2: \n   Input: \"\" -> returns \"\".\n\n For f3: \n   Input: \"\" -> \n        a = ''.strip().split(' ') -> ''.strip() is '' -> split by space: [''] \n        Then we check: a[0] = '' -> isdigit? False -> return '-'\n\n So the answer is '-'.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we just write: '-'\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" -> so we write: '-'\n\n However, the example output is a string, so we output it in single quotes.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\", but then says \"Only return the output ... without any other information and assert statement\".\n\n So we just output: '-'\n\n But note: the example output format: if it's a string, enclose in single quotes. So we output: '-'\n\n However, let me check the function f3 again: \n   What if the string is empty? \n        a = ['']\n        then we check: if a[0].isdigit() is False -> returns '-'\n\n Therefore, the answer is '-'."
