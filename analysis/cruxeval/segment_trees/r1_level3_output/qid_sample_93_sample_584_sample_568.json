But note: the string 'iq!!!!' does not have any format placeholders (like {}).\n        Therefore, the format call will simply return the original string if there are no braces. However, if there are braces, it would try to replace them.\n        Since there are no braces, the formatting does nothing? But wait, what if the string has a format specifier? Actually, without any curly braces, the format method returns the string as is.\n\n        However, note: the argument to format is a tuple of one element: ('0'*20,) which is a tuple of 20 zeros? Actually, it's a tuple with one string of 20 zeros.\n\n        But because there are no placeholders, the format method will not use the argument and just return the string.\n\n        So f2('iq!!!!') returns 'iq!!!!'\n\n Step 3: Compute f3 on the output of f2, i.e., f3('iq!!!!')\n   f3(num) with num = 'iq!!!!'\n     letter = 1\n     for i in '1234567890': (which is 10 characters, so 10 iterations, but note the break condition)\n\n     Iteration 1: i = '1'\n        num = num.replace(i, '') -> replace '1' with nothing -> since there's no '1', num remains 'iq!!!!'\n        if len(num)==0: break -> no, so continue\n        num = num[letter:] + num[:letter] \n            letter=1 -> num[1:] + num[:1] -> 'q!!!!' + 'i' -> 'q!!!!i'\n        letter becomes 2\n\n     Iteration 2: i = '2'\n        replace '2' -> nothing changes -> num = 'q!!!!i'\n        num = num[2:] + num[:2] -> '!!!i' + 'q!' -> '!!!iq!'\n        letter becomes 3\n\n     Iteration 3: i = '3'\n        replace '3' -> nothing -> num = '!!!iq!'\n        num = num[3:] + num[:3] -> 'iq!' + '!!!' -> 'iq!!!!'\n        letter becomes 4\n\n     Iteration 4: i = '4'\n        replace '4' -> nothing -> num = 'iq!!!!'\n        num = num[4:] + num[:4] -> '!!' + 'iq!!' -> '!!iq!!'\n        letter becomes 5\n\n     Iteration 5: i = '5'\n        replace '5' -> nothing -> num = '!!iq!!'\n        num = num[5:] + num[:5] -> \n            num[5:] -> from index5 to end: the string has 6 characters? \n            Let's index: \n                string: '!!iq!!' -> indices: 0:'!', 1:'!', 2:'i', 3:'q', 4:'!', 5:'!'\n            num[5:] -> from index5: '!' -> so that's one character: '!'\n            num[:5] -> from 0 to 4: '!!iq!'

(because the string is 6 long: indices0-5; index4 is the fourth character: the first '!' of the last two, and index5 is the last)\n          num[:4] -> indices0 to 3: 'iq!!'? \n          Actually: \n            string: 'iq!!!!'\n            indices: \n              0: 'i', 1: 'q', 2: '!', 3: '!', 4: '!', 5: '!'\n            num[4:] -> from index4 to end: '!!' (indices4 and 5: two '!')\n            num[:4] -> indices0 to 3: 'iq!!' (because index4 is excluded) -> so 'i','q','!','!'\n          so new num = '!!' + 'iq!!' = '!!iq!!'\n\n     Iteration5: \n        i='5'\n        num = '!!iq!!'\n        letter=5 -> num[5:] + num[:5]\n          num[5:] -> index5: the last character -> '!'\n          num[:5] -> indices0 to 4: '!!iq!'
