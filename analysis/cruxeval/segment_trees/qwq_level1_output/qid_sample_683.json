It starts by making a copy of dict1 into result. Then it does result.update with a list comprehension. The list comprehension is generating pairs (__, dict2[__]) for each __ in dict2. Wait, the blank is the same in both places, so probably the keys of dict2 are being used here. So the list is a list of tuples (key, value) for each key in dict2.\n\nThen, the update method is called on result with this list. The update method for dictionaries can take an iterable of key-value pairs. So this should be equivalent to adding all the key-value pairs from dict2 into the copied dictionary. But wait, isn't that the same as just doing result.update(dict2)? Because the list comprehension is essentially creating a list of the items in dict2.
