Then it initializes an empty list called result.\n\nNext, there's a for loop that iterates over each key-value pair in the transl dictionary. For each pair, it checks if the value modulo the input number equals zero. If so, it appends the key to the result list.\n\nThe function returns the result list after processing all items.\n\nThe test case is f(2). So the number here is 2. Let's go through each key-value pair:\n\n- 'A' has value 1. 1 % 2 is 1, which is not zero, so 'A' isn't added.\n- 'B' is 2. 2 % 2 is 0, so 'B' gets added to the result.\n- 'C' is 3. 3 % 2 is 1, so no.\n- 'D' is 4. 4 % 2 is 0, so 'D' is added.\n- 'E' is 5. 5 % 2 is 1, so no.\n\nSo the result list should be ['B', 'D'].
