Let's break it down. The function f first checks if text is present. Since 'ha' is a non-empty string, the first branch is taken: return text.rstrip(chars). \n\nNow, the rstrip method normally trims characters from the end of the string that are in the given chars. If chars is an empty string, then rstrip behaves like the standard strip but only for trailing characters. Wait, no\u2014actually, when you call rstrip() with no arguments, it removes whitespace from the end. But in this case, the argument is an empty string passed as chars. Wait, the parameter here is chars, so when we call f('ha', ''), the chars argument is an empty string. So the code is text.rstrip(''), which is the same as calling rstrip with no arguments. \n\nWait, right. So str.rstrip() without any arguments removes trailing whitespace. But the input here is 'ha', which has no trailing whitespace. So 'ha'.rstrip() would just return 'ha' as is. Therefore, the result of f('ha', '') should be 'ha'. \n\nTherefore, the assert statement should be completed with 'ha' on the right side. The user just needs to put that in. Let me double-check. Let me think about possible mistakes. What if someone thought that passing an empty string to rstrip would remove all characters? No, that's not how it works. The chars argument is a string of characters to remove. If it's empty, then it's the same as not passing any, so it removes whitespace. Since 'ha' has none, the result is the same. \n\nYes, so the correct answer is 'ha'.\n</think>\n\n'ha'"
