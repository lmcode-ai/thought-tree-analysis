But since the list is modified in place, the return statement would return the reversed list. \n\nThe test case is f([-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1]). Let's see what the reversed version of that list is. The original list is [-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1]. Reversing it would start from the end. So the reversed list should be [1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6]. \n\nWait, let me write that step by step. Original list elements in order:\n\nIndex 0: -6, 1: -2, 2:1, 3:-3,4:0,5:1. So reversing would go from index 5 to 0.
