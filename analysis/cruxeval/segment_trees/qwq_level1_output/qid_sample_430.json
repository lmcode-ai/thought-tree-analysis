The function is called f, and the assert statement is supposed to check if the result equals something. My job is to fill in the right-hand side of that assert with the correct output.\n\nSo first, let me look at the code of the function f. It takes arr1 and arr2. Then it creates a new_arr by copying arr1. Then it extends this new_arr with arr2. Finally, it returns new_arr.\n\nWait, the function uses the extend method on new_arr with arr2. So, the new array should be the concatenation of arr1 followed by all elements of arr2. So the result is a list that starts with the elements of arr1 and then appends each element from arr2 one by one.\n\nLet me go through the example step by step. The first array is [5,1,3,7,8]. The second array is ['', 0, -1, []]. So when we copy the first array into new_arr, it's initially [5,1,3,7,8]. Then, extending with the second array adds each element of arr2 to the end. So the elements from arr2 are added one after another. So the resulting list should be [5,1,3,7,8, '', 0, -1, []].\n\nTherefore, the assert statement should have this list as the expected output. Let me double-check. The function uses arr1.copy(), which for a list in Python is the same as list(arr1), so that's correct. Then extend with arr2. Yes, that's the right way to concatenate. So the final list should indeed be the combination of the two arrays.\n\nI should make sure there are no errors in the code. Wait, does the function return new_arr correctly? Yes. The code seems straightforward. So the output is the combined list. So the assert is checking that f returns exactly that list. So the correct answer is the list [5,1,3,7,8, '', 0, -1, []].\n\nHmm, but maybe the order? Let me see. The first array elements come first, then each element of the second array. Yes. So the elements of arr2 are added in order. The second array has four elements, so the final list has 5 +4 =9 elements. That's exactly what I have in the list above. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the assert should have that as the right-hand side.\n</think>\n\n[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]"
