The function uses reversed(arr), which returns an iterator. Then converting that to a list with list() should give the reversed list. So for example, if the input is [1,2,3], the output would be [3,2,1].\n\nSo applying this to the test case: the input list is [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5]. Let's reverse that. The original list has elements in order 2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5. Reversing them would start from the last element. The last element is -5, then 3, then 9999, then 1, 0, and 2. So the reversed list should be [-5, 3, 9999, 1, 0, 2].\n\nWait, let me check the indices again. The original list's indexes are 0:2, 1:0, 2:1, 3:9999, 4:3, 5:-5.
