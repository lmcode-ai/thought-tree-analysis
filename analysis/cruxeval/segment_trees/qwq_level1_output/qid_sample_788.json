If it does, it returns text plus the suffix starting from index 1 (so skipping the first character). Otherwise, it just returns the text as is.\n\nSo, in the test case given, the suffix is '/'. Let's see: the suffix starts with '/', right? The first character is '/', so the condition is true. Therefore, we take the text 'hello.txt' and concatenate it with suffix[1:].

The function checks if the suffix starts with a slash. Since it's exactly a single slash, that's true. So the return is text + suffix[1:]. The suffix here is length 1, so suffix[1:] is indeed empty.
