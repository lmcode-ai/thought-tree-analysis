Then for each line, it checks if the line's length is greater than 0 and the first character of the line is equal to ch. If both conditions are true, it appends the line converted to lowercase to the result list. Otherwise, it appends the line in uppercase. Finally, it joins all the lines with newlines again and returns that string.\n\nThe test case is f(\"t\\nza\\na\", \"t\"). Let's break down the input text.
