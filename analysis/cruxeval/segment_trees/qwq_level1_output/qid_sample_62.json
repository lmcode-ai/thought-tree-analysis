For a dictionary, the number of keys and values should always be the same because each key maps to exactly one value. So, len(user.keys()) is always equal to len(user.values()).

So the if condition is false, so it returns the values as a tuple.\n\nNow, what's the order of the values in the tuple? Dictionaries in Python 3.7+ preserve insertion order. The order of the keys and values is the same as the insertion order. Let's look at the test case:\n\nThe dictionary is {\"eating\" : \"ja\", \"books\" : \"nee\", \"piano\" : \"coke\", \"excitement\" : \"zoo\"}\n\nSo the keys in order are \"eating\", \"books\", \"piano\", \"excitement\".
