Let me think again. The code is correct? Let me see: the function loops from 0 to len(text)-1, because range(len(text)) gives 0-based indices. So yes, each j starts at 0, so the slices are correct. So the output is indeed the list I mentioned. Therefore, the assert should have that list on the right side.\n</think>\n\n['123', '23', '3']"
