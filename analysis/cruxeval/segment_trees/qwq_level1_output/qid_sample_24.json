The list starts with 35 as the 0th element. Popping it would shift all the other elements to the left. So the next elements would then take the place of the previous indices.

The function f takes nums and i, pops i, returns nums. That seems straightforward. The list is modified in place, and since lists are mutable, the returned list is the modified one. \n\nThe assert statement is expecting to compare the result of f([35,45,...], 0) to the correct value. So the right-hand side of the assert should be the list after removing the first element. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the list [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
