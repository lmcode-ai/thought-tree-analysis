Reversing this list would make ['P', 'O', 'O'], and joining those characters gives 'POO'.\n\nHmm, so the function's return value should be 'POO'. Therefore, the assert statement should check against 'POO'. Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal input: '   OOP   ' after strip becomes 'OOP'. Reversed, that's 'POO'. Yes. So the correct assert is f('   OOP   ') == 'POO'.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other steps I missed. The function doesn't do anything with the spaces except stripping them before reversing.
