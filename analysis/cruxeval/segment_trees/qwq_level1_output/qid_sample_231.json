Let's check each one. 1872 is definitely <=1900, so that's 1. 1995 is after 1900, so no. 1945 is also after 1900.

Therefore, the function should return 2. So the assert statement should have 2 as the expected output.\n\nWait, let me double check. The input list has three elements. The a10 count is 1 (only 1872). a90 counts the years after 1910. 1995 and 1945 are both after 1910, so that's 2. So a90 is 2. Since neither a10 nor a90 are over 3, it goes to else and returns 2.
