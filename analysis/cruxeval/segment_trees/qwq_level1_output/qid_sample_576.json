It initializes output as ['x'], which is interesting because the first element is a string 'x', but the rest will probably be numbers. Then there's a loop from 1 to len(array) + 1. Wait, the range in Python is exclusive on the upper end, so range(1, len(array) +1) would go from 1 up to len(array), inclusive. Because if the array length is 3, then len(array)+1 is 4, so the range is 1,2,3.\n\nThe loop variable i starts at 1 and goes up to the length of the array. For each i, if i is odd (since i%2 !=0), then append array[i-1] multiplied by -2. Else, append the const.\n\nWait, the array is 0-based, so for i=1, the index is 0, which is the first element.
