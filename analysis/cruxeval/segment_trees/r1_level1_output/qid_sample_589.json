The function is supposed to append the last element of the list to itself and return the modified list. \n\nFirst, let's look at the function definition. The function f takes a parameter num, which I assume is a list. Then, it appends num[-1] to num. The last element of the list is num[-1], right? So, whatever the last element is, it gets added to the end of the list.\n\nThe test case here is f([-70, 20, 9, 1]). Let's walk through what happens step by step. The initial list is [-70, 20, 9, 1]. The last element here is 1. So, the function appends 1 to the list. That means the new list becomes [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]. Then, the function returns this modified list.\n\nWait, but the assert statement is checking if the result equals... Well, the user hasn't provided the expected output, but based on the code, the function should return the original list with the last element duplicated at the end.\n\nSo, applying the function to the given list, the result should be [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]. Therefore, the correct answer to fill in the assert statement would be that list.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure there are no errors in the code. The function uses num.append(num[-1]), which is correct for adding the last element to the list. Since lists are mutable and the append method modifies the list in place, this should work as intended. So, the function does exactly that. No obvious errors here.\n\nTherefore, the output when calling f([-70, 20, 9, 1]) is the list with an additional 1 at the end."
