The function is a bit complex, so I need to go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the function starts by sorting the 'places' list. The initial places list is [375, 564, 857, 90, 728, 92]. When sorted, this becomes [90, 92, 375, 564, 728, 857].\n\nNext, it iterates over each element in 'lazy' (which is [728] here) and removes those elements from the sorted places list. So after removing 728, the places list becomes [90, 92, 375, 564, 857].\n\nNow, the function checks if the length of places is 1. Since there are 5 elements left, this condition is false. Then it proceeds to the loop where it checks each place in the list. For each place, it checks if places.count(place + 1) is zero. The goal here is to find the first index where the next number (place + 1) isn't present in the list.\n\nLooking at the modified places list: [90, 92, 375, 564, 857]. Let's check each element:\n\n- 90: place+1 is 91. Is 91 in the list? The list has 92, so no. So the count is zero. Therefore, the function returns i+1, which is 0+1=1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's go step by step. The loop is for i, place in enumerate(places). The first place is 90 (i=0). Check if places.count(90+1=91) ==0. Since 91 is not in the list, yes. So return i+1, which is 1. Therefore, the function returns 1.\n\nSo the answer should be 1."
