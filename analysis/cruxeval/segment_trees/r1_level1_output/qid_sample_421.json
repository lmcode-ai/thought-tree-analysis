The problem says to complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case.

Otherwise, it returns str.removeprefix(str[:n]). Wait, the parameters are named str and n. The function is supposed to remove the prefix which is the first n characters of the string. So if the string is longer than or equal to n, it removes the prefix of the first n characters.\n\nBut let's check the test case: the input string is \"try.\", which has a length of 4. Because \"try.\" has 4 characters (t, r, y, .), and n is 5. So len(str) is 4, which is less than 5. Therefore, the function should return the original string \"try.\".\n\nWait, but the function's code says: if len(str) < n: return str. Else, do the removeprefix. So in this case, since 4 < 5, it returns the original string. So the output should be \"try.\".\n\nBut let me double-check.
