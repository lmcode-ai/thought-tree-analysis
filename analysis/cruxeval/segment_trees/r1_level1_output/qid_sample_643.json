Then it returns the modified text.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if 'damdrodm' ends with 'm'. The string 'damdrodm' ends with 'm', right? Let me confirm: the last character is 'm', and the suffix is 'm', so the condition text.endswith(suffix) is True.\n\nIf that's the case, then the code proceeds to take text[:-1], which is 'damdrod' (since the original text is 'damdrodm', removing the last character gives 'damdrod'), and then appends the last character after swapping case. The last character is 'm', so swapping its case would turn it into 'M'. So combining them, the result should be 'damdrod' + 'M' = 'damdrodM'.\n\nWait, but wait. The code uses text[-1:], which is a slice from the last character to the end. For a string, text[-1:] is the last character as a string. Then swapcase is called on that. So 'm' becomes 'M'.

Let me double-check. The function returns the modified text in that case. If the text doesn't end with the suffix, it just returns the text as is.
