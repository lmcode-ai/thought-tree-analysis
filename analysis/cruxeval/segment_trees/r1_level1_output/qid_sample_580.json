Then, check again for 'r' in 'vr'. The next 'r' is at index 1 in the original string, but wait, after replacing, the new string is 'vr', so in the new string, 'r' is at index 1. But wait, the loop is on the modified new_text each time.\n\nWait, let's step through the code.\n\nThe function f takes text and char. It initializes new_text as the original text. Then, while char is in new_text, it appends the index of char in new_text to the list a, then replaces the first occurrence of char with empty string, and repeats.\n\nSo for 'rvr', 'r':\n\nFirst iteration:\nnew_text is 'rvr'. char 'r' is present.\nFind index of 'r' in new_text: 0.
