The isdecimal() method in Python returns True if all characters in the string are decimal characters and there's at least one character. Decimal characters are those that can be used to form numbers in base 10, like 0-9. However, strings that represent negative numbers or numbers with decimal points would return False because the '-' and '.' are not decimal characters. \n\nSo let's check each element in the list [0,6,2,-1,-2]:\n\n- 0: str(0) is '0', which isdecimal() returns True.\n- 6: '6' \u2192 True.\n- 2: '2' \u2192 True.\n- -1: str(-1) is '-1' \u2192 the '-' is not a decimal character, so isdecimal() returns False.\n- -2: Similarly, '-2' \u2192 False.\n\nSo the loop will process each element in the list.
