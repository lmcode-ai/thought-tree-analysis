There's an assert statement checking that nums has at least one element. Finally, it returns the joined string of nums.\n\nSo the input here is '-123   \\t+314'. Let me break that down. The string starts with a '-', then '123', followed by spaces and a tab, then a '+', and '314'. The task is to filter out all the numeric characters.\n\nWait, what's considered numeric in Python's str.isnumeric? I remember that str.isnumeric() returns True for all characters that have the numeric property, which includes digits from various scripts, and also things like fractions.

Joining them gives '123314'.\n\nWait, but the assert statement is len(nums) > 0. Since there are digits, the assert passes. So the function returns '123314'.\n\nBut wait, maybe the input is '-123   \\t+314', so after the tab, there's a '+' and then 314. So the digits are 1,2,3 from the first part, then 3,1,4 from the second. So joined together as '123314'.\n\nTherefore, the assert statement is expecting that.
