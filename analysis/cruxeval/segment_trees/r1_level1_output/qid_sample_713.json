The first condition checks if char is in text. Since the test case is using a space ' ' as the char, and the text is 'only one line', which definitely contains spaces, this condition is true.\n\nNext, the code splits the text using the char, which is a space here. So splitting 'only one line' by spaces would give ['only', 'one', 'line']. Then, each element in this split list is stripped (though they probably don't have leading or trailing spaces here). So the list becomes ['only', 'one', 'line'].\n\nThen, the code checks if the length of this list is greater than 1. In this case, the length is 3, which is definitely greater than 1. So the function returns True. Therefore, the assert statement should expect True.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The split on space would split on each space, so 'only one line' split by ' ' gives three elements. So len(text) is 3, which is more than 1. So the condition is met, returns True. So the answer is True."
