Then, it iterates over each element 'i' in 'nums'. For each element, it checks if 'i' is not in 'l'; if so, it appends 'i' to 'l'. Finally, it returns 'l'.\n\nSo the purpose of this function seems to be to create a list that contains the elements of 'nums' but without duplicates, preserving the order of their first occurrence. That's like removing duplicates while maintaining the order.\n\nThe test case given is [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8]. Let's process this list through the function.\n\nLet's walk through each element:\n\n1. The first element is 3. It's not in 'l' (which is empty), so add it. l becomes [3].\n2. Next is 1. Not in 'l', so add. l is [3,1].\n3. Then 9. Add. l becomes [3,1,9].\n4. Next 0.

The function processes each in order, adding them only if not already present. The zeros: the first 0 is added, the second is skipped. The 8 at the end is added. So the output list should indeed be [3,1,9,0,2,8].\n\nSo the assert statement expects this list. The code doesn't have any obvious errors. The loop checks each element in order and appends only if not already in 'l', which effectively removes duplicates and maintains order.\n\nTherefore, the correct output is [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8]."
