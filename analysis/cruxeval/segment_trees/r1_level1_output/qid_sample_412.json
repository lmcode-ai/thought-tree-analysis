The range is from start=3 to end=10, inclusive of end because end + 1 is the stop value in range. Wait, no. Wait, the range function in Python is range(start, stop, step). So range(3, 10 + 1, 1) would be numbers starting at 3, up to and including 10, because the stop is 11 (since end is 10, end +1 is 11). So the steps list should be [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], right?

Since 1 is not in the list, the if statement's body isn't executed. So len(steps) is 8.
