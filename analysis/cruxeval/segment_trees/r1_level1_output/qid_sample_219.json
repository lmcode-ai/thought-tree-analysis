The loop runs from 0 to len(s2) + len(s1) - 1, because the range is up to but not including the upper limit. Wait, no, the upper limit is len(s2) + len(s1), so the loop runs for k in 0, 1, ..., (len(s2) + len(s1) - 1). So the total number of iterations is len(s2) + len(s1).\n\nIn each iteration, the code appends the first character of s1 to s1 itself. Then it checks if s2 is a substring of the modified s1. If it finds s2 at any point, it returns True. If the loop completes without finding s2, it returns False.\n\nLet's apply this to the specific case where s1 is \"Hello\" and s2 is \")\".\n\nFirst, len(s2) is 1, len(s1) is 5. So the loop will run from 0 to 5+1=6, which is 6 iterations (k=0 to k=5 inclusive? Wait, the upper bound in range is exclusive. So range(0, 6) gives k=0,1,2,3,4,5. So 6 iterations.\n\nNow, initial s1 is \"Hello\". Let's track each iteration:\n\nIteration k=0:\ns1 += s1[0] \u2192 s1 becomes \"HelloH\" (since s1[0] is 'H')\nCheck if \") is in \"HelloH\" \u2192 No. Continue.\n\nIteration k=1:\ns1 is now \"HelloH\"\nAdd s1[0] again, which is 'H' \u2192 s1 becomes \"HelloHH\"\nCheck if \") is present \u2192 No.\n\nIteration k=2:\ns1 becomes \"HelloHHH\"\nCheck for \")\" \u2192 No.\n\nIteration k=3:\ns1 becomes \"HelloHHHH\"\nStill no \")\".\n\nIteration k=4:\ns1 is now \"HelloHHHHH\"\nNo \")\".\n\nIteration k=5:\ns1 becomes \"HelloHHHHHH\"\nStill no \")\".\n\nAfter 6 iterations, the loop ends. The function returns False.\n\nSo the assert statement should expect False. Therefore, the answer is False."
