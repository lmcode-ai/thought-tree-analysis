    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's look at this problem. The function f takes a text string and returns a new string where each alphanumeric character is converted to uppercase, and non-alphanumeric characters are omitted. The test case is f('\u0441 bishop.Swift') and we need to assert the output.\n\nFirst, let's break down the input string: '\u0441 bishop.Swift'. Wait, the first character is '\u0441', which is a Cyrillic letter. But in Python, the isalnum() method checks if a character is alphanumeric in the ASCII sense. However, Cyrillic letters are considered alphabetic in Python, so '\u0441'.isalnum() would return True. So the first character '\u0441' will be included as uppercase '\u0421'.\n\nNext, the space after '\u0441' is not alphanumeric, so it's skipped. Then 'bishop' \u2013 all letters, so they become uppercase: 'BISHOP'. The '.' in 'bishop.Swift' is not alphanumeric, so it's skipped. 'Swift' becomes 'SWIFT'.\n\nPutting it all together: '\u0421BISHOPSWIFT'. But wait, the original string is '\u0441 bishop.Swift'. Let's process each character:\n\n1. '\u0441' \u2192 '\u0421' (uppercase Cyrillic)\n2. space \u2192 skipped\n3. 'b' \u2192 'B'\n4. 'i' \u2192 'I'\n5. 's' \u2192 'S'\n6. 'h' \u2192 'H'\n7. 'o' \u2192 'O'\n8. 'p' \u2192 'P'\n9. '.' \u2192 skipped\n10. 'S' \u2192 'S'\n11. 'w' \u2192 'W'\n12. 'i' \u2192 'I'\n13. 'f' \u2192 'F'\n14. 't' \u2192 'T'\n\nSo the result should be '\u0421BISHOPSWIFT'. But the test case uses '\u0441 bishop.Swift' which, when processed, the Cyrillic '\u0441' becomes '\u0421', followed by the letters from 'bishop' (uppercase), then 'Swift' (uppercase). So the joined string is '\u0421BISHOPSWIFT'.\n\nWait, but in the input, after 'bishop' there's a '.' and then 'Swift'. So the characters after the '.' are 'S', 'w', 'i', 'f', 't'. So in the result, it's '\u0421BISHOPSWIFT'.\n\nBut the function is looping through each character in the input text. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal input: '\u0441 bishop.Swift'\n\nEach character:\n\n'\u0441' \u2192 alnum? Yes (Cyrillic), so add '\u0421'\n\n' ' \u2192 skip\n\n'b' \u2192 'B'\n\n'i' \u2192 'I'\n\n's' \u2192 'S'\n\n'h' \u2192 'H'\n\n'o' \u2192 'O'\n\n'p' \u2192 'P'\n\n'.' \u2192 skip\n\n'S' \u2192 'S'\n\n'w' \u2192 'W'\n\n'i' \u2192 'I'\n\n'f' \u2192 'F'\n\n't' \u2192 'T'\n\nSo the result is '\u0421BISHOPSWIFT'.\n\nBut the problem says the assert is for '\u0441 bishop.Swift' \u2192 what is the actual output? The function is supposed to return all alnum chars uppercased. So the Cyrillic '\u0441' is included as '\u0421', and the rest letters as uppercase. So the correct output should be '\u0421BISHOPSWIFT'.\n\nBut the user's previous examples might have different behaviors. Wait, in Python, the isalnum() method returns True for letters from other scripts, like Cyrillic. So '\u0441'.isalnum() is True, so it's included. So the answer is '\u0421BISHOPSWIFT'."
