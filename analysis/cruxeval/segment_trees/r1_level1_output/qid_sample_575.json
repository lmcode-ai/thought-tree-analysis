The function is supposed to take a list of numbers and a value, then create a new list where each element is repeated 'val' times. After that, it returns the sum of this new list.\n\nFirst, looking at the code: the function defines new_list as an empty list. Then there's a list comprehension that uses extend to add [i] multiplied by val to new_list. So for each element i in nums, we're adding i repeated val times. Then it sums all elements in new_list.\n\nSo, let's step through the example. The input is [10,4] and val is 3. For each element in nums:\n\n- The first element is 10. [10] * 3 would be [10,10,10]. Extending new_list with this adds three 10s.\n- The second element is 4. [4] *3 is [4,4,4], so adding three 4s.\n\nSo new_list becomes [10,10,10,4,4,4]. Summing these: 10+10+10 = 30, and 4+4+4=12. Total sum is 30+12=42. So the function should return 42. The assert statement is checking if f([10,4],3) equals 42. But I need to make sure I didn't miss anything in the code.\n\nWait, the list comprehension is written as [new_list.extend(...) for i in nums], but since list comprehensions execute the expressions, but in this case, the extend is modifying new_list in place. The list comprehension would create a list of Nones because extend returns None, but that doesn't matter because the code doesn't use the result of the list comprehension. So the code is effectively equivalent to:\n\nnew_list = []\nfor i in nums:\n    new_list.extend([i]*val)\nreturn sum(new_list)\n\nYes. So the code is correct. So the sum is indeed 10*3 +4*3 = 3*(10+4) = 3*14=42. So the answer should be 42. But wait, the actual code uses [i] * val. Wait, [i] * val would create a list with val copies of i.
