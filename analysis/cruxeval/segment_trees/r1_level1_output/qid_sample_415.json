The array is a tuple of tuples: ((8,5), (8,2), (5,3)). When we pass this to dict(array), Python should create a dictionary where the first element of each tuple is the key and the second is the value. But wait, there's a catch here.

The third tuple is (5,3), so key 5 with value 3. So the resulting dictionary d should be {8:2, 5:3}.\n\nNext, the function loops through each key-value pair in d. For each value, it checks if it's less than 0 or greater than 9. If any value is out of that range, it returns None. Otherwise, returns the dictionary.\n\nLooking at the values here: 2 and 3.
