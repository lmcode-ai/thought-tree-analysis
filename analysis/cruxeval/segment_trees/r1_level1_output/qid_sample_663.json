Since container is empty, cron (2) is not present. So the function returns container, which is the empty list. Therefore, the assert should expect an empty list.\n\nSo the correct output is [], and the assert statement should be assert f([], 2) == [].\n\nBut the user's existing code for the function is correct in this case.
