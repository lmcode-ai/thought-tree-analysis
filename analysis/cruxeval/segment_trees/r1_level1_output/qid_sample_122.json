The first check is if the first four characters of the string are not equal to 'Nuva'. If that's the case, it returns 'no'. Otherwise, it returns the string after stripping any trailing whitespace using rstrip(). \n\nThe test case given is f('Nuva?dlfuyjys'). Let's break this down. The string starts with 'Nuva', right? Because the first four characters are 'N', 'u', 'v', 'a'\u2014so the condition string[:4] != 'Nuva' would be false. So the else clause is triggered, which returns string.rstrip(). \n\nNow, rstrip() removes any trailing whitespace characters. But the input string here is 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'. Let's check if there are any whitespace at the end. The string ends with 's', so there's no whitespace to remove. Therefore, the rstrip() would return the original string unchanged. \n\nSo the expected output of the assert statement should be 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'. The function is supposed to return that string as is because there's nothing to strip. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. The rstrip() function only removes characters from the end. So even if there were other characters, like question marks or letters, they wouldn't be stripped unless they are whitespace. Since the test case doesn't have any trailing whitespace, the return value is the same as the input. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'. The assert statement should compare the result of f('Nuva?dlfuyjys') to that string."
