So the insertion steps are:\n\n1. S \u2192 inserted at 0 \u2192 ['S']. 2. R \u2192 inserted at 0 (len=1 \u2192 1//2=0) \u2192 ['R', 'S']. 3.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out what the output of the function f is when given the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'. \n\nFirst, let's look at the code. The function f takes a text and creates a new_text list. It loops through each character in the input text. For each character that is uppercase, it inserts it into the new_text list at the position len(new_text) // 2. So, every time an uppercase character is found, it's inserted into the middle of the current new_text list. If there are no uppercase characters, new_text becomes ['-'], but in this case, we need to check if there are any uppercase letters in the input string.\n\nThe input string here is 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'. Let's look for uppercase letters in this string. Let's go through each character:\n\n- 'S' at the beginning is uppercase.\n- The rest of 'tring' is lowercase.\n- Then 'matching is a big part of ' has all lowercase letters.\n- 'R' in 'RexEx' is uppercase.\n- 'E' in 'RexEx' is uppercase.\n- 'x' is lowercase.\n- 'E' again uppercase.\n- 'x' lowercase.\n- The rest of ' library.' is lowercase except the period.\n\nSo the uppercase letters are S, R, E, E.\n\nNow, let's process each uppercase character step by step.\n\nStart with new_text as empty list.\n\nFirst character is 'S':\nnew_text is empty. len(new_text) is 0, so len//2 is 0. Insert 'S' at position 0. new_text becomes ['S'].\n\nNext uppercase is 'R':\nNow, new_text has length 1. len(new_text)//2 is 0. Insert 'R' at position 0. So new_text becomes ['R', 'S'].\n\nNext uppercase is 'E':\nNow, new_text is ['R', 'S'], length 2. len//2 is 1. Insert 'E' at position 1. So new_text becomes ['R', 'E', 'S'].\n\nNext uppercase is 'E' again:\nNow, new_text has length 3. len//2 is 1 (3//2=1). Insert 'E' at position 1. So the list becomes ['R', 'E', 'E', 'S'].\n\nSo the final new_text is ['R', 'E', 'E', 'S']. When joined together, that's 'REES'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The input string is 'RexEx' which is R, e, x, E, x. So the uppercase letters here are R, E, E. Wait, no. Let me check again the input string:\n\nThe input is \"String matching is a big part of RexEx library.\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- 'String' starts with 'S' (uppercase).\n- Then 'matching...' all lowercase until 'RexEx'.\n- 'RexEx' has R (uppercase), e (lowercase), x (lowercase), E (uppercase), x (lowercase). So the uppercase letters here are R, E. Wait, no. The second 'E' in 'RexEx' would be uppercase? Let me see: 'RexEx' is R followed by ex, then E followed by x. So in 'RexEx', the uppercase letters are R, E, and then another E? Wait, no, maybe it's R, then E, then another E?\n\nWait, let's write it out: 'RexEx' would be R (uppercase), e (lower), x (lower), E (uppercase), x (lower). So the uppercase letters in the entire input string are S, R, E, E. So four uppercase letters.\n\nWait, but in 'RexEx', there's R, E, and then another E? Let me confirm: the string given is 'RexEx'. So positions:\n\n0: R (uppercase)\n1: e\n2: x\n3: E (uppercase)\n4: x\n\nSo that's two uppercase letters in 'RexEx': R and E. So total uppercase letters in the entire input are S, R, E, E. Wait, no. Wait, the full input is:\n\n\"String matching is a big part of RexEx library.\"\n\nSo 'String' has S. Then 'RexEx' has R and E. Wait, but in 'RexEx', the third character is E (uppercase), then another x. So 'RexEx' has two uppercase letters: R and E. So in the entire string, uppercase letters are S, R, E. Wait, but the 'Ex' part: is the second E uppercase? Let me check the input again. The user wrote 'RexEx'\u2014so perhaps it's R followed by ex, then E followed by x. So yes, the third character in 'RexEx' is E (uppercase). So the uppercase letters in the input are S, R, E, and then another E in 'RexEx'? Wait, no, the 'RexEx' would be R, e, x, E, x. So the uppercase letters are R and E. So total uppercase letters in the input are S, R, E. Wait, but maybe there's another E? Let me count again.\n\nOriginal input: \"String matching is a big part of RexEx library.\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- 'String' \u2192 S (uppercase)\n- 'RexEx' \u2192 R (uppercase), E (uppercase)\n- Are there any other uppercase letters? The word 'RexEx' is written with E uppercase again? So that's two uppercase letters in 'RexEx' (R and E), making total of S, R, E. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check:\n\nOriginal string: 'RexEx' \u2192 the letters are R, e, x, E, x. So uppercase letters here are R and E. So in total, the input string has S from 'String', R and E from 'RexEx'. So three uppercase letters. But wait, maybe the 'RexEx' has two E's? No, the 'Ex' part: E is uppercase, then x. So 'RexEx' is R, e, x, E, x. So two uppercase letters: R and E. Then the entire input has S, R, E. So three uppercase letters?\n\nWait, but the 'RexEx' could be written as R, E, x, E, x? No, because the user input is as written. Let's take the input as given: 'RexEx' is written with 'E's in uppercase. So in the input string, the uppercase letters are S, R, E, E. Because 'RexEx' has two E's? Wait, no. Let's look again: 'RexEx' \u2192 the first E is lowercase (since it's 'ex'), but the second E is uppercase. Or maybe the user input has 'RexEx' with E's uppercase. Let me think. The input is 'RexEx' as part of the larger string. So 'RexEx' is written as R, e, x, E, x. So only two uppercase letters here: R and E. So the total uppercase letters in the entire input are S, R, E.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is case-sensitive. Let me check the exact input:\n\nOriginal input: 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'\n\nBreaking down each character:\n\n- 'S' in 'String' is uppercase.\n- Then lowercase until 'RexEx'.\n- In 'RexEx', 'R' is uppercase, 'e' is lowercase, 'x' lowercase, 'E' uppercase, 'x' lowercase.\n- Then the rest is lowercase.\n\nSo the uppercase letters are S, R, E. Three uppercase letters.\n\nWait, so the uppercase letters are S, R, E. So three in total.\n\nSo processing each:\n\nFirst S: new_text is ['S'].\n\nThen R: new_text is ['R', 'S'].\n\nThen E: len(new_text) is 2, so insert at 1. new_text becomes ['R', 'E', 'S'].\n\nWait, but where is the third E? Because in the input, there's only one E in 'RexEx' (the fourth character). Wait, no, 'RexEx' has E at position 3 (0-based). So only one E. So total of three uppercase letters: S, R, E.\n\nSo the new_text after processing all would be R, E, S.\n\nWait, but how does the insertion work for each character.\n\nLet me re-examine the code:\n\nFor each character in text:\n\nIf the character is uppercase, insert into new_text at position len(new_text) // 2.\n\nSo:\n\nStart with empty new_text.\n\n1. S is uppercase. Insert at 0 (since len is 0, 0//2=0). new_text becomes ['S'].\n\n2. R is next uppercase. len(new_text) is 1. 1//2=0. Insert R at position 0. new_text is ['R', 'S'].\n\n3. Next E. len(new_text) is 2. 2//2=1. Insert E at position 1. So new_text becomes ['R', 'E', 'S'].\n\nSo the final new_text is ['R', 'E', 'S'], which when joined is 'RES'.\n\nWait, but the input has 'RexEx' which includes an E. Wait, the input string is 'RexEx', which is in the original text. So the uppercase letters are S, R, E. Three letters.\n\nBut the code's function is supposed to collect all uppercase letters. So in the input string:\n\nOriginal input: 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'\n\nLet's check each character:\n\n- 'S' is uppercase.\n- Then 'tring' lowercase.\n- The rest is lowercase until 'RexEx'.\n- 'R' is uppercase.\n- 'e' lowercase.\n- 'x' lowercase.\n- 'E' uppercase.\n- 'x' lowercase.\n- The rest is lowercase.\n\nSo the uppercase letters are S, R, E. Three letters.\n\nTherefore, inserting each in turn:\n\nFirst 'S' \u2192 ['S'].\n\nThen 'R' \u2192 inserted at 0 \u2192 ['R', 'S'].\n\nThen 'E' \u2192 inserted at 1 (since len(new_text) is 2 \u2192 2//2=1). So inserting 'E' at position 1 makes new_text ['R', 'E', 'S'].\n\nSo the result is 'RES'.\n\nBut wait, the code is inserting each uppercase character as they appear in the original text. So S is first, then R, then E. But the order in the code is based on the order in the text. So the first uppercase is S, then R, then E.\n\nWait, but the code loops through each character in text, so the order of processing is S (position 0), then R (position in the text where 'R' is in 'RexEx'), then E (position in 'RexEx').\n\nSo the insertion steps are:\n\n1. S \u2192 inserted at 0 \u2192 ['S'].\n\n2. R \u2192 inserted at 0 (len=1 \u2192 1//2=0) \u2192 ['R', 'S'].\n\n3. E \u2192 inserted at 1 (len=2 \u2192 2//2=1) \u2192 ['R', 'E', 'S'].\n\nSo the joined string is 'RES'.\n\nBut the code's output is the joined new_text. So the expected answer is 'RES'.\n\nBut let me check the actual code again. The function f is supposed to collect all uppercase letters and insert them into new_text at len(new_text)//2 each time. So the order of insertion depends on the order of the uppercase letters in the original text.\n\nThe input text is 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'.\n\nThe uppercase letters in order are S, R, E.\n\nSo first S is added to new_text at position 0.\n\nThen R is added at position 0, pushing S to position 1.\n\nThen E is added at position 1 (since len is 2, 2//2=1), inserting between R and S. So the new_text becomes R, E, S.\n\nSo the result is 'RES'.\n\nBut the user's example input has 'RexEx' which has an 'E' uppercase. So in the input string, the uppercase letters are S, R, E. So three letters. So the output is 'RES'.\n\nBut wait, the 'RexEx' part is 'RexEx' which is R, e, x, E, x. So uppercase letters are R and E. So total of three uppercase letters in the input string: S, R, E.\n\nSo the code inserts each in order, so the new_text would be R, E, S. So the result is 'RES'.\n\nTherefore, the correct output should be 'RES'."
