The function takes a text and a list of rules. It processes each rule in the order they appear in the list. For each rule, it checks what the rule is and applies the corresponding transformation to the text.\n\nLet's break down the rules one by one as applied to the input 'hi~!'.\n\nThe initial text is 'hi~!'. The rules list is ['~', '`', '!', '&'].\n\nProcessing the first rule: '~'.\nThe code checks if the rule is '@', which it's not. Then checks if it's '~', which it is. So it converts the text to uppercase. The current text becomes 'HI~!'.\n\nNext rule: '`'.\nNow, the rule is '`', which is neither '@' nor '~'. So the code checks if the text is not empty and if the last character of the text matches the rule. The current text is 'HI~!'. The last character is '!', which does not match '`'. So nothing happens here. The text remains 'HI~!'.\n\nThird rule: '!'.\nAgain, not '@' or '~'. Check if text is not empty and last character is '!'. Yes, the last character is '!', so we remove it. The text becomes 'HI~'.\n\nFourth rule: '&'.\nSame as before. Check if last character is '&'. The text is now 'HI~', last character is '~', so no match. No change.\n\nAfter processing all rules, the final text is 'HI~'. So the assert statement should expect 'HI~'.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 'hi~!':\n\n1. Apply '~': text becomes uppercase \u2192 'HI~!'.\n2. Apply '`': check last character. Current text is 'HI~!', last character is '!', which doesn't match '`' \u2192 no change.\n3. Apply '!': last character is '!', so remove it \u2192 'HI~'.\n4. Apply '&': last character is '~', no match \u2192 no change.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final output is 'HI~'."
