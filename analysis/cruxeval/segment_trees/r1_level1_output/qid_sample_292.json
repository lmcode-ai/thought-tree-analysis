It then creates a new list called new_text. For each character c in text, it checks if c is a digit using the isdigit() method. If it is, it keeps c; otherwise, it replaces c with '*'. Finally, it joins all elements of new_text into a string and returns it.\n\nSo, let's apply this to the input '5f83u23saa'. Let's break down each character:\n\n- '5' is a digit \u2192 remains '5'\n- 'f' is not a digit \u2192 replaced with '*'\n- '8' is a digit \u2192 remains '8'\n- '3' is a digit \u2192 remains '3'\n- 'u' is not \u2192 '*'\n- '2' \u2192 stays '2'\n- '3' \u2192 stays '3'\n- 's' \u2192 '*'\n- 'a' \u2192 '*'\n- 'a' \u2192 '*'\n\nPutting them all together, the resulting characters should be '5*83*23***'.
