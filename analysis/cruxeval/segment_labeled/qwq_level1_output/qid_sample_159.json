The function is given, but maybe there are errors. But the user says not to output anything else even if the function is incorrect. So I just have to work with the code as written.\n\nFirst, let's look at the function f(st). It takes a string st. The code initializes swapped as an empty string.

For example, if st is 'abc', reversed would give 'cba' as a reversed iterator, but when you loop through it, each character is in reverse order.
