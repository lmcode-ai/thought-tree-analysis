The function takes a string called text, splits it into words, and then iterates over each word. The variables m and cnt start at 0. \n\nHmm, so for each word in the split text, it checks if the length of the word (len(i)) is greater than m. If it is, then cnt increases by 1, and m is updated to the new maximum length. So the cnt is counting how many times a new maximum length is found. \n\nWait right. The initial m is 0. The first word's length will definitely be greater than 0, so cnt becomes 1, and m is set to that length. Then the next words are checked: if their length is longer than the current m, then cnt increments again and m updates. So the final cnt is the number of times a new maximum length was encountered as we go through the words. So the function's purpose is to count how many times the maximum word length increases as you process each word from left to right.\n\nNow, the test case is the string \"wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl\".

Wait, because the first maximum was 3, then 5. Then rotbi is 5 again but not larger than current m (5), so it doesn't count. So the total count is 2? \n\nWait, but the initial m is 0.

Therefore the correct assert is 2. \n\nBut wait, am I missing any words with longer lengths? Let me check again all the words:\n\nLooking at each word's length:\n\n\"silak\" is 5, \"rotbi\" is 5.
