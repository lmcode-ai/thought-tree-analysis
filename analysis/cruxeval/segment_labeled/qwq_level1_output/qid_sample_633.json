So the assert statement should have 0 as the expected value. Let me check for possible mistakes. \n\nWait, maybe I confused the element's position. Let me recheck the reversed array. Original array elements are 5, -3, 3, 2. Reversed, they become 2, 3, -3, 5. So the first element is 2, so index 0 is correct. The function returns 0. \n\nAnother thing: the array is modified by reversing, but since lists are mutable and passed by reference, but after the function reverses it again in the finally block, the original array outside the function would also change?
