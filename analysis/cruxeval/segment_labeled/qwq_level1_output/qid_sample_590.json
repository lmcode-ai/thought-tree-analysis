Then there's a for loop that runs from 10 down to 1, stepping by -1 each time. For each i in that range, it does text = text.lstrip(str(i)). So for each number from 10 to 1, it's stripping all occurrences of that number's string representation from the beginning of the text.\n\nWait, lstrip removes leading characters, right? So for example, if the current text starts with '5', and i is 5, then it would remove that '5' from the start.
