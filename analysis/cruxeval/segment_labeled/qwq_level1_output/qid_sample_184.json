But here, the length is 2, which is not less than 2, so we proceed to the loop.\n\nThe loop is for i in range(0, len(digits), 2). Since the length is 2, the range will be 0 and then 2, but since 2 is equal to the length (2), the loop will iterate over i=0 only. Wait, no. Wait, range(0, 2, 2) produces 0 and then stops because the next would be 2, which is not less than 2. So the loop runs once with i=0.\n\nInside the loop, they swap the elements at positions i and i+1. So with the current digits being [2,1], when i is 0, we swap index 0 and 1.
