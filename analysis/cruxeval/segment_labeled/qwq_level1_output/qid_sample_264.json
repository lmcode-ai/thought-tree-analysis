Let me process each step. \n\nStarting with \"papera\":\n\nFirst replacement: replace 'a' with 'A'. Let's see each character:\n\np, a, p, e, r, a. So replacing 'a's:\n\nThe first 'a' becomes 'A', the second 'a' at the end also becomes 'A'. So after first step, the string becomes \"pAperA\".\n\nThen, the next step is to replace 'e' with 'A' in that result. The current string is \"pAperA\". The 'e' here is the fourth character. So replacing 'e' with 'A' gives \"pAPrA\".\n\nWait, let me check again. Let's write it out:\n\nOriginal: p a p e r a \u2192 after first replace 'a' to 'A' \u2192 p A p e r A. Then, replacing 'e's (if any) with 'A's. The 'e' is present here. So the 'e' becomes 'A', so the string becomes p A p A r A \u2192 \"pApArA\"?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let me do it step by step.\n\nOriginal string: \"papera\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nOriginal letters: p, a, p, e, r, a.\n\nAfter first replace 'a' with 'A':\n\nEach 'a' is replaced.

So after first replace: \"pAperA\".\n\nNow, the next replace is on that string, replacing 'e's with 'A's. The 'e' is at position 3 (index 3).
