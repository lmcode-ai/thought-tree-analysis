The function is f(array, n), which returns array[n:].

So let me count the indices here. The array is [0,0,1,2,2,2,2]. The indices go from 0 to 6. So the 4th index (since Python starts at 0) is the fifth element.

So the resulting list should be [2,2,2]. Wait, wait, wait. Let me count again. The elements from index 4 onwards are the fifth element (since starting at 0), which is the first 2 at position 4, then the next two are 5 and 6. So the elements are [2,2,2]. Therefore, the assert statement should check if the result equals [2,2,2]. \n\nWait, the original array has seven elements. Let me confirm the length. The array given is [0,0,1,2,2,2,2], so that's seven elements. So index 4 is the fifth element (0-based), which is the first 2 in the middle. Wait no, let me list them again:\n\nPositions:\n\n0:0\n\n1:0\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:2\n\n5:2\n\n6:2\n\nSo starting at index 4, the elements are at 4,5,6: 2,2,2. So the slice would be [2,2,2].
