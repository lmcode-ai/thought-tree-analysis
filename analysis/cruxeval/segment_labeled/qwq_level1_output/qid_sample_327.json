Alright, let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f takes a list called lst. It initializes a new list and a variable i which starts at the last index of the input list. Since the input here is [1,7,-1,-3], the length is 4, so the indexes go from 0 to 3. So i starts at 3 (since len(lst)-1 is 3). \n\nThen there's a loop that runs for len(lst) times, which in this case is 4 iterations. In each iteration, they check if i is even. If it is, they append -lst[i] to the new list. Otherwise, they just append lst[i]. Then i decreases by 1 each time.\n\nWait, but the loop is using '_' in the for loop, so the loop variable isn't used. The key is that each time, i is moving backwards from the end of the list, and for each element, depending on their original index (since i is starting from the last index and going down), they are checking if i is even. Wait, actually, the index in the original list that we are looking at. Because i is starting at the end and moving backward. Let me track each step.\n\nLet's list the elements with their original indexes:\n\nOriginal list indexes and elements:\n\n0: 1\n\n1:7\n\n2:-1\n\n3:-3\n\nThe loop runs 4 times. Let's step through each iteration.\n\nStart with i = 3 (since len(lst)-1 is 3).\n\nFirst iteration (loop 1):\n\nCheck if i (3) is even? 3 is odd, so append lst[3] which is -3. Then subtract 1 from i, so i becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration (loop 2):\n\ni=2. 2 is even. So append -lst[2]. The original element at index 2 is -1. So -(-1) is 1. So append 1. Then i becomes 1.\n\nThird iteration (loop 3):\n\ni=1. 1 is odd. So append lst[1] which is 7. Then i becomes 0.\n\nFourth iteration (loop 4):\n\ni=0. 0 is even. So append -lst[0], which is -1. Then i becomes -1, but the loop has already run 4 times.\n\nSo the new list after each step would be:\n\nAfter first iteration: [-3]\n\nSecond: [-3, 1]\n\nThird: [-3,1,7]\n\nFourth: [-3,1,7, -1]\n\nWait, but the order here is important.
