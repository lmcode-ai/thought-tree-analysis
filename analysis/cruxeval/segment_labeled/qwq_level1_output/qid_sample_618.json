I need to find the output of the function f when called with arguments '9', '8', and 2, so that the assert statement can be completed correctly.

The second is '8', which is the 'fill' variable. The third is 2, which is n. So the function's return statement takes fill's first n characters and adds the match to it.\n\nWait, but '8' as a string is a single character.
