The inner loop is over each element in base, for each i in base's indices.\n\nWait, but delta is a list here. The code says for j in range(len(delta)), so j goes from 0 to len(delta)-1.

Because the assert is f([\"gloss\", ...], []). So since delta is empty, the outer loop (over j in range(len(delta))) won't run at all.
