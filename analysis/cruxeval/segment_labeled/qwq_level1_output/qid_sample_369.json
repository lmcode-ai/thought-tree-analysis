The .isdigit() method returns True only if all characters are digits. But here there are spaces, so the first condition is false. So move to the next elif.\n\nNext, the second condition is var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit(). Let me parse this. The replace function here is replacing the first occurrence of '.' with an empty string. But the input doesn't have any '.' in it. So replacing that would just leave the original string. Wait, so the string here is \" 99 777\". After replacing a '.' (which isn't there), it's still \" 99 777\". Then checking if that's digit? The string has spaces and digits. The .isdigit() would still return false because of the spaces. So the second condition also fails. So moving on.\n\nThird condition: var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1. Let's count the spaces in \" 99 777\". Let's see, the string starts with a space, then two digits, a space, then three digits. Let me count the spaces: there's the first one, then between 99 and 777, another space. So total of 2 spaces. The length of the string: let's see, the string is \" 99 777\". Breaking down the characters: first char is space, then '9', '9', space, '7', '7', '7'. Wait that's total 7 characters. So length is 7. len(var) -1 is 6. The number of spaces is 2. 2 is not equal to 6, so the condition is false. So move to next.\n\nFourth condition: len(var) ==1. The input string is \" 99 777\", which has length 7, so that's false. So then it goes to the else clause, returning \"tuple\".\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I miscounted the spaces or the length. Let me double-check the string. Let's count the characters step by step. The string is \" 99 777\". Let's write each character:\n\n1: ' ' (space)\n2: '9'\n3: '9'\n4: ' ' (space)\n5: '7'\n6: '7'\n7: '7'\n\nSo yes, 7 characters in total. So len(var) is 7.
