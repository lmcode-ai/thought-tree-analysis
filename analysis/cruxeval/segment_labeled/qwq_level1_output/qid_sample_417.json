So I have to step through the code and see what happens.\n\nFirst, the function f takes a list called lst. Let's go through each line step by step.\n\nThe first line inside the function is lst.reverse(). So when the input is [7,8,2,8], reversing that list would make it [8,2,8,7]. Because the original list is reversed in place.\n\nNext line is lst.pop(). The pop() method removes and returns the last element by default. So after reversing, the list is [8,2,8,7], and popping the last element would remove the 7. Now the list becomes [8,2,8].\n\nThen the third line is another reverse: lst.reverse(). So reversing [8,2,8] would give [8,2,8] again? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let's see, the list after the first reverse is [8,2,8,7], then pop removes the last element (7), resulting in [8,2,8], then reversing that gives [8,2,8] reversed. Wait, the list [8,2,8] reversed is [8,2,8]? Wait no. Because when you reverse a list, the first element becomes last and vice versa. So the original after pop is [8,2,8]. Let's index them as positions 0,1,2. Reversing would make the order: element at 2 (which is 8), element at 1 (2), then 0 (8). So the reversed list would be [8, 2, 8]. Wait, that's the same as the original. Because the first and last elements are both 8. Oh right! So reversing a list that starts and ends with the same elements might not change the list if the middle elements are symmetrical. So in this case, after the second reverse, the list is back to [8,2,8].\n\nWait, but let's recap step by step again to be sure:\n\nOriginal list passed is [7,8,2,8].\n\nFirst, reverse it.

So the final list returned is [8,2,8].\n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again.
