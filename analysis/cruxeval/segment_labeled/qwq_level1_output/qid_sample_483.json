The split method here is being called on the text with two arguments: the character to split on, and the maxsplit parameter. The maxsplit parameter specifies the maximum number of splits to do. The default is -1, which splits as much as possible, but here it's set to len(text). Wait, len(text) is the length of the input text. But in the test case, the text is 'a', so len(text) is 1.

Wait, wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, splitting the string 'a' on 'a' with maxsplit 1. The split occurs at the first occurrence of 'a'.
