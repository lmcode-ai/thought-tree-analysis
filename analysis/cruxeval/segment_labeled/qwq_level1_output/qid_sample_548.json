Alright, let's start by understanding the function.\n\nThe function f takes two parameters: text and suffix. The code inside the function checks if suffix and text are both truthy (meaning they are not empty) and if the text ends with the suffix. If all those conditions are true, it returns text with the suffix removed using the removesuffix method. Otherwise, it just returns the original text.\n\nSo, let's break down the test case here.

Hmm, 'spider' ends with 'er', not 'ed'. So the ends with check would be false here.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The word 'spider' is s-p-i-d-e-r.

Let's see: 'spider'.endswith('ed') \u2014 the 'ed' would need to be the last two characters. The last two characters of 'spider' are 'er', so indeed it doesn't end with 'ed'. Therefore, the function returns the original text. So the answer is 'spider'.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should check if the removesuffix method behaves differently?
