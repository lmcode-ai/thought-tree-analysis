Then it calculates count as the length of nums divided by 2 using integer division.

And this is done count times, which is 2 here.\n\nWait, but when you pop elements from a list while iterating, you have to be careful because each pop changes the list. Let's walk through the example step by step.\n\nThe input list is [3,4,1,2,3]. Let's see what happens step by step.\n\nFirst, count is 5//2 = 2.
