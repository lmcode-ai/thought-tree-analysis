So that splits the input by spaces.\n\nThen it loops over each 't' in the text list (which are the words after splitting). For each word, it checks if not t.isnumeric(). If any of those words is not numeric, it returns 'no'. If all of them are numeric, then after checking all, it returns 'yes'.\n\nWait, the key here is that it's checking each word.
