So I have to compute what that returns and then write the assert statement with the correct result.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the rsplit method does. The rsplit(sep, maxsplit) splits a string from the right (end) into a list, using the separator sep, and performs at most maxsplit splits. If maxsplit is 1, then it splits into two parts at most, starting from the right. So for example, if the string is 'a+b+c' and we do rsplit('+',1), it would split into ['a+b', 'c'], because the last occurrence is split once.\n\nIn the given test case, the input text is 'aa+++bb', the sep is '+', and num is 1. So first, let's process text.rsplit('+', 1). The string 'aa+++bb' has three '+' characters. When splitting with maxsplit 1, it should split only the last occurrence. Wait, right, rsplit starts from the right. So the split would be on the rightmost '+', so splitting once. So the original string is 'aa+++bb', which can be thought of as 'aa++' + '+' + 'bb'. So splitting at the last '+' gives ['aa++', 'bb'].\n\nWait, but the split is on the sep, so the sep is '+', so the split would occur at the last '+', so the parts before and after. So the list after rsplit would be ['aa++', 'bb'].\n\nThen, the function joins these elements with '___' as the separator. So joining those two elements with '___' would result in 'aa++___bb'.\n\nTherefore, the assert should be f('aa+++bb', '+', 1) == 'aa++___bb'.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me write down the steps again. The original string is 'aa+++bb', which is 'aa' followed by two '+' (so 'aa++') then another '+', then 'bb'.\n\nWhen using rsplit with sep '+' and num=1, the split happens at the last '+', so the rightmost one. So the split would divide into the part before that '+' (which is 'aa++') and the part after (which is 'bb'). So the list after rsplit is ['aa++', 'bb'].
