The task is to figure out what the function f does when given the array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and the element 2, and then provide the correct assert statement's expected value.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the function. Let's look at the code:\n\ndef f(array, elem):\n    ind = array.index(elem)\n    return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3\n\nSo the function takes an array and an element. It finds the index of the element in the array using array.index(elem), which returns the first occurrence if there are duplicates. Then, it calculates the result as (index multiplied by 2) plus (the element at position -index-1 in the array multiplied by 3).\n\nThe test case is f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, find the index of elem=2 in the array. The array is [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2]. The first occurrence of 2 is at index 1 (since Python uses zero-based indexing). So ind = 1.\n\nNext, compute array[-ind -1]. Let's substitute ind=1. That becomes array[-1 -1] = array[-2]. Wait, array[-2] refers to the second element from the end. The array has 5 elements: indices 0 to 4. The elements are:\n\n0: -1\n\n1: 2\n\n2: 1\n\n3: -8\n\n4: 2\n\nSo the second from the end (index -2) is the element at position 3? Wait, no. Let me think again. The indexes from the end:\n\narray[-1] is the last element (index4: 2),\n\narray[-2] is index3 (-8),\n\narray[-3] is index2 (1),\n\narray[-4] is index1 (2),\n\narray[-5] is index0 (-1).\n\nSo for ind=1, -ind-1 is -1-1 = -2. So array[-2] is -8. \n\nSo the second part is array[-ind-1] which is -8. Multiply that by 3: -8 *3 = -24.\n\nThen, the first part is ind *2 = 1*2 =2. \n\nAdding them together: 2 + (-24) = -22.\n\nWait, that would give 2 -24 = -22. So the result should be -22?\n\nBut let me double-check each step to be sure.\n\nFirst step: array.index(2). The array is [-1,2,1,-8,2]. The first occurrence of 2 is indeed at index 1. Correct.\n\nSecond step: compute the index for the second part. The formula is array[-ind -1]. So with ind=1, that's -1-1 = -2. So array[-2] is the element at position 3 (since the array has 5 elements, the index -2 is 5-2=3). Yes, that's -8. \n\nSo array[-ind -1] is -8. Multiply by 3 gives -24. \n\nThen adding ind*2 (2) plus that gives 2 + (-24) = -22. \n\nSo the assert statement should be f(...)== -22. \n\nWait, but let me check if maybe there's an error in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the formula again:\n\nThe return statement is (ind *2) + (array[-ind-1] *3). So:\n\nind is 1. \n\narray[-ind-1] is array[ - (1) -1 ]? Wait, no, wait. The expression is array[-ind -1], which is the same as array[ (-ind) -1 ].\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the order of operations here. Let me see. \n\nThe expression is array[-ind -1]. Since ind is 1, so -ind is -1, then subtract 1 gives -2. So yes, that's correct. array[-2] is -8. \n\nYes, so all steps seem correct. The final result should be 2 + ( -8 *3 ) = 2 -24= -22. \n\nTherefore the assert statement should have == -22.\n</think>\n\n-22"
