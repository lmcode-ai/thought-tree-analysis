The function inserts elem at position i_num in the array and returns the modified array. The task is to complete the assert statement by providing the expected output when calling f([-4, 1, 0], 1, 4).\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to figure out what happens when we insert the element 4 at index 1 in the list [-4, 1, 0]. Let's recall how list.insert works in Python. The insert method takes the index where the element should be placed, shifting the existing elements to the right if necessary.\n\nThe original array is [-4, 1, 0]. The index given is 1. So inserting 4 at position 1 would mean that the element 4 comes after the first element. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nOriginal indices:\n0: -4\n1: 1\n2: 0\n\nInserting 4 at index 1 would shift the elements at positions 1 and 2 to the right. So the new array becomes:\n\n0: -4\n1: 4\n2: 1\n3: 0\n\nWait, yes. Because inserting at index 1 pushes the existing element at 1 (which is 1) to index 2, and the new element 4 is at 1. The original 0 stays at index 3 now. So the resulting array should be [-4, 4, 1, 0].\n\nTherefore, the assert statement should check if the function returns exactly that list. So the correct output to put after the == is [-4, 4, 1, 0].\n\nI should make sure there are no typos here. Let me double-check. The original array has three elements. After insertion, it's four elements. The element at index 0 remains -4, then the new 4, followed by the original 1 and 0. Yep, that's right. So the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n[-4, 4, 1, 0]"
