I need to figure out what the function f does when given the list [-6, -5, -7, -8, 2], and then complete the assert statement with the correct output.\n\nFirst, let's look at the code. The function f takes a list called nums. It starts by setting count to the length of nums. Then there's a for loop that runs from 2 up to but not including count. The loop variable is num, but inside the loop, it's doing nums.sort(). Then returns the sorted nums.\n\nWait, the loop is for num in range(2, count). So the range starts at 2 and goes up to count-1. The actual values of num here might not matter because inside the loop, they're not using num. Instead, they're sorting the list each time. \n\nLet me think about the test case.
