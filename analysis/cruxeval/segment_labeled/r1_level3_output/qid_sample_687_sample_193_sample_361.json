Removing 8 of them: \n          The first colon is between R and j -> becomes Rj\n          Then next colon is between j and u -> becomes Rju\n          ... until we remove 8 colons, leaving the last colon.\n\n        So the string becomes: \"Rjug zufE:rjug nzufe\"\n\n        Note: The space is still there: between 'g' and 'z' in the first part.\n\n   f3: \n        Split by colon: two parts -> first part: \"Rjug zufE\", second part: \"rjug nzufe\"\n        Count '#' in \"Rjug zufE\": there is none -> 0.\n\n So the answer is 0.\n\n However, note that the original string has a space and we did not remove it. The first part of the split is \"Rjug zufE\", which has no '#'.\n\n Therefore, we complete the assert statement with 0.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\" \n and \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" \n\n Since the output is an integer (0), we just write 0.\n\n However, let me check the functions again for any mistake.\n\n In f1: \n   We do t.pop(len(t)//2) -> for even length? 10//2=5, which is the middle (if we consider 0-indexed, then 5 is the 6th element? but in a 10-element list, indices 0-9, the middle is between 4 and 5? but we take integer division -> 5). \n   Actually, for a 10-element list, the middle element at index 5 is the 6th? But in any case, we remove the element at index 5 which is the 6th character? \n   The string: \n        index0: 'R'\n        index1: 'j'\n        index2: 'u'\n        index3: 'g'\n        index4: ' '\n        index5: 'n'   -> removed.\n\n   So the string without the 'n' becomes: \"Rjug zufE\" (without the colon yet) but then we break into list and then append the lower string.\n\n   Then we form: \n        R:j:u:g: :z:u:f:E:rjug nzufe\n\n   This is correct.\n\n In f2: \n   We count the colons (9) and then remove count-1 (8) colons. The replace function removes the first 8 colons.\n\n   So the string becomes: \n        R (then colon removed) -> then j (then colon removed) ... until we remove 8 colons.\n\n   The last colon remains: \n        ... and then the last colon is between 'E' and 'rjug nzufe'. So we get \"Rjug zufE:rjug nzufe\"\n\n   But note: the space in the first part is still there? \n        The first part is \"Rjug zufE\" -> which is 9 characters? \n        Actually, without the colons, the letters and space are concatenated.\n\n        How did we get \"Rjug zufE\"? \n          Original: R:j:u:g: :z:u:f:E -> removing the colons: \n          R, j, u, g, space, z, u, f, E -> becomes \"Rjug zufE\"\n\n        So that's 9 characters: R,j,u,g, space, z,u,f,E -> \"Rjug zufE\" (without the n that was removed).\n\n   So the string is \"Rjug zufE:rjug nzufe\"\n\n In f3: \n        We split by colon -> two parts: \n          part0 = \"Rjug zufE\"\n          part1 = \"rjug nzufe\"\n\n        Then we take part0 and count the '#' -> 0.\n\n Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n However, note that the test case string is 'Rjug nzufE'. There is no '#' in the entire process.\n\n So the final answer is 0."
