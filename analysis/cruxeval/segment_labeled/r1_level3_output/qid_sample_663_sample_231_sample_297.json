Since 2 is not in the empty list, the condition \"if not cron in container\" is true -> return container, which is []. Step 2: f2(f1([], 2)) = f2([])\n   The function f2 (the second function) is:\n      def f(years):\n        a10 = sum(1 for x in years if x <= 1900)\n        a90 = sum(1 for x in years if x > 1910) if a10 > 3:\n            return 3\n        elif a90 > 3:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return 2\n\n   We call it with years = [].
