Actually, it appends the current b (which collects consecutive spaces) every time it hits a non-space. Then it resets b. But note that the initial a has one element (['']). Then for each non-space character, we append b (which is initially empty and then reset to empty) and then set b to empty. So for each non-space character, we are appending an empty string to a. The string '[4]' has 3 non-space characters -> we append 3 times. So a becomes:\n      Start: a = ['']\n      First char (non-space): append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['', ''] and then set b=''\n      Second char (non-space): append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['', '', ''] and set b=''\n      Third char (non-space): append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['', '', '', ''] and set b=''\n      Then the loop ends. So a has 4 elements -> len(a)=4.\n\n  In f3: We are passing 4 (an integer). The function checks if it's a list? No -> amount=0. Then if it's a dict? No. Then nonzero = 0 (because 0>0 is false). So returns 0.\n\n  Therefore, the final result is 0.\n\n But wait: the function f2 returns 4, which is an integer. Then f3(4) returns 0.\n\n However, let me check the code of f3 again:\n\n    def f3(var):\n        amount = len(var) if type(var) == list else 0\n        if type(var) == dict:\n            amount = len(var.keys())\n        nonzero = amount if amount > 0 else 0\n        return nonzero\n\n  Since var is 4 (an integer), the first line sets amount=0.
