In '1::1', there are 2 colons.\n     - Then it replaces the colon (':') with an empty string, but only for the first (count-1) occurrences.\n     - So, it replaces the first (2-1)=1 occurrence of colon.\n\n   Example: \n        Original string: '1::1'\n        After replacing the first colon: we remove the first colon -> becomes '1:1'\n\n   Therefore, f1('1::1') returns '1:1'\n\n Step 2: Compute f2 on the result of f1, i.e., f2('1:1')\n   Function f2 (as defined in the code for f2):\n     def f(text):\n         counter = 0\n         for char in text:\n             if char.isalpha():\n                 counter += 1\n         return counter\n\n   Explanation of f2:\n     - It counts the number of alphabetic characters in the string.\n\n   In the string '1:1', we have:\n        '1' -> not alpha\n        ':' -> not alpha\n        '1' -> not alpha\n\n   Therefore, there are 0 alphabetic characters.
