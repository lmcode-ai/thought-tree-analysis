Then we would output it in quotes. But here it's a boolean.\n\n However, the problem does not specify how to output non-strings. But the example only says for string use quotes.\n\n So we output:\n\n   True\n\n without quotes.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\". The assert statement is:\n\n   assert f3(f2(f1([-1, 9, 3, 1, -2]))) == \n\n and we are to complete the right-hand side.\n\n So we are to write the value that the left-hand side evaluates to.\n\n Therefore, the answer is True.\n\n However, let me consider: what if the function chain returns a string? Then we would write it in quotes. But here it returns a boolean.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the output\" meaning the result of the entire expression.\n\n So we write:\n\n   True\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information\", so we just output:\n\n   True\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we are not to write the entire assert, only the value that should be on the right-hand side.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   True\n\n But wait: what if the function chain returns a number? Then we output the number without quotes.\n\n Since the problem does not specify for booleans, and True is a boolean constant in Python, we write it as is.\n\n However, note that in the assert statement, we are writing code. So we must write it as the literal that would appear in the code.\n\n In Python, we write True (capital T).\n\n Therefore, the output to complete the assert is:\n\n   True\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" and for non-string we don't.\n\n So we output:\n\n   True\n\n However, let me double-check the functions for any error.\n\n f1: \n   The function reverses the list and then joins the string representations. \n   The list [-1,9,3,1,-2] becomes [-2,1,3,9,-1] and then the string is built by converting each: \n        -2 -> '-2', then 1->'1', etc. -> so the string is '-2'+'1'+'3'+'9'+'-1' = '-2139-1'\n\n f2:\n   It does: \n        new_text = ''\n        for ch in text.lower().strip(): \n            if ch.isnumeric() or ch in '\u00c4\u00e4\u00cf\u00ef\u00d6\u00f6\u00dc\u00fc': \n                new_text += ch\n\n   In the string '-2139-1', the characters are:\n        ch0: '-' -> not numeric, and not in the special set -> skip.\n        ch1: '2' -> numeric -> add -> new_text='2'\n        ch2: '1' -> numeric -> add -> '21'\n        ch3: '3' -> numeric -> add -> '213'\n        ch4: '9' -> numeric -> add -> '2139'\n        ch5: '-' -> skip\n        ch6: '1' -> numeric -> add -> '21391'\n\n   So returns '21391'\n\n f3:\n   It checks each character in the string: \n        for c in t: \n            if not c.isnumeric(): \n                return False \n        return True\n\n   The string is '21391'. \n        '2' -> isnumeric -> True -> so condition (not c.isnumeric) is False -> skip.\n        same for all: all are digits -> so returns True.\n\n Therefore, the chain returns True.\n\n Final answer: True"
