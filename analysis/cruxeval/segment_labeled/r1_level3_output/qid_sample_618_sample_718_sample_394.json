It only returns the index when it finds an empty line.\n\n        And we don't have an empty line, so it returns -1.\n\n Therefore, the answer is -1.\n\n However, let me test with a small example for f3:\n\n        Example 1: f3(\"\") -> \n            k = [\"\"] (because splitlines of an empty string is ['']? Actually, no: splitlines on an empty string returns []? Let me check in Python:\n\n            Actually, in Python, ''.splitlines() returns [].\n\n            But note: the function f3: \n                k = []. Then the loop doesn't run -> returns -1.\n\n        Example 2: f3(\"a\") -> \n            k = ['a'] -> \n            j='a' -> not empty -> i becomes 1 -> then returns -1.\n\n        Example 3: f3(\"\\n\") -> \n            k = ['', '']? Actually, splitlines on \"\\n\" returns ['']? \n            Actually, splitlines by default splits at newline and does not keep the newline. So \"\\n\" becomes [''] (one empty string).\n\n            Then in the loop: j = '' -> so returns i which is 0.\n\n        So the function f3 returns the index of the first empty line? And if there are multiple lines, it returns the first index where the line is empty.\n\n        In our case, we have one line that is non-empty -> returns -1.\n\n Therefore, the answer is -1.\n\n Final output: -1"
