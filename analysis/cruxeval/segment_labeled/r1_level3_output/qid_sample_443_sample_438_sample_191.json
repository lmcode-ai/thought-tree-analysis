None. So string.count('\\t') is 0.\n\n Therefore, the condition (0 < ... < 20) is false (because 0 is not greater than 0). So the loop runs from i=10 to 29 without breaking.\n\n Then we return string.expandtabs(bigTab) with bigTab still being 100.\n\n What does expandtabs do?

The for-loop in Python for a string \n   iterates over the characters of the string at the time the loop starts. So even if we change the string, the loop \n   will still run for the original set of characters.\n\n Therefore, the original string \"lorem ipsum\" has 11 characters. The loop runs 11 times. \n\n But note: the first 5 characters are non-space, then the 6th character (index 5) is a space, then the rest are non-space.\n\n So the first 5 iterations: non-space -> replace 'cd' with that character (but no change).\n Then the 6th iteration: space -> do lstrip.
