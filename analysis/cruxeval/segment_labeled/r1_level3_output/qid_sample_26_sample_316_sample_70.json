'qy.' \n      - Is 'qy.' in \"wtwdoacb\"? -> No.\n      - Check for dot: \n          i.index('.') -> This returns the first occurrence of '.' in the string. \n          In 'qy.', the dot is at index 2 (0-indexed) and the length is 3 -> so 2 == 3-1 -> True. \n          Therefore, the condition is met and we return 'error'.\n\n So, f1 returns 'error'\n\n Step 2: Now we call f2(f1(...)) = f2('error')\n\n Let's look at f2:\n   def f(name):\n      return '| ' + ' '.join(name.split(' ')) + ' |'\n\n What does this do?\n   - It splits the string `name` by space.
