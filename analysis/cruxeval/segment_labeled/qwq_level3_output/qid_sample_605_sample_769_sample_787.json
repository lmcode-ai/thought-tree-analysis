I need to figure out what the output of the code is when these three functions are called in sequence, and then complete the assert statement with that output.

The function f1 takes a list called nums, then does nums.clear(), which removes all elements from the list, and returns \"quack\". So when f1 is called with [2,5,1,7,9,3], it will clear that list, making it empty, and return the string \"quack\". So the result of f1 here is \"quack\".\n\nNext, this result is passed to f2. The f2 function takes a text parameter. It converts the text into a list of characters, then loops through each character, swapping their case (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa). Then it joins them back into a string. Wait, but the input here is the return value of f1, which is \"quack\". So \"quack\" is a string, so that's okay. Let's see: each character in \"quack\" is lowercase. So swapping their case would make them uppercase. So 'Q', 'U', 'A', 'C', 'K'. So the output of f2(f1(...)) would be \"QUACK\".\n\nThen, that result is passed to f3. The f3 function first checks if the text is empty; if so returns empty. Then it converts the text to lowercase, then capitalizes the first character and appends the rest. Wait, let me read f3 again. The steps are: if the text length is 0, return ''. Else, text is made lowercase, then return first character upper + the rest lowercase. Wait, no. Wait, the code is: text.lower() makes the entire string lowercase. Then text[0].upper() takes the first character (now lowercase after .lower()) and makes it uppercase, then adds the rest of the string (which is text[1:], which is also lowercase). So for example, if the input to f3 is \"QUACK\", then after text.lower(), it becomes \"quack\". Then the first character is 'q' which is uppercased to 'Q', then the rest is 'uack'. So the result would be \"Quack\".\n\nPutting it all together: f1 returns \"quack\", f2 converts that to \"QUACK\", then f3 converts that to \"Quack\". So the final result of f3(f2(f1(...))) should be \"Quack\", which in single quotes is 'Quack'.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step. \n\nFirst, f1's return is \"quack\" \u2013 correct.
