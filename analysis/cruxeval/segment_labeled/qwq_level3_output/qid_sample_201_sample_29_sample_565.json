The final line is assert f3(f2(f1('--4yrw 251-//4 6p'))) == ?, and I need to find what that result should be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each function's purpose and how they process the input. Let's start with f1. The code for f1 is:\n\ndef f(text):\n    chars = []\n    for c in text:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            chars.append(c)\n    return ''.join(chars[::-1])\n\nSo f1 takes a string, iterates over each character, checks if it's a digit, and collects those digits into a list.

The find method returns the lowest index for the first occurrence of the character. Wait, no, wait: text.find(ch) returns the first occurrence of ch in the string.

Let's process this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's process f1 on '--4yrw 251-//4 6p'.\n\nThe input text is '--4yrw 251-//4 6p'.
