I need to figure out what each function does and then apply them in order.\n\nStarting with f1. The function f1 takes a text and a space parameter. The code for f1 is:\n\ndef f1(text, space):\n    if space < 0:\n        return text\n    return text.ljust(len(text) // 2 + space)\n\nWait, so if space is negative, it just returns the original text.

So the output of f2 is 'Sowpf'.\n\nNow moving to f3. The function f3 is a bit more complex. Let's look at its code:\n\ndef f3(text):\n    for item in text.split():\n        text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ').replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')\n    return text.strip('-')\n\nWait, the function splits the text into words (since split() without arguments splits on whitespace), then for each item in those words, it replaces occurrences of '-item' with a space, and 'item-' with a space.
