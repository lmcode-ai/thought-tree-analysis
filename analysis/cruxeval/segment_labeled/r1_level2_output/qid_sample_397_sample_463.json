Makes a copy of the dictionary (so we don't modify the original).\n  2. It initializes an empty list `remove_keys`.\n  3. It iterates over each key-value pair in the original dictionary (the one passed as argument).\n  4. For each key-value pair (k, v), it checks if the value `v` is a key in the original dictionary (i.e., if `v` is in the keys of the original dictionary).\n  5. If it is, then it deletes the key `k` from the copied dictionary (`result`).\n  6. Returns the modified copy.\n\nNow, we are to compute: \n   f2(f1(['x', 'u', 'w', 'j', 3, 6]))\n\nFirst, compute f1(['x', 'u', 'w', 'j', 3, 6]):\n   This returns: \n        {'x':0, 'u':0, 'w':0, 'j':0, 3:0, 6:0}\n\nThen, we pass this dictionary to f2.\n\nIn f2, we start with:\n   result = {'x':0, 'u':0, 'w':0, 'j':0, 3:0, 6:0}\n\nNow, we iterate over each key-value pair in the original dictionary (which has keys: 'x','u','w','j',3,6 and all values are 0).\n\nFor each key k and value v (which is 0 in every case), we check: \n   Is v (which is 0) a key in the original dictionary?\n\nThe original dictionary has keys: ['x','u','w','j',3,6]. \nIs 0 one of the keys? \n   The keys are: string characters and integers 3 and 6.
