So index -1 is the last element, and inserting at -1 will put the element before the last element, making it the new second last.\n\n          So after inserting 's' at index -1: \n            becomes: ['a','k','o','o','s','n']   (because we inserted at the position that was the last, so the last element becomes the new one and the previous last is shifted to the right)\n\n     i=1:\n        pos = (1*5 - 1)//2 + (1+1)//2 = (4)//2 + 2//2 = 2 + 1 = 3.\n        Insert 'X' at index 3 in the current list: ['a','k','o','o','s','n']\n          at index 3 (which is the fourth element, currently 'o' at index2 and then index3 is the next 'o'? Actually, note the list now: \n          indices: \n            0: 'a'\n            1: 'k'\n            2: 'o'\n            3: 'o' -> becomes the insertion point, so we insert before this 'o'\n          So we get: ['a','k','o', 'X', 'o','s','n']\n\n     i=2:\n        pos = (2*5 - 1)//2 + (2+1)//2 = (10-1)//2 + 3//2 = 9//2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5? \n        But 9//2 is 4 (since 4*2=8, and 9//2=4 in integer division) and 3//2=1 -> 4+1=5.\n\n        Current list: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n'] (length 7)\n        Insert 'o' at index 5: \n          The current element at index5 is 's'. So we insert before 's', which will be at index5 and then shift the rest.\n          So: \n            indices: \n              0: 'a'\n              1: 'k'\n              2: 'o'\n              3: 'X'\n              4: 'o'\n              5: insert here -> becomes 'o' (the inserted one) and then the rest: \n            becomes: ['a','k','o','X','o','o','s','n']\n\n     So the result of f1('akoon','sXo') is 'akXooosn'\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.\n\n f2(text) function:\n   result = ''\n   for char in text:\n        if char.isalnum():   # checks if the character is alphanumeric (letter or digit)\n            result += char.upper()\n\n   So we go through each character in 'akXooosn':\n\n   'a' -> isalnum -> 'A'\n   'k' -> 'K'\n   'X' -> 'X' (since 'X' is alnum, note: it's a letter)\n   'o' -> 'O'\n   'o' -> 'O'\n   'o' -> 'O'\n   's' -> 'S'\n   'n' -> 'N'\n\n   So the result is: 'AKXOOOSN'\n\n Therefore, the assert statement should be:\n\n   assert f2(f1('akoon', 'sXo')) == 'AKXOOOSN'\n\n However, let me double-check the insertion positions because negative indices can be tricky.\n\n Alternative way for insertion at i=0:\n   The formula: (i * length - 1) // 2 + (i + 1) // 2\n   i=0: (0-1)//2 + (1)//2 = (-1)//2 + 0? \n        Actually, (i+1)//2 when i=0: (0+1)//2 = 1//2 = 0 (in integer division).\n\n   But (-1)//2 in Python is -1 (because floor division for negative: -1//2 = -1).\n\n   So position = -1 + 0 = -1.\n\n   Inserting at -1: \n        Original list: [a, k, o, o, n] \n        Inserting at index -1: \n            The list has 5 elements, so index -1 is the last element (n). \n            Inserting before index -1 (which is the last element) means we are inserting at the position that will become the fourth index? \n            Actually, the positions after insertion: \n                We are inserting at the position that is currently the last element, so the new element will be at the second last.\n\n            So: \n                [a, k, o, o, s, n] -> but wait, that's what we did.\n\n   For i=1: \n        (1*5-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2, and (1+1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> 2+1=3? \n        But wait, the formula: (i * length - 1) // 2 + (i + 1) // 2\n        Actually, the parentheses: \n            ( (i * length - 1) // 2 ) + ( (i + 1) // 2 )\n        So: (4//2) + (2//2) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n        Then we insert at index 3 in the current list: ['a','k','o','o','s','n'] -> \n            index0: 'a'\n            index1: 'k'\n            index2: 'o'\n            index3: 'o' -> we insert before this, so we get: \n            ['a','k','o', 'X', 'o','s','n'] -> correct.\n\n   For i=2:\n        (2*5-1)//2 = (10-1)//2 = 9//2 = 4, and (2+1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 -> 4+1=5.\n\n        Insert at index5 in the list: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n'] -> \n            index0: 'a'\n            index1: 'k'\n            index2: 'o'\n            index3: 'X'\n            index4: 'o'\n            index5: 's' -> we insert before 's', so we get:\n            ['a','k','o','X','o','o','s','n'] -> then we have to shift the rest: \n            becomes: ... then at index5 we put 'o', and then the 's' moves to index6 and 'n' to index7.\n\n        So the string is 'akXooosn'\n\n   Therefore, the string passed to f2 is 'akXooosn'.\n\n   Now, f2: \n        It removes non-alphanumeric? But note: all characters in 'akXooosn' are alphanumeric (letters). \n        So we convert each to uppercase: \n          a -> A\n          k -> K\n          X -> X\n          o -> O (three times)\n          s -> S\n          n -> N\n\n        So the result is \"AKXOOOSN\"\n\n   However, note the original string: 'akXooosn' has 8 characters? \n        a, k, X, o, o, o, s, n -> 8 characters.\n\n   But wait, let's count the original insertion:\n        We started with 5, then inserted 3, so 8.\n\n   So the output string is 8 characters: \"AKXOOOSN\"\n\n   But note: the expected string in the problem might be different? \n\n   Alternatively, let me check the insertion again for i=0: \n        The formula: (i * length - 1) // 2 + (i + 1) // 2\n        For i=0: \n            (0*5-1) = -1 -> -1//2 = -1 (since floor division: -1//2 = -1)\n            (0+1)//2 = 1//2 = 0\n            so -1+0 = -1.\n\n        Inserting at index -1 in the list ['a','k','o','o','n']: \n            The list has 5 elements. The negative indices: \n                -5: 'a'\n                -4: 'k'\n                -3: 'o'\n                -2: 'o'\n                -1: 'n'\n            Inserting at index -1 means we insert before the element at -1 (which is 'n'). \n            So the new list becomes: \n                [a, k, o, o, s, n] -> because we put 's' at the position that was -1, so now the last element is still 'n', and the new element is at the position before it.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is 'AKXOOOSN'\n\n   However, note: the function f1 might have an off-by-one? But we followed the formula.\n\n   Let me run the code in my head step by step for f1:\n\n      text = 'akoon', sign = 'sXo'\n\n      length = 5\n      new_text = ['a','k','o','o','n']\n      sign = ['s','X','o']\n\n      i=0:\n          index = (0*5-1)//2 + (0+1)//2 = (-1)//2 + 1//2 = -1 + 0 = -1\n          Insert 's' at -1: new_text becomes ['a','k','o','o','s','n']\n\n      i=1:\n          index = (1*5-1)//2 + (1+1)//2 = (4)//2 + 2//2 = 2 + 1 = 3\n          Insert 'X' at 3: \n             current list: ['a','k','o','o','s','n'] -> at index3 is the second 'o'\n             so we insert before that: becomes ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n']\n\n      i=2:\n          index = (2*5-1)//2 + (2+1)//2 = (9)//2 + 3//2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n          Insert 'o' at 5: \n             current list: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n'] -> at index5 is 's'\n             so we insert before 's': becomes ['a','k','o','X','o','o','s','n']\n\n      So the string is 'akXooosn'\n\n   Then f2: \n        'akXooosn' -> convert each alnum to upper: \n          a -> 'A'\n          k -> 'K'\n          X -> 'X'\n          o -> 'O'\n          o -> 'O'\n          o -> 'O'\n          s -> 'S'\n          n -> 'N'\n\n        So the string is \"AKXOOOSN\"\n\n   But note: the string has three 'o's? \n        The original had two 'o's, then we inserted one more 'o' (from the sign) at the end? \n        So the word becomes: \n          a, k, X, o, o, o, s, n -> that's three o's.\n\n   Therefore, the output is \"AKXOOOSN\"\n\n   However, let me write the string: \n        a k X o o o s n -> AKXOOOSN\n\n   But note: the last part: \"OOOSN\" -> that's three O's then S and N.\n\n   So the final answer is 'AKXOOOSN'\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\", and \"enclose in single quotes\".\n\n   So we output: 'AKXOOOSN'\n\n   However, note: the function f2 does not remove any character because all are alnum? \n        The string 'akXooosn' has only letters -> so we convert every letter to uppercase.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 'AKXOOOSN'"
