Actually, the big number is 10 digits, then space, then one digit? \n                Actually, the string is: \n                    s = \"1234567890 0\" -> \n                    positions: \n                        0: '1'\n                        1: '2'\n                        2: '3'\n                        3: '4'\n                        4: '5'\n                        5: '6'\n                        6: '7'\n                        7: '8'\n                        8: '9'\n                        9: '0'\n                        10: ' '\n                        11: '0'   -> wait, but the string has 12 characters? \n                Correction: \n                    The string \"1234567890\" is 10 characters, then we have a space and then \"0\", so total 11 characters? \n                    Actually, the string is \"1234567890 0\" -> \n                    Let me write: \n                        s = \"1234567890 0\"\n                    The length is 11? \n                    But note: the big number is 10 digits, then a space, then one digit -> 10+1+1 = 12? \n                    Actually, no: \n                        10 digits: \"1\",\"2\",...,\"0\" (10) \n                        then a space: 1 \n                        then \"0\": 1 \n                        total 12? \n                    But wait, the big number is 10 digits? \n                    Actually, 1234567890 has 10 digits? \n                    Then we have a space and then the digit '0'. So the string is 11 characters? \n                    Actually, 10 digits + 1 space + 1 digit = 12? \n                    But note: the space is one character and the last '0' is one character. \n                    So the string is 12 characters? \n\n                Let me count: \n                    \"1\" -> 1\n                    \"2\" -> 2\n                    \"3\" -> 3\n                    \"4\" -> 4\n                    \"5\" -> 5\n                    \"6\" -> 6\n                    \"7\" -> 7\n                    \"8\" -> 8\n                    \"9\" -> 9\n                    \"0\" -> 10 (this is the last digit of the big number)\n                    then space -> 11\n                    then \"0\" -> 12? \n                But wait, the big number is 10 digits: \n                    positions 0 to 9: \"1234567890\" -> that's 10 characters.\n                Then at index 10: space\n                Then at index 11: '0'\n                So the string has 12 characters? \n\n                Therefore, s[-5:] is the substring from index 7 to 11? \n                Negative indexing: \n                    s[-1] = '0' (the last character)\n                    s[-2] = space? -> no, because the last character is at -1, then the one before is at -2: that would be the space? \n                    Actually: \n                        s[11] = '0' -> index -1\n                        s[10] = ' ' -> index -2\n                        s[9] = '0' (from the big number) -> index -3\n                        s[8] = '9' -> index -4\n                        s[7] = '8' -> index -5\n                    So s[-5:] = s[7:12] -> from index 7 to 11 (inclusive) -> \n                    s[7] = '8'\n                    s[8] = '9'\n                    s[9] = '0'\n                    s[10] = ' '\n                    s[11] = '0'\n                So the substring is \"890 0\"\n\n                Now, check: str.isascii(\"890 0\") -> \n                This string contains only ASCII characters? Yes, because digits and space are in ASCII.\n\n                Therefore, the condition is true.\n\n                Then we return: \n                    s[-5:] -> \"890 0\"\n                    and s[0:][:3] -> \n                        s[0:] is the whole string: \"1234567890 0\"\n                        then take the first 3: \"123\"\n\n                So the return value is a tuple: (\"890 0\", \"123\")\n\n But wait, the function f2 returns a tuple? However, the assert statement is comparing with == and we have to output the result.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case\"\n\n And the output of f2(f1(...)) is a tuple: (\"890 0\", \"123\")\n\n But the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" \n Here the output is a tuple of two strings.\n\n How should we represent the tuple? \n We are to output the result as it would be in the assert.\n\n The expected output for the assert is the value that makes the assert true? \n Actually, the problem says: \"complete the assert statement with the output\"\n\n But note: the assert statement is incomplete: \n        assert f2(f1(1, 1234567890)) == \n\n We are to provide the value that the expression f2(f1(1,1234567890)) returns.\n\n Since the return is a tuple of two strings, we write: ('890 0', '123')\n\n However, let me double-check the string indexing.\n\n Alternative: \n   The string s = \"1234567890 0\" has 12 characters? \n   Let me write it: \n        s = \"1234567890 0\"\n        Actually, if we print it, it's \"1234567890 0\" -> \n        The big number is 10 digits: \"1234567890\", then a space, then \"0\", so 10+1+1 = 12.\n\n   Now, s[-5:] -> \n        The last 5 characters: \n            starting at index -5: \n                total length = 12\n                so from index 12-5 = 7 to the end? \n                s[7:12] -> \n                indices: 7,8,9,10,11 -> \n                s[7] = '8' (because: \n                    index0: '1'\n                    index1: '2'\n                    index2: '3'\n                    index3: '4'\n                    index4: '5'\n                    index5: '6'\n                    index6: '7'\n                    index7: '8'\n                    index8: '9'\n                    index9: '0'\n                    index10: ' '\n                    index11: '0'\n                )\n                s[7:12] = \"890 0\" -> that's 5 characters: '8','9','0',' ','0'\n\n   And s[0:][:3] -> \n        s[0:] is the whole string, then take the first 3: \"123\"\n\n   So the tuple is ('890 0', '123').\n\n But note: the function f1 returns a string, and then f2 returns a tuple. \n\n However, wait: what if the string had non-ASCII characters? \n   We checked that the substring \"890 0\" is ASCII? Yes, because it's digits and space.\n\n Therefore, the output of the entire expression is the tuple: ('890 0', '123')\n\n But note: the problem says \"Do not output any extra information\", and \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we write: \n        ('890 0', '123')\n\n However, the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" \n Here we have a tuple of strings. We should represent it as a tuple with the strings in single quotes.\n\n But note: in Python, the representation of a tuple of strings uses single quotes.\n\n So the answer is: ('890 0', '123')\n\n However, let me check the function f1 again: \n   The function f1: \n        s = 1234567890, e = 0\n        s>1 -> True -> returns f'{s} {e}' -> \"1234567890 0\"\n\n   Then f2(\"1234567890 0\") -> \n        s[-5:] = \"890 0\" -> which is ASCII -> returns (s[-5:], s[0:][:3]) = (\"890 0\", \"123\")\n\n But wait, what is s[0:][:3]? \n        s[0:] is the whole string, then we take the first 3 characters: \n            \"1234567890 0\" -> first 3: \"123\"\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n However, note: the function f2 has an alternative condition: \n        elif str.isascii(s[:5]): \n            ... \n\n   But we don't get there because the first condition is true.\n\n Therefore, the output is the tuple: ('890 0', '123')"
