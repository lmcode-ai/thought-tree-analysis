But in this function, we are using the `remove` method which removes the first occurrence of the value. This can lead to unexpected results because:\n- The `indexes` list contains the original indices, but when we remove the first occurrence, the positions of the subsequent characters shift.\n\nExample: \n  text = \"aabb\", value = 'b'\n  indexes: [2, 3]\n  new_text initially: ['a','a','b','b']\n  First removal (at index 2 in original): remove the first 'b' -> becomes ['a','a','b'] (now the original index 3 becomes index 2 in the new list)\n  Then we try to remove the next index (which was 3) but now we remove the first occurrence of 'b' again, which is at index 2 in the original list?

It shouldn't because we are iterating by index and each index is unique. However, the number of removals is exactly the number of times `value` appears. And each removal removes one occurrence. So it should remove all occurrences.\n\nSo f1(text, value) returns the string `text` with every occurrence of `value` removed.\n\nNow, let's look at f2:\n  def f2(number):\n      return True if number.isdecimal() else False\n\nThis function returns True if the string `number` consists only of decimal digits (0-9), otherwise False.\n\nNow, the assert statement:\n  assert f2(f1('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')) == \n\nWe need to compute:\n  f1('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')\n\nFirst, remove all 'o's from the string 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn'\n\nOriginal string: 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn'\nRemoving 'o': \n  The string has two 'o's: \n      at index 8: 'o' (in \"tvot\")\n      at index 12: 'o' (in \"foq\")\n  Removing both: \n      scedvtvotkwqfoqn -> \n        without the first 'o': becomes 'scedvtvtkwqfoqn'\n        then without the next 'o': becomes 'scedvtvtkwqfqn'\n\nSo the result of f1 is 'scedvtvtkwqfqn'\n\nNow, we pass this string to f2: \n  f2('scedvtvtkwqfqn') \n\nThis string contains letters, not only digits.
