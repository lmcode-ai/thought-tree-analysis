Let me check: the string is \"akers of a Statement\"\n\n   Actually, after the first word \"akers\", we have a space, then \"of\", then a space, then \"a\", then a space, then \"Statement\".\n\n   So after the 'a' (which is the third word) we have a space. But note: after the 'a' we are at the character at index 9? Actually, let's break:\n\n   The string: \"akers of a Statement\" -> \n        indices: \n          0: 'a'\n          1: 'k'\n          2: 'e'\n          3: 'r'\n          4: 's'\n          5: ' '\n          6: 'o'\n          7: 'f'\n          8: ' '\n          9: 'a'\n          10: ' '\n          11: 'S'\n          ... \n\n   So at index 9: 'a' -> not space -> we do: append b (which at that point was the space from index 8? Actually, let's step again:\n\n   We are at the beginning of the word \"a\" (index 9) and we have just processed the space at index 8. How did we get to index 9?\n\n   After the space at index 5: we set b to ' ' (from the space) and then at index 6: 'o' -> not space -> we appended the current b (which was ' ') and reset b to ''.\n   Then we processed the rest of \"of\": \n        index6: 'o' -> append '' -> then set b to '' -> then index7: 'f' -> append '' -> set b to '' -> then index8: space -> so b becomes ' '.\n\n   Then index9: 'a' -> not space -> so we append b (which is ' ') -> then set b to ''.\n\n   Then we process the rest of the word \"a\": \n        index9: 'a' -> we already did: appended a space and reset b? Then we set b to '' and then the next character is at index10: space.\n\n   So at index10: space -> then we set b to ' ' (so b becomes ' ').\n\n   Then we have the word \"Statement\": \n        index11: 'S' -> not space -> so we append b (which is ' ') -> then set b to ''.\n\n   Then we process the rest of the word: \n        't','a','t','e','m','e','n','t' -> each non-space: so for each we append the current b (which is reset to '' after the first non-space) and then set b to ''.\n\n        So for each letter in \"Statement\", we append an empty string.\n\n   After the loop, note that we do not append the last b. The last b is set to '' because after the last letter we don't have a space.\n\n   How many appends?\n\n   We started with a = ['']\n\n   Then for each non-space character we do an append. But note: we also do an append at the beginning of every non-space run? Actually, the logic:\n\n        For every non-space character, we append the current b and reset b to ''.\n\n        For every space, we add to b.\n\n   So the appends happen at the beginning of every non-space run? And also at every non-space character? Actually, every non-space character triggers an append.\n\n   That means for the word \"akers\" (5 letters) we do 5 appends? But wait:\n\n        We start: a = [''], b=''\n        'a' (non-space): append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['',''] -> then set b to ''\n        'k': append '' -> a becomes ['','',''] -> set b to ''\n        ... until the fifth letter: then we have 5 appends for the 5 letters? So for \"akers\": 5 appends.\n\n        Then the space: we set b to ' '.\n\n        Then the next non-space: 'o' -> we append b (which is ' ') -> so a gets that space -> then set b to ''.\n\n        Then 'f': append '' -> set b to ''.\n\n        Then space: set b to ' '.\n\n        Then 'a': append ' ' -> set b to ''.\n\n        Then space: set b to ' ' (at the space after 'a').\n\n        Then 'S': append ' ' -> set b to ''.\n\n        Then each of the 8 letters in \"Statement\": each will append '' (so 8 appends).\n\n   Total appends:\n\n        initial a: ['']\n\n        Then for \"akers\": 5 appends -> so a has 1 (initial) + 5 = 6 elements? Actually, we started with one element and then appended 5 times -> 6 elements.\n\n        Then for the next word \"of\": \n            at 'o': append -> 7th element\n            at 'f': append -> 8th element\n\n        Then for the word \"a\": \n            at 'a': append -> 9th element\n\n        Then for \"Statement\": \n            at each of the 8 letters: 8 appends -> 17 elements.\n\n        So the length of a is 17.\n\n   Therefore, f2 returns 17.\n\n But wait, let me recount:\n\n        a starts as ['']\n\n        Step 0: a = [''], b=''\n        'a' -> non-space: append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['',''] -> then set b=''\n        'k' -> non-space: append b ('') -> a becomes ['','',''] -> b=''\n        'e' -> non-space: append b -> a becomes ['','','',''] -> b=''\n        'r' -> non-space: append b -> a becomes ['','','','',''] -> b=''\n        's' -> non-space: append b -> a becomes ['','','','','',''] -> b=''\n        ' ' -> space: b becomes ' '\n        'o' -> non-space: append b (which is ' ') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' '] -> then set b=''\n        'f' -> non-space: append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' ',''] -> b=''\n        ' ' -> space: b becomes ' '\n        'a' -> non-space: append b (which is ' ') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' ','',' '] -> b=''\n        ' ' -> space: b becomes ' '\n        'S' -> non-space: append b (which is ' ') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' ','',' ',' '] -> b=''\n        't' -> non-space: append b -> a becomes [ ... , ''] (11th element: empty string) -> then 12th, 13th, ... until 17th? \n\n        Actually, after the 'S' we have 10 elements? Then:\n\n        't': append '' -> 11th element\n        'a': append '' -> 12th\n        't': 13th\n        'e': 14th\n        'm': 15th\n        'e': 16th\n        'n': 17th\n        't': 18th\n\n        So total elements: 1 (initial) + 5 (akers) + 2 (of) + 1 (a) + 1 (for the space before Statement) + 8 (Statement) = 18? \n\n        But note: the initial element is one. Then we did 5 appends for \"akers\", then 2 for \"of\", then 1 for \"a\", then 1 for the space before Statement (when we appended the space at the 'S'), and then 8 for the letters in \"Statement\". That's 1 + 5+2+1+1+8 = 18.\n\n        So the length of a is 18.\n\n   However, let's count the steps:\n\n        We start: a = ['']\n        Then we process \"akers\": 5 appends -> a has 6 elements (index0 to index5)\n        Then we process the space: b becomes ' '\n        Then 'o': append -> element 6: ' '\n        Then 'f': append -> element 7: ''\n        Then space: b becomes ' '\n        Then 'a': append -> element 8: ' '\n        Then space: b becomes ' '\n        Then 'S': append -> element 9: ' '\n        Then each of the 8 letters in \"Statement\": 8 appends -> elements 10 to 17.\n\n        So total: 18 elements? Because the initial list had 1 element and we did 17 appends? 1+17=18.\n\n   Therefore, f2 returns 18.\n\n But wait, the code for f2:\n\n        a = ['']\n        b = ''\n        for i in text:\n            if not i.isspace():\n                a.append(b)\n                b = ''\n            else:\n                b += i\n\n        return len(a)\n\n   The initial a has one element: the empty string.\n\n   Then we do an append for every non-space character. The number of non-space characters in the string \"akers of a Statement\" is:\n\n        \"akers\": 5\n        \"of\": 2\n        \"a\": 1\n        \"Statement\": 8\n\n        Total non-space: 5+2+1+8 = 16.\n\n   So we do 16 appends? Then the total length of a would be 1 (initial) + 16 = 17.\n\n   Why the discrepancy?\n\n   Let me simulate with a smaller string: \"a b\"\n\n        a = [''], b=''\n        first char: 'a' (non-space) -> append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['', ''] -> then set b=''\n        then space: b becomes ' '\n        then 'b': non-space -> append b (which is ' ') -> a becomes ['', '', ' '] -> set b=''\n        Then the loop ends.\n\n        So a has 3 elements -> len(a)=3.\n\n        How many non-space? 2 -> then 1 (initial) + 2 = 3 -> matches.\n\n   Now, in our string: 16 non-space characters -> so we do 16 appends -> total elements: 1+16=17.\n\n   But in the step-by-step above I counted 17 appends? Actually, I thought I counted 17 appends? \n\n   Let me recount the appends in the long string:\n\n        \"akers\": 5 appends (for a,k,e,r,s)\n        \"of\": 2 appends (for o,f)\n        \"a\": 1 append (for a)\n        \"Statement\": 8 appends (for S,t,a,t,e,m,e,n,t)\n\n        Total appends: 5+2+1+8 = 16.\n\n   So the list a becomes:\n\n        initial: ['']\n        after 16 appends: 1+16 = 17 elements.\n\n   Therefore, f2 returns 17.\n\n   But wait, in the step-by-step I thought I had 18? I must have miscounted.\n\n   Actually, in the step-by-step I said:\n\n        a starts with 1 element.\n\n        Then for \"akers\": 5 appends -> total 6.\n        Then for \"of\": 2 appends -> total 8.\n        Then for \"a\": 1 append -> total 9.\n        Then for \"Statement\": 8 appends -> total 17.\n\n   So 17.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 17.\n\n   But note: the initial element is there and we are appending 16 times -> 17.\n\n   So the output of f2(f1('\"Makers of a Statement\"')) is 17.\n\n   However, let's run the code mentally for the string \"akers of a Statement\" in f2:\n\n        a = ['']\n        b = ''\n\n        Step 1: 'a' -> non-space -> append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['',''] -> b becomes ''\n        Step 2: 'k' -> non-space -> append b ('') -> a becomes ['','',''] -> b becomes ''\n        Step 3: 'e' -> non-space -> append b -> a becomes ['','','',''] -> b becomes ''\n        Step 4: 'r' -> non-space -> append b -> a becomes ['','','','',''] -> b becomes ''\n        Step 5: 's' -> non-space -> append b -> a becomes ['','','','','',''] -> b becomes ''\n        Step 6: ' ' -> space -> b becomes ' '\n        Step 7: 'o' -> non-space -> append b (which is ' ') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' '] -> b becomes ''\n        Step 8: 'f' -> non-space -> append b (which is '') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' ',''] -> b becomes ''\n        Step 9: ' ' -> space -> b becomes ' '\n        Step10: 'a' -> non-space -> append b (which is ' ') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' ','',' '] -> b becomes ''\n        Step11: ' ' -> space -> b becomes ' '\n        Step12: 'S' -> non-space -> append b (which is ' ') -> a becomes ['','','','','','',' ','',' ',' '] -> b becomes ''\n        Step13: 't' -> non-space -> append b -> a becomes ... appending '' -> 11th element (index10) is '' -> then 12th,13th,...,17th.\n\n        After step12: we have 10 elements? (because we started at 1 and appended 9 times: 1+9=10? Actually, the initial element is at index0, then we appended 9 times -> 10 elements? But wait, we started with one element and then:\n\n        Step1: append -> 2 elements\n        Step2: append -> 3\n        Step3: 4\n        Step4: 5\n        Step5: 6\n        Step7: 7\n        Step8: 8\n        Step10: 9\n        Step12: 10\n\n        Then step13: 't' -> append -> 11\n        step14: 'a' -> 12\n        step15: 't' -> 13\n        step16: 'e' -> 14\n        step17: 'm' -> 15\n        step18: 'e' -> 16\n        step19: 'n' -> 17\n        step20: 't' -> 18\n\n        But wait, the string \"akers of a Statement\" has 21 characters? Actually, without the quotes and without the first letter:\n\n          Original: '\"Makers of a Statement\"' -> remove quotes: \"Makers of a Statement\" -> then remove first letter: \"akers of a Statement\"\n\n          How many characters? \n            \"akers\": 5\n            space: 1\n            \"of\": 2\n            space: 1\n            \"a\": 1\n            space: 1\n            \"Statement\": 8\n          Total: 5+1+2+1+1+1+8 = 19? \n\n          But note: we removed the first letter, so the original without quotes was 21 characters? \n          Original without quotes: \"Makers of a Statement\" -> \n            Makers: 6, then space, of:2, space, a:1, space, Statement:9? -> 6+1+2+1+1+1+9 = 21? \n          Then removing the first 'M': 20 characters? \n\n          Actually, the string after f1 is \"akers of a Statement\" -> \n            \"akers\" is 5, then space, then \"of\" (2), space, \"a\" (1), space, \"Statement\" (9) -> 5+1+2+1+1+9 = 19.\n\n          So the loop in f2 runs 19 times.\n\n          Steps 1 to 5: the first 5 non-space -> 5 appends -> a has 1+5=6 elements.\n          Step6: space -> b becomes ' '\n          Step7: 'o' -> non-space -> append -> 7th element (which is the space ' ') -> then set b=''\n          Step8: 'f' -> non-space -> append -> 8th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step9: space -> b becomes ' '\n          Step10: 'a' -> non-space -> append -> 9th element (which is ' ') -> set b=''\n          Step11: space -> b becomes ' '\n          Step12: 'S' -> non-space -> append -> 10th element (which is ' ') -> set b=''\n          Step13: 't' -> non-space -> append -> 11th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step14: 'a' -> non-space -> append -> 12th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step15: 't' -> non-space -> append -> 13th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step16: 'e' -> non-space -> append -> 14th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step17: 'm' -> non-space -> append -> 15th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step18: 'e' -> non-space -> append -> 16th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step19: 'n' -> non-space -> append -> 17th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n          Step20: 't' -> non-space -> append -> 18th element (which is '') -> set b=''\n\n          So total elements: 1 (initial) + 18 appends = 19? \n\n          But wait, we only have 16 non-space characters? \n\n          Actually, the string \"akers of a Statement\" has:\n\n            a,k,e,r,s -> 5\n            o,f -> 2\n            a -> 1\n            S,t,a,t,e,m,e,n,t -> 9? \n\n          Wait, \"Statement\" has 9 letters? \n\n          S,t,a,t,e,m,e,n,t -> 9.\n\n          So total non-space: 5+2+1+9 = 17.\n\n          Then why did we get 18 appends? \n\n          Because the loop runs for every character, and for every non-space character we do an append. There are 17 non-space characters -> 17 appends.\n\n          Then the total elements: 1 (initial) + 17 = 18.\n\n          But wait, in the step-by-step above we did 18 appends? \n\n          Actually, we did:\n\n            Step1: 'a' -> append -> count=1\n            Step2: 'k' -> append -> count=2\n            Step3: 'e' -> append -> count=3\n            Step4: 'r' -> append -> count=4\n            Step5: 's' -> append -> count=5\n            Step7: 'o' -> append -> count=6\n            Step8: 'f' -> append -> count=7\n            Step10: 'a' -> append -> count=8\n            Step12: 'S' -> append -> count=9\n            Step13: 't' -> append -> count=10\n            Step14: 'a' -> append -> count=11\n            Step15: 't' -> append -> count=12\n            Step16: 'e' -> append -> count=13\n            Step17: 'm' -> append -> count=14\n            Step18: 'e' -> append -> count=15\n            Step19: 'n' -> append -> count=16\n            Step20: 't' -> append -> count=17\n\n          So 17 appends? \n\n          Then the total elements: 1 (initial) + 17 = 18.\n\n          Therefore, f2 returns 18.\n\n   Now I see: the string has 20 characters? \n\n        \"akers of a Statement\": \n          a k e r s   o f   a   S t a t e m e n t\n          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\n          Actually, let's write:\n\n          \"akers\": 5 letters -> 5\n          space1: 1 -> total 6\n          \"of\": 2 -> total 8\n          space2: 1 -> total 9\n          \"a\": 1 -> total 10\n          space3: 1 -> total 11\n          \"Statement\": 9 letters -> total 20.\n\n          So 20 characters.\n\n          We have 20 steps.\n\n          Non-space characters: 5+2+1+9 = 17 -> so 17 appends.\n\n          Therefore, the list a has 1 (initial) + 17 = 18 elements.\n\n   So the answer is 18.\n\n   But wait, let me double-check the non-space count:\n\n        \"akers\": 5\n        \"of\": 2\n        \"a\": 1\n        \"Statement\": 9 -> total 17.\n\n   And the spaces: 3.\n\n   Total: 20.\n\n   Therefore, the function f2 returns 18.\n\n   However, note that the initial element is an empty string. Then we append 17 times. So 18.\n\n   So the final answer is 18.\n\n   But earlier with the small example \"a b\" we had 3 and that was correct? \n\n        \"a b\": \n          non-space: 2 -> appends: 2 -> total elements: 1+2=3.\n\n   So the method is consistent.\n\n   Therefore, the output of f2(f1('\"Makers of a Statement\"')) is 18.\n\n   However, note that the function f1 returns the string without the first character. The first character of the string after removing quotes is 'M'. So we remove that and get \"akers of a Statement\", which is 20 characters.\n\n   But wait, the original string: '\"Makers of a Statement\"' -> \n        Removing quotes: we remove the starting and ending double quotes? The replace removes all double quotes. So we remove two quotes? \n\n        Actually, the string is: '\"Makers of a Statement\"' -> \n          The first character is \", then M, then ... then \" at the end.\n\n        So after replace('\"', ''): we remove both quotes -> \"Makers of a Statement\" (without quotes) -> 21 characters? \n\n        Then f1 does: \n            s = \"Makers of a Statement\"\n            then returns s[1:] -> \"akers of a Statement\"\n\n        How many characters in \"Makers of a Statement\"? \n            M:1, a:2, k:3, e:4, r:5, s:6 -> that's 6 for the first word.\n            space:7\n            o:8, f:9 -> 2\n            space:10\n            a:11\n            space:12\n            S:13, t:14, a:15, t:16, e:17, m:18, e:19, n:20, t:21.\n\n        So 21 characters? Then s[1:] is from index1 to the end -> 20 characters.\n\n        But wait, the string \"Makers of a Statement\" has 21 characters? \n\n        Actually, count: \n            Makers -> 6 letters? M, a, k, e, r, s -> 6.\n            then space -> 1\n            of -> 2 -> total 6+1+2 = 9\n            space -> 1 -> 10\n            a -> 1 -> 11\n            space -> 1 -> 12\n            Statement -> 9 -> 21.\n\n        So yes, 21. Then s[1:] is 20 characters.\n\n        Now, the non-space characters in \"akers of a Statement\" (which is 20 characters) are:\n\n            akers: 5 (because we removed the 'M', so now 5 letters: a,k,e,r,s)\n            of: 2\n            a: 1\n            Statement: 9\n\n            total: 5+2+1+9 = 17.\n\n        So 17 non-space -> 17 appends -> total elements in a: 1+17=18.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\n   But note: the function f2 might have an off-by-one? \n\n   However, the code for f2 is:\n\n        a = ['']\n        b = ''\n        for i in text:\n            if not i.isspace():\n                a.append(b)\n                b = ''\n            else:\n                b += i\n\n        return len(a)\n\n   We are not appending the last b if the string ends with non-space? But that's okay because after the last non-space we set b to '' and then the loop ends. We don't append the last b if the last character is non-space? \n\n   But in our case, the last character is non-space ('t') -> so we do an append at the last character (appending the current b, which is the space from the previous space? but wait, after the last space we set b to the space, then when we hit the 'S' we appended that space and reset b to ''. Then for the rest of the word, we are appending ''.\n\n   And at the very last character 't', we append '' and then set b to ''.\n\n   So we do append for every non-space, including the last one.\n\n   Therefore, the count is 17 appends -> 18 elements.\n\n   So the answer is 18.\n\n   However, let me run the code in my head for the last part:\n\n        ... after the space before \"Statement\", we have b = ' ' (from the space after 'a').\n\n        Then we see 'S' -> non-space -> so we append b (which is ' ') -> that's one append -> then set b=''.\n\n        Then we see 't' -> non-space -> append b (which is '') -> that's the second append for \"Statement\", and so on.\n\n        The last character is 't' -> non-space -> we append b (which is '') -> that's the 17th append.\n\n        Then the loop ends.\n\n        So a has 1 (initial) + 17 = 18.\n\n   Therefore, the output is 18.\n\n   But note: the initial element is an empty string. And then we appended 17 times.\n\n   So the assert statement should be:\n\n        assert f2(f1('\"Makers of a Statement\"')) == 18\n\n   However, the problem says: \"complete the assert statement with the output\"\n\n   And the output is 18.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\", and \"if the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes\". Since the output is an integer, we just output 18.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\n   But wait, what if the function f1 is incorrect? We assumed it returns \"akers of a Statement\", but what if the while loop runs? \n\n   Let me check the condition in f1 again:\n\n        s = s.replace('\"', '')   -> becomes \"Makers of a Statement\" (without quotes)\n\n        lst = list(s) -> list of 21 characters.\n\n        col = 0\n        count = 1\n        while col < len(lst) and lst[col] in \".:,\":\n\n        The first character is 'M' -> not in \".:,\" -> so the loop doesn't run.\n\n        Then return s[col+count:] -> s[0+1:] -> s[1:]\n\n        So it returns \"akers of a Statement\".\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is 18.\n\n   However, I see that the function f1 has a typo: \n        if lst[col] == \".\":\n            count = ls[col] + 1   # should be lst, and also adding 1 to a string? \n   But since the loop doesn't run, it's not executed.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Output: 18"
