So we insert before the last element, which is at index4? Then the new element will be at index4 and the last element moves to index5.\n\n                So: \n                    original: [0:'a', 1:'k', 2:'o', 3:'o', 4:'n']\n                    insert at index -1 (which is 4) -> so we get:\n                    [0:'a', 1:'k', 2:'o', 3:'o', 4:'s', 5:'n']\n\n        i=1:\n            position = (1*5 - 1)//2 + (1+1)//2 = (5-1)//2 + 2//2 = 4//2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n            Now the current list is: ['a','k','o','o','s','n'] (length=6)\n            We insert 'X' at index 3? \n            So: \n                at index3: currently is 'o'\n                inserting at index3: \n                    becomes: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n']\n\n        i=2:\n            position = (2*5 - 1)//2 + (2+1)//2 = (10-1)//2 + 3//2 = 9//2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5? \n            Because 9//2 is 4 (integer division) and 3//2 is 1 -> 4+1=5.\n            Now the current list is: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n'] (length=7)\n            Inserting at index5: \n                becomes: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','o','n']? \n            But wait, we are inserting the third sign which is 'o'. \n\n        So the result of f1('akoon','sXo') is: 'akoXoson'\n\n        Let me double-check the positions:\n\n        Step-by-step:\n\n          Start: \"akoon\" -> list: ['a','k','o','o','n']\n\n          i=0: insert 's' at position -1 -> \n                positions: \n                  original: \n                    0: a, 1: k, 2: o, 3: o, 4: n\n                insert at -1: which is the same as inserting at the last element's position? \n                Actually, the rule for list.insert(i, x): \n                  Insert x before the position i. \n                So at i=-1: \n                  The last element is at index 4 (which is also referred to as -1). So we insert before index4? \n                  Then the list becomes: \n                    [a, k, o, o, s, n]   -> because we insert at the position that was the last element, so the last element moves to the next index.\n\n          i=1: insert 'X' at position 3: \n                current list: [a, k, o, o, s, n] -> indices: \n                  0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:o, 4:s, 5:n\n                insert at index3: so we put 'X' at index3, and shift the rest: \n                becomes: [a, k, o, 'X', o, s, n]\n\n          i=2: insert 'o' at position 5: \n                current list: [a, k, o, X, o, s, n] -> indices 0 to 6\n                insert at index5: \n                  becomes: [a, k, o, X, o, s, 'o', n]   -> because we insert before the element at index5? \n                But wait, at index5 currently is 's'. So we insert before 's'? \n                Actually, we are inserting at index5: \n                  [0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:X, 4:o, 5:o, 6:s, 7:n]? \n                But wait, we inserted at index5: \n                  The current element at index5 is 's'? Actually, in the list [a,k,o,X,o,s,n] the index5 is 's' and index6 is 'n'. \n                Inserting at index5: \n                  We get: \n                    indices 0-4: same\n                    index5: becomes the new element 'o'\n                    then the old index5 and 6 become 6 and 7: \n                  So: \n                    [a, k, o, X, o, o, s, n]\n\n        Therefore, the string becomes: \"akoXoosn\"\n\n        But wait, let me recount the insertion at i=2:\n\n          Formula: (2*5-1)//2 + (2+1)//2 = (10-1)//2 + 3//2 = 9//2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n          The list at step i=2 is: \n            ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n'] -> length=7, so indices 0 to 6.\n          We are inserting at index5: \n            So we break the list at index5: \n              [0:'a',1:'k',2:'o',3:'X',4:'o'] and then [5:'s',6:'n']\n            Inserting at index5: we put the new element between index4 and index5? \n            Actually, we put it at the position that becomes index5, and the element that was at index5 becomes index6, and so on.\n\n          So: \n            [0:'a',1:'k',2:'o',3:'X',4:'o', 5:'o', 6:'s', 7:'n'] -> so the string is \"akoXoosn\"\n\n        Therefore, f1 returns 'akoXoosn'\n\n Now, we have to compute f2(f1('akoon','sXo')) = f2('akoXoosn')\n\n What does f2 do?\n   f2(text): \n        a = text.split('\\n')   -> splits the text by newline. Since there is no newline in 'akoXoosn', we get a list with one element: ['akoXoosn']\n        Then, for each element in the list, it replaces every tab character with four spaces. \n        But there are no tabs in the string, so it remains the same.\n\n        Then it joins the list by '\\n'. Since there's only one element, the result is 'akoXoosn'\n\n Therefore, the final result is 'akoXoosn'\n\n However, let me check the insertion positions again because the problem might have a different interpretation.\n\n Alternative calculation for f1:\n\n  The formula: (i * length - 1) // 2 + (i + 1) // 2\n\n  We have length=5.\n\n  i=0: (0-1)//2 + (1)//2 = (-1)//2 + 0 = -1 (since -1//2 is -1 in Python) + 0 = -1.\n\n  i=1: (5-1)//2 + 2//2 = 4//2 + 1 = 2+1 = 3.\n\n  i=2: (10-1)//2 + 3//2 = 9//2 + 1 = 4+1 = 5.\n\n  Now, the initial list: ['a','k','o','o','n'] (length=5)\n\n  Insertions:\n\n    At i=0: insert at -1 -> \n        We can think of negative indices: \n          The list has indices: 0,1,2,3,4 and negative indices: -5,-4,-3,-2,-1.\n        Inserting at index -1: \n          The current last element is at index -1 (which is the same as 4). \n          Inserting at index -1 means the new element becomes the new last but one? \n          Actually, the list becomes: \n            [a, k, o, o, s, n]   -> because we insert before the last element? \n          But note: the last element is at index -1, so we insert before it. Then the new element is at index -2? and the last element remains at the end.\n\n    Then the list becomes: \n        indices: \n          0: a\n          1: k\n          2: o\n          3: o\n          4: s   -> inserted at -1, so now the last element is n at index5? \n          but wait, we have 6 elements: \n          [0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:o, 4:s, 5:n]\n\n    Then at i=1: insert at index3: \n        The list is now 6 elements. Index3 is the fourth element? \n        Original indices: \n          0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:o, 4:s, 5:n\n        Inserting at index3: \n          We get: \n            [a, k, o, 'X', o, s, n] -> because we put 'X' at index3, and the element that was at index3 (which is 'o') moves to index4, and so on.\n\n    Then at i=2: insert at index5: \n        The list now has 7 elements: \n          [0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:X, 4:o, 5:s, 6:n]\n        Inserting at index5: \n          We break the list: \n            [0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:X, 4:o] and then [5:s, 6:n] \n          Inserting at index5: we put the new element at index5, and shift the rest: \n          [0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:X, 4:o, 5:'o', 6:s, 7:n] -> so the string is \"akoXoosn\"\n\n  Therefore, the result is \"akoXoosn\"\n\n  But wait, the expected output might be different? Let me see if the formula is applied correctly.\n\n  Alternatively, note that the formula: \n      (i * length - 1) // 2 + (i + 1) // 2\n\n  We can write it as: \n      = (i*5 - 1) // 2 + (i+1)//2\n\n  For i=0: (0-1)//2 = -1, and (0+1)//2 = 0 -> -1+0 = -1.\n  For i=1: (5-1)//2 = 4//2=2, and (1+1)//2=2//2=1 -> 2+1=3.\n  For i=2: (10-1)//2=9//2=4, and (2+1)//2=3//2=1 -> 4+1=5.\n\n  So the positions are -1, 3, 5.\n\n  Now, the insertions are done in the original list? or in the growing list?\n\n  The code does:\n\n      new_text = list(text)   -> initial list: ['a','k','o','o','n']\n\n      Then for i in range(len(sign)):\n          new_text.insert( ... , sign[i])\n\n  So the insertions are done sequentially in the same list.\n\n  Therefore, the positions are computed relative to the current state of the list? \n\n  But note: the formula uses the original length (5) for every i? \n\n  The variable `length` is set at the beginning: `length = len(text)` and never updated.\n\n  So the positions are computed based on the original length, not the current length.\n\n  Therefore, the positions we calculated are fixed: \n      i=0: -1\n      i=1: 3\n      i=2: 5\n\n  However, when we insert, the list grows. So the index -1 in the first insertion (when the list has 5 elements) is the last element.\n\n  But for the second insertion, the list has 6 elements. The position 3 is within the range [0,5] (if we consider 0-indexed and the list has 6 elements, then indices 0 to 5). So 3 is the fourth element.\n\n  For the third insertion, the list has 7 elements. The position 5 is the sixth element? (because 0-indexed: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -> so 5 is the sixth element).\n\n  Therefore, the insertions:\n\n      Start: ['a','k','o','o','n'] (length=5)\n\n      Insert at -1: \n          becomes: ['a','k','o','o','s','n']   (length=6)\n\n      Insert at 3: \n          The list is now 6 elements: \n             0: 'a'\n             1: 'k'\n             2: 'o'\n             3: 'o'\n             4: 's'\n             5: 'n'\n          Inserting at index3: \n             we get: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n']   (length=7)\n\n      Insert at 5: \n          The list is now 7 elements: \n             0: 'a'\n             1: 'k'\n             2: 'o'\n             3: 'X'\n             4: 'o'\n             5: 's'\n             6: 'n'\n          Inserting at index5: \n             we get: \n                 ['a','k','o','X','o','o','s','n']   (because we insert at the position of the current element at index5, which is 's', so we put 'o' at index5 and shift the rest)\n\n      So the string is \"akoXoosn\"\n\n  But wait, the last insertion: \n        We are inserting at index5: \n          The current element at index5 is 's'. We insert before it? \n          So the new element becomes index5 and the 's' becomes index6, and 'n' becomes index7.\n\n          So: \n            indices: \n              0: 'a'\n              1: 'k'\n              2: 'o'\n              3: 'X'\n              4: 'o'\n              5: 'o'   (inserted)\n              6: 's'\n              7: 'n'\n\n          Therefore, the string is \"akoXooosn\"? \n\n  But wait, that doesn't match because we inserted only one 'o'. \n\n  Actually, the sign for the third insertion is the third character of 'sXo', which is 'o'. \n\n  So the string is \"akoXooosn\"? \n\n  But that would be 8 characters? \n\n  Let me count: \n      a k o X o o s n -> 8 characters? \n      But the original was 5, and we inserted 3, so 8 is correct.\n\n  However, in the second insertion we inserted at index3: \n        Original: ['a','k','o','o','s','n'] -> inserting at index3: \n          We break the list: \n            [0:'a',1:'k',2:'o'] and then [3:'o',4:'s',5:'n'] \n          Inserting at index3: we put 'X' at index3, so the list becomes:\n            [0:'a',1:'k',2:'o',3:'X',4:'o',5:'s',6:'n'] -> 7 elements.\n\n  Then third insertion: at index5 in a 7-element list: \n        The list: \n          0:'a'\n          1:'k'\n          2:'o'\n          3:'X'\n          4:'o'\n          5:'s'\n          6:'n'\n        Inserting at index5: \n          We break: \n            [0,1,2,3,4] -> ['a','k','o','X','o'] and then [5,6] -> ['s','n']\n          Insert at index5: so we put the new element at the position that was the start of the second part? \n          Then the new list: \n            [0:'a',1:'k',2:'o',3:'X',4:'o',5:'o',6:'s',7:'n'] -> so the string is \"akoXooosn\" -> 8 characters.\n\n  But wait, the formula for the third insertion: \n        (2*5-1)//2 + (2+1)//2 = (10-1)//2 + 3//2 = 9//2 + 1 = 4+1=5.\n\n  And the list at the time of the third insertion has 7 elements, so index5 is the sixth element? \n        indices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -> so index5 is the sixth element (which is 's').\n\n  Inserting at index5: we put the new element at index5, and the element that was at index5 becomes index6, and the element at index6 becomes index7.\n\n  So the string is \"akoXooosn\" -> but that has two 'o's in a row? \n\n  Actually, the original had two 'o's: \"akoon\", and we inserted an 'X' between the two 'o's? \n\n  But let me write the string: \n        a k o X o o s n -> that's \"akoXoosn\" if we count 8 characters? \n        But wait: \n          a, k, o, X, o, o, s, n -> that's 8 characters: \"akoXoosn\" is 8? \n          Actually, \"akoXoosn\" is 8: \n            a, k, o, X, o, o, s, n -> but that's 8.\n\n  However, the string we built step by step is: \n        Step0: insert 's' at -1: \n            original: \"akoon\" -> becomes \"akoosn\"? \n            But we did: \n                original: ['a','k','o','o','n'] -> insert at -1: \n                becomes: ['a','k','o','o','s','n'] -> which is \"akoosn\"\n\n        Step1: insert 'X' at 3: \n            \"akoosn\" -> \n                indices: \n                  0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:o, 4:s, 5:n\n                insert at 3: \n                  becomes: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n'] -> \"akoXosn\"\n\n        Step2: insert 'o' at 5: \n            \"akoXosn\" -> \n                indices: \n                  0:a, 1:k, 2:o, 3:X, 4:o, 5:s, 6:n\n                insert at 5: \n                  becomes: ['a','k','o','X','o','o','s','n'] -> \"akoXoosn\"\n\n  So the final string is \"akoXoosn\", which is 8 characters.\n\n  Therefore, f1 returns \"akoXoosn\"\n\n  Then f2 does nothing because there are no tabs or newlines, so returns \"akoXoosn\"\n\n  So the assert statement should be: 'akoXoosn'\n\n  But wait, the test case: \n        f2(f1('akoon', 'sXo')) \n\n  We have: \n        f1('akoon','sXo') -> 'akoXoosn'\n        f2('akoXoosn') -> 'akoXoosn'\n\n  Therefore, the output is 'akoXoosn'\n\n  However, note that the function f1 might be intended to do something else? \n\n  Let me run a small simulation in my head with the original formula and the steps.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write a small test:\n\n      text = 'akoon'\n      sign = 'sXo'\n\n      Step0: \n          i=0: position = (0*5-1)//2 + (0+1)//2 = (-1)//2 + 1//2 = -1 + 0 = -1.\n          Insert 's' at -1: \n              list becomes: \n                 ['a','k','o','o','s','n']   (because we insert before the last element? which is at index4, so we put 's' at index4 and the last element moves to index5)\n\n      Step1: \n          i=1: position = (1*5-1)//2 + (1+1)//2 = (4)//2 + 2//2 = 2+1 = 3.\n          Now the list is: ['a','k','o','o','s','n'] -> length=6.\n          Insert 'X' at index3: \n              The element at index3 is 'o'. We insert before it? \n              So: \n                 ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n']\n\n      Step2:\n          i=2: position = (2*5-1)//2 + (2+1)//2 = 9//2 + 3//2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n          Now the list is: ['a','k','o','X','o','s','n'] -> length=7.\n          Insert 'o' at index5: \n              The element at index5 is 's'. We insert before it? \n              So: \n                 ['a','k','o','X','o','o','s','n'] -> \"akoXoosn\"\n\n  Therefore, the result is indeed \"akoXoosn\".\n\n  So the answer is 'akoXoosn'"
