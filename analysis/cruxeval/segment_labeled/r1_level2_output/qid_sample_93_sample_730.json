Example: If n = \"iq\", then:\n    length = len(\"iq\") + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\n    revn = ['i','q']\n    result = \"iq\"\n    revn.clear() -> becomes empty list, but result is still \"iq\"\n    return \"iq\" + \"!!!!\" -> \"iq!!!! \"\n\nNow, f2: Input: text (a string)\n  Steps:\n    m = 0   (to keep track of the maximum length encountered so far)\n    cnt = 0 (to count the number of times we update the maximum length) We split the text by spaces -> so we get a list of words.
