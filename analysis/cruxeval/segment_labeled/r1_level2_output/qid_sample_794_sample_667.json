So we are concatenating without any separator. So f1 returns: \"normalcharsqwet42\"\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.

  "original_reasoning": "We are given two functions: f1 and f2.\n We are to compute: f2(f1(\"\\\"\\\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'\"))\n\n First, let's compute f1(\"\\\"\\\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'\").\n\n The function f1(line) processes the string by including only alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).\n\n The input string: \"\\\"\\\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'\"\n\n Let's break it down:\n\n   \"   -> not alphanumeric -> skip\n   \\   -> not alphanumeric -> skip\n   %   -> not alphanumeric -> skip\n   $   -> not alphanumeric -> skip\n   space -> not alphanumeric -> skip\n   'n' -> alphanumeric -> include -> 'n'\n   'o' -> alphanumeric -> include -> 'o'\n   ... and so on.\n\n We can write out the alphanumeric characters:\n\n   \"normalcharsqwet42\"\n\n But note: the string has spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters.\n\n Let's go step by step:\n\n   The string: \"\\\"\\\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'\"\n\n   Removing non-alphanumeric:\n\n     n, o, r, m, a, l, c, h, a, r, s, q, w, e, t, 4, 2\n\n   So the result of f1 is: \"normalcharsqwet42\"\n\n However, note that the original string has two words: \"normal\" and \"chars\", and then \"qwet42\". \n There is a space between \"normal\" and \"chars\", and then between \"chars\" and \"qwet42\" there is \"$%~ \".\n\n So we skip the non-alphanumeric and get:\n\n   \"normal\" (without space) -> \"normal\"\n   then \"chars\" -> \"chars\"\n   then \"qwet42\" -> \"qwet42\"\n\n Therefore, the string becomes: \"normalcharsqwet42\"\n\n But wait, the original string has a space after \"normal\", then \"chars\", then more non-alphanumeric and then \"qwet42\". \n So we are concatenating without any separator.\n\n So f1 returns: \"normalcharsqwet42\"\n\n Now, we pass this string to f2.\n\n The function f2(text) does:\n\n   It splits the text into chunks of 3 characters and for each chunk it creates a string of the form:\n        \"< {chunk} level={i} >\"\n\n   Then, if there is a last part (if the length is not divisible by 3), it appends:\n        \"< {last_item} level={len(text)//3} >\"\n\n Steps for f2 on input \"normalcharsqwet42\":\n\n   Length of text: 17 (because \"normalcharsqwet42\" has 17 characters)\n\n   How many chunks of 3? 17 // 3 = 5 (with remainder 2).\n\n   So we will have 5 chunks (i from 0 to 4) and then one last chunk of 2 characters.\n\n   Chunks:\n\n     i=0: text[0:3] -> \"nor\" -> \"< nor level=0 >\"\n     i=1: text[3:6] -> \"mal\" -> \"< mal level=1 >\"\n     i=2: text[6:9] -> \"cha\" -> \"< cha level=2 >\"\n     i=3: text[9:12] -> \"rsq\" -> \"< rsq level=3 >\"\n     i=4: text[12:15] -> \"wet\" -> \"< wet level=4 >\"\n\n   Then the last part: text[15:17] -> \"42\" -> \"< 42 level=5 >\"\n\n   Note: the level for the last part is len(text)//3 = 17//3 = 5.\n\n   So the list returned by f2 is:\n\n     [\n        \"< nor level=0 >\",\n        \"< mal level=1 >\",\n        \"< cha level=2 >\",\n        \"< rsq level=3 >\",\n        \"< wet level=4 >\",\n        \"< 42 level=5 >\"\n     ]\n\n But note: the function f2 returns a list of strings.\n\n However, the assert statement is comparing the output of f2(f1(...)) to ... (but the problem says to complete the assert statement with the output).\n\n But the problem says: \"complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case.\"\n\n And then: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.\"\n\n And then: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement. If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\"\n\n However, note that the output of f2 is a list of strings. So we should represent the list.\n\n But the problem says: \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" But our output is a list. So we represent the list as it is, with the inner strings in single quotes.\n\n How should we represent the list?\n\n   We can write: \n        ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the exact formatting of the list. But in Python, the list of strings would be printed with single quotes by default.\n\n But wait: the function f2 uses double quotes in the f-string? Actually, the f-string uses double quotes on the outside, but the representation of the string in the list would use single quotes to avoid escaping.\n\n Example: \n      f\"< {chunk} level={i} >\" \n\n The string inside is without quotes. So the actual string is: \n      \"< nor level=0 >\"\n\n When we represent the list in Python, it uses single quotes for the string if there are double quotes inside? Actually, no: the string itself doesn't contain any quotes, so it can be represented with single quotes.\n\n Therefore, the expected output is:\n\n   ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n But note: the problem says to output the result of the function call. Since the function returns a list, we output the list.\n\n However, the problem says: \"complete the assert statement\", but then says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement\".\n\n So we are to output the list as it would be in the assert.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" - but our output is a list. So we don't enclose the entire list in quotes? We just write the list.\n\n How about we write the list as a Python literal?\n\n   We have a list of 6 strings.\n\n   We write: \n        ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n However, note that the spaces inside the string are preserved. The function f2 does not remove spaces? But note: the input to f2 is \"normalcharsqwet42\", which has no spaces. So the chunks are without spaces.\n\n But wait: the function f2 uses the string as is. The chunks are:\n\n   \"nor\", \"mal\", \"cha\", \"rsq\", \"wet\", \"42\"\n\n So the strings in the list are:\n\n   \"< nor level=0 >\" -> note: there is a space after '<' and before the chunk, and then after the chunk and before 'level', and then after the '='.\n\n   This is exactly as the f-string: f\"< {chunk} level={i} >\"\n\n   So the string has:\n\n        < (space) nor (space) level=0 (space) >\n\n   But note: the f-string: \n        f\"< {text[i*3:i*3+3]} level={i} >\"\n\n   This will produce: \n        \"< nor level=0 >\"\n\n   So the representation is correct.\n\n Therefore, the output of f2(f1(...)) is the list:\n\n   ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n But note: the problem says to output without any extra information. So we output that list.\n\n However, the problem says: \"complete the assert statement\", meaning we are to write the right-hand side of the assert.\n\n But the instruction says: \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement.\"\n\n So we are to output:\n\n        ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" - but our output is a list. So we don't enclose the entire list in quotes. We write the list as above.\n\n However, to be safe, note that the problem expects the exact representation.\n\n Let me double-check the length of the string from f1:\n\n   Input: \"\\\"\\\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'\"\n\n   We break down:\n\n      \" -> skip\n      \\ -> skip\n      % -> skip\n      $ -> skip\n        -> skip\n      n -> keep\n      o -> keep\n      r -> keep\n      m -> keep\n      a -> keep\n      l -> keep\n        -> skip\n      c -> keep\n      h -> keep\n      a -> keep\n      r -> keep\n      s -> keep\n        -> skip\n      $ -> skip\n      % -> skip\n      ~ -> skip\n        -> skip\n      q -> keep\n      w -> keep\n      e -> keep\n      t -> keep\n      4 -> keep\n      2 -> keep\n      ' -> skip\n\n   So the kept characters: \"normalcharsqwet42\" -> 17 characters.\n\n   Now, in f2:\n\n      Chunk0: index0 to 2: \"nor\"\n      Chunk1: index3 to 5: \"mal\"\n      Chunk2: index6 to 8: \"cha\"\n      Chunk3: index9 to 11: \"rsq\"\n      Chunk4: index12 to 14: \"wet\"\n      Last: index15 to 16: \"42\"\n\n   So the list is as above.\n\n Therefore, the output is:\n\n        ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n But note: the problem says to complete the assert statement. However, we are only to return the output.\n\n Since the problem says: \"Only return the output of the function\", we output the list.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Do not output any extra information\", so we output the list as a string representation.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If the output is a string, enclose it in single quotes.\" - meaning if the function returns a string, then we output it in quotes. But if it returns a list, we output the list representation.\n\n So we write:\n\n        ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n But wait: the problem says \"complete the assert statement\", but then says \"Only return the output of the function without any other information and assert statement\". So we are not writing the entire assert, just the output.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        ['< nor level=0 >', '< mal level=1 >', '< cha level=2 >', '< rsq level=3 >', '< wet level=4 >', '< 42 level=5 >']\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"which may contain errors\", but in this case, the functions seem to run without errors.\n\n But let me check the function f2: \n\n   It does: \n        for i in range(len(text) // 3):   # integer division, so for 17: 17//3 = 5, so i from 0 to 4 -> 5 iterations.\n\n        Then: last_item = text[len(text)//3 * 3:]   -> 5*3 = 15, so text[15:] -> \"42\"\n\n        Then appends: f\"< {last_item} level={len(text)//3} >\" -> level=5\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n Therefore, the output is as above."
