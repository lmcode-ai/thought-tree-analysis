Then the condition `len(nums) > (count//2)` will be 0 > (some non-negative number) which is False? Actually, let's see:\n\nExample: \nIf initially `nums` has length 5, then count=5, and count//2 = 2. The condition is: while len(nums) > 2. Then we clear `nums` so len becomes 0. Then condition becomes 0>2? False -> loop stops.\n\nBut what if the initial length is 0? Then count=0, count//2=0.
