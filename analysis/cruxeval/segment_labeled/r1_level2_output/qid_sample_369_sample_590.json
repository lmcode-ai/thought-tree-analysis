If `var` consists only of digits (isdigit() returns True), return \"int\".\n2. Else if, after removing one decimal point (if present), the string is digits, return \"float\".\n3. Else if, the number of spaces in `var` equals the length of `var` minus one, return \"str\". \n   This condition implies that there is exactly one non-space character? Actually, if there are `n` spaces and the length is `n+1`, then there is one non-space. But note: the condition is `var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1`. So if the string has length L, and there are L-1 spaces, then there is exactly one non-space? Actually, no: because the total length is the number of spaces plus the number of non-spaces. So if there are L-1 spaces, then the number of non-spaces is 1. So the string is one non-space and the rest spaces? But note: the condition does not specify the position. However, the condition is just about the count.\n\n   Example: \"a   \" (if there are 3 spaces and one 'a', then length=4, and count of spaces is 3 which equals 4-1 -> true). Similarly, \"   a   \" would have 6 spaces? Actually, no: the string \"   a   \" has 6 characters? Actually, it has 3 spaces, then 'a', then 3 spaces -> total 7. Then count of spaces is 6? Actually, no: the string \"   a   \" has 3 spaces at the beginning, one 'a', and then 3 spaces at the end -> total 7 characters. The count of spaces is 6? Actually, 3+3=6. Then 6 == 7-1 -> 6==6 -> true. So condition holds.\n\n   But note: the condition does not require the non-space to be in the middle.
