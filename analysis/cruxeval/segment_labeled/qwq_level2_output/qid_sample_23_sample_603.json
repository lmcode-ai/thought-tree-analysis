  "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out what the output of the given code is when the test case is executed, so I can complete the assert statement correctly. Let me start by understanding the functions involved here.\n\nFirst, there are two functions: f1 and f2. The test case is calling f2 with the result of f1('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-'). So I need to first run the input string through f1, then pass that result to f2, and see what f2 returns.\n\nStarting with f1. The function f1 takes two parameters: text and chars. The purpose of f1 seems to be to strip certain characters from the end of the text. Let me look at the code for f1 again.\n\nThe code for f1 is:\n\ndef f(text, chars):\n    if chars:\n        text = text.rstrip(chars)\n    else:\n        text = text.rstrip(' ')\n    if text == '':\n        return '-'\n    return text\n\nWait, the function is named f, but in the problem description, it's referred to as f1. Maybe that's a typo, but the code here is using def f(text, chars). But the user probably just named them f1 and f2 for clarity. So I'll proceed assuming that the first function is f1, which is actually named f in the code. So when the test case calls f1, that's the function f as written here.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the string 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' with the chars parameter being '0123456789-'. Let's see what that does.\n\nThe function f1 (the first function) checks if chars is truthy. Since the chars passed here is a string containing digits and '-', which is non-empty, so the first condition is true. So it does text.rstrip(chars). The rstrip method removes trailing characters that are in the given set. So it will remove any characters from the end of the string that are in '0123456789-'.\n\nThe input text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'. Let's look at the end of this string. The last part is '2.2'. Wait, let me write out the string exactly:\n\nThe string is: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\nWait, let me check the exact characters. The string ends with '2.2', so the last characters are '2', '.', '2'. The chars to strip are digits (0-9) and '-'. So the rstrip will remove from the end any of those characters until a character not in that set is found.\n\nLet's break down the string's end:\n\nThe original string's end is '2.2'. The last character is '2', which is in the chars (digits and '-'). So rstrip would remove that. Then the previous character is '.', which is not in the chars, so it stops. Wait, no, wait: the rstrip removes trailing characters that are in the set. So starting from the end, it removes all characters that are in the set until it hits a character not in the set. Let's see:\n\nThe string ends with '2.2', so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, let me think again. Let me write the string's end properly. The full string is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'. The part after 'XQuery' is '2.2', so the last characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the actual order is '2.2' is the last part. So the last character is the second '2', then before that is '.', then the first '2', then before that maybe more characters. Wait, perhaps I should write the entire string's ending step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the string step by step. Let's take the input text:\n\nOriginal text: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\nThe chars to strip are '0123456789-' (digits and hyphen). The rstrip(chars) will remove from the end any characters that are in that set. Let's look at the end of the string.\n\nThe last character is '2' (from the '2.2'), which is a digit, so it's in the set. So we remove that. Then the next character is '.' which is not in the set, so we stop. Wait, but the '.' is before the last '2', so after removing the last '2', the next character is '.' which is not in the set. So the stripped string would end at the '.'.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take the entire string and see the end:\n\nThe string is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\nBreaking down the end:\n\nThe last few characters are '2.2' (assuming that the '2.2' is the version number). So the last character is the second '2', then before that is '.', then the first '2', then before that is the 'XQuery' part. Wait, perhaps the exact sequence is:\n\nThe string ends with '2.2', so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait no, the order is '2.2' is written as '2' followed by '.' followed by '2', so the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then the first '2' is before that. Wait, no, the actual order is the string ends with '2.2', so the last character is the second '2', the previous is '.', then the first '2', then before that is the 'XQuery' part. So when we process from the end:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n- The last character is '2' (digit, so in the set). Remove it.\n\n- Now the next character is '.' (not in the set, so stop here.\n\nWait, but the '.' is before the last '2', so after removing the last '2', the next character is '.' which is not in the set. So the rstrip would stop there. So the resulting string after stripping would be everything up to and including the '.'.\n\nWait, but the original string's end is '2.2', so after stripping the last '2', the string would end with '2.'? Wait, let me think again. Let's take the example:\n\nSuppose the string is 'abc2.2', then rstrip with '2' would remove the last '2', resulting in 'abc2.'.\n\nWait, in this case, the original string's end is '2.2', so after stripping the trailing '2', the string would end with '2.'? Wait, no, the original string's last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the actual order is the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then the first '2' is before that. So the string ends with '2.2', so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the correct order is the '.' comes between the two '2's. So the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? No, that's not right. Let me think of the actual string:\n\nThe string is 'XQuery 2.2', so the last part is '2.2', which is the version. So the characters are '2', '.', '2', so the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then the first '2' is before that. So the entire string's last few characters are '2.2'.\n\nSo when we do rstrip with the characters including digits and '-', the rstrip will remove the last '2' (since it's a digit), then check the previous character which is '.' (not in the set), so it stops. So the resulting string after stripping would be everything except the last '2', so the string ends with '2.'.\n\nWait, but the original string's end is '2.2', so after removing the last '2', the string would end with '2.'? So the entire string after f1 processing would be the original string with the last '2' stripped off?\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to the string. Let me think of the entire input string again:\n\nThe input to f1 is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\nSo the entire string is:\n\n\"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2\"\n\nSo the last part is \"2.2\", so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2' (the order is '2' followed by '.' followed by '2'? Wait no, the actual order is the '.' is between the two '2's. So the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? No, the actual order is the '.' is between the two '2's, so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then the first '2' is before that. So the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the last character is the second '2', so the last three characters are the '.' and the two '2's? Let me think of the string as:\n\nThe string ends with \"2.2\", so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? No, that's not correct. Let me write it as characters:\n\nThe string \"2.2\" is made of three characters: '2', '.', '2'. So the last character is the third '2', the one before that is '.', then the first '2' is the first character of that substring. So the entire string's last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the order is first '2', then '.', then '2', so the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then before that is the first '2'.\n\nSo when we do rstrip with the characters including digits and '-', the rstrip will process from the end. The last character is '2' (digit, so in the set), so it's removed. Then the next character is '.' (not in the set), so we stop. So the resulting string after stripping would be the original string with the last '2' removed. So the end becomes \"2.\" instead of \"2.2\".\n\nWait, but the original string's end is \"2.2\", so after removing the last '2', the end is \"2.\".\n\nSo the entire string after f1 processing would be:\n\n\"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.\"\n\nWait, but maybe there are more characters before that. Let me confirm the entire string again. The input to f1 is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', so after stripping the last '2', the result is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.\n\nWait, but perhaps there are other characters to strip. Let me check the entire string again. The chars parameter is '0123456789-', so the rstrip will remove any of those characters from the end. Let me check the entire string's end again.\n\nThe string after 'XQuery' is ' 2.2' (assuming there's a space before the 2?), or maybe not. Let me parse the input string exactly as given:\n\nThe input text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe part after 'XQuery' is ' 2.2'? Or is it 'XQuery2.2'? Wait, the input is written as 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', so there's a space between 'XQuery' and '2.2', so the last part is ' 2.2'. So the last characters are space, '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the space is before the '2', so the last part is ' 2.2', so the last characters are '2', '.', '2', but before that is a space. Wait, let me write the entire string's end:\n\nThe string ends with 'XQuery 2.2', so the last few characters are:\n\n' ', '2', '.', '2' (the space comes after 'XQuery', then '2', '.', '2').\n\nWait, so the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then '2', then a space, then 'XQuery', etc.\n\nSo when we do rstrip with the chars being digits and '-', the space is not in the chars (since the chars are digits and '-'). Wait, the chars parameter passed is '0123456789-', so the hyphen is included, but the space is not. So the rstrip will only remove characters that are in that set. The space is not part of the chars, so it won't be stripped unless it's at the end and part of the chars. Wait, the space is not in the chars, so the rstrip will stop at the first non-allowed character from the end.\n\nSo let's process the end step by step:\n\nStarting from the end of the string:\n\n- The last character is '2' (digit, so in the set). Remove it.\n\n- Next character is '.' (not in the set). So we stop here.\n\nWait, but before that, the '.' is the previous character. Wait, the order is:\n\nThe string ends with '2.2', so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the actual order is the '.' is between the two '2's. So the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? No, the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then the first '2' is before that. So the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the first '2' is before the '.'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the entire string's end as:\n\nThe string is 'XQuery 2.2', so the last part is '2.2', so the characters are:\n\n'2', '.', '2' (so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? No, the last character is the second '2', the one before that is '.', then the first '2' is before that. So the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the first '2' is the first character of the '2.2', so the order is '2', '.', '2', so the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? Wait, that can't be. Let me think of the string as \"2.2\" being the last part. The first character of that is '2', then '.', then '2', so the last character is the second '2'. So the last three characters are '2', '.', '2'? No, the last three would be the '.' and the two '2's? Wait, no, the last three characters are the '.' and the two '2's? Let me count:\n\nThe string \"2.2\" has three characters: index 0: '2', index 1: '.', index 2: '2'. So the last character is index 2 (the second '2'), the one before that is index 1 (the '.'), then index 0 (the first '2'). So when processing from the end:\n\n- The last character is '2' (index 2) \u2192 in the set (digits and '-'), so remove it.\n\n- Now, the next character is '.' (index 1) \u2192 not in the set, so stop.\n\nSo the stripped string would end at index 1 (the '.'), so the part after 'XQuery' would be ' 2.' (since there was a space before the first '2'). Wait, the original string has a space before the '2'? Let me check again.\n\nThe input text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', so after 'XQuery' there's a space, then '2.2'. So the part after 'XQuery' is ' 2.2', so the last characters are ' ', '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the space is before the '2', so the entire '2.2' is preceded by a space. So the last few characters are ' ', '2', '.', '2'.\n\nWait, so the entire string's last few characters are:\n\nThe last four characters are ' ', '2', '.', '2'? No, the space is before the '2', so the last four would be '2', '.', '2', but the space is part of the preceding characters. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the entire string's end as:\n\nThe string ends with ' 2.2', so the last four characters are ' ', '2', '.', '2'? No, the space is before the '2', so the last four would be '2', '.', '2', but the space is part of the preceding characters. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the entire string as:\n\nOriginal text: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'\n\nBreaking it down, the part after 'XQuery' is ' 2.2', so the last part is a space followed by '2.2'. So the last characters are ' ', '2', '.', '2'? Wait, no, the space is before the '2', so the last four characters would be '2', '.', '2', but the space is part of the preceding characters. Wait, perhaps the last four characters are '2', '.', '2', but the space is before that. Hmm, maybe I should just process the entire string step by step.\n\nThe key point is that when we do rstrip with the given chars (digits and '-'), the rstrip will remove trailing characters that are in that set. The last character is '2', which is in the set, so it's removed. The next character is '.' which is not in the set, so we stop. So the resulting string after stripping would be the original string with the last '2' removed. So the end becomes '2.' instead of '2.2'.\n\nTherefore, the output of f1 would be the original string with the last '2' stripped off. So the result of f1 is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original string ends with '2.2', so after removing the last '2', the string ends with '2.'. So the entire string after f1 is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.\n\nNow, moving on to f2. The function f2 takes a list of sentences (split by '.') and checks if all of them are decimal numbers. If so, returns 'oscillating', else 'not oscillating'.\n\nWait, the function f2 is defined as:\n\ndef f(sentences):\n    if all([sentence.isdecimal() for sentence in sentences.split('.')]):\n        return 'oscillating' \n    else:\n        return 'not oscillating'\n\nWait, the parameter is called sentences, but the function splits on '.' and checks each part. So the input to f2 is the result of f1, which is the string 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.\n\nWait, let me confirm the output of f1 again. The input to f1 was 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', and after stripping the last '2', the result is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.\n\nWait, but the '.' is still there. So the string after f1 is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.' (with a trailing '.' at the end? Or is it '2.' followed by nothing else?).\n\nWait, the original string ends with '2.2', so after stripping the last '2', the string ends with '2.' (since the '.' is before the last '2'). So the entire string after f1 is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.\n\nNow, when we pass this string to f2, which splits on '.' and checks each part. Let's split the string on '.'.\n\nThe string is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.' \u2192 splitting on '.' gives:\n\nThe parts are:\n\n1. 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2' (from before the '.'), and\n\n2. an empty string (because the string ends with a '.'), since splitting on '.' at the end would result in an empty string as the second element.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe string is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.' \u2192 splitting on '.' would split into:\n\nFirst part: 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2'\n\nSecond part: an empty string (since the '.' is at the end).\n\nSo the list of sentences is ['new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2', ''].\n\nNow, the function checks if all sentences are isdecimal(). The first part is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2' \u2192 which is not a decimal (contains letters and hyphens). The second part is an empty string, which also is not a decimal (since isdecimal() returns False for empty strings).\n\nTherefore, the all() condition is False, so f2 returns 'not oscillating'.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact steps again.\n\nThe function f2's code is:\n\ndef f(sentences):\n    if all([sentence.isdecimal() for sentence in sentences.split('.')]):\n        return 'oscillating' \n    else:\n        return 'not oscillating'\n\nSo sentences.split('.') splits the input string into parts separated by '.'.\n\nIn our case, the input to f2 is the result of f1, which is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.\n\nSplitting this on '.' gives:\n\nThe first part is everything up to the '.' \u2192 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2'\n\nThe second part is everything after the '.' \u2192 which is an empty string (since the '.' is at the end).\n\nSo the list is ['new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2', ''].\n\nNow, for each sentence in this list, check if it is decimal.\n\nThe first element is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2' \u2192 contains letters and hyphens, so isdecimal() is False.\n\nThe second element is an empty string \u2192 isdecimal() is also False.\n\nTherefore, the all() condition is False, so f2 returns 'not oscillating'.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the entire expression f2(f1(...)) is 'not oscillating'.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the f1 processing.\n\nWait, the original input to f1 is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', and the chars to strip are '0123456789-'. The rstrip removes trailing characters in that set. The last character is '2', which is in the set, so it's removed. The next character is '.' which is not in the set, so we stop. So the resulting string is everything except the last '2', so the string becomes 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.' (with a '.' at the end). So splitting on '.' gives the two parts as I mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the final output is 'not oscillating'.\n\nSo the assert statement should have 'not oscillating' as the expected value. Since the problem says to return the output enclosed in single quotes, the answer is 'not oscillating'."
