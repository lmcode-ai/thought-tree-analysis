The user wants the assert statement completed, so I have to compute the result step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the function f1. The code for f1 is:\n\ndef f1(nums):\n    for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):\n        if nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n            nums.remove(nums[i])\n    return nums\n\nWait, the parameters here are called nums and numbers in f2, but that's probably just a name difference. Let me focus on f1 first. The input is [5,3,3,7]. Let's walk through the loop.\n\nThe loop is range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1). The original list has 4 elements, so len(nums) is 4. So len(nums)-2 is 2. The range starts at 2 and goes down to -1 (exclusive), stepping by -1 each time. So the indices would be 2, 1, 0. Because when you go from 2 down to -1, the last step is when i is 0, then next would be -1 which is excluded.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The range parameters are start, stop, step. So starting at 2, and going down by 1 each step until it reaches -1 (but stops before that). So the indices are 2, 1, 0. So the loop runs for i=2, then 1, then 0.\n\nNow, the list is [5,3,3,7]. Let's index them as 0:5, 1:3, 2:3, 3:7.\n\nThe loop checks if nums[i] is even. If so, remove that element.\n\nStarting with i=2 (the third element, which is 3). 3 is odd, so no removal.\n\nNext, i=1 (second element, 3 again). Also odd, so no removal.\n\nThen i=0 (first element, 5). Also odd. So none of these elements are even. So the loop doesn't remove anything. Therefore, f1 returns the original list [5,3,3,7].\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original list has elements [5,3,3,7]. All are odd, so indeed, the remove step isn't triggered. So f1 returns the same list. So the output of f1 is [5,3,3,7].\n\nNow, pass that to f2. Let's look at f2's code:\n\ndef f2(numbers):\n    new_numbers = []\n    for i, _ in enumerate(numbers):\n        new_numbers.append(numbers[len(numbers)-1-i])\n    return new_numbers\n\nSo f2 is taking the input list and creating a new list where elements are reversed. Because for each index i from 0 to len(numbers)-1, it appends the element at position (len(numbers)-1 -i). So for the first iteration (i=0), it takes the last element, then i=1 takes the second last, etc. So the new_numbers will be the reverse of the input.\n\nThe input here is [5,3,3,7], so reversed would be [7,3,3,5].\n\nTherefore, the assert statement should check that f2(f1(...)) equals [7,3,3,5]. So the answer is [7,3,3,5].\n\nWait, but let me double-check the f1 function again. Because when you remove elements from a list while iterating, there can be issues. But in this case, since none of the elements are even, the list remains the same. So yes, the output of f1 is the original list. So f2 reverses it correctly.\n\nAnother thing to check: the loop in f1. The range is from len(nums)-2 down to -1. Wait, the original list is length 4, so len(nums)-2 is 2. The loop runs for i from 2 down to 0. So indices 2,1,0. So that's correct. The elements at those indices are 3 (i=2), 3 (i=1), 5 (i=0). All odd, so nothing is removed. So yes, the list remains [5,3,3,7].\n\nTherefore, the final output after f2 is [7,3,3,5]. So the assert should have that as the right-hand side."
