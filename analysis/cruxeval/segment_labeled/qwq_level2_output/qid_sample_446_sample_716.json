So after f1, the array remains empty. So f1([]) returns an empty list.\n\nNow, this result is passed to f2. So f2 is called with the empty list. Let's look at f2's code.\n\nFunction f2 takes nums. It sets count to the length of nums. Initially, since the input is empty, count is 0. Then there's a while loop that runs while len(nums) > (count//2).
