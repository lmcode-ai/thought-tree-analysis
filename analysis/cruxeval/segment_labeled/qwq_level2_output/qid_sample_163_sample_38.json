Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's look at the functions. The first function is f1, which takes text, space_symbol, and size. It creates a string of space_symbol repeated (size - len(text)) times, then appends that to the original text. So basically, it's padding the text on the right with the given space_symbol to reach the specified size.\n\nSo for f1('w', '))', 7), let's break that down. The text is 'w', which has length 1. The space_symbol is '))', and the size is 7. The number of spaces needed is 7 - 1 = 6. But each \"space\" here is actually the symbol '))', so each repetition adds two characters. Wait, no, wait. The space_symbol is a single character? Or can it be multiple? The code uses space_symbol for each iteration. So if space_symbol is '))', then each iteration adds two characters. So the total length added is (size - len(text)) multiplied by the length of space_symbol? Wait no, no. Wait, the code is ''.join(space_symbol for i in range(n)), which would actually just repeat the space_symbol n times. Wait, no, the code is space_symbol for each i in the range. So if space_symbol is '))', then each element in the list is '))', and joining them n times would be '))' repeated n times. So for example, if n is 3, then it would be ')))' * 3? Wait no, no. Wait, if space_symbol is '))', then each iteration adds that entire string. So for n=3, the spaces would be ')))' * 3? Wait no, no. Let me think again. The code is ''.join([space_symbol for _ in range(n)]). So if space_symbol is '))', and n is 3, then the list is ['))', '))', '))'], so when joined, it becomes ')))' * 3? Wait no, each element is '))', so three of them would be ')))' * 3? Wait no, three elements each of two characters would be ')))' * 3? Wait, no, three elements of '))' would be '))' + '))' + '))' which is '))))))' (six characters). So the total length added is (size - len(text)) multiplied by the length of space_symbol. Wait, but in this case, the space_symbol is '))', which is two characters. So for the first function, when called with 'w', '))', 7:\n\nThe text length is 1. The desired size is 7. So the number of symbols needed is 7 -1 =6. But each symbol is two characters. Wait, no, the number of repetitions is 6, but each repetition is the space_symbol. So the total added length is 6 * len(space_symbol). Wait, but in the code, the spaces variable is created by joining space_symbol repeated (size - len(text)) times. So the number of repetitions is (size - len(text)), and each is the space_symbol. So in this case, 7-1=6, so the spaces would be '))' repeated 6 times. So the total added is 6 * 2 =12 characters? Wait but that would make the total length 1 + 12 =13, which is way over the desired size of 7. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the parameters. Let me recheck the function f1's parameters.\n\nWait the function f1 is supposed to take text, space_symbol, and size. The idea is to pad the text to have a total length of size, using the space_symbol as the padding character. But the way it's written, the code is taking the space_symbol and repeating it (size - len(text)) times, then appending that to the text. So the total length would be len(text) + (size - len(text)) * len(space_symbol). Wait, that's a problem. Because if the space_symbol is longer than 1 character, then the total length would exceed the desired size. For example, in this case, the space_symbol is two characters, so each repetition adds two characters. So if the desired size is 7, and the text is 1, then (7-1) =6 repetitions of '))' would add 6 *2 =12 characters, leading to total length 13. That's way over. So that's a problem.

So for f1('w', '))',7):\n\ntext is 'w' (length 1). size is 7. So the number of repetitions is 7-1 =6. So spaces is '))' repeated 6 times, which is ')))' *6? Wait, no, each '))' is two characters, so 6 times would be 12 characters. So the total text after adding spaces would be 'w' + '))' *6.

But the desired size was 7, but the code is written in a way that may not achieve that. But regardless, the code is as written, so we have to go with that.\n\nNow, the result of f1 is that string. Then, we pass that to f2, which is the second function. Let's look at f2: it takes a string, converts it to title case (so first letter capitalized, others lowercase?), then replaces spaces with empty string. Wait, the code for f2 is def f(string): return string.title().replace(' ', '').\n\nSo first, title() method capitalizes each word's first letter and makes the rest lowercase.

So the final result of f2 is 'W))))))))))'.\n\nWait, but let's count the length. The original f1 output was 13 characters. After title, it's still 13. Then replacing spaces (none) so same. So the final output is 'W' followed by 12 ')', making 13 characters. So the assert statement should check that f2(f1(...)) equals this string. So the correct output is 'W))))))))))'.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the number of ')'. The space_symbol is '))', and the repetitions are 6. So each '))' is two ')', so 6 *2 =12. So total after 'W' is 12, so total 13. So the string is 'W' followed by 12 ')', which is 'W' + '))' *6 \u2192 yes.
