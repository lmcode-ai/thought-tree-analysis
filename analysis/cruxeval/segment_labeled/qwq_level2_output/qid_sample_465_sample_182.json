So for the input ['wise king', 'young king'], the initial roles dictionary would be {'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}.\n\nThen, there's an if condition checking if value is truthy.

Let's compare the first characters: 'w' vs 'y'. 'w' has a Unicode code point less than 'y', so yes, 'wise king' comes before 'young king'.
