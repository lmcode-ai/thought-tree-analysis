The function f1 takes two parameters: text and char. The code inside is return ' '.join(text.split(char, len(text))). Hmm, the split method here. The split function normally splits a string into a list wherever it finds the separator. The second argument to split is the maxsplit parameter.

So the length of text is 1. So the split would be split on 'a', with maxsplit=1. Let's see: the string is 'a', splitting on 'a' with maxsplit 1. The split would be ['', ''], because splitting on the first 'a' (but since the string is exactly one 'a', splitting once would create two empty strings. Then, when we join those with spaces, it would be ' ' (a single space between the two empty strings).

The function f2 takes a phrase and builds a string from characters that are NOT lowercase. Let's see: the input to f2 here is the space character ' '.\n\nLooking at each character in the phrase (which is the space). The space character is not a lowercase letter. Because islower() returns False for non-alphabetic characters. So, the space's islower() is False. Therefore, the condition if not i.islower() would be True, so the space is added to the result.
