The function f1 is defined as taking a string. It checks if the first 4 characters are not equal to 'Nuva'. If they aren't, it returns 'no'. Otherwise, it returns the string with any trailing whitespace removed using rstrip(). \n\nThe input here is 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'. The first four characters are 'Nuva' exactly, right? Because 'Nuva' is 4 letters. So the condition string[:4] != 'Nuva' would be false. Therefore, it goes to the else clause and returns the original string with rstrip().

Wait, the rpartition returns (left part, separator, right part). If the separator isn't found, then the left part is the entire string and the right part is empty.
