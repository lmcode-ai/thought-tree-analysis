Let me parse the original string:\n\nOriginal string: 'apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas'\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 'apples' followed by \\n, then \\t, then another \\n, then 'pears', then \\n, then \\t, another \\n, then 'bananas'.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write the string as a sequence of characters. Let me see:\n\nThe input to f1 is the string 'apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas'. Let me split it into parts separated by \\n:\n\nThe string can be split on \\n to see the lines. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 'apples', then a \\n, then the next part is '\\t' (since after the first \\n comes a \\t?), then another \\n, then 'pears', then \\n, then '\\t', another \\n, then 'bananas'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the original string as:\n\nOriginal string: 'apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas'\n\nBreaking it down character by character:\n\n- 'a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e', 's', then \\n, then '\\t', then \\n, then 'p', 'e', 'a', 'r', 's', then \\n, then '\\t', then \\n, then 'b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', 's'.\n\nSo when f1 is applied, every \\n is replaced with \\t. So let's process each \\n in the original string and replace them with \\t.\n\nOriginal string's \\n positions:\n\nLet me count the number of \\n in the original string. Let's see:\n\nLooking at 'apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas':\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter 'apples' comes \\n (1), then \\t, then another \\n (2), then 'pears', then \\n (3), then \\t, then \\n (4), then 'bananas'.\n\nSo there are four \\n characters. Each of these will be replaced by \\t.\n\nSo replacing each \\n with \\t:\n\nThe original string becomes:\n\napples\\t\\tpears\\t\\tbananas\n\nWait, let me reconstruct step by step:\n\nOriginal string:\n\n\"apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas\"\n\nAfter replacing each \\n with \\t:\n\nThe first \\n (after apples) becomes \\t \u2192 \"apples\\t\"\n\nThen the next part is \\t (from the original after the first \\n), so the next character after apples\\t is \\t (since the original had \\n followed by \\t, but the \\n is replaced by \\t. Wait, maybe I need to process each character.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the entire string step by step.\n\nOriginal string:\n\nThe entire string is:\n\n\"apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas\"\n\nBreaking it into parts separated by \\n:\n\nThe first part before the first \\n is \"apples\".\n\nThen after the first \\n comes the next part until the next \\n. The next part is \"\\t\\n\" ?\n\nWait, maybe splitting on \\n:\n\nSplit on \\n gives:\n\n1. \"apples\"\n\n2. \"\\t\" (because after the first \\n, the next characters until the next \\n are \\t, then another \\n comes. Wait, the second part between first and second \\n is \"\\t\", then the second \\n is the second split point.\n\nWait, let's split the original string on \\n:\n\nThe original string is:\n\n\"apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas\"\n\nSplit by \\n gives:\n\n[\"apples\", \"\\t\", \"pears\", \"\\t\", \"bananas\"]\n\nSo there are 5 elements. Each \\n is a split point. So the original has four \\n's.\n\nNow, when replacing each \\n with \\t, the entire string becomes:\n\nOriginal string with each \\n replaced by \\t:\n\n\"apples\\t\\tpears\\t\\tbananas\"\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first part is \"apples\", followed by a \\t (replaced from the first \\n). Then the next part is \"\\t\", but since the next \\n is replaced by \\t, the second split's part is \"\\t\", but between the first and second \\n, the text is \"\\t\", so after replacing the \\n between them with \\t, the sequence would be apples\\t followed by the next part (the second element after split) which is \"\\t\", then another \\t (from the second \\n), then the third element \"pears\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is done for every occurrence of \\n in the entire string, so each \\n is replaced with \\t, so the entire string becomes:\n\nOriginal string: apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas\n\nAfter replacing each \\n with \\t:\n\napples\\t\\tpears\\t\\tbananas\n\nBecause each \\n is replaced by \\t. Let me count:\n\nOriginal string's characters:\n\nStart with \"apples\", then \\n (1), then \\t, then \\n (2), then \"pears\", then \\n (3), then \\t, then \\n (4), then \"bananas\".\n\nSo replacing each \\n with \\t:\n\nThe first \\n becomes \\t \u2192 apples\\t\n\nThen comes the \\t (original character), then the second \\n becomes \\t \u2192 so after apples\\t comes \\t\\t (because the next character after the first \\n is \\t, then the second \\n is replaced by \\t. Wait, perhaps the entire string is:\n\nOriginal: apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas\n\nBreaking down each character:\n\n1. a p p l e s \\n \\t \\n p e a r s \\n \\t \\n b a n a n a s\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write the entire string as a sequence of characters with the replacements:\n\nOriginal string:\n\n\"apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas\"\n\nAfter replacing every \\n with \\t:\n\nEach \\n is replaced by \\t, so the string becomes:\n\n\"apples\\t\\tpears\\t\\tbananas\"\n\nBecause between \"apples\" and the first \\n, then the next part is \\t, then another \\n (so that \\n becomes \\t), so between apples and the next part, the two \\n's (the first and second) are replaced by \\t and \\t, leading to two tabs between apples and the next part. Wait, perhaps the exact replacement is as follows:\n\nOriginal string:\n\nThe first \\n after \"apples\" is replaced by \\t \u2192 so apples\\t\n\nThen the next characters are \\t (from the original), then another \\n (the second one) which is replaced by \\t \u2192 so after apples\\t comes \\t (original) then \\t (from replacing the second \\n). So that's \\t\\t between apples and the next part.\n\nThen comes \"pears\", followed by \\n (third) replaced by \\t, then \\t (original), then \\n (fourth) replaced by \\t, then \"bananas\".\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\napples\\t\\tpears\\t\\tbananas\n\nSo the result of f1 is that string.\n\nNow, this result is passed to f2. Let's see what f2 does.\n\nThe function f2 checks if the first four characters of the input string are 'Nuva'. If not, returns 'no'; else returns the string after rstrip().\n\nWait, the input to f2 is the output of f1, which is \"apples\\t\\tpears\\t\\tbananas\".\n\nThe first four characters of this string are 'appl', which is not 'Nuva', so the condition string[:4] != 'Nuva' is True, so f2 returns 'no'.\n\nTherefore, the final result of f2(f1(...)) is 'no', so the assert statement should have 'no' as the expected value.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the first four characters of the f1 output.\n\nThe f1 output is \"apples\\t\\tpears\\t\\tbananas\". The first four characters are 'a','p','p','l' \u2192 'appl', which is not 'Nuva', so yes, returns 'no'.\n\nTherefore, the correct output is 'no', so the assert statement should be:\n\nassert f2(f1('apples\\n\\t\\npears\\n\\t\\nbananas')) == 'no'\n\nSo the answer is 'no'."
