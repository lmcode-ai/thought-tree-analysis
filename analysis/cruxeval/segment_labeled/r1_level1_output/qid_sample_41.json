Let me go through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the function takes an array and a list of values. The first thing it does is reverse the array. Since the initial array is [58], reversing it would still be [58], right? Because there's only one element.\n\nThen, for each value in the values list (which is [21, 92]), it inserts the value into the array at the position len(array) // 2. Let's break that down. The array is currently [58], so len(array) is 1. 1 divided by 2 is 0.5, but integer division in Python truncates, so 1 // 2 is 0. So each value is inserted at position 0.\n\nBut wait, inserting at position 0 would add the elements at the beginning. Let's see: first, we reverse the array (still [58]), then insert 21 at position 0. The array becomes [21, 58]. Then, the next value is 92. Now, the array is [21, 58], so len(array) is 2. 2 // 2 is 1.

Reverse it: [58]. Then, for each value in [21, 92], insert at len(array) // 2. Let's process each value one by one.\n\nFirst value: 21. The array is still [58] (after reversing). Insert at position 0. So array becomes [21, 58]. Then, next value: 92. Now the array is [21, 58]. The length is 2, so 2 // 2 is 1. Insert 92 at position 1. So the array becomes [21, 92, 58].\n\nAfter inserting all values, the array is [21, 92, 58]. Then, the function reverses the array again. So reversing [21, 92, 58] gives [58, 92, 21]. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me retrace each step carefully.\n\nOriginal array: [58]\n\nFirst reverse: [58]\n\nThen, for each value in values (21, 92):\n\nFirst iteration (value=21):\nInsert into position len(array) // 2. len(array) is 1, so 0.5 becomes 0. So insert 21 at index 0. The array becomes [21, 58].\n\nSecond iteration (value=92):\nNow len(array) is 2, so 2 // 2 is 1. Insert 92 at index 1. The array becomes [21, 92, 58].\n\nAfter inserting both values, the array is [21, 92, 58]. Then, reverse again. Reversing this gives [58, 92, 21].\n\nSo the final array returned is [58, 92, 21].
