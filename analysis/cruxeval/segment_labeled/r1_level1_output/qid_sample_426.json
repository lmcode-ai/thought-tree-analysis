The list.insert(idx, elem) method inserts the element at the specified index. But what happens if the index is larger than the length of the list? Let's think. For example, if the list has 3 elements (indices 0,1,2), and we try to insert at index 5. Python handles this by appending the element to the end of the list. So inserting at an index beyond the list's length just puts it at the end.\n\nSo the original list is [1,2,3]. Inserting 8 at index 5. Since the list has length 3, the valid indices are 0,1,2,3 (if inserting at 3, it appends). Wait, inserting at index 3 would make the new element the fourth element. But the original list has 3 elements. So inserting at 3 would place it at the end. But in this case, the index is 5, which is larger than the length. So the insert method will place it at the end.\n\nTherefore, after insertion, the list becomes [1,2,3,8]. Wait, no. Wait, the original list is [1,2,3]. The length is 3. So inserting at index 5. According to Python's list.insert documentation, if the index is greater than the length, it's inserted at the end. So inserting 8 at index 5 would result in the list [1,2,3,8]. Because the insert happens at the end.\n\nWait, but maybe I should test this. Let's imagine in Python:\n\n>>> a = [1,2,3]\n>>> a.insert(5, 8)\n>>> a\n[1, 2, 3, 8]\n\nYes.
