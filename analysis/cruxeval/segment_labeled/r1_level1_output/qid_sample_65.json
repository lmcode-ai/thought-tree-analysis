The task is to compute the return value of f when called with [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and index 3. \n\nFirst, let's look at the code step by step. The function returns two parts added together: nums[index] % 42 and nums.pop(index) * 2. Wait, but nums.pop(index) will modify the list, right? Because pop removes the element at the given index and returns it. So, when we call nums.pop(index), the list nums will have that element removed. \n\nBut the order of operations here is important. Let's break it down. The original list is [3, 2, 0, 3, 7]. The index is 3. Let's check what element is at index 3. The list is zero-indexed, so index 0 is 3, index 1 is 2, index 2 is 0, index 3 is 3, and index 4 is 7. So nums[index] is 3.\n\nThen, nums[index] % 42 is 3 % 42, which is 3. Then, nums.pop(index) will remove the element at index 3 (which is 3) and return it. So after popping, the list becomes [3, 2, 0, 7], because the element at index 3 (the fourth element originally) is removed. Then, that popped value (3) is multiplied by 2, giving 6. \n\nSo the total return value is 3 (from the modulo) plus 6 (from the popped value multiplied by 2), which equals 9. Therefore, the function should return 9. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because when we call nums.pop(index), does that happen before or after the nums[index] % 42 is evaluated? Because once we pop the element, the list changes. So if the code is evaluating nums[index] first, then popping, but since popping changes the list, but the index is the same. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the code is written as nums[index] %42 + nums.pop(index)*2. So in Python, the expressions are evaluated left to right. So first, nums[index] is evaluated. Then, nums.pop(index) is evaluated, which removes the element at index 3, and returns it. Then multiply by 2, add to the modulo result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Get nums[index] which is 3 (index 3 in original list [3,2,0,3,7] is 3)\n2. Compute 3 % 42 = 3\n3. Then, nums.pop(3) removes the element at index 3, which is 3, returns 3\n4. Multiply that 3 by 2 to get 6\n5. Add 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo the return value is 9. Therefore, the assert statement should expect 9. \n\nBut let's check again. After popping index 3, the list becomes [3,2,0,7], but that doesn't affect the calculation here because we already evaluated nums[index] before popping. So yes, the result is 9."
