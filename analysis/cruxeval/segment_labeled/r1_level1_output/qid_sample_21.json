The function is provided, and I need to figure out what it does step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f takes an array as a parameter. Let's look at the code inside the function:\n\ndef f(array):\n    n = array.pop()\n    array.extend([n, n])\n    return array\n\nSo, the first line inside the function is n = array.pop(). The pop() method removes and returns the last element of the list. So in the test case where the input is [1, 1, 2, 2], popping the last element would remove the last 2. So n becomes 2, and the array after pop becomes [1, 1, 2].\n\nNext, the function does array.extend([n, n]). Since n is 2, this appends [2, 2] to the array. So after extending, the array would be [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. Wait, no. Wait, the array after pop is [1, 1, 2], then adding [2,2] would make it [1,1,2,2,2]?\n\nWait, wait. Let me step through it carefully.\n\nOriginal array: [1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nAfter array.pop() removes the last element (which is 2), the array becomes [1, 1, 2]. Then, extend adds the elements of the list [n, n], which is [2, 2], to the end. So the array becomes [1, 1, 2] + [2, 2] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. So the returned array would be [1, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n\nBut wait, the original array is [1,1,2,2], pop the last element (2) \u2192 array is now [1,1,2], then extend with [2,2], so array becomes [1,1,2,2,2]. So the function returns that array.\n\nBut the assert statement is checking if f([1,1,2,2]) equals what? According to this, the output should be [1,1,2,2,2].

But wait, the initial array had four elements, after popping, three, then adding two, total five elements. Yes.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

So the function returns that.\n\nTherefore, the correct output is [1,1,2,2,2]. But I need to make sure there are no errors in the code. For example, does the pop method correctly remove the last element? Yes. And extend adds the elements correctly. So the answer should be [1,1,2,2,2]."
