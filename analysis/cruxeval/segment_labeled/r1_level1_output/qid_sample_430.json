The function is supposed to return the concatenation of arr1 and arr2. Let me look at the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f takes two arrays, arr1 and arr2. It creates a copy of arr1 called new_arr. Then, it uses new_arr.extend(arr2), which appends all elements of arr2 to new_arr. Finally, it returns new_arr.\n\nSo, for the test case, arr1 is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], and arr2 is ['', 0, -1, []]. Copying arr1 gives the same list. Extending with arr2 adds the elements '', 0, -1, and an empty list [] to the end. Therefore, the result should be [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].\n\nI need to check if there's any mistake in the code.
