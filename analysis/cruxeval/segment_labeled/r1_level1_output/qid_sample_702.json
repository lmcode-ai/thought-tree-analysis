The first thing it does is set count to the length of nums. Then there's a loop that starts from the last index of nums and goes down to 0. Wait, the loop is using range(len(nums) -1, -1, -1), which would generate indices in reverse order. For example, if nums has 3 elements, indices are 2, 1, 0.\n\nInside the loop, for each i in that range, the code does nums.insert(i, nums.pop(0)). Let's break that down. nums.pop(0) removes and returns the first element of the list. Then insert that element at position i.\n\nLet me simulate this with the input [0, -5, -4]. The initial list is [0, -5, -4]. The loop runs for i in 2, 1, 0 (since len(nums) is 3, so len(nums)-1 is 2, and we go down to -1, but not including -1, so stops at 0).\n\nFirst iteration: i=2.\npop(0) removes 0, then insert at index 2.

The list remains [-4, -5, 0].\n\nWait, but after inserting, the list length remains 3 each time because we're popping and inserting each time, so the count stays 3. So the final list after all iterations is [-4, -5, 0]?\n\nWait let me check again step by step.\n\nOriginal list: [0, -5, -4]\n\nFirst loop iteration (i=2):\npop(0) \u2192 0 is removed. Insert at index 2. The list becomes [-5, -4, 0].\n\nSecond loop iteration (i=1):\nNow the list is [-5, -4, 0]. Pop(0) \u2192 -5. Insert at index 1.

Wait, that's the same as before. Because inserting at 0 when the list is [-4, ...], but after popping, the list is [-5, 0], then inserting -4 at 0? Wait no, let's correct.\n\nWait, after the second iteration, the list is [-4, -5, 0]. Then for the third iteration, i=0.\n\nAt that point, we pop(0) which is -4. Then insert it at position 0. So the list becomes [-4, -5, 0] again. So no change in that step.\n\nSo the final list is [-4, -5, 0].\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here.
