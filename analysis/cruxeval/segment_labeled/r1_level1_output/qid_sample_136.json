The function splits the input text into lines using split('\\n'), so each line is separated by newline characters.

So '  a  '.\n\nSecond line 'bc' is length 2. 5-2=3 spaces. 1 on left, 2 on right (since 3 is odd). So ' bc  '?\n\nWait, no. Let's check Python's center method. For even and odd padding.
