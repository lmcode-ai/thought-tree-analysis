The function f takes a row as input and returns a tuple with the count of '1's and the count of '0's in that row.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the code. The function counts how many times '1' appears in the row and how many times '0' appears, then returns those two counts as a tuple.\n\nSo for the input \"100010010\", I should count the number of '1's and '0's.
