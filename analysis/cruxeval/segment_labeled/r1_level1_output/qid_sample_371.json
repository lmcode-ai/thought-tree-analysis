The function is supposed to remove all odd numbers from the list and then sum the remaining elements. Let me step through the code carefully.\n\nFirst, the function f takes a list called nums. It starts by iterating over a copy of nums (nums[:]). For each element 'odd' in this copy, it checks if the element is odd (if odd % 2 != 0). If it is, it removes that element from the original nums list.\n\nWait, but modifying a list while iterating over a copy might have some issues. Let me see. The loop is over the copy, so the iteration isn't affected by the removal in the original list. But when you remove elements from the original list, the indices could shift. Hmm, but in this case, since the loop is over the copy, which is [11, 21, 0, 11], the code will check each element.\n\nSo the first element in the copy is 11. Since 11 is odd, it's removed from nums. Then the next element in the copy is 21, which is also odd, so remove from nums. Then 0, which is even (since 0 mod 2 is 0), so it's left. Then 11 again, which is odd, so removed.\n\nWait, but after the first removal, the original nums list changes. Let's track the nums list step by step.\n\nOriginal nums: [11, 21, 0, 11]\n\nFirst iteration (odd = 11 from the copy):\nCheck if 11 is odd \u2192 yes. Remove 11 from nums. Now nums becomes [21, 0, 11].\n\nSecond iteration (odd = 21 from the copy):\nCheck 21 is odd \u2192 yes. Remove 21 from nums. Now nums is [0, 11].\n\nThird iteration (odd = 0 from the copy):\n0 mod 2 is 0, so not removed. So nums remains [0, 11].\n\nFourth iteration (odd = 11 from the copy):\nCheck 11 is odd \u2192 yes. Remove 11 from nums. Now nums is [0].\n\nAfter this loop, the nums list should be [0]. Then, the sum of the remaining elements is 0. So the function should return 0.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck. The original list starts as [11,21,0,11]. The loop is over the copy, which is the original list's elements. Let's go step by step:\n\nCopy is [11,21,0,11].

So nums stays [0,11].\n\nFourth element:11. Remove from nums. Now nums is [0].\n\nSo after the loop, nums is [0]. Then sum_ is 0. So the function returns 0. But the test case given is [11,21,0,11], and the user is asking for the output of the assert statement. So the correct answer should be 0.
