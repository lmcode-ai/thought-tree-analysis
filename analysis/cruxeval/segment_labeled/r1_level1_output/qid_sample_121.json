The first line uses filter with a lambda to get all characters that are decimal, so c.isdecimal(). Then it joins them into nums. Wait, but the original string is '01,001'. The comma is not a decimal character, so filter would remove it. So nums would be '01001' because the commas are filtered out. \n\nWait, the lambda is checking if c.isdecimal(). The isdecimal() method returns True for characters that are decimal numbers. So numbers like '0', '1' are included, but commas are not.

Wait, but since the commas were removed, nums is '01001', so splitting by commas would result in a list with one element: ['01001']. Then, we create a list of integers from that. So the list is [1001], since '01001' as an integer is 1001. Then, take the max of that list, which is 1001.

The key points are: the filter removes the comma, making nums '01001'. Then splitting by comma gives a single element list. Converting that to integer is 1001, max is 1001, returned as '1001'. So the answer is '1001'."
