Then, it initializes an empty list r. The loop starts from the end of the string, going backwards. The range is from len(s)-1 down to 0, inclusive, since the third argument is -1. Wait, the range parameters are start, stop, step. So for s = 'crew', len(s) is 4. So the loop starts at 3 (since len(s)-1 is 3), and goes down to 0 (since the stop is 0 - 1, which is -1, but the loop stops before reaching the stop value).
