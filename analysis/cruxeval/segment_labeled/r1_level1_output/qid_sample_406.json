Swapping the first and last elements would make them 'H' and 'J', so the list becomes ['H', 'o', 's', 'J']. Then, we join them back into a string, which is 'HosJ'. \n\nThe next step is to check if this string is a title case. The istitle() method returns True if the string is a title-cased string, meaning each word starts with an uppercase character and the rest are lowercase. But in this case, the string is 'HosJ'. The first character is 'H', which is uppercase, but the last character is 'J', which is uppercase. The middle characters are lowercase. However, in title case, all characters after the first should be lowercase unless it's a new word. Since 'HosJ' has a capital J at the end, the entire string is not in title case. Therefore, istitle() would return False.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The istitle() method checks if each word is title-cased. Since there's only one word here, 'HosJ', the first letter is uppercase, but the subsequent letters must be lowercase. The 'o' and 's' are lowercase, but the last 'J' is uppercase. So the entire string is not title-cased, so the result should be False. Therefore, the assert statement should expect False."
