Therefore, the condition s.startswith(n) would be false. Hence, the function returns s unchanged.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. The first argument is n = 'xqc', and the second is s = 'mRcwVqXsRDRb'. The startswith method checks if the beginning of s matches n exactly. So, does 'mRcwVqXsRDRb' start with 'xqc'? Let's look at the first three characters of s. The first character is 'm', then 'R', 'c', etc. So the first three characters are 'mRc', which is not 'xqc'. So the startswith condition is false. Therefore, the function returns s as is. \n\nSo the output should be 'mRcwVqXsRDRb'. The assert statement is expecting the result of the function call to be equal to that string.
