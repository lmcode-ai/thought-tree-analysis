The function is supposed to return a list of the fractional parts of each number in the input, but only if at least one of those fractional parts is exactly 1. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.\n\nFirst, let's look at the code. The function f takes a list called numbers. It creates a list called floats where each element is n % 1 for each n in numbers. Then it checks if 1 is in floats. If yes, it returns floats; otherwise, it returns an empty list.\n\nWait a minute, n % 1 gives the remainder when n is divided by 1. For any integer n, n % 1 is 0 because integers are whole numbers with no fractional part. So if all numbers in the input are integers, each n % 1 would be 0. Therefore, the floats list would be all zeros, so 1 is not present, so the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe test case here is range(100, 120). Let's think about what range(100, 120) gives. In Python, range starts from the first number and goes up to but not including the second. So range(100, 120) is the numbers 100, 101, ..., 119. All of these are integers.
