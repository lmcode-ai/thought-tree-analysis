The modulus operation: \n        i = (i % n) + 1 If n is zero? then modulus by zero. The original Python: if n==0, then modulus by zero. So we must assume n is at least 1? The input: \"n, m\" and the while loop: i % n. If n==0, then modulus by zero. The problem does not specify constraints, but in the context, n is at least 1? We'll assume the input n is positive, as in the original problem. Similarly, the second program: if x==0, then gcd(360,0)=360, then 360//360=1. Now, let's test with the example: \"5 10\" -> step1: \n        n=5, m=10, i=1\n        iteration1: m=10-1=9, i= (1%5)+1=2\n        iteration2: m=9-2=7, i= (2%5)+1=3\n        iteration3: m=7-3=4, i= (3%5)+1=4 -> m=4 is <4? no, so subtract: m=0, i= (4%5)+1=5\n        Then i=5, m=0 -> 0>=5? no. So result1=0. Step2: x=0 -> gcd(360,0)=360, then 360/360=1.

Step2: x=1 -> gcd(360,1)=1 -> 360//1=360. Step3: string \"360\"\n        even indices: index0: '3', index2: '0' -> count_even0: at index0: '3' -> not 0 or 1 -> skip. at index2: '0' -> count_even0=1. count_even1: 0.\n        odd indices: index1: '6' -> no count for 0 or 1 -> count_odd0=0, count_odd1=0.

Then step3: input \"360\" -> \n            s = \"360\"\n            even = Counter(s[0::2]) -> ['3','0'] -> Counter: '3':1, '0':1 -> even[\"0\"]=1, even[\"1\"]=0\n            odd = Counter(s[1::2]) -> ['6'] -> Counter: '6':1 -> odd[\"0\"]=0, odd[\"1\"]=0\n            then: \n                len(s)- (even[\"0\"]+odd[\"1\"]) = 3 - (1+0)=2\n                len(s)- (even[\"1\"]+odd[\"0\"]) = 3 - (0+0)=3\n            min(2,3)=2.

The output of the second program is an integer and the third program expects a string input? \n\n But wait: the third program reads a string. However, the chain is:\n\n   File1 (outputs an integer) -> File2 (which expects an integer) -> File3 (which expects a string)\n\n This is a problem because the output of File2 is an integer and File3 expects a string.\n\n We must reexamine the chain. The original description says the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n In the provided chain:\n\n   Input for the entire chain: the input for the first program (two integers) and then the third program expects a string? \n\n But note: the second program's output is an integer and then the third program expects a string. \n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the chain is:\n\n   Step1: Read two integers (n and m) -> output an integer (m_remaining)\n   Step2: Read an integer (x) -> output an integer (360 // gcd(360, x))\n   Step3: Read a string -> output an integer (min changes)\n\n This chain is not compatible because the output of step1 is an integer and step2 expects an integer (which is fine) but then step3 expects a string, but step2 outputs an integer.\n\n This suggests that the chain as described might be intended to run independently? But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning the output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n Therefore, we must adjust: the third program expects a string, but the second program outputs an integer. \n\n However, looking at the original problem, the programs are in separate files and are run in sequence. The input to the second program is the output of the first, and the input to the third program is the output of the second? But that would be an integer, but the third program expects a string.\n\n This seems like a discrepancy. But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and we are to translate into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\n\n How was the original chain executed?\n\n Example:\n\n   $ python file1.py\n   input: \"5 10\"\n   outputs: 0   (for example)\n\n   Then: $ python file2.py\n   input: \"0\"   (from the previous output)\n   outputs: 360 // gcd(360,0) -> gcd(360,0) is 360 -> output 1\n\n   Then: $ python file3.py\n   input: \"1\"   (from the previous output, which is the string \"1\")\n   then it processes the string \"1\": \n        s = ['1']\n        even = Counter of s[0::2] -> ['1'] -> Counter('1':1)\n        odd = Counter of s[1::2] -> [] -> empty Counter\n        then two options:\n            even[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"] = 0 + 0 = 0 -> changes = len(s) - 0 = 1\n            even[\"1\"] + odd[\"0\"] = 1 + 0 = 1 -> changes = len(s) - 1 = 0\n        min(1,0) = 0\n\n So the entire chain: input \"5 10\" -> output 0.\n\n But note: the third program is using the integer output of the second program converted to a string? \n\n Yes, in a shell, the output of one program is passed as a string to the next.\n\n Therefore, in our C program:\n\n   Step1: reads two integers (n and m) and produces an integer (m_remaining). Then we convert that integer to a string and use that as the input to step2? \n\n However, step2 expects an integer. But when step2 reads from stdin, it reads a string and then converts to integer. Similarly, step3 reads a string.\n\n But in our C program, we are to avoid I/O in the middle. Therefore, we must simulate:\n\n   The entire chain has two inputs: the first program's input (two integers) and then the third program's input is the string representation of the integer output by the second program? \n\n But wait: the chain has only one initial input: the one for the first program. The next two programs get their input from the previous program's output.\n\n Therefore, we have:\n\n   Input to the entire chain: two integers (n and m) and then a string? \n\n However, the original chain does not require an additional string. The string for the third program is the output of the second program (which is an integer, so it's the string representation of that integer).\n\n So the entire chain:\n\n   Input: two integers (for the first program)\n   Then the first program outputs an integer (which becomes a string for the second program? but note: the second program reads an integer from stdin, so it will read the integer that was printed by the first as a string and then convert to integer. Similarly, the third program reads a string which is the output of the second (which is an integer printed as a string).\n\n However, in the C program, we are to avoid I/O in the middle. Therefore, we will:\n\n   Step1: compute the integer result1 (from the first program) without printing it.\n   Step2: use result1 as the input to the second program (so we pass it as an integer, then compute an integer result2).\n   Step3: convert result2 to a string (so that we have a string of digits) and then use that string as the input to the third program.\n\n This matches the chain.\n\n Therefore, the plan:\n\n   Read the initial input: two integers (n and m) from stdin.\n\n   Step1: \n        i = 1;\n        while (m >= i) {\n            m -= i;\n            i = (i % n) + 1;\n        }\n        result1 = m;   (an integer)\n\n   Step2: \n        x = result1;\n        Then compute: result2 = 360 / gcd(360, x);   (but note: if x is 0, gcd(360,0) is 360? but actually gcd(0,360)=360. However, in the gcd function we must handle 0. We note that gcd(a,0)=|a|. But 360 is positive, so gcd(360,0)=360.\n\n   Step3: \n        We now have an integer result2. Convert it to a string. Then process the string as in the third program.\n\n        Steps for the third program:\n            s = the string (which is the string representation of result2)\n            Split the string into even and odd indices (0-indexed: even indices: 0,2,4,...; odd indices: 1,3,5,...)\n            Count in the even indices: \n                count_even0 = count of '0' in even positions\n                count_even1 = count of '1' in even positions\n            Similarly, in the odd indices:\n                count_odd0 = count of '0' in odd positions\n                count_odd1 = count of '1' in odd positions\n            Then two possibilities:\n                Option1: even positions are '0' and odd positions are '1'. Then the number of correct positions would be: (count_even0 + count_odd1). The total changes needed would be: total_length - (count_even0+count_odd1)\n                Option2: even positions are '1' and odd positions are '0'. Then the number of correct positions would be: (count_even1 + count_odd0). The total changes needed would be: total_length - (count_even1+count_odd0)\n            Then result3 = min(option1, option2)\n\n        Then output result3.\n\n However, note: the third program does not assume that the string only contains '0' and '1'? But in the problem, the string is the output of the second program, which is an integer. The integer is printed as a string of digits. The digits are only '0' to '9'. But the third program is designed for a string of '0' and '1'. \n\n This is a problem: the third program in the original chain was intended for a binary string. But the output of the second program is an integer (like 1, 2, 3, ... 360) which is a decimal string. The third program will count the '0' and '1' in the even and odd positions. For example, if the string is \"123\", then:\n\n   even indices: ['1','3'] -> Counter: '1':1, '3':1 -> even[\"0\"]=0, even[\"1\"]=1\n   odd indices: ['2'] -> Counter: '2':1 -> odd[\"0\"]=0, odd[\"1\"]=0\n\n   Then the two options:\n        Option1: 0 (from even[\"0\"]) + 0 (from odd[\"1\"]) = 0 -> changes = 3 - 0 = 3\n        Option2: 1 (from even[\"1\"]) + 0 (from odd[\"0\"]) = 1 -> changes = 3 - 1 = 2\n        min(3,2)=2\n\n But the original third program was designed for a binary string. However, the problem says: the entire sequence. And in the sequence, the third program is given the string output of the second program (which is a decimal representation of an integer). So we must run the third program exactly as described on that string.\n\n Therefore, we do as above.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read n and m.\n\n   Step1: \n        int i = 1;\n        while (m >= i) {\n            m -= i;\n            i = (i % n) + 1;\n        }\n        int result1 = m;\n\n   Step2:\n        int x = result1;\n        int g = gcd(360, x);   // write a gcd function\n        int result2 = 360 / g;\n\n   Step3:\n        Convert result2 to a string (we need to allocate a buffer). Note: the maximum value of result2: 360 is the maximum? Actually, gcd(360,x) is at least 1, so result2 is at most 360. So the string representation has at most 3 digits? Actually, 360 is the maximum. But we'll be safe: 360 -> 3 digits, but we can do 4 to be safe (if we had a bigger number? but we don't). But note: what if the second program outputs 360? Then we have \"360\", which is 3 characters.\n\n        We'll convert result2 to a string and store in a char array.\n\n        Then we process the string:\n            Let len = strlen(s);\n            We'll traverse the string and count:\n                count_even0 = number of times we see '0' at an even index (index0: even, index1: odd, index2: even, ...)\n                count_even1 = number of times we see '1' at an even index\n                Similarly, for odd indices: count_odd0 and count_odd1.\n\n            Then:\n                option1 = len - (count_even0 + count_odd1);\n                option2 = len - (count_even1 + count_odd0);\n                result3 = (option1 < option2) ? option1 : option2;\n\n        Print result3.\n\n Important: the third program does not assume the string is binary? It just counts the characters '0' and '1'. Any other character (like '2','3', etc.) are not counted. So if the string is \"2\", then:\n        even indices: ['2'] -> count_even0 = 0, count_even1 = 0.\n        odd indices: nothing.\n        Then option1: 1 - (0+0) = 1, option2: 1 - (0+0)=1 -> result3=1.\n\n But note: the original program in Python uses collections.Counter, so it counts only the occurrences of the specified keys. For keys that are not present, it returns 0.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create an array for the string. Since result2 is at most 360, we can use a fixed-size buffer of 20 characters.\n\n   Steps for converting integer to string: we can use sprintf.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". We are not printing, but we are converting an integer to a string for the third step. This is acceptable because the original chain passed the output as a string. We are simulating the string without I/O.\n\n But note: the third program in the original chain reads from stdin. We are avoiding I/O by not reading from stdin for the third program. Instead, we are building the string in memory.\n\n We are going to write the entire C program:\n\n   Steps:\n\n     #include necessary headers: stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h (for abs? not needed for gcd, but we can write our own gcd)\n\n     We write a gcd function.\n\n     main():\n\n        // Step0: read n and m\n        int n, m;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n        // Step1: the while loop\n        int i = 1;\n        while (m >= i) {\n            m -= i;\n            i = (i % n) + 1;\n        }\n        int result1 = m;\n\n        // Step2: \n        int x = result1;\n        // Compute gcd(360, x) -> we need to handle negative? but x is nonnegative (from the first step: m becomes nonnegative and then subtracted by positive numbers, so it's nonnegative). \n        int g = gcd(360, x);\n        int result2 = 360 / g;\n\n        // Step3: convert result2 to a string\n        char s[20]; // enough for integers up to 360 (3 digits) and more\n        sprintf(s, \"%d\", result2);\n        int len = strlen(s);\n\n        // Now, we need to count:\n        int count_even0 = 0, count_even1 = 0;\n        int count_odd0 = 0, count_odd1 = 0;\n\n        for (int idx = 0; idx < len; idx++) {\n            if (idx % 2 == 0) { // even index (0-indexed: 0,2,4,...)\n                if (s[idx] == '0') {\n                    count_even0++;\n                } else if (s[idx] == '1') {\n                    count_even1++;\n                }\n            } else { // odd index\n                if (s[idx] == '0') {\n                    count_odd0++;\n                } else if (s[idx] == '1') {\n                    count_odd1++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int option1 = len - (count_even0 + count_odd1);\n        int option2 = len - (count_even1 + count_odd0);\n        int result3 = (option1 < option2) ? option1 : option2;\n\n        // Output the result of the entire chain (result3)\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", result3);\n\n        return 0;\n\n     Now, we need to write the gcd function:\n\n        int gcd(int a, int b) {\n            // We ensure that a and b are nonnegative? a=360, and x is nonnegative.\n            if (b == 0) {\n                return a;\n            }\n            return gcd(b, a % b);\n        }\n\n     However, we can do iterative to avoid recursion depth (since 360 is small) but we can also do iterative.\n\n        int gcd(int a, int b) {\n            int temp;\n            while (b != 0) {\n                temp = b;\n                b = a % b;\n                a = temp;\n            }\n            return a;\n        }\n\n     But note: if x==0, then gcd(360,0) = 360. The iterative version: \n          a=360, b=0 -> then the loop doesn't run, returns 360.\n\n     Also, if x is negative? but in our case, x is nonnegative.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll write the iterative gcd.\n\n   However, note: the gcd function must work for nonnegative a and b? Our a is 360 (positive) and b is x (nonnegative). \n\n   But if x is negative? The problem states that the first program: m becomes nonnegative (because we subtract until m is less than i, which is positive). So x (which is m) is nonnegative.\n\n   Also, the modulus operation in C for negative numbers: but we are passing nonnegative.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   But note: the first program: n and m are read as integers. The problem does not specify nonnegative, but the loop condition (m>=i) and i>=1, so if m becomes negative, the loop stops. So m is nonnegative at the end? Actually, the loop condition is m>=i, and i is at least 1. So if m is negative initially, we skip the loop and output m (negative). Then the second program: gcd(360, negative) -> but gcd is defined for negative numbers? However, the gcd function we write uses modulus, which for negative numbers in C: the sign of the modulus result is implementation-defined? We want to avoid.\n\n   According to the problem: the same behavior. The original Python gcd from math: gcd(360, -x) = gcd(360, x). So we should compute the gcd with nonnegative numbers.\n\n   We can take absolute value? But the problem: the original program uses `gcd(360, x)`. In Python, the gcd function handles negative by taking absolute value? The math.gcd returns nonnegative. So we should do:\n\n        x = result1;\n        if (x < 0) {\n            // But note: the first program: m can be negative? \n            // The first program: if the input m is negative, then the while loop is skipped and m remains negative.\n            // Then we have x negative. We want gcd(360, x) to be the same as gcd(360, -x) (in absolute value).\n            // We can take absolute value of x? but then we have to be cautious: 360 is positive.\n            // Alternatively, we can take absolute value of x? \n            // But note: the gcd function we wrote is for nonnegative? We can make it work by taking absolute value.\n        }\n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust the gcd function to work for any integers? The iterative gcd can be:\n\n        int gcd(int a, int b) {\n            a = abs(a);\n            b = abs(b);\n            ... // then do iterative\n        }\n\n   But the problem: the original program uses `gcd(360, x)`. The 360 is positive, and the gcd is nonnegative. And the result is 360 // g, which is an integer.\n\n   Since we are in control, and the original chain in Python uses math.gcd which returns the nonnegative gcd, we can do:\n\n        int gcd(int a, int b) {\n            a = a < 0 ? -a : a;\n            b = b < 0 ? -b : b;\n            // then proceed with iterative\n            if (b == 0) return a;\n            while (b != 0) {\n                int temp = b;\n                b = a % b;\n                a = temp;\n            }\n            return a;\n        }\n\n   However, we know that 360 is positive. So we only need to take absolute value of x? Actually, the gcd(360, x) = gcd(360, |x|). So we can do:\n\n        int g = gcd(360, abs(x));\n\n   But our gcd function above does not take absolute value of a? We passed 360 which is positive. So we can change the call:\n\n        int g = gcd(360, x);   // but if x is negative, our gcd function must handle.\n\n   Alternatively, we can make the gcd function work for negative by taking absolute value at the beginning.\n\n   Let me write:\n\n        int gcd(int a, int b) {\n            // Take absolute values? \n            a = a > 0 ? a : -a;\n            b = b > 0 ? b : -b;\n            // Now both nonnegative.\n            if (b == 0) {\n                return a;\n            }\n            while (b != 0) {\n                int temp = b;\n                b = a % b;\n                a = temp;\n            }\n            return a;\n        }\n\n   This handles negative.\n\n   However, the problem: the first program might output a negative? The first program: \n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        then the while loop: condition m>=i. If m is negative, the loop is skipped. So m remains negative.\n\n   Then the second program: \n        x = negative integer.\n\n   The original Python: \n        gcd(360, x) -> returns the nonnegative gcd. So we must do the same.\n\n   Therefore, we write the gcd function that returns the nonnegative gcd.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the absolute value in the gcd function by using the Euclidean algorithm that uses absolute value in modulus? Actually, the modulus in C for negative numbers: \n        For example: a % b when a is negative: the sign of the result is the same as a? \n        We want to avoid that. So taking absolute value is safe.\n\n   But note: the gcd function we wrote above that takes absolute value at the beginning is safe.\n\n   However, there is a problem: if both are zero? but we know 360 is positive, so a is positive. So we don't have to worry about a being zero? Actually, if a is 360 (positive) and b is negative, we take absolute value of b.\n\n   So we'll write the gcd function with absolute values.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        int gcd(int a, int b) {\n            if (a < 0) a = -a;\n            if (b < 0) b = -b;\n            while (b) {\n                int temp = b;\n                b = a % b;\n                a = temp;\n            }\n            return a;\n        }\n\n   This is efficient and safe.\n\n   But note: if b is zero, then the loop condition (b !=0) fails and we return a (which is nonnegative). So that's correct.\n\n   Therefore, we'll use this.\n\n   Now, what if the first program: n and m. The problem does not specify constraints. We assume they are integers. The modulus operation: \n        i = (i % n) + 1\n\n   If n is zero? then modulus by zero. The original Python: if n==0, then modulus by zero. So we must assume n is at least 1? \n\n   The input: \"n, m\" and the while loop: i % n. If n==0, then modulus by zero. \n\n   The problem does not specify constraints, but in the context, n is at least 1? \n\n   We'll assume the input n is positive, as in the original problem.\n\n   Similarly, the second program: if x==0, then gcd(360,0)=360, then 360//360=1.\n\n   Now, let's test with the example: \"5 10\" -> step1: \n        n=5, m=10, i=1\n        iteration1: m=10-1=9, i= (1%5)+1=2\n        iteration2: m=9-2=7, i= (2%5)+1=3\n        iteration3: m=7-3=4, i= (3%5)+1=4 -> m=4 is <4? no, so subtract: m=0, i= (4%5)+1=5\n        Then i=5, m=0 -> 0>=5? no. So result1=0.\n\n   Step2: x=0 -> gcd(360,0)=360, then 360/360=1.\n\n   Step3: convert 1 to string \"1\", then:\n        even indices: ['1'] -> count_even0=0, count_even1=1\n        odd indices: [] -> count_odd0=0, count_odd1=0\n        option1: 1 - (0+0)=1\n        option2: 1 - (1+0)=0\n        result3 = min(1,0)=0.\n\n   So output 0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Another example: \"3 10\"\n        n=3, m=10\n        i=1: m=10-1=9 -> i= (1%3)+1=2\n        i=2: m=9-2=7 -> i=(2%3)+1=3\n        i=3: m=7-3=4 -> i=(3%3)+1=1\n        i=1: m=4-1=3 -> i=2\n        i=2: m=3-2=1 -> i=3\n        now m=1 < i=3 -> break. result1=1.\n\n   Step2: x=1 -> gcd(360,1)=1 -> 360//1=360.\n\n   Step3: string \"360\"\n        even indices: index0: '3', index2: '0' -> count_even0: at index0: '3' -> not 0 or 1 -> skip. at index2: '0' -> count_even0=1.\n        count_even1: 0.\n        odd indices: index1: '6' -> no count for 0 or 1 -> count_odd0=0, count_odd1=0.\n        Then:\n            option1: 3 - (1+0)=2\n            option2: 3 - (0+0)=3\n            min(2,3)=2.\n\n   So output 2.\n\n   We can verify: \n        Original step1: output 1.\n        Then step2: input 1 -> output 360.\n        Then step3: input \"360\" -> \n            s = \"360\"\n            even = Counter(s[0::2]) -> ['3','0'] -> Counter: '3':1, '0':1 -> even[\"0\"]=1, even[\"1\"]=0\n            odd = Counter(s[1::2]) -> ['6'] -> Counter: '6':1 -> odd[\"0\"]=0, odd[\"1\"]=0\n            then: \n                len(s)- (even[\"0\"]+odd[\"1\"]) = 3 - (1+0)=2\n                len(s)- (even[\"1\"]+odd[\"0\"]) = 3 - (0+0)=3\n            min(2,3)=2.\n\n   So it matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Note: we must be cautious about the string conversion: if the integer is 0, then we get \"0\". Then the string is \"0\", so:\n        even indices: ['0'] -> count_even0=1, count_even1=0\n        odd indices: [] -> 0\n        option1: 1 - (1+0)=0\n        option2: 1 - (0+0)=1\n        min=0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   We assume the input n and m are integers (and n>=1).\n\n   We'll include:\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>   // for abs\n\n   But note: we are writing our own abs? Actually, we are taking absolute value in gcd by condition. We don't need stdlib for abs.\n\n   However, we can use abs from stdlib? But we are not. We are doing:\n\n        if (a<0) a=-a;\n\n   So we don't need stdlib.\n\n   But we do need stdio for scanf/printf, string for strlen.\n\n   Let's code accordingly."
